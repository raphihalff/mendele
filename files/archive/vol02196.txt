Subject: Sutzkever evening

According to the poster on the Hebrew Univ. campus.  On
Tuesday, 18 May at 5:30 p.m in "Beit Belgia" (Belgium
House) on the Givat Ram campus, there will be an event
in honor of Sutzkever who recently turned 80. The
sponsors are the National Library and the Yiddish Dept.
Listed on the poster (in Hebrew and without their
titles) are the following: Avraham Karpinovitz Yossl
Birstein Dan Miron Chone Shmeruk Avraham Sutzkever [and
in "tal va-matar"]: Chairman: Avraham Noverstern.

for now, off to the class of Turniansky in old yiddish.

When I was growing up in the 'thirties I often heard
from my parents

"Shulugs zik kup in vent un shry 'hurra'" in response
to my complaint "there's nothing to do."  I never heard
the phrase used in translation then or later.

My wife and I did have a midwestern Protestant friend
who we figured was an honorary Jew, who was much taken
with "hock mir nicht kein chinik" which we often
translated as "stop banging my teapot."  Forty years
later slogans such as these are the only Yiddish we use
freely, except for the one about teapots.  I guess it
serves to remind us of a time when we were all much
younger.

Subject: Re: The word `nar'

        I had always assumed that the Yiddish word
`nar', meaning a fool, was derived from the Hebrew word
for a youth.  In fact, I thought that the Yiddish word
meant a fool, in the sense of someone who is puerile. I
recently learned, however, that there is a German word
`Narr', which means a fool or buffoon.

        Does anyone know what the etymology of the
Yiddish word is?  There seem to be a number of
possibilities. One is that the Yiddish word actually
comes from the German word, and it is just a
coincidence that there is a somewhat related word in
Hebrew. Another is that the Yiddish word does derive
from Hebrew word. But then, it would be an astonishing
coincidence that there is such a similar word in
German. Someone might, however, conjecture that the
German word actually comes from Hebrew by way of
Yiddish. Do we have any evidence about which comes from
which?

Subject: From the shames

Mendele begins its third year on May 15, a suitable
occasion for mirth and foolishness.  If you've been
saving some especially bad doggerel, riddles, smarmy
ballads, jokes--this is your chance to unload some of
the inventory.
