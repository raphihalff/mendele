Subject: Introduction

I am a Fellow of the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew
Studies.  My field is NOT Yiddish (I specialize in Medieval
Jewish History and Hebrew Literature with an emphasis on
Jewish culture in the lands of Islam and more specifically,
Karaitica).  Nevertheless, I am very much interested in
Yiddish (Read, Understand, Speak it).  Please regard me as
a dedicated amateur.

Subject: Standard Yiddish

A comment and a couple of questions:
 
When I studied at the Sholem Aleichem Folkshul, I was told
that we were being taught a `standard Yiddish'
pronunciation and spelling, based on the standard of the
New York Yiddish theatre.  Is this a random choice, or was
the theatrical Yiddish pronunciation consciously
standardized (in the early part of the century, I would
imagine)? Also, where would I find information about what
you are all referring to as `standard'?  About a
standardized transcription system?
 
I am thoroughly enjoying reading Mendele - and
rediscovering a great deal of Yiddish in the process!

Subject: Yiddish absent from where it should be

Yude-Leyb Proger's mention of the Andrzej Wajda film
reminded me of the absence of Yiddish in Claude Lanzmann's
film "Shoah".  Seven (or how many?) hours of documentary on
the Holocaust in three (or four? five?) different
languages, with native French-, German-, Polish-speaking
interviewers and translators, and no Yiddish interviews.
(I don't think I saw the whole movie -- please correct me
if I'm wrong or confirm this if I'm right.)

Subject: Ludic Yiddish

I truly enjoued reading Yude-Leyb Proger's "Ludic Yiddish,"
especially Part 2. I wonder whether he would consider
sending a ms. of it to the National Yiddish Book Center in
Amherst,Massachusetts. Perhaps Aaron Lansky would publish
it in "Der Pakn Treyger."

[Later, in a second post:]

My message of a few minutes ago uring wider circulation of
Yude-Leyb's "Ludic Yiddish" mentioned only Parts 1 and 2,
as I had not yet noticed Part 3. Part 3 is good too!
