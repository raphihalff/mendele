Subject: mir/wir

There is a good deal of fluctuation between the word "Mir" and the word
"Wir" for the first person plural in the German dialects. In Modern  High
German, "wir" has become standardized, whereas in Yiddish "mir" has become
standardized.  My favorite example of dialect regionalism is in
Letzeburgesch:

Mir woelle bleiwe wat mir sin.

Subject: fatsheyle

I'm trying to track down the origin of the word my mother and her sisters
used for a tikhl or head covering that they put on when they lit candles
erev shabbes etc. They called it a fatsheyle or fatshelke. Anyone have any
idea of the origins of this word? It isn't in standard Russian
dictionaries. They came from a small town in the Kiev province, so
Ukrainian would seem to be a good bet.

A dank,

Berny Cooperman

Subject: recent Yiddish songs by women

I wrote a setting for voice and piano of Rokhl Korn's beautiful poem
"kh'shtey in der mitogtsayt..."  It's been performed a number of times
during the past few years, most notably by Adrienne Cooper and Mimi
Stern-Wolfe at an ASJM concert three years ago. I'll be glad to send you
the score if you send me (goodman@sci.ccny.cuny.edu) your address.

Subject: shpiltsleve

Bob Rothstein is right in explaining the meaning of the word "shpiltsleve."
I happen to know it not from the dictionary but as Russian and Yiddish
speaker. Being a bit hot tempered myself, I heard this word from my
mother's mouth many times.

Subject: Yidcore

I'm doing some work on a play and I'm looking for heavy metal/rock
recordings of traditional Yiddish songs.  I've recently stumbled on a
movement called Yidcore (Yiddish + Hard Core), but haven't found exactly
what I'm looking for, which is rock versions of "Rozhinkes mit Mandlen"
and/or "Oyfn Pripetshik."

Any leads?

Thanks,
Warren Hoffman

Subject: shule

Does anyone know what "shule" is - as in the following sentence:

Mir hobn oysgeshtelt undzere keylim unter di beymer, velkhe hobn gekvelt
mit shule (shin-vov-lamed-ayin).

From the context, it seems that it is some sort of tree sap that was
collected in the forest in Russia around Lag B'Omer.

Leyzer Gillig

[Moderator's note:  Mr. Gillig quickly answered his own question and was
kind enough to share this information.]

In an online Lithuanian-English dictionary, I found that "sula" is birch
sap. Fits in perfectly, as birch sap in Eastern Europe was a treat, much as
maple sap is in North America.

Subject: Searchable Yiddish Database

Mendelists or Mendelianer,

So far as I know, there is not yet an extensive, searchable database of
Yiddish literature.  In contrast, Hebrew literature has the growing Ben
Yehuda Project online at http://www.benyehuda.org/ and other databases such
as the Bar Ilan Judaic Library, which are becoming important tools in the
study of Hebrew language and literature.

My understanding is that the National Yiddish Book Center would be
interested in developing a searchable library or database, using their vast
collection that has already been digitized.  Can someone suggest a way to
assist the NYBC in making its digital collection available as searchable
site or DVD?  Apparently the problem has been character recognition (OCR)
for Yiddish.  If the problem has been solved for Hebrew, however, can't the
same be done for Yiddish?

Subject: "Pastorale"

I am looking for the text of a story called "Pastorale" by Blume Lempel.
The first line is "oktober iz far mir der groylikster khoydesh fun yor."
It's about a woman whose husband dies and who deals with the pain of her
widowhood in part by reading stories by I.B. Singer at an old age home.

Subject: petsha

A frage vegn petsha (petse), alias fusnoge/studen/galareta:

I'm curious in the first place about the terms.  Is "fusnoge," which in my
boyhood appeared as a synonym of "petsha," really the compound it seems to
be, of German and Russian words for "foot?"  What is the etymology of
"petsha?" And are "studen" and "galareta" full Russian and Polish
equivalents, respectively, of the petsha that some of us knew in our
childhood?  Google provides 50,000 entries for "galareta" (one of them,
curiously, in Japanese), which I suspect is most often made with pig's
feet.

About the preparation of petsha:  a neighbor will one day soon be dropping
off at my door a couple of cow's feet.  (Should I have specified rear or
front legs?)  I have boyhood memories of how my mother went about the work
of preparation, starting with the untreated leg, and I think I could
approximate her marvelous production.   But that was long ago, and I'd be
grateful now for any pointers.
