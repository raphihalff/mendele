   You may be right about your shul, but you are off the mark when it
   comes to yiddish among children, at least as far as girls are
   concerned. Since the 1960's there has been a tremendous increase
   of girls schools that use yiddish as the language of instruction
   (there are now 12 girls schools, within the jurisdiction of the
   ministry of education and another 8 at least that have no
   connection with the government at all, the kanoyim, who also teach
   in yiddish.)

   Also, more and more girls schools are offering yiddish as a second
   language in the schools in the haredi sector.  While you may hear
   hebrew on the street when these kids play, they still speak
   yiddish at home, it is the language of the most important
   institutions in their society: the home and the school.

Subject: Saying "please" in Yiddish

With all due respect to Joachim Neugroschel, who presumably is something
more than a 'self styled yidishist', he completely misses the point.

He complains about yidishistn who do not actually use yidish but then
ignores the needs of people who do want to use the language. While I
respect the grammar of yiddish and correct myself where I am aware of my
follies, I still would prefer to pass on to my sons a fluent yidish
while mixing up the di's, dos'es and der's than be a boki in all of
hilkhes yidish but not be able to communicate in yidish to those near
and dear to me. Of course, in a ideal world I would be able to do both
and it would be toyre igdile bemokoym eykhod but the way it is I am a
pragmatist and not a puritan.

As for his model sentence, I think many more yidish speakers would say
'er hot zikh geniben dos leyben' than 'er iz zelbst toyt bagangen'. And
as for his complaint of imperfect English, perhaps he would like to
revise his message and capitalise the first letters of sentences, move
and remove some of the commas and add an apostrophe where needed.

Mr Neugroschel keeps referring to the French language but even the French
with all their institutes have words like la brainstorming. To Mr
Neugroschel, yidish seems to be a museum shpowpiece which, in order to
preserve history, can never be tampered with. No wonder that to those
with similar views yidish does indeed have cobwebs all over it.

Now to the specifics: When my son says to my wife, to whom he speaks
English, 'I want a drink', my wife adds 'please', and he follows
'please' and he gets what he asked for. When he says to me, 'ikh vil a
trink', I can leave it at that and have an impolite child. On the other
hand I can make him rephrase his sentence, 'za azoy git in ge'mikh a
trink', and result equals pedant.

I can also say 'bite' which he will repeat and next thing I'll be asked
tsi ikh bin an oberlender. I stick to please and can proudly say that my
son speaks a lovely yidish and in my household borikh hashem yidish
rules O.K.!

Subject: Why Yiddish?

[Re Eitan Lallouz's post (Mendele 6.094):]

A short answer to the question "why Yiddish?", and a short definition of
modern and secular yiddishkeit - "in order to understand the role of
Yiddish in the shaping  of modern Jewish identity" can be found, as I
hope, in my article "Farvos take yidish?" ("and really,why Yiddish?") in
the monthly "Lebns-Fragn" Nr. 533-534 (Sept.-Oct. 1996).

The word Yiddishkeyt expresses the undeniable belonging to the Jewish
Nation, which is inherent to the very word (Yid - Yiddish -
Yiddishkeyt). Yiddish is therefore the real identity card of this
belonging.

You cannot say it in any other language! Yiddishkeyt is not Jewishness,
and not Yahaduth or Yehudiuth as in Hebrew, or Yahudischkeyt as in
German, Yewreystwo in Russian, Zydowstwo in Polish; this is allso not
Judaism,  and it can not be expressed by any other word, or in any other
language, but only in Yiddish, in this Yiddish word; and - Yiddishkeyt
is not necessarilly religious Jewishness.

Only in Yiddish you can express the secular global character of modern
Jewish identity.
