Subject: YV Interview: Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter on the Czernowitz
Conference

           Yiddish Voice Interviews Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter
               90 Years Since the Czernowitz Conference

The Yiddish Voice, a Yiddish-language weekly radio show, will
feature an
interview with Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter observing the 90th
anniversary of the
Czernowitz Conference on the Yiddish Language (1908).  The
Interview airs
during the program on Wednesday, December 23, at 7:30 p.m. on
WUNR 1600 AM
in Boston, Mass.

Dr. Schaechter is Senior Lecturer Emeritus in Yiddish Studies at
Columbia
University.  He is Executive Director of the League for Yiddish.  He is
Editor of "Afn Svhel" and "Yidishe Shprakh" (published by YIVO), and
is the
author of a number of studies, textbooks, and dictionaries in the
field of
Yiddish.

The Yiddish Language conference in Czernowitz in 1908 was one of
the major
events in the development of Jewish culture in the 20th century.  At
a time
when Yiddish was the main language of the majority of Jews, it was
the first
conference to consider achieving wider recognition of Yiddish as a
language,
Yiddish spelling, Yiddish grammar, and many related topics.  Since
that
time, the importance of the conference has been extensively studied
and
discussed, and the anniversary of the conference has been widely
observed,
in Yiddish cultural circles throughout the world. 

The Yiddish Voice, which began broadcasting in July, 1994, features
music,
poetry, comedy, interviews, news, commentary, and
announcements of current
events, all of it in the Yiddish language.

Subject: Happy Birthday Ben Gailing, 100 years old today (biz 120)!

[A belated announcement on this forum, but probably still of some 
interest. -mhd]

Today, the third day of Hanukkah, is Ben Gailing's 100th birthday.
Ben
Gailing is a Yiddish actor and writer, Cantor Emeritus of Temple
Beth
Abraham in Canton, MA, and the host of The Ben Gailing "Freylekher
Kabtsen" 
radio show, World's Longest Running Radio Show by Any One
Person in the
History of Radio. 

The Yiddish Voice pays tribute to Ben online at

http://www.yv.org/#gailing

The site now includes recordings in Real Audio of three full recent
broadcasts of the Ben Gailing show, as well as a warm and
informative
tribute by Boston-based writer and Yiddishist David Maisel. 

On tonight's radio broadcast we'll be celebrating both Ben and
Hanukkah,
with Hanukkah music, readings of Ben's work by Miriam Libenson,
music by
Ben, and greetings from various friends of his. 

The Ben Gailing show, now largely run by Hankus Netsky, is still on
the air,
in the 1/2 hour slot before the Yiddish Voice. 

Broadcasts:
  Ben Gailing Show: WUNR 1600 AM/Brookline, MA, Weds., 7:00
p.m.
  The Yiddish Voice: WUNR 1600 AM/Brookline, MA, Weds., 7:30

Subject: Standard and colloquial Yiddish

On Thursday, Dec. 10, Arthur Komar wrote:

"There seems to be some controversy lately about YIVO Yiddish vs.
dialects
vs. haredi argots, as if there is just one correct way for a living
language
to survive. Dead languages such as Latin or Classic Greek don't
have such
problems. Is that what we really want for a living Yiddish? Of course
a
living, cultured language should not only have a beautiful, classic
literature, but should have the possibility of evolving through
regionalisms, dialects and yes, even hodgepodge street argots.
Rather than
mourn the haredi Yinglish-Yiddish we should cheer it. It does not
detract
from the classic culture but rather proves that Yiddish, unlike Latin,
is a
living language and an evolving culture." 

I have two comments on this.  The first is that Latin and Ancient
Greek are
not all that monolithic either.  There are extensive differences
between,
say, Ciceronian Latin (the "standard"), the relatively uneducated
medieval
Latin of such writers as Jordanes and Saxo Grammaticus, Church
Latin, and
the polished neo-classical style of writers like Milton, to name just a
few
varieties.  And in the Greek world we have Platonic, Homeric, New
Testament
(itself written in koine, which was the popular Greek of its time, or if
you
will the Greek equivalent of Aramaic), Byzantine Greek, etc.  All
languages
go through changes, and written languages reflect these changes as
well as
spoken languages do. 

My second comment is that "pure" forms of languages, whether
canonized by
great writers capable of elevating their own dialects to a
quasi-national
status, as Dante's Tuscan has become today's standard Itaalian, or
by
organizations self-chartered for the purpose, like the Academic
Francaise,
have an important place in those languages' development but by no
means the
only place.  Anyone who has studied languages in school and then
traveled to
the countries (or local neighborhoods) where those languages are
spoken
realizes that the differences between standard varieties, as taught
and as
written in literature and in formal texts such as journal articles, and
the
locally spoken ones can form considerable barriers to
communication. 

Why should it be different with Yiddish?  Let YIVO do everything it
can to
standardize the language for the good of scholars and students while
recognizing that local forms have not gone away and will continue to
enrich
the language.  Yiddish, like English, picks up words everywhere its
speakers
go.  The infusion of English into American haredi Yiddish would be a
fine
study for a folklorist; I suspect someone must have done one by
now.  Also,
keep in mind that while the haredim may be isolated religious
communities
today, that does not mean they are incapable of producing a great
Yiddish
literature, now or in the future.

Subject: Prepositional phrases in haredi Yiddish

For those Mendelyaner who are tracking the ongoing evolution of
Yiddish
usage, here is some more grist for your mills:  We just received a
large-print children's book, "Der toyre-shier," compiled by an author
who
goes by the name Menakhem-Mendl (I believe that his surname is
Meshi-
Zahav).  The book was published in Jerusalem, 5758 [1997/98], and
the
title-page includes the following information:  "Fun _di_ serye 'In
likht
fun doyres'" [my emphasis]. 

Others have recently commented on the trend away from
declension (am I using
the correct term?) of the definite article (in the singular) in Yiddish
prepositional phrases used by haredim.  This example demonstrates
that the
trend is not restricted to areas where English is the dominant
language, but
is also encountered in Israel, where this book was printed and
where its
compiler lives. 

Nevertheless, one shouldn't over-generalize; within the text of this
book
usage is closer to standard -- though not entirely uniform, e.g.:  "er
hot
gezungen dem dozign berihmtn zemer fun _der_ hagode" (p. 117),
"[zey] zaynen
glaykh tsugegangen tsu ihm in _der_ mizrekh vand" (p. 201), "[er]
iz in ale
yohrn geven oysgemisht mit _di_ politsey" (p. 201), to take three
random
examples. (Granted, the last example is ambiguous, with "politsey"
possibly
being employed as a plural noun in this instance.  In my
transcription I
have followed the rather daytshmerish spelling -- mit nekudes --
found in
the book.)

[NOTE:  The YIVO Archives and Library have closed, in preparation
for the
Institute's move to the Center for Jewish History.  We expect to
re-open
in the late winter or early spring of 1999.]

From: Meyer Wolf <wolfim@idt.net>
Subject: Yiddish erotica

A. Joseph Ross finds the Weinreich dictionary prudish, for all that it
includes entries for penis, vagina and sexual intercourse. Apparently
what
he means is that it omits the Yiddish equivalents of "four=letter
Anglo-Saxon" words. Uriel Weinreich's motive was not prudery, but
rather the
recognition that the inclusion of "vulgarities" would ignore the
sensibilities of the audience to which the dictionary was addressed
and
therefore fail to fulfill the puposes for which he prepared his
dictionary. 

For Mr. Ross and others, I repeat Weinreich's reply to those who
asked about
such words: whoever wants a fairly complete list of Yiddish dirty
words can
find them in Stutchkoff. For those who may have difficulty in running
them
down, start by checking page 180, column right for the anatomical
terms for
the sexual organs. Section 597 'oysgelasnkeyt' provides the verbs
and some
proverbial material. 

Halevay meshiekh will come soon, so that those who take an
interest in
Yiddish will come to be as interested in the words reflecting the
spirit of
Jewish culture as in the vocabulary of bodily functions.

Subject: Rose Leis' autobiography in Yiddish on the Web

I am posting the Rose Leis story, a Yiddish autobiography on the
website,
http://www.sound.net/~bbecker. This is a labor of love, not for
profit. 
Rose Leis, 1987-1980, was my grandmother. She was born near
Minsk and
emigrated to New York after the pogroms in 1900. I make this book
available
for the enjoyment of all with the ability and desire to read it. Please
take
a look and share this with friends who would enjoy reading it. 

All I ask is feedback from those who read it.

Shalom,
Bob Becker

Subject: Nit Gedayget Lid

Within the last month or so, there was some discussion on MENDELE
about Camp
Nitgedayget. By chance, I came across the words and music to what
I presume
was the camp song. Called "Nit Gedayget Lid," it was published by
the I.W.O.
in 1932 in a songbook titled "Mit Gezang Tsum Kamf," a collection of
songs
compiled and arranged by Jacob Schaeffer. The lyrics to the song,
by B.
Fenster, are different from those by Perets Markish in the song with
a
similar title, "Nit Gedayget." 

Do any mendelyaner remember singing the song? Here are the
words:

In unzer kemp Nit Gedayget,
Zaynen mir ale yatn un khaveyrim,
Arbet un kamf hot farbridert,
Zorg un noyt hot unz bafraynt,
Kumen mir aher fun shtot un shap,
Hey, khaveyrim!
Zingen mir a lid un ot iz dos lid:
Nit gedayget,  nit gedayget,  nit gedayget........
