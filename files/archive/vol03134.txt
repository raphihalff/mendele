Subject: Forms of address

In traditional Yiddish society, one addressed a man politely using
'reb' plus first name. Is anyone aware of an equivalent polite way
of addressing a woman? Thanks.

1. ven/az es geyt a shney, fort er in arbet.
2. geyt es a shney, fort er in arbet. (to mean the same as 1)

3. afile ven/az es geyt a shney, fort er in arbet.
4. afile geyt es a shney, fort er in arbet. (to mean same as 3)

5. nor ven/az es geyt a shney, fort er in arbet.
6. nor geyt es a shney, fort er in arbet. (to mean same as 5)

(i don't care whether it's ven or az; take your pick.)

I should clarify.  I mean among modern Orthodox Jews.  True, that
doesn't exclude Litvaks.  Nevertheless, modern Orthodox do not
generally pronounce Yiddish words as they were uttered in the old
country.  (I cannot substantiate this right now, but I'll come back
from Thanksgiving break with enough good examples to satisfy the
greatest skeptic.)  Thus, I would have expected *oyf because it is
so common in this country.

Interestingly enough, I once asked a native Yiddish speaker, who was
originally from Vilna but had married a Poylisher, why she kept on
saying *oyf. She responded, "Oh, we did used to say 'uf'. When I met
my husband, I started saying 'oyf'".  Was *oyf taught in schools in
pre-war Poland?

Subject: The Anniversary Waltz

 	Sheldon Benjamin asks about the Jan Peerce version of "The
Anniversary Waltz."  It's included in a two-record set called "The
Yiddish Dream" (Vanguard VSD-715/16).  I haven't been able to
decipher the whole thing, but what it could get is as follows:

Kum, tants mit mir
undzer vals fun amol.
Gehat nor mit dir
hob ikh glik on a tsol.
Tsum ershtn mol
ven ikh hob dikh derzen,
geshpilt hot men dan
undzer vals azoy sheyn.

Tsvey yunge hertsn mir zaynen geven.
Libesgefil unshuldig un reyn.
Gedrikt hob ikh dikh azoy tsertlikh tsu mir,
zikh ayngelibt bald in dir.

Kh'hob dikh gevolt [...] aroys.
Gefayert dos khasene, glik azoy groys.
Gedenkstu di nakht, s'hot geshpilt di muzik,
dem zelbn vals fun glik.

Leyb [?] nokh di nakht,
Yene gliklikhe nakht,
freyd on a shir
far undz beyde gebrakht.
Khotsh zilber di hor
un di fis zaynen mid,
in harts klingt nokh alts
undzer lid, undzer vals.

	I'm no dialectologist, but Peerce seems to mix dialects and
German pronunciations.  I've normalized somewhat, which spoils
rhymes like sheyn/geveyn.

	The Yiddish text is by Chaim Tauber.  The original music was
for an instrumental piece called "Valurile Dunari" ("Waves of the
Danube") by the Romanian composer Ion Ivanovici, first published in
1880 in Bucharest.  The English text of "The Anniversary Waltz" was
written by Al Jolson and Saul Chaplin for "The Jolson Story" in
1943.
