Subject: Introduction

My name is William McAuliff. I am a christian (a goy) who has fallen in
love with G_d's chosen people, their languages, customs, and cuisine.
Since begining taking <The Jerusalem Post> a few years ago, I have
delighted in studying the rich heritage and wonderful literature of the
Jewish people.

My language studies thus far have dealt only with Hebrew, and then only
just enough to recognize letters and eak out a word or two. I am fairly
fluent in Spanish, so Ladino might not be so difficult. And then there is
Yiddish...

Please permit me to <lurk>,as it were,and feast on the conversation. If
there ever comes a time that it is appropriate for me to participate,then
I most assuredly will.

Shalom,

William McAuliff (Bill)

Subject: Yidish teatr

Dvorah Halperin Biasca inquires about Yiddish theatre with simultaneous
translation. It's been done often and I think is quite successful. My
Yiddish comprehension is just good enough that I don't need it, but my
wife enjoyed the English translation at the Ida Kaminska "Mirele Efros"
at the NYC City Center many years ago; we were able to take my mother.
The Folksbiene in NYC is doing Mirele Efros just now with simultaneous
translation. I hope to take it in.

We sometimes go to a Spanish language repertory theatre in NYC where my
wife can take advantage of her fluency in that language while I resort to
the available English translation. Very satisfactory.

Subject: Yiddish books sought

I've been looking for two Yiddish books, "Hintergasn" and "Di Goldene
Pave" both written by Iehoshue Perle in between-the-wars Poland. They are
the second and third parts of a semi-autobiographical trilogy, the first
part of which is "Yidn far a Gants Yor", which I do have. I've tried the
National Yiddish Book Center for the two books I'm seeking but they don't
have copies. Does anyone have or know of copies of these books anywhere?
I'd gladly pay any reasonable price for xeroxed copies. Even a lead on
non-circulating copies in a library somewhere would be appreciated.

Subject: Khoyzek

In regard to earlier discussions on transliteration of Yiddish:

I ask those who support transliteration of loshn koydesh as lashon
qadhosh what to do with the Yiddish khoyzek.  Here is a word of non
Semitic origin which popular writing convention in Yiddish spells like a
Hebrew word.  Are we to write this thoroughly non-Hebrew-Aramaic word as
h.ozeq?  What about amoratsim?  'am ha-aras.othim is totally absurd,
devoid of meaning and gramatically inconceivable in the Hebrew language.
How does one write gekholemt--ge-h.alom-t?  Are we going to transliterate
the ancient Greek words in Hebrew such as awir (air) and mistorin
(secret, mystery--Greek via Aramaic) according to Greek rules?  What
about the Yiddish "es shtinkt-- azan aver in der luft!"

How have issues of transliteration been resolved in Muslim languages,
written in Arabic script and containing a large corpus of vocabulary
imported from Arabic.  If I am not mistaken, Pharsi, eg. contains 25%
Arabic derived words spelled in the original Arabic letters with the same
spelling.  Thus it would seem to present a close parallel to Yiddish. How
is Pharsi transliterated?  What about Ottoman Turkish or Urdu?

Subject: Israel Ashendorf

I am looking for information on the Yiddish Writer Israel Ashendorf.  I
believe that he was living in Paris before World War II and then moved to
Argentina.  Does anyone have any information about his family or how to
find out who has the royalty rights to his books?

Subject: Fedder-Fraynt

Tayere Mendelniks:

The Fedder-Fraynt program is moving  along very nicely.  We now have
correspondants writing to each other [mostly in Yiddish script, a few in
transliteration]from places all over the Globe: Estonia, South Africa,
Italy, Israel, Austrailia, Latvia and Russia. A few have already made
firm friendships iwth their Fedder-Fraynt. I have four Fedder-Fraynt
myself and have enjoyed our "mail friend- ship very much.  In fact,
that's where I got the idea for our F-F project.  C'mon in - the water's
fine!

Avrom Yitzkhok Blair

Write to me personally - for this, E-Mail is OK.  For correspondence
use regular mail (mit Yiddishe oysyes, az men ken).

Subject: Re: "petschke" and other quasi-obscenities

The term "petschke" cited by a Mendelnik from MIT (Antschuldikt, I forgot
who said it) was translated as "chin". I don't know the source or
sources, but in my family the term was used to designate the male genital
or penis, but was recognized as a childish term like a "pee-pee. Now the
Russian word may have been related to Petsche (I think "stove" or even
Petschal or sadness) Perhaps the source is not Russian at all but some
sort of slavic or Polish "baby talk".

Thanks for all the comments about the sources of "hefker petrushke": the
idea that it is indeed parsley that belongs to no one,or that may be
taken by anyone seems very convincing. But that everything is upside down
or topsy turvy seems to me to refer to the Russian Punch and Judy shows.
The core idea of hefker in Yiddish, as in the Hebrew, suggests lack  of
protection, and abandonment to the fates.
