Subject: Rokhl Korn's a lid

Ikh zukh a lid, a libes lid, fun Rokhl Korn (my favorite Galitzianer
writer!) vu der tog iz azoy oysergevenlekh prakhtful az zi leygt es
arayn in a konvert un shikt es ir gelibtn. Un er, vi alemol, farshteyt
nit, un fregt farvos zi hot im geshikt a leydikn konvert....

I seek a poem by Rachel Korn about a day (like Millay's 'O world, I
cannot hold you close enough' ) so beautiful that she inserts it into an
envelope and sends it to her beloved. He, as always, doesn't understand,
and reprimands her for sending himn an empty envelope.

Subject: Max Weinreich's history of Yiddish

contrary to what barbara levin says about Max Weinreich's History of the
Yiddish Language [6.139], I would strongly advise her to get it.  YIVO
is in the process of reissuing the entire 4-volume set in english.
despite her qualms it's a fascinating book--certainly the most
interesting and informative history of Yiddish.  you may not find it
necessary to read all four volumes, but I would strongly advise any
serious yiddishist to read the first one and a half volumes.   the last
two volumes are mainly very extensive footnotes and bibliographical
references.

the first volume also contains a detailed survey of the various jewish
languages that have evolved during the past 25 centuries, and that alone
is worth the 30 dollar price tag.

i've read the first two volumes in yiddish four times over the course of
the  past few decades, and I wish I had time to reread them.

if you're just starting out in yiddish, you might as well read the
translation (which walks a fine line between clunky and clumsy).  I do
hope that you can eventually reread the book in yiddish (with eight
dictionaries at your side:  weinreich, harkavy, a hebrew dictionary, two
dictionaries of hebrew/aramaic borrowings in yiddish, a polish
dictionary, a russian dictionary, and a dictionary of quotations from
torah & talmud.....

max weinreich's history is a masterpiece on the level of the
nibelungenlied, mgm musicals (especially on the town & singin' in the
rain), and the taj mahal.

if you wish to get embroiled in an endless and perhaps futile
controversy, read paul wexler's _The Ashkenazi Jews_ .  It's the most
imaginative (!!!)  theory i've ever read (I'm not sure how valid it is,
but it certainly explains why I have green eyes and chestnut hair.

Subject: Jet-lag af yidish

I'll make a stab at Khane-Feygl Turtletaub's inquiry [6.138] on how to
say jet-lag in Yiddish.  How about dzhet-ophalt?  When you think about
it, though, even the English expression "jet lag" is not a very precise
description of what is taking place. There's not so much of a lag as
there is sleep deprivation due to the crossing of time zones.  So how
about dzhet farshlofenesh? Or perhaps dzhet shleferikayt.  Mayn
zeyde-bobe un mayne eltern had very little occasion to speak about jet
lag.  Having spent most of their late 19th early 20th yorhundert journey
in the ship's steerage section, they were no doubt afflicted with
shif-nit-gutkayt or, as Weinreich has it, yam krenk rather than
dzhet-ophalt.

Subject: Gegartn

In answer to Khane Faygle Turtletaub's query (6.139, 6) re: gegartn. It
is the past participle of garn used as an adjective. Garn means to
crave, to long for. In Sholem Aleichem's Dos Meserl we read: Keyn zakh
af der velt hob ikh azoy nit gegart tsu hobn, vi tsu hobn a meserl, an
eygn meserl. [Not a thing in this world did I so long to have as to have
a pen-knife, my very own.]

And so, gegartn eynem seems to mean: the longed for One.

Subject: Yidish un shpanish

In regard to Joachim Neugroschel's query [6.138] about the shame that
people living in Spanish-speaking countries don't contribute information
on mutual impacts between Spanish and Yiddish....

Shame? A shame is not to know the Yiddish word and transform Spanish
words into Yiddishisms. I understand linguists may be interested in
studding the roots of a word but this doesn't particularly improve the
Yiddish talking language.

My aunt from the states, used to say: mir veln zikh trefn in korner...
My aunt in Mexico said: mir veln zikh trefn in di eskine... korner...?,
eskine...?  in stead of "der rog"? Vikhtik, important is to use a
language correctly, at least for me and I suppose, to many, many
Mendelyaners, as well.

Why shouldn't I say, oyf yidish, zay-gezunt, even if, as Joachim says,
that af daytsh: "tschues" (funem shpanishn vort "adios")?  Good-bye, is,
and will be, prost un poshet: zay-gezunt (Weinreich Dictionary).

Ellen Prince [6.138] was very right with her posting: it is very well
for those of us interested in the linguistic aspects of Yiddish...yes, I
agree, for the linguists it is important.

Az Yidish zol vayter ekzistirn, darf men es banitzn vi a geredter
shprakh. Zoln di linguistn zikh farnemen mit zeyer bekovediker arbet, un
mir, di merhayt, lomir redn, shafn, oyslernen andere, leynen, un
shtudirn undzer shprakh un undzere yidishe oytzres.
