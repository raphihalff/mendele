Subject: Aphorisms

I have always felt that aphorisms are the distilled wit and wisdom of a
people.  My interest, as a Social Psychologist, is not whether such
gerneraliztion are true -- they are often wrong -- but in what they
reveal about the concerns and interests of people in everyday life.
Which brings me to the specific question:  Are there any books or
compendia of Yiddish aphorisms or adages.  I should add, that it would be
good if these were in English since my mama loshen is very rusty.

To clarify my question a little, let me add that I am not talking about
Biblical or Talmudic sayings; or the "wisdom of the Elders".  I'm more
concrned with the typical and topical adages of everyday life.  For
example, I remember an oft-quoted saying of my mother:  "Az men shikt a
kats for pitter (putter?) darf men essen triken brodt."  I would be
interested in derivations, variations, and exemplifications of such
adages or aphorisms.

Subject: Piptishklekh, gefonfet

Andrew Cassel hot geshriben in 247-9 di verter piptishklekh un gefonfet.

Gefonfet is the same as "gebrumt" or in English, "muttered in his beard".

The other word should be,I believe, piptshiklekh.  That would be "lots of
little dots". , The meaning would be a lotl of little nothings, or , in some
cases a group of little kids.

Subject: When Changing a Name is a "Zgule"...

"Sgule" is a Hebrew word, pronouncesd in Yiddish zgule, and means remedy,
solution.  I wish to speak today about several such "remedial" solutions.

There is a Hebrew saying "m'shane mokem, m'shane mazl" (when one changes
his place of residence where he had bad luck, his luck will also change).

Similarly, when a person is very ill and his imminent demise is feared,
there is an orthodox tradition to change his name (often to Khayim, which
means life, for a man; to Khaye, for a woman).  Then, when the
malkhamoves, the Angel of Death, checks his "calling" papers before
knocking on the door (very polite, he), and says:  "I came here for
so-and-so (name)," he is told: "Sorry, there is no one here by this name,
we have ---" (and he is told the *new* name.

In a recent posting (4.224, p. 2) I mentioned the censorship of
newspapers in Lithuania in the early and middle 1930's.  Herewith some
interesting details:

On March 2, 1930, the daily Yiddish newspaper *Folksblat,* with which I
later became associated as co-editor, was closed by the censors for ten
days for some transgression against the regime.

Since the order to close the paper referred by name solely to the
_Folksblat_, it was legalistically interpreted to mean that it can be
published by any *other* name.  The publisher, di yidishe bildungs
gezelshaft in lite (The Jewish Education Society in Lithuania) therefore
continued to issue the paper each day under a *different* name, by the
simple device of adding different adjectives to its name:  Thus on March
3, 1930, the very day after the closing order, the closed  _Folksblat_
became consecutively "idisher folksblat," "undzer folksblat,"  "kovner
Folksblat,"  umophengiker, morgn, ekhter, umparteyisher, algemeyner,
emeser, and, finally, "oyfrikhtiker Folksblat," a total of ten "new"
names.

On July 1934 the _Folksblat_ was closed again, this time for a period of
three months.  But the paper continued to be published, as before, under
"different" names, one week, for example, it carried the name of the day,
thus:  erev-shabes blat, zuntik-blat, montik-, dinstik-, mitvokh-,
donershtik-, fraytik-, and some other names "fun der haftoyre un fun der
khad-gadye" (fictitious, unusual names). *)

As we all know, censorship did not help tyrants and dictators to stay in
power, and it too was, from a historical point of view, no more than a
wishful _zgule_.
