How about "petzele"? As in, "A leben af don petzele." I assume it is
the affectionate dimunitive of putz.

Subject: Sholem Aleichem in America

Noyekh asked some time ago about an American version of Sholem
Aleichem's story "Vos iz khaneke?"  Khone Shmeruk mentions it in his
paper "Sholem Aleichem and America" in the latest volume of _YIVO
Annual_ (vol. 20, 1991).  In fn. 34 (p. 237) he gives the title as
"Khaneke in der finfter evenyu:  a bild der yidisher 'hay layf' in
Nyu-york" and indicates that it was published in _Yidishes
tageblat_, 2-3 December 1907.  Shmeruk doesn't mention any other
publication of the story.  Can any of our literature- and/or
bibliography-mumkhim help?

Subject: Litvish grammar; rhymes

1. Peretz Mett: Further to the question of Litvish Yiddish grammar.
I wonder if you've been assyuming that the grammar of Standard
Yiddish is essentially Litvish. Not so! Standard Yiddish is an
amalgam of essentially Litvish Yiddish phonology and Southeastern
Yiddish grammar. Strange, but true.

2. Tom Leverett: I'm trying to guess your family's origins but the
evidence is contradictory. Here's a possible reconstruction:

Shmid, shmid, shmid
Nem dem hamer mit (1)
Ven du vilst dos (2) ferd bashukhn
Must dem hamer mit zikh (3) trogn

(1) The vowels of "shmid" and "mit" make a perfect rhyme only in the
Litvish area; the final consonants only in the Polish area.

(2) Neuter gender "dos ferd" is non-Litvish.

(3) Your transcription "mitchik" suggests Litvish "mit zhikh"
(i.e. "zikh").

So, what's the story?

Subject: re taytshn

Isnt what I am hearing, to work, to be of use, to be availing? Es
teugt nit, my father would say, when was saying, It's no use, it
wont work, it doesnt go, such as flogging a dead horse to make him
get up and go.  I always heard the 'g' i n it. It could have been
toyt nit, perhaps. But he was from Bessarabia.  That was the sound
one heard on the radio in the 1930s, which was the Yiddish I heard .

Subject: Yiddish Children's Literature

In response to Barbara Sicherman's question, "Was there a children's
lit in Yiddish, ca. 1900, in US or Russia?" (MENDELE 3.191), I would
like to refer her and others interested in the subject to the
following article by Dina Abramowicz -- YIVO's long-time reference
librarian and my predecessor as head librarian:  "Yiddish Juvenilia:
Ethnic Survival in the New World," in "Wilson Library Bulletin,"
vol. 50, no. 2 (October 1975), pp. 138-145.  "The beginning of
children's literature in Yiddish," writes Miss Abramowicz, is the
Sholem Aleichem story, "Dos meserl," first published in 1888. Other
S.A. stories about (and to a degree, for) children were collected in
vols. 7-8 of his works as "Mayses far yidishe kinder."

"Stories about Jewish children were also written by other great
writers of the pre-World War I era, and there was also poetry, which
could be adapted for juvenile readers," states Miss Abramowicz. "But
as a contemporary observer noted, it was rather 'literature about
children than for children'."  (The reference is to the article
"Kinder-literatur," by the Yiddish literary critic Sh. Niger [Shmuel
Tsharni/Samuel Charney], in "Di yudishe velt," no. 9 [Sept. 1913],
pp. 143-146.)

As Miss Abramowicz notes, "Literature for children as a special
genre began to develop with the first attempts to create Yiddish
schools, around 1911-1912," citing such chrestomathies as Jacob
Fichman's "Far shul un folk" (Warsaw:  1913).   The heyday of
Yiddish children's literature comes after World War I, and the role
of Yiddish(ist) school systems in disseminating and popularizing
this genre cannot be understated.  This holds for Poland, the Soviet
Union, Argentina, the U.S., and Canada.  "The first Yiddish
juveniles on American soil appeared in 1913 and were related to the
Yiddish secular school movement," notes Miss Abramowicz, citing
Yosl/Joseph Mlotek's article, "Di yidishe kinder-literatur in di
Fareynikte Shtatn," in vol. 5 in the series "Yidn" of the "Algemeyne
entsiklopedye" (New York:  1957), pp. 220-224.  Another relevant
citation is Kh. Sh. Kazhdan/Hayyim Solomon Kazdan's article, "Finf
-un-draysik yor yidishe kinder literatur," in "Shulpinkes" (Chicago:
1946), pp. 335-379.

Now I would like to draw MENDELnikes' attention to a collection of
over 1,000 Yiddish children's books that have been preserved by YIVO
on microfiche.  A guide to the collection, "Yiddish Children's
Literature from the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research," selection
by Dina Abramowicz [and] Stanley Bergman, was published by Clear-
water Publishing Company (NY), in 1988, and includes a brief intro-
duction by Miss Abramowicz.  A more detailed catalog, bearing the
same title, was prepared by Tammy Shemer and published by the
Harvard University Library (Cambridge, MA:  1990).  The original
catalog and the project on which it was based have (loy aleykhem)
been severely criticized by Khone/Chone Shmeruk, in the latest issue
of the Israeli national bibliography, "Kiryat sefer" (vol. 64, no.
1, 1992-1993; pp. 327-329).  Prof. Shmeruk's criticisms are directed
at the collection's exclusive reliance on a single library's (i.e.,
YIVO's) holdings, on the selection criteria adopted for the project
(why were certain titles included, and others excluded from the
project?), and on the inadequacies of the Clearwater finding aid
(which, he concedes, have largely been addressed by the published
Harvard catalog).  In defense of the project directors, I would like
to state for the record that "Yiddish Children's Literature" was
conceived of as a library preservation project primarily, and only
secondarily as an effort to provide bibliographical coverage of a
neglected field.  The funding source (New York State Education
Dept.) precluded reliance on out-of-state libraries and in any case
intended its support to go toward microfilming of the maximum number
of books possible within a very limited time frame (one year).
Although I claim no responsibi- lity for the results of the project
(I came on board as it was winding up), and will certainly grant
some of Prof. Shmeruk's criticisms -- particularly as they touch
upon the Clearwater finding aid's quality -- I am more than
satisfied that the taxpayers of the State of New York got plenty of
bang for their buck, and that as a consequence future researchers in
the field of Yiddish children's literature not only have secured
their access to a very large proportion of the overall corpus but
now have the bibliographical foundations to enhance the already
considerable achievements of Miss Abramowicz and Mr. Bergman in
preserving these materials.

That last paragraph is aimed especially at avid readers of Prof.
Shmeruk's review in "Kiryat sefer."

Zachary Baker, YIVO Library
