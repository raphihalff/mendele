Well, you asked.  There are stacks of regional synonyms for
"Marieenkaefer", and I bet the list below isn't complete by far:

Mariechenkaefer
Siebenpunkt
Brautwuermchen
Flimmflaemmchen
Gottesgiebchen
Himmelskindchen
Himmelswuermchen
Johanniskaefer
Maivoegelchen
Martisvoegeli
Sonnenkindchen
Unser lieben Frauen Gueegli
Putthuehnchen
Muferkuebchen
Mohkuehchen
Sommerkaelbche
Motchekaelbchen
Herrgottspferdchen

All except three are diminuitives.  At least six relate to religious
concepts (Maria, Herrgott, Himmel).  Interestingly, the somewhat
surprising description of the little insect as a horse or cow in Yiddish
shows up here too; I put those four examples last.

It is tempting to speculate that "Kuebchen" in "Muferkuebchen" is related
to "Kaefer" (bug), whence "Kuehchen" (little cow) via folk etymology.
However, the etymology of "Kaefer" doesn't seem to support this.

Subject: Ladybug

My mother, who comes from Lodz Poland assures me that in Lodz the word
for ladybug was shneider-vantz. A vantz is a bedbug and a shneider is a
tailor, but why the two came together is anybody's guess. It was most
commonly known by its diminutive "shnayder-ventsl." I wonder if anyone
else has heard of this term?

Subject: Meyshe Rabeinu redux

THe recent discussion  re Meyshe Rabeinu's ki'ele brings back to mind the
several occasions on which, as a fourteen year-old delivery boy in my
uncle's Bronx grocery store, I was dubbed  "Meyshe Rabeinu's arbeiter".
While the exact meaning of the expression was never clear to me, the
circumstances under which and the tone with which it was uttered made it
apparent that it was not a compliment but rather a reflection on my lack
of diligence. As I recall, I much preferred sticking my nose into a book
between deliveries to assisting my uncle with the shelving of groceries.
I would be grateful for any information concerning the meaning and origin
of the above epithet.

Subject: Yiddish on cd-rom

Among the enormous advantages of having Yiddish literature on cd-rom is
the ease and rapidity of finding what you seek as long as spelling is
correct.

I expect that romanization will be used for sending computer text in
Yiddish via E-mail, etc. for the foreseeable future.  In light of this,
some thoughts occur:

Like many of us on Mendele, I don't understand some Yiddish words.  At
those times I ardently wish for a comprehensive dictionary (_romanized
Yiddish_ to _Hebrew character Yiddish_ to _English equivalent_ and vice
versa).  That is certainly possible on cd-rom, one file, quickly
searched.  This suggests an absolute need for a standardized method of
romanization (or transcription or transliteration).

In turn, this brings to mind the discussion on Mendele (months ago), led
by Zellig Bach and others, urging use of standard romanization on
Mendele.  Some resented the advice.  However, the exciting prospect of a
romanized Yiddish dictionary on cd-rom surely supports the stance of
those arguing for learning a strict standard.  I think it is the wave of
the future.  We can surf that wave and enjoy!
