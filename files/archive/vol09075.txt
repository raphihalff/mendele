Subject: Dina Abramowicz (1909-2000)

With the passing of Dina Abramowicz, who died in New York City on Monday,
April 3rd, we have lost one of our last vital links to Eastern European
Jewish civilization.  In her capacity as librarian of the YIVO Institute for
Jewish Research (where she worked for over half a century) Dina would have
disapproved being described as a symbol of Eastern European Jewry, though
those who came in contact with her often regarded her as such.  Symbols tend
to be static, and there was nothing static about Dina's probing curiosity or
her desire to learn new things, to be au courant with current events or the
newest books to cross her desk.

Tenacity, energy, strength, and above all dedication -- these are the main
characteristics that marked Dina Abramowicz's personality.  She was
dedicated to her work, to the public that she served, to the legacy of
Vilna, and to the memory of her father, Hirsz Abramowicz.  Dina was also
blessed with a phenomenal memory, which she was always able to plumb for
elusive facts and helpful research strategies.  In addition, she was a
polyglot, with native or near-native fluency in Russian, Yiddish, and
Polish, and with a superb knowledge of English (which she learned as an
adult).

Dina Abramowicz was a true product of the Haskalah, raised in a
Russian-speaking home, educated in a Yiddish gymnasium and a Polish
university -- life experiences that could hardly be replicated elsewhere
than in her native Vilna during the first few decades of the 20th century.  
Perhaps it was the cross-cultural and multilingual environment that was her
birthright that made her so open to the world at large.  Her chosen
profession, that of librarian, provided the ideal outlet for the development
of her intellectual interests and her desire to educate the public.

She endured the traumas of Nazi occupation, and for a time was protected
from the fate suffered by tens of thousands of Vilna Jews in 1941 by serving
as a staff member of the Vilna Ghetto Library (which was led by Herman
Kruk).  She found refuge with Jewish partisans in the forests surrounding
Vilna, and that enabled her to survive until liberation by the Soviet army,
in 1944.

In 1946, Dina was reunited with her father, an educator and journalist who
was visiting the United States when war broke out in 1939.  Her association
with YIVO began in 1947, and continued until the very end.  (One of her YIVO
Library volunteers, Elaine Adamenko, was with her when she died.)  During
the decades that she worked at YIVO she oversaw the acquisition and
absorption of major collections (including pre-war holdings from Vilna that
were restored to YIVO shortly after World War II), participated in ambitious
Holocaust documentation projects, assisted thousands of readers (in person,
by phone, fax and mail), compiled bibliographies, and published numerous
articles in scholarly and more general-interest journals.

Dina Abramowicz was not one to call attention to her achievements.  Once,
when the idea of a festschrift was broached, she strongly objected because
of the implication (in her mind) that its publication might signify that she
had reached the end of her productive life.  The premise of her protest
indicated a fierce pride in her work, combined with a strong sense of
personal privacy and a determination not to permit her name to become grist
for anyone's mill (including her own).  In later years she began to open up
a bit, and both spoke and wrote about her experiences before and during
World War II, most memorably at the 1998 convention of the Association of
Jewish Libraries, in Philadelphia.  Her lecture about the Vilna Ghetto
library, "Guardians of a Tragic Heritage:  Reminiscences and Observations of
an Eyewitness," was published in the Association's proceedings and also
issued as a separate publication by the National Foundation for Jewish
Culture.

By and large, though, in her autobiographical writing Dina elected to focus
on others rather than on herself.  This was reflected in her touching
memoir, "The World of My Parents," published in vol. 23 of the YIVO Annual
(1996), and above all in the English translation of her father's book
"Portraits of a Vanished World" (originally published in Yiddish as
"Farshvundene geshtaltn"), which was published in 1999 by Wayne State
University Press.  In her later years, all of her energies were concentrated
on getting that literary monument to her father's memory published, and she
was profoundly grateful when it finally did come out.

If Dina's home was YIVO, she was also involved in other activities.  She was
belonged to a Workmen's Circle branch, and participated in the deliberations
of that unique hometown organization, Nusakh Vilne.  Dina attended plays,
the opera, and films, and she read The New York Times with great scrutiny.  
During the years when YIVO was still located on Fifth Avenue she could often
be spotted walking across Central Park, on her way home or to work.  In
short, she had become a genuine New Yorker.

All who knew Dina Abramowicz will doubtless realize that these hastily
written thoughts barely scratch the surface of this complex and amazing
individual.  We will all miss her.

Permit me to add my name to the mourners of the passing of Dina Abramowicz.
She was a most devoted person to Yiddish culture and to the serious study of
the culture. She was also a source of wit and urbanity and those who
remember the old YIVO where she talked on the phone in Russian, ate her
yogurt, shouted down to bring up the right book in Yiddish and managed to
jump about all over the place knowing exactly what source contained the
information needed and provided with all the best good will in the world
will not forget this gallant lady!

It is with great sadness that I report the death today of a great Litvak,
Dina Abramowicz, who served as Head Librarian and Research Librarian at the
YIVO Institute for Jewish Research.

Many Litvak SIG researchers benefited from Dina's knowledge and her love of
Vilna.

I had heard about Dina Abramowicz long before I met her. Reading books on
various Yiddish and Eastern European Jewish history subjects written in the
last fourty years, it was hard not to notice an interesting pattern. Books
on different topics by different authors (among them Joshua Fishman, Ken
Frieden, Emanuel Goldsmith, Janet Hadda, Dan Miron, Ruth Wisse, and many
others) contained acknowledgments sections with thanks to different people.
Only one name in all these acknowledgments was what mathematicians call
an 'invariant' - the name of Dina Abramowicz. Future historians of Yiddish
scholarship in the twentieth century will certainly ask: how this lady
has become an institution in the field of Yiddish studies.

When I came to the YIVO Library several years ago, it did not take me a long
time to understand the answer. Dina Abramowicz possessed a combination of
unique talents and magnetic personality that is hard to match. While talking
with her, it was difficult not to think about the librarians from the pages
of Borges or Umberto Eco, the selfless and tireless guardians of our most
precious and most fragile treasures. Dina Abramowicz was a phenomenal guide
to Yiddish resourses and an invaluable resourse herself. Quite often I felt
sorry that I don't live in New York and cannot just walk into the library
and ask her for help. So I collected the questions to ask them on my next
visit...

My questions will remain unanswered. An epoch has ended.
