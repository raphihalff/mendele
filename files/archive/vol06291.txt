Subject: Stempeniu in English: addendum

My own translation, which renders the klezmer slang into slightly
delapidated rock 'n roll lingo, is still available in my collection
"The Shtetl" which is still in print, both hard and paper, at Overlook
Press, New York.

Subject: Etl-betl

I have been teaching my daughter to play etl-betl, which is, I
believe, the Yiddish name for "cat's cradle."  As she has become more
adept at the two-person string/hand game, she has begun to name the
various positions that one can get into.  That's roughly 8 different
geometric shapes that can arise as the string passes from one pair of
hands to the other.  The names she chooses are invented as I do not
know of any standard naming convention for the various shapes.

The most complex position (both to get into and to get out of) she has
named "the spider."  Other positions have other names, of course. One
is called "the bridge" and another "coffee table."

Then it dawned on me that, as much as I played this game as a child, I
can't remember any Yiddish names given to the various positions. Maybe
there weren't any and my daughter is creating a new direction,
etl-betl wise, but am I correct in my recollection that the geometric
shapes achieved again and again in the course of the game did not have
specific Yiddish names associated with them?   Or if they did, I would
love to know what they were.

The problem is, of course, that one has to get into the positions to
describe them.  I can't think of a way to word-describe the hand
position/string geometry for each of the various shapes.  Some use
only the thumb and pointer finger.  Others use the back side of the
palm only.  And really complicated ones use three or more fingers on
each hand, with each one pointed in some weird direction.

And was etl-betl a game of the ghetto or did everyone, Jew and Gentile
alike, play the game in eastern Europe?  Are there any etl-betl
historians on Mendele?  Does Sholem Aleichem mention the game being
played?  Does anyone?  Is there an etl-betl olympics, open and
free-style?  Am I spelling the transliteration of etl-betl correctly?

Subject: A Yiddish transcription guide

Concerning David Lidsky's posting (6.285), who wrote: "People vary in
the system of transcription which they use and this sometimes leads to
difficulties...." I would like to ask if we could all in Mendele,
follow one transcription-form only?

I myself have done a transcription-guide that I suggest to the
beginners-level in my Yiddisher _Briv-Fraynd_ Club which I am not so
sure if it is the correct one, (as I really do not know much about the
English-phonetics), but with the idea of having all one similar way of
writing.

Could some Mendelyaners help or could our Mendele Online Mashgiakh,
Noyekh Miller, direct us on the right transcription-form to be used?
This is my own transcription-guide:

Write "kh" for words like: ikh(I), bukh, khokhem(smart,inteligent
person).

Use the "y" (like in: Yiddish), to be sure that it sounds
like in "yid-yidn, shpyl,shyikhn,...".

Use the "h" at the end when you want to be sure that it sounds
"eh" (like the Yiddish letter "ayen" like in: Moysheh, meydeleh) and
also use the "h" with "a" when you need the sound "ah" (the "alef"
that as to sound a as in cat: mahyn, dahyn(yours)...

These are some basics to start with. How correct is this? I could not
tell! I have asked for the Yivo rules for transcription but nobody
replied. What do Mendelyaner think?

Subject: Sabbath Prayer from "Fiddler" in Yiddish

In response to Sloyme-Khayim Cohen's request [6.290] for the Yiddish
lyrics of the chorus number "Sabbath Prayer" from _Fiddler on the
Roof_, I have an old LP recording of an all Yiddish production of the
show from Israel.  I found the "Sabbath Prayer" spot on the recording
and played it several times while trying to copy the words.  It's not
easy to hear the exact words that choruses sing, but here are the
opening lines (with apologies to Shraga Friedman, the Yiddish lyricist
for words that I may have misheard):

Tate ziser got fun Avrohom,
Kumen zol moshiakh shoyn snel.
Mayles vart oyf im,
Dos gantse folk fun Yisroel,
Sore, Rivke, Rokhl un Leye
Bentsht di kinder ley oy meyad.
Gotenyu mayn got
Farhit zey fun dem fremd un shmad!

This is followed by some interplay of singing between baritone solo
and chorus which I found too difficult to hear and transcribe.  I
should hasten to point out that it may be necessary to get permission
to use this material for concert performances.

Subject: Patty-cake in Yiddish

As my now 30- and 40-something daughters will attest, the words their
bobe taught them, being archaic, are somewhat sexist and go as
follows:

patche, patche kikhelekh.
der tate't koyfn shikhelekh,
di mame't shtrikn zekelekh,
a gezunt in dem kind's bekelekh.

(The possessive of the child's name is often substituted for "dem kind's")

It has more of a sing-song chant than a melody. I'm sure some
musically gifted Mendelist can provide it.

BTW, in connection with the syntax in Shloyme-Khayim Cohen's query
(V.6.290), can one of our grammarians explain the rules that govern
the use of _er shraybt_ and _shraybt er_?

Subject: Patty-cake in Yiddish

di verter far di gezang far kleyner kinder gayt azoy:

Patche, patche kikhelakh
der tate vet koifen shikhelakh
di mame vet shtricken zekelakh
far di maydele ( der yingele) mit sheyne, roite bekelakh!

Patchee patchee little toes..or feet
papa will buy shoes
mama will knit socks
for the little girl (boy) with lovely red cheeks.

Chant all the words on two tones while gently clapping both of baby's
feet together as baby lies on back or is reclining or sitting.. As you
get near the end of the chant on two notes, hurry up the last line of
words so the baby giggles as you hurry the clapping of feet together..
Many times, a grandbabe has waved fiselakh vigorously as if
imperiously to ask for more patche patche kikhelakh.. babies love this
game. sometimes to make the last line even more rushed, i might try to
crowd in an extra word and chant: far di maydele mit kleyne, sheyne,
royte bekelekh!
