Subject: Yiddish clubs, teachers, & Klezmer groups

Zellig Bach in M 4.092 made an excellent case for naming all Yiddish
clubs "oyneg Yiddish". His recommendation is well-taken. The status of
"Yiddish groups" in the States is quite varied. In size they run the
gamut from a half dozen (this appears to be the critical mass) to over
500 in retirement communities in NJ and FL.

At the present there are 269 Yiddish groups in the States. This includes
those which call themselves by CLUB, VINKL, LEYENKRAYZ, SOCIETY, GROUP,
etc. Any change requires majority consensus and, of course, each group is
autonomous. They run the gamut from those meeting weekly to once a month.
Some use only transliteration (transcription) for no one can read Yiddish
with the Hebrew letters. Some are sing-a-longs with a pot-luck supper on
a Sunday afternoon.

Many Yiddish groups are led by a Yiddish teacher, and a few are a cross
between a class and a club. Many are strongly social and get together to
be entertained and reminded of their childhood.

This leads to the number of Yiddish teachers available in the States.
There are 341 listed in the "der bay's" database. This does not include
those in the Chassidic communities. While there are obviously some
unlisted, a projection shows well under 500. and closer to 400.

A definition of who is a Yiddish teacher proves controversial. The
definition used here is anyone who has verifiably ever taught a Yiddish
class--some do not even know the Hebrew Alphabet. Yiddish teachers are
truly an endangered species!

Klezmer groups number 134 in the States. One problem arose when 5
musicians playing together said they have 5 different groups--each with a
different name. The name of the band was that of the musician who booked
the gig. :-))

Subject: Oyneg Yiddish'n

To: Zellig Bach

I guess you would have to count my vote as a "no."  We are a Yiddish
vinkl here in Boulder, and Oyneg doesn't capture the spirit of our group
at all.  Many of our mitglider have no connection to a Shul/Temple and it
is the Vinkl that has livened up their connection to Yidishkeit.

My guess (perhaps wrong) is that you'll hear from other groups who all
prefer their own names.  A name is such a personal thing, after all!

I would hesitate to call the leyenkreyzn "vinklen" for similar reasons.

Here is some information about our vinkl:  We have 20-30 members, and
meet once a month.    We do not conduct our meetings all in Yiddish.  Our
activities are a mixture of Yiddish reading (it has to be transliterated
for many mitglider), we sing a little, and shmooz a bisl.  The format
varies.  We have also shown Yiddish films.  Our second year has just
begun.

Subject: More about translations' importance

Eventually, this is going to be a plea for more English translations and
for translations mit tam (flavorful), mit gefil (no English equivalent,
feelingful, to coin a word).

Most Jews don't believe in miracles, but all Jews rely on them. I'm now
taking advantage of a modern miracle. This internet connection among the
sparse population of Yiddishists qualifies as miraculous. Ask anyone over
sixty, maybe younger.

Most young Jews are losing whatever tenuous connection they still have
with Yiddish language and literature and, therefore, with the culture. A
major side effect is loss of American Jews' connection with Jewish
history. This loss is especially conspicuous in Southern California where
if you mention 1648 or Khmielnistki or the cantonment system of military
recruitment or Simon Dubnov or Jacob Brafman, a definitive illustration
of a blank stare will confront you. Most American Jews know little or
nothing about 1) their genetic and cultural roots, 2) the epic saga of
Eastern European Jewish survival against odds, 3) the great migration to
America which made so much else possible, and 4) the many decisive
contributions of these Ashkenazic, Yiddish- speaking Jews (including
settling Palestine, fighting with mind and muscle to establish the state
of Israel, reviving Hebrew as a living language, and the like).

The yawning mind-gap produces a heart-gap. They often feel no connection.
Loss of the past causes loss of the present.  All this begs a question
that I assume is important to everyone on Mendele: "Would better
knowledge of Yiddish language, literature and history maintain into the
next centuries an emotional connection with those values identified with
Jews and Jewishness?"  Maybe. In any case, we need to bridge the gap.
How?

There are problems. Among those who claim to be interested in Yiddish,
few will tolerate even a little of the considerable effort it takes for
initial penetration into Yiddish. This is my experience with a small
sample. Engish translations may provide a bridge, but they must be mit
tam, and mit gefil. Translation may be a necessary but not sufficient
tool to mine our rightful legacy of treasures contained in Askenazic
culture. Nobody owns a culture so I would include non-Jews as entitled to
claim that legacy. Still, the original Yiddish is the key that opens the
way to the soul of the culture.

Not only has there been an uphill struggle in the non-Jewish diaspora,
but even in Israel, Yiddish has suffered for years, and so the gap has
widened. The Israelis' destructive opposition to Yiddish was justified as
necessary to force a Hebrew revival. Stuff and nonsense! It was obviously
misguided seeing that Yiddish-speakers were among leaders who revived
Hebrew. Sholem Aleichem once said, "Hebrew and Yiddish co-exist within
me in perfect peace and harmony; they don't tear at each other."  For
thousands of years, Jews have handled at least two, often three
languages. The assumption that Israelis could not handle both Yiddish and
Hebrew underestimated human capabilities. In recent times there are signs
of an Israeli Yiddish revival. Perhaps our Israeli subscribers can bring
us up to date.

The upshot of this communication is obviously an encouragement to us
translators. To the younger subscribers: read the history, learn Yiddish,
read Yiddish, speak Yiddish, get the feeling, and translate, too. As an
ancient rabbi said, "You are under no obligation to complete the task,
but you have no right to abstain from it." Join the task! Abi gezunt!
