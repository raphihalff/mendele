Subject: Bob King's posting on the origins of ashkenazim

Bob King has sounded what in my view is a regrettable note [although
understandable] in his posting telling of his work on the origins of
ashkenazic jewry. in his final paragraph, he bemoans the fate of
those who are foolish enough to set forth their ideas on mendele.

while it is true that there are some argumentative souls on mendele
who seem to relish a good fight, the majority of us mostly lurk and,
speaking for myself, appreciate being educated a bit on the various
topics broached on the list. i hope bob king and other would-be
contributors will keep the silent majority in mind in deciding about
making contributions to the list. i, for one, would have been very
happy to see some elaboration of the theory outlined in bob king's
posting.

Subject: Michael Wex on Boston Yiddish Hour

An interview with Michael Wex will be heard on The Yiddish Hour on
Sunday, February 20.  Wex discusses his recently published novel,
_Schlepping the Exile_ (Mosaic Press, Oakville, Ontario, 1993),
which, according to its jacket notes, is "an inside portrait of
orthodox, post-Holocaust Judaism in a place that it never expected
to be". Michael Wex was born in Lethridge, Alberta, in 1954. In
addition to writing and teaching Yiddish, he is a Chaucerian
scholar, and, according to his books jacket notes, "a well-known
member of the international Yiddish avant-garde".  Highlights of the
interview include a reading from the novel (in English), as well as
a definition of the "Yiddish avant-garde".  The Yiddish Hour is
heard every Sunday, from 6 to 7 P.M. on Waltham/Brandeis radio
station WBRS 100.1 FM. Mark David is host and producer.

For further information, contact the producer of The Yiddish Hour,
Mark David, by mail at WBRS, Brandeis University, 415 South Street,
Waltham, MA 02254, or by telephone at (617) 738-1870.

Subject: Yiddish source for Russ slang?

I have a question.  New hip Russian slang borrows heavily from
"blatnoy yazyk"--criminal cant, and I was recently told about a new
word from this layer "shukher", meaning "look-out", i.e., someone
who gives warning about the arrival of police...  Apparently it was
originally what that person said, i.e., "beat it, the cops!"  Sure
looks yiddish to me.  Any ideas?

Subject : Jewish Diseases

I heard that hemmoroids is a Jewish Disease. That is why the Yiddish
name is " meer-yiden."

Subject: re loose language, mine

I regret that I wrote so fast I wrote loosely.  Of course, I alluded
to Tay-Sachs not because it is a "jewish" disease, but is
associated as being of higher frequency among the East European
Jewish genetic population, which is why nowadays pregnant Jewish
women do well, or are advised so to do, to have amniocentesis early
on.

As for the Mencken: It was GBS who says in a play that his ancestors
were civilized (Ceasar and Cleopatra?) when the British were
painting themselves blue with woad.  HLM picked it from GBS and
gave it a spin.

As for Celts, Toynbee speaks of their Volkerwanderung Eastwards
about 2500 BC, and that is why Paul addressed Gauls in his Galatians
epistles.  NO reason why Khazars shouldnt be redheads, if they were
the most eastern wing of that ancient migration.

And thanks to Shimshoni for giving me back Konya, which blockage I
always refer to as a brief doorbell ringing from Uncle Al
(zheimer).  I keep the door shut as hard as I can.  I believe Polo
was there on his way East, and Rumi was flourishing. I could check
the dates, but wont until I am rich enough to get the Brittanica
on line or in CDs, but havent not yet bought the CD for OED, which
I yearn for, but which is just out at 900_$ Discount is available
by the way for profs, if we can get 10 or 20 together to buy 10
or 20.  I would gladly force that though the UCLA bookstore, if 19
of you all would send me the monies...About 10% or a bit more, I
gather.  Any takers?  Or do I have wait for the lottery?
