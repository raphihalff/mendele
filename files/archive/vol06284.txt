Subject: Peretz's "Dray Matones"

In response to Ruth Fisher Goodman's query [6.283], the three gifts of
Peretz's story are:

1. a bloody speck of Palestinian earth,
2. a blood-stained pin from the the dying girl's leg,
3. a bloody yarmulke.

Subject: Peretz's "Dray Matones"

In Peretz's story, the little soul bribes the "oyfgekumene" tsadikim
on high with three pieces of Kiddush HaShem: a bloody piece of a bag
that contains erets-yisroel earth, which a Jew gives his life to
protect; a bloody pin with which a young Jewish girl fastens her dress
to her legs to preserve her modesty during her execution; the bloody
yarmulke which a Jew, having run a gauntlet of blows, notices has
fallen off his head, returns to retrieve and thereby subjects himself
to a second, lethal, round of blows. The little soul gets into heaven,
but a Voice now judges the gifts: Beautiful! Absolutely useless of
course, but beautiful...

Subject: Nivl-pe

I agree that I have only heard it pronounced "nivl", and yet Hebrew
grammar would dictate nib-bul (as in pig-gul, sil-luq,shim-mur etc.).
Most interesting is the fact that yiddish tends to retain the dagesh
even where Hebrew grammar would lose it - as  in biklal, bikavune,
bikoiekh, lipunim, likaf-z'khus, likol-hapokhes etc. (see Schaechter's
Laytish Mame-Loshn, pp. 136 - 137). The only  quick answer I can come
up with is that the root is first encountered in the pentateuch (you
don't see that word too often on the net) in the story of Jethro and
Moses, and Jethro warns Moses that he will surely become farmisht
eventually - the hebrew is "navol tibbol". I can only guess that the
pronounciation may be predicated on that one occurence, and the v
sound persisted.

Subject: Nivl-pe

This is a clarification in light of the responses to my query about
the Yiddish pronunciation of "nivl/nibl-pe".  Examining Hebrew
morphology to determine the pronunciation of a loshn-koydesh derived
Yiddish word is irrelevant in this case, since I am not asking how the
word _should_ be pronounced, but how it _is_ pronounced among native
Yiddish speakers.  My contention is that if the pronunciation with a
"veys" is indeed the dominant one (or only one, or optional one) in
_Yiddish_, this fact is significant when Weinreich only lists
"nibl-pe".

The Hebrew-to-Yiddish beys-veys confusion is a natural one since the
passage of such words into the vernacular was mediated by printed
Rabbinic texts, in which distinguishing consonant and vowel points are
lacking. (Cf. the pronunciations Abrabanel - Abravanel - Abarbanel -
Abarvanel, or Evnezre - Ibn Ezra.)  This confusion was carried forward
into Yiddish orthography before the days of YIVO standardization.
Thus when Harkavy's Yiddish-English English-Yiddish dictionary defines
'obscenity' as 'nivl-pe' without a pintele, we still have no idea
whether a beys or a veys is intended.  In his later
Yiddish-English-Hebrew dictionary the main (Yiddish) entry does have a
pintele, but it's not clear if this reflects Yiddish pronunciation or
if it is an orthographic convenience that allows for a ditto sign (~)
instead of reprinting a different Hebrew entry.

Subject: The Mendele Review

In early January (6.190) the shames posted this:

   For a long time now Mendelistn have been asked to keep our
   readers posted about developments in the world of Yiddish and
   related fields and indeed we've received valuable reports over
   the years.  The amazing thing is how much has been allowed to
   slip by unnoticed, unreported. For the world of Yiddish
   letters is wonderfully alive and our readers deserve to know
   it all.

That was the proposal.  But between proposing and getting something
done takes time.  Now at long last _The Mendele Review_ is ready. It's
editor is Leonard (Yude-Leyb) Prager of Haifa University, a Mendelist
whose work we all know and who brings to the job a level and breadth
of Yiddish learning that most of us can only envy. I'm confident that
under his guidance TMR will be an intellectual feast.

_The Mendele Review_ will be mailed to all Mendele subscribers as a
special supplement and at the same low price.

Zol zayn mit glik un mit hatslokhe!
