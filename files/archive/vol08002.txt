Subject: Yiddish in the Yishuv

Re Susan Lerner's query (07.196) concerning Yiddish in the Yishuv.  Two major
works on this subject: 

M. Kosover, _Arabic elements in Palestinian Yiddish_, Jerusalem, 1966 

Aryeh Leyb Pilovski _Tsvishn yo un neyn: Yidish un yidish-literatur in
Erets-Yisroyel, 1907-1948_, Tel Aviv, 1986.

Mikhl Herzog

[Moderator's note: I would add recent and very interesting book "A marriage
made in heaven: the sexual politics of Hebrew and Yiddish" by Naomi Seidman
(Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997) that deals at length with 
the various issues of Yiddish in the Yishuv.

A lot of relevant information can be found in the books on Yiddish in Israel,
e.g.:

Joshua Fishman, Yiddish in Israel, In: The sociology of language in Israel /
Hague: Mouton, 1974

Soll sein - Jiddische Kultur im judischen Staat / Augsburg: Olbaum, 1989

Mordekhai Halamish, Yidish be-Yisrael : al sofrim, meshorerim, omanim /
Tel-Aviv : Eked, 1990

I.Z.Shargel, Mit fule emers / Tel-Aviv : Farlag "Yisroel-bukh", 1990

Also, there are many antologies of prose and poetry, e.g.:

Erets-Yisroel in der Yidisher literatur / Tel-Aviv : Farlag Y.L. Perets, 1961

Oyf di shliyakhn fun heym: Erets Yisroel motivn bay di Yidishe prozayikers,

Yidish un Yidisher kultur, 1989

Yidish-literatur in Medines-Yisroel / Tel-Aviv : H.Leyvik Farlag, 1991

Antologye: in dem eygenem land / Buenos Aires, 1973 (Musterverk, 55)

Geyt a Yid keyn Erets-Yisroel / Buenos Aires, 1978 (Musterverk, 75)

Yisroel in di tfutses in der Yidisher literatur / Buenos Aires, 1981

Subject: Hebrew and Aramaic in Yiddish

As Mikhl hints, the precise origin of the Hebrew and Aramaic words in Yiddish
is one of the many contentious issues in Yiddish historical linguistics.  The
background of Katz's theory that the Hebrew was borrowed into Aramaic and
thence into Yiddish is important. Katz claims that everybody but him has held
that the Hebrew and Aramaic words in Yiddish were borrowed not from speech but
from specific Hebrew or Aramaic texts.  I dont think this is true, and I
believe that Katz is creating a straw man here.  Moreover, whether true or
not, the crucial point is that Katz claims that there are only two possible
explanations: (a) these words came from texts or (b) they came from a
colloquial Semitic language spoken by some group of Jews living in Europewho
(or whose immediate descendants) created Yiddish.  Moreover, he assumes that
Hebrew could not have been this alleged colloquial language, for who would
believe that Hebrew was spoken colloquially in medieval Europe, so it must
have been Aramaic.  This is the sum total of his argument for why the Hebrew
came into Yiddish via Aramaic and not say the other way around.  This makes no
sense to me.  Moreover, there is an obvious alternative to (a) and (b),
namely, (c) these words came into Yiddish from a Semitic language or languages
which were spoken (i.e., pronounced) but were not colloquial, i.e., from the
Hebrew and Aramaic that were used by Jews the way Latin was used by non-Jews
or even the way English is used today by non-English native speakers the world
over.  Katz's specific arguments for (b)  over (a) have to do with the fact
that in Yiddish words of Hebrew or Aramaic origin have a certain very
distinctive property as far as how they are pronounced: with a few exceptions,
all vowels are short in syllables closed by a consonant, which is why we have
klal but pl. klolem, sod but pl.  soydes.  The fact that this is so was
discovered long before Katz but its importance was seen by Katz because it is
something which the Hebrew-and-Aramaic- in-Yiddish have this property but no
pronunciation of Hebrew or Aramaic itself does.  Katz as I said takes this to
mean that we are dealing with a colloquial Aramaic, because only a colloquial
language could have developed a peculiar pronunciation all its own.  I dont
think this follows at all: Latin in the middle ages and since has not been a
colloquial language but it has developed all kinds of pronunciations in
different countries, and so the Hebrew or Aramaic of Jews whose native
language was something else could have too. There are other issues, too, but
once again the answer depends on a detailed linguistic analysis of facts which
by themselves may seem dry as dust but which alone can tell us what the
language (and life) of early medieval Jews was like in and around Germany. 

Of course, the details dont only have to do with pronunciation.  I will not
try to draw any conclusions but the kinds of facts which are I think
significant in deciding where the Semitic component of Yiddish comes from and
how exactly it got there are the following: 

(a) Yiddish widely uses the Hebrew pl. ending -im and hardly ever the Aramaic
-in (even though the latter was widely used in medieval Hebrew),

(b) Yiddish has a number of words whose root is of Hebrew origin but with the
Aramaic feminine ending -ta (Yiddish -te) but never an Aramaic root with a
Hebrew suffix,

(c) Yiddish has lots of verbs made from Semitic roots but these are always of
Hebrew, never of Aramaic origin, and moreover (although some might dispute
this, I am not sure) these verbs in all cases reflect real Hebrew verb forms
(and I think it matters what forms these are, but I wont go into that now). 

As I have said before, it is only by pondering such details that we can
discover the history of Yiddish.  I may not agree with Katz about much, but
his approach is right. You have to look at the details and find just those
which point to a particular conclusion about the past.

Subject: A movie in English, Welsh and Yiddish

Now we need a Yiddish-Welsh dictionary!!

>From "The Times" of London
May 14 1998 
 
ACTORS sometimes insist that learning lines is the easiest part of their
trade, but those starring in a film about a Jewish boy who falls in love with
a non-Jewish girl in South Wales before the Great War have had to learn them
in three languages. Solomon and Gaenor has been shot in English, Welsh and
Yiddish. 
 
The production, being promoted at the Cannes Film Festival, stars two Welsh
actors - Ioan Gruffudd, who appeared in Titanic, and Nia Roberts in her first
feature film lead. In the story, love triumphs against a backdrop of poverty
and anti-Semitism. 
 
Maureen Lipman, who also has a leading role, enjoyed speaking Yiddish. "It is
wonderfully onomatopoeic, an incredibly beautiful language," she said. Ms
Roberts said that it had been daunting to face doing an emotional scene in
English and then having to "recreate the same intensity" in Welsh. At first
they occasionally mixed up languages, she recalled.
 
The film, shot around Cardiff, is set in a Welsh mining community in 1911. It
was written and directed by Paul Morrison, who said:  "The juxtaposition of
these two proud and hard-working peoples - the Jewish tinkers of eastern
Europe and the Welsh mining and chapel communities - struck me as powerful
material for a drama."

Subject: vilde chaya

I am a psychoanalyst and film scholar, currently reviewing THE BUTCHER BOY,
film based on a strange, hilarious, terrifying novel by Patrick McCabe about a
psychotic Irish youngster. 

In the course of writing the review, the phrase VILDE CHAYA popped into my
head from my philadelphia youth. As recalled, this was used to describe a
disobedient youngster of any age ranging up to late adolescence. I never heard
it in connection with a girl. It was quite flexible. You could be called a
vilde chaya in my suburban neighborhood for relatively minor offenses --
talking back to the teacher, God forbid -- not coming home in time for dinner
so forth. But there were also dark allusions when one was thought to be out of
earshot to -- the real item -- authentic vilde chayas, kids who had gotten
into serious delinquent type trouble or ended up as "no goodbums" 
"jailbirds", even occasional lunatics.

I would appreciate further enlightenment on the idiom. Up to what age can you
be considered a vilde chaya? Are girls ever vilde chayas? I also sense that it
is being used in a much more perjorative way today, with ominous ethnic
overtones. In my time, and also according to my mother and mother in law, it
could be used affectionately. 

I by the way was a frequent vilde chaya.

Thanks in advance

Subject: Adrabe: Two meanings.

To quote Yosef Gilboa (7.196, 4): The expression [adrabe] is most frequently
used to mean "on the contrary" rather than "even more so".

Apparently, a single word such as adrabe (which in English is rendered as an
entire subordinate clause) can have two such different meanings, each taking
off in very different directions.  I must surmise that in written text, the
reader's "take" must be determined by context.  Perhaps in speech the
listener's understanding may be helped by vocal intonation.  I am reminded of
the response by someone to an assertion with the English word, "Sure!"  It can
mean vigorous assent.  On the other hand it can express strong skepticism if
the voice is edged with sarcasm.

My memory of the use of ad(e)rabe in Yiddish by my family and their friends
was to mean, "On the contrary," never, "Even more so."  However, I have been
taught by Sholem Aleichem's talkative characters that both meanings occur in
Yiddish.

Subject: chalah and maireh
    
I've been corresponding with a matzah manufacturer concerning their
kashrut/pesach certification shown on their package, namely the phrase,
printed in hebrew letters, 'mir nehmen chalah fun yeder maireh'. The word at
issue is 'maireh', translated by them as 'production batch'. This makes sense
within the context of the sentence, but what exactly is the derivation of
maireh? The closest I can come is the German 'Meierei', meaning a milk
business. But this seems far fetched. How can you get 'production batch' from
it? Any ideas on this out there? Thanks for your help.

dictionaries, grammars, lessons, and tutorials, among them resources for a
number of minority languages: Euskara (Basque), Catalan, Chamorro, Cherokee,
etc., etc.  It should come as no surprise to supporters of Yiddish that our
language is unrepresented (with the exception of a Yiddish Dictionary Project
at Penn which has been discontinued).  I understand that YIVO is working on a
computerized Yiddish dictionary, but are there no steps to remedy this state
of affairs that could be taken in the meantime?

Subject: Yiddishland

I know well the passion and nostalgia for "der alter heym" whose memory was a
living presence with my Yiddish speaking relatives who looked back towards it
always, and for the language in which they lived and in which they endlessly
discussed and argued. My only quibble is an artificial construct of
"Yiddishland" for Yiddish literature. Yiddish literature is the crown of
Yiddish, created by intellectuals and poets who gave voice to both the passion
and the nostalgia. Those who did not live in the shtetlakh of Eastern Europe
cannot know about that world without reading the literature. I have been
immeasurably enriched by it. But, my relatives read the Yiddish tsaytung, and
were not necessarily conversant with 'literature.' Their Yiddishland was in
their hearts, in their mouths, and in their memories. They took these with
them, wherever they went. They weren't necessarily 'religious,' but the memory
of their 'religious life' in 'der heym,' was a pervasive influence on their
behavior in America. I think I learned as much from them as I did from the
literature I later read.  Zay mir gezint.
