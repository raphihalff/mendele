Subject: Introduction

I am new to the Internet and to Mendele. I have been immersed in Yiddish
personally and professionally all my life. I am an alumnus of the
Folk-shule (Montreal), Camp Hemshekh, the Yiddish Drama Group with Dora
Wasserman, Yugntruf in the 60's, professional Yiddish Theater, Yiddish
radio, the Bund, Workmen's Circle, un azoy vayter...Currently, I write
news for the Forverts, broadcast the news daily on WEVD, and book many
Yiddish performers in North America, and some in Europe I am happy to
have joined Mendele, knowing that so many friends and colleagues are here
as well. I look forward to this important connection.

I have one project which I would like to mention. The Bund is planning to
produce a documentary about Camp Hemshekh. If there is anyone who wishes
to be involved, or can supply archival materials, film footage, audio,
photographs, or would be willing to be interviewed for the film, please
get in touch with me. We're at the pre-preliminary stages.

Subject: Survivors of the Shoah

I thought I would send along some information on an organization with
which I have recently become involved.  It's called "Survivors of the
Shoah Visual History Foundation," and it has just been founded by Steven
Spielberg.  The goal of this project is to video record the testimonies
of as many Survivors as possible, in order to data-base them, and store
them in five of the major Holocaust archives (Yad Vashem in Jerusalem,
the Simon Wiesenthal Center in L.A., the Museum of Jewish Heritage in
NYC, the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale, and
the U.S. Holocaust Museum in D.C.) Conceivably, this could amount to tens
of thousands of audio-visually recorded oral histories by the end of the
decade.  Having just finished my training as an interviewer, I can tell
you that this new organization seems to have been very succesful in
incorporating itself into the already existing agencies of Holocaust
memory, including YIVO, and strengthing the overall effort tremendously.

I'm sending this along, because the organization is trying to make
contact with as many Survivors as possible.  If you are a Survivor and
would like to tell your story, the organization has a number that you can
call for more information and to make arrangements: 1-800-661-2092. If
you know Survivors, then please pass this information along.

They are also looking for interviewers and assistants in the various
cities in which they are setting themselves up, and information about
these positions, as well as general information on the program can be
obtained by calling the same number.

Feel free to send me any questions you have, as well, only I'm not sure
how much I'll be able to answer, as I've only just finished training and
haven't done any interviews yet.

Subject: Prokofiev: Overture on Yiddish Themes

wrt Dan Leeson's question: I know next to nothing about Prokofiev (he was
a composer, right? ;-) But I presume the original title was probably in
Russian? If so, the following is relevant:

The 'polite' term in Russian for "Jew" is "yevrey", the word
corresponding to "Hebrew". (The word corresponding to "Jew", "zhid" is
considered offensive in Russian.) And the adjective "yevreyskiy" is
ambiguous between "Jewish", and "Yiddish", just like "yidish" is in
Yiddish; to specify Hebrew, you have to say "staroyevreyski" ('ancient
Jewish'), if I remember correctly.

So if the adjective in the original title is "yevreyskiy", then the
translation "Overture on Hebrew Themes" is inaccurate, either because the
translator was thrown off by the similarity between "yevreyskiy" and
"Hebrew", or because of the corresponding (old-fashioned) English
euphemism of "Hebrew" instead of "Jewish". Either "Jewish Themes" or
"Yiddish Themes" would be more accurate, depending on which describes the
music better.

And if the adjective wasn't "yevreyskiy", or the title wasn't in Russian,
then forget I mentioned it ;-)

Subject: Bunke and l'ak

Dovid Braun:

My "sources" tell me that _bun'ke_ is the vessel in which one
boils the water for the tea (i.e., the "tshaynik"), while "l'ak"
(apparently also "hl'ak/gl'ak) was for keeping the tea warm (in a
"fartifung" in the "oyvn" called a "kakhl'e" or a "shabesnik").

Subject: Butterflies

Moyshe-Yankl Sweet:

"zUmerfeygele", not "zOmerfeygele". If you can wait a bit, I have the
data you're looking for--various Yiddish words for 'butterflies' and and
their regional distribution. It has to be "extracted", and I can't get to
it immediately. Let me know.

Subject: Oifn Pripetchok and memory of parent

Chane Honig's memory of her mother singing Oifn Pripetchok to her in her
crib while mother was ill with diptheria was very touching  to me. It
also made me recall strong  memories of the smell of chalk in my father's
classroom at the Workmens' Circle in Springfield Mass.,my father's
energy and playfullness as a teacher and his passionate devotion to pass
on yede oisiye fun aleph beys. He taught us this song and it did not seem
sad to me then as a 4 year old...because as the song tells, it takes elter
vern tsu farshteyn vos ligt in de oisiyes..

Kol Hakavod to you Alice Honig for your long years of distinguished work
in the work of bettering the lives of poor children and their parents.
