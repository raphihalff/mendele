Subject: Davenen Again

Mr. Warshawsky makes an eloquent plea, but does not take up my challenges, so
let me be more explicit.  If his informants are such good etymologists, I
really must insist that he find out what such informants say about tsholnt,
antshpoyzn, and nebekh.  If he can find even one Poylisher speaker of Yd who,
w/o the benefit of linguistics, knows that the first two are of Romance
origin, that the second specifically is of Italian, the first of French
provenience, and that the third is not merely Slavic but specifically either
Old Czech or Old Sorbian, then I will concede that he and his informants have
every right to be heard on the subject of etymology.  But if not, then I hope
that he will be equally willing to concede that etymology is a proper subject
for people with training in historical linguistics. 

As for specifics, I would like to know how many Yiddish verbs there are that
derive from Aramaic (as opposed to Hebrew), how many Yiddish words of any kind
derive from Aramaic d+noun phrases, how well the phrase mitsva d'avanan is
attested, how this etymology explains the precise sense of davenen which Meyer
Wolf has so well explained, and above all how Mr. Warshawsky and his informant
would explain the form davnen, which I think must clearly be the more original
of the two attested variants in modern Yiddish.  I suspect that such problems
do not even occur to amateur etymologists, which is precisely the point. 

I will add that on the plus side, this etymology accounts for the vowels and
consonants much better than any of the other alternatives I know of (but the
fact remains that the Hebrew etymology I have been defending works better
because it seems to account for the missing 'e' in davnen).

From: Meyer Wolf <wolfim@idt.net>
Subject: Beni Warshawsky & dav(e)nen 

Beni Warshawsky is certainly right [07.103] to excoriate scholarship divorced
of common sense. Bute even with loads of common sense, a little scholarship
doesnt hurt. 

Mr. Warshawsky writes: ".. it is convincing that the mitsve of prayer was
referred to as the mitsve d'Avanan (from our fathers) and hence dav(e)nen
rather than tfile. As for the term d'Avanan itself, it is comparable in
structure to the terms Rabanan(our rabbis) and Maranan(our Masters)." 

It is one thing to promote the derivation of dav(e)nen from an Aramaic source;
it is quite another to point to an apparently made-up Aramaic word to provide
that source. Unless the dictionaries are wrong, the Aramaic word for 'fathers'
is, in the Ashkenazic pronunciation, avohon, 'our fathers' avohosano, neither
of which which accounts for a Polish Hasid's avanan and its unexpected
Sephardic vocalization. 

Nor is it clear what he means by his statement that in Yiddish one says
dav(e)nen rather than tfile. One does say tfile ton as well as dav(e)nen

The Yiddish Forward, in a statement printed on November 14th, stated the
final intention of its editors to go over to the standard YIVO orthography.
This will be done in stages, says the announcement, until all prescriptions
of the YIVO system are instituted--goodbye shtumer alef, hello khirik-yud and
fey mit a shtrikhl.  Congratulations to the Forverts editors on joining the
rest of the Yiddish literary world!

From: paullaure@juno.com (Paul D Glasser)
Subject: "Geshikhte fun der yidisher shprakh"

I believe that I wrote this to Mendele once already, but here it is again: 
The translation of the first two volumes of Max Weinreich's "Geshikhte fun der
yidisher shprakh" is out of print and basically unavailable, as far as I know. 
I am now engaged (at YIVO) on the translation of the second two volumes, and
they should be ready for publication in the next few months. In addition, YIVO
hopes to reissue the first two volumes at the same time. So hold on a little
longer and you should be able to get a complete translation. (If your Yiddish
is limited, Weinreich's "Geshikhte" is probably not a very practical way of
improving it - it's very technical.)

From: Dembart@aol.com
Subject:  A Yiddish radio jingle

There used to be a men's clothing store on the Lower East Side of Manhattan
called Joe & Paul, and they advertised on the Yiddish radio (WEVD, I assume)
with a catchy jingle that, to the best of my father's recollection, went
something like:

Joe & Paul
Iz a fargenign.
Joe & Paul,
Men ken a bargain krign.
A coat, a suit, a gabardine,
Brengt arayn dem tayerem zun (pronounced zin, to rhyme with gabarbine).

Does anybody know whether those were the actual words?  Was there any more to
this ditty?  And does anybody know or remember any other Yiddish radio
commercials?

Subject: about KlezKamp

Prodded by the imminentness of this year's KlezKamp, hoping to be useful 
before this year's registration is closed, there is now an article about my
experiences at last year's camp at the source of many fun klez things on the
web--my klezmer shack: http://www.well.com/user/ari/klez/

Or, you can go right to the article by exploring
