Subject: Bakenen vs. bakanen

At least in one dialect, mayne eygene mames loshn, there is a clear
distinction, e.g.:

mir hobn uns bakent  we got to know each other
mir hobn uns bakant  we recognized each other

by no means interchangeable!  Are others familiar with this distinction?

Subject: Komponentn visigkayt

The shame that many Jews in America felt about speaking Yiddish
(including many of my very close relatives), the belief that it it was an
uncultured slang, (jargon), is completely analogous to the shame and
denial found among educated American blacks with regard to the existance
of a language called Black English, with its own well defined structure,
gramatical rules, etc. Only those with komponentn visigkayt learn to
respect and love their respective mame-loshns, and with that, their
heritages and themselves.

But I am not the qualified authority to talk about such linguistic
matters.  Josh Fishman, Are you out there lurking?

Subject: Tzeylem kop

In reference to Zellig Bach's elaboration of the Litvak as the Tzeylem Kopf:

In my growing up days in the Chassidic Williamsburg community post WWII,
the Litvaks were looked down (up?) upon because of their intellectualism
and (by implication) their proximity to the Haskalah movement. The lines
became blurred between the Apikores (heathen/atheist) and the meshoomud
(convert to Christianity).  Thus, the assumption that the heathen Litvak
is really a closet Christian "in his head."

Our heimishe "feliton" (humorous Socratic segment) went as follows:

     Why is a Litvak called a Tzeylem kop?
     Because he has a crucifix inside his head.
     How can you possible know that?
     Simple. Find a Litvak, break open his head, and you will find the
        crucifix.
     But what if you do not find a crucifix in his head?
     Well, so there will be one Litvak less in the world.

Subject: Tseylem kop

Zellig Bach  as a Litvak gives  their way of explaining  why they were
called Tseylem  Kop.  This, so  I understand, was  a term used  by the
Polish  Khasidm who  were not  so well  disposed towards  their Litvak
opponents.  I, as a Yekke, am not involved in that dispute, but I have a
story  about it given  in Alter Droyanov's  (sp?) book of  jokes and
witticism (I  own the Hebrew  version and do not  know if it  had been
translated).

A "poylisher" boy asked his father why the Litvaks were called tseylim
kop.  Replies  his father, "Take an  axe and open a  Litvak's head and
you'll find a tseylem (cross) in it".  The boy asks: "And what happens if
I do  not  find a  tseylem  in  his head?".   The  father was  not
perturbed and said "At least you got rid of a Litvak".

But all this was a long time ago.  These days all Jews love each other
irrespective of their country of origin!

To corroborate the explanation given by Neil Jacobs: we called the
stuffed cabbages my mother used to cook - golombkes.

Subject: What is the business of Mendele?

Unzer tayerer shames Noyekh shraybt:

> 2.  Last but most important: Mendele deals with _Yiddish_, not with all
> aspects of Judaism or of Jewish culture.  Naturally it isn't easy to draw
> a clear line here and there will always be gray areas.  Nevertheless I
> think we've included a number of topics (the most recent being the
> lamed-vovnik) that might just as easily have been omitted.  I hope no one

> It's just that such matters have no immediate connection with Yiddish.
>
> And where there's greater restraint in posts about Talmudic figures
> for example, there should be as much restraint in posts about secular
> Jewish culture: unless there's a robust connection with Yiddish it
> probably doesn't belong on Mendele.  The etymology of prakes is in,
