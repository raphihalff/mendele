Subject: Yiddish vs Idish

Nissan Leibovic, in introducing himself, notes that "Idish"
(not "Yiddish" or "Yidish") is his mame-loshn.  Like
Nissan, my parents were Litvakes, and pronounced the words
Id and Idish (though I don't recall whether there was an
initial glottal stop.)  Indeed, I was taught to spell the
words with shtumer-alef/yud rather than yud/khirek-yud, and
the printed materials that I remember uniformly used the
former.

Can the dialectologists among the MENDELE readership
explain how "standard Yiddish" came down on the side of the
latter? Note that there is actually a difference in
pronunciation, so that the difference in spelling is not
without effect, as it is, e.g., in ayz[e]n or kimpetor[i]n,
where the bracketed letters are not pronounced even when
used.

Mit khavershe grusn,

Subject: mazl-tov, mit mazl zolt ir lebn!

Just a note re _mazl-tov_:

In Yiddish, _mazl-tov_ doesn't mean 'good luck'.  (For that
we have:  zol zayn mit mazl, zol zayn mit mazl un glik, zol
zayn in a mazldiker sho, ...in a guter sho, ...in a guter
un a mazldiker sho, ...mit hatslokhe, zay(t) matsliekh, zol
zayn mitn rekhtn fus [when moving into a new residence, or
for any beginning], etc., often with the omission of the
_zol zayn_ at the beginning).  Its meaning in Yiddish usage
is 'congratulations!'  In Hebrew the meaning is 'good
luck', and this greeting/blessing is not used in Modern
Israeli Hebrew (instead: behatslakha, probably patterned on
the Yiddish _[zol zayn mit] hatslokhe!, zay(t) matsliekh_).

The traditional answer to mazl-tov in Yiddish is to repeat
the word twice (mazl-tov, mazl-tov!) or: mit mazl
zolstu/zolt ir (mir) lebn.  At a wedding, if the greeter is
unmarried or is the parent of an unmarried child, the
greetee will answer with: mirtseshem ba dir/aykh.

Ironic use of mazl-tov:  I've noticed in the English of
American Jews the use of an ironic mazl-tov, as when
something breaks, when some other mishap occurs. This
corresponds to the English 'wonderful!, great!' in the same
situations, in which the speaker really means 'God damn
it!'  I used this mazl-tov in the presence of an Eastern
European-born native Yiddish speaker who then asked me why
I'd said _mazl-tov_ when my phone got cut off or my books
fell or whatever the mishap was at the time.  It didn't
make sense to him.  Do you think this is only in American
usage, to correspond with the English ironic uses?  (I've
heard "Congratulations!" used ironically in English as
well.)  Although when something breaks/shatters, we (my
family) say _a sheyne, reyne kapore_, I've often heard
_mazl-tov_, but now I'm not sure whether that was from
native E.Eur. Yiddish-speakers or American Jews.  I always
associated this particular _mazl-tov_ (i.e., upon
something's breaking) with the _mazl-tov_ said at weddings
right after the breaking of the glass.  I figured that this
was an extension of that situation, only ironic.
