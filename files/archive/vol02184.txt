Subject: Di fir kashes af yidish

     We learned a different version in the Arbeter Ring
schools, which has a lot more Hebrew than the other
versions mentioned. Maybe as non- (or anti-) religious
socialists, they wanted to show that they were not also
amarotsim.  I can't vouch for every word, but it goes
something like this:

     ma nishtano halaylo haze mikol haleyloys?  farvos
is di dozike nakht fun peysakh andersh fun ale nekht
fun a gants yor?

     shebekhol haleyloys -- ale nekht fun a gants yor
esn mir say khomets say matse -- ober halaylo haze, in
der doziker peysakh nakht, nor matse.

     shebekhol haleyloys -- ale nekht fun a gants yor
esn mir alerley grinsn -- ober halaylo haze, in der
doziker peysakh nakht, moroir, nor bitere kreitekher.

     shebekhol haleyloys -- ale nekht fun a gants yor
tunken mir ayn afilu eyn mol nit -- ober halaylo haze,
in der doziker peysakh nakht, tunken mir ayn tsvey mol.

     shebekhol haleyloys -- ale nekht fun a gants yor
esn mir say zitsndik glaykh, say ongelent -- ober
halaylo haze, in der doziker peysakh nakht, zitsm mir
nor ongelent.

Subject: Slippers

for David Sherman: in my family, backless slippers were
called "puhdeshvis" more or less phonetically presented
here, or "pahdeshves." Bessarabian yiddish?

1. The "Chronicle of higher education" of 4-21-93
reports on an undertaking based at the Center for
Archival Studies at the Russian State Humanities
University in Moscow, co-sponsored by the JTS and YIVO
Institute for Jewish Research, both based in NYC.
Archival material consisting of 19th century documents,
manuscripts, and photographs from Jewish schools,
theaters, political parties, and other religious and
cultural organizations are (will be ?) in the process
of being abstracted and described, item by item. A vast
undertaking. Ultimately, these descriptions and
abstracts will form a catalogue in both English and
Russian. The team working on this project plans on
possibly putting the catalogue on a computer disk.

2.  YIVO's Zachary Baker reported on this undertaking
taking shape already at AJL's 1991 Annual Convention in
Miami Beach. Perhaps Mr. Baker can keep us up to date
on the progress of this undertaking. While I am most
interested in the collaboration with teaching faculty
members, I am evidently concerned with the very
technical services specifics of the cataloging and
archiving procedures involved herein: the machine
readable format selected for the catalogue, its
cataloging and archiving standards, the method by which
these standards and procedures will be maintained, and
the linguistic and area study background requirements
asserted over those who will perform this undertaking.
In particular, as I pointed in my earlier address to
this list, I most concerned with the accuracy in
transcribing the personal and corporate names from the
Yiddish documents. All these will have a critical
impact over the outcome of the undertaking, ultimately
affecting what will be accessed (on the Internet, for
example), and its reliability.
