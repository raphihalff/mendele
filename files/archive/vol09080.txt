Subject: Introduction

Khaveyrim --

I am returning to this list after an absence of about two years. In brief, I
am a journalist writing on Jewish issues (among many other things!)
particularly film and music. In the latter capacity I am music critic for
Jewish Week (NYC), the Jewish Journal of Greater LA, the Detroit Jewish News
and several other publications both print and "virtual." My new book,
Essential Judaism, was published in hardcover last month by Pocket Books. (I
regret to say that a large part of the material on Yiddish in the book's
final chapter was cut by my editor for space considerations. For this list I
feel obliged to note that.) My Yiddish is rudimentary but I am hoping, now
that the book is out of the way, to spend some time working on it (and on my
Hebrew, too).

Many thanks,
George Robinson

Subject: "Chareidi Fiction"

Pursuant to recent discussions on the Mendele regarding "Chareidi Yiddish" I
received several inquiries regarding Chareidi fictions. Below is a partial
list that I have compiled of some of the novels published by Chareidi
authors in the last few years. I have no connection financial or otherwise
with the authors, publishers, or booksellers.

The first seven are published by "Mekor Chaim" publishing a Chasidic
publishing house in Brooklyn, NY.

 1. "Mein Hoffening" by Yehudis Cohen
 2. "Tzvishen Mir un Dir" - Pasiringin un Leben 
 3. "Farloiren un Gevonen" by Chavah Rosenberg
 4. "Farvos iz er Farshvundin" by Chaim Eliav
 5. "Nein un Neintzug" by Chavah Rosenberg
 6. "Geshtelt oif di Feess" by Chanah Goldshtein
 7. "Farchapt in Netz" by Chaim Eliav

The following book is published by "Ohr Yisroel" Publishing in Monroe, NY.

 8. "A Kind in Gericht"  by Yaakov Menachem Hirschson

The following was published by "Hameir L'Yisroel" Publishing in Brooklyn, NY

 9. In Fremde Hent by C.Y. Schnitzer

The above is only a partial list of the works of fiction appearing in
Yiddish. Some of these have been published only in Yiddish, some have
simultaneously been published in Hebrew and English. In addition here are
many new biographies and autobiographies constantly being published. The
books are available in most Judaica stores in Brooklyn, for those that live
out of town and wish to contact me directly I will be glad to obtain for
them the telephone numbers of booksellers that do shipping. To the best of
my knowledge the only new original fictional work is being published in this
community.

Subject: The Lost Town

Charles Haim Istrail is seeking a translator and a publisher for his
Yiddish-language novel, _The Lost Town_. It is a novel about Jewish life in
Russia and its author believes it will be of interest to the American Jewish
people. If you are interested in translating this work or in assisting Mr.
Istrail in any other way, please contact him at the following address or
phone number:

1110 Cromwell Hills Drive
Cromwell, CT   06416
Phone 860-635-9004

Thanks.

Subject: Song about the tallith

In 09.076 Naomi (Feldman) Fatouros asks for the lyrics to a song about
taking one's tallis to the grave.  I can recall only one line of the chorus
to this song (which I used to sing as a member of a choir) as follows.  I
hope it helps someone else to recognize the song and provide all the lyrics!

  Alles, alles nor dem talis - dus nemt er mit.

Obviously this refers to the act of wraping the washed body in a talis as
part of the ceremony of preparing a corpse for burial.

Subject: Dos talisl

Naomi Fattouros asks  [Vol. 09.076(9)] for the words to a song about the
talis. "Dos talisl"  was written by S. Smulewitz (Small) and was published
in 1921 in New York. The music is by Perlmutter and Wohl. Here is the
yiddish text (first of 2 verses, and chorus), quite daytshmerish as was
common at that time. The sheet music gives an English version as well:

Dos talisl iz a tayere zakh,
Dos gehert tsu dem yidn;
Yeder yid hot in im hofnung a sakh,
Yeder yid iz mit im tsufridn.
Akh! Tayerer talis, hertslikhe treyst,
Fil tfiles herstu zikh ayn,
Fun ale bitere hertser du veyst,
Filst gants gut dem yidns payn.
Bist imer mit dem yidele
Fun zayn bris on hot er dikh,
Oykh ven men grobt mit dem ridele,
Vikelstu im ayn mit zikh.
Bagleytern in gloybikayt,
Du bist dokh mayn eybikayt.

CHOR:
Dos talisl iz nor dos eyntsike kleyd
Far dem yidn in zayn freyd un layd
Fun zayn geburtstog biz in keyver
Geyt es mit im mit.
Vert iberal geyogt,
Zayn lebn iz geplogt,
Ales vos er farmogt
Nemt men tsu fun yid,
Ales, ales, nor dem talis,
Dos nemt men nit, neyn, neyn, neyn.

(It is interesting to see DOS talis (neuter). One usually sees DI talis
(feminine) in English-yiddish dictionaries, and DER talit (male) in
Hebrew-yiddish dictionaries. I recently sent in a question about this to
Mendele, but haven't seen it released yet. Hopefully it will appear soon. I
am eager to see comments from the Mendelistn about this curiosity.)

Subject: Rebbetzins

For a study of rebbetzins in American Jewish life, I'm trying to learn more
about the usage of the term "rebbetzin" in the United States. Since it is
not a German Jewish term, nineteenth century Reform Jews seem not to have
used it to refer to their their rabbis' wives. I'd be eager for any
information- scholarly or anecdotal-or suggestions about where to find out
when the term became commonly used. I'm also trying to determine what the
various connotations of the title were in various decades and from whence
these associations derive.

thanks.
