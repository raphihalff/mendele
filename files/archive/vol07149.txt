Subject: Patlazhan & P'tscha.

Patlazhones may very well be of Turkic (not Turkish) origin, but they came
evidently through/from Moldavian/Rumanian. Analogous to their usage in the
Moldavian language, at least in Bessarabian Yiddish are tomatoes called royte
patlazhones (Moldavian: patlazhele), and eggplants- bluve patlazhones
(Moldavian: patlazhele vin'yete). Slavic languages may have also played into
it (Russian for eggplants:ÿ baklazhany or siniye-literally di bluve).There
seems to have been a Turkish influence on the Jewish culinary habits in
Bessarabia in general - the dishes are pretty spicy compared to other regions
(pastrome and prismak - eggplant salad a-la babaganushi with garlick - are
exemplary in that regard), and baklava (or bakleva) is considered Jewish par
excellence in those mekoymes. 

As to p'tscha - the Russian-Yiddish dictionary (Der Risish-Yidisher
verterbikh, inter der redaktsiye fyn M.Shapiro, E.Spivak yn M.Shulman, Moskve,
farlag "Russky yazyk",1984 ) provides 3 Yiddish words for the Russian
kholodets, namely: dril=92yes, pecha (2nd syllable stressed), and kholodets
proper. It translates another Russian (and Ukrainian) word for the makhl -
studen=92 as pecha, dril, gliver. And still another Russian word - zalivnoye -
as fleysh/fish yn dril=92yes/gliver. One can find the following entries in the
"Der Oytser Fun Der Yidisher Shprakh" fun Nokhem Stuchkoff: pecha, peche,
petsa, fus, fis; fargliverte/geshtelte fis; krayzlfus, grayshlfus, fusnoge,
fusnohe, drilye, drelye, galyer(te), ishkes, kholodets, shtuding, zhele,
gegliverts, gegliverekhts, kvashene. 

My relatives (Bessarabia) call it kholodets; my wife's (Kiev) - kholodnoye;
and they seem to be unaware of other terms. Either way, it used to be quite a
festive delicacy back in the USSR (so much time and labor would the process
consume). And it turned ordinary here, in the US, for can be bought (freshly
made) in any Russian supermarket. It could be prepared with the fis fyn
kolerley beymes (Ukrainians use di khozershe fislekh, nit far keynem
gedakht) or fislekh, pypiklekh yn fligelekh fyn a un, - doesn't matter. The
cooking principle does.

P.S.: U-va! I'm beginning to salivate, following the gastronomic theme in a
very Pavlovian way. M'volt dovke gedarft yfesn a telerl kholodets!

Subject: ikh zol azoy visn fun tsores


The expression listed by Lyber Katz (4.146, 4) as Item 7, "er (ikh) zol azoy
visn fun tzores" was interpreted by him as "he should only know of such
troubles."ÿ I recall a different interpretation. 

My memory offers something else.ÿ First of all, the expression was always "ikh
(never er) zol azoy visn fun tsores."ÿ In response to a puzzling question to
which we have no answer, we may say in English "I haven't the foggiest idea." 
In Yiddish I might say "ikh zol azoy visn fun tsores."ÿ My interpretation of
the Yiddish is "I know nothing about that, and that's how much I wish I knew
about troubles and pain."

Subject: Tal-A-pah

Sidney Weinstein hot mikh gebetn ikh zol aykh ibergebn zayn kashe vegn dem
inyen:

"The term is "tahl-A'-pah in Blit." My interpretation as a child was that the
woman who used it was accusing another woman of having delivered a deformed
child because it had been conceived during the menstrual period [blit?].ÿ In
my youthful wisdom, I have speculated that "Tal-A'-pah" therefore, might have
meant "sexual intercourse," because the horrified verbal reaction after it was
pronounced, was intense.ÿ In addition to the hateful, superstitious
interpretation, the reaction was intense, possibly because I assumed the term
itself to have been a vulgar usage.ÿ However, I must remind you that I was
very young, I had never heard either the term or the concept used before [or
even since], and the woman was a very angry, superstitious and ignorant woman.

Subject: "Shturmdike Yorn" by Ahron Gorelik

The "Yisker Bukh far Bobruisk [Belarus] un Umgegnt" contains an excerpt from
"Shturmdike Yorn" by Ahron Gorelik, published in New York in 1946. The excerpt
is titled, "Dos Shtetl Stareh Dorogi" (which was in Bobruisk District). 

Gorelik is one of my family names, but I can't determine whether Ahron was a
relative of mine since so many unrelated families adopted this name in the
lower Berezina valley (Paritsh, Zhedrin) of the 18th century.ÿ I have been
told that "Gorelik" means "burned-out," or "one whose house has been burned
down" [perhaps in a pogrom?]. 

1. Does anyone posess a copy of "Shturmdike Yorn" or know of it?ÿ In what
language was it written? 

2. Is the author well-known in the Yiddish world, and if so could you send
some information/evaluation about him? 

3. Are there any on-line card catalogs for Yiddish libraries, such as YIVO or
Yiddish Book Center? 

A Sheynem Dank,

Subject: Tsholnt

Rick (Henekh) Gildemeister alludes to the non-Eastern Yiddish form shalet or
sholet. This is a not entirely clear matter, because there are few pan-Yiddish
words beginning with tsh-, so we cannot be sure whether it is correct to say
that Proto-Yiddish had a form more or less reconstructible as *tsha:lnt, and
that initial tsh- changed to sh- in non-Eastern Yiddish dialects.ÿ The absence
of an -n- is also by no means clear, and the only thing we really CAN be
pretty confident of is the vowel, Proto-Yiddish *a: (in Weinreich's system
*a3).ÿ So there are some open questions here, much as I myself am not entirely
happy with the standard etymology as taught by Weinreich, and regard that as
still somewhat open to question at the level of detail (though there is NO
serious possibility that it comes from *chaud lent). 

By the way, I keep saying non-Eastern Yd because according to my research
(although I do not know how widely this is accepted), the so-called 'Western
Yiddish' is not a valid grouping of Yd dialects, so that the only logically
proper to refer to all the dialects other than EY is by saying 'non-Eastern'.

Subject: And speaking of cholent

This week's Northern California Jewish Chronilce (2/13/98) makes reference to
what was suggested to be the first-ever National Cholent Competition (held in
Jerusalem).ÿ The opening sentence of the article states: 

	"It's called cholent in Eastern Europe, schena in Morocco,
	thit in Iraq, hetteh in Kurdistan and hmin in Yemen."

The first prize winner of the vent was Esther Israel of Kfar Sava.ÿ She made
something called a "Tripolitanian spinach cholent" which in the future will be
served at the Dan Hotel.ÿ Her version included chicken, beef, semolina
dumplings, stuffed vegetables and spinach, flavored with garlic, onion, and a
medley of herbs, including parsley and cilantro.ÿ She said that she did not
include kishke or stuffed grape leaves because of a lack of time. 

Mrs. Israel said that she entered the contest because her "children don't
appreciate it." 

Spinach cholent -- GEVALT!!

Subject: Upgetan af Terkish


Concerning the expression Upgetan af Terkish which is the usage I remember,
perhaps the English "dirty trick"ÿ is as good a rendition as any.ÿ As to the
origin I can only suggest the possibility that it reflects the low esteem
accorded the Turks back then. Another expression reflecting such sentiments
might be -- zoll zein fun a Terk abee tzu refueh, which we now always use to
account for recovery from unknown or improbable causes.

Subject: "Tsholent"ÿ 
ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ 
The guesswork expressed in Mendele in regard to the origin(s) of the Yiddish
word "tsholent" is generally not very solid.ÿ To cite Salicia Landman is to
invite disaster, since her books are inaccurate and dishonest.ÿ In her book on
the Yiddish language (ABENTEUER EINER SPRACHE), she doesn't even get the
Yiddish alphabet right, and she supplies Israeli pronunciation for a number of
Hebrew-Aramaic derivates that have been used in Yiddish for centuries.ÿ Her
book on the Jewish joke i(DER JUEDISCHE WITZ) is completely plagiarized from
Nathan Ausubel's American collection of Jewish humor--even if you don't know
the source of her lowway robbery, it's obvious that her book is translated
from English because of the countless anglicisms such as "Bizykel" (bicycle) 
instead of the normal German word "Fahrrad"--etc.ÿ Now I'm not saying that
she's as stupid as Leo Rosten--I'd say she's stupider, because he at least had
the sense not to be such a blatant plagiarist.

Paul Glasser quotes Max Weinreich and feels that the "case" is "closed". 
Hardly.ÿ One example of a different theory about the etymology of "tsholent"
is offered by the highly imaginative and free-wheeling Paul Wexler (THE
ASHKENAZIC JEWS), who (somewhat ungrammatically) rejects Weinreich's
suggestion altogether: "The fact that 'tsholent' is now almost exclusively
restricted to Eastern Europe makes a French origin especially unattractive"
(p. 126).ÿ Without reaching a definitive conclusion (a sensible modesty),
Wexler points to Rhaeto-Romance and a number of Italian dialects--and perhaps
"the presence of Romanism in a stretch of non-Jewish Romance and Slavic
languages" in the Balkans. 
	
Case unclosed!
	
In regard to "yarmulke" you might also check Wexler, who, despite lots of
oversights and blunders, has one overwhelming advantage:ÿ he points out
multiple possibilities for the origins of countless Yiddish words and
Ashekenazic practices--thereby upsetting the rigid scholarly and popular
applecarts (an apple a day keeps the doctor of linguistics away). 

To place blind credence in Weinreich (whose HISTORY I've compared to the Taj
Mahal) is as precarious as believing even one word written by Landman. 
Weinreich was certainly a dazzling and precise scholar, but I assume he was
open to all possibilities and revisions and never considered any scholarly
case closed.
