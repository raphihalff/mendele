Subject: Khurbn/khurbm

Itsek Kertesz says that the Hebraist in him makes him ask,
"Why did Hebrew Khurbn become unpronounceable Khurbm in
Yiddish?" I guess he means Hebrew h.urBAN--or,more likely,
Ashkenazic khurBON.

Undergoing the common Germanic Stress shift of Hebrew words
in Yiddish, it would have been, as he says,khurbn. Phonetic
assimilation of the final nasal to the preceding labial
stop consonant is common enough.

Thus, Yiddish orthography would lead one to expect /hobn/
'to have,' yet the normal pronunciation as far as I know is
/hobm/.Pronouncing the sequence Vowel + /bm/ is, in fact,
not hard at all. The lips, which have to be closed for the
/b/, are kept closed, but the velum (soft palate) is
lowered to its normal relaxed position used for ordinary
breathing.This links the oral and pharynngeal cavities
(mouth and throat) to the nasal cavity. The larynx is
emitting pulses (voicing) for the /b/; these pulses, once
the velo-pharyngeal port to the nose is opened,excite
resonances in both the oral and nasal parts of the voal
tract,giving a SYLLABIC nasal,cf. Am. Eng."hidden."

Subject: Anski

Noyekh - I don't know if it's worth posting this for
everyone, but I was fascinated by your comments about
Anski.  There is something more to this business of
learning the alphabet at 17 than meets the eye, as his
written Russian was flawless (I can't imagine that someone
was editing him) and if he had much of a Yiddish accent, it
would have really bothered Mandelstam (M. was sensitive to
Yiddish accents in Russian, for obvious reasons).  M.
doesn't mention it at all - he speaks of A. as a wonderful
storyteller.  This business of Jewish narodniks is a
wonderful topic for somebody to pursue - what a tangled and
ironic situation!

Alice:  The very little that I know about Ansky comes from
the biographical notice in Oysgeklibene Shriftn, edited by
Shmuel Roshzansky, Vol. 21 of the Musterverk fun der
Idisher Literatur, Buenos Aires, 1964.  Oddly enough,
Liptzin provides no information in his History of Yiddish
Literature.

Here's what Roshzansky says:

Biz di 17 yor hot er fun Russish nisht gekennt kayn tsuras
oys...Derfar ober, az er hot zikh tsugekhopt tsum lernen un
leynen Russish, iz er arayngefirt gevorn in der radikaler
narodnitchesker literatur..S'iz ober genug, er zol tsushikn
etlekhe korrespondentsn kayn Peterburg, az m'zol glaykh
zeyen zayn talant, im aropbrengen in der Russisher
hoyptstot un der barimter Russisher folkshrayber Glieb
Uspienski (Lev Ouspensky?) zol im araynfirn in di beste
Russishe journaln fun di narodnikes..

A complex man.  Worth getting to know.

Subject: Song festival

The Jewish Music Commission is presenting the 1992 American
Jewish Song Festival on Tuesday Nov. 17, 7:30 pm at Valley
Beth Shalom synagogue, 15739 Ventura Blvd. in Encino, CA.
The concert will consist of the top 14 of 350 songs that
were entered by talented Jewish composers into a nationwide
competition.  The top three songs will be chosen at this
performance. Tickets can be obtained by calling (818)
788-6000.

Now, you may well ask why this should be of interest to
Mendeleniks. Well, at least one of these entries is a
Yiddish song.  The one such entry that I am aware of is the
result of a collaboration between Gitl Schaechter-Viswanath
and Binyumen (Ben) Schaechter.  I don't know how many
original Yiddish compositions are produced in this day and
age, but I am sure that there are not very many of them.
So, I think such efforts which help in keeping Yiddish a
living language are well worth supporting.

Meylekh.

Subject: Daytsh

Yitzchak Kertesz in Mendele 2.93:

 >>few pages on mashkes. More for Mr. Prager: Thanks for
 >>correcting my pseudo-litvak "Deytshen" to Galitzianer
 >>"Daytshen".

Sorry, Reb Itzik, in my experience the litvak says "Daytsh"
---- Poylisher in Galitzianer pronounce it "Dahtsh"
