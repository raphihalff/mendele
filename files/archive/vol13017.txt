At the Arbeter Ring Camp Hofnung (Pipersville PA), we used to call the
children in the youngest bungalows "Kanariklekh)

Subject: kinder lidlekh

Here is the closest approximation I can manage after not hearing a song for
almost fifty years. (Sung as the baby is bounced up and down, legs
alternately flexed and bent in rhythm to the song).

Tanse a bissele
Leb a sakh
Hub a tibbele mit a dakh
Tanse a bissele
Leb a sakh
Leyben zol der kind a zakh.

Can someone put the right words to this charmer?

Subject: Nit gedayget

Jascha Kessler pointed out (13.016) that "The Communist camp in the 30s at
Beacon, NY, was called Camp Nit Gedayget...or Camp Carefree, in English [or
Sans Souci in French]."  (See also the discussion in vol. 5 of MENDELE and
the text of what was presumably the camp song in 8.101). The Soviet poet
Vladimir Mayakovsky, who visited there several times in 1925, wrote a poem
in Russian called "Kemp Nit Gedayge," and Perets Markish wrote an epic poem
and a play about Jewish collective farmers called "Nisht gedayget."

Subject: Yiddish Biographical Dictionary

Call for contributors

I am at present editing a Biographical Dictionary of Yiddish Writers, which
will appear in early 2005 as part of the series _Dictionary of Literary
Biography_, published by Bruccoli Clark Layman.

This distinguished series has already published 278 volumes covering
different languages and geographical areas, and the Yiddish volume will fill
an important gap in the history of world literature.

A number of eminent scholars have already contributed essays on important
Yiddish writers, but many great names in our literature have not yet found
biographers. In consequence, I have been obliged to ask the publishers to
extend the deadline for the delivery of the completed manuscript to enable
me to appeal to all scholars and researchers to contribute to this important
project.

While there are a number of different reference works that cover similar
ground, each addresses a different readership. Yiddish literature needs
to be made widely known to as many different kinds of reader as can be
reached.

Essays should be between six and eight thousand words, and should
contain a comprehensive bibliography, especially of works available in
English translation. Each essay should aim to be as comprehensive and
authoritative as possible, and should seek to address both an informed
and a lay readership.

The deadline for all contributions, which will be paid for by the
publishers, is the end of June 2004.

If you are interested in contributing an essay on one of the authors
listed below, please contact me personally at the following e-mail
address:

joseph.sherman@oriental-institute.ox.ac.uk

I shall be happy to supply you with all the relevant information, style
guides and schedule of payment. I look forward to hearing from you.

The authors who still need biographers are as follows:

Sholem Asch
Moyshe Broderzon
Peretz Hirshbeyn
Dovid Hofshteyn
Leyb Kvitko
Zishe Landau
Moshe Nadir
Leyb Naydus
Der Nister
Yoysef Opatoshu
Yehoshua Perle
Dovid Pinski
Avrom Reyzen
Eli Shekhtman
Eliezer Shtaynbarg
Y.Y. Trunk
Yehoash

I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: a yidishe hagode

I attended the Workmen's Circle Shule in the 1960's where we always had a
seder conducted entirely in Yiddish.

So check the Workmen's Circle---perhaps they still have Yiddish haggadahs. A
few years ago, I also saw them at the National Yiddish Book Center.

Zayt gezunt.

Subject: Yiddish blogs

I'm sure that many Mendelistn are already aware of the existence of blogs
written in mameloshn.  Those who have not yet done so might have a look at
these four:

http://www.israblog.co.il/blogread.asp?blog=5801 (Sholem Berger)
http://www.israblog.co.il/blogread.asp?blog=1782 (Katle Kanye)
http://www.israblog.co.il/blogread.asp?blog=7203 (Noam Starik)
http://www.israblog.co.il/blogread.asp?blog=29254 (Bar Pakhti)

The first three are writers of quality and their Yiddish is a joy to read.
All have deep roots in the haredi/hasidic world, so you should expect to run
across more Hebrew and Aramaic phrases than you do in, say, a YIVO bulletin.
What they have to say is of the greatest interest and, particularly in Katle
Kanye's case, is said with style and wit. Noam Starik is very well-informed
about Yiddish literature and an array of other matters. Sholem Berger's deft
hand is familiar to us on Mendele but no less welcome for that.  Highly
recommended.

There is one more blog worth mentioning:

http://www.israblog.co.il/blogread.asp?blog=27529&year=2004&month=3
(a yidisher farbrengung). This is a bulletin board with an assortment of
mostly haredi writers, talents and points of view.  It affords a glimpse
into a Yiddish-speaking world we know about but seldom visit.

There are other blogs or bulletin boards available and perhaps we'll hear
about the rest in time.

Those I've mentioned are displayed best in Internet Explorer.
