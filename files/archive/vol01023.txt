Subject: RE: Vol 1.22 

See what I get for not proofreading my stuff? It was
just too late at night. In any event, two corrections:
1.  In Western Yiddish, it is intervocalic "b" that
doesn't occur. 2. The Litvak in me got the better of
me: I meant to propose a "tsEzamenfor"and not a
"tsUzamenfor". Woe is me. Mikhl.

Subject: letter to editor
 
Dear Noyekh Shames,
I don't normally react to the misinformation, stereo-
types, condescension, etc. often meted out to Yiddish
in the Israeli press, but this time -- because the
source was serious and the errors were not enormous --
I did write a letter to the editor.  The subject of the
relationship of Yiddish to Zionism is an important one.
I understand that someone at JTS is doing a thesis on
it.  I have a few things to say on the subject and
would like to hear from others about it.  Here is my
letter:
 
Editor, The Jerusalem Post
The Jerusalem Post Building
Romema, Jerusalem, POB 81 (91000)

Dear Editor:

There are several generalizations which call for quali-
fication in Sam Lehman-Wilzig's capsule history of
Hebrew in the June 7th issue of Contact; The
Jerusalem Post Magazine. The author correctly
notes that "The impact of Yiddish is evident throughout
Israel to this day," but less correctly continues:
"precisely because it was identified so closely with
the Diaspora and persecution, Yiddish was ideologically
unacceptable to any self-respecting Zionist.  Indeed,
because the vast majority of immigrants were fleeing
bitter experiences in their countries of birth, they
enthusiastically embraced Hebrew upon arrival" (p. 23).

Yiddish was a threat in the eyes of the militant Hebra-
ists because it long continued to be the language of
daily domestic use of the majority of the Yishuv.  Only
a minority of immigrants "enthusiastically embraced
Hebrew upon arrival."  Hebrew proved victorious over
Yiddish largely because it early dominated the kinder-
gartens and primary schools.  Parents learned Hebrew
from their children while continuing to speak Yiddish
to one another -- this was the general pattern.  Many
immigrants from East Central Europe never learned
Hebrew well and continued for years to speak German,
Polish and Hungarian. Only a small minority of immi-
grants to Israel rejected their native languages to the
degree of effecting a complete shift to Hebrew.  They
usually employed Hebrew for certain purposes only and
they distinguished between the antisemitsm of their
native lands and its language and high culture.  One of
the greatest Hebrew and Yiddish scholars this country
has ever known, the late Professor Dov Sadan, enjoyed
nothing better than conversing in Polish with fellow
Polish-Jews.  He was not atypical. Many German Jews
refused to break with the language of Goethe and Heine,
though there were certainly also those who refused to
speak German after leaving Germany or Austria.  I know
a German-Jewish couple who, not yet knowing Hebrew very
well, shifted to English to avoid German.  I am not
aware of any statistical studies of this subject but I
believe it is safe to say that under almost any circum-
stances the acquisition of a new language by an adult
is difficult and not likely to be an occasion for
celebration.

Mr. Lehman-Wilzig has also somewhat distorted the
relationship between the Zionist movement and Yiddish.
Certainly not all Zionists saw Yiddish as "ideological-
ly unacceptable." Most particularly, members of the
Left Poalei-Zion, led by such distinguished person-
alities as Zrubovl {Jacob Zerubovel}, would have been
shocked to learn that they were not "self-respecting
Zionists."  The Yiddishist Zrubovl was, among other
things, one of the founders of the Jewish self-defense
movement in the Diaspora, whose members spoke and
valued Yiddish.  The equations Yiddish = Diaspora and
Diaspora = Evil were never universal in the Zionist
movement.  Moreover, despite the militant Hebraist's
conscious hostility, Yiddish never left him -- it was
too deeply engrossed in his soul.

Sincerely yours,

Dr. Leonard Prager

Subject: RE: A gentle prod from Mendele

My name is Frank Silbermann.  I am an assistant profes-
sor of Computer Science at Tulane Universitiy in New
Orleans. During my two years of German as an undergrad-
uate at U of Florida, I became facinated by my older
sister's books on comparative linguistics. After col-
lege, I tried to pick up other Germanic languages on my
own. I quickly gained a reading knowledge of Yiddish
and Dutch, but gave up the idea of easily learning the
Scandinavian languages, as these are less closely
related.  My capability in Yiddish was magnified in
recent years by my progress in Biblical Hebrew, which I
have been absorbing by daily minyan attendance
(synogogue services).

I never heard any Yiddish in the home, though my father
spoke Yiddish as an alien in Germany until the age of
10 (when his family fled to Belgium). My mother's
family came to America at the very beginning of the
East European immigration, and tended to identify more
with the German-speaking Jewish immigrants.  Her gener-
ation had already lost all knowledge of German or
Yiddish.

Subject: introduction

Jewish guilt does work so here is my attempt at an
intro.  I am a professor of psychology at City College
of New York with a specialty in psychological measure-
ment and statistical methodology.  I am first genera-
tion, my folks both having been born in Russia, coming
here at the ages of 4 and 7.  One would think that this
would have given me a rich liguistic background. 
Unfortunately, the contrary is true.  Russian was never
spoken, and Yiddish when the children were not to
understand. The result is that I have a pretty good
store of Yiddish sayings, aphorisms and curse words,
but absolutely no ability to read or write the lan-
guage, which I really regret and had hopes that this
list would be of some help with that.  I did study
Hebrew, both privately (along with an abortive attempt
at Yiddish) ages 10 -15 (went back after bar mitzvah to
study RASHI) and also studied Hebrew in high school. 
The result was that at one time I was fluent in both
Biblical anmd modern Hebrew -- an ability that has
seriously declined with advancing age.

So I am here for what I can learn from you folks--a
great deal of it is over my head -- but I keep trying. 
Would love some learning aids -- someone did suggest
the YIVO-Columbia summer workshop, but unfortunately I
do not have the time to attend that.  At this point
point, I do find that the list keeps me in touch with
Yiddishkayt in a way I did not anticipate but am thank-
ful for. So you will probably not be receiving much in
the way of learned discourse from me, but rather a dumb
question from time to time. Thanks to all, and again, I
would appreciate any and all suggestionms with regard
to the study of Yiddish --especially those I could
follow at home using tapes, books etc.

Len
