Subject: Introduction

As an introduction, I was brought up at the periphery of the 'Borscht Belt' in
a little town called Kerhonkson, New York in Ulster County during the period
between the two World Wars. My father bought a hotel called the Granite
Orchard Hotel. It had an orchard and the ground upon which it stood was
granite rock. My Grandparents, who spoke no English, lived with us.  My parents
were the breadwinners and my grandparents raised me.  Yiddish was my first
language. It was during these formative years that Yiddish played a most
important role in my life.  I remember the bonfires where we roasted
marshmallows and sang Yiddish songs; I remember the mock marriages in which
the bride was a male that looked eight months pregnant, the groom was a pretty
girl wearing a mustache, the wedding party was cross-dressed and my
Grandfather was the rabbi who performed the wedding ceremony in Yiddish; I
remember the Black singer wearing a red shirt and blue bandanna who sang songs
in impeccable Yiddish; I remember the actors from Second Avenue who would
perform in the round reciting Yiddish poetry and performing short plays after
which they passed the hat; and I remember being excited when the hotel booked
Aaron Lebedoff and his rendition of Romania, Romania.

I am recording these memories for my grandchildren and would appreciate
hearing from anyone who lived through that period and went to a hotel, rooming
house (kokhaleyn} or bungalow colony and has a story to tell.

Subject: I.B. Singer's _In My Father's Court_

un mit a glossar fun verter vos me ken nit gefinen in di verterbikher fun

I have just received a new collection of stories by Isaac Bashevis Singer in
Yiddish. The stories in _My Father's Court_ have been selected by Khone
Shmeruk, emeritus professor of Yiddish Studies in Jerusalem. He has also
written the introduction (printed in Yiddish and English). The volume has been
edited by Vera Solomon (in YIVO-spelling). The glossary provides a list of the
words and expressions that cannot be looked up in the Yiddish-English
dictionaries of Weinreich and Harkavy.

This book is part of the excellent series "Yiddish Literature" published by
the Yiddish Department at the Hebrew University and I.L. Magnes Press,
Jerusalem.

Subject: Sholem Aleichem reading available for download

The Yiddish Voice radio show in Boston is pleased to make available to the
general public, via the internet, the recording of Sholem Aleichem reading
excerpts from "If I Were Rothschild" and "A Happy Holiday" ("ven ikh bin
rotshild" and "a freylekher yontev"), which were  originally published on '78
RPM disks over 75 years ago.  We obtained our copy from the YIVO Institute
(New York) Sound Archive.  We arranged for it to be professionally digitally
remastered, and aired it on our program, 1 May 1996, in honor of Sholem
Aleichem's yortsayt.

To hear the recording, you need to point your web browser to

	http://world.std.com/~yv/

You will also need the RealAudio player, which is available for PCs and Macs
from

	http://www.realaudio.com/

We hope to bring more exciting Yiddish sounds via our web site in the near
future.  We hope you enjoy this important link to the past.  We would also
appreciate your comments and feedback; see our web site for full contact
information.

Subject: Yiddish desktop software

Since the demise of the ostralishe yiddishe nayes last year a group of
enthusiasts including myself have been preparing a new Yiddish publication to
be called Oyfs Nay. We have however a technical problem. We require a desktop
publishing program to produce the paper. Dagesh and similar are wordprocessors
and are not suitable for what we want to do. We are aware of a Hebrew version
of Quark Express for Macintosh. However we are seeking IBM PC based software.

Subject: Robeson in Yiddish

In the newsletter distributed by the Circle of Yiddish Clubs, an umbrella
organization for the Yiddish Clubs of South Florida, the following item of
interest appeared:

"A restored recording of a 1949 Moscow concert by the late American singer,
Paul Robeson, recently discovered in the Soviet Union, is being released on CD
in the U.S. and Europe. Robeson ended the concert, which was held during the
height of Stalinist anti-Jewish persecution, with a passionate appeal against
anti-Semitism, with a song he sang in Yiddish to a surprised and reportedly
moved audience."
