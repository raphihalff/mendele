Subject: Long and short vowels

Bob Poe's interest in long and short vowels could best be satisfied by
reading Chapters 7 and 9 of Max Weinreich's _History of the Yiddish
Language_.

As for the "scenario" in which he attempts to reconstruct the process of
phonological development, he makes some good inferences, assuming that he
is actually starting from ground zero. But, why start from ground zero?
America has already been discovered! A new voyage of discovery can be fun
but, it would be safer to take earlier discoveries into account.

For example, go to:

i) Max Weinreich, _History of the Yiddish Language_, Chicago, 1980,
Chapters 7 and 9.

ii) Marvin Herzog, _The Yiddish Language in Northern Poland: Its
Geography and History_, Bloomington and The Hague, 1965, Chapters 5 and
6.

iii) _Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry_, Volume I,
Tuebingen, 1992, Editor's Summary, pp. 34-35.

Finally, to one of Bob Poe's questions: It is, in fact, the case that in
part of Southeastern Yiddish, the words are _ile_ 'all' and _ilemul_
'always', but there is no reason to think that they are derived from
_ale_.

As in a number of other cases in Yiddish, we may have to posit a
proto-doublet from which to derive the known variants (as, for example,
the variants, Northeastern Yiddish _klaybn_ and Southern Yiddish
_kloybn_/_klubn_ 'to gather'). They are not derivable from one another.
(If anyone has access to the _Deutscher Sprachatlas_, please check the
map for _alle_. Is there, perchance a recorded German variant that would
help a account for Yiddish _ile_?

Subject: Intonation

In my recent message to Philologos, which he was kind enough to publish
in full, I posed 6 explicit questions. I've only read his reply to three
of them. I know that there's more to come, and I wonder if he addresses a
7th, implicit question, unstated in the hope that he'd pick up on it: the
origin of the three sentence sequence, which I repeated with different
intonation patterns--

a) You were _right_! I was _wrong_! I should _apologize_!
b) _You_ were right? _I_ was wrong? _I_ should apologize?

The setting is a meeting of the Comintern in the Kremlin. Stalin rushes
in, gleefully waving a telegram which he had just received from Trotsky.
It read

"you were right stop I was wrong stop I should apologize"

Saying "I've been vindicated," Stalin read, aloud,

"*You* were right! *I* was wrong! *I* should apologize! Trotsky."

"Wait a minute," said Kaganovich, his brother-in-law, the only
Yiddish-speaking member of the Comintern, turning the whole thing on its
head, "let *me* read it to you: "*You* were right? *I* was wrong? *I*
should apologize? Trotsky."

Need I say more? Only that the study of Yiddish intonation, the
comparative study of the intonation patterns of various Jewish languages,
and of both in the context of the intonation patterns of _lernen_, of
_gemore nign_, etc. is one of the major jobs that begs to be done before
it's too late. The ability of certain Yiddish intonation contours, like
those of gemore-nign, to convey meaning independently of the words that
accompany them, is a unique feature of the language. (As an example, take
Uriel Weinreich's article on the so-called Rise-Fall Intonation: "This is
coffee?" It takes a Yiddish (influenced) speaker or a New Yorker to read
that one properly--declarative word-order with interrogative intonation.

Or, closer to home, remember the passage in Eliyohu Juni's recent
eloquent, if controversial posting, which he marked for reading with the
appropriate gemore intonation? How could anyone know what the appropriate
intonation pattern was? Because of the nature of the argument. In other
words, if we know the nature of the argument, we can convey it with the
intonation pattern alone; if we know the intonation pattern, we can infer
the nature of the argument. Take a so-called _kal vekhoymer_, for
example.

Eliyohu, this is a job for you. I'm sure that it would earn you some
_oylem-habe_.

Enough for today; for the month, perhaps.

Subject: Yiddish and language loyalty

I am interested in the question of Yiddish language loyalty, in
comparative context, as a way of evaluating Jewish acculturation to
America. I have gone through Joshua Fishman's Yiddish in America and his
Language Loyalty and remain perplexed. [my limitation, not JF!]

A key problem of course is the census question on mother tongue,
introduced in 1910 and routinely repeated thereafter, except I believe
for 1950. While this is the best comparative datum, we are left with a
great deal of subjectivity and ideology. I would be grateful for
references to the historical and social scientific literature as well as
personal wisdom from various sources.

Subject: Bekesha vs. kapote

A couple of months ago, in response to the "khopt im" discussion, I
posted a note using the word "bekeshe", denoting the long black
khasidishe coat. Another expression is "kapote". Are these two terms
interchangeable? If so, why two terms?  Are they sectional?
