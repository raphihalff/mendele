Subject: Origins of a Russian Antisemitic Slur

In an article I was reading recently about Russian politics today (and a
disturbing picture it painted!), the author noted the prevalence among
the antisemitic Russian far right of the phrase "people who mispronounce
the letter 'r'" as a derogatory expression for Jews.  When I read this, I
assumed the origin of this slur was the difference between the Yiddish
"r" which is pronounced in the back of the throat [linguists, pardon my
discription of pronounciation . . .

I'm sure there's a more proper terminology] and the Russian "r" which is
pronounced by tapping the tongue behind the teeth. Upon further
reflection, however, I realized that Russian Yiddish speakers I have
heard pronounce Yiddish "r"s like Russian "r"s.  Like most invidious
ethnic stereotypes, I assume that Jews mispronouncing Russian "r"s is a
false generalization with its roots in some real, observable phenomenon.

So the questions for my fellow Mendelniks are:  1) What is the
geographical distribution of Russian-style "r" pronounciation among
Yiddish speakers? 2) If Yiddish speakers in Russia pronounce their "r"s
as Russians do, what is the origin of this antisemitic slur?

Subject: Borkhes

This evening I had dinner with an elderly Jewish couple from the
Rhineland. They reported that the word khala was unknown to them until
they come to this country. The word for the twist bread in the
grandparant's home was borkhes. However there was an important caveat:
borkhes was explicitly and exclusively milkhig. Is that a local
idiosyncratic usage or is that the proper common understood
qualification?

Subject: "frankraykh frest yidn" & "gliklekh vi got in frankraykh"

Does any mendelyaner out there know the origin of an expression I've
heard--"frankraykh frest yidn"--referring to the rapid assimilation of
French Jewry?  Has anyone else even heard the expression?

Also, how German do people feel "gliklekh vi got in frankraykh" is?  Does
it have real yikhes in Yiddish?

Subject: "geooghit" ?????

Dan Leeson:

How do you pronounce this word?  Can you describe its pronunciation
relative to the sounds of other, more familiar, Yiddish words?

Subject: Western Yiddish

I would like to thank Rick Gildemeister for the apology on Vol. 4.227. I
am glad you understood the reason why I felt I had to react. I didn't
mean to write twice; my first posting somehow disappeared on its way to
the shames only to arrive five days later.

Subject: Yidishe tsaytungen

Last week I finished my first semester of Hebrew, but I am afraid my
Yiddish has suffered a little bit.  Afraid of creeping Germanisms, I
thought it best to write in English.  I thought it would be good to
improve my Yiddish with a subscription to a newspaper.  Could anyone
blitzl me information about addresses, rates, &c. of some Yiddish
periodicals?

mayn kumindekes blitzl shrayb ikh oyf yidish.

[A comprehensive list of Yiddish publications in Israel was put together
by Leybl Botvinik and is in the archives under the filename:
"periodicals_israel.faq"  It can be downloaded via anonymous ftp.  It
would be a great service to all if we had a comparable list for other
parts of the world. nm]

Subject: Pareve/rotwelsch

Nit fleysh, nit milkh --_pareve_

This word seems to be a hard nut. Two proposals: Harkavi meynt s`iz
efsher fun daitsh "bar", milhokhdaitsh "par", vos heyst "naket, pust, on
inhalt".

Bernstein meynt az es kumt fun polnish "parowy" (= gedaempft, i.e. cooked
in steam, neither with butter, nor with lard) nit mit puter un nit mit
shmalts.

Rotwelsch is the german thieves` Latin, the language of the underworld.
Rot meaning beggar and welsch - foreign, incomprehensible language.

Subject: Lite/Raysn

When Dovid Braun points out the distinction between Lite and Raysn, I
certainly agree; Moyshe Kulbak's marvelous poem "Raysn," for example,
about generations of lumberjack Jews in the forest primeval, certainly
depicts White Russia rather than Lithuania. (But does anyone know more
about the origins of the name "Raysn," and to what extent it designated
an area that overlaps with today's "Belarus"?)

But when Dovid wants to prove his case by citing Mordkhe Schaechter, that
two of the four lands of the Council of the Four Lands were "definitely"
Lite and Raysn, I must disagree. The "lands" of the Council were Great
Poland (western Poland), Small Poland (western Galicia), Red Russia
(eastern Galicia and Podolia, i.e., Ukraine), and Volhynia (northern
Ukraine). While early in its history, the Council also represented
Lithuania, from 1623 there was a separate Lithuanian Council (with no
mention of "Raysn," so far as I know).

In general, this is all extremely complicated business, because
geographical terms such as "Lithuania/Lite" not only designate
not-necessarily-overlapping areas, with, of course, different cultural
significance for, e.g., Jews, Poles and Lithuanians, but in each case
there seems considerable variation in these meanings/designations over
time. The Polish designation "kresy" (borderlands) sums it up best, I
suspect, but that doesn't make all the other terms go away.
