Subject: Ukrainian songs

Thanks to Robert Rothstein for the Ukrainian song -- was
hoping someone would come up with a source for me (and was
actually expecting that *you* would).  I don't know Slavic
folklore collections well. Here's the actual text of the
Slavic song with the same melody, transliterated into the
Yiddish system and with (assumably) Yiddish phonology since
I know it from a Yiddish-dominant non-speaker of Ukrainian:

        pshiekali panyetshi
	ritshenike upyetshi
		(2x)
	hop moyey ritsheniki
	hop moyey yatshni
	hop moyey ritsheniki 
	nyebi vishli smatshni

Would you mind telling me what dialect of what Slavic lg
this is and what is the exact meaning.  Will be much
obliged.

Learning Yiddish by tape can be done, at considerable
expense yet with considrable pleasure, from the
book/cassette series _Shalom Yiddish_ produced a number of
years ago in France and available for English- and
French-speaking learners.  Written by Yitskhok Niborski and
Dvoyre Kosman.  Costs over $100 because you're also getting
some 25 cassettes with two graphically attractive volumes
of text.  Don't know who the distributor is in France or
USA, but I know the League for Yiddish, Inc. has it on its
list of available Yiddish resources.  The address:

        League for Yiddish, Inc.
	200 West 72 St.
	New York, NY 10023
	Phone:  212/787-6675

The series is very lively and recommended.  Niborski is a
very, very popular Yiddish teacher in Paris.

Most of this is beyond me.  But as for imprecations...
Bialik, who, of course as you know, spoke Yiddish, was once
conversing with Ravnitzki in Yiddish, on the streets of Tel
Aviv.  A young lad criticized him for not using Hebrew.  At
which point Bialik switched to Hebrew and told him "Lech
Le'Azazel," loosely: Go to the devil.  When his cursing was
reported to the authorities, Bialik explained that
biblically Azazel refers to a place, not to the demon who
dwells there, and since the place is close to Jerusalem, he
was merely advising the lad to take a little stroll!

Israeli students wanting to learn Yiddish should consult
the Hebrew version of Uriel Weinreich's "College Yiddish".
It's called "Yidish LaUniversita".

From: zbarlev@sciences.sdsu.edu
Subject: two questions on yiddish:

(1) Is there an easier way to say "please" than _zai azoi gut_?
Can this expression be contracted in ordinary speech e.g.
to _za zoi gut_. Or is even _zai gut_ possible? Is _ish
bet_ ever used to request something, and/or that someone do
something?

(2) Is the diphthong _ai_ always contractable to _aa_ (long
_a_), in those dialects that have this change?  I've seen a
whole bunch of these _aa_ (i see much more yiddish in
transcription than i hear), but don't know if those who do
it, do it all the time. E.g. I know a lot of people say
_zaa gezint_, but do _vaan_ and _flaash_ (for "wine" and
"meat") occur as well?  In other words, is this across-the-
board sound-correspondance?

thanks for any help,

Zev Bar-Lev
