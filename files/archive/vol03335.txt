Subject: Yiddish films

In response to Rick Gildemeister's shock at viewing "The Light Ahead," a
film made in 1939 whose vision is that of Jews escaping the dark
superstitious shtetl for the "light" of the big city, in this case a
symbolic Odessa...

I certainly share the feelings.  But the film is a product of its times,
of the "Morgn Frayhayt" left.  It was written by "Frayhayt" columnist
Chaver Paver and acted by the "socially-conscious" New York dramatic
troupe Artef, whose members were doubtless CP-members and
"fellow-travellers."  It was only in such ideologically-crazed circles
that a radical version of Haskalah could still be proclaimed on the eve
of the Holocaust: the struggle of "progressive" light against
"reactionary,""clerical," "bourgeois" darkness.  This was a perspective
that ultimately saw Hitler and small-town balebatim on the same side,
facing the storming world proletariat.  On the eve of the Holocaust,
members of the Artef were attending rallies for Birobidzan, etc., etc.
On the other hand, the film does feature the memorable laments of Isadore
Cashier as Mendele, who, despite the ideologically-correct plot, manages
to contemplate the fate of East European Jews with powerful dread, and in
general steals the show.  As usual with politically correct art, it helps
to read between the lines.

For more on this and Yiddish film in general, J. Hoberman's "Bridge of
Light" is invaluable.  Also, Rick mentions purchasing Ergo versions of
Yiddish films. I don't know about their print of "The Light Ahead," but
their version of "The Dybbuk," which, because of an ordering error, I
recently had to show to a seminar class instead of the print produced by
the Brandeis Center for Jewish Film, was scandously shoddy, and ruined
the experience of viewing this masterpiece for the entire class.  Buyers
beware.

Subject: The light ahead

To Rick Gildmeister:

I enjoy your postings very much.  The film is,of course, based loosely on
Mendele Mokher Sforim's "FISHKE DER KRUMER and old man is meant to be
Mendele. The film is deliberately archaic in part because Mendele
according to the O so clever Sholem A. "THE GRANDFATHER OF YIDDISH LIT
and, the film had been in the works long before. If you don't know it,
you should see Hoberman's book on Yiddish film. I also love that film
and the actors are very photogenic.

Subject: A letter from Birobidjan Yiddish students

Dear Sirs,

We are fourth year students at the English/Yiddish department of the
Birobidzhan Teacher's Training Institute.

We have been studying Yiddish for three years but our knowledge of
Yiddish is very poor. We have many problems, such as no text books, and
no real Yiddish specialist. We are to become teachers of Yiddish but our
teacher and we are anxious about our level of knowledge in this language.

In spite of the fact that Birobidzhan is a centre of Jewish culture in
Russia only some people in our town can speak Yiddish. When our
department was established we were supposed to revive Jewish cultural
life. Now there are only 16 people left in the department, we are waited
for in the Jewish school in the newspaper, on the local radio and TV.
Unfortunately we are the first and now the last (the following students
study French instead of Yiddish) to seriously study Yiddish at BGPI.

Can you provide us with textbooks (We can use books for English -
speaking students). We would like to attend Yiddish courses and / or
seminars. We know English and can attend lectures in English. We have
heard that there are such summer courses for foreign students learning
Yiddish.

We would like to know more about these programs. We want to take
advantage of every possibility to learn the language. Please, inform us
at your earliest convenience if it is possible to improve our knowledge
of Yiddish, Jewish history, culture and tradition.  We wish to develop
cooperations with you.

Faithfully yours,

the students of Birobidzhan's Yiddish department

David Krumm

Subject: Russian Jewish Accent

Someone in the Opera listserver group posted the following:

For anyone who is still interested in the gutteral pronunciation of
 the letter"R" among some Russian Jews...

My Russian Jewish colleagues and I are having HEATED (typically
 Russian) discussions this morning about the subject. Most of us
 believe that it is learned, passed on from generation to generation.

A few believe that it is a genetic defect among some Russian Jews. I
 have a difficult time with the defect notion. Some of these
 people are able to pronounce "R" in other languages correctly.

One opinion, with which I have to agree, is that originally Russian
 Jews spoke Yiddish at home, which uses a gutteral "R". Then they
 kept that pronunciation when they started speaking Russian. That
 just seems more logical. Most Russian Jews who live in the larger
 cities, i.e. Moscow, Leningrad, pronounce it correctly with a
 "rolled R".

Do any Mendeleniks have comments?
