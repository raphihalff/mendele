Subject: What happy, happy Jews?

     Ted Steinberg (Mendele, 4.022) was quick to react to Dan Leeson's
remark (Mendele 4.019) about "pussy foot Tevye the Milkman story about
happy, happy Jews in good old Russia."  I agree that the remark sounds
like a sneering slam at Sholem Aleichem.  It suggests a portrayal of
Sholem Aleichem as an ignoramus who painted a romanticized, travel-poster
view of Jews living in some idyllic shtetl.  I cannot know whether Dan
Leeson meant to convey that.  I can't read minds.  In any case, that idea
is poppycock.  Still, that kind of misrepresentation of Sholem Aleichem
as a simple fellow, a local yokel, persists despite manifest evidence to
the contrary.  Fiddler on the Roof may have something to do with it, but
this problem antedates Fiddler on the Roof (1964).

     Of course, the Tevye stories unfold tragic consequences of Jewish
intergenerational conflicts in a hostile environment in stormy, dangerous
times in 19th century czarist Russia.  Hardly happy, happy Jews.
Further, few people are aware of Sholem Aleichem's sharp protests against
constrictive customs of his day. Fewer even are aware of the political
satires he directed at czarist folly in the struggle for a constitution,
and in the Russo- Japanese war.  Sholem Aleichem himself was probably not
aware that he was put under surveillance by the Russian secret police.
Romanticizing life under the czar would not have brought _that_.

     In fact, Sholem Aleichem was a complex artist with knowledge of the
best of the world's literature in Russian translation, and aware in depth
of the flowering Russian literature of his time.  He worked to meet those
high standards.  Sholem Aleichem was not a shtetl bumpkin.  That should
not have to be said now.  However, misperceptions by early critics
persist.  Early critics could not believe that writing which flowed as
easily as Sholem Aleichem's Yiddish could be considered "literature."  At
best, some thought him a talented primitive.  Truer appreciation of
Sholem Aleichem developed after his death in 1916, but it was a slow
process, and still needs work, apparently.  Consider, for example,
Trunk's statement as late as 1937.

My translation from Yiddish:

     "Intellectually, as objective judge of the life around him, Sholem
Aleichem stood not much above the masses.  As to the scope of his world
view, he was one of the 'little people' (kleyne mentshelekh).  No doubt,
these intellectual defects blocked Sholem Aleichem's avenue to his own
depth."  [Sholem Aleykhem, Zayn Vezn un Zayne Verk (Sholem Aleichem, his
Essential Nature and his Works), by Y.Y. Trunk, Warsaw: Kultur-Lige, p.
15.]

     Oy vey!  How's that for pompous claptrap?  An appreciation of other
great writers of Yiddish is possible without slamming Sholem Aleichem.
N'est ce pas?

DB> These names may be related to the Talmudic Aramaic name Zusya.

Is there such a Talmudic name? Can someone please provide a reference?

Subject: Sholem Asch

Dan Leeson inquires about the fate of Sholem Asch.  Literary fashions are
difficult to explain.  I own the complete works of Asch and I read him
every now and again with great pleasure.  His "The Man from Nazareth" and
"Mary", written without the usual "ptoo, ptoo, l'havdil" attitude earned
him tremendous scorn from a very wide community and books and essays have
been written about the "meaning" of his impulse to write on these
subjects.  He did not convert to Christianity.  I believe that most
people who were upset felt that given the history of Jewish suffering at
the hands of the Christian world, it was deeply insensitive to write
sympathetically about the icons of the Christian faith, especially in
Yiddish.  I don't think that he ever recovered from that episode. He died
in Israel, I believe, considerably less beloved than he might otherwise
have been on the basis of his other literary work.
