Subject: Yiddish orthography

to howie/itsik-ayzik:

i don't know if you're being tongue-in-cheek, but, if you're
serious, you gotta be kidding. first, standard yiddish orthography
corresponds to standard yiddish pronunciation: the reason there's a
vov in _gut_ is exactly that it's standardly pronounced /gut/, for
example. second, i wouldn't exactly say (except sarcastically) that
yivo 'arbitrarily chose basically a litvak norm'--the choosers were
basically litvaks! if they'd been basically galitsianer, standard
orthography might look very different... finally, i've never heard
that standard yiddish is disallowed on the stage; what i've heard
that's special about the stage is that teater-yidish is ALSO allowed
(except in the yiddish state theatre in moscow, as reported to me by
emil gorevits, where only standard yiddish is/was allowed).

------------------------

to moshe and others, re grobyan:

with all due respect to the erudition and wit of germans and slavs,
i have a lot of trouble believing that grubyan owes its origin to a
pun on latin. and, moshe, to say 'notwithstanding the place of the
accent' is to say a BIG 'notwithstanding'! how is the german
'grobian' stressed, btw? germanic stress patterns are very very
predictable and, if the german is stressed on the final syllable,
it's hard to believe that it's not a late borrowing from some other
language or else a compound noun.

Subject: Shnipishok; Patshutsh

Rick Turkel (MENDELE 3.081) refers to two places with funny-
sounding names, both of which really happen to exist. Shnipishok =
Snipiskis, a suburb of Vilna/Vilnius. Patshutsh = Buczacz/Buchach
(Yiddish:  Bitshutsh), a famous town in Eastern Galicia/Western
Ukraine, birthplace of the great Hebrew writer Shmuel Yosef Agnon
and the Polish Jewish historian Emanuel Ringelblum (who, among other
things, was a devoted Yiddishist and contributor to pre-World War II
YIVO publications).

Subject: -ian

Re:  Beatrice Santorini's reply concerning -ian.  The idea that
there is probably a (common) Latin root sounds convincing.  And yet:
are Christian and grobyan (Grobian) --- grobianus --- on the same
level.  On the other hand: one never knows...

Subject: Introduction

My name is Bonne London as, as I have access to e-mail, I am
functioning as a shaliach for my good friend Mr. Charles Nadler.
Mr. Nadler is originally from New York but has been an active leader
in the Jewish community of Sacramento California for over 40 years.
He twice served as President of Congregation Mosaic Law and, with
his late wife Aileen,  was one of the founders of Kenesset Israel
Torah Center, the orthodox synagogue in Sacramento, where he also
served as President.   Mr. Nadler is the retired Dean of Instruction
of Sacramento City College.  In addition to training scores of
Sacramento children for Bar and Bat Mitzvah, he served as Hebrew
School Principal for the Sacramento Bureau of Jewish Education.  Mr.
Nadler is an active supporter of Chabad of San Francisco and Chabad
of Sacramento. He reads and speaks yiddish and for many years has
written a column "Yiddish Corner" for the Sacramento Jewish
newspaper.   Mr. Nadler can be reached by writing to
brlondon@ucdavis.edu.

Subject: Pushke

I've always assumed that _pushke_ is derived from the Polish
_puszka_ and let it go at that.  The other day however I ran across
a reference in Zangwill to a _pyx_ which resembles exactly the metal
box with a lock found in most orthodox shuls.  Pyx (<Lat <Gr), say
the dictionaries, is used for the sacramental bread of the Eucharist
and it's used for the storing of specimen coins at the Royal Mint.

Question: does _pushke_ or a related word first show up in eastern
Yiddish or does it have older, non-Slavic, roots and appear in
western Yiddish as well?
