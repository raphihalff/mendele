Subject: Introduction

My name is Gerald Gerger (Jerry). I live in the Detroit area which has a
rich Yiddish history and I speak and understand what is called
"Amerikanisher Yiddish". I am teaching myself to read and write the
"Mameloshn" and have a fierce interest in biblical history.  I am a
pharmacist (own my own pharmacy) ,work 3-5 days a week (a total waste of
time) and my wife is a social worker in private practice.  Am looking
forward to contributing "vos ikh ken" and taking "vos ikh darf". "Ich bin
fir und zekhtsik".

Subject: tam yak tut

My mother would say, of a food which didn't taste good, "Es hot a tam yak
tut". "Tam" means "taste" in Yiddish (from Hebrew, I suppose), but also
"here" in Russian, while "tut" means "there" in Russian, so "es hot a tam
yak tut" means, in Russian, "it has a here like there". I thought that
was pretty cute, and wonder whether she made up this little bilingual
play on words, or whether everyone's (Russian-Jewish) mother used it.

Subject: Zhe in the Slavic languages

Ellen Prince inquired (mendele 4.245) about the provenance of zhe in the
Slavic languages.

I am far from a native speaker of any Slavic language, but I read them
all (at least in chemistry) and speak some Russian and Serbo-Croatian.
As far as I know, the Russian usage of zhe is pretty close to that in
Yiddish.  My Polish-English dictionary shows examples with imperative
verbs but not with wh- words.  It doesn't appear at all in any of my
South-Slavic language dictionaries except Slovenian, which shows examples
of its use as an emphatic in all sorts of situations.

Subject: Zhe

Ellen Prince:

Ellen, there's also _nit shoyn zhe_, which is reminiscent of
Russian _ne uZe li_.  But note that the Yiddish _zhe_ is not taken
in toto from Slavic because the Slavic is _uZe_ 'already', corresponding
to the Yiddish _shoyn (zhe)_.

Subject: Bupkes

I have always used the word "bupkes" to mean a thing of little value, as
in "It is worth bupkes" meaning that the thing is worthless.

Where does the word come from?  Is there another meaning to it?  And is
there a  defecatory connotation to the word (such as in reference to the
childish phrase I would use, "Kuzze bupkes" meaning "Goat shit" although
I have no idea if that was an invented meaning or if it really meant
that. It is rather that everyone in the neighborhood used the phrase and
I sort grew to understand that that is what it meant.  No I am not at all
sure.

Subject: Leo Fuld's language

Now that we know where Fuld is probably from (Rotterdam) a number of
things fall into place. When he sings "Oyf de-ne-sidenyu" several verses
contain the Dutch future auxiliary, and the German-like "Zuk amol rebe".
In German it would be "Sag mal ..." whereas in the klal-shprakh you'd
probably say "zog-zhe nor, rebenyu". Also, his pronunciation of "Cohen"
is Kouen, until he gets to the refrain,where he says the standard Arn
ha-Koyen. An example of the future auxiliary is "Miryom hanevio zal fer
uns tantsn".

Altogether, I had a nice evening with Mr. Fuld yesterday, listening very
carefully to all the songs on the two cassette tapes I have of his.
