Subject: Yiddish as a foreign language

Perhaps Miriam Isaacs was being tongue-in-cheek but, lacking smileys, I shall
take her comments as serious. 

She writes: "But to look at Yiddish as a foreign language in Israel doesn't
work at all, because a foreign language would, I believe be more valued in
Israel than Yiddish. After all, a foriegn language would have with it a
country and an economy that would lend it some status. The metaphor that
comes to mind is that a foreign language is a chic Paris gown to Yiddish
being mom's battered housecoat. Of course this is not true for everyone but
seems to be a common attitude." 

Uh, first, many languages do not have a 'country and an economy' -- Basque,
Catalan, Rusyn, all the Romany (Gypsy) languages, Breton, etc etc etc.
Second, ask the average Sabra how chic s/he considers Polish, Bulgarian,
Hungarian, etc...

You were joking, right?

In any event, it doesn't really matter what it's called -- if Yiddish is to
be taught in the schools of Israel (outside of Mea Shearim), it will have to
be taught as a foreign language. Even if a number of the students taking it
have some prior familiarity with it, I hope we wouldn't want to prevent
curious Israelis of Moroccan or Greek or Iraqi or Indian background from
taking it as well... FWIW, most students at my university (in the US) taking
Hebrew have some prior relationship with it, same for Armenian, same for
Tamil, same for Korean. But they're still considered foreign languages and
must be taught as such.

Subject: Yiddish as a foreign language

Re: Ellen Prince's suggestions on teaching modern Yiddish. They sound good.
Are any of them happening in Israel now? 

I've not been to Israel. Are their Yiddish speaking communities all
religious? Do they all speak the same "Modern Yiddish"? Would competing YIVOs
sprout? (Not that Jews might have a few disagreements over their language...) 

I think the discussion is worthwhile. We worry that Yiddish is a patient on
life-support systems, and that the wrong medical procedure may finish her
off. Hopefully, she is hardier than we think, and will survive experimental
treatments, several of them wrong-headed.

Subject: yidish, present and past

If only Ellen Prince were right about Yidish being 'frozen in a sort of
'Victorian Yiddish' period' it would be a halbe tsore. The Yiddish spoken in
times bygone had one vital ingredient which is missing in modern secular
yidish: yidishkayt, the lifeblood of yiddish. Take it away and you have a
bland germanic dialect injected with heavy doses of slavisms to preserve the
ye olde flavour. 

I don't know how academic courses are ever going to convey the joys of the
allusions and idioms which are felt by anyone familiar with the classic texts
and customs. The tiny kotoynti that opens up toyvye the milkhiger means
everything to one familiar with yankev ovini's adventures but very little to
someone relying on glossaries or notes to get the meaning. And it's only one
example. 

As for Ellen's suggestion of bridge building, it's easier said than done. It
could happen but only when the so called guardians of yidish come down from
their ivory towers and realise that there are tens of thousands of yidelekh
out there actually speaking yidish albeit with mixed up der's and dos'es and
with a galitsyaner/karpatisher accent. On the other side of the fence the
yidish speakers will need to pop their heads round their ghetto walls, be
they physical or metaphorical, and appreciate that there are people out there
capable of teaching them the rudiments of their language. But this will
probably only come to pass shortly after the fulfilment of the prophecies of
wolves and sheep.

Subject: mendele - a kehile

A Khidish, oy, a khidish

In Mendele 8.041, way back on August 11, an assassination took place, and our
Mendele community merely slammed shut their windows95, ignoring its
happening.  The shattering terms "tseshterer, nisht boyer fun Yidish" and the
indictment "koylen di Yidishe shprakh" were flung at a treasured, most
valuable member of our kehile.

Noyekh Miller is a feast of a man - as humble as he is noble, sensitive but
powerful, inquisitive and inordinately knowledgeable, a fierce friend, a
devoted uplifting spirit, and a talented Herculean builder for Yiddish. 

Noyekh took the idealistic, Quixotic idea of a Yiddish network, with some 20
people to start, and like a two-eyed Moshe Dayan built it with his bare hands
into the Mendele we all profess to love, with some 1,600 subscribers today. 
For literature lovers, beyond the linguists and libhober, he fathered The
Mendele Review, before handing the reins to Iosif who so capably and
intelligently continues the tradition. 

And only our Londoner Hassid, the admirable Dovid Herskovic, in Mendele
8.043, stood up in Noyekh's defense - and even ordained him into rebbehood. 

I address this rusty resounding silence, most certainly not golden, that
occurs after such a posting. 

Is ignoring such mud-slinging a conscious act of censure? 

Is it an acting out of anger at the destructiveness of a posting? 

Where is the mentshlekhkayt that is inherent in Yiddishkayt? Don't we stand
up for each other? 

Or is all this talk of love of Yiddish and of Mendele just a flea-bite of
feeling after all?

Subject: Fogel, bird or flower?

Like Feigl I. Glasser I too was born with the name "Fogel" .  Although that
was (and is) my family name Feigel was just another pronunciation. Having
been raised Yiddish speaking I had no doubt that Fogel meant "bird"  I even
knew of Jewish Fogels changing their name to Zipporah (bird in Hebrew). 
Admittedly some Fogels changed to "Peleg".  I don't know why.  Probably
somebody can explain it to me. 

Imagine my surprise when the computer at the Museum of the Jewish Diaspora,
at my request gave me the following information. 

        FEIGEL,(FEIGE, FOGEL, VOGEL, FIGLER, FEIG , FIGEL)
        This name is originally derived from the German   "Veigelchen"
        or "Veigelmein". A popular first name amongst Jewish women
        meaning "Violet".  The phonetic change from "V" in German to 
        "F" in Yiddish led to the mistaken belief that the name
        Feigel came from the word meaning "Bird" or "Fig", or even
        that it was derived from the Hebrew name "Zipporah".

I must say that I personally prefer "Bird" .  Since I had no part in choosing
my name I take the prerogative of translating my name, "FOGEL"  as "BIRD". 
So there.  Just to confound the linguists.

Subject: Holeveshke

"Holeveshke" (which appears in Weinreich's dictionary) recurs quite
frequently in Ansky's paradistic narrative poem ASHMEDAI, which I'm in the
process of translating for my DYBBUK reader.  I've generally been rendering
it as "ember"--though th Yiddish item is somewhat bigger than th English
term.

Subject: Skarbove.

In responce to Yankel Kurtzman's inquiry (08.045:9):

U.Weinreich' Dictionary (p.515) reads: skarbove - commonplace, trite, stock.
In Russian "skarb" means "goods and chattels", "hob-un-guts", "shtubzakhn";
in some contexts - "dos bisl oremkayt".Here's an example of its usage:  "Ober
ale hobn fargesn az undzer laytish mame-loshn hot shoyn in ir skarbove zapasl
aza heymishn termin vi "finantsieler krumbanits", uav. [Gennady Estraikh "Me
shloft zikh nit...",Di pen, N.15, oktober 1995, p.35]. N.Stuchkoff lists
skarbove as synonymous with altmodish, altshteygerish (p.56), kazyone, banal,
ayngevortslt, normal (p.33), and nit-interesant, oysgedroshn (p.572).

Subject: YIVO Institute for Jewish Research - Closing dates

The YIVO Institute for Jewish Research wishes to inform its members and the
public that, in order to prepare for its move to the new Center for Jewish
History, the last day the Archives will be open to the public will be
Thursday, September 17, 1998, and the last day that the Library will be open
to the public will be Thursday, October 15, 1998.  (Interlibrary loan
operations will be suspended as of the latter date, as well.)  We regret this
inconvenience, but we look forward to better serving researchers in our new
facility at 15 West 16th Street, as of early Spring 1999.  We will keep the
public posted as the move develops.
