Subject: Matzo brei

I wonder if anyone out there knows where the "brei" of "Matzo brei" comes
from?  I've heard speculation that it's from a root meaning "to scald," or
perhaps related to German "braeu" (matzo brew?  I don't know anyone who drinks
the stuff).  My kids have been calling it "matzo fry," which is eminently
sensible.  If anyone knows the origin of this word or can refer me to an old
posting or FAQ on the subject, thanks very much.

Subject: Old Yiddish -s

As I recall Old Yiddish wrote shin rather than samekh for /s/.  I am wondering
if anybody knows of attestations of the plural ending -s being written this
way.  Please answer directly to amr@cs.wayne.edu rather than to the list.
Thanks.

Subject: _Mit Eyn Fus in Amerike_

In the 1940s or 50s Yuri Suhl wrote a novel _mit eyn fus in amerike_ which
appeared in serial form in di frayhayt.  I have a copy of the English
translation _One foot in America_ and its sequel _Cowboy on a wooden horse_.
Does anyone know if these books exist in yiddish, and if so, where they might
be obtained?

a sheynem dank,

Leon Greenberg

Subject: The Internet as a _gas_ for Yiddish

I recently had a discussion with Abe Luski, who is one of the leaders of the
Charlotte Yiddish Institute, about the future of the Yiddish language. He was
not too optimistic, and he made the statement: " A loshn muz hobn a gas."

After we parted, the thought occurred to me that the Internet might be
considered to be a sort of _gas_ where Yiddishists can communicate with each
other not only by e-mail, but also by using the "chat" capabilities to carry
on a conversation in writing.  And although this writing is now done mainly in
transliteration, it has been demonstrated that genuine Yiddish print can also
be transmitted.  Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that voice
communication over the Internet is also feasible.

So I see the possibilty of a real _gas_ developing in the not too distant
future. I wonder what my fellow Mendelyaners think about all this.

Subject: Two more daytshmerisms: "retn" and "yetst"

In my recent post "Der daytshmerism 'als' " (5.301,5) I audaciously pointed
out that in Leonard Prager's romanized reprint of Perets's editorial
"Hebreyish un Yiddish" the word "heiligkeyt" should have been romanized
_heyliket_ (with one /kuf/ and not with a double /kuf/) and that the
daytshmerism "als" should have been replaced, in this instance, with the
"kosher" Yiddish word "vi."

Now, In his "tkhine leyoldes" post (5.301,1 of April 16, 1996) Prager asks for
comments and, especially, for corrections of his romanized reprint of the
Yiddish text of _thkhine_ _leyoldes_ [women's prayer for a pregnant woman].

Here, too, as in his reprint of Perets's article, LP placed in parentheses his
spelling corrections to conform with the YIVO romanization, deleting so to
speak, or omitting, the unnecessary /ayens/ and /heys/ from the then
prevailing spelling (he did not indicate the year when this tkhine was
printed), as well as other necessary corrections, such as hant, shlisl, iret
vegn, undzere (instead of hand, shlisul, ihretvegen, unzere), and so on.

It is my impression that, while most of his romanizations are appropriate,
Prager missed to correct two daytshmerisms:  In changing "reten" to read
"retn" nothing much was helped since the verb "retn" is a daytshmerism.  It is
not listed in U. Weinreich's MEYYED.  Instead we find there the nouns "retung"
[rescue, salvation] and "reter" [savior], but both these words are marked with
a heavy dot, indicating that it is doubtful whether they are admissible in
standard Yiddish.   The people's folksy word for this term is _rAteven_, and
the cry for help in an emergency would haturally have been "Gevald Yidn,
rAtevet!"

All three words, the verb and both nouns, are found in Stutshkov's _Oytser_
(Group 446), but carry no wedge (Y. clin) to suggest their inadmissibility in
SY.  Is it possible that M. Weinreich, its editor, did not _pasl_ [reject]
them as daytshmerisms?

The other missed word for proper romanization is "yetst" (four times in the
text).  Similarly, the correction "yetstike" in place of "yetstige" is not
much of a help.

"Yetst" is listed in U. Weinreich with a wedge [clin], indicating
inadmissibility in SY.  "Yetst" is not listed at all in Harkavy who
practically included uncritically every spoken word in Yiddish he heard.   In
Stutshkov's Index the word "yetst" has an arrow to "itst" (group 76).  While
it carries no wedge, the arrow itself serves as a warning that it is not
recomended in SY (List of Abbreviation and Signs, p. LVI).

The Yiddish word for the daytshmerism "yetst" is _itst_, the most widespread
in use since the beginning of the 19th  century.

Prager wonders whether the expression in the tkhine "ploynis-_bas-_ ploynis"
[Mrs so-and-so _daughter_ of so-and-so] might indicate a matrimonial
identification.  I do not think such an inference is warranted.  The reference
to the mother of the soon-to-be mother is but a strengthening of the
supplication to the Almighty, a reminder if it were from years back:  As in
His rakhmones [mercy] He facilitated the delivery of her now pregnant
daughter, may His continued rakhmones shine upon the countenance of the yoldes
[pregnant woman] and may she deliver the baby _on tsar un on yesurim_ [without
grief and without pain].

Subject: _Dekarnose_

A puzzlement: What does _dekarnose_ mean?  First, a history:

Sholem-Aleykhem's damski shnayder (women's tailor), Shimen-Elye Shema-Koleynu
(Der Farkishefter Shnayder), is cowed by wife and the world.  His struggle to
hide his intellectual and other weaknesses is too frantic.  Overreaching, he
makes of himself a more pathetic fool than he really is.  To impress and
humiliate his relative, an unschooled tavern-keeper, he quotes for him (and
mangles) ersatz Jewish wisdom.   One repeated quotation resembles (I believe)
mock Aramaic.  This is it: askakurde debarbante defarshmakhte dekarnose (Ale
Verk fun Sholem-Aleykhem, Folksfond Oysgabe XVI: 19 and 24).  While each of
the four words contains an element resonating with meaning (cockade, drum,
languishing, snub-nosed) I thought it was mainly rhythmic gibberish in Yiddish
orthography.

This phrase, however, has echoes.  Tevye, no fool he, says something quite
similar in Hayntike Kinder: askakurde demaskante dekarnose defarsmakhte
(Folksfond Oysgabe V: 69-70).  The orthography is not modern Yiddish, but
seems to imitate the Hebrew-Aramaic style.  Tevye uses the phrase again in the
1915 play, Tevye der Milkhiker (Folksfond Oysgabe XXV: 177) but there most of
the orthography is closer to modern Yiddish style.  By the way, Leyzer-Volf
the butcher in Hayntike Kinder employs a karnose yidine (a snub-nosed Jewish
woman).

I gave up puzzling over this, trying to find connections, until one word in
letters larger and bolder than the surrounding letters jumped out at me from
page 13 in an old makhzer: _dekarnose_ or _dekornusa_.  It is spelled (without
nekudes) daled kuf reysh nun vov samekh alef.  This is exactly how it is
spelled in Hayntike Kinder.

Somebody suggested dekornusa might be a secret name for God.  Why did
Sholem-Aleykhem use it in such contexts?  He was a complex man and could be a
wily sender of a message to  _insiders_.

Any thoughts out there on dekarnose or dekornusa?
