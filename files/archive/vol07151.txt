Subject: Mendele's elitism

        The Jews are said to have been refugees from the island Of Crete
        who settled in the remotest corner of Libya in the days when,
        according to the story, Saturn was driven from his throne by the
        aggression of Jupiter.  This is a deduction from the name
        'Judaei' by which they became known: the word is to be regarded
        as a barbarous lengthening of 'Idaei', the name of the people
        dwelling around the famous Mount Ida in Crete. (Tacitus, _The
        Histories_, Book Five)

Tacitus would have felt right at home here on Mendele.

The current dust-up over language comes hot on the heels of a similar one just
a few months ago I think, and there have been several such in the past. They
seem to boil down to this: who the hell do these elitists (professors,
professionals, academics) think they are treating us proste yidn like
second-class citizens? To which I have this to say: 

1. First of all, forget this "professor" business.  Wrong label. Think instead
of specialists and non-specialists.  Almost everybody on Mendele, almost every
adult in the industrialized world for that matter, is a member of at least one
_community_ of specialists, i.e. people who by virtue of training and time
spent together have worked out sets of procedures, special vocabularies,
criteria for judging work, etc.  This applies to pants pressers as much as it
does to linguists.  And specialists who have spent a considerable amount of
time and effort learning the ropes of the etymology game are understandably
exercised when a latter-day Tacitus comes along with some nisht-geshtoygene
confection or other. (If you have trouble with that, just remember the way you
felt when someone totally unfamiliar with _your_ specialty reinvented the
wheel.) 

2. Are specialists never wrong then?  A question!  All the time. The history
of scholarship is largely a history of controversy over errors large and
small.  But even if many of these arguments may seem to the outsider to repeat
themselves in a sort of cycle (take the nature-nurture debates for instance)
in fact the _grounds_ on which these matters are debated get more
sophisticated from one cycle to the next and it therefore becomes increasingly
hard for a non-specialist to wade in with something useful.  Fact of life.  In
the 18th century it was possible for an autodidact like Benjamin Franklin to
become one of the leading "electricians" (physicists) of his day. Obviously
impossible now.  Conversely, a very smart and very learned professor like
Martin Bernal makes a fool of himself when he steps out of his field (_Black
Athena_) and comes up with etymologies every bit as absurd as the ones
recorded in Tanach or Herodotus. 

3. Mendele an academic forum?  Never.  True, it began with a largely academic
set of subscribers because, in 1990, few if any non-academics had access to
Bitnet olev-hasholem or the early Internet, but that's not the same thing. 
Mendele has always been open to the lovers and students of Yiddish and I hope
it always will be. 

4. But: open to _all_ students.  Which implies a civil reception for all,
including grammarians and dialecticians. Mendele doesn't require that its
writers be certificated intellectuals but it certainly prefers the writers of
books to those who shun or burn books. Populist anti-intellectualism is cheap
and demeaning, among Jews unthinkable.  Surely we can live without it. 

5. Finally, open to _all_ is not the same as open to _everything_.  Mendele
began as a place for the exchange of useful information and opinions.  Never
elitist, it has conscientiously shunned all mention of degrees, titles and
assorted campaign ribbons.  But it prefers quality to junk, seriousness to
vulgarity, lively debate to whining.  If that's elitist, so is the Forverts,
Yugntruf, Afn Shvel, and just about everything else except for the shmates
they sell in supermarkets.

Subject: The nature of Mendele

Herskovic and Fridhandler (et al, no doubt) both raise the issue of the nature
of Mendele, both pointing out the obvious that this is 'not a scholar's list'.
How true. However, both seem shocked that anyone might have ever thought such
a thing and rhetorically ask 'Says who? Since when?', figuratively if not
literally. Well, I must point out that this originally WAS, if not a
'scholar's list', at least a *serious* list -- that was its intent when it
split off from Mail.yiddish (or whatever it was called -- sorry), which has
since stopped operating, alas.

To those who feel that it's perfectly fine to propose (or, nokh beser, state
as fact) that some Yiddish word has this or that fantasized origin, may I ask
if you would feel it equally fine to announce to a chemistry list that fire is
produced by the movement of phlogiston? Or to announce to an astronomy list
that the moon is made of green cheese? Or to announce to a classicist list
that Latin is derived from Chinese? You may feel you are celebrating Yiddish
with your exhuberance -- but one could argue that you are denigrating it by
presuming that it, in contrast to all other human languages, takes neither
training nor knowledge to explain its history and structure. And, for the
record, contra Herskovic, I don't recall anyone ever criticizing anyone's
*question* on Mendele -- it's the *assertions* that have induced the gagging.
(And know that those who've gagged publicly are but a small percentage of
those of us gagging privately.) 

The Internet is 'a free country' and anyone can post whatever s/he likes to an
open list -- but those who are motivated by a desire for warm and fuzzy
feelings and who are guided by Herskovic's sentiment that 'Ignorance is bliss'
should not be surprised when some of the response is disgust.

Subject: Mayses/Maynses

Once again, a question coming from my grandmother:

Since she never learned to read Yiddish, my grandmother and others of her
generation learned Yiddish only by ear, and didn't speak it very regularly,
either.  So, there are various minute errors in her pronunciation.  Recently,
she told me that she saw a program on TV called "Bobe-Mayses,"  and she was
amazed to find out that there's no "nun" in mayse.  Moreover, all her friends
and peers of her age seem to share this misconception.  Why do non-literate
speakers think that "mayse" is pronounced "maynse?" 

Mit farlangen far a "Paks" Mendeleyaner :-),

Subject: Americanisms in Yiddish 

One frequently sees in Mendele attacks on anglicisms and americanisms in
Yiddish.  All languages, as far as I know, take from other languages, and
considering the history of the Jews, it is easy to understand why Yiddish has
taken more than most.  Why are Americanisms caused by let's say, 20th century
migrations to America somehow worse than slavicisms caused by late medieval
migrations to Eastern Europe? 

I would also like to know by what miracles of electronics, chemistry and
genetic engineering the idea of 'purity of language' (and prescriptive
linguistics in general) has been preserved in its moribund state among
Yiddishists long after other linguists have fed its decrepit corpse to the
vultures.  (I believe prescriptive linguistics is still being sponsored by
certain government agencies, but that is obviously not the case here.)  It is
comforting to know that Mendele now has a psychiatric social worker. 

Thank you.

Subject: Mark Twain in Yiddish

I want to thank everyone who sent me bibliographies of Mark Twain's books in
Yiddish, which are available in university libraries.  What I would like to do
is BUY books.  Though the National Yiddish Book Center once listed a few
books, none have been available to purchase.  Which I would still like to do,
especially now that I know about Mr. Twain's sentiments on copyright (NYTimes
Feb. 16). I have been presenting multi-lingual events for New Americans in
Yiddish-English-Russian, and Mr. Twain is a favorite of the Russians.  Living
here in Missouri now, I thought a Twain event would be interesting.

Subject: Needed:  Yiddish for "breastplate" 

What is the Yiddish word for the "breastplate" of a Sefer Torah?
Weinreich is not much use for these religious matters...

Subject: "shmok" and German art

Mendele is for those interested in Yiddish Language and Literature, but
sometimes a broader cultural view has something to add.  Marvin Herzog
recently wrote of the derivation for the word "shmok" (i.e. penis).
There are medieval German poems that refer to the penis as a serpent or tail,
but even more so are they equated in 16th century German art.

Subject: Swiss Yiddish

A variation of ``Swiss Yiddish'':

My dear aunt Jennie traveled often, as a tourist, from London to various
corners of the world.  When I asked what she ate (she kept kosher at home) and
spoke on her travels, she explained her morphology of cuisines and languages. 
She recognized three major categories of cuisine: English, Jewish, and
Chinese; French or Italian cooking were only sub-categories of ``English''
food.  She did recognize the existence of many languages (``You never read
about Bebel in the Bible?''), but claimed that English and Yiddish were all
she needed to travel anywhere. 

When I asked about her most recent trip, to Switzerland, Aunt Jennie said that
they served only English food, which was a problem for her, but that at least
they spoke Yiddish.  I said that as far as I knew there was very little
Yiddish spoken in Switzerland, that the language she heard was a Swiss dialect
of German. 

Aunt Jennie smiled at the naivete of an American graduate student.  ``I didn't
say they speak _good_ Yiddish.''

Subject: nivroko

In a short story by Isaak Babel, "El'ia Isaakovich i Margarita Prokof'evna," a
Jewish character says "nivroko" several times.  I haven't been able to find
the word in any Russian dictionaries, but a friend from Kishinev says she's
heard older Jews use it.  It seems to mean the same thing as "kinahora" (or
"ken ain-ha-ro") -- it's a formula used to avert the evil eye when one says
something complimentary or optimistic.  My questions, then:  1.  Have any of
you heard it used?  Can you expand on its meaning or stylistic weight?  2. 
Any ideas about its derivation?  I have some theories, but I fear they're
pretty hare-brained.  I'd love to hear other people'sthoughts. 

Thanks!
Gabriella Safran
