Subject: Mira Rafalowicz, O'H

A brief note acknowledging the sad news of the passing of Mira, our friend
and teacher. We came to know Mira quite well over several summers spent
in
Oxford and Amsterdam; she was a tremendous person, dedicated to Yiddish
(in
all its forms) and to her friends, colleagues, and students. We are glad to
have had the opportunity to learn with Mira, and to have called her "friend." 

Our thoughts are with her family and friends, especially Shura Lipovsky, our
beloved friend. 

Mira was a wonderful person. Her absence will be deeply felt by all of us.

Subject: "Glupsk"

Dear People,

Judel Mark in his chapter on Russian Literature in "Russian Jewry: 
1860-1917" mentioned a book by Mendele (Mendele Moycher Sforim)
called
"Foolstown" or "Glupsk." 

The model for "Glupsk" was Berdichev.  This is where my grandfather was
born. 
I have been eager to find books about Berdichev so as to provide myself
with
a background against which I can place my grandfather, who left Berdichev
at
a quite young age to study medicine in Bern and Lausanne. I have already
read
an English version of Pinhas Kahanovich's ("Der Nister") "Der Family
Mashber"
which is a novel placed in Berdichev (although it is called "N").  I also
read John and Carol Garrard's "Bones of Berdichev," the story of writer
Vasily Grossman, and Karen Hesse's "Letters from Rivka" the story of a
family's escape from Berdichev, written for children. 

Does anyone know whether this "Glupsk" story or novel by Mendele has
been
translated into English?  Unfortunately, although I can often muddle my way
through transliterated Yiddish, I cannot yet read Yiddish when it is written
with Hebrew letters. 

I know of two other books about Berdichev, one in Russian and the other in
Yiddish, but again, unfortunately I am unable to read them, much less find
them (Ster Elizavetsky, "Jews of Berdichev:  Berdichevskaia Tragediia" in
Russian, and "Tipen Un Bilder Fun Yidishn Lebn Amol in Berditshev" in
Yiddish.)

Thank you all for your attention.

Subject: lobes

The word I know well is lobus, an uncouth or wild youngster. Used very
commonly.

Subject: lobes

Re: Geoffrey Nathan's comments about <lobes/lobus> (Southeastern
Polish, with
the accent on the first syllable). 

A <lobus> is an "urchin" and thus, a "rascal" or "mischief-maker".  My Mom
used it used as an endearment often, employing the more ascerbic
"paskudnyak"
when she was serious.

Subject: Lobes

Geoffrey S. Nathan wants to know the meaning of 'lobes'. The most obvious
work to look up words, the EYYED, gives: urchin.  Could it possibly have a
connection with Southern Dutch 'loebas' - boor, lout?

Subject: American Yiddish Lit

Larry Rosenwald's query reminds me that Gershon Einbinder (Chaver
Paver) may
be useful in this regard.  The National Yiddish Book Center has a number of
his books in Yiddish (see particularly "klinton strit," "di tsen landslayt" 
and "zalmen der shuster").  At one time they also had an English translation
of a number of his works, entitled "Clinton Street and Other Stories" 
translation by Henry Goodman, published by the YKUF. 

If he has time for archival research, he may be able to find other things (I
don't know if he is interested in such things as the "Lobsik" stories).

Subject: American-English and Yiddish Literature

Larry Rosenwald (in 8.065) asks a fascinating shayle about the relationship
between American English and Yiddish literature. 

In thinking about American English-language literature that relates to
Yiddish, the first generation immigrant writers come to mind. Anzia
Yezierska, Henry Roth, Abe Cahan, Samuel Ornitz, Michael Gold, Fannie
Hurst.... 

Heralded as the first novel by an immigrant about immigrant life, Abe
Cahan's
_Yekl: A Tale of the New York Ghetto_ was even praised by William Dean
Howels.  (The movie Hester Street is based on this book). Like Henry
Roth's
great masterpiece, _Call It Sleep_ Cahan uses grotesque (comic?)
mispronunciation to contrast with the language of his characters' thoughts
and feelings. With Roth, the language takes on a life and becomes the
protagonist. "Vot d"I care vot she t'inks. She's your vife, ain't it? A
husban' dassn't hide not'ink from his vife!..." Siz gut far yidn that Cahan's
"English" mellowed in his short stories and in _The Rise of David
Levinsky_.. 

In one of my favorite books, _Bread Givers_, Anzia Yezierska uses cadence
and
sentence structure and syntax to show the relationship between Yiddish
(Old
World ideas) and the new America. The words, the dialogue enhances the
essence of each character. Lines like: "I'd give you away my life"; "it's
coming the holiday";" what for should you waste your time yet with school
anymore".....and: "by us home in Shnipishock"..... recall to me lovingly the
speech of my parents and relatives, strongly binding me to Sara Smolinsky
and
even to her tyrannical, Torah loving father.

Subject: Yiddish as a scientific language

Per the suggestion of Mr. Zachary M. Baker, Head Librarian at YIVO, I
would
like to post the following inquiry: 
    
Is there a survey article or book or other reference source which
summarizes
the extent to which Yiddish has been used as the original language on
scientific and mathematical subjects? 
    
Thanks, 
Dan Gross
Kensington MD 

[Moderator's note: a bibliography with a number of science and math books
(http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/library/term-yi.htm) can be found in Shtetl's
library, although most of them are textbooks and popular science literature.
-i.v.]

Subject: A brokhe for the computer

At this holiest time of the year it occurred to me that we don't have a
brokhe for the computer af yidish. Somewhere in the Haredi Community
someone
must have found a need to thank the Almighty for the blessing of giving us
the miracle of this writing machine, and the wonderful opportunities to share
this virtual companionship with each other. 

When one sits down or gets up from almost any activity, there is a prayer. 
What would be a greater mitsve than thanking for this noble machine? For
example, one could thank for not having a crash--forbid we should have a
bomb. Naturally it must be in Yiddish. I promise to publish it in Der Bay,
and I'm sure many of the other editors would do likewise. Instantly, it would
be successful. 

In fact, why should it be left only to the Haredi--why not the Humanists?  Of
course we soon would have commentaries written. There would be different
schools of thought, and Mendele would be a wonderful venue for the
ensuing,
hair-splitting, dialectical debates.
