i have a few comments in response to dave's comments.

it's a little more complicated than that, i think. for many of the words,
they had no particular connotion in YIDDISH--it's only as borrowings into
ENGLISH that they acquire these connotations.

according to my admittedly imperfect intuitions, if one is speaking YIDDISH,
one can perfectly well speak of a shidekh between gentiles or even a mixed
one (tho the presupposition of matchmaking makes a mixed one a bit unusual).
and certainly there can be goyishe simkhes, no? it's only when they're used
in english that they get specialized that way. (and i don't think they do
for everyone.)

don't brush aside the placement of the accent so easily! in fact that tells us
that the word came into english from yiddish, not from hebrew. for example,
many anglophone jews have two words in their english lexicons--shabes and
shabat. it's very clear that shabes had to come in from yiddish (the old hebrew
-th was pronounced in yiddish -s--typical german accent, after all), whereas
shabat is clearly from modern hebrew. (old hebrew th became modern hebrew t,
plus the stress remained on the second syllable.) (oh, sorry--the movement of
the stress to the first syllable in a two syllable word is a typical germanic
feature--english did it with all the french words it borrowed, too.) 

i should add that, with simkhe, it's not only the difference in stress, it's
also the last vowel--/a/ in hebrew and schwa (mid central lax vowel) in yiddish
and english.

again, leyn in yiddish is read. men leyent a tsaytung, a briv, vos es zol
nit zayn, even a porno novel... it's only in english that it's limited to
torah reading.

>I would agree that these are all examples of Judaeo-English.

of course, leyn couldn't possibly have come from hebrew since it's not semitic.
(it's claimed to have come into yiddish from some romance language, i believe.)

i should add that, as a linguist, **i** don't find their origin irrelevant--tho
i realize it's not an earth-shaking issue.

i agree that some of these are 'technical terms' and don't translate well. but
others aren't. what does non-frum have that non-observant lacks, other than
an ability to make the hearers feel warm and in-group? (i'm not putting down
the importance of feeling warm and in-group--in fact, there's a long literature
on that as a motivation for code-switching in general--i'm just pointing out
that there's no NECESSITY for using most of these.)

and now i'll stop hocking you a tshaynik, as we used to say in brooklyn.

I presume, then, that Israeli Arabs don't have simchas.
(Does this mean that modern Hebrew has a different word
for the general concept of `celebration'?)

I always assumed this was due to one of the following reasons:

A) Ignorance of the English translations for some words.

B) Inability to translate the concepts into English
   due to a shallow understanding of the concept itself.

C) Desire to distinguish in-group people from outsiders
   via a special in-group slang, much as adolescents are prone to do.
   (Why else must Pharoah be called `Paroh' in the middle of
    a speech that otherwise is in English?  Was `Paroh' a
    specifically-Jewish Egyption king?)

It seems redundant to embed a declaration of one's Jewishness
into every sentence.  I must admit, however, that since I've
begun hanging around Orthodox people, I've started to pick up
some of these habits (e.g. calling the Sabbath `Shabbas').
