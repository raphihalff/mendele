Subject: Introduction

I've been lurking for some time and I figure it is time to introduce
myself. My name is Elaine Gold and I am a PhD student in Linguistics at
the University of Toronto. I have been doing some work on Yiddish syntax
and history. I am not a native Yiddish speaker, but learned Yiddish at
kheder and at university. I've been enjoying the wide-ranging discussions
on Mendele, but of course I'm most interested in linguistic topics.

Subject: Aspect: shatsn vs opshatsn

In an article about the funeral for one of the victims of the Brooklyn
Bridge shooting, the Yiddish Forverts (Mar. 11, 1994) writes "A vortzoger
fun di lyubavitsher hot OPGESHATST, az in der levaye hobn zikh bateylikt
arum 12 toyznt perzon.  Di politsey hot ober GESHATST di tsol onteylnemer
oyf iber 5 toyznt."  How can the difference between opgeshatst and
geshatst be expressed in English?  Would this do?:  "Although a
spokesperson for the Lubavitchers ESTIMATED that about ... , the police
WERE ESTIMATING that ... "?  Or, "Although a spokesperson ... HAD
ESTIMATED ... , the police ESTIMATED ..."? Is there a hint of disdain on
the part of the writer for the implied exaggeration by the vortzoger?
(Differences between participants' estimates and those of the police are
not uncommon, of course.)

Subject: Tolkien, Golem, and Bubbis

Jay Lee suggests that the character Smaug in Tolkien's The Hobbit has a
Yiddish origin.  I have often wondered the same thing about Tolkien's
character Golem (I think that is how it is spelled).  Tolkien's
background was South African and Catholic so I don't know how he would be
acquainted with the Yiddish language.  It's an interesting supposition
though.  I would also like to repeat a question I asked a few issues ago.
Why is it that Jews in Toronto use the pronunciation Bubbi and Zedi,
while Jews in Montreal use the pronunciation Baubi and Zeda.  By the same
token, my South African fiance uses the pronunciation Boba and Zeda.  I
think it has to with the differences between Polish, Russian and
Lithuanian Yiddish but I could be wrong.  What do you think?

Subject: Bernstein's proverbs, fir kashes

Leonard Prager mentioned the 'erotic part' of Ignats Bernshtein's
collection of Yiddish proverbs. It was translated into English and
published in 1975 (including transliterated Yiddish original):

            TITLE: Erotica et rustica. Yiddish sayings mama never taught
                   you / [compiled by Ignaz Bernstein ; translated by
                   Weltman & Zuckerman].
      PUBLICATION: [Van Nuys, Calif.] : Perivale Press, [1975]
      DESCRIPTION: xi, 99 p. ; 22 cm.
           SERIES: Perivale translation series
            NOTES: Translation of Erotica et rustica.
            NOTES: Added t.p. in Yiddish.
            NOTES: English and Yiddish with transcription in Roman characters.
          SUBJECT: Erotic proverbs, Yiddish.
      ADDED ENTRY: Bernstein, Ignacy, 1836-1909.
      ADDED ENTRY: Weltman, Gershon, 1936-

Fir Kashes in Yiddish are available in postscript format from the
Nysernet gopher (URL:gopher://nysernet.org:71/00/.israel.arch/graphics/
4kashes.big and gopher://nysernet.org:71/00/.israel.arch/graphics/4kashes).

These two files have different font size. I can mail them to those who
don't have gopher or WWW access. But if you use gopher, look into
Nysernet: you'll find many other mytsiyes as well.

Subject: RE: Rosenfeld's Prufrock

I agree, Noyekh, that parodies af yidish (and often af english) can be
sophomoric and painful.  But I remember bursting out laughing the first
time I read "In tsimer vu di vayber zenen/Redt men fun Karl Marx un
Lenin."

Genuine translations, rather than parodies, can be interesting, even
striking. I have a Yiddish version of Longfellow's "Hiawatha" by Yehoash
(!), who was able to retain the original meter--no surprise, I guess, for
a poet who could put the whole Tanakh into Yiddish.

Subject: Introduction and Isaac Rosenfeld

I'm the new kind on the internet and understand that it is part of my
initiation to make a short speech of self introduction.  Ah hem. [cough]

I'm Mark Shechner, professor of English at SUNY, Buffalo, and I've
written here and there about Jewish writers and intellectual life in
America.  I've got one book that is sort of about the New York
Intellectuals titled After the Revolution, a book of essays titled The
Conversion of the Jews, and a collection of the essays and stories of
Isaac Rosenfeld, Preserving the Hunger.

Is that enough?

But that segues into my next message, which is the Prufrock parody of
Isaac Rosenfeld.  I had it around the house years ago in a version that
Daniel Bell had published somewhere.  Bell has a prodigious recollection
for such things and transcribed it from memory.  I can't find it now, but
will look around the house.  But I do recall these wonderful lines.

In tsimer vu di wayber zenen
Redt men fun Karl Marx un Lenin

Ikh ver alt, ikh ver alt,
Un der pupik vert mir kalt

Those were the high spots, as I recall, but surely the rest is around here
somewhere.  Now, let's see.

Sincerely,

Mark Shechner
