Subject: Forming diminutives

In Yiddish, as in many languages, syllables before the stressed
syllable are often ignored when a diminutive is formed, e.g.

	Eng. Isaac /AYzek/ -> Izzy
vs.	French Isaac /iZAK/ -> Zizi

Yid.    (y)itskhok /(Y)ITSkhok/ -> itshe...
    vs. yisroel /yiSROel/ -> sroel...
    vs. yehoshue /yehoSHUe/ -> shue...

	Eng. Constance /KANstens/ -> Connie
vs.	Greek konstantinos /konstanTINos/ -> dino

	Yid. yosef /YOsef/ -> yosl...
	Eng. Joseph /DZSHOsef/ -> Joe
vs.	Fr. Joseph /zshoSEF/ -> Soussou
	Italian Giuseppe /dzhuSEPpe/ -> Beppo

Subject: Shund

With reference to Goldie Morgentaler's query concerning shund
[6294:3], it would seem that in Yiddish just as in German 'shund'/
'Schund' is cognate with 'shinden'/ 'schinden' (to skin an animal)
which in turn is derived from MHG 'schint' (meaning and cognate with
English 'skin'). The literal meaning of 'Schund' is the worthless and
distasteful waste material produced by the knacker's trade. The fact
that in both languages '(op)shinden'/ 'schinden' is used
metaphorically in the sense of 'to fleece' completes the picture of
exploitative, distasteful rubbish.

Subject: Shund

In response to Goldie Morgentaler's request for information on the
origins of the word "shund" as applied to literature and theater, may
I suggest my article, "Fear of Purim: Y. L. Peretz and the
Canonization of Yiddish Theater," which was published in Jewish Social
Studies 1 (1995), no. 3: 44-65. And also see the two important
articles by Chone Shmeruk as well as other material which I cite in my
notes.

Subject: Bashert

With reference to Ray Clayton's query concerning the etymology of
'bashert' [6296:3], the answer is that it is the past participle of
the verb 'bashern', derived from the MHG 'beschern' meaning 'to allot'
or 'to apportion' (as by God, fate or other higher power). The English
word 'share' is distantly cognate. One's 'basherte(r)' (the correct
substantival forms) is thus the spouse alloted to one by providence.
'Bashert' used as a noun is Yinglish. The variant 'bashect' cited by
Ray Clayton presumably represents the spasmodic neutralisation of
reysh and khof (thus in this instance: 'bashekht') which is
encountered at widely scattered points in White Russia and the
Ukraine, with the consonant in question anglicised to [k] at some
stage in the chain of transmission from bobe to wife to enquirer.

Subject: Translating a song into Yiddish

Can anyone help me translate the following song into Yiddish. I was
raised speaking it, but haven't practiced it in years. A friend, who
speaks Yiddish worse than me (but plays the fiddle wonderfly) wants to
write a klezmer song using these words.

My dear,
You're the only one I want,
but you only want me to be your friend.
I love you more than anyone else in the world,
but you only want me to be your friend.
I love you more than both heaven and earth,
but you only want me to be your friend.
I fell in love with you the first time I saw you,
but you only want me to be your friend.
I can't be your friend, but I can be so much more,
but you only want me to be your friend.
But, so goes life.

Any help would be appreciated, and time is of the essence, so
please e-mail responses.

Mark van Brenk
