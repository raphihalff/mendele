Subject: Right hand/left hand

I am interested in a question concerning the technology of writing: Do
left-handed people write Yiddish (Hebrew, Arabic) more easily than
right-handers ?  I have asked several people, but never gotten any
satisfying answser.  I know that when I write Yiddish, I push the pen or
pencil, nothing at all like the cramped style I sometimes see when
watching left-handers write English.

Perhaps some Mendelniks who have actually _taught_ Yiddish can inform me of
this particular fact.  In connection with this, would left-handers be
more fluent writing mirror-English?  Would right-handers write better
Yiddish in reverse?

My thanks to anyone who has some expertise in this.

Subject: Yiddish wordprocessors (summary)

So far I received 7 responses to my survey on the Yiddish wordprocessors,
describing 3 programs, and several requests for the results. I am posting
this preliminary summary, and if there would be more responses (and I
hope there would) I will post an update.

A groysn dank to Garry Margolis, Howard Aronson, Susan Harlap, Peter
Kluehs, Dan Leeson, Marcia Gruss Levinsohn, and Marion Aptroot for their
input.

=============================================================================

1. Nisus Writer (Versions 3.47 - 4.0) Mac, System 7
Manufacturer: Nisus Software Inc.
107 South Cedros Avenue
Solana Beach, CA 92075
tel: (800) 922-2993 / (619) 481-1477, fax: (619) 481-6154
Vendor: Nisus Software, MacZone (800-258-0882), MacConnection (800-800-2222)
Price: $170-300

Comments: Fonts are OK, but you're better advised to buy a commercial
font from, e.g., Ecological Linguistics.

Easy to type both Yiddish and English in one line: Yes--but--the problem
is not NisusWriter's (NIsusWriter will even sort according to the
alef-beys, with or without nikudot. You can even search for Hebrew words
by triliteral root); the problem is that I still haven't found a font
that will reproduce the YIVO/TSISHO "oysleyg," i.e., it's hard to find
pasekh tsvey yudn, fe mit a rafe, veys mit a rafe. The other YIVO letters
(sin, tov/sov, melumpm vov, yud mit a khirik) are available in the
Ecological Linguistics fonts. I'm trying to find out from them if the
remaining problem letters are available in the latest version.  Program
is highly recommended.

2. Hebrew Edit (Version 1.0) IBM, DOS
Manufacturer: Right to Left Software, PO Box 94034,
3332 Yonge St, Toronto, Ontario M4N 3R1, Canada
tel: 416-489-7440,  fax: 416-489-6654
Vendor: Right to Left Software
Price: $19

Comments: Shareware program. Nikudes can be suppressed to enable users of
different wordprocessors to read the resulting 128+ hebrew ascii files.
Very nice large hebrew block letters and script letters.

3. EinsteinWriter (Version 7.4) IBM, DOS
Manufacturer:  Possibly Perceptronics & Einstein
tel: 972-2-415228 (Israel)

Comments: I've used this in various versions for years in Israel, with a
standard Israeli keyboard. It gives you two options. Either you can type
in english, with english help etc; if you want to insert a yiddish or
hebrew word, phrase or more, you press a single key. That takes care of
the font and the right-to-left direction and the end-of-line wrap. You
press the same key to return to english.  Alternatively, you can chose to
type in hebrew, with hebrew help and onscreen menu. The same single key
inserts the english words.

Subject: Alte zakhen, alte shikh

Henry Mullish tells of his experience in Israel.

This cry for used stuff has become now less common.  I know it since I am
here,  from the middle  1930s.  The "proper"  way it is  sounded is "alte
zakhen, alte shikh".  While most  of those who were in that line were
Arabs, some Jews did compete with them.
