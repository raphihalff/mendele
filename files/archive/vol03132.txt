All this I know.  In fact, at Oxford, they teach the forms "uf" and
"aruf." When I encountered the Soviet orthography this past summer
in Oxford, I saw that it had alef-vov-fey and alef-reysh-vov-fe for
the two words.

My original question was, why did Orthodox Jews take up "uf". I
cannot think of another instance of wide-spread Orthodox usage of a
NE Yiddish form.

Subject: Oy, hobn mir getanzt

My parents once heard Jan Peerce sing Al Joelson's Anniversar Waltz
in Yiddish and have asked me if I had any idea where one could find
it (the words, not the recording).  Well, said I, I could always ask
Mendele.  And so I have.

Subject: Kasha varnishkes

In his November 12 column in the English _Forward_ Philologus
considers the possible origins of the culinary term "kasha
varnishkes."  He ultimately connects it with the Russian word
_vareniki_ for a kind of filled dumpling.  He suggests that the
Yiddish (Yinglish?) term originally referred to a dumpling stuffed
with kasha (buckwheat groats), later perhaps to kasha stuffed into
tubular pasta, and finally to what we know today, i.e., kasha served
with flat (often bow-tie noodles).

Although _vareniki_ are a fairly standard part of Russian cooking,
it's in Ukraine that they're really a kind of national dish, known
as _varenyky_.  More interestingly, the 1907 Hrynchenko dictionary
of the Ukrainian language, which I have cited before on this list,
includes a word _varenytsia_ (pl. _varenytsi_), defined as "round or
rectangular pieces of rolled out dough that have been boiled in
water; often these are the pieces that were prepared for _varenyky_,
but were left over due to a lack of filling; they are then boiled
together with the _varenyky_."

This could be a more direct source for "kasha varnishkes," if the
kasha was originally served, not with bow ties, but with left over
pieces of boiled pasta.
