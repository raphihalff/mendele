Subject: the sin of the census

to respond to delphine bechtel's inquiry, refer first to exodus
30:11-16. the notion that one could not count, except by the device
of the surrogate count (of, for example, the half-shekel) finds its
origins in judaism in this set of passages.  it was reinforced
(biblically) in 2 samuel 24 and 1 chronicles 21, which describes
what happened when king david did not follow this prescription.

sir james frazer's 1918 'folklore in the old testament'  devotes a
chapter to a list of various cultures that had a superstition
against being counted.

archeological research at mari, one of the principal centers of
mesopotamia during the third and early second millennia BCE has
produced cuneiform letters which describe a census and an associated
"purification" or "expiation", which may be akin to the "kofer" that
the half shekel represents.

finally, a pilpul on hosea 2:1 "...the number of the children of
israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or
numbered" has been used to justify not being counted, as is jeremiah
33:13, which is interpreted as saying that there shall be no census
until the messiah comes.

indeed, today in mea shearim at israeli census time there are wall
posters advising people not to participate.

did this tell you more than you wanted to know?

Subject: Jews and numbers

borkhobe, delphine!

I believe its an iser dorayse.  However, there are ways of getting
around it (similar to nisht eyns, etc;).  The torah itself recounts
a couple of censuses.  one of them leads to a plague (improper
counting procedure), while another is conducted by counting the
number of half-shekels, which were donated to the mishkan (permitted
procedure). similarly, in shul, to check for a minyen, there is a
regularly used posuk with ten words.  (pl. check khumesh for
details--this is off the top of my head).

Subject: About "Jews and Numbers"

I know of at least two reasons why Jews, at least in earlier times,
may have been averse to being counted or to counting themselves.

From medieval times down into early modern times Jewish communities
in Europe were frequently taxed as a whole, not as individuals.  I
imagine it has always been true that nobody like to pay taxes, and
I'm sure Jews would have done what they could to keep the numbers
reported as low as possible, in order to decrease the tax burden.

Another reason for Jewish communities not to have undertaken
censuses could have been fear of divine retribution like that
following the Biblical census commissioned by King David (I Samuel
24).  The census, which according to the Biblical record, took nine
months to complete, showed a fighting population of 1,200,000.  The
plague, sent by God to punish David, killed 70,000 of the soldiers
in a single day.

The bane of the historical demographer working on Jewish population
numbers during the Middle Ages is how to get accurate numbers.  For
the two reasons given above, and doubtless others, almost all
population estimates of medieval Jewish populations down to about
the 1700's are suspect.

Subject: A kholem

     Being new to Mendele I am still reeling from the experience.
That's why, no doubt, I had this dream last night:

     I was tooling along the information superhighway in my IBM
compatible, enjoying the cyberspace scenery, when I was stopped
for speeding by a superhighway officer on IRQ (interrupt request)
patrol.  Ticket book in hand, he approached my window and said
(to my utter astonishment):

     "her nor, khaym-yankl, vu loyfstu?"

     and i answered, "ikh muz dir zogn (zolst nisht hobn keyn
faribl) az mayn nomen iz nisht khaym-yankl. ikh heys leybl."

     "nu, loz zayn leybl. zog mir, leybele, tayrer. vos iz di
mayse? me darf zikh dokh arumkukn af der velt, forn a bisl
pavolyinke. nu, zog shoyn. vu loyfstu?"

     "ikh loyf brengen epes laytish far mentshn, abonentn af
mendele, di vos leynen kompyuter-loshn. efsher vartn zey af mir."

     "nu, oyb azoy, iz gut. gey gezunterheyt, nor pavolye. nisht
gekhapt. gedenkzhe, ober! drey mir nisht a spodek mit kompyuter-
loshn. af dos bin ikh nisht keyn groyser meyvn. af mame-loshn,
avade un avade."

     And then I awoke from a dream that underscores my wonder and
delight at discovering a Yiddish Language and Literature circle
on the internet.

Subject: Takeh

For many years, I wondered about the derivation of  takeh , meaning
"indeed".  I once went down a blind alley following  tak  which in
Czech means  "well", as in  "Well, I guess so".  But a few years
ago, I heard my colleague at the London School of Economics use tak
frequently when speaking Polish with his mother, & was pleased to
discover that it is the Polish for "yes"  (Russian cognate  da ).
It seemed to me that the step from  yes to indeed  was a natural
one, especially since we already had a perfectly good Ashkenazic ioh
for "yes".  I would appreciate any comment on the authenticity of
this etymology.

As for the nasalization in Yankov (or Yankel) for Yakov, &c., I
think that may also derive from the Polish where e.g. Walesa  is
pronounced  Walensa, &c.  I will check this out with my Polish
colleague at LSE, to learn whether he finds this as credible as I
do, and I ask comment from my colleagues in mendele.
