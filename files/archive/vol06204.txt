Subject: Jewish culture in St. Petersburg today

Jewish culture is alive and well at Adain Los in St. Petersburg, Russia
Adain Lo   folkshule opened in 1991.  They maintain a full-day
kindergarten, Sunday school, adult classes in Judaica, Hebrew and
Yiddish, and klezmer band.  They have developed a unique curriculum of
teaching Judaica through folklore, poetry, and music. Their aim is to
renew Eastern European Jewish culture and the Jewish communities of St.
Petersburg and Russia through intergenerational participation in the
classes and clubs geared to different age groups, parents, and the
entire family - some 200 people.

Why "Adain Lo"? They explain that it is the answer given by the Jewish
philosopher Rosentzvige when he was asked, "Do you put on tfillin?"
"Not yet," he answered.  For the Adain Lo shule, it is not yet time to
define their Jewish affiliation.  They feel that the need now is to
renew Russian Jewish culture after 70 years of Communist oppression of
religious and ethnic groups.

Subject: Yiddish language tapes

Leybl Botwinik inquires (6.198) about language tapes called "Yiddish
30," available from Barnes and Noble and also from Audio-Forum.  This
set of two tapes was my introduction to Yiddish six years ago.  It
includes a dozen or so basic lists (colors, numbers, parts of the body,
greetings, kitchen utensils, etc.) in English and Yiddish, with a pause
for the student to repeat the Yiddish. It progresses to three or four
simple conversations ( -- Hello!  I'm on my way to the Yiddish class at
Columbia University!  -- So am I!  Let's go together!)

I found the tapes to be a good way to "stick my toe in the water" and
begin pronouncing Yiddish.  I then went on to Weinreich's "College
Yiddish" and the "I Love Yiddish" tape by Emanuel Goldsmith, etc., etc.

I'd recommend the tapes for a beginner.   Then, a beginner who decides
to study intensively could look into Sheva Zucker's extensive and
systematic set of tapes and book.

Subject: Bialik's slippers

The letter from Sholem Aleichem to Chaim Nachman Bialik about the
slippers Bialik left behind after a visit -- mentioned in a posting from
Sylvia Schildt [6.198]-- appears in English in a volume available from
the Workmen's Circle Book Center -- volume two of "The Three Great
Classic Writers of Modern Yiddish Literature -- selected works of
Sholem-Alekhem," edited by Marvin Zuckerman and Marion Herbst.  It's
pretty charming.

Subject: _A Geshonken Lebn_ by Mario Meszel

By pure accident, I came across a fascinating book on the holocaust
written in Yiddish by Mario Meszel, a man in his 80's born in Poland,
who fought with the partisans during World War II, and who has lived in
Argentina ever since.

The book traces the life of a Jewish physician, Doctor Leon Blum, who
was a key figure with the partisans in Poland,  and later emigrated to
the United States, where his previous life and his great heroism during
the war remained completely unknown to everyone around him.

Doctor Blum practiced medicine in New York and finally died in the late
60s without any honors ever bestowed upon him.

His only contact with this incredible past were a few partisans living
in Israel, and Mario Meszel, who had been very active in the Argentine
Jewish community, and who had helped Arthur Schindler settle in that
country after World War War, and who kept visiting his friend in New
York during business trips from Argentina.  After Blum's death, Meszel
decided to write this amazing story.

I met with Meszel and read his fascinating account in the Spanish
translation from the original Yiddish [the book is called _The Story of
a Survivor_ in Spanish].  It received excellent reviews by the Argentine
press, and I feel certain that because of the language and regional
barrier, the book did not become a world best seller as it could have
been.

Could someone advise me on how to get this book read in Yiddish and how
to get it translated to English.  The two lives of Doctor Blum would
certainly make an extraordinary movie.

Subject: Mauscheln

I've been gratified and educated by the replies to my inquiry about
mauscheln. We--I anyway--would appreciate more information on the
linguistics of m., i.e. how does one mauschel (and, to Michael
Steinlauf, do analogous things in Polish)?  I would guess from what I
take to be analogous phenomena elsewhere that phonology is crucial
(even more on the stage than on the page), i.e. substitutions of certain
sounds not found in Yiddish by 'the next best thing' (what is done with
the German front rounded vowels oe and ue -no umlaut available here)?)
--easiest to do, and intonation (again, more realizable on the stage)
must be crucial. (This as partly mimickable in music, e.g. in one
section of Musorgski's Pictures at an Exhibition?)  What about
'peculiar' word orders in mauscheln, unidiomatic repetitions, catchwords
and phrases, etc.  Characteristic differences in morphology (e.g. verb
conjugations?), syntax?  Pragmatics?
