Subject: More about Bis ...

I am not sure that I read all the Bis disscussion on
Mendele, but I was sure that Bis in the Israeli jargon came
from the German Beissen: I remember, as children we said:
"Ten li bis meha-gelidah shelkha" (Give me a bite from your
ice cream).

This is my Bis to the discussion.

if it's so simple, what happened to the '-l'? i've never
heard bis in yiddish. or could it be from the yiddish noun
_bis_ 'bite'?

no, it isn't. (you might find in a song or a poem, but it's
not said.) if you're coming to this from germanic, you
might want to add this to your database:

ikh veys az nokhn bentshn hot der zeyde gekoyft a seyfer.

Subject: bit & bite & bisl & piece & epes

For what it's worth, the derivations of Hebrew "bis" from
Yiddish, and Yiddish "epes" from earlier "etwas" ring true
to my ear, although I'd be interested in hearing a more
closely reasoned explication of the alternatives.

I can't subscribe to reb Ruvn-Mendl's surmise of cognation
between "bis" and "piece", however.  I don't think Grimm's
Law would let us get away with this.  A Gaulic "p-" would
turn up in Yiddish as "v-", wouldn't it?

[To Ruvn-Mendl Turkel:}

I would rather make its origin "a bays" which is exactly
the same as "a bite" in English.

[To Gus Grannan:]

My immediate (intuitive) answer would be NO. But I am not a
native yiddish-speaker and there are many savant linguists
on the list who surely know better.

Mikhl is of course correct in pointing out (Vol 1.218)
that exuberant drinking is supposed to occur only on
Purim and Simkhas Toyre.  But what's a youngster to do?
Hert a mayse:

There was once a time (Mikhl knows this but maybe he's
forgotten) when 'kosher l'pesach' labels were scarce
indeed.  The very notion that they could be used by non-
Jewish firms was strange.  (This is before Maxwell House
and their free Haggadas.)  So there was no milk, no
seltzer, and water in my home town was utterly foul. Vos
tut men?  We kids would come home to a lunch of (what
else?) gefrishte matzo fried in shmaltz and ..a glezele
vayn.  Where did you get wine during Prohibition?  That's a
story for another time.  But since I wasn't the only kid on
my block to get fed that way, you can imagine how much
teaching our Misses O'Briens and Kellys accomplished. Maybe
that's when I was supposed to have learned short division
or what adverbs were.
