Subject: Shnipishok & Butshatsh

These ar real places. Offhand, I don't know where the former is, but the
latter is a well-known location in Galicia (Southern Poland). I think that
both Dov Sadan and Agnon were from Butshatsh. 

There are a number of other real locations that figure in Yiddish expressions
designating far away, presumably mythical place: "in Loyvitsh" (in Poland),
"in Trok" (in Lithuania), "in di Bonifratn" (mental hospitals run by a
monastic order in various Polish towns), "in Boyberik" (a locatable town
under a similar sounding name in the Ukraine), "in Yehupets" ("pseudonym" for
Kiev)--both of the latter made famous by Sholem Aleichem, "in Hotseplots" (in
or near Czechoslovakia, as I recall). An unspecified location, "hinter di
harey-khoyshekh" is, of course, not to be found on any real map.  Altogether,
an interesting subject for study--the geographic distribution of various
place-names that assumed a mythical character.

Subject: Sholem Asch's son

There's an Asch book in translation called "This I Believe".

Moe Asch was more than a folk song collector - he was the founder of Folkways
records, with its repertoire of thousands of titles.  These records are now
part of the Smithsonian Folkways division.  Smithsonian may have Moe Asch
materieal as well.

Subject: Yiddish as a Foreign Language in Israel.

'Foreign Language' and 'Second Language' teaching are terms used in a
specific context. To give an example, English is a 'Second Language' in India
and taught as such. English is the language that speakers of different local
languages have in common there. In France English is a foreign language.

If English is taught in England or America to non-native speakers it is
called English as a second language. The differences are not always as clear.
In Holland English is a foreign language, on the edge of being a second
language - for instance since some university courses are taught in English. 

If Yiddish is taught to Israelis who use the language in their daily life,
within a Yiddish speaking community, we would call it Yiddish as a second
language teaching; if it is taught to Israelis who don't know any Yiddish,
but study it in order to read literature or to communicate with their
grandmother, it would be called Yiddish as a foreign language. 

Both approaches require a different teaching programme, using different
teaching materials and techniques. No reason for Sylvia Schildt to get so
exited about the word 'foreign', which is appropriate because she seems to
want to include even the Falashas in her teaching programme. 

I would like to remind her that she has not answered any questions relating
to the issue of Yiddish in Israel yet (where did the money go ???) and that
her clarion call seems rather monotonous.

Subject: feygl

Wouldn't this in turn suggest that "feygle," as the Yiddish slang translation
for the disparaging term "fairy," is derived from a German word for violet
rather than the more obvious little bird?  That seems unlikely on its face. 
Besides, my grandfather used the same word, Feygl, for both the little bird
who told him things (when asked where he had heard something), and for his
sister's name.  I'm forced to conclude, that if the name Faygl ever had any
origins in a German dialect word for Violet, that meaning had been lost by
the time my great-grandparents named my great-aunt Feygl--and that native
speakers of Yiddish in late 19th century Vilna Gubernia (at least) clearly
understood it to mean bird.  When it comes to languages, I'll rely on native
speakers over logical deductions as to what is likely or unlikely every time.

Subject: Back to Feygl

To Meyer Wolf, et al:  My apologies. I may have "misspoken" in citing German
_Voeglein_ as the variant of _Veilchen_ 'violet' from which the Yiddish name
Feygl is derived. I believe that I discovered that entry in a German dialect
dictionary (in Germany). However, the only relevant variant of _Veilchen_
'violet' thatl I can confirm with materials at hand is _Veigelein_ (a perfect
cognate). See, for example,

Wildhagen, s.v. Veigelein: <poet> 'wallflower' <dial=3D> Veilchen 'violet'. 
Kluge, s.v. Veilchen: .... Auf obd. -lein is das in Mundarten und
Volksliedern lebendige Veigelein gebildet, das auf mhd _violin_ zurueckgeht. 

In other words, it remains that the Yiddish name _Feygl_ concerns violets,
not birds. 

As to Meyer question "What reason is there to prefer the flower source to the
bird source?": If he were the father of girls (unlike me, he's not), he could
answer the question himself. I can understand naming a little girl "Bird" or
"Birdy", but "BIRDS"? A nekhtiker tog! (Yes, I know that a back-formation
from the diminutive Feygele is also a possibility, but I'll stick to my
guns.)
