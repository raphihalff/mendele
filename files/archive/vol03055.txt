Subject: Idioms

Nokh etlekhe idiomen funem Judeo-Sorbianer loshn.

1.  "hefker petrishke" = anything goes [U. Weinreich].  I think I
recall it being used to disparage a chaotic state of affairs.

2.  "a lek un a shmek, abi geton!".  Criticizing an inadequately
(because too-hurriedly) performed task.

3.  "bakumen dos pekele tsores" = to menstruate.  Weinreich gives,
in addition to "menstruirn",  "hobn/krign di tsayt"--not nearly as
vivid.

4.  "a nomen fun der haftoyre" = a fictitious name  (lemoshl, Pavel
Slobodjanskyj).

5.  "nisht [emetsns] khazershe biznes" = none of [someone's] damned
affair. "Vifl hostu farlorn nekhtn banakht in pinakl?"  " 'Siz nisht
dayn khazershe biznes!" said my nasty Uncle Max.

6.  "makhn mit di zaytn" = to writhe with pain [A. Harkavy].  A
sardonic reply by the same Uncle Max to the friendly
greeting/inquiry  "Vos makht a yid?" was "A yid makht mit di zaytn."

7.  "alts ye, dos nit" = "I'm prepared to consider/permit many
requests/actions, but never *that* one."  (A *Redensart* rather than
an idiom, if I understand the distinction, since a literal
translation works.)  The "ye" is not a typo; that was the
pronunciation of my vilner-gubernye-geborene tate-mame.

While you may consider the misuse of pseudonymic authorship to be a
criminal activity, I fail to see why you have to be so derogatory
about those who are unhappy about Yivo orthography. I do not even
know whom you have in mind, but I (in common with most Yiddish
speakers) find the Yivo latinization scheme highly confusing . (OK
maybe most Yiddish speakers have never seen the Yivo scheme so they
aren't bothered by it.) A recent posting decried the use of -ch- for
tes-sheen. This seems pretty harmless compared with a
transliteration scheme which requires me to stop and think at every
-ey- and -ay- , having got used to thinking of -u- as the i/ee
sound.

Is a little tolerance in order?

Subject: Is "goy" necessarily derogatory?

I think this essentially repeats a previous discussion of "shiksa".
Many will be adamant that this is not a proper term to use in
English. However, examples can be found where the intended use is
friendly and will so be taken.

Subject: Second Internat'l Yiddish Conf.

ATTENTION ALL LEBADIKER MENDELNIKS:

  The First Internal'l Conference of Yiddish Clubs was a huge
success. So much so, that an intrepid trio if Yidishers, Harold
Black of Washington, DC, Fishl Kutner of San Mateo,California, and
Allan Blair of Columbus, Ohio, set out to get the ball rolling for
THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF YIDDISH CLUBS.

  The chosen city has been thoroughly researched by Kutner, Blair,
and Black. We think that the meetinf AND the city will be more than
stupendous.

  Since the firers and the vikhtiker mentchen of this marvelous
haven't given us the official acceptane, the hekhshur as it were, we
cannot tell you where it is.  However, We garauntee that you'll love
it!
