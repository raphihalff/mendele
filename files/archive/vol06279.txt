Subject: Vey is mir nit

This is an idiom, and I think it is used when something wrong has
befallen someone else.  The meaning is that this woe shall not befall
me.

Subject: Star Spangled Banner in Yiddish

Al Grand (6:270) asked for the lyrics of the "Star-Spangled Banner" in
Yiddish.  I imagine there are a number of translations, but the one
that I recall at the moment is Ber Grin's, which can be found in _In
dinst fun folk; almanakh fun yidishn folks-ordn_, New York: Book
League of the Jewish People's Fraternal Order I.W.O., 1947, p. 112.

                     Star spengld bener

                    fun Frensis Skat Ki

O zog! konstu zen in likht fun sof nakht,
Vos mir hobn bagrist in demer-shayn mit freyd?
Di shtrayfn, di shtern -- in flaker fun shlakht
Fun di shuts-vent mir hobn mit bang in blik bagleyt.

Un der blits fun raket, un der knal fun kanon
Durkh der nakht gerufn hobn zey: es lebt di fon.
O zog! di fon mit di shtern iz zi nokh tsehelt
Iber land fun fraye un iber heym fun held?

Afn breg, durkh neplen fun yam fartunklt,
Vu dem soynes makhne iz fartayet in shrek,
Vos iz es, in bloz fun laykhtn vintl fartunken,
Ot halb-farborgn, ot af a helft antplekt?
Es iz di fon mit di shtern, o, af lang zey tsehelt
Iber land fun fraye un der heym fun held.

O, azoy vet es tomed zayn, ven frayer mentsh mit gever in hant
Bashitsn vet zayn libe heym kegn farlend fun krig un zayn shnit!
Gebentsht mit zig un frid, zol dos land
Loybn di kraft, vos hot undz als folk farhit!

Undzer kamf iz a gerekhter -- undzer iz der nitsokhn,
Zol zayn undzer gebot: "In got iz undzer bitokhn!"
Un di fon mit di shtern, in zig vet zi zayn tsehelt
Iber land fun fraye un der heym fun held!

Presumably an English translation is unnecessary.

Subject: Sholem Asch and Hemingway

I would bet a nickel, maybe a dime, that I am not alone in harboring a
deep interest in the elusive facts that Miriam B. Mandel (vol 6.273)
garnered through Mendele steering her to information about Asch and
Hemingway via Asch's grandson.

We would be happy if she shared the information with us.

Subject: Bernshteyn's _Yidishe shprikhverter un rednsartn_

The toilet-and-bedroom supplement to Ignats Bernshteyn's _Yidishe
shprikhverter un rednsartn_ is available on the Web and in book form
with foreign-language interpretation and glossing, as we now know.
What about the core material?

Subject: JHS preprints and reprints series

The  revival  of  Jewish  scholarship in the CIS and the  Baltic
states  has already produced dozens of research articles, monographs,
bibliographies  and source  studies.  These  enthusiastic efforts  of
authors  demanded   prompt publication. This demand was met by the
Jewish Heritage Society Preprints and Reprints series program.

The  JHS  Preprints and Reprints series attracted many Judaica
scholars  in Russia,   Moldova,   Ukraine,  Belarus  and  the
Baltics.  The  authors  are especially excited about the fact that
their research would not have to  wait years for publication in a
scholarly journal.  It is also very important  for scholars   to
discover a certain demand for their intellectual  product  and that
they  could  expect possible feedback from colleagues  working  in
the field. The program also contributes to establishing  professional
ties  among scholars worldwide and fosters a vigorous exchange of
ideas.

Society's Web site): http://www.glasnet.ru/~heritage/

Subject: Yiddish Studies in South Sweden

_Are_ there some?

They should be, due to at least two emigrations vogues from Poland, in
40's and '68. But the younger among the '68-deportees were probably
not Yiddish speakers. Some elder people I knew, who were, are not
longer alive.

By South Sweden I mean the Lund-Malmoe area, as I am working at the
University of Lund. Even Copenhague counts as Lund-Malmoe area, as it
is only an hour's journey from my home.

Subject: A WWW page about Polish roots

The first contribution in Mendele Vol 6.273 gave the URL of a home
page which the author described as "one superb site" for obtaining
pictures and info <sic> about "...our roots in Poland."

He neglects to mention that he is the author of the recommended page,
and that it is a fee for service proposition.  There is no online
database or images.

A far better place to initiate an internet jewish roots search is:

	http://www.jewishgen.org/

and, specifically for Polish shtetls, scroll down the page and
select the "JewishGen ShtetLinks Project" link, or surf directly to:

	http://www.jewishgen.org/shtetlinks/directory.html

Subject: A WWW page about Polish roots

Harold Boll's post (see above) is well-taken and the shames is
embarrassed at not having checked the website before running the
notice.

Mendele has always tried to balance its unwillingness to serve as a
vehicle for profit-making ventures with its commitment to keep readers
informed.  That is how and why the supplement "Personal notices and
announcements" came into being.

The reverse side is of course the expectation that ads be clearly
labelled as such.  The poster did not do so.  Nor has he apologized
for his conduct as requested.  He is no longer with us.
