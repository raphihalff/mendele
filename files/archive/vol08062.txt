Subject: Does anyone know some verses to a song from my childhood?

Something just brought to mind a very irreverent song I learned from my
non-believing parents,  but I can only remember one verse:

Der rebbe tut vunder
Ich chob alein gezayn
Er Gayt arein in vasser
Un kumt arois a nasser!

I know there is a refrain  and many more verses.  Anyone there who can help??

A shaynem un hartsiken dank

Subject: Camp No Worries

A friend who is preparing for publication a book of poems which mentions the
camp which Allen Ginsberg's parents attended would like to know the correct
romanized spelling of the camp's name:  Kemp Nitgedayget?  Nishtgedayget? 
Oddly enough in Ginsberg's book Kaddish the name is spelled as if in German,
Nichtgedeiget... Does anyone know what spelling was actually in use? 

Thanks

Would anyone have any idea about the derivation of, "Shmear zikh oys de
shekh"?

Subject: Meiven

What is the origin of "meyven"?  I know that it can mean expert.  But it can
also be used to poke fun at "so-called" experts.  I recall my mother, of
blessed memory use the phrase: "Er iz a meiven azei vi a khazer oyf Heiven". 
i.e. "He is an expert just as a pig is with yeast." I've always thought that
to been charming.

Subject: Hershele leybt!

What is available in English of Hershel Ostropoler's wit? A collected volume
might well be the comedian's equivalent of the Physician's Desk Reference.I
remember with fondness my father's relating, in English, escapades of "Harry
and the Boys".  In one story, Hershele was complaining bitterly to a friend
that his landlady threw his pants down the stairs. When asked what was so
terrible about that, Hershele replied, "I was still in them at the time." 

It was just as funny when I heard Morey Amsterdam tell it 55 years later.

Subject: The Forvitz

To my very worthy Mendeler friends,

First a Happy New Year, A Gut Yuhr, Shana Tovah, mit gezunt un parnusseh un
nakhos fun kinder un eyniklakh, biz khutch a hundert un tzvantzig. 

I learned to read and write Yidish as a child, and luckily retained some of
it to this day, yet I find it much more difficult writing Yidish using
anglo-saxon characters, and prefer by far to use the Hebrew ones, so please
excuse the fact I have translated my thoughts into English. My father was an
avid reader of the paper, and as he got older he began asking me to read it
to him since his "eyes hurt". We both knew it was his way to keep me fluent
reading and writing the language. As a young man I noticed a peculiarity in
the way the Forvitz printed its name in the heading of its newspaper, and
when I asked my father about it, even as a long time reader, he did not have
an answer. I have asked the question of many people, and have not really had
a response with which I might say I was satisfied. So I will put it to you
Mendelayners, and hopefully someone will provide what I have been searching
for these past fifty years or more. 

The Condition: The title name of the Forvitz printed with Hebrew characters
is: fey, aleph, raysh, vav, vav, eyein raysh, tess, samakh, which clearly
spells Forvitz. 

Question: Why is the last sound tz spelled with tess, samach and not with a
tzadik, that is end-tzadik as one might expect it to? Nu?

What is the origin of the names "Shapiro" and (I assume related) "Spiro"?

Subject: Rumeniye

A friend of mine would like to play the Yiddish standard "Rumeniye" for his
Sunday school class (6th grade) and discuss it a bit, but does not have a
transcription of the lyrics.  If anyone has both the Yiddish lyrics and an
English translation, I would very much like to be able to pass it on to him. 

a sheynem dank!

Subject: Yiddish poems about teaching

I have been asked to write some music in honor of a very gifted teacher of
music in Boston. I would like to find a Yiddish poem about teaching to set to
original music. Can any of you suggest a poem (it need not rhyme) that would
be appropriate? Something about either the value of education, the joy of
teaching, the importance of teaching or sharing music, or a similar theme? 

If you are able to provide bibliographic information for the poem, background
info about the poet, and a transliteration of the text either by e-mail or
snail-mail (write me directly for my snail-mail address; I can find the
yidishe oysyes on my own with a good bibliographic reference), I would really
appreciate it. 

A hartsikn dank,
Rhoda (Rokhl) Bernard
