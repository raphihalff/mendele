Subject: Fornal

In Polish (whence also in Ukrainian) _fornal_ is a farm worker,
especially one who works with horses.  It originally meant the hook that
is used to attach the wagon- or plow-pole to the traces (part of the
harness) and is derived from German _Vornagel_.

Subject: Voroshilovka

In Mendele 3.344 Zachary Baker identified the location of Voroshilovka in
Ukraine, citing _Where Once We Walked-, an extremely useful gazeteer.
Another useful source for tracking down locations in the Russian empire
is the _Russisches geographisches Namenbuch_, ed. Max Vasmer and Herbert
Bra"uer, published in 11 volumes (plus map supplement) by Harrasowitz in
Wiesbaden between 1964 and 1989.  It identifies Voroshilovka, for
example, as a small town or village at the confluence of the rivers Baran
and Bug, in the Tyrovsk _volost'_ of the Vinnitsa _krai_ of the Podolia
_guberniia_ (using the pre-revolutionary territorial divisions) and
refers to V. K. Guld'man, _Podol'skaia guberniia..._
(Kamenets-Podol'skii, 1889).  It also lists three other villages (in the
Kostroma _guberniia_), Bol'shaia [Big] Voroshilovka, Malaia [Little]
Voroshilovka and Sredniaia [Middle-sized] Voroshilovka.

Subject: Dropped pronouns

In heavily declined languages the pronoun is frequently redundant and
therefore is easily dropped. One sees this very strongly in Spanish: e.g.
"quiero ir","quieres beber?", etc.  In Yiddish I have always felt that
there is an additional impetus coming from the Hebrew usage of postfixed
pronouns yielding such polyglot formations as "bistu gekumen?" From there
it is a short step to drop the postfixed "u". What started off as the
inverted order of the interogative form, once becoming a postfixed
addition to the already declined verb, was perceived as a redundant
addition to the already properly employed declension. Of course this is
only a conjecture on my part and I would be interested in hearing the
customary cavilling that is sure to follow.

Subject: Re: Priziv

Rick Glidemeister asks about priuv.  I believe that the word sought for
is PRIZIV.... In the folk song Yoshke fort avek.."  where the girl sings
OY OY Der ban is shoyn gekumen, un es khapt mich on a shrek  with the
chorus being Oy Oy yoshke fort avek.... , Yoshke replies in the next
verse that "ich vel fonye dinen" (I will serve the tsar"... she
sings..."Koyf mir nit keyn lokenes (earrings?) und macht mir nit sheyn.
Koyf dir a por shtivelach (boots) , in priziv darfst du gayn". Her reply
in the song suggests that he is going into the tsar's long service.

This is a wonderful song for singing in duets for a Yiddish folk song
concert...when I do a concert...however, I play both parts...and it still
sounds broad humor-ish.

A shaynem dank far all the interesting mail from Mendelniks.

Subject: Preglen

Leigh Lisker: My own very vague memory about a possible Slavic connection
to preglen also stems from Uriel Weinreich. Can we compromise on
something like "I don't know, but maybe it's . . . "?

In any event, Bob Rothstein has just reported three entries in Grimm:
bra"geln, pra"geln, and pregeln."The last two entries," he says, "cite
Schade's hypothesis on a Slavic origin."

So, to add to Ellen Prince's pro-drops, go figure. -:)
