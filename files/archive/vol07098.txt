Subject: Shakespeare's _The Merchant of Venice_ in Yiddish

Shakespeare's _The Merchant of Venice_ has been a subject of constant interest
among Yiddish writers for decades.  No one has yet fully scanned the
voluminous periodical literature on the subject.  The following sketch of the
subject varies slightly from my treatment in _Yiddish Culture in Britain_
(1990).

TRANSLATIONS

There have been many translations and adaptations of MV in Yiddish,
including a number of narrative prose versions.  _Der koyfman fun
venedig (shylok) / ertsehlung / nokh sheksper's komedye / mit bilder_,
translated by F. (Warsaw, 1897/1898, 30 pp.) was the earliest prose
narrative version.  YIVO owns a copy of this scarce book.  F. is
probably Meyer-Yankev Freyd (see Leksikon fun nayer yidisher literatur
7:494; no place or date of publication is indicated).  F.'s version was
followed by A.S.  Halperin's prose _Shylock_ (Warsaw:  Tsukermans
folks-bibliotek, 1904, 32 pp.) and Mortkhe Holtsblat's similarly titled
prose version (Warsaw:  Goldfarb (Helios), [1928/1929].  Mortkhe
Holtsblat [Mordekhai Holzblat] was M. Zamler [M.  Samler].  The young
poet Yoysef Bovshover's somewhat germanized _Shylock or The Merchant of
Venice_ first appeared in Alexander Harkavy's _Der nayer gayst_ ('The
New Spirit') [New York, 1899] and was published in book form several
times:  _Shylock_ (New York:  Katzenellenbogen, [1899], 116 pp.);
_Shylock_ (New York:  Hebrew Publishing Co., 1911, 116 pp.).  (There may
also have been a 1902 edition).  Translations of MV in manuscript
include one by A. Goldberg [handwritten ms. in the Yivo archives]; one
by Abish Maizels, produced in London (1946) [typescript in Labor
Archives, Bet Lessin, Tel Aviv]; one by Mark Shvayd [Shweid] [ms. in
Yivo archives], one by Moyshe Shor [in Yivo archives]; and one other by
an unknown hand [in Yivo archives].  Zalmen Zylberzweig (_Lexicon of the
Yiddish Theatre_ 2:1260) writes that Avrom Morevski completed a verse
translation of _The Merchant of Venice_ in l926.  Leon Krishtol
(1894-1959) translated _The Merchant of Venice_ for the New York Yiddish
stage [according to Leksikon fun nayer yidisher literatur 8:266], but
there does not seem to be a record of the whereabouts of the ms.  M.-Y.
Pomerants wrote a letter to the editor of _Teater shpigl_ (November
1946) asking "Ver is take geven der ershter iberzetser fun shekspers
'Soykher fun venedik' oyf yidish?"  (p. 10), which is followed by A.
Mayzel's reply, "Mayn entfer tsu mr. pomerants" (pp. 10-11).  Pomerants
writes that Vilyem Edlin [William Edlin] translated all of Shakespeare's
works into Yiddish.  A.A.  Roback points out that it was D.M.  Hermolin,
not Edlin.

THEATER HISTORY:

The theater history of _The Merchant of Venice_ in English includes
productions where the role of Shylock was spoken in Yiddish or in a
Yiddish-sounding English.

In 1821 the London-born Junius Brutus Booth (1796-1852) of the famous
Booth family of actors moved to America where he became the leading
Shakespearian actor of his period.  For some unrecorded reason he
claimed to be of Jewish descent and, as reported in _The Reader's
Encyclopaedia of Shakespeare_ (ed.  Oscar James Campbell, New York:
Thomas Y. Crowell, 1966, p. 77) "played Shylock with a Jewish accent."
It would be very interesting to know what this accent was like and who
its living models were.  M.J. Landa writes that Booth is reported to
have played Shylock in Hebrew in 1818, which he rightly dismisses as
absurd (_The Jew in Drama_, p. 85).  To this day Gentiles -- and some
Jews!  -- confuse Hebrew and Yiddish.  Booth may have played Shylock in
his imitation of contemporary Jewish English, either in its Sefardic or
Ashkenazic varieties.  It was probably the latter and thus influenced
principally by Western Yiddish.  We learn that Booth "was troubled by
intermittent bouts of insanity and alcoholism;" _he_ may have thought he
was speaking Hebrew when he played Shylock.

According to the _Universal Jewish Encyclopedia_ ("Theatre" X, 216), "An
actor named Sherenbeck, described as a 'Rochester-Israelite', acted
Shylock in Yiddish" at the benefit of Miss Helen Faucit on July 9, 1817,
at Covent Garden.  Landa writes:  "But there was no Yiddish translation
at that time.  The 'Jewish dialect' was the broken English in which all
Jewish parts of the play were played."  (_The Jew in Drama_, p. 85).

Yankev P. Adler in New York in 1903 played the role of Shylock _in
Yiddish_ in an English-language production [Ref:  _Leksikon fun yidishn
teater_1:21].  Witter Bynner, drama critic for _Critic_ wrote of "Jacob
Adler's masterful Shylock" (July 1905, p. 26).

M.J. Landa has written:  "...it is the sober and interesting fact that
when Maurice Moscovitch played Shylock in Yiddish at the Pavilion
Theatre in the East End of London sometime before he appeared in the
character in English in the West End, the Jewish audiences roared with
laughter at the trial scene.  They were bewildered by the whole piece
and could not understand why it had such a hold over people and why it
enjoyed its extraordinary reputation in English....  They could not take
the play seriously.  To them it was the worst form of travesty - -
mockery."  (M.J.  Landa, _The Shylock Myth_, London:  W.H.  Alden, 1942,
p. 38.)  [This section is indexed in Landa's book under "Yiddish
laughter at the trial scene."]

In 1920 Moskovitsh ended his career as a Yiddish actor when he started
to play the role of Shylock in English at the Royal Court Theatre.  The
production ran for nine months in London and an additional month in
Manchester; M.M. toured the world as Shylock for a decade (see Y.
Podruzhnik's review, "Moshkovitsh's shaylok," _Renesans_ 1 [1920]).
Morris Schwartz likewise appeared in scenes from _The Merchant of
Venice_ on the Keith Vaudeville Circuit in 1930.  Many English-language
productions of _The Merchant of Venice_ have had Shylock speak English
with a recognizably "Jewish" [read "Yiddish"] accent of the sort
affected by Fagin in the film version of the musical _Oliver_.

In "Teater velt / adlers trupe un moshkovitshes shaylok" (_Unzer veg_
1:11/12 [19 December 1919], 11-12), A[aron] K[rolenbaum] writes that
"Moshkovitsh hot in der englisher vi in der yidisher prese shoyn
aroysgerufn kemat a gantse literatur mit zayn shpiln:  di englishe
retsenzentn zaynen iberasht fun zayn yidishkayt in der role, di yidishe
-- fun zayn anti-yidishkayt.  Ver iz gerekht?"  ('Moskowitz's acting has
produced practically an entire literature in both the English and
Yiddish press:  the English reviewers are impressed with how Jewish he
is in the role [of Shylock], the Jewish reviewers -- with how
anti-Jewish.  Who is right?').  A.K. goes on to say that neither is
right, for Moshkovitsh sins against art more than he sins against the
Jews.

Many great Yiddish actors have been drawn to MV in Yiddish and have not
succumbed to the lure of the larger English-language theater world.
Ayzik Samberg was one of a line of notable Shylocks.

In the last production of the play in Yiddish in Britain, at the New
Yiddish Theatre in 1946, the director was Robert Atkins, a non-Jew.
Abish Mayzels [Meisels] did the translation; Meyer Tselniker [Zelniker]
played Shylock.  Of this production, the _Manchester Guardian_ (11
September 1946) wrote:  "...a new translation by Mr. A. Meisels which is
much better that that presented by Mr. Moscowitch in this region before
he went on the English stage.  It is literal and exact and occasionally
reaches the poetical" (see British press reviews in _Teater shpigl_
[October 1946]).

Other reviewers wrote:  _Evening Standard_ (14 September 1946):  "It was
not the first time that "The Merchant" has been played by Yiddish
actors, but hitherto the part of Shylock has been mellowed and almost
robbed of offense.  Not so Mr. Meisel's version which we saw on Monday
night.  It is a literal translation."  A.B.L. in _Jewish Chronicle_ (13
September 1946):  "Mr.  Meisel's text is remarkable for faithfulness to
the original.  It makes few concessions to soft-pedalling the vicious
side of Shylock.  But the few are significant."  _News Chronicle_ (9
September 1946):  "You will hear a translation so close and literal that
you always know where you are."

SHYLOCK THEME:

The Shylock theme has been developed by many Yiddish writers.  Moyshe
Broderzon wrote a sketch called "Shaylok lakht" ('Shylock Laughs'), in
which the central character is Edmund Kean (reprinted in Moyshe
Broderzon, _Oysgeklibene shriftn_, Buenos Aires:  Joseph Lifshitz Fund,
1959, pp. 163-170).  Ref:  Moyshe Rubin, _Tipn un geshtaltn_
Buenos-Aires, 1939 [ch. on _Merchant of Venice_]; Yankev-Shmuel Toybes
[Jacob Samuel Taubes], "Bamerkung tsu shekspers 'shaylok'", _Oyf yidishe
yesoydes_, London:  Naroditski, 1948, pp. 39-45; Zilbertsvayg, Z.
_Leksikon fun yidishn teater_ 5:4647-4648. See, too

_Shakespeare and Shylock by Avrom Morevski (Translated into English by
Mirra Ginsburg, St.  Louis, MO:  Fireside Books, n.d.  [1967]).  The
original, Morevski's Yiddish essay on Shylock (Vilna, 1937), was
dedicated to Muni Weisenfreund [= Paul Muni].  Morevski concludes here
that "Shakespeare is ever with man who is oppressed and persecuted"
(p.95).  Moris Shvarts [Maurice Schwartz] adapted and produced Ari
Even-Zahav's _Shylock and His Daughter_, inspired by Shakespeare's
_Merchant of Venice_.

Subject: To Accompany: bagleytn oder baleytn?

Al Grand thought he found a misprint in Weinreich (7.095, 9).  I would have
thought the same had I noticed that _accompany_ was defined as baleytn, not
bagleytn.  In the Y-E section, it's clear that Weinreich prefers baleytn.
Look up bagleyt... and he refers you to baleyt....

Harkavy lists bagleytn and defines it, while he gives baleytn as equal to
bagleytn.  Harkavy seems to prefer bagleytn.

Stutshkof list both, each with apparently the same meaning.

It seems obvious that the German _begleiten_ is the root.  Yiddish not only
changed the vowels (very ordinary), but (for some) dropped the g.  Any other
examples?  Linguists help?

From: "Fogel, George" <George.Fogel@fhwa.dot.gov>
Subject: Still more about "Schmoozing"

According to the November, 1997 issue of "Inside Borders" (a free periodical
published and distributed by the Borders Bookstore chain) November is Jewish
Book Month.  One of the books listed is "Schmoozing" by Joshua Halberstam
(Perigee Books $13.00, paperback). If I might quote from the blurb:  "From the
rigorously observant to the resolutely atheistic, Jews talk about exactly what
it means to be Jewish in America.  This book captures private conversations
about assimilation in middle-class suburbs, the lasting legacy of the
Holocaust, persisting stereotypes, the ancient roots of Judaism, the latest
developments in Israel, the Jew in popular culture, and much more."  I would
gather that the auther considers the word a synonym for a good heart to heart
talk, which is what I've always understood it to mean.

For what it's worth, I too have heard schmoozing used in the "butter up
somone" sense, and like Al Grand, it has alway grated on my ears.  For
better or for worse, I've always chalked it up to the Yiddishization of
America, via the Catskills.

Subject: The Merchant of Venice in Yiddish:

I have a hunch, based on intertextual evidence from the turn of the (last)
century, that _The Merchant of Venice_ was colloquially known simply as
"Shaylok" in Yiddish-speaking Eastern Europe as early as the mid-19th
century.

Subject: shmooze

Al Grand is right about shmooze:  chatting, conversing, something quite
informal and relaxed.  But as to dealing with someone who needs buttering up,
the best word is "shmeer."  It might also help in bribing someone, as the case
may be.

Subject: Eugene Debs

Dear Mendele:

I am in dire need of locating any speeches, writings, or clips by or about
Eugene Debs and his giving talks to Jewish groups. Also, does anyone have any
info on the talk he gave at the Thalia Theater in Chicago around 1897 to a
jewish labor group? This is for my research project!
    
Thank You,
Sincerely,
Shana Lipsker
