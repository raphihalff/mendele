Subject: Splitting the list

in response to patty becker's suggestion, i for one certainly have no
problem with splitting the list. it would be a pleasure, in fact, to be
able to discuss the yiddish language on the (only) yiddish list without
hearing complaints about 'suffering in silence' etc. (would that they
did!)

but first a few things.

1. just out of curiosity, may i ask those who are unhappy why they joined
an academic list on yiddish--yes, mendele is an academic list on
yiddish--if they have no interest in academic questions about yiddish?

2. but perhaps some recent (and not-so-recent) arrivals may not be aware
of the history of mendele and its intended nature. once upon a time,
there was a list called mail.jewish, run by dave sherman. it was very
eclectic. some among us wanted a place where we could have more serious
discussions (and not receive the less serious ones). to this end, thanks
to noyekh miller, the list was split into mail.jewish, to continue as the
'less serious' list, and mendele, the new 'more serious' list. some time
thereafter, dave decided to can mail.jewish and now mendele is all there
is.

3. if dave is still willing, or if there's someone else out there able
and willing, i propose that mail.yiddish be resurrected, with the two
lists having their originally intended purposes and with subscribers
taking care to post their msgs to the appropriate list.

Subject: Matke Boske/Meylekh Sobieskis tsaytn

Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan:

My guess is that the expression your mother used to describe something
very old is  not "fun der Matke Botkes tsaytn", but Matke Boskes, from
Polish [Matka Boska] , literally, mother of God, referring to the Virgin
Mary.

The other phrase used to denote something very old is "fun dem Meylekh
Sobieskis tsaytn" which refers to the Polish king Jan Sobieski who drove
the Turks from Vienna in 1683 . A very long time ago, indeed.  That might
have sounded to your friend like "Eretze Betzkes tzeitn".  Just a guess.

Doesn't this usually refer to the Black Madonna of Czentstochowa. Or is
it the name of the Virgin Mary in Polish?

Subject: Miriam Raskin

Max Rosenfeld of Philadelphia requests biographical information about
Miriam Raskin, born in Slonim, White Russia in 1889 and died in New York
on October 18th, 1973.

She was an active member of the Bund in Russia and served a year in
Petersburg prison.

Emigrated to the U.S. in 1920. Her first stories were published in
Tsukumft. Later stories were published in the Forverts. In 1941 a
collection of her work was published under the title "Shtile Lebns".

A copy of the book is not available to Max. Does anyone know where a copy
can be located.

Subject: Uvular 'r' in Russian

1.  Years ago, chatting with an elderly Soviet jurist, I noticed that in
Russian he regularly used the uvular 'r'.  (He was patently not Jewish.)
I asked him about it, saying that I had been told it used to be a mark of
the (French-literate) aristocracy.  He grinned nervously and said it used
to be a mark of the gilded youth (zolotaia molodezh', jeunesse doree).
Later someone told me that that jurist was the son (left side of the bed)
of a prince.

2.  In a book of anecdotes published in the Soviet Union toward the end
of the Soviet period appears the following (which seems to refer by
innuendo not to aristocrats but to Jews):

Interviews with applicants for a post at a desirable research institute
are conducted by a computer, which initiates each conversation.

(First applicant)  Computer: Zdravstvuite (hello).  Applicant:
Zdravstvuite.  C: Have you any relatives abroad?  A: Yes.  C: Goodbye.

(Second applicant)  C: Zdravstvuite.  A: Zdravstvuite.  C: Have you any
relatives abroad?  A: No.  C: Were you ever convicted of a crime? A: Yes.
C: Goodbye.

(Third applicant)  C: Zdravstvuite.  A: Zdravstvuite.  C: Have you any
relatives abroad?  A: No.  C: Were you ever convicted of a crime? A: No.
C: Were you ever expelled from the Party?  A: Yes.  C: Goodbye.

(Fourth applicant)  C: Zdravstvuite.  A: Zdgavstvuite.  C: Goodbye.

Raphael (refoyl) Finkel:

as you guessed, "forshtot" (also "firshtot") is just a part of Grodne
proper: suburb.

Subject: Dav(e)nen/gedabrt

Thanks to all who replied.  This riddle from _A khazene oyf shabes_ has
been bugging me for years.  I especially like the suggestion that the
"br" sound may be an imitation of the horse, or the wagoners call, though
I agree with Perl Teitelbaum that "Brrr" is likely used to make a horse
stop, not to make him go.  I mean, the theme of the song is how each of
the tree balebotim perceives the khazn's performance to mesh perfectly
with his personal everyday life.  So, for the balagole, a sound from his
daily work enters even the word he uses instead of "davnen".
