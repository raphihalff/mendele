0Subject: Kartuz B(e)reze

As Michael Steinlauf indicates, the Yiddish name for Bereza Kartuska is
Kartuz B(e)reze.  In 1993, a memorial book for the Jewish community was
published:  Kartuz-Berezah; sefer zikaron ve-'edut le-kehilah
she-hushmedah hy"d [English title-page: Kartuz-Breze, our town; memorial
book].  It is primarily in Hebrew, with an English introduction and some
poems in Yiddish.

Subject: Response to an [RR]

The recent posting by Anno Siegel (4.236,2) was signed off with "Zayt ir
ale gezunt, [RR]."  Permit me to review this sentence.

"Ir ale" sounds to me redundant.  Might it be a literal translation from
the English "you all"?  (or possibly the influence of another language?)

Formally and grammatically "ale" is not necessary here since "zayt" is
plural (the singular is "zay").

Still, "zayt *ale* gezunt" sounds to me friendly and informal, expressing
warmth, like offering not just a collective parting to the entire group,
but an individual "zay gezunt" to each one present.

Whether you use "zay" or "zayt" depends, of course, not only according to
the number of people, but also on the nature of the relationship.  If you
_irts_ each other, you use the plural form even if you are addressing
your words to an individual.

There are two possible variants:   a)  "Zay mir gezunt" or "Zay zhe mir
gezunt" (singular);   b)  "Zayt mir gezunt" or "zayt zhe mir gezunt"
(plural).

Both these variants are colloquial and familial:

1.  "Zay (or zayt) mir gezunt" is a way of courteously and warmly
terminating a brief encounter with acquaintances or friends.

2.  "Zay (or zayt) zhe mir gezunt" may occasionally connote -- but not
necessarily and not always-- a minute but unarticulated touch of
annoyance. If you have, for example, a friendly argument and you become
convinced that your esteemed opponent is close-minded and not ready to
see the light of your logic, you close the discussion with "zay (or zayt)
zhe mir gezunt."

On the other hand, however,  "zay (or zayt) zhe mir gezunt" can also be a
very friendly and warm closure of a conversation.

So, you see, it all depends...

This response to an [RR] developed into a lengthy shmu'es about the
sign-off phrase.  May I say that an [RR] preceding a posting to Mendele
is not expected to enter into the kind of digressions and "side" tours,
as in the present comment, but will be delimited to just shaping up the
Yiddish of the text as submitted.

Well, zayt mir ale gezunt un shtark!

Subject: "a styfbruder fun ayn muter"

[This is] forwarded this from the Jewish Genealogy Digest.  Has some
questions about Yiddish.  Perhaps someone could help him.

>From: richard sobel <d1992@pucc.princeton.edu>

Opinions on a Yiddish and relationship questions would be much
appreciated: In the Yizkor book for Horodetz, my gggf is described (in
transliterated) Yiddish as "a styfbruder fun ayn muter," rendered by a
translator as "a stepbrother (from the same mother)."  What would people
interpret this to mean--simply a relationship through remarriages or a
biological relationship through the mother (and wouldn't that actually
mean halfbrothers)? The dates don't work out for a biological
relationship, so thoughts on the meaning would be most welcome.  (Also
can someone identify the meaning of "Ein-Yaakov"?)  RS
