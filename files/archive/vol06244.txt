The long discussions on Soviet orthographic changes [6.238-42] are
endlessly fascinating.  Numbers of Mendelistn have noted the several
complex currents of thought and social action that may have affected
the movement for change, and it may well be the case that there was no
one reason.

One more current, so far not mentioned, is that revolutions in
typography were going on elsewhere in the world as well, transcending
any internal debate within Yiddish letters.  Yiddish artists, however
-- from New York painters like Louis Lozowick to Soviet graphic
designers -- were keenly attuned to these developments.  Certainly the
single most important locus for the new typographic style was among
designers associated with the Bauhaus in Weimar Germany, to whom early
Soviet Constructivists, including notably El Lissitzky, had very close
and influential ties.  (Even before Lissitzky became part of that
circle, it should be remarked, he had worked on Jewish book
illustrations under the young Commissar Chagall in Vitebsk.)

The innovations of these avant gardists were not simply in type
design, but in sweepingly new approaches to asymmetrical page layout
and other graphic features.  And there were, it must be said, parallel
Modernist typographers at work in Palestine, creating a bold new
esthetic in Hebrew typeface, all driven by a conscious and explicit
ideological agenda.  As for Yiddish, one need only look at book and
periodical covers published in the 20s, and not just in Germany or the
Soviet Union.  In New York, the cover design for the _Gezamlte verk_
of Vintshevsky (Freiheit, 1927), for example, epitomizes the
machine-age esthetic.   Or in Warsaw, the _Geklibene verk_  of the
critic Bal-Makhshoves (Bikher, 1929) provides a stunning example.
Similarly, covers I have seen of the journals _In zikh_ (New York) or
_Yidish teater_ (Warsaw) were visually interchangeable with
Russian-language Constructivist publications coming out of Germany.

Having said that, I have no doubts that when orthographic changes were
discussed at a policy-making level, these artists were not part of the
equation.  Lissitzky, in fact, had specifically articulated the
principle that typographic design should be based *not* on phonetic
criteria, but on optical ones.  There were also competing
developments.  With the rise of the proletarian art movement,
ideologically engaged artists favored wood- and linoleum-block prints,
the techniques of which produced distinctive visual forms.  Crucially,
they also produced an associated stylized typography widely practiced
among American Yiddish book designers.  The title page, for example,
of E. Korman's beautifully-produced anthology _Yidishe dikhterin_
(Chicago:  L.M. Shteyn, 1928) to my eye deftly integrates a wood-cut
influenced typeface into a Constructivist graphic design.

Whatever else may have been in play, and however the changes were
implemented, the idea that a radical change in the appearance and
organization of text could and should reflect the radical changes
overtaking the social order had clearly originated at the level of the
designers and had been a part of the Soviet cultural apparatus from
the earliest days of the Revolution.  This current of thought ought
not be dismissed from the discussion.

Subject: Ende/shlekhte tsadik

Joachim Neugroschel [6.242] mentioned 'shlekhte tsadik' as another
name for 'ende tsadik', stating that shlekht in this instance means
straight.

Reluctantly running the risk of us two turning into a mendele version
of Shammai and Hillel I would like to very humbly serve up an
alternative suggestion. Not khas ve'sholem for the sake of it, but
because it sounds strange that a word like shlekht which is never used
in Yiddish for anything other than bad, wicked or rotten should be
used on the letter tsadik and mean straight.

So here is my pshat. The tsadik stands out from the rest of the set of
ende oysiyes, for whereas all the other consonants do not mean
anything and merely represent the letter of their name, tsadik also
means a righteous man.

From this, the ende tsadik has become the antithesis of the tsadik. If
one is described as an ende tsadik it means a yents tsadik or a
pretentious tsadik or even something of a playboy.

Children of ivre learning age are also often teased (usually by men of
a certain age and disposition), 'vos bist di a tsadik oder an ende
tsadik? in the same way that they are asked, 'vos is vayigash geveyn,
a tsadik oder a roshe? or in an Anglophone version, vos iz boy geveyn,
a yingl oder a maydl?

Is it therefore not possible that instead of calling the ende tsadik
an outright roshe it became the 'shlekhte tsadik'?

Subject: Soviet Yiddish orthography

Adding to the discussion of whether the reasons for Soviet Yiddish
orthography was ideological or educational, I have read that, in
certain circles in the United States, you could subtly call someone a
Communist in print by calling him a "chaver" (comrade) and spell it in
the phonetic Yiddish way, rather than the traditional Hebrew spelling.
