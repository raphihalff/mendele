thanks, nick, but it's precisely the sentences in which
they are 'just fillers and don't refer to anything' that
i'm interested in. would you understand a sentence with one
of these 'fillers' EXACTLY the same way you would
understand the same sentence without it? a dank.

Subject: A.A. Roback

Can someone explain the apparent disregard of the
Yiddish-related work & thought of A(braham) A(aron) Roback
(1890-1965), psychologist (Harvard, maybe) and Yiddishist?
The libraries here at State University of NY at Buffalo
have many of his books in English, mostly on psychology but
some on Jewish topics, and one in German (psychology).  He
seems to have been a heavy contributor to Yiddish
periodicals, specializing in issues of Yiddish usage,
orthography, grammar, and so on.  Two collections of his
pieces appear as *Di imperye yidish* and *Der folksgayst in
der yidisher shprakh*.  I believe that some of his work was
published by YIVO, but he has sharp criticisms of some of
the dicta of the YIVO regularizers, e.g., Max Weinreich.
He was upset, for example, by the loss of non-inital
shtumer alef; his distress seemed partly based on
esthetics, but also on grounds of legibility. He asks us
(in *Der folskgayst*) to consider the made-up but possible
name "Vuvulski", which in pre-YIVO oysleyg would be [tsvey
vovn-alef-vov-alef-tsvey vovn-alef-vov-lamed-samekh-kuf-yud],
but which would require six consecutive vovn in YIVO style:
[tsvey vovn-vov-tsvey vovn-vov-lamed...] (Roback
disapproves of any nikudes except in pasekh-alef and
komets-alef.)  "Es heybt on poshet shvindlen in di oygn
..."

(The shtumer alef is of course not daytshmerish, nor is it
potato- [or vinde-] Yiddish.  What WAS the point of the
ruthless stripping?)

A related proposal by Roback:  Yiddish should make use of
the doublets *idish* (shtumer alef-yud...) and *yidish*
(yud-yud...), the first to mean "Jewish", and the second
"Yiddish".  This seems a reasonable attempt to
disambiguate. So "Mendele, Sholom Aleichem un (lehavdl)
Norman Mailer zaynen ale idishe shraybers, ober nor Mendele
un Sholem Aleichem zaynen yidishe."  Is there anything
wrong with the reasoning here?

Subject: ES and other matters
 
Dave: re the "es" that I asked about. I have it recorded in
Kovno. I've often heard it but never stopped to think about
it. Some of your qu to me are precisely the ones I need
answered.
 
Another teaser: the "a" in  the following:
 
   ver es hot anor farshtanen un ver es hot anor gevolt
 
ANYONE?

To return to some lingering questions:

Yiddish "pots" (rhymes with "klots") from which English
"putz" (rhymes with "guts") is, of course, NOT an acronym
although the euphemism "pey tsadik" makes it seems so. It
derives from a form widespread in the Aegean area (cf.
Turkish where it means 'cleft in the buttocks' and Greek
'penis', I think). I wonder if it came West (along with
croissants, perhaps) in French "put"-forms, English "pussy"
--does anyone out there know.

As for English "shmuck" (rhymes with "puck") from Yiddish
"shmok" (rhymes with "shtok"), forget the "family jewels"
nonsense. It cannot derive from German Schmuck which would
have yielded a Yiddish variant *shmik. Silly, huh? Best bet
(according to Stankiewicz) is Polish-origin smok (?)
'serpent'.
 
Anyway . . .
 
By the way, the word 'frum' is applied to God/G-d himself
in khumesh-taytsh (See S. Noble in book of the same name).

Subject: Purim terminology

My timing may be off, but I've been wanting to ask this .
Can someone help me on the origin of "Purim-gret".  Somehow
the two words separately don't come out as the final word.
Is there another meaning for "gret" not in Weinreich?
Laundry, hmm :-).
