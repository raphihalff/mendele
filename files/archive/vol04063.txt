Zachary,

I wasn't at Novick's funeral, but I heard a report from someone who had
attended the funeral minutes after it took place.  This person's version
made the story even better (i.e., maybe it happened like you say, maybe
it happened like he said, but this version is the funnier one):  the
speaker (whose name I know for sure is Moyshe Goldshteyn and who is from
the Lomzhe area) was reported to me to have ended his eulogy:  "heri
peysakh novik!" at which point the dialectally disoriented were
momentarily befuddled -- staytsh, Novick's first name was Harry?!

I'll let _you_ divulge the secret of its meaning, Zachary, whenever you
wish to.  zoln zikh di mendele-leyeners a bisl brekhn dem kop.

Subject: Heri zayn ondenk, explained

And the winners are... Shleyme Axelrod and Khayem Bochner!  "Heri zayn
ondenk" is indeed a southeastern Yiddish pronunciation of "ere zayn
ondenk."  If I had subscriptions to "Puzzles Magazine," I'd send you a
free one.  We should do this more often.  I guess that one point I wanted
to illustrate is that even the most obvious of daytshmerizmen take on the
guise of the folkshprakh. A consolation prize, of course, to the
imaginative Evelyn Feins.

Subject: Secular Yiddish Schools

Regarding Zev Hochberg's entry about GElla Schweid Fishman's project on
Yiddish Secular Schools:  I am a product of Workmen's Circle Schools and
I know many others who attended here in Detroit.  I don't know how much
memorabilia I have--a couple of the textbooks and some photos of our
class, I think, plus a lot of memories, and my sister might have kept her
old report cards and such.  Just what is this oral history project
looking for?  Does Ms. Fishman want to do interviews with alumni such as
myself?

I have strong feelings about my shule education.  I am of the generation
that grew up American in English speaking homes, and felt that I lost out
on learning the Jewish history and culture that I needed because it was
taught in Yiddish.  At the same time, the socialization of the shule was
extremely important and, together with the fact that all my family was
involved in Workmen's Circle, provided me with the strong Jewish identity
that is with me still.  Of four marriages among me and my 2 siblings, all
have been to Jews and we are all involved in the humanistic/secular
movement; our kids know what it is to be Jewish and to keep the movement
alive.  (We are 54, 52 and 48 right now, the kids range from 26 to 18,
none are married or even close as yet.)  When I was in college I told
people that Workmen's Circle had been my "church."  It certainly served
as that external force giving me values, heritage, and the strong message
that our mission was to work for a bessere und a shenere velt.

I would be happy to share more of this if Ms. Fishman or anyone else is
interested.

Subject: Havdole plus Yiddish

A friend here in the hills of eastern Connecticut, Ada Nesselroth, told
me that her grandmother used to recite something in Yiddish after the
Havdole ritual at the end of Shabes. She would like to recover the
Yiddish text. Her grandmother was from Lithuania.

Can anyone help? We would be interested in any versions that you send.
