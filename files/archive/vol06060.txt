I will be in Israel next week and would appreciate if somebody could
recommend Yiddish book shops in Jerusalem and Tel-Aviv.

Many thanks,

Subject: Sholom Aleichem Place

The block of East 33rd Street between Park and Madison Avenues in
Manhattan will be renamed Sholom Aleichem Place.  A ceremony is to be
held on the street on Sunday, September 29th (the writer's 80th
yortseit), from 11 to 1. There will be a reading (in Yiddish and in
English) from a Sholom Aleichem story, a perfomance by a klezmer band,
and Bel Kaufman and others are scheduled to speak.

Subject: David Edelshtadt

The revolutionary poet, David Edelshtadt, is buried in the historic
Golden Hill Cemetery in Denver (actually Lakewood), Colorado.  Recently,
I drove out to the cemetery to photograph his gravestone, which is
inscribed with his famous poem, "Mayn Tsavoe" ("My Testament").  I would
like to feature the poem in the next issue of our vinkl's newsletter
("The Vinkl's Voice"). Can anyone direct me to a good English
translation of this important four stanza poem?

A sheynem dank!

Subject: Request for Zionist songs

This request is on behalf of a friend who is preparing a performance of
songs of the Zionist movement for next Yom Ha-atzmaut.  She is looking
for songs from non-European and non-North-American places, such as Latin
America.  Not necessarily in Yiddish or Hebrew, any language. She
prefers sheet music, not recordings.

If anyone has suggestions for sources, please email them to me (or to
mendele if of general interest) and I will pass them on. If anyone wants
to send copies of music, please send them directly to:

    Barbara Slader
    3217 N. E. 18th Ave.
    Portland OR 97212

A shaynem dank,
David Robboy

Here's a post that first appeared on H-Judaic.  I am posting it to
Mendele with the approval of the author.

Because of the current thread on Yiddish may I be allowed to share a
rather intriguing experience?

Buried in one of the Smithsonian Museum's exhibits are the remains of
the ENIAC. Being in the computer field professionally, I decided to make
the dutiful pilgrimage to its shrine, which may be found in the basement
of the Museum of American History.  [This was in summer, 1994. bk]

Just before turning the corner where some of its relics lay I saw
another scene. This showed a living room in the late 30's (?) with a
mother (?) handing over a telephone to a sitting daughter (?) while at
the very front was a grandfather (?) sitting down holding a newspaper to
read.

Since I'm the type of person who can never resist the temptation of
peeking into someone else's newspaper I quietly tip toed over to the
grandpa and craned over his shoulder so as to see what the paper
headlines might read. Imagine my absolute surprise when I read the
paper's banner which stated "Forverts" in the Hebrew alphabet.

The ENIAC's remnants were a real let-down after this experience!

Now, can anyone suggest the reasons why the Smithsonian chose a copy of
the Forverts to use in that particular communications display?

Shana Tova!!!!
