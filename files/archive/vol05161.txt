Subject: Comments on standard yiddish

i feel like the rabbi in the old yiddish joke, the one who hears two
opposing sides of some argument. after hearing the first one, he says,
'you're right.' then, after hearing the second one, he says 'and you're
right.' (and then the rebbetzin butts in, 'what's the matter with you?
they're arguing opposite sides -- they can't both be right!' to which the
rabbi replies, 'and you're right, too.') i thought eliayahu's post on
standards and how they are viewed (or not) by the speaker-in-the-street
was brilliant, better than any treatment of it that i've seen in an intro
to linguistics textbook. and just now i thought khayem's reply about the
democratizing nature of standards was equally brilliant. i'm saving both
posts and hereby warn you that they may someday show up (with proper
acknowledgments, of course) in my intro to linguistics course...  thank
you both for taking the trouble to post them!

Subject: Standard Yiddish and Khayem Bochner

   My heart congratulations to Khayem Bochner for his refreshingly clear
and revealingly personal thoughts on the matter of standard Yiddish,
orthography, textbooks, and dictionaries. These are old questions in
sociolinguistics and applied linguistics that all developing nations have
had to face. It would seem that even for Yiddish, a language without a
state, many of the same processes have taken place.

Subject: Soviet Yiddish songs

I am going to write my master paper about Yiddish songs of Soviet Union
written in the first two  decades of 20th centure. Mostly I am
intereested in revolutionary songs, political Communists song etc.  like
the songs which were collected by Berezhkovsky and published in Moscow in
1934.

I would like to study  the contence of these songs according to the song
which were sang in Soviet Russia about many political leaders  Lenin,
Stalin etc. It is interesting  also to see how Jewish ideas were
transformed in Soviet or simply so-called proletarian songs. For example
the idea of "Gan-eyden" remained inYiddish translation of
"International".

Also what seems curious is that  Edelshtad whose song were also polupar
in Soviet Russia wrote the songs where he compared the struggle of Jews
in  Egypt to proletarian movement ("In dem land fun piramidn") and other
songs. However these ideas are not so polular in this type of songs. The
songs from Berzhkovsky collection   are mostly veryy similar to Russian
songs, only the names of "kapitalistn" are Jewish, which of course not
typical for Soviet songs.

My aim is to  find very typical Jewish idea in such kind of "proletarian=
international" songs which made them different from the songs of other
national proletarian movements . The song "Oy, ir narishe cionistn" is
typical in this sense.

I would be very glad if there would be any comments about this subject.

Subject: Who wrote this poem?

About 15 years ago I read a poem in Yiddish about Yiddish.  It was
appended to a book about Yiddish music which I have since lost. I think I
still know the words quite accurately but have completely forgotten the
title and the author.  Can someone help?

The book used an ad hoc method of transcription geared towards a
German readership, so I'm not at all sure about the spelling.

  ir fregt tsi yidish iz a shprakh,
  gramatish un negidish.
  ikh ken aykh zogn nor a zakh:
  dem yidens shprakh is yidish.

  tsu zukhen ligt nisht in mayn fakh
  fun vanen verter shtamen.
  ikh veys nor, ikh hob lib mayn shprach,
  di loshn fun mayn mamen.

  es mugn geybn undzer pney
  far undzer shprakh kan groshn.
  mir lakhn zikh ale oys fun zey
  un redn mameloshn.
