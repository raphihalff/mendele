Are eyer-kikhl recipes similar to sweet vs. savory kugel and gefilte fish 
recipes with respect to Jewish geography? There are many variations in 
these simple cookies - some are sweet &/or glazed with sugar; some are 
unsweetened or barely sweet. There are some recipes with many more eggs 
proportionate to flour than others. Could these many differences reflect 
geographical and cultural variations rather than individual family 
traditions?

Re: Josh Price's inquiry in Mendele 19.003: eyer-kikhl is a light, airy 
pastry consisting, I believe, mostly of egg white with a little sugar. The 
consistency is something like styrofoam, but crisper (and better 
tasting!). They are bowl-shaped, ranging in size from a child's tea cup to 
a large chopping bowl. They are often sold commercially at Peysakh.

Eyer-kikhl is a little, sweet home baked biscuit, made with eggs, as its 
name suggests.

My grandmother o"h and her four daughters, including my mother o"h, were 
famous (in our family, anyway) for their "eyer-kikhl," which they called 
"Nothings" in English (at least, my mother and aunts called them that; I 
never heard my Bobe utter a word of English, even after 35 years in this 
country).  These were pastries about the diameter of an orange, very light 
(mostly air, it seemed to me), barely sweet, cup-shaped with walls about 
half an inch thick, and the color of khale crust but nothing like it in 
consistency. "Eyer-kikhl" means "egg cake" and "egg pastry," so either egg 
is the key ingredient, or possibly they were called that because they were 
vaguely shaped like half an egg shell.

Josh Price asked about "eyer-kikhl." Here are two internet sources with 
recipes for two different types of these cookies:

There is another kind, for which I do not have a recipe. I remember it 
from my childhood when I would be invited after shabbes dinner by an 
Orthodox Jewish couple in my apartment building. I was asked to say 
kiddush over a small glass of wine and would then have some of these 
cookies for dessert. They were round and flat, not very sweet, with a 
distinctive egg taste.

Frida Cielak requested translations for several words:

1. "oybst" is, I believe, the Yiddish version of the German word "Obst," 
meaning "fruit" as a generic term.

5. "kazyoner" refers to government-appointed rabbis in 19th century 
Russia, so-called "kazyoner rabiner," "Crown" rabbis, who were really 
secular functionaries rather than religious leaders. They were responsible 
for providing the state bureaucrats with statistics
regarding the Jewish communities to which they were attached.

3. "makher" is, I think, too well known a word to require extensive 
comment.

Makher is a big shot, and eyer-kikhl are egg cookies.

Thanks for making a little pisher like me feel like a makher.

Josh Price asks about eyer-kikhl.  It is what I would call a sugar cookie, 
with an egg base. There are many recipes for "egg kichel" (sic) on the 
Internet.  "Eyer" are, of course, eggs.
