Don't know for sure but the word, "rim" means "debris" or "rubbish".
Perhaps, the person is saying, "Oh, is he a piece of garbage!".  Also there
is a verb, "rimen" which means to "boast".  Could it mean, "Oh is he a
braggart!"

Subject: vi zogt men es oyf yidish?

There is an idiom in American English to encourage people in difficult
situations: "Keep your chin up". The British rough equivalent talks about
"keeping a stiff upper lip." In German it is "Halt die Ohren steif",
literally "keep your ears stiff". I know some other equivalents, too.

My question is what is it in Yiddish?

Subject: "kanarik"

I am trying to track down the origin, meaning, and usage of the term
kanarik, often used as a descriptor after a person's name (e.g., Moishe
Kanarik). It seems to me that I've seen it used in a collection of humorous
short stories, but I can't put my hands on the book. Can any Mendelyaners
help?

A groysen dank.

Subject: Auf/oyf

We haven't had a linguistic makhloykes on Mendele for some time now and now
is as good a time as any to renew it. Philologus, who writes a language
column in Forward, has written an interesting article on the preposition
'oyf' and the verbal complement 'oyf-'.

Experience suggests that there's a great deal more to be said on this and
related matters. shemt zikh nisht.

Subject: re: vos heyst 'a mentsh'?

When I was still in grammar school (in The Netherlands, 1966's through
1978), we made a distinction in usage between 'mens' (Dutch) and 'mensj'
(Yiddish, Judeo-Dutch, Amsterdam slang).

The first was a human. Just a human. And sometimes barely human.

The second, as in "wat een mensj!" (voss a mentsh!) was a fine human indeed,
an exemplary human,  in some cases a heroic human.

To describe someone as 'mens' was often disparaging or even downright nasty
(dat mens - that piece of work, that specimen, that utter thing!), to
describe someone as a 'mensj' was to praise them (mens, dat is toch 'n
mensj! - Man, that's some mentsh!).

Our teacher was a 'mensj'.  And to some, he was a " 'n echte mensj, 'n
emmese mensj, 'n toffe mensj" (which did mean, in his case, a really cool
guy). But our nextdoorsikeh was ' 'n mens, 'n echt stuk mens, 'n geval' (a
human, a real piece of human, a case).

The difference seems one of great humanity versus petty humanity.  A
'mentsh' is a prinz unter menshen', mer nisht alle mentshen sein mentshen'.
Only a subset of 'mensheid' is 'mensjkeit'.

To explain 'mentsh' as 'a cool guy', seems so much much more limited than it
really is.
