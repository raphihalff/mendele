Subject: Transliterated dictionaries

I'm quite partial to the relatively obscure "A Yiddish Dictionary in
Transliteration," by Harry Coldoff (Toronto:  Proclaim Publications,
1988).  I'm not sure about its availability; at the time of its
publication the publisher's address was:  Box 130, Station Z (pronounced
"zed"), Toronto, Ontario M5N 2Z3 Canada. It might be available from the
Workmen's Circle Bookstore or the National Yiddish Book Center.

Coldoff's dictionary has the following *mayles*:

(1) The author was a Canadian.

(2) He did his best to observe the principles of YIVO transcription,
about whmong those whom the publisher "acknowledges with thanks" is der
shrayber fun di shures.

Actually, the story behind this dictionary is quite touching. Coldoff was
not a professional linguist; rather, he was a commercial artist who,
though born in London, England, and raised in Toronto, grew up in a
Yiddish-speaking home and attended the Yiddish- language Peretz School in
Toronto when his family immigrated to Canada just before World War I.
(He was born in 1903 and died in 1983.)  The dictionary is bi-directional
-- English-Yiddish and Yiddish-English.  In addition to those two main
sections it also includes special Yiddish lexicons of plants, animals,
weather terminology, family relations, time, numbers, proper names,
curses, death - cemeteries - God, and the Zodiac.  There are separate
chapters for idioms and anecdotes.  The volume is about 230 pages long.

As the jacket copy notes, "...The author normally romanized according to
the Northeastern (popularly called 'Lithuanian') Yiddish pronunciation,
e.g., meyakh un keyakh instead of the standard moyekh un koyekh.  This
slight alteration has presumably not perpetrated undue violence to the
work."  Speaking ex cathedra, and not invoking the doctrine of YIVO
bibliotecal infallibilty, use of YIVO romanization is perfectly
appropriate for the representation of different Yiddish dialects (we've
been around on this one before) -- as long as the author's intention to
base this transcription on a particular dialect is clearly stated (as is
done in the Coldoff dictionary) and as long as the transcription is
applied consistently.  Note my use of the word "transcription," and not
"transliteration" -- even though the work at hand is entitled "A Yiddish
Dictionary in Transliteration."

Anyway, Coldoff passed away before he could see his pet project (which he
began after retirement) through to publication.  His younger sister,
Eleanor Koldofsky (sic), herself a small publisher of books and classical
music recordings (in that connection, she had once Sam the Record Man" --
a name that will be instantly recognizable to Canadian MENDELnikes),
decided to bring out her brother's book, and she worked on it for several
years until finally she published it.  For both Harry Coldoff and Eleanor
Koldofsky it was a true labour of love.

Subject: Oyslernen/kaken

ikh darf lakhn wen ikh ze in ayn mendele-briv azoy kontrastn in der

this is for yankel ekhoyz, concerning oyslernen/auslernen etc.
'auslernen' is not jargon, but quite standard. you're right it means to
finish an apprenticeship, but it is also used idiomatically to mean that
we never finish learning from life (man lernt nie ausalso: me lernt keyn
mol nit oys?

second: kaken

my dictionary says it is related to latin cacare, usage in russian kakat.
yes exists in german too, but it is childs language, like other words
with a duplicated syllable.

a sheynem gruz
kathleen rose noe

p.s. the more you get into yiddish & german, i think you will see how
distinct they are.  similar or even identical usages often entail
semantic divergences. it is sisyphus-arbet to want to constantly parallel
them.

Subject: Musings on Yiddish movies

Last night I watched Mirele Efros and about fifteen minutes of The
Dybbuk. Mirele (Berta Gersten) reminded me so much of the balebatishe
dowagers in my Hanseatic-Peruvian Protestant family.

The type is cross-cultural, I think.

The "habit of command" and the sense that "I am Mirele Efros (somebody
special that you don't mess with), and my word is good (screw up once and
my life will be ruined because it depends on my ability to deliver). Also
the theme of yikhes vs money. Mirele is self-made, and the shiddekh she
makes for her son is with a decadent, poor family clinging to their
yikhes. Each one has a shem, but in a different scale of values. This
trade-off is very common in older societies.

I noticed that comic characters talk in extreme dialects (e.g.
Galitsyaner, central Yiddish), to portray small-mindedness or
incompetence, much like Southern accents are used for "cartoon"
characters in old English language movies. Menashe Skulnik (not in these
two movies) is famous for his extreme Litvak accent, again comic. Very
enjoyable and zeyer interesant!
