This year's Yugntruf Yidish-Vokh was host to four Yiddishists who came all the
way from Tokyo.  One of them, Yankl Halpern, the publisher of a journal, "Der
Yapaner Yid," learned his Yiddish at home whereas the other three had learned
Yiddish in Japan.  Yosef, one of the three, read a paper of his for the first
time at Yidish-Vokh.  Not long ago I noticed it, printed in "Der Yapaner Yid."
Since I thought that it would be of interest to you, I obtained the permission
to submit it to Mendele...enjoy.

Subject: What? No Women?

I don't recognize every name on Meyer Wolf's suggested canon, and since it's
still a work in progress (forever?), I want to put a word in to not
forget/ignore that women wrote in Yiddish, too. There are many, many women on
the "should read" list: Molodowsky, Korn, Serdatsky, Heifetz-Tussman to name
just a few of the few that I am familiar with. I would say that required
reading would be Irena Klepfisz' introduction to "Found Treasures: Stories by
Yiddish Women Writers" to begin to look at why, in 1996, none of the hundreds
of women published in Yiddish would make it on to on early draft of a Yiddish
"Canon."

p.s.  I hope I'm wrong and that some of the names I don't recognise are
women who I've not yet heard of, but should have!

Subject: Yiddish tangos

Zelma Teicher [5.252] asked for the names of the 5 tangos that my group (which
we call the Yiddish Theatre Ensemble) sang:

Yes, "Mayn Yidishe Meydl" is a tango, and that's one of them.  It's by Sholom
Secunda and Anshel Schorr (1927) from the show of the same name. It is
currently in print in "Great Songs of the Yiddish Theater," edited by Norman
H. Warembud, published by J & J Kammen Music Co. (now New York Times
Publishing).  Two other tangos in that book are: "Oygn" by Abraham Ellstein
and Molly Picon (1934) from the show "Eyn Mol In Leb'n" or "Eyne in a
Milyonen," according to two different sources. "Tif Vi Di Nakht" by Abraham
Ellstein (1933) from the show "A Brivele Der Mam'n."

The other two in our medley of five are "Ich Hob Dich Tzufil Lieb" by
Alexander Olshanetzky and Chaim Towber (1934), and "Ven Ich Zol Dich Farliren"
by Max Kletter (1942).  Not in print that I know of, but there are recordings.

Subject: Khasidish or misnagdish

Discussions of _Az der rebe tantst_, _Sha shtil_ and _Der rebe Eylemeylekh_
raise a question completely new to me: "Were they meant to disparage
khasidim?"  I can only guess the answer, but I am reminded of parts of a
version of _Az der rebe tantst_ I heard growing up in Montreal.  In what I
remember, the khasidim did not simply repeat the rebe's actions.  They raised
the ante on the rebe.  The ideas suggest a sophisticated humor, and do sound
disparaging, now that I think back on them.  This is what I remember:

1. Az der rebe zingt, tantsn ale khasidim

2. Az der rebe est, shlingen ale khasidim

3. Az der rebe shloft, khropen ale khasidim

Subject: Der Rebe Elimeylekh

Here is what Chana Mlotek has to say about the song "Der Rebe Elimeylekh"
(from the 4th edition of "Mir trogn a gezang:  favorite Yiddish songs of our
generation" [New York:  Workmen's Circle Education Department, 1987], p. 168):

"A Yiddish version of the English song, Old King Cole.  Poem and music by
Moshe Nadir (1885-1943).  One folklorized version was published anonymously by
S. Bastomski in 1923.  The text and music were published by M. Nadir in 1927,
as well as in the author's book 'A Lomp Oyfn Fenster' in 1929."

Subject: Reliques of the GDYL

In reply to inquiries on project materials of The Great Dictionary of the
Yiddish Language:

As far as I know, the project materials are currently housed in the Butler
Library at Columbia University and perhaps, in part, at YIVO.

Texts on Disk

There is a good deal of modern stuff among the computer-readable texts, but it
is not easily accessible. When the process began, texts were input on punched
cards and for most of the period in which inputting took place, the nature of
the process was such that an error rate of 10% was the rule -- yes, one out of
every 10 letters an error. Unfortunately proofreading of the material was
sporadic, limiting its usefulness. There are better ways of inputting the
material nowadays -- except for those texts whose sources are not legible to
an electronic scanner.

Citation Bibliography

The bibliography which David Goldberg authored and input is everything he says
it is. It was stored in a customized database whose software base is not only
antiquated, but can only run on a machine which is long extinct. The data is
nevertheless recoverable. If the source cardfile still exists, it is
presumably among the materials at Columbia or YIVO.
