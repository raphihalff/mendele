Subject: Two Yiddish stalwarts

There is sad news to report about two stalwart figures of the
Yiddish-speaking world.

Last week, Leyzer Ran, author of the photo album "Yerusholayim de- Lita"
and other books about his native Vilna, died at the age of 83.  His was
the odyssey of a 20th-century Jew:  Born in Vilna, studied in Yiddish
secular schools there, survived World War II in prison in the Soviet
Union (where he went to study in 1936), emigrated to Cuba after the war,
and finally (1953) to New York, wherre he worked at YIVO and then as a
typesetter, until retiring. His entire life was bound up with his
attachment to his native city, and he managed to amass an impressive
personal library and archive on the personalities and institutions that
made Vilna's Jewish community so special.

This past Wednesday, Chaim (Bolek) Ellenbogen died, after a long illness.
He was in his early 80s.  Bolek was not a writer; he was nevertheless
more than just a folksmentsh.  From a working-class family in Warsaw, he
was active since childhood in the Jewish Labor Bund.  He survived the
Holocaust, first by working at the Medem Sanatorium, outside of Warsaw
(which continued to function during the first years of the Nazi
occupation), and then on the "Aryan side," in Warsaw, where he played a
role in the Jewish and Polish undergrounds.  After the war he emigrated
to Sweden and then the United States, where he worked as a floor-layer
and then as the superintendent of the YIVO building at 1048 5th Avenue.
He was a thoughtful and well-read man, an autodidact of a type that is
seldom seen these days.  Bolek's funeral took place on Friday morning.

Subject: O.J. and klal shprakh

Finally, something of value has come out of the OJ media circus.

David Herskovic provided an interesting Associated Press tidbit citing
the misuse by Jewish lawyers in the Simpson case of the word "mishuganer"
to mean the adjective "crazy."  It's gratifying to see in print an
acknowledgement of an issue close to the hearts of many Mendelyaner --
namely, derekh erets for Yiddish, as a language like all others, with
rules and grammar.

Just one small "tayne" with the article.  It says:

   meshuge is the adjective for crazy or mad -- no matter what city
   you're from.

Some of us do pronounce it "meshige."  Might it be my southern accent?

Subject: Chicken Legs

I do not know the origins of it but there is a myth that ghosts or
shaydim have chicken legs. Still today you can hear some gullible tmimim
relating that Hitler was not human but a shin daled, the proof being that
he never took his shoes off which would have shown the state of his feet.
I wonder if it was Eva Braun that passed on this valuable information but
it does seem noteworthy that it only reached some privileged khsidishe
yiden.

Subject: Chicken-footed demons

I don't know how this may be related to other sources in folklore, but
the Gemara (Berakhos 6a) describes demons (mazikin) as swarming invisibly
by the thousands all around us.  If someone wants to see evidence of
them, it is suggested, he should sprinkle sand around his bed and in the
morning, he will see "[markings] like chicken feet."  ("ki kar'ei
d'tarnegola.")

Subject: Zapilierin

Daniel Soyer asks if Zlate di zafilierin/zapilierin could be a person who
made matches (as in shvebelekh). Seems likely. The word we use for
matches is zaplkes, which I believe comes from Polish. (We never say
shvebelekh.)

Subject: Pocket books

"Pocket book" is definitely not an East Coast phenomenon.  My grandmother
came to North American from London at the turn of the century, settling
in Calgary, Alberta, in a sod house of all things.  After she married my
grandfather, the f amily moved to Utah (during WW I).  My mother was born
in Ogden, and moved to Denver after meeting my father and marrying him in
1929.  And all of the women in the family refer to their purses as pocket
books.  Where they got the expres sion is beyond me, but with this
history, it can hardly have been been from NY Yiddish.
