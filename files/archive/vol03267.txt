Subject: Word play

While not quite identical to the cross languages punning of Horowitz
- Nafkowitz variety, a charming Yiddish in joke did occur on the Sid
Ceasar TV show of some decades past. In a parody of a Japonese
Samurai movie Sid Ceasar used as the name of the Samurai: Take
Metsiya. I often wondered what fraction of his audience appreciated
the humor.

A small question for our shamus: In surfing through gopher space I
came across something called the NY-Israel project which purports to
list all all electronic list of Jewish interest, and I must say that
they are really quite broad. However Mendele is not on the list.
Shouldn't it be there, and if so, how is that accomplished?

Subject: Introduction

I am a fan of Yiddish, growing up in Israel  hearing my late
grandmother Nechama Yanich speak to my mom in Yiddish. On occasion
my grandfather contributed my grandmother's folk poetry to the
Forward newspaper in the 1920s and 1930s. Eventually all of my
grandmother's poetry was collected into a privately published volume
entitled "mayn weltl" (my world) which includes 75 poems. One poem
"mayn tefilah" (my prayer) was put to music by Sidor Belarsky.

I have taken the Oxford Yiddish summer course in 1990, and need to
refresh my knowledge of the language. I am also interested in
Judeo-Spanish and Sephardi history and culture, at the present time
I am completing a 70 year history of Jewish life in the Greek
provinces before and after the Holocaust. Finally, I am a
free-thinking rabbi, mindful of tradition, working as Hillel
chaplain at MIT and serving a congregation in Martha's Vineyard.
Last but not least, I do photoethnographic exhibitions, the most
recent on Jewish life in Central Asia (Bukharan Jewish culture), as
well as documentations on Jews in Greece, Turkey, New Zealand and
the American South.

Subject: "Ekldik" and various

Dan Kirschner asks [about "eklet"]:

"Ekldik" is a standard Yiddish word meaning disgusting or stomach
turning, with "ekln" as the associated verb, although Dan's Mom's
form seems a dialectical varient.  My Mom also said that often "s'iz
ekelt mir", referring to any dirt or treyf that might be
present--there was a powerful repugnant affect associated with this
phrase, which I'm sure contributed to my notorious (among my
friends) pickiness about food and vegetarian preferences.  Thought
it amusing when moved to Madison that we have an "Eckel" garbage
removal company here--and the chief of waste recycling for the city
is named (s'iz de emes!) Mr. Dreck.  German-Americans abound out
here, many of whom are not aware of the Yiddish (if not German)
meanings of their names--we really have people here named "Putz",
"Shwantz" etc.

When we "made a shimmelekha", it was definitely a face "two eyes,
one nose, and who stuck their finger in [for the mouth]?", whereupon
we ran like the blazes.  Any children's games folklorists out there?

Subject: Wexler's new book

Those MENDELnikes who were on this list last summer will doubtless
recall the lengthy discussions of Prof. Paul Wexler's theories
regarding the origins of Yiddish.  Now his heralded book, "The
Ashkenazic Jews:  A Slavo-Turkic People in Search of a Jewish
Identity," has finally come out.  It is being published by Slavica
Publishers (P.O. Box 14388, Columbus, OH 43214), and since this is
not intended to be a commercial for the book I will say no more,
other than quote briefly from the blurb that arrived in today's
mail:

"In Wexler's view, the Ashkenazic Jews most likely descend from a
minority ethnic Palestinian Jewish emigre population that inter-
married with a much larger heterogeneous population of converts to
Judaism from Asia Minor, the Balkans and the Germano-Sorb lands...
Widespread conversions to Judaism that began in Asia Minor in the
Christian era and ended with the institutionalization of Christian-
ity among the Western Slavs in the beginning of the second millen-
nium saved the tiny ethnic Palestinian Jewish population in the
diaspora from total extinction.  The major non-Jewish contributors
to the ethnogenesis of the Ashkenazic Jews were Slavs, though there
was probably also a minor Turkic strain -- both in the Caspian-
Black Sea area... and in the Balkans and Hungary.  In all of these
areas, the Turkic population early became submerged with the
coterritorial Slavs.

".... Jewish linguistic evidence refutes the traditional claims that
Yiddish is a variant of High German and that Modern Hebrew is a
'revived' form of Old Hebrew; new hypotheses are proposed:  that
Yiddish began as a Slavic language (specifically a Judaized form of
Sorbian) that was re-lexified to Hebrew, and thus is also a form of
Sorbian.  These facts support the author's hypothesis of the Slavic
origins of the Ashkenazic Jews, and the bulk of their religion and
folk culture."

Wexler's book also attempts to refute the "Khazar thesis" popular-
ized by Arthur Koestler:  "Wexler believes Koestler was right about
the Slavo-Turkic basis for the north European Jews -- but that he
erred in assuming the preponderence [sic] of Turks over other ethnic
groups, and in placing the 'homeland' of the Ashkenazic Jews in the
Caucasus...  Ashkenazic Judaism is essentially a Judaized form of
Slavic pagan and Christian culture and religion (rather than an
uninterrupted evolution of Palestinian Judaism) -- and the best
repository of pagan Slavic folk culture that survives to our days.
Wexler also proposes that the other Jewish diasporas ... are also
largely of non-Jewish origin.  The book compares the notion of
Jewish peoplehood with attempts at rewriting the past found in many
other societies."

At the risk of reigniting the earlier discussion I pass this
information along to readers of MENDELE.  As they say in relexified
Yiddish, Zol der oylem visn.
