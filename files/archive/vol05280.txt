Subject: roykh

The general consensus seems to be that the Yiddish word "roykh" stems from the
German word "rauch". That was also my opinion for a long time .  What gave me
pause however is the common Yiddish expletive "Der roykh zol zey nemen". In
that context the Hebrew meaning makes far more sense and most probably guided
the construction of the phrase (particularly if we note that this is a
pre-holocaust expression.)

Subject: Daytsh in der lite

For Baltic Jews, the high status language was none other than German. (Vilne
and environs was different:  Russian, Polish [depending on era and societal
aspirations].)  Speak to people in their 70s from "Kovner Lite," the more
towards the west, the better, and you're bound to hear things like anvtbroyt,
mager, angenem, arem ('arm') etc. etc. (The a~o alternation isn't regular --
it's lexicalized, but nonetheless a reflection of close contact with German.)
Riga was a German-speaking big city; Memel (Klaipeda) was a German-speaking
province.  A lot of connection between litvishe yidn and German.

Subject: International Yiddish Conference in Miami (in a pitzele nutshell)

Es iz mir a khidush un an antoishung vos ikh ze nisht a vort vegn der driter
internatzyanaler yidisher conference in Miami onfang Mertz.

Its seminars were rich, overflowing with Yidishkayt and insights. The keynote
speech, "Yiddish in the 21st Century" by Aaron Lansky was dynamic,
informative, and ever so hopeful about Yiddish on the rise; it set the
prevailing tone of a lively tomorrow for lovers of Yiddish.

Michael Alpert and Brave Old World, consummate musicians and ethnomusicolo-
gists, added lebedike folkdancing and memorable concerts turning the days into
a festival and celebration of klezmer music and its Ashkenaz culture.

Bernard Mendelovitch's "Development of the Yiddish Theatre" and his night club
performance gave proof of his reputation as London's Yiddish Olivier.

Genardy Estraikh (from Oxford) lectured about the development of Yiddish from
its inception to the 1990's, also ending on a hopeful, aristocratic note for
its tomorrow.  Dovid Katz appeared suddenly, like Eliyohu Hanovi, through the
open door at Saturday dinner, mingling, answering questions, creating future
shibboleths.

Dr. Heszel Klepfisz traced the culture of Ashkenazy Jewry and Dr. Moshe Wolf
discussed the National Jewish Theme in Soviet Yiddish Literature.

Chana and Yosl Mlotek, as always outstanding for their knowledgeability and
sensitivities, filled us with Yiddish song and folksong about women, paint-
ing their socio-economic station, yearnings, degradations, and happiness, from
the cradle to the grave.

Morrie Feller, veteran Mendelyaner, represented us all and told how to reach
out to the Yiddish World through computer networking.

Sprinkled throughout the four days were fun seminars like "Kosher Humor for
Yiddish Clubs" by Meyer Zaremba (a Florida star troubador who also made it
lebedik by leading us in song), and "Yiddish Terms of Love, Sex, and Endear-
ment" by Troim Katz-Handler who has written a book of erotic poetry in mame-
loshn.

Help was extended for leaders of Yiddish Clubs - "Creating Yiddish Theatre" by
Nathan Garnick, and "Programming Techniques and Resources for Yiddish Groups"
with Sunny Landsman, Bea Karg, and Fred Silberstein.

Ruth and Dave Barlas, the Conference Chair, radiated such love and warmth,
they made the four days a true khasene in shtetl. Ruth's idealism, knowledge
and sincerity were contagious and inspirational. A blessing on her head.

A deep joy was the camaraderie, the sharing of ideas, meeting Yiddishistn from
way back in the early days of secularism, and, of course, fleshing out EMail
friends like Fishl Kutner, Morrie and Tibbie Feller, and Bob Freedman.

Resolutions were passed to create lobbying actions and central coordinated
funds for the worldwide creation of teachers and teaching and schools and
clubs and conferences.

I shall treasure the memories, the inspirations, the new friends, and the
hope, the conference created.

Hope to meet you at the one next year,

Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan

Subject: Fried matzo

.. my family has always used the word (and excuse me if I try to spelling is
odd) "Prezj'nyet'seh" for fried matzo.  The problem is I have never heard
anyone outside my family use this word, and as far as I know no one else does
!  I've always thought that if I could learn the etymology of this word I
might learn a little bit more about my family's background.

Subject: Glaykhn

I was interested in Khayem Bochner's discussion of "glaykhen" used in Yiddish
for "to like". The idea of it entering American Yiddish from German is very
persuasive. Howver, the older speakers in my Yiddish group in Glasgow use this
word frequently in this sense. Their Yiddish comes from their parents who, I
think without exception, came to Scotland directly from Russia or Poland. They
would not have been in contact to any extent with German or English. It seems
more likely that they at least adapted the Yiddish glaykhen (which they
already used in its sense of similarity or equality) as a loan translation of
the new English word "to like".

Subject: Zun-shtraaml

Meyer Wolf was good enough to remind me that in the Trancarpathian- Hunharian
area, Eliyohu Juni MAY well be hearing _zyn-shtraaml_; i.e. neither _zun_ nor
_zin_ but something akin to the German umlayted _u_ spelled _ue_, a
front-rounded vowel.

I've heard the joke among Hungarian Jews concerning the distinction between
_fynishe_ and _finishe_ (not to be confused with Finns).

Does this make any sense to you Eliyohu?

Subject: Zun-shtraaml

Eliyohu Juni:

Is it possible that what you rendered as 'zun-shtraaml' was actually
'zyn-shtraaml', i.e. with a front-rounded vowel rather than [u]?

It would be interesting to know whether the purimshpiler who produced the
unexpected vowel are young or old and whether they had American accents.

Subject: A medieval German vernacular

A BBC World Service radio program called "Three Days in Jerusalem" (heard in
Israel on 11 March 1996 at 8:45 Israel time, 6:45 London time) informs hearers
throughout the world that the denizens of Mea Shearim in Jerusalem avoid the
sacrilege of speaking Hebrew and instead speak "a medieval German vernacular."
The program quite properly devotes a large part of its time to the central
concern of most Jerusalemites, namely the rebuilding of the Temple and,
especially, the restoration of animal sacrifice.  The program's authors, with
their genuine empathy for atavism, were apparently delighted to learn that
Yiddish -- contrary to all known natural linguistic laws (this is Jerusalem)
-- froze in the Middle Ages and is authentically spoken, unchanged, in the
ultra-Orthodox precinct of Mea Shearim at this very moment.
