Subject: Skotsl komt

I would like to add some bibliographic information that
can help to the debate about the Yiddish expression
Skotsl komt: Prof. Dov Sadan wrote an article about it:
"Skotsl komt : tsu der biyografiye fun a bagris-forml"
published in _Zamlbukh_ / aroysgegebn fun Farayin fun
di shtriker fabrikantn tsum 25 yorikn aniversar fun der
institut'tsye (Redaktor: Gershon Sapozshnikov) [Buenos
Aires, 1961] pages 141-150.

Subject: RE: Vol 1.46 on shikse & "Jew"

On shikse
  
The negative implication comes - at least that is the
way I got it from home -from the fact that you can go
out with her have fun, sex, (many things you would
never do with a jewish girl who is a potential candi-
date to be the mother of your children) -  whatever,
but you would never marry her because - she is (only) a
shikse - my mother who was as non racist as you can
possible be would say when one of my early relations at
the age of 17 broke up  " forget her, she is only ..."
even though she had really liked her.  
On "Jewish"

The question whether you tell people that you are
jewish in Europe vs in the U.S. is a far more interest-
ing topic. I recall a very intense conversation with a
jewish girl at midnight on a stroll at the Pacific
Shore in Long Beach some years ago on the fact that
telling people that you are jewish means something
completely different on the different sides of the
Atlantic. Not that there is no antisemitism in the US -
I understand that quite well, but there seems not to be
this "it is unnecessary to tell people ... life is hard
enough anyway" that you are told by your parents. And
there are uncounted stories of kids finding out that
they are jewish by remarks from other kids who have
been told by their more-or-less antisemitic parents.
 
It is even more difficult: telling people that you are
jewish can really embarass them - you get reactions
from "oh.." to blushing to "some of my best friends are
Jews.." to complete helplessness and remarks like "my
father was in the SS..."
 
You may ask "is (s)he black / homosexual / catholic / a
sex maniac but if you ask if (s)he is jewish then you
are probably a Nazi. ...  Peter Sichrovsky did 2
books - one with interviews of young Jews in Austria
and Germany - how they feel, why they stay .. and one
with interviews with children of members of the SS, SA
etc.  I think they have been translated into English.  

A story:

I worked in a gov't office in Austria and one day in
1988 I found a WYWO msg by the personnel mgr. - he has
to speak to me immideately - I tried to call him but he
was already on the line again and he told me that if I
want to I can have Sept 11, off - I don't have to fill
out a request for a personal day off or tell anybody -
it is OK if I just do not show up in the office - I
asked OK but what? why? - so he told me that he has
received a document by his boss and he is informing
me - he would not tell me why me and he would not tell
me what this is all about and only because we know each
other for some time and are on a first name basis he
would tell me finally that so-and-so had suggested to
call and inform me and that this is the first time and
because of the 50th "aniversary" (he did NOT call it
that way but a member of parliament called it at this
time) of the Reichskristallnacht, that they passed a
regulation that you may have Yom Kippur off as an extra
day. This memo explicitly stated absolutely NOT to
poste it on info boards but to inform relevant people
personally and confidentially!! It is OK to post infos
relating to people with diabetes, of protestant reli-
gion, even muslim or relating to special regulations
for pregnant women, but the note would have had to
include the word "Jew" or "Israelite" or something and
this is an absolute NO-NO. You can write and talk about
Israelis and Palestina as much as you want ...  
This poor guy was so embarassed that he had to call me
up and tell me this ...(because it basically ment
"although you did not tell the office, we have found
out that you are jewish and have acted acordingly -
today you get a day off, but tomorrow ..)
 
There is another aspect that somebody might walk up and
say "here we are again, we always knew it - the Jews
and their privileges..."

Regarding the use of "yente" for males, do you mean as
a given name or in a figurative sense? If as a name,
can you dredge up a source for this bit of gossip? In a
figurative source, of course, it's applied to males
even today.  MH
