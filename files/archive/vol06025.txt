As Zellig Bach very correctly noted [6.022], it is often difficult to
set apart the proyst-oyf-yiddish proverbs and those belonging to the
European tradition. Let's consider the following German/Yiddish proverb
couples:

Mit alten Sachen kann man nicht viel machen / Mit altn zakhn kan me nit fil
makhn
Eine gute Luege ist auch Geld wert / A guter lign iz oykh geld wert
Diener sind treu bis sie sind neu / Diner zenen troy bis zi zenen noy
Auf fremder Erde baut man nicht / Oyf fremder erd boyt me nit

Despite this, there are shibboleths (!) which enable us to recognize true
Yiddish proverbs, e.g.:

Esroygim nokh Sukes (= locking the stable-door after the horse is stolen)
Ganz yor shiker, Purim nikhter
A meshumed in a mishpokhe kumt amol oykh tsu nuts
Eyn azesponem kumt gleykh in Ganeden arayn

Az a meydl kumt tsu dem rebe, iz dos meydl a meydl un der rebe a rebe.
   Az der rebe geyt tsu a meydl, iz dos meydl ka meydl un der rebe ka rebe.

Paolo Agostini

Subject: The anti-Yiddish campaign in Israel

I'm only 20 years old, but I have some words to say about importance of
Yiddish.

I came from Ukraine when I was 14 years old and I remember pretty well the
role, Yiddish played in our life.

I even don't know Yiddish, just some statements, but I understand that
in Hebrew or Russian I can't sometimes express myself exactly. Even in
Israeli parlament, Knesset, when almost nobody took part in discussion
the man who rules the Knesset said in Yiddish : " Shoin , nishtu mit vym
tzu redn" (Sorry for mistakes)

That is what he felt.

Besides, it very important to keep in touch with diaspora. In Jewish
comunities in Eastern Europe people don't know Hebrew, and despite of
hebrew school there they will never feel hebrew like Yiddish.

Subject: Juedische Volkshochschule Berlin and Yiddish

A short visit to Berlin last month for archival research led me to take
notice of the educational program of the Juedische Volkshochschule which
is sponsored through the Juedische Gemeinde zu Berlin.  The program from
22 April-20 June included 14 presentations of which but one was in
Yiddish, that of Gennady Estraikh (now at Oxford) on the young Jewish
writers in the last years of the USSR.  There were 17 language courses
teaching Hebrew (including two in Russian), a history of the Jewish
people course in Russian, five intensive courses teaching German for
immigrants and two courses teaching Yiddish.

One presentation was a reading by Lore Segal (American, born in Vienna)
from her novel _Ihr erster Amerikaner._  The brochure included an
excerpt which caught my interest and I reproduce a small part where the
book's heroine, Ilka Weissnix (!), after being met at Idlewild Airport
(today's JFK) by her American host, Fishgoppel, is in the subway:

    ..."Ich muss nemen ein Examen.  Ich muss gein back to school",
     versuchte Fishgoppel das Droehnen der Untergrundbahn, die sie
     uptown brachte, zu uebertoenen. "Ihr will stay in mein Apartment
     in New York, okay?"
    "Pardon?" bruellte Ilka zurueck.
    "My horrible Yiddish!" rief Fischgoppel und schlug sich an die Stirn.
    "Jiddisch!" schrie Ilka, entzueckt, auf ein Wort gestossen zu sein,
     das sie verstand. "Bei uns in Wien sprach ausser die _Polischen_
     niemand Jiddisch!" ...

I caught notice of these programs originally via a poster on a kiosk in
former East Berlin at the City Library (next to one city archive).  What
originally attracted my attention was their "Jewish Film Festival" that
was devoted to Humour in Jewish Films.  15 showings featured 17 films
(including separate showings of Mel Brook's "The Producers" in a German
dubbing in addition to the original American).   Most of the films were
quite recent films by Jewish directors about Jewish themes (though there
were both Lubitsch's original "To Be or Not to Be" and the Mel Brooks
remake and Michael Roemer's "The Plot against Harry).  Yiddish-language
films were represented by the US 1937 short "I Want to be a Border" and
the 1937 Polish "Freyleche Armen."  There were three silent films: the
1925 Alexey Granowksi "Juedische Glueck" and two early films by Ernst
Lubitsch "Schuhpalast Pinkus" (1916) and "Meyer aus Berlin" (1919).

I was not familiar with Granowski or the 1916 Lubitsch film -- which is
not listed with the "complete" filmography of Lubitsch in Robinson's
_The History of World Cinema_  (New York, 1973).  The Lubitsch films by
title "sound" like they are Yiddish-inspired.  Does anyone know about
these and the Granowski film?  Are they available in the US. More
generally, are there many "silent" Yiddish films?
