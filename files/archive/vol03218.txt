Subject: Schindler's List

A response to the use of "Ofn Pripetshik" in the film.  I actually
felt that the song was quite appropriate.  Because the subject of
the song is about the trials and tribulations of galut, and how they
are evoked by the Yiddish language, the song seems perfectly
appropriate for a film about the Holocaust.  The song has always
indicated to me the importance of lanjguage in understanding the
history of the Jews, and seems a fitting metaphor for a story about
the destruction of a vast portion of that language.

In terms of "Yerushalayim shel zahav," I also had some problems with
it, but understand Spielberg's choice.  I think it served as a
linking device for the last scene of the film, which takes place in
Israel, and implies that many of the Jews on Schindler's list
eventually settled there.  Of course, the political overtones cannot
be missed, and I think Spielberg very much chose to make clear to a
broad American public the reason for and importance of the
establishment of the state of Israel.  Considering the projected
audience for the film, it seems a fair move.

Subject: Origins of Ashkenazic Jewry

	Ellen Prince alluded to my musings on the origins of eastern
European Jewry, and I would like at the least to inform Mendeleniks
where they can find out more about those ideas, even if I am not
temperamentally suited to lay out my hypotheses in elaborate detail
here.

	Alice Faber and I first published on this in 1984:  "Yiddish
and the Settlement History of Ashkenazic Jewry," The Mankind
Quarterly 24:393-425.  The most definitive account of our ideas was
published by me in 1992 as "Migration and Linguistics as Illustrated
by Yiddish," in Edgar C. Polome and Werner Winter (eds.),
Reconstructing Languages and Cultures (Berlin--New York:  Mouton de
Gruyter), pp. 419-439.

	The main points of this hypothesis are, I suppose, these.

	1) The importance of the Rhineland (Loter) as a
*demographic* basis for Ashkenazic Jewry has been exaggerated in the
"received" version of Jewish settlement history of eastern Europe.

	2) I place the locus of settlement farther east, along the
Danube, in the *linguistic* area called Bavarian (which in medieval
times covered not only present-day Bavaria but Austria and large
parts of the Austro-Hungarian Empire).

	3) There was a larger Jewish population living in the east
(e.g. in Poland) prior to the outbreak of the Crusades (c. 1100
C.E.) than one reads about in the standard accounts.  They came most
likely from the south and the southeast after the destruction of the
Second Temple.

	4) The Khazars likely did contribute something to the
Asheknazic gene pool, as did rape and intermarriage.  The Koestler
(nee Pollak) theory grossly inflates their importance as the
demographic foundation of Ashkenazic Jewry.

	5) The evidence for this theory is primarily linguistic,
though also epigraphic and archeological.

	One final note.  In view of how little things often become
*very* BIG things on the Mendele network, I feel like I should have
my head examined for even trying to lay out my theories for the
benefit of our readers.  I'm not going to respond to all the
objections that can and will be made to my "Danube--Bavaria" theory.
I've heard most of them by now, and some of these objections may
well be right.  I say just read what I've written about it and what
Alice Faber and I wrote about it and draw your own conclusions.

Bob King
