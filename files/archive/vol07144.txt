Subject: Bozyk biography

It's always delightful to read that someone will breathe life into another of
our great Yiddish artists. Max Bozyk is most worthy of a well-researched
biography. His wife and artisitic partner, Reyzl, commanded as much esteem. (I
think her last role was as the beguiling, match-making bubbie in "Crossing
Delancey".) 

The Hebrew Actor's Union at 31 7th Street, New York 212-674-1923 might be the
best source for information. Our two still-spectacular, Grande Dames of the
theatre, Mina Bern and Shifra Lehrer, still performing, are co-vice
presidents, who knew tthe Bozyks well. I remember they had a daughter and
eyniklekh. 

Good luck,

Subject: Napoleon in Yiddish folklore

I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who knows of any Yiddish or Jewish folklore
- stories, legends, sayings, maxims, songs - concerning Napoleon.  Any
snippets, recollections, or references to collected sources, would be welcome. 
Please feel free to email me directly.  Thanks.

Subject: Yiddish newspapers and journals 

I have some funding to purchase Yiddish newspapers and journals for a
community library.  Thewy may be either written in Yiddish, or written in
English with a Yiddish cultural theme.  Can anyone suggest titles (and if
possible, contact sources) to me? Thank you -

Subject: tcholent

I find the explanation by Salcia Landmann most convincing (it is also
mentioned by Hardy Meyer). She derives it from chauld (old French for hot),
combinded with lent (French, slow), it means slow heat. Since no fire can be
started on the Sabbath, meals had to be cold or had to be prepared over a slow
fire started the day before. A similar idea is suggested by the Aramaic term
chamin (cham = warm).

Subject: cholnt

I am afraid I have to weigh in again on the issue of amateur vs.  professional
Yd linguistics.  Hardy Meyer's etymology of cholnt as being from "Rhineland
French"  "chaud lent" (slow heat) contains several points that are at least
troublesome.  First, what pray tell is "Rhineland French"?  Second, does
French really have the expression "chaud lent" or is this just a literal
translation from the English? (I dont know quite enought French to be sure,
but the expression I know is "four doux" (lit. soft oven), so I have to
suspect that "chaud lent" is not really French.  Third, clearly it is not
modern French that we need but early medieval French, and we need to be told
what the forms were at that time.  Fourth, the standard works of Yiddish hist.
ling., those of Max Weinreich, propose that the derivation is from a Romance
source but not quite the one mentioned, and so for the nth time I must protest
against amateurish anecdotes being posted w/o any attempt to find out what the
scholarly literature has to say on the subject.  It would be too much to
expect nonspecialists to know the literature, of course, but it is not too
much I submit to insist that if they dont then they can ask--rather than
promulgating all kinds of fantasies.

Subject: The possible origin of "cholent"

I was taught in high school that the origin of tshulnt is in the French
"chaut" (hot), but pronounced not as it is pronounced now (sho), but in
medieval pronunciation was probably close to the way it is written.  I was
told that the word first appears in Rashi, transliterated (something like teis
shin vov lamed nun).  I never checked it up.

Subject: tsholnt

I hate to throw cold water on a Mendele discussion, but the origin of
"tsholnt" is explained in Max Weinreich's Geshikhte/History (vol. II, 55-57 in
the Yiddish, pp. 400-404 in the English). The etymon is the Latin present
participle "calentem" 'that which is warm', via Old French.  Case closed.
