Subject: Mein Veib's Fis

Ron Robboy writes:

"The Litvish speaker would characteristically pronounce the sounds /s/ and 
/sh/ in the same way, as /s/.  Thus the word _fish_ (fish) would be pronounced
/fis/, becoming a homonym with  _fis_ (feet)."

While a patient in a Jerusalem hospital, my next bed neighbor, a Litvishe
speaker, said to me, "Ich hab lib mein veib's fis."  I was initially confused,
thinking he meant that he was a foot fetishist.  Only after some thought did I
realize he meant he loved his wife's fish.

A sisse, gesunte yahr.

Subject: davening

The American Jewish History listserv   had a request for the origin of the
word "davening."  There were many interesting responses and I would like to
hear what our esteemed Mendele sages have to offer on this word.  A gut
gebensht yor to all.

Subject: Song Lyrics

I have listened closely many times, but can't catch all the words to a song
that appears on the Yazoo Records CD: Dave Tarras, Yiddish-American Klezmer
Music 1925-1956, track #13. 

It is listed as: A Vaibele A Tsnien, The Bagelman Sisters with Abe Ellstein
Orchestra (1942). 

The Bagelman Sisters were aka The Barry Sisters, if that helps. Thank you all
in advance. Its great to know you are out there.

Subject: Yiddish Anarchism

Dear Mendele,

a very belated reply (sorry!) to Gertrude Dubrovsky's message about the 
Stelton colony: Paul Avrich's 'Anarchist Voices' has a large section on
this (I've been told).

On the subject of Left-wing song, which seem to have broken out of late,
readers might be interested to know that recordings of a couple of David
Edelstadt's songs are still circulating around the Anarchist movement
here.

Subject: chemical glossary

Steve Cohen asks about where he can publish his chemical glossary [7.059]. 
Although he has already spoken to Dr. Schaechter, perhaps he should return
to him and ask whether the League for Yiddish, which he heads, would publish
it.  They have published a number of glossaries authored by Schaekhter
himself, including a botanical lexicon.

Subject: galerete

Regarding David Herskovic's posting regarding "galerete' or "gale" [7.070]:
In my house, it was called "galer",  and none of the children would eat it.
Imagine green garlic jell-o...  It is interesting to hear  about  the
connection of this dish with the  Gerer Khsidim.  My Mom comes from 
Czestochowa and  two of her uncles were indeed, Gerer Kh'sidim.  Her father,
who supported his two brothers ,  was a follower of the Zuryker Rebbe.   Would
any Mendelyaners happen to  have any information about the Rebbe?

Subject: languages and dialects

As long as we're on the topic of languages and dialects, I thought I'd put
in my two bits. 

The difference between a language and a dialect is not well-defined, nor
well-definable. The obvious test of mutual comprehensibility, has many wierd
counterexamples: swiss understand High German, but not vice versa,
Afrikaans-speakers understand Dutch, but not vice-versa: so are they
different or not? Peter Slomanson also alluded to class considerations that
one doesn't associate with language: Consider an uneducated speaker of
cockney english and an uneducated Mississippian with a strong southern
accent.  Probably they would have great difficulty understanding eachother,
yet if both of them went to University and learned their respective standard
pronunciantions, they would understand eachother easily.  Who is learning
whose language/dialect? 

What IS important are written languages. Written languages are always a
little bit artificial, because everyone's common speech is subtly different
from the 'correct' form of their speech... I notice that in my own (native
speaker) english I omit the helping verb in an informal request: "want a
banana?" instead of "do you want a banana?" But written standards differ
from eachother in definable ways. But then this issue of dialects does not
arise. If you write a letter in written Serb anyone can see immediately that
it's not written Croat. Even if the words would have been the same in the
latin alphabet, there's still no confusing one linguistic standard with the
other. 

The key to this language/dialect issue is that languages are more
prestigious, and are associated with nation-hood.  I am a history student,
and my topic is comparative Slavic nationalism, and let me tell you: every
group that wants to call itself a nation, claim independance etc. etc.
routinely claims that their local speech is different from the standard
language used by the group they're rebelling from. And people who are
against that group, they respond by saying, no, no, you just speak a dialect
of whatever, it isn't another language at all. It reaches absurd lengths:
I've had Slovaks tell me that Slovak is totally different from Czech, that
Czechs and Slovaks can't understand eachother, and we have this conversation
despite my never having studied Slovak, with me speaking my (at the time not
very good)  Czech. The Bosnians are in an even more unenviable position:
Serb and Croat don't always get the respect they crave as different
languages, even though they have different scripts, so you gotta pity the
Bosnian (Muslim) nationalist who has to try and convince the outside world
that Bosnian is a distinct language from either. (They use the latin
alphabet like the croats, and have been introducing arabic and turkish words
to try and differentiate themselves.) 

If anyone says that scripts and consciously introduced words is not a
function of linguistics but of politics,  I respond Yes, that're precisely
my point. Linguistics is interesting and a great pleasure, but you shouldn't
try to use it to justify political points. Manaster Ramer's observation that
Weinreich was "at least part of the time" a linguist is absolutely correct,
but he wasn't being a linguist when he claimed that mideaval Yiddish was a
language not a dialect, he was propagating his conception of Yiddish
nationalism based on a language. All the linguistic-based nationalisms I've
examined, and there have been several, project the distinct national sense
as far back into the past as is even remotely plausable. (The Slavic
Macedonians have the nerve to claim that Alexander the Great was one of
them: not merely the claim that Alexander was not Greek, which assertion can
actually be made vaguely tenable, but he was the direct ancestor to the
Slavs who migrated in the sixth century!) 

Yiddish national identity is of course extremely contested: there's a great
quote where Stalin (of Birobozhidan fame, unless I have my dates wrong) says
that the Jews aren't a nation, because they haven't got a national territory
to inhabit. Strange what people will look for as necessary components of
'nation'-hood. Weinreich was covering his bets in an extremely conventional
way. These status games are still important today: the current criteria for
getting a group established as an official minority in Austria include the
possession of a distinct language. I learned this from an Austrain Roma
politician. The status of the Roma 'dialects' as a 'language' means the
difference between official recognition and subsequent financial support by
the austrian government. This is about politics, not linguistics. 

It is also worth pointing out that politics can change written and even
spoken languages: words and even grammatical constructions are adopted for
political reasons. German "Augenblick" comes from an anti-foreigner wave
back at the time of the 30-years' war: before that time the Germans said
"Moment" like everyone else. (They also wanted to introduce 'Gesichtshorn'
for nose, but that failed to fly.) American 'hot dog' is from the first
world war: Wiener was clearly undesirable; stinking austrian dogs, etc etc.

Anyway, Linguists as such aren't interested in this status debate over
languages and dialects. If you tell a linguist that Yiddish has a strong
'verb-goes-in-the-second-place" word order rule, just like German, the
similarity is interesting to him. If you tell him that Yiddish reflexives
don't decline by subject, but German ones do, that's interesting too. But if
you use such factoids to argue that Yiddish obviously therefore is a dialect
of German/is it's own language distinct from German, the pure lingust shrugs
his shoulders, whatever you say, buddy. 

I hope that my fellow mendele khaverim are neither too put out by my slavic
examples nor bored by my ranting, but I  _am_ after all writing my theis on
these very issues and simply could no longer sit idly by!

Zeyt gezunt!
