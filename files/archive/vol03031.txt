Subject: more idioms

I had no opportunity to read my e-mail for three or four days and
found that my delay saved me a lot of effort; a lot of the comments
I would have felt impelled to make were very satisfactorily supplied
by others.  So for now, only some additions to the idiom collection:

1. "kum ikh nit haynt, kum ikh morgn", applied to some- one who is
excessively casual about punctuality, carrying out of
responsibilities, etc.

2. "fort un filt nit", said when someone belatedly "catches on" to a
situation (often his own) which others have long since been aware
of, or about someone who is generally "spacey".

3. "es hot mir gekost a shtik gezunt", applied to an experience
which required great and unpleasant effort, or anguished decision;
something the subject found very difficult.

4. "gezunt zolstu zayn", anticipatory mitigation of a mild
criticism, as in "Khashke, gezunt zolste zayn, vu hoste shoyn vider
ahingeton di tsaytung?"

1) Wrt translation: I've got several prospects to pass on to the
   customer. Hurray for networking! And thanks for the assurances
   that I haven't been overcharging :-)

2) Wrt "frozen datives": Khaver Pinson is mistaken about "toytn"
   being frozen. I suspect he was confusing the adjective toyt with
   the noun toyt.

By "frozen" I assume he means (as I would) a fixed, more or less
idiomatic, expression that doesn't necessarily follow the
contemporary grammatical rules.  For a real "frozen dative",
consider "in der luftn". "Luftn" looks like a plural, but the sense
isn't plural, and besides, if it were plural, it should be "di", not
"der". The reason for the "n" is that, in an earlier stage of the
language, (some) common nouns used to take case endings, just as
"tate" still does (cf. "mitn tatn"). This fixed expression just
hasn't kept up with the changes in the grammar.

My favorite example is "in der emesn". Not only does "emes" no
longer take case endings, but in modern Yiddish it has become
masculine, instead of feminine. So modern grammar calls for "in dem
emes" (or "inem emes" ...).  But we can still say "in der emesn".

3) Wrt "nekhtiker tog", Arnold Kuzmack suggests that the literal
meaning is "a day that's like night" r.t. "yesterday's day". I share
the suspicion that this may have been the original sense. But he's
wrong is saying that "it is grammatically preferable". First, -ik
very often fails to trigger "umlaut": lustik, hantik, farayorik.
Besides, the set of vowel changes known as "umlaut" does not
normally affect "e". I can't think of an example with -ik right now,
but consider diminutives like "betl", "ekl".  "rekht/rikhtik", if
they really form a pair, are just irregular.  So we wouldn't
actually expect the adjective from "nekhtn" to be "nikhtik".
(Although "nekhtndik" seems like a possibility ...)

Personally, I think of "nekhtiker tog" as similar to "farayoriker
shney": things that are impossible simply because they can never
come again.  In any case, the reason people give "yesterday's day"
as the literal meaning is presumably that, outside this expression,
"nekhtik" really does mean "pertaining to yesterday".

"Ikh bin nisht keyn nekhtiker" - 'I wasn't born yesterday'

Tayere Mendelniks:

Mein vayb hot mir geboten tzu shraybn etlekhe verter:

My name is Rachel(Rookhele).  I am a tutor in Psychology at the
Victorian University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia.  I asked
Michael to join Mendele because he has e-mail access.  My love for
Yiddish dates back to when I was knee high to a grass hopper.  My
Dad always spoke it in the home. As an adult, I decided to learn it
formally so that not only would I be able to understand, but also
able to read and write as well.  My first teacher told me I spoke
with a Warsaw accent.  I thought this was interesting considering
I was born and bred in Melbourne!

I'm still learning Yiddish, but have now progressed to reading
literary works like those of Sholem Asch.  My oldest son goes to the
Sholem Aleichem kinder- garten.  All I can say is it sounds so sweet
to hear Yiddish being spoken out of the mouth of a 4 year old child.
My younger son who is 10 months old, babbles in Yiddish as well as
English.  A future Yiddishist in the making!

Ikh vill oych epes zogn:

I am Senior Lecturer in Social & Preventive Medicine at Monash
University. Although my zayde and buba came from Russia, I didn't
learn Yiddish as a child. I learnt German at school, which has given
me an accent which Rachel's family find disagreeable.  I read
Weinreich's College Yiddish before we went to Israel a few years
ago.  After a few weeks staying with Rachel's aunt and uncle, I had
acquired a passable conversational Yiddish.  But I don't aspire to
her literary heights.  I enjoy reading your bulletin board, even if
the frequent messages tend to drown those related to my own work.

Zayt gezunt,
		Michael Abramson.

Subject: salmon = laks?

Arn's discussion in another context reminds me of a question I've
had for a while:

> E.g., Ikh es laks "I eat smoked salmon."

The only word in Weinreich and Harduf for "salmon" is "laks". We eat
canned salmon fairly often (mix it with mayonnaise and put it into a
sandwich, typically).  What should I tell the kids to take out of
the cupboard?  "Laks" carries connotations of smokedness.  Is there
a different term for unsmoked salmon?
