Subject: What song is this?

Ikh zukh di verter un informatsya vegn a lid, oder efsher tsvay lider
vos mayne eltern un andere lodzer hubn gezingen mit groys frayd.

"er hot gemaynt zayn lebn makhn beser,
hot men im arayngedrikt a zagranitshne meser."

zagranitshne oder a za granitshne, ich farshay in gantsn nisht dos
vort (di verter.)

andere verter vos kenen efsher zayn fun dos zelbiga lid:

"er iz gevaldig tsufridn vos di mame hot im gehat." (tsvay mol)

ikh ken gut zingen di por verter, un oib emitser vet mir gebn vos
faylt oys vel ikh far aykh gern zingen dos lid oyf ayere simkhes. uber
gedenk, ir vayst mayn shtime nisht.

ikh vil oykh fregn tsu emitser vayst fun shraybungen vegn di yidishe
khorn fun arbeter ring un di frayhayt khorn. antshudikt mir oyb di
temes zenen shoyn diskusirt gevorn in mendele.

There is a song that I'd like to have identified. It was sung with
great glee by my forebears.

er hot gemaynt zayn lebn makhn beser
hut men im arayngedrikt a zagranitshne meser.

I undoubtedly have the penultimate word wrong and I haven't the
faintest idea what it means. Also, and possibly from the same song:

er iz gevaldig tsufridn vos di mame hot im gehat (repeated)

I know the melody fragments that go with these words. If I can get the
rest of the lyrics I'll gladly perform this (these) at simkhes on
request; but be careful what you ask for--

And while I am on the topic of music, does anyone know of any accounts
or collections of the Workmen's Circle and Freiheit choruses? If any
of this has been covered in earlier issues, please forgive the
repetition.

Subject: Help needed with Yiddish letters

My name is Teresa A. Pollin, I am an archivist in the Photo Archives
in the US Holocaust Museum in Washington DC.  I would like to enlist
your help in a project that I am currently working on. I am looking
for a volunteer to read and write English summaries of approximately
50 handwritten letters.  The story is as follows:

A young girl, 15 years old, left Warsaw for the US in 1936.  She
joined her maternal aunt in Chicago, while her parents and siblings
stayed behind. The family corresponded extensively in Yiddish until
October 1940.  The German decree did not allow any correspondence in
Yiddish, so the family started to write postcards in Polish or Yiddish
written in Latin letters.  The young girl sent food packages to the
family in the Warsaw ghetto. The content of the postcards is
heartbreaking - begging for help, continuously asking for more food
packages, describing living conditions in a synagogue.  The
correspondence ended abruptly in December 1941, after Germany declared
war on America on December 11, 1941. The young girl, today a woman, is
still guilt-ridden about her inability to rescue her family.  All
perished in Treblinka. She forgot her Yiddish and her Polish, her
children are very eager to understand the family dynamics and through
that their mother. I translated the Polish material for them, but my
Yiddish is not good enough (according to my sister it is non-existent).

If you are willing to help, please contact me either by e-mail:
tpollin@ushmm.org or by phone: 202 - 488-6128 (please feel free to
call collect).  Thank you very much for including this posting on your
list.

Subject: Yiddish study programs

I am trying to get information about summer Yiddish study programs
offered at Hebrew University and the University of Tel Aviv.  I wonder
if any mendele subscribers have e-mail addresses for people involved
with either of these programs.  I would appreciate it if somebody has
this information if he/she could please send it to me.

Thanks very much.
