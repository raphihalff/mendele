Subject: "[The Chasidim] have no need or purpose for secular literature"?

The exchange by Abraham Brumberg and Abraham Joshua Heschel, while
inaccurate on both sides, reveals something about today's religious Yiddish
literature and the uses to which it is put. 

Brumberg states that the Haredim "have nothing to do with anything that
smacks of secular Yiddish". This is false, of course, which is precisely why
the situation is so interesting: Haredim are making use of secular literary
forms ("scores of novels for young adults", "Yiddish [news]papers"), while
denying their possibly Yiddishist, definitely non-Haredi provenance: "[we]
have no need or purpose for secular literature"! 

On the other hand, Haredi and secular Yiddish literature do differ. Not in
quality -- I would venture to say that dross dominates among the veltlekhe
just as much as among the Haredi (perhaps less so in poetry)  -- but in
philosophy: the aesthetic of "art for its own sake" is (as far as I'm aware)
not prevalent among Haredi writers. Whether this will change can be debated,
but it does lead to a difference in emphasis: the Haredim do not approach
literature the same way as the veltlekhe (they use it but are ambivalent),
and Brumberg and Heschel faithfully reflect this difference.

Subject: replies to Fuchsman and Heschel

Mr. Fuchsman has a point about the number of schools: when they started,
they had the full help, financial and otherwise, forom the state (that is,
the republican governments), whioch is something the yiddish schools in
Poland did not have.  Yet after this immense efflorescence came the almost
sudden and immense decline.  Why?  There were a numnber of reasons for it,
not least the fact that gradually the parents began to realize that the
future for their children lies not in the Yiddish schools, but in the
Belorussian, Ukrainian and--primarily--Russian.  In addition, Yiddish
schools were being gradually denuded of Jewish content--something I observed
in myh first piece. And then came gradually the attacks on Yiddish writerrs,
the moratorium on any contacts with the Wesxt (not to speak of Palestine),
arrests, and Stalinist antisemitism pure and simple. 

Mr. Fuchsman is shocked by the word "castrated."  Yet that's exactly what
happened--not overnight, and not without at first good intentions on the
part of the authorities, central and Jewish, but step by step, finally
culminatring inh arrests, executions, and phony truck accidents (Mikhoels). 
 Mr. Fuchsman is obviously au courant on these matters.  But he is wrong in
thinking that the contrast betweern the 20s and 30's cum 40s was all that
drastic.  The seeds of much of what happened in the 30s were already
sprouting in the 20s.  To be sure, some poets continued to publish even
after they had been vulgarly attacked by the Litrvakovs et al.  But others
were forced, already in the 20s, to engage in mea culpas and rewriting
their works.    That, my dear Mr. Fuchsman, is where the tragedy lay, and
not in  "the greatness and promise of the 20s."

Regarding Zhitlovsky, I did say that he was close to the Bund, certainly in
the early part of trhis century, so I don't see any reason to belabor the
issue.

As for my second critic, I submit my reply sent to him earlier :

Dear Mr. Heschel, The information regarding gthe commopn Haredi attitude
towards Yiddish as having no proper grammar or structure I take from Miriam
Isaac's essay in THE POLITICS OF YIDDISH.  As you may know, she has written
a lot on this subject and is in no sense an enemy of the haredim.  Neither,
of course, am I, but if you have no use for Mendele , Sholem Aleichem et al,
why do you expect the secularists to have much use for your literary output,
impressive though it no doubt is, and how do you expect a fruitful
collaboration between these two trends in the future?  Seems a bit adonyne
to me.  Yes, one of these days I shall be happy to accept your invitaiton
and come down to Brooklyn, and I will also attemptr to get hold of some of
your novels (they are, I am afraid, not available here in Washington...) 
But do bear in mind trhat I am no "Yiddishist" in the sense in which it had
been understood in the early part of this century. 

I think yours is indeed a very real culture, but quite divorced, as you
yourself illustrate, from the traditions of secular culture which had the
advantage of keeping the secular Jews close to kol yisroel and to the
outside world at one and the same time., Indeed, it is likely that you will
continue to develop, while secular culture, despite all the courses,
conferences, festivals and klezmer concerts will decline.  This is not a 
prospect that makes me very happy.  

Very sincerely, 
A. Brumberg

Subject: Yiddish and Hebrew

Abraham Brumberg hot farentfert zeyn kritiker mit koyakh - kol kavod!
Some of the details in his response prompted me to check my books - I
collect travel accounts and descriptions of Eretz Yisroel pre-1925/30.
Among many books of this type (mostly in English - a limitation of my
own making), I have about 9 or 10 in Yiddish, most published between 1910
and the early 1920's and almost all published in New York.  There are two
that shed some interesting light on Brumberg's remarks.  The first one:

   Rakhel Katznelson-Rubashov (ed.)  Vos arbetorins dertzeylen: a
   eretz-yisroel bukh.  Tel-Aviv, 1931.  (iii, 371 p. illus.)

This book about the experiences of Jewish women workers in Palestine is
made up of pieces from about 70 individual contributors, and they seem all
to have been written originally in Yiddish.  There are no credits for any
translators that I can see.  Although printed in Israel and has a Tel-Aviv
imprint, it was published by the Pioneer Women's Organization of New York.

The second one is even more interesting, in my opinion:

   David Ben-Guryon, un Y. Ben-Tzvi.  Eretz Yisroel in fergangenhayt
   un gegenvart: geografye, geshikhte, rekhtlikhe ferheltnise, befel-
   kerung, landvirtshaft, handel un industrye. New York, 1918. (kh"b,
   478 p. illus., maps)

The publisher is the Poalei-Tziyon Palestina Komitet of New York, and it
is dedicated to the memory of "khvernu urenu Dov Barokhov alav hasholem".
Again, there is no mention of any translator (other details of production
are given, such as the person who drew the maps) and I am left with the
distinct impression that the authors wrote it in Yiddish.  The Komitet in
a preface states that they felt duty bound to undertake this publication
because there was absolutely no work of its kind available to the Yiddish
speaking world (gehalten far zayn khoyv tsu geben dem brayten idishn oylem
aza verk, vos iz lakhlutn nit geven benimtse in der idisher shprakh).

Subject: Yiddish and Haredim

I would like to clarify some remarks attributed to me by Abe Brumberg in
sometimes lively discussion over Yiddish in Haredi circles. The context was
a review that he wrote of the Politics of Yiddish, edited by Dov Ber Kerler.
My article in that volume was based on research I had conducted in Israel
well over a decade ago now. In that article, contrary to what Abe Brumberg
suggests, I go the other way to counter the belief among secularists that
haredi Yiddish is weak or diluted. On the contrary, I did write and I quote
myself "there is ample life in Yiddish as an oral language." and again "many
haredi informants speak a rich, colourful and expressive Yiddish sprinkled
with humour, proverbs and, of course, talmudic references" (p94). I do point
out that literary Yiddish or Yiddish grammar per se were not emphasized in
the schools I visited, but the fact of the matter is that there is no
comparison between levels of Yiddish proficiency in the secular Jewish
circles to what exists among many but not all Hasidim.

I just came from reading to a group a story called "Ales vos men tut tut men
far zikh aleyn" that was printed in Der Yid to a group. It is an ordinary
but engaging story, well written, richly phrased and well paced. It was from
a column that draws from old sources.  Written Yiddish has been expanding.
Since I wrote that article I have seen a rapidly evolving range of written
works from hasidic sources.

As to why some deny it, the emotions and reactions are complex. People
sometimes go to war over an alef. There are bitter feelings and pain
involved in losing that world of secular Yiddish. Many were once the
discussions and resolutions over spelling conventions when the readership
was in the millions. But the shift has happened and so if, in Der Yid they
spell unzer differently from undzer, or Montik vs. Montog- all I can say is
that some care more than others and I am pleased that I can turn to frum
sources and happily do so. As a Canadian I learned to spell colour with a
letter u. Does that make it bad? 

There are some who claim ownership over Yiddish. But I recall a Hasid once
saying "Who gave them the hashgofe?" Languages are living things and grow
where one nourishes them. So lets do so.

Subject: Brumberg: Risen from the Dead.

Not having seen a correction for 2 names misspelled in the book review in
Mendele 09.039, may I point out:

(1) In the paragraph beginning  "But this surely begs the issue."  Avrom
Goldfadn, not Goldfagen.

(2) In the paragraph beginning "Though Isaacs is obviously impressed..."
the last line should surely be Emanuel S. Goldsmith, not Goldstein.

Subject: mischpoche

A. In Vol. 09.025 (August 30, 1999) Deirdre Bourke asked about possible
Yiddish sources. 

It would be perhaps of help the recent Yiddish-German Dictionary (Jiddisches
Woerterbuch, Dudenverlag, Mannheim-Leipzig-Wien-Zuerich, 2.  durchgesehene
Auflage, von Ronald L=F6tzsch, 1992), with the format of a pocket
dictionary. Beside the fact of being handy, its structure may fit with the
needs of any freshman, for it: 

 a) spans over a comprehensive vocabulary of all the (three) main dialectal
 forms,

 b) uses romanised letters, but it has a glossary of the Hebrew ones, plus
 the JIWO orthographical exceptions, followed by two entertaining 
 Hebrew-written "homework" texts, with their complete transliteration, vid.
 translations,

 c) includes a short linguistic historical sketch prefacing the dictionary, 
 and

 d) offers, more or less, a grammatical prompter scattered between the
 foreword and the appendix.

Finally, the vocables have their etymology marked, for those from Slavic or
Semitic sources.

I think that it may be still purchased in Germany, Austria or Switzerland
with a price that does not seem exorbitant (at the time, it costed about 16
SFr.). 

B. A very brief comment on mischpoche [family] is that when having read it,
something triggered off my mind, and after some afterthought I realised that
in fact we used it (in family) to spice our conversation, otherwise with
many words that now I re-descover in Yiddish (actually we'd say
"mischpjche", instead, with a more disparaging connotation, as for "gang,
band"). Of course, the dialect, or actually pidgin we speak in the region of
Timisoara/Temesvar/Temeschwar (as a mix of Romanian, German, Hungarian,
Serbian, a.s.o.) was continuously permeable to every and all nationalities
living there (the region is called Banat/Benseg/das Banat, and it means
literally "principality", with a Slavic etymology).

Subject: foygl milch

I also must start my note with a disclaimer.  My knowledge of Yiddish is
currently weak, though Yiddish was my mother tongue until I was about 7
years old. 
    
I read with interest the piece on foygl khale. I do not know foygl khale 
is for a finial letter or not, but my shviger (of blessed memory) who was 
from the Ukraine used the expression,"foygl milch" to mean nonsense. It is 
possible that the appelation foygl+ was commonly used to create specialized 
dialect words to convey the ultimate(?)
    
What is your thought on this matter?

At the risk of appearing to blow my own trumpet, may I please add an item to
Hugh Denman's bibliography of the Yiddish Press:

Susanne Marten-Finnis und Heather Valencia, Sprachinseln. Jiddische
Publizistik in London, Wilna und Berlin 1880-1930, (Koln: Buhlau Verlag,

Subject: yiddish newspapers

In reply to Steven Jacobson:

Having lived in Paris,France in the 50 and 60 I remember there being at
least 2 daily yiddish newspapers "Unser Wort"  socialist and "Die Naie
Press" very left.  I do not believe that these are still being publish but
there is a jewish library in Paris called Medem available on the Internet
and you may be able to communicate with them.
