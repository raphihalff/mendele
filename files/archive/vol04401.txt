Subject: Yiddish on cd-rom

A gezunt oyf dayn pipik!  Your suggestion about placing the corpus of
Yiddish treasures on cd-rom is nothing short of spectacular.  I have no
idea about what kind of work would be involved and I hope that the
computer mavins will come foward to tell us.  To the extent that there is
some dog work involved, I am sure that it would not be difficult to
assemble a small army to get the work done.  I hereby volunteer.  Please
pursue this idea!

Nu, vegn Noyekh Miller's forleyg: makhn a CD-ROM far lernen Yidish, un
leyenen di ale yidishe mekhaberim.  Dos iz take vikhtik un rirndik.
Yidish iz nokh nisht keyn losh far diskutirn Computer technology darf ikh
shraybn English.

I, too, would guess the technical problems are not insuperable.  The
financial one is probably great.  I can imagine very wonderful
possibilities. A dictionary on CD-ROM can be bilingual, trilingual, etc.,
and there need be only one such file.  That file could be searched to
find any word, even those within the definitions or the translation.
Such a file could include several romanization forms, if necessary (or
useful).  Searches can be applied in any direction, English-Yiddish or
Yiddish-English, or what you will.  Help files for grammatical rules
fitting the context could be developed and included. What a JOB!  But,
what a help that would be for beginners and veterans.  One CD-ROM can
include 650 megabytes of information.  That's enough for an encyclopedia
with pictures, such as Funk and Wagnall's.  Without pictures, it could
incorporate the equivalent of about 40 or 50 substantial volumes.

Halevay!  Ver ken es onheybn?

Subject: Itzik Manger for Mother's Day

In search of a program for Mother's Day for our Vinkl, I came upon a poem
by Itzik Manger in a wonderful anthology, "onions and cucumbers and plums
46 Yiddish poems" by Sarah Zweig Betsky (Wayne Statre University Press
Detroit 1958).

A matone for all who love Yiddish and poetry:

              Libshaft

Shlanke hirshn oyf farshneyte berg,
di zilberne herner fartshepen di levone
un di levone iz gut tsu zey.

Mayn mame hit zey. Geyt zey nokh fis-trit.
Di velf in vald zoln nisht derniukhen.
Farlesht zi di shpurn oyf shney.

Mayn mame iz shoin zint yorn toyt,
nor ir libshaft geyt arum in roym
mit ofene orems farn vint.

Zi shlefert ayn dem umru fun di shtrozn,
shprekht op a "gut oyg" di kleyne hozn
un dos mindste veriml ruft zi "kind."

Di libshaft lozt zi nisht in keyver ruen.

Ot efnt zi di tkhine far di shtern
un zogt un zogt, az got zol derhern.

In mayn kholem laykhtn ire trern...

        Love

Tall deer upon snowy hills
their silver horns hooked into the moon.
The moon is benevolent.

My mother guards them. Follows them on foot.
Forest wolves must not find their spoor.
She blows from the snow their scent.

My mother has been dead for years,
but her love roams through space
with arms open to the wind.

She lulls the unrest of the streets to sleep,
conjures up a good eye the little hares can keep,
and the least worm she calls "child."

Her love does not let her rest in her grave.

Here she opens her prayer book for the stars
and prays and prays, that God may hear.

In my dream gleams her tear.

Subject: Oysyes in idiomatishe oysdrukn af yidish

I concluded my post "Ale yidishe oysyes zaynen vikhtik" (4.398,5) with
the statement that all Yiddish-Hebrew letters of the alefbeys are vikhtik
(important), all major, none minor."

There are a number of Yiddish idioms in which a letter from the alefbeys
figures to illustrate or emphasize a specific characteristic of a person
or a situation.  Herewith several examples:

1.  "She told me the entire story _from alef biz sof_, which is, of
course, the same as "from A to Z."

2.  "Loy mit an alef" (lamed with an alef) is said in Yiddish as an
emphatic rejection.  In Hebrew _lamed alef_ means "no," as distinct from
the Hebrew _lamed vov_ which means "to him."

3.  "Er veys nit fun kayn tsures alef" -- he does not know the face of an
alef, said contemptuously of a illiterate person.

4.  "Er vayzt dem ferd a hey in sider" __he shows his horse (the letter)
hey in sider (prayer book), instead of feeding him real, nutritious hay.
[A play on the homonymic "hey" and "hay."]

5.  "Er vet nit optretn afile af a koytse shel yud" -- he won't yield
even the tip of a yud, that is the smallest particle of the letter yud,
although the letter itself is the smallest in the alefbeys.

6.  "Dos pintele yid awoke in him," said about a Jew who in many ways
became alienated from Jewish life and its usual concerns, but in an hour
of a great tragedy to the Jewish people manifested in a dramatic act his
sense of Jewish responsibility ("all Jews are responsible for one
another") by some outstanding gesture of involvement and connectedness.

It is usually said about a person, and "dos pintele yid" is a reference
to the core of one's Jewishness, even if it is only a "pintele," a small
dot, a tiny spark.

But it may also be a reference to the letter _yud_, since in many Yiddish
dialects "yud" is pronounced "yid," the initial letter of yid (Jew),
yidish (yiddish), yidishkayt (Jewishness).

Since the letters of the alefbeys are often referred to collectively as
"di shvartse pintelekh" (the black dots), as in the expression "er iz
bo'ky in the shvarftse pintelekh" -- he is a learned man, totally at home
in Jewish letters -- it is quite likely that the idiomatic expression
"dos pintele yud (yid)" carries _both_ connotations, to a person as well
as to the letter yud proper.

7.  "A tsadik in pelts" -- a pious man in a pelt, one who only pretends
to be pious.  In other words, he is pious only in the _word_ pelts,
spelled pey, ayen, lamed,  (langer) tsadek, but not pious in real life.
It is a play on the homonymic tsadek (letter) and tsadik (pious man, also
khasidik re'be), similar to the "hey" and "hay" in example 4 above.

The accent in both "tsadek" and "tsadik" is on the first syllable, so
when spoken there is no significant difference in sound between them,
thus allowing for the letter ("tsadek") to be also perceived as "tsadik,"
a very frumer (pious) yid  hiding in a fur coat...
