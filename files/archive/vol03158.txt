Was it Mikhl Herzog who coined the expression?: "A language is a
dialect with an army."

Doesn't one use "shures" for lines in a play or poem?
Would "shure" be acceptable for a verse in a play?

Yiddish Association dinner last Dec.

        Leynen is a Yiddish word that is used in any context, namely
koydesh and khol, among all dialects.  Lezn is restricted to
non-religious contexts.  But what has not been clear in the recent
leynen/lezn discussion is that lezn is a daythmerish word.  Despite
the fact that lezn is an old term in Western Yiddish and one that
reached a wide distribution in Eastern Yiddish since the late 19th
century (but never in my immediate family), it's still daythmerish
in Eastern Yiddish.  It is therefore not recommended in Standard
Yiddish.  There goes another YIVOnitse.

        Yes, it is.  And seyfer (=book) is restricted to Jewish
religious books.  But no Jew would use it to refer to a Yiddish
translation of the New Testament no matter how folksish or ekht
those translations claim it to be.  The same restrictions apply to
the term posek.
