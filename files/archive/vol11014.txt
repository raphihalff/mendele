Subject: New Book: "Yiddish: A Nation of Words"

I want to announce the publication of my book, Yiddish: A Nation of
Words. It tells the story of the language geared to an audience that
has little or no knowledge of Yiddish. I have told the history in as
colorful and accessible a way as possible, finding the human element,
the telling anecdote, the appropriate proverb. Of course, I have always
tried to be accurate. I am a journalist, not a scholar, and so I have
approached my material trying to keep in mind what any interested,
intelligent reader might want to know.

I want to thank the Mendele community for answering many of my
questions along the way, and for being an important part of my informal
education. As for details: The official publication date of the book is
October 1. However, the book will be part of a Jewish book promotion
that will be in many, but not all, Barnes and Noble stores for the
month of September. The book should be arriving in other stores during
September. I will be speaking at the Barnes and Noble in Chestnut Hill,
Massachusetts, on Thursday, Sept. 13 at 7:30. I will be travelling to
various Jewish book fairs during the fall.

The book is published by Steerforth Press in South Royalton, Vermont.
It will be issued in paperback a year from this fall by Ballantine. It
will also be translated into German, French and Dutch. For more
information, get in touch with me, or with Stephanie Carter at
Steerforth Press. (stephanie@steerforth.com)

Subject: Gordin's plays

The Yankev Gordin play, "Di Yesoyme," [11.012] can be found in the
NYPublic Library's theater collection.  It is from 1911.  I do not know
if the script is in manuscript, in type-setting, or even in Yiddish
oysyes(a surprising number of yiddish play manuscripts were written in
transliteration, although that seems to be rarer for earlier works).

In any case, access to the play might not be currently possible, as the
Performing Arts Library is moving back to Lincoln Center from the golus
of 43rd and 11th Ave.

Subject: Gordin's plays (Khasye di Yesoyme)

Jacob Gordin's orphan was indeed Khasye, the star of the play Brad
Nash's grandfather saw [11.012].  Almost immediately after their
presentation in New York, Gordin's plays found their way to the touring
Yiddish theatre troupes of Eastern Europe, where they were mounted in
mangled versions that caused him much heartache (as well as denying him
much needed royalties.)  Khasye di Yesoyme, one of Gordin's most
controversial plays, was written in 1903 for his favourite actress Keni
Lipzin, and portrays the miserable treatment by a wealthy family of
their poor next-of-kin.

I am Jacob Gordin's great-granddaughter, working on a biography of his
life and times.  I'm interested in any stories about Gordin.

all the best,
Beth Kaplan

Subject: Gordin's plays

"Khashe di yesoyme" was indeed the title of a very well known Gordin
play, which was performed widely throughout Eastern Europe after 1905.
YIVO should certainly have a copy. The other play, doubtless "Mekhires
Yoysef" (The Selling of Joseph), also often known as "Yoysef mit di
brider" was indeed a generic title for one popular purimshpil that
would have been staged by local folks. On East European purimshpils a
book (in Hebrew) is soon to appear by Ahuva Belkin.

Subject: "deserters"?

Now that the text of Shikl Fishman's unfortunate characterizations of
Janet Hadda and Ruth Wisse as "deserters" has alas come onto the screen
again on Mendele [11.012], it might be a good time to take a breath and
consider just how inappropriate such language is, particularly when
used against those who toil in the vineyard of Yiddish, regardless of
their ideology and sense of where the future of Yiddish lies.
Castigating anyone who devotes a significant part of their life to
teaching and publishing about Yiddish literature and culture as a
"deserter" is both childish and ugly. Worse, it evokes the worst
aspects of the ideological battles of the pre-Khurbn period of Jewish
life in eastern Europe, when it was virtually impossible simply to
affirm a Jewish point of view without engaging in brutal attacks of
those Jews who do not fully share it. One might have hoped that we have
advanced beyond that culture of Jewish self-immolation. Finally, the
unfortunate choice of the word "desetion" conjures -- quite
unintentionally I am sure, given the source -- the image of Yiddish as
a sinking ship, or a besieged and isolated army unit facing imminent
extinction.

Subject: Yiddish press in America between the World Wars

Hello,

I am a communications professor at Ithaca College. I have found an
excellent thesis on the Yiddish press in American before World War I.
The thesis was by Joseph Rappaport in 1951. Is there anything in a
similar vein between World War I and World War II? Thank you.

Subject: Klezfest in Evpatoria

KlezFest supported by Jewish Community Development Fund (NY), a project
of American Jewish World Service, announced today that it would be able
to enlarge this year's KlezFest to take place in Evpatoria, at the
Planeta Hotel from August, 28 - September, 2 from 25 participants to 39
thanks to a grant from the International Renaissance Foundation.

Yana Yanover, Director of the Center and organizer of the project along
with her husband Boris Yanover said: "We were especially pleased
because we had already received more than 100 extremely well qualified
applicants, many of them from cities which did not send musicians or
singers last year.  And now we will be able o admits at least 39 of
them. And our American sponsors will also be pleased since their
director, Martin Horwitz, is always telling us: "Our donors like to see
local partners. It means that people in your own city also value your
project."

Due the help of the above-mentioned sponsors, the organizers of
Klezfest, 2001 were able to invite such well known musicians like the
Director of Jewish theatre "Folksbineh" Zalmen Mlotek (USA), well known
Yiddish songs singer Adrienne Cooper (USA), and Merlin Shepherd, Music
Director for The Royal National Theatre, Royal Shakespeare Company and
Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, London.

39 musicians and actors from Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Russia, Byelorussia,
Latvia and Estonia will gather to develop their skills at master
classes. The scenic skill will teach Eugenia Monarch (Kiev), the
history of the Jewish theatre will teach Alina Ivah (Kazan). There are
individual master classes, theoretical lectures and jam sessions in the
program of Klezfest.  All participants can show their skills in
improvisation, which always was a highlight of klezmer music. It is
necessary to tell, that, having perfected the skill at a last year's
Klezfest, 2000, many participants became the winners of prestigious
musical festivals. That is why new Klezfest, 2001 is expected with the
great impatience not only by musicians.

Jewish Organizations of Crimea showed the big interest to Klezfest,
2001. The final Gala concert will take place at Simferopol with kind
support of "Hesed Shimon" For further information contact, please: USA

Subject: Yankl Boyle

Leon Kobrin wrote a drama - YANKL BOYLE - (pronounced boy-le) which was
produced at the David Kessler Theatre in New York in 1916-1917. I am
sure that other Mendelyaners can draw upon their knowledge and
scholarship and tell us much more about this drama and upon its author
and its performances, and I hope they do!

My question is:  Is "Boyle" just a family name, or is it descriptive?
Does it have any particular meaning? From what language is it derived?
