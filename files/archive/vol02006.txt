The subtle difference between good-luck and
congratulations. In French we say felicitations--  felix
meaning luck in latin--. That muzzltuf shifts between
Hebrew and Yiddish is something I don't quite see,  but
then again I'm not sure I see gutyuntif or maymahroynm
vusser. But when saying muzzltuf it is recommended to have
a shot of bronfin in hand--  where does the word bronfin
come from? and how long has it been in use?

Have we dealt with the origin of kibitz, or kibitzer?
Although there is a Hebrew root, kaf-bet-zayin, meaning
collect, gather [Kibbutz, too, is from that root], it
does not seem to be related.  A little bird told me
that there is a pestery bird with a similar name in
German but my German is hardly good enough.

Subject: Noch Schlimmer mazl

to Hersh Volf Basser (2.04 #1)

I did not intend to deny that mazl means luck, fortune. You
are right that in that Talmud, and even all through the
Middle Ages mazal meant constellations, astrology. When we
wish a mazaldike sho, or sing "siman tov umazal tov yehe
lanu", these are in the future tense. But how am I supposed
to understand "Mazl tov, I heard that your son got
married!" Is this a prayer to the stars about something
that is done already? Or does it mean, that the marriage
should turn out to be successful? In which case mazl means
success, not stars. This is of course still not luck,
unless you are ready to claim that a successful marriage is
only a matter of luck! David Braun is (2.05 #2) absolutely
correct, that mazl came to mean "congratulations".
((Regarding the ironic use of mazl tov when something
breaks: since we scream mazl tov at a wedding when the
glass is broken, one might argue that this reaction to the
sound of breaking glass in other situations may be a Jewish
Pavlovian reflex.))

The English words are confusing, too. Fortune magazine is
not about winning in Las Vegas, and the game-show Wheel of
Fortune is not about picking the lucky stocks. I know that
I am not clear, but I don't have an answer yet. All I know,
is that this is a very understudied concept called
"chance", which would belong to a network devoted to Jewish
philosophy, called - I guess - Spinozele. ((This must mean
"nose twisting", if we follow the oylem - goylem phallacy
that David Roskies described in his article: Forward 5/22.
Are you online, Reb Dovid?))

As for the conventional wisdom which explains the shlemiel
spilling soup on the shlimmazal, I have problems with it.
First of all, as far as I can see, and I am eager to hear
if somebody has proof to refute me, this definition does
not appear in ANY European source. Moreover: If shlimmazal
is an event of bad luck that can happen to anybody, why is
the person sitting there called shlimmazal? Is it a person,
or an event? And if it is a person, but can happen to
anybody, why does he have a special name? If you believe
that they are two separate categories (I disagree) then
shouldn't the case be the reverse? Shlimmazal spilling on
the shlemiel? "I was just getting ready to have my soup,
when, to my shlimmazl, can happen to anybody, my sleeves
got caught in the edge of the table, and there went the
bowl. And that poor loser Shlemiel sitting there, the soup
could have gone to my left, to my right, but no, it landed
straight on his new suit!"

Subject: Bebitsn

While the etymologists are busy with bronfen and kibits,
I wonder if there are any ideas about bebits.  I've always
imagined that it's a matter of flipping one's protruded
lower lip, but the French balbutier just ran through my
head so I wonder.
