Subject: Bashert

"Bashert" is derived from the Middle High German "ez ist mir beschert"
- something alloted to someone by god or destiny, nowadays in modern
German understood as presents given on Christmas. It is similar to the
english word "share" together with a verbal prefix "be-" imposing the
influence on one certain person.

Subject: Diminutives of Yiddish names

In regard to the discussion of abbreviated forms of Yiddish names,
these may not necessarily be diminutives (in the sense of affective
alterations).  Yiddish (like English) shortens and often abolishes
certain unstressed syllables--no matter what the origins of the given
words. German words like "Branntwein" and "Baumoel" become "bronfn"
and "baymel" respectively.  In American Yiddish, "Operator" became
"oprAYter."  And so on.  Biblical names starting with an unstressed
syllable tend to lose that syllable in Yiddish (except when the bearer
of the name is called up to read from the Pentateuch in synagogue). So
that Isroel/Isruel quite naturally became Srol/Srul, which is not a
nickname, but the normal pronunciation in Yiddish--though obviously
forms like "Srulnik" are true diminutives.  (However the name of the
country has always retained the first syllable:  Erets-Yitsroel,
Medinas-Yisroel, etc.)  But just compare Yiddish names like Shloyme,
Elye, etc. with the original Hebrew forms. and compare Yiddish
"Brayndl" with its Teutonic ancestor "Bruennhilde".

There are also false diminutives like "Yentl" (probably from Italian
"gentile", and "Rivke"--the latter having also back-formed a base name
"Rive."

In regard to most diminutives, Yiddish has a certain advantage over
any of its component languages (except for Italian):  it can form a
first- and then second-degree diminutive:  tish, tishl, tishele.
sometimes the diminutive has a different meaning from the base word:
"knop" is a knob, "knepl" a button, and "knepele" a small button.

Historically the Yiddish word "bukh" meant "volume, tome" (from Middle
High German "buoch" meaning "book.  In modern Yiddish, traditionalist
and orthodox Jews referred to a modern secular book as "bikhl"--a
pejorative diminituve.  I wonder if "biklh" was back-formed into
"bukh"--if so, then that explains how the Yiddish word "bukh" acquired
the modern meaning of "book".  Then again, it could have been taken
over directly from modern German like so many Yiddish words borrowings
during the 19th and 20th centuries--including the German word "Band"
(volume) which passed into Yiddish (bant) with its German meaning
"volume" thereby replacing the older usage of the Yiddish word "bukh".

Subject: "Big"

Ellen Prince (6.297) speculates that the source of The Forward's
idiosyncratic way of calling a _makher_ a "big" may be via a loan
translation of _groyser_.  A more likely Yiddish model word would be
_godl_ (meaning a V.I.P. or distinguished person) which is based on
the Hebrew for "big".  Old-time New Yorkers, however, will recognize
this type of journalistic coinage as the legacy of the colorful
telegraphic headlines favored by The New York Daily News, where you
might read something like [I'm making this up....] "Red Med To Wed
Fed" to indicate that a Soviet doctor married an FBI agent.

Subject: Freedman Yiddish Music Collection at Penn

The University of Pennsylvania Library is pleased to announce the
acquisition of the Robert and Molly Freedman Archive of Jewish Music.
onsisting of more than 3,000 songbooks, reference works, and sound
recordings, the Freedman Archive is estimated by scholars to be the
largest and most important collection of Yiddish music in private
hands.

The Archive has been assembled over a period of thirty-five years by
the Freedmans, and it includes the spectrum of Yiddish music: folk
songs, art songs, theatre music, musical comedy, and klezmer music.
It spans art and the camp, secular and sacred, high culture and
popular culture.  The Archive represents a very special  way of
documenting the social and cultural trajectory of the Yiddish-speaking
community of the twentieth century.

The Archive is accessible through computer database created by the
Freedmans for the collection.  This remarkable tool includes over
25,000 entries which index exhaustively the bulk of the Archive.  It
is capable of locating particular artists, titles, genres, Biblical
references, poems, and other categories of interest.  Because the
collection has been so extensively indexed it can answer hitherto
unanswerable questions and open up the field of Yiddish music to
scholars in new ways.  At present, the database is only locally
accessible.  In time, however, the Library hopes to be able to make it
available on the internet.

An inaugural celebration of the Archive and of the achievement of the
Freedmans will be held this coming fall at Penn, when the Archive will
be formally open as part of the Penn Library's collections.

For further information, contact Michael Ryan, Director of Special
Collections, at 215-898-7552 or ryan@pobox.upenn.edu.
