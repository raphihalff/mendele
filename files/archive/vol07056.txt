Subject: Literature on Bund

The Yiddish Committee of the Jewish Federation of Greater Toronto is looking
into featuring the Jewish Labour Bund at the upcoming Jewish Book Fair.

However, we do not know what literature, particularly more recent literary
work, is availabe to feature, as well as to sell.  The material is preferable
in English, but Yiddish, Hebrew, French, Russian, and Spanish would be o.k.
because of the main languages spoken in the Jewish community.

Please let me, and others know what is available on this fascinating 
organization that was so much a part of pre-Holocaust Jewish life, 
particularly in Eastern Europe.

As always, a sheinem dank.

Sheine Mankovsky

Subject: Virtual Ashkenaz

So, I just wanted to mention that the Ashkenaz Festival starts tonight in
Toronto. The "Virtual Ashkenaz" discussions are still sporadic, but covering
everything from Jewish genealogy to Yiddish in Alaska.

Starting tomorrow, I'll be working on getting images and words about the visual 
artists up. The festival officially starts tonight, I guess, with John Zorn's
first performance. My goal is to ensure that Virtual Ashkenaz represents
everything about the festival, and also provides some networking seeds to
continue the festival, virtually, beyond the space of a few intense days.

The general site is still entered on http://www.ashkenaz.org/, and you can
participate in the interactive part, or discuss anything to do with Yiddish
culture, at http://www.ashkenaz.org/virtual.html

As you browse the schedule and music/comedy artists lists, you'll notice that
there are sound samples available in RealAudio 3.0 format available for
instant listening for those who have computers that can handle that format.

The goal of Virtual Ashkenaz is to extend the reach of the festival to
everyone around the world who cares about Yiddish or Yiddish culture. It's an
important experiment, and I hope that we can keep it going after the festival,
as well. 

Come join in!

Subject: Ben Ishai's poetry

For the wonderfully woeful words of weltshmerz in the painful plea of "Hot
Rakhmones", and the following poems expressing such deep love and joy of
learning, my thanks to Alvin Greenberg for his search for his great-
grandfather's poetry, and to Esther Goffstein for her work. Sharing such
discoveries is, perhaps, what Mendele is all about.

The Mloteks might broaden the audience and publish them in the Forverts, or
the Forward.

Subject: "Yoyvl-lid" OR "Anniversary Song"

Regarding the ongoing discussion of Chaim Tauber's Yiddish version of The
Anniversary Waltz (7.048, 7.050-052, 7.054; and 3.134), there is a revealing
entry in Irene Heskes, _Yiddish American Popular Songs 1895 to 1950_
(Washington, D.C.:  1992), the Library of Congress' singularly valuable
reference work on Yiddish sheet music.  Heskes' annotations, "...Based on the
Lawrence Marwick Roster of Copyright Entries," present as comprehensive a
catalog as we might hope for of Yiddish sheet-music titles registered with the
library, organized chronologically by copyright date. (Lawrence Marwick was
head of the Hebraic Section of the Library of Congress from 1948 to 1980.)
Heskes' complete entry for Tauber's published song follows.

[entry no.] 3271
_Der khasseneh valse_
        Ros. no. PM
        Copr. no. EP 141871 Feb. 28, 1947
Mus.:  Ivan Ivanovici
Lyr.:  Chaim Tauber/Towber
Arr.:  Henry Lefkowitch
Prop./pub.:  Henry Lefkowitch; Metro Music Co.
            Piano and voice.  "The wedding waltz."  Sheet music:
        cover with a photo of Towber; a catalog of Yid. music on
        back cover; verses in Heb./Yid. char. on inside front cover.
        "Oh happy time!  Oh, how we danced on the night we were
        wed."  Ivanovici's waltz originated in Europe as a Slavic
        folkstyle piano selection titled _Valurile dundrei_ {"Waves of
        the Danube").  It was published first in this country in
        1896, and again in 1903, by the Theodore Lohr Co. (arr. for
        piano by Simon Adler) and was called "Waves of the
        Danube," by which title it soon became generally known
        here.  Subsequently, the following published versions ap-
        peared:  in 1913, by the Hebrew Publishing Co. (arr. for
        piano by Joseph M. Rumshinsky, also for violin in 1914); in
        1917, by the Saul Schenker Co. (arr. for piano by Jack Kam-
        men); and, in 1919, by the J. and J. Kammen Co. (arr. for
        piano by Joseph Kammen).  All of those piano solo edi-
        tions were reissued several times during the 1920s.  The
        singer Chaim Tauber/Towber wrote the lyrics for many of
        the songs which he performed.  In particular, Towber
        penned the Yiddish, as well as English, words for several
        Russian/Slavic melodies, including this already well-rec-
        ognized instrumental selection.  It fast became one of his
        favorite encores.  By the time that the song was published
        in this popularized ballad form, it had already entered
        into the American musical mainstream, and soon was to
        be known here (and abroad) by its newer English title "The
        Anniversary Waltz."  The Metro Music Co. reissued this par-
        ticular copyrighted version in 1963.  The song continues to
        be treated as "a perennial standard" into current times.

The first thing to notice is the copyright date of 1947.  Though Heskes may be
read in more than one way here, she seems to be suggesting -- following an
unstated assumption -- that Tauber had been singing the song for some time
before he copyrighted his lyrics.  But Saul Chaplin claims he originated the
idea of making Ivanovici's waltz an Anniversary Song in 1946, for use in the
film _The Jolson Story_ (see posts by Bob Rothstein [3.134, 7.052] and myself
[7.050]).  Indeed, the sheet music edition, co-credited to Al Jolson and
Chaplin with music by Ivanovici, is copyrighted 1946.  (Chaplin's slightly
sordid account of Jolson's involvement can be read in his memoir, cited in my
7.050 post.)  I would be interested in seeing or hearing any real evidence
that Tauber had been singing any kind of Anniversary-related lyrics to the
Ivanovici melody before Jolson's English-lyric hit recording appeared.  If
such evidence exists, it would provide a splendid example of how Yiddish
popular culture was filtered and reprocessed in American mass media, not to
mention inflecting the sense in which we must read Chaplin's account of how
inspirations were (are) supposedly spontaneously generated in Hollywood.

So much for scurrilous supposition. The salient fact remains that Tauber's
copyright followed that of Jolson-Chaplin, and in the absence of contrary
evidence, it would appear that Tauber took his inspiration from the Jolson 
film and/or hit record.  What I find so exceedingly interesting about all this
is that even as careful an annotator as Heskes seems to have fallen into the
assumption that the Anniversary-ness of the song had been around for many
years, and that there was a kind of folk status accorded to it.  I am using
the word folk here in the somewhat incendiary sense that what working
musicians call a standard in urban commercial music ("perennial standard,"
Heskes says inside quotation marks) suggests the same kind of collective
ownership by performers that one allows in the repertories of so-called
primitive and pre-modern societies.  (I know this is liable to ignite some
controversy among professional ethnographers and ethnomusicologists -- to say
nothing of copyright attorneys and licensing agents -- and I look forward to
reading about the error of my ways.)

There is no question that the melody -- Ivanovici's "Waves of the Danube"
-- had become such a standard, a tune every working musician knew.  What I
had not included in my earlier post about Chaplin's account is that he also
said he knew the tune from at least as far back as his own bar mitzvah (he
was born in 1912), when he played it on the mandolin.  This is not in the
least surprising in light of Heskes' (Jewish) history of published popular
arrangements that suggests a vigorous market for the sheet music within
Yiddish-oriented communities.  The houses she mentions -- Lohr, Schenker,
Hebrew Publishing, Metro, and Kammen -- were all publishing large inventories
of Yiddish folk and theatrical sheet music.  With the exception of the Kammen
brothers, who began in Brooklyn (if I am not mistaken), all were Lower East
Side firms.

Ivanovici's melody, meanwhile, has also been recorded many, many times. Its
pre-Anniversary Song discography would include arrangements and marketing
profiles in the categories of (light) classical, popular, and "race."  Of
those on "race" labels, however, there are surprisingly few Jewish (=Yiddish)
versions, given its abundant sheet music history on the Lower East Side.  I
found thirteen recordings of Ivanovici's melody listed in Richard Spottswood's
magisterial _Ethnic Music on Records:  A Discography of Ethnic Recordings
Produced in the United States, 1893 to 1942_ (Urbana:  University of Illinois
Press, 1990); Mendelistn will appreciate reading, incidentally, that Henry
Sapoznik and Bob Rothstein are acknowledged for their contributions to this
monumental reference work.  Of those recordings, only one is listed as being
on a Jewish disc.  The complete statistics are:  four Polish; two each of
"Scandinavian" and "Spanish"; and one each of Bohemian (i.e., Czech), Danish,
German, Hungarian, and Russian.  The astute reader will note that this comes
to thirteen recordings, which is the total number I said I found, and yet 
where is the Jewish disc?  One of the Scandinavian titles, recorded in New 
York in 1919 for Victor by accordionist John Lager with Eric Olson (also
accordion?), was also released in Jewish, Lithuanian, German, Croatian, Dutch,
and Polish versions.  The very same recording, in other words, was marketed
with titles and labels retranslated in six more languages after the Swedish
original.  Spottswood gives the titles of the Jewish and German pressings (two
different discs) as "Donauwellen," and adds that even the names of the artists
remained the same for all seven versions, with no evident attempt at creating
new ethnic identities for the Scandinavian accordionists.  So the Jan
Peerce-Abe Ellstein collaboration on Vanguard hardly represents the first
Yiddish effort at recording Ivanovici's melody. That distinction probably goes
to the Swedes John Lager and Eric Olson! I've now also seen a catalog entry
for another Yiddish recording Abe Ellstein made of the "Anniversary Waltz,"
by the way, with the Feder Sisters performing the song on the album "Some Like
It Yiddish" (United Artists Records UAL 3160, 1959).  The bibliographic record
indicates some confusion about the date, suggesting it may have been from 1950
and/or 1959.  It's worth noting, however, that Billy Wilder's film "Some Like
It Hot" was also released by United Artists in 1959, and it seems doubtful
that, of the two, it was the film (about two female-impersonating club 
musicians) that was the spin-off, capitalizing on some wild success the Feder
Sisters had enjoyed nine years previously.  But you never know.

Lastly, I must remark on Ivanovici's first name.  Heskes records that his name
is given as Ivan in the Tauber sheet music.  That would appear to be 
consistent with Ion, as reported by Bob Rothstein (3.134, 7.052), which I take
to be the Rumanian form of the same name.  The overwhelming majority of sources 
with which I am familiar, however, give the composer's name as Iosif Ivanovici
(if they include any first name at all).  Citing the _New Grove's Dictionary_
as my source (7.050), I carelessly spelled it as Jospeh, which was inaccurate.
