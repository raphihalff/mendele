Subject: Roykh and ruakh

I remember a phrase like "er varft zikh vi a rikh", relating to someone having
a tantrum.  Can anyone enlighten me about whether this is the same word or a
completely different one.

Subject: Yiddish fonts on Hebrew Windows

I just received and installed "Kabbalah Yiddish", a collection of Yiddish
fonts that work in Hebrew Windows and Microsoft Word in Hebrew.  They are very
nice and seem to work well.  The only think I would like that it doesn't have
is "tvey yudn," "pasekh tsvey yudn" is, however, there.  The fonts cost $89.
If you would like to know more about my experience with them or with Hebrew
Windows/Word, etc. please contact me directly so as not to over-clutter
Mendele.
