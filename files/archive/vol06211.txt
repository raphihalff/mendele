Subject: Bet lemden: a correction

In my previous message to the list [6.210] I asked for information on
the phrase "bet lemden."  It should have been "bet hemden."

Sorry for the typo!

Subject: Women Yiddish writers

Ellen Cassedy asks for leads on Women writers of short stories for use
in her daughter's Yiddish bas mitzvah....Reminds me that when I taught a
class in Yiddish Literature in translation a couple of years ago I was
struck by the notable absence of women Yiddish fiction writers. While
women are well represented as poets, fiction writers appear to be
exclusively male.

I'd certainly appreciate hearing about women who were fiction writers
--especially ones who would have been contemporaries of Mendele Moicher
Sforim or Sholem Aleichem and I. Peretz.

Subject: Soviet Yiddish writers and the Forward

"Der Yiddish-Vinkl" column in the last Forward (Jan 24, p.11) is
dedicated to the Yiddish writers who were killed by Stalin in 1952. The
column has no byline, which perhaps means that it reflects the editorial
opinion. The central passage of the column reads:

"Today, these martyred writers are heroes. At one time, however, they
were looked upon as heretics who had betrayed their people with their
words in praise of the Russian Revolution, Birobidzhan and the communist
regime. They were playing the game that the marranos had played
centuries earlier when they were Catholics on the outside and Jews on
the inside. These Yiddish writers were Stalinists on the outside and
Jews on the inside."

Without going into deep discussion about ideological and political
persuasions of these writers, one thing is clear: any one-line
simplistic formula ("Stalinists on the outside and Jews on the inside"
in this case) applied to all of them does great disservice to their
memory and to the historical truth. If for nothing else, just because
there were many of them, they were very different, and all of them
underwent complex evolution during their lifetimes. And all what is
known about them from their works, their lives and their deaths suggests
that Communism or Socialism for them, as well as for countless other
intellectuals of their generations, was not "the game", but a rather
profound belief in better future for their people (whom they hardly
betrayed by praising the Russian Revolution) and for the world at large.
Of course, writers' vision of Communism might have been very different
from that of Stalin, but it does not mean that they were "playing
games".

It seems to be quite ironic that Forward effectively vindicates Stalin
and his henchmen in the killings:

"They [writers] were playing games with Stalin on "Uncle Joe's" home
turf. They lost. They were executed."

Simple, clean, and kosher, like the neighborhood butcher shop. Indeed,
the writers (and other members of the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee)
were accused, tried, and executed precisely on these grounds: that they
were Communists (Soviet patriots) on the outside and Jews (bourgeois
nationalists, Zionists, imperialist agents, rootless cosmopolitans) on
the inside. And MGB investigators and prosecutors just did what they
were supposed to do: fight the turncoats.

In the subscription advertisement in the same issue Forward prides
itself as "The Unbroken Link in American Jewish Journalism". Probably
Forward never particularly liked Soviet Yiddish writers, but does it
necessitate dubious "marranic" compliments in paying tribute to them?

Today, thanks to some changes in and around the former Soviet archives,
we know better why and what happened in the Soviet Union in the late 40s
- early 50s. Several excelent monographs and document collections are
must reading for everyone interested in modern Jewish history (detailed
bibliography is available at

The whole picture contains much more colors (and different ones) than
Marrano-Stalinist schema.

Subject: moyshe kapoyer

When I was a child, my family often used the name moyshe kapoyer to refer
to someone when they were either upside down or doing something in a way
they considered backwards, inside out, or counterproductive.

I've been told that moyshe kapoyer was a character who was the subject
of cartoons in the forverts.

I would appreciate any information about moyshe kapoyer, including
people's memories of how the name was used in their families,
descriptions of the cartoons, or where I might find copies of the
cartoons.  If the forverts has an archive, how would I access it and
what years should I look for.

a sheynem dank.
