Subject: hebrew contraints in yiddish

hi, mikhl. i'm sure many will think i'm nit-picking, but, for the record,
the cases you mention are instances of *lexical* influences from hebrew
in yiddish (and would no doubt be handled as borrowings, not active
productive constraints), not *grammatical*, where grammatical =
syntactic. so far as i know, there are no grammatical/syntactic
constraints in yiddish. i'm making this point only because the blurring
of these distinctions is what has given rise to certain claims about the
'real nature' of both yiddish and (modern) hebrew that we all know about.

off to israel in a few hours--see you next week.

Subject: paplyonik

I know of _paplyonik_ from a Yiddish speaker from Suchowola, between
Grodno and Bialystok -- a baked good, about which I don't have details at
hand.  If I'm not mistaken, my informant referred to it in the diminutive
only, _paplyonikl_.  Note the /l/ is the "light" l, therefore I put a "y"
after the "l".

Subject: Hebrew words in Yiddish:  Dictionary

Avrom-Yiyzkhok Blair asks about a source for Hebrew(-Aramaic) words in
Yiddish.  MENDELEnik Steve Jacobson has just published a nifty "Guide to
the more common Hebraic words in Yiddish".  It contains most of the words
I've tested it with, though Steve of course acknowledges that it's not
exhaustive, with 1500 entries.  You can enter it either with the
traditional spelling or with the phonetic respelling.  $10 postpaid from
him at PO Box 82849, Fairbanks, Alaska 99708.  [Steve's area of
professional expertise is Eskimo languages].

Subject: olevasholem

I concur with Mikhl Herzog that the distinction between the male and
female forms is lax, if it all available, for EEur born speakers.  My
grandmother, well-versed in Hebrew, would sometimes correct herself
(especially when I'd raise an eyebrow), but usually made no distinction
between der tate olevasholem and di mame olevasholem.  When the feminine
form _was_ used, it was [ole'yasho'lem].  The form /olevasholem/ was
pronounced as written or, just as commonly, [alvisho'lem], so we have
some vowel deletion and akanje going on.

Subject: Zishe

Jeremy Stern asked about the origin of Zishe.  This was my great
grandfather's name.  I had always thought it related to zis but finally
found that it probably came from Zeus.  In Russian he was actually called
Zusya.  I haven't caught up on all of last week's Mendele postings yet.
Perhaps there are other explanations? Our family used to believe it had
something to do with sweetness because of the similarity to zis.  I like
the Zeus explanation myself.
