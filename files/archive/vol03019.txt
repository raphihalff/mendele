Subject: 50 Yiddish words you can't live without

Moshe Waldoks, I'd love to see your list of 50 Yiddish words people
can't live without.  It's a wonderful idea.  Would you post the
list?

Subject: idioms; oysgelasene shprikhverter

More favorites:

1.  "ni(sh)t geshtoygn, ni(sh)t gefloygn" = totally false; nonsense

2.  "nor dos hot mir gefelt!" = (ironically)  That's all I need(ed)!
Cf. Jascha Kessler's father's "treft mir a gli(c)k!"

************

Moshe Waldoks calls attention to Bernshteyn's collection of vulgar
proverbs, published separately from the respectable compendium.  The
contents of the former have been reprinted in paperback by Perivale
Press (1975, 1979), with English translations on facing pages, as G.
Weltman & M.S. Zuckerman "Yiddish Sayings Mama Never Taught You".

Once again, thanks to Shleyme Axelrod for his contributions to the
idiom collection, and once again some comments from me.

1. bay undz, "afn himl a yarid" referred to something that not only
wasn't true, but was (under the circumstances) impossible.  For
something that simply wasn't true the phrase "nisht geshtoygn, nisht
gefloygn" would probably be more appropriate.

2. "Yoshke Pandre" is new to me and I don't know what Pandre refers
to, but I know there's a novel by one of the "post-classical"
Yiddish novelists (I'm embarrassed not to remember which one)
which is entitled "Noyakh Pandre".  Can any one elucidate?

3. Which reminds me: "Noyakh mit zibn grayzn" refers to a piece of
work which is really botched up.  It stems from the high degree of
incompetence required to make seven errors in writing the two letter
(nun khes) name Noyakh.

4. Speaking of names, how about "Rokhl bitkho a nakete"?  This is a
word play based, of course, on the biblical phrase "rokhl bitkho ha
ktane" which Jacob uses in making his deal with Uncle Lovn who
swindles him by substituting the older daughter, Leye.  In Yiddish
"b'rokhl bitkho ha ktane" means something like "in black and white",
i.e. as a firm agreement.  It's funnier when you metathesize the kuf
and nun and wind up with "(h)a nakete".

5. "dergeyn di yorn" is to pester, annoy, badger, bother.

6. "zayn in di yorn" is to be of advanced age, but this is relative.
"A yid in di yorn" is an elderly man; "a meydl in di yorn" may a
young woman who has been of marriageable age for some time.  My
grandmother at age 18 was already "a meydl in di yorn", when she
was married to my grandfather, a promising youth of 16.  This was
around 1883.

7. NB: "yid" in authentic Yiddish is usually unmarked, i.e. in most
contexts it simply means "man", although it can't, of course, refer
a non-Jewish man.

But suppose, instead of being 18, she was already a gezunte 45 or 50
when she first married?  In that case, like my Tante Sarah, she was
a _moyd_ in di yorn.  Shtelt zikh a frage: ven vert fun a meydl a
moyd?

Akhuts dem, ven vert fun a meydele a meydl?
