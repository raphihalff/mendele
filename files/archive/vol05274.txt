Subject: Origin of self-designation "Yiddish"

A colleage of mine who works in Native American laguages has two questions:
(a) the first time that the speakers of Yiddish described themselves as
speaking a language called Yiddish--I notice that "ivri-deytch" is used in
Peretz, and paused before I answered with any assurance and (b) the influence
of Khazar on Yiddish (I take it he is referring to the Slavic language of the
tribe which allegedly converted to Judaism). I apologize for questions which
have been raised before--please direct me to the archives under the
appropriate subject if this is where I should look.

Re David Herskovic's post "chiribiom" [5.260]:

There is a song titled "Tshiribim" that might be the chorus to the one you
mentioned. The Yiddish Song Book, Stein and Day, Publishers, says the chorus
is a wordless Chassidic nigun (melody) to be sung and danced to with great
joy. Tshiribim,tschribom, Tshiribim-bam-bim-bam-bom etc.

Subject: Khsidishe yiidish, ad bli day

In vol. 5.263, Ellen Prince and David Lidsky suggested reasons for the
preponderance of daytshmerisms and the use of German-influenced spelling in
Khsidishe Yiddish.

Ellen suggested that it was a matter of dialect differences:  Poland had more
contact with and immigration from Germany than Lithuania and Russia, and so
Polish Yiddish acquired more German borrowings and German influence than did
Lithuanian Yiddish;  when the standardizers did their thing, they did it
within a dialect with relatively few German borrowings, and labeled the ones
that weren't theirs as daytshmerisms.

As no great fan of standard Yiddish, I liked Ellen's explanation, but I have
some reservations about it.

My impression is that there was quite a lot of emigration from Poland to
Germany and Austria in the last century before the war, but not much the other
way--Poland was poorer than a church mouse's shrayim.  Maybe we can blame it
on the mail that came back from the emigrants.

As for other forms of contact, I imagine that in most matters Poland had much
more contact with Germany than Lite or Russia.  And don't forget that
Galitsye, Czechoslovakia and Hungary were under an Austro-Hungarian government
until World War I, and part of Poylin was under Prussia.  But in the haymishe
community, my impression is that there was much more contact between the Lite
and Germany than between Poland and Germany.  The Lite had famous yeshives, to
which many German Orthodox Jews sent their sons to learn.  And Germany had
famous universities, to which many Orthodox Litvaks of a slightly modern bent
went to study, including some of the best and brightest from the yeshives.
Poland had little to do with either phenomenon:  university was absolutely out
of the question for the Polish Orthodox Jew, and Poland had no yeshives to
speak of until R. Mayer Shapire opened Yeshivas Chachmei Lublin (in the early
1930s?).  German Jews were an odd sight in Poland, and a short jacket is
called a "daytshl" because it was the strange garb of German visitors.  So if
there was more contact between Poland and Germany than between Lite and
Germany, I would say it must have been outside frime circles;  in frime
circles, there was probably more contact between Germany and the Lite than
between Germany and Poland.

Still, we have to ask, how did this contact affect dialects?  It is possible
that increased contact (particularly within the close confines of a yeshive)
would make for a heightened awareness of dialect differences, and that
heightened awarenss would make for _less_ borrowing than in areas where the
contrast wasn't as noticeable.  Or, it may be that the pattern of contact was
different in the secular community, and Poylishe-yiidish speakers as a whole
had more contact with Germany than did litvishe-yiidish speakers, and the
Polish dialect changed as a whole, without any major differences between the
religious and secular communities.  [See the recent Mendele polemics on the
history, extent and character of a distinction between religious and secular
yiidish, where I argued that until recently, even the yiidish of secular Jews
was permeated with frimkayt (in frime yiidish, I would have said Yiddishkayt
;-), and that such is no longer the case.]

This brings me to David's suggestion.  He quoted the following explanation for
the preponderance of Germanized spelling:  "In the late nineteenth century
(such) germanized spelling became standard in Yiddish and despite its having
originated with their ideological enemies traditional Orthodox Jews adopted it
as did other people. When in the early twentieth century modern orthographies
were developed by people who were not as traditionally religiously inclined as
they, traditional religious Jews rejected modern spelling (because it was the
product of people seen by them as secularizers) and just stuck to the old
system, as they still do." He then suggested that a similar explanation could
account for the preponderance of daytshmersms in religious yiidish.  I like
his suggestion, but there's one piece missing:  why did religious Jews reject
the second standardization, but not the first?  I can think of a few different
reasons.

One could explain it through the character of the political struggle over
Yiddish.  At the time of the first change, Yiddish was already something of a
political issue, but there was no need for the religious camp to fight it in
the trenches--Yiddish was the language of daily use for the religious
community, and there was no need to take a stand on particular details of
vocabulary.  Or maybe they did see a need to fight it, but they failed;
fighting a new word which is in circulation is, burikhashem, one of the most
futile enterprises known to man (just ask the official academies of French and
Hebrew).  By the time the second wave of reforms began to reach the religious
community, Yiddish was declining, and was much more of a fighting issue--it
was definitely more so in America than in Europe, where the language of
instruction in khadorim and yeshives was never in question--so a religious
"maintain-everything-exactly-as-it-was"-movement, the only one which has
preserved a living yiidish to this day, insisted on keeping the germanized
spellings.  And orthography is much more easily controlled than vocabulary.

But a more likely explanation lies in the connection between the religious and
secular communities and their respective yiidishes. The degree of contact
between them at the time of the second wave of reforms was much slighter than
at the time of the first.  I don't think the second standardization has really
been noticed in the religious Yiddish-speaking community;  it's not something
which we've been fighting.  YIVO is virtually unknown, even as an
organization, and definitely not as an authority over the language.  The YIVO
standardization was not so much rejected as unnoticed.  Chareidi rhetoric
about Yiddish usually revolves around getting peple to use it more (or
less)--not on how to spell it, or which words are "correct" Yiddish.

I should add, before I keel over and fall asleep, that some aspects of this
topic came up in private discussion with Reb Noyekh a while back, and some of
what I wrote above includes ideas which I got from him.  Once again,
yash'koyakh.

Subject: Az me git, nem!

Leonard Prager noticed [5.271] that "Az me git, nem!" sounds better in Yiddish
than in Hebrew (English with its "If you are given something, take it"
[F.Kogos, 1001 Yiddish Proverbs] is clearly out of contest). If the phonetic
'quality' is an indicator here, Russian succint "Daiut - beri" wins by a wide
margin. Russian equivalent for "Az men git nem, az men nemt -- shray gevald!"
is also very laconic: "Daiut - beri, b'iut - begi" (If you are given
something, take it; if you are being beaten, run away). Interestingly, the
meaning of a related proverb "Az Got vil nit geben, ken men zich alein nit
nemen" is opposite from its Russian counterpart "Na Boga nadeisia, a sam ne
ploshai" (Count on God, but don't miss your opportunities). Red oif 'secular
Yiddish'!
