Subject: Yiddish theater diminished (fwd)

  I thought this might be of interest to Mendelniks.  Sorry if
  someone already passed it along.  Any comments, perhaps from those
  who can tell us about their own experiences in/with/at the Yiddish
  theater?

HOLLYWOOD (UPI) -- The Yiddish theater, among America's most colorful
show business traditions, has almost faded away.

	At one time there were a dozen Yiddish theaters in New York
City, small places where Jewish immigrants from Russia, Poland and
Germany, many of whom spoke little English, could be entertained.

	Each theater had its own impressario, producers, directors
and musicians. The actors circulated from one venue to the next,
sometimes hitting the road to play Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia.

	In summertime they headed for the ``borscht belt,'' vacation
hotels in the Catskills, affectionately called the Jewish Alps.

	Over the years assimilation and intermarriage have taken
their toll. Succeeding generations all spoke English, often better
than the natives. The need for Yiddish -- a linguistic hybrid of
German and Hebrew -- became unnecessary for Jewish entertainers,
writers and musicians who joined mainstream theater, as did Jewish
theatergoers.

	Burlesque, vaudeville, movies, radio and TV accelerated
assimilation to a point that Yiddish entertainment is in danger of
dying out altogether in the United States. And elsewhere.

	Fyvush Finkel, one of the stars of CBS's acclaimed drama
series ``Picket Fences,'' remembers Yiddish theater very well. He
was one of its stars for 50 years or so.

	Finkel, 71, who plays irascible attorney Douglas Wambaugh in
the series, is one of the very few veterans of Yiddish theater to
cross over to mainstream.

	At a Bel-Air hotel, a temporary home while he works in
``Picket Fences,'' the longtime actor enjoyed taking his wife of 46
years, singer-writer Gertrude Lieberman, to lunch.

	``When I got into Yiddish theater in 1935 it wasn't as big
as it was at the turn of the century,'' Finkel said. ``It really
began to wane toward the early '40s as the old people from Europe
began to fade away.

	``I was a star. We toured cities where there were large
Jewish communities. A season used to last 41 weeks. The other 11
weeks we performed in the Catskills.

	``I had a comedy act so I could play the hotels. But mainly
I played the Second Avenue Theater, the National and all the others
except one that specialized in 'art' like Shakespeare. They wouldn't
talk to me. I was considered 'shund,' a Yiddish word meaning
commercial theater. I also played the two vaudeville houses.''

	Finkel is a large man with expressive eyebrows, a deep
baritone and an ample waistline. His nose is shaped like a dill
pickle, his eyes are alive and mischievous. He looks exactly like
the character actor he is.

	``The nice thing about Yiddish theater, you were never out
of work. If a new musical folded, no big deal. The next week we had
another new musical with scenery and everything.

	``Our plays were written by Jewish dramatists. We even did
soap operas on Yiddish radio station WEVD. There's nothing new under
the sun. Sometimes a hit would run 35-40 weeks. I always played
comic roles, the guy who never got the girl.

	``A favorite drama theme was a little boy in Europe leaving
home to find his fortune in America. The family waves goodbye at the
railroad station. A real tear-jerker. When he becomes prominent in
America he forgets his parents. Then they come over with help from
HIAS, Hebrew Immigration Aid Society.

	``The parents go to hear a famous opera singer who sings the
same song he sang as a child. The parents leave their seats and walk
with open arms to the stage to greet their son -- and I tell you
there isn't a dry eye in the house.

	``There was a lot of boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy
gets girl, or maybe he gets her mother.'' Always looking for a
laugh, Finkel broke himself up with that.

	``At the beginning most dramas were set in Russia or
Germany, later they were contemporary New York stories.

	``As the years passed we began sprinkling more English into
the dialogue because younger audiences all spoke the language.''

	Now only one Yiddish theater survives in New York, but
Finkel is optimistic it will endure for many years to come.

	``The last remaining one is called Folksbiene,'' he said.
``It's subsidized and still in Yiddish. They don't worry about going
out of business. Everybody works for nothing. It's a labor of love.

	``Anybody wants to do Yiddish theater, it's still there. It
will never die because it is part of the Jewish tradition in this
country.

	``Even though I am a part of a very fine TV series, I still
enjoy working in theater. I went on tour doing 'Fiddler on the
Roof,' which I thought was a great honor.''

Subject: Jews, diabetes and Mencken

David Sherman asks whether Jews are really statistically more likely
to have diabetes than non-Jews; no doubt someone will post the
information.  But I recall reading what H.L. Mencken is said to have
said when someone accused Jews of primitiveness.  It was something
like, "When our Anglo-Saxon ancestors were still painting
themselves blue, living in caves, and eating roots and wild berries,
the Jews ALREADY had diabetes."  (I know about Mencken's own
apparent antisemitism, but that's a separate issue.  And now that I
look at it, that "ALREADY" has its own yidisher tam.)
