===========

I am happy to announce the good news, that on the 3rd of March, 1996, the
Israeli Parliament (the 'Knesset') passed a new law in favour of the Yiddish
language and culture. This law is for establishing a government body under the
Ministry of Education, which will be involved with various aspects of Yiddish
language and culture in Israel.

The first steps toward this were made in 1990, when the 'Hemshekh Dor Ohavei
Yidish' (Lovers of Yiddish), -- thanks to the initiative of the chairman
Daniel Galay -- began a sort of lobbying action amongst MKs (Members of the
Knesset), to help strengthen the position of the Yiddish language and culture.
He understood, that in order for Yiddish to live, protected, in the Jewish
land, it must be officialy recognized by government departments, and
subsequently supported by a government body, and government funds.

During the preceding 6 years, this effort did not cease on the part of the
Hemshekh Dor Ohavei Yidish, and the original Law proposal was prepared by us
and sent out by our lawyers to many MKs who were simpathetic to the idea.
Member of the Knesset Dov Shilansky presented the law-proposal (with certain
modifications), and during the next few years, ongoing efforts were made in
order that at the right moment, it should be presented to the Knesset Plenum.
Various other Yiddish interest groups such as the World Council for Yiddish
and Jewish Culture under the late Professor Yitskhok Warshavsky also
contributed to the initiative.

I will present the essence of the law for you:

The new law is named: "khok hareshut haleumit letarbut hayidish" ("Law for the
National Authority for Yiddish Culture"). A commission of 21 persons will be
created (under the Minister of Education), which will be involved with Yiddish
language and culture in Israel. Amongst the 21: representatives of the
Academia, of teachers and of the Teachers' Union, of the Union of Yiddish
Writers and Journalists, government representatives, from the Academy of the
Hebrew Language, from the World Council for Yiddish and Jewish Culture, and
from the Hemshekh Dor Ohavei Yiddish.

The goals are, amongst others:

1. Deepening the people's awareness of Yiddish culture in all its forms, and
   provide for its research and teaching, utilizing all media of communication
   to achieve this;

2. Supporting creativity in Yiddish;

3. Supporting those institutions who conduct an activity in Yiddish;

4. Gathering, cataloguing and preserving Yiddish Folks treasures, both in
   written and oral form;

5. Supporting the publication of works in Yiddish and Yiddish works in Hebrew
   translation;

In the document concerning the 'Authority for Yiddish', there are various
administrative and legal obligations and points, and there is also reference
to budget considerations and to an executive director who will be employed to
carry out the work. The law will officially come into effect 3 months after it
is officially published in the governments registers (sometime within the next
2 weeks).  The commission will then have until one year's time to organize
itself, to work out milestones, and to present a work plan and budget.

A 'yesher koyakh' to Daniel Galay and to his wife, Advocate Khana Galay, who
undertook to realize this project with so much devotion, and also to all the
others who worked so hard to guaranty a governmental status for the Yiddish
language and culture. And a special thanks to Dov Shilanski for his efforts
and devotion for Yiddish.

Subject: Why Mendele has been silent

There appears to be a problem somewhere in the pipeline that connects your
shames with the Trinity computer.  Enough of it has been resolved to enable
me to download incoming posts to Mendele and to send them out again after
editing off-line.  So we can hope to resume regular transmission of Mendele.

Unfortunately I'm still unable to answer mail (someone has dumped a pot of
pitsya into the works of some machine somewhere), so I apologize to the many
Mendelyaner who've written on a whole host of matters.  This note will have to
serve as a temporary answer to all.  Apologies.  Patience.

Noyekh Miller
