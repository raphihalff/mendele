Subject: Argentine YIVO Bombed

The appalling television images and newspaper photographs of the
terrorist bombing of the building in Buenos Aires that housed a number of
major Jewish organizations reveal something of the dimensions of the
human tragedy -- the loss of at least 26 innocent lives, the physical
destruction of the nerve center of a major Jewish community.  Today's NY
Times has an article in which two of the organizations located at 633
Pasteur -- destroyed in yesterday's bombing -- are mentioned:  AMIA (the
Central Ashkenazi community) and DAIA (the representative body of
Argentine Jewry -- equivalent to the Canadian Jewish Congress).  The
third floor of that building housed the Argentine branch of YIVO, and it
is now apparent that one of the great Jewish archival and library
collections (with particular strengths in Yiddish literature and
Argentine Jewish history) has now been obliterated.  If anyone has
further details, please pass them along.  I will also update the story as
the picture emerges.

Subject: Khazn Zavl Kvartin

If I remember correctly, Khazn Zavl Kvartin wrote an autobiography.  Ms.
Feins is sure to find an endless amount of information there about her
roots. (I'm sorry I don't have the book at hand, nor do I remember the
title.)

Subject: translation problems

     I want to join the discussion on the problems of translation.  All
the suggestions I've seen from the Mendele khevre apply in one situation
or another. The most generally applicable comment, in my opinion, was
that the translator must be adept at writing in whatever language into
which he is translating the Yiddish.

     There is another problem which applies to all writing, but
especially to poetry.  All writing must sound right, but it is vital in
poetry.  Here's what I think is a striking example.

     In "Yankev Glatshteyn" (by Janet Hadda, Twayne's World Authors
Series, TWAS 566, Boston: Twayne Publishers, 1980) the author discusses
poems of Yankev Glatshteyn.  Of particular interest in this context is
her quotation of a Yiddish poem, "On Yidn".

     The poem is published in English translation in the High Holy Day
Prayer Book (Reform), Gates of Repentance, The New Union Prayer Book for
the Days of Awe, ed. Chaim Stern, New York: Central Conference of
American Rabbis, 1978, pp. 436-438.

The translation begins,
"Without Jews there is no Jewish God,"
and ends,
"Is this not the sin of all 'good' people?"

     The poet addresses God (p. 437 in the Prayer Book):

Who will dream You?
Who will remember You?
Who deny you?
Who yearn for You?
Who, on a lonely bridge,
Will leave You - in order to return?

     The English is fine.  As a poem, the English stands on its own as
respectable poetry.  Further, it is a good translation as to essence of
meaning.  For the ear, however, it falls short. The sounds are too
mellifluous.  It fails to evoke the harshness of the topic: the
Holocaust.

     The sounds of the Yiddish more truly convey the anger and
reproach.

Ver vet dikh kholemen?
Ver gedenken?
Ver vet dikh leykenen?
Ver vet dikh benken?
Ver vet fun dir, af a farbenkter brik,
Avek fun dir, kedey tsu kumen tsurik?

     In addition to the meaning of the Yiddish words, The sounds of the
k's and the kh's speak volumes.  In the last line, the harsh sounds of
the k's and the ts's underline the depth of desperately disappointed
feeling.

P.S.  Sadly, I found no acknowledgments in the Prayer Book of 1) Glatshteyn
as author, 2) the translator, nor 3) that it is a translation
from Yiddish.
