Subject: pipapo nokh amol

Riding on a New York City subway home from work this evening, the last
thing on my mind was the never ending saga of "pipapo;" but alas I came
across a documented use of the expression in a contemporary collection
of German attitudes regarding the reunification of Germany, more
reductively interpreted as the decline and fall of the German Democratic
Republic.  But aside from the politics of that "situation," - "pipapo"
turns up already at the very beginning of Klaus Pohl's "Wartesaal
Deutschland Stimmen Reich" (Rotbuch Verlag, Hamburg; 1995). Sure enough,
(in the second sentence!) a woman of Eastern German origins, described
as having a "heavy East-Berlin accent" (this would go along with
Johannes Seppi's comment in 6.067 that pipapo has a north German feel to
it) expresses the following:

	"Frueher habe ich in der Wissenschaft gearbeitet
	 ich habe ganz friedlich hier am Schreibtisch gesessen
	 ich habe meine Dissertation geschrieben
	 Artikel Buecher Pipapo..."

	 ["In earlier times, I was an involved academic
	   I very readily sat at my desk
	   I wrote my dissertation
	   articles books pipapo..."] (perhaps one would translate here for
	                the expression pipapo, a phrase like "you name it").

Personally though, I prefer Berel Leiser's Puccini excursion into the
realms of Turandot (also 6.067).  I'll never hear Ping, Pang and Pong
without an extra laugh.

Please excuse this little diversion away from the realms of Yiddish!
Pipapo, I now must go,

A gut yor alemen,

Subject: Pi pa po and u va!

My hearty thanks and appreciation to Berel Leiser for his posting, "Pi,
Pa, Po" (6.067). He created in me a gestalt "aha" reflex regarding
the expression, "u va!" whose source I have not been able to uncover
even here in the land of Mendele.  Harriet Beecher Stowe also patchket
around (like Puccini did with Turandot), and to invoke a sense of awe in
her readers, she named her character Little U va!

A year of good health, peace, insight, good friends, and good books, to
all!

Subject: Book on Warsaw uprising

My husband and I are doing some research on members of my husband's
family (the Kolniczanski's) who were involved in the Warsaw uprising. I
am wondering if anyone has any suggestions as to where I might obtain
some information on their activities, particularly a Yiddish book that I
have been told by relatives was available in France during the late 40s
or early 50s. Apparently, the book, whose title and author are unknown
to me, included a chapter on the Kolniczanski family. Another book about
the Jewish Bund that was published in Yiddush by Bernard Goldstein, had
another chapter about them and their slaughterhouse but that book
precedes the uprising. Does anyone know how we might try to locate this
book with such limited information? Thank you!

Subject: Litvinizmen in Yiddish

In a recent post in Mendele Gintis Kaminskas expressed his interest in
obtaining a second-hand copy of the 1970 book in Lithuanian by Haskelis
Lemchenas (Khatzkl Lemkhen) on the influence of the Lithuanian language
on the local Yiddish, or a photocopy of the book.

One source for a photocopy of the book might be YIVO.  Its new,
temporary, address is:  Jewish Scientific Institute YIVO, 555 West 57th
Street, Suite 1100, New York, NY 10019.

Suggest you contact Zachary Baker, librarian, by E-mail at:
BM.YIB@rlg.stanford.edu

May I call the attention of Mr. Kaminskas, and of others interested in
this subject, to Volume I of the collection of articles called _Li'te_
(1950, New York), with many papers about Lithuanian Jewry between both
World Wars (columns 429-472;  each page consists of two columns,
paginated individually).

In this volume there is a comprehensive paper by Yudl Mark with the
title "Undzer Litvisher Yidish" (Our Lithuanian Yiddish).  Section 12 of
this article lists a number of litvinizmen in Yiddish (columns 465 -
470).
