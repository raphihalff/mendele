Sholem Alaykhem, somewhere in Tevye der milkhiger, quotes a Rashi on the
posik in parshes mishpotim (last week's sedre) 'im begapoy yovoy begapoy
yaytsay', 'az men laygt aran a kadokhes nemt men aros a krenk'.

Another one, also in Tevye, in the first part, is when Tevye's horse
breaks down (if that is the right phrase) and he krekhtses, 'ayn
khokhme, ve'ayn aytse ve'ayn tvine keygn a krank ferd'.

Another one in Tevye is the same idea but in reverse. S.A. makes a
gemore out of the yidish saying 'fin a khazerishn ek ken men kan
shtramel nisht makhen'. In S.A.'s 'gemore' it becomes 'mezanavte
dekhazarte loy makhante leshtramalte'.

Subject: Beytsim and Irishmen

The use of beyts as a euphemism for an irishman reminds me of the use of
"der kartofl" in Mexican (pan-Latin-American?) Yiddish as a euphemism
for the pope, derived from the fact that the Spanish words for pope and
potato are homonyms (Pa'pa and pa'pa).  But my impression of this
euphemism is that it's more Yinglish (could I call it Spandish?) than
Yiddish; is the same true of "beyts"?

Yes, there is a song.  We used to have it on a Theodore Bikel record
when I was growing up (early 60s). All I can remember of the lyrics is
this: The happy father urging everyone to join the dance to celebrate
the marriage of the youngest daughter, and his disbelief at same  --
(and forgive transcription errors of an illiterate).

Hekher, besser,
Di rod, di rod makh greser --
Oy, oy, oy Ich aleyn
Hob nit mayne oygen gezen
Di mezinke oys gegebn!

I learned this one about the same time I learned "Blowin' in the Wind."

Subject: Mezinke

In Mendele 6.223 there is a posting from Fay Lipshitz about a Jerusalem
custom connected with the marriage of the youngest child in the family.
In the posting, as it appears in the list, it says that the child is
known as the "mezinikl" but I happen to know (I'm Fay Lipshitz's
husband) that in her original message she spelled the word "mezhinikl".
She did so because her haredi informant pronounced the second consonant
of the word not as a "z" but rather as that sound which is represented
in Yiddish by the letter combination zayin shin (it is a sound which I
think is absent from English except, perhaps, in words recently imported
from other languages). It seems that the spelling was altered by the
shames.

I at first imagined that the word "mezhinikl" was a dialect variant of
the Yiddish word "mizinik" (or "mezinik"): "a youngest child". The
shames apparently drew a similar conclusion. That would be perfectly
consistent with the context of the Jerusalem custom mentioned by Fay.
However in some amateur research with the aid of a Polish dictionary (I
don't know Polish or any other Slavic language) I came accross the word
"mezniec" meaning "to become an adult" (there are several other Polish
words from the same root with related meanings). A Polish native speaker
has confirmed for me that the second consonant in "mezniec" is
pronounced with the "zh" sound, and that could explain the "zh" in
"mezhinikl". If "mezhinikl" means "somebody who has become an adult"
then that is also consistent with the Jerusalem custom, though perhaps
slightly less so.

I should like to ask those Mendele participants who know about Yiddish
etymology and dialectology (1) Has anybody else come accross "mezhinikl"
(with the "zh" consonant)? (2) Are the words "mizinik" and "mezhinikl"
two different words in Yiddish (two different lexemes is, I think, the
techical way of putting that) or are they variants of the same Yiddish
word? (3) Are the Yiddish words "mizinik" and/or "mezhinikl"  cognates
of the Polish word "mezniec" (perhaps they have quite another Slavic
etymology)?

Subject: Mendele's pseudonym

Ken Frieden in his informative and engaging book, _Classic Yiddish Fiction_
(Suny Press,  State University Plaza, Albany, N.Y. 12246, 1995, 364pp
ISBN  0-7914-2601-7) states that there exists an abundance of  writings
about the persona of Mendele the Bookseller (Mendele Moykher Sforim),
"sometimes erroneously called Abramovitsh's pseudonym" because
Abramovitsh, he relates, was itself a fictitious name.

His father's name was Chaim Moyshe Broyde. It then goes without saying
that Mendele would have been called Sholem Yankev Broyde, but name
changes were then an artful dodge among Jews, to avoid a 25 year
military stint in the Czar's army. One creative subterfuge was to pose
as an eldest son (who was exempt from the military) of a fictitious
family. Sholem Yankev may have thus arrived at the name Abramovitsh, to
be exempt.

A second possibility Frieden proposes is that, after his father's death,
Sholem Yankev traveled extensively with a beggar named Abraham (or
Avreml) Khromoy,  who had  returned from faraway places  with wonderful
adventurous tales of lands flowing with milk and honey. Seventeen-year-
old Sholem Yankev, imaginative and restless, decided to join his role
model, Avreml, and wandered about the world with him. These travels
broadened his horizons and increased his youthful devotion to Abraham,
motivating him to take Abramovitsh as his name.

Avreml's makeshift horse-drawn cart later appeared in the fictional
renditions of Mendele the Bookseller's wagon, and he became the source
fro the character of Fishke der krumer.
