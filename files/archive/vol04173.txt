Subject: Speculations on 'petshke'

Re Mottel Lakin's speculations on the Slavic source if any for 'petshke'.
Rather than look for a semantic connection with 'pech' 'stove' or the
more farfetched [my choice for the most Yiddish sounding English word, by
the way] 'pechal'' 'grief', I would suggest the diminutive name "Pet'ka",
i.e., "little Peter".  The semantics are obvious. 8-)

Subject: Unter Dayne Vayse Shtern, yet another recording

i was avoiding mentioning this out of guilt for not having sent rick the
tapes i promised a year ago, but his mention of sarah gorby's recording
of _s'dremlen feygl oyf di tsvaygn_ impels me to mention that sarah gorby
ALSO recorded _unter dayne vayse shtern_, with a slightly different tune
from the usual one. on her record, the music is attributed to a 'b.
faier'--don't know if that's who the usual one is attributed to. one
funny thing: the gorby record was produced in argentina and the yiddish
titles are translated into spanish. here's a little crosslinguistic
puzzle for all the mendelniks--and a special treat for senor rick:

unter dayne vayse shtern. (tu frente)

give up? ok, _tu frente_ is 'your forehead'. i guess they looked up the
wrong _shtern_... :)

Subject: Re: Unter Dayne Vayse Shtern

"Unter Dayne Vayse Shtern" was recorded by Adrienne Cooper on "Partisans
of Vilna: Songs of World War II Jewish Resistance" featuring her, Michael
Alpert, Josh Waletsky, Irena Klepfisz and myself, among others.  I'm
proud of it because it was co-produced by Josh Waletsky and myself and
because it is the only Yiddish record ever nominated for a Grammy. It is
available on CD or cassette through Living Traditions.

Subject: Romanization

My only reaction to the otherwise helpful article on romanization is that
the issue of romanizing Hebrew words in a Yiddish context has not been
addressed fully enough. Those of us in the library world are aware of the
dictum of LC which I shall quote from Paul Maher's "Hebraica Cataloging"
(p. 22): "Questions do arise however, regard- ing the vocalization of
Hebrew words in a Yiddish context. For this Weinreich's 'Modern
English-Yiddish, Yiddish-English Dictionary' is followed. This applies
for the most part to vowels, not to conso- nants."   What about the large
number of Hebrew words that does not appear in Weinreich and that can
appear in a Yiddish context?  I think the de facto LC practice is to
romanize according to the Hebrew vocalization, and, thus you would get
the anomalous situation of two or more Hebrew words used in a Yiddish
context, one being romanized according to the LC-Weinreich rule and the
others being romanized according to Hebrew.  This is strange and looks
bad in context. A tenable resolution of this issue is certainly called
for.

Subject: YIVO library to reopen

We are pleased to announce that the YIVO Library will be reopening on
Monday, November 14, 1994.  Library hours will be:  9:30 to 5:30,
Monday-Thursday (CLOSED Fridays, weekends, Jewish and civil holidays).
The reading room, which will be shared by the YIVO Library and Archives,
is located at 555 West 57th Street, on the 11th Floor.  The Archives will
be reopening soon after the Library; please call ahead for an
appointment.  (YIVO's new telephone number: 212/246-6080.)

As at our previous location, books must be requested from the reference
librarian, and they may be used only in the reading room. A self-service
photocopy machine ($0.25/copy) and microfilm reader- printer ($0.35/copy)
will be available for your convenience.  The YIVO Library reserves the
right to decline permission to photocopy materials that are in
deteriorating condition.

The reference collection, the main book sequence, and several small
collections are housed at 555 West 57th Street -- i.e., about 100,000 out
of 350,000 total volumes.  Major portions of the YIVO Library are not
located on premises and are not readily accessible.  These include:

     -- The Vilna rabbinics collection.
     -- All newspapers and periodicals.
     -- Published materials in the Bund collection.

Because of this, restrictions will apply to the retrieval of items in
storage.  For example:

     -- Microfilms must be used for library materials that are in
     storage.
     -- For other periodicals, readers will normally be referred to
     other New York-area libraries that have extensive holdings.

We plan to institute a courier service for once-daily retrieval of
materials located in the warehouse.  (This will be coordinated with the
YIVO Archives, and pending its activation we regret that materials in
storage will not be retrievable.)  Our Interlibrary Loan service will be
resumed as of December 1, 1994, and will be limited to lending of
microfilms and filling of photocopy requests.

The good news is that the entire YIVO Library and Archives are on
shelves, and cataloged portions are in their proper sequences. We hope
that you will bear with us during the coming two years, as we renovate
the building to which we will be moving, at 15 West 16th Street.  As
announced previously, YIVO expects to share quarters there with the
American Jewish Historical Society, the Leo Baeck Institute, and the
Yeshiva University Museum.  The planned complex has been given the
tentative name of "Center for Jewish History."
