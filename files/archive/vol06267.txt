Regarding "farkukn zikh" (not so much the phrase as the belief) see
Tractate Bava Metsia (chapter 7 - Hasokher et hapoalim) - where Rabbi
Yohanan, who is decribed as being very beautiful, "would go and sit at
the gates of the ritual bath. He said "When the daughters of Israel
come up from their obligatory immersion, let them meet me, so that
they may have many beautiful sons like me, students of the Torah like
me." (Steinsaltz's translation - sorry no Yiddish gemore handy).

Subject: Farkukn zikh

The shames has asked a most interesting question with regard to
farkukn zikh. The idea that what a pregnant woman looked at could be
transmttied to her unborn child is ancient and goes back not just to
the Hebrews of biblical times but can be found among all nations. It
is called the doctrine of maternal impressions. There is a story that
Hippocrates saved an Athenian princess from charges of adultery by
claiming that her child was black, not because of the mother's
infidelity, but because she had the picture of an Ethiopian in her
bedchamber. Paracelsus said that "women's imagination resembles divine
power; its external desires imprint themselves on the child." Pregnant
women who watched executions were thought to deliver children with the
marks of torture or hanging on their bodies. I could quote many other
examples, but this would lead away from Mendele.

Much as I appreciated Noyekh's learned allusion to Tana"kh [6,265:7],
it seems to me that folk beliefs to the effect that sights seen by
pregnant women have an effect on their children's future character,
physiognomy etc. are fairly widespread. Where the etymology of this
particular expression is concerned, however, I think that we may be
dealing with a piece of phraseology whose Germanic appearance is no
more than skin-deep and which turns out, as is so often the case, to
be a Slavic calque. German 'vergucken sich in jemanden' means 'fall in
love with', 'have a crush on', which is somewhat remote from the
concept we have in mind. On the other hand Ukrainian 'zadyvytysya na
kogo' [the literal equivalent] means not only to 'gape at', but also
'to take someone as an example' which is getting a lot closer.

Subject: Der Amerikaner

Diana Wilner asked about Der Amerikaner magazine [6.265]. The edition
was started in October 1904 and first 23 volumes (1904-1925) were
published under the title "Der Amerikaner". Volumes 24-26 carried the
title "Der Amerikaner un froyen magazin". The last issue (v. 26, no.
24) dated April 27, 1928. Library of Congress microfilmed the journal,
films should be available through the interlibrary loan.

Subject: Der Amerikaner

If the "Amerikaner" which Diana Wilner writes about is the same one I
have come across during my research on Yiddish-American radio, it was
quite an unusual paper. It seems to have been published in Brooklyn
from era right before WW1 sometime into the Depression.

The weekly seemed to have gone through several name changes but in its
earliest incarnation it was called _Der Amerikaner Froyen Zhurnal un
Kompanyon_ and appears to have been a bizarre blend of homey Talmudic
tales, the sedre of the week and hunky sports beefcake photos! The
paper also featured one panel cartoons which look like they may have
been lifted from English papers with the captions translated into
Yiddish.

By the late 1920s they dropped the "froyen zhurnal un kompanyon" from
the title (and sadly, the beefcake photos) and with it the ecumenical
tone and changed the name to _Der Amerikaner Familyen Magazin un
Zhurnal_ . At this point they featured more cultural items such as
fiction, poetry and news of the Yiddish theater and radio. In 1929-31
they sponsored a weekly Yiddish variety show on New York stations WOV
and then WEVD,  featuring such artists Maurice Schwartz Molly Picon,
and dramatist Louis Freiman. After WEVD was obtained by the Foward
association, the "Amerikaner" program was taken off the air (with the
"Forward Hour" taking its Sunday 11:00 AM slot.) I don't know when the
_Amerikaner_ went under though I assume it may have not been long
after the show went off the air.

If you are interested, there is a run of the _Amerikaner_ on microfilm
at the Jewish Division of the 42nd Street Library in Manhattan.

About Diana Wilner's question re: Der Amerikaner (6,265):

This information pertains to 1907 to 1913 (at least) for sure when
Sholem Aleichem sent pieces to Der Amerikaner and Morgn Zhurnal.
Whether it applies to the 1920s and '30s I can't be sure.
Encyclopedia Judaica may have more up to date information

Yakov Sapirshteyn (Jacob Saphirstein in Encyclopedia Judaica),
orthodox and conservative, was publisher of the New York paper Der
Morgn Zhurnal and its weekly family supplement, Der Amerikaner.

Incidentally, This paper should not be confused with Der Yidisher
Amerikaner, published by William Randolph Hearst for a short time to
support his candidacy for Governor of New York in 1906.
