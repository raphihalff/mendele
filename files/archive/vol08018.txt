Subject: a shanda und a kharpe ; a shande und a bisheh

As a student in the Peretz Shule in Montreal in the late fifties, Lehrer
Shtern would occasionally call upon me to iberteich a few sentences in the
T'nakh from Hebrew to Yiddish. Never a scholar in any language, I would plod
my way through a line or two. Usually, Lehrer Shtern would look to dei himlen
and mutter, " A shanda und a kharpe, a yiddisher bokher zol redden Yiddish
mit a goyeshin kop."  If my iberteichen was particularly poor, his mutterings
would include, "A shanda und a bisheh!"  Almost 40 years later, I ask for an
explanation and a comparison of two expressions which still bring back fond
memories.

Subject: "khorbene"

Feivel Halpern writes: "I recall hearing " a khorbene shanda", which refers
to a "khorben", the Hebrew word for "sacrifice"".

Not likely that "khorbene" is derived from "korban=sacrifice". A better guess
is "hurban (het resh bet nun)=destruction"

Subject: Yiddish Goes West

Choices to attend a Yiddish conference, seminar or institute, only a few
years ago, was very limited. Mendele's list has grown from a small number,
and as the year 2000 approaches, having our numbers match that of 2 millennia
is a real possibility. This growth has been true not only in the U.S., but in
Canada, Eastern Europe, and Israel as well. Each gathering has specialties to
attract attendees from afar. 

Earlier this year we read about Yiddish Goes West. It is the first time that
The International Association of Yiddish Clubs will be having its Conference
on the West Coast. It is the first time that this area will showcase the very
best of the West with favorite presenters from Canada and the East. 

From August 27-30, this summer, the beautiful Conference Center on the campus
of UCLA will be the site of this Conference You will be able to select 8
seminars/workshops from among this group and presented by 30 specialists.

Subject: Yiddish names

Rella Cohn's University of Chicago doctoral dissertation, completed four or
five years ago, is on Yiddish names: their various forms, nicknames, etc.,
and their etymologies.  If I remember correctly, it lists all Yiddish names
known to have been used within the last couple of hundred years, both rare
and common ones.  I have a copy, though not at hand right now; if anyone's
interested, I can supply the title, date, etc.

Subject: Yiddish via e-mail

I am pretty excited about a way of sending and receiving e-mail in real
Yiddish.  It was Noyekh Miller who pointed me in the right direction, and it
is all made possible by that wonderful Yiddish Typewriter which Refoyl Finkl
has on the Web.  Here is how it works: 

(1)  Access the Yiddish Typewriter on the Web.
(2)  Type your message in transcription.
(3)  Choose PDF as the transcriber.  Save the message on your hard disk.
(4)  Open up the message with Adobe Reader, and save in the Adobe file as PDF.
(5)  Send the message as an attachment.
(6)  The recipient opens the message with his Adobe Reader.

I know this may sound complicated, but it is really quite straightforward
once you get the hang of it.  Since the Adobe Reader can be downloaded from
the Web for free, and access to the Yiddish Typewriter is also free, there is
no reason for not being able to carry out this communication in Yiddish. 

I have sent a short Yiddish message to Yankl Halpern in Japan, and to Leybl
Botwinik in Israel using this procedure.  Both of them were able to read it
with no difficulty.  So anybody and everybody can correspond in Yiddish no
matter where in the world they are!

Subject: izn iz er...

In response to Mikhl Herzog and Serge Mitelman (and _pace_ Elke Falkovich),
there's no real evidence that I know of that you ever get a real infinitive
in first position. The cases where it *appears* that you do, e.g. _Tantsn,
tants ikh nit_, are simply cases where the verb is regular and where the
infinitive = stem + (e)n. And in fact this description -- stem + (e)n -- can
account not only for the regular verbs but also all the irregular ones, e.g.
_Veysn, veys ikh gornit_, _Veln, vel ikh nit_... 

True enough, in *writing* one finds genuine irregular infinitives, e.g. 
_Zayn, iz er a kabtsn_ -- but this could be a self-conscious hypercorrection
as it does not appear to occur in spontaneous discourse. 

Moreover, I had a wonderful exchange with a Yiddish speaker who was a Central
Yiddish speaker (Karpato-Rus). I gave him a bunch of simple sentences like
_Ikh zing nit_ and asked him to change them into the _Zingen zing ikh nit_
form. In the middle of the lot, I gave him _Ikh hob gornit_. And he instantly
replied, _Hobn [hobn] hob ikh gornit [gurnisht]_. Note the form [hobn] --
speakers of this dialect categorically have [o] in the forms of the present
tense [hob, host, hot, hobn, hot, hobn] but equally categorically pronounce
the *infinitive* as [hubn], e.g. Zolst du nakhes hobn fun dayne kinder =
[zolsti nakhes hubn fin da:ne kinde(r)]. Ok, so I asked him to repeat it and
he did and finally I asked him whether it would also be ok to say '[hubn] hob
ikh gornisht', i.e. with the genuine CY infinitive. He pondered it a few
moments and then replied, 'Neyn, that sentence you have to say like a
Litvak.' :-) 

Therefore I conclude that, in the grammar in at least one Yiddish speaker's
head, sentences of the form _Zingen zing ikh nit_ do *not* involve genuine
infinitives but rather a copy of the stem of the finite verb in the clause
with the infinitive ending added -- which of course is identical to the
genuine infinitive in the case of regular verbs but which is quite different
with the irregular ones. 

As for the origin, there's the possible source in Hebrew, which Mikhl noted.
However, there is also a not-too-different construction in Swedish, where the
finite verb phrase is fronted and a finite pro-verb is left in its original
site (e.g. _La"ser boken go"r han nu_ 'Reads the-book does he now'). While
not too similar in appearance, the Swedish and Yiddish cases are quite
similar structurally, since both seem to involve copying a finite verb into
initial position -- Swedish copying the whole thing and Yiddish copying
merely its stem and adding the ending of the infinitive.  (And both are
killers, for the same reasons, for most current syntactic theories!) If
anyone's interested, there's a 1988 paper by Gunnel Ka"llgren and me
comparing the Yiddish and Swedish constructions that's downloadable from my
Web page (http://babel.ling.upenn.edu/~ellen/home.html). 

Also, I must add that the West African language Kru has something almost
identical to the Yiddish form! -- but I don't claim any influence in either
direction. ;)

Subject: Ganef

All this discussion about "ganef" reminds me of something that I saw (over
twenty years ago) in a Swiss-language weekly newspaper published in Zurich.
(Swiss German is rarely written, so this newspaper is itself an oddity).
There was a headline about a robbery in which the thieves were referred to as
"ganovim" (sic!). Using the Hebrew plural as in proper Yiddish makes it
crystal clear how this word got into Zuercherdeutsch.

Subject: mezuze

In Mendele 08.011, A. M. Ramer asks about an Eastern Yiddish usage of
"mezuze" as "a girl who is too free with her favors", stating that there is
such a usage in Western Yiddish dialects. I am a bit puzzled about that and
would appreciate any reference to an entry of "mezuze" with this meaning in a
Yiddish dictionary. 
 
So far as I know, "mezuze" is used in Yiddish only in its original meaning. 
However, the word has been adopted into Rotwelsch, the secret vocabulary of
German speaking thieves and fences (dating from the 19th). Salcia Landman
writes in her _Jiddisch: Das Abenteuer einer Sprache_ (Frankfurt/M: Ullstein,
1988): "Mesuse: (Im Jid. ausschliesslich gebraeuchlich fuer die kleine Kapsel
mit dem Ausschnitt aus dem Deuteronomium [...]" [Mezuze: (In Yid. only used
for the small capsula with the extract from Deuteronomy];  and cf. as well
Siegmund A. Wolf's _Woerterbuch des Rotwelschen. Deutsche Gaunersprache_
(Mannheim: Bibliographisches Institut, 1956), word no. 3573, where he gives
Yid., meaning only the 'capsula', as the source for Rotwelsch.  Like many
borrowings from Yiddish (Rotwelsch consists only of borrowings, mainly from
Yiddish, German dialects and Romani-languages), "mezuze" has undergone a
ridiculing (blasphemous) change in meaning. Some (if not many)
Rotwelsch-terms have then been adopted into colloquial German (the secret
terms had only a short life as such, for as soon as they had been decoded,
they were of no use to the criminals any more; but, especially as complex
idioms and phrases, they could be and have been an enrichment for modern
German). 
 
Unfortunately, the ethymology you encounter mostly for the now-German words
is unjust towards Yiddish: It acknowledges the Yiddish origin of the `word',
but implies the (corrupted, ridiculing) Rotwelsch-meaning into it, thus doing
great harm to the reputation of Yiddish with many Germanisten. 
 
To the second question: According to Landman (op cit), you first touch the
mezuze and then the lips.
