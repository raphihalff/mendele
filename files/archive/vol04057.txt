Subject: Die sieben "atas"

Has anyone ever heard of a ditty, entitled "die sieben atas?" The word
"atah" refers to the Hebrew word "Atoh" for "you." The song refers to
seven times in the various liturgies where a paragraph begins with the
word "atoh"--for example, "atoh chonen," "atoh yotzarto", etc.I believe
the vocalist uses various tunes to correspond to the various holidays or
occasions when the prayers are offered.

Subject: The Yiddish Voice

I hope that the producers of The Yiddish Voice plan to make tapes
available.  I suspect there will be a substantial audience, myself
included.

Subject: Cholent/tsolent

Thanks for all the people who replied to my question about cholent in
Litvak yiddish. You're right, it probably is a better way to
transliterate what my folks say as tsolent rather than solent. I guess i
didn't do this because the way my folks say it the "s" part of the ts is
more dominant than it is in say Tsaddik. In Tzaddik there is more of a
plosive at the beginning, whereas the ts in tsolent is more sibulant
somehow (if this makes any sense at all), but now that I think about it
there is a "t" sound under the s.

Anyhow, it is good to know that it is a real dialect, although I don't
know that I will ever be able to use it, it is too engrained in me that
it is "wrong", which is a shame I suppose.

Subject: Echad me Yodea

Thanks to all the people who responded to my Echad me yodea question. I
am aware of the other version (although I wouldn't mind a full copy of
the words). I had heard the Theodore Birkel (Sp?) tape (although don't
have the song book) and that version is not too disimilar to the other
version that we sing (we put an oy vey um diti um dum in the first line,
but the tune is pretty much the same).

What I really wanted to know was about the other version I posted. If you
look at it, it really is quite different (the tune is very different too)
and much more fun, because it includes the list of whatever it is that is
being described. As I have never heard it anywhere else (while lots of
people seem to have the Theodore Birkel version), I really wanted to try
and find the full words. It would be a shame if this variant tradition
got lost because nobody could sing it properly.

Subject: Addendum to the Gettysburg Address in Yiddish

The Yiddish translation of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address (Mendele, Vol.
4.054) is longer than the original text with but 19 words. The reason is
that certain Yiddish verbs are periphrastic, that is one part of the verb
remains invariant (constant), without any inflections, and always comes
in combination with an auxiliary verb, such as "zayn" or "hobn" that
changes.  (For example:  in "lib hobn" lib is the invariant verb while
"hobn" changes according to number, tense, etc.)  Thus, in the Yiddish
translation it was at times necessary to use two words instead of one.
In adition it was necessary in some instances to add a preposition, as
well as an article where English does without one.

Subject: Theodore Bikel recordings

After several weeks of observation, I am delighted to be able to
contribute. Chana Luntz began a discussion of words to the Yiddish
version of Ekhad Mi Yodea.  Harvey Spiro (and others) then referred to
the Bikel version.  Harvey metioned that the recordings were long
out-of-print.  Fortunately, some of them have been reissued on CD!  They
are now on the Bainbridge label.

1.  Sings Jewish Folk Songs  BCD-2507
2.  Sings Yiddish Theatre & Folk Songs  BCD 2504
3.  Songs of a Russian Gypsy  BCD 2506

I am under the impression that Bainbridge has released another disc or is
planning to do so soon.

My interest in Yiddish began when I first heard these songs, two years
ago. I am pleased to pass this information along.

Subject: Yiddish Textbooks

As I mentioned in a recent posting, my interest in Yiddish began when I
heard the music of Theodore Bikel.  While my grandparents spoke Yiddish,
I didn't know them very well.  I certainly had no opportunity to learn
from them.

Now, I am trying to teach myself.  I speak Dutch fluently and, as such,
can understand a lot.  I would like to find a good textbook.  If anyone
out there in Mendlespace has some suggestions (along with publishers,
etc.), I would really like to hear them.

Subject: Jewess...Apology for error and addendum

Before others correct me, there is/was the term 'pantheress' in English;
and Walpole is cited for artistess in 1773.  So much for any knowledge
offered without checking the OED!  Having now done so, an interesting
pattern emerges.  OED credits the source of both 'Jew' and 'Jewess' to
OLD French: juiue, juise.  The dates of English usage examples go back to
the 13th century for 'Jew' 14th for 'Jewess'.  OED traces 'Negress' to
"modern" French 'negr`esse'.  Similarly, the various terms for women of
standing: baroness, countess, duchess, empress, hostess, marquisess,
mistress, princess all derive from OF or French in one instance.

In the case of feline animals, the same pattern obtains: the ones that
have 'ess' forms come from OF or F, the ones that don't have it come from
other languages.  The OED tells us under 'ess' that this came from OF,
was originally 'esse' and by the 15th century had become so common as a
feminine ending that it was generally used to replace the older English
'(e)ster' which lost its feminine meaning except in 'spinster'; it was
then added to previously ungendered English words as well to form
feminines (e.g., dwelleress, seeress).

OED gives numerous examples of usages, including one that might raise
even more hackles -- "Hebrewess."  When or where has one last seen this?
Can one imagine this in the Forward!

Despite an apparently "innocent" linguistic origin, none-the-less, the
connotations attached to usage over time and in specific social contexts
is another matter.  But for the form we can blame it on the French, i.e.,
the Norman conquerors.
