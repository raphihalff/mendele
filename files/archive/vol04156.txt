Subject: Introduction

I am Patrick Markowicz, 36, 4 children and live in Metz (France) near the
Belgian, German, and Luxemburger border.

I show issues of MENDELE to my father Benjamin (71 years, born in
Sosnowiec, Poland).

He doesn't understand very much computers and internet but he would like
to know if someone could send us by e-mail funny stories or funny books
in yiddish.

Thank you very much in advance.

register,thus ( but keeping the first two lines) af yidish

Subject: Rote brik

Dakht zich a rote brik iz a shpielvertl. It's either a red brik (English
brick) oder a roiter brik (red bridge). Don't know what the hilarity is
about.

Yes, mayn leib, there IS Yiddishkayt in Estonia!  I refer you to a
classmate of mine at Bar Ilan University.  Please write to Anna Verschik:

To Sore Benor:

When I spent a week in Tallinn, Estonia a few years ago, there were Jews in
the city of Tallinn, Estonia. I don't have any names and addresses here, but
I think the National Yiddish Book Center has been in touch with them, in
addition to Jews in Lithuania and Latvia.

Subject: Beruriya, Learned Wife of Meyir bal ha'nes

Further to my note on Meyir bal ha'nes (4.150,2):  The famous Yiddish
writer Dovid Pinski wrote a story about Beruriya, the wife of Meyir bal
ha'nes.  It is included in his book _Beruriya un Andere Dertseylungen_
(Warsaw, 1938).  In addition to the Beruriya story, the following three
stories are also on historical themes  (Yoykhonon Koyhen Godl, Di
Nisyoynes fun Rebe Akive, un Zrubovel).

Beruriya was the daughter of a great scholar, unusually gifted and a
scholar in her own right.  In a number of passages the Talmud cites her
sayings, and refers to her wisdom in learning.

Meyir bal ha'nes was wont to call her _"home"_out of respect  and
gratitude for creating a home for himself and their two children.

One shabes an extraordinary, unaccountable misfortune befell their
household--both children suddenly died.

Her husband was, of course, in besmedresh, for shabes services, learning,
and teaching.  Not wishing to dim his shabes joy and light, Beruriya kept
from him the tragic news until he came home in the evening.

The story goes that she then said to him:  "Rabbi,  some time ago a
certain one entrusted two jewels to keep for him, and now he asks them
back. Must I return them to him?"

Meyir bal ha'nes replied:  "Would you hesitate to give anyone back his
own?"

Thereupon she broke the heart-rending news to him.

The story suggests Beruriya's nature and character of dignity and
nobility.

Subject: Rish

Bob Werman asked (4.152) about an animal called _rish_.  It's presumably
a lynx, judging by Polish _rys'_.

Subject: rish/lynx/rys

rwerman@vms.huji.ac.il asks:

> Rish?  A wildcat?  A tiger?

"ry\'s" - with an acute accent on "s" - is Polish for "lynx".  The
pronunciation suggested by the spelling "rish" is a reasonable
approximation of the Polish pronunciation.

Subject: Rish - Tiger

For Bob Werman:

Rys' is Slavic for Lynx. In the late 15th c. Jewish translation into
Belorussian, the expression "meharrey nemeyrim" in Song of Songs 4:8 is
rendered: ot hor rys'ix.
