yankel, yeinkiv has been taken to be a sephardic ayin,
other sephardiisms are supposed to be ashenazik yad=hand
where yod would be expected and some other cases-- but
ashkenazic ayin does strange things, young women= neireh,
plural "neires"-- like meile, meiles-- a quality, my crowd
goes in the opposite direction also-- not dreitsin-- but
drahtsin, fahrtsin -- etc. ,  and while were on
pronunciations my uncle zeydel could never begin with a
vowel -- a yid was always a "heed" etc.  and he definitely
said shufki, this was no yinglish.--

WRT khali and other such pronunciations, first some facts,
then some speculation:

The pattern is anglicization of Yiddish final -e differs in
different regions. "Bubbie" and "Zeydie" are pretty much
universal (in the US), but here I think we probably have
convergence with English diminutives in -y, like mommy and
daddy. In Buffalo, where I grew up, I don't recall hearing
_any_ other Y words pronounced in English with final "-ie".

In Boston (and Eastern Mass. in general), on the other
hand, many words are pronounced this way, including
"matsie", which Ellen cites as _not_ having this
pronunciation in her dialect. I've even heard "chepie"
("Don't chepie me" = "tshepe mikh nisht")!!

Ok, now speculation. Mike Alpert, who grew up in the Boston
suburbs, commented on this to me once. Summarizing with a
linguist's terminology, he says that in Litvishe dialects
final -e is higher and more front than in most other Y
dialect areas (this sounded convincing when he
demonstrated). And he claims that the Boston area has a
high proportion of Litvaks. So the idea would be that the
litvish pronunciation of -e crosses some perceptual
boundary for English speakers, such that it gets perceived
as "ie" rather than the "uh" that -e otherwise gets
anglicized as. In places where the proportion of Litvaks is
high enough, this could influence the local patterns of
anglicization, even for speakers not of litvish background.
(And vice versa.)

And the puzzling word by word distribution could result
from anglicized pronunciations being borrowed from
neighborhood to neighborhood.

BUT I don't know how many of the premisses of this
explanation hold up.

"maanse" and "maynse" are very common pronunciations,
especially, I think, in SE (Ukrainian) Yiddish. As Mikhl
points out, the example of this phenomenon that everyone
knows is "Yankev". But it doesn't have to be around an
ayin, others of the Hebrew "guttural" consonants will do:
bansher <ba'Asher (with an aleph), yandes < yahAduth (with
a he). This only happens when the consonant is followed by
a "hateph" vowel (if you know your Dikduk).

Max Weinreich, I believe, gives an explanation along these
lines: Suppose these combinations got contracted to long
vowels very early, before the Ashkenazim moved to Ashkenaz.
At that point the every day language would have been a
romance language; suppose it was some variety of Old French
that had long nasal vowels, but no other long vowels. Then
these long vowels in loshn koydesh words might have been
nativized by nasalizing them: Ya~kov, etc. Later, when the
common language shifted to germanic Old Yiddish, with no
nasal vowels, these pronunciations could be nativized
again, to Yankev, etc.

To me this seems to have a lot of "if"s in it. Maybe it all
holds up if you know enough about the early history, but I
don't. In any case, I haven't heard any other explanation
that holds up at all.
