Subject: News from Shtetl

Shura Vaisman who assumed a formidable role of Shtetl's baleboste when her
promiscuous husband started an unplanned affair with Mendele several months
ago, invites all Mendelyaner to the recently built and remodelled corners of
Shtetl (http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/shtetl.html). 

The khanike party will take place in the Shtetl's kitchen that has been
completely renovated (http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/kikh). According to the
well-informed sources, Shura's excellense in an authentic _Yiddish_ cuisine is
unmatched in the Western hemisphere. In the new kitchen Shura shares her
cherished recipes of latkes, varnichkes, kreplakh, gefilte fish, kugl, tsimes,
etc., etc. Even those who are interested exclusively in the spiritual food
will find something interesting in the kitchen: all recipes are richly spiced
with the appropriate shprikhverter from the Ignats Bernshtein's and other
collections.  Please stop and taste: es lost zikh esn! The kitchen also
equiped with the doors to many other Yiddish food sites.

Shtetl's song collection was complemented by the "Afn pripetshik" set of pages
(http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/songs/pripetshek). There you can read the text
in Yiddish and two transliterations (Southeastern and Northern dialects), see
and hear (provided you have a soundcard and audio plug-ins in your Web
browser) three slightly different versions of music played on different
instruments, learn about Mark Warshavsky's other works from the brief article
by Noah Prilutsky. 

I am sure that Mendelyaner would enjoy reading the first online full-text
edition of Zellig Bach's wonderful book "A Child's Longing for Home",
originally published in installments in the New York Times and Forward in
1986-1987, and as a book in 1995 (http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/Book/Bach/).

Those who cannot answer a simple quiz question "What is the connection between
Yiddish and Sacred Heart?" should visit Mame-Loshn'97 page
(http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/ML97). The third Mame-Loshn festival last
Spring was a great success. An article by Lila Zeiger and hundreds of
photographs by Shtetl's own correspondents would bring back memories to those
Mendelyaner who attended the festival and stimulate others to come to
Mame-Loshn'98. Warning: unless you have a relatively fast Internet connection,
be patient with the image-rich Mame-Loshn pages. 

Shtetl provides a new link to _Der Moykher Sforim_ 
(http://members.aol.com/msybooks), an independent, well organized online
bookstore where you can order virtually any book in print about Yiddish or
translated from Yiddish. 

Mendelyaner in need of the YIVO romanization rules should look at the page
based on the discussion in Mendele three years ago
(http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/Translit). 

Those in search of Yiddish maps can visit the bibliography of Yiddish
terminology and subject textbooks page in the Shtetl's library
(http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/Bibliog/term-yi.htm). There you will find
information about the books covering a good deal of the Earth surface: 
"Geografye fun Poyln", "Geografye fun F.S.S.R.", "Geshikhte un geografye fun
Rumenye", "Erets-Yisroel geografye", and even "Kine un Mandzshuryen: 
Mongolyen, Tibet, Koriye".

For questions, comments, critique, and other correspondence (except e-mail
romances) Shura can be reached at avaisman@med.unc.edu.

Subject: Ura far gruppirn temes! Hray fer E.Prince!

While I love to be cheered, I must clarify what my suggestion was. It was not
quite what Martin Horwitz renders it as: "I wish to second heartily Ellen
Prince's very cogent suggestion that all readers of Mendele will gain more
pleasure if the Shamas will be so kind as to group subtopics which receive a
large number of posts which are very similar and do not add mew information
(while taking up down loading time and patience). This is especially true of
topics which may not be of general interest. If not the flood will cause more
and more Mendele readers to sit with one finger on the delete button. And this
would be a pity. I think even those of us with an interest in serious
etymologies would agree."

In particular, I was *not* suggesting that grouping be done only for certain
topics! And I certainly don't know what he has in mind by posts 'which do not
add new information...' The fact is that there probably is NO topic that is of
'general interest' here -- I for one have *zero* interest in literature, in
Yiddish or in any other language, to name just one large target of MY delete
key.

Perhaps a probationary division into 'literature', 'language, 'announcements',
'nostalgia', and 'misc.' would fill the bill. Or perhaps some other -- I don't
care what they are. But I certainly wasn't advocating that we simply segregate
certain topics that *some* people feel are boring. 

Hope I've made myself clear this time around.

Subject: "shiker iz a goy" song   

I was reminded by your chanike oy chanike correspondence of another favorite
song of my grandmother's, shiker iz a goy. (I was also reminded of the song c
40+ years ago - when I worked for the Yale Center on Alcohol Studies, which
was running a comparative study of comparative ethnic drinking behavior, and I
was asked about that song.)  Can anyone (not too fettered by political
correctness) tell me something about the song, give me the words, tell me
where the music can be found, etc

i become more and more convinves that we need to find a way to write with
hebrew letters - how can we talk about hebraic words if one has no picture of
the spelling -- example -- lo b'lharote (that's easy) v'lo'b'd'roeh (nusen
fishman) -- witout the spelling how can one recognize the root of an h/a word?

Subject: Beyde shprakhn?  Logish.

Peter Kluehs taynet (7.127, 7) az oyb me shmuest do vegn yidish zol zayn AF
yidish.  Ikh bin maskem.  Take.  Ober shraybn af beyde shprakhn iz avade

Ershtns: in mayne khaloymes redt men English, a simen az mayne makhshoves

un nisht der iker.  A mer vogike sibe iz di tsveyte. 

Tsveytns: Kemat ale Mendelistn farshteyen English un andere farshteyen nor

talmidim vos viln lernen, vil ikh es ton mit an iberzetsung af English, oder

Nu, un vegn daytshmerizmen.  Daytshmerizmen gefeln mir nisht.  Avade ken men

Un amol leyent men az _fil mentshn viln yidish lernen_.  Klingen, klingt der

andere hern efsher epes andersh. 

Translation: Peter Kluehs argues (7.127, 7) that since here we discuss
Yiddish, it should be _in_ Yiddish.  I agree.  Really.  But writing in both
languages is quite logical.  I write both Yiddish and English for two reasons. 

First: in my dreams people speak English, a sign that my thoughts develop in
English, sometimes as though on wheels.  In Yiddish, they sometimes stumble. 
That is what I have become used to.  That is entirely on my account and not
the main thing.  The second is a more weighty reason. 

Second: most mendelistn understand English and only a few Yiddish words.  If I
am capable of helping young or old students who want to learn, I want to do it
with a translation or simply some ideas in English.  The main thing is
education, for me and for others. 

As to daytshmerisms (Germanizations): I just don't like them.  Of course, they
exist.  They don't ring with the Yiddish lilts, the Yiddish flavors. [Then
come untranslatable examples.] The first example rings more Yiddish in my
ears.  My ears, though, are mine, and others may hear something different.

From: "Sol Steinmetz"<ssteinmetz@randomhouse.com>
Subject: b'lo kharote u'blo d'ro'o

Nusen Fishman wondered in Mendele 07.121 about the meaning of "d'ro'o" 
(spelled daled - reysh - eyin - hey) in the above phrase, used in sholom
aleikhem's story "khaneke gelt." 

The answer is found in Nahum Stutchkoff's "der oytser fun der yidisher
shprakh."  Under the entry for "kharote"  you will find the phrase spelled,
correctly, as "b'li kharote ub'li drey," meaning literally "without regret and
without trickery."  The word "drey" is glossed in both Harkavy's and
Weinreich's dictionaries as a noun meaning "turn, twist" and figuratively,
"trick." The phrase is clearly a Yidish coinage created by analogy with such
phrases as "b'li neder," "b'li sofek," "b'li neder ub'li maskone,"  "b'li eyn
hore," "b'li g'vul."

From: Arnold Kuzmack <kuzmack@cpcug.org>
Subject: Booze; hekdesh

(1)  Booze: Dan Gilman asks about the origins of mashke, bronfn, and
yayten-soref.  Mashke and yayin-soref are straight Hebrew: mashke is any hard
drink and yayin-soref is burnt wine, i.e., brandy (cf. German Branntwein). 
Bronfn is derived from Branntwein, as well, as Mikhl Herzog points out.

Mikhl asks whether there is any distinction in English between liquor and
whiskey.  While somewhat off-topic, the answer is yes.  Liquor refers to any
distilled alcoholic beverage, including those distilled from grain, from wine
(brandy), and from other fruit.  Whiskey refers only to those distilled from
grain.  The word "liquor" is also used in non-alcoholic contexts, such as
pickling liquor and chocolate liquor (the stuff from which the cocoa butter is
removed to yield chocolate).  Aren't CD-ROM encyclopedias wonderful! 

Both suggest that all these words are used interchangeably.  My memory of my
grandparents, native speakers of Yiddish, is that they were well aware of the
distinctions among alcoholic beverages and would never confuse, say, Scotch,
brandy, and wishniak.  The word shnaps seemed to cover all of these, though. 
Is there any evidence from literary texts, one way or the other? 

(2) Heqdesh:  I would question many of Sema Chaimovitz Menora's explanations. 

The derivation of kadesh from 'kad esh' seems to be the sort of folk etymology
that is frequent in Hebrew and occurs in religious literature, often with a
homiletic purpose, but has little validity. Semitic three- letter roots do not
work this way. 

Similarly, the meaning of kadesh as separate is part of the root meaning and
not derived from sacrifices.  The holy is what is separated from day-to-day
life. 

Also, the kadeshah (harlot) was so called not because she was separate from
society but because she was engaged in holy activities as part of the cult of
the Canaanite peoples. 

Finally, I suspect that the hekdesh as poorhouse got its name not from being a
separate place for the poor but because taking care of the poor is a religious
duty. 

B'sholem,
Arnie Kuzmack
