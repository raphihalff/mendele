Subject: Fayvish

[As shames of these pages, I'm disappointed at the
seeming lack of interest in Mikhl Herzog's question:
what well-known English word is derived from borekhAbe? 
This will not do, my friends: lovers of the language as
I know you to be--and mayvinim to boot--there should
have been a flood of answers. Nu, meyle, maybe you were
all on vacation.  So the game is still open.]

Ot dos iz di kashe mayne:

Fayvish.  First of all, following Harkavy and Even-
Shoshan,  I assume that it and Faybush (as well as
Fayvel) are  the same.  I've also always assumed that
the name is derived from Phoebus Apollo.  In fact I've 
used it for years as an example of how difficult it is
for people of one period (even when they "share" the
"same" "tradition"--all such words being suspect) to
sort out what went on in another... Ober nisht dos bin
ikh oysn.

Comes Max Weinreich and, completely ignoring this
etymology, asserts that the name is from the Latin
Vivus and is therefore a relexification of Chaim.  

Now this may have the unintended effect of making
Fayvish more acceptable among those who are put off by
a Jew named for a Greek god.  Ober epes klingt es
nisht, it doesn't ring true, because all the Fayvishes
I've known (2) and the Americam Philips (a half-dozen
at least) get themselves called to the Torah by the
singular 'Jewish' name of Shrage; and Shrage as Even-
Shoshan and every other authority will tell you is the
Aramaic for light.  Not a Chaim in a carload.  But
Weinreich, who surely knew this, pays no attention. 
Instead, in a brief note, he agrees that Shrage means
light but claims that it's an Aramaic relexification
for Uri (my light).  In brief, while everyone  else
says Fayvish=Phoebus=Shrage, Weinreich says Fayvish=
Vivus=Chaim and Shrage=Uri.

Now I was brought up in the shadow of another Max
(Weber) and just  as I can't imagine criticizing him
lightly I'm leery of saying a krum vort about the other
M.W.  

So who will solve this retenish?

Subject: Isaac Bashevis

Isaac Bashevis is dead.  When Sholem Aleichem died in
1916 the grief was for a friend.  Singer was not so
much a friend (he knew too many of our secrets for
that) as, together with Chaim Grade, our last link. 
We've always lived in the past and now we are the past.
