Subject: davnen

According to Max Weinreich: History of the Yiddish Language (Pg.24) the word
was "doynen" (old Yiddish) before it changed to "davnen". "The grandparents
might still have said /zaver and /doinen/ for zoyer (sour) and davnen (to
pray)."

According to Weinreich, the word "davnen" is of uncertain origin (P.680).
Apparently, Dovid Katz agrees.

A gut yontev un a gut yor!

Subject: zol mir zayn far dir

Mikhoyel Basherives [07.077] and Ellen Prince [07.078] pointed out that Jews
share many customs and superstitions with coterritorial cultures. It is also
interesting, that some other customs seem to be unique or rare.

I beleive that one of the very interesting examples is Jewish parents' desire
to avert real or apparent illnesses, ordeals, and other dangers from their
children by calling those misfortunes upon themselves, in what James Matisoff
(Blessings, curses, hopes, and fears: psycho-ostensive expressions in Yiddish
/ Philadelphia : Institute for the Study of Human Issues, 1979) classifies as
"pro forma auto-malo-petition" (by the way, I think in many cases it is quite
sincere rather than _pro forma_). Two constructions I've heard most are "zol
mir zayn far dir / zol mir zayn far dayne beyner (beyndelekh)" [let me be
affected instead of you]  and "vey iz mir far dir" [woe is me instead of you].

There are no such expressions in Russian and Ukrainian, and it seems that they
don't exist in Hebrew and German. I was not able to find equivalents in other
languages, except Armenian, where it literally translates into "I will take
your pain", and is used in the same context as in Yiddish. I would be grateful
for pointers to the equivalents of "zol mir zayn far dir / vey iz mir far dir"
in other cultures and for information about regional variations/usage in
Yiddish. Does somebody know if similar incantations exist in Ladino?

Subject: Yiddish music 

I don't know the early history of the song "Dona Dona" or whether it existed
before the Yiddish theatre, but it became a folk standard in America in the
early '60s, and it was sung in English at camps and on school buses by
non-Jewish children.  Sholem Secunda is the only Yiddish composer I know
of who had two songs that became well known to the general non-Jewish public,
the other being Bay Mir Bist Du Sheyn, which in 1938 was the biggest hit
record ever up to that time (in English, of course.  The Andrews Sisters).

Subject: "Indianer"

"Indianer" - I have never heard of Indianer meaning turkey (Truthahn,
Truthenne, or Pute(r) in German. In my experience, it has always been used
for the original inhabitants of America. There is a round pastry covered
with chocolate in Austria -- an Indianerkrapfen. I checked my German
dictionaries to follow up and found no mention of any relation between
turkey and Indianer (WAHRIG, DUDEN, LANGENSCHEIDT'S MURET-SANDERS, and
HARRAP). But it sure would make sense, whether in the dictionary or not:-)

Subject: Yiddish music

Here is some some information concerning Loic Audrain's request [07.078]
which I happen to know.

1. To the song "Belts". Alexander Olshanetsky (1895, Odessa - 1946,
Atlantic-City) came in USA in 1925. He wrote music for Jewish theaters and
used to be a treasurer in the Union of the American Jewish Composers.

2. To the song "Dona, Dona". There is a CD: "YANKELE: Chansons yiddish" /
M. Leiser, A. Flammer, G. Barreaux. OPS 30-107. Opus Production, Paris,
1994, where Moyshe Leiser sings it in his modern way.

Subject: Yiddish version of The Nightmare Song from Iolanthe

No sooner did my Yiddish version of Gilbert and Sullivan's Nightmare Song
from the opera IOLANTHE appear in the current issue of The Forward (Oct. 17,
1997 - _Der Yiddish-Vinkl_) than I started receiving phone calls (A) to ask
me to clarify the name of the opera and (B) to request that I publish the rest
of the song. I'd therefore like to share with Mendele readers all corrections,
additions and explanations.

As for the name of the opera - the Forward spelled it totally incorrectly
thusly: _Lolanathe_.  The correct name, as I indicated in the paragraph
above, is IOLANTHE. In regard to the rest of the lyrics, the Forward has them
and may eventually print the entire song.  Non-Mendelyaners will have to wait
for them to do so. To accommodate our own readers please see (below) the
complete original followed by the full Yiddish version.  I must emphasize that
I wrote a Yiddish _version_ rather than a translation.  But in doing so I
labored to adhere faithfully to Gilbert's rhyme scheme and to his meter (seven
metric feet to the line).  While doing so I also had to keep thinking of
Sullivan's music in order to maintain a perfect match of verbal to musical
cadence so that the lyric would conform to the accentuation and rhythm of each
musical phrase.

Finally, I should like to point out that I interpolated this number in my
Yiddish version of The Pirates of Penzance (DI YAM GAZLONIM) at the point
where the Major General finds it hard to get a good night's sleep owing to
his feelings of guilt for having lied to the pirates about his being an
orphan.  The Nightmare Song will be one of the selections at a reading of DI
YAM GAZLONIM presented by Zalmen Mlotek at the January 10th (1998) meeting of
The Gilbert & Sullivan Society of New York, at Cami Hall, 165 West 57th
Street (near 7th Avenue).  Additional information about Mr. Mlotek and this
presentation is at this website:  http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/DYG

NIGHTMARE SONG--LORD CHANCELLOR.  (from Iolanthe)

When you're lying awake with a dismal headache, and repose is  
     taboo'd by anxiety,
I conceive you may use any language you choose to indulge in, 
     without impropriety;
For your brain is on fire--the bedclothes conspire of usual 
     slumber to plunder you:
First your counterpane goes, and uncovers your toes, and your 
     sheet slips demurely from under you;
Then the blanketing tickles--you feel like mixed pickles--so
     terribly sharp is the pricking,
And you're hot, and you're cross, and you tumble and toss till 
     there's nothing 'twixt you and the ticking.
Then the bedclothes all creep to the ground in a heap, and you 
     pick 'em all up in a tangle;
Next your pillow resigns and politely declines to remain at its 
     usual angle!
Well, you get some repose in the form of a doze, with hot  
     eye-balls and head ever aching.
But your slumbering teems with such horrible dreams that you'd 
     very much better be waking;
For you dream you are crossing the Channel, and tossing about in 
     a steamer from Harwich--
Which is something between a large bathing machine and a very 
     small second-class carriage--
And you're giving a treat (penny ice and cold meat) to a party of
     friends and relations--
They're a ravenous horde--and they all came on board at Sloane 
     Square and South Kensington Stations.
And bound on that journey you find your attorney (who started
     that morning from Devon);
He's a bit undersized, and you don't feel surprised when he tells 
     you he's only eleven.
Well, you're driving like mad with this singular lad (by the by, 
     the ship's now a four-wheeler),
And you're playing round games, and he calls you bad names when 
     you tell him that "ties pay the dealer";
But this you can't stand, so you throw up your hand, and you find 
     you're as cold as an icicle,
In your shirt and your socks (the black silk with gold clocks),
     crossing Salisbury Plain on a bicycle:
And he and the crew are on bicycles too--which they've somehow 
     or other invested in--
And he's telling the tars all the particulars of a company he's 
     interested in--
It's a scheme of devices, to get at low prices all goods from 
     cough mixtures to cables
(Which tickled the sailors), by treating retailers as though they 
     were all vegetables--
You get a good spadesman to plant a small tradesman (first take
     off his boots with a boot-tree),
And his legs will take root, and his fingers will shoot, and 
     they'll blossom and bud like a fruit-tree--
>From the greengrocer tree you get grapes and green pea,
     cauliflower, pineapple, and cranberries,
While the pastrycook plant cherry brandy will grant, apple puffs,
     and three corners, and Banburys--
The shares are a penny, and ever so many are taken by Rothschild 
     and Baring,
And just as a few are allotted to you, you awake with a shudder 
     despairing--
You're a regular wreck, with a crick in your neck, and no wonder you
snore, for your head's on the floor, and you've needles and pins from
your soles to your shins, and your flesh is a-creep, for your left
leg's asleep, and you've cramp in your toes, and a fly on your nose,
and some fluff in your lung, and a feverish tongue, and a thirst
that's intense, and a general sense that you haven't been sleeping in
clover;
But the darkness has passed, and it's daylight at last, and the night
has been long--ditto ditto my song--and thank goodness they're both
of them over!
                               (Lord Chancellor falls exhausted on a seat)

Subject: tum balalayke

Audrain Loic's query about the song "tsum balalayke" [07.078] reminded me of a
conversation I had with my Yiddish prof about this song. I asked him to
explain the question-answer pair 'vos ken vaksen, vaksen on regn --> a sheyn
kan vaksn, vaksn on regn'. [what can grow without rain? A stone can grow
without rain.]  He said that it didn't make much sense to him either, and
that _he_ had,  back in his youth, asked someone to explain this line, and
had been told that it was a 'sexual allusion.' 

Does the collective wisdom of Mendele have any comment on this explaination?

My venerable prof also said that he had seen the song preformed as a
'Russian folk song', without any reference to its Yiddish origin, and had
had a good laugh over it. 

Zayt gezunt!

Subject: dukhenen

Many thanks to Ellen Price for the comprehensive review of superstitious
practices.  I have a few additions:

If I sneezed while someone was talking about something, it was proof that
that was a true statement, usually stated (as best I can remember) as "dos
var es".

In addition to red ribbons on my undershirts, I wore corals around my wrist
or neck to protect me from the evil eye.

The discussions on the derivation of davenen reminded me of another word
that my father used, to refer to the kohanim's blessings during the high
holidays.  Does anyone recognize the word dukhenen, and know what the
derivation might be.

A sheynem dank.
