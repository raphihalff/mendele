Consistent to what region or regions, Mikhl?  Also, do
people who use "ober" for "or" use "oder" for but?  If not,
why does "or" get used in English in place of "but"?

dave - i think dollar comes from 'thaler' - which was a
(germanic?) currency. tat makes the step to 'tuler' a bit
less mysterious.
 
moishe nussen: what kind of yiddish DO you speak? not being
very fluent in the language, unusual (to me) accents can
play havoc with my comprehension. in particular, the two
words below stumped me. also, i understand the words of the
third expression, but not its meaning in your context. can
you help me out?

Subject: folk etymology

Regarding folk-etymology:
 
Ellen Prince writes:
 
 'sparrow grass' is a nonstandard variant of 'asparagus',
which was 'folk-etymologized' into 'sparrow grass'. in case
the problem is the term 'folk etymology', that's when
speakers hypothesize that some word comes from something on
the basis of its sound (or spelling) but are wrong.
 
Mikhl Herzog writes:
 
reydl/redl, the diminutive of rod/rud 'wheel' does NOT come
from a reading of dreydl as di reydl. Rather, the emergence
of reydl as a regional variant of dreydl meaning 'spinning
top' probably DOES come from such a reading; i.e., from a
folk-etymological interpretation of dreydl the sequence "de
reydl".
 
Yugntruf DOES have something to do with ruf (call), but
that says nothing about your assumptions about dreydl,
which certainly SEEMS to derive from the verb dreyen. Check
a German etymological dictionary to see if rod/redl is
similarly related to dreyen. If yes, your "subconscious"
assumptions happen to be well founded. If, no, your
assumptions are evcidence of how folk-etymology works.
 
****************
 
Thoughts on 'how folk etymology works':
 
Twice recently in Mendele, assertions have been made that a
wrong etymology is folk-etymology (per evidence adduced
above). I don't quite understand this.  Let us look at
Herzog's statement. If my "subconscious" assumptions
(regarding the origin of dreydl) are indeed evidence of how
folk-etymology works, then they should be evidence whether
or not they are well-founded. Rather, I would like to
suggest that my hypothesizing is, in fact, closer to
scientific hypothesis generation.  The difference between
this and folk-etymology probably lies in the fact that a
folk-etymology is typically asserted to be true, without
any attempt at testing it.
 
Consistent with my suggestion is the following
characterization of folk-etymology: (if read with stress on
'a tout prix') Vendryes: l'etymologie populaire est une
reaction contre l'arbitraire du signe.  On veut a tout prix
expliquer ce dont la langue est bien incapable de fournir
l'explication.
 
Other viewpoints on folk-etymology:
 
Ramon Anttila defines folk-etymology as a process of
replacing unfamiliar shapes with more familiar ones.  This
would not seem to be true in my case.  dreydl is certainly
not an unfamiliar construct to me, or indeed to anybody on
mendele.  This definition would, however, justify the
classification of sparrowgrass/asparagus as folk-etymology.
 
Except on grounds such as I have suggested, it would seem
difficult to qualitatively distinguish between scientific
hypothesis generation and folk-etymology.  In fact, Orr,
revue de linguistique romane, writes: l'etymologie
populaire ne differe pas essentiellement de sa soeur
savante, l'etymologie des philologues.  Plus vivante, plus
'operative' que cette derniere, elle fait instinctivement,
intuitivement et du premier jet ce que fait l'autre
intentionellement a grand renfort de bouquins et de fiches.
 
In any case, I submit, a hypothesis being wrong cannot make
it an example of folk-etymology.  On the other hand,
perhaps there is some other technical definition of
folk-etymology that would make the uses of Herzog and Ellen
correct.  Comments?

Subject: RE: Mendele Vol 1.129

As Mikhl Herzog requested in Mendele 1.129, I've
retransmitted to him the comments I had made about ayin and
the shift to n or nasalization in Yiddish.  I'll take this
opportunity to mention farn tsiber that the critique of my
suggestion by Arn Abramson (in 1.113) convinces me I was
wrong.  He pointed out that the muscular gestures to
produce an /n/ and a Middle Eastern ayin are quite
different, and that a change from ayin to /n/ in Arabic is
unknown.  So are we back to square one for Yankev, ma:nse?
