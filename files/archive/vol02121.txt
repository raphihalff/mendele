Subject: shikse

Political incorrectness of the word notwithstanding, I'd
like to pass on an observation.  I lived for a number of
years in Germany, in a small village near Mainz.  T
Rheinhessian dialect has (for good reason) many
similarities with Yiddish.  The word "Schikse" is parof the
local jive. . There it means "a woman of slightly loose
morals." I guess it would be about the same as "tsatske."

Subject: o > u

For Mikhl Herzog

No. It is not the usual Heb. a> Yid. o/u. The Hebrew is
besorah, with a khoylem. Which means that we expect
besoyre. Now this one seems to be isolated.

tshak-tshakim

The form is rather tshakh-tshakhim and is intended (or was
intended at the beginning) to mimic  the pronunciation of
Morrocan jews, not distinguishing hissing from hushing
sounds. It could be an arabic word, certainly no Yiddish
connection this time.

Moshe Taube

Subject: Vowel shifts

To Payrets Mett: My grandfather was, of course, called
Mekhl. In some areas, it even goes to Makhl, fem. Makhlye
which, if I'm not mistaken is the source of the matronymic
Machlis. How do you pronounce your first name (which you
spell with ay)?  To rhyme with English "may" or "my"?
 
In any event, I was wrong to suggest Heb. besara, wasn't I?
It's besura, no? And that would surely lead to Yiddish
psure/psire. So where does Moshe Taube's "raising" problem
come in?

Mikhl.

[Debra Halperin Biasca writes:]

>To Ellen Prince, et ux:

>If the term hurts, it must be pejorative.

well, my spouse isn't thrilled with being called 'ux(or)',
but that doesn't mean the term is pejorative...

[The semi-Slavic/semi-Yiddish story about a man giving
testimony in a court: Your honor, this is how it was: my
neighbor, Hersh-Berele, he's got a pair of goats.  Well,
the goats crawled up on my roof and ate it.  So I told him
and he just laughed.  (I suppose the witness was just
trying to get compensation in small claims court which
ironically I failed to do in small-claims court just two
days ago -yet another reason to escape from behind "dem
Oranzhenem Firhang"as I'm sure we'd have won our case in
almost any other county!) {Noyekh, zayt azoy gut un
korigirt dem toes oybn where "Slavik" should read "Slavic."
A groysn dank!}
