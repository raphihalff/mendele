Subject: Levi-yitskhok Caplan

In the 1950's, Levi-Yitskhok ("Tanbo") Kaplan fun Rogotshov, an artist in
Russia, did several series of beautiful prints based on different works of
Yiddish literature. One series, done in 1957, was based on
Sholem-Aleykhem's
Der Farkishefter Shnayder. Each print depicts a scene from a different
chapter of the story, and contains part of the text, in yidishe oysyes.

Can any Mendelyaner tell me something about this artist and his work, or
give a source of information about him?  A dank af foroys.

Itsik Goldenberg  

[Moderator's note: Tanhum (Anatoli L'vovich) Kaplan (1902-1980) was one
of
the great "Yiddish artists" of this century. Some of his lithographs for
_Der farkishefter shnayder_, as well as the illustrations to other works by
Sholem Aleichem, Perets, and Mendele Moykher-Sforim can be seen in the
Shtetl's gallery (http://metalab.unc.edu/yiddish/Kaplan). The page also has
a detailed bibliography.        -i.v.]

Subject: A shayle vegn responsibility to a title

A picture of Ruth Wisse putting on a happy face, smiles tightly at us from
the center of page 63 of Harvard Magazine (Sept-Oct,1999). 

Beneath the picture, the caption states, "Ruth Wisse, Peretz professor of
Yiddish literature, sees feminism as contributing inevitably to domestic
violence, the decline in education, and, worst of all, the collapse of
American family." 

My shayle is: Does personal integrity to voice what you believe take
preference over your responsibility to a title like Peretz professor of
Yiddish Literature when the title is inextricably bound to your name?

Subject: Translation needed from Forverts

One of our Yiddish Vinkl mitglider was the subject of an article in the
Forverts, early summer of 1933.  Bronia Gallon, then Brayndele Galmitz,
was
a student in Grodno who decided to challenge a local shopkeeper about the
anti-semitic "proclamation" he posted in his store windows. She was
successful in her challenge, becoming a local heroine.  Later, she found
that her exploit had been written up in the Forverts. 

We are looking for someone to find the article, xerox or copy it from
microfilm, and translate it for us.  Please respond privately to
rabson@ucar.edu. 

A sheynem dank!

Subject: A proposal.

Some time ago I asked the readers of the Mendele List whether they knew
of
any ready made word lists, listing those words that a reader of Yiddish
literature should be familiar with in order to follow a text. I did not
receive any response and I would like to rephrase my question in the form
of
a proposal. 

Most translations of Yiddish books have a list in the back, explaining the
meaning of words, not translated in the text. These list show a lot of
overlap. The translator will usually include well known words as 'Sabbath',
'Torah' and 'kosher', alongside words less familiar to the general reader
but common in a Yiddish context and words that are seldom used but
characteristic of a specific writer.

I think it would be useful for students of Yiddish, both Jews and non-Jews,
to have a kind of compendium of basic Yiddish-Jewish terminology. 

Most translators of Yiddish use the type of Romanised Hebrew spelling for
Yiddish terms found in English and Yiddish-English dictionaries, like:
Torah, Shabuoth, Sukkoth (Succoth), Seder, Sabbath, Hannuka (Hanukah),
Halakah, Hasid, Mithnaged, Minhah, Purim, Lag b'Omer;  Rosh Ha-shanah,
Simhath Torah, Tu Bishvat etc. 

Many of the Romanised words mentioned above cannot be pronounced by
English
readers, just looking at the words. Even if pronounced correctly, they are
not pronounced in the Ashkenazic way. The spelling used does not
represent a
correct transcription of the Hebrew alef-beys. 

Other words have acquired a standard translation, such as: peysekh =
Passover; khumesh = Pentateuch; khazn = cantor, tishebov = the Ninth
day of
Ab, ksuvim - Hagiographa.  These translations are often as obscure to the
general reader as the words they translate. 

Many common terms cannot be found in an English dictionary at all and
have
to be translated without giving their full meaning or require an explanation
in footnotes or word lists. A word like 'mitsve' implies more than 'a good
deed' or 'a commandment'. 
 
Any Yiddish text will abound in Ashkenazic words as 'shtetl', 'mentsh' etc. 
A translation or different spelling will not do. Also, typical Yiddish names
can not be rendered in an Anglicized form. In translations we might find
'Moses' or 'Moshe' next to 'Moyshele';  'Jacob' or 'Yaakov' but Yankele.

Most Yiddish literature is in the first place a treasure of information on
the many aspects of 'yidishkeyt', or, if that is an overstatement, at least
many readers are attracted to Yiddish literature in the hope of finding such
information. It does not make sense to present the reader who depends on
translations with a mixture of spellings and pronunciations of original
idioms supplemented by inadequately translated terminology. 

I think it would be a good thing to get rid of this Babylonian confusion, by
creating a standard word list, mentioning the most common words of this
type
found in Yiddish texts, giving: 

1. their Hebrew spelling, either in Hebrew script or
in a phonetic transliteration
2. the Ashkenazic pronounced form in YIVO
transcription,
3. the standard English spelling, found in
dictionaries,
4. a short explanation in Yiddish and/or in English.

It should be a basic list of Yidishkeyt and its paraphernalia
(klaper-getsayg), not a dictionary of Yiddish. 

The list could be used by students of Yiddish, by translators and by people
reading Yiddish in translation. 

In order to compose such a list a group of people might collect words
belonging to special categories, such as: 

a. The Jewish calendar: names of the months, holidays.

b. Terminology related to shabes and holidays.

c. Names of the different parts of the 'toyre' and
'talmud'; common terminology used to indicate
chapters, verses etc.

d. Names of the main prayers used in the daily liturgy
and during holidays.

e. Objects found/used in the synagogue; personnel.

f. Attire and atrributes of people visiting a
synagogue.

g. Terminology used in connection with circumcision
ceremonies, barmitsves, marriages, funerals etc.

h. Names of buildings, institutions, organisations and
officials found in a typical 'shtetl'.

i. Titles of religious works and names of authors
often cited; titles of prayer books etc.

j. Other categories, such as:
Words that are part of the standard idiom but have no
equivalent in English, or a misleading one, such as
'mitsve', 'broche' etc.
Words/expressions that are hard to translate without
explaining their usage. For instance: 'keyn eynhore'
is often rendered as 'knock on wood'. No English
writer would say 'knock on wood' after stating that a
girl is very beautiful, though he might say, "all is
well, knock on wood".

(A list of Yiddish personal/Biblical names with their diminutives would be
useful too, but should probably fill a separate volume.). 

Going through the existing dictionaries, Weinreich and Niborski, would be
one way of compiling such a list, but it might be more practical to get
compilations made by experts in the field. Unless one knows the
terminology
it is very hard to extract the dictionaries and get a complete picture. It
is, for instance, quite easy to find that the 'mishne' is divided in 6
'sdorim', but to find the names of these sedorim is a hard job, unless one
knows them. The parts of the morning prayer are mentioned in Niborski,
but
not the order of the different parts. 

I would like readers of the Mendele list to comment on my proposal.
Possibly
such a list does already exist, may be some categories mentioned have
already been worked out in detail. The list of categories might have to be
expanded.Would anyone be interested in contributing to the enterprise of
putting together such a list? Would it eventually be possible to publish the
list somewhere on the Web?

Subject: Hebrew/Yiddish in Israel

For a journalistic project, I wonder if anyone can point me in the direction
of facts and anecdotes about how the Hebrew/ Yiddish issue played out in
Israel over the years. My first choice would be material written in English,
but if there is anything especially appropriate in Yiddish or Hebrew, I
would like to know about that as well. I can also do phone interviews. 

Many thanks,
Miriam Weinstein

how can the archives be accessed by subject?  I know that the archives are
collected by year but this becomes arduous to look through each issue for a
specific subject.  Thanks so much for help.

Subject: Yiddish version of My Fair Lady?

Dear Mendelyaner:

Does anyone out there have access to lyrics from a Yiddish version of My
Fair Lady?  I believe there was a Yiddish production in Israel, as I have
found a mention of an LP entitled "Mein Sheine Lady" (Makolit 12050). If
you
have the lyrics, or know where to find them, and/or have this album, or
know
where to find it, please let me know (off-list). 

Many thanks,
David Kaetz
