Subject: Gvald!

In opruf af Shoshana Balaban-Wolowiczes kashes vegn vort _gvald,_ hot dos vort
etlekhe taytshn: alyn meynt es avade "koyekh" in beyzn zinen ("force" oder
"violence" af english, lemoshl).  _Shrayn gvald,_ vi azoy zi hot shoyn
derklert in ir ayen-briv, "shrayn az emetser zol emetsn rateven" ("cry for
help") oder poshet, "shrayn" ("scream").  Vos men zogt af english, "for
heaven's sake!" ken men oystaytshn _gvald geshrign!_ af mame-loshn.  Kh'meyn,
az inem lidl, "Sha Shtil" redt men humoristish un efsher a bisl ironish oykh
az me zogt "Makh nisht keyn gvald," heyst es, az me zol nisht makhn keyn
tumul, nisht keyn rash, nisht keyn gepilder un nisht keyn tareram oder andersh
gezogt, "me zol nisht makhn keyn tsimes."  Vi shlekht hot der rebe getantst?
Oy, ot dos veys ikh nisht?  A frage far unzere lid un muzik mevinim oder
folkloristn!

[Belaz: In the song cited by Shoshana Balaban-Wolowicz, _gvald_ probably has a
funny and perhaps even ironic tinge with the words "makht nisht keyn gvald'
--I errantly wrote "makh nisht" instead of "makht" above-- as if to say,
"Hush, don't make a tumult or a fuss.  I will leave it to the song and music
experts or the folklore experts among us to determine if the rebbe's dancing
was might raise a "hue and cry!"]

Zayt zhe mir moykhl di ale farshidene toesn oybn i af yidish i af english:
kh'hob nisht gevist az kh'bin azoy mid: a teyrits far di bentshlikht vet ir

Subject: What is a bris-itse?

In Vol. 5.244 Yankev Lewis asks about the "ceremony" or celebration of
"bris-itse which  he found  in Weinreich  as a  "celebration connected with
girl's birth (a regional folk custom)".

He asks  about what various  groups do these days  in the case  a baby girl is
born.  I  have no  personal experience with  that as  all our children are  of
the male  persuasion.  I  know that in  Israel, among those who are not
Orthodox, it  has become quite common to celebrate a "brita"  (the feminized
form of  Brit, the  Israeli way  to pronounce "bris").  It is really  the same
as a brit for a  boy just leaving out the painful part.

Subject: Slogans

I recently saw a bumper sticker which intrigued me. It said:

No Jesus, no peace,
Know Jesus, know peace.

I thought that a slogan of similar form for Yiddish might be fun to think up.
Someone might consider this to be a "narishkeyt", but anyway here goes:

No Yiddish, no nakhes,
Know Yiddish, know naches.

Some of you probably can come up with better examples.

Mendeleyners: Me hot mir dos gebeytn shikn.  Dos volt ir efsher farinteresirt.

**************
Could you post the following announcment to folks who may be interested
in submitting?  I hope you are familiar with _Bridges_, but in case not,
in most issues we publish Yiddish with English translation.  Would love
to have some new stuff in the under 30 issue.


Writing and Art by Jewish Women Under 30

A rising wave of young women are exploring their lives through writing,
yet are often frustrated in their efforts to get published. By focusing
a special issue on their writing and art, we hope to facilitate the more
regular inclusion of work by younger women. Deadline for manuscripts is
April 30, 1996.


Send duplicate copies of all manuscripts and self addressed stamped
envelope for either return of manuscript or letter of acceptance or
rejection.
Bridges, PO Box 24839, Eugene OR 97402.

Subject: Pluperfect

From the exchange set off by Ellen Prince's remarks on the pluperfect, it
seems that there are a number of  puzzling developments in the Eastern Yiddish
tense system which seem to result from the loss of the historical preterite
(which itself was a pan-Yiddish process):

1. The loss of the hobn/zayn distinction in the past auxiliary appears to have
   gone to completion in some areas. As far as we can tell, Southern Yiddish
   and hard-core Litvish speakers (as opposed to Litvish speakers from Raysn)
   maintain the distinction; the boundaries of the region of loss are not
   known.

2. The historical pluperfect, with  the hobn/zayn distinction in both
   auxiliary verb and auxiliary participle, appears to have survived among
   hard-core Litvish speakers. Southern Yiddish speakers have the distinction
   in the auxiliary verb, but have only gehat as the auxiliary participle.
   Among Litvish speakers gevest is sporadically found as the auxiliary
   participle.

3. The future perfect, with  the hobn/zayn distinction in the auxiliary verb,
   appears to have survived among hard-core Litvish speakers but has
   disappeared elsewhere.

4. The conditional formed with the auxiliary `volt' takes the historically
   expected infinitive among hard-core Litvish speakers; everyone else forms
   the conditional with volt and the past participle. This must be seen in
   light of the relic of the subjunctive which served to form the conditional
   in Central Yiddish until the early 19th century: `het' + past participle
   (as can be seen, for instance, in Etinger's Serkele). There was no
   hobn/zayn distinction in the conditional auxiliary, only het. In
   Northeastern Yiddish, among speakers who use the participial conditional,
   gevest is sporadically found in place of geven (so I understand from Ellen
   Prince's observations on Olsvanger).

Any others that can be added to the list?

Meyer Wolf
