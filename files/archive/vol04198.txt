Subject: Introduction

I did not grow up in a house with a strong Jewish cultural identity.  We
were Reform Jews, and only one of my grandparents, Philip Salant was born
in Europe:  Lomzhe, Poland.  Yiddish held a certain fascination for me as
a nisht-far-di-kinder-shprakh.  "gotenyu," "gvalt," "mitskin derinen,"
and "meshuge ke' me' vern" are about all I remember from those days.
Minimal Hebrew school and a Bar Mitsve did, at least, prepare me with
alef-beys literacy for my later involvement in the Yiddish svive.

Having studied French, Italian and German as an undergraduate at Rutgers,
I entered the Columbia Yiddish Studies Program in 1985.  Since that time
I have worked consistently in the field of Yiddish.  While in the
Columbia program, I worked for Mikhl Herzog on the Great Yiddish
Dictionary, punching definitions from existing dictionaries into a
database file.  (My letter was vov.)  I'm pleased to hear that the
project may proceed.  I have taught Yiddish to children in various shules
around New York, and for the past few years, have been teaching in the
children's program at KlezKamp.

In the summer of 1991, I was elementary Yiddish instructor in Columbia
and YIVO's Uriel Weinreich Program in Yiddish Language, Literature and
Culture (Yiddish Summer Program), and after co-directing the program in
1993, have become the Director of Yiddish Language Programs at YIVO,
including the Yiddish Summer Program and YIVO's evening Yiddish classes.

I will be posting a detailed announcement soon about the Yiddish Summer
Program, but for now, here are the dates:  June 26-August 4, 1995 on the
Columbia University campus.  If you want a brochure when they come out
early in January, call YIVO at (212) 246-6080 and leave your address.
You will be put on the mailing list.

It's been a mekhaye reading contributions of people I've known for years.

A dank far mein einschreibn ins forum, Ich bin a plimenik vom mendele.
Ich wojn in England.  Du bin ich taetig mit Yidische Genealogie, Ich hob
notitzen von a Vortrag woos ich hob gegeben zi die Chavrose der Yidische
Genealogie in Grois Britanien.  Wer will a sah Vortrag lesen?  Darunter
is a Mischpooche Tafel (family tree) fin die Mischpooche fin Shalom Yakov
Abramovitchn.  Es siz mir nischt sicher az die Tafel kan durch e-mail
gehn weil sie is geschrieben in Quark Xpress, nischt in Mamelooschen.

I am only kidding in writing in Yiddish with English characters, who can
know the correct spelling in this way.

I have also translated the last chapters of "Schloimele" into English.  I
think it is the best and sharpest stuff he has written, anyone
interested?

A git Woch,

Michael Honey

Subject: Introduction

My name is Paul (Pinchos) Pascal and I live in Toronto, but was born and
raised in Winnipeg.  My education included seven years of Yiddish day
school, at the I. L. Peretz Folk School, a school which began its life
prior to World War I as the "Jewish Radical School", but was relatively
tame by the time I arrived there in the early fifties.  The truly radical
Yiddish school in Winnipeg at that time was the Sholem Aleichem School,
which, we were told, took its orders from Moscow! In addition to the
grade school education, I took a few Yiddish courses at university.

My parents each spoke Yiddish as their first language, but did not
maintain it as the language of our home, except when we were visiting
grandparents.  My mother, a Litvakeh born in Slutsk, had a decidedly
different accent than my father, a Rumeynisher, Canadian-born, and this
mishmash has created interesting problems for me since.

For example, this past summer I spent several weeks doing genealogical
research in Romania, Belarus, and Israel.  Jews I met in Romania had the
benefit of my Rumeynish Yiddish, those in Belarus my Litvish Yiddish; but
when visiting relatives from both sides of my family in Israel, I had to
switch back and forth so frequently and quickly, that I often realized
afterward that I had probably left my relatives wondering if I really was
related to them.

Back on this continent, a relative which I discovered in Long Island, is,
as it turns out, heavily involved in a semi-professional group that
performs Gilbert and Sullivan in Yiddish.  The results are hilarious,
with the original G+S humor overlaid with a layer of Yiddish humor.
Since they do gigs all over the place, Toronto last year had the pleasure
of their performance--to sell-out audiences.  Toronto, it seems, still
has some Yiddish ta'am.

In fact, Toronto is fairly active Yiddishly, relatively speaking.  There
is a strong organization which sponsors regular Yiddish events and
Yiddish classes, known as Friends of Yiddish, and Canadian Jewish
Congress (the overarching Jewish organization in Canada) has a bureau
devoted specifically to Yiddish. This past year, the annual Jewish Film
Festival was joined later in the year with a specifically _Yiddish_ film
festival, in which films of quality were the mainstay.

Subject: Yiddish Atlas, Volume I

I'd like to remind those who may have missed the notice on Mendele some
months ago, that because of YIVO's temporary move and attendant storage
problems, a number of copies of Volume I of the Yiddish Atlas are still
available to YIVO members at the highly reduced price of $40.00.

Checks for 1995 YIVO membership (now regular $75.00; seniors and students
$50.00) plus $40.00 for the volume, payable to YIVO, can be sent to me at
Box 234, Garrison, NY 10524. Please forewarn me with an E-mail message
(zogur@cuvmb.cc.columbia.edu).

Volume II will appear in the Spring of 1995.
