Subject: Chanukah

As Hugh Denman has pointed out, my YIVO rendition of Chanukah as
_khanuke_ was wrong and should have read _khanike_ or _khaneke_. I thank
him for pointing it out.

However, I believe Sholem (Zackary) Berger is really off the mark when
he advocates a transliteration of the Yiddish over the Hebrew for an
*English* rendition of _Chanukah_. Chanukah is really not the private
property of Ashkenazim -- and neither are bar mitzvahs, by the way, tho
perhaps they could apply for a trademark. :) My Sephardic husband
managed to celebrate Chanukah and even have a bar mitzvah way back in
Egypt -- and they didn't learn about them from Ashkenazim.

But, as long as I'm getting testy, let me ask why on earth people send
Chanukah cards? Couldn't have anything to do with Christmas cards, now
could it? I just wish I could have bought stock in Chanukah when I was a
kid -- I'd be a multi-millionaire today.

Subject: is yiddish dying?

There were written many words on Mendele about dying of Yiddish
language. I only wanted to add one sentence to it:

   Language is dead when you don't tell "I love you" yet
   in that language.

so... is yiddish dead?

Subject: Vi zogt men Yidish in Velsh?

What Iosif Vaisman wrote on Mendele Vol 6.096  it's true of course, but
there may be also said that for words "Yiddish language" in Polish
language there are  used words (_je'zyk jidysz_) rather than words
(_je'zyk z*ydowski_). And especially now words (_je'zyk z*ydowski_) are
not used - because there is possibility to understand it as (_je'zyk
hebrajski_) "Hebrew language" instead of words which should be used in
that meaning as (_je'zyk jidysz_). On the turn of the 19th century there
was used word (_z*argon_) for words "Yiddish language", but it has
pejorative colouring.

         Polish words in brackets:
              e' - e with tail
              z* - z with dot over

Subject: Yiddish in Russian

The "official" usage in Russian until recently was "evreyskiy yazyk" for
Yiddish and "drevneevreyskiy" (ancient Jewish) for Hebrew.  All the
books published in the USSR in the 1950's and 1960's used this.  Jews
among themselves used this and "idish" and "ivrit".  By the 1980's the
official usage began to change (as Hebrew stopped being an "ancient"
language?); a "Samouchitel' yazyka idish" was published in, I believe,
1984.

Subject: Vi zogt men yidish af rusish?

Arnie Kuzmack [6.098] asked to clarify usage of _idish_ and _evreiskii
iazyk_ in Russian. The whole story is rather long, so I will mention
just several significant moments.

Adjective _evreiskii_ has been present in Russian language at least
since XVII c. (it is listed in F.Polikarpov's "Leksikon treiazychnyi" in
1704) meaning both Hebrew and Jewish. And until late XIX c. _evreiskii
iazyk_ meant Hebrew language (e.g. "...za to, chto on, znaia evreiskii
iazyk...", Pushkin, Diaries 1835, PSS, t.12, p.337, Moskva, 1949). By
the 1894 _evreiskii iazyk_ is still Hebrew (Entsiklopedicheskii Slovar',
t.5), for Yiddish the same dictionary gives: "Evreisko-nemetskii
dialekt, ili pravil'nee zhargon" [Jewish-German dialect, or more
correctly jargon]. In 1912 Yiddish is called _razgovorno-evreiskii
iazyk_ [colloquial Jewish language] (Evreiskaia Entsiklopediia, t.16).

It might be interesting to look at how Sholem Aleichem called Yiddish in
Russian. From his letters written in Russian we see: _zhargon_ (to
Mendele Moikher Sforim, 23.12.1884), _evreiskii zhargon_ (to M.Gorky,
31.12.1901), _evreiskii (narodnyi) iazyk_ [Jewish folk language] (to
L.N.Tolstoi, 27.04.1903), _evreisko-nemetskii zhargon_ [Jewish-German
jargon] (to L.N.Tolstoi, 25.08.1903), _po-evreiski_ [in Yiddish] (to
S.Dubnov, 14.10.1889). _Zhargon_ is used most often, qualifier
_evreiskii_ is added in letters to the non-Jewish addressees.

Due to various social and political changes that started in early XX c.,
by 1920s the word _zhargon_ is considered demeaning, _evreiskii_ means
Jewish as _drevneevreiskii_ [ancient Jewish] is used for Hebrew, and
word _idish_ enters the scene. The change is clearly indicated by the
first Soviet Literary Encyclopedia: "Evreiskii iazyk - inogda
nepravil'no nazyvaemyi zhargonom, v poslednee vremia rasprostraniaetsia
nazvanie idish" [Jewish language - sometimes incorrectly called jargon,
since recently name Yiddish is becoming more widespread] (Literaturnaia
Entsiklopedia, t.4, Moscow, 1930). Note that the entry here is for
_Evreiskii iazyk_. The 1935 dictionary has both _evreiskii iazyk_ and
_idish_ entries (Tolkovyi slovar' russkogo iazyka, Moskva, 1935), all
later dictionaries favor _idish_ (e.g. Slovar' sovremennogo russkogo
literaturnogo iazyka, t.3, Moskva, 1956).

However, as we know, sometimes the dictionaries do not neccessarily
reflect (or impose) actual usage, and it is the case with Yiddish in
Russian. In my estimates _evreiskii iazyk_ is used much more frequently
than _idish_. The most eloquent example can be found in hundreds of
books in Yiddish and translated from Yiddish that were published in
Soviet Union. Small note on the title page invariably reads: _na
evreiskom iazyke_ [in Yiddish] or _perevod s evreiskogo_ [translated
from Yiddish]. A notable exception is the antologies which contain
translations from both Yiddish and Hebrew. In this case _perevod s
idisha_ and _perevod s ivrita_ would be used. And names for Hebrew in
Russian is another long story...
