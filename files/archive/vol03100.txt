bob rothstein:

thanks for the correction and explanation. i just checked the only
published copy i have of the song, in shoshana kalisch's _yes, we
sang_, and there's no mention of a child there, either. here's the
text of the song as recorded by sarah gorby:

rivkele di shabesdike arbet in fabrik,
zi shpint a fodem nokh a fodeml, flekht tsunoyf di shtrik.
oy di geto, di fintstere, doyert azoy lang,
'vert mayn harts farumet, tut mir azoy bank.'
zifst zikh rivkele fun benkshaft, oy oy oy farshmakht,
vegn ir tayer hershele shtendik nor zi trakht.
'oy vi biter iz im dort, fintster iz mir do,
zint fun yenem shabes, zint fun yener sho.'
zitst zikh rivkele un treyst ir eyn-un-eyntsik kind,
'kumen vet der tate, kumen vet geshvind.
brengen vet er esn, gor a sakh broyt.'
nit gevust hot rivkele az hershele iz toyt.

Subject: "Yontevdik" on Yom Kippur?

In Yiddish, at any rate, the word "yom-tov" [yontev] means "holiday,
festival", according to A. Harkavy's (1928) and U. Weinreich's
(1968) dictionaries.  "Yontevdik" means "festal, festive, joyful,
lively, gala."  The tone is light and happy.  The question:  Is
"yom-tov" applicable to awesome "holidays", like Rosh Hashana and
Yom Kippur?  How about Tisha B'Av?  Do Yiddish and Hebrew differ in
this regard?  (I assume that "yontevdik" is not applicable to either
the Days of Awe or Tisha B'Av.)

Subject: Yiddish studies.

I am a senior in high school who would like to hear of universities
with good Yiddish studies. I'd also like to hear of any programs
geared to people of my age-group(seventeen-eighteen) with little
knowledge of Yiddish. A sheynem dank.

Subject: Du or Ir?

I've never "lived in Yiddish" in any situation in which the
appropriate choice between du and ir wasn't obvious.  Now I'm
supervising an independent study student who will be reading Yiddish
literature (poems of Itsik Manger from Howard Aronson's draft
textbook), and who speaks Yiddish better than I do, though far from
natively.  He asked whether he should address me as du or ir, and I
don't know what to recommend, nor what I should call him.

My professorial style is generally very informal, I teach in very
colloquial language (English or Hebrew), and I often have a close
acquaintance with individual students, though at this university
students are very reluctant to call a teacher by his/her first name
even when urged to (I wouldn't mind at all).  An additional factor:
he knows the du/dir/dayn forms well and has had very little
experience with the ir/aykh/ayer set; eventually he'll want to talk
with people whom he MUST address as ir.

I realize it's my choice, but what should I choose?  What do the
Mendelnikes more sociolinguistically experienced than I am
recommend?  What's generally done in university-level Yiddish
classes?

Subject: verb in first position in exclamations

To what must be a resounding chorus of yesses, I'll add a couple of
lines from leftish childhood memories which were jogged by Beatrice
Ssantorini's question. This is from "A khasene in Biro-Bidzhan",
whose author I've forgotten.

"Ai, iz dos a khasene a freiliche geven!
Di velt hot aza khasene nor keinmol nisht gezen."

And then there's always the Yinglish example "Oy vas I toisty!"
