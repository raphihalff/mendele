Subject: acronyms & Jiddisch in Dutch language

Talking about acronyms: 

In Dutch we use the expression "Dat is koefnoen"
which means "That's for free". e
The word koefnoen comes from "kof" and "nun" , 
added up,  150. The story goes that it
stands for the friend who, when you're in real
financial trouble, will read you the 150 psalms
(and nothing else !). 

There are many Jiddisch words or corruptions in
the modern dutch language !! (most dutch people
don't even know they're Jiddisch words). 
For instance our capital, Amsterdam, is also called
"Mokum"  and we use the word "mazzel" all the time
but here it means "see you". 
Or "een achenebbische buurt (neighborhood)".

Subject: Montreal Yiddish Education

Yes, there is Yiddish education going on in non-Hasidic
schools in Montreal, though only in a few.  The Jewish
Peoples' and Peretz Schools (2 branches, grades 1-6) teach
a four-language curriculum (English, French, Yiddish and
Hebrew).  This sort of education is continued at Bialik
High School (grades 7-11, there is no grade 12 in Quebec).
In this province, it is possible to take a high school
matric examination in Yiddish language and literature.
Beyond this, there is also a small Yiddish afternoon school
(sponsored, I believe by Arbeiter Ring).

clarification: what mikhl and chaim (and i) are wondering
about are the instances of 'es' that (a) are not at the
beginning of the sentence, and (b) don't refer to anything.
also, the funny instances of 'dos' that may or may not be
at the beginning of sentence and that also don't refer to
anything. (but it's not clear to me that the non-referring
sentence- initial dos is doing the same work as the
non-referring sentence-medial dos--the plot thickens.) any
ideas about them?

a dank.

Subject: "Never again."

A slogan of the late Meir Kahane's JDL and Kach party (and
doubtless of others as well) is "Never again!"  Two words,
four syllables, very direct & effective, at least in
English.  How would this be said in Yiddish?  In Hebrew?
Thanks.
