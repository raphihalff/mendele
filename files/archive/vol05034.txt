Subject: Combatting ignorance about Yiddish

Miriam Isaacs' posting (5.031), agreeing with Zellig Bach's insistence
(5.030) that no apologies are required for wanting a respectful attitude
toward Yiddish, was eloquent indeed.  Educating people out of a
patronizing and mocking attitude toward the language and culture is, as
Miriam points out, a problem.  Maybe that's too big a task, and too
general, for any of us as indviduals to take all at once.

Recall that Harvey Spiro's anger (5.025) was triggered largely by the
dreadful mangling of "shver tsu zayn a yid" into "Svayir suit sain i yid"
in a local UJA newsletter.  It seems to me that a note to the editor of
such a publication, (a) gently pointing out that many people are unaware
that Yiddish has both rules respected by professional linguists and a
standard (YIVO) transcription method, and (b) boldly offering to edit
Yiddish content (usually just a few words) before publication, might be
well received.  Note that the goal here is limited and specific:
grammatically correct Yiddish, transcribed in a standard way.  Why, after
a while, readers might get the idea that _yidish iz take nisht hefker_,
as Zellig has put it more than once.  Whether that idea would generalize
to respect for the language and culture, I wouldn't presume to predict;
but in the words of the old joke about an enema for a dead actor, _s'ken
gornit shatn._  (In case one is uncertain about one's ability to deal
with any particular words or phrases, a quick posting on Mendele would
surely elicit acceptable forms.)

Subject: Offensive mockery of Yiddish

I resonate with Miriam Isaacs in feeling offended by a woman teaching a
Yiddish song in a spirit of mockery of Yiddish [5.031 (4)].  Popular
American culture descends into that dim-witted offensiveness quite
regularly.  And it makes me angry.  I, as most others, suspect that
responding with anger will be misunderstood without a thorough
explanation which will almost certainly be misunderstood.  On the other
hand, keeping silent may be misunderstood= as agreement.  Being caught in
such a dilemma makes me (at times) feel helpless.

 But then, Miriam Isaacs ended her post on an optimistic note:

>...to educate people out of this mentality is a problem.
>But let's try and ... speak up for Yiddish ....
>It will get through to intelligent people.

Thanks for the optimism, Miriam.  I needed that.

Those who created the wonders of Yiddish language and culture were the
targets and victims of vicious, pathological destroyers.  Those destroyer
s of minorities were cowards but some perceive them as daring, giving
them a f alse aura of personal strength.  I have suspected that joining
in victimizing Yiddish language and culture is based on this false
perception of strengt h. Therefore, many feel a dread, feel anxiety about
a fancied reemergence o f threats by destroyers.  This may not be
conscious.  To protect themselves against that anxiety, some (I'm certain
about some) invoke a psychologica l defense mechanism against anxiety. It
was named by Anna Freud of blessed memory, "Identification with the
aggressor."  At an evolutionary level it is analogous to "Protective
Coloration."  To the sociopolitically cynical it is related to the motto,
"If you can't lick 'em, join 'em."

Enough anger.  And I'm on the verge of overgeneralizing.

Let me end with optimism, to emulate Miriam Isaacs.  Just think of how lu
cky we are.  Most of on Mendele can throughly enjoy the wonders of two
langua ges and cultures: English and Yiddish.  Now _that's_ something to
celebrate!

Subject: Mendele get-together

In Vol 5.031 my dear friend Louis Fridhandler noted that he will soon be
our neighbor. More important was his raising again the idea of members of
our Mendele List getting together.

As a start, it may be a suggestion that we offer to have a session at
major conferences like CAJE, MLA, and the International Yiddish Club
Conference. The Toronto Club Conference had an excellent session on the
use of computers.

A quick look at the e-mail addresses shows that there are three times as
many Mendelniks on AOL as on Compuserve, but together they represent only
10% of our list. The majority are at a university, and I believe many are
students. For the students the draw will be meetings like the recent
excellent one at Ohio State and Mameloshn '95.

Subject: Reichstag shtik

The sub-headline on Newsweek's story (July 3, 1995) about Christo's
wrapping of the Reichstag reads "Art:  Christo's old shtik for a new
Germany".  One would have expected the germanoid (though not German)
"schtick", or maybe "shtick"; instead, the YIVO-standard transcription of
the word, which is surely show-biz Yiddish.  A nice surprise.
