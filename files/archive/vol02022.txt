Is everyone satisfied that meesa mesheena does not ever
occur in Litvish yiddish? litvishe rebbes always say
meshune, meshunedik, when they speak yiddish/gemoro
loshen--. It may be that the alliterated sound of mEEsa
carried over to meshEEna. but I am certain I heard
meshunedick a million times oona sheer in many a babba kama
sheer.

[Hershel Bershady writes:]

A distant second in order of nastiness was the epithet
"farbissen" ending with gender ending e or er.  More
frequently this term too r referred to someone who didn't
too often look bitten up, but was a biter!

****************

     Although farbissene[r] can mean a biter, in my
experience - central Polish origins of family - this
pejorative referred to a bitter [two "t"s] person,
perhaps one who bites her/his tongue, rather than
admit appreciation or enjoyment.

witches were certainly in in my family, but they were
always 'makhsheyfes', not mise meshines. 'farbisene' was
also a biggie-- i would translate it as 'embittered', but
i'm not at all confident that that's what was intended.
(embittered old women are just the type to give you an evil
eye, so maybe that's the witch connection.)
