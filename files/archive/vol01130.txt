Subject: sources for learning Yiddish.

do you know sources for learning Yiddish, i.e. good books
to learn it from?  at the risk of alientating myself so
early,  i'd like to find one which does not have an
anti-religous stance; sorry if this terminology is
offensive.  thanks. /m

Mendele will temporarily stop transmitting on Sunday.  The
shames is going away for a couple of weeks. I leave you
with this question:

How does one say: I'm going bird-watching (or even worse:
birding)?  The task is not simply a matter of translation
but of staying at arm's length from what's being described,
otherwise you wind up with such wooden terms as 'vinter
vakatsies', zol eyn Got nor rakhmones hoben af unz far 
azelkhe zind.  Of course there's the old portmanteau
"l'havdil".  Or you might say: zayt mir moykhel/ir zolt mir
antshuldigen, etc. But what about having the term itself
express the idea?

[Keeping one's distance from the birds is not even such a
new concern.  We all remember Bialik's first line and most
of us have since learned that the poem on other grounds was
bitter not sweet.  Is it not possible as well that the poet
is throwing our modern Europeanist-Romanticism back in our
faces: what's this business with birds?  Do Jews really
think of a bird as tzipor nakhmedet?  Thus Bialik.  And in a
similar vein the thoroughly assimilated Walter von
Rathenau: when a Jew tells you he hunts _and enjoys it_, he
lies.  For good measure, consider how unsuccessful modern
Yiddish writers are at describing nature or even the
supposed sentiments of their characters when observing
same.  Even I.J. Singer couldn't get away with it.]

Enough.

Which of these do Mendele's readers prefer?  (The shames,
b'avoynosov arabim, was once involved with surveys of
various kinds and will on request summarize the results to
the nearest decimal place.)

a. Ikh gey zikh arumdreyen/arumvolgern mit di feygl.
b. Ikh vel khoyker v'doyresh zayn ..
c. Ikh muz zikh tsukuken tsu ..
d. Ikh gey zikh basheftikn mit ..
e. None of the above (give us your formula)____________________

That's one question.  The second I scarcely dare to raise:
how does one translate such terms as tufted titmouse, downy
woodpecker, long-billed marsh wren?

Zayt mir alle gezunt.  Mir veln zikh nokhamol zunoyfkumen
in tsvey vokhen tsayt.

Of course everyone knows "tuler"-- how else could they
auction off aliyas-- "fahrtzin tuler tzum drit'n muel.  as
for lukshin as a family name in russia. My close friend
marty lockshin teaches at york in toronto, it was always
the wish of my the late frank talmage to introduce him to
james kugel at harvard--- "Lokshin Kugel" !

There's a prominent Lokshin family in Toronto. As for the
currency, there is both English 'dollar' and German
'Thaler'. Both are refglected in Yiddish: doler (invariant)
and toler/tu:ler.

in my house (mother's family from poland, father from
carpathian mts in slovakia), it was categorically /tuler/.
never heard it with a /d/ before i was yivo-ized.

weinreich's dictionary has /toler/, but marked as something
'generally avoided by the most careful stylists, but on
whose admissibility in the standard language there is no
full consensus'. whew.

Subject: Introduction

I am a grad student who knows little yiddish, but has great
interest and little time.  I have been reading mail.yiddish
for some time; that's how I heard about this list...I read
to learn what I can.  I also share mail.yiddish (and
probably this as well...) with friends who know more
yiddish but have less net access.
