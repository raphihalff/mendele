Subject: Introduction

	I am presently a DPhil (PhD) student at the University of
Oxford entering into my (mirtsashem) final year. I am specializing
in 17th/18th century Yiddish chapbooks which feature women as major
characters.  I also enjoy looking at riddles and folk-medicine,
which constitute my major distraction when I am in the library. I
have two children who think that "speaking Yiddish" means American
English with a bunch of "oy veys", "a sheynem dank" and "zay gezunt"
thrown in.

Zayt-zshe gezunt,

Subject: French Yiddish Association Bulletin

The following is an excerpt from a note I sent recently to Ellen
Prince who responded to an earlier comment of mine with information
about the Bibl. Medem in Paris.  She mentioned she was unaware of
the AEDCY's monthly bulletin and thought it might be of interest to
readers of Mendele.

******

In Paris there was an exhibition "Kikoine et ses Amis de l'Ecole de
Paris" at the Couvent des Cordeliers on rue De L'Ecole de Medicine
(which by coincidence is almost next door to the house where Sarah
Bernhardt was born) at which I found an advertisement of the AEDCY
(Association pour l'Etude et la Diffusion de la Culture Yiddish,
B.P. 720 - 75613 Paris Cedex 04, Tel: 42.71.30.07) which offered to
assist persons wishing to speak, read, write, understand, recover or
discover "Le Yiddish."  I assume you and Mendelenicks know about
this group which publishes a monthly bulletin and advertised a
variety of activities devoted to Yiddish.  I had no opportunity to
contact them during my short stays in Paris, but wonder if Mendele
has listed or had contact with this group?  I know from my own
professional contacts that very few French academics use email,
despite a well-organized system in France.  Do you think this is
something worth noting or asking about in Mendele?

The actual content of their leaflet reads as follows:
[Side one -- in large print]
VOUS VOULEZ / PARLER, / LIRE... / ECRIRE... / COMPRENDRE.../
RETROUVEZ... / DECOUVRIR /   LE YIDDISH  / L'A.E.D.C.Y vous y aidera.

[Side two]

   L'Association pour l'Etude et la Diffusion de la Culture Yiddish
-- A.E.D.C.Y. -- est un association 'a charact'ere cultural,
inde'pendante de toute organisation politique ou confessionale,
juive ou non juive.

   Le domaine yiddish avec son ine'puisable folklore, ses
innombrables oeuvres poe'tiques, romanesques, the'atrales, trop
me'connues appartient aujourd'hui 'a tous ceux qui, he'ritiers de ce
riche patrimonie, veulent le perpe'tuer, le transmettre et continuer
'a puiser dans ses richesses.

   C'est le but que s'est propose' l'A.E.D.C.Y..  Elle offre 'a ses
adhe'erents un certain nombre d'activite's culturelles, se'minaires,
spectacles, voyages, et les tient informe's par son bulletin mensuel
La Lettre de l'A.E.D.C.Y. de toutes les manifestations relatives au
domaine Yiddish 'a Paris ou ailleurs.

Subject: Meaning of beheyme

I am posting this message on both MENDELE and HEBLANG since it
involves both Yiddish and Hebrew.

There has been discussion on BRIDGES, the Jewish Feminist list,
about a recent incident at the University of Pennsylvania which
involved the Hebrew/Yiddish word "b'hemah/beheyme".  I am using this
message to ask the experts and will compile the responses and post
them to BRIDGES.  Please indicate if you do *not* want your response
reposted.

The incident occurred when a male Jewish student, who I believe had
yeshiva training and had lived in Israel, was annoyed at the noise
being made late in the evening by some black female students outside
his dormitory.  He yelled at them "Shut up, you water buffalo."  The
term "water buffalo" was taken by them as a racial epithet. Apparently,
someone (I'm not sure who) suggested that the term was a translation
of "beheyme".  The case gained some national prominence especially
after the then president of the university was nominated by
President Clinton (and later confirmed) to head the National
Endowment for the Humanities.

My comment on the meaning of "beheyme" was as follows:

     In Hebrew, it means, as has been pointed out, a large bovine
     animal.  As far as I know, it is not generally applied to
     people and carries no particular emotional freight.

     In Yiddish, on the other hand, in addition to the Hebrew
     meaning, it *is* applied to people as a pejorative. Weinreich's
     dictionary gives the meanings "fool, moron."  It seems to me
     from my childhood, however, that it also tended to be applied
     pejoratively to fat women.  This may be influenced by the
     English use of "cow" in a similar fashion. I don't know of any
     racial connotation.

I would like to propose the following questions for the linguists:

1.  Is it true that the word is generally not applied to people in
Hebrew?  If it is applied to people, is this a recent development,
possibly influenced by Yiddish, or does it occur earlier?

2.  In Yiddish, is the word applied to fat women?  If so, is this an
American usage or was it also used this way in Europe?  Is there any
evidence on how it originated?
