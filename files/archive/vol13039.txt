Let's see if I can get my response to _a nekhtikn tog_ in before fifty other
similar responses arrive in your electronic mailbox.  I believe that the
word-for-word translation is "a yesterday's day."  It is used when you refer
to something that you can't possibly expect to occur. For instance - if
you're awaiting for President Bush to arrive at a press conference and
someone with you says she hopes he will finally be able to pronounce the
words "nuclear energy" you might say, "Veys ikh vos - a nekhtikn tog!"  I'm
sure some other Mendelyaners will come up with more colorful examples.

My folks used nekhtiker tog, as do I, when, for example, one would make a
comment to the effect that "He'll repay the loan - - - a nekhtiker tog."
Meaning, don't count on it, as you can't count of yesterday happening again.
Or, the unlyrical equivalent of "vos iz geveyn, iz geveyn, iz nishto." In my
case, my father's response to my teen-age plea for a car was, predictably,
"a nekhtiker tog".

In use, "a nekhtiker tog" is, perhaps, connected to "les neiges d'antan",
where are the snows of yesteryear. It is about a times not to be regained.
It is used when someone wants to do something but missed the  opportunity.
So if you tell someone  "gey zukh di nekhtike teg"  is equal to "it is
useless".

"a nekhtiker tog" = pardon the expression, When pigs have wings, or when
pigs can fly.  Politely, "That'll be the day." the meaning is impossibility,
save for total eclipse. I think there will be many possible translations,
depending on the original context.  Oy, she's a widow at 80, but she has a
new husband lined up.  Will he marry her?  A nekhtiker tog, comes the other
canasta player.

Do you think my ex-soninlaw will ever pay a penny of the court-ordered child
support?  that shiker!  "A nekhtiker tog."  Or, when the DAR is all
Jewish...etc.

Subject: Re: enge benge

In reply to Sylvia Liff:  I remember this little verse:  enge benge stupe
tzenge, eymele reymele, feygele hop.  It was used in a game called 'clasn'
(classes).  It involved hopping about on an airplane-like design made of
squares drawn with chalk on the sidewalk.  It was also used when trying to
chose a team for some street game in order to avoid playing favorites.

There were other similar verses for similar uses:  en den truer kater,
madmozele vile vater, madmozele vile vu, eyn hoz binst tu.  I knew these
as a boy in Vilna.  Enjoy!

Subject: Re: dona dona

I happen to have an answer for this one, too.  I was speaking to the
wonderful singer, Mashe Benya, about this song last year. She told me that
the play Esterke, from whence came this song, had just opened in 1940, and
the composer, Sholem Secunda, brought this song to Benya, as she wished to
add it to her repertoire.  When she saw the manuscript, the title was "Dana,
Dana", not "Dona, Dona".  Why?  The play was set in Poland and the Polish
equivalent of our "Tra-la-la" is "Da-na-da-na", therefore it was used in the
refrain to reflect the milieu.

Somehow, between there and the Metro Music Publishing Co. it was changed
from "a" to "o".  Perhaps the typesetter thought the pasekh was a komets,
Benya suggested.  Ever since Joan Baez made popular Teddy Schwartz's perfect
and poetic English translation in the 1960s, it seems irretrievably set with
the wrong syllable.  I often wonder when I sing the song which syllable I
should use...

Being brought up in a Yiddish-speaking home in Germany, I don't recall
Yiddish speakers ever using the word nebbish. German Jews, many of whom use
some Germanized Yiddish words (see already Gitl von Hameln) always said
nebbish, but in the sense of nebbach, not in the description of people, as
is American usage.

Subject: Re: nebbish and nebekh

A couple of further comments about  nebekh:

1) Max Weinreich discusses the "nie bei euch" etymology in his Geshikhte fun
der yidisher shprakh. Here are his comments (1973, vol. 2, p. 201): "Di
etimologye nit ba aykh halt nit oys dem ekzamen; aza fraze iz in ergets nit
ufgevizn un ... leygt zikh nit afn seykhl". English translation (1980, p.
543): "The etymology nit ba aykh does not stand the test. Such a phrase is
nowhere documented, and [is] not probable." Chances are that Weinreich is
right.

2) It makes sense that "nyeboshtshikl" is a Russianized version. After all,
just as "nye bozha means 'no god' in Russian, so does the etymon literally
mean that in Czech.
