Subject: YIVO home page

Marvin Friedman's query about "YIVO On-line" (Mendele 5.002; based on an
article in the May 5th "Forward") is most likely a reference to a World
Wide Web Home Page for YIVO -- which was not actually produced at YIVO,
but rather, by ORTnet.  YIVO still has limited access to the Internet, so
we don't yet have the capability of producing a home page (or accessing
the Web).  The e-mail address that I have for ORTnet is
help.desk@ort.org.  Colleagues of mine have sent me printouts of the home
page; interestingly enough, the planned Center for Jewish History and its
other constituent organizations -- the American Jewish Historical
Society, the Leo Baeck Institute, and the Yeshiva University Museum --
have also had home pages placed on the Web by ORTnet.

Subject: Other Yiddish Internet groups

Tom Teicholz's article in Forward mentions "the Virtual Shtetl" among
other Jewish resources on World Wide Web. Unfortunately, the article did
not include Shtetl's address (http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/shtetl.html)
and incorrectly stated that "Shtetl ... set up by the University of North
Carolina". Shtetl, a Yiddish Language and Culture Home Page is located on
the SunSITE server, which is a Sun Microsystems sponsored program at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. However, neither the University
of North Carolina nor Sun Microsystems are responsible for creation,
maintenance, and content of the Shtetl.

Although Shtetl is still under construction, visitors are welcome and
Shtetl's khakhomem approved hard hats as appropriate headdress at all
times (excluding shabes).

Mendele archives, an important part of the Shtetl, are now searchable on-line
using WAIS software. Any WAIS client or form-capable browser (Mosaic,
Netscape, etc) may be pointed to URL: wais://sunsite.unc.edu/mendele.src
to search Mendele.

Mendele archives on SunSITE could be reached using all major network tools:

via WWW:
http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/mewais.html

via gopher:
gopher://sunsite.unc.edu/11/../.pub/academic/languages/yiddish/mendele

via ftp:
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/academic/languages/yiddish/mendele

The whole SunSITE (including Mendele files) is being mirrored in Japan,
so yiddishists overthere may use
gopher://sunsite.sut.ac.jp/11/academic-info/languages/yiddish/mendele

Those who don't have Netscape/Mosaic or gopher access may search Mendele
archives by telneting to sunsite.unc.edu, login: swais, no password.

As always, suggestions and contributions of building materials to Shtetl
are gladly accepted.

we used to call the end piece of the loaf "der kontchik," probably from
the russian word_konyetz_"the end."

Subject: Anakraytshik

an akraytshik or a nakraytshik? Either way, one of the Yiddish words
for "heel" of the bread.  No religious connotations.

Subject: Mlupm kind

I like Zellig Bach's speculative etymology for "mlupm kind" as "a kind
klein vi a pintele" like the diacritical pintele that accompanies mlupm
vov.

Now I'd like to offer my own speculative etymology.  I begin by
attributing the last nun in "melupen" to an adjectival form.  That leaves
"melup".  The Hebrew word "melupaf" has a repetition of its last
consonant (i.e., pey or fey), which often in Hebrew points to a root that
once did not have that repetition (e.g., savav comes from sav; maror from
mar; and so on), so we can surmise that there is a relationship between
"melupaf" and "melup", our truncated "melupen".  And what does "melupaf"
mean?  It means "bound, wrapped up, enveloped, embraced". My guess,
therefore, is that a "mlupm kind" is an infant who is wrapped up tightly,
as was the custom, in a wimple (it's still done in those regions, btw). I
think that Harkavy's translation, referring to a child just learning
alef-beiz is perhaps reporting a hyperbole, and Weinreich's translation,
referring to a babe in the woods (and therefore applicable to anyone of
any age) is reporting a metaphoric use.

The weakness in my hypothesis is how "mlupm vov" fits into all this.
Having constructed this elaborate edifice of a speculation, I am obliged
to squeeze mlupm vov onto one of its girders, so here goes:

Attempt # 1: the diacritical mark hovers near the middle of the vov,
hugging close to it, as it were.  Like tfiln around the middle finger.
Like a wimple, you might even say!  ;)

Attempt # 2: Okay, if you didn't like that one, try this one: to make the
sound of the mlupm vov, your mouth must bind itself up into a tight round
shape, firmly and lovingly surrounding the sound as it emerges from the
throat.

If you like either of those explanations, I'm also selling a bridge in
Brooklyn you might be interested in.
