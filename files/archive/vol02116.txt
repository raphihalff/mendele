Cal Pryluck notes that:

>>It also
occurs that schvartze is also derogatory; my meager
vocabulary includes no synonyms.  Are there any?

To the best of my knowledge, the "official" term for an
African-American -was- "neger," but this goes back to a
time when Negro was the politically correct English form.
When the preferred English form became "black," the Yiddish
"shvartser" became the preferred form. If I recall
correctly, this is the form used nowadays by the Forverts.
So I think that one must conclude that "shvartser" is no
longer derogatory. (By the way, in my family the word
"shvartser" was replaced by "geler" because it was
(correctly) feared that the term "shvartser" was understood
by blacks.)

Subject: shvartse

This term in Israeli Yiddish referred (and still does) to
Sephardi Jews (not to Moslems of same countries, mind
you). It's Hebrew counterpart, however, recent ly acquired
a new denotation: religious Jews (mostly askenazy, but
also Shas-ty pe Sephardi) wearing black Kapottes. They are
called sheh.orim. An alternative term is pingwinim.

Subject: Shikse/sheygets

The sole basis for my characterization of "shagetz" and
"shikse" as pejorative is the manner in which I have
observed these terms being used by a wide variety of people
today. Some of these people know Yiddish very well and some
know it only in passing. They share a common understanding
about the tone of these words. A very common object of
these terms is the nonjewish member of a mixed marriage. I
find that very offensive.

Subject: Shikse/sheygets

When Max Shapiro was serving in Viet Nam and the High Holy
Days were approach- ing, he began to feel very nostalic. He
consulted the chaplain who told him there was a "native"
synagogue in the hills.  He sought it out, found it, and
attended the Rosh Hashanah morning service.  He found it
remarkable that these little saffron colored slant-eyed
humans were praying in Hebrew. At the close of the service,
the rabbi stopped him, and in sing-song, barely intelligent
English thanked him, commenting, "it is reassuring to see a
shaygetz interested in our customs."  "I'm not a shaygetz,"
Max declared vehemently, "I'm Jewish!"  "That's funny,"
replied the rabbi, "you don't 'rook' Jewish."

I trust the point is clear.  One person's ordinary noun is
another's epithet.

Subject: Shikse/sheygets

i agree with ellen prince on the tsatske /chachke
distinction. but must dissent from her analysis of the
negative/positive valence of shaygets/shikse.

shaygets/shikse is a "default" description of those people
who are "other"---unless specially and specifically
modified by fayne(r),shayne(r) etc. it is a pejorative
term.

Subject: Shikse/sheygets

1. sheygets

When used as compliment, it refers not to good looks but
rather to character (e.g. cunning, expressing heretical
views) judged benevolently.

2. shikse

Since a friend of mine christened the infamous Barbie doll
"the ultimate shikse " I cannot call her any other name,
it's so perfect.

3. o > u

I've been thinking about this raising, and I suspect that
the raising vs. lower ing is due to different syllabic
structure. lowering occurs exclusively (?) in closed
syllables with a consonant cluster ((C)uCC > (C)oCC),
whereas raising (t he only example I could think of so far
being psure/psire) in open ones.
