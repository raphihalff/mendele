Subject: Yom HaShoah

Today is Yom HaShoah, the Holocaust Remembrance Day. I light a virtual
memorial candle in Mendele by posting a poem by Shmuel Halkin:

tife griber, royte leym -
kh'hob a mol gehot a heym.

friling - flegn seder blien,
harbsttsayt - flegn foyglen tsien,
vinter - flegt dort foln shney,

Notes: Shmuel (Samuil Zalmanovich) Halkin (1887-1960) - Soviet Yiddish poet,
playwright, and translator.  Growing up in a hasidic family in Belorussia he
started writing poetry in Hebrew. Was a member of early Zionist youth
movement. Published in Yiddish since 1920s. As a member of the Jewish
Antifascist Committee was arrested in 1949 and in 1950 sentenced to 10 years
in prison. Released in 1955. 

This poem was first published in the newspaper "Eynikayt" in August 1944.

Subject: unknown word in yiddish letters

I have been transcribing (transliterating) my grandfather's letters written in
Yiddish (actually a rather fardaytchtes Yiddish) and there is one word, or
expression that I can't make out.  It usually follows sentiments like "Hashem
zol vayter helfen az mir zollen hoben parnosse" and then comes "beth, resh,
vav, vav alef, khof sofit", as best as I can read it.  Does anyone know what
this might mean? 

A hartstigen dank un a freylichen resten Pesach,

Subject: mehr vehrter

Happily, the help I received from fahrshaydener Mendelyaner on previous
postings has prompted me to record the sporadic emergences of other words and
phrases that careered in my growing-up home. Are they Yiddish,
Russian/Polish/Lithuanian, or a chulunt of all four plus a soupcon of Hebrew
and German? (By the way, "chulunt" was pronounced as one syllable by everyone
I ever knew as "chuh'nt" and I always assumed that anyone who took the pains
to pronounce both syllables had never tasted this indescribable mishmash.) 
Here are a few more ( with apologies for the homegrown phonetics): 

Makhareykeh -- a gizmo, a tool, an apparatus, a thing that did something to
something else, used when a proper name could not be found or given to that
mysterious something. 

Makhshelmeynikeh -- usually applied to little, mischevous boys, but also to
young adults overheard boasting of masculine prowess and being forced to admit
that in the consummation process, enjoyment, not protection, was der ehrster
zokh at the moment. Totally ineffective without a severe ear-twisting. 

Schnupp -- As in "Ehr shluft vee a schnupp." Nearest I can come is the Opossum
which sleeps upside down, suspended by its tail. What did Mom know about
Opossums. They didn't eat them (not my Mammy!), so which animal sleeps so
deeply? Could it be, after all these years, something inanimate? 

A Plitkeh -- The biggest candy treat, in more ways than one, that we kids
could have. It was that giant flat platter of Hershey's, with or without nuts,
that sold for a quarter and required our being good for a minimum of three
years without any infraction whatsoever. A "plitkeh chocolate" was the ne plus
ultra of bribery, reward, pimples --- alles. 

Guhzheh -- I took this to mean a big pile, a lump, a lot of something,
including phlegm as in "Du hust gehusten a ganser guhzheh." It was used to
signify a lot of trouble, too. 

Padleh/ Padlukheh -- invariably preceded by "alter." I was immeasurably helped
on "panendreh" and these words seem to go hand-in-hand with the previous
inquiry. Somehow, I recall the second usage as being somewhat (or even more) 
endearingly uttered. Though they slung these gutteralisms around like
frisbees, my folks stayed married for almost 70 years, which says a lot for
the therapeutic value of some plain and fancy country "zidlen. " 

Bourkhtch -- one of the manifold ways of saying "hit, smack" etc., with each
word having gradations in force and cause/effect. Another is "Khmahlyeh."
These sound Russian as opposed to "klop" or "schmeiss" which sound like they
crossed over from German. What, then, about "frask." German, also?

Subject: the letters in Yiddish

Dear mendelyaners,

I would like to introduce myself again. My name is Anna Shternshis, I am a
student at Oxford University at the moment, but I come from Moscow. I am
working now on the project, which aims to describe Jewish popular culture in
the Soviet Union in 1917 - 1941. I am especially interested in Yiddish clubs,
small Yiddish theatres, local anti-religious carnivals, popular literature,
and so on.  I am now in constant search for the materials for my work. The
most valuable sources are the personal narratives - the memoirs, diaries,
letters of the people who lived in the Soviet Union during the mentioned
period. 

On the other hand I know ,that there are many people whose grandparents and
parents came from the former Soviet Union, and at present they live in
America, Israel etc. I can assume they have some Yiddish letters, memoirs,
diaries, which they can not read because they don't read Yiddish or Russian.
For me it would be very important and interesting to read this sort of
material. 

I am ready to translate it into English if the owner wish so, absolutely free,
and send back in the typed form.

In short, if you know somebody, who has the letters from their relatives, ot
relatives of their parents or grandparents, and they want them to be
translated, and I am ready to do that free of charge. I am mostly interested
in the letters and other personal narratives from Ukraine, Belorussia, and
Russia in the period of 1917 - 1941, but variations are possible as well. 

I really hope I will get some responces,

Subject: ployneste

Re: inquiry on "ployneste."  The Yiddish "ployne," meaning "so-and-so" or
"what's-his-name," comes from the Hebrew "ploni," which presumably shares a
proto-semitic root with the Arabic "fulan," which further surfaces in such
places as modern Spanish in the form "fulano."

Subject: ployneste

Shleyme Axelrod asked about the word *ployneste,* meaning wife.

The word ployneste consists of a Hebrew base and a Slavic suffix.  Ploynes, or
plonit in Israeli pronunciation, is the feminine form of ploni.  Found
occasionally in the Talmud, ploni is still used in modern Hebrew to refer to
an anonymous third person, like John Doe, *a certain Mr. X,* or simply
*someone.* It can be used as a place-holder in legal forms, where Ploni would
be akin to *the first party* and Almoni would be *the second party.* With
pedigree, he becomes Ploni ben Ploni.  Sometimes, he is given a surname, and
becomes Ploni Almoni. 

My impression is that the term ployneste is a generally a humorous term, like
*my better half.* Tevye der milkhiger uses this term occasionally to refer to
his wife Golde; here, for instance, Tevye is negotiating shidukhim with Layzer
Volf in Hayntige Kinder:

Makheteyse, zog ikh, in mir iz keyn meniye; me badarf dokh ober iber-redn mit
mayn ployneste, zog ikh, in azelkhe zakhn hot zi di daye ... Fine with me, I
say, I won't prevent it.  However, I'll have to talk it over with my better
half, I say; in such matters she's got the final word. 

Because of the non-phonetic Hebrew spelling, it may be difficult for some 
to find in the dictionary, but Weinreich does list ployneste on page 493.

Sholem Aleichem occasionally uses another humorous term for *my wife,* this
one taken directly from Hebrew: zugosi.  The word zug in Hebrew means *pair,*
so zugosi (or zugati in Israeli Hebrew) literally means *my female counterpart
or partner.* Interestingly, the same formulation, mutatis mutandis, is found
in Arabic to mean *my wife,* although I*m told that the term has no negative
or humorous connotations: zawajti.

Subject: Ployneste

In Vol. 07.187 Seymour Axelrod asked about the origin of Ployneste for wife. 
He specifically asks: 

      1.  What is the source language of the word?  Slavic?
      2.  Is there a masculine meaning 'husband'?

The origin is not Slavic but Hebrew, it being the female form of the Biblical
Ploni (ployni) for someone or something the actual name of which is not
mentioned as in Ruth 4,1.  In the Bible it goes together with almoni (almoyni) 
but in the Talmud the almoni is dropped. 

AFAIK it is not used in the same sense for husband.  In the Even Shoshan
dictionary I found that the term (for as wive) had been used by our own
Mendele in his Benyamin the Third.  I do not know the exact title in Yiddish
:-(

While these days the use is usually in a humorous form its origin *could* have
been in some ancient "modesty" of not being too "familiar" by using the actual
name of someone's wife.

Shalom,

I have added a section in my web site, dedicated to the great poet Razel
Zychlinski who came from the shtetl of my parents Gombin, Poland. 

It is located at:

http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Rue/4017/RAZEL.HTM

I would like to add her biography and I wonder if anyone of you may have a
written article about her in English, to add to my web page. 

Thank you and shalom
