Subject: Tayere Malke

At Sholem Aleichem Folkshul 45 in the Bronx, we had a version of Tayere
Malke which we sang for birthdays. It could easily be revised for a 95th
birthday.  Does this bring back any memories for any Mendelyaner? 

Tayere - insert name -gezunt zolstu zayn
Gis on dem becher, dem becher mit vayn

Dayn tateh mamenyu, lehrer un frayndt
Glickleche yohren un freydikhe teg
Mazel un broche, gezunt on an ek.

Subject: Seeking Words & Sheet Music for Mirele

My wife, Anne, and I have been active participants in the Phila. Workmen's 
Circle Chorus for quite a long time.
We are seeking the Yiddish words (and English if available) for the song 
titled 'Mirele', as well as the sheet music.

Please respond directly to us at lrublin@voicenet.com

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Song query: "Handl Handl"

A couple of years ago the singer Freydi Mrocki learnt a beautiful song from
a 90 year old resident of the Montefiore Homes here in Melbourne.  The man
who taught her said this song used to be sung, and was composed, by a
handler that he remembered who would hawk his wares through the shtetl.  I
was surprised when I heard the whole 3 verses, bridge(s) and chorus - it
sounds like a very sophisticated song for a 'simple' salesman to write! 

Here are the first verse, bridge and chorus,

Kh'hob oysgeton fun zikh di shand
Genumena shtekele in der hand
`Kh drey zikh arum fun hoyf tsu hoyf
`Kh`heyb di oygn ganz hoykh aroyf

Alte hoyzn alte shikh, vos ir vilt nor hern handl ikh
Azoy handl ikh.

Handl,handl `kh`koyf alte zakhn
Handl, handl kh'hob nisht shabes tsu makhn
Handl, handl kh'koyf alte zakhn
Handl, oy handl, kh'hob nisht shabes tsu makhn

The second verse is about living in "shmotche gas", the third about his
daughter for whom he has no nadn (dowry)

Has anyone heard of this song?  I haven't found it in any of the usual
reference books I've seen or recordings I've heard.

I'd much appreciate any extra information, if there is, on this one,

David Krycer

Subject: khreyn

The word for `horseradish' is common to the Slavic languages
(e.g., Russian khren, Polish chrzan, Bulgarian khryan, Serbo-Croatian 
khren, Slovenian khren, Ukrainian khrin, Czech kren, etc.).  It has no 
apparent Indo-European connection.  Various Turkic origins have been 
proposed (e.g., Chuvash kher- `red-hot').

Subject: shimmel lechel

My husband played Shimmel Lechel in Wiliamsburg, Brooklyn in the 30's. One
boy closed his eyes and put his head against the lamppost. A few boys would
stand behind him.One would touch his back in a circular motion and say "You
make a shimmel lechel and someone sticks it in."  It had a sing song rhythm.
Then one boy would poke the back with his finger in the center of the
circle. Then the first one had to turn around and guess which boy stuck his
finger in in the shimmel lechel.

Subject: Shimmelekhl

In response to Shimen Kass's inquiry regarding the way the game "shimmelekhl" 
is played [Vol. 09.010] - it was, as I recall a guessing game wherein one of 
the kids would fold his arms while leaning against a tree with his eyes shut. 
 The children would gather around him while one of the group would draw a 
circle around his back while chanting: "I make a shimmelekhl and someone 
sticks it in!"  At the end of the chant one of the kids in the group would 
quickly poke his finger into the imaginary circle.  The one whose eyes was 
shut then swivels around and tries to guess whose finger was poked into the 
hole drawn on his back.  At this point I'm a little vague about what follows 
but I think this whole procedure was done to determine who was to be "it", 
say, for instance in a game of "hide-and-seek."  Re: the etymology of 
"shimmelekhl" - the second part, "lekhl" is, of course, "little hole."  As 
for what "shimme" could mean, dos veys ikh nit.

I don't know if this is true or not == but I once knew a writer Avram
Davidson who proposed that children's games come from magic rituals and
that shimelekhl (one word, back in Brownsville) comes from "simulacrum", a
magic circle or ring.

Subject: shimmel lechel

To Shimen Kass: The game "shimmel lechel" was played like Hide and Seek.
The person who was IT  covered his/her  eyes by leaning on a trree or lamp
post. One other person in the game (of several players) made a circle on
"IT's" back and said "I make a shemmel lechel and someone sticks it in" and
pokes the person who is IT in the middle of the imaginary circle drawn.
Then all hide. IT has to find the person who did it.  This is as I remember
it and my wife, who was an actrive member of the "CONG" on Pennsylvania
Avenue in Brooklyn, concurs. Since she is the Maven, it must be so.

Subject: children's games

Tayere Mendelyaner,

I am still looking for children's songs, games, rhymes, fingerplays, etc.
for my collection.  I have 6 finger- and baby-play from your kind responses
now.  Those of you who went to Yiddish shuln, can you recall anything for
me?  Most people I ask don't seem to remember, but I know from reading the
archives that the scholars who discourse here have very good memories.  One
man from my shul said to me,"We were too poor to sing."  Another told me, "I
didn't have a childhood.  They had me peddling papers at the age of four and
a half."  They both seemed angry at me for asking, and resentful at their
childhoods-long-past.  Isn't that a shame? Why is it that even though we
love our children so and have produced such great music and literature that
there seems to be a paucity of such material for children? Please be kind
enough to spend a few minutes searching the recesses of your minds for me,
dredge up what you might remember and let me know about it. 

Does anyone know where I can get these books, whose titles were sent to me by
Gila Flam?
Cahan, Y.L.  Yiddish Folksongs with Melodies, Yivo, New York 1957
Beregovsky, M. Yiddish Folksongs  - several editions from the former USSR.
Engel, Joel; Kinder Lider,Berlin 1923

A hartzikn dank,
Lori Cahan-Simon
