Subject: Bay Noyekhn ...

I'm surprised that there's apparently been no attempt to
identify the Bay Noyekhn ... beginning.  Is that because
it's so obvious (like "It was the best of times, it was the
worst of times") that no one has bothered?  I'm afraid it's
not obvious to me.  (I don't know the work, but the tone
and dramatis personae make me guess Itsik Manger.)

Subject: Manger help needed!

I am preparing an introductory textbook of Yiddish which
attempts to teach the language through Itsik Manger's
Khumesh lider. I have prepared the texts, vocabulary, and
grammatical and cultural notes. But I'm a linguist and not
a specialist in literature. Does anyone know of specialists
in Yiddish literature who have a particular interest in
Manger and his place in 20th century Yiddish literature and
who might be interested in collaborating with me on this
project? If you know of any names, please notify me at:

hia5@midway.uchicago.edu

Thanks.

Howie Aronson

Subject: RE: Mendele Vol 2.137

A note on feminine Yiddish-American endings of the
-kha form currently discussed, and apparently of
Russian origin.

They also exist in the Hebrenglish of Israelis
living in the States, Yordim.  For example, the
very common "next-doorikhe."

On making a mess.
Macht a tel of course is the same as macht a khurve,
both referring to reducing the situation to archeological
ruins, and both Hebrew words.  For those who do not pronouce
the Het, khurve comes out kurve, which is a prostitute, which
may or not be a tel.

Subject: Neyditch/-ekha

shnayden bay der neyditsch

I think this means cutting (patterns?) at the sewing table

lendlorikhe

seems to be a variation of the Russian feminine suffix
-ekha like in machekha 'stepmother' (pronounced -ikha)

Mendele readers will be pleased to know that there is a
