Subject: Oifn Pripetchik

It's one of my kids' favourite songs -- even my
2-year-old knows most of the words, and she carries the
tune better than most of the others!

This version is from Mlotek's "Favourite Yiddish Songs"
(Mir Trogen a Gezang):

Oyfn pripetshik brent a fayerl,
Un in shtub is heys.
Un der rebe lernt kleyne kinderlekh
Dem alef-beyz,
Un der rebe lernt kleyne kinderlekh
Dem alef-beyz.


[REFRAIN:]
Zet she, kinderlekh, gedenkt zhe, tayere,
Vos ir lernt do.
Zogt zhe nokh a mol un take nokh a mol:
Kometz-alef: o!
Zogt zhe nokh a mol un take nokh a mol:
Kometz-alef: o!

[The verses below are unfamiliar to me, but here they
are:]

Lernt, kinder, mit groys kheyshek,
Azoy zog ikh aykh on,
Ver s'vet gikher fun aykh kenen ivre,
Der bakumt a fon.

Az ir vet, kinder, elter vern,
Vet ir aleyn farshteyn,
Vifl in di oysyes lign trern,
Un vi fil geveyn.

Az ir vet, kinderlekh, dem goles shlepn,
Oysgemutshet zayn,
Zolt ir fun di oysyes koyekh shepn,
Kukt in zey arayn!

Subject: manger/idioms

1. Bob Rothstein is right about "ti nash".  There is a
parallel construction in the Germanic component of
Yiddish which may, for all I know, have entered by
analogy with Slavic.  In the present instance it would
be something like "Got du mayner/undzerer".  Manger's
phrase reminds me of a saying of my father's: "Ekh ti
reboynesheloylem, kak ty bohu nye bayusya? which trans-
lates something like: "Oh you Lord of the Universe,
have you no fear of God?"  The Slavic I take to be
Belarussian, which the Jews called "raysish".  With
respect to "tsart", it seems clear to me that it's the
common adjective (adverbial in the context) which Wein-
reich glosses as "gentle, tender, dainty, delicate".

2. I have recently begun to worry (I hope needlessly)
about certain aspects of Yiddish which may be lost in
spite of the fact that lots of people are learning the
language.  These are idiomatic expressions (what the
Germans call 'Redensarten', not proverbs) and examples
of language play or tongue twisters.  For example:
"Er lozt zikh nit shpayen in der kashe."  He doesn't
take any guff [supply your own equivalent] from
anyone.

"Zi ken (zikh) ir (eygn) shtetl bashteyn."  She can
stand up for herself.

"Es hot mayn babns tam un Yagnes reyekh", a disparage-
ment of something (usually food) not pleasing to the
taste of the speaker.

"Di tsveyte teg yontef!" an exclamation in response to
an inappropriate or belated intervention in a discus-
sion (argument) by someone not previously involved.

"Gut morgn Gele", a greeting to someone arriving later
than expected.

"Fin Brisk ken Trisk trugt a fiks in pisk a biks."
(This only works in dialect.) A fox carries a rifle in
its mouth from Brisk (Brest Litovsk) to Trisk (?).

I havent done anything systematic about collecting any
of this, but I'd welcome any contributions from Mendel-
nikes and will record them.

Subject:  Yiddish version of "The Adventures of Menakhem Mendel"

In MENDELE 2.178, Pierre Lewis asks where he might buy
the Yiddish text of Sholem Aleichem's "Menakhem Mendel"
monologues.  The short answer to that is:  Contact the
National Yiddish Book Center, 48 Woodbridge St., South
Hadley, MA 01075; tel. (413) 535-1303, fax (413)
535-1007.  The next question -- unasked by M. Lewis --
is which edition of "Menakhem Mend[e]l" should he
purchase? -- For there are many.  There is, of course,
the "Menakhem Mendel" volume of SA's collected works
(the Folksfond edition, reprinted many times):  vol.
10.   And then there are separately edited collec-
tions, such as the 1963 "Musterverk" edition (published
in Buenos Aires, under the imprint of the BA YIVO) and
the 1976 Bet Shalom Aleichem edition (published in Tel
Aviv).  There is also a very rare (and unobtainable)
1926 Kiev printing.

In any event, the Folksfond and Musterverk editions are
almost certainly available from the NYBC, and the Bet
Shalom Aleichem edition may be, as well.  For those
whose principal entree to Yiddish texts is via Uriel
Weinreich's "College Yiddish," the orthography in the
Musterverk edition is closest to what you are most
familiar with, and the Bet Shalom Aleichem edition
comes in second.  The Folksfond orthography is
antiquated by today's standards.

And speaking of standards, has any of our MENDELnikes
been following the "vikuekh ha-leksikografn" -- re the
"Klal-takones fun yidishn oysleyg," introduced by the
Oxford Programme in Yiddish -- in the last couple of
issues of the "Forverts"?  Bay undz in Yidishn
visnshaftlekhn institut iz der inyen, farshteyt zikh,
an ongeshtrengter, vayl der YIVO aleyn hot ayngefirt di
"Takones fun yidishn oysleyg" (beshutfes mitn TsISh"O)
shoyn mit hekher 35 yor tsurik.  "Let a hundred flowers
bloom, a hundred schools of thought contend," is the
response we read in the columns of the "Forverts"  (a
response to a letter signed by ten professors of
Yiddish and related fields, which appeared in the
newspaper a few weeks back).  I wonder if any
subscribers to this bulletin board have any thoughts on
this question.

Finally, I have sad news to relate.  Today was the
funeral of Berl Kagan (Kahn), a truly original Yiddish
bibliographer who is best known for his "Sefer
haprenumerantn" ("Hebrew Subscription Lists"),
"Leksikon fun yidish-shraybers," and "Yidishe shtet,
shtetlekh un dorfishe yishuvim in Lite biz 1918" -- as
well as for a number of yisker-bikher that he edited
(most prominently, the Suvalker yisker-bukh).  Berl
Kagan worked at YIVO and later at the Jewish
Theological Seminary Library, before retiring in the
1970s. At the time of his death he was busy at work on
a supplement to the "Leksikon fun yidish-shraybers."
(He was in the middle of a telephone conversation with
a colleague of mine when he collapsed suddenly, this
past Monday evening.)  Berl Kagan will be sorely
missed.  He was one of the very last of the Eastern
European-born Yiddish bibliographers.  He was 81 years
old.
