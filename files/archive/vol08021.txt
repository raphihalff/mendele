Subject: Modern usage of 'shvartser'

Mendele 08.019 had several responses to Dan Gilman's original query on this
subject.  However, no one addressed the issue from the point of view of the
language in which the word is being used. 

My take on it is that in Yiddish the word "shvartze(r)" is neutral, and if it
has any pejorative connotations these come from the context.  However, the
word is pejorative in the extreme when used in English, since a number of
other, neutral English terms is available.  Personally, I've never heard it
used in English in a neutral context;  even when used to refer to the
cleaning woman, why not say "cleaning woman" instead of "shvartze" if no
negative connotation is intended? 

The reply by Fred Sherman seems to corroborate at least the first part of my
comment above. 

I believe that the view of Gilad J. Gevaryahu that - "The only true
African-American people I know I [are?] my Jewish friends from Morocco and
South Africa. This term for black people is somewhat misleading, and
therefore probably with short shelf life" - smacks of wishful thinking.  The
word has been around among English speakers almost since Yiddish came to
America, and unfortunately there will probably always be bigots among us who
will continue to use the term despite all our wishes to the contrary.

Subject: Use of the terms "Shvartzers" and "Galas"

I have read with interest the comments regarding the use of "Shvartze" to
denote an Afro-American.  Growing up in the southern United States in the
40's and early 50's, I can attest to the fact that the term was not always
used in a neutral manner.  There was a great deal of latent prejudice in the
Jewish community; even while we were the focus of so much prejudice from the
gentile community.  Afro-Americans were referred to as Negroes when one did
not want to be offensive, and "schvartzas" (with a long "ar,"  as in the word
"are," if you want to duplicate the Southern American accent pronounciation). 
In the late 50's and early 60's, as consciousness rose and many of us worked
to improve the conditions for Afro-Americans in the south, the term
"shvartze"  was used less in polite company (partly because the term WAS
understood by Afro-Americans) - so the term "blue" was often substituted in
place of "shvartze." 

Mexican-Americans were held in equal esteem (or lack thereof) in my part of
the country, and I remember that the term "gala"  (pronounced the same way as
a big event, eg., a gala affair) was used for them.  I haven't run into this
term in other parts of the country, and I wonder if it might have just been a
local annomoly.  Has anyone heard of the term "gala" being used this way? 

Keep the discussion coming.  It's really enjoyable.

Subject: Modern use of "shvartser"

It seems to me that a lot of people who use the term "shvartser" as an English
pejorative expression actually mispronounce it as "shva-tse".

Is anyone else familiar with a conversational Yiddish tendency among native
European Yiddish speakers to differentiate between "goyim" (i.e., white non-
Jews) and "shvartses" (i.e., black African-Americans)?

Growing up in Vineland, N.J., and Baltimore, MD, I have also heard the
following colloquial Yiddish terms applied to American blacks: "grine" (i.e.,
green, a color); "bloye" (i.e., blue, a color); "khoyshekhdike" (from the
Hebrew "darkness", thus equivalent literally to "darkies"; as well as "kushim"
(Hebrew for "Ethiopians").

Subject: Afrikan(er)-amerikaner

My "inner ear" tells me that there's a syllable missing in
"Afrikan-amerikaner."  While I am definitely not an expert in Yiddish
grammar, I have not encountered similar constructions referring to other
racial or ethnic groups.  Instead I have seen, e.g., "ItalyenER- amerikaner,"
the stem of the first word being "Italye."  Someone of Italian origin is an
"italyener" in Yiddish; I don't believe that the prefix "italyen" is
grammatically permissible in Yiddish.  In using a hyphenated construction for
an ethnic group both nouns should be spelled out in full, e.g.,
Afrikaner-amerikaner. 

There are other ways of denoting ethnic groups -- the examples of "kanader
frantsoyz" (or "kanadisher frantsoyz," both unhyphenated, by the way)  and
"Amerikaner/Amerikanisher yid" spring to mind -- but these presumably
illustrate other grammatical principles.  I hereby cede the floor to the
trained grammarians in our midst.

Subject: shvartse(r)

Marc Caplan's writes: "Because I come to Yiddish by way of English, the word
"shvartser" is irrevocably tainted for me by the racist connotations it has
acquired in English. I think contemporary Yiddish speakers, especially in
America, are kidding themselves if they consider the term, in 1998, neutral
or objective." 

I disagree.  Contemporary Yiddish speakers (and by that I mean those who do
*not* come to Yiddish by way of English but who come from backgrounds where
Yiddish is at least one of the languages of the home/neighborhood)  have
other words at their disposal to be non-neutral, non-objective when
discussing blacks.  While _shvartser_ is the colloquially used word for
blacks, "code words" (used in Yiddish discourse in the presence of blacks so
as not to offend blacks who may be familiar with the word _shvartse(r)_, or
to talk about blacks in their presence, be the comment racist or of a
personal nature) are _shkhoyrim, khoyshekhs, khoyshekhdike, tunkele_.  None
of these has any value judgment associated with it, as far as I intuit.  They
simply denote 'blacks' and connote that the utterance containing the word is
being made in the presence of people for whose ears the utterance is not
meant.  I know of no word in Yiddish which is like the English _nigger_ (to
my northeastern American ears, to which it is a "dirty word"). 

One would be kidding oneself, and one would be ethnocentric, to believe that 
English usages (even p.c. ones) are by definition objective and neutral
and should therefore be imposed onto the speech of speakers of other languages.
(And Marc doesn't say this.  It's just my own editorial comment.)

Subject: fendel and rondel

I forwarded the posting concerning Guggle Muggle to my brother, and he
reminded me of two words that our mother and aunts used.  They are: 
fendel (fendle) and rondel (rondle).  They were the words for frying pan,
and sauce pot respectively.  I may  have transposed the words with my
remembered definitions.  My mother came from Bukovena, and my father (his
sister) from Bessarabia.  Does anyone know if these were words in general
use, or only local?  Many thanks,

Subject: Yiddish via e-mail

Morris Feller described e-mail in Yiddish. An alternative method of sending
Yiddish, which also owes a debt to Refoyl Finkl, is the script Yiddish,
available at

   http://www.connix.com/~mlfarm/utiliities.html#yiddish 

which relies on tools available on most Unix machines and a very clever set
of LaTeX macros and programs written by Refoyl Finkl.  You write your message
in transliterated Yiddish, your recipient saves the file, does `yiddish
filename' and views your message in Yiddish on the screen or optionally can
print it. 

The Yiddish script would certainly work on Linux and other variations of
Unix, as well as most Unix workstations.  I'm not sure whether it could be
adapted for PCs running ms-windows or Macs.
