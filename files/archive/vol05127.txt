  The Ninth Annual Klutznick Symposium: October 27 & 28, 1996
       Yiddish Language and Culture: Then and Now

Creighton University's Klutznick Chair in Jewish Civilization and Center
for the Study of Religion and Society will host the Ninth Annual
Klutznick Symposium to take place in Omaha, Nebraska on Sunday, October
27 and Monday, October 28, 1996.  The theme of the Symposium will be
Yiddish Language and Culture: Then and Now.

The Program Committee seeks proposals for presentations on Yiddish
language and culture, past and present. It is interested in receiving
proposals on topics related to the history and development of Yiddish as
a language, and aspects of Yiddish culture, including music, fiction,
poetry, humor, and theater.

Those chosen to participate in the symposium will be expected to submit
their papers in a scholarly format; those papers will be published in a
collected volume. Participants will also be expected to make twenty
minute presentations of the essential elements of their papers in a
manner suitable to an audience composed of the general public and
scholars. Please note that the reading of papers as submitted for
publication would not be appropriate to this audience. Audio/visual aids
are encouraged.

Subsidies for the presenter's costs of transportation and accommodation
will be provided.

For further information contact Leonard Jay Greenspoon, Chairholder of
the Klutznick Chair in Jewish Civilization (ljgrn@creighton.edu or phone
402-280-2304), or Bryan Le Beau, Director of the Center for the Study of
Religion and Society (blbeau@creighton.edu or phone 402-280-2562) at
Creighton University, 2500 California Plaza, Omaha, Nebraska  68178. One
page abstracts and vitae should be submitted to either Dr. Greenspoon or

Subject: Chemistry texts in Yiddish

In response to Bob Rothstein's query (5.124), YIVO does not own a copy of
"Khemishe terminologye" (Minsk, 1927).  I have not checked other library
catalogs, but books of this type are quite rare.  YIVO does have several
chemistry textbooks, though:

Brokhes, Sh.  Khemye loytn laboratorishn metod.  Moscow, 1931;
Grigoryev, G.  Khemye far shul un zelbstbildung (kurtser kurs).
     Kiev, 1929;
Khotinski, Ye. S.  Yunger khemiker.  Moscow, 1928;
Rogodin, A. Y.  Khemye.  Warsaw, 1920;
Verkhovski, V. N.  Khemye.  Minsk, 1933 (2 vols.).

Subject: Gilgul fun a nign

Mendelyaner may be interested in this true tale of the "transmigration of
a melody."

Knowing of a dear friend's interest in Paul Robeson and in folk music, I
dubbed for her all of Robeson's renditions of Yiddish songs as well as of
Celtic melodies, in which she, as a "cultural Catholic," is also
interested. She was particularly struck by the traditional (and
proto-Marxist) "vig lid" (lullaby), which appears, among other places, in
Ruth Rubin's "A Treasury of Jewish Folksong," pp. 22-23 "Shlof Mayn Kind,
Shlof Keseyder" (transliteration and translation adapted):

shlof mayn kind, shlof keseyder;
zingen vel ikh dir a lid.
az du, mayn kind, vest elter vern
vestu visn an untershid.

az du, mayn kind, vest elter vern
vestu vern mit mentshn glaykh.
demolst vestu gevoyer vern
vos heyst orim un vos heyst raykh.

di tayerste palatsn, di shenste hayzer,
dos alts makht der oriman.
nor veystu ver es tut in zey voynen?
gor nit er, nor der raykher man.

der oriman, er ligt in keler,
der vilgatsh rint im fun di vent.
derfun bakumt er rematn-feler
in di fis un in di hent.

Sleep, my child, sleep peacefully,
I'll sing you a lullaby.
When my little baby's grown,
You'll know the difference--and why.

When my little baby's grown
You'll soon see which is which:
Like the rest of us, you'll know
The difference between poor and rich.

The largest mansions, the finest homes,
The poor man builds them on the hill.
But do you know who'll live in them?
Why, of course, the rich man will!

The poor man lives in a cellar:
The walls are wet with damp
That bring pain to his arms and legs
And a rheumatic cramp.

And so it was, through the artistry of an African-American singer, that
Catholic-raised Celeste Lederer, the Music Director of the Unitarian
Church of Staten Island, NY, played a Yiddish melody during services last
Sunday in recognition of rosheshone.

Subject: Teaching Yiddish to Children

I am teaching Yiddish to my 10-year-old daughter and share the concern
voiced by others about the need for good teaching materials.  I can
recommend several, though, including materials that include both a tape
and text:

Through the National Yiddish Book Center, I ordered a 3-volume workbook
by Frida Cielak, published in Mexico in 1979.  It is perfect for teaching
the alphabet and sounding out words; it was at just the right level for
my daughter, a total beginner.  I also ordered from NYBC a
tape-text-translation of "Di Dray Bern," by Marcia Gruss Levinsohn.  My
daughter found the tape a little juvenile, but still useful.  From
Audio-Forum I ordered "Yiddish 30," a simple Berlitz-type tape with days
of the week, etc., in English, then Yiddish.  Another great
tape/text/translation combination, from Workmen's Circle, is called "Ikh
Hob Lib Yidish," by Emmanual Goldsmith.  It is a series of short poems,
stories, and jokes -- very good for an adult or teenager.

My question for other Mendeleyaners is -- what goals are appropriate for
a child learning Yiddish?  There's no Torah reading at the Bas Mitzvah to
aim for....

Subject: "Rumania, Rumania"

Thanks to Milt Eisner (5.124) for providing the words to Aaron Lebedeff's
"Rumania, Rumania".  Now, if someone can translate the following, this
child of _litvakes_ would be additionally grateful.

karnatsele
kashtaval
kastravet (is this supposed to rhyme with _iberal_?)
patlozhele (Weinreich has _der patlezhan_ 'eggplant'
            Harkavy has _patlezhane_ [or _fatlezhane_] 'tomato')
dzingma (is this a real word?)
Yokum purkon min shemaye (loshn-koydeshdik?)

Subject: Secular kolnidre in L.A.

Secular Yiddishists in the Los Angeles area who are not planning to
attend religious kolnidre services next Tuesday evening are welcome to
join a secular observance sponsored by the Sholem Community Organization,
to be held at 7:30 PM at Kehillat Ma'arav, 1715 21st St., just south of
Olympic in Santa Monica.

While the program is primarily in English, it includes a great deal of
Yiddish poetry and songs, both in Yiddish and in English translation. The
cost for guests is $10; $5 for seniors and students.
