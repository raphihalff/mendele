Subject: Spider webs

In response to the two inquiries about spider webs:  Bernard Gershen's
_povitinya_ (6.130) is presumably from Ukrainian _pavutynnia_, a
collective noun meaning 'spiderwebs'.  (A single web is _pavutyna_).
Moishe Kijak's _pantchene_ (6.132) may be a shortening of Polish
_pajeczyna_ (with a tail on the _e_), pronounced [payenchina].

Subject: Wallach

I'm not sure what Zev Kesselman's Romanian-Jewish friend meant by
"Wallach" (6.125)--although I can guess at things like 'vagabond',
'good-for-nothing' etc.--but the term has a long and complicated
history. There is a Balkan nationality or ethnic group known as Vlachs
(in Albania, former Yugoslavia, etc.) or Aromanians, who speak a Romance
language or dialect related to Romanian.  They are/were traditionally
migrant shepherds in the Carpathian region.  The Slavic name
_vlach_/_vloch_/_voloch_ etc. probably comes from a Germanic term
meaning 'stranger, foreigner', which in turn comes from the name of the
most powerful Celtic tribe in Central Europe, which was known in Latin
as the Volcae.  The term was applied by the ancient Slavs to all their
Romance-speaking neighbors, whence also contemporary Polish _Wloch_
[with barred _l_] and Hungarian _olasz_ for 'an Italian'.  The Celtic
name is also the ultimate source for the name Wallachia (the Romanian
province), and apparently for Wales/Welsh and Walloon as well. Among the
Slavs the ethnonym gave rise to the terms for a gelding and for the
operation (cited by Jota Piasecki, 6.128).  In Czech _valach_ is used to
refer to a lazy person; the etymologist Vaclav Machek attributes that
either to the reputation of shepherds or to the sluggishness of
geldings.

Subject: Hermetic isolation

Michael Steinlauf stated the case against any notion of the "hermetic
isolation" of Eastern European Jews very eloquently (6.128).  I would
add one additional example from folklore. Among the various macaronic
songs (_mishshprakhike lider_) found in the Yiddish folksong tradition,
there is one in which the Slavic component, which is in most examples
Polish or Ukrainian, is Slovak.  The song is about the birth and naming
of the prophet Samuel, but its text is clearly modeled on a Christmas
song about the birth and naming of Jesus.  The song is thus both
linguistically and culturally macaronic.  While one could conceive of
an East European Jew "overhearing" a Slavic melody "at a distance" and
appropriating it for Jewish use or borrowing Slavic words learned
through superficial contacts, this Slovak-Yiddish song suggests a more
intimate knowledge of Slavic culture, and religious culture at that!
And recall that the Christian model was adapted to Jewish religious
purposes, so that the author was presumably not an outsider to the
traditional Jewish community.
