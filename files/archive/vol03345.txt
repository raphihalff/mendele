Subject: Introduction

There isn't much to say.  My mother speaks Yiddish, eventhough sh
is from Cuba.  Her parents were from Russia.  I don't speak much
just know a few phrases and words, but I am interested in learning.
I do know Hebrew.  i am residing in Miami for a while.

Subject: Shin-vov-lamed-lamed

Dvorah Halperin Biasca asks about the translation of shin-vov-lamed-lamed
in the following phrase by H. Leivick:

> ver es iz 'sh-v-l-l' di lebedike role fun undzer literatur un fun undzer
> yidish, iz 'sh-v-l-l' undzer koym-ideye umetum.

Shoylel zayn is derived from the Hebrew root shin-lamed-lamed, meaning to
negate or deny (an idea or statement).  The Modern Hebrew [shlili],
'negative', is from the same root.

Subject: Lesbian klezmorim

A bilingual gag too good to go unremarked in MENDELE appears in a piece
in the latest issue of _Bridges_ ("A journal for Jewish feminists and our
friends", whose managing editor, incidentally, is a MENDELEnitse.)  The
article mentions a klezmer band, whose players are lesbians, named ...
Lebedyke un Freylekh. Doubling the pun,  the writer points out that
"_lebedik un freylekh_ means _joyous and gay_ in Yiddish".

Subject: Birobidzhan

Our Yiddish vinkl may be interested in contributing a book or two to the
folks in Birobidzhan.  Did anyone get their mailing address?  I've sent a
couple of messages, but have heard nothing.  I assume they were also
referred to the National Yiddish Book Center.

Subject: "a makh ton"

hello, i have two questions.  one is relatively straightforward, and the
other perhaps less so.  the straightforward one first.  i can't figure
out what the following sentence from "grine felder" means.

Me tor nisht a makh ton mitn hant oyf a dorf-mentshn.

now the second question, which is related a bit to holger nath's recent
question about "nas vern/vern nas".  the reason i'm interested in the
sentence from "grine felder" is that it is an instance of the so-called
stem construction---that is, the type "a shprung ton", "a geshrey-oys
gebn", etc.  in this construction, the stem "a shprung", "a geshrey-oys"
and so on usually precedes "ton" or "gebn" (at least when those verbs are
infinitives or participles).  but there seems to be some word order
variation possible.  in his insightful article on the construction (word
38 (1987), 13-25), moyshe taube writes that "er hot ir a kush gegebn" and
"er hot ir gegebn a kush" are both possible (p.22, fn.3).  now "kush"
exists as an independent word, but certain stems are not like this.  for
instance, the list that taube gives on p.15 of his article includes
"bombel" (dangle), "koketir" (flirt), "mrike" (grumble), "waks" (grow),
all of which are restricted to the stem construction.

what i am curious to know is whether it is possible to have, say, "kh'hob
dos ershte mol geton a koketir" or "hot dos berdl bay mayn bruder shtark
geton a vaks" in addition to the attested examples that taube cites
("kh'hob dos ershte mol a koketir geton" (p.15) or "hot dos berdl bay
mayn bruder shtark geton a vaks" (p.20).

many thanks in advance for any information on this.

Subject: Yiddish word for marry

Has it ever been discussed/determined here, whether the similarity of the
word for "get married" (hairaten) to the Hebrew formula ("harei at...")
is accidental or not?  A native German speaker here claims the word is
pure German.

If yes, can you cite the appropriate reference?  If not, can you post the
opening paragraph?
