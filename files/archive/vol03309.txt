Subject: Amerika gonif

"Amerika gonif" is one of the exclamations I remember as a regular part
of my family lexicon as I drifted further and further from what had been
my first language.  My father used it as an ironic comment about
individuals and society.  My interpretation is something like: "some
people sure know how to take advantage of opportunities."  The phrase
seemed to imply both admiration and vague criticism.

Subject:  Amerika ganif

The best description I know of "Amerika ganif" is in the following joke:

A recent Polish immigrant to New York uses an escalator for the first
time in his life.  He is amazed.

"Amerika ganif," he says, "me shtayt un me gayt."

__Golda Werman

Subject: Introduction

This is by way of a very short introduction (my apologies to those
Harvard or Canadian people who already know me).

My name is Ayelet Kuper Margalioth and I'm a Senior at Harvard. I'm from
Montreal, and when I'm there I'm involved in the Montreal Yiddish Theatre
(I also learned some of my Yiddish at Bialik High School, but mostly from
my family).

Next year I'll be going to England to get an M.Litt. in Yiddish
Literature at Oxford. At the moment I'm actually majoring in Biology, but
I'm taking a class in Yiddish novels with Prof. Ruth Wisse here at
Harvard and took another last semester on Yiddish short stories (if
anyone knows where to find out of print English translations of Yiddish
book, besides at the National Yiddish Book Center, please let me know). I
think that's about it -  I have to get back to work on my thesis, which
is due next week. Zeyer gut tsu eich bakenen (I think that makes sense;
I've forgotten a lot here at school),

Subject: Learning Yiddish

In reply to Seth Golub:

I know that there are Yiddish-instructional audiotapes available, I'm
just not sure where one would find them in the USA. The Jewish Public
Library in Montreal has a set, though, and might be able to help you find
them closer to home (they're at 5151 Cote-Ste-Catherine St in Montreal,
Quebec, Canada, but I don't know the Postal Code or Phone Number).
Widener Library Judaica, Room M, Harvard College, Cambridge MA 02138
might also have a copy or know where to find one.

Thot you cyber-shraybers would like to see more of what's happening to
Yiddish music out on the information superhighway. The following comes to
me via Henry Goldberg of Boston, a gezunt em in pupikl. I take no
responsibility for orthography. Az me fort kayn Sevastopol, iz nit vayt
