Subject: AALTA Conference

The American Literary Translators Association will meet in Austin Texas,
October 26-29, Radisson Hotel.  Theme:  Crossing Borders:  Translator as
Outlaw.  Yiddish will be represented for the third year running, with my
participation this time on a panel called Translation Without Borders.

The organization is a good one and would benefit by other Yiddishists
becoming more involved.  In addition to panels and workshops, bi-lingual
readings of work in progress are a feature.

Alta Offices:  The Univ. of Texas at Dallas, MC35, Box 830688,
Richardson, Texas, 75083-0688, (214)883-6303.  E-mail: ert@UTDallas.edu

Subject: Teaching Yiddish to children

I subscribe wholeheartedly to the idea of teaching Yiddish to our
children.

Recognizing the financial and political problems that prevent the
teaching of Yiddish in recognized community forums, I would like to add
another problem (probably with an easier solution that the aforementioned
ones) which I have discovered in the process of helping my son learn some
Yiddish for his secular bar mitzvah .  He has requested repeatedly "the
kind of thing I have in my Spanish class at school," that is to say, a
linked textbook/workbook/tape set.  To my knowledge, no such set exists.
I have textbooks from my youth that he is making do with, and I have
bought a Yiddish vocabulary tape, but he has put his finger on a central
weakness of trying to teach/learn Yiddish as a second language: there are
no suitable, modern materials for teenagers.  He enjoys languages and
wants very much to learn Yiddish, but I cannot provide him with a
constant Yiddish environment at home (and he certainly can't get one
anywhere else around here).

Materials are not a trivial problem - we need to work on them.  If anyone
has any, I would be delighted to know about them

Subject: Mentshelakh

In vol. 5.088 (I'm catching up slowly :-) Reb Daniel Soyer asked about
the word 'mentshile', surmised (correctly) that it refers to a doll, and
asked whether this was an appropriate gift for a small boy.

When I was a kid, my parents, siblings and I referred to dolls as
'mentshelakh', especially very small ones (the kind that come as parts of
other toys, thumb-sized).  (For a generational perspective, I'm now 21.)
My parents are both native Yiddish speakers, but I grew up speaking
English.  I'm not sure when it happened, but 'mentshelakh' has become a
standard part of . . . (I don't know what to call it, but it's the
Yeshivishese spoken outside yeshives by people who are not in yeshive but
whose lives are closely connected to it, such as wives and children of
kley koydesh and koylel yungelayt, and many kheyder-yinglakh.)

As for small boys being allowed to play with dolls or receiving them as
gifts, I don't recall any particular issue with dolls beyond the standard
discouragement of toys and games;  it's toys in general, not just dolls,
which are labelled "girlish".  But this doesn't begin until the child
starts learning;  in fact, male toddlers ar often raised on the same
terms as their sisters, until they start going to pre-school.  (For
example: male toddlers will be dressed in the same style of clothes as
female, they will be allowed to play together, and at functions with
separate seating, or even in shul, they will sit with the women.)  This
is especially true in those circles (mostly khsidish) where the hair is
grown long until the third birthday, and the first haircut on the third
birthday is also the occassion for taking the boy to kheyder for the
first time and getting him started learning the alef-beys.

Subject: Golems and dybbuks

I am looking for legends.  I would like to assemble, for personal
reasons, a good deal of stories about golems and dybbuks.  These would
ideally range from the most un-self-conscious folk tellings of these
tales (if such things exist,) to more deliberately authored works, such
as Ansky's play. Also, I would be interested in learning of the existence
of any other kind of Yiddish 'creature' myths.  Please suggest stories,
and books in which they may be found, either on a general posting or to
my address.
