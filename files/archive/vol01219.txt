Gus   Grannen: NO! NO! And, in addition, "no" to
"bentshEn'. It's "bentshn".

I found this bit of doggerel written in handwriting and
tucked into an old Haggadah I bought at a used book sale.
Can anyone comment, tell me if there were other bits of
screed like this.  I am very interested in the internal
Yiddish comedy of the early 1900s and the effect it had on
burlesque.

The poem follows:

Er zis gevendt a kalte, und ah regendicke nacht.
Erzis gedundet, erzis geblitzt, erzis geknacked.
Sizt an alte, kalte, toches oif McKinley's kaveh und kocked.
Haef zuech oif McKinley undt zagt mit a kvitch,
"Fehr vass kockst du oif mein kaveh, do sonuvvahbitch?"

There are clearly political implications in this, but the
verse is reminiscent of some of the bawdy songs done on the
Orpheum circuit and also of the British music hall genre as
"My old man said to follow the van, and don't dilly dally
on the way."

Comments?

Thanks to Bob Werman for his Had Gadya.  I like the idea
that now nothing works right but that when the Herr comes
it will.  My in-laws, who do know Yiddish, helped us with
the song for our Seders.  My mother-in-law, however, says
that they would *never* use Herr to refer to Der Eybeishe
(spelling?).

My teacher used to tell the following story about Bialik
(from whence it comes I do not know).  According to the
tale he happened upon some reform Jews eating bread on the
eighth day of Passover, late in the day.  He said to them:
You had better eat in haste, soon you won't be able to sin
any more!

_bis_ in Modern Hebrew (as in:  ten li bis  'give me a
bite') comes from Yiddish _bis_ (as in: gib mir a bis).  _a
bisl_ is the diminutive of _bis_ 'bite', meaning 'a small
bite' and by extension, 'a little bit'.  English _bit_ is
related to English _bite_, just like in Yiddish case.

Speakers of Modern Hebrew also say _shluk_ (as in: ten li
shluk) for 'give me a sip (of what you are drinking)',
which comes from Yiddish (although daytshmerish) _shluk_.
So maybe, on second thought, it's straight from German. In
Yiddish it's _shlung_ 'swallow' (noun form).  Yiddish
equivalent for 'give me a sip' would be:  gib mir a zup.
zupn = 'to sip'.  Could you say: "gib mir a shlung vaser"?

Peysekh(d)ike latkes, khremzlekh, bubelekh (never heard of
this before), and let's not forget pampeshkes/pompeshkes!

Thanks, Bob Werman, for reminding me of the Yiddish
khad-gadyo.  I introduced this item to my Intermediate
Yiddish class at the Univ. of Pennsylvania.  I've done this
with numerous other items discussed in Mendele, so zayt
visn, everyone, that Mendele is used as a classroom tool as
well. And shkoyekh for all the interesting stuff printed
lately!

Gus Grannan:  the sentence is bad, because Yiddish follows
what's called the verb-second constraint.  The tensed verb
must (generally) be the second constituent in the sentence.
In U. Weinreich's _College Yiddish_ you'll see this
formulated as:  the inflected verb must be the second (or
in no position after the second) "sentence unit" of the
sentence.  nokhn bentshn [note: no second _e_ in proper
transliteration/transcription] is the prepositional phrase
which is in first position, so the inflected/tensed verb
must come after it, in second position.  A basic of Yiddish
word order.  By the way, you say there are no informants in
your area.  Where are you?  Maybe I can shatkhn you up with
some.

I'd be happy to have people share Yiddish versions of ekhod
mi yedeye/Ehad Mi Yodea.  The one I know (famous thanks to
recordings by Moyshe Oysher and Theodore Bikel) is:

        mo adabro, mo asapro
	ay-day...
	ver ken zogn, ver ken redn
	vos di eyns/tsvey/dray/... batayt, vos di ... batayt

	eyner iz dokh got 
	un got iz eyner 
	un vayter keyner

	tsvey zaynen di lukhes
	un eyner iz dokh got, etc.

And the whole progression:

	draytsn iz bar-mitsve
	tsvelf zaynen di shvotim
	elf zaynen di shtern
	tsen zaynen di gebot
	nayn zaynen di khadoshim
	akht iz der bris
	zibn zaynen di vokhnteg
	zeks zaynen di mishnayes
	finef zaynen di khumoshim
	fir zaynen di imes
	dray zaynen di oves
	tsvey zaynen di lukhes
	un eyner iz dokh got 
	un got iz eyner 
	un vayter keyner
	hey!

There's another version with the refrain "eyn got, undzer
got" but I don't know the rest.  This version, I think, is
related to the ekhod mi yedeye that the yekes (German Jews)
sing which has in its refrain "... unser Gott, was er lebt
un was er schwebt".  The parody of this that the
mizrekh-yidn [Eastern European Jews] sing (I think printed
in the classic 1901 collection of Yiddish folksongs by
Ginzburg and Marek) is:  eyns iz a yidene, nit zi lebt un
nit zi shvebt. Anyone know these?  (Incidentally, the
Ginzburg-Marek edition has just been reprinted by Bar-Ilan
Univ. with a foreword and other research tools, under the
editorship of Prof. Dov Noy.)

A question to all Philadelphians, and also to all
non-Philadelphians [!]:  in Adir Hu, I've heard
American-born Jews from Philadelphia substitute a funny
English line for the second verse of the loshn-koydesh
original:

        adir hu, adir hu, yivne beysoy bekoroyv
               [or _ou_ instead of _oy_]
        leave them alone and they'll come home
               wagging their tales behind them
	eyl beney, eyl beney, beney beyskho bekoroyv

Is this familiar to anyone?  What the heck is it?!

With regard to the song "tsar nikolay", it's familiar to me
only in the Slavic version, sung by a Yiddish-dominant
woman who didn't know the exact meaning of the "dirty
words":

        tsar nikolay
	yotfoyamot [distorted from: yop tvoyu mat']
	moya zhona rozetshka [?] kapitan

The question mark stands for two uninterprettable
syllables.  The obscenity is Russian, but the rest is
Polish, right Bob Rothstein? [moja z.ona Rozeczka...] It
seems that the severity of Russian curses incorporated into
the vocab of Israelis has been lost. (And not just among
Israelis but, apparently, Eastern European
Yiddish-speakers, as evidenced by my info from this singer
and from the references to the utterance of these curses by
numerous koshere yidishe tekhter, mothers of our own
Mendele-khevre.)  A middle-aged acquaintance of mine, of
Bukharan-Israeli origin, uses the curse:  shetelekh kibeni
(Mod. Heb.: 'may you go kibeni').  yop tvoyu mat' has
become yotfoyamot (stress on final syllable) in the
repertoire of an Israeli male I know, who also doesn't know
its exact (or approximate, for that matter) meaning.
Yiddish has the curse, which now I see is probably related:
gey tsu dayn feter beni 'go to your Uncle Benny' (this
version is in my family).  I never understood it before,
and especially since there is no male first name _beni_ in
our dialect.  (If anything, it would be [benyi].)  In
Stutchkoff's _oytser fun der yidisher shprakh_ ['Thesaurus
of the Yiddish Language'], whenever this Benny guy is
mentioned, an asterisk appears next to the word, meaning:
vulgar.  I guess it all comes together now.  _feter beni_
is the interpretation by Yiddish-speakers of the similar
sounding Russian words.
