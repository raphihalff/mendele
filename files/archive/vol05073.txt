Subject: Nitl

Mikhl Herzog's proposed etymology for "nitl" would apply nicely - for
Easter. Christmas, of course, celebrates the birth...

Subject: _Jerusalem of Lithuania_

Just read Andy Cassel's transcription of his conversation with Josef
Levinson and thought I would add my comments.  I just returned from two
weeks in Lithuania and, on the recommendation of Andy, visited the
offices of _Jerusalem of Lithuania_.

I was impressed with the spirit and hard work that Josef Levinson, David
Leibzon, and the others are putting into producing this newsletter about
Jewish life in Lithuania.  It is printed in Lithuanian, Yiddish, English
and Russian and strives to tell the tale of Jewish life as it is now as
well as before the Holocaust.

It can't be easy to maintain a newspaper in a community with only 6000
Jews, many of them looking to leave for Israel and the U.S. Our support,
financial as well as moral, is needed if this effort is to succeed.  You
can subscribe to _Jerusalem of Lithuania_ for $50 a year.  It appears
monthly.  Write to them at Pylimo St 4, Vilnius, Lithuania (tel 227917,
fax 370 2 227 915).

Subject: Yiddish teachers needed

My name is Nathan Pinskier. I am a 37 year old doctor from Melbourne
Australia. I am also the treasurer of a small primary Yiddish day school
(230 students). As far as I am aware, our school is the only Yiddish day
school in the world.

Melbourne has a vibrant Jewish community with over 5000 native Yiddish
speakers. Unfortunately they are aging and it is therefore becoming
increasingly difficult to find younger Yiddish speaking teachers to
continue our work.

With this in mind, the school has decided to organise an intensive
Yiddish Summer School (in December - Jan 1996). We are looking for
participants and suggestions.

My brother Henry and his wife Marcia are currently attending a Yiddish
Summer School at Oxford University in England.

Mrs Bobby Zylberman (an expatriate New Yorker and current Yiddish teacher
at our school) suggested that Sheva Zucker might be able to assist.

If you have any suugestions please contact me.

The school would be very interested in cortributing to the Web pages.

Subject: Skotsl kumt, vider a mol

Even though this subject "came and went", it happens that just this week
I came across two examples in print:  firstly, in a chapter of  Mendele's
*Fishke der Krumer*, wherein the "royter gonif" has trapped Fishke in a
cellar and while gloating, notices that he is being overheard and, among
other statements, says "skutsl kumt".

Today I saw an illustration  in Carl Lowe's book *Three Centuries of
Jewish Life in America* (pub. 1992, page 84) of a front page of the
Forward (Vol. I, No. 125) where an article is headed "skatsl kumt"; the
secondary heading of the article states "lauis lemmer iz do".
Unfortunately, the subsequent smaller print is too difficult for me to
read.

Subject: Transliteration

In Mendele 5.071, in the course of an interesting discussion about
Yiddish nowadays, Miriam Isaacs mentions, as an aside, that she finds it
awkward, in Latin letters, to sound Litvish.

My reaction is, why would she want to sound Litvish? Texans don't try to
sound like New Yorkers, and New Yorkers don't try to sound like New
Englanders.  The speech of educated Americans is equally acceptable
everywhere, despite the dialectal differences.  The same, I would think,
should hold for Yiddish.

The transliteration system employing Latin letters is like a sound
recording.  When used correctly (i.e., according to a consistent set of
rules) it faithfully records the words the way the writer pronounces
them.  The rules (the "YIVO" system) may appear complicated as given with
great precision in the introduction to the Weinreich dictionary, but it
can be summarized quite simply as follows:

       The vowels:  It's "a" as in car, "e" as in set, "i" as in ski,
"o" as in horse, and "u" as in ruler.  Also "ay" as in Mayan, "ey"
as in they, and "oy" as in toy.

       The consonants:  It's "sh" as in shoe, "zh" as the z in azure,
"g" as in good, and "s" as in salt.

       Special consonents: "kh" is the throat-clearing sound, and
"r" is pronounced the French way.  (The Russian r is less common, but
acceptable .)

       Letters not used: c, j (by itself), q, w, and x.

       Letters not mentioned are pronounced as in English.

The beauty of the system is that you can make the reader pronounce the
words your way.  If you write "Vays ikh vues!" that's how we'll read it
-- and we won't twist it into "Veys ikh vos!"  or any other unwanted
variant.

Subject: Yiddish into English

Norm Fishman asks for comments and suggestions as he re-opens an ongoing
debate: that Yiddishkayt be transmitted in English.

Such a shayle could turn us all into Tevyes doomed to see both sides:
wishing for perpetuation at any price, yet, on the other hand, demanding
Yiddish remain vital, lively, pure, and clear as a diamond.

Comments:

I find it interesting that it is to Yosl Mlotek and the Arbeter Ring that
he re-addresses this two-headed riddle. In addition to its philosophy of
social justice, the AR, by definition, exists to perpetuate Yiddish. It
has become the classical music of Yiddishkayt, its 'orthodox' movement.
Asking it to embrace Yiddish in translation is like requesting that all
of classical music be 'updated' to hard rock or rap to increase its
audience, or like asking that orthodox synagogues davn in English to
embrace more youths. It would stamp out its raison d'etre.

Within the time-frame the Fishmans visited Mlotek seeking secular
materials, our shula board often rehashed this problem desiring some
English for programming, curriculum, and outreach to the parents (many of
whom did not know what secular Jewishness meant, nor did they know
Yiddish). Our teacher, Yankl Blank, passionate about Yiddish and its
grammar and literature, used to respond. "A gezinte ki git milkh. Oib men
vil fleysh muz men ir derhargenen. Ikh bin nokh gezunt un vel gebn bloiz
Yiddish."

Yosl was presenting his answer by forcing you to speak Yiddish. His
answer, "Get thee to a shula, and learn Yiddish to embrace Yiddishkayt."

Another thought: Just as the National Yiddish Book Center helped assuage
the guilt of discarding the literary treasures of our parents, doesn't
the AR go a long way to giving us a sense of relief or pleasure that
someone somewhere somehow is still minding the store while we write in
the roman alphabet, even on Mendele.

Suggestion:

Turning elsewhere, perhaps, might yield some results for the secular
Yiddishkayt in English you seek. CAJE (the Conference on Alternatives in
Jewish Education) might be of help. It is 15-20 years young. The National
Office is on 35th Street in New York City.
