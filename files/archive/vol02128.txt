Subject: Chagall-llagaCh

The SoHo annex of the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan
currently has an exhibit on Marc Chagall's work for the
Jewish theater in post-revolutionary Russia. In one of his
large pieces, "Introduction to the Jewish Theater", he
shows himself being carried (this is Chagall amusing
himself and us) in the arms of someone named Avrom Efros.
Over the figure of Efros is his name in Yiddish:
ayin-fey-reysh-alef-samekh, written appropriately from
right to left.  Over Chagall is the label
shin-<>-gimel-alef-lamed.

1.  The <> indicates a small cartoon, standing in the place
of the alef, of an artist at an easel.  More amusement.

2.  Still more:  This label is written from left to right,
so that a Yiddish or Hebrew reader would read LAG<>Sh.

Oh, that Marc!

Subject: shikses/white bread

On shikse: the usage I am familiar with is that of my
parents' generation; the younger generation 'would not have
been caught dead' using the word.The Brooklyn neighborhood
we lived in had Jews and Italians - i.e. people of Jewish
and Italian descent  - and very very few others. Italian
women COULD be referred to  - i.e. 'were' - 'shikses', but
the term (as far as I can recollect) was never used for
description or 'neutral' reference. It was used primarily -
exclusively ? - in marriage-related discourses, i.e. in
talking about (inter)marriage, or activities (dating, sex)
that were thought in those days to lead to marriage. I
never heard the term used in a complimentary way (e.g. in
referring to the appearance - blonde hair ) for a Jewish
girl. (There must have been a few fair-haired Jewish girls
around, but none in our family or purview.) The Italians -
South Italians - were similarly dark, and there many
incidents of Jews being taken for Italians by Italians, -
and vice versa.My father, in retailing the horror story of
a mixed marriage of the brother of a friend, used the word
'shikse' for the wife ('goy' would not have been
appropriate, 'talyene(r)' would be used in Yiddish, but not
in English). His usage of the word always seemed to imply
invidious comparison - of the 'shikse' involved, and a
non-specific Jewish girl, with the 'shikse' being
unfavorably compared.If that implication was not wanted the
term 'shikse' would not have been used. A more recent
example (thirty years more recent): my aunt (mid-eighties),
my father's sister, on meeting my son's tall, fair,
non-Jewish girlfriend described her as 'a typical shikse'.
The term was intended as descriptive, - and non-pejorative;
she went on to say favorable things about the girl.But the
use of the word - in addition to its descriptive component
implied a comparison with a Jewish girl: my aunt would have
preferred (and was explicit about it elsewhere) that his
girlfriend(s) be Jewish. The 'descriptive component' - the
stereotype (fairly applicable in this case) was tall,
fair,non-zoftik (thin, with smallish breasts).If no
invidious comparison was intended the physical description
would have to be made - non-stereotypically - explicitly,
and less laconically.

  Intermarriage presupposes social accessibility. If you
ask  'Is Queen Elizabeth  a 'shikse' ?'.I would answer:
'sure, what else could she be ?' Again the interesting
question is when one would use the term (in regard to ER).
I can think of two occasions: l) this one, - in defining
the term  2)in humorous skits, etc that play with - tamper
radically with - her social (and this includes sexual)
accessibility. I can imagine Mel Brooks doing this sort of
thing (maybe he already  has).

White bread: A partial successor and replacement term for
'shikse': my wife describing my other son's tall, thin,
blonde (now ex-)girlfriend - said and this was clearly
disapproving - white bread. (The opposite of 'white bread'
?(Not pumpernickel. Or khale.) other terms on the same
scale(s) ?) Does 'white bread' - a term I don't use - share
the property with 'shikse' of, by definition,  not being
applicable to Jews ? And other 'ethnics' ?The term was used
in this case as a judgment of character, and, secondarily,
background - not of being Jewish , but I have the
impression that for most people who grew up with 'shikse'
(i.e. heard the word used regularly from people close to
them) the term lingers on as a not quite dead option: that
(so to speak)the first decision - in some hypothetical
'tree' of hierarchy of choices - is NOT  to use 'shikse',
and then one selects the word wanted.

Subject: seygl (?)

to: Mikhl Herzog; P?rets Mett

To make it clear for everybody, under Eastern Hungarians I
am referring to those who lived in Eastern Slovakia, the
Carpathian Mountains, or in Northern Transylvania.
Historically most of them had Galitsiayner origins,
although, as our "lurker" Elliot Zak will testify, there
were exceptions. And yes, they pronounced the tsayray
properly. Those whom I met in the synagogues of Budapest
were correcting themselves, because they knew that the
"ey/ay" is not acceptable in "civilized" circles.

I don't remember paying attention to khesed, but I guess,
that would be "khe'sed" too, just as the cake at the
Rebbe's "tish" was le'k*kh (with an undefinable vowel
instead of the pa:sakh). P. Mett's question about Pesakh
made me realize that even Western Hungarian Jews would
pron. it with a tsere. I would bet that there was no
Ashkenazi Jew anywhere (!?!?) who pronounced it as Pe:sakh.
Of course, we should remember that in German tsere is the
norm, as in Regen, Segen, etc., and that may have an
influence, as well.

To sum up: what I was reporting, seems to be a secondary
(late) development, and as such similar to what happened to
the beygel/baygel: By the time it falls onto the Sunday
Times (you know which side is the cream-cheese on), it is
called bagel.

The shift of the stress in emet surprised and disappointed
me at the same time. I thought it was the special privilege
of Hungarian immigrants, especially in Israel, to be
ridiculed for stressing the first syllable and now I learn
that this was done elsewhere, too? And not out of lack of
faith, but out of curiosity: would you say that this
happened to longer words, such as emuneh/emineh, too? It
did in Hungary!!!

Any idea how I could hold of a copy of the article?

Subject: List for Yiddish/Hebrew Computing

Is there a list somewhere that deals with developments in
Yiddish or Hebrew computing (word processing, fonts,
printing, internationization/localization issues, etc.)?

Subject: Pozshornes/porondkes

Could someone please help me translate the following two
 words: "pozshornes" and"porondkes." Though I could not
 find anything similar in a Ukrainian dictionary, they may
 come from Ukrainian.
