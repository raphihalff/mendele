Subject: Mikhl Herzog's recent report - addendum

We thank our colleague Mikhl Herzog for relating this overall information
about the EYDES project to the Mendele community (09.051). The text quoted
by Mikhl Herzog is taken from a conference presentation at Granada (Spain)
and was published in: European Language Resources Assiciation ELRA.
Conference Proceedings. First International Conference on Language
Resources and Evaluation (ELREC), Vol. II. Paris 1998. pp 1045.

Robert Neumann, from the Fîrderverein fÅr Jiddische Sprache und Kultur,
DÅsseldorf, recently returned from Chicago where he met with a group of
linguists to discuss innovations in language technology and new methods for
extracting, exploring and disseminating the information contained in
archives of spoken text (such as the Language and Culture Atlas of
Ashkenazic Jewry). He and Judith L. Klavans, director of the Center for
Research on Information Access (CRIA) at Columbia University, New York, have
initiated a transatlantic cooperation to make accessible and exploit the
holdings of the Yiddish Atlas archive and disseminate its inherent
information. In doing so, they make use and develop the new facilities of
language engineering. For further information please see the relevant
Columbia website
(http://www.columbia/cria/current-projects/Yiddish/yiddish.html), the
relevant talkbank website (http://www.talkbank.org/exploration/index.html)
or, soon again, the website of the Fîrderverein.

Subject: Translation of The Internationale

Dear Mendele subscribers,

I am looking for information about the translation of The Internationale
into Yiddish. Who was the translator? What is the year of translation? Does
it predate the Bund? Is it Bundian? Was it sung only by Bundists, or also by
Jewish communists? Were there any alternative translations? Many Yiddish
speakers in Israel are glad to sing it to me, but nobody seems to know the
answers to my questions. I suspect that early lyrics and music booklets
might have a record of the translator. If anybody is aware of a very early
publication of the anthem, this might also be a pointer.

Thanks,
Ron Kuzar
Haifa

Subject: Yiddishland

Has anyone seen the book--or has information about the book, Yiddishland, by
Gerard Silvain and Henri Minczeles, published by the Gingko Press?  Have you
seen reviews? I've seen an advertisement for it in the New York Review of
Books.

Thank you,  
Yakira Frank

[Moderator's note: Yiddishland is a very nice collection of more than 500
postcards and photographs, originally published by Editions Hazan (Paris,
1999, ISBN 2850256234), and in English translation by Gingko Press (Corte
Madera, CA, 1999, ISBN 1584230185). For more information and to purchase
online this and other new books translated from and about Yiddish go to
http://members.aol.com/dermoykhersforim (features books by David Bergelson,
Roman Vishniac, James Matisoff, Steven Cassidy, David Roskies, Nahma Sandrow
and others).

Interestingly, since the last Mendele discussion on the word Yiddishland
(vols. 07.192, 07.194, 08.001, 08.002, and 08.055) at least three books with
this title were published. Besides Silvain & Minczeles' collection, they
include:

u-vedihot. Tel-Aviv : Y.L. Perets, 1999. 223 p. ISBN 965701221X
and

a. I have red all letters regarding the lyrics of Shmerke Katcherginsky's
"Friling", and will not add a line to it. Instead let me tell you about a
singular happening. Two years ago, the argentine IWO (YIVO) had a great
party to celebrate the appearance of a book in spanish about jews and tango
("Los judios y el tango", written by Jose Judkovsky).
A large and qualifyed number of local artist pay their hommage, but the
highlight of the party was the presentation of the non-jewish Popular Chorus
of La Matanza, who sang IN YIDDISH  a moving version of "Friling". The
"miracle" was possible through Abraham Lichtenbaum, IWO's CEO, who
masterminded the phonetics for the singers.)

b. To Shavit Ben-Arie: Zusman Segalovitch was born in Byalistock, Poland, on
february 26,1884 and suddenly passed away in New York on february 19, 1949.
In the "Leksikon fun der nayer yiddisher literatur" (Biographical dictionary
of modern yiddish literature) edited by Congress for Jewish Culture, Inc.
part 6, you will find full four pages devoted to Segalovitch with all the
data you may need.

From: Hugh Denman <h.denman@ucl.ac.uk>
Subject: Verner's Law

with reference to Nina Warnke query [09.053:9], Verner's Law represents a
modification of Grimm's Law concerning the second Germanic sound shift
[Lautverschiebung]. The process involved began in the extreme south and
rolled northwards over a considerable period until it came to a halt in
attenuated form along the so-called Benrath line. It had the effect of
distinguishing High German from Low German. But we can be sure that this
process had been completed many centuries before the genesis of Yiddish.
Yiddish originated in the south (probably in the upper Danube valley) and so
in common with southern German dialects and standard German is 'high' not
'low', so Verner's Law definitely applies to Yiddish, but not to Dutch (here
Jammie is confusing the first or Germanic Lautverschiebung, which took place
circa 500 BCE and applies to all Germanic languages including English, with
the second or High German Lautverschiebung, which applies only to (standard)
German, southern German dialects, Yiddish and long extinct Langobardish).

Subject: "Mershkuts gevorn" and "a shvarts yor"

In response to Diane Rabson (09.050):

Both of these were quite common in the Byelorussian Litvak idiom of my
grandparents, whose Yiddish was probably very close to that of your
grandparents.

In the first, what you say as "Mershkuts gevorn," you have fused two words
into the first. It is the expression, "Es hot mir skuchneh gevoren." The
word 'skuchneh' comes from the Russian 'skuchaty' which means to grow weary
of something. The expression is an indication that the speaker has become
weary or tired of something, or that something is getting on their nerves. A
synonymous expression is" "Es hot mir tzugegessen gevorn." (In English you
might say I can't stand it anymore).

The second, pertains to the metaphor of "a shvarts yohr,"  literally a
'black year.' It is a metaphor for 'misfortune' (i.e. a black year would be
a misfortune). 'Ale shvartse yorn' is literally then 'all manner of
misfortune.' If you wanted to curse your enemies, you might say, "Aff meine
sonnim ale shvartse yorn.' (My enemies should have all manner of
misfortunes).

From: "A. Joseph Ross" <lawyer@world.std.com>
Subject: Grammar in the younger generation

Bob Wilson mentions that the younger generation of Yiddish speakers, in his
expericence, speaks with a grammar different from that of their parents.

Could this have to do with differences in schooling?  Did the older
generation have schooling in Yiddish, while the younger generation did not?  
Might schools conducted in Yiddish teach Yiddish grammar (or at least the
teachers correct their students' grammar errors)?

I've generally thought that this was the reason for some grammatical change
in English.  A number of rules that I learned in school in the 1950s seem to
be ignored regularly by people younger than I am.  Things like the
distinction between 'its" and "it's," the disappearance of the English
subjunctive ("If that were so" rather than "was"), and the general
acceptance of "snuck" and "alright," both of which I was taught were wrong.  
I've always thought that this was because, starting sometime in the late
1960s, many school systems stopped teaching grammatical rules for awhile.
