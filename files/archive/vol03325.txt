Subject: lernen et al

AL KHET!

Mr. Arnemann is correct regarding lernen, although I am not entirely
incorrect.  "Lernen" means both to "teach" and "Lernen/Lernen zikh" means
"learn".  Eg.  "Lernen a blat gemore."  Also, I erred in saying that
German "kochen" equal Yiddish "kuchen" and German "Kuchen" equals
exclusively the Yiddish "Lekekh".  In fact, although Yiddish has "Kukher"
for German "Koch"(a cook), the verb is "kokhen"(in German, "kochen").  In
addition, Yiddish has "Kukhn" as well as "Lekekh" for "cake".  One place
I did not make a mistake, however, is "kaken".  What is the origin of
"kaken" which means...  Does German have such a word?

Yankel Ekhoyz

PS.  "oyslernen" in Yiddish can mean either "to learn" or "to teach"
according to Weinreich.  According to  my German dictionary, "auslernen"
means "to complete one's apprenticeship".  Again, sorry for speaking
prematurely.

Subject: Sholem Aleichem Letters

Here is the final installment of my translation of Sholem Aleichem's
letters to Mordecai Spector about the preparation of the first Tevye
Story.

Letter six was sent the same day as letter five, Nov. 7, 1894: Sholem
Aleichem addressed it to the typesetter of Hoyz-Fraynd giving detailed
instructions on the desired appearance of the type faces and page
ornamentations.

Letter seven

Kiev, November 10, 1894

Dear Colleague M. Spector!

     Greetings!  Reb Tevye has arrived!...

     Mazl tov!  At last I send you, with God's help, the rest of the
yarn.  I don't want to hold on to it any longer, otherwise I might begin
to look it over again.  A hunger to revise it will seize me; actually, I
will yearn to redo the whole thing.  Now, let us hear what you think of
Tevye.  You are the first to meet him. Please excuse this meager
offering. [in Russian] What we have, we give. A good day, and a good
eternity,

Your best companion and best friend, Sholem Aleichem

Letter eight

Kiev, November 24, 1894

Dear Brother!

     Here are the corrected proofs.  There are quite a few misprints; but
it is the first set of proofs.  Compared to proofs from Berdichev, it
must be considered good [Spector's printer was in Warsaw].  Fix the
errors as I indicate without fail.  It is hard to get approval of proofs
from the Kiev censor, and I don't have a clean copy of the manuscript.
Let the Warsaw censor deal with it.

     I received the proofs at dusk.  Now, ten o'clock at night, they are
already on their way to you.  So, what else do you want from me?

     Please, don't be too upset about your critical opinion of Tevye.
The world of Yiddish readers is sure to like him.  Either that world has
better judgment than you do, or no judgment at all.

Your Sholem Aleichem.

These are all the published letters I know of re: the preparation of the
first Tevye piece.  In my next post, I will send a paragraph from this
original 1894 version which does not appear in the revised 1918 Folksfond
Oysgabe (New York) version which appeared first in 1903 (Warsaw).  As
most Mendlnitses and Mendlnikes might know, the title was changed from
Tevye Der Milkhiker (1894) to Dos Groyse Gevins (1903).

Subject: Retonde or rotonde

In response to Elyet Gertl's frage on behalf of someone reading Motl
Peysi dem Khazns:  Reading Yiddish in Malaysia?  Wonderful! Alexander
Harkavy's dictionary does not list retonde in the main part.  However,
the section with additional words lists retonde and tells you to see
rotonde (p. 578).  There it is defined as "round cloak."  Okay, but mit
vos est men a round cloak?  Harkavy knew, I suppose.  In any case it is
some kind of cloak.  A little bit of help.  Thanks for calling on me,
Elyet.

Subject: Telzer yeshiva

I believe they refer to themselves in english script as the "Telsher"
Yeshiva.  I've never understood this.  Do any Mendeleniks know if this is
a regional pronunciation, or if it is simply a slippage in translitera-
tion?
