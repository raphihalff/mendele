i don't know anything about his personal life except that
he's dead and that he was the father of joel grey (the
actor in cabaret, among other things).

many of his old records are available on cassette. if you'd
like them and can't find them down under, let me know and i
can send you some.

but, if you like mickey katz, you'll love menasha skulnik.
do you know of him? his old records are likewise available
on cassette. and, believe it or not, i've transcribed a
bunch of his songs and can send you my transcriptions. (it
was for a study i did on language-mixing--vos den?) let me
know. (they're on-line--it would be no problem to send
them.) i have some transcriptions of mickey katz too, now
that i think of it.

Some news on Mickey Katz.  Mickey Katz was a little older
than I, a graduate of Glenville High School in Cleveland
Ohio in the early 40s.  You know his son Joel Grey, a
graduate of Heights High School in Cleveland.  Mickey had a
band, quasi-klezmir, played weddings and bar mitzvahs in
the Cleveland area, and also did club dates as a "big"
dance band.  He was not bad, had a couple of shots at
national status but didn't quite measure up.  Back when I
worked at radio station WJMO in Cleveland as commercial
announcer for "Jackele the Jockele," Cleveland's only
Jewish disk jockey, we would feature Mickey Katz records.
Katz also did the obligatory Catskill summer shows and was,
for a time, regular band at Herman Pirchner's Alpine
Village until the Jewish-German began to look too peculiar.

Myron (Mickey) Katz dictated an autobiography, Papa, Play
for Me: The Hilarious, Heartwarming Autobiography of
Comedian and Bandleader Mickey Katz / by Mickey Katz, as
told to Hannibal Coons; introduction by Joel Grey.
Published by Simon and Schuster in 1977. I believe that the
entertainer Joel Grey, perhaps best known for his role in
CABARET, is Katz's son. Katz also composed for clarinet and
several of his works were performed at a New York jazz
festival in January, 1990.

As I recall, his most commercially successful recordings
consisted of faryiddisht versions of popular songs. Who can
forget Die Geshrey fun der Vilder Katschke, to the tune of
The Song of the Wild Goose? I wish that I could, but that's
a matter of personal taste. A Seymour Rechtzeit he wasn't.

I heard a good deal of Mickey Katz's work in the forties.
He was a prominent member of that school of Jewish
entertainers whose main contribution, in MY opinion, was a
vulgarization of Yiddish song and story. We all owe him a
debt of gratitude however, as he is the father of Joel
Gray, an artist of very high accomplishments. I don't know
if he is still alive.
