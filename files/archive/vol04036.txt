Subject: Yiddish, German, and dialects

This message is for Harold Orbach, and others, to help out with the
confusion people get into on this subject.

There is no one-to-one correspondence between any particular Yiddish
dialect and any German dialect.

Hochdeutsch is a language that few blue-collar Swiss have mastered. I was
able to pass myself off as a Muenchener when I was only 14 years old (I'm
German/Peruvian/American by the way). Hochdeutsch does in fact mean
highland German, but the highlands being referred to are in the middle,
east middle area around Franconia. South of that area, among other
dialects, are the Allemanisch dialects, which are not mutually
intelligible with the standard. The confusion arises because the word
Hochdeutsch means two comple- tely different things.

1) It is the official name of the "klal-shprakh" that was based on East
Franconian with a good dose of Bavarian and Low German. Yiddish also has
had this infusion of Bavarian, including a similar vowel schema (the
*sounds of the vowels do not correspond, but what I mean is is that
Standard German has collapsed the vowel system from the Middle ages in a
different way from certain dialects. Bavarian and Yiddish don't
necessarily sound the same but the collapsing of the vowel system is more
parallel than with Hochdeutsch. Example: ey vs. ay has blurred in
contemporary Standard German, but in Yiddish there is a big distinction).

2) The other meaning of Hochdeutsch is plain "highlands" German, but not
Allemanisch.

Finally, the other thing we must remember is that until recently,
Standard German was a language native to no one. The Swiss and the
Alsatians have held on tightly to their dialects, partly for political
reasons. Other regions went through a blurring process, where features of
both the Standard and the local patois are integrated into what is
referred to as Umgangsprache. This means: the general language used in
everyday affairs.

I'm glad we're dealing with this. I've put in my two bits and would like
to see more.

Subject: Shlemihl

To Arre Komar:

For a response to your question on von Chamisso's "Peter Schlemihl",
might I suggest you look at the first chapter of Ruth Wisse's book, The
Schlemihl as Modern Hero. Of course this is a cultural more than a
linguistic treatment of the term.

Subject: The Bintel Brief letters

I am an avid genealogist having worked in Jewish genealogy for more than
20 years.  There is a Jewish genealogic bulletin board out of NYSERNET
called JEWISHGEN that is very active and a matter came up today that
needs the concerted brain power of Mendele (which, considering the
quality of many of the postings, is quite something).

I need tell no one on this board about the Bintel Brief letters that were
such an important part of the Forward when it was published in Yiddish. I
subscribe to it in English but they no longer have the column.  I loved
it, though I could not read it.  I had the letters read to me. ("Why
didn't my mother make me learn the piano" is the standard cry of those
who are not Horowitzes today, but in my case it is "Why didn't my mother
make me learn how to read Yiddish!")

In a brief discussion of the genealogic value of those letters on
JEWISHGEN, someone asked, "What ever happened to those letters that
FORWARD would get?"  Of course, my reaction was that they selected a few
to answer, and threw out the rest.

But were those letters available they would make valuable genealogic
source material.  Most of them, when they were printed, would be signed,
"Abandoned in Chicago" or "Alone in Kansas City" or "Pregnant and
deserted in New York."  So who submitted them was generally a mystery.

But what ever happened to the originals?  The submitter was not a mystery
at that level.

Might YIVO have them?  Would the Forward have a basement full of them? I
caution the hasty that had this question been "Whatever happened to all
those Yiddish books that used to be around" and were that question asked
15 years ago, the answer would probably have been, "All lost, probably
destroyed."  But the Yiddish book center in Amherst showed that the stuff
was all over the place.  No one had ever looked for it.

Subject: Translation/Wolitz note response

     Read with great interest Seth Wolitz's note on Singer translations
and Singer's own "adaptations"...Not too much has yet been written on the
phenomena of distortion in translation, but what has been is very
pertinent to Yiddish translation as we know it or do it:  The concept of
"elevation" has been very prevalent in translation from so-called minor
to so-called major languages.  This is true not only for Yiddish.  A very
worthhile discussion of this and related issues can be found in a book
called Translation Studies, Susan Bassnett-McGuire, Methuen, Inc, l980.
Particular reference is made to the school of translation emanating from
Czech., which pioneered in equalitarian translations, and used a political
philosophy as an underpining to this.  Clearly the culture of the
translator, and the era also have profound implications...

     It is also instructive to look at a book which compares the
translations by three prominent poets of one poem, all permeated with the
poetic voice of each of the name-brand poets.  (Can't find the book to
give as source just now.)  So sometimes ego or voice actually intrude on
good translation as well.

     Have recently become a member of Assoc.Lit. Trans. of America.  A
good group, receptive to Yiddish.  (Office:  Univ. of Texas at Dallas,
MC35, Box 830688, EMail ert@UTDallas.edu) Through this contact I have
also learned alot about the publishing business side of translations, in
which publishers often promote irresponsible and/or superificial
translations by prominent authors in order to grab or prime the market
for more indigenous output.  In these cases an anonymous "linguist"
"poems" (yes it's a verb) a text in the worst case scenario...and is
certainly not listed for credit.

     An article I wrote on good translation process, and what is going
on, as it pertains to Yiddish, was recently rejected by Der Pakentreger
as "too specialized but very worthy."

     As the rush to translate Yiddish mounts, so should the discussion of
the translation process, especially for those of us not native speakers.
It's a labor of love.

Subject: Shabbtai Zvi in Yiddish

Being too much in a rush the other day I had very little time to read
"MENDELE" and only glanced at the entries and went on... The
mention/question of Shabbtai Zvi in Yiddish caught my eye for some
reason, and later, while working in the library with a private collection
of Yiddish books I was sorting I found something which may be of interest
to the inquirer...although, I'm embarassed to not remember the source of
the question...

I hope this helps:

I found an interesting article in "TSAYTSHRIFT" ("Zeitschrift")
from 1926, Book 1, Minsk, from the "INSTITUT FAR VAYSRUSLENDISHER
KULTUR" by Dr. M. Weinreich.  The article is called: "A YIDDISH LID
VEYGN SHABTAY TSVI FUN YOR 1666."
The article is broken down into several sections:
1. "der tekst"
2. "der mekhaber"
3. "Yankev Toyst, der shrayber un der mentsh; zayn tekhnik"
4. "oysleyg"
5. "oys'shprakh"
6. "fleksye"
7. "tekst fun lid"

I hope this reference is at all helpful (there are a couple of
bibliographic footnotes in the article itself that might help).
