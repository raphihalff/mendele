Subject: Concordance to the two editions of Weinreich's _Geshikhte_

Anke Kleine, _Parallelisierung von "Maks Vaynraykh: Geshikhte fun der
yidisher shprakh. bagrifn, faktn, metodn (1973)" und der enlischen
Uebersetzung "Max Weinreich: History of the Yiddish Language (1980)_
_Jiddistik-Mitteilungen. Jiddistik in deutssprachigen Laendern_
Sonderheft/November 1998. 

A few years ago the need for an index to Max Weinreich's _Geshikhte fun der
yidisher shprakh_ (1973) was expressed on Mendele. 

Max Weinreich's _Geshikhte fun der yidisher sprakh. Bagrifn, faktn, metodn_
is a standard work on the linguistic history of the Yiddish language. The
four volume work consists of two volumes of text accompanied by two volumes
with notes to the text. The lack of an index has made it difficult to look
up things in this monumental work. 

The English translation by S. Noble and J.A. Fishman (1980) does contain a
detailed index, but the division of chapters and paragraphs is different
from that in the Yiddish edition, so it is still difficult to go use the
English index as an aid to find something in the Yiddish edition.  It is a
pleasure to see that such a concordance between the two editions is now
available. The concordance has been compiled by Ane Kleine, a young Yiddish
scholar at the University of Trier (Germany). It has appeard as a special
issue (Beiheft) to _Jiddistik-Mitteilungen_, the journal on Yiddish Studies
in German speaking countries which is published twice a year by the Yiddish
Department in Trier. 

The concordance helps us to use the index of the English edition to find the
corresponding pages in the text and footnote volumes. 
_Jiddistik-Mitteilungen_ can be found in the library of nearly every
university which offers Yiddish courses and I believe the brochure can also
be ordered separately.

Subject: Mir Zaynen do tsu zingen!

I want to thank either Zalmen Mlotek or Mark Zuckerman (or both) for a most
delightful Yiddish musical experience.  I received the Di Goldene Keyt CD
today and am listening to it as I write.  It is much more than I expected. 
It would make a great Chanukah gift for your grandchildren (and their
parents)!. 

Gut shabbos.

Subject: Meaning of "prokladin"

I've been unable to find the meaning of the word "prokladin," which I
believe is a Yiddish plural noun. I found it in Nahman of Bratzlav's story
"The Cripple." The passage tells of the protagonist (the cripple) and his
two servants being set upon by thieves. The two servants fear to return
home, for they have taken "prokladin" from the thieves and might be put in
chains. I would appreciate any help on this word! 

Thanks

Subject: Shtrayml

David Herskovic asks (8.086) about the origins of "shtrayml".  My guess is
that it's based on the Polish root "stroj" for clothing.  The shtrayml was
in fact the headgear worn by Polish royalty and the nobility up through the
18th Century, and its adoption by some Hasidic courts is striking and ironic
evidence of the modernizing nature of the early movement.

Subject: Leykekh & Shtraymel

To David Herskovic's query:

Shtraymel or Shtraymhitel stems from Middle High German "Streim" or in
diminutive "Streimel" that is strip indicating the furstrip of this hat,
similar to the Spodek. 

Leykekh stems from the German "Lebkuchen", a sort of honeycake or
gingerbread.  But the 2-volume Yiddish-Hebrew dictionary by ABK printed by
L. Beresniak in Paris 1939 prefers the german etymology "Leckerbissen" i.e.
delicacy or titbit. 

Does somebody know who is hiding behind these letters ABK (Alef-Bet-Kof).
The author dedicated his dictionary to his Wife Feyge, who died shortly
before.

Subject: Wolf Tambur

This is in response to a recent inquiry on Mendele about the Romanian
Yiddish author, Wolf Tambur. 

Wolf Tambur passed away in Jerusalem at the age of 89 on September 20, 1995. 
He resided in Jerusaslem for the last decade of his life. This information
was supplied by his wife.

Fefer.

Subject: ANOTHER MODERN BROKHE OVER THE COMPUTER AND "MENDELE"

       A LOYB UN GEZANG

A loyb un gezang far di hent un di moykhes,

A song and a praise to the hands and brains
The creators of the electronic machine;
Blessed be the achievement -- computer --
with the "hardware and software*" within.

Particularly blessed be the computer specialists
Who organized the "MENDELE" list,
They named the network after our "Zeyde"
and united globally all with Yiddish interest.

Blessed be young and old Mendelyaner,
Those who write, who read or add anything;
A great appreciation to all the veterans  
And those who invest much effort today.

The electronic magic box brings us together
 From every Terra  corner -- its a great goal;
Even our quarrels will never break
The unity of our growing Yiddish network.

* In Yiddish the words "harte un veykhe" have a double meaning: (1)"hard
and soft" and (2)"illegally traded "American dollars and English pounds".


Zayt ale gezunt!

Subject: Nineteen to the Dozen translated by Ted Gorelick

I have just read a very moving book entitled, Nineteen to the Dozen. It
contains early and not well known stores by Sholem Aleichem. It is
translated by Ted Gorelick who also tranlated "Fishke the Lame in Tales" in
the book, Mendele the Book Peddler. 

The stories in Nineteen to the Dozen bring me back to table of my
grandmother.  Although I was very young, she told me tales like these over a
glass of tea.  Tales from Poland and tales from the cities -- she was a
china painter and traveled all over. She gave me a great love of Yiddish --
although I have not mastered it. In "Nineteen to the Dozen" both men and
women tell their own tales. Some of these people are well to do and others
very poor. Their stories provide a very poignant portrayal of what life was
like in the shtetl. 

Both Nineteen to the Dozen and Mendele the Book Peddler have received
extraordinary praise by the NY Times.
