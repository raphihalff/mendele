Subject: Warshavsky wrote Oyfn Pripetshik

Zayt mir moykhl.  Mayn entfer iz nisht azoy tsu der tsayt.  A Mendelnik
hot gefregt, "Ver hot geshribn Oyfn Pripetshik?"  Ikh hob gemeynt az a
sakh Mendelnikes veysn, un emetser andersh vet bald entfern.

Anyhow, Oyfn Pripetshik was written by Mark M. Warshavsky.  Sholem
Aleichem wrote an introduction to a 1900 edition of Warshavsky's songs.
He described how the circle of friends of lawyer Mark Warshavsky (the
circle included Sholem Aleichem) heard the composer sing his own songs.
They discovered that the songs had not been written down.  Sholem
Aleichem and the other friends persuaded Warshavsky to put them in
writing and publish them.  Thanks to their efforts we have Oyfn
Pripetshik.  It has attained the status of a folk song just as Sholem
Aleichem predicted in his introduction.

In "Tsvey Anti-Semitn" (by Sholem Aleichem), two lone Jews on a train
signal their common bond by joining in singing Oyfn Pripetshik.

Subject: Re: "Belz", "Oyfn Pripetshik"

David Ferleger asked about the origin of these two songs.  "Belz, Mayn
Shtetele Belz" - music: Alexander Olshanetsky; lyrics: Jacob Jacobs.
"Oyfn Pripetshik" is by Mark M. Warshawsky.  I'd like to be able to claim
Warshawsky as a relative, but I can't ;-) .  By the way, I have a 1918
edition of Warshawsky's songs (with the 1900 and the 1914 forwards by
Sholem Aleykhem) which has the title of this song as "Der Alef-Beys".

Subject: Prokofiev/Shostakovich

On the subject of Prokofiev's "Overture on Yiddish Themes":  I can't
confirm this, but I once heard that Prokofiev later denied the music's
Jewishness. This is a strong contrast to Shostakovich, who put his soul
into his Jewish compositions and stood by his creations. His most
obviously Jewish piece, the "Jewish Song Cycle," was written in 1948 but
was not released until 1955 (two years after Stalin's death). Other
Shostakovich compositions with Jewish-sounding melodies are his fourth
and eighth string quartets, his second piano trio, and his 13th symphony
(which is based on poems by Yevtushenko -- Shostakovich conceded to the
government for this one and changed the words to relate it to all
humanity rather than to just Jews).

I am doing research for a paper about Shostakovich's relationship with
Russian Jews (including Mikhoels and Benjamin Fleishman), and the Jewish
community's reaction to his use of Jewish themes. If anybody has
information about any aspect of this, please e-mail me. Because I can't
read Russian, I am limited in my research capabilities to English and
Yiddish sources. Were any Yiddish language periodicals published in the
Soviet Union between 1944 and 1956?

Subject: Re: "Ale Brider" and "Hey Zhankoye"

To Andrew Cassel:  (Mendele Vol 4.176)

"Ale Brider" is an adaptation of a poem by Morris Winchevsky, "Un mir
davnen fun eyn sider...Frum un link fareynikt ale...vi der khumesh mit di
rashi, vi der kugl mit di kashe..."  Folklorist A. Litvin notes that the
song "was the most popular folksong that was sung in the old country,
mostly at Bundist parties...Each time it was sung something was added by
each singer extemporaneously."

You can find the music and words of"Ale Brider," in Yiddish, English, and
transcription on page 160 of "Mir Trogn a Gezang" and 154 in "Favorite
Yiddish Songs," both published by the Workmen's Circle.

Un mir zaynen ale brider, oy, oy, ale brider.
Un mir zingen sheyne lider, oy, oy, oy.

Un mir haltn zikh in eynem, oy, oy, zikh in eynem,
Un mir haltn zikh in eynem, oy, oy, oy.

Tra-la-la Tra-la-la.  Tra-la-la Tra-la-la.
Tra-la-la-la la  Tra-la-la-la.

Un mir zaynen ale eynik, oy, oy, ale eynik!
Tsi mir zaynen fil tsi veynik, oy, oy oy!

Un mir libn zikh dokh ale, oy, oy, zikh dokh ale!
Vi a khosn mit a kale, oy, oy, oy!

Un mir zaynen freylekh, munter, oy, oy, freylekh munter!
Zingen lider, tantsn unter, oy, oy, oy.


"Hey! Zhankoye" can be found on page 83 of "The Yiddish Song Book" by
Jerry Silverman, published by Stein and Day, New York.  "Zhankoye was a
Jewish settlement in the Crima in the 1930s. It was completely destroyed
by the Germans during the war."  J. Silverman includes quitar chords with
the melody line, English and English transcription of the Yiddish.

Az men fort kayn Sevastopol iz nit vayt fon Simfereopol
 Dortn iz a stantsiye faran.
Ver darf zuchen naye glikken  s'iz a stantsiye an antikel,
 In Zhankoye, zhan, zhan, zhan.

(Chorus)  Hey Zhan, hey Zhankoye, Hey Zhanvili, hey Zhankoye, hey
Zhankoye, zhan, zhan, zhan.

Entfert Yidn oyf mayn kashe:  Vi'zmayn brider, vi'z Abrashe?
 S'geyt bay im der traktor vi a ban.
Di Mime Leye ba der kosilke,  Beyle bay der molotilke,
 In Zhankoye, zhan, zhan, zhan.       (Chorus)

Ver zogt az Yidn kenen nor handlen,  essen fette yoich mit mandlen
 Nor nit zayn arbetsman?
Dos kenen zogen nor di sonim  Yidn, shpayt zey on in ponim!
 Yut a kuk oyf zhan, zhan, zhan.       (Chorus)

Subject: Oyfn boydem

In Mendele 4.175 Arre Komar asks about the song "Ot, ot, ot azoy est di
tzig fin dakh dem hoy".  My recollection of the song is incomplete, but
maybe it can trigger the memeory of other Mendelniks.

Oyfn boydem

Oyfn boydem shloft der dakh
tzugedekt mit shindelekh.
Un i vigl shloft a kint
naket gor oyn vindelekh.
Hop, hop, ot azoy
est di tsig fin dakh dem stroy.

Oyfn boydem shteyt a vig,
vigt sikh do a shpin in ir.
[two lines missing]
Hop, hop...

Oyfn boydem shteyt a hon
un zain kam is faierroyt.
Sul di vaib ergets borgn
far di kinder a shtikl broyt.
Hop hop...
