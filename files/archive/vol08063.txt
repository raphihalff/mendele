Subject: Introduction

thank you for subscribing me to your list.

i was born in paterson, new jersey, a town of lodz immigrants, although they
say my maternal grandmother actually came from noveradomsk.

i do not speak a fluent yiddish, but have a great passion for and interest in
the language. recently, my mother died, and i am trying to find out the
meaning and origin of certain expressions that she used often.

is this the right place for this kind of thing?

Subject: Rosh Hashone on Mendele

Haynt iz Rosh Hashone.

Born and bred in Yiddishland, davening was not in our curriculum, and my
experiences in shul were limited to climbing the steep stairs to visit my zise
bobes and tantes; I was blind to the ritual or sidur. Yet, the memories are
sweet, filled with wet kisses and Yiddish terms of endearment - mame sheyne,
oytser, Mirele zis kind.....

Oyf der elter, in my daughter's Reconstructionist shul, after kadish is
recited, we are called upon to call out names of people we hold dear and wish
to be remembered and blessed.

So for Rosh Hashone on Mendele, I call out, loud and clear -- Zellig Bach --
dear friend to many of us, whose sight sadly is diminished. For years, he lit
up our sky, enhancing Mendele and Der Bay (Remember The Best of Bach?) with
so much Yiddishkayt - anecdotes, mayselekh, definitons, derivations, insights
galore. We all learned from him and grew deeper and breyter vi lenger with
his postings. He cannot see to read Mendele anymore, but his caretaker can
read cards to him (the address will be sent by request).  Start the year with
a mitzve.... 

I also call out Dvosye Seidman Bilik whose book and articles can never replace
her well of knowledge and feeling, her panache and dynamic beauty.

And Shleyme Axelrod - so sincere a libhober and leader of the perpetuation of
Yiddish. Aza guter, ziser Litvak!

May we all go forward into the New Year in good health and enjoy life's
treasures,

Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan

Subject: Feygele

In regard to the discussion of the origin of the female name "Feygele", I can
offer some further suppport for Mikhl Herzog's etymology:  the regional
Austrian and Bavarian term for violet is still "Veigerl" (the V being
pronounced F ). I've been using it all my life -- as do most people of
Austrian or Bavarian backgrounds.

Subject: yiddish in israel

Lucas Bruyn queries my tiresome comments about Yiddish in Israel and Yiddish
as a Foreign language. 

Most earnest Yiddishists in Israel feel exactly as I do -- that there is
something wrong with the very idea of Yiddish being treated as a foreign,
therefore alien language. (The example of English as a lingua france in
India/Pakistan is lopsided. English was a superimposed Colonial language
brought by the conquerors. Yiddish was the mother tongue of most of the
founders of the modern state of Israel and of the literature that galvanized
many of the early Pioneers and supporters of a Jewish State -- even those who
chose later to develop Hebrew as the only language.)  The complaint about the
status of Yiddish was a running refrain at the conference in Israel this
summer (8th Annual Conference for Yiddish and Yiddish Culture -
Ashkelon/Jerusalem). We see Yiddish as the soul of Ashkenazic Jewry for
arguably 1000 years, give or take a few -- the language of 5 million who
perished in the Holocaust -- certainly worthy of better treatment. 

As to the more concrete issues -- I provided Mendele with an abstract from a
new study on language policy and reality in Israel which delineates the shift
from essentially unilingual to mutilingual policies and this takes in Yiddish
as well. But -- thanks to my computer problem - I must ask the moderator to
provide the publication number on Mendele. As to the money in question, it
was not handed over to the designated authorities. I also provided to Mendele
the name of the Minister of Education, Culture and Sport - Itzkhak Levi, from
the Orthodox community which runs its own independent schools, not covered by
the law. The Ladino matching funds were handed over to the parallel
authorities. Ask Minister Levi where the money mandated for Yiddish secular
education is, my friend -- that's the burning question !!!! 

Happy New Year,

Subject: Yiddish in Israel as a foreign language

I just happened to be looking at this book: Language, Identity, and Social
Division: The Case of Israel, by Eliezer Ben-Rafael (Oxford, 1994), and I
want to suggest that anyone interested in the questions that've been being
discussed on Mendele will find lots of concrete, interesting, and relevant
information in it.  For instance, in surveys conducted in Israel in the late
1980's (I think), Yiddish was ranked lower than English, French, Arabic,
Spanish, and German in answer to the question, "What are the three languages
you would like your child to know?".  Yiddish ranked higher in "beauty" than
all languages except French and Spanish (excluding Hebrew from
consideration).  The book contains many (tons!) other statistical and
anecdotal types of information.  Any suggestions as to how Yiddish should be
taught and promoted in Israel are pointless without reference to what
Israelis actually think about it.

Subject: Sholem Asch on tape

Sylvia is on target about Moe Asch and Folkways. Going a step further, there
exists a Folkways Record Album #35505, 1977, The Smithsonian Institute -
Sholem Asch Statement - Lecture at Columbia University, 1952

It is exciting to hear his voice, to hear him speak - passionately and
honestly. He addresses the condemnation of him, for writing The Nazarene, The
Apostle, at the hands of the readers who had loved and honored him. 

One quote from the tape:  "I wanted to show Jew and Christian alike, the
kinship, the relationship, the brotherhood. You are not a stranger to me; I
am a relative of yours; you are a relative of mine -- and thank God I
succeeded! I succeeded among Jews and among Christians....."

Subject: Yiddish theater in N.Y. - 1939-1945

Between 1939 and 1945, I appeared in several Yiddish theater productions in
N.Y.C.  These included: Fall 1939 - Goldele dem Beker's, produced by Herman
Yablokoff, and starring Yablokoff, Menashe Skulnick, u.a.v. ; Fall 1940 - Der
Mensh Fun Morgn, produced by Samuel Goldenberg, and starring Goldenberg,
David Opatoshu, u.a.v. ; Fall 1942 - Oy, iz Dus a Leben, produced by Molly
Picon and her husband, Yakob Kalich, starring the two of them; Spring 1943 -
Der Reikher Feter, produced by Menashe Skulnick, and starring Skulnick,
Miriam Kressyn, Mikhal Mikhalesko, u.a.v.; Fall 1943 - Dos Goldene Land,
produced by Yehudah Bleikh, and starring Leo Fuchs, Ludvig Zatz, Aaron
Lebedeff, Dina Halpern, u.a.v.; Fall 1944 - A Guter P'sireh, produced by
Skulnick, and starring Skulnick, Kressyn, Max Kletter, u.a.v. 

Unfortunately, my parents did not think to keep a scrapbook, a folder, or
anything to record my stage experience.  I was a young boy at the time,
between 8 and 14 years of age.  Frankly, it didn't strike me until years
later that I had had the unique privilege of performing with the "greats" of
the Yiddish theater of my time. 

I have been trying for some time to locate memorabilia of these shows.  I
travelled to N.Y. ( I live in Florida), where I found nothing helpful at
YIVO, nor at the theater branch of the N.Y. Public Library in Lincoln Center,
and I was told by the president of the Jewish Actors Union that they don't
maintain archives. 

What I am hoping is that, tzvishn di mendelyaner, di emise yidishistn, there
must be someone who has, or knows where to find, memorabilia ( such as a
program, a still photograph, a newspaper review) of those shows, or is that
period of Yiddish theater farloyren oyf eybik?

Subject: The _Forverts_

On page 10 of the current issue of the Yiddish _Forverts_ (Friday, Sept.
25th)  there is a cryptic heading to the main article in the section called
"In Der Velt fun Yidish."  The heading reads as follows:  "Vegn dem festival
fun 1010U?."  The "U" has an umlaut over it and there is a rather large space
between the "fun" and the "1010U?."  I'm rather poor at cryptanalysis and
would be grateful if any reader of the _Forverts_ who was able to decipher
this would let me know if this is indeed a cryptogram.
