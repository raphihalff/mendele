Subject: Introduction

We are Bob and Molly Freedman. Bob is a senior partner in a Philadelphia
law firm and Molly is the office manager and salesperson in a center city
real estate brokerage firm owned by their son.

In our spare time we have assembled, currently maintain and constantly
add to a Judaic audio library which is now approximately 1700 LP's,
cassettes and CDs. Approximately 60% of the collection are recordings of
"Yiddish Music" or recitations and most of the remainder is Hebrew. We
are interested primarily in Yiddish recordings.

The collection has been catalogued and information dealing with each
album "cut" can be retrieved by title, author, composer, performer, first
line or subject matter. The database also will identify publications in
which original text, translation, transliteration and melody line of the
recorded song or poem can be located. The database is multilingual. Infor
Information is entered in English, Yiddish, Hebrew and transliteration.

Bob is also interested in incorporating Yiddish into the computer and is
able toenter, display and print hard copy of Yiddish, Hebrew and English
in almost any DOS program. We use WordPerfect 60.a and Dbase 4.15.

We also have several thousand 78RPM recordings but these have not been
archived.They will have to wait for our retirement or a young ambitious
musicologist.

Subject: Introduction

It took about five tries to join this list as I'm fairly new to internet
and get confused with all the different addresses and commands.

I'm a 47 year old teacher librarian  who has been living in Australia for
the past 22 years.  Originally, I was born in Brooklyn, NY and lived in
California before I immigrated to Australia. I am married to a wonderful
man of Welsh descent and have a 20 year old daughter Erica, two grown
stepchildren and two step grandsons.

You can't tell by my Anglo-Saxon surname, but I am Jewish, though I am
not a practicing Jew. My parents spoke Yiddush at home, and I can
understand spoken Yiddush even though I can't really speak it myself.

I have read all of Isaac B. Singer's books, stories by Sholom Alechem and
enjoyed other books by Yiddush writers, and I joined this group because I
want to get in touch again with my Yiddushkeit.

Hope to get to know some of you soon.

Subject: Introduction and klal Yiddish

I have been lurking in the Mendele shadows for awhile, reading my morning
Mendele news, feeling the joys of knowing there is a community of folks
who love Yiddish and are keeping it alive and lively.  I am working on a
dissertation in clinical psychology on the Yiddish lullabies which were
written during the Holocaust. (A labor of love.  Fortunately there are
enlightened advisors who see that this is a worthy task even for a
psychology student.)  I have found much in Mendele to help me in this.

Regarding Zellig Bach's invitation to comment on his 9/8 posting on
making efforts to use standard Romanization:  What I know of Yiddish is
mostly self taught and for a beginning Yiddishist, it is very helpful
when the Romanization corresponds to the actual Yiddish spelling of
words.  This enables beginners like me to look up words and have an
inking about how to pronounce them more or less understandably.  The YIVO
rules for transliteration are remarkably straightforward and consistent
(especially compared to English spelling).

I can see though, that for people who come by their Yiddish from having
heard it spoken, naturally in other words, and never had the opportunity
to learn to write it or read it, Romanization could present a challenge.
Having some reasonable rules to follow like YIVO's might be quite useful.
It would also enable Mendelniks with a dialectological bent to discover
where y'all are coming from (s'cuse pun) since it would be clear what
sounds were being represented by your ey's, ay's, oy's, etc. (as opposed
to various ejs, eis, ie's, ea's, ai's, aj's, oi's, oj's, etc.)

A gut yor, a zis yor, un a sheynem dank an alemen.

Subject: Oyneg Yiddish Workshop Not This Year

I am posting here_with permission_ a letter I rec'd from the coordinator
of the Toronto Yiddish conference.

Zelig B"k

Dear Dr. Bach:

With reference to your "Oyneg Yiddish Proposal" (4.092)   regarding a
_unified_name for all Yiddish Clubs and your suggestion of a workshop
about it during this year's Second International Conference of Yiddish
Clubs, I regret to say that our workshops have already been organized and
there is no room for one more workshop on this year's agenda.

My suggestion:  It be raised at the next Conference which, I hope, will
take place in 1996.

Mit frayntshaft,

Bess Shockett,  Conference Coordinator

Subject: Romanized Yiddish

As a librarian, I'm used to thinking of the romanization tables of the
Library of Congress as the standard.  At Harvard, because we now use the
Library of Congress system of cataloguing, our Judaica Dept. romanizes
all Yiddish names and titles for our on-line catalogue according to the
LC table for Hebrew and Yiddish.  As far as I know, most major American
university libraries do likewise.  This means that, for example, we spell
"mekhaber" (Weinreich) as "mehaber" with a subdot under the "h". Although
I don't want to get into an argument about the relative merits of
Weinreich vs. LC, it does seem to me that the usage of major American
libraries must at least count as a standard.

Would someone therefore please tell me where this other standard comes
from?  Is there an official YIVO pronouncement on the question or is it
just a matter of custom?  Does Weinreich follow it exactly or does he
depart from it at some points?

Subject: A piece of business

Someone wrote yesterday for help in changing his address.  Unfortunately
my reply went astray and the original is lost.  So is my memory.  This
will have to do.  It may be useful to others as well.  It will certainly
help your shames whose mailbox fills up with bounced mail to dead
addresses.

If you know that an address change is imminent, _please_ unsubscribe
_before_ the change.  The incantation is simply:

unsub mendele

and is sent to:

listserv@yalevm.ycc.yale.edu

After the change, please send to the same address:

sub mendele first_name last_name

A sheynem dank aykh.
