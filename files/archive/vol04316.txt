Subject: Blinde-Ovnt

Further to Bob Rothstein's suggestions on how the Ukrainian "Holy
Evening" [Sviatyi Vechir] became Yiddish "Blind Evening", I would
conjecture that there is a different play of words at work here:  the
root "sviat" is very close, in sound, to the root "sviet", meaning light.
From there the ironic use of "blinde" seems but a short distance.

Subject: Teaching and learning Yiddish

Ich "lurkeve" shoin a lange tseit un her zich tsu on redn. Itst hob ich
fun vos tsu redn a por verter.

I have been reading with great interest the introductions of new
subscribers, as well as the submissions with respect to learning and
teaching Yiddish.

I have been teaching Yiddish in Toronto (Vus hert men bi dir gutes,
Mikhl) for the last three years.  I teach a beginner course at a public
secondary school in North York, an area municipality of Metro Toronto
with a large Jewish population.  It is a credit course, which means that
students taking the course get a credit in Yiddish as an International
Language.

This year was the first year that the three levels of Yiddish were
available to high school students.  Students taking Yiddish from grade
ten on could ultimately earn a credit to be used toward university
entrance.

Those of us occupied with the continuation of Yiddish as a vital part of
Jewish culture were proud that in Toronto it was (now) possible to study
Yiddish from the pre-school level right up to post-graduate studies at
the University of Toronto.  While a large number of people are involved,
I particularly respect Sylvia Lustgarten, Director of the Committee of
Yiddish at the Jewish Federation of Greater Toronto, without whose dogged
persistence much of this would not be happening.

However, there are problems.  First, with the exception of Bialik Hebrew
Day School,  which teaches Yiddish from grade 3 to grade 8, none of
Toronto's Jewish day schools teach Yiddish.  The Jewish Board of
Education has been unalterably committed to not supporting Yiddish.  I
leave the justifications to them.  The one Jewish high school in Toronto
has been almost fierce in its resistance.  Again, I leave the
justifications to them--principal and board of directors.

This year the Board of Education in North York has informed us that the
credit courses may not be supported if larger numbers of high school
students do not take the courses. From their point of view, the larger
number of adults are not pursuing a diploma and could take the interest
courses, for which a fee is charged.  Admittedly, the bulk of students
are adults, but their numbers have permitted the smaller number of high
school students to take the courses which must maintain a minimum
registration to be continued.

We have a problem.

A "khaverte" referred recently to the support of Yiddish as a political
act, if I recall correctly.   As a daughter of survivors of the Holocaust
I have always considered it both a political act as well as a spiritual
act, not to mention a just plain pleasurable one.  It has pained me
deeply to witness the manner in which it has been treated by the
community.

I am pleased to read about the interest in Yiddish displayed by
Mendelniks, and about the Yiddish learning opportunities available
internationally.  While I am optimistic, if for no other reason than it
feels better than the alternative, I believe that a great deal needs to
be done for our Mame Loshen to have a vital future.

Subject: Yiddish originals

Can anyone tell me if the Yiddish originals of the following are
available - and where: (1) the memoirs of Jacob Adler (apparently
published serially in the Forverts) - made use of in his granddaughter
Lulla Rosenfeld's Bright Star of Exile (Crowell, 1977) (2) Joseph
Buloff's From the Old Marketplace (Harvard, 1991) - translated by Joseph
Singer from Fun altn markplats.  3) The Yiddish folktales in Beatrice
Weinreich's collection.

Subject: From the mailroom

The shames has received two interesting pieces in the last few days.  The
first is a catalog from Schwartz Judaica.  While Mendele has a _very_
negative view of commercialism on the Internet we tend for obvious
reasons to blink in the matter of booksellers.  Especially the sellers of
used books, who are more in the category of public benefactors.

In addition to some very interesting titles in German, Russian, French,
etc., there are in the 600 items in the Schwartz catalog a fair number of
books in and about Yiddish as well as translations from the Yiddish
(including one by our own Joseph Sherman of South Africa).  The internet
address is:

schwartz@cts.com.

The second piece of mail is a gorgeously-printed copy of Der Yapanisher
Yid.  Its editor is Jack Halpern, the associate editor Tsuguya Sasaki.
The editor is I think a lexicographer; he has just completed a Japanese-
English character dictionary.  At any rate, the bilingual newsletter is
written in a geshmaker Yiddish that's a joy to read.  Here's the first
paragraph of one item:

Ikh heys Shinichi.  Ikh bin a 43-yoriker arbeter in a fabrik in a kleyner
shtot.  Ikh hob lib Yiddish.  Mit an erekh 26 yor tsurik hob ikh getrofn
