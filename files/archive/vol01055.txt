Subject: RE: meaning of "gentile" to Mormons (fwd)

Ellen Prince stated recently that Mormons use "gentile"
to refer to non-Mormons.  I thought I'd ask a Mormon
e-mail acquaintance, and he says...

There's a WORLD of difference between Crown Heights and
Williamsburg.  Lubavitcher Khasidim are generally
welcoming of non-Khasidim -- that's their calling in
life, to be m'karev people (all right, I'm lapsing into
Judeo-English again:-).

The Satmar Khasidim who live in Williamsburg and Monroe
are not particularly interested in communicating with
those outside their community, even frum Jews.  We've
gone into stores in Monroe, speaking Yiddish, me with a
yarmulke and my wife with her hair covered, and been
just about ignored, or dealt with very brusquely. 
They're just not interested in those outside their
circle.

In Boro Park, on the other hand, you get a big mix of
Yiddish-speaking Khasidim, whose attitudes vary all
over the map.  We spend a couple of days shopping in
Boro Park every year, including getting clothes for
Yomtov for the kids.  It's the only place in the world
where we speak Yiddish to the kids in a store and no-
one takes the slightest notice.  13th Avenue in Brook-
lyn, for those who don't know the area.  We don't feel
at all uncomfortable there, in general.  (We'll be
there again this year in late August.)

If you want to monitor Yiddish being spoken without
needing to get people's agreement, go to 13th Avenue in
Boro Park. Because it's all busy stores, you can
browse, maybe even buy things, while listening to
Yiddish all around you. You can't do that, in our
experience, in Williamsburg where things are quieter
and, as a result, more hostile.

Sorry, Mikhl, you've lost me on this one.  Can you
clarify? What's a gafrur?
