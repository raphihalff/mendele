Subject: Yiddish greetings

Chane Honig suggests (Volume 4.359) a collection of responses to the
pro-forma greeting, "vos makhstu (makht ir)?" Way back when I was a
student at the Bronx mitlshul of the JPFO, the officeboy at Camp
Kinderland and, later, studying at the kursn far lerer un hekherer
yidisher bildung (School for Teachers and Higher Jewish Education), the
favorite wise-guy response to vos makhstu? was: "mit di zaytn." (Makhn
mit di zaytn=lit., gasping for breath; about to expire due to great
exertion.)

Subject: Yiddish song book

Can anyone recommend a good Yiddish song book?  I have a pretty good
collection of klezmer and other Yiddish music, but I have a real problem
with the lyrics.

To be sure, I have the same problem in all languages.  Years ago, for
example, my wife of the time and I were watching a Finnish group singing
their entry on the EuroVision Grand Prix whatever songfest.  "Wow," I
remarked, "Finnish sure is a weird language."

"Fool," she cogently observed, "they're singing in English."

Subject: Di dame mitn hintl

The poem "Di dame mitn hintl" in Russian by Samuil Marshak is actually a
very famous children's poem that most of Russian children know.

Subject: The gender of a "hintl"

In the Forverts of 10 March, Kadye Molodovski's poem "Di dame mitn hintl"
is published. I have a problem with the gender of "hintl" in Molodovski's
language. Please note the following:

Mit a groysn bagazh kumt a dame tsum ban: a kerbl, a kestl,... un a
kleyninker hintl.

"Hintl" here takes the (nominative?) adjective -kleynink-er-.

Di ban git a fayf un a shprung un nemt forn/ un dos hintl-- a bil un a
shprung un farlorn.

"Hintl" here is neuter.

Men git a nem un a yog un a trog afn ban/ .... afn ort fun dem hintl

Gib aher mayn bagazh: .... un a kleyniker hintl.

Here "kleyninker" appears to be accusative!

Can someone please explain what's going on here? Thanks.

Subject: Alison Bert's bilingual coincidence

The Yiddish word "ariber" means "across" like in the expression "ariber
dem yam".  THe Yiddish word for "above" is "iber", like in the expression
"iber alles" which means "above all".  A word of caution with respect to
single word bilingual coincidences.  We have to be careful not to label
cognates as bilingual coincidences.

Yes. And then there is "tsibele" (Yid.) and "cebolla" (Sp.)

Subject: Nokhamol "gay"

Regarding Shleyme Axelrod's posting on the "Yugntruf" wordlist--a useless
endeavor, obviously compiled without any imput from gays or lesbians.
There is a perfectly "gerotener vort" for "gay,"  i.e., freylekh, which
is being used by some gay/lesbian Jews.  No self-respecting gay person is
going to refer to him/herself as a "homoseksualist," an odious medical
term, regardless of the Schaechters' ukase.  The list has some terribly
klutzy terms, such as "homoseksualisten-bar" for gay bar--once again, a
word that's not likely ever to emerge in living speech. In this
Esperanto-Yiddish, they don't deign to mention words actually used by
living Yiddish-speakers, such as (my hobbyhorse) "feygele," or "tumtum."
O well--back to the drawing board.

Subject: Location of MAMELOSHN 95

It has been brought to my attention that I didn't stress strongly enough
where MAMELOSHN 95 will be taking place. We are holding it at Circle
Lodge, Hopewell Junction, NY. Hopewell Junction is on the east side of
the Hudson river on the Taconic parkway.

Subject: Vider gel/gelb

Dovid et al.:

After sending my own rather primitive posting about gel/gelb I decided to
check the Oxford  Dictionary of English Etymology and post what I found.
I was going to post it on Saturday but the place where I was acessing my
e-mail closed. I think Anno Siegel covered it very well (as a
non-linguist I founditeasier to follow) and Johan Seynnaeve covered it
more technically.

I did do the work, so I'll just quickly add my two bits.

I went to "yellow" knowing that y and g alternate each other in many
languages. It gives Old Saxon gelo, Middle Low German geel, Middle Dutch
gel(e)u. A proto- West Germanic form gelwa is postulated. This gelw as I
mentioned before obeys the exchange in High German for b. Example: Dutch
kalf, kalven and German Kalb. So, it's the "farkert" version of what I
mentioned earlier. I probably should have left it to the linguists, but I
wanted to at least take a stab at it, since I know something about
Germanic language history and speak both German and Dutch. I think it
came across in my posting that I was guessing, but what I will do from
now on is clearly state just that.
