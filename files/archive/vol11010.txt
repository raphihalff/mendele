Subject: Strasbourg Yiddish Festival

I regret to have to report that the presence of the Yiddish Mamas and
Papas here in Strasbourg on July 6 was accompanied by tragedy.

During the performance a violent storm arose with winds of almost
hurricane force.  The concert, taking place in a tent, was buffet by
winds, but a large tree fell onto the tent killing 11 people and
seriously injuring 35, 17 of whom are said to be seriously injured.
Children were included in this group.

Only by chance did my wife and I choose not to go to that evening
concert because of activities that we planned for on July 7.

So what was supposed to be a joyous, pleasant event, turned into
tragedy.

Subject: "Erev Pesach in Vilkoviskh"

Someone from the Eastern European Jewish History (EEJH) mail group
asked today whether anyone knew where to find a copy of Mordechai (Max)
Pustopedsky's poem "Erev Pesach in Vilkovishk."

I offered to write to you on that person's behalf, because I am almost
certain someone in Mendele would know the answer!

Subject: Rosetta Project Yiddish pages

Tayerer Mendelyaner,

The Rosetta project at http://www.rosettaproject.org seeks to compile
information about 1,000 languages, including Yiddish, in order to store
it for the ages, and is asking for volunteers who have certain
information about the various languages. I entered information about
Yiddish books and Web sites covering the topics they asked for,
including the YIVO orthography and several Yiddish scripture
translations. They would like someone to extract the information,
format it in PDF, and upload it to their site. The project will secure
copyright permission before publishing any of the uploaded material on
the Web.  At present the only uploaded material in Yiddish is B'reshis
1-3 (just past "di kh'rubim un di flamike shverd"), in the 1926 S.
Bloomgarden translation.

The project has had some software problems and some problems with
language data. If you search for "Yiddish" on the site, you will find
Western Yiddish, as in Germany. To find Eastern Yiddish, as in Poland,
Russia, and so on, enter "Yiddish, Eastern" in the search box. Eastern
Yiddish is of course the language of almost all Yiddish literature.

The project requests

A description of Yiddish
The B'reshis text (other translations welcome)
  Alternate creation texts
Orthography
Swadesh word list (100 common words)
Inventory of phonemes
Audio files
Color terms
Other texts

The same information is requested for Ancient and Modern Hebrew,
Samaritan, Aramaic, and Ladino. If information for other Jewish
languages is available, it would also be accepted.

Subject: Alis in Yiddishland

Martin Jacobs recently requested information from the Mendele list on
Yiddish translations of Lewis Carroll. I have witnessed a performance
of Jabberwocky recited in Yiddish under the title "Yomervokhets", with
simultaneous translation into juggling, at the KlezmerMania show in
Berkeley CA. A quick search on Google for "yiddish jabberwocky" returns
96 hits, including Refoyl Finkel's Alis in Vunderland, Kapitel 1, Arof
dem krolik-lokh. It was published in Der Bavebter Yid, and is now
available at
http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/bavebter/numer.1.2/sholem.alis.html.

Mr. Jacobs might also be interested in the translation currently
underway into the artificial language Lojban. I can send him a copy
when it is done.  See http://www.lojban.org for general information on
Lojban. It was designed to make mathematical logic speakable, so it is
ideal for much of Carroll. It is also conceivable that it could be
applied to Talmudic studies, although perhaps not likely.

Subject: puteny?

efsher ken emetser dos vort 'puteny' (?= a fan vu men preglt makholim)

Is anyone familiar with the word 'puteny' meaning a frying pan? If so
what is its origin?

Subject: Funem yarid

In Mendele 11.008 Jim Feldman asks about an edition of Sholem
Aleichem's Funem Yarid in modern orthography.

The Workman's Circle published an edition in 1940 "gekirtst un
fartaytsht fun Yudl Mark, mit derklerungen fun verter oyf yeder zaytl
un mit a verterbikhl tsum sof." Perhaps copies might be available from
The National Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachusetts.

Subject: mirele efros

In response to Jim Feldman's question about MIRELE EFROS, there are no
published English versions of the play (though he could find it in
Hebrew; Israelis pronounce it "Mirele Efrat," of course).
Translations of several Gordin plays by his son Alexander can be found
in the Jacob Gordin Papers in the YIVO Archives.  MIRELE may or may not
be among them, though even if it is, the dialogue would undoubtedly
sound very dated by now.

Subject: Mikhl Likht

I am working on Mikhl Likht's "Protsesiyes" / Processions, in the
context of a larger (dissertation) project.  I have become quite warmly
interested in this neglected poet.  His archives at YIVO are modest,
and I think I have tracked down whatever published criticism exists of
his work.  If anyone has come across information about Likht in the
course of their work on other poets, or if anyone has anecdotal
information, memories, or names of relatives or friends of Mikhl Likht,
I would be grateful to hear.

A dank in faroys,
Malkeh Bachman
