Subject: sch and sh

Meylekh Viswanath writes in 3.149:

>I know of one place this side of Korea, where 'sh' is not pronounced
>as in YIVO transcription.  In Czech, e.g., 'na shledanou' means
>something like 'goodbye.'  The 'shl' combination in the beginning is
>pronounced as an 's' sound followed by an 'h' sound followed by an
>'l.'

A similar situation exists in Serbocroatian.  The initial consonant
cluster in the word "shvatiti" (to grasp; to understand) is
pronounced as three separate sounds, with the "h" pronounced like a
Yemenite khes (although in rapid speech it is essentially elided).
Several other Slavic languages that use the Latin alphabet (i.e.,
Slovak, Slovenian and probably Polish, too) have similar clusters.

In the absence of the appropriate diacritical marks in ASCII, we
seem to be stuck with 'sh' - nowadays, unfortunately, there aren't
too many people interested in Yiddish remaining in Eastern Europe
who will be confused by our YIVO usage.  Like many of our other
correspondents, I find 'sch' too taytshmerish for my taste.

Subject: Yiddish words on TV & Academe

I should like to share with you two instances where a Yiddish word
was used, which surprised/pleased me. I should also say that I am
Jewish from Latin AMerica (Brazil), where Yiddish is rarely heard
outside Jewish circles. (There are exceptions, like "bad names" that
one usually learns from friends, and mostly, among men -- but this
is another subject.)

I heard the word Mentsch (pardon for the spelling all of you YIVO
followers) in a TV program (Katie Lee and Rick, or it is the
opposite order), spoken by the very nice, handsome and talented
Latin AMerican actor, Raul Julia. He was explaining how he found
peace/spiritual strenght with an Indian guru. In his anxiety to
properly describe the man, he exploded:" A guru who was a real
mensch!" He repeated the qualification more than twice.

The other occasion was during a very solemn convocation ceremony
held every year in my campus (University of Maryland). The keynote
speaker was Prof. Tobin, from the English Department, who is also
the President of the Senate. He is Jewish. He started his speech
(more or less) like this: "In my predecessors' culture there is a
word that describes the atmosphere that we all share today: the word
is 'naches' (I do not attempt to reproduce his words here; they are
packed in my memory. What is very salient is the word "naches"). He
proceeded by explaining what means "naches" in Yiddish.

After the ceremony (that lasted one hour, with other speeches and
delivery of medals, awards, a musical interlude and so on), we had a
reception, when I approached Dr. Tobin and told him how happy I was
to have heard that word within a non-Jewish public. He appreciated
my observation.

I hope that I did not bore you with my enthusiasm. For me these
things are kind of new. I wished that I could come to Brazil and use
some Yiddish words... in my conversation with my non-Jews friends
and colleagues. This culture allows it to be done. This is enviable.

Thanks for your eyes.

Subject: yiddish word order

to jason berman:

the subject of yiddish word order is extremely interesting. to my
mind, the question is not why is the discussion is lasting so long
but why it is making so little progress. i will repeat my plea: look
at actual yiddish discourse as produced naturally by native speakers
and see whether the neat little 'rules' you believe exist actually
do. (either oral or written will do; just make sure you are using
speakers who learned their yiddish in the normal way native speakers
do, not from weinreich's textbook.)

or you might want to consult the growing body of literature in
theoretical linguistics on the subject, some of it produced by
mendelniks in fact (e.g. ken miner, moyshe taube, work in progress
by dovid braun, related work by beatrice santorini, molly diesing,
and i'm sure i've omitted some).
