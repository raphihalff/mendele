Subject: Occupational names and women

In response to Zellig Bach's call for a proper term of respect for the First
Lady -- "prima pane"?  As for Bill Clinton's next in line, I would suggest,
mit a nign, "der vaytse-president, gor."

Subject: Soviet Yiddish Songs

Bob Rothstein's quoted lyrics (5.236) coincide with the song as I heard it
sung in Polish Jewish youth homes in 1949, in Lodz and Wroclaw.

Subject: Badkhones literature

In the wake of the recent discussion of badkhones/marshelikes, I would like to
offer a bibliographical postscript (I hope I'm not repeating something that
was already noted here):

Ya'ari, Abraham.  "Sifre ha-badhanim" [Badhanim literature], in Kiryat sefer,
vol. 35, no. 1 (December 1959), pp. 109-126.

Ya'ari's article cites a total of 168 titles of published badkhones, by 28
badkhonim (6 citations are for anonymous badkhones chapbooks), plus several
invaluable references to scholarship on the subject. Most of the entries are
for materials printed in Yiddish, but Ya'ari's introduction and annotations
are in Hebrew.

Subject: Life and death of Yiddish

This message is in answer to Ellen Prince's response to me in Mendele 5.233.

Ellen - No substantial disagreement. However,

1. A tear ought to come to the eye even if the abandonment of Yiddish had been
entirely voluntary. A tear comes to the eye when the last member of an
endangered species perishes - no matter how that came about. A language is
like a species. When there is one fewer in the world, the world is that much
poorer.

2. The Chasidim are a good example for your thesis. Many of them are
determined to live their lives as if time had frozen several hundred years
ago, like a mammoth preserved in ice in the wastes of Siberia. I cannot deny
that, as long as they succeed in their project, Yiddish will still have a
vestigial life.

3. I still think that there is room for a concept which straddles sociology
and linguistics, in which the present sad state of a language is compared to
its former glory. A language is not fully alive if it is the language of the
last of the Mohicans.

Subject: Life and death of Yiddish

In response to Susan Lerner's post in Mendele 5.236, this is yet another
example of the argument that, alas!, Yiddish is dying, and this process is
unfortunately unidirectional and irreversible.  Of course, if enough people
were to feel this way, it would naturally bring about the demise of Yiddish.
Fortunately there are those who do not agree with this prognosis, and time
alone will tell who is right.

With respect to the status of Yiddish in Israel she states: "Until recently,
Yiddish was avoided in official Israel for the same reasons."  As far as I
know, Yiddish was not tolerated in Israel because it represented a threat to
the as yet not secure Hebrew.  However, once Hebrew became well established as
the language of the land, the attitude toward Yiddish changed and became more
accepting.

Perhaps it is time to inject a bit of humor in these discussions.  I offer the
following anecdotes:

One day Bialik went into a shop to buy some cigarettes which he asked for in
Yiddish. The storekeeper, somewhat surprised, said: "Bialik! You are a famous
Hebrew poet. Why do you ask for cigarettes in Yiddish?"  To which Bialik
replied: "Yiddish is faster."

One day on a crowded bus in Tel Aviv, a woman and her young son were standing
in the aisle and carrying on a conversation.  Her son spoke to her in Hebrew,
and she replied in Yiddish.  A sabra who was standing next to the woman became
very irritated by this exchange.  He nudged the woman and said: "Your son is
speaking to you in Hebrew. Why are you answering him in Yiddish?" To which she
replioed: "I want he shouldn't forget he is a Jew."

Subject: Yiddish letterpress type

Do any of my fellow-Mendelyaner know where I could locate Yiddish letterpress
type, for use with an old printing press? All type formats and sizes would be
useful. How strange that one would want to use this old technology when
Yiddish fonts are available for computers! Yiddish or Hebrew brass type or
handle letters for hot stamping in bookbinding are also needed.

(Lakh nisht af mayn tsebrokhene idish. Ikh tu di beste vus ikh ken.) Efsher

Subject: Yoo-hoo

How do you say "yoo-hoo" in Yiddish?

A book by Michele Slung called "Hear! Here!" (Clarkson Potter, 1994) is a
compilation of these and other exclamations in various languages. "Peekaboo"
in Danish, for example, is "borte-borte-teet-teet," and "Wow!" in Russian is
"Noo-ee-noo."  Yiddish is not included, for reasons which may or not bear on
the is-it-dying question.

In addition to Yoo hoo, peekaboo, and wow, I'd be interested in these: uh-oh,
tsk! tsk!,  achoo, brrrr, whoops, upsy-daisy ("hopp" in German), thud!, Boo!
-- and any other such quasi-words.  I guess "yuck"  ("igitt" in German, "bert"
in French, "usch" in Swedish, "fu" in Russian) might be "feh"?

Zitsndik af shpilkes --
