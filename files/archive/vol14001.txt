Thirteen is to be sure not a particularly ripe age.  On the other hand,
Mendele is older than the Internet and _that_ feels as though it's been
around since the Roosevelt era.  At any rate, we've been through a lot.
What success we've had is entirely due to those who over the years have
written questions, answers and opinions about Yiddish.  While most of them
are b"h still with us, this is a good time to recall some of those who are
not, good friends such as Zellig Bach, Shleyme Axelrod, Yitzkhak Kertesz and
Mendy Fliegler.  If they are gone their humanity remains.  af undz ale

Subject: Esther Singer Kreitman

In re Hershl Hartman's posting of 5/5,  my leyenkrayz has just finished
reading esther kreitman's BRILYANTN in Yiddish.  We made 23 photocopies of a
photocopy because the book was not available. It deals with diamond cutters
in Antwerp, Belgium prior to WW1 and moves to London as the Jews flee. It
seems to be an accurate record in a fictionalized setting.  we were
disheartened to hear about the NYBC west coast seminar, "The Other Singer",
protested, and they promised to run a program on her. Tkhiyes hameysim.. She
is being resurrected......

Subject: Re: a nekhtiker tog

While I agree with the general concensus that "nekhtiker tog" means "not
a chance" or "don't bet on it", I had a different understanding of how
it came to mean that.  It only occurred to me after years of wondering
about the expression, which my mother seemed to use (on me) daily.  So
far, those who've posted on this thread have translated "nekhtiker" as a
form of "yesterday", which it certainly could be (from "nekhtn"), but
"nekhtiker" could also be an adjectival form of "nakht".  So the literal
meaning of the phrase would be something like--and you should pardon the
awkward English--"a nocturnal day" or "a nighttime day".  This meaning
of the phrase is clearly an oxymoron, an impossibility of opposites,
which explains why it is used as it is: "it'll never happen".

Subject: Yiddish courses and programs

My colleagues and I at the Yiddish teacher's list
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/yiddishteachers/  are compiling a list of all
the colleges and universities around the world which offer Yiddish language
or culture, from as little as one course to a full program, as well as their
teachers, departments and heads, and contact information. We would like to
have your contributions to add to the list.  I will be posting this
information on our website.

In addition to university level classes, we would like to know about the
existence of classes at the following levels anywhere in the world:
Secondary schools (High school, middle school or junior high)
Elementary schools (K-5 or 6)
Pre-schools
After school classes
Sunday schools
Adult classes
Casual classes

a dank in foroys,

Subject: nebbish and nebekh

ikh bin maskim mit Hershl Hartman. In all the years I conversed with and
heard Yiddish spoken by my extended family, native speakers all, I never
heard them use the word "nebbish". I concur with reb Hartman's conclusions
that it is a 'Yinglish' word, not to be found in the Yiddish canon.

Subject: Tribute to Yiddish speakers

The following is from the 5/5/04 issue The Scotsman. You can read
the entire article at the URL -- but it's in Scottish!!

Hershl Hartman

IN HIS recent book Spoken Here: Travels Among Threatened Languages ,
Montreal journalist and poet Mark Abley talks of meeting speakers of
endangered tongues like Mati Ke in Australia and Yiddish in North
America. He says: "I came out of all the travelling, research and
writing a lot more hopeful, just through having met such tenacious,
determined, smart, bloody-minded people. People who were not going to
let their language go gently into the night." Abley will be speaking
at the Edinburgh Book Festival in August.

Subject: Query: Mark Arnsteyn and Mihal Waszynski (Rosenberg)
From: Joel Rosenberg <joel.rosenberg@tufts.edu>

I am seeking sources dealing with the life and work of Mark Arnshteyn and
Mihal Waszynski, the screenwriter and director, respectively, of the 1937
Yiddish film Der Dibek (The Dybbuk), and particularly their work on this
film.  I have already seen Michael Steinlauf's informative dissertation on
Arnshteyn.  I'm interested in finding articles in English, Yiddish, Hebrew,
French, or German, if such exist, and in any relevant archival materials.
Please reply to joel.rosenberg@tufts.edu, or to the H-Judaic web site.

Joel Rosenberg
