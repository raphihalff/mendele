Date: May 19, 2011

The word LEITSAN appears in my research of a Dutch Askenazi family. It is
suggested that it means Clown. Early Dutch Yiddish did have a special
vocabulary. Has anyone come across this word as an entertainer of some
sort?

Subject: Yiddish in the writings of Rav Hutner

Abraham was the first Jew by choice; his son, the first to be born a Jew;
Jacob--from him onward, Jewishness could not be revoked.

Subject: Yiddish proverb

Re:  "Der khazer zol hobn herner, volt di velt keyn kiem nit gehat."
(Ignaz Bernstein, "Juedische Sprichwoerter und Redensarten").

"Ven a khazer zol hobn herner, volt er ibergekert di velt." (Israel
Furman, "Yidishe shprikhverter un rednsartn)

I believe it is meant as derisive response to somebody expressing
malicious intentions, but not having - thanks God - any means to fulfill
them. It has exact counterparts - or very similar ones - in Slavic
languages, like: "Ne dal bog svin'e rogov - a bodushcha byla!"

Subject: Jerusalem Zoo

Hi all, "The Economist" magazine claims, a few weeks ago now, that the
Jerusalem zoo  hasput up a sign in Yiddish on the cage of some animal that
looks like a pig but isn't (peccary, I think) saying "dos iz nisht a
khazer." Since this is not good Yiddish, I was wondering whether the story
is just a typical Israeli joke that the reporter took to be a fact.

Subject: shlepe-bobe

"Shlepe-bobe" is the Yiddish pronunciation of the Polish "Slepa Baba," a
game called  "Blind Man's Buff" in English and "Colin Maillard" in French.
"Slepa" means "Blind" in Polish and "Baba" is "Bubbe" or "Bobe" according
to the various Yiddish pronunciations.

Subject: shlepe-bobe

Perla Sneh asks about a children's game in the geto called shlepe-bobe.
In this case, I think shlepe is the Polish word Blepa [blind].   It's a
game where you put a blindfold on a person and spin him/her around. The
person then tries to catch one of the other players while blindfolded.
I've also heard the game called blinde ku (blind cow).

Subject: Matla

Alexander Beider, in his Dictionary of Ashkenazic Given Names, correlates
Matla to the name Meyte, which derives ultimately to Meytin, meaning
"maiden" or "girl." In addition, he writes, "The forms starting with Mat-
could also be influenced by the existence of the common German Christian
name Mathilda or its Czech and Polish forms,
Matylda. "

Subject: tsugl

Maybe you can assist me in this odd query.

A friend asked me the other day if I know the meaning of the Yiddish word
"tsuggle" (the transliteration is questionable). I did not know its
meaning and the friend said it means fellatio. My first attempt was to
determine if there is a Yiddish word for fellatio and I was not
successful. Then I tried to find a meaning for tsuggle also without
success.

I hope that you can assist me in this odd query.


Very truly yours,

Irwin Mortman
