Yup, I can get you past tsu leben. My grandmother's formula
was Tsu gezunt, tsu leben, tzu vaksen - then one I can't
quite remember, which sounded like tsu geesen. She was from
near Lodz, incidentally.

Sounds very American to me too. A kalt? I can only think of
the adjective -kalt-. I would have said -du bist farkeeelt-

Subject: Yiddish doggerel

I am interested in hearing about genres (with examples) of
 Yiddish and English-Yiddish macaronic doggerel, like - or
 unlike - those below.

1. conventionalized Yiddish  phonology (and contraction) in
one word 'tsungem or tsungoem' ( e representing fronted
schwa), Eng. 'chewing gum'

        My mother gave me a nickel  (quarter, dollar )       (SUNG)
        To buy a pickle  ( (some) water, collar)
        I didn't buy a ( or 'no') pickle
        I bought some tsungem
        Tsu tsu tsu tsu tsu tsungem
        How I love tsungem

(I am not sure of the last two lines; 
they may repeat the previous two, or the last
line may be 'I DO like tsungem.')

2. Conventional - but not throughout - Yiddishized
phonology, with some Yiddish vocabulary

              tsu hum (a) yu spikn, tsu hum tsu hum
              tsu hum (a) yu spikn, tsu hum
              a(l) giv yu a knyak, yu paskudnyak
              tsu hum (a) yu spikn, tsu hum
                                            (STRONG 4 BEAT RHYTHM)

3. Minimal (more or less ?) Yiddish

        (loud) cheer - at athletic events, particularly
         basketball, heard at summer camps in  the mid,
         late thirties

                       tsu brech a fus, tsu brech
                       tsu brech a fus, tsu brech 
                       tsu brech a fus, tsu brech a fus
                       tsu brech a fus, tsu brech !   (Yay, Muzzy )

Subject: Various

I have recently returned to Mendele and have enjoyed
catching up on the mail. I particularly enjoyed the remarks
on God and tenure. Regarding foot and leg, I have never
heard them distinguished. To spread one's legs is
"tsushpreiten die fees". With respect to Arn's remarks on
Hobm and Khurbm, I have never heard them pronounced that
way among the native Yiddish speakers I know. They end
those words with a"nun". Following on Maylekh's note about
original Yiddish songs, There was recently an international
Jewish song competition sponsored by the Hazzan Mendelson
Music Foundation, for original compositions with a Jewish
content. Fifteen finalists were picked from over 160
entries. These represented the U.S., Canada, Australia and
Israel. Four of the songs were in Yiddish. The finals were
held last week in Montreal. I believe that tapes will be
available. More when I know.

Subject: Khaleria

My grandmother used a phrase which has become part of my
own vocabulary: "zollt a chaleria chappen dir in heint."  I
believe she meant, "the devil should grab you by the ass."
A colleague in linguistics tells me the word "chaleria"
refers to the the disease, cholera, and the curse is
metaphoric not literal.  Does anyone have anything
definitive on the meaning of the word?
