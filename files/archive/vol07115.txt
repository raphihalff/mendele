Subject: Dutch Yiddish "davenen" and [ou]

Alexis Manaster Ramer (Mendele Vol 07.112) cites Hartog Beem as proof that
_davenen_ is attested in Dutch Yiddish and adds that that leaves us with the
question if the verb was indigenous to Dutch Yiddish or whether it was
borrowed from recent immigrant Jews from Eastern Europe. My guess is that it
entered Dutch Yiddish relatively recently. I can't remember having come across
it in early written sources (unless it is related to _doenen_ which may be
more frequent in ivre-taytsh than in other styles). Of course I can be
mistaken, I haven't paid special attention to this word. Maybe Ariane Zwiers
and Shlomo Berger who also work on Dutch Yiddish have helpful observations in
this matter. 

As a Dutch speaker, however, I have the impression that until recently, those
with a Dutch Jewish background used _oren_ and others use _davenen_ when
speaking Dutch with Yiddish expressions. At present, one finds more and more
Modern Hebrew or Eastern Yiddish influences and the remnants of Dutch Yiddish
are disappearing. I found the most striking example of this in the works of a
Dutch author who purportedly writes autobiographical prose. In his memoirs of
a Dutch Jewish childhood one can find a number of Yiddish expressions, but
none of them is recognizably Dutch Yiddish. If anything, I believe they can
all be retraced to Philip Roth's _Portnoy's Complaint_... 

As for the _ou_ pronunciation, there is no doubt about its authenticity and
the criticism by Claus Buryn/Lucas Bruyn on Beem's transcriptions (Mendele Vol
07.113) is misplaced. _vov+yud_ usually represents [ou] (V42/54) or [a:] (long
a, V44) in Dutch Yiddish texts. Representations of Dutch Yiddish in roman
characters can be found in different sources, but the [ou] pronounciation is
most convincingly described in an early 18th century Yiddish primer from
Amsterdam: "vov-yud is pronounced as _a_ followed by _u_." This pronunciation
survives to this day.

Subject: davenen one last?? time

Mr. Buryn's latest contribution gets everything precisely backwards when he
says: "I don't possess the linguist's bag of trics to relate Old Yiddish
'doynen' to Modern Yiddish dav(e)nen but I can imagine that at some point in
time Hebraists tried to come up with a Hebrew form for an originally non
Hebrew word, because this word was related to religeous practice and therefore
ought to be of Hebrew origin."

I dont know how many times it needs to repeated that it is precisely linguists
(e.g., me) who reject the possibility of davenen coming from doynen. 
Linguists do not have tricks, we have methods, and these methods rule out
almost all the possibilities which have been proposed simply because the
precise form of davenen cannot derive from doynen or do"nen or dawn or
divinare etc. etc.  Period end of THOSE stories.  The rest of teh passage I
quote reveal a complete lack of understanding (for which we linguists perhaps
are to blame, since we apparently do a louse job of teaching our subject to
teh world at large) about how languages change.  Only in rare cases do we find
conscious innovations such as Mr. Buryn suggests.  Most linguistic innovation
is not done by committee.  There was no group of Hebraists that got together
to make up a new verb for saying prayers in Eastern Yiddish. 

On the other hand, Mr. Weigel poses some good questions, which I dont think I
can do full justice here since a full-scale article is required.  But briefly,
it is an old and controversial question where Yiddish verbs of Hebrew origin
like pasken(en) come from.  One possibility which I cautiously support is that
SOME of them do come from 3d person masc. perfects of the "qal" conjugation.
Hence pasken could in fact come from pa:saq.  I cannot here go into all the
details of how the Hebrew kamats /a:/ would get to become Yiddish /a/ and how
the second Hebrew vowel would syncopate.  These are all valid research
problems at present, actually, and my own solutions may not turn out to be
right.  At any rate, IF pa:saq can yield pasken(en), then da:vav could in
theory have yielded a hytpothetical from like *davven(en), from which
daven(en) would beeasy to get.  However, tehre are problems as I keep pointing
out, such as the fact that we do not have any attestations of *daven, as this
theory would suggest we should.  Also, we haveyet to offer a satisfactory
response to Meyer Wolf's semantic problem, which may kill the whole thing. 

I cannot overemphasize the fact that a satisfactory solution to this kind of
problem requires a large number of things to fall into place, and once
published, will probably be subejcted to years of scholarly debate before
becoming accepted. I cannot possibly go into all this here.  All I can say is
that a body would have to get up might early to come with a problem that has
not already been noticed.  Of course, Meyer Wolf did precisely that, but there
are not, I am pretty sure, many Meyer Wolfs in this field.  As it is, his
objection is giving me nightmares, so I HOPE there are no more(:-). 

In any case, please do not assume that just because many of the details were
not mentioned in my earlier postings, that this means that those of us working
on such problems are unaware of them. 

In conclusion, when I first posted something on this, it was merely to try to
set the record straight, but the whole thing has been blown totally out of
proportion. I do not regert it because it did eleicit Meyer's crucial
contribution to the problem and alsp perhaps because it gives us an
opportunity to clarify some basic issues of Yiddish linguistics.  Since these,
it is now cleare, are quite foreign to many participants in these discussions,
it mightbe good to discuss them. But I do not think that going on about
davenen is a good way to do this, since (a) this problem is still tricky and
(b) the basic issue regarding linguistics vs. amateur tinkering with the
language is much more basic.  The ONE thing that the case of davenen does show
I think (and I hope this is not lost in all teh hubbub) is that linguists do
not claim to know everything and know enough to find the real problems.  It
strikes as quite significant in this discussion that a number of amateurs seem
to think thay they do know everything and are immune to the kind of doubts and
problems that we linguists deal with daily.  This alone would be sufficient to
show that the amateur proposals are not to be taken seriously.

Subject: I.B. Singer's "Blood"

In answer to Jason M. Payne's question (Vol. 07.113), I.B. Singer's "Blood"
was originally published in Yiddish as "Treyf blut". It appeared in the
"Forverts" (New York) on December 23, 24, 30 and 31, 1966.

From: Ruben Frankenstein <frankens@mail.uni-freiburg.de>
Subject: davenen and no end!

Maybe this question will never be solved and stay a riddle.  Still I would
like to stress the 3 possibilities, that seem to me most convincing: 
a) Siegmund A. Wolf cites Gottfried Seligs Lehrbuch der juedischdeut- schen
Sprache, Leipzig 1792, whre the word is written DAFNEN. This would support the
etymology from the hebrew DAF (= page), which is also a yiddish synonym for
"blat" (of Talmud or Siddur). 
b) In his shortly before Nazi occupation in Paris 1939-40 published "Milon
Idi-ivri male" A B K (Imprimerie L. Beresniak) gives besides the english
"dawn" for shakhris also the rather possible French "service divin" = tefila
le-Elohim ve-asu bekitsur mehamila hashniya "divin" poal "davenen".  
c) Still I plead for the Hebrew verb DVV - davov, perhaps in coincidence with
one of the above etymologies.  Reuven Frankenstein

Subject: WEVD

Just to clear up a point about the programming on WEVD. It was founded as a
Socialist station, not a Yiddish one. For it's first 5 years (1927-1932) 
there is no evidence that it ran any Yiddish programming outside of several
"Jewish" content shows. It was under the ownership of the Forverts that it
started running many Yiddish programs--most of them on Sundays--but never in
it's entire broadcast life was it ever solely a "Yiddish" station.

Subject: Chanukah stories

I'm a native Yiddish speaker and professional Yiddish/English storyteller,
looking for Chanukah stories (memorable) by Yiddish writers in English
(transl.)-classic or contemporary writers. Also Chanukah Chelm stories.  Would
appreciate references/info.

What does "fonye" exactly mean? I found it in a preface to "Mirele Efros": 
"ihr vet a yosele'n zehn un a donye,/(...)/yenem alz shvekhlikher fun fonye" 
I know "fonyelekh" are russian soldiers: is that correct? Who can help me
understand what's the link between a Russian soldier and a Daniel, a yiddisher
bokher? 
 
a gute vokh!
