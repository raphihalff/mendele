Subject: Philologos on Stankiewicz on Wexler on Judeo-Sorbian

It will no doubt interest those who have followed this (dare I say
it?) controversy that Prof. Stankiewicz's letter on Paul Wexler's
theories regarding the origins of Yiddish has indeed wended Its Way
to Philologos.  In his latest column, "Wexler Revisited" ("Forward,"
Aug. 27, 1993), Philologos summarizes Stankiewicz's "lengthy
response to my series," and then responds with a few remarks of his
own.

Rather than reproduce the entire column, I will summarize Philolo-
gos' summary and then quote his final two paragraphs in toto:

(1) "Mr. Wexler's assertion that 'the language spoken by Eastern
European Jews before they switched to Judeo-German (i.e., Yiddish)
is not new.... Wexler posits historical changes (from ancient to
modern Sorbian) which defy the rules of Slavic comparative phonology
and misinterprets the origins and meanings of a number of Sorbian
forms.'

(2) "...'Wexler ignores the basic lesson of historical grammar and
its historical method, which is that the genetic affiliation of a
language is not determined by its lexicon... but by its grammatical
structure and the so-called regularity of phonetic correspondences'"
-- "'The bulk of [the] grammatical structure [of Yiddish], its
derivational and inflectional suffixes, and its phonetic development
testify to its Middle High German origin and qualify it as a member
of the German linguistic family.'

(3) "Mr. Wexler's idea that 'Yiddish (read Judeo-Sorbian) adopted
the bulk of its Hebrew... terminology to ward off the massive
encroachments of German... strikes one as paradoxical, since Hebrew
has from time immemorial served as the language of Jewish spiritual
... culture, whereas the German that (Slavic-speaking) Jews
allegedly shunned was not a language imposed by a hostile power but
one imported by their Ashkenazic coreligionists'."

And now, Philologos' response to the foregoing:

"Since Professor Stankiewicz's letter was written after the third
column in my series on Mr. Wexler, I hope his disappointment in me
was somewhat mitigated by the fourth and last, in which I offered my
own opinions on Wexler's thesis and expressed some basic reserva-
tions about it -- one of which made the same observation that
Stankiewicz makes in his Point 2, and another of which partly
corresponded to his Point 3.  As to Point 1, I already wrote in my
first column that Mr. Wexler's case for Judeo-Sorbian depended on 'a
detailed linguistic analysis that must be dealt with point-by-point
in order to be confirmed or refuted.'  Since my knowledge of Slavic
languages is barely rudimentary, I could hardly have been expected
to take part in this debate.

"Moreover, while I agree with Professor Stankiewicz that 'bombshell'
was an unfortunate bit of journalese, I applied the word not to Mr.
Wexler's already published linguistic thesis about Yiddish but to
his soon-to-be-published sociocultural hypothesis about the
development of Ashkenazic Jewry.  Professor Stankiewicz is also
being inaccurate when he quotes me as speaking of Mr. Wexler's
'revolutionary achievements.'  The phrase I used was 'revolutionary
theories'; to become 'achievements' these would have to be proved
correct, and I never claimed that they had been.  Professor
Stankiewicz thinks that they never will be, and I suspect that he
may be right, but I lack the competence to make a firm judgment on
the matter."

Subject: Introduction

My name is Jeri Fogel, and I'm a classics grad student at Columbia,
writing a dissertation on the rhetorical use of the past, especially
the legal past, in Cicero's "public" speeches. I know only a bissel
Yiddish to speak, but have been trying to practice by reading
articles and children's books and listening to as many Perle fun
yidishe Lider as I can! (Every collection seems to be called that!)
Thank you for letting me "listen in", and sorry for what must be my
terrible transliteration, especially considering the recent list
conversation. A sheynem Dank!

Subject: re _za_ and _shabesdike_

could what was heard as _za fidele_ have been /zan/ fidele? in
southeastern yiddish, nonfinal /ay/ becomes /a/ and /zan fidele/
would be a normal way of saying _zayn fidele_.

re _rivkele di shabesdike_, i went over the translation of that song
with a yiddish singer, mascha benya, and she translated it as 'the
sabbath-festive'. this isn't exactly great idiomatic english, but
the point is that she's all decked out for shabes, consoling her
child and telling him of how his father will come back and bring
bread, not knowing of course that her husband is dead.
