Subject: Vlach/vloch/voloch

Before my zeyde, Nathan Warshavsky, brought his large family to the U.S.
in 1906, they had lived in the town of Dubossar, Bessarabia, a Romanian
territory, at that time swallowed up by Russia.  My Zeyda had been a
travelling mmerchant dealing in dried fruits, nuts, tea and spices.  He
was gifted musically, and liked to sing, and his travels thru remote
towns and villages gave him the opportunity to learn many lidlakh which
his children loved to listen to in the evenings.

When I was growing up in the Bronx I heard these things from my mother
and aunt, as they recalled how "der tate"  had inspired their childhood
with his wide collection of songs, and their pride in his rendition of a
song called "a Volokhl" entered my consciousness.  But it was not till I
was 13, in 1929, that I had the chance to hear my zeyde's songs, when he
came to visit us from his home in Cleveland.

During that visit zeyde was in his glory among family and friends as he
responded to his childrens hunger for his old songs.  Tho I had only a
smattering of Yiddish, some few of those songs planted fragments in my
memory, so that some 30 years later, when I started to teach myself
Yiddish, those were the first songs I searched out.

Yet, to my regret, all that my memory retained of the "Volokhl" is the
enthusiasm surrounding it...  how caressingly the request was uttered:
"nuzhe, tateh, a Volekhl! ... a Volekhl, tateniu, a Volekhl!".  I must
have listened, because I concluded that a "Volekhl" was Gypsy music.  I
have no idea what language the words might have been.  Now that Bob
Rothstein (Mendele V6.136) identifies slavic Wallach as
"vlach/vloch/voloch" name of migrant shepherds in the Carpathian
mountain region, I realize that it could have been within my zeyde's
travelling range (50 to 100 miles from Dubossar) and I like to think
that it was there he found his "Volekhl".

The Baal Shem is believed to have emerged from the Carpathian mountain
region. I believe it was Peretz who wrote the mystic, evanescent play
(?) sketch(?) (surrealistic like "Bay Nakht Oyfn Altn Mark")....  The
youmg Israel is here envisioned in solitude, gathering up his inner
forces among sprites and demons in that ravine and cave haunted region.
I cannot remember its title or where I might have read it, whether in
Yiddish or translation.  I would appreciate hearing from whoever might
identify this work and its title.

Can someone please give me the number of U.S. colleges and universities
which offer instruction in Yidddish? Also please point me to a published
list. Thanks.

Subject: Merry Christmas in Yiddish

In response to Irv Goldfein's comment in Mendele 6.161, I have always
taken the title of Marie B. Jaffe's book "Gut Yuntif, Gut Yohr" to mean
"Merry Christmas, Happy New Year".  This view stems from the prominent
place given the piece entitled "Erev Krismes" which is written in
transliterated Yiddish, and also translated as "A Visit from St.
Nicholas".

Subject: Gender and the New Testament

I had suspected that words of loshnkoydesh (semitic) origin, that were
borrowed into Yiddish, had genders ascribed to them based on their
morphology; that is, words with a 'masculine'-sounding ending
(-s,-os,-us) were slotted into masculine gender, unless of course their
meaning precluded it. Thus, talis, shabis, tunis (fast), tues (mistake)
- and of course bris (especially because of its male association) are
all masculine in Yiddish, though feminine in Hebrew. The entire nominal
phrase 'bris chadoshe' was lifted from the Hebrew, so of course the
modifier wasn't changed.

Similarly, teyve, (nature), matbeye (coin) - are  feminine.In Hebrew -
masculine.

I could mayrikh zayn, but I think I had better cut short this discussion
on the bris.
