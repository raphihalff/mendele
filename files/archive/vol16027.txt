Can anyone help?

A friend of ours in Los Angeles is searching for the complete text to a
Yiddish version of a version of Modah/Modeh Ani that she used to say as a
child. Here's all that she can bring back to mind (exactly as she's written
it down):

 stanza:

 Moyde ani
 Lefonekho meylekh...

 adinoy got,
 Ikh hof tsu dir tsi mayn lebn gebot
 Ikh vil tun vos Got heyst
 Vos der tate heyst
 Vos di mame heyt
 Vos ale gute frume layt heysn mir tsu tun
 Vil ikh tun
 A brokhe
 un hatslokhe
 oyf mayn kleyn kepele.

It looks like an interesting kids' prayer, from the very rudimentary
Yiddish I know; and it's not a recent prayer---this lady is now 88, and
used to say it as a child. Does anyone know from whence this version of
Modah/Modeh Ani comes, and where we might find it?

Thanks in advance for your help!

Be well, and have a zisn peysakh---

Subject: Sholem Schwartzbard

With regard to the query about Sholem Schwartzbard, dated April 5, from
Jean Pauline:  Sholem Schwartzbard wrote his memoirs in Yiddish, "Inem loyf
fun yorn," Chicago, 1933.  You will find about 9-10 pages of it translated,
with an informative introduction, in "The Golden Tradition" by Lucy
Dawidowicz, Beacon Press, 1967.

Subject: Sholem Schwartzbard

Two of Sholem Schwartzbard's Yiddish memoirs were published in Chicago in
the early 1930s by M. Ceshinsky.

There will be an article, "Sholom Schwartzbard: The Avenger," in the
upcoming spring (May) issue of Chicago Jewish History, the quarterly
journal of the Chicago Jewish Historical Society.

The article includes material about his early life; his assassination of
Simon Petlura in Paris and subsequent trial; his connection to Chicago; his
death and burial in South Africa; and his reburial in Israel in 1967.

Subject: Sholem Schwartzbard

In response to the query from Jean Pauline in Mendele 16.025 about material
relating to Sholem Schwartzbard:

The poem you ask about is doubtlessly Itsik Manger's "Shvartsbard balade,"
one of three he wrote relating to Petliura/Schwartzbard, all published in
his first collection of poems "Shtern oyfn dakh," published in 1929.

The other two are entitled "Di balade fun Petliura" and "Vayse balade." The
text of "Shvartsbard-balade" (in which the spirits of the Jews massacred at
Proskurov visit Schwartzbard as he lies in jail) is as follows:

Ibern nakhtishn tfise-fentsterl,
tsitern vayse, farpaynikte berd,
un vekn dem shotn, vos ligt farmatert -
a gekreytster oyf nakhtisher erd.

"Proskurof! Proskurof!
Mir zenen di vizye fun shtet ongetsundene,
di vizye fun shrek iber khoreve vent.
Mir zenen gekumen mit vintn tseflien,
tsu kushn dayn tsar un tsu bentshn dayn tuen, -

her, vi mir klopn,
un betn mit kranke farvyanete lipn:
shenk undz a tropn
fun blut, vos fibert, vi royter burshtin
oyf dayne bleykhe, yidishe finger."

Ibern nakhtishn tfise-fentsterl,
flatern vayse meydl-geshtaltn.
Di bristn tsebisn, antbloyzt kegn nakht,
khlipen zey troyrik arayn durkh di shpaltn.

"Proskurof! Proskurof!
Mir zenen di vizie blut un shigoen
oyf tunkle ukrainishe stepes getsundn.
Di vizye fun der heyliker yungfroy,
vos hengt a geshendte tsum shand-slup gebundn.

Her, vi mir klapn,
un betn mit kranke, farfestikte otems:
shenk undz a tropn
fun blut, vos fibert,vi royter burshtin
oyf dayne bleykhe yidishe finger."

Ibern nakhtishn tfise-fentsterl,
tsinen on kinder di kroyn fun troyer,
un veynen mit shvartse elegishe oygn
arayn zeyer tsar in der nakht un der bloyer:

"Proskurof! Proskurof!
Mir zenen dayn eybik umzistiker korbn.
Gekreytsikt in kholem oyf undzere vign,
mir hobn gezen der mameshis bristn
tsevorfn oyf mistn un hegdeshn lign.

Her, vi mir klopn,
un betn mit bleykhe, dershrokene lipn:
shenk undz a tropn
fun blut, vos fibert, vi royter burshtin
oyf dayne bleykhe yidishe finger."

Best wishes,

Subject: Y.L. Peretz' "Mayses"

Y.L. Perets' "Mayses," translated as "Stories," is in Ruth Wisse's Peretz
anthology, "The I. L. Peretz Reader," pp. 200-12.

Subject: PBS program

It is most likely that Martin Jacobs, in referring to a group of young
singers on PBS, probably saw a half hour special starring a young Mike
Burstyn. I think the title of the piece was "Lomir ale zingen." It was
aired about 35 years ago.
