The term "yom tov", which has largely fallen into disuse in modern
Hebrew, means "festival" at most, and certainly not "holy day" in
Biblical Hebrew.  Thus, when David's henchmen come to collect
protection money from  Nabal on the occasion of the of shearing his
flocks (1st Samuel 25,8), they say: "for we have come on a
`yom-tov'", which literally means  no more than `a good day'.

In Talmudic Hebrew, it is used primarily as a synonym of "mo`ed",
i.e. a religious holiday.  For example, the second day of Passover,
Succoth or Shavuoth that is celebrated in the diaspora is referred
to as "yom-tov sheni shel galuyot".  However, it also shows up in
the sense of a private celebration, e.g. Rav Yoseph's saying that he
would have made a "yama tava", i.e thrown a party, for his
colleagues if a particular halakha had been different (Kiddushin
31a). It would seem that, even when the term refers to a religious
holiday, it was used to emphasize  its festive rather than its
ritualistic aspect. Thus, while I can hardly claim to have
researched the point adequately, I doubt very much that "yom-tov"
would have been applied to days of mourning  like Tish`ah B'Av, or
to "the Days of Awe".

As to Yom Kippur  specifically, the Talmud relates (Mishnah Yoma
7,8) that  when the  High Priest  came out of the Holy of Holies
unscathed, he " hayah oseh yom yov l'ohavav (would throw a party for
his friends)". One might also  recall the  saying (Ta`anit 26b):
"There were no "yamim tovim" in Israel [before the destruction of
the Temple _A.H.] to equal the fifteenth of Ab and Yom Kippur when
the  daughters of Israel whould dress in white  ... [and] dance in
the vineyards.  And what would they say? `Young man, raise your eyes
and see what to choose  for yourself". However, in neither of these
two cases is Yom Kippur referred to as a "yom tov" in the  sense of
"holiday".  In the first, it simply means `a party'; in the second,
looking back nostalgically to the "good old days" before the sack of
Jerusalem, it means "a GOOD day".

Subject: Authentic pronunciations of _yarmulke_

I always heard _yamike_, but have always seen it spelled _yarmulke_.
Is _yamike_ an authentic native pronunciation?  Does anyone say
_yarmulke_?

The _u_ to _i_ I ascribe to southern Yiddish, but what happened to
the _r_ and _l_?

Catching up on recent postings:

1) Zev, might the town be Zdunske-volye (Polish:  Zdunska Wola, with
an accent aigu over the "n")?  This is in the Lodz area, I think,
but I don't have a map in front of me.

2) _za fidele_ is poylish yidish from the area (Lodz, etc.) where
_mayn_, _dayn_ and _zayn_ are realized [ma~:], [da~:], [za~:], i.e.,
a long nasalized [a]. Di mishpokhe Sherman with their Stashever
Yiddish speaks this dialect, neyn?

3) Yehupets is, as far as I know, purely oysgetrakht (whence the
notion that it corresponds to Kiev?).  I don't know whether Yehupets
was a creation of Sholem-Aleykhem, but it's used idiomatically to
mean 'some far off place', 'some random geographical location' (like
Podunk).  Boyberik, as Zachary Baker mentioned, corresponds to
Sholem-Aleykhem's Boyarka but is also the Yiddish name of (Polish
town) Bo'brka.  Zachary, you say that the Yiddish is Boyberke.  I
thought Boyberik, just like in Sh"A's usage.  Kasrilevke is Sh"A's
creation, a town named after its water carrier Kasriel.

4) "A khasene in birebidzhan" is by Itsik Fefer.

5) Beatrice, yes, v/1 exclamation is available in Yiddish as in
other Germanic languages.

6) I re-post my request to all readers:  please put me in touch with
Yiddish speakers in the Boston area.  I've been here a week now and
would like to be in touch with some eygene.
