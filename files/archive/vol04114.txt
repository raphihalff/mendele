Subject: No one should be intimidated!

No lover of Yiddish at whatever level should feel intimidated by
contributions from the more learned.  Kumt un varemt zikh oys nebn
mekhayedike pripetshik.  Of course Mendele should welcome _all_ who show
an interest in Yiddish language and literature whether they are expert
grammarians and Romanizers or not.

Here's my two cents worth. I believe that nobody is calling for Mendele
to adopt an exclusionary policy.  My own attitude grows out of experience
with local study groups who meet face to face. By analogy, it might apply
to e-mail groups like Mendele.  Some show up with love for knowledge with
time and ability to study and share their fruits.  Some have love for
knowledge and ability but little time to spare for study.  All the
aforementioned should be warmly welcomed.  The only ones not welcome are
the rare anti-intellectual yahoos with absolute resistance to learn
anything, growing out of disdainful disrespect for knowledge and
scholarship including Yiddish.  I have come across one or two of the
latter in my local Orange County, California neighborhood.  I expect that
Mendeleniks with ardent love for learning (I hope to be included) will
continue to argue for consistency in Romanization (e.g. according to a
system like YIVO's), and for high grammatical and orthographic standards,
but I sense no hint of a desire to exclude anyone with a love for
Yiddish.  As the song says, "Lomir ale in eynem di ale Mendelenikes
mekabl ponim zayn, un lomir ale in eynem trinken a gleyzele vayn!"

Lomir dertseylen epes nayes af yidish (a maysele, a vits, vos ir vilt)
fun tsayt tsu tsayt.  Az me leyent un me shraybt romanizirtn yidish tog
ayn tog oys, lernt men zikh oys gants fayn.  Der iker iz: a libe far
yidish, un koved farn mame-loshn. A libe far gramatik, un zukhn a glaykhn
veg far ale tsu tretn zenen oykh zer sheyn un nutslekh, ober nisht der

Subject: "Rov" vs "Rabay"

I have noticed that in Yiddish, including the supposedly left-wing
"Forverts", that we discriminate against the Orthodox rabbis by using a
separate term for them, e.g., an Orthodix "Rov" versus the term "Rabay"
for every other rabbi. Is it not time that we stop this discrimination
and use one common term, say, "Rabay", for all rabbis? There is enough
division within the people of Israel that we don't need pejorative words
for our sages.

Subject: Oranges and pomegranates

As a child I always found the song about "A cousine" fascinating because
of a certain line.  The young and attractive female cousin, who had just
come over from the old country, was said to have cheeks like red oranges:
"Beckelech vie rote pomerantsen."

But then, if the Yiddish for an orange is "pomerants" what is the Yiddish
word for a pomegranate?

Subject: Welcome "Bobe Marcia"

I'd like to welcome Marcia Gruss Levinsohn (Mendele 4.109,2) to Mendele.
Since she is too modest to sing her own praises, let me make an
unsolicited attempt.

Marcia's class, Mishpokhe Yiddish, is a labor of love, an institution in
the Washington area (she's run it for more years than I remember).  It's
her own personal mitzva and mission to expose very young children (ages
3-7) to Yiddish, through songs and activities.  When my son attended
kindergarten in a Maryland Jewish day school, he enjoyed a minicourse in
Yiddish that Marcia taught at that school.

Mendelniks with young children should also know of Marcia's children's
book, _Di dray bern_, nicely illustrated and accompanied by a tape.  It's
available from her directly (mashinke@wam.umd.edu), and also I believe
from Workman's Circle. There are few modern books available for very
young students of Yiddish, but here's one with a story line that all kids
will recognize.

Subject: Hebrew for the Mac

Can anyone suggest reasonably priced software to permit one to write in
Yiddish on a Mac?

Subject: Rav-K'tav bidirectional word processing program for Macintosh

Does anyone have an address for "MicroMacro Ltd." in Israel? This company
made Rav-K'tav, a bidirectional word processing program, which I use for
writing in Yiddish. The version I have only works with older Macintosh
machines, apparently only with those have a 68000 central processor (the
new machines have 68030 or 68LC040). Maybe someone would know how to make
my version of Rav-K'tav work with a newer machine? Thanks.

Subject: Case in macaronic constructions

A recent solicitation for contributions, from an organization whose
officials certainly ought to know what to think of germanisms, closes
with

    "... best wishes to you for a _gut yontef_ and a _gut yohr_."

The "_puster_ (empty) h", as Zellig Bach (4.102) would call it, should by
the YIVO convention be dropped from the last word, which ought therefore
to be written _yor_.

Of more general interest:  Is there an agreed-upon way of dealing with
foreign words from inflected languages in English sentences?  In the
phrase quoted, _yor_ is neuter, and "a" is the indefinite article, so
"for a ... _gut yor_" is OK.  But because _yontef_ is masculine,
shouldn't the dative adjective (following the preposition "for") be
_gutn_; or could the writer argue that the English preposition doesn't
govern the case of the Yiddish adjective in a _mishshprakhiker
[mishshprakhikn?] zats_?  The problem would of course vanish if we
followed Leybl Botvinik's advice (4.111) and avoided mixed-language
sentences altogether; but that seems unnecessarily restrictive.

Subject: Dutch Yiddish: Hartog Beem

In reply to Meyshe-Yankl Sweet (vol. 4.108):

A complete bibliography of Hartog Beem's publications has been compiled
by Shulamit Vomberg-Samuel, _Mekhkarim al toledot yahadut holand_ 3
(1981): 273-276.

In the same volume of _Mekhkarim_ a description of Beem's life can be
found. A shorter obituary of Beem with reference to his most important
work on Dutch Yiddish has appeared in _Oksforder Yidish_ 1 (1991) and an
article which describes the importance of his work for research on
Northwestern Yiddish came out in Dov-Ber Kerler, ed., _History of Yiddish
Studies_ (London, 1991).

_She'erith. Resten van een taal. Woordenboekje van het Nederlands
Jiddisch_ (Sheyris. Remnants of a language. A small dictionary of Dutch
Yiddish) has been reprinted. I believe everything else is out of print.

_Jerosche_, a collection of Dutch Yiddish proverbs and expressions and
_Uit Mokum en de Mediene_, a list of Dutch words of Jewish (Yiddish and
Hebrew) origins, both deserve to be reprinted.
