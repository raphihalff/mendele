Subject: Karl May in Yiddish

Dear friends of Yiddish!  Is there anyone who could help me? I know
that stories from the German author Karl May (Carl Friedrich May/ Dr. Karl
May ) have been translated to the Yiddish Language. Unfortunately I don't
know which story it was and in which year the translation appeared. I am
very interested to get more information about that. Is it possible to get a
copy of the text somewhere or are there books still on sale ? Mr. Gruschka
from phil.fak. University Duesseldorf gave me the information that if there
is anybody who could help my research I will find him in "Mendele.net". I
would be very glad to hear of you. Thanks for a mail! I am very sorry my
English is very bad and I cannot speak Yiddish. Best regards.

Subject: An etymological observation

I present the following snippet from my ongoing translation of The
Szczebrzeszyn Yizkor Book. My footnote contains an observation of something
that I learned, and was new to me. Accordingly, I thought I might share it.

Jack Berger

******

In the morning, and towards evening, it is understood that we studied and
prayed. However, during the afternoon, the Radzyner shtibl served
clandestine activities of Zionism, because then, during Czarist times,
Zionism was illegal.

From the outset, the older boys were wary of us. When we drew near to their
table, they would hit us mercilessly, but later on, they would gradually
draw us into their `work.' We would stand watch, standing up to 20 meters
from one another, and when we would espy the police guard or the watchman at
a distance, we would begin to pass the signal from one to another, using a
code word: `Lekha Dodi' or `Brakh Dodi KaTzvi' and the one standing close to
the shtibl was supposed to shout inside: `Fly like a lapwing'....16

16 The Yiddish phrase in question is `Tchivchok geyt...' The lapwing is a
bird known for its erratic flight trajectory, making it hard to bring down
or capture. Of equal interest, is the fact that this is very likely the
source of the Israeli Hebrew slang expression `Tchik-chak' which is used to
indicate that you want to get something done quickly and without delay.

Subject: Yiddish Western/Frontier texts

Does anyone know, in addition to the works of I. Raboy and _Kentuki_ by
Schwartz, are there any other Yiddish texts out there that deal with Jews in
the "Wild West" or on the Frontier?                       f

Thanks,

Warren Hoffman

Subject: Songbooks

Firstly, I want to thank all of you who have taken the time to look in your
collections to help with my questions in the past.  I really appreciate your
efforts, which help my research.

Secondly, I am writing to ask for your assistance yet again.  I'm looking
for the cover and first pages up to page 7 (which I am missing) of an old
book of Yiddish and Hebrew lyrics, called Unzer gezang (not the one by Leon
Wajner).  I am also searching for a few old Yiddish songbooks mentioned in
the index with the following authors/editors or titles:

Gezang un shpil (Maybe from Y. Gladshteyn)
Lefkovitsh
Bulkin
Klingen hemerlakh (R. Boyarske )
Y. P.  (Yud Pey) Katz
Frayhayt lider
Tsen lider (Mikhl Gelbart)
Folks lider "lire" (Lamed-yud-resh-alef)

If any of you have these in your collection or library, I would
appreciate hearing from you.

a dank in foroys,

Lorele Simon

Subject: I.B. Singer's "Two"

I am trying to locate the Yiddish original of a story by I. B. Singer =
called "Two" in English. It was translated by Joseph Singer and appeared =
in the English version in THE NEW YORKER in 1976. As this story will be
part of a Bashevis-Colloquium in Hamburg on Nov. 21st 2004, it is quite
urgent to find the source. I'd be very greatful for a hint.

A sheynem dank,

Subject: Is it a Yiddish idiom?

I'm writing on the Hebrew version of Benjamin III, and I'm wondering if a
phrase that appears in the first paragraph of chapter fourteen--"like a
mouse rescued from a pitcher of milk"--is in fact the translation of a
Yiddish idiom.  In Hillel Halkin's 1996 tranlsation of the Yiddish the same
phrase is used.  If someone could verify that this is a Yiddish idiom (and
tell me what it implies), that would be great.

Subject: "Sunrise, Sunset" in Yiddish

This is the yiddish text of "Sunrise, sunset", as translated by Shrage
Friedmann in the first yiddish stage performance by Shmuel Rudensky of
"Fiddler on the Roof":

Tog ayn, tog oys

Golde: Iz dos mayn meydele, dos kleyne? Iz es dos yingele ikh zey?
Tevye: Git nor a kuk vi shoyn dervaksn zenen zey!
Golde: Ven iz zi azoy sheyn gevorn? Ven iz er oysgevaksn hoykh?
Tevye: Ersht nekhtn hobn zey geshpilt in hoyf!
Bokherim: Tog ayn tog oys, tog ayn tog oys, dos iz undzer loyt!
Meydlekh: Tog ayn tog oys, tog ayn tog oys, dos iz dayn basher!
Loyfn di yorn nokh anander, trogn zey freydn mit a trer.
Golde: Zol ikh mit eytses zey farzorgn? Zol ikh zey helfn efsher, zog?
Tevye: Got helft zey yedern frimorgn, tog bay tog.
Pertshik: Zey zeyen oys vi naygeboyrn.
Hodl: Punkt vi a nay porfolk zet oys.
Pertshik un Hodl: Iz nokh a khupe do far undz nor bloyz?
Ale: Tog ayn tog oys, tog ayn tog oys, dos iz dayn basher!
Loyfn di yorn nokh anander, trogn zey freydn mit a trer.

Winter 2002-2003 a big Italian production of "Fiddler on the Roof" has been
performed, with dialogues in Italian and songs in a new Yiddish translation,
which I have done. An English/Italian stage book to this production collects
photos of this performance directed by the Italian Jewish actor Moni Ovadia,
texts of all the lyrics in Yiddish (both transliterated and in hebrew
letters), English and Italian, and a CD with all the songs in Yiddish. Book
references: Moni Ovadia "A Roof suspended between Heaven and Earth"
Ricordi-BMG Publications 2003 ISBN 88-7592-726-x (Interested readers can
e-mail the publisher: print@ricordi.it - www.ricordi.it)

Hereunder my new translation of "Sunrise, sunset":

Tog ayn, tog oys

Golde: Hob ikh dos meydele getrogn? Iz dos mayn yingele, mayn kind?
Tevye: Ven zaynen zey tsu layt gevorn? Ze nor atsind!
Tevye: Ersht nekhtn zaynen zey geven kleyn, zis!
Bokherim: Tog-ayn tog-oys, tog-ayn tog-oys, teg flien farbay!
