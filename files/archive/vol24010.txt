Subject: Translation questions

Mendelyaner, 

I am in the process of translating the "rytmish resitatsiyes" of Yiddish radio performer/actor Victor Packer and have come across several words and phrases which I cannot find in Harkavy, Weinreich or Beinfeld-Bochner. 

armider pozhine 

"lig zikh dokh drakhves di gvansame brek." 

"ash fin ale hent" (vertl?) 

Your help is greatly appreciated.

Subject: Morris Rosenfeld song for striking furriers

In his 1929 Yiddish book on the Jewish unions, Bernard Weinstein, founder of the United Hebrew Trades, mentions that the poet Morris Rosenfeld wrote a song on behalf of the striking furriers' union in 1912.  The song is also quoted in Fifty Years of Progress 1912-1962:  "May the fine furs go straight to hell, They do not warm us...."  Does anyone know the title of the song, or if it was published?
