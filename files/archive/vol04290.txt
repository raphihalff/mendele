Subject: Litvish [e] and [ey]

Yude Rosof, say it's not true. You didn't _really_ believe that Litvaks
don't distinguish [e] and [ey]. DID you? What do you do with pairs like
_bret_ 'board' and _breyt_ 'broad', _zet_ 'sees' and _zeyt_ 'sows',
_shtet_ 'cities' and _shteyt_ 'stands'? Write them all with _e_?

Furthermore, comparing the [ey] in Litvish [leyng]'length' with [ey] in
Polish Yiddish [teyg] 'days' is like comparing apples and oranges (to
coin a phrase).

Acknowledging, but with no apology to the non-linguists, the [ey] in
[leyng] is a positionally determined, thus non- distinctive variant of
the phoneme /e/ in Litvish Yiddish. It occurs only before the sequences
_ng_ and _nk_. Similarly, [ay] in Litvish [layng, shlayng, baynk,
kraynk]. The Litvish /ey/ and /ay/ phonemes in words like _breyt_ 'board'
and 'bread', and _tsayt_ 'time' do not occur in the stated positions.

The [ey] or[e:] in Polish Yiddish _tejg_ 'days', _leybn_ 'to live'
_reygn_ 'rain', etc. is the sole variant of the phoneme /ey/ or /e:/,
free of any ordinarily discernible positional variants.

Subject: Yiddish in Schopfloch

In Mendele Vol. 286, Zellig Bach mentions Schopfloch and the local slang
of the town which contains many words of Yiddish origin. Hadassa Shy
wrote an interesting article about that topic, with the help of Dov-Ber
Kerler. It was published in _Oksforder yidish_ II. I believe a second
article on the same subject is forthcoming.

Subject: Mendele who-is-who

Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan proposed (Vol. 4.277) a collection of
introductions to the Mendele list.  I think this is an excellent idea.
The minhag to introduce oneself is a nice one, and collecting the
introductions in one place would make them even more useful.

So I have started to (automatically) extract introductions from the back
issues of mendele up to current.  The count is now near 350.

This is just to tell you that something of the sort is certainly
coming.  So, if you haven't sent an introduction yet and want
to be in the who-is-who (I like ver-iz-der-doziker), you can do so now.

Subject: Konen/kenen

Peter Kluehs had asked about the difference in kenen/konen, in the
context of the German verb koennen. Mikhl Herzog and I both had our
replies placed side by side on one issue of Mendele. Sometime later I
received a private note, "correcting" me but not helping me in any way as
to what the real scoop is. I feel very strongly, that if people disagree
on Mendele, that it's pretty important to put it to the list, especially
if it is an error of fact.

And so, I would like comment from others about kenen/konen as possibly
arising from an attempt to regularize the conjugation of the verb (which
in German has "kann" in the singular, and "koennen" in theplural) I just
want to know whether kenen/konen are regularizations of corresponding
older Yiddish forms corresponding to konen in singular and kenen in
plural.

Nu?

Subject: Re: kenen / konen

Mikhl, when you say Yiddish doesn't seem to distinguish kenen and konen,
does it matter which meaning you're talking about? I believe that in our
dialect, we use kenen for more "to be acquainted with" and konen more for
"to be able to", though I think there's some overlap in both directions.

Subject: Glatshteyn and Ozick

There was indeed a ceremony in which Cynthia Ozick spoke about her story
"Envy, or Yiddish in America" and I believe your memory serves you well,
Mikhl, in recalling it as a Bnai Brith event.  If I remember correctly,
Glatshteyn was posthumously awarded a Bnai Brith Book Award for his 1971
book, "Gezangen fun rekhts tsu links" and Ozick gave the speech.  Other
speculation has it that the untranslated Yiddish writer was not Glatsh-
teyn but Khaim Grade. Incidentally, when I asked Ozick about all of this,
she told me that the story actually had nothing to do with Yiddish, but
was rather her rendition of experiences around her uncle and meetings of
the American Hebrew Poetry Society in the Bronx during the 1930's. The
decision to present the characters as Yiddish writers was sparked by the
fact that she was doing some translations from Yiddish for Irving Howe at
the time.

Subject: Traching YIddish literature in translation

Daniela HarPaz:

I have taught the subject for many years and have much to say. However, I
also have an injured right hand and posting is painful. B'kitzer use
Irving Howe, anthology intro.and any other stuff he does on Yidlit.  Do
include Hillel Halkin's translation of Tevye although some colleagues
find it cumbersome. Give them opening lecture stressing earliest Yiddish
literature and language, mention Bove Bukh.  Use theory only when it
works.  Don't show Hester Street it's not Yiddish, show Yidl mitn Fidl,
Tevye-after they have read it or anyother of the good Yiddish films
available from Sharon Rivo at Brandeis. There's much more ober es tut mir
vey di hant. good luck,

Subject: Yiddish and the North American Indian

Last night I attended an interview with Dan Gordon, the screenwriter of
the new film "Murder in the First."  Although it was fascinating to hear
how a film develops from the original screenplay to the final production
that is released to the public, Dan offered an interesting anectode about
the Yiddish language.  It is a tale about Americana and Yiddishkeit that
I would like to share with you.

Apparently some of Dan's relatives migrated to Canada from eastern
European in the early part of this century.  At the time, Canada did not
want any more Jews settling in the eastern part of Canada.  Immigration
for Jews was restricted to the western part of Canada.  These immigrants
settled as storekeepers, farmers or ranchers.  One of Dan's uncles became
a rancher (i.e. a Jewish cowboy).  Once, on a visit to his uncle's ranch
in the 1950s, Dan was invited to visit an Indian tribe, called the
"Schwartzer Feeselech" (the Blackfeet), that lived nearby. When they
reached the Indian village, Dan's uncle greeted the village elder in the
Indian's native tongue. The Indian responded in Yiddish...with a perfect
inflection of an Eastern European Jew.

Now what's an American/Canadian Indian doing speaking Yiddish? Apparently
there were no Europeans, other than the Jewish ranchers in that area of
the country.  The Jews learned Blackfoot and the Blackfeet learned
Yiddish.

So it seems that Mel Brooks was not too far off the mark in Blazing
Saddles when he had his Indians speaking Yiddish.
