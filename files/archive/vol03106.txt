Subject: Introduction

As a new subscriber to Mendele I have been asked to introduce
myself. My research interests are pre-modern Yiddish language and
literature in general, and Northwestern Yiddish in particular. (I am
from the Netherlands and Dutch is my first language.) I wrote my
dissertation on Yiddish Bible translations and am presently working
on polemical pamphlets (Diskursn fun di alte un di naye kille,
Amsterdam 1797-8). This year I will be teaching Yiddish language at
Harvard.

gut yontiv to everyone, a very special thanks to our esteemed
shames, and an extra special round of applause for his spectacular
holiday graphics! wow.

Ellen prince

[The shames, on the other hand, pleads guilty to the high crime of
plagiarism.  He adapted a greeting from his shutef, Victor Bers.]

Subject: Yiddish and the KGB

I read in a 1992 AJS newsletter that some Yiddish manuscripts were
found in KGB files. Have any of you read any more recent references
to this intriguing item?

Subject:  YONTIF

In Mendele Vol 3.105, Amitai Halevi writes:

>Since saying "Gut yontev" on Rosh Hashono is kosher according to
>modern Israeli doctrine:  Gut yontev - everyone.

***********************************

May I add that it is not only MODERN usage; the Rambam specifically
lists Rosh Hashanna as one of the yom tovim [yontif is the way I
hear it] in halichos yom tov [zmanim].

It is standard practice among the p'rushim [yishuv yashan or old
colony of religious] of Jerusalem among whom I have lived and prayed
these twenty years to say "gut yontif" on Yom ha-Kipporim.

Subject: Introduction

We live on the Upper West Side of New York, and belong to the West
Side Shule, a school for our ten year old daughter that is devoted
to "secular" aspects of Judiasm and Judaic culture.  Gerry Segal,
President of the Shule, and Yiddishe Cyberman extraordinaire told me
of this internet facility as I was just becoming enmeshed in it.

At the Shule, we enjoy the comraderie of shared Jewish and Yiddish
heritage and custom, and try to convey the same to our kids (more or
less successfully - my hope is not as badly as was conveyed to me in
"Hebrew School," where I think Yiddishe culture and Judaism were
blandidized and judgmentalized to cancel out any interest in
children at all).

For me, becoming involved in this Mendele group means trying to
connect to my Jewish heritage in a variety of ways, some of which
are still not clear to me.  Some of these connections are so-called
"secular" and have to do with enjoying hearing songs, seeing a
Passover meal, listening to Yiddish tales and parables, and
realizing what it is to be Jewish.  There is another connection that
remains elusive, that of the more religious/spiritual realm, that is
more than elusive and more than likely will not be met by this
format.

In any event, that is somewhat of where I/we are coming from in
connection to Yiddish study.

Looking forward to future interactions.

Zach Rosen
