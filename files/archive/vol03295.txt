Subject: Literary translations into Yiddish

A hartsikn dank mayne Yugntruf-khaveyrim (amolike un hayntike), vos hobn
gedenkt dem moker funem yidishn nusekh fun Lewis Carrolls a lid
"Jabberwocky."  Kh'ob gekent shvern benemones az ikh hob amol azoyns
gezen, nor fargesn vu.  Un itst vel ikh ariber af a breyterer frage:

I have always been puzzled by the fact that some classics of world
literature made it into Yiddish translation (alongside some decided
non-classics) while others did not.  Co-territoriality helps to explain
why translations of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky -- and later, Sienkiewicz and
Wyspianski -- abound.  Jewish themes and sympathies also help to explain
why certain writers got translated, and I imagine that the vogue of
turn-of-the-century naturalism appealed to a politically radicalized
Yiddish readership.  The prestige and popularity of French culture
throughout Eastern Europe may explain the many translations of Dumas and
Maupassant (probably the largest repository in the Western Hemisphere, of
Guy de Maupassant's works -- at least if measured by weight -- is a
certain warehouse in Western Massachusetts, known to contain a million
other books in Yiddish), but all in all, the corpus of translations is
very patchy.

Turning to English literature, why indeed is there no Yiddish translation
of "Alice in Wonderland" -- which was already a bestseller by the time
that Yiddish-speaking immigrants made it to Britain and America --?
Disraeli and Shakespeare made it into Yiddish -- even Charles Dickens's
"A Christmas Carol" has been graced by its Yiddish version ("Vaynakht" --
or perhaps "Vey nakht"? -- translated by Esther Kreitman, whose youngest
brother was later to be a Nobel Prizewinning Yiddish author).  Jane
Austen and Anthony Trollope, however, are absent (as best as I can
recall, sitting at home, away from the YIVO Library's catalog).

The great American novels are, if anything, even more sparsely
represented in Yiddish translation.  Sinclair Lewis's "Babbitt" is a
curiosity, but that's one of the few famous American novels of the 1920s
that made it into Yiddish.  (No "Farewell to Arms," no "Great Gatsby"...)

Are there any literary scholars out there who would care to speculate
about the factors that caused certain works to be translated and others
not?  (I am specifically referring to the era when there was a mass
Yiddish readership and a commercially viable Yiddish book trade.)  Is it
possible that the multilingualism of many Jewish immigrants rendered
translations unnecessary, as they acquired English?  Or is it a matter of
cultural and literary tastes that made "Alice in Wonderland" less
appealing to Yiddish readers than "A Tale of Two Cities"?

Submitted for your consideration, fellow MENDELnikes and MENDELnitses.

Subject: Perenial Yiddish debate

The debate over what constitutes proper Yiddish usage as opposed to
coloquial dialectal variants of mameloshen seems to brake out on Mendele
with reasonable frequency. In the 19th century Yiddish began to grow a
litterary tradition which, in the absence of a national state, might have
helped settle that question. Unfortunately, as we are all painfully
aware, the holocaust destroyed the natural soil on which that literature
grew. the current attempts to resurect a literary Yiddish seem to me as
quixotically noble as the earlier attempt to foster Esperanto by creating
a body of Esperanto literature. It's putting the cart before the horse.
There must be a soil in which the literature can take root and that can
only happen if there is a living community employing the language as
their everyday zhargon, patois, dialect, call it what you will.

But all is not hopeless for Yiddish. Some years ago I was walking through
the Mea Shearim in Jeruslaem when a little boy of about 7 came over to me
and asked me a question in Hebrew. As my knowledge of Hebrew is very
rusty I asked him if he spoke Yiddish. He replyed sort of indignantly
"Farvos nisht? Ikh bin a Yid nisht a Goy!" I could have kissed him.

There are several surviving communities in the world where Yiddish is
their natural language rather than an auxiliary. We see them on the
streets of Brooklyn, Jerusalem, Moncey, but they don't don't interact
with the professional Yiddishist of academia, nor should they be expected
to. It is the duty of the academic to go out in the real world to learn
what is happening out there rather than theorizing in an ivory tower.
Some time ago I asked a question about the linguistic practices of these
communities. My question was not intended rhetorically but rather because
I really wanted to know. Has Mendelnik ever looked into that? Do they use
or shun what some have been calling daytshmerisms? Do the use lezn or
leyenen, or perhaps both but make distinctions between their employment?
Do they say vinde or fenster, bagrebnis or levaya, ikh hob dos gern or
ikh glaykh dos, feygele or parpar or something still different? Is there
a large difference between Satmarish and Lubovitch, Jerusalem and NY?
Until questions like these are answered the prescriptive rules of the
academics are really vacuous and the Yiddish that they are fostering and
teaching in the universities will remain the sterile academic game that
Esperanto has become.

We should remember that even the full, active power of the French state
has not succeeded in compelling the "purification" of the French
language. What then can be expected from nebakh a por arme Mendelniks vos
kenen sikh nisht eynem mit eynander aynshtimen?

However you slice it, migldik is ekldik in my book.

Subject: Bubbi's and Bobba's of Canadian Jews

Mark Flumerfelt wrote that Toronto Jews tend to say "bubbi and zedi"
whereas Montreal Jews said "bauba and zeda".  I believe the reason is the
demographic history of the two places.  Here is my conjecture: Toronto
was settled first by British Jews who had become fairly assimilated by
the time the Polish Jews arrived in the twentieth century.  Montreal's
Jews on the other hand are mainly Russian and Lithuanian.  (These are
gross generalizations, I realize.) The Polish influence explains the "u"
in "bubbi" of Toronto, while the earlier assimilation of the British Jews
accounts for the cutesy North American "i" diminutive in "bubbi and
zedi".  Montreal in general seems to have kept a more European flavor and
sensibility to its Yidishkayt, imho.

Subject: Introduction

Hello, I just joined this mailing list and presently know no Yiddish.  As
a senior at Harvard studying economics (and almost finished with my
thesis), I don't have too much free time.  I'm taking my second semester
of Modern Hebrew right now, and I have become very interested in Yiddish
literature and language over the past year.  I'd be interested in any
recommendations anyone could make for introductory textbooks, etc.

I'm looking forward to this!
