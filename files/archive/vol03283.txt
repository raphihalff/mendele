Subject: muz, darf

	It's really not hard to understand. Muz means must, and darf
means needs. The usage in yiddish is as flexible as the usage in English.

Eg: He must have money. He needs money, he needs to have money. Each is
differently semantically.

big hollywood movie a few yrs ago, _yentl_, starring barbra streisand,
plus mandy patimkin and amy irving.

Subject: About the Gay Parpar

Daniella HarPaz  wrote "In Hebrew  there exists a slang  word "parpar"
for homosexuals, meaning butterfly...".

Later  David Braun  accepts  that and  writes: "I  too  was under  the
impression that _feygele_ came from  Eng. _fag_ only on American soil.
Daniella  HarPaz's note  that Mod  Heb uses  _parpar_ makes  me think,
though:  what are  the  slang terms  in Russian,  Polish?  One of  the
Yiddish  words  for _butterfly_  is  _zumer-feygele_.   If Russian  or
Polish  use 'butterfly'  equivalents, we'd  have a  story for  Yiddish
incorporating  those forms  and  passing  them on  to  Hebrew (or  Heb
getting them directly from Russian or Polish)".

When I first  read Daniella's suggestion I was doubtful,  as I had not
heard *that* use of parpar.  I have now checked in the bible of modern
spoken Hebrew, the  dictionary of Dan Ben-Amotz  and Netiva Ben-Yehuda
(both volumes) and  there it states that parpar (in  addition to other
uses) is  a person who is  unfaithful to one's spouse.   No homosexual
hints are  given to  this term.   They bring  also the  female version
"parparit" for such a lady.  The verb lehitparper is commonly used for
someone having  a good  time without too  many restrictions.   None of
these have any homosexual overtones as  such, and I could imagine that a
parpar could also be used about a gay man who is not faithful to his
partner.

I think that the source of the usage for parpar is the ease with which a
butterfly moves from one flower to the next.

Subject: number non-agreement

Ellen, examples of the kind you brought are all over the place in the
literature. I too have a list with dozens of examples from Sholem
Aleychem, Mendele etc.

Best,

Subject: names-for-character-types

In response to the query about character names, I have to add my uncle
(olev ha-sholem)'s frequent use of a 'Kuni Leml.'  I now know this came
from Yiddish theatre.  I learned this on my first visit to Yivo where I
saw a poster for the play.  I don't know too much about the play, though.
Perhaps a Mendelnik can shed more light?  I think the guy was anything
but clever, or otherwise hapless.

Subject: Childrens' Jingle

Re the recently received version of the children's jingle

A guten morgen malakh
Vu ikh geh fal ikh
etc.

and ending with the very unJewish aspect of the husband beating the wife

Zogt die kinder: oy oy oy
Zogt der tate: gut azoy

the word Malakh in the fist line puzzles me as well as does the entire
tenor of the rhyme for which Malakh is quite incongruous. My question is
that perhaps there was and earlier censored version of this jingle which
began

A guten morgn galakh
Vu ikh geh fal ikh
etc.

It would then form a consistent picture of a drunk, wife-beating goy.
Am I just being chauvinistic or can anyone supply any information for or
against this conjecture?
