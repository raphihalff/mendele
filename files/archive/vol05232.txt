Subject: Is Yiddish dying?

I wish to respond to the comments made by Zachary Baker and Ellen Prince
concerning my submission in Vol. 5.224

Thank you for your criticisms, most of which I accept (in my heart but not in
public). However...

Zachary Baker:

"Dead means that there are zero native speakers..."

This is a possible position. There are good theoretical reasons for a serious
linguist to accept it. However, I am not a serious linguist. The
generalization "Man is a featherless biped"  remains true even if you come up
with a man who has no legs and who has glued chicken feathers to himself. But
it's artificial. Numbers make a big difference how you view the situation.

Similarly with languages. When you cite the example of the last member of an
American Indian tribe, prior to his passing, that tends to confirm the
reaction that his language is already dead, rather than refute it. If you have
normal human feelings (maybe serious linguists don't), it brings a tear to
your eye. Even more so pockets of Yiddish resistance. The main army, nebich,
got slaughtered.

Ellen Prince:

1.You know full well (but are too polite to say) that I have no authority for
my more dogmatic pronouncements.

2. Why make such pronouncements? Take a look at Leybl Botvinik's posting in
Vol. 5.222, Helft Yidish vern gezunt. Leybl prescribes wonderful cures for the
sick patient. But even an amateur novi can foresee that the patient will never
take the prescription.

3. So why say that the patient is already dead? See the Chumash Beis Yehudah's
commentary to Rashi's commentary on Exodus 25 v. 2 "And they shall take for me
an offering..." The Torah advised that the Jews should set aside gold and
silver for the Sanctuary well before Moses and Aaron asked for it. so that the
Jews would not regret parting with it when the time came to hand it over.
Having set the gold and silver aside for that purpose, the Jews would no
longer think of it as theirs and so would part with it more cheerfully (as God
wanted). Similarly with Yiddish.  Adjust now to the fact that Yiddish no
longer lives and avoid the bitter disappointment later.

4. Hebrew was a partially living language, even in Golus, because there as a
point to using it apart from the wish to keep it alive, viz. to pray to God
and other holy purposes. There is not a similar powerful reason for Jews to
keep Yiddish alive that way, even partially. The few babies in Palestine who
made Hebrew a living language were the precursors of the next wave. The few
babies today who might be said to keep Yiddish alive are, again nebekh, the
last traces of the old wave. Everything depends on the arrow of time. Time's
arrow was with Hebrew, a rising tide, while it is against Yiddish, a falling
tide.

Subject: Living and dead languages

For another perspective on the ongoing discussion about the state of Yiddish,
one might remember the observation of the great Polish linguist Jan Baudouin
de Courtenay (1845-1929).  In a 1908 article he wrote that "when we talk about
whether languages are 'alive' or 'dead,' this shows that we do not understand
the essence of language. Any language is 'dead' for those who do not know it."

Incidentally, in a lecture he gave in 1888 in Dorpat (later Iur'iev, now
Tartu, Estonia), he criticized those who disdain Yiddish as a "jargon,"
pointing out that "such jargons have sometimes grown into highly respected and
powerful languages.  It is enough to mention the English language."

Subject: Death and revival of Hebrew

In the context of our discussion of the health and future of Yiddish, some
comments on the history of Hebrew might help.  I'm not asserting that anything
is identical in the two cases, only that looking at the history of Hebrew
might help clarify some of the issues.

Beginning with the conquest of the northern kingdom of Israel by the Assyrians
in the 700s BCE, more and more Israelites in the north began to speak Aramaic
in daily life instead of Hebrew.  Of course they used Hebrew in religion and
literature.  This decline was a long gradual process, part of the spread of
Aramaic among all the peoples of the Near East at the time, replacing such
languages as Phoenician, Akkadian, Ugaritic, and Hittite.  In the southern
kingdom, Judea, children continued to learn Hebrew as their first language, as
it was spoken all around them.  After the Jewish revolts against the Romans in
the second century CE, however, the Romans massacred huge numbers of Judean
Jews, and many of the rest fled to the north and out of the country, and
switched to Aramaic.  It's likely that some survivors in Judea and some
families who had moved elsewhere continue to speak Hebrew for another
generation or a few; the family of Rabbi Yehuda ha-Nasi is probably one,
according to stories in the Talmud.  But eventually, sometime after the year
200 CE, no children anywhere were speaking Hebrew as their first language, and
those who learned it did so in the context of schooling.  At this point Hebrew
was a dead language by definition, since no children were speaking it as their
native vernacular language.  ("Dead," but not "buried," like Akkadian, for
instance, because for nearly two millennia no one knew how to read or write
Akkadian, or even knew of its existence.  Nowadays, when hundreds of scholars
can read the huge quantities of Akkadian texts which have been dug up and, if
they try real hard, write and maybe even speak a little, Akkadian is still
dead, though exhumed.)  Active of Hebrew continued to decline, until only
scholars could write it with much success.

The situation of Hebrew changed in the nineteenth century. Commpletely aside
from the new literary use of Hebrew in Europe, there was a pragmatic change:
the increasing number of Jews in Palestine, who spoke Arabic, Ladino, Yiddish,
etc., began in the middle of the nineteenth century to speak Hebrew with those
who didn't have the same native language.  This pragmatic use of Hebrew
preceded the ideological revival of Hebrew speech, advocated by Eliezer Ben
Yehuda and his associates, by a couple of generations, and undoubtedly made
that ideological revival possible.  Ben Yehuda got the idea of reviving Hebrew
when he met Palestinian Jews in Paris who could actually speak it.  So Hebrew
was revived because there was a need for it, people who wanted to talk with
each other and had no other language in common.
