i'm sure you're joking, but i can't resist:

in regard to berkeley not being a yinglish area, the fact
that there's a restaurant named balabosta is really not
relevant. there are many many many restaurants with chinese
names in berkeley, as i recall, but it ain't no chinglish
area. for an ethnic dialect, you need an environment where
children are raised hearing that dialect or the relevant
foreign lg, where that's the *norm*. so san francisco
chinatown yes, berkeley no.

this sounds like something one does to cattle, but that
surely isn't what you mean. could you please explain
'gendering'? thanks.

in brooklyn it was also apstesiker, or /apste:sike/ to be
more precise. (we had no postvocalic r's in any language.)
also nekstorike, by the way--same morphology.

can i guess saydinteres? side interest? or did it have a
more specific sense? (like extra-marital side interest?)

my guess for fletelet would be small apartment, on the
assumption that toronto uses the british 'flat', but that's
a wild guess.

no idea about solifite. what is it?

To Linda Feldman: the term "vaybertaytsh" refers to the
font/the typeface used for printing Yiddish, in contrast to
the square letters used for printing Hebrew. I should say,
"used to be used". The distinction doesn't apply any more
You might look at Max Weinreich's book "Di shvartse
pintelekh" or, for a fuller treatment, a work (date?
place?) by Herbert Zafron of Hebrew Union College,
Cincinnatti. You could write to him there.
 
Dave Sherman: I'm not sure how to elaborate except to say
that the dropping of postvocalic "r" is a regional
phenomenon, largely in Polish Yiddish, which leaves a
variety of "r-colored" vowels in its wake: tsike, pite, a
gite man; around Brisk (=Brest Litovsk), it's more like
tsika, pita, a gita; we also hear tsiko, pito, eyr iz a
gito. Maps in Volume 1 of the Atlas (forthcoming). Mikhl.

                     LUDIC YIDDISH (with a sting)
 
 
The Gashash Hachiver put on a sketch in Hebrew and then
repeated it in Yiddish -- in a good spirit, but the
association with Yiddish was clearly an association with
humor (as well as with Ashkenazim).  But the implication
was that "normal" Israelis did not know this strange
language and did not need to know it. One piercing note
which may not have caught everyone's attention was a
reference to an Israeli Sefaradi as an Arab, which reflects
actual Israeli slang usage.
 
Haifa's _Kolbo_ of 20 May 1988 reports on its front page
the claim of a young Arab woman that her Jewish boss
discriminated against her by forbidding her to speak Arabic
with her fellow-employees in a Western Carmel supermarket.
Stories of linguistic discrimation are exceedingly rare in
Israel and this one may have little basis in fact.
Normally, Jews do not care if Arabs speak Arabic to one
another, but a boss might not want Arab workers talking
when they could be working.  Some Jews might also feel that
the Arabs are talking about -.them-., a fear which would
make them uneasy. Jews often used "targum-loshn" to make it
impossible for gentiles -- who would understand the
Germanic component of Yiddish -- to grasp what they were
saying.

                      ****
 
             "A Tale of Two Sisters" by Barbara Lebow
 
 
In a review of this play by Andrea Jolles in -The Jewish
Monthly- (June-July 1988, p. 31), we read: "Playwright
Barbara Lebow explains that the Yiddish phrase is an
expression of endearment and connotes "inner resources
other that just a pretty face."

This is a wholly confused notion.  The two Yiddish words
(whose correct transcription is -sheyne meydl-) may be
glossed 'pretty/ attractive/nicelooking girl'.  The
particular dramatic context may suggest that the girl's
good looks are only the outer side of her attractive
person.  There is nothing in the phrase itself that denotes
more than 'pretty girl'. What we see here is Yiddish being
romanticized thru erroneous translation.  It is true that
-a sheyner yid- is 'a saintly Jew'; -sheyner- in that
phrase does -not- refer to physical appearance.  There is,
however, no analagous semantic development in -sheyne
meydl-, which is not different from -sheyner bokher-,
-sheyn kind-, etc.. To people who do not know French,
-asseyez-vous- sounds like a lot more than just plain 'sit
down!' -- but that is all it means.

                             *****
 
 
                       CIRCASSIAN IN ISRAEL
 
Those of you who are trying to teach your children Yiddish
and Hebrew as well as English, can take heart from the
example of the Israeli Circassians.  (I had one in my class
this year and he looked more Nordic than Heidi).

It is interesting that the younger children in Israel's two
Circassian villages are said to speak better Circassian
than their older brothers, which at first seems surprising.
The older children mingle their Circassian with many more
Hebrew words than do the younger children. This is
explained by the increasingly successful effort to teach
the Circassian children their ancestral tongue in the
elementary schools, an effort which deserves analysis.

Circassian children study four languages: Hebrew, Arabic,
English and Circassian.  Here is a marvelous laboratory for
sociolinguists and also for Jewish interlinguists.  The
influence of a Jewish language (in this case, Hebrew) on
non-Jewish languages falls within the scope of Jewish
interlinguistics.
