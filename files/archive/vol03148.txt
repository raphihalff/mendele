In Mendele 3.147 Noyekh Miller writes:

"The sissel story has its comic elements; at least we like to play
it that way.  But it's a sad story as well.  Sholem Aleichem, in
"Vos iz Khanuke?", saw it.  So does the old hasidic story of the
song whose words and later melody are forgotten."

For we the ignorant (but interested), can you share the hasidic
story?  And perhaps also synopsize "Vos iz Khanuke?"

A dank

I would have supposed that the Yiddish cognates of Schmuck and Putz,
if they existed, would be `shmuk' or, more likely, `shmik' and
`puts' or `pits' and would be pronounced accordingly, rather than
`shmok' and `pots', which correspond to the pronunciation I have
always heard. The spelling `schmuck' and `putz' could just be the
typical, non-standard rendering common in the U.S., based on English
phonetics and some misplaced preference for pseudo-Germanic
orthography.  So, are the Yiddish words actually cognates of the
German words?

An alternative explanation is that the rude Yiddish words actually
are pronounced `shmuk' and `puts' by native speakers.  (I never
heard my mother pronounce them!)  The common spelling may then have
been phonetically accurate (i.e., essentially identical to the
German words), but that English-speaking people modified the
pronunciation by misinterpreting the spelling according to the
conventions of English orthography.  Anyone know?

Subject: Man/mentsh, Schmuck,etc., Esau

In my retirement, I find myself working overtime. Still, hope to
find the time to comment on a number of back issues, including the
matters KHOYLEM, UFRUF, etc. I`m coming up for air now only for a
couple of minutes to comment briefly on three more recent items. I
should say that the nature of my keyboard prevents me from using a
number of symbols that might make reading easier (quotation marks,
for example). I beg your indulgence.

1. MAN un MENTSH.

Problems of political correctness aside, I can testify to the
following approximately 450 native Yiddish speaking emigrant
informants were asked to translate the following English&Hebrew
sentence (or its Hungarian&Rumanian equivalent) into Yiddish.  The
man with the wine& ha ish im hayayin.  The  interviews  took  place
in Israel, the US and Canada, and Mexico.

Invariably, the word MAN was offered only in the US and Canada
elsewhere, the sentence was rendered der mentsh mitn vayn. The word
man in Yiddish designated husband.

Interestingly, this was an unanticipated finding. The sentence was
designed to elicit the vocalic distinctions, Northeastern Yiddish
"mayn man" Central Yiddish "ma'n man" Southeastern Yiddish "man
mon". It didn`t work, except in English speaking countries where
Yiddish&English MAN have converged.

2. Leigh Lisker refers to the semantic connection between the Yiddish
words that resemble the German Schmuck and Putz.

At the risk of repeating myself or others, I thought it worth
mentioning that, despite frequent suggestions to the contrary,
neither Yiddish word is easily derivable from the German word it
resembles.

To begin with, the phonetic resemblance, in both cases, is only
partial. German Schmuck, to rhyme with English book, but Yiddish
shmok, to rhyme with Yiddish shtok,  bok,  zok  (as  against
English  schmuck,  to rhyme with luck, although it is derived from
the Yiddish word). There is NO phonetically reasonable way to derive
Yiddish shtOk from German SchmUck. Furthermore, origin in SchmUck
would require a non existent Yiddish variant SHMIK.

Although Max Weinreich seems to suggest that shmok is derived from
shtok by means of the well known shm prefix (e.g. fancy  shmancy,
cancer  shmancer,  etc.),  Edward  Stankiewicz`s  suggestion  that
it  is derived from (a variant of) Polish "smok" serpent, tail, is
more convincing.

German Putz and Yiddish puts (finery, etc.) rhymes with Schmutz,
shmuts. English putz rhymes with English guts and derives from
Yiddish  pots which rhymes with hot, shtot, etc. again, not
derivable from the German form. The Yiddish word probably derives
from Turkish (glossed cleft in the buttocks [Dan Slobin, please
confirm]) or Greek.

3. I can`t resist a comment on Amitai  Halevi`s  example  concerning
Esau, the grandaddy of them all: ...vayokhal, vayesht, vayaqam,
vayelekh, vayivez Esav et habekhorah.

In his book Khumesh taytsh, the  late  Shlomo  Noble  used  the
same example to illustrate the manner in which taytshn, the
traditional process of word for word bible translation also involved
a process of interpolated commentary. I cite the following (possibly
inaccurately) off the top of my head> In order to distinguish Esau
from (the pious) Jacob, the taytsh went something like this:

 ...vayokhal, un Eysov hot gegesn un nit gemakht keyn brokhe;
vayejsht, un er hot getrunken un nit gemakht keyn shehakl; vayokom,
un er iz ufgeshtanen un hot nit gebentsht; vayeyleykh, un er iz avek
un hot nit gekusht di mezuze.
