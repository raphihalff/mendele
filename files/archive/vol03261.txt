Subject: H'vr Ozhegov entfert...

	Recently Bob Poe inquired as to the meaning of Kabak in
Russian. I turned to the czar of Russian dictionaries, the Ozhegov,
and got this answer:

	kaBAK,-A, v starinu: pitejnoe zavedenie.  "Chto za k. zdes'
                ustro- ili?" (peren.: o besporjadke, nerazberikhe,
                shume, razg. neodobr.).  Gol' kabatskaja (star.).
                Kabatskie nravy (takzhe peren.: grubye; razg.).

	The translation, roughly hewn, is an archaic term meaning
"drinking establishment."  (The Russian word, by the way, is always
end-stressed.) The phrase "What kind of tavern have they built
here?" is translated as having to do with messes, muddles, noise,
and impolite conversation.  The word also gives us the archaic
"tavern beggars" and "tavern manners," the latter of which can be
translated as course, esp. of conversation.

Subject: Kabak

Bob Poe asks about the meaning of his mother's usage of "Kabak".
Shame on her, for it is a tavern, usually of a low type; it is also
a "pigstie", But perhaps she was just warning Bob to stay away from
such places, as a good Jewish mother should do. The word is indeed
Russian.

"tumtum" (or "timtim", allowing for dialect) is a real word. Harkavy
says something like "sexless person or animal". Presumably this is
meant to refer to some one whose physical development is incomplete,
but it's not surprising to see it carried over to effiminate
mannerisms, etc.

Several stories by Bashevis Singer involve a character called Meyer
Tumtum, a man who is beardless and has a high-pitched voice, if I
remember correctly. This is incidental to the stories; Meyer Tumtum
is also notable for being insane half the time. The stories are
quite interesting. They're in the volume title "Der shpigl un andere
dertseylungen", but I don't know if they've been translated. Anyway,
that's where _I_ learned the word ...

Subject: "Jewish" & "Yiddish"/makhn shimelekhlekh

1.  A.A. Roback once suggested that in Yiddish writing, use should
be made of the then-current two spellings "idish" beginning with
shtumer alef-yud, and "yidish" beginning with yud-khirek yud.  The
proposal was something like this:  "idish" would mean "Jewish"
generally--everything Judaic from Avrom-ovinu on; "yidish" would
refer to things Ashkenazic, including in particular east European
culture and language.  "Yidish" would thus be a subcategory under
"idish"--just as in English "Yiddish" is a subcategory under
"Jewish".  A useful suggestion, I thought, which apparently no one
but Roback took seriously.

2.  I can put Meyshe-Yankl's game at least 20 years further back in
Brooklyn, where we used to "make a shimele[y]khl" in the 1930's.  I
didn't think it involved tracing a face--just a circle.  In any
event, I didn't know then and don't know now where the word came
from.
