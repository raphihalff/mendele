Subject: Mountain Jews

It is my understanding that the socalled Mountain Jews. speak Tat, a
Persian languagesome 1500 years old.  Their true connection to Judaism is
not clear anymore.

Subject: Finger Games

Can anyone add to my memories of a phrase something like "chip-chip,
belalach", said while two people alternatingly pinch the skin of the
other person's hand, palm down, followed by some other phrase and a
scrambling of hands, or some such?

Subject: Loshn-koydesh words vs Germanic

I often find myself wondering why a loshn-koydesh word would have entered
Yiddish when Germanic equivalents exist. I've not read anything on the
subject, but I have a few hunches. Words relating to religious practice,
of course, abound (interesting exception is Yortsayt, which I read
somewhere wended its way into the speech of Bukharan Jews). The category
that I couldn't get were these everyday words like meyle, efsher,
mistome, etc. It occurred to me finally that these words serve to qualify
or distinguish.

I've had occasion to listen to "religious discourse Yiddish" on WEVD, and
it occurs to me that there may lie the origin of these words. Words like
probably, necessarily, perhaps, even, etc., which are used in Talmudic
discourse could have received a "Jewish" colorization in the popular mind
and be perceived, therefore, as different from their Germanic
equivalents, or have a Jewish nuance to them. These words were, then,
introduced by men? Someone on Mendele said a few weeks ago, "I don't
write about what I don't know," so I think I'll sign off this subject and
let the khakhomim un gelernte layt bay undz in Mendele tell us the real
scoop on this, if there is one.

Subject: Introduction & gzhibe

Ikh heys Perl Teitlboym/ Paula Teitelbaum un ikh bin geboyrn gevorn in
poyln nokh der tsveyter velt milkhome. Keyn amerike bin ikh gekumen in
1967.  Mayn yidish iz fun der heym un fun shul. Ikh ken oykh poylish,
rusish, shpanish un a bisl hebreish.

Howie Aronson shraybt "A student of mine recently heard the Yiddish word
'zhibe' which is said to mean something approximating hair coming down
over the forehead.....The question arises, where does it come from?...."

>From Polish. The word "grzywa" ( rz = z as in azure )  means a horse's
mane, and "grzywka" means bangs. Thus the Yiddish "gzhibe" - to mean
both.  The second one is frequently used in our family. My six-year-old
daughter is always told, "Kem tsu di gzhibe!" Look at the Polish
spelling, and you can see why it was impossible to find in a Polish
dictionary.
