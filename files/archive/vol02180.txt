Subject:  Two corrections

In my message to MENDELE 2.179, I meant to say that
YIVO and TsISh"O introduced *dem eynheytlekhn yidishn
oysleyg* "shoyn mit hekher 55 yor tsurik" -- and *not*
"mit hekher 35 yor tsurik."  That was a typo -- TsISh"O
(*Di Tsentrale Yidishe Shul Organizatsye*) was active
in interwar Poland.

Secondly, I have refreshed my memory and I believe that
what Chairman Mao (z"l) actually said was:  "Let a
hundred flowers bloom, a *thousand* [not *hundred*]
schools of thought contend."

Subject: I)redensarten ii)Turkish words in Yiddish

To Eli Katz: concerning the expression "gut morgn
gele"; bay undz, it wa always followed by the response
"retekh trog ikh". In other words, Gele either deaf,
dense, or both and responded to the greeting with a
total irrelevancy. You can infer the kinds of
situations that might have elici its use.

To Khayim Bochner. Turkish origin words in Yiddish,
derived either direc at some appropriate period in
history or, perhaps via Ukrainian, should no surprise.
As prestigious a word as "yarmulke" and "lehavdil"
(and, pe rhaps, as notorious a word as "pots", are
likely of Turkish origin.

Subject: Re: slippers - papuchen.

A friend of mine from Moldova tells me that the
Romanian word for slippers is "papuci." Perhaps
Romanian got it from Turkish, but Romanian is probably
the source of "papuchn" in Khaim's dialect of Yiddish.

Subject:  The Israeli Knesset honors Yiddish

As some of MENDELE's Israeli subscribers have
mentioned, on January 4, 1993 there was a special
session of the Knesset, during which speeches were
delivered by various MK's (Shevah Weiss, Avraham Burg,
Dov Shilansky, Shulamit Aloni, Ovadiah Ali) and Israeli
Yiddish personalities (M. Tsanin, Prof. Yitshak
Varshavski), extolling Yiddish language and culture.
The proceedings of that special session have now been
published by the World Council for Yiddish and Jewish
Culture (Veltrat far yidish un yidisher kultur), in a
49-page brochure that includes the speeches in the
original Hebrew and in Yiddish translation.  (Also in
Yiddish:  a short poem by Abraham Sutzkever, entitled
"Yidish.")  The title is very complicated (I'm speaking
as a librarian, now), so I'll just give the phrase that
appears most prominently on the cover:  "Mahaveh
le-yidish" (there is also an English title, "A Homage
to Yiddish," but no Yiddish title per se).  The address
of the Veltrat is: Rehov Dov Hoz 30, Tel Aviv 63416,
Israel.
