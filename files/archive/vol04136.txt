Subject: Gleaning to Ravel and more

Harold Orbach mentions Madelaine Grey, the magnificent voice inter-
preting Ravel`s "Chansons hebraiques". I was lucky to know her per-
sonally through my father, who had a close contact to her, being an
international music-critic (in Israel). Born 1897 she was of course too
young to sing the premiere of the songs. Ravel dedicated the songs to
another singer Alvina Alvi. Yet it was Madelaine Grey whose most
convincing and authentic interpretation of the songs with Ravel playing
the piano-part, made them so popular. She was jewish and vi- sited Israel
to give master-classes for young singers in the sixties. She died 1979.

Other wonderful recordings of the songs are, that of Pierre Bernac (with
Francis Poulenc playing the piano) and Gerard Souzay. Of the newer
interpretations I like Frederica von Stade. The astonishing empathy with
which Ravel succeeded to set the songs (he was not jewish at all) must
have put the original songs in the shadow. How else can you explain that
they are seldom being sung. In my collection I have just the cantor of
Zuerich - Bernhard San singing "Meyerke" with a much too pompous
orchestra setting under Noam Sherif and Belina from Paris, singing "Fregt
di velt an alte kashe" in a manner as if she misunderstood it to be just
a fragment, though it is as complete and perfect as the "unfinished"
symphony by Schubert.

By the way there is an error in the translation Harold Orbach cited from
the cover. It must be: "You can also answer". Another awkwardness is the
singularity of Ravel`s setting of yiddish songs. The only parallel I know
is Shostakowich having written the Songs "of Jewish Folk-Poetry" op. 79 -
11 songs! But in cotrast to Ravel he neither kept the melody of the
original nor the language. He just composed melodies to translations of
yiddish songs, he found somewhere. I cannot even identify most of the
original songs except: Nr. 4 "Oy Avrom, ikh ken on dir nit sayn" and Nr.
7: "Oyfn boydem shloft der dakh". Has someone found more? Of course there
are numerous settings to biblical and lyturgical texts one of my
favourites being the "Kiddush" by Kurt Weill, written in reverence to
his father, the formerly synagogue-cantor. Perhaps this is the place to
call composers for doing more in this field in Ravel`s tradition (or like
Bartok did for many folklores).

Subject: Congressman Sawyer's Reply

In Mendele Volume 4.110,4  Zellig Bach published an open letter to
Congressman Thomas C. Sawyer, Chairman of the Subcommittee that oversees the
Census Bureau, with reference to the Yiddish translation of the Bureau's
questionnaire for the year 2000.  This is [part of] his reply:

        Thank you for your thoughtful letter and article about the Census
        Bureau's inadequate Yiddish translation of its questionnaire for
        the 1990 census.

        Your concern is an important one.  If the Census Bureau's
        materials are not understandable, and possibly offensive, then
        they will not have the desired effect of encouraging
        participation in the census.

        I see from your article that you've already written to the Census
        Bureau.   I will remind the Bureau of the offer it made to
        request your involvement and that of other professionals in its
        translation work.

        The Census Bureau seems to be placing a higher emphasis on
        cooperating with national and local community organizations in
        preparing for the census. That approach also should help the
        Bureau to develop culturally- and linguistically-sensitive
        materials.
