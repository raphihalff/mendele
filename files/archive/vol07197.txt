Subject: gogl-mogl for the birthday party


                        It came softly, at first, then louder, then very loud. 
                        But it was not the hiss of fire. It was more like the
                        hiss of water. And now it became a gurgling sound:
                        "Guggle! Guggle!"
                                            Gaston Leroux, Fantome de l'Opera

I did not realize that an innocent question about gogl-mogl posted by Bernard
Kouchel (and independently forwarded to Mendele by Dan Leeson from another
forum) can open a real Pandora's box.  Mendele has not seen such intensity of
responces to a single query since the Great Davenen Debate. The diversity of
pronunciations, etymologies, recipes, applications, and attitudes toward the
drink stretches imagination. 

I have no doubts that shortly after this issue of Mendele will be delivered to
more than 1,500 mailboxes, the refrigerator doors in many kitchens around the
globe will open, milk, honey and eggs will travel to the tables and end up in
the glasses of various shapes and sizes. On this sweet and cholesterol-rich
note Mendele closes its seventh annual cycle. Let's raise our gogl-mogl
glasses. Many happy returns of the day!  Lekhaim!

Subject: guggle-muggle

Without guarantee that the formula was universal:
Guggle-muggle = hot milk(with the skim on it), honey, and a raw egg (which
is left unbeaten to surprise the innocent victim as it slips down the
throat).  I doubt there is a sensible etymology.  I think the name comes
from the sound made by the poor gagging child who is tricked into drinking
the concoction.  Supposedly, there were those who drank it willingly, or
even with pleasure.  One exposure suffices to ruin all future egg nogs.

Re: Vol 07.194 item 7, Bernard Kouchel asks for the ingredients of a
Guggle-muggle.  I remember once having that concoction forced down my throat. 
As I recall it consisted of a raw egg mixed into milk.  Probably a Jewish
version of Egg-nog without the rum. 

My father came from Roumania and perhaps this is a cure of that country.

Subject: "guggle-muggle"

Bernard Kouchel (07.194) asks about "guggle-muggle."  I leave it to the
experts to fathom the etymology, but this _cure-all_ for ailments of the head,
throat and chest as made in my family by my mother and tantas, all from the
Lodz area of Poland, started with tea and hot milk in almost equal amounts to
which was added a raw egg, honey, some spices (cinammon I recall) and a bisle
bronfen like slivovitz.  Served in a glass, like tea, it was usually dreadful
(unless enough slivovitz was added) and was more like a purge than a cure.  I
hated it!  The threat of a _guggle-muggle_ was almost enough to cure my
ailments.

Subject: Guggle-muggle 

My family (from Belorussian Jewry, exactly Nevel of Vitebsk region) knows this
name as "Gogol-mogol".  The main word is "gogol" (like the last name of
well-known Russian-Ukrainian writer, by the way) and second one is just a
senseless paired rhyme to this word -- like in numerous children's verses and
singing games.  One has to check this paired word -- just in case -- in the
famous Russian dictionary compiled by Vladimir Dal (unfortunately, this
valuable book is not on my desk for the moment).  The word might be even
onomatopoeic.  I never heard "guggle-muggle" but this sounds to me
onomatopoeic as well.  However, let us double check. 

Apropos, I myself used to prepare this delicious both remedy and delicacy in
my childhood taking two yolks and energetically stirring them up with two
table spoons of sugar -- as long as the mass becomes almost white and dense. 
Enjoy without getting ill!

Subject: guggle-muggle

To cure the throat of Bernard I. Kouchel (07.194) I would suggest to mix hot
milk, sugar, or better honey, egg yolk, liqueur and or rum.  Harkavy lists it
under "GOGL-MOGL" and translates it as an egg-flip and believes it stems from
the German "Hoppel-Poppel" which means either:  breakfast made from scrambled
egg with ham and fried potatoes - that is of course the nonkosher version and
a real "Goyim-Nakhes" - or: eggnog.  Both Ben-Amotz/Ben-Yehuda (The World
Dictionary of Hebrew Slang - Part Two) and even Even-Shoshan (4th Volume -
supplement) list the word with different ingredients. The last supports the
Harkavy etymology. Abi gezunt!

Khaver Kouchel asks for the formula for guggle-muggle. I had one rather
unhappy experience with this nostrum that nearly cost me my then very recent
marriage. Be that as it may, my wife of over forty years provides the
following account of my father-in-law's procedure: 

one egg yolk
"rubbed" with sugar (lots)
(She interprets this as a manditory lengthy process to try dissolving
the sugar in the yolk.)
add hot milk to fill one glass.
(No, I have no idea why the sugar is rubbed before the milk is added)
Drink!

From: Serge Mitelman <simitelman@pol.net>
Subject: Gogl-mogl.

I believe "gogl-mogl" comes from the Russian "gogol'-mogol'".  And here's what
the dictionaries say:

Mordkhe Tsanin's "Fuler yidish-hebreisher verterbukh":  (der) goglmogl (-en),
translated into Hebrew as "gogl-mogl".  Uriel Weinreich's "Modern
yidish-eynglish verterbukh": (der) gogl-mogl (-en), translated into English
as "egg flip".  Nachum Stutchkoff's "Der oytser fun der yidisher
shprakh"(p.227): gogl-mogl.  "Rusish-yidisher verterbukh" (tsunoyfgeshtelt fun
Moyshe Shapiro, Ruvn Lerner, Khayim Loytsker un Moyshe Maydansky; R ussky
yazyk, Moscow, 1984): gogl-mogl (-s), menlekh, translated into Russian as
"gogol'-mogol'".  The variants, therefore, are goglmogl, gogl-mogl; and
the plural forms - goglmoglen, gogl-moglen, and gogl-mogls.

Now, "Russian-English Dictionary" (under the general direction of prof. 
A.I.Smirnitsky, Russky Yazyk Publishers, Moscow, 1990) translates Russian 
"gogol'-mogol'" into English as nothing other than "gogol-mogol", and
 explains: beaten-up eggs and sugar. S.I.Ozhegov's "Slovar' russkogo yazyka"
(Dictionary of The Russian Language, Russky Yazyk, Moscow, 1986) reads: "
gogol'-mogol' - syroy zheltok, styortyy s sakharom" (raw egg-yolk, ground out
with sugar). 

Although linguistically gogl-mogl comes from Russian, it is made differently
in the Russian and Jewish homes.  Thus, Russian gogol'-mogol' is a delicacy,
made from a beaten-up egg-yolk, ground out with sugar, and usually cacao
powder and butter, with no remedial properties. On the contrary, the numerous
naturalistic studies, performed by our bobes with the Jewish gogol'-mogol',
have found it effective in both sore throat and common cold alike (second only
to "a golden yakhele"). With gogl-mogl it takes only a week to recover,
without it - 7 days. Double-blind studies of the matter are clearly warranted. 

And here comes the recipe, exactly as I hear it now in my head:

Me nemt a geylekhl tsi tsvey, yn a tey-lefele piter mit a tey-lefele melets
(oder an eslefl onyk) yn a olb tey-lefele sode.  Me tserabt dus ingontsn

Subject: Gogl-mogl, a sgule tsu romans

I'm sure by now the electronic waves (or however this gets transmitted) are
full of recipes for gogl-mogl as well as countless etymologies and
pronunciations. I'd just like to add one anecdote.  Years ago, when my husband
and I were just a bokher un a meydl going out, I mentioned to him that I had a
sore throat.  He told me to try a gogl-mogl and told me how to make it -- a
glass of warm milk, a raw egg, and some honey, I think.  I was so impressed
that he knew what a gogl-mogl was (since he was then not really a Yiddish
speaker, I had not expected such pearls of folk wisdom) that my romantic ardor
increased. I was thrilled to find that this professor from the South
(naturally, transplanted from the North) was, as Annie Hall, (or was it her
Bobbe Grammy Hall), would have said, "a real Jew." And so, reader, I married
him.

Subject: gogl-mogl: a compilation of replies  

My thanks to all who replied to my gogl-mogl query. No one seemed to know the
origin of the term. One reader wrote that ex-Mayor Ed Koch talks about it on
his radio show. Perhaps a New Yorker will phone him for his input. Attached
below is a compilation of eight replies. I guess a gogl-mogl and a mustard
plaster were the common home-remedies for a variety of ailments long ago. If
those remedies didn't work, doctors could make house-calls, remember? 

Bernard I. Kouchel

Q:
"Guggle muggle" [gogl-mogl], was some sort of home remedy for sore throats,
made by my bubby, long ago. Does anyone know the origin of the term, and
perhaps the concoction's ingredients? [B. Kouchel]

A1:  
I was practically raised on the darn things due to childhood illnesses.
it is simply about 10 or 12 oz of hot milk, into which are added one egg yolk
(just the yolk, and these days this could be hazardous to your health with all
the bacterial problems!) a tablespoon of honey, and a slice of butter.  Stir
very well and drink/sip.  BTW, these days, it is said that honey is not
recommended for really young children, so even that is not a good idea if the
idea is to help a child, consult a doctor first. 

The amounts of honey, butter, etc. are variable to taste.  Neither I nor my
parents (who are both 'old world' and made these for me all the time!) have
any idea of the origin of the name, so I can't help you on that part.  [BG]

A2:
My cousin who is from Lithuania used to make this concoction for his kids. 
The three of them managed to survive without salmonellosis or honey-osis. 
Neither of the two of you indicate where in Europe your family-members came
from, who are responsible for inflicting guggle-muggle on you.  Could they
also have been from Lithuania?  Or did the term have wider use?  {RG]

A3:
Gogl-mogl - Egg-flip. a strong drink mixed with eggs and naft. 
("naft" = Petroleum). (Yiddish-english-hebrew dictionary, by Alexander
Harkavy  [y7]

[I wonder what 'petroleum' was used, perhaps mineral oil???[BK]]

A4:
I remember as a child being forced to drink this horrid concoction. At best it
contained a raw egg ypolk, sugar and milk. To add high octane to it they
sometimes added chicken fat. Remember kashrith can be suspended in case of
illness [YbL]

A5:
I too remember my mother making goggle-moggle for sore throats.  I have
searched in vain for a recipe (particularly in her own collection).  To the
best of my recollection, it was made with cocoa (or bitter chocolate), honey,
& butter.  I have no idea what else went into it or in what proportions.  It
was refrigerated, but seemed to have the consistency of apple butter. [AS]

A6:
I spoke with my mother ... and was told that her mother and my father would
take milk-eggs-honey and mix together for a sore throat. By the way the
ex-Mayor of New York Ed Koch talks about it on his daily radio show. [ZM]

A7:
If I am not mistaken this was a concoction of cod liver oil and chocolate
syrup.  My father would take me to the druggistnik to make a guggle muggle
when I was constipated or just had the blahs. That's a long time ago.  [BK2]

Subject: The Survey

[Moderator's note: the following text is the beginning of a wonderful story by
Leo Haber. The story was published in Serpentine (vol 2, no 1, Jan 1998,
http://www.serpentinia.com/latest_issue/ss_3.htm) - don't miss it!    -i.v.]

The Survey

I came down with a heavy bronchial cough one year to the day after my Bar
Mitzvah and on the very day that my mother went to the hospital to give birth
to her third child, a baby girl, my little sister. My father tended to me in
her absence. When on the third day of my illness the cough hadn't disappeared
in spite of my taking medicine prescribed by a doctor, my father took matters
into his own hands. He put together a concoction that his own parents had
given him when he was a child: the yellow of eggs, one squeezed lemon, one
spoon of honey, and two or three teaspoons of sugar, all mixed together and
taken down as if I were drinking a milkshake or an egg cream in the candy
store downstairs. Unlike all other medicines, this tasted fine. In fact, I
made note of the ingredients so that I could put all that stuff together for
myself secretly, even when I didn't have a cold. 

"What is it called?" I asked my father.

"In our shtetl in Galicia and in Russia, an uggle-muggle," he said. "In
Rumania, a guggle-muggle. In France, a chateau, but what do they know." 

"What is it supposed to do?" I asked hoarsely.

"With God's help," my father said, "it's supposed to break up the phlegm and
clean your throat out."
