Subject: Nikolsburg

[Leonard prager writes  (Mendele Vol 2.43):]

        An interesting tale about a Jewish merchant from
        Nicklesburgh {Yiddish: Niklsburg -- apparently not
        a real place, but suggestive of Nikolayev,
        Ukraine}, Tsodek Pikante, who lost his property in
        a fire and became a pauper.  He left his wife at
        home and went out into the world to gather
        donations.  What helped him was a writ from the
        famous rabbi, Reb Shmelke.  Believing his story,
        the rabbi took pity on the merchant and provided
        him with a written recommendation.  He managed to
        collect a sum of money and sold Reb Shmelke's writ
        to another beggar.  The latter went abroad, where
        he died suddenly.  Reb Shmelke's writ was all that
        was found on the dead man, and notice was sent to
        the widow that her husband was dead.

I cannot recall hearing this story before, but  the place
and the Rebbe are both real. Nicholsburg was the capital of
Moravia (Mehren) now part of Czechoslovakia. Der Rebbe reb
Ber fin Rovne (Vos is barimt of der velt als Mezricher
Magid) hot gehat tsvishen zayn talmidim tsvai brider - Reb
Shmelke Horovitz in Reb Pinchos Horovitz. Reb Shmelke is
gevoren Ruv in Nikolsburg in Khasidim rifen ihm dem Reben
reb Shmelke. Reb Pinches is gevoren Ruv in a daitshe shtut
- Frankfurt.

Subject: By way of introduction

If anyone out there is interested in attending a free demo
and seminar at the Apple Marketing Headquarters on
International Languages - Hebrew - Yiddish - Arabic and
others call 1-800-944-9628 ext 800 any time before Friday
July 31, when it will be held at 10 AM - 12N. 57th St and

have the ability to scan in Hebrew ( without nikud ) and
bring the text as text into Nota Bene, Einstein and on the
Mac into NISUS.  Enough for a beginning.  Zay Gezundt.

Subject: query: "Magaritkes"

About two weeks ago Martin Davis mentioned a yiddish song
called *Magaritkes*. I would like to have the full text
and, if possible some background information about it.
Here's the reason why: I have a recording of songs in
Esperanto which contains a song with a similar plot. The
last stanza goes like this (for a translation, see Martin
Davis's text of this stanza):
 
La knabo foriris, subiris la suno
kaj Anna nun sidas che arb'.
Shi zumas senpense dum venas mallumo
la kanton la tralalala.
 
I am quite sure that it is a translation of the song. (I
can send the full text to those interested.)
 
Zajt gezunt!

Subject: query: travel guide

I've just come back from the travel agency where I have
purchased a flight to Quebec in order to take part in the
XV. International Congress of Linguists (Aug. 9-15). After
the Congress I will have two spare weeks before I'll fly
back to Europe from New York on August 30th. I plan to
visit Boston (including Cambridge and Amherst),
Philadelphia, and New York (if this city doesn't frighten
me to much...). Although I have never been to that part of
the world, I think it will be the right place to find
Yiddish books and all kinds of Yiddish cultural
manifestations. Perhaps, somebody can tell me where to find
libraries, theaters, book stores and the like. Thanks in
advance!
