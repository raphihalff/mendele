	      THE YIDDISH VOICE -- NEW BOSTON RADIO SHOW

	 First Program is in Memory of the Lubavitcher Rebbe


The Yiddish Voice, a brand new Yiddish-language weekly radio show, is
set to begin broadcasting here on WUNR 1600 AM/Boston every wednesday
evening from 7:30 pm to 8:30 pm.

The show features music, poetry, comedy, interviews, news, commentary,
and announcements of current events, all of it in the Yiddish language.

The Yiddish Voice (to be known, in Yiddish, as 'Dos Yidishe Kol') is
actually a "spin-off" from another all-Yiddish Boston radio show, The
Yiddish Hour, which has been broadcast out of WBRS 100 FM/Waltham, a
non-commercial station, for the past three and a half years.

The new show will overcome the number one "complaint" about the old
show: lack of reception. The new show will operate on a 5,000 Watt
commercial AM station, and will reach all of the Metro Boston area,
whereas the old one was only heard in Waltham and surrounding towns,
on FM.

The Yiddish Voice will operate on a not-for-profit basis, but will
seek advertising, grants, and donations to cover such costs as station
airtime, equipment, records and tapes, and promotional materials.

The all-volunteer staff making the transition from the Yiddish Hour to
the Yiddish Voice include Mark David, the show's producer and regular
host and Hasia Segal, a native of Lithuania, who will continue to
offer frequent special presentations and exclusive interviews of
important personalities.  Numerous other contributors will continue to
be featured regularly.  Some programming will be shared between the
Yiddish Hour and the Yiddish Voice.

The first broadcast will be Wednesday, July 13, at 7:30 p.m.  This
program is specially dedicated to the memory of the Lubavitcher Rebbe,
on the occasion of of the Shloyshim (30 days), marking 30 days since
his passing away.  The guest speaker is Rabbi Haim Cement, of the
Lubavitz Yeshiva in Brookline, Mass.
