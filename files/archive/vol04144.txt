Subject: Introduction

My name is Allan Tanzman.  I grew up in Long Island and after some
wandering around I settled in the Boston Area.

My grandparents spoke Yiddish but unfortunately my parents did not.  As a
child I enjoyed hearing Yiddish being spoken but all I ever learned was a
couple of phrases.  I was also taught in hebrew school that it was
important to learn Hebrew, not Yiddish!!  What a shame.

I signed up to learn more about Yiddish.  A special thanks to Harvey
Spiro for telling me about Mendele.

Subject: Dutsn/irtsn god

In the Netherlands, both Catholics and Protestants address god in the
archaic polite form _gij_.  This is especially striking in the Catholic
church, where the facing Latin text in the prayer book addresses god as
_tu_.  (Current Dutch 2nd person pronouns are the familiar _je/jij_ and
the polite _U_.)

Subject: god in Germany

It is my understanding that Christian Germans in northern Germany, which
is predominantly Protestant, use the informal "du" to address God.  I
assume this also goes for southern Germany and Austria, which are
predominantly Catholic, but I am not absolutely positive.

Subject: Tutoyer ou vouvoyer Dieu

Though hardly a Christian Mendelnik, I can enlighten Ellen Prince. French
Catholics, as opposed to French Protestants, did use "vous" when
addressing God until Vatican II, when the practice was changed.

French Jews, incidentally, use the familiar form.

Subject: Workmen's Circle BBS

Dear Mendelniks,

1. In defense of WC BBS

A branch of the Workmen's Circle started Bulletin Board about five years
ago. It has a fair number of users. It recently hooked itself up to the
Internet. It offers e-mail to Workmen's Circle members for the bargain
price of $25.00 a year. If you are familiar with BBS's and offline
readers (I'm not), it can be very easy to use. If you are new to BBS's
and the Internet, their is a small learning curve to be mastered. Much of
what our shames mentions is not the fault of the BBS. How does the line
go, "The fault lies not in our stars but in ourselves".

My own problem was mastering a new offline reader. Our shames received an
extremely garbled message from me. He sent it back and I corrected it.
This was not the fault of the Workmen's Circle BBS. Garbage in, garbage
out. I suspect Moish had similiar difficulties. I would like to thank the
hundreds of loyal Mendelniks that sent me suggestions on alternative
services. Your concern has been appreciated.
