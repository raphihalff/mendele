Apologies to Dave Sherman. My entry /a kloks af kelombes/
seems to have been a mistake. I remembered hearing a
childhood friend of mine in my native village in New Jersey
say it often. He said he had learned it from his
grandmother who never said it in front of me. Last night I
looked up /kloks/ in both Harkavy and Weinreich and
couldn't find it, nor does there seem to be a cognate in
German. I think there was an error in transmission
somewhere along the line. It should probably be /a klole af
(oyf) kelombes/ 'a curse upon Columbus.' It meant,"Accursed
be Columbus for discovering America where I have had so
much trouble." Maybe it was unique to the grandmother of my
friend Morgan Davis! I assumed it was a widespread
expression. Aren (Arthur)

Subject: A kloks

Since the opportunity to correct my learned friend Aren
Abramson comes once in a decade, I can't resist this one:
'kloks' is almost certainly a mishearing of 'a klog tsu'
and the full quote means 'damn that Columbus!'.

But since we're discussing the possible relation between
gender and language, it seems to me that _this_ kind of
cussing is quite general among men and women.  Women are
more likely than men to bless and curse.  (I speak of
course of the Yiddish world.)  A story of Mendele's (Khag
Haasif: A Yontif fun Zamlen) bears this out in a negative
way by presenting us with a loser sh'b'losers, Reb Yankev
Pinkhes, who in his rage _does_ curse in every other
sentence.  I wonder if readers can suggest any other
examples from Yiddish literature of such men.

Derogatory characterizations are another story.  For a man
to call another a beheyme or a shoyte Yisroel is common
enough.  My zeyde came to America in 1926.  In Shpikov boys
didn't play ball in the street; in our American shtetl they
did.  So when one of those (thank God) soft rubber balls
would hit a window, my zeyde would run out waving his cane
and yelling: Banditen! Khaliganes! (and if really mad)
Bol-she-vi-kes!!
