Subject: Yiddish and the church (was: Going to a monastery)

The  recent light-hearted postings about Yiddish clubs in monasteries
can take on a serious and surprising form in our own Golda Werman's
fascinating and scholarly book, "Milton and Midrash" (1995 Catholic
University of America Press ISBN 0-8132-0821-1).

A few enticing tid-bits from Chapter 5, _Yiddish and the Church_ : She
describes a German Lutheran minister, Johan Saubert (1638-1688) who,
unlike previous Christian scholars  who translated classical Hebrew or
Aramaic midrashim into Latin, chose to translate a popular folk
midrash, the Ze'enah U-Re'enah that was written in Yiddish. He also
preached that Chrtistians should read God's original words in Hebrew
when they studied the Bible.

Golda continues on to teach us that Saubert was not unique in his
knowledge of Yiddish. The 16th and 17th century rabbis who taught
Bible and Talmud to Christian theologians often resorted to Yiddish
(the forerunner of the monastic Yiddish Club?) which the students
learned easily because they thought it a German dialect.

Her book is mind-expanding for a lay person like me. Accolades to her
knowledgeability and talent in sharing it.

Subject: "Es vi a porets"

Zellig Bach points out that the Hebrew brokhe, in Eastern Europe, was
pronounced the Ashkenazic way, not the modern Sephardic way.  And
therefore, he says, the last word would have been pronounced "ha'Orets"
with a komets-alef.  Now to corrrect the correction.  It would have been
pronounced "Ho'Oretz" in Ashkenazic.  Before an aleph, the Hey has a
kometz, rather than a pasakh under it.  In Sephardic Hebrew, the
pronunciation is the same.  But in Ashkenazic, it makes it "Ho" rather
than "Ha".

Subject: "Es vi a porets"

Zellig Bach's reply (vol.7.008) to my posting concerning my family's
end rhyme to the motsi (7.004) makes the very important observation
about the "minor but significant" pronunciation error.  I wrote
ha'arets to rhyme with porets when, of course, it would have to have
been ha'orets to be the true rhyme  that it was.  Since this was my
first posting to mendele (which I joined to learn more about Yiddish)
and, since my forte is Hebrew, I was so nervous about my Yiddish
transcription (I probably wrote ha'aretz instead of ha'arets), that I
never even gave a thought to the basic difference of the ashkinazic
pronunciation of my childhood and the sephardic pronunciation I use
today.  He's also right about my having a happy family but, since my
parents were very serious about things like brakhes, I find it hard to
believe that they invented that rhyme.  Of course we children knew it
wasn't part of the actual brakha but we never thought to ask where it
started..  If I don't hear from anyone else who ever heard that rhyme,
I guess I'll be just as delighted because I'll have found a whole new
side to my parents about which I never guessed.

Subject: Menachem Mendel

I am still unable to agree with Louis Fridhandler on the question of
Menachem Mendel because I believe that the "world of Yiddish Literature"
cannot be distinguished from the world of Yiddish-speaking Jews in
general. In other words, to be in the former you have first to be in the
latter.(And if there were a more clumsy way to express this thought I
would probably have used it.) I wasn't alive in 1903, but at that time,
when over 50% of Yiddish-speaking Jews were Khasidim, and in today's
world of Jews whose peer-group speech is Yiddish, Menachem Mendel is
much more likely to evoke the memory of an uncle,  grandfather or rabbi
than of the character who, Sholom Aleichem himself, as he made
abundantly clear, considered not so much an isolated example of the
shlimazl as "a yid fun a gants yor" and in a larger sense a
personification of every exile-dwelling Jew. As he said, "Un azoy vi
yidishe gesheftn zaynen, boruch haShem umetum alts eyns, dos heyst,
hoybn hoybn zay zikh on, dakht zikh gants nishkoshedik, mit azoy fil
betokhn un glentzende hofenungen, un oyslozn lozn zay zikh oys, tsum
maynstn mit shlim-shlim-mazl, vi bay mayn Menakhem Mendl, l'khen badarf
men lang nit horoven baym tsunoyfstheln a brif. Me kon im nemn glaykh vi
er shtet un geht". But he goes even further and says that even in that
one case in a thousand where (a Jew's) business is going well for the
while, "Kon er zikher zayn az s'iz nit oyf lang. Alts vos iz geboyen oyf
luft un oyf vint muz sof-kol-sof faln..." Bernshtein quotes a proverb
which sums it up admirably: "A Yidish ashires iz vi a martsover shnay".

I. Ch. Rawnitzky, The man Sholom Aleichem described as "My most intimate
friend", in his definition of humor postulates that anything strange and
unnatural is humorous, and says, "Haynt vos ken shoyn zayn mer stire
tsu a normale, natirlekhn lebn vi dos Yidish hoykerik un farkriplt
golosdike lebn, tsezeyt un tseshpreyt oyf ale ekn fun der gantse velt, a
lebn fun shvebn in der luftn on a shtikl yesod unter di fis". To
Rawnitzki, as to Sholom Aleichem, no Jew in golus, living in and
building on air and wind, had a chance to do anything but fail in the
end. When you examine Sholem Aleichem's writings, you will find that
almost without exception the people he writes about are losers. Menachem
Mendl is just one among the rest of them.

Louis Fridhandler's second point was that I misspelled his surname. Not
quite. I not only misspelled it, I got it entirely wrong. While
Friedlander is a common name and listed dozens of times in both the Tel
Aviv and Jerusalem phonebooks, Fridhandler is so rare as to be close to
a hapax legomenon, because there is not a single listing in either of
those two directories. This is offered as an explanation (simple
carelessness is the other) but not as an excuse: there is no excuse
whatever for referring to Mr. Fridhandler as Friedlander and I hope he
will accept my apologies for having done so.
