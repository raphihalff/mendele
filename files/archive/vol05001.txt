Subject: We start our fifth year

From Vol4.001 (5/15/94):

    Mendele begins its fourth year today.  From a nucleus of 22 we
    are now close to 500.  From a hand-stitched mailing list that
    came out of Trinity's old VAX we now, thanks to Victor Bers,
    conduct business via Yale's Listserver.  For the shames it's been
    pure pleasure the whole time, since all the hard work has been
    done by those who do the writing.

I would change nothing from that statement except to note that, as
Mendele begins its fifth year, we are now just short of 750.  And live in
24 _known_ countries.

Subject: Of koyletches and khalas

My bubie used to say, "A koyletch un an ek oif Rosh Hashona." A koyletch
was a round khala to symbolize eternity and wishes for a long life.

Our roots were in Skalat and Husiatin in Austria near the Russian border
and mama used to tell about koyletches made in Russia with saffron and
raisins, and ladders (so one could ascend to the blue yonder) imprinted
on top.

An article in Moment told of the Ukrainian custom of baking khala dough
in the form of a bird symbolizing God's protection in the form of a
hovering bird. I think it was Lithuania where khala dough was baked in
the form of a crown to symbolize God as king (or queen?).

In Leviticus, Moses was instructed to place two rows of six khalas each
before the Lord every Shabos. This eventually came down to the family
table on Shabos where the 12 round loaves turned into 2 braided loaves
with at least 6 humps in each (to represent the 6 loaves in each of the 2
rows placed on the table in the Temple).

The first khalas (which were round) were believed to be made from
semolina flour, a fine wheat flour used in pasta.

Subject: Koyletch

In Hungarian Jewry it was kalach, pronounced kalatch.  My motherinlaw
made them , a light breakfast type coffee cake. My father, when shown
it, laughed: Oy, this is a koyletch!  He was promised a something
different.  He was from Bessarabia.  I wanted my motherinlaw to put
raisins and cinnamon in, which she began to, to oblige me.  Hers was
plain, and not flat but high.  Good for dunking, and for putting jam on.
Coming from South Russian types, I needed more zetz to everything she
made, spices, peppers, raisins, cinnamon, even salt.  You name it. The
same cake I buy now and then in its Italian form, as pannettone.  That
has some dried fruit morsels in it, but it comes plain, too.  Nothing
special, and easy to make...not that my writing wife would ever trouble
to bake a cake.  Why did I marry her, you might wonder?  She had a Smith
Corona portable typewriter ,new, as her dowry.  I jumped at the chance.
Four years later I even wrote my PhUD on it!  Oh, to think of the labors
of Hercules, and pre-technology.  Note cards, cut and paste! Oi vey.
Now, I can entertain hundreds unknown with such trivia.
