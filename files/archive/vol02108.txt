Subject: sneezes and: is grandma from Volhynia?

While I reported earlier that my grandmother said, for the
second sneeze, "lang leben zolstu ibm" she might have said
". . .zolstu lebm" but not the version Mikhl Herzog has
proposed.  I don't believe she was from Volhynia, but her
origins are a mystery.  My uncle says she's from Bardichev,
but that was only because he always threatened to take him
(my uncle) "back to Bardichev" if he didn't behave.  I
don't think it had anything to do with her hometown!  As
potential identifiers, she said "kenna-hora" and something
like " zol gezain gezint mit yorn."  Maybe this is easy for
someone on the list to identify??

That's as it might be.  However, in Yiddish, amkha
signifies hoi polloi, amoretz, i.e. it's become a
specialized term.

Meylekh.

Subject: Khorbm

Elliot Gertel:

khorbm (with o) is the usual pronunciation of U before R in
much of Southern Yiddish--like dorkh (through), korts
(short),etc. It's paralleled by the lowering of I before R
too: kertser (shorter). The same thing happens before X and
gives us forms like kex/kax (kitchen braxn (break), raxt
(right) and, to top it off fartsn (14!!!). As for the verb
'to be': The infinitives may vary: (h)ubm/(h)obm; the
inflected forms (after  mir/zey) have O, (h)obm. From your
mother you mu also have heard 'mir omer' or 'ints omer' in
place of 'mir hobm'. No?

Subject: RE: offensive language

Any one else struck by the editor's note about the
offensive character of shiksa and shageyts?  Are there
politer terms to denote non-Jewish women and men?  It also
occurs that schvartze is also derogatory; my meager
vocabulary includes no synonyms.  Are there any?
 
Is there a sociolinguistic issue involved here where there
are no common terms for outsiders deemed to be unacceptable
to the culture?

Subject: RE: offensive language

I heartly join with Dan Breslauer in requesting the casting
out of the terms "sheygets" and "shiksa" into outer
darkness. Very recently I attended a briefing on matters of
Isreali political action in which the presenter used these
terms in an attempt to get a cheap laugh. He was roundly
criticized and I hope he learned his lesson.
