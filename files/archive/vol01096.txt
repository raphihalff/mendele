Subject: Binde

In my mother's family (origin, Minsk) a tie was referred to
as "schnips".  I had not heard the word "binde" before and
have not yet consulted the dictionaries.

In reply to David Sherman, all the people I know use
"binde" and the word appears in Uriel Weinreich's
dictionary under "binden." It does not appear to be a
North American neologism.

RE: Bostoner Yiddish--

Yes Noyekh, brace yourself....

Challah is pronounced "chollie" by a lot of Boston types.
When I hear people refer to challah in this way, I hear
strands of "Lassie, come home" in the distance.

What means, "Mendele may be moving to Boston?"

Re: Sissel and sissel bread

I am a native (third generation) of Providence, RI, und bay
mir iz geven zizl broyt a fargenign!  In the nearly thirty
years since I left Providence, in all my travels, I have
neither heard of nor tasted sissel bread outside of
Providence.

Bagel were not baked with sissel, but sissel bread is that
incredibly heavy rye bread with a hard thick crust. I
recall it only coming from one bakery: Korbs, formerly on
N. Main Street, corner of Lippet, but for the past forty
years in Pawtucket, RI, near the border (I forget the
street), down the street from Brodsky's Toy Store (Is it
still there?)

As for origin of sissel bread, I was told by my grandmother
(who was born on Charles Street in 1892) that Korbs once
had a baker named Zisl who was reknown for the rye bread he
developed while working at Korb's. Hence, sissel bread and
sissel seeds (which I recall as bigger than ordinary
caraway, but not to be confused with nigrela seeds).
