Subject: "kbtsnim" (kabtsonim) in Kasovich autobiography

I would appreciate help in understanding the following passage from page 
74 in the autobiography of Israel Kasovich, Zekhtsig yohr leben: 
erinerungen eygene un algemayn idishe. Nyu Yor: M. N. Mayzel, 1924.

"Zaslav iz a kleyn shtetele mit etlekhe tsendlik yidishe kabtsonim"

What is the meaning of kabtsonim? [Editor's note: it means 'paupers.'] It 
seems an odd word to describe the Jewish inhabitants of Zaslav, unless he 
is calling attention to their occupation or to some other characteristic.

(Born in 1858 or 1859, Kasovich wrote his autobiography c. 1923.  He was a 
member of an Am Olam group that emigrated to America c. 1882 to be 
farmers, but the venture failed, and he returned to Russia after three 
months.  He was an active Zionist who raised money for Jewish agricultural 
workers, and he was a delegate to the 1902 Minsk Zionist conference. He 
briefly became a farmer in Connecticut in 1907, and was then associate 
editor of The Jewish Farmer.)

The entire Yiddish book can be found on line at

Thanks.

Subject: Leonard Wolf

I wonder if anyone knows whether Leonard Wolf, translator of 
"Vini-der-Pu," can be contacted. (He was in his late seventies when he 
translated Vini, I believe, so alas one must ask the question....)

Subject: Yiddish writers and suicide
Dear friends,

In his book "The Writer as Migrant," Ha Jin asserts that Isaac Bashevis 
Singer "often thought of committing suicide because of the demise of 
Yiddish." I have not been able to find anything to support this assertion, 
and I was wondering if any of you could point me to any sources that might 
mention this about Singer. I would also be interested in any leads to the 
subject of suicidal thoughts due to the demise of Yiddish in any other 
Yiddish writers.

Thank you in advance,
Amy Kaufman

Subject: Finfer-turem, Finfer-shlos
Dear experts on the Golem of Prague,
In Leivick's "Di Geule Komedie," I have come across a Finfer-turem as the 
location of the Golem's and Messiah ben David's final confrontation with 
the Maharal. A couple of pages later, there's a mention of Finfer-shlos. 
To the best of my knowledge, the drama unfolded in the Old New Synagogue 
in Prague, but I have been unable to find any reference to Finfer, be it a 
tower or a caste. Is it an actual name or just a reference to the tower's 
shape, i.e. pentagonal?

I haven't had the zkhus of visiting the Old New Synagogue, but as far as I 
can see in pictures, it has no pentagonal spires or towers.  Or is it a 
tower of a castle (Prague Castle perhaps)?
Many thanks in advance,
Lena Watson

Subject: Pesach Burstein's "Yessir, Zi's mayn kale"

Does anyone know who holds the copyright for "Yessir, Zi's mayn kale" by 
Pesach Burstein?  How can I find out if this is in the public domain?  I 
would like to use it in an animation that I am working on. Thanks so much.

Subject: gefilte fish

Peretz Mett asks about why "gefilte fish" exists only in the plural. This 
reply is speculation only, not authoritative, so take your pick of the 
explanations.
1. "gefilte fish" refers to the balls of chopped fish as served, therefore 
plural.
2. gefilte fish is traditionally made of several kinds of fish: carp, 
whitefish, buffall, perhaps others, depending on which European country 
the cook stems from, all chopped together with the other ingredients and 
often wrapped in pieces of fish skin.
3. I don't believe "fish" in Yiddish, as in English, actually has a 
singular or plural.
What "gefilte fish" doesn't mean is "a stuffed fish."

Subject: "gram shtram"
A.L. Rickman inquired about the translation of a Yiddish aphorism, which 
he quotes as "Shtam gram, makh mir a letnik."

The actual saying is "Gram shtram, makh mir a letnik." My mother and 
grandmother often used this saying in the context of responding to 
something ridiculous, absurd, or nonsensical.
Doing a bit of research on the internet, I found that the expression was 
quoted by the author (M. Weissberg?) of "Sprichwoerter galizischer Juden" 
[Proverbs of Galician Jews], part III, published in "Am Ur-Quell: 
Monatschrift fuer Volkskunde," vol. 2, 1891, p. 131 (no. 36). In 
accordance with German spelling, he writes it as "Gram Stram mach mir a 
Letnik," and comments in a footnote:
"Dieses Sprichwort wird angewendet, wenn jemand unlogische 
Schlussfolgerungen zieht; ein bekannter Witzbold uebersetzte 
folgendermassen dieses Sprichwort: Reim, Sabbathmuetze mach mir ein 
Oberkleid!" [This proverb is used when someone draws illogical 
conclusions; a well known joker translates this proverb as follows: 
"Rhyme, Sabbath-cap make me an outer garment!"]

I would take issue with the "well known joker," who may have confused the 
word "shtram" with "shtraiml." "Letnik" is a word that means "summer 
clothing," not "outer garment."

The saying is included in Niborski and Vaisbort's "Dictionnaire 
Yiddish-Franais," glossed as "quel mli-mlo" (What a 
hodgepodge/jumble/mess/muddle), which is obviously not a real translation. 
"Gram-shtram" is defined by these authors as "vers de
mirliton" [doggerel].
So, Mr. Rickman, this is a case where the saying is perhaps as nonsensical 
as the statement for which it is a response!

Subject: Hasidic speech

On www.talkbank.org, one can now access recordings of 2 Hasidic young 
men's narratives. To get to these recordings:

1) click on CABANK
2) Under DATABASE click on "playback without downloading".
3) in the next window, on the left hand side, you'll see a batch of 
languages listed alphabetically.  Yiddish is at the bottom of the list.

These are recordings of young men I met at Chulent, the weekly meeting 
held in the Millinery Synagogue on Thursday nights.
