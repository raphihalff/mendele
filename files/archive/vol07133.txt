Subject: Levi Yitzhak

Does anybody know about a law suit--a din toyreh--brought by one Levi Yitzhak,
possibly a rabbi, possibly in Berditchev, possibly over a hundred years ago,
against God for not protecting Jews from terrorism (pogroms)? I seem to
remember mention of it and also lines of a Yiddish song sung by Jan Peerce
years ago ("ich bin gekumen tsu aych mit a din toyreh fun dain folk
Yisroel..."?) Does anybody happen to have more specific information about
when, where, and whether?

Subject: query for the linguists and onomastics specialists

Can anyone knowledgeable in Yiddish linguistics and/or onomastics help explain
how Yiddish apparently has two "reflexes" (I'm not sure if this is the correct
word) for the Hebrew name Shelomo; namely, Zalmen and Shloyme? Is there any
difference at any level between the two Yiddish names?  Is there a linguistic
term for this phenomenon?

Subject: Shakespeare in Yiddish

The recent death of a close friend brought to mind these wonderful lines that
Shakespeare put into Polonius's mouth as he spoke to his son Laertes about the
value of holding on to tried and true friends:  "Those friends thou hast and
their adoption tried, / Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel."  I was
wondering how this would sound in Yiddish, so I turned to my 1918 edition of
Israel J. Schwartz's Yiddish translation of Hamlet and found these lines:  _Di
fraynd vos du host oysgepruft getray, / Shmied tsu mit ayzn-rayfn tsu dayn
hartsn_.  The Yiddish lines, while lacking the majestic Shakespearian
resonance, do have a certain tenderness that I find appealing.  Thought I'd
share them with you. 

One other sentence that I find rather amusing occurs in these opening lines of
Julius Caesar:  FLAVIUS - "Hence!  Home, you idle creatures, get you home!  Is
this a holiday?"  Schwartz renders this into Yiddish thusly:  _Avek!  Aheym ir
leydigeyer, geyt aheym!  Vos iz haynt far a yontif_?  I'm refering to the last
sentence - an expression which I'm SURE I heard my mother use on several
occasions.  For instance, if somebody seemed, in her eyes, to be somewhat
overdressed for no special reason she might ask "_Vos iz haynt far a yontif_?" 
I post these random thoughts in hopes that others on this list might be
encouraged to share moreYiddish lines from English (or indeed, French,
Italian, etc.,) literature that they may find interesting or amusing.

Subject: Xmas in Yiddish  -- nit'l vs. veinachten

Xmas is rendered in Yiddish as either "nit'l" (Weinreich) or "der yom-tov
lichvod christos geburstag" (Harkavy, 1891 edition). However, on the Yiddish
side Harkavy gives Xmas as the English for both nit'l and veinachten. Abelson
renders Xmas as veinachten and in parenthesis he copies the "yom-tov" 
explanation from Harkavy. "veinachten" comes from German Weinachten where the
prefix Weih-e stands for consecrate or dedicate. Hence it is clear why
Weinreich did not include the word - it is German. One might wonder if Jewish
usage of the word was more than copy a German word. Was the prefix expanded to
double meaning such as "veinen" cry or weep or the Oy vey nacht? [Excuse my
non-YIVO spelling]

What is the etymology of "nit'l"? "Natal" means in English: of or pertaining
to a person's birth (Random House 2nd Ed, p. 1279) thus it is probably
relating to J's birth; cf. neonatal, prenatal, etc. Is it also a double
meaning form "nit" [or nicht/nisht] meaning "absence" to represent that it did
not mean a thing to the Jews? Or that it was prohibited to study Torah that
night? ("mitor nit lernen Torah") Or maybe from the Aramaic "leil neturei" for
the Hebrew leil shimurim (See Onkelos to Ex 12:42) to mean "a night of
guarding/a night of watching"?

Subject: Rose Auslaender

With reference to our shames's remarks about Rose Auslaender [07.131:8] I
might note that I also tried to follow up the references to her given in
Joseph Kruse's _Von Franzos zu Canetti..._. In particular I was interested to
see her book _My Dear Roisele: Itzig Manger, Elieser Steinbarg:  jiddische
Dichter aus der Bukowina, [Schriftenreihe der Rose Auslaender-
Dokumentationszentrum 6], Uxheim: Rose Auslaender-Dokumentationszentrum, 1996,
174pp. [ISBN: 3-93182607-4] which prima facie seemed to be the item of
greatest Yiddish interest. Having failed to obtain it through the normal
channels of the German book trade, I wrote to the Dokumentationszentrum in
Uxheim, only to have my letter returned by the Post Office with a note to the
effect that the centre no longer existed. Does anyone know for certain whether
the book was published or only announced and, if published, where it could be
obtained?

Subject: "Yiddish" on Bartoli Record

Recently someone recommended the Bartoli recording of Ravel's Chants Amour.
Indeed it is wonderful.  However, the so called Yiddish is most peculiar. 
Germanized both as to vocabulary and structure, capitalization, spelling,etc.
Does anyone know the history of this?  Is it what Ravel had access to or what?!

Subject: hekdesh

In the discussion of the origins of the Yiddish/Hebrew word Hekdesh, Arnie
Kuzmack questions the validity of my explanation of the derivation of kadesh
from "Kad esh" (burning by fire) by saying that 3-letter words do not work
that way.  I would like to point out that, prior to the 12th century,
grammarians maintained that Hebrew words may consist of one or two letters
also (Veyach-and he hit).  The need for three-letter words, according to
grammarian Joseph Kimchi, came about in around the 12th century. 

Dr. Abraham Lipshitz, a Chicago area grammarian, points out that early
grammarians David Kimchi and Samuel David Luzzato firmly maintained that
kadesh/holy means the designation of separateness resulting from the
separation of the sacrificial animals from the other animals. 

Consequently, anything designated as separate for a purpose (even a profane
purpose) is termed kadesh.  And Hekdesh was a designated (holy) place for the
poor.
