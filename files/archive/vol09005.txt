Subject: Alsatian Yiddish

Leo Secunda, in a note released by Mendele on Apr. 30, expressed suspicion
that the Strassbourg Jews speak Yiddish.  His comments were as a result of a
wonderful posting about the big Yiddish experience in Mulhouse. 

I think that there may be some confusion involved when one speaks about
Yiddish in Alsace.  There are actually two completely different Yiddish
languages spoken in Alsace, the first being Eastern Yiddish than anyone
raised in an East European houshold can deal with.  It is the traditional
Yiddish that one thinks of when the word "Yiddish"  is used. 

The second Yiddish is quite different, so much so that speakers of Eastern
Yiddish can barely communicate in this very local dialect, sometimes called
Judeo-Alsatian or Western Yiddish. 

I scanned the web to come up with a few websites and other things that might
interest Leo and cause him to change his mind about Western Yiddish whose
use is seriously declining but was very popular up to the second world war. 

See "Yedisch-Daitsch, Le dialecte judeo-alsacien on

        http://www.sdv.fr/judaisme/dialecte/index.htm

which contains classical judeo alsatian humor, a lexicon of Judeo Alsatian
and lots of other goodies. 

Also see Astrid Starck's page:

        http://www.crel.univ-mulhouse.fr/0mulhous/Cherchers/starck.html

Starck is the mavin of Western Yiddish and was the leader of a big
conference that took place in Alsace ca. 1994 and for which she published a
summary of the conference: "Westjiddisch:  Mundlichkeit und Schriftlichkeit
= Le Yiddish occidental: actes de colloque de Mulhouse." 

I spend almost every summer in Alsace and my wife's cousin has been trying
to teach me judeo-alsatian but he becomes furious whenever I can't figure
something out and say "Vos?  Vos hast du gesukt?"  And then he says, "Pas
cette pastiche Yiddish.  Du vrai Yiddish, s.v.p."  I'm working on it. 

To complicate the matter, west of Alsace there is yet another dialect called
judeo-lorraine, but I'm not going near that one.

Subject: Yiddish opera in Israel

1. For Harvey Varga: My yidishe mame used the term shmey-drey for umetik. 
At the slighest sign of pallor (which included any lack of bubbling over
with life), she would comment, "Du filst epes shmey-drey? Vos felt dir, mayn
kind?" 

2. Sam Kweskin bemoans that our radio stations do not play our Yidishe art
lider. He questions the attitude and motivation of American radio
programmers.

The very bad news is that Miriam Hoffman in last week's Forverts writes that
our own people in Israel waited in anticipation to laugh at the first
Yiddish opera - The Dybbuk - which was to be presented for audition. 

The good news is that they admitted it surprised them, overwhelming them
with its beauty! Finally - success - a famous first! Yiddish opera in
Israel.

Subject: "Lodzer" or "Zlodjeh" Gonniff

My late father, from Lodz, used the phrase "Lodzer Gonniff," or it may have 
been "Zlodjeh Gonniff."

I would appreciate some information regarding the above.

Thank you,

Subject: Louis Kramer

Sholem Aleykhem,

I am in the process of attempting to translate Louis Kramer's play "Believe
Your Wife."  It is an attempt because I am having difficulty with Kramer's
cursive style.  Does anyone have a translated version of this play or any
insight into how Kramer wrote his letters. 

A sheynam dank,

Mordkhe Saunders

Subject: Hebrew words

Tayere Mendelayner

Years ago I began to recognize that, while most words in the Yiddish
language are derived from German, there is a significant number that derive
from Hebrew. Words such as koyakh (strength), bukher (young man), kuvid
(honor), khussen (groom), parnusseh (livelihood), zukkin (old man), and many
more, fall into this category. 

Is there a compiled list somewhere that does it all, and at the same time
gives some explanation as to why those words in particular were chosen?

Subject: Retekh

Mendy Fliegler mentioned in his recent posting about a children's program 
in the Washington/Maryland area.  He mentioned a story, _Der Retekh_ (the
horse-radish). 

Just a minor correction: retekh isn't a horseradish, it's a radish. 
Horseradish is khreyn.

Could you please let me know the origin of the Yiddish word "khrain"
(horseradish)?

Many thanks.

Subject: Ashkenazik handwriting

Marion Aptroot says that the Rothschild brithers "wrote in very distinctive
Ashkenazic hands.  Just what does this mean?  What distinguishes Ashkenazik
handwriting from any other kind?

Bela"z:

I concur with what Marion stated vis-a-vis the letters from the Rothschild
Archive.  I was also being considered for the translator position in London
about ten or eleven years ago.  The samples that I got to see were in a very
distinctive Judeo-German hand, basically German text in the Jewish alphabet. 
Unfortunately, no true elements of Western Yiddish were in evidence,
something that came as a disappointment to me as well.
