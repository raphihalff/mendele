Subject: beyndl (A metaphor)

The translation I am working on contains many references to topics that are
raised in Mendele. With regard to Jack Berger's inquiry (10.024) about the
use of bones in warding off the evil eye, I have the following passage. The
author is describing an incident that occured when he was ten years old; on
the way home from school one night, he was frightened by a wild boar and
fainted:

     When I came to my senses, opened my eyes and looked around to see vu
     ikh bin in der velt, I saw myself lying in bed, oyf a hoykhen barg
     kishens, with wet towels on my forehead. Around my stood di tateh, di
     mameh, di shvester Pesheh - alle mit blaykhe, tzeshrockene punimer -
     and a house full of neighbors. Someone was waving a bone back and forth
     over my head: op-geton mir a "gute-luft": another sh'kheyneh, armed
     with a bissel zaltz, was warding of the "eyn-horreh". Di mameh hot
     ibber mayn kop oys-gegossen bley un vaks. And thanks to all these
     refuos un segulos, which they administered to me, I was able to emerge
     from this near-calamity a leybe-dikker.

(From "Oyf Fremder Erd", by Falk Zolf, Winnipeg, 1945).

Subject: beyndl

The beyndl could be a thread (bendl). To do away with the "ayin hara" a red
thread was used.

Subject: di zogerke

Nokh Charlotte Honigman-Smith's frage vegn di role fun der "zogerke": Di
dozike kleyne maysseleh iz genummen fun der bukh "Oyf Fremder Erd", vus iz
geshrieben fun an amoliker Winnipeger, Falk Zolf, vegn zayn yugent in
Vays-Rusland in di yohren far der Ershter Velt-Milkhomme. Der mekhobber
bashraybt do zayn eygenne muter:

     In the women's shul, she was the leading "zogerkeh"...every shabbos un
     yontif, all the wives would gather around her table...di "shtumme
     neshumos", nebbekh, who weren't blessed with the learning to be able to
     read on their own the holy letters (heylike oysyos'lekh),  and they
     would therefore hang on the mameh's every word. Every Tisha-B'av in the
     evening, our little shtibeleh would be filled with those women, who had
     come to hear a "gruss" (greeting) from far-away Yerushalayim, and to
     weep together over the destruction of the heylikn Beys-Hamikdash, and
     also over their own "khurben", their own sacrifices, which continued
     unabated through their daily lives. The women sat on the ground, or on
     the lange, ibber-gekehrte kheder-benches,  as though they were sitting
     shiva for a dear, departed family member, while the mameh, mit a
     veynen-dikker, tze-brokhener shtimmeh began to read for them the
     "Megillos Eykheh" (Book of Lamentations), the story of the khurben
     Yerushalayim, and the story of the "asareh  herugei malkhut" (The Ten
     Martyrs). The tiny shtibeleh would soon be filled with tears, mit
     yellolos, mit krekhtzen un mit geveynen, as though they were takkeh
     mourning someone who had just died. And we "kleynvarg", sitting
     together in our corner, held tightly to one another, un' hobben oykh
     (also) mit-geveynt...

Subject: di zogerke

There is a photo of a "zogerke" in a small red brochure from the Jewish
Museum in NY. Perhaps there is such  a painting in the Jewish Museum.

Subject: di zogerke

Mention of the "zogerke" is to be found in Chaim Grade's book "Der Mame's
Shabosim".

Page 33. Relevant information can be deduced from pages 33 and 34.

Subject: zay mir nit kayn feter...

In response to Lilian Dubb (10.025), the expression as I know it from years
ago is: Zay mir nit keyn feter un koyf mir nit keyn shikh.  The closest
idiomatic English translation would be:  Don't do me any favors.  I don't
know why it would be used in payment of a debt unless there was ill will
between the lender & the debtor.  It literally means:  Don't be my uncle
(buddy) & don't buy me any shoes.  Along w/don't do me any favors is the
implicit -- or explicit -- admonition, keep your distance; you're not my
intimate.

I hope this helps.

Subject: peretz's tsvey brider in English translation

In answer to Ron Biderman's query as to where there exists a translation of
Peretz's "Tsvey Brider," there is one in "Volume III: Peretz" of the
3-volume set called "The Three Great Classic Writers of Modern Yiddish
Literature" edited by Zuckerman and Herbst, published by Joseph Simon; also
it can be found in Leftwich's anthology called "The Golden Peacock."

Subject: kirtsungen -- abbreviations

A reference article on Yiddish abbreviations, compiled by yours truly, is to
be found in the last issue of the YIVO publication _Yidishe shprakh_.  I put
it together in 1984 and the volume was published in 1986/88, I think.  It
doesn't include acronyms, notwithstanding the erroneous English title of the
article (e.g. YIVO, TsIShO, etc.), but it is a fairly complete collection of
Yiddish-only abbreviations (i.e. ones which Yiddish and Hebrew share and may
thus be found in Hebrew collections).

Subject:

On Mendele 024, Zisel Sterlin asks about a list of yiddish abbreviations,
such as "alef, alef, tsvey vovn" (romanizes as u.a."v, (i.e. un azoy vayter,
or etc., and so on).

You will find many such abbreviations within the text of Harkavi's 1928
Yiddish-English-Hebreyish Verterbukh, listed alphabetically. e.g. beys hey
(b"h - abbrev. for borukh haShem) is listed on p.113, not on p.100 where you
might expect it to be.

Weinreich's dictionary also gives abbreviations within the text. Some
entries are differ from those in Harkavy, e.g. instead of u.a"v he uses
u.az"v, but they are also within the text rather than listed on a separate
page of abbreviations.

Interestingly, in his 1898 English-Yiddish/Yiddish-English Dictionary,
Harkavy includes a separate page of English abbreviations (p. xvi), but I
could not find a corresponding page of  Yiddish abbreviations.
