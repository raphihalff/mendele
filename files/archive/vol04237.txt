Very strange.  Isn't there a halokhe that bread may not be milkhik unless
it is has an unusual, out of the ordinary, appearance?  Is this perhaps
the origin of the twist?  That twist bread is originally properly
milkhik?

Subject: Otwock, Bereza Kartuska

To Kathryn Hellerstein [Vol. 4.236]:

Both Otwock and Bereza Kartuska were within the borders of Poland in
1923. Otwock was a popular resort just 16 miles ESE of Warsaw. Bereza
Kartuska, located about 58 miles WNW of Pinsk in present-day Belarus, was
the site of a notorious concentration camp set up by the Polish
government between the two World Wars to house political opponents of the
regime.

1. Bereza Kartuska was in prewar Poland, but is now in
Belarus, where it is known as Biaroza (on Russian maps:  Bereza).
It is in the Brest _oblast'_ at 52*5' N, 25*0' E.

2. Otwock is and was in Poland.  It is located some 30 km
southeast of Warsaw.

Subject: Otwock, Bereza Kartuska

I checked in my five volume 1959 (London) Times Atlas.  I found Otwock
close to Warsaw on  the road to Lublin.  I do not know  if that is the
one with  the hot springs.   This was surely  in Poland also  in 1923.
There  are many  entries  of  places in  Belorus,  Ukraine and  Russia
starting "Berez..", but  nothing exactly Bereze or  Kartuskay or their
combination.  The closest fit could be Bereza in Belorus some 60 miles
north-east of Brest (Litovsk) on the road to Bobruysk.  It is possible
that before 1939 it was in Poland as it is pretty close to the present
Polish border, and might have been taken then by USSR.  I have no easy
way to check this.

Subject: Otwock, Bereza Kartuska

Both the towns you ask about were in Poland c. 1923. Otwock: resort town
very near Warsaw. Kartusz Bereza: Pilsudski sent his political enemies to
a concentration camp there in 1930. If you need more, I can dig out some
maps and check further.

Subject: Ghooghit

I really have to thank Dovid Braun, Khayem, and Shleyme Axelrod for
helping me figure out that what I thought was ghooghit is really zhuzhet.
And I was in hysterics for a full 10 minutes realizing how badly I had
stated that word and what it was that we had to go through to get the
sound of the word from my ear to your head.  (My wife keeps saying, "I
told you it was "zh...")

It was worth everything to have gotten this matter poked around on
Mendele.  I'm still giggling and smiling and laughing and chortling and
even my ear doesn't zhuzhet any longer.  You guys may not have found it
funny, but I am absolutely exhausted from splitting my sides.

However, the description of the ankle pain given by Shleyme has no
character.  There should be a special word for an ankle pain.

Subject: Tshatshke/tsatske

The Polish word _cacko_ [tsatsko] is usually explained as a dialectism
for the older _czaczko_ [chachko], variants of which exist elsewhere in
Slavic. The etymological dictionaries treat this as coming from baby
talk--a nursery word for 'toy'.
