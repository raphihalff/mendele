Subject: yekum-purk(o)n-zup

Re: question about yekum-purk(o)n-zup by Susan Ganc [08.027]

I am glad to hear that the TMR publication of Zvi Kanar's 'opgegebn broyt was
read by a group in Houston. (Although a 'toytnmarsh' is the main subject of
the story, it is not its title.).  The writer will be thrilled that his story
spread that far through the Internet and the editor of the TMR will be
pleased that reading circles make use of his work.  Niborski gives for
yekum-purk(o)n (not Yakum-purkn): onheyb un nomen fun tsvey brokhes vos me
zogt shabes in der fri. (not in the afternoon).  Tsanin gives for yekum:
veznheyt; veltal; klal-bashefenishn; velt fun balekhaim.  for purkon:
oysleyzung; bafrayung.  I therefore understood the meaning to be similar to:
mekhaye-meysim or mekhaye-nefoshes.  In my Dutch translation I translated:
'elixer of life'. Modne (not mudne) does not seem to fit, nor mishmash.

Subject: kakapitzi

Re: kakapitzi (Susan Ganc, Vol 08.027)

Susan Ganc assumes kakapitzi is a nonsense word which doesn't sound very
nice. I just guess that it has not do with a 'kaka' variant but with a Polish
duck:  P. Kaczka -duck + P. pieczen - roast

If that would be the case, another meaning might have to be found for
'zoymen', because Turkey-seeds make less sense than roast duck [zoymen: Hark.
zoym, -en -seam, border; zoymen - seed, linseed (c.  zamen)]

Unless 'pitzi' is Y. pitsel - little bit. In that case the 'zoymen' could be
'thin slices'???? 

Lucas Bruyn

[Moderator's note: The shames strongly suspects significantly less glamorous
Slavic etymology of the word in question. I hope we would avoid an extended
discussion on this subject.  - i.v.]

Subject: "disappointment" in Yiddish

Weinreich's dictionary gives "antoyshung" which is also what I remember my
parents using.    

Martin Davis

this was the punch-line for a famous joke and I had to make a long distance
call to my papa in New York to get the correct word, which is now imbedded
in my brain!  A son called his yiddisher mama to say he would not be coming
for shabbas dinner and she responded that she was zeher, zeher disappointed
!! the yiddish word is  antoysh .......use it three times and you won't
forget it!
zy gezunt un shtark, 

cherna wolpin  -  buffalo, n.y. <MandCWolpin@compuserve.com>

Dolores Kreisman thinks there is no Yiddish word for disappointment. 
Weinreich gives several translations for the word and so does Harkavy. Also
Yiddish translations for disappoint, disappointed, and disappointing can be
found in these standard works. [I don't want to cause you any 'yiesh',
'toyshung', 'antoyshung', 'genar', 'opgenartkeyt' or 'onfirn', but why don't
you look it up yourself?]

I would like to remark in general that knowing Yiddish, having a friend or
teacher or mother or grandmother who knows it - irreplaceable resources as
they are, is no excuse for not having a set of dictionaries or not looking in
them. Weinreich, Harkavi and Niborski are a must, Tsanin and the 'oytser'
often useful and a Polish and Russian dictionary ought to be on your shelf.
If you cannot afford the expense, bring your computer to the pawnshop. 

Also in general I would like to remind Mendelist that it takes normally less
time to ask a question than to answer it. Even if someone knows the answer to
a particular question, he might have to check dictionaries or biographies or
spent much time finding back a place in literature where he last saw a word
or expression. I think it would be a good habit to mail a (short) 'thank you'
note to people providing an answer. 

Lucas Bruyn <troia@wxs.nl>

disappointed in Yiddish is, I believe, "antoished". hope this helps. 

Fran Townes (richfranto@aol.com)

There is a yiddish word for [disapointed] -- it is [ antoished ].  I am new
at the computer and interested in yiddish and hebrew.  Finding mendele was
wonderful.

Subject: nyunya

Mickey Brown asks about the origin of the word nyunya [08.028].  I would
guess from his explanation that is had to do with R. njukh - scent, nose,
flair.  The dutch equivalent would be 'snufferd' - the thing you snuff or
sniff with, nose, face. 

Lucas Bruyn.

From: "Robert Goldenberg" <goldenbe@vaxxine.com>
Subject: nyunya

Mickey Brown, in Mendele 08.028, mentions "nyunya" used for "nose." We heard
and used the word "nonye" to refer to a prominent nose or to a busybody, i.e.
someone sticking their nose (groyse nonye) in someone's business. Mayne
eltern hobn geshtamt fun besarabye. Agev, ikh zog "eltern,"  nisht
"tate-mame" oder "tote-mome." Ikh hob gehert az besaraber zogn "tote-mome."
In der heym, hob ikh nit gehert "tote-mome." Vi ikh dermon zikh, zey hobn
gezogt "tate-mame," ober ikh bin nisht zikher. Nit lang hob ikh zikh bagegnt
