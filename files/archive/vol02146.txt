Subject: keeping gender of borrowed words

My reminiscence about Brazil leads me to a new question.
Perhaps ellen or one of the other linguists has an answer.
When words are borrowed into Yiddish from another language
where the word has a gender, is the gender preserved?
Borrowings from Hebrew are, but is that a special case? Or
is it axiomatic that if, say, a word like jeito or bagunca
is borrowed from Portuguese, it will keep its gender in
Yiddish (gib a groisn jeito?  makh a miese bagunca?)

Does the answer depend on whether the endings indicating
gender in the source language have any correspondence to
those in Yiddish?

And what about borrowings the other way?  Do Yiddish words
keep their gender when borrowed into, say, French?

(I note from Noyekh's summary that Mendele has one
subscriber from Brazil.  Gostaria de receber resposta dessa
pessoa, se souber algo disso.)

Subject: On the Spelling of Jewish Names

David Sherman signs his interesting article:

     "David (Daniel Moishe) Sherman"

This makes me wonder, if, as I know, it is customary for
Yiddishist to write  Moishe and  not the  Sefaradi way,
Moshe, why  Daniel and  not Doniel, or  even Doniyel? There
is  a qamatz, sorry qometz,  under the dalet.  Are there
any rules about it? Are names common also in English
treated differently?

Subject: a kashe

A kashe  far di mit glider b'frat lingvistn un andere vos
bamein zikh mit der elterer yidisher literatur. I'm writing
about the Tsenerene and attempting to transate a citation
from Khone Shmeruk's reference to Yakov Ashkenazi's "melitz
yoysher " where the author, referring to the Tsenerene says
that "the whole world wants to learn from this book and
therefore it was printed many more times than other
'kestlikhe' sforim." kestlikhe is spelled: kuf,eyen,shin or
sin,tes,lamed,yud,khof,yud.Is it perhaps "gaystlikhe"? The
Shmeruk article is "Di Mizrakh Eyropeyishe nuskhoes fun der
Tsenerene 1850-1786 in For Max Weinreich on his 70th
Birthday, p.338. Your comments would be welcome. A sheynem
dank,

Dvosye Bilik
