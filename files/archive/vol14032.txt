Subject: Re:zi geyt in spodek

It does have some negative connotations, exactly like its English version. See
below from Sholom Aleychem:

Further to my query about "zi geyt in spodek", Raphael Finkel draws my
attention to the following 3 expressions (particularly relevant to my
context) in Stutchkoff's _Oytser fun der yidisher shprakh_.  Since Stutchkoff
does not provide definitions, I would greatly appreciate hearing from
anyone who knows any of these expressions and   how they would be used or
what their meanings are.

-- az dos vayb geyt in spodik geyt der man in pantofl
-- az der rov geyt in shtrayml geyt di rebetsin in spodik

You will see by my signature why this matter interested me. I haven't heard of
"geyn in spodek". I and family members understand "spodek" ("spodick") to have
two translations: a cylindrical fur hat .I have seen a photo of it in  a
newspaper that covered the large family of Spodicks that came from Sag Harbor,
Long Island, NY (my father's family). The other meaning is a saucer. There are
two  associated idioms: "dreyen a spodick" and "dulen a spodick". The
expression "  tsudrey mir nisht ken spodick" means "don't put me on" or "don't
badger me". I  hope the foregoing is of interest and welcome your comments.

The expression," es geyt im on in spodek" is close in meaning to "he couldn't
care less."

Subject: Re: Yiddish with Palm OS 5

Concerning Yiddish on the Zire [Mendele 14.031]:

You have two options, as far as I know: first you will need to purchase the
PiLOC software (http://software.palmone.com/) to localize your Zire for
Hebrew/Yiddish.

Then you have the option of using Hebrew to Go, which is the Hebrew equivalent
of the DocsToGo software that came with your handheld.

Subject: "Bum" in Yiddish

50-60 years ago I often heard the term "trumbernik" used among
English-speaking Jews to describe to a young man who was a good-for-nothing or
a bum. The word does not appear in Harkavy's dictionary. In fact, the English
word "bum" used in the same sense does not appear. 2 questions: how does one
say in Yiddish "ne-er do-well or "bum," and does "trumbernik" exist; if so,
how is it used? Sound like a derivative of a trumpeter, but musicians could
not be considered that bad in colloquial discourse. Thanks for reply.

In regards to the query in Mendele 14.031:

Yes, there really was someone - but he's generally known as the
Chofetz Chaim.

For starters, see basic info on him at these websites.
