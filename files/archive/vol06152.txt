Subject: Rusalke

"Rusalke" probably comes from the same place as the Russian "rusalka",
which is something like a mermaid.

In Mendele vol 6.147 Khane-Faygl Turtletaub was asking the meaning of
rusalke. In Ukrainian the word means a mermaid.

In reply to Ellen Prince's query [6.149] about Slavic influences on
Yiddish syntax:

Multiple WH-fronting is a relevant phenomenon.

Subject: Slavic component of Yiddish

Ellen Prince (6.149) writes that in ten years she has "not yet found
anything in Yiddish syntax that could be construed as Slavic, at least
not by what theoretical syntacticians mean by 'syntax'". Given the level
of abstraction with which theoretical syntacticians approach syntax
nowadays, it may be difficult to find any significant differences
between Yiddish & Slavic syntax  in the first place. Still, those who
claim that there is Slavic influence have a few (very few) examples and
it would be instructive to learn why such examples as the following are
not good examples.

1. The position of the reflexive pronoun after the infinitive verb when
the verb is the subject of the sentence 'bodn zikh nokh heyser arbet iz
a mekhaye" is like Polish, but unlike German.

2. The use of "negative" clauses of purpose after certain verbs, e.g.
'ikh hob moyre, dos kind zol nit veynen' -- I'm afraid the child might
cry  -- is again like Polish, but unlike German.

3. Regionally, negative imperatives are formed on the pattern 'nit
veyn', like Polish, but unlike German (and the rest of Yiddish).

Subject: "Ikh fur aheym"

Does anyone know, or know where I can obtain, the words (and the music)
to the yiddish song "Ikh Fur Aheym?"   I'd also like to know who has
recorded this song and is it available on tape?  Additional information
on who wrote the song in what year would also be interesting to hear
about.

Subject: Poetry (for beginners)

[Regarding Chava Ermentrout's query (6.151)]:

Try to find:

	Abraham Sutzkever, The Fiddle Rose (Poems 1970-1972)
	Wayne State University Press, Detroit 1990,
	ISBN 0-8143-2001-5, ISBN 0-8143-2002-3 (paperback)

It's a bilingual edition with the Yiddish text in Hebrew script and an
English translation on the facing page.  Illustrated with Chagall's
drawings.

Beginning readers or not, the poetry absolutely stunning - but Sutzkever
doesn't need an introduction here.  Grab it.  It's just beautiful.  What
I particularly like about his poetry is a sort of magic realism in it:
one of the poems, for instance, has a cherry tree growing from the dream
into the reality of the day ("...tsevig ikh oyf der vor die tsvaygn /
aroysgevaksene fun kholem").

Subject: Bilingual Yiddish poetry books

In response to Chava Ermentrout's request in Mendele 6.151 for bilingual
Yiddish poetry books, I can mention the following:

(1) The Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse (Howe, Wisse,Shmeruk-eds)

(2) Onions and Cucumbers and Plums (Sarah Zweig Betsky, Wayne State
University Press, 1958)

(3) An Anthology of Modern Yiddish Poetry (Ruth Whitman, October House
Inc., New York, 1966)

Subject: When is one considered a Yiddishist?

Sarah Benor writes [6.151,1] that one of her Yiddish literature
professors says that Morris Rosenfeld does not qualify for the
Yiddishist title. I have no problems with that. What bothers me a little
more is that some other Yiddish literature professors themselves easily
qualify for true Englishists (my reading of Webster's dictionary
suggests that Englishist is the one who advocates use of English
language as oppose to e.g. Spanish or Yiddish).

But, on a serious note, the classical definition of an Yiddishist was
offered by Sholem Aleichem in "Kasrilevke progres" (chapter XII,
"Idishistn un hebreistn"). There we learn that if one pronounces
_mikhnosaim_ he (or she) is clearly an Yiddishist. But, if _mikhnataim_
is your choice, then sorry. The club is closed. The beauty of this test
is that it can be easily self-administered, does not require any
expensive equipment or an advanced degree in comparative literature. Do
we need anything better?
