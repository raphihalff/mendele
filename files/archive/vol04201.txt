Subject: Offers of help

I was astonished to sense the fierce resentment aroused by Zellig Bach's
offer to help with writing romanized Yiddish.  I can't understand that.
In solitude, with my computer keyboard, I can construct a few decent
Yiddish paragraphs with the silent help of my friends, Weinreich, Harkavy
and YIVO. It takes time, and I would not want to burden any volunteers
with work I can do myself (to adequate degree).  If, some years ago, I
was offered the kind of help suggested by Zellig, I would have jumped at
the chance.  I would not have been shy about using someone's time.

An inducement for the teacher: The teacher also learns.  Teaching and
learning cannot be separated.  They are always simultaneous.  Yiddish
(unlike German) recognizes that phenomenon by using lernen for both
simultaneous processes (inserting the reflexive zikh for finer
distinction).  You could add criticism, too, as an essential element in
the soup.  It s no shame.  All elements are necessary.  The teacher will
inevitably learn, and will get useful criticism.  No guilt should be felt
by any helpee, and no helper ever earns the right to be arrogant.  To me,
it all sounded like a friendly offer, colleague to colleague.

It s clear.  Those who do not want help need not ask for it.  But there's
no reason to interpret generosity to the group as a slap in anyone's
individual ponim.  Reaching for high standards is good.  It takes time.
Jews have always worked hard to meet such demands.  Sure, we can relax
and enjoy our attainments, but there's always more to attain.  Why stop?

I would be happy to volunteer to help where I can, but I fear the
possible howls of resentment.

Relax.  Helpers are not dangerous beasts.

Subject: The "friendly" editorial board idea

I would like to express my assent with the refreshing, useful comments
made by Dan Slobin and Dan Leeson about Zellig Bach's recommendation that
Yiddish texts on Mendele be "corrected" before being released on the
network.  For as pointless as I find it to debate endlessly about how to
best represent Yiddish with the Roman alphabet (I believe Arn Abramson
pointed out that a guide is available to anyone interested), I find it
even worse to imagine that many of the (perhaps less than fully fluent)
speakers of Yiddish out there might choose to not express themselves at
all in Yiddish because of some heightened concern for "grammatical"
Yiddish.  If we were talking about an organized, edited publication in
Yiddish (e.g. Afn shvel, di goldene keyt etc.) then I believe no one
would question the need for an editorial board (indeed it would be
unthinkable to have a journal without one!).  But I have always
understood Mendele to be a forum for the free exchange of ideas,
questions, inspiration etc.  I hope others feel as I do, that it would be
a shame to impose prescriptivist norms on such a rare situation as this.

Subject: Experiments

Khayem Bochner, a blessing on his head, is trying to add more tasks to my
busy life. Most of my speech rsearch is done at Haskins Laboratories,
where I am a Research Associate; however, it would not be right for me to
use time and facilities there for work, interesting though it might be,
that is not supported by one of our grants. I might, nevertheless, be
able to squeeze in a little exploratory work in our lab at The University
of Connecticut. Although I retired from the faculty there over two years
ago, as Professor Emeritus I still access to space and equipment in the
Department of Linguistics. For that matter, some of the work can be done
in my house!

By the way, Khayem's kind words about me force me to demur a bit. Two
other  members of ours, my colleagues Leigh Lisker and Alice Faber, who
are also Research Associates at Haskins, could also do this work. Indeed,
Leigh and I have been "business partners" for many years in a series of
cross-language studies on voicing, aspiration, etc. There is only one
native speaker of Yiddish around here whom I can get to without too much
trouble. One or more of you would have to send me the necesary tape
recordings on a cassette. As I said in a recent message, the items of
interest to us would have to be recorded in identical or very similar
contexts. For example: Veyst ir vos er redt? vs. Zeyt ir vemen er ret? I
hope these are idiomatic. We would have to have, say, five utterances of
each recorded by each informant. Also, the list of items to be recorded
should contain as many fake items as real ones, and the whole bunch
should be somewhat randomized. That is, we don't want the purpose of the
exercise to be obvious to our speakers. (With all respect to the native
speakers among us, if any of you offered to record the items, I would
like to be assured that you are using very natural, relaxed speech
without trying for clear distinctions.)

As for Khayem's recollections on aspiration in Yiddish from the
literature, I cannot comment, as I have not been following that
literature. I hope that Mikhl Herzog can help us in this. My own
impression is that the stop consonants /ptk/ are aspirated before
vowels, unless preceded by /sh/ as in /shpeyt/ 'late.' I think also that
there is no aspiration in such expressions as /bistu/ or /hostu/. My
reasoning, and Leigh Lisker's, is that in this  context there is no
contrast between /t/ and /d/, so, in the absence of what I think is the
normaal aspiration, how do we justify insisting on calling that consonant
/t/ rather than /d/. These auditory impressions of mine come from
listening, both here and in Europe--and, for that matter, Asia--to
speakers of a number of Yiddish dialects. As a non-Yiddishist, I have
never looked at the question systematically.

Let me make it clear that by "aspiration" I mean nothing exotic. It is
essentially what we hear at the beginnings of the English words "ten,
toe, pear, poor, core" and the standard German words "Paar, Tat, Kind."
