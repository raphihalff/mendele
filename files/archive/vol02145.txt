Dave Sherman's example has reminded me that publications
need not be related to Yiddish ...

Bochner, Harry (1992), "Simplicity in Generative

Concerning "hek/gdesh": the term was applied to a communal
facility for the old and sick poor. Bedlam?

Subject: Pedantry, and yeshiva English

I fully agree with Dovid Braun's comments about Yiddish
being used in more "sophisticated" environments than we
sometimes give it credit for.  I'm watching my own Yiddish
develop as Ariela (our oldest) gets older and discussions
with her need to move up a level.  (She'll be 9 in a few
months.)  I may have to develop a whole vocabulary for
income tax!

I haven't run into kapdan in everyday conversation, but in
modern Judaeo-English it's quite normal to describe someone
as "being makpid on" some issue.  (Same Hebrew root, of
course.) One can be makpid both on religious matters and on
non-religious issues (e.g., how carefully a picture is hung
on a wall).

Is there any current research or scholarship on today's
Judaeo-English in North America, as found in the yeshiva
world and in Orthodox communities?  A normal English
speaker would probably have quite some difficulty
understanding ordinary conversation in certain circles, due
to the number of borrowings from Hebrew and Yiddish.  My
(anecdotal) sense is that this trend is growing, possibly
in tandem with the steady progression of the Orthodox world
to the right.  Perhaps it's a psychological substitute for
the large portion of the modern frum community who
can't/don't speak Yiddish, but want the same "withdrawal"
from secular society that Yiddish provides to the Chassidic
world.  Comments?

On rereading my own posting in Mendele, I'm reminded of the
days I spent as a guest of Rabbi Alpern and his family (a
Lubavitcher family) in Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1971.  We'd
lived in Brazil from 1968-70 and I returned to visit
friends. At the time I spoke no Yiddish.  The Alperns spoke
Yiddish with their young children.  I vividly remember the
Rebbetzin coming into the living room, where the kids had
strewn toys around, and saying "Vos hostu gemakht aza
bagunc,a!"  (The "c," is c-cedilla; bagunc,a is the
standard word for mess in Sao Paulo Portuguese.)

Evidently the lack of a good word for "mess" in Yiddish is
widespread.  I don't recall the Alperns' Yiddish including
a large number of borrowed words from Portuguese.

Subject: Pedantry revisited (der shames farentfert zikh)

Thanks to those who've corrected me in the matter of a
Yiddish word for pedant.

My question was badly put.  I was much less interested in
the existence of a _word_ for pedant than in the _idea_.
Here's my last sentence:

    Or--and I guess this is my point--the concept.

In other words, even if Mikhl is right that my (imaginary)
feter and tante would have known about medakdek and maybe
even Jeff Finger's kapdan, the question really was: is
there a Yiddish word for "one who pays undue attention to
book learning and formal rules.."(AHD)?  Is there a Yiddish
word for the kind of dry sterile scholar that the English
word conveys?  I can't think of one.

I base my remarks not on what I hear because what I hear
(among the elderly members of the Yiddish group I run at
the local Home) is pretty elementary at best.  Yiddish
literature, however, is full of references to learned men
and there are dozens of expressions to sort through (this
is particularly true of Chaim Grade).  But they are all,
without exception, terms of praise and respect.  A Jew who
knows his way around di kleyne oyseyes is someone to be
reckoned with, not scorned or laughed at. Is there anywhere
in Yiddish fiction the counterpart of George Eliot's Mr.
Casaubon or Goethe's Wagner?  I've never run across one.

Is it fair to infer the lineaments of a culture (and social
structure) from what's missing?  That's what I was trying
to do.  And still want to do.  So I repeat my request for
words (better: ideas) that aren't.

Noyekh
