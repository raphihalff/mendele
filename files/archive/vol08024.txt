Subject: THERESE LIBERMAN JASMIN (1939-1998)

It is with great sorrow that we mourn the untimely death of Therese Libermann
Jasmin, 59, founder of the programs in Yiddish on the French Jewish radio
stations. 

When I started the first Jewish radio in France, "Radio J" , as an illegal
broadcasting station back in June 1981 in Paris, I asked Therese to run the
programs in Yiddish. After a few months, the Jewish community had four Jewish
stations, including another of my creations, "Judaiques FM", and Therese
followed me in that new venture. After a while, the stations were legalized
and she went on broadcasting for the past seventeen years, without sponsors,
without budget, driven by the urge of maintaining a Yiddish voice on the air.
All the figures of the Paris Yiddish scene were part of her program. 

After a long battle with leukemia, Therese died in Jerusalem on July 11,
1998, at the Hadassah Hospital. She is survived by her children Irene, David,
Serge, Dan and her two grandchildren, Julia and Sarah.

Subject: pamelekh

If I may correct Mikhl Herzog and Przemek Kasprzyk: It is surely not
"allmaehlich" meaning gradually but rather "gemaechlich" meaning leisurely
which might have turned together with the slavic "pomalu" into the yiddish
"pamelekh", but I believe it is just the german adverbial suffix "-lich". 
Siegmund A. Wolf maintains, the etymology is: Polish "pomalu" and the
Mittelhochdeutsch (medieval high German) "mechliche" with the same meaning.

On the subject of "pamelach" here is a little ditty highlighting one of life's
dilemmas.
ÿÿÿÿ Gay ichÿ gich zureiss ich die schich
ÿÿÿÿÿ Gay ich pamelach bin ich a lemmach

What's a guy to do?

Harriet Murav asked about the Yiddish translation of Gulliver's Travels
[08.022]. I found references to four editions (all seem to be different
translations):

Guliver's vunderbare rayze unter shreklikhe groyse menshen und di merkvirdige
beshraybung iber zayer leben / Nyu York: Ferlag fun Meyer Hinski, 19??.

cm. Tr. by David Moses Hermalin

dear lovers of mame loshn ... 

it's almost a month since i returned from the important world yiddish culture
congress in ashkelon and jerushalem. a lot to digest and think about -- and i
hope that I and others will very soon write you more precisely about the
important subjects that were discussed there. moving talks about the role of
yiddish in the building of the country, the wonderfully rich treasures of
secular yiddish now threatened. 


but most of all, there is one very important problem, that cannot wait for
resolutions, committees, etc. this is the question of the promised knesset
money for yiddish limud in the schools of Israel. 

According to the 1996 Knesset law Yiddish is a national folk language that
must be taught in government schools == 1.5 million shekels have already been
paid for the benefit of Ladino, not a penny for the benefit of Yiddish. and
this holds back the important work of securing the future of Yiddish. and the
yiddish world is silent.We have so many organizations - they can work
together with the Israeli groups. 

for example .. 

there are approxmateley 50,000 members of the national yiddish book center...
wouldn't it be appropriate that they should lend a hand and a voice against
this injustice, and mobilize their influence (through their support-network
in the State of Israel) so that the Knesset should obey its own law as
promised? and so with other organizations -- the yiddish clubs the world
over, yiddish publications, at klezmer festivals, etc. 

1500 mendelyaner can speak out through e-mail, all 3 Forward editions should
alert their readers that things are not what they should be. 

each group has itz own mission, there are conflicts, empire against empire,
but we all must work together so that Yiddish will survive in the Israeli
schools. This is the Jewish land -- in no other land can we demand such
honored status for Yiddish. And the time is now.

Subject: fendl

Bernard Gershen asks about fendel. My grandmother came from Bessarabia and
used fendel for frying pan. I never heard her say rondel. A pot was a top
or tepel.

Tayere Mendelyaner

In reply to Bernard Gershen, we certainly fried fish, etc., in a fendel, and
eggs, including fainkuchen (omelettes) in a fendele (a kleine fendel). That
is in London. My Booba came from Chernike, in Minske Gebernye. I never met a
rondel. 

Yours Norma Brewer

In partial reply to khaver Gershen's query, among Lodzer, (and confirmed by
my dictionary) a frying pan is a "fan." "fendl" is the diminutive form.

My grandmother, who came from Romania, called a saucepan a fendl.ÿ When I was
a small child I thought it was an English word.

Subject: a finstern sawf

My father used this expression like Lash Larue used his whip. In fact, Pop
used his belt better than Lash Larue used his whip. Whether it was a waiter
serving him cold soup, or someone cutting me off on the highway (early Jewish
road rage?), or a business deal of mine gone sour, he would invariably urge
me to "gib ehm a finstern sawf." Of course I know what the phrase meant, but
did it really mean that my father, the tsar's frontier soldier, would have me
administer a dark end to all the offenders who offended him, or whom he saw
as offending his car-driving, business-dealing and waiter-confronting son? 
Did he merely want me to tell them off,but good? Where did upbraiding end and
violence begin? He described his youth as especially violent, fighting the
champions of the goyim as champion of his shtetl, riding shotgun over the Yom
Kippur outdoor feasts on the Lower East Side, acting as doorman/sergeant-at-
arms for the various balls sponsored by the Bund, etc. And he had the scars
to prove it! Are there any other sayings of a similar stripe? I'd like to
hear them. They'll surely awaken other similar memories or this feisty,
fascinating father of mine.

My mother used the Yiddish word shnoz for nose. With a theatrical ending and
a little inventiveness, Durantee could have come up with shnozzola.
