Hint in leynkreiz kmat a birgerkrieg: In "Die Ershte idishe
republic" Sholom Aleichem writes "...hot gemacht a tel fun
undz alemen." Eyner a mitglied hot bemerkt az "tel" iz
cognate with the Tel of Tel-Aviv, the root meaning of the
Hebrew word being mound or ruin. Shouts, hoots, catcalls.
Nobody spoke in his defense, and I was too ignorant to have
an opinion. On arriving home, I consulted M. Weinreich's
History of the Yiddish Language, p. 680 in the Eng. trans.,
and that does look decisive to me, but I thought that it
would make a nice illustration of the immense  resources of
MENDELE if a few of you linguistic mevinim would send in
your opinions for me to take to our group, where any
etymological discussion can turn into warfare.

In re Shlemiel.  At the beginning of the Book of Numbers
[7:36 nm] the prince of the tribe of Simeon is Shelumi-el,
and that comes out in Polish/Galician pronunciation as
Shelimi-el/Shlimi-aal, hence Shlemiel.  Numbers describes
the division of th e twelve tribes into groups of three. In
all but one instance the largest of t he three tribes in
the group was the preeminenttribe in the group, and its
prin ce was therefore the preeminent prince.The exception:
the group containing t he tribe of Simeon.  Although the
tribe of Simeon was the largest, a smaller tribe, that of
Reuven, was the leader.  Since in the popular view, someone
who fai ls to receive an honor that is his due has lost out
and been taken advantage of, Shelumiel > shlemiel becomes a
popular sobriquet for a person who lets himself be taken
advantage of.

yup, in my family too (central yiddish), a kibitzer was a
joker. the verb, however, was usually used for the card
game activity. so 'he's always kibitzing' could mean 'he's
always joking', but it more often meant 'he's always
butting in when you're playing cards'. however, 'he's a
regular kibitzer' only meant 'he's a real joker'.

go figure.

and it predates hyman kaplan--my father's version, which i
first heard over 40 years ago (and which i doubt was new
then) had the shemiel sticking his foot out in a theatre
aisle and the shlimazl tripping over it.

re somebody's (david braun's?) claim (i accidentally
deleted it) that shlemiel/shlimazl are dialect variants of
each other, i find that hard to believe. my family,
strictly central yiddish, had both terms and they were NOT
synonyms. a shlimazl was always an unlucky shlemiel,
whereas a shlemiel could be lucky or not. (they were used
in different situations--something bad had to befall a
shlimazl for him to be called that, whereas a shlemiel had
to do something dumb.) shlemiel had many -- shmendrik,
shmegegi, nar, even khokhem (which i never heard used
non-sarcastically), whereas i can't think of any for
shlemazl. the english translation, for me, would be 'poor
slob' or 'poor bastard', rather than 'fool'.
