Subject: Locating a Yiddish story

I recall reading a story in Yiddish a number of years ago about a man who
carried out a sequence of business deals that amounted to arbitrage. I
think he sold some animal or commodity that he didn't own and then bought
and sold a bunch of items in order to come up with what he needed to
close the original deal. In the end, he made a profit. Perhaps the man
told this story to some others he met on a train, but I'm not sure.

Does anyone know the story and where I can find it? I tried looking at
Sholem Aleichem's railroad stories but didn't see it there.

A sheynem dank,

Subject: Davening

Stimulated by Philologos's Forward article on the origin of the word
"davenen," my nonagenarian uncle Dr. Joseph Liebenson sent me a (snail
mail) note indicating that he thought that the word might be a corruption
of the word "d'avuhen,"  literally, from the fathers (or patriarchs), in
that in Talmud Brachot it is indicated that the "avot" established the
prayers: Abraham establishing shacharit, Isaac establishing mincha, and
Jacob establishing Maariv.

He has since told me that he recently looked up the term "tefilot"
(prayers) in Yehuda David Eisenstein's "Otzar Dinim uMinhagim", and, on
p. 443, Eisenstein says (and I translate) "Today we term the prayers
"davenen", because their source is from the patriarchs (d'avuhen)".

I apologize if this origin has already appeared in mendele; as is done by
the rest of you "chevre," I skim items in which I'm not particularly
interested (but would vote to keep them on, rather than splitting the
list, "rev shames").

Subject: Sholem-Aleykhem's passion for Zhargon

I'm resubmitting a message on this topic because it seems the original
may have been eaten by Unix. [Noyekh: I, too, know nothing about Unix,
but I hear it is a sly trickster.  My computer has also devoured but not
digested an e-mail message or two.  The computer did not need Maalox, but
I did.]

Sholem-Aleykhem wrote many letters to Yakov Dinezon (starting even before
embarking on his massive anthology projects, 1888 and 1889).  In some he
expressed his passionate devotion to Zhargon.  His exuberance bordered on
rash intemperance which perhaps distracted him from attending to
financial danger signals.  It was probably a factor leading to his
bankruptcy in the fall of 1890.  It took time then for his passion to be
rekindled.  (Lucky for us and the world of Yiddish that by 1894 he was
inspired to begin creating Tevye.)

On Dec. 28, 1887 he writes in Yiddish to Dinezon (whom he had not yet met
personally): "I love Zhargon like...  But for what?"  And then complains
to Dinezon about the poor treatment Zhargon was then accorded in Dos
Yidishe Folksblat.  He continues the long letter in Russian in which he
cries out: "I'm crazy for Zhargon, but heed the crazy one who in this
case is sincere, candid and devoted to Zhargon, almost ready for
self-sacrifice."

On Jan. 5, 1888 Sholem-Aleykhem complains again about the editor of Dos
Yidishe Folksblat, exclaiming, "Zhargon is dearer to me than my honor
[russifying it  'gonor']."  He ends the letter, "How painful it is to see
how they slop around the market-place with Zhargon."

Letters cited in an article by Nachman Meisel in _YIVO Bleter_ volume 1,
pages 390 and 394, 1931.

Subject: Galitsianer

In November 1992 there appeared a long article by Leonard Prager
(Vol 2.88) which dealt with three figures: Mordecai Gebirtig,
Ignacy Schiper and Dov Sadan.

Here is part of the covering note:

   Subject: Galitsianer

   Dear Noyekh, I note that there has been a discussion about
   _galitsianer_ in my absence.  You asked me to report on my doings and
   so perhaps I'll start by sending you a copy of the talk I gave in
   Galicia.  This is not for publication yet, but I see no harm in
   excerpting much of the first half that has to do with who Galician
   Jews are and how they and others see them and see Galicia.  I trust
   your judgement here.

Alas, the reliance in the shames' judgement was misplaced.  The job was
botched.  But not to worry.  Mendele's Harold Orbach, in addition to
carrying on a _very_ active professional and intellectual life, seems to
find time to go through back issues and edit them properly.  (If he
weren't a tsadik gomer one could hate him.)

The Orbach version is a) much better and b) complete.  The article itself
is very fine.  Taken together with the fact that the majority of
Mendele's subscribers never saw it the first time around, republication
is in order.  Because of its length it will be issued in three install-
ments.  It will also be placed in the archives as a single file.

And to Leonard Prager and Harold Orbach: a hartsikn yasher koyekh!
