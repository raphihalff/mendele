Vilna Ghetto, July 1942         Manager H. Kruk

Dina Abramowicz is in the process of writing an article about the above
regulations.  (She worked in the Vilna Ghetto library.) Among her
preliminary comments are the following:

The regulations were written in the period of relative lull in the
deportation "actions," a little more than a year before the final
liquidation of the Ghetto, in September 1943.

The regulations reveal the following circumstances:

(1) Crowdedness of the ghetto quarters.  The Reading Room was for both
the children and the adults.  Since the children were the most eager part
of the ghetto readership for obvious reasons, some restrictions had to be
imposed on them, so as not to overwhelm the room.  The regulation of
careful handling was partially directed at them.

(2) Scholars were the privileged group:  They were allowed an
unrestricted number of books, and the emphasis on "quiet" (not talking,
not walking around) was for their sake.  They were also allowed to take
books "home."

(3) The restricted access to the book shelves could be explained by the
fact that the ghetto books were irreplaceable and the books could be used
for other than reading purposes (i.e., as fuel, because of the scarcity
of this commodity in the ghetto).

(4) Regulation no. 2 prohibits bringing one's own books to the reading
room.  This was because certain types of literature, such as communist or
Soviet books were considered dangerous, since the Nazis could make sudden
inspections at any time.

The librarian on duty in the Reading Room was Khaykl Lunski [former
librarian of the Strashun Library -- Z.B.].

Subject: Yiddish Mac software

In addition to Garry Margolis' suggestion of Nisus, there's a shareware
desk accessory called BackEdit that can prepare text in Yiddish for
cut/pasting into such word processing programs as MacWrite and Word.
Using any Hebrew/Yiddish font, BackEdit switches the cursor from
left-right to right-left and back again, permitting insertion of a
Yiddish phrase, sentence or paragraph in the midst of a Roman alphabet
document. It's hardly sophisticated, e.g., when running in right-left
mode, one must use the "return" key as one would on an electric
typewriter at the end of each line. It can do the job, though, on a
non-Nisus-encompassing budget. I'll be glad to provide a copy to the
Warsaw Jewish Historical Institute and additional information to anyone
by phone or fax at 310-473-4323, by mail at 3142 S. Bentley Ave., L.A. CA
90034 or Hershl@aol.com. BackEdit is produced by ZeyDad Software, with
which I'm involved with my eydem dem computer meyvin.
