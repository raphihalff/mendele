Subject: vu iz dos gesele?

Lynda Kraar asks about the lyrics and music to "vu iz dos gesele?" Two 
sets of Yiddish lyrics and one in Russian can be found on the Zemerl Web 
site: zemerl.com. As for the music, I cannot find it in anything I have at 
hand. However, the Zemerl site includes a 3.3 min recording by what sounds 
like the Barry sisters, in Yiddish and English.

Subject: Visotskis tey

Vissotsky was the most popular tea brand in Russia around the 20s. At that 
time, Russian Jews used to say: To whom belongs the tea? Vissotsky! To 
whom belongs the sugar? Brodsky! To whom belongs Russia? Trotsky! The 
Vissotsky family moved to Palestine and Vissotsky Tea is still for sale 
nowadays in Israel.

Subject: Visotkis tey

Felicitas Payk asks about the Yiddish song, "Visotski's Tey."  It's on the 
Klezmer Conservatory Band CD, "A Touch of Klez."  I don't know its origin. 
A poor Jewish woman who sells tea on the streets of Russia laments the 
fate of her son who has been drafted into the tsar's army, while the rich 
can bribe their way out of it.

Subject: Visotskis tey

The only thing I can say about it (I think almost every one knows this) is 
that the most famous tea company in Israel is called Wissotzky. To day it 
manufactures many kinds of tea.  In the beginning it used to produce only 
one brand.

Subject: Vizotsky's Tey

Felicitas Payk asks about the song "Visotskis Tay." I cannot find anything 
about this song or its lyrics, but here's something about "Visotski."

The firm K.W. Wissotzky & Co. was established 157 years ago and soon 
became one of the leading purveyors of tea in the world. Here's a bit from 
their current Web site, www.wtea.com:

"The Wissotzky Tea Company was established in 1849 in Moscow - Russia by 
Klonimus Wolf Wissotzky, and prior to World War I had branches in the main 
East European countries. In 1907 Wissotzky had its Head purchasing office 
in London, then Tea capital of the world, and later became the largest Tea 
Company in the world with plants in Russia, Ukraine and Poland and Tea 
plantations in India and in Ceylon."

More information can be found on the site under "History" and in the 
Encyclopaedia Judaica under the founder's name, but suffice it to say that 
the firm opened a branch in Palestine in 1936 which quickly flourished and 
is still in existence. The USA branch was opened in 1904 and in Canada 
their products were imported by the wholesale grocers, Weidman & Co. of 
Winnipeg, as early as the first decade of the 1900's. One can buy 
"Visotskis Tay" to this very day - my favorite is their "Nana Tea," a 
Mediterranean style of mint flavored black tea!

Subject: Rokhl (Rachel) Luria

Golda Shore asks about Rachel Luria. I have no information about her 
except for what is recorded in the Library of Congress entry for her book, 
Modne Menshen: Tseykhnungen fun A. Abramovits. Luria's dates are given as 
1886-1929, but there no other books recorded by LC under her name. Per the 
LC record, the book contains short stories. Neither Yeshiva U.'s library 
online catalogue nor YIVO's show anything more, but the NYPL has a copy of 
another book of hers on microfilm: Zibn Vayber In Eyner: Dertseylung (New 
York: Farlag "Zweigen," 1925). It is classed as children's literature.

Subject: badkhn


The Budowitz recording Wedding Without a Bride, includes the chanting of 
the badkhn's verses by Majer Bogdanski (he recently passed away), who 
worked as a badkhn in Europe.  See www.budowitz.com for further 
information.  The liner notes provide extensive information about the role 
of the badkhn and many other aspects of 19th century Jewish weddings in 
Poland.  In addition, the old Yiddish movies Der Dybbuk and Yidl Mit'n 
Fidl have scenes featuring badkhnonim chanting.

Subject: online dictionary

I am pleased to announce an online view of a work in progress: a 
Yiddish-English bidirectional dictionary.  You can access it at 
yiddishdictionaryonline.com/beginner.htm.

At either the top or bottom, you may type in a word or phrase.  If you 
type in Yiddish, use YIVO transliteration.  Use the base form (not the 
plural or conjugated form) of nouns, adjectives, and verbs.  So use 
"plimenik", not "plimenikes," "sheyn," not "sheyne," "helf," not "helfn" 
or "untergeholfn."

The output will show both likely matches (with yellow background) and 
unlikely ones (with pink background), along with related words.  It shows 
some morphological information, such as part of speech, gender and 
pluralization(nouns), past participle (verbs), adverbial complements 
(verbs), gradability (adjectives: an adjective is gradable if it has a 
comparative and superlative).

Searching for Yiddish words with Hebraic spelling is harder: you need to 
know my internal representation.  To find, for instance, "sholem," you 
would type "Slm".

I record a few categories along with definitions.  So, type "clothing" or 
"sound" and you will get lists of clothing words and sound words.  I also 
note a few grammatical items (try "indeclinable") and usage (try 
"inadmissable" or "taboo".)

On occasion I indicate where I saw a word; try "Hoffman," "Bergelson", 
"note: V".

As I mentioned, this is a work in progress.  Let me know of any errors you 
find.  I am sure there are lots of mistakes.  This output comes from my 
"master list" that I also use to generate spell-corrector programs and 
rewrite rules (you type "sholem," but it gets converted to 
shin-lamed-vov-shlosmem) that the shraybmashinke uses.

Subject: Opatoshu's "Pundika Retivta"

We have a 24p. booklet (5.5"x7.5") written by Joseph Opatoshu, published 
in Chicago in 1933 by L. M. Stein. It's beautifully bound, with an unusual 
patterned cover, and contains 5 full-page illustrations by E. Glicenstein. 
Our copy is one of the original 200 printed. The book is a fictional tale 
about long ago times at an inn in Caesaria and some Jews who were spending 
a night there.  The title of the book (and the Inn)is the Aramaic words 
"Pundika Retivta," presumably from the Jerusalem Talmud. I would 
appreciate hearing from anyone who has read this book and might understand 
what Opatoshu had in mind when he chose that title and its meaning and 
relevance to the story itself.
