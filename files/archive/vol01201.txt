I wonder if anybody else on the network knows/has opinions
about Wexler's thesis.  Also, I have heard that on the
basis of syntax, modern Hebrew seems to be turning
Indo-european (e.g. the relative lack of usage of smikhut
forms, as opposed to 'x shel y', as in the book of the boy,
in English).

Subject: Introduction

This is my first contribution to this newly discovered
Yiddish list and in response to Noyech's request just
received I shall say a brief word about myself.
 
I am a teacher of computer programming and software here at
the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at NYU where
I have worked since leaving my native England in 1956. I
was born into a Polish-Russian family where Yiddish was the
common tongue although I must say that I have lost most of
my fluency, to my regret. However, I speak fairly fluent
Hebrew being married to a Yemenite who insists on speaking
only Hebrew. By the way, I would like to offer the
following anectode which is absolutely true. My mother of
blessed memory used to use a particular expression when she
became angry with me -- which was quite often. It was: gey
kebetten materi. As a child I had no idea what it meant.
Since my mother died in 1956 I have not heard the
expression at all and in fact it vanished from my
consciousness. You can imagine my shock, a few years ago,
when I made my wife angry (true to my form) and she came at
me with: gey kebetten materi!
 
It transpires that the phrase is so common today in Israel
that even the Yemenites use it constantly when the occasion
demands.
 
What is my current connection with Yiddish? I am an avid
member for the last 4 years of the Workmen's Circle Yiddish
Choir under the direction of Zalman Mlotek. I have to rush
off now because I have a rehearsal to attend. We are perf
orming at the annual Third Seder on April 12 and if you
want to "kvell" more than you have ever kvelled before, I
would suggest you come to this incredible event. It is the
big day of the year for me.
 
Zei gezint,
 
Henry Mullish

Subject: RE:  Mendele Vol 1.200

[Dan Breslauer says:]

	My field, primarily, is "Jewish Thought."  Thus whatever I
	read--in English, Hebrew, French, primarily--gets filtered
	into that.

Is there somewhere a list about exactly that subject? I
like Yiddish, I like Hebrew, but my real interest is
'Jewish Thought' too. Any information wellcome.

From: nmiller@trincc
Subject: Verter

Sholem Aleichem was perhaps more sensitive than his fellow
Yiddishists to the relations between Yiddish and other
languages.  One story ("Vos iz Khanuke?") was actually
rewritten so that the satiric thrust of the first version,
which dealt with Russification, should not be lost on
American Jews who were undergoing the same process with
English.  The last chapters of "Motl Pesi dem Khazen's" are
another example.

But there were other occasions, when no such satiric
intent is evident, yet we find new words where perfectly
good old 'Jewish' words exist.  Take the story "Fun Pesakh
biz Pesakh".  At least twice he refers to the protagonist
Rubinstein's fear that he's going to be hung. But instead
of the time-honored 'tlie' for scaffold, he uses the
Franco-Russian 'eshafot'. This strikes me as odd since
Rubinstein, a small-town watchmaker, is not exactly eyner
fun di veltlikhe. Or, on the other hand, is he?  Maybe
a chess-playing watchmaker is indeed a maskil or loy aleynu
a meshumed?

Would anyone care to do a piece on this?

Noyekh
