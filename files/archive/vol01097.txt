Re vol. 88

How about kartofel purei for mashed potatoes?  That' what
we called it in Riga.

Re vol. 84 (gogel mogel)

In my family it's still a staple for sore throats.  To make
it one needs a sturdy glass, an egg yolk, lots of sugar (a
diabetes special!) and a strong teaspoon with which one
grinds the sugar down until the whole thing becomes a
smooth, creamy, lemon-colored mixture.  Wash it down with
some hot milk or tea and sore throat is almost farshwunden
(gone).

for some reason which escapes me (but which i'm sure mikhl
herzog knows), a bunch of schwa endings become /i/ in
american (not just boston) yiddish--khali, bobi/bubi,
zeydi, i think suki (the thing you sit in on sukes), feygi
(the girl's name), maki (plague), pulki (especially for the
human thigh, for some reason--in my house at least, the
drumstick on a fowl was always pulke)...--but not shmate
(*shmati), tante (*tanti), tshatshke (*tshatshki) (but
maybe tsatski, meaning 'bimbo'?), tate (*tati), moyshe
(*moyshi), shikse (*shiksi)... what's the story, mikhl? (or
anyone else who knows!)

re challah as khali, at christmas time we used to sing:

deck the halls with loaves of khali...

possibly the same thing?: the morning prayer was the
moydi-ani. (stress on the first syllable, of course.)

and two yinglish words that may be influenced by the same
phenomenon: tushy and canary ('evil eye').

on another subject, i just remembered what we called ptsha,
in addition to fisl: farglivets. (i don't think anyone came
up with that one, but i may have missed it.)

Subject: Introduction

Noyekh,
 
I'm a Russian linguist by training. My research is in the
area of colloquial language and conversational analysis. I
teach Russian at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. I've
only recently begun to study Hebrew and was struck by
the way its rebirth has effected Yiddish.
 
If one can believe Cynthia Ozick, though Yiddish held the
Ashkenazic world together for centuries, once Hebrew
became a living language again in Israel, Israelis looked
down on Yiddish as old-fashioned, tainted with the
Diaspora, obsolete. In this country too, Yiddish was
considered the language of immigrants, slightly
embarrassing.
 
I'm fascinated at how Yiddish has survived and what will
become of it without a generation of native speakers,
without a vital Yiddish press, without a writer of the
stature of Isaac Bashevis Singer.
 
As I look at the Soviet Union and see Yeshivas opening up,
anything seems possible. Even  a Yiddish revival.

Subject: An introduction

     By way of introduction, I am Elliot (Eliyahu) Wolk, a
professor emeritus of mathematics at the University of
Connecticut.  I have no scholarly qualifications in
Yiddish, but I have some knowledge of the language from
speaking with my grandparents many years ago.  My interest
in Yiddishkeit has revived in recent years, and in 1990 I
attended the Yiddish week at Mount Holyoke College,
together with our esteemed shames Noyekh.

     Let me make a comment (for what it is worth) about
"sissel bread". In my native town of Springfield,
Massachusetts, it seems to have been called "shissel
bread".  When I asked our local baker why it was so
designated, he replied that it was because it was baked in
a "shissel", a large pan. Eliyahu
