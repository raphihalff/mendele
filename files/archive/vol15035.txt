Subject: Re: megayer zayn

Further to Amitai Halevi's response to Felicitas Payk's question. the
phrases "megayer zayn" and "zikh megayer zayn" are still used by people who
speak Yiddish. Amitai Halevi's usage of "zikh megayer zayn" vs. "megayer
zayn" is also correct, although I have never heard Yiddish speaking people
say "misgayer" when speaking Yiddish.

e.g.:

Der ger hot zikh megayer geven.  (The convert converted (himself).)

Der bezdin hot im megayer geven.  (The beit din converted him.)

a hebrew active voice plus "zayn", but using "hobn" rather than "zayn" as
the past tense auxiliary verb is a common expression in colloquial Yiddish.
Not being a grammarian, I wouldn't venture a guess as to why this is so.

My anecdotal observation has been that religious Jews use this construction
more than secular Jews - perhaps because of their greater familiarity with
Hebrew. My own secularly oriented Yiddish-speaking relatives would have
used other Yiddish expressions in some of the following, whereas my
khsidishe friends  would express them thus:

Zi hot megadel geveyn di shvesters yesoimim. (She raised her sister's
orphans.)  (zi hot gehudevet...)

Er hot in zayn lebn keynmol nisht makhalel shabes geven. (He never profaned
the sabbath in his life.)

Der rebi vil mekhanekh zayn di kinder al derekh ha-Toyre. (The rabbi wants
to educate the children according to the Torah.) (ertsien in'm Toyre-veg)

A bokhur  iz mekadesh a maydl mit a k'dushin-ringl. (A lad marries a girl
with a wedding ring.) Ven a ger iz zikh megayer er zogt tsu az er vet
mekayem zayn di toyre. (When a convert converts, he promises that he will
fulfill the Torah.)

Subject: Folkstimme, E. Falkovich

In Naomi Shepherd's _A Price Below Rubies_, there is a reference to an
American Yiddish periodical called Folkstimme, which was in circulation in
1965. Could anyone advise where copies of this periodical can be found
today? (There were a few periodicals with this or a similar name produced
earlier in the century.)

Also, the particular articles I am interested in are by the linguist and
lexicographer E. Falkovich. Has anyone done any research on him?

Many thanks,

Subject: Re: Zhitlowsky

I published an essay about "Die Ueberfuehrung der religioesen juedischen
Tradition in Poesie und saekulare juedische Nationalkultur bei Chaim
Zhitlowsky" (The transition of Jewish religious tradition into poetry in
Chaim Zhitlowvsky), that might be helpful for Tao-Yee Lau. It appeared in a
book in honour of the 65 birthday of a professor of mine, Felicitas,

Randfiguren: Spinoza-Inspirationen; Festgabe fuer Manfred Walther,
Hannover-Laatzen: Wehrhahn, 2005). It exhibits Zhitlovskys idea of
transition of religion in poetry and his understanding of a secular Jewish
nation based on his Yiddish essays about this issue and a long essay "Der
Sozialismus und die Nationalitaetenfrage" Zhitlowsky wrote in German in
1899. I was interested in the connection between Zhitlowskys ideas and
German philosophy, especially to Johann Gottfried Herder and Karl von
Savigny. Zhitlovsky studied with Prof. Ludwig Stein, a well known professor
for philosophy at his time and was familiar with these figures.

I am interested in him because his idea of defining a nation could be very
fruitful for the actual European discussion on European identity and beside
that I like him as an independent thinking intellectual. Being a nonmarxist
socialist in his times was quite hard!

Subject: Re: Julian Tuwim

Julian Tuwim (1894-1953) was born into an assimilated Jewish family, where
Polish was a spoken language; ? In Yiddish tongue I cannot write because I
do not know it, nor knew it, and had never heard it at home? ? stated the
poet. (Mariusz Urbanek. Tuwim. Wydawnictwo Dolnoslaskie. Wroclaw 2004 , p.
6). According to S. L. Shneiderman, who interviewed the poet for
Literarishe Bletter in Warsaw, "Tuwim spoke enthusiastically about H.
Leivick, whose poems he read in Polish translation, and the Lodz
Polish-Yiddish journal, Miesiecznik Literacki (Literary Monthly). He
expressed his readiness to cooperate in preparing an anthology of Yiddish
poetry in Polish. The project never materialized, however, because of a
lack of interest on the part of the Yiddish writers." (S. L. Shneiderman
Notes for an Autobiography)

I believe _Julian Tuwim far kinder_ /Yidish, Leyb Olitski. Varshe.
Yidish-bukh. 1954 /Tsum dikhters ershtn yortsayt/, has a translation of
Lokomotywa.

The poem was initially translated to Hebrew by Emma Levin-Talmi (1938) and
later by Benjamin Tenenbaum-Tene (1944) and Miriam Yelin (1951). Following
Tuwim's collections for children may also include Lokomotywa: Shimshon
Meltzer Ha-zamir sheyikher lashuv (1959), Arie Khoroshi Adon Tralalon ve-od
ve-od or Gadi Levadi he-khakham mi-kulam (1982) and Szoszana Raczynska
Le-yeladim be-ahava (1987). This information is based on Ryszard Loew.

Subject: Paul Celan Fellowships

CALL FOR APPLICATIONS
Paul Celan Fellowships for Translators 2006

1. Objective
The Institute for Human Sciences (Institut fuer die Wissenschaften vom
Menschen, IWM) invites academics to translate important works in the
humanities or social sciences from an Eastern to a Western European
language, or vice versa, or from one Eastern European language to another.

The division of Europe deeply impaired the East-West reception of
literature and debates in the humanities and social sciences for decades.
The effects are still felt today. The IWM translation program was
established in 1987 to help fill the resulting gaps in the relevant
literature on both sides and thus improve access to and exchange between
formerly isolated cultures. To date, more than 60 translators from 14
countries have been invited to work at the Institute. An overview of
translations published under the auspices of the Paul Celan Program is
available at www.iwm.at/translations.htm.

The program bears the name of the poet and translator Paul Celan, whose
work - perhaps more than any other's in the 20th century - thrives on the
diverstiy of European cultures and also mediates between them.

2. Conditions
Paul Celan Visiting Fellows will be invited to spend three to six months at
the IWM in 2006 to pursue their translation project while working in
residence at the Institute. The fellows will receive a stipend to cover
living expenses, travel, health insurance and incidentals. The IWM will
provide Paul Celan Visiting Fellows with a guest apartment, an office, a
personal computer and access to e-mail and Internet, in-house research
facilities and other relevant sources in Vienna. The fellows will
participate in the scholarly community and activities of the IWM.

Deadline for Application is 22 December 2005 (date of receipt).

Subject: Re: gehakte bankes

It is a rewarding experience to learn new things, and then to have them
reinforced.

I had previously indicated that the concept of 'gehakte bankes' was not
familiar to me. Indeed, when I read the explanation that was offered, it
caused me a raised (i.e. disbelieving) eyebrow.

Well, wouldn't you know, but I am translating the Cieszanow Yizkor Book,
and I come across the following description, relating to someone laid low
with an illness while fleeing 'khappers' from Russian Poland into Austrian
Galicia:

(Forgive my transcription):

Der feldsher hot bafoyln tsu hakn Avrom'n oder hinter zyne oyern tsu
shteln blutaygel, bankes in gortshitze un nokh azelkhe refues.

The range of 'black magic' practiced those days certainly was
extensive................

Subject: Snobbery in Yiddish literature

I'm sure that what I'm about to write has been observed by others, to wit:
Yiddish literature seems to be silent in the matter of snobbery.  Where
Jane Austen and Proust couldn't have put pen to paper if they'd been
forbidden to record the angst of upwardly-mobile strivers (among others)
our Yiddish writers have completely ignored that aspect of things.  We
have, to be sure, plenty of talk about yikhes and literary descriptions of
how affluent Russian and Polish Jews spent their money on German spas,
French tutors (for the daughters mostly) and gold jewelry, but barely a
word about how these things were used in the struggle for social status.

Does this mean that there were no snobs in Yiddishland?  Hard to believe.
A more reasonable interpretation would be that the comedy-of-manners genre
didn't interest most Yiddish readers, and that might be due to the much
larger proportion of poor, rural and working-class people who made up the
Yiddish audience and for whom the snobbery of the affluent was more
revolting than amusing.

It goes without saying that I may be wrong about my "data" (I can think
only of Bergelson and even he is no Thackeray), so I would appreciate being
corrected. Similarly, if there's a better explanation I'd like to see it.
