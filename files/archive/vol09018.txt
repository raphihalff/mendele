Shalom,

My "mehutan", Eli Sommer of Kfar Etzion, himself a descendant of Alsacian
Jews, has pointed me to the website of the Jewish community of Alsace.

Subject: "Kol nidre" on the violin

A colleague interested in the use of musical instruments in Jewish religious
practice is trying to track down a Yiddish story that he vaguely remembers
in which a violinist plays "Kol nidre" in shul.  Can anyone help?  (Since
this may not be of general interest, please reply to me personally.)

Subject: "Voiture de place" 

Jack Gottlieb asks about the "profession" of 'voiture de place' [09.010]:
This is one (older) way of referring to a taxi or hack, so individuals
with this listing were likely cab or hack drivers.  Why they used a
French expression in shtetl directories is another matter, except that in
Poland, things French were quite common and indeed "chic."

Re. Jack Gottlieb's question [09.010]:

Your 1926 directory misspells it. It should read "voiture DE place" and 
it means "hackney, cab". The individuals were cab owners/drivers.

Subject: Lodzher Goniff

Can someone explain to my poor head the discussion in Mendele about 'Lodzher
Goniff'?  As an original Lodzher-speaking child, I always -- as well as my
parents and their landsmen -- have said Lodz with an 'L' sound, that is in
Yiddish and by extension in English. 

But Polish friends and colleagues (especially during one conference in 1990)
continually corrected me, pointing out that in Polish it's Wodz (with a 'W'
sound not an 'L'.)  So if the _Yiddish_ 'Lodzher Goniff' derives from the
Polish sound... does that mean that Polish Jews used the Polish
pronounciation when speaking to Poles and then transposed the sound joke
into Yiddish where it doesn't make sense, unless one knows the Polish?  Most
of the replies seem to be treating the Polish pronounciation as if it were
the same as Yiddish (though Bob Rothstein clearly referred to Jews "speaking
in Polish...").  Or am I missing something here?

Subject: Lodzher gonif

In response to Harold Orbach's follow-up question on the Polish and Yiddish
"l":  Polish used to have (and for a small number of speakers still does
have)  two "l" sounds.  One is represented by the ordinary "l" letter and is
produced with the tip of the tongue touching the ridge behind the upper
teeth (the alveolar ridge).  It is similar to the "l" sound of German or
French.  The "slashed-l" letter (combining "l" or "L" and a shortened
version of "/")  used to represent a sound produced with the back of the
tongue raised toward the palate.  That sound is similar to the Russian "hard
l" and can be approximated by the English "dark l," as in a word like
"full."  For almost all contemporary speakers of Polish, however, the
"slashed-l" letter now represents the sound represented by the English
letter "w," which is why _L/o'dz'_ (with the diacritics written after the
letters for purposes of e-mail) is pronounced approximately [wootsh] (with
apologizes to my fellow linguists for the non-standard, but I hope
transparent, transcription). 
        
I'll leave it to Mikhl Herzog or another specialist to comment on the
varieties of "l" in Yiddish.  I'll point out only that of Tevye's two
potential sons-in-law, one is in Polish "Lejzer" while the other is "Motl/"
(once again the e-mail combination "l/" stands for one Polish letter). 
        
In any case, a Polish-speaking Jew could well use the Yiddish _lodzher
gonif_ as an allusion to the Polish pun _z L/odzi_ 'from Lodz' = _zl/odziej_
'thief,' which works regardless of whether one uses the older of newer
pronunciation of "slashed-l."

Subject: fargin, lefargen

I recently heard an Israeli use the word "mefargen," meaning to hope for the
best for someone.  When I suggested that this might have come from
theYiddish word "farginn," the Israeli, who also spoke Yiddish fluently, was
somewhat surprised at the possible connection.  Do any of our
multi-linguistic Mendlists know if "lefargen" come from the Yiddish
"farginn?"

Subject: Mendele-history

In response to Ellen Prince [09.013]:

Well, the mail.yiddish archives show that Noyekh felt that mail.yiddish was
too flighty and non-serious, and that serious academics wouldn't join a list
that had the stuff I was putting out (which included bad cross-language puns
and Rechnitzer Rejects song transcripts). But I was happy to let Mendele
take flight, and I folded mail.yiddish within a few months; I would never
have been able to put in the time that Noyekh did to nurture the list. 

I still enjoy scanning each issue of Mendele with the knowledge that I had a
part to play in its genesis. Meanwhile, I'm too busy with all my tax
publications (see http://www.davidsherman.ca) to spend a lot of time on
Yiddish. 

But we definitely get to Yidish-vokh every year with the kids (an annual
tradition they've grown up with -- this year will be our eleventh). Maybe
some of the long-time Mendelyaner like Ellen would like to come this year?
