In response to Helene B. Katz's posting Vol. 22.011 March 28, 2013:

Dear Helene,
Since you invite corrections, here are my two suggestions:

First of all, a grammatical mistake:
A yoke throwed off - the past participle of TO THROW is thrown, not throwed.

And, second, regarding your query about
"vi halt men shoyn bay zey",

I would say, "how dear they are to us".

In response to Helene Katz:

Gebirtig's expression "vi halt men shoyn bay zey?" translates (not in rhyme or meter) as
"when is it their turn?" As for klezmorim cutting, that's a humorous comparison of a
tailor's work to that of a musician's. In a bygone era, hipsters "cut a rug."

Subject: "Dray tekhterlekh"

Regarding Helene B. Katz's inquiry about Gebirtig's "Dray tekhterlekh":

This is the version performed by Klara Vaga in the Soviet Union, recorded 1957 and
reissued in my CD anthology Shalom Comrade: Yiddish Music in the Soviet Union
1928-1961 (Schott Wergo SM-1627-2):

Klara Vaga, voice, acc. S. Muradov, piano, /Dray tekhter/ (Three Daughters)

music and text: Mordkhe Gebirtig; 28771/3, recorded 19573:33

/Ven mit mazl, gezunt un lebn/

/S'eltste tekhterl veln mir oysgebn,/

/Veln mir tantsn: hop--hop --/

/Arop an ol fun kop./

/Shpilt, klezmorim, oysgis mit trern,/

/Mir tsvey alte, mir aleyn --/

/Ver kon nokh undz farshteyn?../

/When we marry off our eldest daughter we will dance -- a burden will be lifted.
Klezmorim, play full of life, for our eldest is getting married today. We still have two
girls left, how do we manage their fate? Play klezmorim, you must understand, the whole
world should be happy with us. Only God and the man who has daughters can understand
our joy. When I'll see my second daughter in her wedding dress, and we'll escort her to
the wedding canopy, a burden will be lifted, and I will drink. Play klezmorim,we have to
part, we're giving our second daughter away in joy. We still have the youngest one, how
do we manage her fate? Play klezmorim, for the in-laws,let the poor folks also a have a
nice time once in a while. To marry off a child, and a daughter to boot! When the music
plays for the wedding of my youngest daughter, I will sadly think: the last daughter's also
gone, may her road be paved with happiness. Play klezmorim, seat the bride, they've
taken away all our daughters. How hard it was with three daughters -- it will be worse
without them. Play musicians, pour it out with tears, for the last bed will be vacant
tonight. Just us two old folks, all by ourselves, who can understand us?/(Translation
based on variant in Mlotek 1977: 210-211.)

Subject: "Dray tekhterlekh"

I am responding to Helen B. Katz's inquiry regarding the lyrics of Gebirtig's song "Dray
tekhterlekh."  Although I am surely the least qualified Mendele subscriber to offer a gloss
on Yiddish usage, I am hopeful that my years-long love and devotion to Gebirtig's deeply
moving songs will transcend any academic shortcomings.  Ms. Katz is puzzled about the
line: shpilt klezmorim, heybt on shnaydn! and asks "Why would the klezmorim cut
anything"?  I'm certain that Gebirtig is using the word shnaydn metaphorically and
poetically to indicate the rhythmic back-and-forth motion of the violinist's bow which
sort of resembles a carpenter using his handsawsawing through a wood plank.  She also
wonders what the expression vi halt men shoyn bay zey? means when the lyric refers to
the unmarried daughters. Here the singer is expressing his impatience about the girls still
to marry. Vi halt men shoyn bay zey could be loosely translated as "What's holding
them up"?  Gebirtig's songs often bring a lump to my throat and "Dray Tekhterlekh"
always makes my tears flow.

About the questions posed by Helene B. Katz regarding "Dray tekhterlekh" the meaning
of "vi halt men shoyn bay zey" is "when will I be able to see them under the khupe."
About "shpilt klezmorim, heybt on shnaydn," it is a reference to the fiddler (maybe the
most important instrument in a klezmorim kapelye). This image equates the fiddlestick
motion of a fiddler with that of a butcher cutting meat with his knife. It is a not infrequent
expression in popular Yiddish.

Subject: "Epes"

To Helene Katz:

"Epes" is not the equivalent, is almost the opposite, of "very."  It serves to soften the
adjective, whereas "very" strengthens it. Although neither is an elegant translation, "I
will stand there sort of sad / a bit sad"  would be closer to the sense of the Yiddish. ("vel
ikh epes troyerik shteyn un klern")

Subject: folg mir a derikhgang

Dear Mendelyaners,

Now that I'm in my dotage, certain expressions my father used come fluttering back to
me.  One of these, which I translate as best I can phonetically, is: folg mir a derikhgang.
I mutter this under my breath when my late teenage grandson asks me to do something
that I consider quite complex, but that he, of course, dashes off without hesitation.  I think
the expression literally means 'follow me through this passage, and is meant to be ironic.
Is this a correct interpretation?

Many thanks,
Hershl Bershady
