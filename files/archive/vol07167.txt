Subject: Leo Rosten

Recently, I have read some negative comments on Leo Rosten, including the
enthusiastic remark in 07.156: "Nobody can possibly write a book that's
stupider than Leo Rosten's _The Joys of Yiddish_ !!"  I have read exactly this
book with great delight (I admit, it is more of a beside book than a novel you
read in one go) and subsequently even used it as a source for information and,
most of all, for quotes in academic papers on Yiddishkeyt. Rosten might not be
the most brilliant Yiddishist, but his collection (and, indeed, the appendix)
offer a nice insight into Yiddishkeyt and are, at the same time, a good read
(is this the reason that he is "stupid"? Are we supposed to prefer the
brilliant minds who are able to formulate Yiddish matters without humour and
who take delight in abstractions rather than anecdotes and jokes?).

Subject: bagel linguist

Sometime ago I asked for stories, myths, etc. about a book on bagels that i
am putting together. I am particularly interested in making contact with a
kinquist who might be interesting in working on the linguistic history of
the bagel, and particularly the connection of the East European bagel with,
for example, the Uyghur (NW China) gerda, a bagel-like bread. There are
interesting similarities of the particular oven used, a variety of tandor,
tanur, etc. I have collected quite a bit of material on linguistic origins
that I would be happy to send to any one interested.

Subject: mekayem-psak zayn

I don't remember whether anyone has suggested this before, but I believe that
within talmudic law the most frequent punishment that could be meted out by a
court (aside from monetary settlements in what we would call civil cases)
would have been lashing: malkot/malkoys (malkes if the word's used in
Yiddish). They didn't have prisons.  So from 'carry out a sentence' to 'beat
up' is an easy jump.  Schoolboy slang?

Subject: Why does Russian use G and not H?

Many shtetlekh and towns in Russia have Yiddish names quite different from
their official names.  Sometimes it's a change from the sound of _H_ to that
of _G_ or vice versa.  E.g., Homel-Gomel, Haysin-Gaysin, Bohuslav-Boguslav. 
Similarly, our family name, according to some family members, was sometimes
pronounced Fridghendler in Europe.  Harmonica is Garmonica and Hammock is
Gamak in Russian.  Other familiar words in English with _H_ have a _G_ in
Russian. 

What linguistic principle (if any) does this obey or illustrate?  I am
especially interested in how it affects the sounds and spelling of Yiddish
words (including place names) in the various pronunciation styles of Yiddish.

Subject: shlemiel

In my high school German class, we read a story called (as I recall dimly from
55 years ago) "Peter Schlemiels Wundersame Geschichte" allegedly based on a
folk-legend about a man of that name who lost his shadow. I've always supposed
that the Yiddish word is related to that tale. Enlightenment would be
appreciated.

Subject: transliteratsye

Khosheve Mendelyaner un Mendelyanerkes: 

Hayoys a Mendelyaner hot oysgedrikt dem bager zikh oystsulernen shraybn yidish
in transliteratsye, gib ikh do on- - far di vos viln zikh oyslernen "shraybn
Yidish oyf goyish"dem shlisl tsu klal Yidishe klangen un transliteratsye.
        
A Mendelyaner expressed by E-mail his desire to learn to write Yiddish in
standardized transliteration.  So, I decided that it may help many Mendelyaner
to see the key to Yiddish sounds and transliteration posted here: 

        A is similar to A in FATHER.
        E IS VERY SIMILAR TO E in BET.
        I is between EE in BEET and I in WIN.
        O is similar to OU in BOUGHT.
        U is similar to U in PUT.
        AY is like I in FINE.
        EY is like EI in WEIGH.
        OY is like OY in BOY.
        SH is like S in PLEASURE.
        ZH is pronounced like S in PLEASURE.
        TS corresponds to TS in NUTS.
        DZ sounds like DS in the  English HOLDS.
        TSH corresponds to CH in CHINA.
        DZH sounds like J in JUNGLE.
        H is pronounced like H in HAVE.
        Y is pronounced as Y in YES.
        KH sound (not used in English) is like CH in the German BACH.
        L represents the hard dental sound LL as in FULL (e.g. LUFT) and
the soft palatal        sound L as in LOVE (e.g. BILIG).
        R represents both the lingual (trilled) R and/or theuvular R
        B,D,F,G, K, M, N, P, S, T, V, -- simply speaking  correspond to
the same sounds in      English.

Subject: Yiddish as a secret language

In Mendele Vol 07.162, Diane Wolfthal claims that the hare hunt picture which
appears in hagodes and minhogim-books is a "secret", citing Marc Michael
Epstein. I have not seen Epstein's work, but the hare hunt motif is a "sod far
gants Brod". It is a visual pun on the mnemonic yaknehoz: (1) roshey-teyves
for the order of benedictions when yontef falls on moytse-shabes; (2) wine and
candles for shabes and yontef. The resemblence is not clear from Standard
Yiddish "yog dem hoz; more suggestive is /yug n'hu:z/ or the like, found in
much of Central Yiddish. The pun is very old and probably reflects a Western
Yiddish /yag 'n ho:z/. 

A curious reflection of the image is found in Mendele's 'Di klyatshe':  In the
yubeleum edition, his description of the hero falling into the hands of
Ashmeday includes the following passage: 

"-- oy, bistu a klugitshker, yisrolik? - maxt mit a beyz gelelhterl der 
Ashmeday, oyshtrekndik dabay di hant un vil mix dertapn. 

"ix bin geven vi an ibergeshrokener hoz fun dem ieger, vos yogt zix im 
nox."
 
"an ibergeshrokener hoz fun dem ieger, vos yogt zix im nox" really pushes the
limits of Yiddish syntax. I have not found any other instances of this
construction in other of Mendele's work. Nor do I quite see how the syntax
captures the image. Any suggestions?

Subject: kurve

In Mendele Vol 07.163, Hugh Denman has it that Manaster Ramer is using a
linguistic sledgehammer to crack an etymological nut. Perhaps not. Khaver
Denman himself suggests a H/A origin for kurve, but fails to inform us of a
number of things which would make his suggestion tenable: 

(1) is kurva found in all Slavic languages or just in those which had contact
with Yiddish? If, for instance, Bulgarian also has kurva, what reason would
there be to assume that the form is not ProtoSlavic,other than the lack of a
an IndoEuropean etymology. 

(2) Is the word pronounced /kurve/ in all of E. Yiddish or does Southern
Yiddish have /kirve/, /kerve/ or the like? If the word is pronounced /kurve/
even in most of SY, H/A origin is pretty unlikely.

Subject: Moyshe Pinchevsky

Simkhe Drayer asked about last years of poet and playwright Moyshe Pinchevsky
[07.164].

After leaving Argentina in 1920 Moyshe Pinchevsky lived in Germany, Belgium,
and Romania, and settled in the USSR in 1926, where he lived in Moscow,
Kharkov, and Kiev. 

I don't know if he was arrested in the late 40s, but it is quite likely, since
he (unlike many others who were arrested anyway) was sharply criticized at the
meeting of the Yiddish section of the Soviet Writers Union (quoted from a
letter to Zhdanov published in: War, Holocaust and Stalinism / Ed. Shimon
Redlich, Luxembourg: Harwood Academic Publishers, 1995, p.423):

"The decision of August 14, 1946 by the CC AUCP(B) concerning the magazines
_Zvezda_ and _Leningrad_ was discussed at the Moscow meeting of Soviet Jewish
writers. It was noted in a resolution approved at the meeting that "Soviet
Yiddish literature, though basically sound, has several major shortcomings
from which it must free itself in order better and more successfully to serve
the nation, the Party, and the Soviet homeland." Among the major shortcomings
of Soviet Yiddish literature, the resolution notes, are the prominence of
nationalistic feelings and the pessimistic sentiments displayed by certain
writers. Several works by D. Hofshteyn (the poem "Penicillin"), M. Pinchevsky
(the play "I am waiting") and others were criticized at the meeting for their
lack of ideological content and their decadence." 
 
For those versed in understanding Soviet newspeak the paragraph above sounds
like an unambigous guilty verdict. However, it is possible that Pinchevsky
died in Kiev, since he may have been released by 1955. 

Moyshe Pinchevsky's Soviet period publications include:

Fir poemes. Kharkov: Melukhe-farlag fun Ukraine, 1930
Far kinder. Kharkov: Melukhe-farlag fun Ukraine, 1930
Lider fun tog. Kharkov: Melukhisher natsmindfarlag baym prezidyum fun
Vutsik, 1932
Git dem forhang: Komedye in ayn akt. Kharkov: Melukhisher farlag far di
natsionale minderhaytn in USRR, 1932
Undzere kinder lider. Minsk: Melukhe farlag fun Vaysrusland, 1933
Feygele un Rakele: vi Vevik un Beylke hobn ongehoybn leyenen dem Kinder
fraynd. Varshe: Kinder fraynd, 1935
Eldorado: a pyese-maysele far kinder. Kiev: Melukhe-farlag far di
natsyonale minderheytn in USRR, 1936

Two of his books were translated and published in Russian:

Aistenok: skazki. Moskva: Gos. Izd-vo Det. Lit.-ry, 1959
Doina: stikhi i poemy. Moskva: Sov. pisatel, 1960

His tale "A little stork" was used for a libretto of a children ballet.
