Subject: Yiddish proverbs

> Daniella HarPaz requested a work on Yiddish proverbs.  "Words Like
> Arrows, a Treasury of Yiddish Folk Sayings," compiled by Shirley Kumove,
> ... It is a small paperback.  Warner Books, A Warner Communications Company.

The copy I have is a nice hardbound copy, published by Schocken Books in
New York in 1985.  (Also bears a copyright of University of Toronto Press
1984.)  I believe I've seen it in Judaica stores over the years too.

Subject: What's happening at Oxford?

What exactly is going on at Oxford?  I have heard all kinds of rumors of
wild Yiddish turf-battles.  Does the formation of the Oxford Institute of
Yiddish Studies mean that the world of Yiddish has been enriched?  Or is
this merely an apolitical version of the kind schism that used to cripple
the Jewish left?  If someone could simply summarize what has been going
on at Oxford I would be very grateful.

Subject: Buloff and folktales in Yiddish

Norman Zide asked [4.316] about locating the original Yiddish versions of
several works. As for Joseph Buloff's To the Old Marketplace, a
typescript of the Yiddish version is in Buloff's papers in the YIVO
Archives. I don't believe it was ever published in Yiddish in book form,
but it may have been serialized in the Forverts.

As for Binah Weinreich's Yiddish Folktales, the originals of the material
used in the book are also from several collections in the YIVO Archives.
Binah was, I believe, preparing a Yiddish version of the book with the
original texts. I don't know the status of the project but you could
contact her c/o YIVO to inquire.

Subject: Yiddish originals available

To Neyakh Zide:

Buloff's memoirs were printed in installments in _Di goldene keyt_ a few
years ago (circa 1990-92, perhaps?).  The originals of _Yiddish
Folktales_ which Beatrice Weinreich edited have not appeared in their
original.  If I remember correctly, the YIVO intends/intended to publish
the "YIVO Collection of Yiddish Folktales" in Yiddish, but has not made
good on the plan yet. (Jews often call themselves the "am-haseyfer"
'People of the Book' because of our culture's emphasis on education,
literacy and book knowledge.  I have a new take on the expression,
though:  we're so appreciative of our books because their publication
takes so long that we figure we won't see them in our lifetimes anyway.)

Subject: A tchaynik hakn

Several  posters  to  Mendele  have  done  the  opposite  of  "haking"
tchayniks and  have *seriously*  discussed the origin  of the  term "a
tchaynik hakn".   I just wish to  add that in this  case modern Hebrew
borrowed the  term from  Yiddish.  In  Hebrew it is  used in  the form
"leqashqesh baq'umq'um", which means making  noise (or rattling) in or
with the kettle.   It has essentially the same meaning  as the Yiddish
original.

Subject: "Az der bubbe vot gehat.."

I read with great enjoyment Zellig Bach's dissection of Steven Pinker's
(as corrected) "az di bobe volt gehat beytsim volt zi geven mayn zeyde",
the euphemisms he mentions, and the subsequent correspondence. In my
family, this saying was sanitized even further: "az di bobe iz geven der
zeyde." I never understood why everyone laughed!

A colleague asks me to ask the Mendelenikes the meaning of the word
"talach."
