Subject: Introduction

I have been "lurking" about, enjoying this delightful group. I have been
a bit shy about participating as I am really a novice regarding Yiddish.

My parents were immigrants, and although Yiddish was the first language I
learned to speak, it is only recently that I began to learn to read
Yiddish. You see, it was several years after I myself became a zedeh that
I realized the importance of preserving Yiddish. We grow too soon old,
and too late smart.

I began using "College Yiddish," and did well with it. I then tried to
continue using "Yiddish Tsvay" but found that text to be difficult. It is
heavy on grammar and I'm not quite ready for it. I need intermediate
level material with which to develop my reading skills.

I subscribe to the "Forverts," and that is the level at which I can now
read, though slowly and with a dictionary near at hand. Can anyone
recommend reading material which will help me. My goal is to be able to
read Yiddish novels and essays with ease. I suppose literature written
for young people would be the most helpful.

I support YIVO and the NYBC, and I attend local meetings of the SPY here
in San Diego, California.

A shaynem dank for any and all assistance.

Subject: More on names

Mikhl Herzog mentions the Workmen's Circle in another context.  The
original Yiddish name for that organization is Arbeter Ring, no?  Does
not "Arbeter" translate as "worker?"  Does anyone know why the "Workers'
Circle" was translated as the "Workmen's Circle?" Apparently the original
Yiddish was gender-nonspecific ahead of its time.

Mr. Herzog also submitted a very interesting explanation of "various
principles at work in Yiddish name-pairing."  All of the examples are of
men's names.  Were women's names paired?  If so, could someone give some
examples?  If not, could someone explain why?

Subject: Shmuel-Za[(y)n]vl

Thanks to Mikhl Herzog for the notes on Yiddish name pairings.  Khayem
told me that he thought (and perhaps had read somewhere) that
Zanvl/Zaynvl/ Zavl was derived from Samuel (Samuel--> Zamuel--> Zamwel
--> Zamvel--> Zanvl). It made perfect sense, and we wanted to check
whether it was a common pairing (other than in the case of the one
Shmuel-Zaynvl I was aware of, namely S._Z. Pipe the folklorist), since
that, we figured, would confirm the origin.

Itshe-Meyer was the name of a Hassidic rebbe -- I forget which one, but a
poylisher.  So many poylishe kids were named after him that the name
became associated with poylishe yidn and non-poylishe began calling
poylishe _itshe-mayerlekh_ or _tshmayerlekh_.  (I think these facts, in
addition to the identity of the rebbe, are mentioned in Max Weinreich's
_Geshikhte_ -- I don't have it at hand to check.)

Two pairings which I've come across, which are on the one hand
"justifiable" but on the other hand difficult to understand, are
_Shmuel-Shmelke_ and _Moyshe-Meshl_.  They seem like pairs of Biblical
name + corresponding diminutive form, but neither _Shmelke_ nor _Meshl_
is a predictable diminutive of _Shmuel_ or _Moyshe_, respectively.  Hmm.

Subject: How to market yiddish?

After ten years of struggling, we in South Africa have managed to find a
sponsor willing to promote a part-time regular course in learning Yiddish
-- reading, writing and literature. We have teachers, but now we need
students. There is great indifference to Yiddish here in South Africa,
largely the result of the combined influences of ignorance and Zionist
propaganda of the Ben Gurion type.

I would greatly welcome all advice you can give me on how to answer such
questions as: Why should we study Yiddish? It's a dead, ghetto language
and has nothing to do with the problems of modern Jewry. Why should we
waste our time with Yiddish when Hebrew is the language of the Jewish
people. Why should I study Yiddish rather than Hebrew or French or
German?

If you could suugest the kind of wording I might use on a poster to be
put all round our campuses here, attracting interest and attention, you
would be doing an enormous service for the cause of Yiddish at this end
of the world. If we can't get students (10 minimum) what little interest
there is here in South Africa will die and we will not get a second
chance.

Please write to me either publically or privately -- your assistance will
be most deeply valued as this is truly our one and only chance. Please
help.

I hope this message goes through as this is the second time I'm writing.
Hope you can hear me from South Africa -- and more, please give
generously of advice and guidance.

Johannesburg, South Africa
