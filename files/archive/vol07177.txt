In Toronto's Kensington Market, I once heard a man ask :  <Vos makht a yid>? 
A cheerful shopkeeper replied:  <Gelt fin drek> ("Money out of crap").

Subject: af/oyf & shvel

Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan asks about pronouncing the written prepositon OYF
as AF. I always heard that the 'OYF' pronunciation was an artificial school
creation belonging to no dialect (unless it is a verbal particle as in
'OYFshteyn' which my family pronounced 'UFshteyn') & that the same instructors
teaching 'OYF' would then in natural speech pronounce it as AF, OUF or
whatever according to their native dialect. Maybe I heard wrong... 
  
As for "shvel" (threshhold) it can be either male or female in gender. As a
teenager I taped my great grandmother who was from a shtetl near Bobruysk,
Belarus & born in 1886. She very clearly sings "Volt mayn mame EYFN shvel nit
geshtanen..." ('if my mother were not standing on the threshhold'). Not only
is 'shvel' masculine in her dialect but the preposition OYF is pronounced as
both AF as well as EYF depending on what words surround it, but never ever as
OYF.

Subject: 1. oyf, 2. khokhlish, 3. Ludmir, 4. nasalized vowels, etc.

1. _oyf/af/of/uf/if_ --all spelled "aleph-vov-yud-fey" 

In the "real world", VERY few native speakers say _oyf_, a spelling
pronunciation promoted largely by the Yiddish schools.  The sequence
"aleph-vov-yud-fey" actually covers lexical items with two quite different
functions: 

a) The preposition, as in Standard Yiddish and Northeastern Yiddish _afn
tish_, _af der vant_ . This has the regional variant _of_ (generally in Poland
and the Ukraine), and _ouf_ (as I recall, in the Carpathian area, more or
less). 

b) The verb complement, as in Standard Yiddish and Northeastern Yiddish _shtey
uf_, with regional variants _shtey if_ in neighboring Volhynia, _shtay/shtey
of_ (in Poland and much of the Ukraine), and _ouf_ , again in the Carpathian
area. 

In other words, Standard and Northeastern Yiddish distinguish _af_ and _uf_;
Volhynia distinguishes _af_ from _if_; Poland and much of the Ukraine have
_of_ for both; the Carpathian area has _ouf_ for both. 

Poof!!! No _OYF_!!! (Except, maybe, in a very narrow strip along the
Polish-Lithuanian border.

2. _khokhlish/khakhlatske_: apparently designates dialects of both Ukrainian
and Belorussian.[If I remember correctly, _khokhol_ is a designation for a
Russian soldier. Anybody, please confirm.]

3. Ludmir is in Volhynia, an area in the Northern Ukraine which shares
features of both Northeastern and Southeastern Yiddish. Thus _breyt mit piter_
(not _breyt mit puter_ or _broyt mit piter_).

4. Nasalization is not phonemic in Yiddish. Nasalized vowels are restricted to
the (primarily western part of the) Polish area: _vo~s@s_ 'mustaches' as
opposed to _vonses/vontses_. 

5. _mir/mikh_, _dir/dikh_, _ir/zi_ are generally NOT distinguished in most of
the Northeastern Yiddish area (Litvish). One or the other, usually the
historical dative form _mir/dir/ir_, generally serves both dative and
accusative functions: Thus __ikh gib dos ir_/_ikh hob ir lib_. (CF. universal
dat/accus masculine _im_) 

A similar merger characterizes the articles, as well. Thus, contrary to the
universal Yiddish dat/accus masc. _dem_ which favors the historical dative, we
find a merger in favor of the feminine accusative _di_: _tsu di mame_/_ikh hob
lib di mame_. 

Some unexpected mergers in favor of the feminine dative _der_ occur
sporadically.

From: Kalman Weiser <kiw2@columbia.edu>
Subject: Afn shvel/prounciation of 'oyf'

In response to a recent query about the title of the journal "Afn shvel"  and
the pronunciation of 'oyf': 

Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter of the League for Yiddish and current editor of "Afn
shvel" once explained to me that the journal was founded by Litvakes, in whose
dialect the gender system is far more complicated than in Standard Yiddish
(and the other dialects, I believe).  Briefly, in litvish, "afn shvel" is
correct for the feminine noun "shvel" following this preposition.  An
explanation of the North Eastern Yiddish gender system can be found in Meyer
Wolf's "Yiddish Case and Gender Variation" in Marvin I.  Herzog et al, eds.,
The Field of Yiddish. vol. 3. The Hague:  Mouton & Co., 1969. 

The matter of 'oyf' is somewhat of a polemical one.  Its spelling is inherited
from earlier periods in the language's development despite the pronunciation
'oyf' not being found in any European dialect (as far as I know) of modern
Yiddish.  The spelling pronunciation 'oyf'- instead of 'af,' 'uf,' etc. -
according to region seems to have arisen with the spread of 'literarish
yidish' and the notion that to speak properly is to speak according to the
printed word (shriftbild).  Linguists and pedagogues in Poland, the USSR, and
the USA denounced in the '20s and '30s this phenomenon. A brief discussion
regarding the spelling pronunciations "koym," "bloy," and "groy," as well as
of the feminine suffix "-in" can be found in Schaechter's "Laytish
Mame-loshn."  New York:  League for Yiddish, 1986, p. 303. 

Similarly, Max Weinreich wrote in 1930 [capitals indicate Latin letters in the
original], "Es iz nito keyn eyn gegent vu di prepozitsye zol klingen OYF.  Es
bagegnen zikh shoyn ober yo faln, vu di shraybung iz mashpie oyf der
oysshprakh:  fun gute shiler, oder baym khorgezang, hert men, vos vayter
ofter, di kmoy 'literarishe,' ameratsishe form:  OYFN hoykhn barg, OYFN grinem
barg, aa'v.  Me muz makhn a sof tsu der doziker shprakh-farderbenish durkh
oysleyg, in der tsayt vos keyn shum oysshprakh-motivn barekhtikn nisht di
oyf-shraybung."  (Max Vaynraykh.  "Proyekt fun an eynheytlekhn yidishn
oysleyg," in Der eynheytlekher yidisher oysleyg. Materialn un proyektn tsu der
ortografisher konferents fun yivo.  Ershte zamlung.  Vilne:  YIVO, 1930,
p.39).

The Soviets were able to avoid this problem by introducing a phonetic spelling
of 'oyf' (both as a proposition and verbal prefix).  All this is not meant to
delegitimate the pronunciation OYF today after being so widely heard for years
in Yiddish secular schools in America and whereever else 'literary Yiddish'
was cultivated.  It is merely meant to provide an historical perspective.

From: ROBERT A ROTHSTEIN <rar@slavic.umass.edu>
Subject: manse, ptsha, khokholish, kurve, adar, etc.

[manse]

By way of confirmation of Shaya Mitelman's comments on the borrowing of
Yiddish _manse_ (as _mansa_) into Russian underworld argot (7.157), a
relatively recent dictionary (_Slovar' tiuremno- lagerno-blatnogo zhargona_,
comp. D. S. Baldaev, V. K. Belko and I. M. Isupov, Moscow, 1992) has the
following entries: 

                mansy -- obman, lozh 'deception, untruth'
                kidat'/raskidyvat' mansy -- lgat', obmanyvat' 'to lie,
                 to deceive'
                mansy-shmansy -- obman po sgovoru 'deception by pre-
                 arrangement, plot'.

[ptsha]

Stanley Werbow (7.159) cites the form _kotcheninnye_ used by his wife's
Hungarian-born grandparents to designate what other Yiddish speakers call
_ptsha_.  My Hungarian-Russian dictionary lists the word _kocsonya_, which it
glosses as _studen', _zalivnoe_, _kholodets_, i.e., _ptsha_. 

[yidish vi a sod]

Miki Safadi asks about Yiddish used as a secret language for military or
political purposes [7.159].  While my example doesn't exactly fall into that
category, I recall seeing a photograph of sign on a store on the Lower East
Side in New York that said "closed" in English and "ofn" in Yiddish. 

[smerkotch, shvinyah]

Mel Poretz recalls two terms of abuse, which he spells "smerkotch" and
"shvinyah" (7.164).  Polish _smarkacz_ is a common irreverent way of referring
to a young person, something between 'whippersnapper' and 'snot-nosed kid',
the latter being closer to its literal source in _smarkac'_ 'blow one's nose'. 
Ukrainian has essentially the same word but stressed on the final syllable
rather than on the first, as in Polish. 

Friend Poretz assumes that "shvinyah" is from Russian _svin'ia_; phonetically
it's more like Polish _s'winia_ 'pig;  swine'. 

[Adar]

Two postings referring to Yiddish names of months (Aridoso Parshandoso in
7.164 and David Herskovic in 7.170) are good illustrations of multilingual
play in Yiddish proverbs.  AP's reference to the word _oder_, which can refer
to the month called Adar in English but can also mean 'or; either' recalls the
proverb that plays on that fact as well as the existence of a second month of
_oder_ in leap years: 

                Deroyf zaynen bay yidn do tsey odern --  oder yo oder
                 neyn.
                (That's why Jews have two Adars:  either yes or no.)

DH cites a version of a proverb that Bernstein gives as

                Shvat nye brat, uder nye bruder.
                (Shebat is not a brother, Adar is not a brother.)

_nye_ is Polish _nie_ 'not' and _brat_ is Polish for 'brother'.  (DH's
variant, "Shvat tonye brat..." represents the more standard "X to nie Y.") 
The Yiddish proverb may also be playing on the Polish proverbial expression
_(a)ni swat, (a)ni brat_, literally, 'neither a member of my wedding party nor
my brother,' i.e., 'nobody close to me'.  (Outside of that expression the word
_swat_ now only means 'marriage broker'.) 

Question to dialectologists:  In what Yiddish dialect(s) does the rhyme in the
proverb work, i.e., where is the name of the month pronounced [uder], not
[oder], while the word for brother is pronounced [bruder], not [brider]? 

[khokholish]

Fred Sherman asks about a language called "khokholish"  (7.173).  The term
presumably refers to Ukrainian (or Rusyn).  Russians used the term _khokhol_
'tuft of hair' as a less than respectful term for Ukrainians, some of whom
shaved their heads except for a single tuft of hair.  (Ukrainians responded by
applying the term _katsap_ 'goat' to Russians, supposedly refer- ring to the
full beards worn by Russian Orthodox priests.) 
        
When I was first studying Russian in the late 1950s, my late uncle, who grew
up in Hungary, told me that he could understand some Russian because in the
area in the Carpathians (prewar Carpatho- Russia) where he was born, the local
peasants spoke _po-khokhlovski_. 
                                        
[kurve]

The Polish etymologist Franciszek Sl/awski (in his _Sl/ownik etymologiczny
je,zyka polskiego_) cites as the earliest attestations of the Slavic word 1415
in Polish and 14th century in Czech.  He agrees with Max Vasmer in postulating
a Proto- Slavic form *kury, genitive *kurUve (second vowel a so-called "jer"
or reduced vowel) derived from the word for rooster and meaning 'hen'. This
would be parallel to the forms *svekry, *svekrIve (I = front jer)
'mother-in-law' from *svekrU 'father- in-law.  Vasmer points to a semantic
parallel in French _cocotte_ 'hen' and 'prostitute' from _coq_ 'rooster' and
well as _poule_ 'chicken' and 'prostitute'.  Both linguists doubt that the
Slavic word comes from Germanic, and Sl/awski quotes the opinion of the Czech
linguist Machek that the borrowing went in the opposite direction.

Subject: khokhol

Fred Sherman asks about "khokhol", and i remember my mother and grandmother
using it in no term of endearment. Rather, it seemed to relate to "poyer," or
peasant. It's connotations were also "dumb ox" and similar to "klotz"
(although this is a chunk of wood, it referred to a stupid individual); it was
worse than "grobber yung",
  
Frankly, I haven't found it in my Russian dictionary, but if memory serves me
I believe "khokhol" refers to a farming community.  I won't take any bets,
because I want my first foray into Mendele to be a pleasant one. 
  
I think there's a simple answer to Rhonda B. Friedman's question about
"gutahr". Try the English "catarrh" (cold, cough).

Subject: Leo Rosten

When a staff writer for a newspaper or a TV anchorperson uses Rosten as a
source of information that's one thing - but when a scholar and Yiddish
enthusiast on Mendele does the same thing ["I go back to my Rosten and use him
as a...source of information and quotes..." - Peter Gutmann, Vol 07.173 ] I
begin to feel like the wife in the 1940 movie _Gaslight_ whose husband kept
driving her increasingly insane by constantly telling her that what she sees
with her own eyes is entirely the opposite case.  What I see with my own eyes
throughout _The Joys of Yiddish_  are such abominations as _boarderkeh_,
_opstairsikeh_,  _shmegegge_,  _shnook_,  _cockamamy_,  _shmuck_,  _shnook_
which Rosten says "are already part of everyday English, are rapidly becoming
part of English, or should be part of our noble language."  The latter
assertion is what particularly makes me gag.  But don't get me wrong - for I
must hasten to say that I LOVE Leo Rosten's _The Education of H*Y*M*A*N
K*A*P*L*A*N_.  It's a delightful caper.  But I'm truly puzzled by Yiddish
devotees who heap honors upon Rosten for _Joys_.
