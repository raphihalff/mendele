Subject: Introduction

I'm a  *returning* (don't we love those polite euphemisms!) graduate
student in American Studies at the Univ. of Md. at College Park. Since I
am an African American, my years long self-study of Yiddish has raised a
few eyebrows... I've taken to telling people that my interest in Yiddish
language and culture is a "past-life bleed through"--which raises the
brows even higher!

Now that I'm back in school, I've found a "real" use for my Yiddish (as
if the pleasure of speaking and writing and reading such a wonderfully
expressive language were not real enough!)--my academic interest is in
the culture of the first large Yiddish-speaking communities in the
U.S.--the Jews who lived in New York during the late nineteenth century.

I'm finally in a real Yiddish language class and my teacher is a model of
patience (thank you Dr. Bilik!) with the hodge-podge of mispronounced
phrases and semi-understood grammar rules I've picked up over the years!
So perhaps, someday I will finally realize my ambition to earn those
magic letters after my name...NNY--(Noted Negro Yiddishist)!   :-)

Subject: Introduction

Since I've been lurking on and off for at least six months, it is time I
introduce myself (since others have been brave enough to introduce
themselves...) I am a passive bilingual as far as Yiddish is concerned
but grew up speaking Yiddish and Spanish in Havana (thus I'm a Juban).
Though I attended a Yiddish day school there, I've lost nearly all
speaking ability and answer my father in Spanish when he speaks Yiddish
(as he normally does) to me.  I've thoroughly enjoyed reading Mendele,
though I've a huge backlog at the moment, and perhaps may feel confident
and knowledgeable enou knowledgeable enough in the future to contribute.
Thanks.

Sara Zaidspiner-Leibo

By the way, if anyone on Mendele came from Havana and is in their late
thirties, write and maybe we knew each other and can get re-acquainted.

Subject: Introduction

I am William Wallen of Langhorne, Pa (20 miles north of Philadelphia), a
new member.  I have a general interest in Yidish literature and
Yiddishkeit, and I pose the following riddle to you:

I have in my possession a sterling silver kiddush cup which commemorates
the 40th anniversary of the Ostriner Landsmanschaft in l930. My maternal
grandfather, Isidor Galinsky, came to this country from Ostrin, Lithuania
in l905, and became a shopkeeper in New Brunswick, NJ.  The cup bears an
inscription which I invite imaginative listmembers to decode. There are
four lines on the cup.  Line 2 says, in Yiddish, Ostrin.  Line 3 reads
=40 ANN.=  Line 4 reads =1930=.

Line 1 contains an apparent abbreviation in Yiddish, with the following
letters appearing right to left, each followed by a period:

        Chet
        Mem
        Yud
        Aleph.

This stands for something, but what? I figure that the Chet stands for
=chevra=, but after that I am stumped.

Can anyone guess what these letters stand for?

Subject: Nickname

Dan Leeson's note about his father's hair color, reminds me of a somewhat
similar puzzlement that I've had.

My Grandmother had red hair. They called her Russi, or Rossi, but her
papers listed her name as Rose. I find it hard to believe that her name
was Rose, when she had an older sister named Rose, and a daughter name
Rosa, or Razel. Would Russi be a nickname for redhead?

Subject: Grine Kuzine

Martin Davis recently wrote one version of the ending of "Grine Kuzine"
(and on Columbus Day, yet)! as:

A shlok zol tryfn Columbus's Medina.

I've heard it as:

Brenen zolt Columbus's Medine.

On a Theodore Bikel CD the last line of Grine Kuzine is not
"a shlok soll treffen..."  but
"brenen soll Columbus's medine"
