Subject: Introduction

To be honest, I am not a `newbie'. I have been lurking for about 2 years now,
reading with interest the many articles about mame-loshen, even the
nit-picking ones. It makes me wish that I was on the East Coast, and not out
on the plains of South Dakota, and able to be more exposed to this very vital
part of my heritage (in spite of the attitude of certain factions in Israel
today, who consider Yiddish part of a dead culture). Besides working in the
library, I teach courses in Jewish history and tradition at the college, and
the response to the classes has been most gratifying. This past semester, we
literally had to turn away students for lack of a classroom large enough to
accomodate them. _None_ of the students are Jews, but it amazed me to hear, in
the last weeks of the course, the comfortable use of both Hebrew and Yiddish
by my students in discussing the material under discussion. A beautiful result
of the class -- well worth sharing, and a point to be taken by every
non-observant person, of any faith. Two of my students were Native American
women, who knew little of their culture and none of their language. In a
self-evaluation they wrote as part of the final, both indicated that, as a
result of being exposed to a LIVING tradition of Judaism, they would be making
a concerted effort to learn more of their heritage, and to learn their
`mame-loshen'. Among my community duties is that of Rabbi-without-portfolio
for a _very_ small shul in Aberdeen, South Dakota. Where there were once 35
families, there are now 11, most of whom are thoroughly disinterested in
things Jewish. I doggedly hold services every week, and two families are
semi-regular attendees. Yiddishkeit is minimal -- these are not observant Jews
in the old sense of it, but wonderful people. There is, however, a rich
history of Judaism in this area over the years, particularly in North Dakota.
If anyone wants to know more, contact me privately. A tickler for you -- in
Ashley, N.D., where there are no Jews today, there is a frume cemetary with a
unique charter.

Thanks for being there for me, keeping my Yiddish alive.

Subject: Shmukler

My first association was from Yiddish 'Shmukler' [see Victor Bers' query in
6.001] to German 'Schmuggler' (identical pronunciation), meaning smuggler.

My German etymological dictionary tells me that both German 'schmuggeln' (to
smuggle) and German 'Schmuck' (jewellery) are from the same root. The verb
'schmuecken' originally meant to snuggle up to something (as smugglers did to
the ground as to not be seen), and women would (in)to a dress. The verb, which
today means 'to adorn oneself', was originally used particularly adornment by
garments, and here you have a possible lace connection.

Subject: Dzigan and Schumacher audio/video tapes

I am wondering if anyone could help me by directing me to the appropriate
place in which to aquire audio/video tapes of either both Dzigan & Schumacher
or Dzigan himself.  I heard that a movie called "Undsere Kinder" exists and
would like to know how I could get a copy?

Where can one hunt this down?  Would it be easier to find it in Israel?

Thank you for your help and wishing you all a Gutn Shvues.

Regards

Mazel tov for your fifth birthday.

I have to admit my shameful ignorance  in that were it not for Mendele I would
not have know who Khone Shmeruk was when I watched him receive with others the
Israel Prize.  Just from the looks of it, he is a very distinguished gent.

These days  with the  elections just a  week away, I  have to  ask you please
do desist  from writing  things like  "Un yetst,  nokhamol afn *rehktn* fus".
That is all what we need, khas vesholem.
