Subject: Tsvi Schooler

Another film in which Tsvi Schooler appeared was "Hester Street". He
played the part of the rabbi who presided at the divorce proceedings. I
met Schooler once (at a wedding reception about two years before his
death). He informed me that the call letters WEVD were an acronym for:
Where Every Vun Davens!

Subject: Zvee Scooler

As part of a forthcoming documentary on Yiddish radio called "The Stations
That Spoke Your Language: Yiddish-American Radio 1925-1955", many of Zvee
Scooler's "Grammeister" broadcasts from 1945-1960 are among the over 1,500
broadcasts being preserved and cataloged. It is planned that after the airing
of this documentary on National Public Radio in December of 1995, many of
these rare and wonderful shows will be reissued. Those interested in
following the progress of the research in this fascinating subject can send
their names and address to:

    From:

       Geklibene lider / Y.Y. Shvarts.  Nyu-York : Yidish-Natsyonaler
       Arbeter Farband, 1961.  P. 33.

    Also found in:

       Perl fun der Yidisher Poezie / Yoysef un Khane Mlotek.  Tel-Aviv :
       I.L. Peretz, c1974.  P. 339.

The version chosen by the Mloteks lacks the second stanza of the version
above.  I have no idea whether there are yet other versions. Both books
give it as an untitled poem.  It's not hard to see why it made a deep
impression.

Subject: Farvos s'iz nito keyn royfe af a khof un af a sof

[cf. Vol. 4.195/1]

The question is more: why are there rofes on a veys and a fey.
Obviously, if you get rid of the dagesh in a beys, you need the rofe for
the veys. Despite the convention in Harkavy's trilingual dictionary
(existent elsewhere?), you keep both the dagesh in the pey and add the
rofe on the fey to disambiguate the two as much as possible (in Yiddish;
obviously in Hebrew, there's no problem, since they're allophones of the
same phoneme). For the rare words with a khof or a sof, it's obviously
more elegant to respect previous convention and not add the rofe, since
the absence of a dagesh makes it clear they're not a kof or a tov.  If
there were another letter in Hebrew which could be a p or an f, you
wouldn't want the shtrikhele over the fey... I'm actually making this
more complicated by explaining how I understand it further.  There's no
rofe on a langer fey because you don't need to disambiguate it from an
inexistent langer fey, which would have a dagesh that could get lost.
(Excuse these confused lucubrations of a non-linguist.)

Subject: "Logic" in language; LSA

Yude Rozof: I found what you had to say [Vol. 4.195/1] about Yiddish,
logic, and all that very interesting, although you are a bit hard on us
plumbers who find wonder and importance in  language systems.

Although the field of linguistics takes it for granted that every
language is based on a system, i.e., a grammar, that is not the same as
saying that there are no irregularities, slop around the edges, if you
will. In any event, our recent discussion did not take the Yiddish
_language_ to task for any structural irregularities; rather it considered
questions of the development of ways of _writing_ that language. Indeed,
more narrowly, it started with the matter of a suitable way of writing
Yiddish in roman script. Perhaps our question can be put this way: No
matter what has happened in the evolution of native Yiddish script,
including efforts at standardization thereof, should a roman form of
writing Yiddish, which is needed for certain purposes, be a slavish
rendering, insofar as it is feasible, of Yiddish orthography, or should
it have some other principles that make it clearer and more useful? I
think that is how we got into the topic, which turned out to have certain
complexities that evoked a fair amount of discussion that at least some
of us found interesting. I don't think anyone waxed emotional about it.

Ellen Prince: I hope to be at the meeting of the Linguistic Society of
America in New Orleans, so you can tentatively count on me for a Mendele
gathering.

Subject: Yiddish folk music II

An interesting question was raised concerning western Yiddish folk music.
In fact there doesn't seem to be any. The earliest secular Jewish music
extant seems to be Ladino Romanzas which survived the expulsion from
Spain primerily thanks to the women. The songs were mostly concerned with
love and courtship, the style of music conspicuosly Spanish.

In northern Europe there were a few Jewish minnesingers and minstrels of
note in the 13th century, such as Sueskind von Trimberg in Germany and
Mathieu le Juif in Provence. Their music and texts were rather similar to
those of their goyish contemporaries. Until the 18th century, to the
extent that there was a Yiddish secular folk music, it seemed to be based
on and modeled after the German bardic tales such as the Niebelungenlied
and tales of King Arthur. Particularly popular was a long ode called the
Shmuel Bukh. However true secular folk songs dealing with romantic and
personal topics seems to arisen suddenly in Poland in the 18th century,
and as with the Ladino music, it seems to have been the spontaneous
creation of the women who spoke true mama loshn, rather than the more
sophisticated hebraized Yiddish of the kheder educated men (which seems
to be getting more popular among academicians in recent years). This is
the Yiddish folk music that we mostly know today.

There are a few rare exceptions. One that comes to mind is the German
Jewish folk song "Mein Kind, musst beten" which can be found in Bikel's
book "Folksongs and Footnotes". It probably dates from the turn of the
century. But even with its highly western and Christian influenced music
and text, one portion of the melody employs (rather briefly) the Yiddish
altered phrygian mode. My guess is that that mode was assimilated through
cantorial chant where, by the turn of the century, it became
conspicuously prevalent in central and east European Jewish communities.

For those interested in a more detailed history of Jewish folk music, I
can refer them to a very excellent account in Ruth Rubin's "Voices of a
People."
