Subject: Transportation to Mameloshn 95

The Mameloshn 95 committee has made arrangements with a private bus line
to provide transportation to our Yiddish Immersion weekend at Circle
Lodge, May 26th-29th. The bus will leave from the Workmen's Circle
building, 45 East 33rd street at 2:30pm Friday and will pick up return
passengers at 2:15pm Monday at Circle Lodge. If you should choose to use
this service, it will cost $20.00 each way or $35.00 round trip. If this
is inconvenient, there are other public transportation options available.
Circle Lodge is located just so uth of Poughkeepsie along the Taconic
parkway. Please feel free to contact me about available travel
possibilities.

Subject: Contacts in Poland

As a classical guitarist, I perform programs of Jewish music as a soloist
and with singers. Repertoire includes Yiddish art songs, theater songs,
cantorial music and classics by Maurice Ravel and Dmitri Shostakovich.
This June-July, I will be performing in Berlin and Poland with soprano
Julianna Sabol. We expect to perform at the Krakow festival but would
like to set up additional performances in Poland. We would be grateful
for any suggestions of who to contact.

(For both of us, this will be our first trip to Poland, which is the
country of our family and ancestors.)

Subject: Soviet Yiddish Writers

The best source I know for historical information is Arkady Vaksberg,
Stalin Against the Jews, Knopf, 1994.  Vaksberg is an ex-Soviet lawyer
who had access to formerly secret trial transcripts, KBG archives and so
on.  So his information is more solid than anyone else's that I'm aware
of.  The translation is pretty turgid -- you'll have to plow your way
through.

Subject: Childish play with words

Zellig Bach's comments on and shock at the announcement of the fake ad
for a "Paskin & Rabbis" ice cream parlor are surprising. I recall that in
_The Big Book of Jewish Humor_ there's a spoof _very_ close to
this--perhaps "Paskin & Rabbis" is even plagiarism. I'm surprised that
Zellig was not familiar with this earlier version of an ice cream menu.

0Moshe Waldoks, who's a co-author/co-editor of _The Big Book..._, is a
contributor to this list. He could tell whether this is plagiarism, and I
guess he could also tell us the background of the author of the spoof in
_The Big Book..._ (if this is relevant).
