Subject: Yiddish Culture Club Meldung [for Vos Makht A Yid]

Branch member Mark David spoke recently with Zalman Srebro, Chairman
of the Yiddish Culture Club of Boston, who asked him to pass along
this invitation:

The Yiddish Culture Club of Boston invites members of Branch 2001 to
a lecture in Yiddish by Mitchell Lokiec, writer for the Forverts, on
the subject: The Peace Process in Israel.  The lecture will take
place in Workmen Circle Center, 1762 Beacon Street, Brookine, at
2:00 p.m., on Sunday, November 14, 1993.  The lecture is cosponsored
by the Workmen's Circle.

Mr. Srebro added, "if you would like to become a member, by all
means! Simply send in your name, address, and a check for $15.00
payable to Boston Yiddish Culture Club.  You will then be notified
directly of all future events, and will help us to continue our work
keeping Yiddish culture alive in Boston.  Unfortunately, many of our
members have died in the past two years, and we need new members now
more than ever.  Thank You.  Here is the address: Boston Yiddish
Culture Club, c/o Zalman Srebro, 16 Wade Street, Brighton, MA

Subject: klezmer group

I inadvertently deleted a message from a member of a klezmer group
in Boston who was looking for a vocalist.  Although I am not a
vocalist, I am a memeber of a klezmer group in Lafayette, Indiana
and was interested to see that their group included a mandolin
player.  I am currently trying to learn the mandolin for our klezmer
group (I play keyboard), and would appreciate corresponding with the
individual whom I accidently deleted.  If you would be so kind as to
contact me directly at msavelev@mentor.cc.purdue.edu I would very
much appreciate it.

Subject: a khoylem, a khoylem hot zikh mir gekhoylemt

Wrt the khoylem issue, I might have something to add.  I have
noticed the same things about its realization in the same
communities as Berl Hoberman has.  I think it might be useful to
look at "Revivalist Hebrew", i.e. the language that was being taught
in the Hebrew schools in Europe before WWII, e.g. the Tarbut schools
and the other school systems.  As far as I know, the Modern Israeli
(before it was Israeli) "Sephardic" pronunciation was used in the
1930's in bigger schools such as the Real-Gimnazye in Kovne, while a
decade earlier, schools at least in the shtetlekh were teaching
Ivris Ashkenazis, although with some new twists.

For example, one informant of mine who went to a shtetl Hebrew
school (I mean a Zionist school, not a kheyder) tells of learning
Ivri's beIvri's, so note two things:  the Ashkenazic [s] but the
Modern Israeli/Sephardic stress pattern.  Bialik's stress pattern is
Ashkenazic mamesh.  The kids in this school had the a/o distinction
for komets and pasekh and the tov/sov distinction, but word-final
stressgenerally.  What was going on in the schools of the bigger
cities I in the 1920s I don't know -- have no informants for that
decade in, say, Kovne or Vilne.  Now as for the khoylem, in the
small town scenario (which, I'm sure, extended to some big cities as
well), the khoylem was [oy] for davenen (because that's what the
kids learned in the traditional kheyder, if they went, but in the
Zionist school, it was [ow], just as it is/was taught in Orthodox
English-speaking institutions in America.  In those American
Orthodox institutions where most of life is conducted in English but
in which the Ashkenazic pronunciation is still prevalent and largely
uninfluenced by Modern Israeli Hebrew, the komets is approximately
the vowel sound in English _but_ and the khoylem-vov is the vowel
sound in English _home_.

Bekitser, the people who became the melamdim in the American
Talmud-Torahs and American yeshivas probably came from that middle
stage in which the [oy] was reserved for European davening, [o] was
Palestine Hebrew to which few people had access, and [ow] was what
was assumed to be what Ashkenazic (or Ashkenazic-like) Hebrew should
sound like, if it were to have developed into the regularly spoken
language.  This dialect was spoken for a generation or two, I
figure, but probably only outside Palestine, by the Zionist educate
Eastern Europeans who then taught American children in Talmud Torahs
and yeshivas.

I hope this is somewhat clear, although as I read it over, it might
be difficult to understand.  I can't go back and correct mistakes
easily on this machine... Oh well.
