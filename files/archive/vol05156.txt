Subject: Dissertation help wanted

I want to write my dissertation about some aspect of vernacular Yiddish
use among secular Jews.  However, I am stuck for a burning theoretical
question to answer.  I would greatly appreciate your ideas for intriguing
linguistic (not sociological) issues about current Yiddish language
use/maintenance/shift/loss/trend/change, etc. A groysn dank.

Subject: Filmmaker Eleanor Antin

re: Ted Steinberg's request for information on filmmaker Eleanor Antin
(Vol. 5.152)

Eleanor Antin, born in New York in 1935, originally trained as an
actress, but moved to painting in the 60s.  She entered the arenas of
video and performance art in the early 70s by way of the movement known
as Conceptualism (or conceptual art), and exhibited internationally.  In
New York her work appeared at uptown museums - e.g., she had a one-woman
show at the Museum of Modern Art in 1973 - and at downtown venues such as
The Kitchen.  She began making feature-length films (as distinct from
videos) in the 80s.  She is married to poet and theoretician David Antin,
and has long been in contact with many other writers and poets.

Antin has at times been highly influential as both an artist and teacher,
having been at the University of California, San Diego, for more than
twenty years.  (_The Man Without a World_ was shot on the UC San Diego
campus.)  Her complex development of autobiographical forms certainly
played a formative role in the evolution of performance art, though her
treatment of gender, sexuality, and androgyny, while provocative, has not
been as explicitly polemical as the expressly feminist work of some
others. (I have in mind not only artists of her own generation but of the
subsequent one as well, such as Karen Finley, whose work became one focus
of reaction in the U.S. during the disastrous National Endowment for the
Arts debates of the early 90s.)

Much has been written about her performance art career in art-world
periodical literature as well as in standard histories of the movement.
_The Amazing Decade: Women and Performance Art in America 1970-1980_,
edited by Moira Roth (Los Angeles, 1983), provides especially rich
historical context for an understanding of Antin's development, including
an extensive bibliography of and on Antin herself (up to 1983).

What no internationalist "art-world" source that I know of mentions,
however, is that Antin's mother operated a modest resort hotel in the
Catskills catering to Yiddish-speaking lefty intelligentsia.  Now
_that's_ context, and it should help to understand how she could have so
cannily approached the _Man Without a World_ project.  Antin's knack for
ringing true (no, Mr. Steinberg you're not so gullible) is in no small
part attributable to her sophisticated grasp of both theory and practice
of early 20th-century Eastern European avant-garde theatrical and
cinematic movements, and of their enormous impact on theater in general
and Yiddish art theater in particular.  I can't direct you to precisely
where it appeared, but I know that J. Hoberman, film critic for The
Village Voice and author of the major history _Bridge of Light: Yiddish
Film Between Two Worlds_ (Museum of Modern Art/Schocken Books, 1991), has
written at some length on Antin's "Yiddish film."

Lastly, in the spirit of full disclosure, I should say that I have known
Eleanor Antin for many years, counting her as an important teacher and
major influence on my own work.  I did music for several of her video and
performance projects in the 70s and I worked on _The Man Without a World_
both as post-production consultant and providing live music during the
(silent) shooting of some sequences (i.e., _not_ soundtrack music).  This
last technique, incidentally, is highly authentic: musicians were
frequently employed on silent sets to produce ambience for the actors or,
especially, to unify revelries and get people to dance together, etc.

Subject: hobn/zayn as auxiliary verbs

I think it is simpler to understand the difference if looked at in terms
of verbs of motion and being, on the one hand, and all other verbs on the
other hand, rather than in terms of transitivity. The

examples that Dan Slobin gave become clear from this point of view:

"Viele Leute haben getanzt":  Here "getanzt" is not a verb of motion or
being, therefore it takes "haben".

"Die Kinder sind nach draussen getanzt": Here "getanzt" is, indeed, a
verb of motion, taking the children from one place to another.

"Er ist nach Wien gefahren": Here "gefahren" is a verb of motion, going
from one place to another. Therefore "ist".

"Er hat gut gefahren": Here "gefahren" means "driving" as an activity,
but not going from one place to another. Therefore "hat".

The fact that the same word can be used either as a verb of motion or as
an ordinary activity (nothing to do with transitivity) should not confuse
us.

I understand that there are some German dialects which do not strictly
observe this difference which is strictly observed in standard High
German. It is possible that Yiddish, too, deviates from this German
grammatical standard, at least in some of its dialects. What do the
Yiddish experts say?

As Dan Slobin notes, English used to make this distinction, too, but
that, over the centuries, it has fallen by the wayside. Perhaps it is
falling by the wayside in other languages and dialects, too. After all,
is there really any significant gain in communicative efficiency by
requiring the verbs of motion to use a different auxiliary?  Any comments
from linguists?

Subject: Asch's God of Vengeance

At the Jewish Book Center of The Workmen's Circle we stock a copy of the
play that was translated by professor Joseph Landis. I think that the
collection, "Yiddish Drame in tvantsik Yor hundert" is available at both
the National Yiddish Book Center and CYCO.

Subject: More _farmishn di yoytsres_ and thanks!

Epithet, epitaph--abi gezunt!

Thanks Louis Friedlander. Kind of you to provide an excuse for my
_farmishn di yoytsres_. I probably was tired, but I may also have been in
the mood to hurl some epithets.

_Der iker_, _yagati umatsati_. Better still, _yagati umatsata_ 'I
searched and YOU found'. Sholem Aleichem did, indeed, refer to himself as
a _zhargonist, a shrayber_.

Thanks again.
