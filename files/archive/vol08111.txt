Subject: Y.-M. Shpilreyn

The latest issue of The Mendele Review (Vol. 03.001) is dedicated to
Itche-Meyer Shpilrayn (1891 -19??). Avraham Greenbaum in his article, among
other things, states: "Veynik vos geshribn. Dos do ibergeshribn bikhl iz
zayn eyntsiker publikatsye in bukh form." In reality, er hot take geshribn
zeyer a sakh. 

Yitskhok-Meyer (Isaak Naftulyevich) Shpilreyn (1891-1937) was quite a
prominent Soviet psychologist. Although he published several articles and
the bikhl on Yiddish matters (and even taught a course of Yiddish at the 2nd
Moscow State University in 1922-23), his major contributions were in the
area of industrial psychology. Thus, he founded the first "psychotechnical" 
laboratory in the country (1923), and later (1927) - the Soviet Society for
Psychotechnics and Applied Psychophysiology.  Amongst his works (published
in the book-form) were: Psychotechnics and the Choice of Profession, Moscow,
1924; The Language of a Red Army Soldier, Moscow, 1928;  Applied Psychology.
The Psychology of Labor and Psychotechnics, Moscow, 1930; To The Issue of
Theory of Psychotechnics, Moscow, 1931.

Interestingly, in his article "On Changes of Names and Surnames" (1929),
Shpilreyn noted that changes of surnames from Russian to Jewish in the 1920s
were more common, than the changes from Jewish to Russian; which he
considered to be a sign of fading of anti-Semitism in the USSR.

The fact that he moved "batsaytns" from the Yiddish studies to the more
secure field of industrial psychology (and pedology) did not help him much:
he was arrested in 1935 and executed in 1937.

The name of his sister - Sabina Spielrein (Sabina Nikolayevna Shpilreyn -
Sheftel, 1885-1942) is better known in the West. Her diaries and vast
correspondence with C.G.Jung and S.Freud were found in the late 1970s in
Piaget's archives in Geneva (she was Piaget's analyst and Jung's analysand)
and led to an urgent necessity to revise the existing biographies of Jung
(cf. "Tagebuch einer heimlicher Symmetrie: Sabina Spielrein zwischen Jung
und Freud, 1979; A Secret Symmetry. Sabina Spielrein Between Jung and Freud,
by Aldo Carotenuto, London: Routledge, 1980; New York: Pantheon Books,
1982). She perished with the rest of the Jews of Rostov in 1942. The rest of
the family: Isaak Shpilreyn, biologist Emil Shpilrayn and mathematician Yan
Shpilreyn, - all prominent figures in their respective fields, - were
executed in 1937-38.  Yitskhok-Meyer's nephew - Evald Shpilrayn - is a
notable thermophysicist in Moscow.

Subject: nokhamol gendz

J. Engelhardt asks (8.106) where to find Sholem Aleykhem's reference to
"farvarfn gendz".  It is in one of the _monologn_ and is called "gendz". 
Here are two brief excerpts. 

      farvarfn di gendz, badarf men nor zen, di gendz zoln hobn hodivle,
      dos esn tsu der tsayt un dos trinkn tsu der tsayt.  un vayter
      gornisht.  vorum gendz iz nisht kayn katshkes un nisht kayn oyfes.
      katshkes hobn moyre far pokn, un oyfes--far a tkhoyr (?), un gendz
      badarfn nor esn.  un esn--esn gendz alsding: gendz esn hober, gendz
      esn prose, gendz esn kashe, gendz esn, ikh bet iber ayer koved, nokh
      ergers... a gandz kloybt nisht iber. a gandz shlingt alsding, a
      gandz iz tomid hungerik, vi bay an oreman kinder, lehavdil...

      itser geyt a sedre: farvarfn gendz... az ir vilt, di gendz zoln aykh
      gerotn, zolt ir farvarfn di gendz in'm  a l t n  khoydesh.  got zol
      aykh hitn, ir zolt zikh tsurirn tsu gendz in onhoyb khoydesh, teykef
      nokhn moyled --s'iz an umglik!

Neither of these help answer the question but SA is irresistible.

But there is one phrase early in the monologue that _may_ provide a clue:
"farvarfn di gendz oyfn vinter in shtayg arayn".  Since posting my question
I've been wondering whether "farvarfn" (which bears, incidentally,
interesting though surely superficial similarities to the French \e'carter)
may here have something to do with immobilizing the geese by cooping them up
in order to maximize fat.  Just as a "farvorfn" shtetl means a secluded,
inaccessible place, _perhaps_ farvorfene gendz are geese that have been
taken out of circulation and impounded.  A pure guess.  I don't know whether
this was the practice in eastern Europe or the intention. Possibly it was,
given the great importance of gendzerne shmaltz for peysekh. Anyway, a
retenish.

Subject: a lid

First of all my thanks to the very many replies I had with information about
the lid I asked about. 

It is by Morris Rosenfeld (1862 - 1923) and it has more lines than there
were in my message. The most interesting bit of information I was sent was
that Rosenfeld lost a son at a very young age. I wonder if this poem was
composed after the tragedy since it talks about the child pining after his
father and similarly there is the pain of the father,

ikh kish di bloye eygelekh
zey efen'n zikh - o kind!
zey zeyen mikh, zey zeyen mikh
un shlisn zikh geshvind

I must admit that on hearing the name of the author I checked out my two
volume anthology of yidish poetry by M. Basin purchased from the yidish book
centre (a real treasure!) and there was the poem. 

So in pentinance at unnecessarily troubling the oylem I publish here one of
my favourite poems from the above anthology. 

It is by Avrom M. Sharkansky (1862-1905) and is titled 'vos iz a yid'. 
Believe me folks of all the current debates over what is a Jew I have yet to
hear a definition that comes anywhere close to Mr Sharkansky's. 

vos iz a yid

a betler, a srore
a vorem, a riz
an alte hoyshane
a shtekhender shpiz
a blim un a dorn
a brand a shtik ayz

Subject: Yiddish in the 15-17th centuries

Dear Mendele Makhers

Are there any people out there currently working, or interested in Yiddish
in the 15-17th centuries, early Purim shpiels, and the spread of Yiddish
through the new world diasporas--Americas, Africa, Asia?  I would like to be
in touch.

Subject: pamelekh 

In mendele [8.018] Refoyl Finkl mentioned a few synonyms for 'slow' in
yidish. I wrote to him at the time suggesting another word, 'shtat', to
which he replied that he had never heard of it. 

This surprised me as shtat is nowadays the standard word for slow in frime
communities while pavolye is almost never heard. It is used on its own or
also tsishtat, shtatlekh and tsishtatlekh. 

Vaynraykh doesn't mention it, is it a daytsherism?

Subject: yidishkayt in yidish

The following is a list of Jewish objects and customs that only have a
generic name in yidish and not in loshen koydesh. Others may have others to
add to the list but I leave it to the mevinim to find a connection, if any,
for these practices and items. 

kitl
White apron that is worn by men on yom kiper and at the sayder on
paysekh. It is supposed to resemble either shrouds or the image of
angels.

krishme-laynen
The practice of taking children to read the shema besides a new born boy
on the evening before the bris. The children are then rewarded with
pekelekh.

kvitl
The piece of paper given to a rebe that has written on it the name of
the supplicant and his or her mother's name together with his or her
particular wishes and needs. It is usually accompanied with a pidyen
(redemption money).

mitsve tants
The dance with the kale after the wedding meal

nitl
The practice of not learning toyre on Christmas.

neygl vaser
Water prepared besides the bed by observant Jews to be used to wash the
hands in the morning upon awakening. Although there are impurities
assciated with nails, the impurity that neygl vaser is supposed to rid
one of is to do with the fingers, so whence the name?

oyfruf
The calling to the toyre of a khosen on the week before his marriage

shnodern
The pledging of donations after being called up to the seyfer toyre. The
word is a corruption of the word 'shenodar' meaninng that he pledged.

vakh nakht
The night before the bris when there is a tradition for the father to
host a meal and then to recite certain sections of the zohar late into
the night, hence the word 'vakh'.

yarmulke
skullcap

yortsayt
I believe the Hebrew 'yom hashana' to be a translation of yortsayt as an
anniversary of death in the halokhe is known simply as the day that the
father or mother died.

The following is a list of minhogim (customs) that are derived from ominous
associations with their yidish names. 

To eat carrots on rosh hashone with a prayer that our merits are
increased. meyren is similar to mern.

There are those who do not eat carrots on paysekh as a leavened dough
has increased so meyren are a bad omen.

A minheg to eat on erev yoym kiper a fish known in yidish as koreslekh 
to atone for sins commited which carry the penalty of kores (torn away
from kin?). According to my fishmonger the English name for this fish is
St Petion(?) while his black customers know it as Talapia.

Subject: Mendele in Forverts 

First the good news: Mendele has been featured in Forverts (Y. London, Di
eyropeer khapn oykh a shmues af "Mendele", 1/15/99, z' 10). The bad news is
that the Forverts' author apparently does not like Mendele. Which is OK. 
The sacred human right to dislike Mendele is guaranteed by the constitutions
of most civilized countries. You may ask: How do I know that Y. London does
not like Mendele? It's simple: the only thing he tells his readers about us
(except the subscribers statistics) is that

   di dozike yedies nemen nisht arayn keyn statistik mekoyekh der tematik
   fun di "shmuesn" vos vern gefirt tsvishn di abonentn.  men ken zogn, az
   es dominirn nokh alts etimologishe frages un klots-kashes, oftmol fun aza 
   min vi: "mayn mames shkheyne hot gezogt af a nar 'maleumnik'.  fun vanen
   shtamt ot dos vort un tsi hot es a shaykhes tsu mamelige, vos ikh fleg
   esn bay mayn feter munis frayndine, a profesorshe fun khinezish?" 

It would have been a funny jest, had it been posted to Mendele. However, for
many Forverts readers who are not Mendele subscribers, our list is presented
as a "klots-kashes" place. Which is not true. Statistically and otherwise.

Mendele will not sit idly in the face of such an offence.  We will mobilize
our members with the appropriate geographical names and evaluate a
statistically significant sample of questions from the Forverts' own "Bintel
briv". Then we will report who is more klots-kashedike.
