Subject: Varia: Bintel Brief, Baynks

a) Bintel Brief

With regard to the discussion of Bintel Brief: the American
sociologist W.I. Thomas (1863-1944) planned a compilation and
publication of Bintel Brief from 1922 on.  He was in New York
working on the studies of Americanization with Robert E. Park
(former journalist, amaneunsis for Booker T. Washington, then
sociologist) and met Abraham Cahan with Park.

They met various Jewish leaders and attended the 2nd Avenue
theaters, schmoozed in the restaurants at night, etc.  "Old World
Traits Transplanted" (New York, 1921) was the book dealing with all
immigrant groups in which "types" of immigrant experience were
created using documents as examples.  While pages 195-211 deal with
the Jews, copies of parts of Bintel Breif are quoted on p.7 (1906),
p.44 (1906), p.59 (1914), p.64 (1917), p.65 (1914), p.78 (1906),
p.80 (1906), p.100 (1918), p.200 (1914) [These are all different
Brief of specific dates; in addition there is a large excerpt from a
story by M.J. Olgin from 1917].

Thomas taught himself Yiddish and collected the Bintel Brief for a
separate project, an outcome of the technique of using "natural
documents" especially letters as part of studying the immigration
process of Polish-Americans with Florian Znaniecki. Their major
work, The Polish Peasant in Europe and America, was constructed
around the analysis of letters among family members and also a file
of letters to a newspaper in Poland early in the 20th century.  The
latter, however, was lost in World War I.

As late as 1942 he was still writing in letters that he was working
on this project, translating letters in his files.  Nothing
published ever came from this project before he died.  His papers,
such as they were, were given to the Social Science Research
Committee in New York by his widow and a selection published in
1951.  Sometime after that, a student used his file of Bintel Brief
and published an article on them in either the American Sociogical
Review or the American Journal of Sociology. [I don't have the
reference at hand at the moment.]  Presumably, his file in Yiddish
and the translations remained in the SSRC files; these are now part
of the SSRC archives in New York raising the possibility that
another compilation is extant, perhaps in better form than
photocopies from the Vorwarts.

b) Martin Davis' idiom about 'baynks' is the same as one of my
mother's favorite comments.  But my memory of her yiddish sounds
more like 'bankas' -- translatable as 'cups' -- an old medical
treatment common in Eastern Europe and also in Asiatic medicine.  I
believe that 'cups' were a common form of treatment used by barbers
in the old days before modern medicine was dominated by allopathy.
Indeed, my daughter, who practices acupuncture and "oriental
medicine" in New Mexico uses cups as one form of treatment among
others.  I always wondered what a 'toyten bankas' could mean and
wondered if it was an up-dating and carrying over of the related old
practice of using leaches.  Dead leaches would make more literal
sense than "dead" cups.  The meaning was clear that whatever was
being proposed was useless.

c) My yiddish, as I explained some time back, suffers from non-use
and corruption with German so please excuse my transliteration of
the following, perhaps my mother's favorite idiomatic curse, offered
up at various times, particularly toward antisemitic political
figures:

 "Er zoll zeyn vee a shandeleer; hangen bei tookh
  und brennen bei nakht."

Does anyone else know this and its origin?

Subject: a joke with a little Yiddish geography

A new immigrant-Jewish Agency joke (heard in Hebrew and Yiddish)
goes:

An oleh khadash is unhappy here and goes back to the country he came
from.  But he's unhappy there and so he makes a second aliyah. But
he's still unhappy in Israel, so the Sochnut tells him: "Look, where
do you want to live? Just say where you want and we'll send you
there."  They give him a globe, "Just point to where you'd like to
live." The unhappy new oleh says, "efsher hot ir an andere globus?"

Subject: sayings, phrases

Here are a couple more sayings, doubtlessly prost, that I've pulled
out:

1) tukhes affen tish -- literally, ass on the table, meaning, put up
or shut up.

2) nekhtiger tog (tuhg) -- literally, yesterday's day, meaning,
impossible.

3) sit gevorn mir finster in die oigen -- literally, it became me
darkness in the eyes, meaning, I swooned, became faint.

4) ein sechs und sekhtsig -- literally, a sixty-six, meaning, I
think, a stitch in the side.

5) mir shmekt nisht, si shtinkt nisht -- literally, if one doesn't
smell it, it doesn't stink.

There must be more that 50 yiddish words that are indispensable, no?
