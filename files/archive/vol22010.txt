Subject: death of Joseph Landis

We mourn the passing of Joseph Landis, on Sunday, January 6, 2013. He had served as
the Editor of Yiddish/Modern Jewish Studies since 1975. Joe was a vehement advocate of
Yiddish literature. His many translations (The Dybbuk and Other Great Yiddish Plays,
1966), his personal recollections of the Yiddish world (Memoirs of the Yiddish
Stage, 1984), and his numerous, insightful articles chronicle the growth of Yiddish
literature, its importance and its gradual fading after the second World War. Joe's essays
brought vigor to Yiddish language and literature, and made it accessible to many
American readers. At Queens College, the Yiddish and Jewish Studies Program thrived
under his leadership throughout the nineteen sixties and seventies, in particular with his
Sholem Aleichem Festivals, which attracted many Jewish celebrities and the interest and
participation of the New York Jewish communities.

Subject: Call for MLA Papers: Joseph C. Landis, In Memoriam

The American Association of Professor of Yiddish (AAPY) is soliciting proposals for
MLA papers on topics studied by Joseph C. Landis, the late founder of our association.

His interests included, but were certainly not limited to, An-sky, Asch, Hirschbein,
Leivick, Philip Roth, Isaac Bashevis Singer and Yiddish theater memoirs.

Yiddish sources do not have to be employed, but use of Joe's research or translations
would be very appreciated.

Please send abstracts of 150 to 300 words by March 15 to the AAPY liaison
to the MLA: Alan Astro at aastro@trinity.edu.

FYI: The MLA will take place in Chicago on January 9-12, 2014. We make sure
that our session does not occur on or too close to the Sabbath.

Subject: 16th Symposium for Yiddish Studies in Germany, 16-18 September 2013

The 16th Symposium for Yiddish Studies in Germany will be held 16-18 September 2013
at Trier University. This annual Yiddish Symposium is organized alternately by the
Chairs for Yiddish Studies at the universities of Trier and Dusseldorf and is intended to
offer students and scholars the possibility to present their research, exchange ideas and
put forward questions for discussion.

You are invited to submit abstracts for 20 min. papers until May 1, 2013 to
jiddisch@uni-trier.de. Presentations can be held in Yiddish or German.

As usual, all fields of research within Yiddish Studies will be considered.
Interdisciplinary papers with a connection to Yiddish Studies are welcome.

The symposium is open to all interested in Yiddish Studies.

We are also happy to answer questions.

Marion Aptroot (Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf) and Simon Neuberg (University
of Trier)

Subject: "Der feter flegt gebn tsu farzikhn dos ey"

Hello friends,

In a song about hamavdil, I encountered this phrase, "Der feter flegt gebn tsu farzikhn
(farzukhn) dos ey."

The uncle said it's time to find the eggs? Is this an end-of-Shabbos custom somewhere, or
have I entirely misread this line?

Thanks,
Jane Peppler

[Moderator's note: The southern Yiddish form "farzikhn"  - to try (food) - used by Jane
Peppler is given here in its Standard Yiddish pronunciation: farzukhn.]

Subject: Findjan

Bella Bryks-Klein has brought. Itzhak Luden's reply to the queries concerning the
Yiddish version of Findjan:

As to the question who translated Haim Hefer's song Findjan into Yiddish, I have the
pleasure to inform you that the authorized translator of his song was I, Itzhak Luden. In
1967, Haim Hefer asked me to translate his song.


Ikh hob dem Findjan ibergezetst tsuzamen mit andere lider un a greserer tsol "makames"
vos zenen in zelbn yor glaykh nokh der zeks-tagiker milkhome gevorn aroysgegebn
