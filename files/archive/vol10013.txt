Subject: Lemster's poem

At a lecture given by Boris sandler in the L.A. Yidish Cultue Club about a
month ago he read a piece of a  wonderful poem in which one line was
something like "es shtarbt a shtelele in mir". I would really want to have
a copy of that poem. Niether the Nat. Yid. book center nor the arbeter Ring
Center haver anything by Lemster. Can anyone help? With much appreciation
for your help

Subject: kalye, kalemutne

With reference to Ann Szedlecki's query [10.008:5] re the etymology of
'kalye' and 'kalemutne'. The two words are cognate and of Slav origin. The
ultimate origin is an Indoeuropean root meaning 'mud, filth, excrement'.
Yiddish 'kalye vern' is cognate with Polish 'kale' = 'excrementa' or the
Ukrainian 'kal'aty' = 'to befoul' and thus the literal significance is that
of something becoming dirty of defiled, but is colloquially used to mean
simply 'spoiled, ruined'.

Yiddish 'kalemutne' on the other hand is cognate with the Ukrainian
'kalamutnyy' = 'muddy, turbid' or, in a sense corresponding more closely to
the etymology, 'having, consisting of a muddy sediment'. The Yiddish
innovation appears to be the figurative application to a frame of mind.

Subject: lovitch, kalye, kalamutno

With regards to the several expressions presented by Ann Szedlecki
(10.008), I offer the following:

1. Ich hob dich in lovitch.

A 'lovitch' is some kind of an animal trap, and I suspect that this has the
same general connotation as 'Ich hob dich in bod,' where 'bod' is a 'bath,'
but the sense is exactly the same.

2. Kalle gevorn

This comes from the Russian word, 'kalyik' meaning a cripple. Hence the
sense being described.

3. 's'Iz mir kalamutno

This sounds familiar to me, but I can't put my finger on it. I am reminded
of the expression, 's'Iz mir Umetig,' which has a similar meaning. I think
it comes from the German, Ummutig. I wouldn't be surprised if the slavism,
'kalamutno' is a hybrid of a German root inside a Russian word frame. This
is just a guess.

Subject: nagan(er) and pistoyl

With reference to Martin Cohen's query [10.006:9] re the etymology of
'nagan(er)', the explanation is quite simple. Both the Polish and Russian
words 'nagan' designate a type of seven-chambred revolver that was produced
from the end of the 19th century until the Second World War by the Belgian
armaments manufacturer Naguan Freres which supplied both the Tsarist army
and the Polish inter-war forces with such weapons.

Martin Cohen writes that 'pistoyl' is of Polish origin. However, with
respect, the vocalism of the word makes it clear that it must have been
borrowed from Early New High (or perhaps Low) German soon after the
appearance of such weapons in Central Europe (15th century) while the 'o' >
'oy' (cf. 'rot' > 'royt') mechanism was still productive. Polish 'pistol'
has only numismatic significance and Polish 'pistolet' would have had a
different outcome in Yiddish.

Subject: nagan

According to the Smirnitsky-Müller Russian-English Dictionary (sixth
edition, Dutton, 1959), "nagan" is Russian for a Nagant revolver
(1892-1945, invented by Belgian gunmaker Leon Nagant, and adopted by
Russian and Polish armies and various police forces. See
http://www.voicenet.com/~danz/MN/nagant1.htm).

[Martin Cohen (10.006) asks:]

    If Rubin's explanation is correct, does that mean that there was no
    Yiddish word for pistol that would have been understood by Yiddish
    speakers from diverse parts of Europe?

Weinreich gives for English "gun" Yiddish pistoyl, for "pistol" pistoyl and
nagan, and for "revolver" revolver.

The non-existence of a native Yiddish word for something that
Yiddish-speaking Jews had no use for in normal life does not surprise me.

Subject: translation

Translation, the Mendele agenda of the week (TMR and Bontshe Shvayg), still
appears to evoke impassioned responses. I wonder if these calls for
accuracy and precision are a means for honoring only the Yiddish original?

Beyond the compulsive cry for exactitude, I remember, and want to note, the
anti-translation era of the secular Jew. When a parent asked our beloved
shula teacher, Yankl Blank, to respond in English, he answered
idealistically and passionately, "A ki git bloyz milkh; oyb men vil fleysh
muz men es derhargenen." (A cow gives only milk; if you want meat, you must
slaughter it.) The survival of Yiddish then was to speak, read, write
Yiddish!

More realistically, today translation enjoys a new look as one of the means
of  perpetuations of Yiddishkayt. (Was this spear-headed by the power we
handed to the National Yiddish Book Center?). Even Sholem Aleichem, in his
will, leaves the wish that on his yortsayt his works be read _in any
language_ of the land and the time. He also gave his son-in-law, B.Z.
Goldberg, free reign in his Hebrew translations. Goldberg took this
unconditional right and even made harsh changes in the master's works.

Yet, in talented, thoughtful hands there is much pleasure to be found in
translations (yes, especially when accompanied by the original): Ruth
Whitman's anthology, Penguin's book of modern verse, Cucumbers and Plums.

And some translators (writers themselves) have a great sense and
sensibility of word and syntax: John Hollander, Cynthia Ozick, Joachim
Neugroschel, Hillel Halkin, Curt Leviant. Because of them, I have shared
much beauty with bright, literary friends who are Yiddish handicapped.

It has been said that reading a translation is like being kissed through
gauze. But gauze can be woven of royal silk too.

And isn't a kiss through gauze still a kiss? and dos iz avade asakh beser,
azoy fil beser, vi gornisht....

Subject: Sholem Asch

Sheva Zucker seeks information about Sholem Asch's "God of Vengeance":

Translations - 1996 - A work to make us all proud was the translation by
Joachim Neugroschel (he's a Mendelist) in the winter 1996 issue of _The
Pakn Treger_, the magazine of The National Book Center. This outstanding
issue includes masterful photographs from the original presentation,
background history of cops and court actions, how Peretz told Asch to burn
the play, and an enlightening article by Neugroschel about the art of
translation.

1999 - It was staged off-off Broadway (on 8th Avenue and 42 Street in a
closed-down Burlesque theatre) and translated by blonde and Irish Caraid
O'Brien, who studied Yiddish and desires to serve it.

The Conference at Yale, as reported in the Forverts, was _Sholem Asch: a
Nayer Opshatz_. I found it of great interest to read that Dan Miron named
East River as Asch's greatest work.

I look forward to reading Sheva's synthesis of facts about this important,
beleaguered Yiddish writer.

Subject: amol

Tayere Mendelyaner,

Some remarks about amol(ik) - Mendele Vol10, nr 6

The word 'almol'(almolt) comes from mhd 'alle mal' means always.

The word 'amol' comes from 'ein mal' and means: formerly, once, once upon a
time. The word 'ein' has changed to 'a', what is not unusual in german
dialects p.e. ein tish/a tish, ein bisl/abisl, ein mal/amol.

amolik means: formerly, once; occasionally, rarely, forgone, obsolete, of
times past.

Zayt gezunt,

Jan Jonk

Dear friends,

A while ago, I came upon a website which shows the weather in the US (and
elsewhere). Many languages are listed in case you want to read the info in
another language, but Yiddish was missing. So I volunteered to prepare the
applicable translations, in order that Yiddish will also appear as one of
the available languages. And here it is. The first step was to make it
available as a transliterated text. In the near future, I hope to have the
texts appear in Yiddish (i.e. hebrew alphabet) - I may need some help with
this.

Let me know what you think. If someone would like to improve on the terms -
please do so, and contact me or the webmaster.

By the way, most of the tranlations are OK, in my opinion, but one of the
key words gave me a bit of a problem "FORECAST" - which I translated as
"FOROYSZOG" - does anyone have a better translation?

Please see the followwing website. - May the sun always shine for you. zet
