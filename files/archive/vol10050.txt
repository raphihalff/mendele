(English version)

Dear Yiddish Lovers at Mendele,

Are you aware that you can listen to excerpts of our Yiddish programs at
SBS Radio Melbourne on the Internet??  If you do, great, and if you don't
you will no doubt be interested in conversations in Yiddish and English
with personalities such as Prof Yehuda Bauer; Prof Eugene Orenstein;
Aaron Zable; Dr Dovid Ringelblum; Prof Rafoyl Finkel; Chava Alberstein;
Dudu Fisher, Arieh Braun, Moishe Shulhof, Avram Fried, Rafoyl Golvasser
and others in the world of Jewish/Yiddish affairs and entertainment.  
You can also hear weekly reports from Israel by Adam Gruzman in Yiddish
and Gideon Remez in English, and about the weekly parsha in Yiddish with
Rabbi S Rutzki.  If you don't know how to go about it (Yiddish idiom:
"How does the cat cross the water?"), then listen:- First of all open the
internet browser to http://www.sbs.com.au/radio/radio_set.html

Once there find "Yiddish" on the drop menu which begins with "Radio
news-mp3", and click on the word Yiddish at the end of the list.  This
takes you to the Yiddish page and a list of audio segments.  Click on
chosen listing or scroll down to it and click on "Click for Audio" under
that item's description.  ("High speed is usually faster...he, he...)  
If that doesn't do anything, (Yiddish idiom c.f.: "It lays six feet
under") or/ but takes forever (Yiddish idiom:"A year and a day") then
perhaps your "mp3 player" is not switched on.

If so then here goes:- Amongst cour computer programs you should find one
called "Windows Media Player".  Click and open it.  Then find on the drop
menu headings "View" and click on it.  In that drop menu find and click
on "Options".  In this new box click on "Formats".  Amongst the list with
tick boxes next to them find "MP3 Format Sound" and if there is no tick
in the box next to it, click the box to get a tick.  Now click on "Apply"
&/ "OK" and it should close it. Now go back to the Yiddish SBS site and
click on "Click for Audio" and it should open the "Windows Media Player",
and start playing by itself quite quickly.  Well, after that much
clicking (Yiddish/English idiom: "kvetching"/squeezing....) you must have
a rest. Make yourself a hot drink and hopefully you can hear the segment.  
So, listen and relax.  And if all that above didn't help,(Yiddish idiom:
"Helps like suction cups to a dead person")  tell me or the computer
don't bother me (Yidish idiom: "Don't bang my kettle"), or throw it out,
because as we know an old computer is worth peanuts (Yiddish idiom:
"Malaria, patties and a blown egg") and listen to the radio instead (in
Australia only I'm afraid...)  I'm joking really, and then again, perhaps
not.  So, try it out and have a happy Purim,

Regards, 
Alex Dafner

Subject: Megile of Itsik Manger

The lines quoted by Lori Cahan-Simon [10.046] open the very playful and
pondering _Di Megile fun Itsik Manger_ (that Yiddish poet unique and
extraordinaire). Add toe-tapping music by Dov Seltzer, and performances
by the wonderful Bursteins - Peysakhke, Motele (today known as Mike) and
Lillian Lux, and its sweet, seductive sounds and story become an
outstanding experience, a mekhaye a tife!

It made the rounds in the 60s as a vinyl LP, but now yoiu can enjoy a
modern, clear, unscratchy, well=packaged Israeli CD which I purchased
online (no sweat) from Mark David (http://store.yv.org) which helps
support Boston Yiddish Radio.

It is packaged as "two original classic albums on two CD", the second
being _Fiddler Oyfn Dakh_ in Yiddish! You will be convinced that the
original Fiddler was written in mameloshn, it flows so gently and
smoothly.

Buy it! Support these wonderful things! You'll enjoy it and share it
often!

Subject: Megile of Itsik Manger

"Zayt zhe yidn sha un shtil" is the introductory song to Itsik Manger's
book "Megile lider" (1936), a collection of poems and ballads in the
style of an ancient Purimshpil transposed in a polish shtetl and
performed by a group of taylor-apprentices.

It has recently been re-edited in CD-form an old CBS record of the
seventies in which Manger's "Megile lider" have been put in music by Dov
Seltzer and sung by The Bursteins (20386, 1999 NMC, Israel). On occasion
of Manger's centenary (1901-1969), an Italian yiddish theater company
performed the "Megile lider" (texts in Italian and songs in Yiddish) in
Fiesole (Florence) under the direction of the very fine Italian-Polish
actor and director Olek Mincer and staging Enrico Fink. I hope others in
the world will follow the Italian example and not forget to perform
Manger's play in this Purim period of his centenary.

"Nor Khane-Dvoyre, di tokhter
shteyt baym fentster un trakht:
vifl shtern, a shteyger,
farmogt aza Purim-nakht?"

Subject: Megile of Itsik Manger

This is the opening song of Itzik Manger's Megileh Lieder. It has many
more verses. The edition I have was published in Israel by Amikam, in
1967. It carries the following inscription: published on the presentation
of Megileh Lieder by the Chamam Theatre in Israel."  It first appeared in
1936 in Warsaw. I believe that the music was provided by Dubie Seltzer.
The entire series is available in a cassette or a cd. The leading role
was played by Mike Burstein.

Subject: Megile of Itsik Manger

The "song" Lori Cahan-Simon is seeking isn't really a song at all, but
part of the introduction to "di megile fun itsik manger" (Itsik Manger's
Megile), a rousing, wonderful musical with music by Dov Seltzer. (The
original cast recording has recently been re-released in a CD set that
also includes the Yiddish version of "Fiddler on the Roof.") The staged
production was based on Manger's "megile lider," first published in
Warsaw in 1936, and as part of "Medrish Itsik," published by the Yiddish
Department at Hebrew University in 1969 and 1984, with introductory
essays by Dov Sadan and Chone Shmeruk. Manger entitled the poem that
became the curtain-raiser "dos lid funem loyfer," (The Song of the
Herald.)

Following the sung verses Lori quoted (music published in "Die Megille,"
in Dresden, in conjunction with a production in that German city in 1998)
is a series of sing-song couplets introducing the play's characters.

Both the CD and the lovely German book with the music for most of the
songs are available, I believe, from the Arbeter Ring/Workmen's Circle
bookstore.

Following is the transcribed Yiddish text of the opening number and my
English translation, as it appears in a booklet published by Yiddishkayt
L.A. with Manger's verses in Yiddish (not transcribed).

zayt-zhe yidn sha un shtil!
mir fangen on dem purim-shpil.

a purim-shpil in gramen,
vos hot toyznt tamen.

ver s'vet es leynen,
vet vi a biber veynen.

un ver s'vet es hern,

ot geyen zey ale shtile,
di heldn fun der megile:

akhashveyrosh der keynig,
vos vifil er trinkt iz im veynik.

ester hamalke, di grine,
un vashti in der krinoline.

mordkhe der khokhem atik
un homen haroshe, der latik.

zeyresh di makh'sheyfe,
vos shelt vi a mageyfe.

vayzusu der redakter,

un tsvishn di ale groyse layt

hakitser, di ale zakhn,
oyf tsum veynen un tsum lakhn,
un oyb ikh zog aykh a lign...

The Song of the Herald

Hear now, Jews, be quiet and still!
We're starting up the Purim shpil.

A shpil in rhyme and graces,
Cast with a thousand faces.

Who reads it by eye
Will, like a beaver, cry.

And those who use their ears
Will laugh through their tears.

And here they all come still...eh:
The heroes of the megile:

Akhashveyrosh, the king,
Who can't get enough to drink:

Queenie Ester, the "virgin,"
And Vashti, dressed in crinoline;

Mordkhe, the ancient wise one,
And evil Haman, the despised one;

Zeyresh, in witch's attire,
Curses like a forest fire;

Vayzusu, the editor, who
Is boring to me and you;

And among all these folks of pride
Phastrigossa stands aside.

He himself will tell you all
Why his life's more bitter than gall.

In short, each and every thing
For to cry and for to sing -
And if you think it'll all be crap:
Just listen...and shut your trap!

(Translation copyright 1980-1998  Hershl Hartman)

Subject: vi got in odes/ades

In response to "odes or ades" question:

It may have been truncated to make it more yidish morphologically. Odessa
(with stress on e) is both in Ukrainian and Russian femininum. It would
be more natural the form Odesse (like broche from bracha, kehile, kopeke,
Lite, mame, mishne) but, as I have seen, some yiddish dialects omit the
final e. So it is my explanation,

Subject: Yiddish and Jerusalem Post

To Mendele,

I wrote a letter to the Jerusalem Post objecting to their use of Yahrzeit
as a mongrelization, and was told that that is the accepted spelling.
Yortsayt is not considered proper. I find "yahrzeit" all over and wonder
if anything can be done about correcting it.

Here in Israel one encounters the word "branja" occasionally to mean "the
in crowd." I was told it was Yiddish, but it does not sound Yiddish to
me. Does anyone know the word's origin.

Last week the Jerusalem Post Magazine featured Yiddish with quite a few
errors in the articles. I wrote, byt my letter was ignored.

Subject: Yiddish and Disney

In September I wrote and asked for suggestions on how to respond to the
mistaken reference to Shaina as a name of Hebrew origin on the Disney
website.  A few chaverim responded with their thoughts, including address
information.  Briefly, so as not to make a big megile out of it, I wrote
to Michael Eisner, Chairman and CEO, and copied Steven Bornstein,
Chairman of the Walt Disney Internet Group and Ken Goldstein, Executive
Vice-President and Managing Director of Disney Online Inc. I received a
reply in February from Emily Smith, Editor in Chief, Family.com.

She refers to three names because I also brought to Mr. Eisner's
attention that both Hershel and Haskel were similarly referred to as
names of Hebrew origin.

Ms Smith replied as follows:

We received you second letter to Mr. Eisner dated January 1, 2001.  
Thank you for taking such an interest in our website.  Attached is the
previous response that Sally Jones wrote to you.  In that letter she
explained the reasoning that went into our categorization of the name
Shaina.

As you know, the name Shaina is derived from a German word.  Yet its use
as a name is distinctly Yiddish.  Because at this point we do not have a
Yiddish category and because Yiddish is written using the Hebrew
alphabet, we initially put the name in our Hebrew category.  Because you
were offended by this compromise, we opted to remove the name from the
database.

We in no way meant to diminish, trivialize, or erase your personal or
cultural history.  We are constantly updating our site so that it is
accurate and are grateful to you for pointing out some of our errors.
Because we do not currently have the resources to create a Yiddish
category in the Baby Name Finder, we will remove all three Yiddish names
that are misclassified as Hebrew names from our database no later than
March 1, 2001. As you know, not every name or categorizationis in the
Baby Name Finder yet. In the future we hope that our Baby Name Finder
includes many more names and anguage categories".

All three names were indeed removed.

Es iz tsum lachen, nor nisht in gansen.  Zeit mir alle gezunt!
