Subject: Mendele mit yidishe oysyes

I join with B. Berman (14.002) in asking:  why can't we have messages posted
in real Yiddish instead of Romanized versions ? I have discussed this with
Noyekh, and he demonstrated feasibility by sending me an email message in
beautiful Yiddish without resorting to making it an attachment.

Subject: Mendele mit yidishe oysyes

I am writing in support of B. Berman's interest in the possibility of
sending the Yiddish postings in the Hebrew alphabet.  As a middle-aged
student who has just begun completed one year of Yiddish study, such a
change would be very helpful.  I tend currently to sound out the postings
and then close my eyes and repeat them.  In this way I try to determine what
is being written from the sounds I'm creating since the transliterations
often make me feel like I'm learning a third language.

I do appreciate very much the materials that are posted on Mendele and
suspect that this question has likely been raised before.  I would be
interested in hearing other people's thoughts.

Subject: Henry Gerro

Khaveyrim,

I am looking for biographical information on the Yiddish theatre actor,
composer and singer Henry Gerro. He was married to Rosita Londner and often
performed in duo partnerships with her and with Shifra Lerer. I haven't yet
checked in the Leksikon.

Can anyone help? A dank in foroys!

Subject: Dartmouth Jewish Sound Archive

First I would like to thank all who responded to my request for recorded
material.  Through a very fortunate coincidence I was able to pickup a set
of records this weekend in the Boston area (Thank you again Fred Kotler) and
have received several emails regarding the Dartmouth Jewish Sound Archive.

In this regard, I would like to post the following information since I had
several inquiries about the DJSA.

The current policy regarding access to the Archive is based on
recommendations from College Counsel and stem from concerns about violating
copyright ownership. Given that a significant portion of the material
already in the archive or to be transferred to it is sufficiently old that
copyrights may have lapsed, we are planning to make such material accessible
to all.  Regrettably, at this time we do not have the manpower to verify
copyrights and so for the time being, the DJSA is accessible only to
Dartmouth students and faculty and external users involved in scholarly work
upon request.  Non-authorized users can still view the scans and browse the
catalogue, they will not be able to stream the audio contents.

Thank you again to all who expressed an interest,

Alex Hartov

Subject: yarmulke

Tayere khaveyrim,

My colleagues and I on the Yiddish teachers list at yahoo groups are
discussing the origins of the word yarmulke.  Both Polish and Aramaic
origins have been suggested, but no definitive answers yet.  Can anyone
clarify for us?

By the way, if you are a Yiddish teacher we'd love to have you join us
at:
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/yiddishteachers/
or
yiddishteachers-subscribe@yahoogroups.com

a dank,

Lori Cahan-Simon

Subject: penkes

I talked today with my mother, who said she was cleaning a chicken for
shabbes dinner. I knew she had bought chicken parts, so I asked why she had
to clean it. She said she needed to take off the "penkes" and it was taking
her a long time to do. This was an unfamiliar word to me, and she said
penkes are what is left after the chicken feathers have allegedly been
cleaned by the butcher. She says my grandmother, from Bessarabia, always
used that word. I couldn't find it in Weinreich, so I looked at the Mendele
archives. Gilad Gevaryahu asked the same question in 1996 (vol. 5.312),
spelling it "pinkes" and apparently getting no reply. However, I did find
"penke" in the 1898 edition of Harkavy, defined as the "stump of a feather".
On the etymology of penkes, it turns out that " pen' " in Russian means
stub. So "penke" looks like a Yiddish version of a Russian diminutive.
Mystery solved!

Subject: gret

I wonder if one of Mendele's philologists can give me an etymology for the
word "gret"? It is a common word, although not as common as "vesh", and
strangely enough, while it appears in Weinreich and Winocur, it does not
appear in Harkavy except in the appendix at the end of his dictionary, where
he simply refers to it as a synonym of vesh which it generally is, although
Winocur defines it not as wet wash in general, but as "ropa blanca", meaning
linens (sheets, shirts etc.). The only word for clothesline that I know is
"gretshtrik" and I think it's the only word there is. When I asked for it by
that name at a local store this morning, all I was asked was, "vifil meter?"

I'm probably off the mark, but it seems to me that gret implies the
existence of a verb, graten, or something like it, but I can find neither
noun nor verb nor anything close to them in German, Russian or Ukrainian.

A gris,

Subject: Isaac Bashevis Singer's last novel

Now that we are celebrating Isaac Bashevis Singer's hundreth birthday, I
recall my meeting with him. I spoke to him briefly. Itold him I enjoyed his
work in English translation but I longed to read his novels in the original
Yiddish. He told me to subscribe to the Forverts because he had something
there every week. I subscribed to the Forverts and every week there was an
installment from his current novel. The last novel was titled Act Teg
Pesach. For a few weeks there were new chapters. Then the story broke off
abruptly at a very dramatic and suspenseful part of the action. A note at
the bottom said that he would finish the story later. Does anybody know if
he ever finished it?

Subject: spaklieven and Spackle

Some years ago, and I cannot remember where, I learned the Yiddish word
"spaklieven", meaning to fill in small holes and cracks in plaster surfaces
(walls, in particular). A while ago, I needed Spackle and went to one of the
local hardware stores for it. I have no idea what the Hebrew word for it is,
or even the Yiddish word. However, since almost all hardware store personnel
(at least in Petach Tikva) speak Yiddish and Yiddish is what I mostly speak
ouside the house, I said I needed "A min proshik, epes enlekh tsu gips, vos
me misht es mit vasser k'dei tsu spaklieven kleine lecher in di vent". The
owner of the store produced it immediately. It later occurred to me that the
English word "Spackle" (apparently once a commercial name, which later
became generic) might very well have a common derivation with the verb
"spaklieven". Can anyone enlighten me?
