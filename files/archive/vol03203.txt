Subject: Learning Yiddish

A brand-new textbook for beginners "Yiddish: An Introduction to the
Language, Literature and Culture" by Sheva Zucker will be available soon
from the Jewish Book Center of The Workmen's Circle (800 922-2558 x285).

  A soon-to-be "must" textbook written by an experienced Yiddish
  teacher. Applies state-of-the-art techniques of language
  instruction, beginning with the alef-beyz. "...has many benefits:
  up-to-date language, uniform spelling (according to YIVO
  standards) and much more." - Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter, Professor
  Emeritus, Columbia University.

Subject:  Jacob Zipper/Yankev Ziper

Several MENDELEs ago, there was an inquiry from Toronto regarding
Jacob Zipper.  I'm surprised that none of our Canadian (or expatri-
ate Canadian) subscribers haven't pounced on that question, leaving
it to me, an ersatz Montrealer (six years of Mrs. Whyte's pickles
and smoked meat sandwiches), to respond.  Since I am a bibliographer
by trade, I will refer our York University reader (please excuse my
not having your name handy) to the following bio-bibliographical
sources:

(1) Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur [Biographical diction-
ary of modern Yiddish literature], vol. 3 (New York:  Congress for
Jewish Culture, 1960), cols. 652-653).  Ziper, born Yankev Shtern,
on Oct. 10, 1900, was a native of Szczebrzeszyn, Poland -- known in
Yiddish as Shebreshin -- but was raised in Tyszowce/Tishevits.  He
emigrated to Canada in 1925 and was for many years a teacher in, and
(later) principal of Montreal's Y. L. Perets-shul, which later
merged with the Yidishe folks-shul.  (Both of these Yiddish schools
were affiliated with the Labor Zionist movement, but the Folks-shul
had a somewhat greater emphasis on Hebrew.)  The "Leksikon" article
lists Ziper's publications to 1960, plus a number of citations for
articles about him.

(2) Fuks, Khayim Leyb/Fox, Ch. L.  100 yor yidishe un hebreishe
literatur in Kanade [100 years of Yiddish and Hebrew literature in
Canada] (Montreal:  1980), pp. 125-128.  Includes a more detailed
biography of Ziper, along with excerpts of critical appraisals of
the author and his works, plus citations for articles about him.

(3) Kahn/Kagan, Berl.  Leksikon fun yidish-shraybers [Lexicon of
Yiddish writers] (New York:  1986), col. 265.  Update of item no.
(1).  Ziper died in Montreal, on April 15, 1983.  It might be noted
in this connection that he served as editor of the memorial book for
Tyszowce, Pinkes Tishevits (Tel Aviv:  1970), which was used in
extenso by David and Diane Roskies, in The shtetl book, first
published by Ktav in the mid-1970s.  Ziper also wrote several books
of his own (fiction, essays).

The Shterns were quite a literary family.  Ziper's brothers, Sholem
Shtern and Yekhiel Shtern (Ish Ya'ir) were both Yiddish poets -- the
former, quite a prolific one, a kind of bard of Yiddish Canada
(author of the epic "Di mishpokhe in Kanada," a parallel of sorts to
Y. Y. Shvarts/I. J. Schwartz's "Kentoki" [Kentucky]).  Sholem Shtern
was "linked" (sorry about that) with the Yiddish Communist movement
for many years.  There is a wonderful photo of him adorning p. 53 of
the absolutely outstanding photo album by Edward Hillel, The Main:
portrait of a neighbourhood (Toronto:  Key Porter, 1987). Ziper's
sister, Shifra Shtern Krishtalka, was also (I believe) a teacher.
She is listed in Kagan's Leksikon and has recently published a
Yiddish children's book.  She donated her husband's collection of
ephemera to the Jewish Public Library in Montreal about 10 years
ago, and it includes some very unusual everyday items from the 1930s
and 1940s.

For further information about Ziper and his siblings, contact the
Jewish Public Library, 5151, chemin de la Cote Ste-Catherine,
Montreal, Quebec H3W 1M6.  The contact person is most likely Ronald
Finegold.

Subject: Learning Yiddish Two

Yudl Mark's "Invitation to Yiddish" has been out-of-print for about
four years. I believe it was published by the American Jewish
Congress. We approached them about reissuing the book or giving us
permission to publish the book. We were refused on both counts.
Since then, we have put more effort into the long awaited Sheva
Zucker book.

The book has been delayed for a multitude of reasons. Most have to
do with the corrections and typesetting. We originally listed the
book on the strength of the typesetters promise to be done by a
certain date. At this point, I am delaying listing it in any future
catalogues until I am physically holding it in my hands! I hope the
book will be available in May. You will have to ask Sheva for more
details.

Subject: Israel Yiddish program info

Can anyone provide me with name/email for anyone connected with an
Israel University's Yiddish program?  Or someone who might know
someone who can provide such information?  A summer program is
preferable, but any Yiddish program (for intermediate Yiddish) will
be great.

Thanks!
