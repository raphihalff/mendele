Subject: tuleyne

Dan Gilman recalls his grandmother's word /tuleyne/ for Italian woman but
remembers it being used only for Italian women associated with Jewish men and
recalls no analogous /tuleyner/ for Italian men. Well, in the Brooklyn of my
youth /teleyne/ was any Italian woman and /teleyner/ was an Italian man.
(Frankly, since both my native English and my parents' native Yiddish dropped
/r/ after vowels, I heard them both as /teleyne/ -- but I am sure that they
were used for men as well as women.) I'd be quite surprised if it's an
Americanism since it bears no particular resemblance to the English word, but
I don't know -- but I'm sure others here do! :-)

Subject: To be or not to be ...

Dan Gilman asks if anyone ever heard the expression "To be or not to be; that
is where the dog is buried" (Vol. 07.136).  Do iz vu der hunt ligt bagrobn is,
I believe, a Yiddish idiom roughly meaning "that's where the trouble lies." 
Thus, to render the first line of Hamlet's famous soliloquy into Yiddish as
"Zayn oder nit zayn?  Do iz vu der hunt ligt bagrobn" is pure delight!  Here
are the first few lines in the Israel J. Schwartz 1918 translation [my
transliteration]: 

Zayn oder nit zayn?  Ot vos s'iz di frage.
Iz eydeler far'n gemit fertrogn shtil
Dem shlayder-shteyn ["slings"] un fayl ["arrows"] fun beyzn mazl,
Tsi zikh bevafenen antkegn yam fun leyd
Un endigen dem kampf?  O, shlofn !  shtarbn !
Dos gor!  Un visn, az mir makhn durkh'n shlof
A sof tsu unzer hartsveytog un vunden . . .

At this point the Yiddish _oysyes_ are somewhat smudged in my ancient tome.

Subject: Sweater; bal-dover

In regard to the Yiddish word "sveter" [07.136]:  I don't recall ever finding
it in a Yiddish European text--but that could be due to my lack of experience. 
However, the German word "Sweater"--a British (not American)  loanword exists: 
meaning a knitted jacket and not what Americans call a sweater (which both
Britons and German-speakers call a "pullover" (the German noun "der PullOver"
is stressed on the second syllable). If "sveter"  does exist in European or
American Yiddish, the precise usage could tell us whether it means a "knitted
jacket" (and therefore probably comes from German) or a sweater in the
American sense--which would obviously make it an American borrowing in
American Yiddish. 

In regard to a German translation of the various meanings of "bal-dover" 
[07.136] I would suggest: 
        1. Der/die Betreffende(r) = person in question
        2. "Gegner" = opponent
        3. "(Zivil)klaeger/in, Anklaeger(in), Anklagende(r) in the sense
                of "plaintiff, accuser"
        4. "Schuldige(r) in the sense of "culprit"
        5. "der Leibhaftige" as a euphemism for Satan

Subject: Dvosye Seidman Bilik: Zise Zikhroynes and Her Writings

Beyond her deep intellectual perceptions, the glory of Dvosye Bilik was her
free spirit, and we were geknipt un gebundn in youth through the socialistic,
free and democratic ideology of the Arbeter Ring. So why do I search for some
orthodox format, a ritualistic machinery, to ease my dark feelings at her
death? 

To be with Dvosye, I went to her writings, and recalled how Sholem Aleichem,
in his will and in his wisdom, stipulates that if his children are not
inclined to say Kadish on his yortsayt, they are to come together and read
from his works. 

I have just reread her presentation in the Conference Proceedings of _Di
Froyen_ (published by the New York National Council of Jewish Women's Resource
Center.) With her usual insight, she selectively presents and honors Glikl of
Hameln as a "miraculous survivor", but now I interpret this work as a mirror
of Dorothy's personal depth and strength as a miraculous survivor over many
life-threatening problems. 

Slowly, leisurely, this week I will reread her challenging book _Immigrant-
Survivors_ (1981 Wesleyan University Press ISBN 0-8195-5046-3 She sub- titled
this "Post-Holocaust Consciousness in Recent Jewish American Fiction"  and I
recall it as being absorbing, provocative and intense. 
          
I will remember her delight in singing, laughing together at khor rehearsals,
our wonderful literary battles over lunch in the Automat when we were in
mitlshul, and their continuation at Brooklyn College. But mostly, I will
remember how she took from life with both hands and willingly did she teach
its reapings. We shall all miss her panache. I bid farewell to a most beloved
comrade.

Subject: sveter

Jim Feldman asks about sveter as the Yiddish word for sweater [07.136]. The
Russian word for sweater is sviter, so I imagine sveter isn't only found in
American Yiddish.

Subject: Kuch Leffel

I recall having heard the phrase "kuch leffel" used to refer to a meddlesome
woman. I suppose the connection is that a kuch leffel manages to get into
every pot eventually. Are there other explanations, and is the phrase still
used?

From: rturkel@cas.org (Rick Turkel)
Subject: Vilner lasunes, etc.

Diane Rabson wrote in Mendele 07.137 to ask about several words in a
litvish-Yiddish song. 

LASUNES - the Belorussian word "lasun" means "sweet" (the noun, not the
          adjective) or "someone with a sweet tooth."  In Ukrainian it
          also means "gourmand."

KULAHE - can't help on this one - nothing in my Ukrainian or Belorussian
         dictionaries - but there is a Belorussian word "kulya" meaning
         "ball" or "bullet" and it may be related.

MEKHILE - a Hebrew word (mexila) meaning "pardon, forgiveness>"

KUTNITSE - most likely the plural of Belorussian "kutnik," meaning
           "molar" (the tooth), or possibly as its diminutive, some tool
           resembling one.

Hope this helps.

Subject: petchah and other Turkish words

A footnote on Ottoman feet:  In Russell Harris's fascinating story of fisnoge
[07.137], he attributes petchah to an Ottoman word for foot.  Close, but not
quite.  Here's the definition of pacha [p-a-c,-a] in the large Redhouse
Turkish-English dictionary:  "1. sheeps' feet, trotters; dish made from
trotters.  2. lower part of the leg; lower part of the trouser leg." 
Apparently what was borrowed from Turkish was not just a noun, used to
disambiguate Litvish pronunciation, but the name of a similar sort of food
made from an animal's foot.  The dictionary also lists pacha dondurmasi
"trotter jelly", and pachaji [p-a-c,-a-c-I] "1. dealer in sheep's trotters. 
2. small restaurant where trotters are eaten". 

(For more borrowings from Turkish, see previous Mendele discussions of 
yarmulke; also Southern Ukrainian prakes, stuffed cabbage, from Turkish 
yaprak "leaf", as in yaprak dolmasi "stuffed (grape) leaves".)

From: "W.H. Phillips" <wphillip@vip.net>
Subject: petchah and other Turkish words

With reference to the footnote on petchah to the Russell Harris article on the
double naming of "fisnoge, fisribe" etc. [07.137] 

Surely the best known Turkish borrowing is "yaghmurluk" - "[cap] for the rain"
- now internationalized as "yarmulke." In addition to the Ukraine-Turkey
conduit the important Mizrahi community of Bukhara may have provided Yiddish
speakers in various other Russias with non-Osmanli Turkic words. The
Turko-Tatar linguistic territory is so vast, extending from Sinqiang to
Cyprus, that few languages are without such borrowings as "sarai," "chai" etc. 

An interesting linguistic project might be the identification of Altaic
tendencies (agglutination, postposited modifiers etc.) impinging on the
fundamental Germanic synthetic nature of Yiddish in those areas such as
Azerbaijan where it came into contact with Turko-Tatar languages. These would
differ from the Semitic constructions inherently present in Yiddish.  Semitic
constructs like "House-Peace" are expressed in Turkic as "Peace-House-of-it." 

The evolution of Yiddish has been so wonderfully improbable that such a
discovery wouldn't be terribly startling.
