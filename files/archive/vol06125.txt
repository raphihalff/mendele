Subject: Benegeye kompyuter-terminologie

In Mendele 6.124(1), Sholom Berger suggests the following yiddish
equivalents for Snail mail: shleppost*, papirene post, geveyntlekhe
post, stam-post.

I'd like to throw in "prost post."  It keeps the alliterative quality,
and much of the pejorative sense, embodied in the English original.

Subject: "Shlopornitz"

The yiddish word "shlopornitz" (which I never heard of) maybe equivalent
to "shlemiel". The definition is a "shlemiel" spills the soup while a
"shlemazel" is the one who receives it.

Subject: A mix-up of causal factors

In a recent post (6.114) Joachim Neugroschel translated into Yiddish
word for word the German idiom "ein Tropfen auf den heissen Stein" [a
tropn af a heysn shteyn].

Then, upon consultation with Mordkhe Shekhter for a better way to
express the same idea in a _laytish_ [authentic] Yiddish, he followed it
up (in 6.115,2) with the recommended substitute idiom "a lefl tsuker
makht dem yam nit zis [a spoon of sugar does not sweeten the sea].

With all due respect to my esteemed teacher and friend Mem Shin, I
believe that _dos mol iz zayn eytse nit geven gerotn_ [this time his
counsel was not felicitous].

The reason is that in attempting to substitute one idiom for another,
the _causal_ factors were unintentionally mixed-up.

While in both idioms the effect of the described occurrence is nil, in
the first case the _causal_ factor is the chemical properties of the
elements involved (the heat of the stone causes the water to evaporate);
in the second example, however, while here too chemical properties are
involved (salt vs. sugar), the dominant _causal_ factor is mentally
immediately shifted to the _quantitative_ aspect, namely to the
minuscule amount of sugar in the spoon as against the disproportionate
mass of water in the sea or ocean.  The two idioms are therefore not
interchangeable.

It is always commendable when, writing in Yiddish, to look for an
appropriate idiom in Yiddish, but I do not believe that it is wrong to
translate an idiom  from  another  language if no adequate saying in
Yiddish is found at the moment of composing.

The essential point is to convey correctly the logical lesson
illustrated in the idiom, a truth, I am sure, found in aphorisms in many
languages.

By the way, did you notice that Neugroschel's E-mail address starts with
the last two syllables of his first name "Joachim" and, while "achim"
means "brothers" in Hebrew, it still sounds yidishlekh?

Subject: Another Chanukah question

This elderly gentleman who sits in front of me in shul, told me an
anecdote, based on the letters of the last word of this past Shabbes'
sidra:  "Vayishkachehu".  As he heard it, the letters stand for "Velche
Yid Shpilt Kurten Khanike, Heyst er Vallakh".  I didn't understand the
last word, nor was it clear what he was explaining to me: nobility?
wealth?

"Whichever Jew plays cards on Chanuka, he is called a 'Wallach'". The
man came from Romania many years ago; any idea what a Wallach might be?
