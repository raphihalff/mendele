Subject: Introduction

As a child, I went to the Lubavitcher yeshiva for my first six years of
schooling. At the time, in the forties, Hebrew was reserved for davening
and for holy studies. Yiddish was taught as the language of business and
the street. But my yiddish has fallen into disuse, for obvious reasons. I
even had to learn a completely different Hebrew when I lived for a short
time in Israel. Therefore I was very happy to find Mendele, as it gives
me the opportunity to once again read yiddish. I especially love the
little poems, stories and jokes ( got a lot of mileage out of the Ex-Lax
jingles, I can tell ya!)

I look forward to each digest of Mendele, and will try and contribute at
some point. (I am even thinking of the week in the Berkshires!)

Subject: Meaning and Origin of Yiddish name "Genendel"

I am wondering if anyone knows of an ond Yiddish name, Genendel. Does it
have a translation into Hebrew or English?  What are its origins.?  My
research has found that the name Genendel may be a contraction of Gendel
and Nend(t)el.  Is there any translation for these names individually.

Any help would be appreciated.  Please respond by private note as I am
not a regular on this list.

Subject: Does German mies come from Yiddish?

My citation of a confusion of *mise* in *mise meshune* with *mise* in
*mise zakh* (4.412, 4) led to a discussion with Ellen Prince (direct
E-mail).  In *mise meshune* mise means death, and is from Hebrew.  In
*mise zakh* mise means ugly, and I thought it comes from German *mies.*
Ellen suggested it was the other way around, that I had it moyshe
kapoyer.  She suggested that the German word, mies, came from Yiddish;
and that the Yiddish word, mis, came from Hebrew.  Now I wonder if the
Yiddish word for ugly comes from the Hebrew, ma-US (loathsome).  Ver
veyst?

To one of Joseph Sherman's recent queries: an alfons (in Yiddish, Polish
and probably some other languages too) is a pimp.

Subject: Hotsmakh (cont.)

I'm sorry to disillusion Dovid Braun about my research skills, but I've
been unable to satisfy his hope that I might be able to find a children's
game song about a blind Hotsmakh in one of the standard folklore
collections (4.397).  I did, however find descriptions of children's
games with blindfolding in the two major sources (that I'm aware of) on
Jewish children's games: Shmuel Lehman's "Di kinder-velt," in the
collection _Bay unz yuden [sic]_ (Warsaw, 1923), and Regina
Lilientalowa's _Dziecko zydowskie_ [_The Jewish Child_] (Cracow, 1927).

Lilientalowa describes a game called "farblendenish" or "blendenish-shpil
blinde ku," in which a blindfolded player tries to catch one of his or
her fleeing playmates.  (She writes that both boys and girls play this
game, but usually separately.) Before the game begins the following
dialog takes place, with the blindfolded player answering:

		"On what are you standing?"
		"On a barrel."
		"What are you drinking?"
		"Apple kvas."
		"What are you eating?"
		"A bagel."
		"Catch the bird!"

Lilientalowa gives the text in Polish, but points out in a footnote that
the original is rhymed:  fas/kvas, baygl/faygl.

Lehman quotes a similar text from Cherkasy, near Kiev:

		"Oyf vos shteystu?"
		"Oyf a fass."
		"Vos trinkstu?"
		"A glezele kvas."
		"Veme's hendelekh geyen arum ibern hoyf?"
		"Mayne."
		"Az du vest zey koyln, vestu mir oykh gebn?"
		"A make."
		"To khap zhe mikh take."

The Warsaw version of the game is called, according to Lehman,
"shlepa-baba" (from Polish "slepa baba" [blind old woman]). He also
quotes other names:  "blindenish"/"blindzenish," "farblendenish,"
"blinde hener," "zhmurke," "blindzekayt," "blinde-ku," "blinde keytsh."
His Warsaw introductory dialog is a little earthier than Lilientalowa's:

		"Babele, babele, vu geystu?"
		"Nokh fish."
		"Zets dikh anider un pish."

		"Babele, babele, vu geystu?"
		"Nokh rayz."
		"Zets dikh anider un shays."

		"Babele, babele, vu geystu?"
		"Nokh puter kukhn."
		"Gey dayne kinderlekh zukhn."

		"Babele, babele, vifil kinderlekh hostu?"
		"Tseyn."
		"Gey ale kinderlekh zeyn."

In an earlier version of her work (1904), incidentally, Lilientalowa
describes a string game "koleczko-lozeczko" ["circle-bed"], which Alfred
Landau interpreted (in his German translation [1908]) as "etl-betl."  She
names the following figures:  "bed," "cake" ("piernik," Landau:
"lekakh") or "moon," "water," "cradle," "cake" again, "mirror," "saw."
