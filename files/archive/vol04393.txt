Subject: Hagode songs

Regarding Elye Juni's question.  I recently saw a copy of a 1790's hagode
from Hamburg.  It also says Nun boy nun boy, boy dayn templ shire for eil
bnei, eil bnei, bnei beitkha beqarov.  Nun did not trouble me, since I
know it through German to mean "now."  It gives an extra flavor of
encouragement to the call for the temple's rebuilding.  I however am as
perplexed as you are about "shire" meaning soon.  It would seem to have a
semitic or germanic derivation, as Hamburg should fall within the domain
of western Yiddish, although it did receive some Easterners during
Khmelnicki's rampages.  It would be interesting to examine whether this
version of the song was universal in Ashkenaz, extending to Franconia,
the Burgenland, Alsace, Kovne, and the land of tote-mome lushn.

Subject: Amplification-by-ex-lax

Does anyone remember the Yiddish jingle advertising Ex-Lax?  It praised
the amplifying action of the chocolate flavored laxative.

Thanks and a gute moyayd.

Subject: Lejwik`s "Shloflid"

Many thanks to Bret Werb (who contacted the poet`s daughter-in-law), Bob
Rothstein, Goldie Morgentaler, Mikhl Herzog, Willy Brill (did you
interprete this song already?) and Varda Ullman Novick, who answered my
question and could help me find the missing stanzas. I wonder how it
happened that my first question some months ago remained without reaction
at all and this time I was flooded by readiness to help.

To answer Mikhl Herzog`s question as to the translation I was refe- ring
to, this was done by Selma Meerbaum-Eisinger, Paul Celan`s 2nd cousin,
who succeeded just to rescue 57 wonderful poems before she died at the
age of 18 in the Nazi work-camp of Michailowka, Uk- raina. 5 of the poems
were translations: one poem by Paul Verlaine, into Yiddish and into
German, one from Rumanian into German and two from Yiddish into German:
"Ikh bin der veg keyn mayrev" by Itzik Manger and "Shloflid" by H.
Leivik.

Here is the german translation as requested:

SCHLAFLIED

Leg den Kopf auf meine Knie,
so ist es gut liegen.
Kleine Kinder schlafen schon,
grosse muss man wiegen.

Kinder haben Schpielzeug viel,
spielen wann sie wollen.
Grosse sind sich selbst zum Spiel,
muessen ewig wollen.

Musst nicht fuerchten, ich bin da,
werd` dich nicht verstossen.
Hast heut schon genug geweint,
ganz wie alle Grossen.

Hast geweint und hast geklagt,
nun will ich dich wiegen.
Leg den Kopf auf meine Knie -
so ist es gut liegen.

11.VII.1941

In a concert dedicated to Selma Meerbaum-Eisinger Ursula Fritzsch sang
her own tunes to the poems with a guitar while I was speaking in memory
of the destructed jewish culture of Bukowina and Tschernowitz - "Where
people and books once lived". Alas I cannot repeat the tune of Leivik`s
song for the readers of "Mendele".

Subject: Mu Asapru

In response to Alan Shuchat's query, a set of lyrics to this song has
already been posted.  But since the query referred to Theo Bikel's
version on the Elektra LP "Theodore Bikel Sings Jewish Folk Songs", I
want to mention that this album has been reissued on CD (along with "More
Jewish Folk Songs") on the Bainbridge label, BCD 2507.  The enclosure in
the CD "jewel case" appears to be reproduced from the original Elektra
booklet.  Here are the lyrics, as they appear in that enclosure (which
may not agree exactly with the way Bikel sings them), without
standardization of the spelling:

Subject: Pesach songs

A small addition to our growing collection of hagode niggunim:

At the end of the seder, the Bobover Rebbe sings the following niggun,
which he says was sung every Pesach by his father and his grandfather.

Di mame hot gehaysn
Niselekh opraysn.
Oy, vi hoyekh zenen di tzvaygelekh,
Oy, vi niderik zenen di kinderlekh,
Mir kenem nisht dergraykhn.
