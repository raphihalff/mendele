Subject: fatsheyle

Re: Leonard Fox's contribution to "fatsheyle", my mother-in-law, who came
from Odessa, and her 7 daughters always used the word "fartukh" to mean an
apron and they were always rebuked, "Don't walk about in your fartukh all
day long." My mother-in-law died about 40 years ago.

Subject:  husband of the Rabbi

We here in Temple Chai in Phoenix, Arizona have had one or two lady rabbis
for many years. When the subject of what to call their husbands came up,
one answer was "lucky."

Morrie Feller

Subject: husband of the Rabbi

My suggestion for the term for the husband of a (female) Rabbi:

 	der rebitser (-s)

Refoyl Finkel

Subject: husband of the Rabbi

As I was on my way to the Oxford Yiddish Program, I spent a week-end in
London. I found a synagogue on Edgeware Road and I attended Shabbat
services there. A woman rabbi conducted the services. At Oxford the 
teacher
was Dovid Katz. In reply to his question, "Nu Rivka, vos redstu?", I
related the story of my visit to the synagogue and the lady rabbi.  His
term for her was Rabbinerin.

Ruth Rischall

5)----------------------------------------------------
Date: June 18, 2007
Subject: kukeriku

I believe it might be a reference to a refrain from children's song in
Hebrew:  "Kukuriku, kukuriku, ha-tarnegol kara" Kukuriku is here the
equivalent of the English "cock-a-doodle-do."  The line might be 
translated
as,

The rooster crows cock-a-doodle-do.
(Tarnegol is rooster)

Subject: kukeriku

This is probably a pot of maize (USA corn); kukeriku = kukerikutz.

Subject: PBS program "Lomir Ale Zingen"

In Mendele Vol. 17.003 (June 10,2007), Martin Jacobs posted a message
indicating that he purchased a copy of a PBS program which he saw years 
ago
called "Lomir Ale Zingen" which included Mike Burstyn, Eleanor Reissa,
Michael Albert, Avi Hoffman, Zalmen Mlotek in the cast.  I am exceedingly
anxious to learn where to purchase that program and would be grateful if
Martin Jacobs (or any other Mendelyaner) would send me the details at
savoyid@optonline.com.

Al Grand

Subject: Vowel markings in _Tseyne ureyne_

A friend has a copy of the _Tseyne-ureyne_ in which the vowels are fully
marked, as in a sidur. Is this standard practice for other religious
Yiddish texts and/or was this true for older secular texts as well?

Subject: tsum ondenk

Alan Shuchat writes:

I'm trying to translate a few words of Yiddish for someone. It's the
inscription on the back of a photo.

1. I know that "tsum ondenk" can mean "in memory of." But it's also found
with photos. For instance, how would you translate "tsum ondenk undzer
bruder fun ..." Is this "a remembrance of our brother from ..." or "a
remembrance for our brother from ..."? Would "a souvenir" be better?

I've always translated "tsum ondenk fun" and the variants of this phrase
(which can be found on the backs of many, many photos):  "As a memento
of..."
