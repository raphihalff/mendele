Subject: Standardized transcription, far vus?

A few years ago, in MENDELE, I gave as an argument for
standardization the ability to understand each other's writing more
easily.  Since then, I have decided that adherence to the YIVO
standardized spelling is also a curse.

I belong to a Yiddish singing group. Our lyrics are transcribed in
Latin letters to go with the music.

As a result of standardized transcription, everyone ends up
pronouncing the words in standard Yiddish (but see "oyf" below).
There's no way that you can get 20 Jews in a chorus even to agree to
pronounce the words differently than the transliteration, let along
to REMEMBER when to do so.  So we end up singing standard Yiddish.

Notice that if all books about yiddishkayt were to adopt the
standard, the other dialects would be lost forever to future
generations.

The problem is that I find speaking or singing the YIVO
transliteration somewhat distasteful for for several reasons:

a. My grandparents spoke, for the most part, a southern dialect of
   Yiddish (e.g., "vus id dus" rather than "vos iz dos") and I love
   its cadence and sound.

b. Standard Yiddish pronunciation sounds too much like German to me,
   and thus has unpleasant associations.

c. Rhymes in the songs often get ruined.  For example, 'Bay Mir
   Bistu Sheyn':

	Std. Transliteration		Southern Dialect
	--------------------		----------------
	TITLE: Bay Mir Bistu Sheyn	TITLE: Ba Mir Bisti Sheyn
	...				...
	Bay mir bistu gut		Ba mir bisti git
	Bay mir hostu 'it'		Ba mir hosti 'it'

   It's obvious the song was not intended to be sung in standard
   Yiddish.

d. The pronunciation in the Yiddish Theatre (which spawned many of
   our songs) was a "southern dialect" Yiddish, so emulation of old
   recordings of the songs is a challenge.

e. Our chorus has been pronouncing the "oyfn" in "oyfn pripitshik"
   as written, instead of as "afn".  I tried to get them to change,
   based on Weinreich's dictionary entry, but at least one member
   insists that her Yiddish-speaking grandmother from Russia always
   sang the song as "oyfn" and not "afn"! (My grandmother might say
   "gey kakn afn yam"!)

So the YIVO transliteration standard threatens to silence the very
Yiddish subculture that produced many of these songs.

I understand that someone wrote down standard transliteration rules
for the Yiddish Theatre, which I'd like to get ahold of.  Does
anyone know where to find it?

Subject: toi toi toi and evil spirits

Could anyone please comment on the custom (at least on Devon Ave. in
Chicago) of making a spitting noise three times to ward off evil?
In German (and I hope you're not getting sick of these comparisons
with German, but I learned it before Yiddish), "toi toi toi" (sans
spit) means "good luck" or "right on!"  In the Yiddish movie "Di
Dibuk" (sp?), a Cabalist rabbi blesses his student by spitting three
times and, for extra protection, I guess, licks him across his
forehead.  Fortunately the latter practice seems to have died out.

A schaynen dank!

Subject: -ian and Jan

this is in response to Dagmar Lorenz's speculation about the
etymological link between the "-ian" of "Grobian" and "Jan".  I
would be surprised if there were such a link; I think it is much
more plausible to assume that "-ian" is the same Latinate suffix
that we find in English in "Christian", "Oxonian", etc.

Subject: MER TAKE DERSHINEN: E-HUG RETURNS

Patriotn of Yiddish word processing will be delighted to learn of
the reappearance, after a too-long hiatus, of Ari Davidow's E-HUG,
"The Hebrew [sigh] Users Group occasional electronic newsletter."
This is an invaluable resource edited by an eydl and immensely
knowledgeable sometime electronic typographer.

Subject: Grubyan, Motl

Though I've nothing to contribute the recent discussion of the word
_grubyan_, I thought to take the opportunity of recalling an
underappreciated Soviet-Yiddish poet by the name of Motl Grubyan. In
1975 or so I published a translation of one of Grubyan's poems (from
_Sovetish heymland_), a strong and understated Holocaust poem, which
translation appeared--to my horror--in a special issue of a literary
journal dedicated to the memory of Ezra Pound. I seem to recall
reading (also in _Sovetish heymland_?) a notice Grubyan's death.

The _Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur_, 2 (New York:
Alveltlekher yidisher kultur-kongres, 1958), 368, has the following
(unsigned) entry on Grubyan:

Grubyan, Motl (  -  ) -- Sovetish-yidisher shrayber. Shtamt fun
