Subject: Zvee Scooler's papers

Regarding the request for information on Zvee Scooler a while back:
Scooler's papers were donated a few years ago to the YIVO Archives. As I
recall, the collection is sizable and has been arranged.

Subject: Yiddish Folkmusic III

In fairness to Ruth Rubin, I should point out that the claim which I
quoted, to the effect that there was no indiginous Western Yiddish folk
music, or indeed any truly eastern Yiddish folk music prior to the 19th
century, was not meant to imply that Jews did not have a folk poetry and
did not sing songs. She was refering to the musical content of the songs.
She claims that they were apparantly sung to tunes similar to, if not
identical with those of their goyish contemporaries. It is for this
reason that I would be particularly interested in the music that goes
with the the songs sent in by Reb Dovid.

Among the documents in support of her conclusion Rubin quotes one of the
earliest printed collection of Yiddish verse, the Bovo Buch, a free
translation by Eliyahu Bachur Levita of Buovo d'Antona, an Italian
legend. It was published in 1507 and continued in popularity until the
end of the 17th century. In fact, due to its title and poularity it
became synonymous with bobe mayse. In the introduction Levita writes as
follows concerning the tune to which it should be sung:

Ober der nign, der deroyf vird geyn
Den kon ich nit gebn tsu fershteyn,
Den eyner kent muzika oder solfa,
Zo volt ich im hobn geholfa.
Ober ich zing es mit eynem Velshn gezang.
Kon der deroyf machn eynen besern,
Zo hob er dank.

Un a sheynem dank aykh alemen,

Arre Komar

Subject: Request for "Old Jewish Folk Music"

Does anyone have, or know where I can find, a copy of "Old Jewish Folk
Music", the translation of Beregovsky's work by Mark Slobin?  When I was
at school I used the library's copy, but I have been looking for my own
copy, and it's out of print.  I have a photocopy of the Russian edition,
but I could sure use the English.  I'd be happy to pay a fair price plus
shipping for the book.  Thanks!

Subject: The Compression of an Expression

I wish to thank Mikhl Herzog for his complementary note (4. 208) to my
posting "A Special E-mail sign for Yiddish" -- [mishteyns -:) gezogt].

As usual, his comments are clear, research-based, and enlightening.

Today I wish to discuss briefly how the expression that originally might
have been in full "afn (af dem) shteyn gezogt" (meaning "may it befall a
stone") came to be condensed and compressed to "mishteyns-gezogt" almost
beyond recognition.

While today the expression serves mostly to belittle something or someone
("a writer is he, mishteyns gezogt"), in the olden days it was, as Herzog
points out, a warding-off device against sicknesses or malevolent spirits
that lurked everywhere and inhabited every possible space (and non-space),
ready at all times to do their mischief.

The general meaning of the expression was, May it go away _iber ale viste
felder un velder_ over all desolate and dismal fields and forests, and
attach itself to a stone so it wouldn't harm a living soul.

The psychological reason for the compression, I believe,  is the
universal superstition that pronouncing a word that connotes ill is
tantamount to touching it, and thus provoke it to attach itself to the
speaker.  So the compression served as protective avoidance.

Subject: To show our group strength

In my posting "Campaign for a New Edition of Steimetz's Book" (4.190) I
described it as a book demostrating the author's scholarly research,
enthusiasm, and boundless love for Yiddish, and characterized it as
_teacherly_ and as an excellent reference work for anyone interested in
Yiddish.  It is one of the few books seriously treating the influence of
Yiddish lexemes and usages upon contemporary English.

Since the book is out of print, I wrote to the publishers, urging them to
issue a new edition of the book.

In my letters I enumerated a number of reasons, specifically the renewed
and vigorous interest in Yiddish among many folks and academicians, and
gave as an example the expanding list of Mendele subscribers.

I received a reply from the Director of the University of Alabama Press,
publishers of the book, in which he stated:  "We received your letters,
as well as letters from other people who have been disappointed in their
search for the book.  We will take all of these letters in consideration
as we devote thought to our [next] publishing program."

May I respectfully suggest that members of Mendele write to the
publishers, expressing their and their colleagues' interest in Yiddish
and in a new edition of the book.

This may be one occasion where we can exercise our strength as a group.

The full title of the book is:  Sol Steinmetz:  A Century of Yiddish in
America:  Yiddish and English.

This is the publishers' _NEW_ address:  The University of Alabama Press,
Box 870380, Tuscaloosa, Alabama 35487-0380.

The FAX No. is:  (205) 348-9201

The E-Mail addresses are:
Acquisition editor:  nmitche@ua1vm.ua.ed
General editor:  jzigler@ua1vm.ua..edu

Sol Steinmetz informed me that he hopes to revise greatly and expand his
book for the new edition.
