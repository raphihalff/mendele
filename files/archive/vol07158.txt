Subject: Genealogical request

Hello.

I am a genealogical researcher with a particular interest in Jewish names. (My
Ph.D. thesis will be published in four volumes in the summer of 1999 by Luz
University Press under the title "The nomological suffix -berg: a mountain or
a molehill?") 

Just now I am completing a grant application based on a compelling phenomenon
that has come to my attention: many informants have come forward to alert me
to the existence of a fascinating name.  Its variants are too many to be
listed here, but the first that comes to mind is "Kahan," also "O'Koon," and
in rare but politically notable instances "Kahane."  I am trying to track down
the provenance and meaning of this nomeme but have had little luck.  (One Web
source tra ces it to the Basque "azaliteariakohoon," meaning "pig's feet in
aspic," but I place little credence in this theory.) 
 
Any help would be greatly appreciated and will most certainly be acknowledged
in any publication. 

Please be advised that the grant is due very soon -- specifically, the night
of March 11th.  I would need any information by this date. 

A dank foroys,

Aridoso Parshandoso

Subject: Help with quotation from Mendele

The following is from 'Seyfer Beheymes' by Mendele:

es farshteyt zikh, az far groys simkhe un azoy fil gesheftn hob ikh mir
farshpetikt kumen in kheyer, un gekhapt a miesn psk.  nor petsh zenen petsh un
kelbl iz kelbl. di gemore ligt far mir ofn un es kukt aroys fun dort, es dreyt
zikh mir far di oygn - kelbl.  es krikht, krikht mir in kop a mordetske, a
sheyns, a getokts, oyerlekh kleynitshke, oyfgeshtelte, a kepele, a heldzele.
der rebe knelt, mruket mit a gmore-nigun, un mir in di oyern meket di ku nokhn
kelbl. der rebe tut zikh a heyb funem benkl - dos kelbl a heyb oyf di fislekh;
der rebe shtrekt oys di hant - dem kelbl farrayst zikh dos ekl: hots-hots-hots
- un es flit a patsh! der rebe iz beyz, fregt, vu ix halt? ix halt mikh der
bak. es halt shoyn by mkayem-psak zayn. ikh halt es nisht oys. efnt zikh
plutslim di tir - un es efnt zikh mir vider a velt. skotsl kumt, rebetsin!
aha, ot iz vider dos kelbl. di rebetsin loyft aroys beyz, a klap gebndik mit
der tir, der rebe, aroys fun di keylim, lozt oys zyn shver-biter gemit tsu
mir. 

I am wondering if anyone who has access to that work would be kind enough to
check for any mistakes in the quotation, and also if anyone has any comments
on how to translated 'mekayem-psak zayn' in this passage. 

Many thanks in advance.

Subject: A personal viewpoint on Mendele

Instead of offering a pronouncement about the nature of Mendele for everyone,
I'd like to offer a brief review of how I, personally, see the ways in which
Mendele serves.  After years on Mendele, I am naturally inclined to the view
that Mendele serves best when it serves me.  Probably, I am not alone in this.
However, no one person can define, set borders or limit the scope of Mendele.

1) I find Mendele most valuable when there is mutual learning and teaching in
the fields of Yiddish language and literature.  Light and breezy comments and
entertaining posts are always a pleasure, and often educational, too.

2) Mendele publishes.  I regard posting facts or speculations or any
communication on Mendele as a publication.  Once published, it is fair game
for comment.

3) While a post on Mendele is a publication, in no way is it equivalent to
publication in a journal whose editors are obligated to subject all
submissions to rigorous peer review by professionals in the field.  Therefore,
I understand that all submissions to Mendele have not passed that test.  I try
always to maintain that perspective.

4) Still, I understand the Mendele moderators have subjected submissions to
certain tests.  These are (among others): that posts must be relevant,
coherent, free of vituperative, abusive language, with no ad hominem or ad
feminam argumentation.

Subject: Linguistic Rigor

Bravo, A. Manaster Ramer, for standing up to be counted as a linguist and
calling an 'ayin a phoneme! Sad to say, just as so many of us believe
ourselves to be natural born (albeit untrained) art directors, so do we often
rush into areas marked "linguistic angels beware!" 

May A.M. Ramer and his colleagues continue their good fight. With the best of
intentions we often fill these electronic pages with nonesense. Moreover our
nonesense must be especially painful to our linguist-pedagogues because we are
so earnest in our half baked views. One is sometimes reminded of the good
hearted melamed of Chelm whose piety is exceeded only by his ignorance. 

As to the "maynse" discussion, (say I, illustrating by example) surely this is
an infection from Polish. Polish nasals are so pervasive that when attempting
another Slavic language Polish speakers often turn "gluboki" into "glumboki"
etc. On the other hand their nice open vowels add a new lustre to, say,
Slovakian or Russian. Yiddish too, I believe, must have gained something from
the phonemic influence of Polish. 

Yiddishists should count their blessings. Think of the poor Celticist who must
deal with languages that change both their endings AND their initial
consonants, rendering dictionaries useless. "Sagart" can suddenly become
"Tagart" or even "Hagart" before our startled ears. Maybe a little "maynse" 
isn't so bad. 

And how true is the observation that spelling reflects how a language USED to
sound! English and, in differing ways, Hebrew, Greek and Russian are notable
proof of this.

Subject: Arguing about Yiddish linguistics

Several people have written to me expressing genuine interest in Yiddish
linguistics, but two pointed out that in my zeal to spread the message of
linguistics I have gotten carried away.  Since one cannot judge oneself, I
must accept that they are right, and that I have been tactless and for this I
apologize.

Subject: Sutzkever's "Di blayene platn fun roms drukeray"

David Roskies is right saying that "the truth of Sutzkever's poem transcends
its facticity" [07.157]. To me this poem seems to be parabolic in the first
place. However the conclusion that the event described in the poem did not
happen cannot be based solely on technical issues. 

"Type metal" used in typography is an alloy containing lead, tin, and antimony
(and sometimes other components). Its melting temperature (depending on
composition) is 180-230 C (355-445 F), which means that small amount of type
metal can be melted in a kitchen oven faster than the tsholnt would be warmed
up, and a blast furnace is not needed.

Twenty five years ago melting type metal scrap to make "tin" soldiers, fish
line sinkers, and other valuables was one of the popular afterschool
activities among my fifth grade friends. The "technology" we used in our
school's backyard could have been easily used by the Vilna ghetto partisans.
