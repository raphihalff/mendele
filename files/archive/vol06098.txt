Subject: Vi zogt men yidish af rusish?

In response to the question about Welsh, Iosif Vaisman [6.096] refers to
the practice in Russian and other Slavic languages of using yevreiski
yazik and its congates.  Unfortunately, it is problematic in the same
way.

Although yevrei is the normal, socially acceptable word for Jew, it is a
cognate of 'Hebrew', so yevreiski yazik literally means Hebrew language,
not Jewish language.  I believe that novoyevreiski yazik (new Hebrew
language) was used somewhat but did not catch on.

This problem arose because the word zhid came to have an unacceptable
connotation, so anyone using it labelled him/herself as an anti-Semite.
Were it not for this history, one could say zhidovski yazik in
distinction to yevreiski yazik.

I am sure Iosif could clarify, but I thought the preferred practice
nowadays is to use idish and ivrit.

Subject: Viazoy shraybt men "hanukkah"?

As has already been remarked, the putative YIVO card would presumably be
bilingual and the English text might well employ one of a number of
traditional spellings. However, since the topic has been raised, were a
transcription of the Yiddish word called for, it is as well to remember
that, pace Ellen Prince, as far as the loshn-koydesh component is
concerned, it is customary to represent post-tonic vowel reduction. The
Weinreich dictionary has [kha'nike]. [kha'neke] might be equally
acceptable, while the full realisation of the vov will only reappear
when under stress (or at least secondary stress) as in
[khanukes-haba'yes].

Subject: "Khanuke" is Hebrew? Sure, but ..

Ellen Prince, in a response [6.097] to a posting about the correct
transliteration of "khanuke" for holiday cards and the like, makes the
reasonable point that "Hanukkah," "Chanukah," etc., being widely
accepted English spellings, are perfectly appropriate for
English-language cards.  She then goes on to say, however, that Yiddish
in general and the Yiddish transliteration of "khanuke" are irrelevant,
because the word "comes" from Hebrew.

This strikes me as unnecessarily broad.  Sure, I'll agree that the word
"khanuke" in Yiddish derives from its Loshn-Koydesh component, and I'll
grant the obvious point that the word itself, as applied to the holiday,
first came about in (I'm guessing here) Mishnaic Hebrew. But I'm not
sure I accept the implication that "khanuke" is, because of its
etymology, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hebrew language, with
Yiddish therefore in second place and "really irrelevant."  To start
with: how do you think the word got into English to begin with?  Not
from Hebrew, I would think, but from Yiddish--to which "khanuke" belongs
just as much as to her more prestigious brother.

I guess the point here is that tracking down etymologies is
enlightening, but assigning individual words to individual languages is
at best a uselessly imprecise endeavor.  (Try this exercise: to what
language does the prefix "bar-" belong, as in "bar-mitsve," "bar-mazl,"
and other formations?  Well, it "comes" from Aramaic, I suppose, but one
might as well say that it comes from Hebrew or Yiddish, for these
languages together created "bar-"-containing compounds that never would
have arisen in Aramaic, or in Hebrew alone.  Weinreich's _geshikhte fun
der yidisher shprakh_ has an excellent treatment of this topic.)

As for the claim that the transliteration of the word is irrelevant:
would that it were so! But a considerable number of people (yours truly
included) go through the daily headache of writing Yiddish-language
e-mail in Roman-character text-editors.  YIVO transliteration is the way
to do it-- nine out of ten Yiddishists agree.  When Meshiekh rides
through the door he'll undoubtedly be carying in his saddlebags a
worldwide standard for the e-mailing of graphics files, but until
then... Khence "khanuke," and the observation that irrelevance is always
in the eye of the beholder.

Yiddish books and return them to active use. Mr. Lansky and his
co-workers have saved more than one million volumes, often racing
through the night to rescue books from basements, attics, garbage
dumpsters and demolition sites. The ongoing educational and cultural
work of the National Yiddish Book Center has fired the imagination of
thousands. The Center is now the fastest growing Jewish cultural
organization in America.  A native of New Bedford, Massachusetts, Aaron
Lansky holds a B.A. in Modern Jewish History from Hampshire College, an
M.A. in East European Jewish Studies from McGill University and is a

A popular lecturer throughout the United States, Canada and Israel, he

University of Massachusetts, and the Yiddish Book Center's many
educational programs for college students and adults.  Mr. Lansky has
received numerous awards and recognitions for his practical work on
behalf of Yiddish culture. He was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1989.
