Subject: "Datshmerish toyg nit" on The Mendele Review

The article by Max Weinreich on The Mendele Review:  "Daytshmerish toyg nit,"
opens an issue that has its parallel in YIVO orthography. Both were non-issues
amongst my extended family and their yiddish-speaking neighbours, friends and
acquaintances when I was a youngster. I recall few litvaks amongst them, and
what Weinreich frowns upon was the norm in our circle. I remember my rebbe in
kheyder hassling me when I left out a shtumer alef while committing to writing
the imaginary letters he was dictating. All those now-unacceptable
daytshmerishe verter were the only words we heard and knew for those terms.
Mind you, my rebbe was from Austria-galitsye, so what can you expect? Litvaks
were considered to be snobs, not to be emulated, even though they were
deferred to as kluge yidn.  I remember my father mentioning the local tailor,
as poor as the galitsiyaner un rumeynisher amongst whom he lived, with unusual
deference and respect because he was a litvak, but the way the taylor spoke
was nit far undz gedakht. i.e. respect him because he, like litvaks in
general, was clever and scholarly, but he talks funny. 

Weinreich's article is not proste yidish, and for readers like me it takes a
lot of time and effort to glean its full content. For me, the subject is
interesting enough to merit the time involved.

I wonder if Mendele is the place to post words or expressions in articles like
this that one cannot find in the usual verterbikher. Those of us who live in
isolated communities with no native yiddish speakers to consult might find
this helpful, but I'm not sure that this is the right forum.  Things could
easily get out of hand if mendelyaner were to post long lists of words and
expressions they need translated. Perhaps there are mendelyaner willing to
help some of us with such things without actually involving the list as a
whole. Any thoughts or ideas about this?

Subject: Why does Russian use G and not H and kurve

L. Fridhandler asks why Russian has /g/ where German/Yiddish/English have /h/
and 'what linguistic principle (if any) does this obey or illustrate'. 

The 'why' question I'll leave to the historical mavens but the second question
does indeed have an answer -- the linguistic principle at issue is precisely
the one that Manaster Ramer and others have been talking about for the past
few months -- the *regularity of sound change*. That is, when a speech
community 'hears' a sound as something else -- or hears one thing and
'repeats' it as something else -- they do not do it in isolated words but
rather across the board. For some reason, Russian speakers at some point
started 'hearing' /h/ (which doesn't occur in Russian) as /g/ or at least
wound up saying /g/ when attempting to reproduce the foreign (for them) sound
/h/. Btw, _Hamlet_ in Russian is, predictably, _Gaml'et_. 

This is a really big principle, btw -- the basis of historical linguistics.
And it was discovered/formulated in the 19th century.

Meyer Wolfe raises questions for Hugh Denman's suggestion of a Semitic source
for _kurve_, excellent ones IMO. While I don't have answers to his questions
(don't know what 'whore' is Bulgarian, etc), I can offer the following from
Skeat's Etymological Dictionary of the English Language: 

WHORE, sb. (Scand.) (The _w_ is unoriginal.) Middle Eng. hore. Icelandic hora,
an adulteress, fem. of horr, an adulterer; Danish hore, Swedish hora + Dutch
hoer, German hure, Old High German huora; Gothiic hors, masc., an adulterer.
Allied to Polish kurwa, Church Slavonic kuruva, an adulteress;  Latin carus,
loving; Welsh caru, to love; Old Irish caraim, I love. (Proto- Indo-European
root *KAR.) 

So I think it's safe to say that there's no basis for assuming a Semitic
origin.

Subject: Russian substitution of 'g' for 'h'

Louis Fridhandler notes that Russian often uses 'g' for foreign (including
Yiddish) 'h' and asks "What linguistic principle (if any) does this obey or
illustrate?  I am especially interested in how it affects the sounds and
spelling of Yiddish words (including place names) in the various pronunciation
styles of Yiddish." 

As far as I know, there is nothing special about Yiddish in this context. 
Russian uses 'g' for 'h' in words and names taken from all kinds of languages. 
However, it also sometimes uses 'kh', and the latter is what Russians
pronounce in place of 'h' when speaking English, German, etc.  The 'kh' usage
is also much more recent than the 'g' one.  As to the origin of the 'g' usage,
it appears to come from southern Russian dialects, which have a sound we may
symbolize as 'gh' in place of 'g'.  Thus to Southern Russian speakers the
letter 'g' actually has the sound value 'gh' and not 'g'.  As for 'gh', it is
the voiced equivalent of 'kh'.  (To tell if a sound is voiced or not, say it
alound with your hands firmly over your ears.  If you hear a distinct buzzing
sound, it is voiced.  Otherwise, it is voiceless.  If you do this with 'z' and
's', you will find that 'z' is voiced, but 's' is voiceless.  Likewise, 'zh'
is voiced, but 'sh' is voiceless.  'kh' is voiceless, and Yiddish has no
voiced 'gh', and neither does English, but many languages do, incl. southern
Russian. 'gh' in turn is at least as similar in sound to 'h' as 'kh' is, maybe
more so, and so it is a good choice to substitute for 'h' in a language that
has no 'h' sound.  The southern pronunciation probably used to be much more
widespread than it is today, and there were a few words where even northerns
used the southern pronunciation, esp. in words of religious terminology. 

So what this whole story illustrates is that the way languages represent
foreign sounds usually starts out by choosing the phonetically closest sound
available in your own language (although the notion of phonetic closeness has
never been properly defined!).  But then it is quite common for a tradition to
develop of substituting your sound X for foreign sound Y even when the
phonetics changes (as a result of sound change over time or because of shift
from one dialect to another, as in the case before us) and makes no sense any
more.  In other words, languages often develop purely TRADITIONAL rules for
substituting foreign sounds.  This is what we have in Russian when 'g' is used
for 'h', while the increasingly frequent use of 'kh' instead represents the
tendency to 'fix' things by using the sound which is the closest phonetically
to the 'h' sound in the currently dominant northern pronunction. 

A Manaster Ramer

PS. The competing substitutions of 'k' and 'h' for Yiddish, German, Hebrew,
etc. 'kh' (= 'ch') in English may be a similar case, but I have not studied it
in detail.

Probably the best discussion of Yiddish toponymy in Eastern Europe is the
article by Edward Stankiewicz, "Yiddish Place Names in Poland," in vol. 2

From: Meyer Wolf <wolfim@idt.net>
Subject: grayz

In Mendele Vol 07.165, Mikhl Herzog refers us to an earlier discussion in
Mendele on the origin of this word. I apologize for putting him through the
mill again; but that discussion was curiously incomplete. Blame the shames,
who was good enough to direct us to the relevant numbers of Mendele. 

Herzog defended the etymology which holds that grayz is derived from Hebrew
gri'es (giml-reysh-yud-ayen-vov-sof), which he attributes to Dov Sadan, but
was actually first suggested by Zunz. Herzog explains the vocalic development
as follows (following M. Weinreich?): 

"long [i] in medieval German is realized as [ay] in Yiddish (vayn, tsayt,
mayn, etc.). The correspondence between [ay] in grayz and [i] in gri'es fits
that development." 

This is however not the whole phonological story: vayn, etc. had single
stressed vowels followed by consonants; *gri:'es had an additional unstressed
vowel -- so we would expect the outcome to be something like *grayes. And the
final consonant also requires some explanation -- how did the final /s/ get
voiced to /z/? 

It looks like some pretty fancy inguistic footwork is needed to defend this
etymology, which is also not semantically straightforward (as earlier Mendele
critics pointed out)  -- Hebrew-Aramaic _gri'us_ means 'diminution' or 'low
quality', not 'mistake'.

I am interested in making contact with anyone having issues of or information
relating to the Yiddish daily Morgen Frayhayt ( Morning Freiheit). I imagine
that some former readers, staff and afficionados are still around but I don't
know where to start in order to contact them. Any suggestions? I hope to write
a brief history on this major Yiddish newspaper and its contributions.
