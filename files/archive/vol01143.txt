Subject: visn v. kenen  &  lebm v. voinen

I've been noticing in talking to people who came in the
last few years from the former USSR to Boston that they
"confuse" visn (to know a fact) and kenen (to know, as in
to be aquainted with, and also to know a language).  The
same thing happens with lebm (to live, as in to be alive)
and voinen (to live, as in to dwell).

This problem is encountered frequently among native English
speakers learning Yiddish (or German) because of the fact
that "to know" corresponds to both visn and kenen, and that
"to live" corresponds to both lebm and voinen.

I have found cases of this among former residents of
Odessa, Kishinev (area), Kiev, Leningrad, and Sverdlovsk.
They are all native speakers of and, in most cases,
literate in Yiddish.  In all cases, however, they are most
fluent in and literate in Russian.

Generally, these people are over 60 and trying very hard to
learn English, including many formal courses, but alas they
don't know English very well.  So, I would be surprised if
it turned out that they learned it well enough to make the
same mistakes a native English speaker would make.  I don't
know if native Russian speakers make these same mistakes
learning German.  Does anyone else know?

Has anyone else heard this, or heard of this?  What is the
best explanation for it?

In mendele #1.138 'hayim (_not_ khayim, in my notation)
writes:
 
	(Vi zogt men "red herring" oyf yidish?)
 
Although my Rebbe in linguistics, viz. Zelig Harris, says
that there are no unacceptable discourses in language --
hence that everything (expressible) can be expressed in
every language -- there are more or less concise ways of
doing it. More particularly, some languages have _one_
word for a notion that would demand many more in another.
Not being a native speaker of English (nor, for that
matter, of Yidish) I can only guess at the meaning of "red
herring" -- pretty obvious I would say. But as far as my
folk-expertise (to mimic the oft-cited folk-etymology)
goes, I would say there is no _one_ word for this in
Yidish (or even, as far as I know, in Hebrew, Hungarian or
French -- though for the latter Harrap's gives
'diversion', which seems to me not quite correct). Let us
beware of trying to find equivalents in one language for
another!! [That's where eg translators of Bashevis Singer
fail badly, even though the author was supposed to have
_contributed_ to the translation. But in this particular
case I must 1. a shabes-goy; 2. a neshume yesaire; 3.
nebekh; 4. a yurtsait; etc. etc. etc. Conversely, how do
you say in Yidish: 1. rap music; 2. tagger; 3. junk-bonds;
etc. etc. etc.

Pardon my ignorance, but Prince Tamino, in the opening
scene of Die Zauberflote, sings, when menaced by the
dragon snake, Zuruck! Zuruck! Ich ben verloren!, Etc.
German has that.  Back off! Kessler

I once heard someone once tried to innovate loifshich for
what we call a "snicker", neo-yiddishisms are to be scorned
even by purists. Yiddish operates on a catch as can basis.
thus for birdwatcher-- since I dont think it was common in
europe for jews, the word was probably taken from the local
vernacular. similarly here I suggest the natural route
would be to borrow and not invent --"boyd-vutcher" sounds
good to me. mein eydim der boid vutcher--!
