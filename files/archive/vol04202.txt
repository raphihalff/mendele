Subject: Aspiration

Having just read Mikhl Herzog's remarks on distinctive aspiration in
Yiddish, I realize that Khayem Bochner misunderstood what I had to say
about aspiration, and this is reflected in my reply this evening to his
request that I do some instrumental work.

Perhaps my reply earlier this evening makes it clear that I never had
aspiration as a separate distinctive property in mind on my remarks here.
Rather, I was referring to the aspiration that is one of the salient
properties of "voiceless" stops in Yiddish. That is, I was thinking of
common Yiddish dialects with just two distinctive categories of stop
consonants: voiced /bdg/ and voiceless /ptk/. My impression is that the
voiceless category is clearly marked by voiceless aspiration in most, if
not all, prevocalic contexts. Unreleased final /ptk, of course, have no
aspitation. That is, words like /gut/ 'good' and /kop/ 'head' at the end
of an utterance might have unreleased final stops, thus without
aspiration, or released ones with some aspiration. I have no feeling for
the relative frequency of occurrence of the two types of ending.

Subject: Talesl

Bert Steinberg inquired about the song, Talesl.  I have seen it called
Dos Talesl when published by Henry Lefkowitch and Der Talles when
published in the sheet music from Der Yud in Zabiski's Tseitn. In any
case, the music was by Perlmutter and Wohl and the words were by (who
else?) Shmulewitz (aka Solomon Small).  We used to love to sing this in
our family.  Several recordings are available (and Bob Freedman can list
them for you without doubt should you be interested).

Here are the words:

Der talisl is dokh a tayere zakh,
Dos gehert nor tsu dem Yidn;
Yeder id hot in im hofenung a sakh,
Yeder id iz mit im tsu fridn.
Akh! Tayere talisl hertzlekher treyst,
Fil tfilos herstu zikh ayn,
Fun aleh bitereh hertser du veyst,
Du filst gut dem Yidene's payn.
Du bist dokh imer mit dem Yidele
Fun zayn bris on hot er dikh,
Oykh ven men grobt mit dem rideleh,
Vikelstu im ayn mit zikh.


Chorus:

Bagleytern in gloybikayt
Du bist dokh mayn eybikayt.
Der talisl iz nor dos eyntsigeh klayd
Far dem Yidn in zayn prayd un layd,
Fun zayn geburshtog biz in keyver
Geyt es mit im mit.
Vert iberal geyogt,
Zayn lebn iz geplokt,
Ales vos er farmogt
Nemt men tsu fun Yid,
Ales, ales, nor dem tales,
Dos nemt men nit, Neyn, Neyn, Neyn.

Ven s'iz mir gevorn nor draytsen yor
Ongeton mir a talis,
Vi veynig ikh hob dan farshtanen gor,
Var es mir tayere fun ales.
Ikh hob dan in der droshe tsugezogt,
Haltn mayn talesl reyn.
Leyder bin ikh fun dem goles geplogt,
Imer in trern geveyn,
Ongezapt is er mit mayn trer,
Triknt zikh keyn mol nit oys.
Im iz oykh mayne tsuris shver,
Mayn payn vi zayn payn iz groys.

Chorus

Men hot mir mit mazel tsu der khupeh gefirt
Der gliklekhste tog in mayn lebn,
In sheyne kleyder hot men mir oysgetsirt
Nokh oykh a talesl muz men mir gebn.
A naye gefil baherst dem yungen man.
Er tut on dem tales mit prayd,
Den zogt der talesl ikh bin dayn,
Ikh blayb shoyn dayn eybikeh klayd.
Du kenst zayn raykh, fardinen milyonen gelt,
Un ikh vel dir nisht farshemen,
Du kenst oys faran di gantse velt,
Nor mikh zolstu aykh mit nemen...

Chorus

I believe that Der Talisl was the only hit in this little operetta. I
haven't heard Shmaya and Khaya or Di Frau is a Held, the two other songs
listed on the cover.

Subject: A special E-Mail sign for Yiddish

Since E-Mail is a form of faceless communications, as distinct from
verbal communications, certain symbols are used to show actions,
emotions, or ideas, especially meaningful facial expressions.

This is accomplished by non-conventional graphic signs, such as

....................................    :) or  -:)  for smile,
....................................    (g)  for laughter,
....................................    ;) or  -;)  for wink,
....................................     : *  for kiss
....................................     { }  for hug;

As well as by a shorthand consisting of initials, such as:

...................................    Imho -- in my humble opinion,
...................................    lol -- laughing out loud,
...................................    gmta -- great minds think alike.

I wish to inroduce herewith an E-Mail sign specifically designed for Yiddish,
namely

.....................................   "mishteyns  -:)  gezogt,"

initially fully spelled in combination with the sign for smile, and after a
sufficient time for adequate familiarization possibly just by  the  initials
 plus  the  smile  sign,  thus:
[ m :) g ].

Now, the unique and characteristic Yiddish expression "mishteyns gezogt"
is hardly translatable.

Harkavy's tri-lingual doctionary [Yiddish, English, Hebrew] (1928,
reprinted 1988) defines it as 1. alas! 2. unfortunately! and gives three
samples of usage:  "What is man, alas!  Unfortunately,  what can I do?
Poor I! Poor me!"

Uriel Weinreich's bilingual Dictionary [Yiddish-English/English-Yiddish]
(1968, reprinted 1990) also translates it as "alas" with the explanation
in parentheses "said to dispel an illusion of glory."  The usage example
is about a "man of whom some think so highly."

Both dictionaries, imho, do not meet the mark of the manifold meanings of
"mishteyns gezogt," lacking the various and multiple nuances it is
capable of conveying in the tone of voice, special kind of knowing smile,
or slight but telling head turn.

Dictionaries are, of course, delimited to tight, concise definitions and
to a few usage samples, and it is likely that "mishteyns gezogt" does not
readily lend itself to this type of  mold.

"Mishteyns gezogt" frequently and variously conveys:  1)  An act of
advisedly and good-naturedly mocking oneself;  2)  Demoting oneself
knowingly a rung or two, or more;  3)  A suggestion not to take the
statement so seriously;  4) An indication that the speaker is aware of
the degree of exaggeration involved in what he is saying.  In sum --
"mishteyns gezogt."
