Subject: RE: Mise meshine

My mother always uses mise meshine when referring to
clothing."She was wearing a mise meshine dress".She uses it
to mean an drab nondescript color, I think. Mise is
feminine for "mies", I think, meaning ugly. Meshine is from
the Hebrew "meshuneh", meaning strange.

Reply to Vicki Fromkin:

"Mise" is Hebrew for "death" and "mishune" is "utterly
strange"--what it amounts to is death in a grotesque and
horrible manner.

Except for Jewish qualities of rachmones, one might almost
be tempted to say: "Af alle yidishe sonim gezogt gevoren."

Is the juxtaposition of these two items fortuitous, or is
Noyech enjoying himself sorting entries into an interesting
sequence?

This curse comes directly from Hebrew and means
a strange death.

(My translation is no doubt an understatement.) The
expression was originally used (I think) in connection with
the mode of death of the spies whom Moyshe Rabayne sent out
to Erets Knaan. After their forty-day trip they gave a bad
report and they were punished by having their tongues grow
to join their navels and worms then travelled out of the
stomachs.

Subject: mise-meshune

Vicki Fromkin asks for a translation of mise meshune.  U.
Weinreich's dictionary gives:

mem/yud/sof/hay-mem/shin/vov/nun/hey [pr. MISE-MEShU'NE]
"violent death." aynnemen a mise-meshune, labelled
contemptuous and colloquial, is translated as "die a
violent death."

Harkavy gives "unnatural death, death by accident, strange
death."

The first element seems unrelated to MIES, "ugly."  Is it
related to mem/sof [MES] "dead body, ghost"?

1. tel.
The mitglied who suggested tel< Hebrew tel 'ruin', was
right of course.

2. mise mishine(or whatever spelling).
It comes from Hebr. mitah meshunah 'strange death', i.e.
unnatural death.

3. -lech.
This is a good german plural suffix, attested both in MHG
and in modern dialects (cf. H.Krahe and W. Meid,
Germanische Sprachwissenschaft III, Berlin 1967: Goeschen,
p.194

Best, M.T.
