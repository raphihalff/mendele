Subject: A frage

I have been asked by a colleague, she is a very serious
scholar, (who probably overestimates the usefulness of
nets) to see if anyone here has ever found the term taharas
hamishpoocha before 1940 or even ever heard it then. The
alternate "familien reinheit" or "reinheit des familien
lebens" will also qualify for first prize. for my money, if
anyone here ever heard it even after 1940 I think they
should get a prize too.

I don't think that's the answer.  My understanding of the
footnote in Weinreich (p. 322) that you called
"incomprehensible" is that the rule is simply thus: for any
verb constructed from <Hebrew m'XXX> + zayn, the past tense
is <hob m'XXX geven>. It's not because it's a transitive
verb.  Ikh bin matzliakh; ikh hob matzliakh geven.

The reason is presumably that <m'XXX> + zayn is considered
a verb of its own, despite the obvious derivation, and it
is explicitly NOT the verb zayn plus the original Hebrew
adjective. ikh bin ge-XXX, as opposed to ikh hob ge-XXX, is
only used for certain verbs that are not only intransitive
but that relate to the status of the person (the list seems
to be very much in sync with the parallel "je suis" instead
of "j'ai" in French.  Thus, ikh bin gelofn, geforn, gezesn,
gevezn, but ikh hob gearbet un geshklaft (the words of mayn
yidishe mame come to mind here).

Am I on track here?

Subject: Re: t > th > s, and how to pronounce it

That reminds me of an anecdote that H.A. Gleason, who
taught me linguistics at U of Toronto, once told me.  He, a
non-Jew, became quite a specialist in biblical Hebrew.  (In
fact, he designed an ingenious way of constructing a Hebrew
dictionary, based not on alphabetical order but on looking
up words by their "strong" consonants that would be least
likely to disappear as the root took on various forms.  But
I digress.)  He knew about the "th" issue, of course.
However, when he first saw the name of the Toronto
synagogue "Beth Emeth Bais Yehuda", he was completely
puzzled as to its meaning.  (Of course, it's simply the
result of the merger of two shuls, which used different
transliterations of the same word.)

(Al Gleason also told me my favourite linguistics anecdote,
which is about the class of words in Swahili that begin
ki-, and whose plural is vi-.  Thus, "kitu", plural "vitu".
The word for a traffic roundabout in Swahili, due to the
signs posted by the colonial British, is "kiplefti".  So
the plural is "viplefti". But I digress further, though
perhaps not very far for the linguists like Ellen Prince
who explore how borrowed Yiddish words in English take on
English suffixes.)

Subject: Shmuck vs Putz

I've just re-entered Mendele after a couple of months and
am catching up with what may be by now "old news."  Since
this has never stopped me in the past, here goes:  Ellen
Prince writes of an informant who uses "shmuck" in the
double sense of "fool" and "bastard" (or prick, as the the
case may be).  I've always thought there was a distinction,
shmuck for fool, putz for bastard.  No shmuck is ever a
mamser, although many putzes are.  Since the two terms are
equivalent in their literal meanings, some equivalence
seems to have occurred in their con notations.  In any
case, I think Yiddish is rich in some part because of the
precision in which shades of meaning are captured by
different words.  This seems to be thinning out in the
dispersion.  "Tush" is another word whose vari- ations are
fast disappearing.  E.G.  When somebody did something
particularly stupid, my father would point to his head and
say "tukhus."  A coarse person, male or female, would
sometimes be referred to as "grubber tukhus."  A shaynem
tukhus, a tukhusl, etc.  (The etc. is something else!)
