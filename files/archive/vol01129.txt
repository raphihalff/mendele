does anyone know the etymology of the word lukshen
(noodles)? also, i have heard it claimed that it was used
as a family name in 'russia'. can anyone corroborate that?

Subject: Khapt im der vatnmakher

        A couple of weeks ago I was talking with another
New York expatriate, Dr. Philip Hammond. He grew up in
Monticello, New York in the heart of the borscht belt; he
later taught for a while at Brandeis. When discussing a
third person, he suggested I tell him to "khapt im der
vatnmakher....or khapt im der teakettle, it's the same
thing."  Did we go round on this in the beginning? I'm not
sure.

you flatter me, arthur. i did not forget that the oath can
be laid upon people as well as horses--i never knew it in
the first place. i never heard the damn thing before and
the only example you gave was to a horse. gey veys...

in an effort to atone, i shall answer this: 'sparrow grass'
is a nonstandard variant of 'asparagus', which was
'folk-etymologized' into 'sparrow grass'. in case the
problem is the term 'folk etymology', that's when speakers
hypothesize that some word comes from something on the
basis of its sound (or spelling) but are wrong. a very
similar folk etymology that made it into the standard
language is 'gooseberry', which had nothing to do with
geese--it was a folk etymology of the french 'groseille'.
or so i've read.

"sparrow   grass" = 'asparagus', an otherwise
unintelligible word. As for ober/oder. There's no
confusion. The usage is regionally consistent: ober do ober
dort: 'either here or there'. Standard Yiddish, of course:
oder....oder.

Aren Abramson: can you retransmit your message on 'ayin
(with 'chapter & verse'). May I quote you?

Bob Hoberman: Can you do the same for me? May I quote you,
too?

Anyone else?

Best for the new year. Mikhl.

Anyone   on the line that knows about "Smilies"?

Subject: dollar

Whenever I've seen $ written in Yiddish, it's "dolar" (with
a daled).  Hardly surprising.  But people I know, including
my in-laws (originally from Stashiv, Poland, came to
Toronto in 1948) use "tuler".  Even allowing for the
komets-aleph dropping to a -u-, which is consistent with
their (our) accent generally, how does the daled become a
tes?  Is this a local phenomenon?  I sometimes wonder if
I'll be understood when speaking to Yidn in, say, the US,
if I use "tuler" to refer to the unit of currency.

Subject: Personal introduction

Noie`h,
 
I'll try to reply point by point (in English, being a
non-native speaker of Galitsianer, and having trouble with
technical Comp. Sci. words). Forgive me my personal
translitteration of Yiddish, I do not have the patience to
learn YIVO or something like that; real Yiddish is written
in Hebrew anyway. Nor to pretend to speak Litvak (or even
to be a Misnaged, although `Hassidism isn't my cuppa tea
either).
 
I am a survivor of the lost generation of European jewry,
having come through the war aged 8 with no more Father nor
the 22 grand-parents, uncles, aunts and cousins on my
mother's side (shet`hi) or the 27 on my father's side who
went up in smoke (just one word on the subject, after that
no more: it is a sinister joke to say the Akaide didn't
happen; it happens be`hol doir vudoir). Half of my family
is Galitsianer from Galicia, the other half Ukrainian from
the hungarian side of the Carpath mountains. My main
interest in Yiddish is try to salvage for the future
generations what can be salvaged of the great Jewish
culture that exists no more, be it the Talmidei Ha'humim or
the yiddish writers who catered for the ordinary people.
All around me I see people writing Noie`h mit ziben grazen,
even the ones whose mamelushen was Yiddish. It is not only
physical destruction that we must resist. And some of the
israelis try very hard to be more Kenaanim than Jews.
