1. I've just caught up on about 40 back issues of Mendele,
having been rather busy for a while.  I'll refrain from
adding my recipe for matzo-brau, but can anyone comment on
why I grew up knowing it as matzo-brau while I see it
referred to on MENDELE as matzo-brie (presumably pronounced
bry)?

Lots of people do this with languages that are close. I can
get by passably in Spanish by speaking Portuguese with
certain standard vowel and consonant shifts.

At the Homowack (resort in the Ketskills) a couple of years
ago, I listened to one of the maids chatting with a janitor
while they were working.  She was from Brazil and speaking
Portuguese; he was from elsewhere in Latin America (I
forget where) and was speaking Spanish.  Neither made the
slightest attempt to modify their dialect to make it closer
to the other language.  But they seemed to communicate just
fine.

I'd like to hear more about this.  I know what Shlemiel
comes from shlumiel ben tsurishaday, in the Torah; and
shlimazl, I presume, is a contraction of shlekht + mazl.
Can you tell us more?

4. Re Yidlish:

I recently saw the film "Mame-Loshn", which describes the
history and current status of Yiddish (quite well, I
thought). In one clip, a speaker points out three words
that he's always thought sounded more Yiddish than English.
I forget who the speaker was.

the words are:
- svelte
- epic
- fermented

Re word-processing in Yiddish:

I use a Macintosh.  I don't need to write more than a word
or two in Hebrew or Yiddish very often, but I recently had
to do an article for Yugntruf.

I didn't want anything that would "take over" my Mac, since
I use it (heavily) for my real work, which is writing.
(Canadian tax law, if you must know.)  I didn't want
anything with keycaps that would muck up my Mac keyboard;
nor did I want to learn the Hebrew typewriter layout.  But
I did have a few fonts lying around, including one called
Vilne that's a Yiddish font, quite close to the YIVO
transcription.  And, I can type YIVO-transcription Yiddish
pretty fast, since I type in English all the time and I've
written a fair bit azoy oyfn post-rshime.

So, taking a cue from the program Raphael Finkel designed
for UNIX a year or so ago, I wrote a program in Hypercard
to do what I want.  (Hypercard comes with every Mac.)  I
created two fields, one with a normal English font and one
with the Vilne font with right-justified margins.  I type,
with YIVO transcription, into the first field.

Then I click a button to run a program I wrote in Hypertalk
that (1) converts the letters so they come out right for
Yiddish; (2) reverses the order to read right-left; and (3)
does line breaks every N characters so the lines come out
right.  Then it puts the output into the second field, and
it comes out perfectly.

The conversion program does things like insert an alef
before certain initial vowels; convert "sh" to "w" (used by
the Vilne font for shin); change m to M for lange-mem when
it's at the end of a word, and so on.  Most of the letters
don't need conversion; e.g., u->vav, e->ayin,
o->kometz-alef are how the Vilne font is set up.

The only stuff I have to think about when typing is
Hebrew-origin words, which end up looking weird in the
English form.  Aside from those words, which are relatively
few at least in my dialect, my submission to Yugntruf looks
just like something that would appear in MENDELE in the
original, and comes out in perfectly-spelled Yiddish when
converted.

The program is crude, but it does exactly what I need.  It
has the advantage that you can write the original text
using whatever word-processor you want, and then convert
the whole thing when you're done.  It's no Nisus, but if
anyone wants it, let me know.  As far as I know, the Vilne
font, which I got from a friend a couple of years ago, is
public domain. (It's also pretty ugly; I'd be happy to see
a replacement.)
