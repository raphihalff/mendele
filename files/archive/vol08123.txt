Subject: YIVO autobiographies

In 1932, 1934, and 1939, the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in Vilna
held contests calling for Polish-Jewish youth to submit their
autobiographies. These autobiographies were to serve as material for YIVO's
work in Yugntforshung, studying contemporary Jewish youth, its concerns,
hopes, values, and the problems it faced. Over 600 autobiographies were
submitted. Today, the YIVO Institute in New York plans to publish some of
these autobiographies and is seeking information about the participants in
these contests. Due to privacy considerations, they do not wish to post the
names of the participants publicly. If you were a participant, or you know
of someone who sent in their autobiography to YIVO, please contact:

Subject: Yiddish for a complete beginner

In response to Elan Freydenson (8.114):

Try Sheva Zucker's vol. 1 of her introductory Yiddish, which come with an
audio tape.

In the mid-1980's I attended Oxford's Summer Programme.  There I met a young
Swiss, not Jewish, who had studied Yiddish on his own. In a few years he was
himself teaching in the Oxford summer Pgme. 

So, take heart!

Subject: suggestions for poetry to set to music

After the success of my setting of "Di Lererin Mira," I have been asked to
set more Yiddish poetry to original music for an upcoming event in Boston. 
Do Mendalyaners have any suggestions? Poems that rhyme are easiest to set,
but rhyming is not necessary. Feel free to email me off-list if you prefer. 

A sheynem dank in foroys,

Subject: Jesus in Yiddish

In response to David Herskovic (8.113):

Jesus was pejoratively referred to as " yoshke pandre" -- the pandre meaning
panther -- a slur that his mother had had an affair with a Roman officer
named "Panther".  This later became corrupted to Pan drek -- Sir Drek.... 

Informatively,

Subject: "fremde" translation

Re: Inquiry about English translation of Mani Leib's poem "fremde"

The bilingual edition of the Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse contains
a translation by John Hollander, "Strangers," on page 136.

Subject: 'Huldah and Bor'

You can find more about the legend, in English in my article (co-authored
with Vera Moreen) 'The tale of "Huldah and the well": Judeo-Persian version
of a Talmudic Tale' in Medieval Encounters, Vol. 3, No.1, March 1997. There
are many referenses there to other sources.

Subject: treyf, sreyfe, etc.

Bill Weigel asked about the above, and why the former lost its final Hebrew
vowel while the latter didn't when both were borrowed into Yiddish. 

My guess is that it is because the Hebrew treyfa is a noun (meaning a "torn"
animal), not an adjective as treyf is in Yiddish.  The Yiddish form of most
predicate adjectives lacks any adjectival endings (grin, poshut, hoykh,
kleyn, kalt, u.a.v.), and by analogy with them, treyf lost its ending. 
sreyfe iz gevorn a substantiv in hebrayish un blaybt a substantiv in yidish,
heyst es there was no reason for it to lose its final vowel. 

zayt gezunt un shtark.

Subject: Bashke and scuba diving.

Alla Sokolova asked about the word "bashke" [vol.8.105.6]. Bashke simply
means basement, cellar (bashke-shtub, halb-bashke) and stems from Moldavian
(basca). Moyshe Shapiro (1899-1973, linguist) calls it "a moldavizm" and
translates it as "pogreb" (Shmuesn veygn yidisher shprakh, baylage tsum
zhurnal "Sovetish heymland", numer 5, farlag "Sovetsky pisatel", Moskve,
1989; pp. 108-110). 

Scuba diving and snorkeling / untervaser-shvimen mit akvalang tsi mit a rerl
(untervaser-sport): shvimen (toykhn, (unter)tukn zikh) mit an akvalang; a
rerl (maske, fusruderlekh) far untervaser-shvimen; akvalangist; akvanavt
[Shira Lerner, vol.8.113:6].
