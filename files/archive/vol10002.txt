b) Itsik Goldenberg re: _talis-taleysim_

If you were to read through Yehoyesh-Spivak's _Hebreizmen in Yidish_, a
dictionary of the Hebrew and Aramaic words in Yiddish, you would find
NUMEROUS discrepancies between the Hebrew and Yiddish form and gender of
Semitic-origin nouns. In general, Hebrew grammatical morphemes of gender,
person, number my be neutralized in Yiddish. How about constructions like

_DER even-tov_ (_even_ is feminine in Hebrew);
_ZAYNE oves-ovosEYNU_? Weird, no? Or
_di bobe olEVasholem_ (even though it be written _olEHO hasholem_)? (I believe
that the use of the "correct" _oleho hasholem_ in modern Yiddish is a modern
result of literacy in Ivrit.)

Thus, Ivrit _talit-talitot_ is probably a modern formation. 
The historically "correct" plural is, if I can recall, _taluyot_. 
In any event Yiddish: _der talis/taleysim_. 
And the Yiddish plural of _shakhris_? 
You guessed it, right? SHAKHREYSIM!

Subject: Concerning the gender of 'talis:'

The canonical form is feminine. Hebrew words ending in yood-tav are
generally feminine, although exceptions exist. I believe most Hebrew
dictionaries will show 'talis/talit' as feminine.

Interestingly, the Hebrew Dictionary I have shows plurals in both forms. I
find 'talesim,' 'talitot,' and also 'taliyot.'

It is not clear to me how the masculine plural came to be, but I can venture
a guess. Until modern times, all prayer ritual was controlled, performed and
led by the men of the community. Women participated at a distance, but
almost as 'observers' from the 'ezrat nashim.' It seems natural that the
ritual 'gear' of the men should be thought of as masculine as well,
regardless of grammatical niceties.

Subject: Tallit

In response to Itzik Goldenberg, if you check any Hebrew dictionary, it will
tell you that tallit is feminine.  It is common for Hebrew words ending in
"it" to be feminine with a plural ending "itot".  Why in Yiddish it is
masculine, I don't know.  Perhaps it's poetic license.  I just naturally use
"taleysim" when using Yiddish, and "tallitot" when using Hebrew.

Subject: Gender of a Tallis

Le-Mayse this is true, but not, perhaps, for the reason you might think.
Orthodox Jews are, generally, much more Yiddish oriented than non-Orthodox
(who use Hebrew).

Tallis in Yiddish is masculine (pl. tallesim). Tallis in Hebrew is feminine
(pl. tallisos---or tallit, tallitot in sefardit). Maybe our linguists can
confirm or refute this, but my impression is that feminine Hebrew words that
are fully borrowed into Yiddish (as opposed to "quoted" as a Hebrew word)
often become masculine.

Subject: sond and talis

In response to the query by Itsik Shaynhoyt, the words and music to "hob ikh 
mir a mantl" appear (pp. 168-69) in "lomir kinder zingen," (Let's Sing a 
Yiddish Song), Kinderbuch Publications, 1133 Broadway, NY, NY 10010. (BTW, 
Simms Taback, whose book "Joseph Had a Little Overcoat" was this year's 
winner of the prestigious Caldecott Medal, learned the song in Shule No. 1 of 
the Jewish Peoples Fraternal Order in The Bronx and at Camp Kinderland.)

And while Itsik Goldenberg puzzles over the gender switch between the Yiddish 
taleysim and the Hebrew talitot, he might ponder, too, how shabes became 
masculine in Yiddish (der shabes, di shabosim), while it is feminine in 
Hebrew (shabatot).

Subject: nouns in drag

Gender of Yiddish nouns and its dialectal variations is a very interesting
topic. International words represent a good set to study this problem, in
part because there is no etymological influence on the gender.

I looked up the gender of several Yiddish internationalisms in three
dictionaries: 
U.Weinreich. Modern English-Yiddish, Yiddish-English dictionary.
New York: YIVO, 1968.
M.A.Shapiro, I.G.Spivak, M.Ya.Shul'man. Russko-evreiskii (idish) slovar'.
Moskva : Russkii iazyk, 1984
M.Tsanin. Fuler Yidish Hebreyisher verterbukh.
Tel Aviv: H. Leyvik farlag, 1982. 
For convenience I'll call them American Yiddish (AY), Israeli Yiddish (IY),
and Russian Yiddish (RY) respectively, although the differences in these   
dictionaries may be influenced not only by geographic variations.

The gender of most international words is the same in AY, IY, and RY, as
well as in German (Ge), Russian (Ru), Hebrew (He), and French (Fr). (In most
cases the gender in Russian is the same as in other Slavic languages). There
are several thousand of such words, e.g., _biologie_ (f.), _balerine_ (f.),
_balet_ (m.), _brigade_ (f.), etc. However, in some cases the gender varies,
as shown in the table:

                AY      IY      RY      Ge      Ru      Fr
flanel          m       m       m       m       f       f
kapsul/e        n       n       f       f       f       f       
katarakt/e      m       m       f       m       f       f
komet/e         m       m       f       m       f       f
kvarts          n       m       m       m       m       m
lomp            m       m       m       f       f       f
margarin        m       m       m       f       m       f
medal           m       m       m/f     f       f       f
model           m       m       f       n       f       m
piramid/e       m       f       f       f       f       f       
planet/e        m       m       f       m       f       f
raket/e         m       f       f       f       f       f
taksi           m       f       m/f     n       n       m
tsitadel        m       m       f       f       f       f
travme          f       f       f       n       f       m
vaktsin/e       m       m       f       -       f       m

I found two Yiddish words that consistently (in AY, IY, and RY) defy gender
in Ge, Ru, and Fr. _Lomp_ and _medal_ feel manly in Yiddish (and in Yiddish
only). In cases where Ge and Ru disagree, Yiddish may follow either Ge
(_flanel_), or Ru (_margarin_, _travme_). 

An interesting category is comprised of words that end with -e/-a (Ge/Ru).
Some of their Yiddish cousins lose the final vowel in AY and IY, but not in
RY. In these cases we have pairs with different gender (_planet_ m /
_planete_ f). Interestingly, the words that have final -e in Ge (_rakete_,
_piramide_) don't have it in AY (perhaps under the English influence),
therefore these words are masculine in AY, and feminine in IY, RY, Ge, Ru,
and Fr.

Word _tsitadel_ is feminine in Ge, Ru, Fr, and RY. It changes gender in AY
and IY. Similarly constructed _karusel_ is f in AY, IY, and RY, but
_akvarel_ is f in AY and RY, and m in IY. 

_Taksi_ is f in IY, although it is m or n in other languages, including He.
_Kvarts_ is n in AY and m everywhere else. The list can go on.

What do the polymorphisms in the three mentioned Yiddish dictionaries
reflect? Actual differences in word usage in the US, Israel and Soviet
Union? Perceptions of their authors? Something else? Can a coterritorial
language without grammatical genders (English) influence gender assignment
in Yiddish? Inquiring minds want to know.

Subject: Third Seder

In reply to Martin Green's notes about a Yiddish Haggadah, and a third seder, 
in the early forties a third seder was held annually in Carnegie Hall in NYC. 
 
This was organized by the Zionist groups, filled the hall, and had many 
noted speakers. I can remember- I was in my teens and early twenties then- 
hearing Moshe Chertok (who was later Moshe Sharret, Israeli Foreign 
Minister), and Chaim Greenberg speak.  Greenberg delivered a wonderful 
address in English, and despite numerous shouts from the audience to speak in 
Yiddish, refused, and continued in English.  I lost track of the third seders 
in later years, and don't know if they still continue, in NY or here in Los 
Angeles.  If any one knows, I would like to hear about it. A hartsiken Dank, 

Al (Avrum) Miller
