Subject: Katshke-dreydl

Sam Juni asked about an idiom/ insult with the phrase "katshke-dreyzikh"
in it .  Just want to mention that Kadya Molodowsky uses the phrase
"katshke-dreydl" (I misspelled it above --Katshke) -- in a poem ("Bay mir
in hant tsvey federn fun a fazan") in  an isolated context -- (the line
reads:  "s'iz nisht vi mamzer-gonoruk,/ un shoyn avade nisht vi
katshke-dreydl.).." I wrote to Mendele asking for help some months ago --
(but got no reply...).  Have been told that there's a children's rhyme,
like eenie-meenie-minie-mo, with the phrase katshke-dreydl in it. Seems
to me that there's a relationship between Kadya's phrase and Sam Juni's!
I'd like to learn more!

Subject: Market Yiddish??

It hurts to equate the language with a slice of pickled herring smothered
in onions.

Our friend [Joseph Sherman] from South Africa, in 4.299, Jan 30, seems
not to know of the rich literature.  It is true that most all of it is
related to the Eastern Jews of Europe though I do not recall seeing any
that relate to other European countries nor to South Africa, Latin
America and others.

Please, he should not establish that Hebrew is the language of the Jewish
people.  Had he studied the history of the settlement of Israel in the
recent years he would have noted that the founders wanted to establish a
new start so they created a national standard of  Hebrew being the
language and did all they could to discourage any Yiddish press, theatre,
etc.  Later immigration diluted that effort so that Yiddish did in fact
penetrate.

Please do not be too harsh on me if I have not stated the above totally
accurate.  Memory plays tricks.

Subject: Shoyte ben Pikholts

Sam Juni (4.312) asks about "Shoyte ben Pikholts."  Pikholts means
woodpecker.  Receiving the title of "idiot" is no great honor, but an
upgrade to "Idiot, son of a woodpecker" is a nice, decorative
elaboration.  Oykh nisht azamin groyser koved.

Subject: Frage, shayle un kashe

Aaron Hershkowitz asked (mendele 4.314) about these three words for
question. In my experience, a shayle is almost exclusively used for a
question of halakha posed to a rabbinic authority, and thereby overlaps
his definition of a kashe.

As for nonsense questions, I think "klots-kashe" is the term that's most
familiar to me.  Then there's the stupid question on a nonexistent issue
or an irrelevant detail, a "kashe af a may(n)se," and the response
thereto, "er/zi fregt oyb a flig hot a pupik!"

Subject: Frage, shayle, kashe

Aaron Hershkowitz offers the following distinctions between frage, shayle
and kashe:

>> A frage demands a direct answer, a shayle requires a
>> decison or interpretation, a kashe calls for a discussion.

My recollection of usage is similar to that which Aaron Hershkowitz
suggests.  A frage is the most generic kind of question, simply a
question; with a Germanic root, this also ties to the general verb used
in Yiddish for asking, fregen.

A shayle (from the Hebrew noun sh'elah, question) is a query that one
might submit to a religious authority (teacher or rebbi) for a religious
opinion or a psak (official determination). Kashe, from the Hebrew
adjective ka-SHEH (final stress, meaning hard or difficult), in my usage
is a difficult or knotty problem, not necessarily amenable to a concise
answer (cf., di fir kashes from the Pesakh seder).

>> Is there a Yiddish term for a rhetorical question? How
>> about a nonsense question?

I would submit the term klotz kashe as a blend of the two, a seemingly
dumb or nonsensical question asked deliberately for its effect.
