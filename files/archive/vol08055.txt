Subject: Introduction

I grew up a member of the only Gentile family in a Jewish apartment block. 
When I was ten, I could speak Yiddish as well as any kid in the building.  In
later years I enjoyed Yiddish theater and continue to enjoy Klezmer music. 
But I never learned to read Yiddish, my current project. 

I spent a career as a labor organizer and now in retirement I'm the cook in a
Lutheran Benedictine Monastery.

Subject: Yiddish as a Foreign Language

Teaching a language that belongs to one's heritage, that has a background
that is tied to the students's own is not the same as teaching a "foreign" 
tongue under the model of "foreign' language and the reasons one studies a
language that has no connection to the student's personal background.  For
this reason there are now courses like Spanish for Spanish speakers.  The
reasons for studying a language, how one approaches it or why one doesn't is
much more complex than the simple rubric of native and foreign.  Enter
Yiddish. Anyone who has taught Yiddish in the context of a formal
institution, as opposed to a community center for instance, has to address
the implications of that. Israeli students of Yiddish have a different
attitudinal baggage than their peer in the US. I have taught the latter and
not the former, but I have paid close attention to the growth of instruction
of Yiddish in both the religious and secular spheres. I can assure Ellen
Prince, there is no similarity to the approach to Basque or Bulgarian, if
these are taught at all in Israel.

So, for the Mendelyaner who wants to engage in formal study of her/his
heritage language of Yiddish, there arise a host of questions. What do you do
about your "accent" in Yiddish. Was your background Galitsye or Vilna?  Do
you already speak Yiddish to your satisfaction but never learned to read and
write? Are you afraid to converse because you might make mistakes but know
too much to sign up for a beginners course. If you are a college student, are
you afraid that relatives may make fun of you for studying a passe language?
These are all questions that arise that wouldn't arise if you were to study a
truly foreign language. 

One question that definitely comes up in Israel is whether to treat Yiddish
as a living language or a classical (read dead) language.  Those who want to
study Yiddish, and yes, if you don't know a language, it still needs to be
studied, grammar and all, one way or another, encourage that it be offered in
ways that are meaningful to you so that besides the gender, case, vocabulary
and pronunciation that must be learned, the connection to Jewish heritage not
be omitted. It rarely is really.

In response to Yankel Kurtzman [08.038]: The Polish word "jaszczurka" means
"lizard."

Be me well and strong.

Subject: Any standard of spoken Yiddish?

A few weeks ago, I started listening to the two tapes with Yiddish in the
Language/30 series, looking through Uriel Weinreich's textbook, and of course
reading Mendele.  However, the tapes and the textbook seem to describe a
language with different phonetics than the one I heard spoken by Central and
Eastern Ukrainian Jews, and oftentimes they also diverge.  This dialect uses
'i' where German has 'u' and English 'oo' - thus 'git' ('a gite nacht'),
'blid' etc. - both the tapes and Weinreich give 'gut'.  Also the tapes have
'nisht' instead of 'nit' ('drei mir nit der kop'), while Weinreich gives
'nit'. 

Is there no standard for this kind of stuff?

Subject: Looking for a story by Sholem Ash

Hi - does any reader of this list know where I could find a story - a sketch,
really - by Sholem Ash called "Der Amerikaner"? I know it only from an
audiocassette, where it's performed (wonderfully!) by Chaim Ostrowsky, but
I'd like to know the date of its composition, and see it as a text in a book
- I'd appreciate any help - thanks so much,

Larry Rosenwald

p.s. I want to refer to this sketch in a talk on portrayals of language
traitors;  the talk is scheduled for September 18th, so if there's a way of
getting the text before then I'd be most grateful

Subject: book by Jake Rosenberg

Does anyone out there know about a book in Yiddish that mny great uncle, Jake
Rosenberg wrote about 1910 on the history of the ILGWU.  He was shot by
Pinkerton men during the Triangle strike.  There was a PT-boat named after
him during WWII. His picture was carried in Labour Day Parades.  So much for
family history.  Since I have moved down to the bottom of the world, I have
no way of tracking down his book.

Subject: Yiddishland

I am interested in uses of the term "Yiddishland," and I would like to ask
subscribers to Mendele for any citations of the term that they can provide --
whether written or oral, in Yiddish or in English, or analogous terms in
other languages. I am particularly interested in the earliest examples anyone
knows or recalls, but welcome all examples.  I would also like to know if any
subscribers use the term themselves and, if so, how they would define it. 
Those who prefer to can contact me directly via email (jashandler@aol.com). 

Many thanks,

Jeffrey Shandler
New York

[Moderator's note: For a recent discussion on modern use of "Yiddishland" in 
English, Swedish, and French see Mendele 7.192, 7.194, 8.001, 8.002.

As to the history, in 1937 Chaim Zhitlovsky referred to Yiddishland as a
commonly used term ("'Yiddish-land' we call it today"): 

   The purpose of the Czernowitz Conference was the creation of an 
   international "spiritual-national home", in which all classes and groups
   of of the dispersed Jewish people could live; a spiritual-national
   territory -- "Yiddish-land" we call it today -- whose atmosphere consists
   of the fresh air of our folk language and where with every breath and
   every word one helps maintain the national existence of one's people.

   (Zhitlovsky, Ale verk, bd.4, "Mayne "Ani ma'amins," un andere
   ophandlungen", Nyu-York: Ikuf, 1953, p.403. Translated by E.Goldsmith in
   "Architects of Yiddishism at the Beginning of the Twentieth Century",
   1977)
