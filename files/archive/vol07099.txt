Subject: Yiddish poetry on Kristallnacht

I am a composer looking to write a piece using a Yiddish text commemorating
Kristallnacht. I would be grateful for any suggestions about a possible text.

Subject: Eugene Victor Debs

Sometimes I no longer am sure whether I remember something that really 
happened to me or whether I am merely remembering an apocriphal story that I
have heard many times.

Anyhow, I recall an incident one summer Sunday in 1927 or 1928 at the 
Workmen's Circle Childrens Camp in Pauling NY, when our favorite perennial
presidential candidate appeared unexpectedly during a concert and was 
introduced tsu zugen a pur verter.

After a few general remarks, he switched briefly to yiddish, concluding with:
Ikh ken nisht zine a guter yid. Ober ikh vel nisht zine a shlekhter goy.

The applause was long and thunderous.

Subject: baleytn/bagleytn

First Andrey Bredshteyn [0.7097:6] regales us with the bizarre idea of Uriel
Weinreich sitting at his desk in NY inventing Yiddish words, an idea which
is quickly refuted by Mordkhe Schaechter [0.7097:7] who with his accustomed
erudition demonstrates the yikhes of "baleytn". But now Louis Fridhandler
writes [0.7098:2]: "It seems obvious that the German _begleiten_ is the
root. Yiddish not only changed the vowels (very ordinary), but (for some)
dropped the g. Any other examples?" There will not be any more examples of
khaver Fridhandler's putative g-dropping law, because 'baleytn' is no more
derived from 'begleiten' than Yiddish is from New High German (or any other
form of contemporary German for that matter). And anyway, why should it seem
"obvious"? When one bears in mind that 'leiten' means 'lead' and 'gleiten'
means 'glide', it seems prima facie more reasonable to regard 'baleytn' as
the older root form and to start wondering where NHG acquired the extra g.
Actually, both 'baleytn' and 'begleiten' come from MHG 'beleiten', which is
in turn derived from OHG 'bileiten'. At a much later stage NHG acquired the
extra g as the result of conflation with the variant 'geleiten' of the same
meaning. True enough, largely as the result of the maskilic fascination with
occidental culture mediated through German, modern Yiddish has absorbed a
relatively large number of neologisms mostly designating recognisably
new-fangled concepts like 'libe' and 'shul(e)' (often flagged, as in these
cases, by the -e ending). An exaggerated esteem for all things German can
also lead to daytshmerish "corrections" of good old Yiddish words as in the
present case with 'bagleytn'. There is probably nothing we can do to counter
the widely held misapprehension that Yiddish is a corrupt form of (modern)
German, but at least we Mendelyaner should be aware that Yiddish has a
venerable history going back about a thousand years and that Yiddish and NHG
are parallel independent languages that both developed out of MHG. The fact
that both languages have borrowed from each other in modern times does not
affect the general principle. It should never be our reflex response to
derive basic Yiddish words from NHG.

Subject: Beni Warshawsky's dismissal of linguistics

I must say that it is really quite upsetting to be in effect told that one's
whole professional life has been a waste of time, because instead of 
linguistics all we need, to find an etymology, is ask a native speakers.  I
wonder though whether Mr. Warshawsky would be kind enough to ask a non-
linguistically trained Yiddish speaker for the etymology of ikh and whether he
would get anything more than that it comes from German.  And if so, should we
ignore the results of comparative linguistics which tell us where the German
comes from.  Likewise, how about asking about where bentshn comes from.  I
doubt that a linguistically naive speaker would come up with anything.  Nor is
it a matetr of linguistics only.  As far as I know, historians, archeologists,
anthropologists, lexicographers, and several other groups do accept what
linguistics has to say about the origin of words and languages.Certainly, Max
Weinreich knew and used linguistic methods, and would never have dreamed of
asking Mr. Warshawsky or his informant for etymological information. Does Mr.
Warshawsky wish to dismiss all of them as well?  Perhaps instead of Webster's,
we should ask passersby on the street for the etymologies of English words. 

Until the early 19th century, etymology was a well-known joke among the
scholarly disciplines, and many suspect that Plato's dialogue dealing with it
(Cratylus) was intended as a spoof.  The discovery of comparative linguistics
in the late 18th and early 19th cent. made a major change, which all scholars
of Yiddish as well as other languages have accepted.  It is true that there
remain areas of obscurity and disagreement, but it is precisely the kind of
discussion that MeyerWolf, Dovid Braun, and I havehad here that leads to
progress.  This does not mean that we will necessarily succeed in explaining
davenen to everyone's satisfaction.  But that as it should be.  Scholarship
begins when we realize that the world is not as simple as "common sense" and
that goes double for anything to do with language, where native speakers'
ideas are almost always false.

Subject: Shlock, schok, and Shylock

With the recent entrance of the Merchant of Venice into the conversation, we
now have an opportunity to explore the relationship between Shakespeare, 
cruddy merchandise, and sukkah coverings!  Any takers?  ;)

Subject: Sholem Asch

I've just returned from an exciting stay in Evanston, Illinois, where
Northwestern and the abundance of booksellers enabled me to come closer to
completion of my collection of Sholem Asch's works in translation. Tucked into
a like-new edition of "Mottke the Thief" (doesn't Mottke Gonef sound sweeter?)
was a jagged yellowed page torn from the Chicago Sun Times of Thursday, July
(number is obliterated), 1956 - the obit for Asch (most definitely not written
by Ab Cahan!). Its headline read "Sholem Asch, Novelist, Dies On London Visit". 

I was suddenly recalling the many heated discussions from my youth that 
started with, "Sholem Asch hot zikh geshmadt. Zey nor vos er shraybt!"  Though
not a master craftsman, he always moved me deeply, especially his respect for
women, and yes, for the Jew.

Some excerpts from his obit follow.

"Special to the Sun-Times
London- Sholem Asch, noted Jewish author, died Wednesday. Mr. Asch, 76, was on
a visit from Israel.
   "Widely accepted as one of the great writers of his generation, Mr. Asch
was, at the same time, a highly controversial figure in Jewish life.
    "Although he spoke several languages fluently, he wrote exclusively in
Yiddish, and his works were widely translated. He was deeply preoccupied with
the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, and the themes of  many of his books
reflected this. .....
    "Mr. Asch was born in Kutno, Poland, on Nov. 1, 1880, the fifteenth child
of Moses Asch, a cattle and sheep dealer, and Malka Widavska Asch. He
received a rabbinic education, but while still a youth transferred his
interest to writing.
     "An ardent Zionist, he visiited Israel in 1906......  He came to the
United States in 1910 and worked for the "Jewish Daily Forward" as well as
writing novels.
     "Explaining his interest in Jesus, Mr. Asch once told an interviewer:
"My attitude toward Jesus was that I felt he was part of us. Everything I
have done I feel I have done for the comfort of the Jewish people. I consider
myself a ver y good Jew.
     "In answer to charges that his writings indicated he had abandoned
Judaism, Mr. Asch said, "I have never done anything in my life to justify the
rumor that I have left the Jewish religion."
     "Mr. Asch lived in Europe frequently, contending that the tempo of
American life..... made creative writing difficult. More recently he had made
Israerl his home.
     "He married Mathilda Spira in 1901. They had three sons, Nathan, Moe and
John Asch, and a daughter, Ruth."

"Der Tilim Yid" is called "Salvation" in the translation. If you're inclined
to read only one, I would root for "East River" in any language.

A shayle: What is the Yiddish name for his book translated as, "A Passage in
the Night"?

Subject: Baleytn / Bagleytn

I'm thankful to those who pointed out that in the Yiddish to English section
of Weinreich's dictionary it does indeed indicate his preference for _baleytn_
over _bagleytn_.  I somehow find the sound of _bagleytn_ aesthetically more
pleasing and am rather disappointed to learn from Mordkhe Schaechter's 
response that Max Weinreich considers it to be a daytshmerism. But here's an
interesting curiosity:  While Weinreich favors _baleytn_ in his dictionary
which was published in 1968 I see on the very first page of the Britannica
World Language Dictionary (1971 edition) _BAGLEYTN_ in the Yiddish column for
the word _accompany_ in Part One "English to Other Languages."  I call it a
curiosity because none other than Uriel Weinreich is listed as the Yiddish
Editor on the page listing the editorial staff !

Subject: Der soykher fun venedig

About Shylock theme, Leonard Prager mentionned "Shylok lakht" fun Moyshe
Broderzon. There is another work by Broderzon in which Shylock has a role. The
puppet play "Tsungenlungen" (Tsungenlungen : maryonetn-shpil, Lodz, 
Yung-yidish, 1921, 32 p.), Shylock is a vagabond who comes in the palace of a
Spanish princess, Maria. He recognizes Maria as his daughter Jessica, and one
can understand that Jessica maried a non-jew, decades ago.

About Movevski's essay "Shaylok un Shekspir", also mentionned by L. Prager: it
was first published in the periodical Globus (red. Arn Tseytlin and Yitskhok
Bashevis, n. 11(17) (November 1933), pp. 66-85 and n. 12(18) (December 1933)
pp. 50-78.
