Subject: Re: Dzigan and Szumacher

I want to thank all those who responded to my inquiry about Dzigan & Szumacher
and, also, apologize to those "aficionados" who felt I was doing them a
disservice by comparing them to Abbott & Costello.  I was not comparing them
with regard to their "material" but rather with regard to their popularity.
Please accept my apology.  I did not mean to denigrate them in any way.  As a
matter of fact, I am such an admirer of their talent that it disturbs me that
their comedy "shtiklekh" are lost to those who do not understand Yiddish.  I
am in the process of translating their classic, "Aynshteyn Vaynshteyn" into
English and hope to make it available over the net to Yiddish clubs, etc.

Subject: Re: Yechiel-Michl Guzikow

Alex Jacobowitz (14.029) asked about a Soviet author who around 1940 wrote "a
Yiddish novel based on the biography of Yechiel-Michl Guzikow."  In 1940 Irme
Druker (1906-1982) published a novel called _Klezmer_, based on the lives of
the violinist (and professor of the Odessa Conservatory) Petr Stoliarskii and
his teacher, the klezmer violinist Arn-Moyshe Kholodenko, known as Pedotser.
In 1976 Druker published another "musical" novel, _Mikhoel-Yoysef Guzikov_.

Subject: Yiddish Translation Project

Yadviga Finkelstein, the 91-year old widow of Chaim Finkelstein, wants to make
her late husband's book available to the non-Yiddish speaking world.

Chaim Finklestein was the last editor of Haynt, a Jewish daily newspaper in
Warsaw, Poland before the Holocaust. His book, "Haynt: a  Tsaytung bey Yiddn
1908-1939", is an important work that contains 31 years of pre-holocaust
Jewish-Polish history and was published only in Yiddish.

The website, www.becker-ks.com/haynt, contains the full Yiddish book and all
of the English that has been translated. Since last November, over 20
volunteer translators have signed up to participate in this project. They have
translated about one third of the book so far. Please visit
www.becker-ks.com/haynt and see this work in progress.

There is no business connected with  this project. It is not for profit and
all translations are in the public domain.

I would love to correspond with people about  this project.

Subject: lernen yidish fun der vaytns

A recent issue (Dec.31) of Der Forverts devoted a full page to describing and
extolling the Yiddish courses which are offered at the U. of Texas, Ohio State
U., U. of California at Berkeley and Harvard. Of course there are more
universities which offer Yiddish courses, e.g., Indiana U.

While such programs are admirable, they are of no help to the student who
lives in Yehupets which is nowhere near any of these schools.

Therefore, what we need in order to really spread the learning of Yiddish far
and wide, is for these schools to also offer distance learning courses. Since
they already have the required staff, and since distance learning is now a
well established educational tool, it should not be too difficult to create
such courses. Then, instead of affording perhaps a total of hundreds of
students the opportunity to learn Yiddish, there might be thousands of
students who could avail themselves of such an opportunity.

This would be just one more way to help keep Yiddish alive.

Subject: lebns fragn

Does anyone know if the periodical _lebns fragn_ still exists? The last copy I
can find was published in Tel Aviv in the spring of 2001. I called the phone
number listed on the issue and it doesn't seem to work.

A groysn dank!

In answer to Marvin Feil's inquiry, Yiddish records, especially 78s, can be
sent to the Wimberly Library at Florida Atlantic University, which is
conducting a massive digitization project for Jewish recordings. Contact Nat
Tinanoff at jewishmusic@fau.edu; he can supply packing material for the
fragile records, which need to be shipped very carefully.
