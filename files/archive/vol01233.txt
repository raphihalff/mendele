Subject: introduction elaborated

Mikhl Herzog asks about Camp Naivelt and Shloyme Axelrod
remembers singing the "Internationale" in Yiddish.  These
are connected; I also sang the anthem in Yiddish at Camp
Naivelt, which was near Newburg, New York.  We, too, raised
clenched fists during the chorus.  I have no clear memory
that the camp had official organizational connections.  My
better memory is that the camp director, Yacob Levine,
taught Yiddish school during the year.  Camp Kindervelt the
site of my early rebellions against authority was sponsored
by the Workman Circle.  There was an adult camp, Unser
Camp, adjacent.  It was there for the only time I remember
that I saw my father play a ball game, soccer, I think.
 
About Mikhl's other question:  It is unlikely that I am
related to Noyekh Prilucki.  My father was born in Brisk
(i.e., Brest-Litovsk), the youngest of twenty children.  My
grandfather inherited some money which he devoted to public
service; my father used to tell of working in a grocery
store as a ten-year-old-or-so in Warsaw, making tea from
the sweepings.
 
More to the point, Pryluck, Prylucki, and its variant
spellings was not an unusual name in pre-war Poland.  As an
adult, rummaging in the library, I found listings of six or
eight Prylucki (including at least one Pryluck) in
reference volumes of prominent Jews.
 
There is/was a town in the Pale by the name of Priluk (or
so I am told, I never found it on a map).
 
One more perhaps related point about my name: in the United
States people have trouble with my name.  They can look at
it and wonder how it is pronounced, although there is a
clear English parallel "pry" "luck."  Only people from
Eastern Europe pronounce it in the old way: "Priluk."  My
wife and I spent a couple of weeks in Poland in 1984 as I
lectured in several cities.  No one had any problem with
the name.  In fact, they understood the two possibilities
and often asked which pronounciations I preferred.
 
I tell this longer story than anyone really wants to hear
to support my conclusion that Noyekh Prylucki was not a
relative.

As for "cultural sensitivity"--the city of Lawrence and the
University have been scheduling a "cultural fair" for
several years now that includes foods, arts and crafts,
etc.  Usually it is held on a Saturday evening.  This year,
however, not only was it held *during* Pesah but during the
*afternoon* on the Saturday that was the first day of
Pesah!  I tend to accept these situations as the perils of
living in Golus.

For those working on Chagall:  Do you know his connection
with Hayyim Nachman Bialik?  Before Bialik made Aliya to
Israel Chagall was sketching him for a portrait.  Bialik,
however, decided to mark the change in his life by shaving
his mustache.  Discovering this Chagall refused to go on
with the portrait.  Later the two met once again and had a
very friendly relationship.

[Regarding Zev Bar-Lev's rquest:]

There is a heap of things just out on the list 'e-hug'
(paricularly about Hebrew Nissus), but it's copyrighted and
I don't want to clutter the list. You may subscribe
individually by sending the one-line message 'subscribe

Subject: kompyuteray af yidish (Yiddish computing)

Z Bar-Lev,

Nisus is the best thing, although it isn't fully a desktop
publishing program, but almost.  It's expensive and not
copyable.  Their support system is very good.  I use the
program (and the one you'd need, naturally, is "Hebrew
Nisus") . Write me a personal note and I'll give you more
info. Yiddish fonts have been made for the program (i.e.,
the diacritics neceassary for Yiddish spelling and the
nekudes for Hebrew are available). Zayt gezunt.
