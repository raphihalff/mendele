As a long-time resident of Israel (and a lifetime lover of Yiddish) I would
like to point out that the Hebrew word you refer to is "frayer". This is
one of a very long list of Yiddish words that have entered the Israeli
lexicon, but I am quite certain that very few people are aware of the fact
that they are speaking mame-loshn. The Mendele staff and lexicographers
are presumably familiar with many of these - am I correct in this
assumption?

Subject: Re: aftsulokhes

Regarding Irwin Mortman's posting on "aftsulokhes" [Mendele 14.036]---it
never, in my experience, means a mere coincidence in North American
Yiddish, but an evil coincidence, something which frustrates a good
intention "we were going to have a picnic but aftsulokhes it rained cats
and dogs." This accords with the general meaning of the phrase, not just in
US, of "out of spite" or "on purpose"(see e.g.Niborski's and Vaisbrot's
"Dictionnaire Yiddish-Francais"), which I've always taken to refer to the
spiteful workings of Satan or other evil spirits.

Subject: nokhn khirurgishn tish

This poem by Yisroel Shtern (1894-1942) was published in _Haynt_ just as
Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.

". [The historian Bar] Mark wrote that ..the symbolic poem "After the
Surgical Table" by Israel Shtern, which was printed in Haynt on September
1, the day that Hitler invaded Poland, reflected the mood of the Polish
Jews during those days. Shtern's poem resounded like a portent of the mad
times that would soon befall the Jews. The poem was forgotten in the tragic
occurrences of the Holocaust era and was not printed again.
(from Haynt, a tsaytung bay Yidn, 1908-1939, by Chaim Finkelstein, p. 327.)

Translation:

After the operation

The scalpel knows:
we are not rye
making a winter pause
halting our growth
orders us to be lonely;
our breath is parting:
Between life and life strolls chloroform.

With steps soft, stealthy
and in deep shade,
like in between two roofs
a cat, overlooking
the world from up high.
_ _ _ _ _ _

We sleep and sleep,
like houses late at night
not knowing, what is happening above us.

Where are we?
Are they just cutting us up
like fruits on stems
that swing until they
inhale for the last time
into their limbs the fragrance,
the flagrance of the garden
where grieves about them now a tree? ...

Or is there more to us?
Something still awaiting us?
And we are only
the sinful sons
of a king in anger:
That we may carry more faithfully the crown?

We are driven out into the desserts ...
Thirsty we drink "sleeping potion".
Comes a magician and scratches us with a knife
on our bellies:

"You people have
already been
at the edge
of the abyss,
return
and remember!"

We wake up knowing:
So early no one
ever saw death ...
_ _ _ _ _ _

Why are our bodies not the nights,
the sad nights of the world,
and while they're cleaving us up, let the rooster sing a song:
God has ripped up the dark, it's getting bright!

Yisroel Shtern (1894-1942):. "nokhn khirurgishn tish"

************************************

How to translate a poem?

The poem is called 'nokhn khirurgishn tish'.

Why 'after' and not 'on' ? A first reading gives the impression that we are
dealing with a description of a person under narcosis on an operation
table, undergoing an operation and regaining consciousness after a near
death experience. During the operation the patient retains some
consciousness fluctuating between different levels. In the first part of
the poem imagery and logic fight each other. We try in vain to use grammar
as a lead to make some sense of the rambling train of thought. The poem
starts with "The little knife knows ." Next, the subconscious takes over
expressing itself first in naturalistic, later in biblical images. The
surgeon becomes a magician, calling the patient back to life. At the end of
the poem the patient awakens to a new dawn, to the ' after' in the title.
Actually, the poet does not speak about one particular patient, but
throughout the poem he uses the plural, we, our, you.

We may assume that the poem was written shortly before or on the occasion
of the German invasion of Poland and have to read it in its historical
context. Because it is a modern poem, where far more is suggested than
actually said, giving a 'correct' translation or interpretation is not
possible. To illustrate this, let us return to the first verse:

Literally:

The little knife knows,
that we are not rye
and makes winter a while
in the midst of the growing
and orders us to be lonely;
our breadth parts:
between life and life strolls chloroform.

Well, knives generally don't know things. This little knife is gifted with
understanding and knows 'that we are not rye'. It is not only a sentient
little knife, that knows things, it also acts: it makes winter and it gives
orders.

In the sixth verse we get some more information about the knife:

We are banished into deserts .
Thirsty, we drink "sleeping potion".
Comes a magician and scratches us with a knife
on our bellies.

So, the little knife is a magic knife, a magician's knife. After having
drunk a sleeping potion, or after having sniffed a dose of chloroform, the
knife scratching on our bellies creates a winter, banishes us to deserts,
orders us to be lonely. Since we are undergoing an operation the 'little
knife' must be the scalpel in the hand of the surgeon - magician.

However, having progressed this far with an interpretation of the poem, it
still is not clear what the 'rye', that we are not, has got to do with it.

The image is that of a field during winter. The winter rye, which had been
sown in late autumn, started growing, the first few inches of growth colour
the black earth with a soft green hue and now winters sets in. Frost
temporally stops the growth, the rye goes into hibernation.

To stay with the knife a bit longer, the poem speaks about 'cutting up'
(4th verse), 'cleaving up' (9th verse) and 'scratching' (6th verse). The
'scratching', done by the magician, is followed by a spell: "You people
have already been at the edge of the abyss, turn around and remember!".
Next the patient or patients regains consciousness. The scratching reminds
of the village 'sogerke' who would rub or scratch a sore spot, a swelling,
with an object, an egg or a bone, while mumbling Tartar incantations.

The poem says:

We wake up in the knowledge:
So early has nobody ever
seen death .

Regaining consciousness comes simultaneously with the realisation of having
been close to death.

But who is the patient and who is the surgeon? The purpose of the poem is
not to describe the semi-conscious thoughts of a person undergoing an
appendectomy, but to liken such an operation to the German invasion and to
predict its impact on Polish Jewry.

The last verse reads:

Why are our bodies not the nights,
The sad nights of the world,
And while they cleave us up, let the rooster sing a song:
God has ripped up the dark, it is getting bright!

The question in the first line is rather a statement than a question, there
is no question mark. The poet seems to say that God has temporarily averted
his face from the world, leaving it in primordial darkness without His
radiance. The 'Operation' that takes place in God's apparent absence is but
the dawn of a new era in which God returns in his full glory.

Desperate optimism, deep faith? Or is the question asked to express doubt
that the coming events will run their course that smoothly?

Two verses poignantly describe the situation at the moment of the invasion:

We sleep, we sleep,
like houses late at night
not knowing what happens above us

and:

We wake up knowing,
So early nobody ever
Has seen death .

The poet expresses in these lines how, on the one hand, the Jewish
population suppressed knowledge about what was coming, pretended not to
know, could not know, but on the other hand has lived with a clear
premonition about the disaster about to strike for a long time.

In the 4th and 5th verses the poet asks about the nature of the human
condition and the purpose of the destruction. He suggests that God is angry
because of the sins of his children and that His punishment aims at their
future improvement. However, somewhat later in the poem the magician
reminds the patients that they have already been to the edge of the Abyss
and admonishes them to turn around and remember. A call to resist?

We could return to other slightly obscure places in the poem. We might
speculate on the exact meaning of the 'shotnde trit' and the 'veltisher
hoykh' in the second verse. Are the steps of the cat throwing a shadow, or
are they shadowy? Does the cat make the jump between two roofs or not? Is
it 'worldly height' as opposed to 'heavenly height' or just the world from
up high? We could philosophise over the meaning of 'glombike peyres' in the
fourth verse. No such word is found in any Yiddish dictionary. Polish
'glab' - stalk' is a possibility, but related Yiddish 'gl(i)omp' is only
used for 'cabbage stalk' and to denote a 'foolish person'. Perhaps this
would be nit-picking about minor details that only provide imagery for the
poem as a whole.

[Moderator's note: for reasons too embarassing to relate a number of posts to
Mendele have only recently surfaced. Our sincere apologies. They will all
appear, beginning with this one from Elye Palevsky.]

I believe it was Dr. Shloyme Noble (o"h) who (as an aside in a Yiddish
linguistics class) remarked that the original expression was: "hankn
katshanes" i.e. chopping cabbage, meaning empty prattling. As the Yiddish
geography shifted so did what was heard and understood resulting in a
changed phrase with a similar meaning.

Subject: Re: New World Yiddish

[In reply to Mel Comisarow's post, Mendele 14.035]:

We grew up in the early part of the 20th century in Edmonton and Winnipeg
respectively. Neither of us ever heard the word "lokshen" in reference to
Italians. Jews and Italians lived in close proximity in New York and we
could understand the use of that identity there.

We concur the the expression Gimelakh was used to describe immigrants from
the Ukraine and surrounding areas. They constituted a large part of the
population; they were recruited by representatives of the Canadian
railroads to fill the vast spaces owned by them to create agricultural
products for the railroads to transport. Few , if any, showed up in Eastern
Canada.

Obviously the Yiddish in America and Canada would be different from that
spoken in Eastern Europe just as that spoken in Poland, Romania, Russia,
Ukraine, etc were different from each other. And the Yiddish spoken in
Mexico probably differs from  that in other Latin American countries.

Does anyone else out there know the origin of this song:

mir zenen vi feygelekh fraye
mir zenen vi blimelekh in feld
mir zenen khaverim getraye

The next stanza begins with:  mir lernen und zingen tzuzamen
That's all I remember
There are also a lot of tra la la's at the end of each verse.
