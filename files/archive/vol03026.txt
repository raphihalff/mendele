Subject: Nisht geshtoygn/bankes

In  Mendele Vol 3.019, Shleyme Axelrod offers:

>1.  "ni(sh)t geshtoygn, ni(sh)t gefloygn" = totally false; nonsense

Comment: referring to Jesus, of course, denying that he ever rose or
ascended, and by extension to other improbabilities.

re: bankas.

These are called "cosot ru'aH" in modern Hebrew, meaning cups used
by barbers in cupping and also signifying meaningless and useless
treatments.

Some medical background.  The cups were applied, usually to the skin
of the back [or front less often] of the chest cavity.  A small
candle, or match was used under the lip, to use up the oxgyen [about
20% of the volume] and thus produce a seal to the skin.  The vacuum
would "draw blood" to the skin, presumably by causing the small
blood vessels of the skin to dilate.  Since a tingling feeling
accompanied the application the recipient would feel some "benefit"
from the treatment.  Bankas were used in my childhood, '30's and
'40's in Williamsburg [not Virginia], administered by barbers
[descended from surgeons, originally barber-surgeons].

As to being of no use to the dead [a toyten bankas], they probably
[other than psychologically] did little for the live either.

Subject: Introduction

Dovid Ber Katz asks about the idiom:

	Heng zich uf ayf a tsukershtrikl.

My parents used that expression when I was a kid. I found it in
"Words Like Arrows", in the Curses section, the way I remember my
parents using it:

	Heng dir oyf a tsuker shtrikl vestu hobn a zisn toyt!

The translation that accompanies it says "hang yourself with the
rope from a sugar bag and you will have a sweet death," but my
mother always said that a tsuker shtrikl was a string made of sugar.

I'm a relatively new "member" of Mendele who, by virtue of
ignorance, hasn't had anything to contribute, at least until I saw
Dovid Ber Katz' query. By way of introduction, I grew up in the
Bronx, in a home where Yiddish was the language the parents used
when they didn't want the kids to know what they were talking about.
Naturally, I picked up a fair amount that way, but haven't used it,
or even heard it spoken since childhood (yes, that was long enough
ago that significant erosion has occurred...).

But--Bob Werman please take note--I am avid reader by avocation. I
have read many of the great Yiddishists in translation, and finally
decided that I wanted to be able to appreciate them fully, to be
able to read them in the originals. So I have been learning Yiddish
with the goal of being able to read at least Bashevis Singer's
children's stories. At the rate I'm going, I have a long long road
ahead of me: I'm still at the "Moishele and Gitele gayt in shul"
level. However, Mendelnik and linguist and literary adventurer Khaim
Bochner has graciously been teaching Yiddish to a small group of us
here in the Boston area. While my classmates and I have not yet
become fluent, we know lots more than we knew three months ago, so
we're all very optimistic.

Subject: Re: lit vs. lx on mendele

i've had a thought as to why there's so much more linguistic stuff
on mendele than literary--maybe it's because so many more linguists
have email--and therefore access to mendele-- than literature
specialists? i was thinking of a woman at penn, katherine
hellerstein, who would be great for discussing lit, but she
doesn't/won't have an email account... just a thought. (p.s. harry,
she'd also be excellent for the translation job and would certainly
know what the going rate is--she's done quite a bit of
yiddish-to-english translation. i'll ask her, if i can find her.)

Subject: farfrorene dativn; idiomen mit "ay"

Mark Pinson, identifying "toytn" in "helfn vi a toytn bankes" as a
dative (incidentally "cupping" = "SHTELN bankes".  At least that's
what the signs said in my old Brooklyn neighborhood:  mir shteln
bankes) asks about other `frozen' datives.  I don't know what might
qualify as frozen; but when my mother would ask her loudmouthed
brother-in-law, "ir vilt efsher a shtikl frukht?", he'd bellow, "a
krankn fregt men, a gezuntn git men!"

******************

Idiomatic "ay":

1.  "ay [shtumer alef-pasekh tsvey yudn] (...) ?" = "but how would I
respond to the objection that (...) ?"  U. Weinreich gives the
example "er is greyt. ay far vos geyt er nit?  vayl ..."  This is a
curious usage; can someone explain its origin?

2.  UW also gives "ay-ay-ay" [emphasis on the last ay] =
"wonderful!", and "nit azoy ay-ay-ay" = "not so hot".  The latter
was the more common bay undz in der heym.
