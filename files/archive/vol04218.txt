Subject: Nishdogedakht

I'm with Meyshe-Yankl on this one.  Growing up with a Belarussian (NE
Belarus) Bubbe, it was NishDOgedakht that I heard.  Micky Katz, that
inimitable source of good proste Yiddish, but hailing from what roots I
know not, pronounces it the same way in his "Rock Arum Di Klok"
.....Rock'n un Bak'n nishdogedakht.... on the album, the Most Meshuge
Mickey Katz.

Subject: NidOgedakht

No question in my mind that Dovid Braun _is_ right. What interests me now
is the process which led me to my own misinterpretation. Mixed marriages
sensitizes the children  to dialectal nuances as nothing else can, but
apparently they can also lead them down the garden path. Faced with
"nidUg@dakht" and "nitOgedakht" (with a strongly aspirated "t", as I
recall), the latter analagous to "(nit)Ogevashn", "(nit)Ogedavnt", I made
the wrong choice-- reinforced, I think, by another factor: The
"nidUg@dakht" side of the family would normally have said "dU:" 'here'
with long, stressed [u:].

Nuff said.

Subject: Nishdogedakht

My mother (zol zi lebn biz a hundert un tsfantsik) was born in Slutsk,
making her an arch-Litvakeh.  She peppers her English-language
conversation with "nishdogedakht" at least two or three times a day.  As
a callow youth, I secretly felt this was a very narrow, provincial
attitude, like the person walking home who sees a fire-truck stopping
somewhere on his block and prays that it's not _his_ house that's on fire
(better it should be my neighbor's!).  I much preferred the version of my
mother's older sister (zol zi oikhet lebn biz 120), "Nisht af keinem
gedakht", which seemed much more magnanimous.  However, I don't know if
this is mayn tanteh's a khidesh, or whether it's widespread. BTW, I
visited Slutsk this summer, and found between 50-100 Jews still
there--and those who speak Yiddish (more than I expected, including
younger folks) still speak with the same distinctive Litvishe accent.

Subject: sheygets

Mikhl writes expressing dissatisfaction with the theory that 'sheygets'
is derived from Heb. 'sh q ts.' > > I know of _no_ instance in which
Yiddish retains the Hebrew-like spelling > implied by the absence of
vowel letters, while "presuming" to alter the > traditional spelling of
the Hebrew consonants.

I have a related question.  Even if the singular does not seem to fit the
pattern, does the plural, 'shkotsim' not do so?  Does this not provide
prima facie evidence for the theory of a Hebrew origin, with the unusual
nature of the singular to be explained on some other basis (other than
positing a non-Hebrew origin)?

Or is the suggestion that in the case of the plural, we have a standard
Hebraicization of a non-Hebrew word; hence a plural consistent with the
rules explained by Mikhl in his posting.

Subject: archiving shkotzim/Chicago YIVO/dissertation on names

For your archivist, index-maker, cross-referencer:

the spate of articles on sheygetz should be - for those who came in late
- cross-referenced to the spate on shiksa of a year or more ago.

Meyshe-Yankel Sweet:  Yes, there is a Chicago YIVO: The Chicago YIVO
Society, 141 West Jackson Boulevard, Suite 1910A, Chicago, IL, 60604,
phone (312) 435-2800,  fax  (312) 922-2465. (Dr. Jeffry Mallow, Chairman)

For answers to questions on Yiddish names, a more authoritative
source will be Rella Cohn's dissertation (in Linguistics, University of
Chicago).

Meyshe-Yankl Sweet:

I don't have the information about YIVO in Chicago at hand and
YIVO in NY is apparently no longer on the line but, if Howie
Aaronson is lurking, he might be able to supply you with an
address.

re: Atlas, Volume I

For people writing to me about copies: I will be away, Dec 8-23
but you can expect to hear from me as soon as I return.

Subject: Herzog's query

Michel Herzog asked whether there are any Hebrew words in Yiddish which
do not preserve the Hebrew orthography.  Wouldn't "tomer"="lest/should
you say" qualify?  I have the faint recollection of seeing it in the
correct Hebrew orthography in one of the Yiddish accompaniments to the
holiday prayer book.

Subject: reception of Yiddish theater in Germany, 1900-1933

I am looking for excellent scholarship, suggestions for a study on the
reception of Yiddish-language theater in Imperial and Weimar Germany,
particularly in the period between 1900 and 1923.

Thanks in advance,

David Brenner

Subject: Vi es kristelt sich...

Could somebody help me by explaining the context and any nuances of the
phrase "Vi es kristelt zich azoy men yidelt zich"?  What is the origin
and where might one say these words?
