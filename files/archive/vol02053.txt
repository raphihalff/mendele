Oy mame zey makhn khoyzek fun unzer farkilter fus. Az ikh
zitz do bayem kompyuter ken ikh nokh zen dayn shmeykhl afn
ponem un vi mir ale hobn gevart far dayn araynbrengn dem
teler mit der farkilter fus.  Di mame hot arayngeton eyer
un a sakh knobl.

Vi azoy ken zey makn khoyzek fun "The Jewish National
Dish"?

Noyakh, siz a shande!

Please forgive my delay in transmitting my feelings. The
only ceremony which can match it is the Piping in the
Haggis.  How can one even put these two delicacies in the
same sentence?  Yes, in our home the similarity would be in
the ceremony.  I can see everyone looking front and center
as mom came in, and how our salivary glands began to shift
into overdrive. Uncle Sam, Aunt Bella and the cousins all
came over when mom called, and told them we were having
farkilter fus far shabes.  I must be truthful.  No, my
darling wife does not make this delicacy.  She is a
marvelous lady, a beautiful person, a tremendous insurance
CSR, but she does not know how to make this delicacy. Alas,
all of you who have not developed the taste for this
delicacy do not know what you are missing.

Subject: Goyishe kop

No surprise if English-speakers (r-dropping New Yorkers,
maybe?) said "goyishe kop", even if they weren't Litvaks.
They can do such things with French, why not Yiddish?
There was a line of clothing sold in department stores some
time ago called "Petite Garcon".

Subject: Re: Lachoudisch

Looshen koydish is both written and oral. Its exact meaning
is difficult to ascertain. Some have propsed it is "the
language of the sanctuary" and have translated it as such.
Others see it as the language of the Holy One. Others as
"holy and pure language", containing no explicit words for
genitals. The early rabbis used the expression and may have
coined it. It used to be avoided in mea shaerim but in
recent years Hebrew is gaining ground and many young
hassidim speak it fluently. But many years ago I was in an
"Israeli" book store in mea shearim in Jerusalem. Two
hassidim were in the store haggling with the owner.

Finally one said in almost decent Hebrew-- arba sefarim (4
books i'm buying) -- his friend screamed, looshen koydish!
looshen koydish!-- Nu vus iz? and the screamer replied "in
looshen koydish meer toor nisht zoogen arba sefarim,  zoog
besser arba'a sfoorim." correcting his grammar.

Maybe we're finally veering towards agreement here.  I'm
surprised to hear you say that Country Yossi is played on
the radio as Yiddish music.  I have certainly never heard
it on the Yiddish hour on Toronto radio.  I know him only
through his tapes.

Of course it isn't Yiddish music.  Of the six tapes we
have, I can think offhand of only 3 or 4 songs that are
entirely in Yiddish (one is a Yiddish version of Allan
Sherman's "Hello Muddah, Hello Faddah" letter from camp --
how's that for takeoff of a takeoff?).  I call this kind of
music (Rechnitzer Rejects and Schlock Rock included )
"fruppie" music.

I would also temper somewhat the comment about "missionary
zeal in his proselytizing".  That's how it looks to you
from the outside, I'm sure, and if it's played on public
radio I'm sure that's how some of it will come across.  I
see it as aimed for the frum market, however, where
observance of mitzvos is a "given" in terms of human goals.
Thus, it's not proselytizing so much as an entertaining way
of dealing with and expressing existing goals.  For me, a
song about, say, how pleasant Shabbos is is descriptive
rather than prescriptive. And some of the takeoffs are just
plain funny.

The "Kivi and Tuki" tapes by Country Yossi, which are
specifically aimed at kids, are definitely on the
"prescriptive" side, along with Uncle Moishy, Torah Island,
613 Torah Avenue, Marvelous Midos Machine and lots of
others that have sprung up over the past few years.  That's
a different genre entirely, but again one which is mostly
aimed at kids *within* the frum world.

Subject: Untranslated plays

A student here would like to work on a Yiddish play which
has not been translated into English, or at least not
within the past 50 years or so.  He's especially interested
in the 10 one-act comedies by Sholem Aleykhem, or perhaps
something by Perets or our eponymous Mendele.  Does anyone
know whether those short plays of Sholem Aleykhem's (don't
you hate it when ignorant journalists or literary people
call him "Aleykhem", for short?!) have been translated (and
whether they're worth working on), or have any other
recommendations?
