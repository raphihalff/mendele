re: Michael Sweet's post

Having attended the Oxford Summer program last year, I know from
experience that all ages, nationalities, religions are welcome and
represented.  The age range last year was from 18 to 93, and all
ages interacted to everyone's benefit.  Many of the students were
retired couples who wanted to improve, learn, or use their Yiddish.
Perhaps half of the students were younger people (undergraduate and
graduate students 18-30) who were interested in Yiddish for their
studies.  Regardless of age, the students interacted and learned a
lot from each other.  I don't think anyone, of any age, would feel
out of place.

Subject: Zachary Baker

I wish to publically express my appreciation to Zachary Baker of
Yivo for all the years of superb service he has rendered us
Yiddishists outside of New York and when we visit his shrine. He has
done such wonderful service in helping us track down refenerences
and texts and sent them along speedily. His contributions to Mendele
are always invaluable and his modesty proves he is an ISH KHESED.
Were Yiddish Studies more populated with such sterling examples of
living Yiddishkayt!

Subject: re: Yiddish Text to Speech

I'm one of the people who developed DECtalk (small world, isn't it).
While there are a number of Yiddish phonemes that DECtalk doesn't
know about (and no way to add additional phonemes to the original
set), you could probably cobble together something that would be
better than nothing. If nothing else, Yiddish -> Roman alphabet
transliteration -> DECtalk would probably be minimally
understandable.

The core algorithms that DECtalk uses (The Klatt synthesizer) are
published, and there are C implementations that run on several
workstations. These are available on Internet. Be warned, however,
that to go from the algorithms to a working synthesizer for a new
language is a very difficult task (certainly worth a PhD) as you
must essentially develop a theory of the linguistics for that
language. You'd need a decent workstation, too.

Yiddish could be a very interesting language to develop a
text-to-speech system for since its vocabulary derives from several
language families. It's been about ten years since I worked on
DECtalk, but I'd be happy to try to answer any specific questions
you might have.

Subject: Index to Yiddish Periodicals

I thought that the following might be of interest to Mendelniks.

The Index to Yiddish Periodicals is available to ALEPH searchers who
can display Hebrew characters. (ALEPH is the online catalog of five
major Israeli universities.)  This Index is put out by  by Professor
Abraham Nowersztern of the Yiddish Department at Hebrew University.

Currently seven periodicals/newspapaers are represented in this
Index: Idishe Vokhenblat, Haynt (Warsaw), Haynt (Ekstre oysg.),
Haynt (Byalage), Haynt: mitog oysg., Der Moment (Warsaw), Der
Moment: mitogblat.  Searchable indexes include author, title, and
subject. To access the Index to Yiddish Periodicals, searchers need
to telnet RAM1.HUJI.AC.IL.

Subject: Introduction

I am a native speaker of Yiddish (which used to be called Jewish,
and is still called Juif in French) and as a child took post-school
training in the language for a few years, to the point where I can
read and write it now, though only with difficulty.  As a professor
of Mathematics, I learned German and the two languages interfere
with each other in my mind, so that I speak a very juedisch German
and a very daitschish Yiddish.  I have found Yiddish speakers all
over Europe and even in Israel, where the language survived a
vicious assault by Hebraists in the 30s & 40s and is now so dead
that it can be the subject of an attempted restoration.

I have been interested for some decades in the possibility of
creating a genuine transliteration scheme which would be a
letter-for-letter transposition rather than an attempt to
reconstruct the sound of the language in English language
conventions.  I am looking for something which would enable a typist
to transcribe the language without having to be able to read it.  I
do think that for those who do not read Hebrew, the letters are a
major bar to learning Yiddish.

I also have a small interest in Ladino, having studied Spanish in
HS, but there seems to be even less Ladino around than Yiddish.
