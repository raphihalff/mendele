Subject: dreyt zikh arum...

	Excuse my ignorance, but I don't get it.  In the phrase,
"dreyt zikh arum vi a farts in rosl": vi kimt a farts tzum rosl?
Rosl is brine, no?

	As the gabbai in our shul, I once heard it differently. One
of the older congregants complained to me about this child who
wandered around the shul aimlessly, disturbing everyone in his path:
"Er dreyt zikh arum vi a farts in vaneh".  Now that's a moshl!

**********************

	A programmer colleague of mine from Riga, Mitya Yakirevitch,
just taught me how to say the phrase "GIGO" (garbage in, garbage
out), in Yiddish:

	"mishigene gentz, mishigene gribenes".

Subject: hobn nekome oyf di vantzen

My favorite proverb:

Er hot nekome oyf di vantzen az dos hoyz brent. (He has his revenge
on the bedbugs as his house is on fire.)

1. Hershel Bershady notes: <When anyone announced to my grandparents
some deed, accomplishment, so-called important event that my
grandparents thought didn't amount to much, they would say, "Shtel
sikh rakkhim!" My mother explained to me that this meant "Go stand
on your head.">

I think this is really "rakem" glossed by Weinreich as "supine, face
down" and by Harkavy ("rakom") as "crab- like, on all fours".  In
our house the implication was clearly "with butt in the air".  I can
remember erev Rosheshone 1938 or 1939.  My father was listening to
WNYC, the radio station of New York City, which was presenting a
musical program in honor of the Jewish "High Holy Days"
[irreverently retranslated into Yid- dish by my uncles as "di hoykhe
yontoyvim"].  He emerged gleefully to inform us that they had just
announced that Cantor So-and-So would now sing rakem. (The announcer
had mispronounced "Rakheym".)

2. The suggestion by Bob Hoberman's friend, David Ebin concerning
the etiology of "beyze vyetchere" is bril- liant and, I dare say,
correct.  I'd be interested to know whether the phrase occurs other
than in the expression "ikh zol azoy visn fun a ......"?

And how do we know he is beating his head against the brick wall?
What is the p roverb?  I also recalled of course Gey shlug dein kopp
in vent.

From: Seymour Axelrod <PTYAXEL@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu>
Subject: Nokh etlekke idyomen far R'Elyes reshime

(A vort frier:  I'm glad that Elye remembered "folg mir a gang" as
expressing a `disinclination to undertake an effort disproportionate
to the result.'  Now that I think about it, that's the meaning I
recall, rather than "it's a long distance [or time]"  [U.
Weinreich's and Y. Mark's usage.])

Also, Elye's "a glik *hot* mir getrofn" now sounds as good to my ear
as "a glik *iz* mir getrofn".  I may well have misremembered.)

1.  "oder gor, oder gornisht" = "oder dray, oder draytsn"

2.  "glat azoy [in der velt arayn]" = for no apparent reason, at
random, irrelevantly

3.  "a yid fun a gants yor" = (I think) an ordinary Jew [person];
stam a yid [mentsh]

4.  "a terets far di bentshlikht" = a pretext, a phony excuse.  I
don't recall hearing this in person.  In a recording of "Di megile
fun itsik manger" (the one with the Bursteins, music by Dov
Seltzer)--probably also in Manger's text, which I don't have to
hand--Vashti refuses Akhashveyresh's command to come to his party
naked, saying that her teeth hurt.  Homen-haroshe tells the king
(correctly) "s'iz a terets far di bentshlikht, di mayse mit di
tseyn."  I have no idea how the expression came to mean what it
does.
