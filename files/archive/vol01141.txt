in response to dave:

re the idea about geveyzn at the end of the verb phrase and
geven in the middle, that's a nice project! i believe old
yiddish had only geveyzn, and we know that old yiddish was
verb final. it would be interesting to check on the rise of
geven, whether it occurred only medially, i.e. where it was
destressed, as yiddish became verb-medial. beatrice, do you
have an undergraduate who needs a little topic? the data
you got already...

re the lack of negative concord in kenehore as a result of
the fact that it's not a full sentence, sorry, but modern
yiddish has negative concord in simple noun phrase or
adverbial utterances (in contrast to french, black english,
piedmontese...):

ver iz gekumen?
keyner nisht/*keyner.

vemen host du gezen?
keynem nisht/*keynem nisht.

ven host du dos gezen?
keynmol nisht/*keynmol.

(the '*' means 'does not occur'.)

so it looks like david braun's explanation is still the
most plausible: kenehore must have been frozen way back in
old yiddish, before yiddish acquired negative concord.
(there's phonological evidence for that, as well.)

re dort being from der ort and tsurik from tsu rik, that's
extremely plausible, but it should be noted that it would
have happened way back in germanic, long before the birth
of yiddish. (however, analogous developments that i
believed happened in yiddish are drerd, from der erd, and
staytsh, from dos taytsh.)

>There are a couple in English, incidentally, that sort of
>caught me by surprise when I first noticed them.
>"painstaking" is, of course, pains + taking, but there's a
>tendency to think of it as pain + staking, which doesn't
>contribute anything to the meaning. Second, "dishevelled"
>is from the French deshabille', and is dis-helleved, not at
>all related to the dish.

ah, here's a nice illustration of the difference between
the methodology of folk etymology and of historical
linguistics. dave's note that dishevel comes from
deshabille surprised me, since that's not how those sounds
should have developed (given how they developed in other
english words borrowed from french). so i looked it up and
in fact it's not related to deshabille. here's what
webster's third says:

dishevel: back-formation from disheveled disheveled: middle
english discheveled, transitive participle of middle french
deschevele', from old french, past participle of
descheveler, to disarrange the hair, from dis- + cheveler
(from chevel, hair of the head, from latin capillus).

go know...

In Mendele Vol 1.138, Khayim Bochner refers to "The Yiddish
Teacher" as a possible textbook. Here's a reference:

        The Yiddish Teacher
	author: Hyman E. Goldin
	copyright 1939 Hebrew Publishing Company
	ISBN 0-88482-687-2

The publisher's address is 100 Water Street, Brooklyn NY
11201.

It's a basic "Learn the fundamentals of Yiddish" -- there
are some 60 short lessons, each with a vocabulary, a few
paragraphs of text, and some "translate into Yiddish" or
"translate into English" exercises. Harvard Hillel used it
for an introductory adult-education course. The vocabulary
index has about 400 words.

It should be suitable as an adult education textbook, with
a competent instructor of course, but I wouldn't recommend
it -- by itself -- as either a self-study book (little
exposition) or as a college textbook.

Subject: Yiddish in Cairo

I am really excited to see the interest in Yiddish in
Egypt. I would have written sooner, but I have been on
jury duty.
 
I can add a few bits of information to Yuda-Leyb's list on
Yiddish theater actors and actresses in Cairo. Rose Klein
was the person that I was closest to in Cairo. SHe was
actually Rose Weiss-Klein. Born in Cairo in 1909. Later
married Abraham Belahovsky. Abraham died in 1977 or 1978.
Rose remained in Cairo until late 1981/1982 when she
emigrated to Isrel. She died in Tel Aviv in Spring 1989.
The Peindrik sisters emigrated to the United States. At
least one of them was living in Cleveland as late as 1983.
 
I am quite familiar with the Ashkenazi synagogue in Cairo.
After it was burned down in 1945 it was reconstructed in
1952. The Ashkeanzi community held separate services until
1967 by which mose Ashkenazim had left  Cairo. They then
attended services at the main downtown Cairo synagogue on
Adli Street. The Ashkenazi synagogue has been closed since
1967. It is in fair condition. The Gan Yeladim imediately
adjacent to the building was in poor condition in 1983 and
I expect it may have been demolished by now.

re: Yiddish printing in Egypt, I have seen books printed
by the Farag Mizrahi press in Alexandria, but cannot
remember the titles. There was an Imprimerie Moscovitch in
the Jewish Quarter (Haret al-Yahud) Aside from the theatre
programs ( I have a few myself from Cairo and Alexandria)
the only other printed Yiddish I am familiar with is
Yiddish/French sheet music and a broadside here and there
advertising a visiting cantor for the holidays.

re: Jewish life in Egypt in general, ther are perhaps
50-75 Jews left in Cairo and approximately the same number
in Alexandira. The average age is over 70. Maybe one or
two intermarried Jews left in Port Said. There were still
at least 14 synagogues standing in Cairo and suburbs when
I left in 1983, not including 2 Karaite synagogues.
Alexandria had three remaining that I am famil iar with.
Port Said, one...just a shell. Mansoura one... used as a
mattress storage facility.

The Jewish community in Egypt was very diverse. Sephardim
came from all over the Ottoman empire and Ashkenazim from
all over Europe. Even a couple of immigrants from the
United States! I probably have more information on the
individual actors Yuda-Leyb has mentioned and will try to
dig it up.
