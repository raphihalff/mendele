the whole message is naive, no offense being meant to the
sender. I guess you Americans do not always realise it, but
the origin of the name Dollar is the _austrian_ Thaler --
and don't forget, Galicia used to be in the Austro-
Hungarian Empire. So there is nothing surprising that it be
called "tuler" in Yiddish. As for the daled becoming a tes
(or rather, if the original Hebrew pronounciation hadn't
been corrupted, a tuv -- phonologically the real english
th-sound) -- or its converse -- it is a very well-known
phenomenon in phonology: cf 'ten' in English vs 'dix' in
French, whatever the original indo-european might have
been.

Moreover, here in Alsace (the real birth-place of Yiddish!)
as in many other German speaking provinces in Europe, one
hears frequently "mispronounciation" of 'd' which becomes
't' (but _not_ vice-versa!). As for the kumets-alef-u
phenomenon it's too widely known to go into it;
nevertheless may I remind the netters that the original
kamats was _not_ pronounced 'ah' but a cross between 'oh'
and 'ah' -- cf the Teimani pronounciation still heareable
in Israel (mebbe not for long, the Sabra accent being,
alas, taken over by the new generations).

Let me add that this phenomenon is not particular to
Yiddish: we see it in English the other way round from 'oo'
to 'ah'(the word 'shut' has 'u', originally 'oo',
pronounced 'ah') and the same way from 'oh' to 'oo' (the
word 'do' has original 'oh' pronounced as 'oo'). Many, many
more examples could be shown, but I do not feel like giving
a course in phonology -- for which I anyway lack the
competence. All this reminds me of the recent debate about
folk-etymology...

	moishe nussen: what kind of yiddish DO you speak?
 
my Yiddish is Galitsianer, prost in pushet, the language of
my illiterate, poverty-stricken, superstitious and naive
forbears; but mine they were, and I want to pass on the
heritage as it was, without embellishments.
 
        not being very fluent in the language, unusual (to
        me) accents can play havoc with my comprehension.
        in particular, the two words below stumped me.
 
I gather that Noie`h (or should it be Noyekh?) will post my
introductory message to the list (after editing), but let
me recall what I told him: transcription of Yiddish makes
no sense for me, sehot kain tam, since one must use Latin
alphabet in its poorest form (not even accents we have in
all european languages except English). I am too old to
learn YIVO or Litvak or 'standard' (but who sets up the
standard?) transcription, so I use the veriest phonetic
one, except for ONE letter: I render the "`hes"(8th letter
of the hebrew alphabet) by "`h", since for me (who know
many Sepharads over here) it is definitely not the same
letter as "khuf" (11th letter of the alef-bais); when I
don't forget about it, in words of Hebrew origin, I also
use the ` for the "`ayin". I shall also be sparse with
quotes, simple or double. Of course the vowels are the most
typical part of Galitsianer,they have been explained
somewhere on Mendele or on mail.yiddish [Reb Noie`h, please
give the exact reference]

Akaide" is the word you might render by "akedah" in Hebrew
(modern pronounciation!) and it is the sum of events
related in the Toire (or Torah?), I believe in parshes Lekh
lekhu, that led up to the (non-)sacrifice of Isaac. Its
original meaning is: binding-up. Grazen" means errors;
Noie`h mit zibn grazen means spelling Noie`h (a two-letter
word in Hebrew) with 7 mistakes.

        also, i understand the words of the third
        expression, but not its meaning in your context.
        can you help me out?
 
"Bekhol doir vudoir" (sorry, I 'misspelt' the 1st word) is
what the Passover Hagudeh (ie Hagadah, I guess in YIVO)
says should be done about reciting the Seder; it means: in
every generation. I used it to mean just that.
 
Last, I guess Borok would be written in my transcription
Burekh.

RE: Di yidishe khile in mitsrayim...

I, for one, would be most interested in what you have to
say about the Jewish community in Cairo.
