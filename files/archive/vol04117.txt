attitude!  2. Yiddish for pomegranate is milgroym, plural: milgroymen.
3. I have never heard the title rov for a Rabbi thought of as demeaning
in any way...

Elliot Hersch Gertel

PPS: While also sharing Lou's attitude about boors vis-a-vis Orange
County (where I find myself in goles) I have to admit I have found
anti-Yiddish sentiments even in far more enlightened corners of the
world!

Subject: Re: Rov/Rabay

I agree that we should minimize pejorative words about other Jews.  In
this case, however, it is the non-Orthodox Rabbis who are described with
the pejorative term.  Hundreds of years ago, a Rabbi was a "rov" in
Yiddish, period.  Yiddish-speaking and Hebrew-speaking Orthodox Jews
started using the term English term "rabay" to express the notion that
non-Orthodox Rabbis were not really Rabbis.

Subject: Pomegranate, gut yontef, a mystery, etc.

I've been away for a while and am just catching up. Briefly:

1. Of Zellig Bach. I quote a novel I've just finished reading (Maichael
Ondaatje _The English Patient_. Vintage, 1993.) Speaking of respondents
to a lecture, he writes of them as "pertinently critical but never
impertinent". A fitting description of Dr. Bach, a rarity in our midst.

2. Earlier queries about Zamosc and Chelm

Both lie within the boundaries of Central Yiddish (i.e. "Polish
Yiddish"): gayn, kimen, shlufn, leybn, tsa:t, houis, etc.

3. Dan Leeson:

'pomegranate' in Yiddish is "milgroym". Why the puzzle and the implied
connection to the word for 'orange'?

4. Shleyme Axelrod:

Just ruminating: None of the Yiddish greetings with "gut"-- gut shabes,
gut yontef, gut yor--displays a gender inflection; or do they all? As you
say, "yor" is neuter, and the uninflected "gut" is to be expected, but
what of the other two? They're certainly masculine--der shabes (despite
the Hebrew feminine) and der yontef--but, were they always so? I don't
know about them in particular, but I do know that at an earlier stage of
the language, Hebrew origin words were generally integrated as neuters in
Yiddish: dos seyfer, dos mes, dos ponim, etc. They subsequently shifted
gender categories (and today, only very few words are borrowed into the
neuter: dos pensl, dos baysikl). Can we assume that "gut shabes" and "gut
yontef" reflect earlier neuters stuck in this particular context?
Probably not in view of two other expressions with non-Hebrew
masculines: i) Doesn't Bashevis write "kurts-fraytik"? ii) The very
earliest documented full-blown Yiddish sentence (in the makhzer of Worms,
1272) begins with the words "gut tog". It looks like something else is
going on here.  End of rumination.

4. A mystery.

In a book recently published in Germany (Igor Trutanow, _Zwischen Koran
und Coca Cola_. Aufbau Taschenbuch Verlag, Berlin, 1994), the author, on
a journey through the central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union,
writes (p. 131) of police activity as "dem schmon unterziehen". "Schmon
bedeutet 'Durchfilzen'. Dieses Jargonwort hebraeischer Herkunft kam ueber
das Jiddische ins Gulag-Russische. Die multinationale Gulag-Belegschaft
fuehrte das Wort in die jeweiligen Muttersprachen ein."

"Durchfilzen" seems to refer to something like a body-search. "Schmon"?
Hebrew-origin? Anybody?

A gut un gezunt yor aykh alemen.

Mikhl Herzog
