Subject: Khatskele (Orem iz nit gut)

The song or poem requested is a folk song found in a nuber of collections
e.g. such as Ruth Rubin's A Treasury of Jewish Folksongs. Then words are:

Chorus:
Orem iz nit gut, Orim iz nit gut
Lomir zich nit shemen mit eygenem blut.

1:
Khatskele, khatskele shpil mir a kazatskele
khotch an orime, abi a khvatske.

2:
Khatskele, khatskele, shpil mir a dume
Un khotch an orime abi a frume.

3:
Nit kayn gebetene, aleyn gekumen.
Khotch an orimke, fort a mume.

4:
Khatskele, khatskele shpil-zhe mir a semele
Far a drayeerl oyf khatske's kremele.

Subject: Orem iz nit gut (Khatskele)

Dorian (Dovid Moishe) Goldstein asked in 4.357 about a song that his
father remembered in part.

Sarah Pitkowsky Schack's collection _Yiddish Folk Songs_ (New York, 1924)
contains a similar text (her transliteration standardized):

		Nit keyn gebetene, aleyn gekumen,
		Take an oreme fort a mume.

			Orem iz nit gut,
			Orem iz nit gut,
			Lomir zikh nit shemen
			Mit eygenem blut.

		Sore di rebetsin, di kales a mume,
		Take an oreme fort a frume.

		Khatskele, Khatskele, shpilt mir a kazatskele,
		Khotsh an oreme, abi a khvatskele.

		Nat aykh a peyem, shpilt mir a zemele,
		Khaneles khosele heyst dokh Avremele.

	(Harkavy defines _peym_ as a 3-groshn coin.)

Ginzburg and Marek's _Evreiskie narodnye pesni v Rossii_ (St. Petersburg,
1901; reprinted by Bar-Ilan University under Dov Noy's editorship in
1991) contains several variant stanzas under #254 (with Andrew Cassel's
grandfather listed as one of the informants):

		Nit keyn gebetene
		aleyn gekumen--
		khotz an oreme,
		fort a mume.

		[Sorele di rebetsin,
		di kales a mume,
		nit keyn gebetene
		aleyn gekumen.]

		Gegebn a peymele--
		tsugenumen:
		shpilt a semene
		far a mumen.

		[Shpilt mir a semene,
		nit keyn kazatske,
		ikh bin an oreme,
		ober a khvatske!

		Nat aykh a peyem,
		shpilt mir a semele,--
		Khaneles khosele
		ruft men Avremele.

		Nat aykh a peyem,
		shpilt mir a kazatske,
		ikh bin an oreme,
		ober a khvatske!]

Subject: Bobe-zeyde

Devorah Halperin Biasca:

Although the dictionary (U. Weinreich's) lists only _zeyde-bobe_, I've
come across _bobe-zeyde_ much more frequently.  There's one with the
woman first.

Subject: History of _gel_ 'yellow' and _fuftsn_

Does anybody know how comes it that Yiddish 'yellow' is (in most
dialects) _gel_, as opposed to German _gelb_?  What's it like in
German/Dutch... dialects?

And does anybody (it doesn't have to be the same person) know why
(Northeastern) Yiddish has [fin(e)f] but [fuftsn], not *[fiftsn]?

Thanks in advance!

Subject: Krupin dictionary

I have just received a letter from Manuel Krupin, 11431 Clover Ave., Los
Angeles, CA. 90066, USA.  Tel. No. 310-391-9659, announcing the
reprinting of his father N. Krupin's _Hantbukh fun hebreizmen in der
yidisher shprakh_ Buenos Aires: IKUF, 1957. He would like advice on
distributing the book to interested parties.    Mit di beste grusn,

Subject: Yiddish Mac software

I know this has been discussed, but I wasn't interested in the subject at
the time, so zayt moykhl....

My colleagues at the Jewish Historical Institute are interested in
finding out about the availability of Yiddish-language word processing
softare for the Apple Macintosh.  They have recently acquired their first
computers from the Polish-German Foundation and tey are all Macs.  Any
and all suggestions would be appreciated.  If they can get these machines
up and running, then computer cataloguing of the archives (incl. valuable
diaries, Holocaust testimonies and literary works can finally begin in
earnest).

A sheynem dank un a freylekhn Purim, fraynt!

Subject: Yiddish greetings

In reply to mendelnik Turkel's request for more about "Vos machst du?":

When i ask an older friend (a Holocaust survivor) in shul...she always
replies "Ich mach nisht visindik" which is such a cute reply.. Several
folks i know always answer this one with a frage..." Nu, vos zol machn a
Yid?"  Some others answer me " Ich mach a lebn, danks Got!". Perhaps we
could list all the off-beat replies to "vos machst du"...aside from
"nisht azoy gut"..and other more pedestrian returns to this well worn
Yiddish greeting!.
