Sid Resnick argues about Vergelis's record as an editor and
that he should be forgiven any "sins" for his success in
sustaining Yiddish culture in the USSR.

And Critical Inquiry is also a fine literary journal I am
told.  But it publishes Edward Said's unscrupulous attacks
against Israel and non-Israeli Jews and other supporters of
Israel, all under the guise of literary scholarship.  Are
we to forgive that journal?

Joyce raised the question of the nature of an object of
beauty created by a man hacking in fury with no intention
of making art.

Are we to judge Vergelis by his intentions?  Which was
stronger?  Preserving Vergelis?  Or preserving Jewish
values and art?  Certainly not a clear issue.  I suggest
other means of judging him, not on his personal evaluation
of his accomplishments, not on his telling us how hard it
was under Breznev.  Did he strike out for freedom with
Breznev's death?  I see no sign of it.  Do you?
