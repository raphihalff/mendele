Subject: sneezes and toddlers

For a sneeze also, "a nizele aroys un a gezintele arayn".  Sneeze out and
health in. Also said for other similar corporeal phenomena. 

For todders see Ruth Rubin's collection put out by Folkways and Mark
Olf's Collection.

Subject: khoshever fodem

Khashiver Reb Marvin Meyer Engel,

A disparaging expression it is indeed. I still use it in the following form:
"Drek mit leiber mit kushern fudem" (my pronunciation is rather
peasant-like). It is meant to denigrate something, implying that it is not
what it seems to be. As I understand it, the kosher fodem - santified thread
- and the leiber - liver - being there just to conceal plain drek.

Subject: 'Koshere Fodim'

Khaver Engel freygt: Fun vanen kumt 'koshere fudim' [08.144]. 
The expression is: 'Kadokhes mit koshere fudim', and is a reply to
someone who deserves a 'nasty' repayment for a nasty or questionable deed
or action. Sometimes, when I was a bad kid, my mother would not serve me
a certain dessert, and would say: 'Kadokhes krigst du,  mit koshere
fudim'!! (how often have we seen kosher thread?)

In essence, it means that someone should get even more than nothing, he or
she could get a black hole in space...( a singularity!) What is kadokhes?

Subject: "Koshere fodem"

This in reply to Marvin Meyer Engel's question regarding "khoshever fodem"
and "Koshere fodem" in mendele vol.08.144.

While my Yiddish is still weak, it does seem like two different phrases. 
That is Khoshever would seem to mean important as it derives from the Hebrew
root chet shin bet : chashoov meaning important. Koshere does mean kosher. 
Fodem is a thread which would be neither important nor kosher. I remember
speeches often began (as my memory from childhood) with someone addressing
everyone as khoshever froind at weddings etc. Important friend would be a
respectful greeting, khoshever fodem would indeed be derogatory in that
case. I assume similarly the second phrasing is derogatory as it is a
nonsense phrase as thread cannot be kasher. 

Any other takes?

Subject: koshere (not khoshever) fodem

Marvin Engel asks the meaning of the idiom "koshere fodem." I cannot recall
a precise example of its usage, but I remember the context in which I heard
it used at home when I was a child. It went something like this:  For a long
time after a heated argument, perhaps with a neighbour, my mother brooded
about the matter, which the "nekstdorike" soon forgot. At a later time, the
neighbour, assuming that by now things were OK, asked to borrow some sugar.
My mother was not one to quickly forgive or forget, and recounting the
incident to one of us, said: "Tsiker vilt zi? Kh'vel zi gibn kadukhes!" (the
ague). If the argument was a serious one, it would be:  "Kh'vil zi gibn
kadukhes, mit kushere fudem, in a kleyn tepl!. All nonsense of course, but
very impressive at high volume and pitch, with appropriate gesticulation.
The ultimate expression of indignation.
