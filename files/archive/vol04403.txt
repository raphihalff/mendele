Subject: Yiddish on cd-rom

count me in as one of those who'd be thrilled to have yiddish lit (in
fact any yiddish texts) on cd rom. the problem i foresee is scanning it
in. for one thing, you need very clean texts, which i doubt is what would
be available, for the most part. more importantly, you'd need software
for scanning in yiddish. hebrew is available but that isn't going to be
very satisfactory as the probabilities of letter combinations are totally
different. if anyone knows of such software, please let's hear about it!
(i have a private interest in this, as well as a group one.) of course,
one could always type it all in... kha kha kha kha.

Subject: Yiddish on cd-rom

Indeed the technology required for efficient development and production
of a comprehensive Yiddish language and literature CD-ROM is available.
The serious difficulty is the text-entry and preparation. Even with
currently available scanning and Hebrew-Yiddish OCR (optical character
recognition) technologies, there would be an enormous amount of
editing/labor required. Sounds like a good project for Aaron Lansky and
the Yiddish Book Center.

Aside from the contents suggested by Noyekh Miller and Louis Fridhandler,
I believe the _Algemeine Entsiklopedie_, and a Tanakh in Yiddish, would
make important and interesting additions as well.

I'd be more than happy to lend technical expertise if someone is
seriously interested in coordinating such an enterprise.

Irving D. Goldfein

I would very much appreciate hearing from all Mendelyaner who use the
_Encyclopaedia Judaica_ and have comments, suggestions, preferences to
express with regard to the CD-ROM version. No promises made, but serious
attention will be paid to all communications. Please e-mail replies to
goldfein@ix.netcom.com

Subject: Yiddish-Russian/Russian-Yiddish dictionary

A visiting Israeli (ex-Moldavan) cousin is interested in a Y-R/R-Y
dictionary. I found out about two, a paperback sold at Victor Kamkin's
here in NYC and a hardback sold at the Workmen's Circle. Does anyone know
anything about such a dictionary? I don't even know if this is the same
book, in different formats.

My cousin's funds are limited, so I think he'd prefer a book that costs
$20-25, preferably less.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Mayses fun dem Brooklyner Shtetl

Our esteemed Reb Zellig Bach writes in 4.401 of tsadik, tsadeh, tsadek,
and the "tsadik in pelts", the impious pretender to piety.

This reminds me of an experience I think I should share with this group.

When I was 10 or 11, my mother (may she live and be well!), who to this
day sports a salty tongue, was excoriating a man who lived upstairs, and
said loudly before me what sounded like, "Oh, xxx, he's a real paid
tsadik!"

Now, I knew enough of the loshn koydesh to know what a tsadik was, and I
imagined that a paid one was something like Reb Zellig described- a
poseur who donned the airs of a sage when properly remunerated, or
perhaps only when there was something potentially in it for him: a
mercenary philosopher with wisdom for hire, all of which seemed fairly
subtle to me. Relating it to Reb xxx as I knew him, and why my mom would
call him this, spun my young mind in circles for quite a while.

Years later, upon prompting her to explain, I was dismayed to learn that
she was merely saying "peh-tsadeh", i.e., a "putz."

Subject: Peyger gelt

A contest: My father-in-law, tzu lange yorn, tells often of the
money-making opportunities in the Jewish neighbourhoods of Toronto in the
1930's. I've especially enjoyed his explanation of the concept of "peyger
gelt" (for the Galitzyaner: payger gelt). With apologies to sensitive
souls, it would be most interesting to hear proposed explanations. Anyone
care to guess?

It seems to me that ongepatched means "overdone," as in wearing too much
jewelry or being over-fancy in the house.
