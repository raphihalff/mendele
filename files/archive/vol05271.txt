Subject: Gordin's _Mirele Efros_

In the film version of Jacob Gordin's _Mirele Efros_ there is a comic scene
in which Mirele's mekhutn tries to explain to a group of peasants, in
Russian, why he lost a crop of flax and has nothing to sell them.  The
peasants either don't understand his Russian or don't understand his
explanation, and he feels he has no choice but to repeat his speech twice,
word for word, but shouting it more loudly each time.  Does anybody know if
this scene was included in stage productions of _Mirele Efros_ in the years
when the play was a standard part of the Yiddish repertory?

Subject: "In Yiddish it sounds better" revisited, or "Az me git, nem!"

A short while ago I allowed myself a small tantrum [5.247] directed against
Dalya Yairi (not Meiri, apologies for the error), a popular Israeli radio
interviewer.  Her attitude toward Yiddish as expressed in her few remarks was
clearly patronizing, though she herself might be surprized at the accusation.
The expression "It sounds better in Yiddish" is an Israeli commonplace, a
deeply entrenched segment of Israeli folklore one might say.  In most
contexts, the claim is that the joke/anecdote/proverb/saying/story/expression
is "funnier" in Yiddish, or at the least, "juicier" (_yoter asisi_).  One
unfortunate effect of repeatedly assigning to Yiddish the quality of
humourousness is to stereotype a language which, like all languages, operates
in numerous registers.  But it can be objected that Yiddish humor is rich and
that the Yiddish language itself as well as the culture of which it is an
integral part, has specific humor-enrichening strategies, devices, forms, etc.

In a recent review of the week's television programs in the prestige morning
paper, _Ha-Arets_ (p. 8B, I believe the issue of 1 March 1996), Yoram
Brunovski makes a witty and telling use of the "It sounds better in Yiddish"
gambit that is far from expressing condescension towards Yiddish.  He thus
provides me with an opportunity to modify my possibly strident attacks on what
I have called "ludicizing Yiddish" -- trivializing it (see my earlier
_Mendele_ notices on "Ludic Yiddish").

For those of you who do not know of Yoram Brunovski, I can first of all assure
you that he is no "Yoram" ('nerd').  He is in fact an intellectual powerhouse.
In the course of refuting the novelist A.B. Yehoshua's foolish notion of
discouraging American Jewish financial support to Israel, Brunovski wrote:
"Chochma yehudit atika more lanu: 'Im notnim lecha, kach'.  Beyidish ze nishma
mamash tov, veyitachen lechora sheze shoresh hainyan:  Kechol sheheyvanti,
mekave a"b yehoshua, al yedey dechiyat trumoteyhem shel yehudim -- ach
hayitachen?  -- laasot lechizuka shel halashon haivrit!"  ('Ancient Jewish
wisdom teaches us: 'If someone gives you something, take it!'  This really
sounds good in Yiddish, and apparently that is the root of the matter:  As I
understand it, A.B.  Yehoshua hopes that rejecting Jewish gifts -- could he be
serious?  -- will contribute to the strengthening of the Hebrew language!')

This remark is intelligible if you know that  1) in a recent letter to
_Ha-Arets_ A.B.  Yehoshua suggested (at least half-seriously) that American
Jews keep the several hundred million dollars normally raised for Israel at
home and spend them on teaching Hebrew and  2) Yehoshua is of Sefardi
background.  (Such a program conceivably might start a major exodus from
Israel by Israelis hungry for lucrative jobs teaching Hebrew to American Jews
who are dying to learn Hebrew in order to read Yehoshua in the original!)
Actually, even a fraction of several hundred million dollars spent on Yiddish
language instruction in America would yield gratifying results -- would teach
students to read a Sholem-Aleykhem story in Yiddish in a single semester;
moreover, the serious Yiddish student invariably goes on to study Hebrew.  But
those who agonize about the Future of the Jewish People -- an occupation fast
becoming an industry these days -- seem incapable of accepting so simple a
pedagogic reality.

But to return to less somber matters.  What is the precise form of the Yiddish
expression that Brunovski recognizes as somehow more tangy, more racy, more
biting than its Hebrew correlate?  Yiddish has scores of expressions on the
subjects of giving and taking.  Is Brunovski thinking of something as simple
and brusque as "Az me git, nem!" or of one of its many elaborations (e.g. "Az
men git nem, az men nemt -- shray gevald!"). [in Stutchkoff, "Nemung", No. 481
and in I. Bernstein, Warsaw 1908, p. 57]. If one prefers the assistance of
rime, he can choose something more tart like "Ruf mikh yoshke, ruf mikh moshke
-- abi gib di groshke!" [in Stutchkoff, "Gebung", No. 479].  If you wish to
assist Yehoshua you can sabotage the UJA with: "A nar git, a kluger nemt" [in
Stutchkoff, No. 481].  Yiddish turns of phrase on the themes of giving and
taking are as various as Yiddish itself; they can be cynical and smartalecky
and they can be serious and heartwarming.  One of my favorites is the first
listed by Bernstein under "geb(e)n": "Az men git nit yankevn, git men eysevn"
(What you don't give to Jacob, you give to Esau).

Subject: Kemp Nitgedayget

Located on the shores of the Hudson in Beacon, NY, kemp nitgedayget was an
adult "resort"--a tent city, actually, for many years--that continued into the
1950s (I believe) as "Camp Beacon." S. J. Perelman, in a hilarious 1930s piece
that was republished in an anthology of _Esquire_ magazine, had a line that
went something like: "I love you," he said, "like...like...like a two week
vacation in Camp Nitgedayget!"

(BTW: Itsik Goldenberg should be aware that in addition to the children's
camps boyberik and hemshekh, there were two other Yiddishist camps, both of
which still exist, though with less emphasis on Yiddish: Camp Kinderland in
Toland, MA and Circle Camp in Hopewell Junction, NY.)
