Subject: _Mamele_
 
In MENDELE Vol 2.38, David Sherman writes that
 
One thing I find unfortunate is that the credits list the
actors but don't say who was who.  In Mamele, for example,
I know Molly Picon was Mamele, but I don't know who the
others were.  Who played her father?  Who played the fellow
she was in love with?  Are there complete lists anywhere?
 
In at least one case, Waszynski's _Dibek_, at least one
lead would have preferred that there be no credits at all:
the late Dine Halpern,  whom I had the pleasure of
interviewing in the mid- 1970s, retained the stage actress'
distain for "movis," and never did understand--that is,
chose not to understand--why the scholarly community kept
pestering her about a (well-paying) gig as Fradl, when she
had devoted her considerable talents toward developing a
"better" Yiddish theatre. That attitude may have been
generational, since the romantic leads were quite content
to have starred in the one (near-)classic of Yiddish
cinema.
 
Eric Grossman's 1979 dissertation (NYU), "A World History
of the Yiddish Cinema," contains an incomplete but
extremely valuable FIlmography. J. Hoberman's recent book,
_Bridge of Light: Yiddish Film between Two Worlds_, is now
the study of record; of the Yiddish-language film critics,
Filmikus (= ?) in the _Literarishe bleter_ and A. Filman (=
Dovid Matis) in the linke prese and, later, the _Forverts_,
are worth the time with the microfilm.
 
Circling round to _Mamele_, Grossman's filmography (p. 229)
lists the cast, but not the roles they play. Hoberman
discusses _Mamele_, from which I gleaned the following:

Khavtshi Samet: Molly Picon
Khavtskhi's father: Max Bozyk
Max Katz: Menashe Oppenheim
Berta: Gertrude Bullman
the young musician: Edmund Zayenda

Subject: re: sexual intercourse.

The Yiddish word I remember, considered unmentionable
for the most part, for sexual intercourse was "trennen."

i'd heard about the non-relationship, but see this week's
philologus column in the english _forward_. (no, i'm not
assuming that the column is correct.)

Meshorer?  What does this mean (well, some of that was clear from
the rest of the article), and what's its derivation?

Does anyone know of a new book of translation of
Reisen,

Avraham Reisen, __The Heart-Stirring Sermon and Other
Stories__?  And of the publisher, Overlook?

Thanks.
