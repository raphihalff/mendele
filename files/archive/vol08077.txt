Subject: Grine Felder

In reply to Ida Selavan-Schwarcz's query as to where in New Jersey Grine
Felder was filmed, it was in Flemington, NJ in the '30s. A romantic story
about the life of rural Jews, it nevertheless stresses the value of working
on the land and encourages farming as a lifestyle. The timing was coincident
with the efforts of the Jewish agricultural society in helping new immigrant
move out of the cities where they were struggling and onto farms.  The first
successful and long lasting Jewish farm communities were established in New
Jersey. I recommend my Mendelayner friends to see my documentary film, The
Land Was Theirs (available from the National Center for Jewish Film in
Waltham, MA and from your local library). I use clips of Grine Felder in the
film. And while I am at it, I must also encourage readers to think about
investigating the Jewish farm experience in America. Jewish rural farm
communities were created all over the country but few know about this
because Jewish historians and social scientists have not investigated the
successful communities. Their efforts have been devoted almost entirely to
the failed communal experiments (which lasted at most 2 to 5 years) and thus
they reinforce the prevalent stereotype: Jews are not farmers, and when they
try, they fail. 

By the way, my book The Land Was Theirs (same title as the film) about one
Jewish farm community in New Jersey, Farmingdale, is available from the
University of Alabama Press. We need more community studies before
comparative analyses can be done.

Subject: Grine Felder

In response to the writer who would like to know where Grine Felder was
filmed, the answer is the old Fort Lee Studios on the New Jersey Palisades
overlooking the Hudson River.  What appeared to be an entire Eastern
European shteytl or dorf was constructed there and was used for several
Yiddish language films made in the 1930's.  This included one with Moyshe
Oysher, called "Der Vilner Balebeysl". (which was translated, I can't
understand why, as "Overture to Glory") and in which I appeared as a
meshoyrer ( choir boy) at the age of 5 or 6.  This was over 60 years ago,
but I still have a vivid reccollection of the couple of days of filming on
the Palisades.  I believe that fancy high rises now stand on those
Palisades, where those film sets once stood ( and where Perils of Pauline
was shot some 90 years ago ), and where the Palisades Amusement Park once
stood.

Subject: Bandure

There's a song I heard on WEVD long ago which goes like this: (unfortunately
I only know a few verses, and I'm mixing them in an artificial stanza) 

Fintster jn biter iz mir maan velt
Beral maane oygn  zenen mir farshtelt
Shenkt a nedUve, shenkt a nedUve
Khob a vaab mit kinder fir
Khob a vaab mit kinder fir
Shpil ikh mir of der bandure
a kalike der tate

I'm inferring it's a musical instrument. Tayere fraynt, dakht zikh mir az
efsher hob ikh gemakht toesn inem dozikn lid, un efsher veist emetser di
rikhtike verter.

Subject: bandure and mameloshn in the Senate race

Re: (1) Robert Goldbenberg's question about "bandure," and (2) unrelated
expression of concern about increasing frequency of bastardization of mama-
loshen by sundry political figures. 

(1) The word "bandura" is commonly used in Russian to describe large,
awkward objects. Webster's contains a reference to "bandore" ("bandurria" in
Spanish, "pandura" in Latin, and "pandoura" in Greek). According to
Webster's, bandore is "an ancient musical instrument somewhat like a
guitar." I always thought a "bandure" is somewhat like an overgrown
"balalayke." This could be just a matter of perspective. 

(2)  On another matter entirely, I hope Mendelianers who were outraged by
Monica Lewinsky's use of the word "schmucko" in a reference to the President
of the United States, will be similarly dismayed by Alfonse D'Amato's use of
the word "putzhead" to describe his opponent, Charles Schummer. While the
Starr report includes no attempt to define the dangerous Taleyne-Yiddish
fusion that produced "schmucko," D'Amato ventures deeper into linguistic
wilderness to attempt a definition of "putzhead." "The Yiddish word I used
to describe you at a private meeting means `fool,'" he wrote in a letter to
Schummer. (The Washington Post, Oct. 22). "You are trying to twist that into
a religious slur... I stand by my remark 100 percent." 

Could any of this possibly be good for the Yiddishists?

different variants of lute.

Subject: Bandure/Bandore/Bandura/Bandurria

In response to Itzik Goldenberg's inquiry concerning the derivation of the
word "bandure" (or "bandore"), according to a handy compendium by Eberhard
Thiel, "Sachwoerterbuch der Musik" ("Dictionary of Musical Terminology"),
the "bandura" (as spelled in this source) is a plucked instrument similar to
the mandolin, particular to the Orient and Slavic countries.  The number of
strings varies, but the norm involves 6-8 stopped strings together with a
number of offboard or drone strings.  A Polish variant with 15 strings is
mentioned ("panskaja"), as well as a Ukrainian derivative.  And bringing us
somewhat away from the pale there is also mention of a Spanish version of
this instrument, known as the "bandurria," up until the 18th century a
favorite folk instrument in Spain and still performed upon today. 
    
Somewhat coincidental to this question, several weeks ago, while receiving a
Sunday morning haircut in my neighborhood in Forest Hills, I learned that
the person cutting my hair was an emigre from Kiev and that as a child she
played a folk instrument that she called a bandura.  I at first thought of
the balalaika and wondered about the difference between the two instrument
types.  Now armed with Itsik Goldenberg's question regarding use of this
word in an added extra-musical context, I'll make it a point during my next
haircut to ask Malke if she knows of any extended use of this word while
growing up in Kiev.

Subject: groyse bahndureh

This expression was frequently used in my home, both to denote a large chest
or piece of furniture or, for that matter, anything (or anyone) who was big
and heavy, as well as for people who were "heavy" in the head. In this latter
usage, I believe it might have been somewhat synonymous to the word
"buhlvahn," although the latter carried more pejorative weight.

Subject: Bandore - bigger than a bread box

A bandore was a star at Ashkenaz '95 in Toronto

Itsik Goldenberg got it right on two counts in Mendele 8.075. A bandore is a
musical instrument, a big and clumsy string instrument. Shaped like an
oversized guitar, the one I saw and heard boasted an additional S-shaped
opening covered with a second set of strings, and its tone was deep, bass,
and very rich. 

Azoyne zise muzikalishe zakhroynes: Thanks to Bruce Rosensweet who posted it
on Mendele, we partook of the Ashkenaz '95 Celebration, and experienced joys
of Yiddish that left us on a high for weeks; we still grow breyter vi
leynger at the memories: Adrienne Cooper (my favorite), Davka, John Zorn and
Masada, the Klezmatics, Shirim, Finjan, Mlotek Trio, Muszikas.....to name
but a few. 

One event created by the august Michael Alpert and Brave Old World (he
called it Night Songs from a Neighboring Village) traced a nigun in a shtetl
that floated through the night from a Jewish shtibele to a Russian hayzkele
to the Russian church and then was incorporated into a khazonishe tfile. In
the Russain church, it was performed on a bandore that could almost speak. 

So thank you for posting it, Mendele. Thank you. Again.
