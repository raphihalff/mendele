OK, but in the kind of linguistics I do, this is equivalent to
saying that the claim is not interesting. A claim that is not
falsifiable, at least in principle, is not a scientific claim. At
least that's the way I was brought up :-)

It seems to me, given the logic that Bob has sketched out, that, in
Wexler's scheme, JudeoSorbian must have been a relexified version of
some earlier Jewish Language, and thus, ultimately, of Biblical
Hebrew.  Therefore Yiddish isn't a Slavic language after all, it's
actually a Semitic language that's been relexified several times.
And Modern Hebrew turns out to be Semitic after all! My relief is
mitigated only by the realization that English, at least as spoken
by my parents, is also Semitic, since it's relexified Yiddish ;-)

OK, I'll try to keep out of this until I finish reading Wexler's
manifesto. Really. I'll try.

But I couldn't resist this time ...

Subject: Pseudonyms and lurkers

In the wake of Neil Miller's admirable post on the use of
pseudonyms, I'd like to add one to his reshime: a name that not
only is meant to conceal but at the same time by its use of Hebrew
to remind us that concealment is part of a long tradition: Der
Nister. (Not only hiding out but perhaps even involved in some sort
of mystery.  Like Ben Zakkai--whose name was used by another (says
Scholem) as putative author of the Zohar--studying kabala in a
cave..). Der Nister (d. 1950) was a Soviet writer whose novel
"Mishpokhe Mashber" is remarkable on many counts, one of them being
a very sympathetic treatment of the Bratslaver hasidim.  More
'ginzey nistarot'.

Ellen Prince raises the question of "concealed" subscribers.  I
believe the current number is 1.  But why concealed?  Aside from
"tradition", I have a story.

In 1940 FDR ran against Willkie and McNary, the latter a feisty
Congressman from Oregon. At some campaign stop FDR offered this
parable.  A bunch of kids in school on Monday morning.  Teacher
asks: how many of you went to Sunday School yesterday? (In 1940
they still asked such questions.) Every hand goes up but one.  "Why
Charlie!" drawls FDR in his most exaggerated upper-class nusakh,
"Charlie McNary (laughter, guffaws)...Don't you want to go to
heaven?" "Sure, teacher", says McNary, "but not with that bunch".

Of course there's Groucho's famous line.  And the hoary one about
the 2 Jews on the desert island with 3 shuls.  But FDR was there
first.  Maybe Judge Rosenbaum wrote it?

Subject: Introduction

        My name is Gregg Kinkley, and I am the new kid on this
block. Regretably I know no Yiddish (though I can struggle through a
newspaper from my knowledge of German and Hebrew).  I am here to
learn and enjoy.

        I am also a goy turning ger, so I am new to this community
as well.  I am happy there is such a thing as Mendele, and I think I
will like it here.

        My bubby and zaydie may not have been as wonderbread as my
father thought.  They came from Germany, spoke little German around
the house, but what my father remembers sounds very suspiciously
Yiddische.  For instance: "ippis" for "etwas".  Can you folks
confirm that this is Yiddish!?  Thanks and shalom!

***********************************************

Come now, this is fantasy stuff that we all would love to be able to
do, to review our own material the way it was meant to be reviewed.
None of us gets the opportunity, unless we are an Edward Said
writing in Critical Inquiry or Wexler.

It is the editors who allow this who should be strung up it seems to
me.

I live in a part of the world where this sort of acting out of
fantasies is referred to as political behavior.  One hopes for
better in the academic world but should not be too surprised when
the academic world approaches the real world in its corruption.

Subject: mauscheln, etc.

As to a language being ' a dialect with an army and a navy', the
quote is usually attributed to the Cornell linguist - Romance
scholar - Robert Hall, and probably can   be found in his general
introductory text (and, most likely, elsewhere in his work).

The lox/lax of Werman's counting (I don't know the article he refers
to) may have something to do with the Indo-European cognates (I'm no
Indo-Europeanist ) of Sanskrit lakSa (Hindi laakh 'one hundred
thousand') meaning 'a very large number', this presumably being
derived from a basic meaning , 'salmon' (that swarm in very large
numbers ??). This etymology is important (to some) in that if the
Sanskrit cognate is accepted it has implications regarding the
original home (urheimat) of the Indo-Europeans as a place where
there were lakSa ( 'salmon'). In what urheimat  the bagel first
surfaces is another set of  problems.

I would like to know what, if anything, is being done in the  way of
historical or critical study, - and translation  of (my
grandfather's landsman) Avrom Reisen, the prolific poet and prose
writer. I know the translations  of some of the poems in the
standard anthologies. (The Penguin anthology gives the shtetl name
as Keidany (sic). Elsewhere, e.g. in a pamphlet with selected poems
and their musical settings prepared on the occasion of Reisen's
seventieth birthday in l946,  the name is given as Koidanov. I
always heard it with the middle vowel reduced: Koidenov.)

Information on the word - name - kafekal, meaning a faraway
(strange ?, unappetizing ? useless ?) place.

Most importantly, can anyone tell me about mauscheln ( with or
without an umlaut on the first diphthong), which, I gather from a
book about Kafka , meant to speak German  in the more or less
conventionalized (stage ?) variety of German supposedly
characteristic  of  insufficiently educated (in German) Jews (in
Vienna ?), whose mother tongue was Yiddish: its phonology, syntax,
pragmatics.   I would appreciate information and references to
stereotyped (low comic, or whatever) varieties of other European
languages that were supposed to represent the way these  languages
(Polish, Russian, French, Spanish ) were spoken by  ignorant and
un-educated Jews.  Can someone tell me  the contexts in which
'mauscheln' (jokes, skits, etc) was used, and by whom. I assume that
the first language of these 'mauschlers'  was , by definition,
Yiddish . This follows up an earlier inquiry (and the responses to
it) about Yiddish-English (macaronic) doggerel.
