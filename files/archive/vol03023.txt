Tayer Khaverim:

  I have just returned from "The First International Conference on
Yiddish Clubs" which was put on by the Greater Washington Yiddish
Clubs. There were about 145 participants from all over the United
States, Canada, and even Argentina. Not only was the program
excellent, but it was wonderful just to associate with Yiddishe
mentshen for three days.

   We all felt very strongly that we should meet again - every two
years. Sites considered were: Canada (Montreal or  Toronto);
Columbus, Cleveland; Los Angeles, Miami, etc, etc.

   I thought the Mendele would be a good vehicle to spread the word.
I enjoyed the conference so much that I wanted to share it with as
many as I could as quickly as I could. I'd like to hear from as many
of you as possible about this.

Subject: Yid(d)ish Vokh and standardized transcriptions

I was one of those people who put in a word for not mixing standard
YIVO transciption with informal popular transcription. Now I lean
toward a little more flexibility.  If participants in the Yiddish
week program are going to call it, WHILE SPEAKING ENGLISH, by its
Yiddish name more or less, pronouncing the first word like the
English word "Yiddish" (with its flapped "d"), then maybe the way it
should be written IN ENGLISH is: "Yiddish vokh".

A good discussion of all these issues is contained in the booklet
_How DO You Spell Chanukah?  A General-Purpose Romanization of
Hebrew for Speakers of English_ by Werner Weinberg (Cincinnati:
Hebrew Union College Press, 1976). ("Romanization" is pretty much
the same as "practical transcription".) Weinberg's lucid reasoning
about most aspects of transcription, though not all the details of
his proposed transcription system, were adopted by the Library of
Congress and the American National Standards Institute.  On p.30 he
has a section entitled "Will Options and Exceptions not Further
Disunity?"  He writes:

        	In the course of these explanations the romanizer
        has been given options in five cases: ...  Furthermore two
        exceptions have been stated: ...

        	The question may be asked why options are given and
        exceptions allowed when a new system is to be introduced.
        Will they not open the door to arbitrariness when the very
        purpose of the system is unification?  But it is rather
        absolute decisiveness and rigidity, in cases which by their
        nature allow for more than one possibility, that encourage
        deviation and with it breakdown of the system.  Romanization
        must not be stricter than national orthographies [i.e.
        ordinary spelling of languages in their usual scripts] and
        these allow for options and exceptions."

The heading of a poster or flyer that is otherwise written in
English seems to me to be just the kind of situation that calls for
an exception: Yiddish Vokh. (But never Woch!)

Subject: A bibliografishe bakawshe

        Perhaps some one can help me get the exact source and
quotation. I have a vague (possibly incorrect) recollection that one
of leading Yiddish scholars, possibly Weinreich, once said something
like:

        The difference between a language and a dialect is that the
former has a government and an army....

        Any suggestions?

Does anyone have a mailing address for Touro College's Judaic
Studies Program in Moscow, which was featured in an article by
Natasha Singer in the English language Forward of April 30, 1993,
p.12? Stanley Werbow: GLAA273@utxvms.cc.utexas.edu

Subject: rosl,roizl

       yitshak kertesz writes that rosl is not the same as roizl or
rozl, and that transliteration can lead to ambiguities.granted that
brine does not smell the same as a rose and the meaning of that
delightful phrase is different in the two cases, i do believe that
meaning it has, whether it is brine or rose.
