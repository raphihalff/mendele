Subject: Rozhinkes a folk song?

        Is Rozhinkes mit mandeln a folk song?  Woodie
Guthrie is reported to have said "If the folks sing it,
it's a folksong."  By his criterion, probably Rozhinkes is
a folksong, but Summertime isn't.

        On a related topic:  Snobism about Yiddish theater
and theater music isn't simply a response to the borsht
belt.  My mother's parents were terrible snobs.  Born in
1890, came to America in 1905-1907, spoke Yiddish to each
other and some friends until the end, but I'm sure all the
juicy Yiddish insults and curses were never heard in their
house.  Anyway, they disapproved heartily of all the second
avenue stuff.  The only Yiddish songs they ever sang were
from the old country.  What they got into here was, of all
things, opera!  I have never understood how these people,
coming from a village so small that klezmorim were heard
only rarely, became so devoted to opera.  And it was
sincere and deeply felt: in his deaf old age my grandfather
heard a tenor on his old TV and decided he was "even better
than Pavarotti".  Who was it? Placido Domingo of course.
Their snobism wasn't at all Jewish self-hate; he (my
grandfather, not Domingo) was also devoted to khazonish,
and would go far to hear a good khazn, though he wasn't
religious.  (A good yontef davening is a lot like a recital
of mad-scenes from the opera.  [I love'em both.])

        The point is that I believe there must have been a
distinct streak of snobism about Yiddish theater music well
before the post-war borsht belt.

Subject: Yiddish song collection

To those interested in having a look at a very fine
collection of Yiddish songs I strongly recommend the
Anthology of Yiddish Folksongs by Vinkovetzky, kovner and
Leichter published by the Magnus Press of the Hebrew Univ
of Jerusalem. It is in 4 volumes and was still in print in
1989 when I purchased a copy in Israel. The "Folksong" part
should be taken with a grain of kosher salt, but it is
beautifully produced and has some wonderful material.

Subject: Borscht belt memories

Dear Mendel & C: I spent years and years in the Borscht
Belt, from the cottages (kokhalayns) in the 1930 through
bussing and waitering and caddying and all, until 1949.
The music was awful, of course, and I cringe now with tony
Bennet and Sinatra too, bad singers, and all that. Jazz
and the rest didnt exist. It was all pop stuff. For
dancing and necking, which one started even before puberty,
what with the casinos. A former student of mine a very
talented African-American girl in LA (middle class)
mentioned the other day she making headway with the
accordion. What playing? Besame Mucho, says she. I was
thrown back to 1937-38, and my first date at aged 8, to
learn to dance to Besame mucho. That was the thing.
Campfires on occasion among the cottagers, and the songs,
papirossen and stuff, like that mandolins, uncles and
aunts, and lots of workers songs, all new fakes for
trotskyites and the like. I agree wiht Noyekh, the music
was rotten in the Catskills, Danny Kaye and all them
guys, and even Eddie Fisher, whom I saw Cantor introduce
at Grossinger's the day before he went into the Army, and
i stood at the back and said to some woman guest I was
gigolo-ing..he'll never make it. He did make it. He never
could sing anyway.

Subject: `Dybbuk' film

I recently bought, from a company called something like
Ergo Home Video, a videocassette of the classic Yiddish
film 'Der Dibek', produced in Warsaw in the '30s.  It's
thrilling to watch, even though the print from which the
video was made was in dreadful condition (many skips &
jumps) and the dialog is just barely intelligible.

Both the Workmen's Circle (Arbeter Ring) in New York City
and the Brandeis Jewish Film Center list a video of the
same production in their catalogs. Does anyone know whether
either is of better quality than Ergo's?

Subject: query

A most serious question -- what is the 'proper' Yiddish
translation of 'sex' and 'sexual intercourse'.  No
vulgarities like 'shtup'.  Those I know.
