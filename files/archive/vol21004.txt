Subject:  "biz keyn dants"

Is it possible that this phrase is actually about the vaser going biz
Keidan? There was a city in Lithuania called Keydan in Yiddish. The
current name in Lithuanian is Kedainiai.
Wikipedia says: The city has been known by other names: Kiejdany in
Polish, Keidan in Yiddish, and Kedahnen in German. Its other alternate
forms include Kidan, Kaidan, Keidany, Keydan, Kiejdany, Kuidany, and
Kidainiai.

Subject: Race and Humor in Yiddish jokes

Dear Friends,

I am currently in search of Yiddish jokes or sayings that contain some
element of racial or racist thinking. For example, this could be a
regrettable racist joke, but my hope is that such jokes could be about
something more complex about Jews and Goyim. My general request is that
the joke deal with some aspect of racial difference, either as we
understand it today or as it was understood in the past.
