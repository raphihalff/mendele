Subject: Yiddish books in London?

A question:  Could anyone please tell me where (if anywhere) one can buy
Yiddish books in London?

If you like you can reply to me personally on this, and if so I promise, as is
the custom on some lists, to post a summary of your replies on Mendele at a
later date.

A dank!

Subject: Loshn-Koydesh in Yiddish

To Arnie Kuzmack re "Hasofe", Mendele v. 5.215 (as you can see I am a few days
behind in my Mendele reading):

...And then there is the use (and misuse?) of Loshn Koydesh by Sholem
Aleykhem's Tevye der Milkhiker.  Is this a third type of use?

But seriously, I wonder if any studies have been done of the use of, and play
with, Loshn Koydesh made by Sholem Aleykhem in his writings?  What fascinates
me is what this implies sociolinguistically and culturally about the kind of
readers he had, and I sometimes wonder whether the average reader understood
all the jokes.  Does anyone have any comments?

On a personal note, I never thought of my grandparents as having been very
literate (my grandfather was a simple tailor and Petticoat Lane bric-brac
seller), and yet my mother tells me she recollects, in her childhood in London
back in the 1920s, that on Friday evenings the family would gather around the
fire while my grandmother (whom I never met) read a certain Yiddish paper out
loud.  The whole family's favourite column, she said, was by Sholem Aleykhem,
and this was invariably read first, and had everyone laughing like mad!

Subject: yak/dobri

In the first of several belated postings I'd like to answer Mendy Fliegler's
question (5.176) about the Slavicisms _yak_ and _dobri_, which came up in a
question about a Sholem Aleichem passage.  The former is a conjunction (in
Polish and elsewhere) that can mean 'as' and various other things.  The latter
is easier:  it means 'good' and shows up in Yiddish as well in the names of
some klezmer genres, e.g., _dobriden_ lit. 'good day' and _dobrano_ 'good
night'.

Subject: Euphemisms

In reference to Zellig Bach's posting (5.198) on euphemisms in
Yiddish:  there's a proverb that says

       Vos men shemt zikh tsu zogn oyf yidish, zogt men oyf loshn-koydesh.

       What one is embarrassed to say in Yiddish, one says in Hebrew.

Subject: Belz

In 5.179 David Herskovic asked which Belz was the subject of "Mayn shtetele
Belz"--the one near Lviv (Lemberik) in Ukraine or the one in Moldova
(historical Bessarabia).  I don't have a definitive answer, only some clues.
The song was written by Jacob Jacobs (words) and Alexander Olshanetsky (music)
for William Siegel's 1932 play _Dos lid fun geto_ (_Song of the Ghetto_).
Jacobs was born in Hungary; Olshanetsky, in Odessa.  (I wasn't able to
establish a birthplace for Siegel.)  This circumstancial evidence suggests
Bessarabia over Galicia.  The Bessarabian Belz is really Belts (and that's the
official Yiddish form as well as the Moldavian/Romanian form), but there's a
tradition of using _Belz_ in Yiddish for both places.

Siegel's play, by the way, was the occasion for the theatrical (as opposed to
concert) debut of the great Yiddish and Russian singer Isa Kremer.

Subject: Bekeshe

In 5.198 Mikhl Herzog pointed out that the word _bekeshe_ is "used mostly in
Galicia and in the area to its southwest."  That's not surprising since,
although the word exists in Polish and Russian (and, with an initial _p_, in
German), the original source is apparently Hungarian, where _bekecs_ is a kind
of fur coat.

Subject: Aliza Greenblatt

Re 5.129:  If I'm not mistaken, Aliza Greenblatt was Arlo Guthrie's
_grandmother_ since she was the mother of the noted dancer Marjorie Guthrie,
who was Woodie Guthrie's wife and the mother of Arlo Guthrie.

Subject: Aliza Greenblatt

Just wanted to correct Michael Godfrey-- Aliza Greenblatt was Arlo Guthrie's
grandmother, not mother. Marjorie Greenblatt, the daughter of Aliza and Isidor
Greenblatt, married Woody Guthrie.

Subject: Kamer-kamer-hoyz

The children's game "kamer, kamer, hoyz" is described is described by Yekhiel
Shtern in his study of children's culture in the shtetl Tishevits entitled
"Kheyder un besmedresh", published by YIVO in 1950 (see pages 59-60).

The following is a somewhat rough translation of Shtern's description of the
game: "One child stands facing a wall while each of the other players finds a
hiding place. When everyone has hidden, the leader sings out the ditty "rude,
marane" (text on page 59: "rude, marane, geshlosene pane, zibn mol arum,
sheyne kale ker zikh um"). The child standing with her face to the wall then
turns around and looks for the other players, while keeping close to an
agreed-upon spot. If she finds a player in his hiding place, she raps on the
hiding place, saying the following words: "kamer, kamer, hoyz, Yosl
(substitute the name of the player), kum fun dayn baheltenish aroys". The last
child to be found now faces the wall, and the game begins again. If one of the
players manages to get to the searcher's spot without being noticed by the
searcher, he raps on the spot and says: "kamer, kamer, hoyz, eyns, tsvey,
dray". The seacher then goes back to her spot, and the game begins again.

Ellen Cassedy mentions that Sholem Aleykhem makes reference to the game in
several stories. I'd be interested to know the exact references. Itsik Manger
refers to the game too, in the first chapter of "Dos bukh fun gan-eydn".
