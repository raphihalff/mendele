Subject: Tales of Yiddish elves

In Mendele 5.036 Howard Lenhoff asks for tales of Yiddish elves, or
shretelekh. There's an I.B. Singer story called "A mayse vegn shretelekh
un grilen" that was published in the Forverts on Oct. 12, 1967, pages 2
and 5. It was translated into English as "Tsirtsur & Peziza" in "Stories
for children."

Subject: Yiddish study opportunities in Connecticut

I am inquiring for a friend who will be a student at Wesleyan in Conn.
Does anyone know of opportunities for studying Yiddish around there?

Please respond to me personally.  A sheynem dank.

Subject: National Public Mendele, the Saga Continues

Back in February and March, I conducted a series of interviews with
Mendelniks in Boston and San Francisco for a planned public radio feature
story (I would once again like to thank all who participated).  For those
of you who have been wondering what happened, I regret to report that, so
far, my attempts to pitch the piece to NPR have not been wildly
successful. As a result, I put the project on the back burner for a
while, but now plan to wrap it up while I am in New York for the Uriel
Weinreich summer program. If any of you Mendelyaner out there in the
greater Gotham area (I am willing to wade into deepest Jersey if
necessary) would be willing to do a taped interview with me about why you
love mame-loshn and Mendele, please send me a personal e-mail or call me
at (201) 217-9577. It's a lot of fun, and I would appreciate your
participation.

A sheynem dank,

Subject: Yiddish perpetuation

What can we do for tomorrow?

Harvey Spiro, my first friend on Mendele and my Viener Gaon, advised me
"to get in the fray as it is short for freylekh". Mendele _is_ more
rewarding when you're in the fray, but so is everything dealing with
Yiddish. Instead of wading in the mire of Glatshteyn's depressive "viglid
far zkeynim vos tsekayen ayngeveykte khale," how about making a
shibboleth from Leyvik's Eybik: "Ikh heyb zikh oyf vider un shpan avek
vayter"?

Washington with its Yiddish clubs and activists should be fertile ground
for parents (or a parent, it only takes one!) to create a little shule
for youngsters to get together on week-ends or after school once, twice a
week 'far a por lidelekh, di oysyelekh, zatzn, poemelekh oif mameloshn.'
Maybe while the parents are at a leyenkreiz, etc. It could begin in
someone's home or wherever Yiddish meetings are held now. Fishl must have
a teacher or two in his giant bag of Yiddishists.

Thirty-two years ago, pregnant, I felt all the emotions Harvey describes.
I too wanted to be ready to transmit the beloved goldene keyt to my
children. The Arbeter Ring had filled me with many of its riches; I had
loved going to shule as a child.

I called their New York office and Yosl Mlotek, at that time the
Assistant Educational Director, was eager and motivating in helping me to
create and organize a new shule. It was hard work, but we found a few
more lovers of Yiddish (we're dear friends to this day). We started "in
Brooklyn in a shtibl on vent un on a dakh", overcame "di noyt" and grew
to be the largest shule in New York City.

With all the love of Yiddish, the innate ability and intelligence we feel
sparking from Vienna, maybe a little publicity in a local paper would
unearth a new group that would get in the fray and give us a tomorrow.

Subject: Translation

I have been intrigued by the discussion on translation and the creation
of a special program which will do the work for us. It seems to me that
this idea is premised on a misunderstanding of what translation is, as if
to translate is to merely exchange a Yiddish word for its English
counterpart. I would argue that the act of translation encompasses much
more than this; there are a whole slew of linguistic, cultural, and
literary problems which are implicit in the translatory act. It is not
likely that any single program would be able to compensate for the many
nuances a text presents. Indeed, we as translators probably also miss
many of these same nuances, but I daresay we catch more than a simple
program would.

I find translation a terribly difficult thing, but also one of the most
rewarding. To render Rabinovitsh or Perets or Singer in an English
version which conveys the social/cultural/literary sense intended is
quite an achievement indeed. It takes time, patience, and hard work. It's
disappointing that so many would prefer to rely on a computer to do the
work instead.

Subject: Lakhn mit yashtsherkes/fardreyen die yotzres

A folks interpretation.

In response to Norman Savitt's query [5.035] I can well l recall my
folks's use of the first expression to convey the idea that the
"gelekhter" was actually painful, that is that it was not a "fun"
experience and that one would actually not ultimately enjoy the
situation; one does not enjoy the experience of bitterness. The second,
which I don't believe was unique to them, but I haven't heard of others
using, involves mixing somebody up so that he/she doesn't know one yetzer
(impulse) from another. As I recall it was frequently used in arguments
when one got fed up with the assertions or the demands of the other.

Finally, a point made in reference to the denigration of Yiddish. Self
contempt is hardly new for Jews and it found one form of expression in
loathing for the language spoken by one's fellow Jews, particularly in
the surge for Americanization in this country, or in rejection of the
OstJuden in turn of the century Vienna. What will be ---Vos vet zayn
vayter? Got veys! One hopes and one lives with one's own identity issues.
(Anyway, I understand that the situation with Ladino is far worse!)
