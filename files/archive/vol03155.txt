Subject: yiddish new testament

first, thanks to shleyme axelrod for discreetly correcting my
rendition of the title of the einspruch n.t., der brit khadoshe.
second, bizarre as it may seem, the 'jews for jesus' and 'messianic
jews' seem to think that there is STILL a public out there that can
read the n.t. only in yiddish and that is a candidate for
conversion. the edition i have can currently be had for the asking
from the local 'messianic jews' establishment. go figure.

Weinreich does NOT agree with you. Please see page 122 of "College
Yiddish", which I quoted in an ealier message.

If you want to believe that neither Weinreich, nor Mark, nor
Birnbaum, nor any of the linguists in this audience can tell the
difference between natural speech and artificial literary
pretensions, that's your right.  But please do not misrepresent the
opinions of those who disagree with you.

With respect to consulting other speakers: this is of course the
right thing to do. But it has be done with some sophistication. The
meaning of this construction is such that it is rarely natural to
use it just out of the blue. For instance, the last sentence on page
136 of "College Yiddish" is "Hobn es di tsvey brider gekoyft." Out
of context that sounds terrible.  But in the context of the story it
sounds fine to me, and I'd be willing to bet it sounds fine to most
other mendelnikes.  Here are the first two paragraphs of the story:

A mol zaynen geven tsvey brider, yidishe bal-melokhes. Zey hobn
shver gearbet un gut fardint. Eyn mol hot a raykher man in der
shtot, vu zey hobn gevoynt, gevolt farkoyfn eyns fun zayne groyse
hayzer. Keyner fun di kristn in shtot hot nit gehat genug gelt tsu
koyfn dos hoyz.  _Hobn_ es di tsvey brider gekoyft. (page 137)
_Hobn_ di kristn gezogt: "Zet, yidn nemen shoyn vider undzere
zakhn!" un zey hobn bashlosn tsu nemen nekome in di tsvey brider.
_Hot_ men untergevorfn lebn hoyz fun di brider a toytn un men hot
gezogt, az di yidn hobn umgebrengt a krist tsu nitsn zayn blut oyf
peysakh. Men hot di brider arayngezetst in tfise.

Notes:
1) My apologies if I made any mistakes in transliterating.

2) 3 sentences in a row begin with verbs.

3) I notice he uses "man" for (English) 'man'. "Raykher man" in this
   meaning doesn't sound as odd to me as "a man" does.  Do others
   share this feeling?

4) If Weinreich's elementary textbook is too literary for you, take
   a look at "Royte Pomerantsn" (by Olshvanger?). It's neither
   literary, nor pretentious, nor standard Yiddish. It's certainly
   colloquial.

If I get a chance over the weekend, I'll dig up some examples from a
tape I made of my mother a few years back.

Subject: Ferz/posuk

Reuven Rachlin says:
:
: In connection with his interesting posting about the Yiddish New
: Testament, Jeremy Stern asks whether there is a Yiddish word for
: "verse" ther than "posuk" (pl. "p'sukim").  "Ferz" (pl. "ferzn")
: has, I believe, the same meaning, but is obviously cognate to the
: German "Vers(e pl.)."

Possibly, but I doubt it. German "Vers" is, I believe, one of those
cases where German "v" is not pronounced as "f", and my guess is
that it would have come into Yiddish as "Vers" or "Verz". Anybody
out there know for sure?

Subject: Book by Bettina Simon?

	Does anyone out there know where I can buy, repeat, BUY, a
copy of Bettina Simon, Jiddische Sprachgeschichte:  Versuch einer
neuen Grundlegung, 1988, published somewhere in what was then East
Germany?

	(Confession:  I checked this out of the university library
last spring for a course I taught on history of Yiddish, lost it,
and now the library wants me to replace it.

	No respectable offer refused.

Subject: rules, verb order, linguists

I  admire - support but stay away from - Ellen Prince's mission to
the rule-happy but text-aversive. Add Jerry (Jerrold) Sadock of the
University of Chicago to her list of linguists who have done and are
doing serious work in the area.
