Subject: ICOR documentation

Re: Henry Srebrnik's search for ICOR documentation (Vol 5.134)

A very useful English-language secondary source on the Organization for
Jewish Colonization in Russia (ICOR) is Melech Epstein, _The Jew and
Communism 1919-1941_ (New York: Trade Union Sponsoring Committee,
[1959]). Epstein was a founding editor of the Morgen Freiheit, later
turned anti-Communist. Like any material from the period, his book has
its axe to grind, but the index and notes are invaluable, and there is a
fair amount of documentation. The interesting thing about Epstein's
presentation is that he goes into the pre-Birobidzhan origins of ICOR.

There is reference to ICOR in the Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v.
Birobidzhan, though this entry does not mention Leon Talmy, the leading
personality associated with the Birobidzhan-era ICOR. For material on
Talmy (tes-alef-lamed-mem-yud), there is an entry in the _Leksikon fun
der nayer yidisher literatur_, which gives bibliographic and periodical
references, including the substantial entry in Reyzen's Lexicon. Note
that the first volume (alef through yud) of Reyzen appeared before the
establishment of the Birobidzhan colony.

During 1929-30, the Freiheit featured serialized dispatches Talmy sent
from Birobidzhan. (He had earlier toured with a delegation of American
educators and "experts," among them the president of Brigham Young
University, according to Epstein.) These reports were collected in book
form as _Af royer erd: mit der "icor"-ekspeditsye in biro-bidzshan_
("Frayhayt" bukhhandlung un farlag, 1931, 258 pp. + map). It was
precisely in these years, in the aftermath of the Hebron massacre of
1929, that the Freiheit, ICOR, and other Communist-dominated
organizations were polarized into rigidly anti-Zionist postures.

I wonder if Talmy, originally Leyzer Talminovitsky, may have conceived of
his nom de plume as containing a counter-Zionist, or perhaps we should
say para-Territorialist, subtext. There is a modern Hebrew name Talmi,
synthesized from _telem_ (tav-lamed-mem), meaning furrow. This is a
paradigmatic Israeli name, in which one's very identity is literally
voiced in ideological connection to working the land. It would not be
surprising that a leading figure in the Soviet colonization movement
would parody the Zionist name, de-Hebraicizing it with an initial Yiddish
tes in place of the Hebrew tav.

Besides Talmy's dispatches, the Freiheit is a good source for sundry data
about the ICOR community in America. Ads were frequently run announcing
various ICOR activities, speakers, etc.; and it is at least interesting
to see whose support they could muster. E.g., the May 4, 1930, edition
carries an ad for the May 10 ICOR concert at Carnegie Hall, featuring
Izidor [sic] Belarsky ("bas fun leningrader opera"), choreographer
Benyomin Tsemakh, and "velt berimter violinist" Maks Rozen, whose photo
dominates the ad. This was of course Maxie Rosenzweig, former student of
the celebrated Professor Auer (teacher of Elman, Zimbalist, Heifetz et
al) and friend since childhood of George Gershwin. Second Avenue composer
Yoysef Rumshinsky reports seeing the brothers Gershwin together with Max
Rosen in the audience for Rumshinsky's _Oy, iz dos a meydl_ circa 1926.
(Curiously, Rumshinsky did not copyright _Oy, iz dos a meydl_ until March
30, 1928 -- two days after the Soviet charter of Birobidzhan.) Standard
Gershwin biographies all solemnly repeat the suspiciously
apocryphal-sounding story that Maxie's school-assembly performance of
"Humoresque" inspired young George to start piano lessons. The rest, as
they say, is history, or at least a famous story by Fanny Hurst, followed
by the "ethnic" John Garfield picture.

Subject: Sholom Aleichem Street

I am glad that New York may join the club of cities with Sholom Aleichem
Street. Streets in Kiev, Odessa, Zhitomir, Chernovtsy, Lvov and several
other Ukrainian cities and towns were named after Sholom Aleichem in
1920s-1950s. I think this fact might make a good argument in the discussion
in New York: even in Ukraine and even at that time they named the streets
after Sholom Aleichem.

The only other Yiddish literary name on the map that I know is Perets Markish
Street in his hometown in Podolia.

Subject: Zellig's interview with Colin Powell

Yasher koyekh, Zelig.  Der intervyu mit Colin Peysekhke Powell iz

Buchanan (yemakh shemoy!) in der zelber politisher partey?

More power to you, Zellig!  The interview with Colin (Peysekhke) Powell
is tremendously beautiful, full of charm.  I would wish to speak Yiddish
as beautifully as Peysekhke.  Apparently, he speaks Yiddish fluently,
without hesitation.

I hope you don't mind if I send a few copies of such a rare phenomenon to
a few people who are interested in this subject.

There is one thing I don't understand, seems to me a bit awkward,
inappropriate.  How can it be that a person with a heart who speaks
Yiddish should be a member along with Pat Buchanan (may his name be
blotted out!) of the same political party?

Subject: Colin (Peysekhke) Powell

Zellig Bach blew his cover, in his "Yiddish interview" with Colin Powell,
with a single word.  I knew it was a fabrication when, for the word
meaning "Yes", he used not the traditional Litvish-Yiddish word "Yeh",
but rather the African-American slang idiom, "Yo"!
