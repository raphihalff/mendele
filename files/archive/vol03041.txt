Subject: Wexler

meylekh, you claim that i have said that i haven't read wexler's
article and that certain kinds of counterarguments are in order.
first, i don't know what i said that led you to believe the first
thing, but i have read wexler's work on the subject. second, i do
believe there were specific counterarguments made on mendele a while
back and now again by khaim. if you think they are flawed, tell us
in what way.

arn, you don't want to know. but, if you really do and if reyzl is
reluctant to tell all, try sally thomason and/or maggie reynolds.
and bring along an airsick bag.

Subject: Reyzl Kalifowicz-Waletzky's remarks

1) It's true that it's prudent to observe an electronic forum for a
while before jumping in. But a) reading all the archives is surely
more than is necessary; b) this particular forum isn't one where you
get jumped on for not knowing what was discussed 6 months ago; c)
you clearly have interesting things to contribute. Shemt zikh nisht,
lomir hern!

2) All I know about the Slobodjanskyj affair is what appeared in
_Language_, and I had forgotten that Wexler's name was associated
with it. I would post what I know, but it sounds like more of the
story came out in _Lingua Franca_; please give us a summary, or at
least a reference.

3) Reyzl mentions "Jewish involvement in slave trading of Slavs in
the first millennium". This is entirely new to me; it's a bit
further from our topic, perhaps, but I'm probably not the only one
who would appreciate a summary.

Meylekh is right, of course, and that's why I was careful to mention
that I hadn't read the paper. I intend to read it when I can find
the time, if only because it looks like this topic will keep on
coming up, and I would like to have a more informed opinion.

But I think he's wrong is saying that Ellen hasn't read it: her
remarks back in issue 1.195 of Mendele sound pretty well informed to
me. I can forward a copy to anyone who's interested.
