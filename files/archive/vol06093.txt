Subject: Bathhouse and mikve

In an essay I wrote a number of years ago I started to inquire into the
bathhouse/mikve relationship which Celia Bergoffen asks about in her
notice of 6 Nov. 1996 (Mendele vol6.091).  In "Paul Muni's Parents Sing
at a London Jewish Music Hall," (in _Language and Civilization; a
Concerted Profusion of Essays and Studies in Honour of Otto Hietsch_, 2
vols.  Edited with the assistance of Teresa Kirschner, Donald Gutch and
Judith Gilbert by Claudia Blank.  Frankfurt/Bern/Paris/New York:  Peter
Lang, 1992, vol. 1, pp. 428-471), I talk about the song "Khave-Leye,
gut-shabes!"  ('Eva-Leah, Good Sabbath!'), which was sung by Saltshe
(Sali) Vayznfraynd {Saltshe (Sally) Weisenfreund} (nee Khaye-Tsilke
Fishler) (1876-1934) around the turn of the century.

Here is the song, romanized, Englished and commented on briefly.

Friday is a pain, a plague:
Everybody knows it: charcoal fumes and smoke:
You work hard: no rest for even a minute:
Baking khale: chopping lime: putting in the tsholnt:
Last-minute shopping, knitting:
And all this has to be done in a day:
You've got to have a roast:
And peeling potatoes for the tsholnt:
And you must foam the broth:
And add to that a prune stew:
Egg cookies that will come out well:
Calf meat must be broiled:
And the peas boiled:
It's an old custom among us Jews:
But you don't have to worry, dear friends:
Right after the pudding tomorrow:
With my hair washed and combed:
Not looking like an old hag:        [lit. 'not shoes and tattered shoes'].
You'll all be able to say to me:
"Eve-Leah, Good Sabbath!"

>From early morning: you don't sit down:
Resting a little: Rushing to market:
Doing all the shopping: Besides all the work at home:
Koshering the meat:
Comes first above everything else:
A fat fish: And putting the tsholnt in the oven:
Boiling water for washing your head:
Combing your hair so that your husband will beam for joy:
Grating horseradish for the meat:
Here adding a juicy bone: Onions fried in fat:
Roasted gooseskin bits: And sweet ribs in the afternoon:
There must be raisin wine:
For right after coming home from the synagog.

Friday in the morning:
You have to milk the cows:
And boil the milk: Coffee and sugar:
That's the main thing: Before going to synagog:
Saffron in the cookies:  You have to have flour:
And you have to get the flour from the shopkeeper:
A trough, a kneading trough for bread, a poker and a shovel:
Chopping wood: Baking bread:
The children scream, "Mama, rolls!":
And the wood blocks have to be chopped:
This one screams, that one cries, that one laughs, this one whines:
Doing the laundry:  Getting ready to go to the bathhouse:
Entering the ritual bath:  Washing oneself clean:
Preparing your husband's Sabbath headgear and cloak:
Among us Jews this is the old fashion:

{Refrain}

"Khave-Leye, gut-shabes!" captures the sense of hurry and overwork which
characterizes Sabbath preparations among observant Jews.  But it is not
a song of complaint or protest.  The woman says that in the end she is
in complete control and everything turns out fine.  In fact, the song is
not so much about preparing for the Sabbath as it is about a woman's
ability to remain attractive and on top of her nearly impossible work
load.  It touches on religion because shtetl life, which it vividly
evokes, was saturated with religious observance.  On one level the song
reflects the Old World rather than London (cf. the cows).  But the urban
features of the shtetl are seen in Khave-Leye's shopping at both _mark_
'marketplace' and _kremer_ 'shopkeeper'.  Especially New-World is the
degree to which vanity takes precedence over religiosity.

"Khave-Leye, gut-shabes!" tells us that after making the kugl (the last
of the Sabbath dishes to be prepared), women could attend to their own
grooming and wash their hair in a basin or trough of hot water.  The
previous generation of married women would have worn wigs topped with
kerchiefs, but the wig {Yiddish:  _shaytl_} had ceased to be universal
even in Eastern Europe by the beginning of the twentieth century.  The
women of the family probably washed in a basin, for they would not
normally have had time to go to the mikve during the day on Friday; yet
the song reads:  "Getting ready to go to the bathhouse:  / Entering the
ritual bath:  Washing oneself clean," indicating that the speaker did go
to the mikve to wash herself on Friday.

Folksongs, not to speak of music-hall songs, do not always perfectly
reflect social reality and we need not credit the notion that women went
to the bathhouse or to the mikve on Fridays (even if we allow for
differences in the religious customs of Eastern Ashkenazic shtetls).  In
many communities, Thursday was women's day in the bathhouse and, almost
universally, Friday was men's day.  Moreover, it was unusual for men to
go to the mikve.  Khave-Leye prepared the menfolk for the bathhouse,
which must be kept distinct from the mikve, even though the mikve in
Eastern Ashkenaz was generally close to or attached to the bathhouse.
For the most part, the mikve was where women went after menstruation
(see Sol Steinmetz's article on _ritualarium_ in _Jewish Language
Review_ 7 {1987}, 11-20).  Some people outside Eastern Europe have
confused the mikve with the {Yid.} _bod_ (or, more learnedly,
_merkhets_) 'bathhouse'.

Thus we read:  "the men and boys...bear down on the bathhouse....  There
they will be cleansed in the bath and purified by three ceremonial
immersions in the pool of 'living waters' known as the _mikva_.
Meanwhile they will be entertained by the conversation of their peers"
(Mark Zborowski and Elizabeth Herzog, _Life is With People; the Culture
of the Shtetl_, New York:  Schocken, 1962, p. 41 {first published New
York:  International Universities Press, 1952}.  This wrongly suggests
that the mikve had to be IN the bathhouse and that, like the bathhouse,
it was a social center.  Although bathhouse and mikve were often close
to each other, they should be distinguished.  Yet their conflation does
have an historical basis:  "In many instances the _mikvaot_ of the
Middle Ages served as bathhouses because of the order forbidding Jews to
wash in the rivers together with Christians" (_Encyclopaedia Judaica_,
Jerusalem, 1971, 11:1544).  In his _Arabic Elements in Palestinian
Yiddish; the Old Ashkenazic Jewish Community in Palestine_ (Jerusalem:
Rubin Mass, 1966), Mordecai Kosover discussed the word "_khama'm_ =
hammam, 'bath, Turkish bath', still known in Yiddish as _terkishe bod_."
He writes:  "A detailed description of a Turkish bath in Jerusalem in
the eighties of the nineteenth century is to be found in Itta Yellin's
reminiscences _To My Offspring_, part II, pp. 18-20.  She mentions four
such steam-baths in the Old City:  hamam al batraq, hammam el-'eyn (Bath
of the Well), hammam el-sifa (Bath of Health), and hammam sitti maryam
(Bath of Lady Mary).  In each of these there was a _miqva_, a pool for
ritual ablution for Jewish women, under the supervision of a Sephardic
woman" (p. 310, #524).

The bathhouse was everyone's, and in some places local Gentiles as well
as Jews used it (see _Algemeyne entsiklopedye_ 5:44 {New York, 1944}).
Chasidim went to the mikve before the New Year and Day of Atonement and
some of them immersed themselves in the mikve before the Sabbath.  In at
least one place, male Jews (and not only Chasidim) immersed themselves
in the mikve on Sabbath morning before going to the synagog (private
communication from Yisrael Walker regarding the town of Nadvirna, now in
the Ukrainian SSR).

The woman of the song has many young children.  Those big enough to help
would do so, but the small children and infants must have been
especially burdensome on Fridays, when there was so much work to do and
so little time to do it.  The song's three stanzas yield a catalog of
stated or implied realia (to which one should add _di ki_ 'the cows',
which only a fairly well-off family would own -- see Mendele
Moykher-Sforim's _Dos toysfes-yon-tef-kelbl_ {undertranslated in Irving
Howe and Eliezer Greenberg, eds., _A Treasury of Yiddish Stories_ (New
York:  Viking Press, 1954) as 'The Calf'}.  The following is a schematic
presentation of shtetl life revealed in that one song, much of whose
charm lies in its evocative power.  Implied items are in brackets.

A) Utensils and materials:  _deyzhe_ 'kneading trough (for bread)',
_holts_ 'wood', _kalekh_ 'lime', {_keml_} 'comb', _kotshere_ 'poker',
_lopete_ 'shovel', _multer_ 'trough (for water)', {_shpizlekh_}
'knitting needles', {_holtskoyln_} 'charcoal'.

B) Foods and food ingredients:  _arbes_ 'peas', _broyt_ 'bread',
_bulbes_ 'potatoes', _eyer_ 'eggs', _fish_ 'fish', _floymen_ 'prunes',
_grivn_ 'roasted gooseskin bits', _kelberns_ 'calf meat', _kave_
'coffee', _khale_ 'Sabbath and holiday loaf', _khreyn_ 'horseradish',
_kikhlekh_ 'cookies', _kugl_ 'pudding', _mel_ 'flour', _milkh_ 'milk',
_pletselekh_ 'small rolls', _rosl_ 'broth'(see the discussion of _rosl_
and _roslfleysh_ in Roslyn Schwartz, "The Geography of Two Food Terms: a
Study in Yiddish Lexical Variation," in _The Field of Yiddish, Third
Collection_, London / The Hague / Paris:  Mouton and Co., 1969, pp.
240-266).  _rozhinke-vayn_ 'raisin wine', _shmalts_ 'animal fat',
_tsholnt_ 'Sabbath stew', _tsibeles mit shmalts_ 'onions fried in fat',
_tsuker_ 'sugar', _yoykh_ 'chicken soup', _zafren_ 'saffron', _zise
ripn_ 'sweet ribs'.

C. Institutions:  _shul_ 'synagog', _mikve_ 'ritual bath', _merkhets_
'bathhouse'.

D. Traditions:  _shabes_ 'Sabbath', _mikve_ 'ritual bath', {_kidesh_}
'benediction over the khale and wine'; male dress:  (a) _shtrayml_
'Sabbath and holiday hat', (b) _kapote_ 'Sabbath and holiday coat'.

Technical notes:
Some of the spellings on the songsheets reflect Southern Yiddish
pronunciation.  And some of them, while not sanctioned by today's
Yiddish spelling codexes, are authentic older spellings (like fusing the
indefinite article and the following noun).  "Khave-leye, gut-shabes!"
has _atsore_, _ayeder_, _tsu tsu zetsn_, _yokh...shomen_, _analter_,
_abisele...op tsu ruen_, _fis_, _far kemen_, _gribn_, _ribn_, _oys tsu
zidn_, _arayn geyen...op tsu vashn_.  "Khave-leye, gut-shabes!" has the
New High Germanisms "ales," "befor," "dazu," "farbereyten." _Khave-leye_
'Eva-Leah' is a typical compound Jewish given name.  The song
"Khave-tsipe, gut-shabes"('Eva-Zipporah, Good Sabbath'), which I have
not seen, may be a variant of our song.
