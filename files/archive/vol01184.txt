Subject: Klafte

Yude-Leyb Proger noted that _klafte_ was used by speakers
of Jewish German to refer to a bossy wife.  My mother and
Grandparents (from Jablonec and Liberec, Czechoslovakia)
who are German speakers, recently used the word to refer to
an officious nurse who was tending to my Granfather. They
also speculated, "She's probably German."  So, for them a
_klafte_ is one who possess certain personality traits
associated (stereotypically) with both nurses and Germans.
What a combination.
 
I would love to hear some remarks on the subject of Jewish
German, if anyone has the time or inclination.

plausible-shmosiblele, but is it "true"?

Bravo Berl Hoberman: Berl, I'm still waitying for your
mailing address so that I can send you the book I promised.
I'll be away till Feb 29, but I'll send it immediately
after that if vyour address is waiting for me.

Meylekh:   Sorry, I didn't mean to sound dismissive. You
and Harkavy are closer to the "truth" than any "cat"
explanation. skotsl kumt, said by both male and female in
the East, was apparently said only by women in Western
Yiddish (in place of Sholem Aleykhem). Origin? MAYBE a
medieval expression involving "Got" and "Wilkommen". A
dependable source, which I'm trying to follow up, has
suggested an alternative in a Northern German form
(something like "skohsl" meaning something quite different.

Does this ring a bell for anyone out there?

Subject: FREKH-

Mikhl:    MEYYED has it with one of those down-pointing
arrowheads that means 'inadmissable in the standard
language', but of course, in a more objective view of the
Yiddish lexicon, it would have to be included.  The word is
clearly from German _frech_ with the exact meaning of
'impudent'; however, in Israeli informal Hebrew it has
developed several original nuances.  A _freycha_ in
BenAmots/Beb Yehuda 1972 (p. 244) is a derogatory term for
an unattrractive female.  It is interesting that there is
no comparable form for males!  Could this have been
influenced by H. _parech_, a term of contempt for males?
Today one hears _frechit_, which is close to the Yiddish
_frekh_ .  The meaning seems to be 'cheap, tawdry, sleazy
woman'.  It carries a class and ethnic bias -- cf.
 
_shvedit_ "North African (woman).  The question of
determining what is a word is a complex one in every
language, especially in  a worldwide fusion lang. lik e
Yiddish.  Be well.

In Mendele Vol 1.182, Moishe-Nussen Eytan
<me@SUZUKA.U-STRASBG.FR> writes:
 
As for the aramaic origin of 'klafte' I am not so sure,
.... Moreover in `Had Gadyah, the dog is 'kalba' (terminal
letter: aleph): "dehikkah lekalba, denashakh leshunra,
etc".
 
************
 
     May I point out that the kalba here is with an aleph
at the end, often the form of the definite article in
Aramaic.  Thus, kalba in _had gadya_ would be "the [male]
^^^ dog," while female dog would be rendered kalba [with a
"he" at the end] or kilbiya or klabita or klavta [all with
final alephs].

There are, just to make life complicated, many Aramaics.
Or Yiddishes.
