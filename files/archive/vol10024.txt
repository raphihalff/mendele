Shaya Mitelman (10.023) writes:

	"I think the question about Volhynian dialect is more complicated
     than "zugn, kimen and shtitl"."

I agree completely. When I mentioned "zugn, kimen and shtitl", it was merely
to give the salient forms of northernmost Ukrainian Yiddish. Obviously, if
we go into detail, there is lots more to say. Thanks to him for giving a
sketch of the differences among Volhynian subdialects. I would sum it up by
stating: tote-mome is prevalent in the south, shtitl/vig (khirik-lushn) in
the north; while there is a small area in the center where both occur, most
speakers of tote-mome-lushn do not have khirik-lushn, and vice versa.  Mikhl
Herzog's editions (Field of Yiddish, third collection, and the Language and
Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry) include maps that show the borders of
these features.

As far as the Yiddish theater is concerned, it's possible that an area could
be pinpointed where the vowel system is nearly identical to "teater-lushn"
(theater standard). Offhand, I would place it in the area around Loytsk
(Lutsk, Luck), northwestern Ukraine. However, I suspect that the theater
standard is based on a least common denominator of Ukrainian Yiddish in
general, not on a particular region. It is Ukrainian Yiddish with the
exception of the most stigmatized forms found there (tote-mome, shtitl,
etc.).

Subject: Volhynian Dialect

Shaya Mitelman raises an interesting question: how _would_ Sholem Aleykhem
have said it? Luckily, we can hear how he spoke. He recorded two known
discs: one for the Victor company on September 7, 1915 of excerpts from his
two stories "Ven Ikh Bin Rothschild" and "A Freylekhn Yontef". The second "A
kirtse bagrising dem yidishn etnografishn musey" recorded in Petersburg in
1914. The first can be heard on Mark David's Yiddish Voice website the
second on a CD issued by the Vernadsky Library of the Ukraine in 1997.

Subject: Volhynian dialect

Serge Mittelman is quite right in citing the specific features of Volhynian
Yiddish (10.023).

The precise distribution of these features, and their variants in
neighboring regions, are depicted on the maps of _The Language and Culture
Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry_ (LCAAJ)

I'm happy to report that the massive third volume of the LCAAJ has just
appeared (Max Niemeyer Verlag, Tuebingen, Germany). Along with Volumes 1 and
2, it may soon be available at YIVO in New York, as well.

Subject: A Metaphor

I have just read a description of a melamed in which the author describes
him as:

A Yid vos fleygt opshprekhn an ayin-horeh mit a beyndl

This is a new one on me. Was this man engaging in some form of witchcraft
with chicken bones?

Help!

Subject: goldene pave as emblem

Could anyone explain the origin(s) of the "goldene pave" an an emblem for
Yiddish poetry and song?  I know that Ginsberg and Marek published their
folk song collection "di goldene pave" in 1901 - was the image already a
current one?  Thanks for any elucidation.

Re: Marcos Levin's query (10.023):

I think that I was shown  a collection of Y. L. Peretz short stories in
Spanish, at the Yivo library in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was shown to me
by Shmuel Roziansky (Rollansky) - Olov Hasholom .

Subject: "shikt arayn a poyer"

Regarding the recent song request: this may be the song my family
sings for Peysach, as a Yiddish kind of Chad Gadya.  The words are:

Shikt der har a poyerl in vald, a poyerl in vald, er zol di baralach rysen,
er zol di baralach rysen Poyerl vil nit baralach rysen, baralach vil nit
faln, baralach vil nit faln.

Shikt der har a hinteleh in vald, a hinteleh in vald, er zol di poyerl
bysen, er zol di poyerl bysen Hinteleh vil nit poyerl bysen, poyerl vil nit
baralach rysen, baralach vil nit faln, baralach vil nit faln.

Shikt der har a shtekeleh in vald, a shtekeleh in vald, er zol di hinteleh
shmysen, er zol  di hinteleh shmysen Shtekeleh vil nit hinteleh shmysen,
hinteleh vil nit poyerl bysen, poyerl vil nit baralach rysen, baralach vil
nit faln, baralach vil nit faln.

Shikt der har a fyerl in vald, a fyerl in vald, er zol di shtekeleh brenen,
er zol di shtekeleh brennen Fyerl vil nit shtekeleh brennen, shtekeleh vil
nit hinteleh shmysen, hinteleh vil nit poyerl bysen, poyerl vil nit baralach
rysen, baralach vil nit faln, baralach vil nit faln.

Shikt der har a vaserl in vald, a vaserl in vald, er zol di fyerl leshen, er
zol di fyerl leshen Vaserl vil nit fyerl leshen, fyerl vil nit shtekeleh
brennen, shtekeleh vil nit hinteleh shmysen, hinteleh vil nit poyerl bysen,
poyerl vil nit baralach rysen, baralach vil nit faln, baralach vil nit faln.

And sorry to say, I can't quite remember all the rest of the verses, since
we haven't gotten to the end in many years.  But the har himself comes in,
drinks the water and the angel of death comes in - der malech hamoves - and
I think kills der har and the baralach finally fall.  Maybe those are in
fact the last two verses.

Subject: di zogerke

Can anyone point me to some good, academic or otherwise, information on the
community role of the zogerke? I've got a lot of anecdotal material, and
some glancing references in academic books (Chava Weissler talks a little
about the role, but it's not her primary interest.) Any ideas?

A dank,

Charlotte Honigman-Smith
