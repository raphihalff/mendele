Subject: yiddish vegetarian writers

as an addendum to marjorie hirshan's protest at singer's comparison of
slaughtering chickens with the treatment of jews in treblinka, i must
add that adolf hitler was a vegetarian. (also a rabid anti-smoker, the
smoker in me must add.)

Subject: Let's not lose perspective

I wholeheartedly associate myself with Marjorie Shonhaut Hirshan's
lament (6.074,1) about the uncalled-for haughty attitude of the
English-language _Forward_ vis-a-vis its much older Yiddish sister
_Forverts_, soon to celebrate its 100th birthday.

But my joining Marjorie in her pain and compassion is not unreservedly.

While the style of her post was strongly worded, as is her wont, in
hefty, muscular language, and her heartfelt call to bear witness to the
gloriously vibrant past is rightfully perceived, my reservations concern
her occasional exaggerations bordering on the hyperbole.

As is well known, a hyhperbole is an exaggerated statement not meant to
be taken seriously, for example, "a stack of paperwork as high as Mount
McKinley."

Her reference to Yosl Mlotek as a "tank" is infelicitous.  First of all,
the image that the term "tank" evokes is that of destruction, while what
Marjorie certainly meant was his positive strength and influence in the
fields of the Yiddish language and Yiddish culture.

The biweekly section in the _Forverts_  called  _Perl fun der Yidisher
Poezye_ [Pearls from Yiddish Poetry], conducted by Yosl Mlotek and his
wife, the musicologist Khane Mlotek, is most excellent, two refreshing
center pages, like sweet and health-giving drinking waters miraculously
discovered in the desert.

Similarly, Yosl's biweekly two-page Section in the _Forverts_ called _In
der Velt fun Yidish_ [In the World of Yiddish] is an  excellent record
of all kinds of activities in Yiddish clubs and communities, with essays
by specialists of the history of Yiddish.

Both Mloteks are hard-working people, steadfast lovers of and believers
in Yiddish.  They deserve all manner of plaudits and a large,
beautifully embroidered "E" for Endurance.  They are devoted keepers of
the flame of Yiddish.  May God bless them!   But I am sure that they
themselves would consider the ascription to them as "glorious" as a bit
too _shmaltsik_,  that is, dripping with overstatement.

The inclusion of Ab Cahan's name among the perpetuators of Yiddish is
totally misplaced.  He certainly earned great merit as one of the
founders of the _Forverts_,  a great editor and journalist, but his
attitude towards the Yiddish language was definitely a negative one.

In his zeal to hasten the Americanization of the masses of Jewish
immigrants, he was ready to print in his paper their uncultivated street
language, that is Yiddish with an admixture of on-the-quick adopted
English words ("payde" for gehalt, for example), a style that came to be
known by critics  as "potato Yiddish."

True, Cahan published in his paper the rich, colorful scenes and reports
about Jewish life in Poland by Yud-Yud Zinger (Isaac Bashevis' older
brother), original works by Sholem Ash (until he started to write books
about the man from Nazareth), and the earthy sensual _Pandre_ novel by
the great Hebrew poet Zalmen Shneyer, a great opus in Yiddish of the
life of the Jewish underworld in Poland.  All this was not out of a
sense of respect and love for the creative powers of the Yiddish word,
but rather to maintain a hold on the subscribers _mit di mazolyedike
[calloused] hent_, in Marjorie's well-chosen expression, who continued
to want their newspaper waft with a_heymishn_ Yiddish from the old
country.

Yosl Mlotek informed me (personal communication) that Ab Cahan was
_against_ the Yiddish language shuln [schools] of the Workmen's Circle
and of the other secular organizations.

The tendency towards jumping to conclusions of exaggerated dimensions is
also evident in another instance.  When a well-composed light-hearted
post was published in _Mendele_ several months ago, its author was soon
hailed by one, in these very pages, as another Sholem-Aleykhem.

What a leap of misjudgment!  We had a number of humorist writers in
Yiddish (their names were actually enumerated here in response to an
query), but no one was-- or indeed could have been --justifiably
compared with the genius of Sholem Aleykhem.

Sholem Aleykhem left us a legacy of about 22 volumes, chronicling Jewish
life in its multiphasic dimensions, an authentic treasure of the
cadences of our spoken Yiddish, in monologues, short stories, and
novels, a multitude of memorable characters (remember Tevye the nilkman
and Motl Peysi dem khazns), with singular observations of and insights
into Jewish life.

The tendency towards hyperbole exaggeration is sometimes a result of
poverty. By this I naturally do not mean, God forbid, mental poverty.
It is rather the poverty of Yiddish life around us, the _bidne
maro'khe_ [wretched lot] of the Yiddsh reality with which we are faced.

This reminds me of a sad story I read many years ago.  A married man
left his family and hometown in Poland for Amedrica.  Upon receiving his
first week's paycheck, he sent his wife a five-dollar bill as an
_aderoyf_ [a down payment] for the hoped-for passage of his whole family
to America.  The wife put away the five-dollar bill in the attic for the
day of her and the children's dream.

For some reasons, however, the plan of the great and joyous trip never
came to fruition.  Many, many years later, the wife and mother, still in
Poland but now frail and advanced in years, died.

Her son, looking in the attic for some documents, found to his amazement
in an old dust-covered shoebox the hidden five-dollar bill.  And the
rumor soon spread in the shtetl that Yoy'ne Gimpel won _dos groyse
gevins_ [the big lottery]...

A greater loss than the putative silencing of the several Yiddish hours
on the WEVD _Forverts_ station is the closing of the unique journal in
Yiddish _Di Goldene Keyt_, a true _hemshekh_ [continuity] of the golden
period of creativity in Yiddish in the last century.

_Di goldene keyt_ was founded in Tel Aviv in1941 by Avrom Sutskever, the
wonderfully great Yiddish poet, a true and precious ring in the keyt
[chain]. The last issue, No. 141, was published in 1995.

While almost by definition the paid circulation of a high caliber
literary journal is a meager one, _Di goldene Keyt_was a beacon of light
in the world of Yiddish, and reached many devoted readers in large and
remote towns on all continents.  These subscribers were like the
tsadikim [pious, saintly men] whom God counted to justify the world's
existence.

This is a bitter loss to Yiddish, indeed a grave injustice.
