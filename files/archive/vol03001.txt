Subject: Friddish

I had a French teacher more years ago than I care to
count who claimed to have heard the following two
French-Yiddish bits:

	Exasperated teacher to children: Faites
attention! Un az nit vil ikh aykh gebm a klap a` la
te^te!

	Woman in the street, to acquaintance not seen
recently: Farvos komst du nit arayn zogn a bonjour?

This foolishness reminds me of an incident which
occurred during the year I spent in Israel during the
late 1960's. My mother came on a tour; on her day off I
rented a car and drove her to visit her only Israeli
relative, a cousin who had been born in Poland and made
aliyah during the 1930's. Her cousin spoke Polish,
Yiddish and Hebrew; my American-born mother spoke
English and Yiddish, so they had a common language, at
least in theory.  However, much of the visit was spent
with me sitting between them and translating, since my
mother's Yiddish was three-quarters English and her
cousin's was one-third Polish and one-third Hebrew.  It
made for an interesting afternoon.

Subject: Yiddish idiom

Can anyone help me with this one:

"Ich zoll azoi visen fin a buyze vyetchera!"

What is a buyze vyetchera?  This is apparently said
when one is not sure what to do next.  My grandmother
used it (and now my mother does) when unsure what
strategy to use in tackling a particularly difficult
contract in the game of bridge.

A buyze vyetchera may be Polish in origin.

Subject: Irregular plurals

Is it a coincidence that the words of non-hebraic
origin with Hebraic plurals (nar, por, doktor) end in a
reysh?

Subject: Fun shames

Tayere fraynt:

Mendele iz shoyn tsvey yor alt!  Ver volt zikh geven
gerekhnt mit tsvey yor tsurik az haynt zoln zayn 259
abonantn fun 17 lender un medines?  S'falt a moyre,
fleg zogn di bubbe mayne.  Ober s'komt oykh a freyd.

The shames does not know how sufficiently to thank
Mendele's contributors for the pleasure he's had in
working with them.  It has been a wonderful two years.
In the real world one often acquires enemies as well
as friends; in this world only friends.  One other
thing: just as fathers are proud when their children
ultimately know and understand more than they do, this
shames is proud to serve those who know more about
Yiddish than he does.

Bloyz eyn zakh feylt: ven me volt mer geshribn vegn
literarishe inyonim.  Nu, iz efsher in komendikn yor..

Zayt mir alle gezunt.
