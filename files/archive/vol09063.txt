Subject: Special issue of POLIN

POLIN, an annual devoted to the history and culture of Polish Jews,
announces a special issue on Jewish popular culture in Poland, under the
editorship of Michael Steinlauf of Gratz College.

Scholarship on Eastern Ashkenaz has tended to focus on elite culture and
canonical literature. Even modern Yiddish culture has generally been
approached from the perspective of "great works." The special issue on
Jewish popular culture will focus on relatively less explored but
historically vital cultural phenomena, primarily secular but also
traditional, often considered "low" or "marginal."

Submissions are welcomed on a broad range of topics including theater,
cabaret, film, press, music, literature and the visual arts. Papers making
use of new approaches to the study of popular culture are encouraged. While
it is expected that most of the volume will concern Yiddish-language
phenomena prior to the Holocaust, studies of related issues, e.g., the "Jew"
in Polish popular culture before and after the war, are also welcomed.

Submissions may be sent to the editor, Michael Steinlauf, Department of
History, Gratz College, 7605 Old York Road, Melrose Park, PA 19027.

The deadline for abstracts is September 1, 2000; papers will be accepted
until January 1, 2001.

Queries may be addressed to the editor at <msteinlauf@earthlink.net>.

Subject: Recollections about Yiddish teachers/ Zikhroynes vegn yidishe lerers

The Secular Yiddish Schools in America Collection, which is housed at
Stanford University Libraries, Department of Special Collections, in
Stanford CA, is pleased to announce that it has added a new category to its
classification system for processing donated materials to the Collection.

We are now documenting RECOLLECTIONS ABOUT MY YIDDISH TEACHER/S, and
encourage everyone who attended any type of Yiddish school, at any time and
any where in the United States and Canada to write their RECOLLECTIONS
regarding one or more of their teachers. From a historical and pedagogical
perspective, these descriptive memories shed additional light on "The Golden
Age of Yiddish Education in America" and help preserve the names of those
pioneering personalities who were at the forefront of this type of creative
bilingual and heritage-language education.

RECOLLECTIONS may be written in Yiddish and/or English, or may be recorded
on cassettes. For further information, contact Gella Schweid Fishman,
Special Consultant to the Secular Yiddish Schools in America Collection, at
the following Email address: FofSYSA@aol.com
 
and send all RECOLLECTIONS (AND DOCUMENTED PHOTOGRAPHS) to
Friends of the Secular Yiddish Schools in America Collection

Subject: Kotik's memoirs

As one raised in a Chassidic home, and having spent more than a decade
researching Chassidic groups and their history - I was appalled by the
quotation by Yechezkal Kotik (TMR 04.001). It is of course impossible to
claim that in a movement that numbered hundred of thousands, there weren't a
handful about whom it possibly could be stated "hasidim would meet in their
prayer hall for a jovial evening, little concerned, it seemed, for hungry
wives and children left sitting in their cold homes" To somehow indicate
that this was the norm is ludicrous and it is unfair historical fiction.
Though I obviously did not live among the chassidim Khotik claimed to know,
I have merited to meet and interview scores of men and women that truly
represent the Chassidm of yesteryear. (Some of these interviews - in Yiddish
- are part of a zamler project that eventually will be housed at the YIVO
Archives.) The true story even of the "poor" Chassidim is a totally
different one. It is true that sometimes the men were able to elevate
themselves spiritually and rise above their materialistic concerns by
joining their friends in the Shtibel, in many instances it was the wives
that accomplished just that - with their simple and powerful recital of
psalms.  It is unfortunate that Khotik chose to perceive only half a
situation, in a biased and unfair matter.  Chassidic lore is filled with
legends of the spiritually inclined woman that "warmed" her cold home, and
made her family feel "rich" by her spiritualism.
        
Instead of concentrating on those who seemed to neglect their family, let us
ponder for a moment on the power of a Chossid - to elevate himself above his
physical needs - and find happiness even in times of need. Men and women
alike fullfilled the Yiddish saying, "Mir hobin gornisht gehat - ober es hut
inz gornisht gefelt" - we had nothing, but we weren't missing anything
either - i.e. - we found happiness in our portion.
        
In addition, I was very disappointed that the editor chose to translate the
few negative words rather than the entire piece. Once again, I invite all
readers and editors to come for a Shabbos to Boro Park, Brooklyn - and see
and hear for yourselves - a living Yiddish culture - and a warm and close
family life.

Looking forward to hosting you,

Abraham Joshua Heschel
Boro Park, Brooklyn

Subject: Victor Packer

Tayere Mendelyaner,

Does anyone have any information about New York actor/poet/radio personality
Victor Packer (1897-1958) other than what appears in Zyberzweig's Leksikon?
I am especially interested in anything which would shed light on Packer's
Dadaist/avant garde poems and the place poems like them have among other
Yiddish poets of the time (A. Lutsky, perhaps.)

A groysn dank,

Henik Sapozhnik

Subject: a mentsh fun buenos-ayres

Frank Handler asked about Sholem Aleykhem's story, "A man from Buenos
Aires." (09.059).  It is one of the "ayzenban geshikhtes," or railroad
stories, found in most of the standard "ale verk" collections.  For example,
in the 1927 Folksfond edition, the ayzenban geshikhtes are contained in book
26, and the story is the fifth in the book.  A good English translation can
be found in Hillel Halkin's excellent 1987 volume, "Tevye the Dairyman and
The Railroad Stories," published by Schocken.

Subject: A Mentsh fun Buenos Aires

In reply to Frank Handler's query (09.059): 
Sholom Aliechem's A Mentsh fun Buenos Aires was included in his
Aizenban Geshikhtes. It was written in 1909.

Subject: oser

I'm not quite sure how Geoff Nathan (09.053)  arrived at his proposed
meaning of for Yiddish _o'ser_ ("Yeah, sure"). In the context he cites,
Velvl Golman's (9.060) ("entirely/altogether") is, instinctively, better.

In fact, however, the Yiddish noun simply means 'a prohibition' (cf.  
Israeli Hebrew _ze asu'r_ 'This is forbidden'). As an interjection in the
song that Golman cites, it's meaning is probably closest to the citations in
the Harkavi and Weinreich dictionaries _oser mir_/_oser zol mir zayn_,
glossed as 'God forbid'. (See, also, Weinreich _oser oyb ikh veys_ 'darned
if I know'.)

Subject: Derivation of 'Choizek'

Can anybody explain the origin of the Yiddish word 'Choizek', meaning fun or
ridiclule?

Is there any connection with same Hebrew word meaning strength ?
