Subject: Loksh

Chaim Rosemarin (vol 7.054) certainly brought back memories of a
Bensonhurst, Brooklyn childhood.   I do, indeed, remember that use of
Loksh.  Of course, my to-be husband, all 6'4" of him, was called lange
loksh as well!  The specific reference to him, of course, was still
spaghetti thin, but, of course, not his origin.

Subject: e-mails in Yiddish in our Yiddisher "Briv Fraynd" Club

Ikh bin zikher az Noyma Appelbaum (Mendele Vol. 7.057) un oykh a sakh
mendelyaner, hobn nisht gehat dih gehlehgenhayt tzu leynen, davkeh in
Mendele Online (5 Mar 1997), vegn dem Yiddishn "Briv Fraynd" Klub proyekt,

"pen-pal club", a feder-fraynd klub. Nu, der proyekt iz shoyn a fact, mihr
hobn biz aynt tzu tog: 78 Yiddisheh "Briv Fraynd"!  Nisht shlekht, emes?

        (I am sure that Noyma Appelbaum from Philadelphia (Mendele Vol.7.057)
        as well as many mendelyaner did not have the opportunity to read,
        there, precisely on Mendele Online (5 Mar 1997) about the "Yiddisher
        Briv Fraynd" Club project which could become, (as I wrote then), a
        world-wide Yiddisher pen-pal club.
        Nu, the project is already a fact, we have up to this date: 78, yes
        78 Yiddisheh "Briv Fraynd"! Not bad, don't you think so? ).

Ikh vel aykh alemen ibergebn nokh amol vegn undzer klub, ikh vel es
ibergebn nor oyf english, im'keday es zol nisht zayn a tzu langeh
prezentazyeh.

        (I will deliver again (the information) about our club, I will do it
        only in English so that it won't be such a long presentation).

Is, besides Noyma, any one else from our mendelyaner-friends interested?
Well, here is the all information again:

     HOT IHR SHOYN GEHEHERT? HAVE YOU ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THIS?
Tayere libhobers funem yidishn vort, KHOSHEVEH YIDDISHEH FRAYND:

HOT IHR SHOYN GEHEHERT FUN DEM YIDDISHN "PEN PAL" CLUB -DER "Yiddisher
briv-fraynd Club"?.
   HAVE you heard about the "Yiddisher pen-pals club" called "Der Yiddisher
Briv-Fraynd Club"?..
  NU, THIS is the story about it:
  On 1997, I started this project, which could become a world-wide,
Yiddisher pen-pal club. It operates through the international electronic
network of E-mail and also through snail-mail. (I chose to call it
briv-fraynd instead of feder-club because it describes more precisely what
it is all about).

   In its few months of existence, several people have enlisted in this
activity. 78 up to this date.
   We have already letter-friends, "briv-fraynd" from Australia, Canada,
France, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, South-Africa, Uruguay and from
USA and, of course, I count me also in, as the organizer of all this from
Mexico City!
   Not bad, don't you think so?  Nisht shlekht, emes?
   However, I would like to see an increase in the number of yiddisheh
fraynd who can take advantage of this opportunity through the E-mail system
and communicate in Yiddish with people from all over the world!
  Even if it is transliterated Yiddish, "iz dos ober dokh - ah yidish vort!"
even so, it is Yiddish words!

 Our Yiddisher "briv-fraynd" Club is more or less, divided in three group
-levels: beginners, intermediate and advanced. (The suggestion is that
advanced-group members should communicate with members of the other two
groups in order to help them improve their Yiddish and encourage them to
maintain their interest.  This, of course, does not exclude communication
among members of the same group level).

  I urge you to participate and spread the word about our Yiddisher
"briv-fraynd" Club in the hope that we all plant a seed that will flourish
to promote the survival of our beloved language!

 Ikh dervart fun ahykh ahle a baldikn entfer, I am looking forward to
receive from all of you, Yiddish-lovers, your reply, preferably written in
Yiddish, or if you so desire, in English or Spanish.
              Your Yiddisheh frayndineh - - - Freydl

Subject: P.S. to Gordin translation rights

To save you all the trouble of correcting me, the 4-volume set of Gordin works
was put out in 1910 by the Hebrew Publishing Company, not the _Forverts_.  I
was away from my desk, working from (obviously faulty) memory.  Forgive me,
Yankev.

Subject: Performance in Portland

For those outside the Pacific Northwest, a truly fine performance environment
and multimedia installation was created at Gallery 114, 1100 NW Glisan Street,
in Portland Oregon from 8/7-8/30. While the performances were listed early on
in Mendele, no words really summarized what director Michael Griggs, musician
Jack Falk (The Yiddish Hour weekly on Radio KBOO), artist Lawrence Kominz, and
sculptor/set designer Chris Harris created as an installation. 

The viewer entered into a study area: a desk piled with books-the top one in
Yiddish, eyeglasses left, coats left hanging. From there on into a devastated
Shabbos table setup- candlesticks overturned, pitcher spilt. Past a wall
inscribed with giant sheet music and overhung with prayer shawls into the
forest. The forest indicated by huge photographic blowups of forest memorials,
carved wooden memorials, stumps. and actual leaves underfoot. Around the 
corner into whiteness, the walls white "smoke" painted over faces peeking
through this "mist", white rocks underfoot with lit yahrzeit candles nestled
among them. Finally, notices of the recent Dybbuk performances, puppet
characters, a TV/VCR with tapes of last winter's trips to Hungary and to
Poland-it did me good to pop Jack's niggun into the VCR and hear a living
voice for a few minutes. The last objects on view: fresh hand towels, pitcher
and bowl-moving away from death with a symbolic ritual wash. The exit: tight
white sheets to part and pass through. All observations and opinions those of
this reviewer.

It was tremendously powerful. Yasher koach to all.

Subject: Articles on Yiddish

Since they appear in somewhat obscure plaaces, I thought it might be useful to
announce the recent publication of these two papers on Yiddish:

Alexis Manaster Ramer and Meyer Wolf. Yiddish origins and the
Austro-Bavarian problem.  Folia Linguistica Historica 17: 193-209.

Alexis Manaster Ramer. The polygenesis of Western Yiddish--and the
monogenesis of Yiddish. Indo-European, Nostratic, and Beyond: Festschrift
for Vitalij V. Shevoroshkin. (Journal of Indo-European Studies Monograph
Series 22), 206-232. Washington, DC: Insitute for the Study of Man.

Subject: Yiddish-language Anarchism

Dear all,

I am attempting to produce a bibliography of Anarchist materials produced in
the Yiddish language. If any readers know of any, or can recomend potential
sources of information, I would be grateful to hear (I have already contacted
both Dr. Vaisman and YIVO in N.Y. who have been most helpful).

If anyone would be interested to see the bibliography as it stands at the
moment, email me and i will send you a text file. You can laugh at my feeble
translations!

thanking you in advance

Subject: Mendele Bookmart...

Unser tayerer fraynt Leonard Prager hot aroysgebrakht a gute shayle: Vu ken
men take arayngeyn in a kram, un leyzn/oyskloybn  a Yidish bikhl?

I'll put it into English: Maybe its time that some of these huge book
establishments like Barnes & Noble, and Borders (both of whom have built
palaces of book establishments here in Washington, DC and elsewhere, and
even offer coffee and a place to sit and read )--maybe its time to advise
these people of the growing need to offer Yiddish books to the public--
just as Spanish, Chinese, Japanese, German, etc, offerings  are provided.
Couldn't YIVO drop them a line, or some of the universities?? How about
an e-mail from Mendele??

That's the dream, but where will the Yiddish readers come from???

Subject: Virtual Ashkenaz gets exciting

We are slowly building a community on the new Virtual Ashkenaz web-based
discussion site. This is a good thing, as it is not clear whether the festival
will sustain the site as the seed for future new Yiddish cultural events, or
move on. Participation now is vital.

In the meantime, there are active discussions about genealogy, the history of
the Yiddish language, Jewish music in Eastern and Central Europe, and the
usual meshuggas.

If you are able to use the world wide web, do point your browser to:
http://www.ashkenaz.org/virtual.html register (it's free!) and do join in.
There are currently 11 active discussion topics. More would be even more fun.

While you're exploring the Ashkenaz site, don't forget to explore the
RealAudio samples of festival events--everything from readings by Yiddish
writer Chava Rosenfarb to the Israeli Celtic-Arabic fusion band, Esta, to
Toronto's latest klezmorim, Hu-Tsa-Tsa. About 1/3 of the material is up, now,
and it will continue to arrive (including pictures from the visual artists)
until as much as could be recorded is available. For sounds, check out:
http://www.ashkenaz.org/sounds.html or just explore the festival site
http://www.ashkenaz.org/

Enjoy!

P.S. If you like what you see, this is the time to let the festival director,
Bruce Rosensweet (brosen@lglobal.com) know.

Subject: Josef Lin and other questions

A colleague has asked me for information about Josef Lin (or Lion) who was
editor of the journal "Mizrakh-yid" from 1920-21. She also wished to know
whether the Yiddish Pen Club or the Yiddish Writers' Union still exist in New
York. I don't know the answers to any of these questions and would be
grateful for any answers from Mendelistn to pass on to her. Thank you.
