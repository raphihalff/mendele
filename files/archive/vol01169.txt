[catching up on old issues here... Mendele is starting to
 overwhelm my mailbox, but it's all wonderful.  Shkoyekh
 all.]

What's the expression you refer to for keep an eye on?
Haltn an oyg of? (Doesn't sound right, or familiar, to me.)

We use hitn for this.  A babysitter is a kind-hiter.
(Should we be saying kind-hiter'n?)  "Hit di kinder veil
ikh gey tsum shokhn."

Which leads me to a followup question: how to translate
"while" in the above sense.  In cases where there is a
partial meaning of "because", veil might work; but where
it's purely temporal, it sounds wrong to me.  On the other
hand, I asked Mordkhe Shekhter (oh all right, Schaechter)
about this a while back and he said "veil" was acceptable.

The equivalents I know are "b'shas" and "az", but neither
of them sounds great in the above sentence ("Hit di
kinder..."). And veil sounds positively wrong in a setence
where the meaning is purely temporal ("Kon ikh geyn arop in
keler veil du bist in kikh?").

Suggestions?

Hitn, again.  Di mime hodel hot unz gehitn (I think).
Comments?

Has anyone ever done a translation/rendition of Casey at
the Bat into Yiddish?
