Subject: fisnoge, etc.

This is a reply to R. Harris' query of September 25, concerning Yiddish
_fisno'ge_:

1. The standard Latin-letter transcription of the word is _fisnoge_, with
initial _f_, not _ v_, and with one _g_.  Even the German cognate of the
first part of the word is spelled with _F_, not _v_.

2. The Yiddish word does, indeed, consist of near synonyms  in two
languages 'feet' in Yiddish, 'foot' in Polish. It parallels two similar
constructions that I'm familiar with:

        a) _baldza'res_, a construction in which the Yiddish word _bald_  is
joined by its synonym _zaras_ to mean 'soon', 'right away'. This is
interesting enough but, it doesn't seem sufficient evidence to permit us to
posit a regular pattern of such formations in Yiddish. I'd be happy to
learn of other such pleonastic constructions.

        b) _fisri'be_ 'fish' which, taken together with _fisnoge_ reveals the
mechanism at work--a device born of the need to disambiguate the homonymy
that results from the merger of _s_ and _sh_ in Litvish Yiddish where [fis]
or [fis'] represents both 'fish' and 'feet, legs'. _fisnoge_ is, thus,
unambiguously 'feet', _fisribe_ 'fish'.

3. _fis_ and _fisnoge_ also designate "jellied calves' feet", also known as
_petsha'(y)_ or _petshe'_ (usually eaten hot), or _kholode'ts_, the cold
variety. The distribution of the different lexical items will be the
subject of a map in a future volume of the Yiddish Atlas. A map in Volume
III (now in press), shows the distribution of the regional preferences for
the hot and cold varieties.

4. The food in question (German _Kalbssueltze_) , but not the cited
designations, was also known in the West, where it is generally eaten cold.

Any published reference to this information should be credited to the archives
of the _Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry_, housed at Columbia
University, New York, and published by Max Niemeyer Verlag, Tuebingen.

Subject: fisnoge yet again

Khaver Robboy provides a very nice summary of the state of the discussion so
far, though one might wonder, whether it is really necessary for us to rehash
the same topics so frequently. We risk boring our fellow Mendelyaner if we
don't check the records before returning to subjects previously treated. One
small amendment to Ron Robboy's remarks: It is not strictly speaking accurate
so maintain that '[t]he Litvish speaker would characteristically pronounce the
sounds /s/ and /sh/ in the same way, as /s/'. It is interesting that speakers
of sabesdiker losn are perceived by Yiddish speakers from other areas not to
pronounce all unvoiced sibilants as /s/ but to reverse the distribution of
/sh/ and /s/. This makes it clear that in reality an intermediate sound
between /sh/ and /s/ is being used, comparable to the Polish sound heard in
words such as 'siano' or 'sroda' (with acute accent over the s). The IPA
symbol for this sound is [c] with a small loop bottom right. The collapse of
two sounds in a language frequently gives rise to the need for so-called
'disambiguators'. Cf. in Standard American English 'horse-riding' to avoid
confusion with 'writing', where it is sufficient in British English to say
'riding' without fear of being misunderstood. Or in so-called Black English:
'writing pin' to avoid confusion with 'hair pin'. The loss of all (but nasal)
final consonants in the course of the development of Mandarin Chinese led to a
comparable need for disambiguators on a truly massive scale.

Subject: language and dialect

A partial dissent from Ellen Prince's recent posting re language and dialect
[7.067].  I DO agree that it is good linguistics to use these terms (IF AT
ALL) to mean, respectively, forms of speech where there is no mutual
comprehensibility and ones where there is, and also that (just like with the
parallel terms species and variety in biology), there are cases where the
definition fails. Where I do not agree is this: many people who are perfectly
good linguists use these terms more in accord with popular usage.  In the case
of Yiddish, Max Weinreich and Solomon Birnbaum were very emphatic on NOT using
the term language the way Ellen and I use it, and hence on treating Yiddish as
a language distinct from German even at the earliest times, i.e., when they
were (in our terms) AT BEST dialects of one and the same language (which I
like to call Old or Middle High Gerdish).  And, although they were a bit
old-fashioned even in their time, I find it hard to refuse to consider these
two scholars to have been, at least part time, linguists.

Subject: Upside-down Yiddish

While in no way excusing the recent gaffe in the YIVO fundraising letter 
(which I had nothing to do with, G-t zu danken!) Ron Robboy's suspicion is,
apparently, correct.  From what our fundraiser (who, by the way, is _FAR_ from
in charge here!) says, the mailing house YIVO uses doesn't provide "final
proofs," which would have included the infamous signature. (I'm sure that, in
the future, whoever prints our mailings WILL provide such proofs!)  At any
rate, as embarassing (and funny) as it was, it is not an indication of the
state of Yiddish at YIVO!  (I sure wish I could write upside so well!)

Subject: Fisnoge ishor yerokes

This is the second time that the word 'fisnoge' has come up for discussion and
I am surprised that on neither occasion has anyone mentioned the word
'galerete', sometimes abbreviated to 'gale', which is also jellied calves legs
with lots of garlic.

As this food is popular with gerer khsidim, who call it by the above name, I
assume that it is a Polish dish and that the name is Polish too.

While on the food issue, the UK Jewish cookery writer, Evelyn Rose, discussed
recently in one of her columns the origin of the word 'chulent'.

She claims it to be a makhloykes between Jewish food historians. Some believe
it to be a corruption of a medieval French expression 'chauldt lente',
pronounced 'sho lonte', which translates 'slow heat' and refers to the way
chulent is cooked. Others however believe the word to be a corruption of
Yiddish 'shul end' because that's when chulent is eaten.

And then she had a question about another dish.

'The recipe is more or less the same - based on soaked matse or matse meal
mixed with eggs, raisins and other good things. But how did it become
Crimselich in Alsace, Gremshelish in Curacao (via Holland), Crimsell in
Israel, Grimslechs in the oldest Jewish cookbook in the USA (published 1871)
and chremslach in Britain. Can anyone help?'

I was surprised by the question as the food she is describing has always been
known to me as 'knaydlekh' while 'khremslekh' always meant fried cooked
potatoes as opposed to 'latkes' which are fried raw potatoes.

Subject: language and dialect

Re Ellen Prince's posting in [7.067]:

The problem with this view (that linguists do or should take absence of mutual
intelligibility to be the criterion for determining that two language
varieties are "languages" as opposed to "dialects") is the fact that the
intelligibility of some related language variety often varies from speaker to
speaker _within_ a speech community.  If the intelligibility is individual
rather than collective, this should throw up a red flag.  The problem for the
"mutual intelligibility criterion" (for lack of a better term) is how common
these individual differences are.  The differences may have to do with
variations in individual (i.e. phonetic) sensitivity, individual language
attitudes, and other external variables.  This makes the mutual 
intelligibility criterion fairly problematic in my mind.  A dialect for one
speaker, and a different language for another? At that point, the distinction
starts to become pointless.

The morphosyntactic and phonological differences between language varieties
are unambiguous (i.e. we can identify the rules/principles), whereas mutual
intelligibility (or lack thereof) is too tied up with cultural/psychological/
performance phenomena to be useful to linguists.  I agree with Paul Glasser
that the "language or dialect" question is (or should be) beyond the scope of
formal linguistic research.  Naturally though, to say that two language
varieties are "Yiddish" is not to say that they may not differ substantially,
or that one is a "dialect of" the other.
