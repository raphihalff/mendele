Subject: errors

I would like to point out one interesting error that might save others
trouble in the future.  As Santayana said, "He who fails to learn from
history (my error in this case) may be forced to repeat the same error."

Rashi, in the Joseph story, has several comments about the word, na'ar
[nun-eyin-resh] used to describe Joseph.  In the first case Rashi takes
the word in its verb form to mean dandify oneself. In the second case,
Rashi says "shote [shin-vav-tet-heh]" or fool.  There is no doubt that
Rashi knows the primary meaning of na'ar to "youth" or "lad."

For some time now, I have been looking for evidence that Rashi knew the
German of his day and sometimes I imagine that he also knew Yiddish in
the tenth century, before Yiddish is generally thought to have arisen.  I
have found some 30 la'azim of Rashi's that are pretty definitely
Germanic.  So I jumped on this one; after all, narish, narishkeit, in
German and Yiddish both, means foolish.

But tracing down Rashi's source, it appears just that way, shote, in
Bereshit Rabba [Genesis Rabba], a 3rd century midrashic collection, long
before anyone spoke either German, let alone Yiddish.

My mistake, mea maxima culpa.  Of course the Teutonic word "lochs" or
variants of it, mean salmon or many, as in one, two, ... nine, ten, lochs
all the way down to the Middle East.  So I will keep trying and probably
make even more egregious errors.

Subject: Yiddish texts for Found Treasures

At the Toronto Yiddish Conference I arranged a meeting of Steve Dowling,
from the Workman Circle's Jewish Book Center, and publisher Margi Wolfe
of Found Treasures: Stores by Yiddish Women Writers.  The purpose of the
meeting was to encourage an inexpensive copy of the Yiddish originals for
the texts used in the book.  It was my understanding that all such texts
are available through Frieda Forman of Toronto, one of the book's
editors.  It was also my understanding that such a reproduction, in the
format of a study guide, so to speak, was feasible via Workman's Circle
facilities, and agreeable to the editor.

My original intent in encouraging this endeavor, enthusiastically
supported by other conference members, seems obvious.  However, a more
subtle, and perhaps equally as important reason is now apparent to me:
It has come to my attention from a variety of sources, that translation/
adaptation/ideological issues loomed large in the final and sometimes
arbitrary or unauthorized "editings" or proposed editings that took place
before the book's ultimate publication.

Thus, such a study guide would lend itself to discussion on many levels,
and be an important historical document, in and of itself, for this
noteworthy book, and even for future books. Further, it would allow for
the addressing of some of these issues if and when the book is reprinted
in Germany, Israel, or elsewhere.

As much as I, an essentially uninvolved reader of the book, admire it and
the work of the group, and the book's concept, I feel impelled to urge the
development of the study guide promptly. In an age of much translation,
too much adaptation, and a host of "isms", those of us who hunger for
each new source want to, must understand the context and history of that
which we read.

Subject: Yiddish words to Schubert's St\"andchen ("Serenade")

Listening to this song this morning, I remembered that my father had
taught it to me with Yiddish lyrics. Something like this:

Mayne lieder shiken tvilles
Durkh di nakht tsu dir
Shayn bistu
In gartn zitst du
Kum arup tsu mir

Nakhtigalen kenen fielen
Benkshaft, liebes, veh
Az zie vilen hertser rieren
Vaynen Zingen zay
Vaynen Zingen zay

Anyone out there know the provenance of these lyrics?

Subject: Curses!

Yud Rozof asks for Yiddish curses.  I can't provide any "real Yiddish
vulgarity," but I can share the words to a song I learned as a youngster
(some of the words are not Yiddish):

	Do, re, mee-sl
	Brekh a fisl.
	Neyn, neyn -- brekh a beyn!

	Ver geharget b'a treyn;
	Fal arunter fun a pleyn

	Ishke, pishke -- plots a kishke.
	Ahhhhhhhhhh-meyn.

Subject: Sholem-Aleykhem's wry aphorisms

Sholem-Aleykhem's ironic twists sometimes border on cynicism.  His
experiences with the rough money-grubbing publishing business may have
been a factor.  This may have moved him to propose humorous but wry
parodies of well-known aphorisms:

Here are a couple:

1. "Ver iz a khokhem?  Der vos lernt zikh op fun yedn eyntsikn.  Ver iz a
held?  Der vos nemt ayn dem yeytser-hore.  Ver iz an oysher?  Der vos
bagnugt zikh mit dem vos er hot."  (Azoy zogn di _KhZ"L_, (khes zayen
lamed.))  Un ikh zog:  Ver iz a khokhem?  Der vos hot gelt.  Ver iz a
held? Der vos hot gelt.  Ver iz an oysher?  Der vos hot gelt.

2. "Der vos ken gut mentshn, der antloyft nit fun mentshn un yogt zikh
nit nokh zey."  (Azoy zogt Mark Avrelius.)  Un ikh zog: Der vos ken gut
mentshn, der antloyft fun mentshn vu der shvartser fefer vakst.

Translation:

1. "Who is a wise person?  The one who learns from each and every one.
Who is a hero?  The one who controls his passions.  Who is wealthy?  The
one who makes do with what he has."  (So say our sages of blessed
memory.)  And I say: Who is a wise person?  The one who has money.  Who
is a hero?  The one who has money.  Who is wealthy?  The one who has
money.

2. "The one who knows people well does not run away from people nor
chases after them.  (So says Marcus Aurelius.)  And I say: The one who
knows people well runs from people to where the black pepper grows.

These are from a 1903 feuilleton, Aforizmen, in Di Yidishe Folkstsaytung.
