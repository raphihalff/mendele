A. As to the exchange between NM and Dave Sherman
[Vol 1.6]:

>     Since we had only one Sefer Torah it was
>     agreed that the Ashkenazim would leyn first
>     ...and we leyned after the roll call (Jewish 
>     Life, July 1973, pp.45-46).
 
D.S.:

       What's unusual here?  To leyn has a specific     
       meaning (to read from the Torah during servic    
       es).  What other word could you possibly use?    
       "Read" would *not* have the same meaning. The    
       same goes for Sefer Torah, which is a specific   
       object for which there is no other convenient
term.

To which Melekh says:
 
Mayn briv iz take zeyr shpet, ober ikh hob say vi a
bamerkungen afn vort 'leyn'.  ikh hob geleynt mit
etlekhe yor tsurik in a bikh fun (ikh meyn) maurice
schwartz (ikh hob in meynung, der vos shraybt populare
bikher vegn yidish. efsher hob ikh gemakht a tues mitn
familie numen).  in yeden fals, hot er geshribn in yene
bikh az in zayn gegnt in manchester, fleg men nitsn dos
vort leyenen bloys farn leyenen fun a seyfer toyre; hot
men genitst dos vort lesen far sekulare zakhn.
 
B. Regarding Mikhl Herzog's comments [Vol 1.22]

M.H.:
  
       As for the other indirect reference, "vus zugt   
       der ruv?", I've >had friends (in Toronto) who    
       never addressed their own parents >directly:     
       "Vus vil der tate?", "Tsi vil di mameshi zix     
       zetsn?"  
The following comment is not related to Yiddish in any
way (except that I have two children, one of whose
first languages is Yiddish):  In Malayalam, a south
Indian Dravidian language, it is very common to use the
name of the addressed person in conversation.  As, for
example, (talking to Noyekh), "Would Noyekh like some
tea?"
 
       A step further: My aunt (the only woman I knew   
       who was actually named Yente, zol zi mir hobn a  
       likhtikn gan-eydn, never addressed her husband   
       directly (at least in company). When I came      
       calling, she'd announce me to him (if he was     
       upstairs or at the back of the house) by call    
       ing out (bellowing?) "her nor, di: ('Listen,     
       you'), Mexl i du: ('Mikhl is here')". Note       
       "Mekhl" not >"Mikhl". You may know the process   
       from words like "lekht" 'candle(s)' (not         
       "likht"). Taken a phoinological step further,    
       the process yields "Makhl"; the feminine equiv   
       alents are "Mikhlye, Mekhlye, Makhlye" whence    
       the (matronymic family name Machlis.
 
Again, a comment of non-Jewish origins:
In India, it is not considered respectful for the wife
to use her husband's name.  Hence the husband is often
addressed in various ways, e.g. "Do you hear me?" 
"Father of (first born son)"  "Listen!" etc.;

From: "Arthur S. Abramson" <LINQADM@UCONNVM.BITNET>
Subject: Introduction

My name is Arthur (Aren) Abramson. I am a professor of
Linguistics at The University of Connecticut. My spe-
cialty is experimental phonetics: the pro-duction and
perception of speech.I have a great interest in Jewish
culture, including Hebrew and the various Jewish lan-
guages, especially Yiddish.Not having grown up in a
Yiddish-speaking home, I learned most of what I know of
the language later in life.Here on this campus some ten
of us have a Yiddish luncheon about once a month; we
read a story in Yiddish and talk about it, making sure
that everyone understands everything. I am an enthusi-
astic member of the National Yiddish Book Center in
Amherst, Mass.

Subject: Introduction

Hi. My name is Nicholas Eshelman.  I am a catalog
librarian at the University of Kansas in Lawrence, KS. 
Cataloging is very boring, but KU has a good basket
ball team, which helps.  I used to work at the New York
Public Library, also as a cataloger, where I worked
some of the time with Yiddish books, which was better
than basketball.  My Yiddish is OK as long as I don't
try to speak or write it. I enjoy the list very much
and am pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the
contributions.  I will offer some low quality contribu-
tions as soon as I can.  We just moved and I'm living
in the middle of a big confused mess, so it may be a
while.

Subject: Introduction

          I'm writing this intro.  on behalf of my
spouse, who does not enjoy direct access to the net-
work.  I will probably be less modest about her
achievements thatn she would be.

          Agi began formal studies in Yiddish as one of
the first graduates of the the Jewish Studies programme
at McGill University in MOntreal, under Ruth Wisse. 
She is Hungarian, and her family background is not a
Yiddish-speaking one.  After completing her BA she
moved to Israel where whe completed two M.A.  degrees
(Is that what they call M.A.  - M.A.  -loshen?).  The
first in Library Science, involved a study of Yiddish
books and readership in the 16th-century Mantua censors
lists, and a summary of it was published in Kiryat
Sefer.  Her second MA, for Chone Shmeruk in the Hebrew
University Yiddish department, was about the Mitsvos
Noshim literature (women's commandments).  A summary in
English appeared, I think, in one of the Field of
Yiddish collections (If Sigrid Petersen is listening, I
think it might fall within the definition of your
interests).  She is currently researching the begin-
nings of Yiddish liturgical translations, though at
present without an academic affiliation.  Her publica-
tion of a Genizah fragment of a Yiddish siddur
(cowritten with Ch. Shmeruk) appeared in Tarbiz 50.
Since 1985 we have been living in Calgary.
