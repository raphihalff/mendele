Subject: A Boy named Yi'vole

In the l930's, in Lithuania, I heard about a new-born Jewish boy who was
named Yivo, with the diminutive and endearing name Yi'vole.  Although
Jewish parents usually named their children after a deceased person, for
the purpose of perpetuating the name, calling a child Yivo was therefore
quite extraordinary.  Still, it sounded plausible knowing the love and
respect for YIVO many secular Jews, especially with a feeling of warmth
towards Yiddish, had.  But I never saw about it anywhere in print.

To find out the factual state of the matter, I recently  contacted
several people in YIVO (N.Y.).  Zachary Baker, librarian, and Marek Web,
archivist, also did not recall reading about it anywhere, and expressed
doubts about the authenticity of the story.  Thus, in their opinion, it
is most likely apocryphal.

Dina Abramowicz,  YIVO's reference librarian, referred me to Mr. Lazar
Ran, author of the three-volume, four-language "yerusholayin d'lite:
ilustrirt and dokumentirt" (Yerusalem of Lithuania:  Illustrated and
Documented ) in Yiddish, Hebrew, Russian, and English, published in 1974.
Ms. Abramowicz told me that Lazar Ran knows everything there is to know
about Wilna (Vilne). This I did.  And Mr. Ran advised me that there was,
indeed, a boy named Yi'vole.  He personally knew his parents and the boy.
His father's last name was Mark.  He was a teacher and a writer.

Subject: Heri zayn ondenk

Evelyn Feins's remarks (MENDELE 4.058) about her family's small town
dialect reminds me of something I heard at one of the more interesting
funerals I've attended.  Paul Novick, for MANY years the editor of the
"Morgn Frayhayt" (Morning Freiheit), died in his late 90s about five
years ago.    The completely secular funeral was conducted almost
entirely in Yiddish.  One speaker, probably a shtikl landsman of Ms.
Feins's parents, concluded his eulogy with the words, "Heri zayn ondenk."

Like the Puzzle-Master on NPR, I'd be curious to see how many MENDELnikes
come up with the right translation of those words...

Subject: Note on the Romanization of Yiddish in Mendele

This subject deserves a lengthy presentation.  The romanization of
Yiddish in Mendele does not bear even a semblance to the YIVO
Romanization Standard as adopted by the American National Standards
Institute.  The result is sheer confusion, a hodgepodge of multiple
individual capricious and haphazard spellings based mostly on aural
memories from childhood.

Today I wish to comment briefly on a recent posting by Frank Boches
(Mendele, Vol. 4.057, item 1) where he queries about the liturgical seven
"ato's."  He needlessly romanizes the Yiddish words "di zibn" as " die
sieben" (German spelling).  The German "die" in an English text is
particularly jarring because the eye tends to read it not as an article
(for the), as intended, but as a verb (to die--tsu shtarbn).  So who
needs it?...

Similarly, Evelyn Feins (Vol. 4.058, item 8) signs her posting with
"asheynem dank tzu allah."  But for the lower-case of the initial "a" of
the last word,  did she extend a sheynem dank to the Islamic deity
Allah?... What she meant, of course, was to "alemen" (all of you,
everyone).

We need greater care and self-discipline when romanizing Yiddish.
