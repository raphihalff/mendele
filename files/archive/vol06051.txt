Subject: der taytsh fun "shnek" (a frizur)

Joachim Neugroschel (6.049) asks about the haircut style named "shnek".
Weinreich mention the word schneck to mean a snail, or a screw. In
English (from German) schnecken refers to a spiral shaped pastry. Thus I
can speculate that the haircut named shnek or schneck is the old spiral
hair style where the hair was rolled in a spiral shape on the back of
the head. I remember seeing this kind of hair style in Israel in the
late fifties-early sixties by fancy European ladies.

Subject: Spinoza in Yiddish poetry

Allan Nadler asked [6.049] if there are any Yiddish poems about Spinoza.
We can inform him that Meylekh Ravitch wrote 20 poems about Spinoza
which are published in his book "Di lider fun mayne lider", Montreal
l954.  They are titled: ll/24, l632 - 2/22, l677; Lid fun zayn yugnt,
fun der hefkerdiker nakht farn kheyrem; Der kheyrem; Di verter fun
kheyrem; Raynsburg; Vizye; Der toyt; Vizye fun zayn letstn tog;
Teologish-politisher traktat; Di briv; Di geometrishe form fun der etik;
Di aynteylung fun der etik; Di etik - ershter teyl; Spinoza un du;
Fartsveyflung un fal; Hunderter yorn, oyto-da-feen --; Ru; In likht;
Kategorish lid; and Bashert iz mir efsher -.

In Itsik Fefer's famous poem "Ikh bin a yid" the 8th stanza starts: "Der
roysh fun markn amsterdamer / Hot mayn Shpinozen nit geshtert / Aleyn di
roymen makhn gramer."  (in his book Roytarmeyish).  A. Almi has two
passages: "Ikh her zikh ayn mit ale eyvrim, nervn: / Shpinoza shushket
epes tsum Rambam" (in his poem "Bikher") and "Az Moyshe iz toyt, /
Konfutsius, Sokrat, / Shpinoza un yom" (in poem "Lekhayim tsum toyt"),
both poems in his book "Shirot aharonot/Letzte gezangen".

Subject: Spinoza and Yiddish

There is a poem by Abraham Sutzkever on Spinoza which Allen Nadler might
like to look at. This is called "Shpinoze" and is on p.593 of Sutzkevers
Poetishe verk, vol.1. It is an extended version of a poem called "A
nakht mit shpinozn" which was published in the volume Lider in 1937.
The two later sections were written in the Hague and Amsterdam in 1947.
The differences between the two versions is interesting- the different
use to which he puts this figure illuminates developments in his life
and ideas in the intervening ten years.

Subject: Chasha

According to _Jewish Personal Names: Their Origin, Derivation and
Diminutive Forms_ by Rabbi Shmuel Gorr, Chasha is a variant of the
biblical name Ketziah (Job, 42:14).  Ketziah was the name of one of
Job's three daughters and of a variety of cinnamon used in the incense
offerings om the Temple in Jerusalem.

Subject: Yiddish theatre in Montreal

A book on the history of the Yiddish theater in Montreal has just been
published.  Here is the bibliographical information:

Larrue, Jean-Marc.  _Le theatre yiddish a Montreal_ = Yiddish theatre in
Montreal.  Foreword and postscript by Dora Wasserman.  Montreal,
Editions Jeu, 1996.  166 p., illus.  ISBN 2-920999-04-4

The price of the book is approximately $25 (Canadian).  Its North
American distributor is Agence de distribution populaire, 955, rue
Amherst, Montreal, Quebec H2L 3K4.  In Europe is is distributed by
Editions Lansman, Rue Royal, 63, B-7141 Carnieres (Morlanwelz), Belgium.

The text is in French and English (parallel columns), with Dora
Wasserman's contributions also appearing in the original Yiddish.

Jean-Marc Larrue is a Quebec theater historian who has also written a
book on the history of the Monument National, the venue for much of the
Yiddish repertory that was performed in Montreal.  (The Monument
National was built and for many years owned by the Association Saint
Jean Baptiste, which is best known as an organization that is devoted to
Quebecois cultural and political nationalism.)

Larrue's book treats the history of the Yiddish theater in Montreal from
its beginnings to the present day.  Most of the photos accompanying the
text -- even those sections dealing with the earlier history of the
Yiddish theater -- are for productions of the Yiddish Drama Group of the
Saidye Bronfman Centre, a highly accomplished amateur troupe that has
been performing since 1958, under the direction of Dora Wasserman (who
has lately been succeeded by her daughter Bryna Wasserman).  All in all,
a significant contribution to the Yiddish theater outside of its North
American center of New York City.
