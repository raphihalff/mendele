Subject: Kotik's _mayne zikhroynes_

Abraham Joshua Heschel writes (09.063) that he's shocked by the passages in
Yekhezkel Kotik's _mayne zikhroynes_ that are less than flattering about
hasidic family life in the Kamieniec of his day. He wants to refute Kotik
with evidence from interviews with "men and women that truly represent the
Chassidim of yesteryear".  Since Kotik was born in 1847 and was describing
his home-town situation as he saw it in the 1850's and 1860's, I don't see
how he can turn the trick by talking with people who were born decades
later.  Such materials are about as relevant to the matter at hand as is the
invitation to visit Boro Park, welcome as that might be on other grounds.
Now if we had evidence about hasidic family life dating from the period in
question...

My own trouble with Kotik is that he was given to pop-theorizing and sloppy
thinking.  His simplistic account of the rise of hasidism is a prime example
of what the anthropologist Evans-Pritchard once called "if-I-were-a-horse"
theory. Begin with noting that Jewish life in eastern Europe was highly
stratified, follow with the inference that the poor must have felt
humiliated -- and behold! an "explanation". That's why I'm skeptical about
the "hungry wives and children left sitting in their cold homes". Granted,
there are other accounts (beginning with the Brody kherem) that depict many
hasidim of an earlier day as irresponsible loafers, boozers and the like.
But even if that's the sober truth it doesn't follow that the scene at home
was as cheerless as Kotik says it was.  Did he see such blighted homes with
his own eyes?  He doesn't say. Making unwarranted inferences is an
occupational hazard of the Platonist and I suspect Kotik's making up facts
again: if the father is living it up with his cronies, then perforce the
rest of the family sit and suffer.  Maybe so, but I'm with Aristotle and
insist on evidence.  And if there isn't any?  nu, az nisht iz nisht.

This quibble notwithstanding, _mayne zikhroynes_ is a fine literary work and
should give most readers considerable pleasure. In the weeks ahead The
Mendele Review will be publishing more excerpts, in both romanized and
annotated Yiddish versions.

porechke is currants. It comes from Polish porzeczka (nothing to do, if you
want to know yiddish you have to learn Polish, as Chone Shmeruk z.l. once
wrote).

From: Larry Rosenwald <LROSENWALD@WELLESLEY.EDU>
Subject: right to ask a question

With respect to the dispute over Seth Wolitz' response to Marjorie Schonhaut
Hirshan's question about Ruth Wisse - I thought it might be worth stating my
own sense of that dispute.
        
I took the original question to be, whether Ruth Wisse had some obligation
to restrict her public utterances to those having something to do with Y. L.
Perets, for whom I gather her Harvard chair is named, and indeed some
obligation to make her public utterances be in concord with Perets' spirit
and aims. Seth Wolitz's answer was, as I understood him, no and no.  I agree
with him on both counts.  I think that holding a tenured position in an
academic institution, whether with an endowed chair or not, means above all
that one is free, and so almost obliged, to state what one thinks and
believes as an intellectual and a scholar.  Surely Ruth Wisse is doing just
that.  I disagree with a lot of what she says, both about the fate of
Yiddish and about Israeli and American politics, but I think that by
articulating her positions she's doing just what she should be doing.
        
There's another question, too, which I'll raise but not comment on, and that
is, mightn't it be possible that, in Ruth Wisse's view, what she's doing is
in fact _in accord with _ Perets' legacy and spirit?  I can well imagine she
might argue that it is.
        
All the best, 
Larry Rosenwald

Subject: Ashlekh, patelnye

Itzik Goldenberg guessed "that ashlekh is some kind of green vegetable"

Ashlekh is scallions.

Patelnye is frying pan, as Itzik figured out.  It may have come from Polish
patelnia.

Subject: Victor Packer

Henik Sapozhnik inquires about actor Victor Packer [09.063] -- or rather
about actor/poet/radio personality Packer.  The poet part was new to me, and
most intriguing.  Where might we find the poetry Henik describes?  My own
interest in Packer was sparked by his having joined, apparently very soon
upon his arrival in America, the experimental theatre group Undzer Teater,
which existed for only one season in 1924-25 in New York.  Growing out of
the Yidisher Teater Gezelshaft, a theater studio project founded by Mendl
Elkin and publishing the "Tealit" monthly journal, Undzer Teater had a joint
artistic directorate consisting of Elkin, Peretz Hirshbein, H. Leyvik, Dovid
Pinsky, and Khayim Shneyer, and a company of very skilled and serious
actors. Their one season consisted of three productions:  Pinsky's "Der
letster sakhakl" (my translation a la 1980s: The Bottom Line); Elkin's
reconstruction of An-sky's "Tog un nakht"; and "Shtekhik drot" (Barbed
Wire), a dramatization by Ayzik Raboy of his own first novel, "Her
Goldenbarg."

Work I did at YIVO two years ago on this dramatization made me more aware of
Packer.  Playing an old, widowed and somewhat unhinged gentile farmer on the
plains of the North Dakota, Packer had a major role as the principal
antagonist to Raboy's nominal subject, Mr. Goldenbarg, the successful Jewish
farmer.  Packer's son had fallen in love with Goldenbarg's daughter (or
niece, in the original novel), who was in turn in love with a young Jewish
farmhand.  This was the conflict driving the action of the play. The Jewish
love interest was played by Clara Miller, who was then married to Packer.  
By the time Zylbercweig was writing about Packer in the Lexicon article
Henik mentions (late 1950s), Packer had evidently been married to someone
else for some time.  Goldenbarg was played by Egon Brecher, who worked in
Vienna before coming to New York; he eventually showed up in Hollywood,
where he had a role in Zanuck's "The Sins of Man," a screen adaptation by
Dr. Ossip Dymow [sic!] of Joseph Roth's novel "Job, the Tale of a Simple
Man."  The Raboyesque role of the young Jewish farmhand, the one beloved by
Clara Miller's character, was played by Jacob Bleifer, who, like Brecher,
had also distinguished himself in German theatre, working with Reinhardt and
others, but had come to America as a Yiddish actor with the Vilner Troupe.  
Packer's son in the play, the one competing for the Jewish girl, was played
by Yoysef Grinberg, who later changed his name to Joseph Green for his work
as director of several classic Yiddish films ("A brivele der mamen," "Yidl
mitn fidl," etc.) as well as some acting credits in Hollywood.  Zylbercweig
reported that actor Yankev Bergrin, who was playing Green(berg)'s brother,
was absent from the last few performances of "Shtekhik drot" and that his
role was performed by Yehude Bleich.  Though Bleich had a long and
respectable career as an actor, my own interest in him stems from his having
produced "Dos goldene land," a probably unremarkable box office hit of 1943
with Lebedeff, Ludwig Satz, and Leo Fuchs -- unremarkable except for the
utterly remarkable insertion of a Wagnerian quotation it contains in the
verse to (at least) one of the songs by Alex Olshanetsky.

Well, that was tangential.  But what may be of help to Henik is that
Packer's substantial collection of papers is held by YIVO -- nearly nine
linear feet.  The "Guide to the YIVO Archives" describes it has containing
"papers pertain[ing] to his stage and broadcasting career...[s]kits, lyrics
and poems written or adapted by Packer" and other material.  When I was at
YIVO, just before the big move to the new Center, it was not possible to
access the Packer Collection, so I cannot say more about what is in it,
though I am dying to know.  At the time, it was described to me as
"extensive" but "not processed."  I took the latter to mean that there was
no finding aid, and that the items may not be wholly organized by document
type.

Do let us know, Henik.

Subject: Yiddish idioms

Re Naomi Ribner's request for idioms (from Mendele 09.065) -- These subjects
are exactly the theme of James Matisoff's book _Blessings, Curses, Hopes,
and Fears_. I found it at the NYBC and have seen it on various book lists
posted on Mendele and elsewhere.
