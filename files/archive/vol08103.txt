Subject: Khoyzek

As Mikhl Herzog said (8100) Khoyzek does not derive from the
hebrew, though
all dictionaries "fun Hebreismen in Yiddish" (Spivak 1926, Krupin
1957,
Lewin 1958)  include it because of the hebrew form and the doubt
it could
derive from the identical hebrew word for "strength, force,
intensity".
Harkavy believes it comes from the Middle High German "hosche"
or the Old
High German "hosc" (i.e. - mockery), Bernstein and Spivak follow
him.  But
more interesting is that "Khoyzek" xame from the Yiddish into the
hebrew.
"Khozek" or "Ma'asse Khozek" meaning "jest", and "Makhazaka"
in the same
meaning.

Subject: khoyzek

With further reference to Elozor Oisher's query [08.098]
concerning the
origin of "khoyzek", is it not at least likely that the word is a
semi-jocular coinage that arose among Yiddish speakers in
Eastern Europe
playing with a Hebrew shoyresh? Can we not imagine "khoyzek"
having been
generated as a pseudo-kal present participle from "khazak,
lakhazok" 
playfully imagining it to be conjugated like "khazar, lakhazor", the
semasiological twist having something to do with strong
language? Of course,
as Mikhl Herzog points out [08.100:2], there may well be, as so
often is the
case in Yiddish etymologies, some reciprocally reinforcing
contribution from
one of the coterritoral languages.

Subject: From Treves to Dreyfuss

I thank Joachim Neugroschel for his helpful remarks about the
relationship
between the German town of Trier and the Alsatian family name
of Dreyfuss. 
It is a strong argument and has been long suggested as being the
geographic
origin of many Alsatian Jews who bore the name Dreyfuss. 

However, there is another point of view with respect to that
name, one
having to do with house signs.  We all know that the Rothschild
family is
suggested to have been named that because an ancestor lived in
a home
identified by a "Red shield" and, thus, they eventually assumed
that house
sign as a family name.  The argument about "Dreyfuss" is similar,
namely
that some progenitor lived in the house with the sign of a "tripod"
or
"Three feet" which, of course, became "Dreifuss" and whose
spelling was
subsequently modified to "Dreyfuss." 

The name is as common to Alsace as Smith or Jones and, though
most spell it
"Dreyfuss," a substantial minority spelled in "Dreifuss" in the 18th
century, as attested by A. A. Fraenckel's "Memoire Juive En
Alsace, Contrats
de Mariage au XVIIIeme Siecle," a book that I have been
indexing for almost
two years. 

I do not suggest that Mr. Neugroschel is incorrect in his point
about the
relationship between the Yiddish for "Trier" and "Dreyfuss" only
that it is
one of two suggested origins for the family name. 

In a bizarre case of "back to the womb," there is, in Meridian, MS
an
important building called "The Threefoot Building."  It was built
for the
Dreifus family branch that moved there and prospered.  One
branch of that
sub-branch finally changed the name to "Yard."  You also find
another
variant of the name in the elegant glove manufacturer,
"Treyfoos."

Subject: regional variations

Zachary Baker raises a very interesting issue about current
Yiddish--namely
the use of the accusative feminine singular article after a
preposition. 
However, this usage is not new, and language observers might
want to study
to what extent this trend is rooted in European Yiddish.  In
regional
Yiddish (Central, i.e. "Polish" Yiddish), the dative & genitive of the
feminine singular is pronounced sort of "de"--sounding almost like
the
nominative/accusative form "di".  And authors using that regional
trait
spell the dative/genitive feminine singular article "di".  An
excellent
example is the prose of Sholem Asch, whose story "Di Mayse mit
di (!!!)
Sheyne Mari" (like most of his fiction) is filled with countless
instances
of this widespread deviation from standard Yiddish. I've also
found it in
many other Yiddish writers. 
        
For the record: to prevent the outbreak of an all-out standard vs.
dialect
war, I am simply observing this usage and neither condoning nor
condemning
it. 
        
Another source may be the attempts by some Yiddish writers to
follow Russian
or German usage rather than Yiddish usage.  in DER SHRAYBER
GEYT IN KHEDER,
Lamed Shapiro explains that when he began writing in Yiddish, he
looked to
Russian grammar as a guide--specifically the Russian distinction
between the
prepositional case after a preposition describing location and the
accusative case after a proposition describing motion (the
difference in
English between "in" and "into").  Shapiro tells us that he
deliberately
made that distinction in Yiddish--where it is more noticeable since
Yiddish
has definite and indefinite articles and Russian doesn't. 
        
Other Yiddish writers may have been following German usage,
which likewise
distinguishes between the dative for location (Ich stehe im Haus)
and the
accusative for direction (Ich gehe ins Haus).  In both Russian and
German
this distinction applies only to certain prepositions. 
        
Unlike the component languages, Yiddish plurals do not indicate
case or
gender, so that might have a flattening effect on
singulars--especially
since the masculine singular article in Yiddish is "dem" for
genitive,
dative, and accusative.  And in Litvak Yiddish there's no neuter,
hence no
distinction between accusative "dos" and genitive/dative "dem"
for nouns
that are neuter in other dialects and in standard Yiddish.

Subject: standard Yiddish vs. the dialects

I dont quite understand why people are wasting so much time
and energy
arguing the pros and cons of standard Yiddish vs. the dialects.
And I dont
quite understand why the pro-dialecters are attacking the YIVO.
The YIVO,
by co-sponsoring the Atlas of Yiddish Dialects, has done far more
for
Yiddish dialects than the pro-dialect squawkers.  Without the
Atlas, we
would know next to nothing about the Yiddish dialects (aside from
earlier
scholarship in the Soviet Union).  The YIVO has no power to
enforce the
standard language--and those people who don't want to use it
don't have
to--indeed shouldn't. 
        
I suppose it depends on why an individual is interested in Yiddish.
If you
want to read Yiddish literature, then you'll have to face
the--perhaps
unpleasant--fact that most Yiddish authors wrote more or less in
a standard
language, though possibly with regional coloring and some
regional
vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar.  If you want to read
Vaisenberg,
then naturally you'll have to learn Polish Yiddish, and your input
would be
invaluable.  You might then, of course, learn dozens and dozens
of Yiddish
dialects to read those authors who used a heavily regional
Yiddish.  I wish
you luck.  Being very lazy, I prefer learning standard Yiddish
alone, which
enables me to read most Yiddish literature. 
        
The thing I understand least of all is:  if you prefer Yiddish dialects
to
standard Yiddish, why don't you post your messages in dialects?
Why stick
to English--and standard English at that?  If you dont wish to
write in a
Yiddish dialect (even though you vociferously champion it over
standard),
why dont you write in an English dialect?  Liverpudlian or
Manx--why give in
to a snobbish elite that insists on using standard English?

Subject: English in Yiddish / Yiddish in English

Marc Sacks wrote:  "The infusion of English into American haredi
Yiddish
would be a fine study for a folklorist; I suspect someone must
have done one
by now." 

Take a look at _Frumspeak: The First Dictionary of Yeshivish_, by
Chaim
Weiser (Jason Aronson Inc., 1995). It's available at Eichler's and
similar
Jewish bookstores. It's more about Yiddish/Hebrew used in
English as spoken
in the frum world than about the use of English in Yiddish, but
obviously
there's a continuum and a mid-point where it would be hard to
identify which
is the base language being spoken. (Our home is starting to
sound like that
as our kids use more English.)

Subject: Mame Loshn NW

Despite a sudden snow storm preceding the opening of Mame
Loshn NW 1998 the
event did take place with approximately 1/2 attendance Sat night
and 2/3
attendance Sunday day. Only two of ten workshops did not take
place due to
faculty that live on hills. The caterer's van got stuck 6 blocks from
the
center and the dinner had to be brought down in 4-wheel drives.
Whoever
thinks Yiddish will die is wrong. Paula Kirman came from
Vancouver BC on the
bus (8 hours instead of 3). The Bertram Levy Klezmer Trio came
from Port
Townsend as did guests from Port Angeles and Bellingham. (The
Portland
contingent stayed home as the storm was moving south.) In
general, depite
local travel advisories not to travel unless absolutely necessary,
and the
complete unavailabilty of cabs, people would not stay away! 
     
Some highlights: Pesakh Fiszman, NYC, who flew in a day early to
go
sightseeing, got a little lost, and used his Spanish to get directions
back
to Northend Seattle. People here were delighted and inspired by
his visit! 
He had mild and sunny weather the day before the snowstorm,
and NO rain at
all in Seattle! His teaching was extraordinary, not just an
"appetizer", but
real meals. Other levels of Yiddish proficiency were handled by
Rita Katz. 
     
Gerry Tenney, Oakland, jammed with Bertram Levy, as well as
finding one of
his "kids" from Camp Kinderland, now all grown up with a kid of
his own.
Gerry's set for the children's program attracted all the adult
musicians too
and functioned as teacher training as well as fun.  The children's
program
included a mix of art, music, gym, stories and songs. 
     
It was an intergenerational event that included both children and
seniors,
with some charming moments, especially when the smell of
cinnamon wafting
from the rugelach baking brought people hurrying to the kitchen.
A twelve
year old was praised "She's good!" by someone else's
grandmother, who was
also the one who showed us all how to shape the rugelach. 
     
Seattle musicians Susan Lewis and Janet Stecher led a
participatory workshop
on Songs of the Activists, focusing on the history of the Spanish
Civil War
and of Labor Organizing.  They have been collecting and
performing of social
change movements for over two decades. 
 
A special thank you to the Jacob T. Zukerman Fund of the
Workmen's Circle/
Arbeter Ring as well as to the Forward Association for the basic
funding to
get the Pacific NW Branch's event off the ground. Additional
thanks to the
Secular Jewish Circle of Puget Sound as well as the Seattle
Yiddish Group. 
The University of Washington Jewish Studies Program also
supported Mame
Loshn NW as part of their effort to create an accredited
Elementary Yiddish
course in Seattle.The Department of Germanics will offer a 15
credit 9-week
course this summer June 21-August 20, 1999.

Subject: latkes/doughnuts

I always believed that the reason for eating latkes on khanike
was its
association with oil. Well, according to a book I bought my son for
khanike
there is another reason. 

latke is similar to late, yidish for patch. This is supposed to
symbolise
the thirteen breaches in the wall of yerisholayim by the forces of
antiyokhes which were then 'patched' up. 

According to vaynraykh yidish for doughnuts is donats. Had
vaynraykh not
heard of pontshkes?
