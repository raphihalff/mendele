Subject: Purim-lid

The Purim song that Shimen Kass asked about (4.388) may be #539 in Y. L.
Cahan's collection (_Yidishe folkslider mit melodyes_, published by YIVO
in 1957):

	A gutn purim, a gutn purim, mayne libe gvirim!
	Haynt hobn mir yom-hapirim,
	vet ets hern di groyse vinder,
	vi got hot geholfn zayne yidishe kinder:

	Homen iz gevezn shuldik
	Akhashveyreshn a khoyv,
	hot er im gezogt,
	di tlie iz oyfn hoyf.

		Zingen mir, loybn mir:  shoyshanes yankev!
		Zingen mir, loybn mir:  shoyshanes yankev!

	Homen hot zikh gezetst shpiln
	mit Akhashveyreshn a shokh,
	hot men gevorfn goyrl
	oyf ifte [= kumendike] vokh.

	Farflukht zol vern Homen
	vos iz geven der ergster!
	Gebentsht zol vern Mordkhe
	vos iz geven der bester!
	Gebentsht zol zayn di malke
	vos hot geheysn Ester!

	Kum ikh arayntsushpringen
	oyf a fisele loyz [= nit-shtayf, tentsldik],
	heyb ikh on tsu zingen,
	der doles iz mir groys.

Cahan explains the refrain as an allusion to the Purim song "Shushanas
yankev tsoholo vesomeykho" [which in turn alludes to Esther 8:15:  "and
the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad"].  The song was collected in
Warsaw.  Noyekh Prilutski includes four variants (##71-74) under the
title "Shoyshanes yankev" in his _Yidishe folkslider_, 1 (Warsaw, 1910).
He also includes a Polish version of #71.  (#72 is one of the so-called
"mishshprakhike lider" with alternating stanzas in Yiddish and Polish).

Subject: Sholem-Aleykhem and Gogol (cont.)

Thank you, Jason Payne, for your reference to the article by Joseph
Sherman's study, "God and the Tsar" examining "restorative laughter" in
Sholem-Aleykhem and Gogol.  I will try to find it at UCI.  Is that Joseph
Sherman a Mendele khaver?  I bet he is.

Sholem-Aleykhem found in Mendele Moykher Sforim a guiding light for
himself and for Yiddish literature.  He was an avid reader of Russian
literature as well and (as I previously pointed out) found a kindred
spirit in Nikolai Gogol's approach to humor, an approach harmonious with
his own.  On pp. 188-189 of Dos Sholem-Aleykhem Bukh, I.D. Berkowitz
sheds a bit of light on a style Sholem-Aleykhem admired and probably
tried to emulate.

Among his personal papers, Sholem-Aleykhem kept a special envelope as a
kind of lucky charm.  It contained a passage in Russian from Nikolai
Gogol's "Dead Souls" freely translated into Yiddish.  My translation is
of Sholem-Aleykhem's Yiddish translation:

Un lang nokh aponim iz mir bashert   Much later, it seemed, fate
mit yenem vunderlekhn koyekh tsu     granted me the glorious power to
geyen hant bay hant mit mayne        walk hand in hand with my strange
modne parshoyndlekh, un tsu          little characters; and to
batrakhtn dos groyse tumldike lebn   contemplate this great noisy,
durkh an ofenem gelekhter,un durkh   muddled life with outward laughter
farshtelte, farborgene trern.        disguising secret tears.

While that sort of approach to humor is often depicted by the cliche,
"Laughter through tears," the Yiddish expression, "lakhn mit
yashtcherkes" is stronger.  Literally, it means "laughing with lizards."
Go figure!

Subject: Hagode songs in Yiddish

Mikhl Herzog posted a Yiddish version of Ekhod mi Yoydaya, and asked
about other Yiddish versions of hagode songs.

After the second seder, my father and I sat around, going through some
old tunes, and he mentioned that his grandfather (who he never met) used
to sing a Yiddish version of Adir Hu, from which his mother (my
grandmother) vaguely remembered some words and part of the tune.  The
refrain, (which in Hebrew is "Ayl bnay, Ayl bnay, bnay bayskho
b'koroyv,") in Yiddish went "Nun bow, Nun bow, bow dayn templ shiire."

Then, this afternoon, I browsed through an exhibit on Yiddish at the
University of Toronto, where I saw a facsimile edition of a manuscript
hagode from Prague, open to the last page.  I think it was the full text
of the Yiddish version of Adir Hu, although I had a hard time making it
out. I found the sentence "bow dayn templ shire," but didn't see the word
"Nun."

My father theorized that "Nun" is some sort of archaic form, analogous to
'Sir.'  Anyone have any other ideas?

I presume that the word "shire" means something like 'soon,' since it
translates the Hebrew word "b'koroyv."  Does anyone know a precise gloss
for it, or better yet, an etymology?  (If I wasn't mistaken about the
hagode I saw in U of T, the word my father pronounced "shire" was spelled
shin-yud-reish-yud.)
