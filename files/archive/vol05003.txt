Subject: Introduction

I've been enjoying Mendele for over a month; it's time I said hello. As
a child I heard a good deal of Yiddish, but like so many others I never
learned to speak. In recent years I've had the very great pleasure of
studying Yiddish literature in Rabbi Ben-Zion Gold's ongoing class held
at Harvard-Radcliffe Hillel. From several of my classmates I heard about
'mendele.'

Thanks to the research of Andrew Cassel I learned a good deal about the
birthplace of my father's family, Keidan in Lithuania. My mother's
parents came from Aysin, a town in Podolia, near Odessa. My mother
remembers her father going to meetings of the 'Aysinerfareyn' in
Philadelphia, where we lived.

I knew nothing else about the place till I came across the name in two
Railroad stories by Sholom Aleichem, "The Convoy" and "The Miracle of
Hoshana Rabo", which I read in translation. There it was spelled
"Heissin" but I surmised that this could be a fictionalized portrayal of
the same place. In those stories the town has a large fair and a prison.
Does anyone know whether this is  fact or fiction?  Does anyone whose
parents or grandparents belonged to an 'Aysinerfareyn' have more
information?  Thanks.

Subject: Introduction

My name is Russell Block and I have been lurking around the list for some
time without a formal introduction.  I am a native New Yorker and
professor of English at the Fachhochschule (Polytechnic) in Munich,
Germany. I came to Yiddish originally through my interest in Germanic
languages. As a senior in college - now a long time ago - I did a paper
on my grandfather's Polish Yidish, comparing it to standard Middle High
German. (Yes, I am one of those linguists, who concern themselves with
phonemes and the like.)

Grandpa David, was not your traditional zaide with a love of learning far
beyond his station in life.  Although he was once fluent in Yiddish,
Hebrew, Polish, Russian and German, he strongly believed that you are
what you do and as a tailor (a skilled tailor not an operator, mind you)
he saw no need to show off his learning.  He was, however, an
enthusiastic native speaker informant and was absolutely delighted to
help me with my study of Yiddish.

He would have loved reading mendele - as I do.

Subject: National Yiddish Book Center

NYBC should hire whatever contractor it likes.

As a supporter of the NYBC, I couldn't care less if they deal with
non-unionized labour.  Their object is to do their thing: collect and
distribute Yiddish books, educate about Yiddish and Yiddish culture, etc.
The unions that were such a part of Jewish life in the early 1900's in
New York were fighting for much more basic rights than unions today.  Any
construction worker who is working for a non-union contractor on the
NYBC's new building will still be making a far better living than the
Lower East Side tenement dwellers who unionized to make the sweatshops
safe and bearable.

I will be happy to write to the NYBC and tell them they should use
whatever bidder will do the best job at the best price.  That's where
they should be putting the funds donated to them, and which they hold in
trust for purposes of their work -- not for someone else's union's
agenda.  To choose a more expensive option for the sake of using
overpriced union labour would be a breach of that trust.

Subject: Farvos oykh nit dem tatn?

Ruvn Millman published in Mendele 4.423,3 a heartfelt mazl-tov
announcement on the occasion of the birth of a son to Naomi Cohen and
Sender Botwinik (Philadelphia).  It is hoped by all that the boy will
grow up to be a future Yiddish speaker and a Jr. Mendelyaner.  The
announcement included the customary statistics of weight and length (the
height measurement at this stage), and closed with the following
sentence:  "Bagrisn kent ir der mamen af E-mail ncohen@sjuphil.sju.edu".

Why only her?

According to all statistical probabilities, it was a collaborative
undertaking, and the closing line of the post might therefore be emended
to read:

"Ir kent bagrisn beydn _  der mamen un dem tatn _" (same E-mail address).

Subject: Vos iz a "melupm kind"?

From my childhood in Lithuania I remember the expression "melupm kind"
(child) as referring to a very young child.  (For some time I even
thought wrongly that it meant a neonate.)  The word "melupm" is spelled
in both Hebrew and Yiddish mem, lamed, melupm vov, langer nun, but in
pronunciation the nun takes the sound of /m/.

Recently I asked myself what is the connection, if any, between "melupm
vov" and "melupm kind"?

As we all know, melupm vov is a vov with a diacritic -- a dot to its side
to indicate that it is pronounced /u/.

Uriel Weinreich, in his Yiddish-English/English-Yiddish dictionary
glosses "melupm kind" as a "babe in the woods," which, to my mind, may as
well refer to an _adult_, to a lost soul who frequently finds himself
"farblondzhet," even when the road, so to speak, is to all around him
clear and unencumbered.

I believe that Alexander Harkavy's definition is more to the point
(Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary, 1928):   An abecedarian, a child who
learns the alefbeys.  As illustration of the meaning, he offers the
following idiom:  "er iz nit kayn melupm kind" -- he is no fool.

So "melupm kind" is a reference to the smallness of the child, a
_pintele_ (a small dot of a) child, like the diacritic dot alongside the
"tall" vov.
