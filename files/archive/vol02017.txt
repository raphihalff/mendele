The expression "mise-meshune" is used in the Morning
Blessings, before the Order of the Sacrifices. There is a
section called Tefilas Rabi which says,

        "It should be your will .... to rescue us this day
        and all days from Aze-Ponim and Azus-Ponim, ...,
        from libels, mi'MISA MESHUNA, from bad diseases,
        ... "

This isn't particularly related to Yiddish, but... Which
sider (siddur) do you have?  In the corresponding tfile in
my ArtScroll, I couldn't find mise-meshune.

2. Meyashev is often used for ironic or comic effect:

Iz zikh meyashev dos redl un falt arop fun vogn.
Iz er meyashev un heybt on shrayen 'Gevald! A fayer!'

Which is something like the American 'he upped (or went)
and died'. Do other European languages go in for this sort
of thing?

-------------------------------------------------

I remember the first line of a well-known Czech novel,
Dobry Vojak Schwejk, (from the days long ago, when I tried
my hand at Czech): Tak nam zabili Ferdinanda, which as I
remember it is translated--So did Ferdinand go and die on
us. This sounds similar to your use of 'meyashev' above.

Subject: shlemazzel

I was told by a friend that modern Hebrew has adapted
shlemazzel into the Hebrew shelo-mazal = without "luck".
This is similar to the suggested etymology for shlemazzel
of shlim mazel. I don't know if shelo-mazal was coined
based on the possible etymology, or just based on the
similarity of the Yiddish to the Hebrew sounds. I also
don't know if shelomazal is a "folk word", or a more
official coinage (eg, Ben Yehuda.)

Subject: Introduction

My apologies for not responding to this request. Between
papers, grants, presentations, chickenpoxs, and a new child
- I'm a little behind in my responses. I am an associate
professor at Einstein in the Bronx (New York). We have a
"yiddish kreise" that has about ten participants every six
weeks. The circle discusses literature, events, words, and
"yiddish language self-help" (sich alein). It is composed
of faculty with an average age of 68. The circle was the
innovation of Julius Marmur (who will try to join your
list) who came a hair-breadths away from a Nobel prize for
his work on DNA in the early 1960's. (The Forvarts carried
his discoveries under the title of "der yerusha material").
He is a gem. We are joined by many other "stars" (I am der
yingvar, and clearly littlest in stature of the group at
the age of 41). Any other information - I would be
delighted to supply. My thanks for allowing my
participation - Julius will follow.
