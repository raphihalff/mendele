Subject: openers / replies to "vos makhstu?"

Here's a twist: if I'm cooking or baking in the kitchen, and one of the
kids, wanting to know what I'm making, asks "vus makhsti?", my answer is
"borekh hashem".

They hate it.

Subject: Openers

Another standard response to "vos makhst du" is: "Ikh makh mit di hent."

A slight variant on Mel Goldstein's father's response (Mendele 7.165) does not
rely on the advanced age of the respondent, but may simply be a statement of
relief, or perhaps even frustration: "Keyn kinder makh ikh nisht."

Subject: A.Openers, B.Adar, G.Grayz.

Olef.  Openers:

-Vus ert tsikh?

1.  -Me gult tsikh yn me shert tsikh.
        Yn se vakst nokhamul.

2.  -Me zugt a lign yn me shvert tsikh.

Beys.  Nothing about Uder actually. About Shvot:
       Khomeshuser biShvot,
       Ver farkoyft, - der ot!  This saying is without any specific sense, I
assume - just for the purpose of rhyming. 

Giml.  From the spoken language I know the word grayz ( as 'graz') only in the
sense of a written mistake or error, i.e. 'shraybfeler'. Why is that?

Subject: Playful openers

A colleague sent me a copy of "playful openers upon meeting a fellow Jew". I
wish to add the followig: A friend of mine, when asked by me "Vus makhstu?"
replied "Fun a lefl a kritchik". I puzzled over this until I encountered a
colleague named Krzyzek (pronounced "kritchik). It is a Polish name and means
"cross".So - "Vus makhstu?". "A cross from a spoon."

Subject: nasality in Yiddish

Can any Mendelyaners tell us about "nasality" in Yiddish.  What are the
origins of the words <fonfate> (twangy) and <shnofldik> (nasal).  <Shnofldik>
is not found in Weinreich.  To me the word sounds like a vernacular
onomatopoeic for <nazal> (nasal).  Does anyone claim to know?  Is there a
relationship between nasal speech and: 
1)  Regional dialects 
2) Working-class or rural speech

Subject: Odem a mentch un katchke rik zich

Sarah Faerman asks if anyone is familiar with "Odem a mentch un katchke rik
zich" and "Shoyne chasene gemacht".  My parents came from Brezine in Poland,
close to Lodz.  Quite a distance from her people's biirtplace.  Still I was
very familiar with both expressions and agree fully with her translations.  I
want to thank her for reviving these expressions for me which I have not heard
in probably 50 years.  It has brought back many kind memories.

From: feller@indirect.com (Morris Feller)
Subject: mir/mikh

In response to Sam Kweskin (07.171), the verb "answer" is not a transitive
verb in the phrase "answer me".  The phrase really is "answer to me" with the
"to" understood.  It, therefore, takes the dative form for "to me"  which is
"mir".

Subject: vyomer-dovid glitshn

I'm extremely grateful to Meyer-Leyb Wolf for his reply to my question
regarding vyomer-dovid glitshn, not to mention impressed with his dogged
determination and/or memory (depending on whether he actually spent two years
researching it, or recalled it after happening on the reference.)  As the
moderator pointed out, it once again underscores the Mendele khavershaft's
remarkable tenacity. 

All that being said, however, I remain unclear about one thing: just what was
the point of "glitshn zikh zitsndik, onshparndik beshas-mayse dem kop af der
hant" ? Skating sitting down, resting the head on the hand? I skated quite a
lot as a kid, but I'm afraid I still can't see it ...
