Subject:  Text for "The Adventures of Menakhem Mendel"

Thanks to all who provided help on my question about
the Adventures of Menakhen Mendel.  I'll surely be
writing to the National Yiddish Book Center.

The unasked question (which edition) was important, and
so is the answer, for my Yiddish is certainly not so
good that orthographic differences won't cause trouble!

I checked in the McGill library.  They have no less
than four sets of "ale werk fun sholem aleykhem"!
Three are the folks-fond edition ('17-'25), one is the
morgn-frayhayt edition ('37).  All appear equivalent
to me except for the numbering of the volumes.

I checked the Menakhem-Mendel volume (2 or 10).  I see
the correspondence between the man and his wife, but
nothing that looks like a play (or am I going to see a
man and a woman on stage 'reading' the letters?!).

A little book on Sholem-Aleykhem I'm reading now
mentions this correspondence and also that the author
reworked this material into an epistolary novel later
(which, I presume, is what I see).  Again no mention of
a play.

Is the play perhaps an adaptation for the stage by
someone else than the author?  Anyway, I think my best
bet at this point might be to get in touch with the
folks of the Montreal Yiddish Theater and ask them :-)!

Unrelated question: anyone have an opinion on a book
published in '64 by DTV (Germany) called "Jiddisch,
Abenteuer einer Sprache"?  Title is certainly enticing!

A groysn dank,
Pierre[le] Lewis

BTW,  I tried replying to Zachary directly, but my
mailer (expectedly) didn't grok the address (...@rlg).
What might it be as seen from Internet?  Should I add
.bitnet?

It occurs to me that this is a mild threat in Russian
and a bigshot is one who can issue threats.

Subject: Ya tebe dam

The phrase "Ya-tebe-dam" in Yiddish is almost
invariably (in my great and extensive experience of
listening to my parents use it to us kids) accompanied
or rather preceeded by the two words " a groisser" The
words themselves are of course Russian and literally
mean "I'll give you"! The entire phrase was taken to
mean " You think you are such a hot shot or a big deal,
don't you. However, in the original  Russian the phrase
suggests, "I'll give you what for"! So I think that the
sentiment is admonitory. ie. watch yourself kid or you
are going to get it! I don't believe that it was at all
admiring, but in Jewish usage it sort of had a
"chutzpenik" ring to it, as though you might possibly
really be worthy of admiration from somebody's point of
view, but certainly not from mine (ours)! It might
evenhave shortly preceeded another warning "Ich vell
dir bald aroplozen a por petch" or "Lomir zehen fun
vanen die fis vaksen". Naturally, upon hearing the
latter phrases I knew enough to make myself scarce!

I have a question myself for any Mendelnikes who might
be interested in how Yiddish might have sounded in
White Russia or Lithuania several hundred years ago,
say before the war with France. We know that spoken
English was remarkably different in sound. Is there
anything like a tape where someone has researched and
then attempted to duplicate forms of speech of those
earlier times in terms of word sounds and injections of
Russian or Polish speech in specific terms? I realize
that war and peace will not be decided on the basis of
your responses but I'd like to have them anyway. A
groissen dank!

Subject: IdYid/id

Traditionally, ALL Yiddish words beginning with a
vowel, EXCEPT for the "e" vowel, are spelled with an
initial aleph. This is simply a continuation of the
Hebrew pattern which requires words to begin with a
consonant. Both alef and ayin (which renders Yiddish
"e") are consonants. No recourse to taboos is
necessary.
