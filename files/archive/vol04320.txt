Subject: Jacob P. Adler's memoirs

My friends and colleagues Tsirl Kuznitz and Dovid Braun have answered
Noyekh Zide's queries about the Yiddish versions of Joseph Buloff's
memoirs (they appeared in Di goldene keyt, no. 116/117 ff.) and the
folktales collected by Bina Weinreich (who is indeed working on a Yiddish
edition; translations into other languages are also in the works).

Now to the Urtext of the Jacob P. Adler memoirs: They were not published
in book form, in Yiddish.  According to the "Leksikon fun der nayer
yidisher literatur" (vol. 1, col. 25), Adler published a series of
articles, "Mayn lebns-bashraybung," in "Theater zhurnal" in 1901.  These
were later expanded and edited (anonymously) by Yoel Entin, under the
title "40 yohr oyf der bihne," and published in the daily newspaper
Varhayt/Wahrheit (April 30, 1916-Feb. 22, 1919; presumably not every
day!).  Another series of memoirs by Adler, entitled "Mayn leben,"
appeared in "Di naye varhayt" (March 14-July 18, 1925).  (See also the
bibliography, appended to the article on Adler, in Zalmen Zilber-
tsvayg/Zylbercweig's "Leksikon fun yidishn teater," vol. 1, col. 27.)

Subject: Kashe, klots-kashe

To Yude Rozof:  _klots-kashe_, from _klots_ 'log', relates to the image
of putting a log -- a stumbling block -- in front of someone.  So a
_klots-kashe_ which is foolish is one that is, by nature, unanswerable.
A _klots-kashe_ which poses great difficulty is also unanswerable -- it's
difficult to cross over the log to get to the answer.

To Yale Reisner:  To be even more precise, Yiddish _kashe_
'(intellectual) question; (intellectual) problem' comes from Aramaic
_kashya_, which is the adjective form with the definite article, I think.
_kushia_ is used in Talmudic Aramaic and Modern Hebrew Talmudic
discourse, but somehow Yiddish incorporated the adjectival form and not
the noun form.  You'll notice that when _lernen_ is done in Yiddish, you
speak only of a _kashe_.  When _lernen_ is done with Modern Hebrew as the
vernacular for discussion, it's _kushia'_.

Subject: Anumelt

In the past week, both in a Yiddish newspaper and some reading, I came
across the word "anumelt," which Weinreich and Harkavy define as
"recently."  That word was not in my (admittedly quite meager) receptive
Yiddish vocabulary, and I puzzled about its possible etymology.

From its sound, I assumed a Germanic root, but found no cognate form in
any of several German dictionaries. Undaunted, but bolstered by courage
born of linguistic naivete and profound ignorance of the languages at
issue, I tried Polish, Czech, French and even Hebrew/Aramaic (Jastrow)
dictionaries with no success.  I even looked for forms assuming that the
initial "a" was a prefix.

Does anyone have information on the derivation of "anumelt"? Might it be
a contraction? Also, is it considered a rare form, or is it frequently
used?

Subject: Meanings of "mentsh"

The Yiddish word "mentsh" can have three meanings: 1) person, 2)
employee, or 3) something inexpressible in any _single_ English word.
Weinreich offers "responsible/mature person" for the third.  Harkavy
daytshmerizes to "mensh" and ignores the third meaning.  I figured this
evocative Yiddish word deserves a little more reflection.

I've long felt that "mentsh" exemplifies the expressive power of Yiddish.
However, my assertion (4.310) that only Yiddish has such a word was
clearly too broad.  I haven't checked all languages. Martin Davis (4.313)
cites a passage from the Magic Flute libretto in the original German to
suggest that the German "Mensch" can sometimes carry the same force as
the Yiddish "mentsh."  I have asked Yiddish speakers who also speak
German, Hebrew, French, Russian, or Hungarian, et al. whether they know
of a _single word_ in the other tongues that has the resonance of
"mentsh."  The answer has been, uniformly, "No." Checking two
comprehensive German-English dictionaries (Harper Collins and Oxford
Duden) yielded no translation of Mensch (German) that had the ring of
mentsh (Yiddish).  But usage often transcends dictionary definition.  The
Magic Flute passage cited by Martin Davis certainly suggests that.  I
would be very interested to know how English translators have understood
that bit of German.  Further, the other-worldly, supra-human, magical
ambience of the delightful Magic Flute plot suggests caution in
interpreting the libretto.  The plot reflects the arcane symbols of
freemasonry.  Both Mozart and Schikaneder (the librettist) were
Freemasons.

I can't express the "mentsh" concept in any one English word, but I
believe I can approach that elusive ideal with a number of words: a
reliable, empathic person who has matured beyond narcissistic
self-absorption, whose stable identity supports character autonomy that,
in turn, steers toward community responsibility and toward _humane_
thoughts, words and actions.  Halevay!

What a lofty goal!  But that takes nothing away from the Yiddish word's
power to inspire one to extend limits.

I once asked two people (both fluent in English, Russian and Yiddish) if
Russian had a _single_ word like mentsh.  They said no, but to express
the same idea in Russian, they rattled off a couple of reverberant
phrases in voices filled with cheerful admiration.

Subject: Tevye as a father

The class I'm teaching on Yiddish literature in translation is keeping me
very busy, but is a lot of fun.  We are now finishing *Tevye the
Dairyman* and I want to share some interesting discussion points with
you.  I'd be interested in any feedback/discussion.

To me one of the most interesting discussions the class has had has been
about Tevye as a father.  What kind of a father was he? The story of his
daughter Chava is what promted this discussion. My students came up with
a list of qualities that were "fatherlike", or that were important for a
father to have. Their list, as I wrote it on the board was something
like: caring, compassionate, supportive, loving, helpful.... So I asked
them to add to the list some stereotypic father images, since their
initial group compiled list read like a description of a 1990's sensitive
new-age guy.  They added: authoritative/tarian, strong, always right,
learned, family leader, dominant/neering....

An interesting discussion ensued.  Did some of their "stereotype"
characteristics need to exist in a father?  or in a parental unit? The
class decided that some authority was necessary from parents. (This was
not an obvious decision for the students.  They took some time arguing
about it, but decided that teaching boundaries, right from wrong, giving
direction--these things came from some authority in the parents.)

So, did Chava's marriage to Fedka have more to do with Tevye's "lack of
fathering" than some other options?  As the class (of mostly young women)
was split--half identifying with Chava and half with Tevye in the
story--was it Tevye's own doing, that he "lost his daughter"?  Is this
picture of a present but "non- fathering" father representative of a
larger issue/problem in the Jewish community of Tevye's time?  of today's
time? Did God, the ultimate father-figure, fill some of the need for
authority in the family? enough?

Anyway, the class was exciting/ed.  We're not done discussing the book.
They were also very into discussing Shprintze (the daughter who kills
herself) in contrast to/compared to Chava.  Which loss was greater, more
painful for Tevye, etc.

Subject: Zemtsovskii's Jewish folk songs

Does someone have the correct address to obtain Zemtsovskii, I.I. "Jewish
folk songs" St. Petersburg, 1994.  The address John Rauch, Center for
Jewish culture & creativity 423 N Palm Dr Apt 102 LA CA 90007 is not
correct.
