Subject: Introduction

Tajere Chavejrim!

I am a Lithuanian student studying at Brandeis University. I have been in
the U.S. for a little bit more than a year. I grew up speaking Yiddish as
the main language although Lithuanian started pushing it somewhat once I
started going to school . I did not have any significant education in
Yiddish for obvious reasons, however I did learn to read and write
recently.

I just joined the list and it seems to have huge waves of discussion
regarding latinization of Yiddish. I was tired to read the entire
discussion, but it seems that people have their strong opinions and will
stick to them. I will stick in a couple of Lithuanian letters for Yiddish
sounds once in a while, so please do not get angry. It is just easier for
me. Since we do not use the right letters anyway (Hebrew, that is) I do
not see the reason for a huge argument. Just for your reference c is more
convenient than ts or tz or the German z. Z could actually stay as z
(like in zoo). Eastern European languages having an entirely phonetic
spelling might be more useful as a base for "latinization" of yiddish.
Actually the "latinization" does not sound as a very inspiring term. We
know where Latin is /nit af unz gezogt/. I will welcome any further
comments or questions. I do have some information on Lithuania if anyone
is interested.

Subject: Introduction

I am a new subscriber to mendele. I was born in Vilna in 1938 and came to
Israel when I was 12 years. During the war my mother, uncle and myself
survived on "Arian papers." I did not I am Jewish until the war ended. I
learned Yidish in Israel. I read and enjoy Yidish litereature and poetry.
Such interests are far away from my daily business which is lasers and
electronics.

I am pleased and grateful for being a subscriber to Mendele. The argument
is always full of vitality as befitts Mendele Mokeher Sefarim
(Sefoyrim?).

Subject: Romanization of Yiddish and Hebrew

Could the appropriate pages (8-11 and 22-24) of Hebraica Cataloging be
scanned into the computer and then sent out to Mendele subscribers? This
would probably qualify as "fair use" under copyright law.

Subject: Sheva Zucker's book

I've been back on MENDELE for a few weeks and have been lurking
(skulking?) and catching up. A few things:

1. A Yiddish study guide has been published by the Workmen's Circle and
KTAV. The title of the book is "Yiddish: An Introduction to the Language,
Literature and Culture" by Sheva Zucker. It has been many years in the
making. When we originally announced it, we advertised the price at
$16.95. Since then, more pages were added and the price has gone up to
$19.95. Those that ordered the book at the original will have it sent to
them shortly at the original price at no additional charge. Yiddish
teachers that appear on Fishl Kutner's Yiddish Teacher list will receive
a 20% discount on their initial order. If you're a teacher and aren't on
his list, you should be.

2. A special offer to MENDELNIKS. If you order the book and identify
yourself as a "MENDELNIK", you will also receive the discount if you
place your order before 11/7/94. You can order the book electronically at
Yidbooks@weiser.com or by calling 800-922-2558 ext.285. Please include
your credit card and the expiration date when ordering. To order by mail
send a check to The Jewish Book Center of the Workmen's Circle, 45 East
33rd Street, NY NY 10016.

3. For those that do not yet know, Yiddish activist and "Klal-tuer" Avrom
Kahn passed away recently after a long battle with cancer. I cannot tell
you devastating his loss is to the Yiddish speaking world. He was
involved Yiddish organizations including YIVO, Yugntruf and the League
for Yiddish Congress of Jewish Culture and the Workmen's Circle. He
arranged Yiddish reading circles, Yiddish song groups and was devoted to
all Yiddish causes. My branch of the Workmen's Circle, Hemshekh Branch
105 is sponsoring a meeting in his honor. It will take place October 31,
1994 at 6:00pm at National Headquarters of the Workmen's Circle, 45 East
33rd street, NY NY 10016. All are invited. In his memory, we have started
the JTZ/Avrom Kahn Yiddish Culture Fund. Income generated by this fund
will be used to support Yiddish song groups. This was something he truly
loved. It is hard to believe he is no longer with us. He will be greatly
missed.

4. Workmen's Circle Branch 105 is planning its calendar of events. Our
Yiddish Film series and Yiddish Song Group will be continued. In
addition, we a planning a Yiddish Immersion Weekend at Circle Lodge in
upstate New York, the weekend of June 9th, 1995. It will be a lively
weekend of language, learning, music and fun. When I have more details
I'll let you know.

5. On the subject of Yiddish vacations, I've noticed that in my absence,
Henry Sapoznik is now part of MENDELE. Excellent! Perhaps, if he hasn't
already he can let us know how things are coming with the upcoming
Klezkamp and new group that has been formed to organize it, "Living
Traditions".

6. Several people have asked me if they can be on The Jewish Book Center
of Workmen's Circle's electronic mailing list. We currently maintain a
snail mail list. Following the announcement of Sheva's book, I received
orders and requests for catalogues. While this is great for the Workmen's
Circle, I wonder if it doesn't destroy the open and non-commercial nature
of MENDELE. Much of what I've writen above is in the nature of a business
announcement. Is it wrong? Is this the place for such announcements? If
not here, where would a book like Sheva's be publicized? Am I worrying
over nothing?

Mit Frayndshaft,

Stephen Dowling

[Says the shames: not to worry.  Such announcements are well within
bounds.  Indeed, we're all grateful. nm]

There are too few people let alive who truly rejoice in Yiddish... Hitler
was so thorough ... Let there be two groups of us... orthographic purists
and other Yiddish lovers.  I say amen to Axelrod's suggestion!
