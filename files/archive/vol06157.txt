Subject: Slavic influences on Yiddish syntax

Thanks to Ellen Prince for the broad-ranging discussion of some putative
examples of Slavic influence on Yiddish syntax.

Some brief comments:

multiple wh-fronting -- I'm puzzled about your problem with getting examples
from informants. 'ver vos zogt...', 'ver mit vemen hot getantst...', 'vos
mit vos shtimt nit...' etc. seem pretty unexceptional to me, though they are
like Olshvanger's instance and unlike your sentences calqued from Slavic
languages. Maybe its only possible in embedded sentences 'ver vos zogt
gedenk ikh nit' may be OK but 'ver vos zogt' is not because, unlike the
Slavic languages, Yiddish doesnt do multiple wh-fronting in main clauses.

position of zikh -- I'm more likey to be misled by another fact: Yiddish
also allows the older order as well 'zey zenen gekumen zikh gezegenen mit im'.

double imperative -- There are other idiomatic expression with 'geyn' which
also seem to lack imperatives, e.g. gey(t) shoyn gey(t) 'go on!'.

I don't think the double imperative is peculiarly Yiddish; we dont know how
widespread the construction is in the German dialects or even in the
Germanic languages. English has it, for instance ('go tell Aunt Rhodie ...'),
but there is no straightforward negation, cf. 'don't go telling your
mother...'. It seems to be connected with the "go and" construction, but I'm
not sure what the historical details are.

Subject: Yiddish Poems for beginners

I would recommend the book of poems by Eliezer Schindler (z"l) (He his
Rabbi Alex Schindler's father and was an expert on Chassidut)

The poetry is a delight, of simple vocabulary, musical (there are
several tunes by Jehoshua Wisser, a noted library immaginable. So check
yours--who knows?

Subject: On writing subject titles

In a recent post (6.148) our Noyekh Miller discussed at some length the
importance for archival reasons to properly title a subject topic, and
to show at the same time the connectedness of different contributions on
the same topic.  This will, of course, facilitate future research in the
_Mendele_ volumes.

To shape a good and proper subject title is an art in itself.  Big
newspapers have people specializing in writing headlines -- to distill
the contents of a news story or article in a few, short words.

The art of writing a subject title over a post to _Mendele_ is in many
respects similar:

Herewith, a critical sample of my own:  I published here an item with
the subject title. "Do iz nito in nishto" (6.142).  Admittedly, I was
misled (captivated, if you will) by the sound of the serial
komets-alefs.

For greater clarity the subject title might have read "Do iz _mer_ nito
in nishto ["mer" no more], or even more accurately and to avoid any
possible ambiguity, "do iz mer nito in 'nishto farvos'."

True, the effect (or the "subjective" charm) of the triple komets-alefs
would have been lost for the sake of greater precision and inclusivity,
but that is one of the problems:  do not try to squeeze everything into
a subject title, It should by all means stay short.

And so, to all Mendelyaner:  E-mail to _Mendele_ your posts
(contributions) with appropriate subject titles to ease, in some
measure, Noyekh's burdens. As you certainly know, all contributions to
_Mendele_  (in the form of posts) are tax-deductible...

Subject: Oy with an umlaut

I got a copy of Olsvanger's "Rosinkes mit Mandlen", first published in
Basel in 1920.  The foreword says the language is that of the Jews from
Litauen, the vowel is written 'e^j' and described as sounding like open
o-umlaut follewed by j (which would be y in English).

Subject: Brit-hadash[a]

It should be chadasa[h] of hadasha[a], as brit is feminine in Hebrew.
Usually the missionaries are careful about their Hebrew.

Mine is stamped "Yiddish Pentateuch/ Tentative Edition" and on the cover
"Sefer Torah N'vi'im u-chsuvim/ das izt/ die gantze heilige shrift fan
dem alten/ testament/ tray und richtig iberzetzt fan lashon hakoydesh
oyf yudish-deitsh/ fan/ mordechei shmuel bergman/ und zardefaltid
iberzehen/ fan/ r' aharon bernshtein/ gderukt in landan/ oyf kasten der
britishen und oyslendishen bibel geselshaft/ 1893.

The Yiddish is heavily Germanized, beginning, "im anfang had gat
geshafen di himel und di erde.  und di erde var vist und le'er und
finsternist var oyf dem abgrund und der daist gattes hat geshvebt oyf
dem vaser.  und gat hat gezagt es soll veren licht, und es ist geveren
licht. . ."

Subject: Widze

In 1937 in Warsaw a small book of Yiddish poetry was published.  _Velt In
Tsoim_ contained Baruch Gelman's poetry.  He was a native of Widze in
the Vilna area, and in fact, some of the poems tell of that shtetl. He
died at the hands of the Nazis when he was only 31 years old. Several
years ago we in Israel (Winunsky in Widze until 1930) photocopied the
book and republished it, for the purpose of remembering important
personages of our shtetl.
