Subject: N'sokhim

Just a word of appreciation to Eliyahu Juni for his explanation [5.110]
of N'sokhim -- but, beyond that, for his delightful pronuncia- tion of
the Yiddish words, the sound of which comes through beautifully, as
though by a recording!  I enjoy hearing the various dialects of English,
and I take even greater delight in listening to the varieties of Yiddish
pronunciation.

And isn't it interesting that all this comes about as a result of the
limitations imposed on us by our computers' inability to use the
Yiddish/Hebrew alphabet!

Subject: Yeshivish

Eliyahu Juni asks [5.11] what we call the "Yeshivishese spoken outside
yeshives". Would this be what we call Judaeo-English? How different is it
from what Yiddish originally was, as Judaeo-Middle-German? It's the local
language (English in this case) peppered with large influences from the
Jewish environment (which includes Yiddish in this case).

Subject: Shlok zol dir trefen

Apropos the coming Sukos holiday-a question was once posed what the curse
"a shlok zol dir trefen" means. A shlok is the temporary rain cover for
a suke. They used to be made of wood and hinged to permit easy openning
and closing (when closed, the suke is not "kosher"). Often they were not
well made and could fall into the suke.  Getting hit by one could fatal or
even worse!  Thus, the curse.

Subject: Teaching Yiddish to Children, etc.

1. There has been discussion here about teaching materials for children.
For my three young children, we bought Muzzy  in German. What is Muzzy?
The BBC has produced a series of language-learning videos and other
instructional materials.  When you order a set, you get two videos of
Muzzy in English, and two in the language you specify.  They have
English, Esperanto, French, Italian and Spanish versions.  Muzzy is a
cartoon character from outer space who crash-lands on Earth, and has a
series of adventures with a king, a queen, their daughter the princess,
her boyfriend, the royal gardener, and the royal advisor.  It's all good,
gentle fun, and it's a wonderful way to start people off in learning a
foreign language.  I'd love to see Muzzy in Yiddish!

2. My family and I had the pleasure of spending two days with the four
children of David and Simone Sherman, of Toronto. The kids speak Yiddish
among themselves, entirely naturally and unselfconsciously, having been
raised from birth to speak Yiddish at home with their parents and
maternal grandparents. To hear these kids speaking in Yiddish at the Fair
Lawn pool, where for years the youngest Yiddish- speakers have been in
the 70's and 80's was a treat to my ears and heart.  A gezunt af  zayere
kepelekh.    :-)

3.  As the holidays draw near, I want to express my best wishes to all
Mendelniks.  To those who have contributed so much to my enjoyment of
Mendele, a hearty "thank you."
