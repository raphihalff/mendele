Subject: preglen ayngemakhts

Following the thread of "prezhenitse" and Bob Rothstein's etymological
elucidations, can anyone explain exactly what the process known as "preglen
ayngemakhts" entails?

I've made jam many times, but there was no "preglen" (i. e. frying)
involved. Is this a misnomer?

Remember the lines from "Vashti's kloglid" in Manger's megile-lider:
"ikh hob gepreglt ayngemakhts un ongefilt di sloyes,
itst muz ikh farlozn mayne likhtike pakoyes".

Subject: Re: di yidishe shikse

I want to thank Bob Rothstein for the wonderful bio on Vera Rozanka, the
yidishe shikse. As a child I remember hearing her on WEVD, along with all
the other Sunday Yiddish programs; there was a Rabe Zaydman and another man
as regulars on the yidishe shikse program. It is indeed a thrill to harken
back nostalgically, when Yiddish was more than a subject of a sometime
academic exploration but a part of daily life and a major source of humor
and musical entertainment; when New Yorkers needed only to flick a switch
on the radio to be regaled in Yiddish.

Subject: EYDES - the electronic archive of Yidisher Sprakh- un Kultur-Atlas

The Yidisher Sprakh- un Kultur-Atlas in the Internet:

htt://www.eydes.de

The inauguration of the Internet version of the Yidisher Shprakh- un
Kultur-Atlas, Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry -initiated by
the late Uriel Weinreich and housed at Columbia University in New York
City- was celebrated with a two-days conference in Berlin, April 28-29,
2005.

The EYDES conference with the German title "Jiddisch und die Mitte Europas"
('Yiddish and Europe's center') was hosted by the Foerderverein fuer
Jiddische Sprache und Kultur e.V. Duesseldorf, in conjunction with the
Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia and the foundation Stiftung
Presse-Haus, Essen. It took place at the Berlin Representation of the
Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hiroshimastrasse 12-16,
Berlin-Tiergarten.

The conference started with a colloquium of international experts from
related disciplines (i.e. language technology, archive building, Yiddish
and Judaic studies, history, law, education, sociology, ethnology) who
illustrated the significance of the EYDES archive for their respective
field and discussed the components of the database in its present state and
projected future. Together with the EYDES initiators they developed ideas
to further knowledge about the archive, disseminate its contents in public
life and general culture, stimulate its use in academic fields, and create
routes for 'joint venture' projects.

The ensuing dinner with representatives of political and industrial
institutions made room for an exchange on how to join forces in allocating
funds and advancing continued work on the project.

The conference was concluded by a panel discussion with invited political
representatives and press. The speakers emphasized the political value of
rebuilding knowledge about essentials of Yiddish culture in present-day
Europe. EYDES plays an important role in this respect by providing
universal access to the Atlas collections and their wealth of information
on European Yiddish-speaking societies. Given the structure of the database
and its annotations with linkage to the original sound recordings EYDES
promises to enable new modes of research into Yiddish and to show "broad
and enduring impact across fields and across languages".

By Spring 2006 all interview recordings of the original Atlas archive are
expected to have been integrated in the EYDES database.

Subject: prezhnitse: a new meaning

Here is one more (perhaps odd) usage of the word: pronounced 'prezhnitse',
it meant in our family (yidish first language; parents from S.E. Poland
[Tyszowce; yidish - Tishevits] and W. Volhynia [Vladimir; yidish - Ludmir]
a large fried potato latke, one that filled the whole frying pan. Egg
dishes had different names (e.g. shpigl ey [sunny side up]), never
'prezhnitse'.

Subject: povetka/fovetka

This is a sentence from the Yiddish memoirs in the Ivanetz Yizkor Book that
I am translating.  Does anyone know what thus word means.

אױפֿן הױף בײַ אים אונטער דער פּאָװעטקע (אָדער פֿאָװעטקאַ) ליגט האָלץ.
oyfn hoyf bay im unter der povetka (fovetka?) ligt holts.
