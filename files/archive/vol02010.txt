I've always understood it to be exactly that, although a
conscious one.

I've always assumed it was invented by Leo Rosten for THE
JOYS OF YIDDISH, which of course isn't really about
Yiddish.

Subject: kibitzer

In my family the word "kibitzer" always meant joker, and a
kibitz was a joke or a tease. My parents were from Lodz.
Comments would be appreciated.

Sorry that my first contribution is a suggestion: Anyone
who's come accross a recent publication on Yiddish, a book
or a paper in a scientific journal, please share it with
the rest of us, giving the exact reference.

Subject: etymological butterflies

Since everyone else seems to be in an etymological frame of
mind, I thought I would consult my lowly Wahrig Woerterbuch
in a mad pursuit of the derivations of the schlimiehls,
schlimazels and kibitzers of this world.

According to Wahrig:

Schlemihl is derived from the Hebrew (and I use their
German transcription since I know no Hebrew) from
"she-lo-mo-il", which they render as "one who is unfit for
anything."

Shlimazel is not noted, but I must admit I like the folks
etymological explanation of schlimm mazel, since the
concept of fortuna could be positive or neutre in
connotation. Could this ambivalence have been extended to
Yiddish?

The modern German verb of kiebitzen, as our pinochle player
noted, derives from card-playing, and means "to look at
[someone] while playing cards." It derives from the
thieves' jargon, where the form was kiebitschen. But since
the jargon, Rotwelsch, has a lot of Hebrew derivatives in
it, who knows where the term originated . . .

The feathered friend, the Kiebitz, seems to be a northern
German species at home in the Watland. The derivation of
this word goes back to the MHG gibiz,giwiz, which was an
imitation of its warning cry. (Now everyone, flap your
wings and you'll see what I mean.) Somehow, this potential
explanation ruffles MY feathers. . .

Gleefully hoping I have contributed to the every denser
etymological bog, I wish my fellow mendelites a git yontof.

Catching up on some recent "Mendelekh":

Noyekh, I know of _beben_ ('to babble') and _bleketsn_ but
not _bebetsn_. We'll look it up in the sources.

Litvakes pronounce /yidish/ as [idish] and /yingl/ as
[ingl] and /yinger/ as [inger], etc., etc.  Hence the
common spelling of all these with alef-yud instead
yud-khirek yud.  The latter form is "new", i.e., was
introduced and adopted mostly by non-religious Yiddish
institutions since the twenties.  Would like to know who
was the first and when.  Maybe in the teens, gor?...
Before that, the non-Litvakes (i.e. speakers of Southern
Yiddish) spelled the words yud-vov-daled, yud-vov-nun-etc.
for _yingl_, etc. assumably because of a) the etymology
[cf. German Jude, Junge - sorry, I don't know the older
German forms] and b) the yud for them is [i] anyhow! E.g.,
orthographic _kumen_ is [kimen]. As far as I know and have
been taught, there is no actual "division of labor" between
the _shlemiel_ and the _shlimazl_ (who spills the soup and
upon whom it is spilt).  What there is is a division of
Yiddishes:  Eastern Yiddish, i.e. the dialects of Eastern
Europe, have the word _shlimazl- and _shlimeza'lnik_
(Noyekh apparently speaks "tote-mome-lushn" [1], so he is
right in having heard [shlimezo'lnik]);  _shlemiel_ is the
word used by the speakers of Western Yiddish, i.e., the
dialect and subdialects in which Yiddish was spoken
coterritorially with German (e.g., Germany, Switzerland,
etc.).  As the Western and the Eastern Jews met up in the
New Country, Ameritshke, both forms met up as well.
([shli'mazl], with the accent on the first syllable, is
'bad luck' in Southern Yiddish.  Information thanks to Dr.
Mordkhe Schaechter.  There's a subchapter on this whole
issue in his _Yiddish Two:  An Intermediate YIddish
Textbook_, Phila., 1986.)

Brantwin (circumflex over the i) ['burnt wine', cf. Eng.
brandywine --> Eng. brandy], in one of the older forms of
German, is the source of modern Yiddish _branfn_ or
_bronfn_.  Notice the [a~o] variation, which is the same as
that in tsvantsik~tsvontsik.  We'll probably find out in
Max Weinreich's _History of the Yiddish Language_.  (I have
reading for tonight!)

Marganit Weinberger-Rotman, is your leyenkrayz at the
University of Illinois? Is Yiddish taught there?

zayts mir ale gezunt un shtark!

Dovid Braun

[1] "Tote-mome-lushn" - dialect of Podolia, Bessarabia and
environs where Standard Yiddish [a] is pronounced [o], for
instance; tate [tote], mame [mome], mazl [mozl], shabes
[shobes].
