Subject: Universities and Yiddish.

	The University of Toronto offers 3 Yiddish courses,
Beginner, intermediate and a literature course.

	McGill in Montreal offers several undergrad courses and may
offer graduate programmes. I think Yiddish there is still more
elaborate than UofT.

	Of course Oxford has Yiddish, in fact there is a young woman
who received a Rhodes Scholarship who will be studying Yiddish
Literature there.

Subject: Grade and Singer

To Mark Flumerfelt and others: I rarely engage in Mendele's
linguistic and related makhloykes since I am no linguist. I do enjoy
the contributions of Ellen Prince, Zachary Baker,Mikhl Herzog and
other lamdim. Ikh shep nakhes oykh fun di ale  yunge mentshn vos
bamien zikh mit lernen zikh Yiddish aleyn un mit lerers. I teach
Yiddish and have used Weinreich quite contentedly and Zuckerman for
beginners, Schaechter's new edition for advanced and look forward to
Sheva's forthcoming book. "Ober dos bin ikh nit oysn."

Through the years I have heard people compare Grade and Singer,
usually to the denigration of Singer. Perhaps it began with Cynthia
Ozick's brilliant but too thinly disguised "Envy, or Yiddish in
America" which long predates the Nobel Prize for Bashevis. Some of
those critics of Bashevis who prefer Grade are Yiddish readers who
are offended by Bashevis' emphasis on sex. Those who have never read
Bashevis' extraordinary prose in the original are sciolists whose
opinions can be discounted. No English version can convey the dense
texture and the remarkable aural effect of i.e. the monologue "Di
Nodl" which can be found in Chava Turniansky's college anthology of
Y.lit. Grade was a gifted poet and more of an ideological writer of
fiction than Bashevis. In my opinion his most outstanding work is
Mayn krig mit Hersh Rasseyner which is longer and even more
compelling in the original. If you remember it is a dialogue not
dramatic although the ideological issues are,of course, horrendous.
Bashevis was an outstanding writer of short stories-- a wonderful
story teller. His most successful novel was his earliest,1935,
"Satan in Goray" ably translated by Jacob Sloan into English. I
cannot believe that the awarding of the Nobel prize to Bashevis was
any more "political" than  usual. Was Grade under consideration? How
do we know?The awarding of the prize was great for Yiddish. He
deserved it and so does Yiddish. If Grade had been as well known as
Singer, he might have gotten it. See Ozick's story.

There is an anecdote about Bialik who was asked by his Jerusalem
grocer, "Nu Bialik, how come you didn't get the Nobel Prize?" Bialik
replied "And if I had won it you would have said 'How come Bialik got
the Nobel Prize?' "

Subject: Yiddish programs in Israel

re doyre halperin biasca's inquiry about yiddish programs at israeli
universities: avrom novershtern teaches yiddish at hebrew university
[jerusalem] and also has been teaching in the yivo summer program at
columbia university. i don't know if he'll be doing that again this
summer. i also do not know the exact name of his department at hu.
perhaps someone at yivo can provide more information.

i also think there is some sort of yiddish program at bar ilan
university in ramat gan. i'm sorry i can't give you any names to
contact. i'm sure avrom can tell you about everything going on in
that vein in israel.

if you like, i can contact folks in israel who can provide more
information. let me know.
