Subject: Introduction

Hello, my new friends.-- I've been looking at Mendele for the past week
now so I thought I should introduce myself, too.

I am a descendant of the Yidishe Gauchos of Northern Argentina and last
week there was a note from Mark Freeman about a film that he made of that
community in 1989, wondering whether anyone had any information about it.
So that's me--I'd love to hear from others with roots in Moisesville or
Mauricio or other places in Santa Fe or Entrerios Provinces--we might be
related!

I was born in Buenos Aires and came to the US in 1953, when I was seven.
It was a little odd for my friends in the Bronx to realize that not
everyone who spoke Spanish came from Puerto Rico!  When I was a teenager
I moved to San Diego, so my Mexican friends were also surprised to see
Jewish people speaking Spanish.  Go figure.

I eventually got an MA and most of the way toward a PhD in linguistics
with a keen interest in Ladino, but I can read and handle a fair amount
of Yiddish as well.  Well, not to brag, but I do Japanese as
well--product of two years at American Embassy Tokyo where I was
assistant cultural attache.  Later diplomatic assignments took me to Peru
and Mexico.

Last year I left the foreign service and came back to the US.  I teach
Spanish and do translations.

I still keep up with relatives in Argentina, but unfortunately none of
them live in Moisesville anymore.

By the way, I rushed right out and bought a copy of Mark Freeman's film!
Good advertising, Mark!

A sheynen dank,

Hugo Kottler

Subject: Shaltanosiai

I actually found my Lithuanian recipe book in a book box in my garage!
The book is Zhemaichiu valgiai 'Zhemaitian dishes'.  [Mendelnicks should
know that in correct Lith orthography every C+h is actually a Cons letter
with a hachek over it--there are other diacritic details we must omit, as
well.]  It was published [my 2nd edition] in Vilnius 1977, and is in
standard Lithuanian, NOT Zhemaitian dialect.  On p. 54 there is a recipe
for "shaltanosiai su slyvomis"  'cold-noses with plums'.  The ingredients
include one l. flour, one egg, o.5 kg plums, 1 T. sugar, 0.5 l. sour
cream or cream, + salt.  Sorry I don't have time to translate and send
the whole recipe; I'll fax the original to anyone who wants it.  This
explains why the word was absent from the standard 1 vol. Lith
dictionary--It is con- sidered "zhemaitian" dialect!

Subject: Mushrooms an manes

Moyshe Taube: I assumed that the Yiddish situation reflected the one in
Polish, so you will have to tell me what it means. Of the top of MY mane,
I think the following holds for Yiddish:

'horse's mane'--gzhive and its expected variant gribe
'mushrooms'--only gzhibes

Subject: Cat's cradle

Dan Leeson asks whether he understood correctly his aunt's Yiddish term
for the finger-string game "cat's cradle".  He did indeed:  like his
aunt, my aunt also called it "etl-betl".  So do U. Weinreich, and Mordkhe
Schaechter in his recent dictionary of "Pregnancy, Childbirth and Early
Childhood".  I suppose that the similarity in meaning of "betl" and
"cradle" is more than a coincidence.  Neither Weinreich nor Schaechter
translates "jacks" (the game).

Subject: etl betl

dan leeson reminds us of the string game, etl betl. i realize that we
anglicized this to ethel bethel. didn't know the term 'cat's cradle' till
i grew up. what, if anything, does _etl betl_ mean? is _betl_ related to
_cradle_? (i had an aunt ethel, called /etl/ by the yiddish speakers in
the family, and i always associated the game with her name, tho i
astutely figured out it wasn't really about *her*. :) )

It's Etl Betl, all right, and various figures include "a betl" and
"a shpigl".
