Subject: Yiddish-Vietnamese Connection

Was that song perhaps Nellie Casman's "Yosl?"  My wife remembers
hearing a radio commentary (NPR?) a couple of years ago about a
popular Chinese singer who was touring the West.  Her repertoire
included a Chinese version of "Yosl," which was apparently also
popular in Japanese karaoke bars.

Subject: Shakspeare farbesert

I am trying to get information on a line supposed to have appeared
either on a theater program or on the title page of a Yiddish
version of a Shakspeare play. The line is something like
"Sheykspir's Otelo, ibergezetst, fartaytsht un farbesert ..."  I
can't find it either in David Lifson's "The Yiddish Theater in
America" or Nahma Sandrow's "Vagabond Stars", but I have seen it
somewhere.  Can someone help me?  And is there any difference in
meaning or nuance between "ibergezetst" and "fartaytsht"?  Is
"ibergezetst" daytshmerish [taytshmerish!]?  A sheynem dank.

Subject: Jewish languages

In response to: L Leavitt's query regarding non-Yiddish Jewish
languages...

I'm sure he will find references to Ladino (Judeo-Espagnol is a bit
more of an appropriate term I am told) but what about Crimchak--the
language of the mountain Jews of the Crimea.  I don't have a
reference, but I have a friend who once worked on the compiling of a
Turkish-Crimchak dictionary (alas-never published the work) and
traveled around collecting tapes of Crimchak folk songs and melodies
for the holidays, etc.  He is not on the internet but if you are
interested in more info on this language, contact me directly via
email and I'll put you in touch with him.  He may well be able to
provide additional information on other obscure Jewish tongues as
well (though I would guess that Crimchak may be as obscure as one
can get already).

Subject: I. B. Singer Papers to Texas

	It seems these days that almost anything one sends to
MENDELE ends up in the wildest controversy, and I shouldn't imagine
it will be any different with this.  But here goes.

	I am very happy to announce to the readership of MENDELE
that the University of Texas at Austin has acquired the literary
archive of Isaac Bashevis Singer.  I quote from the official
announcement:

The University of Texas at Austin has received the papers of Nobel
prize-winning author, Isaac Bashevis Singer.  The material is a gift
of Mrs. Alma Singer, the author's widow, and group of individual
Texas donors.  The archive contains manuscripts of all of Singer's
published works as well as several unpublished and untranslated
manuscripts of Singer's fiction and manuscripts of some unpublished
plays. Correspondence, photographs, clippings, notes and other
materials are also included in the archive.

	The material is not catalogued, and it is clear from my
inspection of the papers that it is going to take some time indeed
to catalogue the contents of the archive.
