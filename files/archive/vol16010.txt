The poem sought by Jack Mazow (vol 16.008) is, indeed, by Avrom Reyzin. The
melodies he remembers his parents singing are doubtless from the oratorio
based on the poem, composed by Yankif Sheyfer (Jacob Schaeffer), conductor
of the Frayhayt Gezangs Fareyn choruses in various cities, (600 voices in
New York in 1926!) now known as the Jewish People's Philharmonic Chorus.

Unfortunately, I have only three of the eight volumes of Reyzin's collected
works, so the text of the poem is not at hand. Perhaps Chane Mlotek can
provide it; perhaps Binyomin Schaechter, current conductor of the Chorus,
can provide both text and music, probably published (1952, Yidisher Muzik
Farband, Jewish Music Alliance) in "ikh her a kol."

Reyzin's admiration for Sheyfer's music was expressed in a poem written in
1928 -- perhaps an indication of when the oratorio was first composed and
performed. Reyzin wrote (in my hasty, non-rhymed translation):

For All
(A gift to Y. Sheyfer and the Frayhayt Gezangs Fareyn)

It will not disappear,
nor will it be shamed:
the hope that inspires
and consoles us in pain;
The song will go on,
the song will be heard,
from the new land
of shining wonder.

For all who await,
while hidden and buried;
for the tired, who are buoyed
by the messenger's tread;
for all let there glow
the brighter tomorrow;
for all let be heard,
in chorus, our song.

And, on Sheyfer's untimely death in 1936 (he was only 48), Reyzin's
condolence message read, in part, "Sheyfer was the loveliest expression of
the revolutionary, creative forces that lie within the depths of the Jewish
working and folk-masses. His brief life became a great, glorious work."

(Translations from texts in the tribute anthology, "Yankif Sheyfer,"
published [1962] on his 25th yortsayt by the Jewish Music Alliance.)

In answer to Jack Mazow: The words of Avrom Reyzen's "Kirkhnglokn" as I
have heard them:

Oy, vos (Varum) klingt ir, kirkhnglokn / Hert shoyn oyf - genug geshrokn /
hobn ayere vilde tener undzer oreme velt / Ir dermant undz in yene rukhes,
/ di katoylishe melukhes, / velkhe hobn hoykhe shafots shoyn oyfgeshtelt /
tsu derhargenen yedn denker un tsu shlepn far dem henker, / jenems kop arop
tsu hakn, velkher boygt zikh nisht / Oy, ir vilt di velt farvign mit a
shvern toytn-nign! / Oy, ir vilt di velt farvign mit a shvern toytn-nign /
un badekn mit a mantl fun a yesuit // Kh' hob a nayem glok bashafn - tsu
dervekn toyte shklafn / Nisht in kirkhn - in der luftn - heng ikh im aroys
/ Nisht tsum shrekn, nor tsum vekn di gantse velt fun ale ekn / zingt er
freylekh, ruft er munter - shtey(t) tsu lebn oyf! / Nisht tsum shrekn, nor
tsum vekn di gantse velt fun ale ekn / zingt er freylekh, ruft er munter -
shtey(t) tsu lebn oyf!

There is a LP recording of this song by Hai & Topsy Frankl (Sweden), issued
again in their CD collection "Sp„tlese" (2000, Thorofon Records; Yiddish
songs on one of the four disks) and you can also hear it on a cassette by
Dora Libson called "Dora Libson Field Recording."

Here's what I found in this book "Shriften fun Avrom Reyzen," Band 1:
Gezamelte Lieder. Ferlag ,Progres", Varshe; Druk fun Yoysef Fisher, Kroke
1908, zaytl 53.

I tried to transcribe exactly what's written there. I did not standardize
anything - for example  left ,arob" instead of writing "arop," "ferviegen"
instead of "farvign," "muthig" and not "mutik," "frehlikh" instead of
"freylekh," "shteht" and not "shteyt."

Your beginning is slightly different. Maybe you will remember more as you
read this. It would be interesting to know!


Di kirkhen-gloken

Akh, vos klingt ihr kirkhen-gloken!
Hert shoyn oyf ! Genug geshroken
Hoben ay're vilde tener
Undzer or'me velt!

Ihr dermont mir yene rukhes,
Di katoylishe melukhes,
Velkhe hoben eshafoten
Hoykhe oyfgeshtelt;

Ay're tener rufen henker
Tsu mertiren yeden denker,
Venem kop arob tsu haken
Velkher beygt zikh nit;

O, ihr vilt di velt ferviegen
Mit a shvartsen, toyten nigun
Un ferdeken mit a mantel
Fun a yezuit!

---

Kh'hob a nayem glok beshafen,
Tsu ervakhen toyte shklafen -
Nit in kirkhen, - in der luften
Heng ikh im aroyf;

Nit tsu shreken, nor tsu veken
Nor di velt in ale eken,
Klingt er muthig, ruft er frehlikh:
Shteht tsu leben oyf!

Thanks,

The song is included in Bine Shteynberg(ed.)"Undzer Gezang." Farlag Y L
Peretz, Tel Aviv, 1984; Reyzen is given as the author.

Akh, vos klingt ir kirkhn-glokn
Hert shoyn oyf genug geshrokn
Hobn ayere vilde tener
Undzer oreme velt

Ayere tener, dukht zikh, rufn
Tsu farbrengn menshn-gufn
Oyf di hoykhe eshafotn
Vos ir hot geshtelt

Ayere tener rufn henker
Tsu martirn yedn denker
Yenem kop aroptsuhakn
Velkher beygt zikh nit

O, ir vilt di velt farvign
Mit a shvartsn, toytn nign
Un fardekn mit a mantl
Fun a yezuit

Kh'hob a nayem glok bashafn
Tsu dervakhn mide shklafn
Nit in kirkhn, in di luftn
Heng ikh im aroyf

Nit tsu shrekn, nor tsu vekn
Gor di velt in ale ekn
Klingt er mutik, ruft er freylekh
Shteyt tsu lebn oyf!

I sang it a few years ago at a Jewish Socialists' Group Chanukah social (it
must have been a year in which Christmas coincided with Chanukah!) and
Esther Brunstein and the late Majer Bogdanski gave me an alternative second
verse reflecting the song as sung in pre-war Lodz:

Ir demont undz yene rukhes
Di katoylishe melukhes
Velkhe hobn eshfafotn
Hoykhe oyfgeshtelt

Karsten Troyke includes the song on his CD Shuloym-Alaykhem. The words
given are (using the Troyke's own transliteration which reflects the Polish
Yiddish accent in which he sings)

Akh vus klingt ir Kirkhn-Glokn! Hert shoyn of! Genug geshrokn
Hobn ayere wilde Tener indzer oreme Velt

Ir dermont mir yene Rukhes di katoylishe Melukhes
velekhe hobn di Shafotn hoikhe ofgeshtelt

Ayere tener rifn Henker tsi martyren yedm Denker
Yenem Kop aruptsihakn - velekher boygt zekh nit

O ir villt di Velt farvign mit a shvartsn  toytn Nign
Fin di hoyke Kraits un Tirmer vus ir hot geshtellt

Ayere glokn dakht zekh rifen tsi farbrennen
Mentshn-Gifn un fardekn mit a Mantel fin a Yezuit.

Ikh hob a nayem Glok bashfn tsi dervekn toite shklafn
Nit tsi shrekn nor tsi vekn, heng ikh im aroif

Nit tsi shrekn nor tsi vekn gur di Velt in alle Ekn
klingt er mutig, rift er fraylekh ! Shtayt tsim Leben oif!

Subject:  Isaac Rabinowitz

I'm reading and very much enjoying Arthur Hertzberg's "The Jews in
America." On page 153 of the paperback edition there is a short reference
to Isaac Rabinowitz, a Hebrew poet who came to the US in 1893 and then had
to write pot boilers for a living. The Jewish Encyclopedia has what may be
the same person coming to NY in 1891. In any case, I'm reasonably certain
that the pot boilers for popular consumption were written in Yiddish, not
Hebrew, but haven't been able to track it down so far. Can anyone help me?

Subject: Di Mayse mit di "Sheyne Mari"

I'm trying to track down a date concerning Sholem Asch's short story "Di
mayse mit di 'Sheyne Mari." Does anyone know when this story was FIRST
published? I have a copy of it in Yiddish in a collection of Asch's work
entitled "Yugend," printed in New York in 1911.  Joachim Neugroschel
recently did a translation of the story in his collection "No Star Too
Beautiful," but he lists the date of the story as 1921.  Anyone know which
is right or if there's an even an earlier date from perhaps publication of
the story in a Yiddish newspaper or magazine?

Thanks,
Warren Hoffman

Several perfectly plausible explanations have been offered in this edition
for the roshei teyvot g"f. Which is correct?

Subject: Polish original sought

SOURCE http://www.translatorscafe.com/tcterms/RU/thQuestion.aspx?id=572

I am translating a description of the interior of a synagogue in Poland
from Yiddish to English. The description is itself a translation from
Polish. The word occurs in the following sentence: "Di balasn zenen fun
getinkte tsigl." ("The 'balasn' are made of plastered bricks.") It
immediately follows a description of the stairways leading to the cantor's
platform, the railings or balustrades of which have the shape of Gothic
arches. I haven't been able to find the Polish original. It is "Opis
synagogi w Nowym Saczu: Sprawozdania Komisyi dla badania historyi sztuki w
Polsce, Tom IV, str. LXXXI."

Subject:  Yehoyesh-shpil

While I share Dina Levias' disappointment with the shpil as described, it
could be put to better use if more thought were put into phrasing the
questions. Let me give one example:

The question about the relative number of times "milkhome" and "sholem"
appear in the Khumesh continues with the comment that "the student can see
where Yehoyesh has used the synonym krig 'war, battle' as few as 6 times in
the entire Khumesh."  If the student were asked explicitly why Yehoyesh
uses krig where he does, he/she would soon find out that it is never used
as a synonym of milkhome.  It is Yehoyesh's translation of the Hebrew "riv"
or "merivah," which mean "dispute, argument," or - at most - a fight
between individuals, but not "war, battle."

The Hebrew "milhama" (war, battle) is always translated milkhome and
spelled as in Hebrew, with one notable exception. The term "ish milhama"
(man of war - Exodus 15:8) is translated krigsman. Yehoyesh evidently
considered "milkhomeman" to be too cumbersome an expression for inclusion
in the poetic Song of Moses.  Having used krig "war" this once, he felt
free to translate the plural "anshei hamilhama"(men of war) as krigslayt in
the prosaic context of Deuteronomy 2:14,16.

Incidentally, while pursuing the answer to the question posed above, the
student will learn a good bit of Yiddish and the art of translation from
discerning the different meanings of the verb krign in its various forms
(krign, krigt, gekrigt, etc.) as used by Yehoyesh in different contexts, as
well as from the encounter with compound derived nouns like krigeray.
