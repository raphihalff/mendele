Subject: Mein Kind, musst beten

Arre Komar recently mentioned an interesting song which has found its way
into Yiddish/Jewish musical repertoire.

I'd like to cite a source for this, but it's gone. Years ago, I read that
it was written by a German gentile about World War I, and the pain of
seeing one's husband and father of one's child go off to war. My
understanding is that, again, it was written by a non-Jew, and the reason
given was that the author didn't know that Jews don't pray on their
knees. But it was aimed at a Jewish audience, in a mix of German and
Yiddish.

"Knie mit mir nieder, denn er kommt nie mehr wieder, Doch gross ist unser
Adoshem"

Martha Schlamme sang a beautiful rendition that I heard almost 25 years
ago, but vividly remembered. Leo Fuld did a nice rendition, too, on a
cassette I have.  More on Fraynd Fuld a bisl shpeter.

Subject: Greek, Hebrew, and -- Targemloshn

This is a brief communication about three expressions, each invoking the
name of a language.  For expository reasons I'll start with the last part
first, and then tie all three together.

After the return from the Babylonian exile, Hebrew had ceased to be the
common spoken language of the Jewish people.  Instead, Aramaic became the
language of the home and street, and the religious leaders resorted to it
to make the Bible more accessible to the people.

The translation of the holy Hebrew text into the Aramaic vernacular was
called _Targum_, literally translation.

"Targem,"  as it is pronounced in Yiddish, means only one thing:  the
translation of the Bible into Aramaic.  No definite article is used or
necessary.  Several years after entering kheyder a boy soon learns what
Targem means.

In time the Targum translation entered the canon of religious readings of
the Jewish people, and enjoyed a sanctity of its own.  The Talmud then
enjoined the reading of the weekly Toyre passage ("parshe") twice in
Hebrew and once in Targum.

Much of the Talmud was written in Aramaic, and many prayers were composed
in this language.

To this day the traditional _kadish_, and the _kol nidre_ prayer with
which the Yom Kiper services start, are recited in their original
Aramaic.

1.  Whe you are told, or read, something overly complex and obtuse, and
you decide, without any further deliberation and without giving it a
second thought, that it is not worth your while to even try to understand
it or to pursue it, you flatly dismiss it by saying "That's _Greek_ to
me."

2.  Many years ago when I was in Paris I met a former Hebrew teacher of
mine, a beloved mentor in my adolescence, who instilled in me a deep love
and respect for languages.

He was then studying in the Linguistics Department of the Sorbonne,
specializing in Semitic languages.

One evening, a young lady student in his class sat next to him, and when
she casually took a glance at his notes, she exclaimed in French "That's
_Hebrew_ to me.,"  meaning that she could not make out a thing of his
scribbles.

I regret not knowing French to quote her exclamatory phrase verbatim, but
it has about the same meaning as the English "That's Greek to me."

Well, the interesting part is that in this instance she was correct,
because he was taking his notes in Hebrew...

3.  In Yiddish, when what you are told, or read something, that is
unintelligible and just plain gibberish, and you wish to express your
immediate disregard and total dismissal, you say "Bay (ba) mir iz es
_targemloshn_."

"Loshn," of course, means language, tongue, as in "mame- loshn."
Targemloshn is thus a clear reference to Aramaic.  However, you don't say
"Bay (ba) mir iz es Aramish" [Aramaic], because this would be a neutral
statement, not unlike mentioning any other language that you don't know
or understand.  But when you say  "Bay (ba) mir iz es targemloshn,"  it
has a particular tart bite to it.

Don't ask me why.

I would like to state that in my very Orthodox family we had "borkhes"
also on  Friday Eve  when the  meal was  always fleshig.   My maternal
grandmother who was born in what  was then the German city of Breslau,
was fond  of a  sweetish version  of shabbes bread,  but it  was never
milkhig.  Perhaps Arre Komer could find out from his Rhineland friends
what they called the khala eaten with meat.  Just curious.
