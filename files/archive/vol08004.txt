Subject: Yakhne

I have read someplace that "Yente" is the Yiddish equivalent of the very
complimentary name, Gentilla (or Spanish and Italian derivatives thereof).
Yachtsn is properly yachsn (yod het samekh nun) and is Hebrew for a person of
pedigree (yichus). It seems unlikely that this is connected with Yakhne.

Subject: Yakhne

I had always though the etymology of "yakhne" was an accentuated imitation of
how a person (woman) from a particular region pronounced "ikh" -- i.e.,
"iiiyekh", drawn out more and more, eventually becomes "yakh". And indeed,
that are people who use "yakh" for the first person pronoun. Perhaps Mikhl
Herzog can clarify which region(s) this applies to, and whether there's any
connection to the word "yakhne".

Subject: Yiddish periodicals

While on the subject of Yiddish periodicals (recent posting), the Jewish
Tribune  - a weekly published in London - has a page or two in Yiddish (of
sorts) in each issue.

The Yiddish section is known popularly as the 'sports page'. [English
newspapers tend to publish sports news on the final pages.]

Subject: vilde chaya

In response to the query of Dr. Roy Greenberg vegn Vilde Chaya... it is
amusing that my 97 year old mother remembers to this day how much she hated
being called Vilde chaya and taunted by the kids!.. She was headstrong( still
is) and bedcame a teacher for 45 years before retiring..  her name was Chaya
oif Yiddish.. so everyone teased her apparently by chanting vilde chaye to
her.. since she was not an obedient shtetl child..  As a matter of fact, of
all the sisters in the family, only my mom ever went to college...defying
paternal orders to go out and earn a living primarily right after high school.

Subject: vilde chaya

I haven't heard that in almost fifty years! I have been called a few things
by my own family, but nothing ever much worse than a paskutsve, nudnik or, on
occaision a mazik.  But when I was eighteen, I went to Israel for a year---it
was 1949-50. 

Some of my relatives were so taken aback by my non-conforming, and in their
view, wild and adventursome behaviour, I earned the nickname of "vilde chaya". 

Since I am female, I assumed it was a term of derision equally applicable to
males and females.  Of course, I could be wrong about that, and I guess other
Mendelayners will tell us how gender specific it is. 

In any case, I would like to continue believing that there was an element of
affection in the appellation.

Subject: vilde khaya

Harvey Roy Greenberg asks about the epithet "vilde khaya."  As I recall, there
is a set of gradations of such epithets, reserved only for boys, to wit:
"Bandeet," is a much milder form -- which I believe our shamis emeritis told
me he was was once dubbed.  A Bandeet was a bit of a "bad boy," but one that
everyone liked because although he broke the rules and tended to shock people
a bit, he was charming about it, often got things done, and did not hurt a
soul.  "Shcutz," or "Shkutz," take your pick, is a more severe form -- a boy
who is veering towards apostasy, hanging out with gentile street urchins, and
is suspected of beginning to engage in unclean dietary practices, at the very
least.  This approbation implies worry and at least potential contempt; it has
no kindness or pleasure associated with it.  I have not met any Jewish men
under the age of 40, other than scholars, who know these terms.

Subject: vilde chaya

Hello Mendele readers,

This is in reply to Harvey Greenberg's comments about the phrase, vilde chaya. 
I too was sometimes called this especially when I was running around and
screaming while playing with friends.  As a young child it generally meant
that one was somewhat lacking in manners, but as an older teenager it could
take on some more serious offenses, especially of sexual nature.  I am female,
so I can say that I too got this name when I was young and somewhat
undisciplined.  I grew up in Brooklyn, NY and am of the baby boom generatgion. 
My parents had come from Poland and Russia.

Subject: Yom Yerushalayim

I think it is fitting that all Medeleyeners be aware of the upcoming
celebration/holiday known as Yom Yerushalayim (Jerusalem Day) on Sunday, May
24, the 28th day of the Hebrew month of Iyar.  It celebrates the thirty-second
anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem, one of the major
accomplishments of the six-day war. 

This festive occasion is highlighted among the orthodox by special tefillos
and, in general, by lively parties which, in Jerusalem proper, include siyurim
(local tours) within the old city.  The Chief Rabbinate of Israel has, as with
Yom Ha'aztmaut, accorded Yom Yerushalayim a Yontiff designation that permits
musical celebrations, even though the holiday falls within the proscribed
"sphirat Ha'omer " period that otherwise, except for Lag B'Omer and Rosh
Khodesh, prohibits muscial programming.
