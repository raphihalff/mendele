1. To Perets Mett> Thanks for the @vov/khale@. It`s a new one on me.
As for @koyletsh@> Sometimes, it`s simply offered as the local
designation for @the Sabbath bread@. Sometimes, it`s specifically
modified, as in @Purim/koyletsh@. I suspect it`s always round, but
you never know.

As for the @Sabbath bread@ in Western Yiddish, you`re quite right>
if the word @khale@ was used, it usually referred to the @vaybershe
mitsve@ of @nemen khale@. It did not refer to the loaf. In fact,
some American Jews of German origin consider @holly (sic!) bread@ to
be an English word.

The word in Western Yiddish is generally @berkhes@ or @barkhes@ and,
in a small western Western Yiddish area, it is @d&ta>tsher@@ with an
indeterminate initial consonant, probably favoring the lenis @d@.
These  words,  are  of  interesting  etymology,  but  that`s  @a
bazundere mayse@ (or, as  you  would  surely  say  @a  bazindere
ma>nse@).

2. To Shleyme Axelrod et al> German words of Hebrew origin,
especially words that are derivable from the Hebrew component of
Yiddish, need not have entered German directly from Yiddish. The
transmission  was  often  mediated  by  Rotwelsch  `thieves` cant`
which, in the German language environment, drew heavily on this
source for cryptic purposes. (@Welsch@, cf. also @Wales@, @walnut@,
etc. is cognate with @Gaul@//also  a  separate  story).  It may be
quite difficult, in many cases, to sort out just which of the
possible channels of transmission a particular word followed. It`s
an interesting problem in Jewish sociolinguistics.

In this regard, one of the most important pre/20th century studies
of Yiddish is by the former police chief of Lubeck (I think), Ave/
Lallement. He devotes one and a half volumes of a four volume work
to Yiddish. The 4/volume work  is  entitled  @Das  deutsche
Gaunertum@  (a  non/German  word  meaning  `underworld`  and,
itself, probably of Jewish origin).

If you`re interested in pursuing the  question  of  Rotwelsch,  I`d
suggest you start with Paul Wexler`s !!! book @Three Heirs to a
Judeo/Latin Legacy> Judeo/Ibero/Romance, Yiddish and Rotwelsch@,
Harrasowitz, 1988.

Subject: Hershele Ostropolyer

I'm ready to leave the literary discussion about Hershele to
abler hands.  But as to Bob Hoberman's question (was he a real person?)
hob ikh shoyn a shtikl khazoke.  Yes, he was a real person.  My
grandmother, who was born in or near Tulchin in or about 1860, told
me that he had died before she was born but that she grew up with
stories about him, many of which she taught me.

Hershele was among other things court-jester to the Baal Shem Tov's
grandson, variously known as Rebbe Barukh of Medzibozh and Reb Borukhl
Tulchiner.  As rebbes go, Reb Borukhl didn't amount to much; that at
least was the opinion of his nephew, Nachman Bratslaver who
criticised not only his lack of intellectual or spiritual stature
but his style of life.  In brief, Reb Borukhl felt that a grandson
of the Besht would be letting down the side if he failed to live
like a nobleman.  Though he died some 50 years before my bubbe was
born, she used to describe as though she'd seen them with her eyes
his magnificent coach drawn by 4 (or 6?) white horses.

There are at least 2 collections of Hershele stories.  If one of our
librarian colleagues doesn't beat me to it, I'll report them ASATBGU
(as soon as the books get unpacked).

Subject: Matza-vasser

Although I have never heard this term used as an idiom, I can guess
that the expression has to do with the rules of baking matzo.  That
is, that the flour and water must be mixed rapidly and continuously
(one must not stop working the dough until it is in the oven) so as
not to allow leavening to occur and that any remaining water in the
bowl must be poured out on the ground in such a way as to permit
immediate absorption.  Therefore I would assume that matzo-vasser
would refer to something that one cannot hold on to at all, or that
slips through one's fingers (like time does for internet devotees!)
