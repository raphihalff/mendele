Subject: Mountain Jews

In addition, in case anyone on this list will be going to Israel, in
addition, Imight add that I saw a fine small exhibition at the Haifa
Municipal Museum las t September 1992 about the Mountain Jews:
clothing, photos, objects, ritual and omestic, books, the usual
spectrum of anthro/sociological display.  It's worth an hour or so
of anyone's time in Haifa, and knowing Israel, it is likely the
exhibition is still up, the Museum being not as well setup as those
in Jerusalem.

Subject: Nokh [amol] "epes"

>From "Deutsches Woerterbuch," by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, vol. 3
(Leipzig:  S. Hirzel, 1862; reprint ed., Muenchen:  Deutscher
Taschenbuch Verlag, 1984), col. 679:

EPPER, EPPES, aliquis, aliquid fuer etwer, etwas, eppa fuer etwa,
doch nur im schweizerischen, allemannischen, oestreichischen,
bairischen, wetterauischen volksdialect, auch geschrieben oepper,
oeppes, oeppa, bei HEBEL oebber, oebbis, oebbe....  bekannt ist das
schweizerische:  hedder oeppe oepper oeppis gseid? [=] hat dir etwa
jemand etwas gesagt?  epper und eppe bedeuten auch irgend, eppe hin,
[=] irgend wo hin.  beim schlesischen WENZEL SCHERFER begegnet
gleichfalls:  der herr will epper mir vergeben...

N.b.  For lack of umlauts, an "e" has been interpolated here in the
appropriate places.  I will refrain from translating the passage,
since mein Deutsch ist eppa schwach, but will note that the dialects
identified where "epper," "eppes," etc. are used comprise the the
following:  Swiss, Alemannic, Austrian, Bavarian, Wetterau (help me
with this one, ye Germanisten:  could this be the same as one of two
places identified in the Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer as Wetter,
(a) 6 miles NNW of Marburg (Hesse-Nassau), or (b) 3 miles NW of
Hagen (Westphalia)?).  All of these dialect regions are either
western or southern.  "Eppes" does not appear to have been used in
regions of former East Germany where Sorbian is (or was) spoken,
however...

Regarding Perets Mett's comments, in reponse to Reyzl's mention of
the "recidivist challenge to Yivo orthography":  Please do not
confuse transcription/transliteration with spelling systems used in
Yiddish proper.  I doubt that even Dovid Katz would be in favor of
introducing "ch" for "khes" and "khof" and while his "Klal- takones"
do not distinguish between "tsvey yudn" ("ey" in YIVO transcription)
and "pasekh tsvey yudn" ("ay"), I am sure that his students are
taught the difference in terms of pronunciation and (I would hope)
transcription.  It is the lack of the distinction between the "tsvey
yudn" and the "pasekh tsvey yudn" to which Reyzl objects (and I
naturally agree with her on that), not the confusion that many
Yiddish students have regarding the romanization of those two
digraphs.

Subject: More on epes and German Dialects

Since people seem to be on the topic of epes/ebbes/aebbes in German
dialects, i thought i'd pipe up to mention that epes, and many many
many other such "Yiddish" words appear in southern German dialects
with great frequency.   Although I wouldn't pretend to be able to
understand 5 words of Schwaebisch, I did have the privilege of
learning Bavarian last summer, and found that many "strange" words
were familiar from Yiddish.   Most notably, words such as "epes",
"far vus", "wie azoy" (wie so), and the use of "was" as a relative
pronoun are quite common, and the personal pronouns are similar
(including "mir" or "mia" for us, and even sometime "ets" and "enk",
found in some Yiddish dialects.)    Vowels are also pronounced
similarly - for instance, Hochdeutsch "schon" can be "schoyn" (or
more frequently, a nasal "schee"), and "au" is often said "oy".
("Keine" is also "koa", much like Yiddish "ka".)

This shouldn't come as much of a surprise, since as I understand it,
Bavarian is firmly rooted as a Middle High German dialect, but I
still found it to be an interesting and often amusing comparison.
It was also a source of constant delight to my German friends and
family how fast I could learn to sound like a true yokel!   :) Nu,
genug.

Subject: eppes

Leo Rosten derives "eppes" from Middle High German, which would
explain how it go into German dialects.  It's not in Lexer's
"Woerterbuch", but I did find "eppas" in a 17th century dictionary
of the Bavarian dialect.  It's always struck me as being an
un-German looking work. I'd like to think that it came into Middle
High German from Yiddish.

While we're on the subject of German dialects:  I once heard someone
assert that the Cologne dialect was "just like Yiddish, but without
the Hebrew".  ("Hold the Hebrew"!? Is this like ordering a
sandwich!?)  I've never heard Cologne dialect spoken, and have only
read it in a few Tuennes-and-Schaaell jokes.  Personally, I don't
see it, but I'd be glad to hear from someone who knows.
