Subject: Yiddische Tageblatt

Dear Yiddish Scholars:

I am an archaeological consultant researching a property on the Lower
East Side of Manhattan that was formerly the site of a Russian Bath
house and possibly a mikveh, though this remains to be proven. The topic
turns out to be even more interesting than anticipated, as little is
known about the relationship between the Russian (steam) bath and the
mikveh, either architecturally or socially. At least, little has been
recorded on the subject in English. Alas, I do not know Yiddish,
although I can read Hebrew characters and have a good command of German.

There are a number of Yiddish avenues which I wish I could pursue, and
wonder whether anyone on this list could help me.

First, has anyone done research using the Yiddische Tageblatt or the
Morgn Zhurnal, or any other late 19th-early 20th c. (1887-c. 1920s/30s),
orthodox Yiddish newspaper, & can tell me whether bath houses/Russian
baths were advertised in there? A Ladino reader kindly sent me
references to bath house ads in the Ladino press ca. 1916, but I wonder
whether the Russian-bath-cum-mikveh facility was also usual in the
"Yiddish" community. I suppose it was, but I would like proof, ideally,
a bath house ad listing its facilities and specifically mentioning a
mikveh using the word "mikveh" and not some euphemism. Of course, an ad
for the "Allen Street Bath," at no. 5 Allen St. (not the public bath!)
the one would solve all my difficulties.

I also understand that there are a number of references to the "mikveh
lady" in Yiddish literature. I would be most interested in any literary
references to the mikveh from the period ca. 1880-1920's/30's that might
reveal attitudes about this institution and in particular, descrip-
tions of the physical layout of the bath/mikveh.

Thank you.

Subject: Yiddish writers in Winnipeg

For an article on Yiddish literature in Canada, I am seeking information
on Yiddish literary activity in Winnipeg during this century. If anyone
has information about Yiddish writers who lived in that city, or about
Yiddish cultural life there, including theatre, newspapers, literary
journals, etc. I would appreciate knowing about it. You can contact me
privately if this is not of general interest.

Subject: "Shlof mayn kind"

I'm interested in learning more about the various songs that have been
popular under the title "Shlof mayn kind."  The lullaby I recall from my
childhood is apparently the less common of the two well-known versions
of this song -- a left-wing version, discussed by Ruth Rubin in Voice of
a People, which emphasizes the untershid between rich and poor.  Thus
far, though Rubin gives the music for this version, I haven't been able
to find a recording (and if anyone knows where to look for one I'd be
ap- preciative).  Of the second main version of this song, with lyrics
by Sholem Aleichem, there are several readily available recordings.

Meanwhile, I've recently run across a third song with the same opening
refrain in Szmerke Kaczerginski's Lider fun Getos un Lagern (New York,
Cyco-Farlag, 1948).  This is a Warsaw ghetto lament for children who are
too young to know the insults and injuries that the world has in store
for them, with a call for revenge...

If anyone knows more about these songs, or their interconnections, or
about obscure recordings I could track down, I'd be grateful to hear
what you can tell me.  Thanks for your help,

Subject: _In Their Footsteps_ by Pearl Krupit

Reading Perl's book, the nostalgic journey back in time recalled to me
the concepts of a giant in the field of human development,  Erik
Erikson, winner of the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award. Erikson
categorized  a brilliant system of  eight stages of psychosexual
development, and names the final stage of psychic health "generativity"
which is the concern in guiding the next generation. It includes
productivity and creativity in handing down the values of our life's
experiences. Perl rings a bell in both counts.

As Perele shares her memories of love of her bobe, her immigrant parents
who intensely filled her with love and Yiddishkeyt, her fears for her
family trapped in war-torn Russia, I felt we might have exchanged
families and still felt very much at home.

I also must admit az ikh bin gezesn un hob gekhlipet at her account of
her role as representative to the Moscow International Book Fair of
1987, of the hunger of Russian Jews for di oysyelekh, of their thirst
for a yidish vort, of Jews who came from all parts of the Soviet Union,
some even traveling for days, to see a Yiddish book, to stroke its
binding, because a Yiddish book is sacred to them.

More of us should "bear witness" to our past as Perl did so
intelligently and well in this book of memories. Generativity creates
the shine in the goldene keyt for our kinder un kind'skinder.
