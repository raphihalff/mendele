Subject: Yiddish use by the Haredim

Does anyone know of any accurate research concerning the true extent of the use
of Yiddish as a vernacular among the Haredim?

What I have read here on Mendele or elsewhere always seems very impressionistic
and the reports are very much at odds with each other. Some people say that
Yiddish is _the_ everyday language of the ultra-orthodox in the US, Israel and
elsewhere, and that since these groups have a high birthrate the number of
Yiddish speakers is ever increasing (even if we secular Yiddish lovers don't
exactly approve of the people who really speack the language all the time every
day). Others say that even among the ultra-orthodox the land language, English
in the US, Hebrew in Israel, is gaining ground as a vernacular and the the
Yiddish which is still spoken shows certain signs of decay (impoverished
vocabulary, etc.), so that the last sizable bastion of first-language Yiddish
use is declining despite high birthrates. I suspect that the true situation is
somewhere between these two views, but I would like to see some accurate
statistics.

Two questions along this line. Are there any Haredi subscribers to Mendele who
might be able to give a real insiders view, even if only another
impressionistic view? And, is it true as it appears to me, that there are no
ultra-orthodox or even not-so-ultra orthodox Yiddish newspapers in Israel?
(There are three such in the US, Der Yid, Di Algemeiner Zhurnal, and Di
Tsaitung, but I know of none from Israel where there are several Hebrew
newspapers associated with the religious parties, despite the common assertion
that the Haredi in Israel use only Yiddish for mundane matters rather than the
Holy Tongue).

Subject: Farpotshket

Daniel Bugel (5.214) forwards an inquiry to a translators list, in which "
'farpotshket' (Yiddish)" is glossed as 'Something that is all fouled up,
especially as the result of an attempt to fix it...."  The inquiry goes on to
identify "to farpotshket" as a transitive verb.

As Mr Bugel suspects, "to farpotshket" is impossible as a verb; so is
"farpotshket" as a noun.  No doubt the root of the word is _patshken_ 'daub,
smear, scribble, scrawl'; --_patshken zikh (mit)_ 'bother with (something
messy)' [Weinreich (1968), who also gives _onpatshken_ 'make a mess; scribble
(perfective)']. For _patshken_, Harkavy (1928) adds 'to dirty, soil', which he
also gives as the gloss of both _farpatshken_ and _onpatshken_.  So I suppose
_farpatshket_ can by easy extension mean 'fouled up as a result of an attempt
to fix'.

_ongepatshket_ is often used to mean 'excessively/tastelessly/confusingly
tricked-out or ornamented or furnished'; maybe _farpatshket_ can mean the same
thing, without necessarily implying "all fouled up" in the sense 'rendered
inoperative or impossible to repair.'

Subject: Farpotschket

Daniel Bugel [5.214] asks:

    <snip> Can the transitive verb "to farpotshket" be counted upon as
    the one million and first word of the English language? <snip>

The underlying verb, as far as I know, is "potschke(n)", which means, as far as
I know, to mess around with, to tinker with, usually either idly or
incompetently. These are the kind of uses I heard as a child: "Don't potschke
with the TV; let's call Freddy who can fix it." (I got an EE degree anyway:)
"Stop potschke'ing with the thermostat, you'll break it." I have never heard a
past, participial use (farpotschket) as you site, but my mom's vernacular was
not the definitive authority.

I am very curious about the etymology of "potschke(n)".

More usual for "fouled up" (in the sense of Ger. "kaputt") was "farblonget", as
far as I know.
