Subject: shlock

I grew up with the understanding that "a shlock zol im trefn" is a curse and
should not be used in polite society.  The meaning for the term shlock was
clearly understood by all to mean a stroke.  Considering the linguist
difficulties in my household, (my father was a Poylisher and my mother is a
Litvishe) it was an unusual concurrance.  I also just checked my Weinreich
dictionary under stroke and found der shlock.

Subject: shlock or schoch?

I think there is some confusion here.  It is schoch, and not shlock, that is
placed on the sukkah roof.

schoch derives from the the Hebrew root "sin [or samech]-kuf-kuf," meaning to
cover or to roof, and a Sukkah in particular.

The word is found fairly often in the Talmud [e.g. TB Eruvin 3a]. The root is
found in the Tanach, for example in Exodus [Shemot] 25:29, where Rashi
specifically uses the word schoch to explain.

Subject: Dav(e)nen

Meyer Wolf raises some very valid objections to the etymology I support. Some
of them are among the reasons why I have not published anything yet. I myself
mentioned another loose end myself in an earlier posting, the mystery of the
-e- which some dialects or speakers have and others do not.

So for the present let us try something less ambitious than a definitive
killer argument for this etymology.  Can we at least agree that (a) most of
the other proposals are totally impossible, (b) THIS one is at least not yet
ruled out, and maybe even (c) this one is the best or even (d) the only
proposal so far that is still not ruled out--and specifically that this is so
because the D-B-B etymology accounts for the details of the actual forms.

But I would add that (a) whether dav(e)n is attested does not seem crucial to
me (unless Meyer has some argument in mind that I do not know of) and (b) the
semantic change from 'to pray quietly' to 'to pray' (in general) does not seem
to me at all outlandish, yet that is precisely what seems to be at issue in
his argument regarding the semantic developments.

Ellen Prince recalls the expression "di kale iz a freser." In our Litvak
household the expression was "di kale iz a nasherke". This means that the
bride could not wait until after the ceremony to taste the fruits of
married life.

Subject: folklore: sneezing

The superstition about the significance of sneezing aparantly also occurs
in Hungarian folk lore. In the musical piece Hary Janos by Kodaly the work
opens with a huge orchestral sneeze whose intention is to signify that the
tall tales to follow are the truth. This is evidently close to the Yiddish
lore to the effect that the preceeding tale was the truth. It is of course
unclear which culture did the borrowing.

Re Siegfried Risse's request for the texts of Yiddish songs,

	DER REBE ELIMELEKH  - text and music : Moshe NADIR (1885-1943)

	Az der rebe Elimelekh

Subject: Superstitions

Iosif Vaisman asks [vol.07.079] for equivalents of 'zol mir zan far dir'.

The theme is to be found in Rashi on Deut. 32.11 where the posik likens God to
an eagle, 'So did He spread His wings and take him, bear him along on His
pinions' (JPS trans). Rashi explains the analogy to an eagle that while other
birds carry their nestling in their feet to protect them from the eagle, the
eagle fears only man and therefore carries its offspring on its wings. The
eagle says, 'let the arrow rather hit me than my children'.

Re. Ellen Prince's query about even numbers of flowers [vol. 07.088], zuges,
which means pairs, or even numbers, is discussed in the talmud as ominous.

Here are another few superstitions.

Not to remove two garments at the same time

Spill some water before drinking

Leave some drink behind in the glass

When you're being spoken about your ears burn

Not to finish a conversation on a bad note, so khsidim have a saying
'der neshkhizer iz geveyn a gite yid in mayerels tsimes iz gite tsimes'
and so they finish the shmis

To scream 'mazel tov' when a glass or plate breaks

If you sit on the corner of a table you won't get engaged

And one final litvishe s/sh parody

Bisleyme ikh sleyme vos ikh ken nit zogn sir hasirim aser lisleyme zog
sir hasirim aser lisleyme, ober di sleyme vos di kenst zogn sir hasirim
aser lisleyme vos zogst du sir hasirim aser lisleyme?
