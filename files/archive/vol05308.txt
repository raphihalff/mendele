Subject: Daytchmerish

My mother's family came here from Riga almost 100 years ago.  Of course, they
spoke Courlander Yiddish and Courlander Deutsch.  We used the forms: "yetzt"
instead of "Itzt" and "Lezn" instead of "leyenen" (which was reserved for
reading the holy tomes: Siddur, Torah, Talmud, and all that good stuff.

In fact, I never heard of the term "daytchmerish" until Reyzl Kalifowicz-
Walletsky heard me speak in one of her classes, and coorected me.

I am sure that I used (I think I've gotten rid of the daytchmerisms in my
speech) more daytchmerish than the above, but I can't think of them now.
Courlander Yiddish is full of them.

Subject: The Internet as a _gas_ for Yiddish

Don't want to seem like a wet blanket, but a gathering of Yiddishists,
whatever the medium, does not constitute a _gas_. The Yiddish street drew its
vigor from its diversity. Alrightniks rubbed elbows with anarchist, socialist
and bolshevik organizers. Frime yidn discussed daily matters--who'd lost a
job, who'd found one, who was well, who sick, vkidoyme--with veltlekhe yidn
during lunch hour. Rarely, if ever,  : > ), did "the pluperfect" enter into
the conversation.

On the other hand, the good news is that I, for one, don't think that Yiddish
needs a _gas_ any more than Hebrew did for 2,000 years while it was loshn
koydesh, kept in the orn all week, taken out for limited use by limited
numbers af shabes. If we consider academia to be our modern orn koydish, then
the _loshn ha'kidoyshim_ will survive, if not for two millenia, then for a
longer time than either of us can contemplate. Nit gedayget.

Subject: Archive corrected text of Prager's _Kenig Pik_

Leonard Prager's essay on Sholem-Aleykhem's _Kenig Pik_ which appeared in
Mendele Vol 5: 261, 263, 270, 273, 276, 279 and 281 has been collated into a
single text with corrections for omissions and many mispellings found in the
original version (the result of scanning errors).  The corrections and
emendations were done by the author with some help from myself.  It is
available from the Mendele archive for those who wish to obtain a corrected
copy of the entire text.

Subject: Shakespeare's _Hamlet_ in Yiddish

Iosif Vaisman is of course correct that there are only two published Yiddish
translations of Shakespeare's _Hamlet_ (there are others in manuscript).
_Mendele_'s energetic bibliographer has provided an opportunity to address a
small mystery.  Anyone seeking information on Y. Goldberg in volume 2, cols.
50-51, of the _Nayer leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur_ (New York,
1958) will come away "nishtvisndik".  The anonymous author of that
biographical entry writes frankly:  "Biografishe protim feln" ('Bigraphical
details are lacking'). Only one source is listed, which I confess I have not
seen:  Kh. Dunits, _Oktyaber_, no. 110, Misnk, 1934.

Y. Goldberg is not exactly a nobody, having translated more of Shakespeare's
plays into Yiddish (_Julius Caesar_, _Othello_, _Romeo and Juliet_, _Hamlet_,
_Henry 4_, Pts. 1 and 2, _Richard III_, _The Tempest_, _Macbeth_) than anyone
else -- nine of the fourteen that have been published.  The above cited _NL_
entry only mentions six of the translations, excluding _Hamlet_.  The entry
tells us the translator was also a folklorist and comes from Belarus.  His
work in the important journal _Tsaytshrift_ (Minsk, 1926-8) is mentioned and
that's it.  I guessed and gave I. as the initial of his first name in my
_Shakespeare Quarterly_ essay, but his name may have been Yankev or Yehoyshue,
and therefore "J.".  I remember writing myself a note to find out more about
Y. Goldberg, but I must have lost it!  In any case Iosif Vaisman (who spells
his name aftselokhes with an I, whereas if I only saw it in Yiddish I would
have assumed he was either J. for Joseph" or Y. for Yoysef) has now told us
that I. Goldberg is "Itshe" Goldberg.  People who think bibliography is a
merely mechanical chore just haven't wrestled with its numberless tiny
ticklish complexities.  We all know about _another_ Itshe Goldberg -- were
there two?  I am grateful to Iosif for his Itshe whether he is right or wrong,
simply to press the matter further.  Isn't it disgraceful that we aren't even
sure about this industrious Yiddish litterateur's first name or know the least
bit about his life aside from his publications?  I would also like to know if
Iosif Vaisman is sure about the date of Vaisman's Hamlet translation. He
writes 1934, as does Ada Fogel (see below) and I wonder whether the date I
always give (Minsk 1935) is a misprint or if I saw another edition.  The
edition I recorded is edited by R. Kurliand (about whom we also know nothing).
It has 197 pages and on pages 185-197 it has an essay on _Hamlet_ by Y.
Nusinov.

Y. Nusinov an active figure on the Soviet Yiddish scene and we know a good
deal about him, but biographies of Soviet Yiddish writers often have their own
special problems and need careful checking.  The _NL_ (1965) entry on Yiskhok
Nusinov gives his death date as 1951 and concludes:  "Loyt Sheyne-Miryem
Broderzon iz er, vi a sakh andere shraybers, arestirt gevorn in detsember 1948
un iz geshtorbn in a moskver turme in 1951."  ('According to Sheyne-Miriam
Broderson, he was, like a lot of other writers, arrested in December 1948 and
died in a Moscow prison in 1951.')  But if we look at Berl Kagan's _Leksikon
fun yidish-shraybers_ (New York, 1986), we are given the death date 30
November 1950 -- presumably a date based on firmer sources than oral testimony
of a single person.  For the Y. Goldberg who worked mightily in the field of
Yiddish translation we know neither birth nor death dates.  Curiously, the
only close study of a Yiddish Shakespeare translation that we have (to the
best of my knowledge) is Ada Fogel's "Y.  Goldbergs yidshe iberzetsung fun
hamlet" (_Yidishe shprakh_ vol. 12, no. 1 <Jan - Mar 1952>, 1-11).  We learn
nothing about the translator's life from her essay.
