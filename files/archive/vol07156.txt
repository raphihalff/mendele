Subject: unter/inter = hinter/inter

Concerning such expressions as _inter Lemberg_ (Lemberik, probably) or _intern
oyvn_, the appropriate gloss of _inter_ is probably 'outside of' or 'behind'
and not 'under'. We're dealing here with the preposition _hinter_ 'behind'
which, with h-dropping becomes homonymous with the SouthernYiddish rendition
of the preposition _unter_, i.e., [inter] 'under'. In other words, a good
Polish Yiddish expression like [int@r d@ shtu:it] means 'outside the city'.

Subject: "Mail"

I notice that some postings render the Yiddish "mail" as English "mile."  This
isn't quite correct.  The Yiddish word, although very colloquial, means
"league" and comes from the German word "Meile" = "league" (die
Siebenmeilenstiefel = the seven-league boots in "Puss in Boots") and was
ultimately a late Germanic borrowing from Latin "milia" = "thousands"). While
the Roman "milia" was equal to 1,620 English yards, the German "Meile" is
about five times the length of an English mile.  However, the Yiddish "mail"
is quite colloquial as opposed to the obsolescent "league" in English.  If
you're translating a vague distance, "mir zenen geforn a por mailen," I'd
render it vaguely as "we rode a couple of miles."  But if you're stressing
distance, "mir zenen gegangen tsu fus a gantse mail," I'd be more punctilious
and write "we trudged a whole five miles."

Subject: "shmok"

While Diane Wolfthal's excursus on the art historical phallic symbolism of
tail, etc. is interesting, it has absolutely no bearing on the relationship or
rather non-relationship (as demonstrated by Mikhl Herzog) of German "Schmuck"
(jewel/jewelry, etc.) and Yiddish "shmok"  (dick, cock). 

On the other hand, Yiddish "shmok" did enter German language and culture:  the
German author Gustav Freytag wrote a play called DIE JOURNALISTEN (THE
JOURNALISTS), which featured an unsavory journalist named "Dr. Schmock." 
Presumably borrowed from Yiddish, "Schmock" must have already existed
colloquially--otherwise the name wouldn't be comical.  The character's name
then eponysmously entered German with a new meaning:  "a shoddy journalist". 
There was even a play by Carl Sternheim (I think)  entitled DER SCHMOCK (THE
YELLOW JOURNALIST). 

Much to my surprise, the reference books I've consulted state that the German
colloquialisms "Schmoeker"  (trashy book) and "schmoekern" (to read trashy
books) derive from a Low German word (not Yiddish) meaning a "smoked-up book." 
I wonder, though, if Dr. Schmock's name played any part in the development of
these two German words?

Subject: Mel Poretz's memories

Two more comments in connection with Mel Poretz's memories (07.143):

1. For two theories about the origins of _lakhn mit yashtsherkes_ see Mendele
volumes 1.208 and 5.068. 

2. In Russian one can say of someone who has died suddenly (nisht far keyne
mendelyaner gedakht) that he or she has been "grabbed by Kondrashka" (_ego/ee
Kondrashka khvatil_).  This rather inelegant expression, it has been
suggested, goes back to a peasant uprising on the Don River in 1707, which was
led by a certain Kondratii Bulavin.  ("Kondrashka" is a diminutive of
"Kondratii.")

Subject: Khala khalelyas?

My father, who was born in Eishishok, about 35 miles SSW of Vilne, used a
similar expression, which as a child I heard as "ah-le-ye-hus."

Oddly I was put in mind of it myself only a few weeks ago when a friend
mentioned that her family members, with origins near Bialystok, used to say,
"Vayt vi Eishishok," as far as Eishishok, to mean the same thing. 

I have no idea what the origin might be, and have struck out with landslayt so
far, as well as with Weinreich and Harkavy. Any help would be appreciated.

Subject: Soviet Yiddish Writers

With reference to Leah Zazulyer's enquiry [07.153], there are surprisingly
few book-form translations into English of Soviet Yiddish writers, viz.:

Dovid Bergelson, _When All is Said and Done_, tr. Bernard Martin, Athens: 
Ohio U.P., 1977, 310pp. [ISBN: 0-8214-0392-3] [= _Nokh alemen_]. 

Dovid Bergelson, The Stories of David Bergelson: Yiddish Short Fiction from
Russia_, tr. & intro. Golda Werman, foreword Aharon Appelfeld, Syracuse U.P.,
1996, xxxii, 157pp. [ISBN 0-8156-2712] [cont.: 'Departing' [= 'Opgang'],
'Impoverished' [= 'Yordim'], 'Remnants' [= 'Droyb']]. 

Der Nister, _The Family Mashber_, tr. Leonard Wolf, London: Collins, 1987,
688pp. [ISBN:  0-00-223257-x] [= _Di mishpokhe mashber_].

However, there have been many more book-form translations into Russian, German
and, particularly in recent years, into French etc. Furthermore, if one takes
translations in anthologies and journals into account the body of material in
English and other languages is too extensive to enumerate here.  If Leah
Zazulyer would like to let me know more precisely what she is seeking I could
provide her with more exhaustive listings.

Subject: Salcia Landmann

Just a brief comment regarding the rather ill-tempered attack in a recent
Mendele posting [07.149] on Salcia Landmann's _Jiddisch_ (subtitled _Das
Abenteuer einer Sprache_).  The writer characterizes her books as "inaccurate"
while at the same time misspelling both her first and last name as "Salicia
Landman". So much for inaccuracies.  He then says "she doesn't even get the
Yiddish alphabet right."  I'm looking at pages 370 - 372 _Das Jiddische
Alphabet_ and everything seems to be quite in order.  Finally Salcia Landmann
is called "stupid" - even stupider than Leo Rosten!  Here's where I REALLY
take exception.  Nobody can possibly write a book that's stupider than Leo
Rosten's _The Joys of Yiddish_ !!

Subject: linguists and linguistics

I don't see what those of you who are complaining about my attempts to keep
the facts of Yiddish linguistic from being overwhelmed with myths are really
so unhappy about.  There are so many more of you and than of me--or even of
all the linguists currently working on Yiddish historical linguistics anywhere
in the world! The shoe is on the other foot anyway: it is you guys who are
apparently trying to silence me, simply because you don't like being told some
simple home truths. I never tried to censor anybody, but rather appealed to
people to censor THEMSELVES and to stop spreading misinformation.  And I must
say that you are being successful up to a point: several people have written
to me privately to endorse my views, but apparently do not dare say so on the
list.  Congratulations!

Subject: Yiddish: a work in progress

I know from experience that even in academia, a spirit of mutual scorn and
disparagement holds sway regarding a point in dispute.  That is always
destructive and unnecessary.  That spirit has no place in any field, including
so important an enterprise as educating each other in Yiddish language and
literature. 

"Opinions are made to be changed - or how is truth to be got at?"  So wrote
Lord Byron in a letter in 1817.  The poet knew something about the process of
advancing knowledge, depth of understanding and insight.  This applies to any
field: poetry, politics, and especially including any field of scientific
research.  I boldly (feeling rather safe in this) include linguistics,
especially in Yiddish. 

My own experience in academic scientific research has taught me that.  Any
idea, any theory, any result must stand rigorous tests.  Anyone who won't face
the test of his or her idea or result is simply holding on to unsupported
dogma.  The testing process itself is the educational process that yields
knowledge, understanding, insight.  Then we may build a new, higher platform
from which to operate.  Willingness to face testing is part of what I meant by
appropriate humility in the face of the huge task in Yiddish research
(language and literature, both).  It is, after all, a work in progress. 

Proposals that turn out to be wrong (even in Yiddish linguistics) often have
what is known as "heuristic value".  Even the phlogiston theory had heuristic
value because testing it revealed a better view of the true nature of
combustion.  Copernicus tested the Ptolemy scheme and so achieved better
insight, but Copernicus did not sneer at Ptolemy nor have the last word. 
Copernicus made mistakes.  However, what a wonderful, new, higher platform he
built!  As one result we have the Hubble telescope and its astonishing
discoveries. 

The word "heuristic" comes from Greek "heuriskein," to find.  Related to it is
the word "eureka!" I have found it!  Finding and reporting are fundamental
processes in any research.  Let's get to it, to continue to find and learn and
share more and more about Yiddish language and literature without fear of
making occasional mistakes.
