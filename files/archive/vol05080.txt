Subject: Klor-vays tsigele

Can anyone give me a short exegesis of the "klor-vays tsigele" motif in
Yiddish literature? I know it shows up in lullabyes and such, but I get the
sense it has at times been used to convey some symbolic meaning -- I'm just
not well-read enough to know what.

And on an unrelated note: In Mendele 5.072 I posted excerpts of a recent
interview with Josef Levinson, editor of "Yerushalyim d'Lita" in Vilna. For
anyone interested, I have now completed a translation (with great help from
Mark Alsher and Paul Pascal) which I will be happy to email on request.

Subject: Rhyming

Did Rokhl Korn rhyme _kleyd_ and _layd_?

Shleyme Axelrod's transliteration of Rokhl Korn's poem reveals a problem
that I myself continue to have with the word _layd_. He has the poet
rhyming _kleyd_ and _layd_, but _layd_ only occurs as the first person
singular of the verb _laydn_, i.e. _ikh layd_; it does not (i.e., "should
not") occur as a noun.

There are two related nouns in Yiddish. The one derived from the
infinitive is _dos laydn_ (singular). Alternatively there is a singular
_di leyd_ (to rhyme with Rokhl Korn's _kleyd_),and a plural _leydn_, as
in the expression _in leydn un in freydn_.

Subject: A Nay Kleyd

Many thanks to Shleyme Axelrod for transcribing Rokhl Korn's poem.  I
don't have access to Ruth Whitman's anthology, however, and I find my-
self at a loss in translating the 3rd line of the 2nd stanza and the word
"faldn" in the 5th line.  For the latter I get "folds" but this is given
as "falbn" in Weinreich's dictionary.  For the former I get: "And it's an
every white-glass knot" which doesn't quite make it -- problem being the
"every" ("yeder"), I think...  Can someone help me out?  A sheynem dank!

Subject: Yiddish fonts

My name is Brenda Fayerman and I am the technology coordinator at Bialik
High School in Montreal.  We are a non-religious day school and we teach
Yiddish as a compulsory subject (as well as English, Hebrew, and French).
There are 700 students and Yiddish is streamed in every grade (beginner
to advanced levels).

We produce several in-house Yiddish texts and my question is:  do any
Yiddish fonts exist?  We are currently using Hebrew fonts in Dagesh but
we have difficulty when we want, for example, double vov or double yud
with a patach etc.  Any help would be much appreciated.

As well, I am working on integrating CD-ROM and Internet into the teaching
of  every subject at the school.  Any advice or resources for the use of
technology in teaching Yiddish would be very useful.

Subject: Yiddish in translation

A sheynem dank to Hershl Hartman for his response (Mendele 5.078) to my
comments about Yiddish in translation.  I agree with him that it would be
interesting to have a survey among Mendelyaner such as the one he has
suggested.  It would be nice if enough members of this list would respond
to qualify as a mini-survey.

In response to Miriam Isaacs (also Mendele 5.078), the readings which
were aired on radio in Los Angeles were only in English.  The National
Yiddish Book Center has in the past produced tapes in Yiddish which were
read by professional actors (I have most of them), but as far as I know
they were never read on the air.  I agree with her about the importance
of aural comprehension, and I did make use of these tapes in teaching my
Yiddish classes here in Phoenix.

Subject: Tin Pan Alley's mock-"Yiddish dialect" pop songs

The question I wish to pose here does not, strictly speaking, concern
Yiddish: indeed, it concerns an instance of the deliberate bastardization
of Yiddish and the satirization of the language and its speakers. I am
writing a Master's thesis on the Jewish songwriters and song publishers
of Tin Pan Alley and the role that popular music played in the
acculturation of Jewish immigrants to American life.

Of particular interest to me are the hundreds of English-language
"yiddisha songs" that Tin Pan Alley tunesmiths composed in the decade
before the First World War.  These songs, written in mock-"Yiddish
dialect" (punctuated by frequent "oys" and Yinglish malapropisms) and
performed on the Vaudeville stage by "Hebrew Comics," enjoyed enormous
popularity; American popular cultural legends such as Irving Berlin,
Fanny Brice, Sophie Tucker and Al Jolson were among those that wrote and
performed them.

While their depiction of Jews is often offensive -- and their spiteful
misuse of Yiddish undoubtably apalling to Yiddishists -- songs like
"Abie, Take an Example from Your Fader", "At the Yiddisha Wedding Dance",
"That's Yiddisha Love", "Yiddle On Your Fiddle, Play Some Ragtime", "I
Want to Be an Oy, Oy, Oyviator (A Yiddisha Plea)" and "Cohen's Yiddisha
Band" provide the historian with a fascinating glimpse of contemporary
Jewish attitudes towards Americanization and the ways that popular music
and theater mediated the Americanization process.

I would be very grateful to any Mendele readers who might care to share
thoughts about, or better still, recollections of, Tin Pan Alley's
"yiddisha" song craze. My grandmother recalls seeing Sophie Tucker peform
"My Yiddishe Momma" on vaudeville in both English and Yiddish; but I am
interested not so much in songs like "My Yiddishe Momma" or the Yiddish
"crossover" hit "Bey Mir Bist Du Sheyn" as I am in this genre of
English-language, faux-"Yiddish dialect" pop songs.
