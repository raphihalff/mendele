Subject: Moyshe Kapoyer

My grandmother used to refer to Moyshe Kapoyer (which she pronounced
"Kapeye"), Yente Telebende, and Chaye Tsipe, in the sense of "Tom, Dick,
and Harry" -- lovable "average folk."  If someone said something
pretentious, she might have responded, "Tell it to Chaye Tsipe," which
meant, "That won't mean much to an ordinary down-to-earth person."

I have learned (as Joe Kurland says in Vol 6.211) that Moyshe was a
cartoon character in the Forverts.  I believe Yente had her own column.
I have never heard any reference to Chaye Tsipe, though -- has anyone
else heard of her?

Subject: Moyshe Kapoyer

Moyshe Kapoyer was briefly discussed in Mendele three years ago (vols
3.265 and 3.271). There is also an old record:

Sam Katsen and Joe Feldman, Moyshe Kapoyer, Columbia Records E3562; 1920
(1 sound disc : 78 rpm, mono. ; 10 in.)

Subject: Women Yiddish writers

Liebe Denner, who seeks women fiction writers (6.211), will discover
"Found Treasures" (Second Story Press, Toronto, 1994 - edited by Frieda
Forman) to be a rewarding experience. The first of its kind, this
anthology is an extraordinary collection of prose, that showcases
women's writing, previously available only in Yiddish.

It features 18 writers, among them Rachel Korn, Esther Singer Kreitman,
Kadya Molodowsky, Malka Lee, Fradel Shtok, and opens a window on the
fabric of women's lives and feelings in the shtetls and cities of
Eastern Europe.

Irena Klepfisz, an important poet, thinker and lecturer, created the
introduction which is a jewel, intense and brilliant, and gives an
overview of the history of mame-loshn; her penetrating words are alone
worth the price of the book.

I reviewed it for Mendele last summer (my husband tells me it is vol
6.045) and tried to motivate our khevre to buy the book and help support
the work on volume 11. Happily, this work is now well underway.

Buying the book is like chicken soup. It still "couldn't hurt."

Suggestion: Sarah Reizen, sister of Avrum Reizen. She wrote short
stories. I don't know if she wrote anything longer.

Subject: Women Yiddish writers

Ellen Cassedy is looking for Found Treasures: Stories by Yiddish Women
Writers, edited by Frieda Forman, Ethel Raicus, Sarah Silberstein Swartz
and Margie Wolfe (Second Story Press, Toronto, 1994).  This paperbound
book is available from the National Yiddish Book Center, from Arbeter
Ring's bookstore and in feminist and Jewish bookstores.  It contains
stories by Esther Singer Kreitman, Celia Dropkin, Rachel Korn and Kadia
Molodovsky, as well as lesser known authors.

The story behind this anthology is an interesting one.  According to one
of the editors who gave a workshop at Di Froyn, in New York in October,
1995,the book grew out of a Yiddish reading group composed of
intergenerational women with various degrees of proficiency in Yiddish.
Because some of the women were still developing their Yiddish reading
skills, the group decided to read only short stories which could be read
out loud at the group's sessions before general discussion, rather than
having the group read the materials in advance.  All group members took
turns reading aloud.  It was asserted that the less proficient readers
benefitted with both their comprehension and pronounciation in hearing
the women who were native Yiddish speakers and receiving their
corrections and help.  It soon became obvious to the women that they
were reading works which were largely overlooked, and certainly not
translated into English with any frequency.  One of the members being a
publisher, it was natural for the group to decide not only to read and
discuss the stories they found, but to translate them for publication.

At the workshop, it was asserted that the stories included were chosen
either for literary merit or because they were representative of a
particular Jewish woman's experience.
