Subject: Shmoolyaris

Recently Zachary Baker wrote that in Philip Roth's new book Roth's
parents are cited as using the term "shmoolyaris" for money and
wondered about the possible origins of the term.  While I have never
heard such a term used in Yiddish either, I wonder if it is a
"Yiddishization" of "simolies," a slang term for money (I have no
idea of the origins of this term.).

Zachary Baker asks:

>strangest word I came across in Mr. Roth's new book is 'shmoolyaris'
>(singular, 'shmoolyareh'), used by his Jewish immigrants to mean
>'dollars.'  Do any of you remember such a word from your childhoods?
>Could it possibly come from 'Shmul,' the Yiddish form of the Hebrew
>name Shmuel or Samuel -- that is Uncle Sam?"

I don't remember the word from my childhood, but I've been
puzzling for years about a definition in the OSPD (Official Scrabble
Players' Dictionary):  Simoleon, n.  A dollar.

Sounds like the answer to one may be the answer to the other.

Subject:  two comments

1.  re feygele:  Given the nature of lexicon origin there is no need
for a monogenesis for this term.  It is clearly reinforced by its
being a yiddish-ization of "fag", and it could also be connected
with the dim. of 'bird'. I'm not sure the connection "bird-penis'
works here.  As Kessler notes, the context is hetero, but more
significantly, it is at least as much Christian as pagan.  It is not
just A bird, but the dove, which in early Christian art is poised in
the air strategically over an otherwise nude christ-figure. The dove
is an ancient symbol of fecundity, and it is no accident that the
ruach kodesh appeared to Mary in that form when the founding deed of
one of our daughter religions was performed.  But did such metaphors
find their way into the consciousness of Ashkenazi Jews?  By the
way, does the proverb "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"
have any relevance here?

2.  Note to Howie Aronson:  In Lithuanian also the only term in
common use is Zhydas.  The "hebraju kalba" etc, being strictly
learned.  Is there really a connection between usage and Cath vs
Ortho?  In Russian the dichotomy is a learned phenomenon, the
descent of zhid being a development of the last 2 centuries.  I
guess the further out into the sticks you go in Russia, the more
neutral the term.

Subject: the name for 'yiddish'

thanks to howard aronson and others who've pointed out that there
are lots of 'jewish' languages, so calling yiddish 'jewish' would be
eurocentric etc. but how come such eurocentrism is totally ok in
yiddish, where, after all, the language IS called by the yiddish
word for 'jewish'? while this eurocentrism avoidance might be a good
reason for keeping the english term as it now stands, i find it hard
to believe that it was any sort of real motivation for adopting it
in the first place.

Subject: Sports terminology

I would appreciate help on the following:  The people who run the
electronic message boards at football & basketball games plan to put
digitized cheers on the board in several languages (in orthography,
since it will be digitized). They have requested the Yiddish
equivalent for the yell:  "Defense!"  In English, this is a noun
(though with "sports-stress on initial syllable).  Can anyone
provide me with a reliable Yiddish corresponding  word/phrase?
Obviously, I'm looking for what Yiddish speakers would call during
football/soccer/basketball games, not merely a translation of
"defense" into "farteydikung"  (unless that is what people actually
have used).  Thus, it may be something that translates into English
as "stop ('em)", or "block ('em)", or whatever.  If people can
provide a few other such sports terms, it would be appreciated.
Thanks.

Neil Jacobs
