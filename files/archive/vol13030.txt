Subject: shikse

The origin of the word shikse has been dealt with over the years on Mendele.
(I used Google to find several references to it in the Mendele archives.)
The ones I saw referred to the Hebrew word "sheketa," meaning "creepy-crawly
thing, unclean creature, young devil, forbidden..."  This seems to explain
the usually unsavoury connotation when the term is used in conversation,
referring to a (young) non-Jewish female.

Is there possibly any other less unflattering derivation of shikse, or
milder English translations of the Hebrew word "shekets?"

Subject: Re: oyfn hoykhn barg

I know this little ditty from my early childhood when my grandmother would
sing it to me. [My yiddish transliteration is based on the oyshprakh of the
Podolia region of what is now the Ukraine, in the gubernye of
Kamenyets-Podolsk.]

afn hoykhn barg
'n af di griner gruz
shteyn a pur datchelekh
mit di lahge batchelekh
hoykhe mener zenen zey
kurtse kleyder
trugn zey
uvinu meylekh
dus harts is mir freylekh
freylekh veln mir zan
trinkn veln mir van
van veln mir trinkn
a gezint in dan kepele aran

My grandmother was born about 1870 and would sing me this ditty in the
latter part of the second decade of the 20th century --1915-1920 ñ.

Subject: Re: alef-beyz song

In answer to Marvin Engel [Mendele 13.028], here is an alef-beyz song
written by Nat Zumoff, of the Cleveland Workmen's Circle, sung to the tune
of  Doe - A - Deer from The Sound of Music (probably in the 1960s).  I know
of the texts of others in Yiddish from I.L. Cahan's collection of yidishe
folkslider, but without music.

der alef-beyz

Alef - Ah, and sometimes aw
Beyz - That's not the way to be
Giml - Gee, in good, in gut
Daled - Has the sound of D
Hey - In fields we see it grow
Vov - It rhymes with love, you know
Zayin - Zee, it's time to say
            That's our lesson for today;

Khes - A strange, new sound is this
Tes - A girl I see each day
Yud - You'd never, ever miss
Khof - It isn't tough to say
Lamed - That's the sound of ell
Mem - In mame, mir, un mel
Nun - Is sometimes call midday
That's our lesson for today!

Samekh - SSS, a hissing sound
Ayen - Eh, in words like kez
Pey - We get for year `round
Fey - A little friend of Tess
Tsadik - Is a worthy man
Kuf - You have the sound in Can
Reysh - a quiet kind of ray
That's our lesson for today!

Shin - Is she, so quiet, shtil
Sof - It is the very end
Tof - A dotted Sof, you see
            In Hebrew words we recommend
If you sing this little tune
You will learn it very soon
You'll remember it always
And you'll know your Alef-Beyz!

Subject: Re: iberhkhazern

Instead of looking at the noun "khazer," look elsewhere in Hebrew. The
shoresh (root) khes. zayin.resh has to do with "return, repeat, go back".
The pa'al verb (khozer) means to return.

Subject: Re: iberkhazern

The short answers are that it isn't, and there may not be any connection.

I've always believed that it's impossible to fully understand Yiddish as a
non-native speaker without a solid grounding in Hebrew (and at least one
Slavic language, preferably Polish or Ukrainian), and this is a perfect
example of why.

It's true that the Hebrew word "chazir" (chet-zayin-yod-resh) means pig.
However, "chozar" (spelled without a yod) is a verb meaning "return, revert;
repeat; or repent," depending on (1) context and (2) the following
preposition - or absence of one.  A little knowledge is a dangerous thing.

As for a connection between pigs and returning, your guess is as good as
mine.  It may have something to do with the fact that both chet and zayin
each correspond to two different letters in Arabic.  Therefore, while
"chazir" and "chozar" appear to be related, they may not actually be derived
from the same proto-Semitic root after all.

Hope this helps.  a freylekhn un koshern peysach alemen.

Subject: Re: iberkhazern

Itsik Goldenberg (Mendele 13.029) asks:

<Can anyone suggest why the Yiddish word iberkhazern, which means "to
<review, to repeat, to go over," is derived from the Hebrew word "khazer,"
<meaning "pig." What is the connection?

The word iberkhazern is a combination of the Yiddish "iber" [above, beyond]
and the Hebrew "la-chzor" or "chazara" [to repeat, repetition]. It has
nothing to do with chazir (i.e., pig). Of course, as is common in Yiddish
the "la-chzor" or "chazara" took a mutational turn in Yiddish into
"khazern." Indeed Harkavy gives the Hebrew translation to iberkhazern as
chazarah (p. 89). I could not locate any dictionary which listed "khazern"
by itself as used in Yiddish, and my guess is that its proximity to
chazir=pig made it a repulsive expression for Yiddish speakers.

The expression itself smacks of double redundancy (intentional sic.),
similar to the Hebrew "shuv pa'am," "ben zakhar" etc. Usually, in my
experience, such a literary device has its meaning. In the case of
iberkhazern it is to emphasize the requirement to go over the learned text
over, and over, and over, again until it is memorized, understood etc. The
Talmud cites the virtue of the one who repeats the text 101 as compared to
the one who did it only 100 times (Chagiga 9b).
