I'm self-taught in Yiddish.  I sing in a Yiddish chorus

lit., but have an interest in it.

Dave, I think you're quite right about the difference
between Crown Heights and Williamsburg.
 
As for "gafrur", it means 'match' (for lighting a fire,
that is); "ose gafrurim" is thus 'one who makes
matches' i.e., a 'matchmaker'. Someone translating into
Hebrew from a Yiddish-English word list in College
Yiddish, read Y."shadkhn-E.matchmaker" & rendered it
H."ose gafrurim". OK? The same person read Y."der
shvitsshap-E.sweatshop" and, believe it or not,
H."khanut mamtakim" (= candy-store; i.e., 'sweet-
shop'). Add that to your collection. Mikhl.

*************
I would have thought that birth records in geborne San
Fransisco would have been better than that, especially
after the earthquake and fire.  There should no longer
be any necessity to give approximate [ca.] birth dates.

*************
 
A gafrur is a match [the kind you light a fire with] as
in the Hanna Senesch poem, "Ashrai ha-Gafrur." [Happy
is the Match]   Ose gafrur = match-maker.
