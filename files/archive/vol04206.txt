Subject: Western Yiddish folk music

On the subject of music, it was very pleasant to read Arre Komar's recent
contribution (of a number of issues ago).  His latest communication on
the subject, however, warrants comment.

"An interesting question was raised concerning western Yiddish folk
music. In fact there doesn't seem to be any.  [...] [T]rue secular
folksongs dealing with romantic and personal topics seem to [have] arisen
suddenly in Poland in the 18th century, [...] it seems to have been the
spontaneous creation of the women who spoke true mama [sic] loshn, rather
than the more sophisticated hebraized Yiddish of the kheder [sic]
educated men (which seems to be getting more popular among academicians
in recent years)."

As for the last point regarding Yiddish stylistics (viz., the register
used in academic Yiddish), I know of no documentation in the literature
for the validity of this statement.  In fact, I know of the opposite:
there have been summonses to maintain Talmudic style in Yiddish
expository prose (Yudl Mark's article "Lomir ufhitn di ashires fun
talmed-khokhems shprakh" from the 1950s [?] is, if memory serves me
correctly, the title of one such well known manifesto.)  And recall that
kheyder is Jewish primary school, so saying that academicians are using
kheyder-loshn isn't giving them much credit -- it is just as
sophisticated as children learning khumesh can be expected to be.  So I
assume that Komar means the register of Jewish scholarly discourse. But I
also know of no serious claim in the literature that the Yiddish used by
academes today is any different from the Yiddish used by academes in
previous years. There are a number of Mendele-readers who are quite well
acquainted with Yiddish academic writing both of today and years past,
and I wonder if they would concur with my subjective feeling that no
special "Hebraicization" has occurred in the register of academic
discourse.  (A "Yiddishization" -- yes, i.e. expository prose has come to
reflect the facts of the various registers and styles of spoken Yiddish
more and more over the past century.)

Ober nit dos bin ikh oysn, as you can see by my subject line.

I wish to correct an error of reasoning and a factual error which inhere
in the statement "there doesn't seem to be any [western Yiddish folk
music]".

Firstly, it would probably be the assumption of any student of culture
that where there are groups of people, there is music (instrumental,
song, what-have-you).  When looking at a specific ethnic group, then,
negative evidence is not instructive (the Talmudic dictum "loy yodati
eyno rayo", i.e. '[the claim] "I did not know" does not constitute
evidence'). In our specific instance, this would translate into the
faulty logic of the claim "unless you have evidence that group X has some
form of musical expression, assume that they don't".

Fortunately, we don't have to rely on conceptual arguments to derive the
claim that "mayrev-yidn" had folkmusic.  We can simply open one of the
classic collections of Yiddish folkmusic.  Take, for example, Y.-L.
Cahan's _Yidishe folkslider mit melodyes_.  Since they are quite
entertaining (linguistically, poetically, culturally), let me reproduce
songs #264-266.  This way, readers will get a glimpse of some "Western
Yiddish" in full, running text as opposed to the single words or phrases
usually adduced in discussion of the dialect. These songs, you will note,
fit Arre Komar's definition of folkmusic, viz. "secular [creations]
dealing with romantic and personal topics".  (Note, also, that these are
not criteria that the present-day folklorist usually uses for determining
the "folkness" of a cultural ceation -- does the Peysekh song "Mo adabro,
mo asapro, ver ken zogn, ver ken reydn, vos di eyns batayt" not fall
under the category of Yiddish folkmusic because it is of a religious
nature? -- but that's another story.)

(The following is a transcription of the text presented in Cahan, which
itself is a transcription of Western Yiddish into the writing system of
Eastern Yiddish.  I wouldn't be surprised if the actual pronunciation,
especially of the vowels and diphthongs, is quite different from the way
it is presented by Cahan, a non-linguist.  But we'll have to leave that
to our imagination and to those who know more about Western Yiddish
phonology than I to further clarify.  By the sequence "ou" is meant the
vowel sound in American English _so_ or _sew_.)

Cahan #264
- -----------

ven de matesdorfer madelokh
zayn nokh ezoy eydl
gey iekh doukh liber
tsi de ritlens kreydl

dou zougt de kreydl:
iekh vorf dekh eros;
gebt eyr ir noukh e poar
barkhezlokh derouf

The footnotes tell us that Cahan collected this song from Roze
Halbershteter, born 1852.  Max Weinreich, who edited the 1957 edition of
Cahan's _Yiddish Folkslider..._ glosses the song with the following
approximation:  "The girls of Matesdorf may be real fine, but I
nevertheless go to Kreydl, Ritl's daughter.  Says Kreydl:  'I'm throwing
you out!'  So he gives her a couple of khales on top of everything
else".(_barkhes_  are 'khales' in Western Yiddish.)

Cahan #265
- -----------
shabes ouvnt zougt de mame:
netl, tsik de u!
tsik de nur day aler shenste
shabeskladl u.

tomer kimt der khosn
in nemt dekh oune gelt;
e mise mad tsi patern
iz git far de gantse velt

M. Weinreich indicates in the footnotes that _netl_ is a girl's name and
_tsik de u_ is the equivalent of Eastern Yiddish 'tu zikh on'.  The
reader of Yiddish should find the rest of the song discernible (if quite
different from the language we're used to).  Cahan collected this from
Hermine, the daughter of Roze Halbershteter (of #264 fame), who was born
in 1890.

Cahan #266
- ------------
shabes ouvnt zougt de mame:
zali, ti dekh u,
kensti mit mer mitgeyn
in tantszal enu.

ti der dayne ale shenstn
shabesklader u,
tomer vird zikh aner
ferlibn in du.

dali, dali, day,
ezoy zougt mer, ezoy,
e mise mad puter tsi vern
iz ka shpileray.

vasti ferheyrat zay,
makhst dokh in krey ay;
dous iz doukh va
nur puter zay

Key:  zali = 'girl's name'; u = modern Yiddish 'on'; enu = mod. Yid
'arunter'; in du = 'in dir'; zougt mer = 'zogt men'; vasti = 'vestu';
makhst doukh in krey ay = in English: 'you soil yourself in horseradish';
puter zay = mo. Yid. 'poter zayn'.

All three songs are from Ayznshtot (Eisenstadt); the last one is also
from Lackenbach.  These are in Burgenland (part of Austria, bordering on
Hungary.)

I hope you enjoyed this very basic introduction to Western Yiddish
folkmusic. I personally know very little about it, but obviously there is
"what to know".

Subject: A teacher(?) learns from a student!

Of course it was bound to happen!  A beginning Yiddish student in Israel
has taught me a lesson I should have had right up front in my mind.  At
my advanced age, I tend to think of myself as having things to teach, and
I do.  But as I pointed out in an earlier post, contact with a student is
always an opportunity for the teacher to learn important lessons,
solicited or not.  Miriam Halkin is, as she says, a beginner in Yiddish.
She forcefully, on target, made a most important point about the
desirability of accurate, grammatical Yiddish on Mendele.  As a beginner,
she wants to feel confident that she is not misled grammatically,
orthographically, idiomatically, etc.  Do we need a better lesson than
this?  Do not Mendele subscribers feel a responsibility to the young
'uns? Isn't that the only way to see that Yiddish lives?

Thanks for the lesson, Miriam.

(A lebn af dayn kepele!  I hope that's correct.  Don't ever hesitate to
check with your local teacher(s).)

Still, I am interested in reading all contributions, corrected or
uncorrected, from beginners who are bound to stumble, or from veterans
who may have a more casual approach to grammar, etc.  I vote for an
inclusionary policy.
