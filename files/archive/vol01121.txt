Subject: Der rebbe in song

Many thanks to Bob Rothstein for tracking down that song.
Curiously enough I know shreds of quite another version,
but they're from a long way back and it's quite possible
that they came to be as a result of the great popularity
that Bob's version may have enjoyed.  That it _was_ popular
is attested by the existence of at least one English
version from the early 30's: the rebbe had a bellyache from
eating Tastycake and so's your uncle Jake.

Sigh.

Yet another version (I have absolutely no idea where or
from whom I heard them; I'm pretty sure it was _not_ the
radio) was a good deal more hostile.  Instead of:

            oy der rebenyu
            oy iz dos a rebenyu
            vi er geyt
            vi er shteyt
            aza yor af mir..

the last line went:

            aza yor af im!

and what a difference a pronoun makes.

In any event, this rebbe song was one of several that
mocked Hasidism.  Take this one (again I have absolutely no
idea how I came to know it; it certainly was not sung at
home):

            AY ay ay ay AY ay ay
            nisim v'niflo-oys
            er shpringt arayn in vasser
            un kumt aroys a nasser!

I suppose that these songs belong, if not to the Maskilic
tradition per se then to its left-wing successors in
Poland.  I would be surprised if they were born here.  It's
useful to keep in mind that Hasidism in the New World
barely existed and informed knowledge about it was
similarly sparse.  Most of us who grew up in the 20's and
30's didn't know precisely what a rebbe was, conflating him
perhaps with a melamed. My grandmother, for instance, might
have reminisced that her father 'fleg furn tsum gitn id'
but it was only as an adult that I realized she was talking
about a rebbe (Reb Borekhl of Tulchin at that).  I mention
all of this only to suggest that what passed for Jewish
popular culture in America before World War II was based on
a base of colossal ignorance.  As everyone knows, all that
has changed.
