Subject: Introduction and a Cheer

I grew up in a secular Jewish home. My father was in the labor movement
and also wrote short stories and articles for the "Forverts". As a child
(9 or 10) I went to Arbeter Ring  Shule 3 in the Bronx. Although I only
attended for a few years a lot of the mameloshn stayed with me. When I
was 13 I went away for the summer to "kemp ganeden" (Camp Eden), in Cold
Spring NY. I am a mostly retired CPA and despite my Yiddish shortcomings,
I enjoy lurking in Mendele. My children went to Camp Boiberik for many
years and I cherish the relationships that my wife and I made there.

I remember a camp cheer which we used in Camp Eden (Yiddish naturally):

	Akachika boom boom risha risha
	Ekhla pekhla shmunya
	Di rebbe un rebitzen hobn gatantzd
	Un hobn forloyrn alles in gantz
	Ain tzvai ut azay
	Forvets tageblat hooray
	Alakazoo gezoo gezam
	We don't give a damn
	Alamem alemem
	Alemem etasha ishkeda boom boom
	Rah rah rah rah
	Team team team

What memories!

Subject: Whence plurals in -im

Ellen Prince asks why Yiddish _poyer_ has the plural ending -im. As I
recall, I once submitted a long posting on Yiddish noun plurals which
included a discussion of _poyer_. I haven't learned to consult the Index
but, if someone knows how to retrieve the relevant number of Mendele, it
may be useful.

[Vol. 3.113 nm]

In a not sufficiently refined nutshell, with a somewhat reckless use of
terminology for which I beg your indulgence:

In large measure, the plural ending -im, derived in the first instance
from Hebrew, probably has to be viewed, not only as an allomorph of the
Yiddish plural morpheme {N}, but also as a morphophonemic alternant of
its allomorph {n}.

To wit: Standard Yiddish _ganovim_, _yontoyvim_, _katsovim_, etc. are
actually realized with [im] a) in Standard Yiddish, b) largely in Litvish
Yiddish.

Elsewhere, the plural ending, in these words, is usually the homotopical
nasal variant of the allomorph {n}, in these cases, the labiodental [m,];
thus _yontoyvn [= m,], _katsuvn_, _ganuvn_. Actually, in German, the word
is written _Ganoven_ (see the paperback: Doris Mendlewitsch (hrsg.)
_Ladies, Leichen und Ganoven: Kriminalgeschichten aus dem 19tn
Jahrhundert_.)

Similarly, Standard Yiddish _poyerim_ (cf. German Bauern), is actually
realized as _poyern,_ (with velar "eng" [n,], as it surely is in German,
too), except in Standard and, largely, Litvish Yiddish, which have led to
the "literalization" or reinterpretation of the suffix as _im_.

I'm not really sure how many words I can interpret this way but, my guess
is that Yiddish _shabosim_, _taleysim_, _doktoyrim_, _naronim_ have
undergone similar processes, starting out in Yiddish from *shAbesn
*tAlesn (neither _shabOsim_, nor _talEYsim_ occur in Hebrew), *nArn (has
anyone heard _narn_ used as the noun plural too?), *dOktern. (I imagine
that today, if we were to render the plural of _dokter_ with anything
other than _im, we'd say _dokters_.)

In each case, stress shift and vowel change probably have had something
to do with the transformation to -im. I'm afraid that's as far as I've
gone. I'd welcome anyone's attempt to explain this connection and take
the whole thing further (Neil?).

I wonder if anyone, working with early or Western Yiddish texts
(Marion?), has encountered documentary evidence of the starred (*) forms
("missing links") that I've posited above.
