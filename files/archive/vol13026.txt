Subject: Binem Heller

I am trying to locate the Yiddish poem by Binem Heller about khoydesh Nissen
in the Warsaw Ghetto.  Does anyone know of an anthology that contains this
powerful poem in Yiddish. And would there, by any chance, be an English
translation available?  Are there other poems by Heller available, also with
English translation?

Subject: Re: Judendeutsch/Juedischdeutsch

Heather Valencia asked about the meaning of "Judendeutsch" and whether this
has anything to do with Yiddish.  Let me say that although I have studied
this subject as an avocation, I am neither a trained linguist nor a
specialist in the history of the language or in Western Yiddish.  I hope
that Marion Aptroot, Mikhl Herzog, or one of the other scholars in this
subfield can give a fuller explanation here.

I recently read parts of _Zikhroynes mores Glikl Hamel_ in the original.  I
noticed that the language seemed very High German and that it was hard to
read for someone whose German is rusty and whose exposure to Western Yiddish
is limited to the dialect of Endingen-Lengnau, Switzerland.  I put out a
query on Mendele v.13.011 and Marion Aptroot gave me information on
literature dealing with the language of the Zikhroynes in v.13.012.  Right
away I noticed that A. Landau in "Die Sprache der Memoiren Glueckels von
Hameln" refers to the language as "Juedischdeutsch," not Yiddish.

Here are my thoughts.  There seems to have been a scholarly controversy
about whether there can be any relationship between the formalized "Yiddish"
of Eastern Europe and the language of the German Jews, which is referred to
by some writers as Judendeutsch or Juedischdeutsch. Years ago I read a
wonderful book, a dictionary, called _Die Reste des Juedischdeutschen_. Lots
of peculiar stuff, but there was a lot of vocabulary that seems very
consistent with "Western Yiddish".  Same with Glikl's Zikhroynes.  Anyway,
from what I can gather, there are some scholars who deny the term
Juedischdeutsch and insist that the language should be considered Yiddish.
There is some discussion of this in Mendele v.07.064 and v.07.066 under
heading "Judeo-Alsatian," where the difference in perspective is said to be
ideological.

To stir the pot further, Rachmiel Peltz, in an article on the internet that
I can no longer locate, said that the literary Yiddish of Germany was always
influenced by contemporary German -- this indeed goes some way to explaining
the presence of so much German in the Zikhroynes, assuming that Glikl was
writing in a literary dialect.

Conclusion: my "instincts" tell me that Glikl's language is very consistent,
in part, with the klal-shprakh but has forms reminiscent of High German that
are likely to puzzle nonscholars. I definitely think of it as Yiddish,
though. If anyone has written a good long article summarizing all the
linguistic, political-sociological, and cultural issues, with a synopsis of
the various controversies, with a scholarly chronology, it would help to
learn of its existence.

Anyone interested in hearing a sample of Alsatian Yiddish should go to

Subject: re: Judendeutsch

Thanks for Heather Valencia's comments. I'm very happy to read such high
praise for the Niborski-Vaisbrot dictionary!

An answer to her question about Amos Elon's book: when Elon writes
"Judendeutsch, a raw medieval German dialect mixed with Hebrew," he betrays
his ignorance of Yiddish in particular and of language in general. The
language that Mendelssohn knew was definitely Western Yiddish, not a mixture
that "permitted only the simplest exchanges." It is absurd to imply that a
grammar and morphology can be so primitive that communication is nearly
impossible. It's odd that in the 21st century, a respected author would
parrot the kind of anti-Jewish stereotype that was current in the late 18th
century and that has since been completely discredited. Not to mention that
characterizations like "raw ... dialect ... mixed ..." evince equal
ignorance.

I am posting this email for my mother-in-law like the good eydem that I am.
Please reply directly to marc_leclere@yahoo.com as well as the list server.

Many thanks.

At every seder my father would sing a song which I cannot find in the
Haggadah. There is a line of Hebrew and then a line of Yiddish. It is a song
describing the differences between idols and "undzer got: One of the lines
is "eygn hobn zey en ken nisht zen, okh und vey is tsu zey, a blindyak for
a got hobn zey, ober undzer got vos in himl ruht er, vos er vilt dos
tut er." Then the song goes on to the other parts of the body. Does anyone
know where I can find the Hebrew of this song?

Subject: Re: oyf'n hekhn barg

This song appears in a longer version in Chapter 25 of Mendele's (that is,
S.Y. Abramovitsh's) _Fishke der Krumer_, in which a pretty long and rather
satirical discussion of it appears. The song itself, I think (particularly
in light of the way Mendele frames it) is satirical in a way. The intent of
the song, it seems, is to poke fun at Jews who do not see danger when it is
standing right in front of them. The voice in the song presents the daytshn
mit di baytshn as if they are simply handsome young men, and goes on to
thank God for the whole scene in an absurdly happy-go-lucky way, foolishly
ignorant of any danger from men bearing sticks and whips when there aren't
any animals around. I don't know of a specific historical incident or source
of this song (or even if it predates Mendele's book-- I'd guess it does),
but I am reminded of another work by Mendele, a short story called "Shem un
Yafes in a Vagon," which deals with the expulsion of Jews and Poles from
German/Prussian territory.

Subject: Re: oyf'n hekhn barg

To Haviva Langenauer's query (Vol. 13.025): This song is given in full
length in Y.L. Cahan's collection of "Yiddish Folksongs with Melodies" under
Nr. 378. Ruth Rubin in "Voices of a People" (p. 56) has another version and
explains, this children song contains taunts leveled against apikorsim
(non-believers) and maskilim (freethinkers). The allusion to the "Germans"
and their "short clothes" reveals the struggle between religious orthodoxy
and the Maskilim, followers of the Enlightenment Movement (Haskala) and
their founder, Moses Mendelssohn.

Subject: re: shnorer

In connection with the recent discussion of the term 'shnorer', has Israel
Zangwill's wonderful mini-classic "The King of Schnorrers" been mentioned?

Published in London in 1894 and reprinted by Adama Books in 1987 with the
original illustrations by Gerge Hutchinson, it is most pertinent to the
ongoing discussion of the meaning  of 'shnoring' and 'shnorers'. We
especially recommend the hilarious 'mi-she-nodar' scene in Chapter 6.
