Subject: Place names

In regard to Meinhard E. Mayer's posting (Vol. 6.236):  the Italian
name for Munich is "Monaco di Baviera" (not Bavaria).  And while
hitching through Italy I often heard "Monaco di Germania."

His information about Czernowitz was very substantial--however the
Romanians still call that city "Cernauti" even if it's not the
official name forced by the dominant culture.  Again, the name depends
on the given language.  The province itself is called "Bukovine" or
(locally) "Bikivine" in Yiddish, and while Germans call it "Bukovina"
they sometimes resort to the Germanization "Buchenland" (land of the
beech trees)--especially during certain well-known eras.

In regard to the pronunciation of the French capital in another
posting, Yiddish normally pronounces the final consonant--though in
texts influenced by Russian you'll also find "Parizh" (as in Russian).

Subject: Place names

Despite Uzhgorod being so called for the last I don't know how many
years I have still to find an Uzhgoroder yid. They all come for
Ungvar.

Some of the names retained, especially by Chasidim, have, I suspect, a
lot to do with prestige rather than ignorance of local developments.

Take for example the Stanislover Rebe. Should he decide to be known as
the Ivano Frankover Rebbe, as the place is nowadays called, he'd have
all his khsidim heading for the exit. Nokh mer, ver volt zikh
meshadekh geveyn mit an Ivano Frankever aynikl?

A not too different reaction of voting with limbs more normally
associated with motion would be experienced in Klozenburg should the
Rebe experience a bout of Geographical correctness and rename himself
the Clujer Rebe.

In similar vain, pandemonium would break out if the elders of
Willamsburg were to adopt Joachim's Neugroschel's proposal and change
its name to Vilneburg. What would the Vilne Goen say to his name on
that bastion of khsides? And what about the khsidim? You'd sooner see
Baghdad renamed Albrightburg than khsidim renaming the Maye Sheorim
d'Brooklyn to the Yerisholayim d'Lite.

The phenomenon however is not exclusive to place names. Our dear
Diana, Princess of Wales, as she must now be known as part of her
ksibe settlement, is still referred to by our dear yidelekh as Lady
Diana. Ay since then she has been Princess Diana and then oys
Princees? A kashe of a mase.

And didn't Yankev ovini, lehavdil eylef havdoles, change his name, and
yet we still know him as Yankev. Even Avrohem, who changed his name
from Avrom, only made his new name stick thanks to an explicit
prohibition to refer to him by his old name.

And didn't our dear shames Noyekh, so called since unto him a child
was born (6.23? years ago, to be precise) sign himself Norman on the
very message he wrote 'place names die hard but we don't know why'.
Zol zikh ayner dervargn tsi zogen that the shames lacks a sense of
humour.

Farfaln, that's the way we are. Lech Walesa zol zikh iber kutsken in
Gdansk ober inzer zaydes kimn alts fin Dantsig; inzere zaydes zenn okh
aros fin mitsrayim in hobn gornisht gehat tsitin mit di egiptn;
Irritable Bowel Syndrome blabt bokh vaytig; Mental Health iz loy
olayni meshige in Yugoslavie vet shtentig zan Yugoslavie.

Subject: Polish "L" with a slash

With reference to the estimable Joachim Neugroschel's posting Vol
6.234) please allow me to add to the discussion concerning the
pronunciation of the Polish "L with a slash."  The original
pronuciation is similar to the Russian pronunciation of the "hard L."
This pronunciation is maintained today in Eastern Poland (eg. Bialystok
region) nd can be heard elsewhere in Poland, in particular from the
pre-war eneration, and that includes Yiddish speakers.

Currently, in central and western Poland one hears the same letter
pronounced as an English "W" and the Polish technical term for this
sound translates into something like "non-syllable-forming U."  It is
not the "soft L," but this "W" sound that replaced the "hard L" in all
words, including my birthplace, Lodz (incidentally, there are other
diacritical marks in this word that disappear in the English
transliteration and a discussion of that can take us well into the
spring!).

But even further along these lines,  I am not certain that
the resettlement strategies as described by Reb Neugroschel were most
responsible for this change.  The descriptive "repatriations," would
be better judged as a "westward jump," not a "westward push."  The
people in post-war eastern and central Poland remained pretty much in
place.  But the territories in the West, deserted by a population of
German origin that migrated to the "Vaterland," were secured by those
Poles who in turn were scrambling away from territories annexed by the
Soviet Union; and of course among those settlers were included Jews.
These settlers therefore brought with them their eastern pronunciation
of the "L with a slash" and logically should have had a determining
effect upon this pronunciation.... But interestingly enough, something
quite different seems to have happened: the "W" sound, present in the
Polish language before the war and referred to as "dialect L," took
over the original sound used in high Polish.  This process is
perfectly understandable if we realize that a majority of the Polish
intelligentsia was systematically exterminated by the Nazis; nor was
this process hindered by the Communists, who (surprise) did not take
kindly to the flaunting of one's noble or intellectual ancestry.  As a
result, most of the the educated Poles of today are inevitably of more
humble ancestry, which all told explains the transformation of this
particular paradigm from the colloquial into the standard (by the way,
a similar thing happened with the "H" and "CH" sounds in Polish).

[Would it be excessively stringent on the part of the shames to
suggest that with this (intelligent and informative) post we've
reached the Outer Limits Of What Constitutes A List About Yiddish? nm]
