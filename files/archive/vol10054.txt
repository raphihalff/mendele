Subject: New stories in Onkelos

Four new stories in modern Yiddish have been added to Onkelos:

Peretz's "oyb nisht mor hekher", transcribed by Morrie Heller.

Sholem-Aleykhem's "dreyfus in kasrilevke", transcribed by Berish
Goldstein.

Peretz's "mekubolim", transcribed by Benjamin Sadock.

Lamed Shapiro's "der rov un di rebitsin", transcribed by Alicia Ramos
Gonzalez.

http://www2.trincoll.edu/~mendele/onkelos.htm.

And coming soon: Lamed Shapiro's "gegesene teg", transcribed by Jan
Jonk.

An English translation of these stories, as with the others in Onkelos,

Subject: Levi Yitzchak's kaddish

To Larry Rosenwalds query about Levi Yitzchak's kaddish, an excellent
source Chaim Kotylansky?s "Folks-Gezangen" Los Angeles 1944, with text,
translation, explanatory notes in yiddish and english and piano
arrangements. Here the text of the song, which is originally called: "A
Din Toire mit Got"

A gut morgn dir, riboinoi shel oilom
ich, Leivi Itzchok ben Sore m?Barrditshev,
bin gekumen tzu dir mit a din toire fun dain folk yisroeil
vos hostu zich ongezetzt oif dain folk yisroeil?
az vu nor epes a hor, iz - "dabeir el b?nei yisroeil"
un vu nor epes a zach, iz - "tzav es b?nnei yisroeil"
un vu nor epes a rir, iz - "emoir el b?nei yisroeil"
tatenyu ziser in himl! kamo umois yesh booilom:
modayim, parsayim, bavlayim,
di Ruslener vos zogn? - az zeier keiser iz keiser
un di Daitshlender vos zogn? - az zeier malchus iz malchus
un di Englender vos zogn? - az zeier kenig iz kenig
un ich, Leivi Itzchok ben Sore m?Barditshev, zog:
"Hamelech hayoisheiv al kisei rom v?niso"
un ich, Leivi Itzchok ben Sore m?Barditshev,

loi ozuz poi mimkoimi - ich vel mich fun main ort nisht rirn
un a sof zol dos nemen! un an?ek zol dos nemen!
Hamelech hayoisheiv al kisei rom v?niso"

You should note that "ch" is always to read as "kh".

Subject: Weinreich quote and Yiddish in Czech literature

 I was very glad to have the reference for the Weinreich quote - I did
not realize that it had appeared in print. Thanks!

 On the matter of how much Yiddish was known/used by Czech Jews in the
early 20th century, the short stories of the Czech-Jewish writer Karel
Polacek are informative. I recall one story that uses a number of
Yiddish words, mostly of Hebrew origin (e.g., names of holidays), but
not only. I could provide specific references if necessary.

This year's week-long retreat, where we strive to speak only Yiddish,
will be held THURSDAY, AUGUST 23 through WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 29, 2001, at
the Berkshire Hills Emanuel Adult Vacation Center in Copake, New York.
The goal of Yugntruf, Youth for Yiddish, is to provide the younger
generation and the older with opportunities for Yiddish immersion.
Participants in the yidish-vokh are singles, couples and
Yiddish-speaking families, with work-study discounts for students.
Seniors are also welcome. There's a swimming pool and a beautiful lake.
All activities are in Yiddish, including sports, folk-dancing, yoga,
lectures, discussions, literary readings, campfire singing, talent show,

concerts, films, Yiddish classes for the advanced beginner and organized

programs for children. The food is kosher, with vegetarian options.  On
shabes, services will be available.

The yidish-vokh is a real community, in which our members give the
lectures, lead discussions and workshops.  Our members include
professors, activists, writers and musicians who share their knowledge,
talent and love of mame-loshn.  Many at the yidish-vokh have made
lifelong friends; some have married each other and now return every
summer!

TO REGISTER - Return application with FULL PAYMENT (payable to Yugntruf,

in US dollars) by June 29.

Subject: Gender-neutral names

With regard to the question on gender-neutral names, in my translation
of the Dereczin Memorial Book, I encountered the "Last Will & Testament
of Simkheh die Kremerkeh." Clearly a female storekeeper named Simkheh.

Subject: Gender-neutral names

Re Yankev Lewis's posting [10.052] concerning "gender-neutral" names in
Yiddish, specifically the Berl in Frume-Berl.  Alexander Beider's
forthcoming book, "A Dictionary of Ashkenazic Given Names," sheds light
on that particular name.  According to Beider, the feminine name Berl
derives from Perle (and not from the masculine name Ber, which has a
different etymology).  In his entry for Perle he cites German Jewish
sources for Berl (or Berle) dating back to the 14th century, claiming
that "the forms starting with _Ber-_ are unknown outside of Germany."
Depending on the geographic origins of the Frume-Berl in question,
Beider may wish to revise this particular statement.

"A Dictionary of Ashkenazic Given Names" is scheduled to be published by

Avotaynu (a publisher of genealogical books in Bergenfield, NJ).  I have

been granted a sneak preview and in my opinion it is an absolutely
prodigious work of scholarship.

From: "Donn O'Meara" <donnom@netvision.net.il>
Subject: Gender-neutral names

In answer to the recent communication in "Mendele" regarding
gender-neutral names [10.052], the two examples mentioned are quite
peculiar in nature, but well-defined. In brief, Yona (Yoine) is always a

man's name among Ashkenazim and always a woman's among Sephardim. I say
"always" only because I don't know of any cases to the contrary: the two

that you cite should be looked into from that perspective.Of course
there is a sort of explanation which may explain its use among
Ashkenazim: Yona is the prophet's name, all right, but it also means
"dove". In other words two separate names are involved.  The case of
Simcha is similar: it is an Ashkenazi man's name but a Sephardi woman's
name. But here no such ambiguity is involved.

As for "Frume-Berl", I wonder if somewhere along the line this wasn't
intended to be Frume-Perl. I have real difficulty in believing that
Berl, which is a diminutive of Ber (Dov) could really be applied to a
woman, unless, perhaps, her English name is Beryl and it was somehow
combined with the Jewish name Frume (Pia or Chasida).

There is a parallel in other languages: Carmen, a common man's name in
Italian is always, as far as I know, only a woman's name in Spanish (my
home language). In the latter language it is short for Mar?del Carmen
the explanation of its use in Italian, I don^? know. The same holds
for Evelyn which is fairly common among men in England, but I know of no

case in the United States. Carol and Robin, on the other hand are
genuinely gender-neutral names on both sides of the ocean, though far
less in the States than in England. Florence is gender-neutral but only
among the Irish.

In Yiddish the nearest thing to a gender-neutral name I can think of is
Nuche, which is spelled with a "chaf" for women and a "ches" for men and

represents in reality two quite distinct names (Menuche and Menachem)
even if they are pronounced the same in the apocopated form.

With regards,

Mechl Asheri

Subject: Journal "National Identities," calls for
papers/articles/reviews

CALL FOR PAPERS for the journal "National Identities".

'National Identities' is a scholarly, peer-reviewed journal that appears

three times a year. It focusses upon national identities and their
relationship between territory, political structures and cultural
traditions. We believe that national identities are primarily
constructed and are not confined to what is called the nation as it is
understood in the Western world since the late c18th. We encourage
scholars from various disciplines to explore the ways social, political
and regional groups constructed their identities, to what aims and how
these identity constructions and images have changed through time.
