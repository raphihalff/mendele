Another note on the question of v and w. The same problem exists for
native Hebrew speakers. I once asked a taxi driver in Jerusalem to take me
to Woolworth Street and he had a terrible time with that word- exclaiming
about why they would put two such awful w sounds into one word, which to
him came out "vulvitsh" -- of course th not existing in either Yiddish or
Hebrew either.

Subject: Pronunciation reversals

While grazing in the pasture, I have been prodded by Ellen Prince,
who, along with Rick Turkel and Sam Weiss (Vol. 7.001), has responded
to Marjorie Hirshan's question about Yiddish speakers' tendency to
swap English /v/ and /w/ in speech.

Sam's story is a funny example of insufficiently dynamic phonetic
instruction.

Ellen and Rick have clearly presented the linguistic (phonological)
situation, namely, one of a contrast in English--/w/:/v/--that is
irrelevant in Yiddish and, for that matter, in many languages that
come to mind. Depending on many variables, a given Yiddish speaker may
have more or less interference in his English from his Yiddish. If he
does learn to pronounce a labio-velar glide [w], in addition to his
native labio-dental voiced fricative [v}, which will surely do in
English too, he may not always remember what English words each one
belongs in. If he gets it right, he is not noticed. If he gets it
wrong, he is heard by English-speakers to have committed a
"pronunciation reversal." This is essentially what Ellen has offered
in her second suggestion. Rick seems to suspect that our Yiddish
speaker may indeed favor [w] variants as more "English." There may be
something to that; I have seen no frequency counts in the matter.

Ellen's other suggestion is phonetically tantalizing. She writes, " I
believe this is a case of where what they are in fact saying is
phonetically *between* English/v/ and /w/ and it is we, the native
English listeners, that assign it to the wrong category since we
(given our sound system) figure it has to be one or the other and it
doesn't sound like the one it's supposed to be." That is, Ellen seems
to think the speakers are pronouncing something like a bilabial voiced
fricative that varies sporadically in the intensity of the fricative
turbulence, as attested for varieties of Spanish. In the abstract,
this has the ring of phonetic and perceptual plausibility; however, my
own observations of this kind of speech behavior make this explanation
dubious for Yiddish speakers. Rather,  Ellen's other suggestion,
perhaps as amended by Rick, and summarized by me above, is probably
the answer.

Here is a short story of how I was taken in by this kind of Yiddish
interference. About 35 years ago, when I was living in Greater
Metropolitan New York, an aunt of mine asked me to drive her from
Manhattan to visit her niece--my cousin--in Far Rockaway, Queens. Aunt
Minnie was a native-born American, my cousin, an immigrant from
Ukraine long resident in the U.S.

Aunt Minnie had road directions. We were to go through the
Queens-Midtown Tunnel and then take the Wenvick Expressway to a
certain exit. "Well," said I, "I don't know where the Wenvick
Expressway is, but we'll ask at the toll booth."

The toll-taker had never heard of the Wenwick Expressway either, but
he knew far more about the highways of Queens than I. After pondering
for a moment, he exclaimed, "Do you mean the Van Wyck?" It then dawned
on me that in her perfectly normal sounding native English, my aunt
had fallen victim to two sources of Yiddish interference in my
cousin's speech:(1) the lack of a contrast between /w/ and /v/ and (2)
the lack of contrast between the two English vowels /E/ and /ae/, as
in "bet" and "bat" or "den" and "Dan." Note: At that time at least the
popular pronunciation of Van Wyck treated the second word as "wick"
rather than the older pronunciation, "wike."

Subject: "Big"

Here's an update on the "big" issue.  It seems that the Forward's
usage is not as original as we thought, according to the Dictionary of
American Slang, Vol. 1 (A-G):

Big. n 1. Big Shot.
1948. Lait and Mortimer New York 121: "(Street gang) war counsellors (are)
known as "bigs."

Subject: Jewish folklore from Ukraine

Some time ago, I believe, I reported on the large collection of wax
cylinder recordings in the possession of the V. I.  Vernadsky Library,
in Kiev.  These recordings were made by Jewish ethnographers during
various expeditions in search of folkloristic material in cities and
towns in the Ukraine (especially Podolia and Volhynia) and Belarus.
On Friday (May 16th) I received a flyer describing the recordings and
the work that has been done to transfer them into other sound media.
A CD has also been prepared, including a selection of 41 items from
the Vernadsky collection. Here is an extensive excerpt from the flyer
(minor grammatical and spelling adjustments have been made):

"The National Library of Ukraine stores the world's greatest Jewish
musical folklore collection recorded on Edison phonograph cylinders.
The collection contains more than 1000 cylinders with sound duration
from 2 to 7 minutes.  This collection includes in fact all the records
made in the first half of the 20th century (from 1912 till 1947) on
the territories of Ukraine and Belarus in towns and boroughs with
traditionally numerous Jewish populations....

"The collection was initiated by the Jewish Historical/Ethnographic
Society in Petersburg in 1911-1914...  The idea of conducting the
[folklore] expeditions belonged to a well-known Jewish writer and
folklorist S. An-sky (1863-1920), and they were financed from the
funds of the patron G. O. Ginzburg [=Guenzburg].  Besides S. An-sky,
other outstanding representatives of Jewish culture participated in
these expeditions in different years:  composer and music expert
J[oel] Engel (1867-1927), folklorist Z[inovy] Kisselhof [=Kisselgoff]
(1878-1939), artist S[olomon] Judovin [=Yudovin] (1892-1954) et al.
During 1912-1913... the expedition managed to visit and research
ethnographically Volyn and Podiliya, its participants were able to
record on the phonograph the enormous... amount of various genres of
traditional music samples: wordless chants, instrumental plays, songs,
parts of synagogal liturgy....

".... The phonograph materials collection became one of the principal
Jewish Historical/Ethnographic Museum collections opened in Petersburg
in 1914.

"In Soviet times the Cabinet of Musical Folklore of the Ethnographical
Section of the Institute of Jewish Culture in Kyiv became the carrier
of the pre-Revolutionary folklorist traditions beginning from 1912.
At the Cabinet the individual phonogram archives were organized and
constantly enriched with materials of every new folklore expedition.

"The outstanding folklorist scholar M[oyshe] L. Beregovsky stood at
the beginning of the phonogram archives' establishment.  Owing to his
efforts the Cabinet expedition work became wide-ranged and regular,
and the recording and deciphering of material, their documenting still
strike the modern researchers with their high level of scientific
approach to the expedition work.  The known centres of Jewish culture
(Kyiv, Odessa) were in the field of vision of Beregovsky and his
colleagues as well as the separate places of Jewish residence in Volyn
and Podiliya, Western Ukraine... with its historically formed specific
feature (e.g., agricultural Jewish colonies of South Ukraine).

"In 1930 the phonoarchives of the Petersburg Jewish Historical/
Ethnographic Museum were handed over to Kyiv and they essentially
supplemented the collection of the Ethnographic Section of the
Institute of Jewish Culture.

"Approximately at that time J. Engel's daughter passed to Kyiv a
collection of phonocylinders which showed J. Engel's participation in
S. An-sky's expeditions.  Later, in 1940, the phonogram archives of
the Cabinet of Jewish Culture (in 1936, the Institute of Jewish
Culture [was] transformed into the Cabinet) were essentially
supplemented once again: the materials of Z. Kisselhof's private
collection were handed over by the late folklorist's daughter Antonina
Kisselhof.  For a long time the phonoarchives were not in scientific
and cultural usage as the way of sound reproduction from the wax
cylinders [i.e., it was not technically possible to transfer their
contents to another medium -- ZB].

"The efforts in rerecording the cylinders were initiated in November
1995 by Professor O. Onyshchenko, Director of the V. I. Vernadsky
National Library, and Professor V. Petrov, Director of the Institute
for Information Recording, and unique results were received in the
shortest time.

"The Institute for Information Recording developed the original method
of cylinders rerecording which allowed [it] to take the sound by...
not destroy[ing] their physical state."

The following e-mail address is given for the Institute for
Information Recording in Kiev:  petrov@ipri.kiev.ua  (URL:
