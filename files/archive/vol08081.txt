Subject: Translating Yiddish Poetry

Leah Zazulyer raises an issue (08.075) that is of great interest to me and
on which I have spoken publicly. (I had planned to discuss the subject at
this summer's conference of the International Association of Yiddish Clubs,
but bureaucracy intervened.) 

It is not--and should not be--a matter of "either/or." Rhyme, rhyme pattern
and meter are vital, not only in translating song lyrics, but in rendering
all Yiddish poetry into English. Of course, some celebrated writers who
take
flings at translating Yiddish poetry don't deign to bother with the poets'
genius in conveying poetic ideas in strict rhyme and meter. They, the
famous- name, now and again translators, are convinced that they know
better
than, say, Perets or Reyzin or Itsik Manger. 

This does not in any way diminish the need to translate, as well, the "other
poetic aspects" that Leah Zazulyer listed, "such as 'voice', 'tone',
assonance, form or structure, and formality or informality of language..."
All of it is important. No aspect can be slighted without doing violence to
the original and, as a result, leaving the English reader uninformed about
the full genius of Yiddish poetry. 

I'm not sure that the problem stems only or mainly from "Victorian" attempts
to "elevate" Yiddish poets and their work. I'm afraid that what's often at
work is a cavalier attitude or just plain laziness. It's not easy to render
Yiddish poetry in its original form while transmitting the other listed
characteristics. It takes a lot of blood, sweat and tears. More, perhaps,
than many translators are willing to commit.

This relates, too, to the matter of cost. A leading research institution
whose endowment is beyond legendary recently sought a translation of a
Yiddish literary work. The original Yiddish text was printed in prose form
but is composed entirely of delightful rhymed, rythmic verses. Offered three
options--a prose translation at relatively low cost; one that would preserve
meaning and meter while not straining for rhyme, at somewhat higher cost;
or
the far greater time (and cost) consuming effort to render the work
faithfully--the world renowned and fabulously wealthy institution went the
cheapest route. 

I'd be interested to learn the opinions of other Mendelyaner on the issues
involved in Yiddish poetry translation.

Shalom.

Can anyone give me information about a Yiddish song which has the
words "vos
bistu ketseleh broigez".  Where can I find the complete set of words?

Subject: bandura

This is for Itsik Goldenberg who enquired about the meaning of "bandura."
The bandura was and still is a plectrum instrument played in the regions of
Bukowina, Bessarabia, and Moldalvia, Rumania. It looks somwething like a
lute with its body round in shape and the neck bent at a 90 degree angle.
Klezmorim from this region use to perform on this instrument, along with
Rom
(Gypsies)  and Ukranians. It is actually a Ukranian folk instrument still
used. Today you would be hard pressed to find people playing then
bandura in
Romania. Mostly in Ukraine. In Romania the cobza was similar to the
bandura
and also used by klezmorim prior-to WW Two. When one thinks of a
klezmer
kapelye rarely does one think of plectrum instruments being used outside
of
the mandolin.

Last October 14, at the packed hall of the Buenos Aires Psichoanalytical
Association (APdeBA), was presented the book "Cuentos y Chistes Judios"
(Jewish stories and jokes) written in spanish by Dr. Cesar Forster with a
foreword of the IWO (YIVO) director Abraham Lichtenbaum. The author, a
renown psychoanalyst, gathered in the last fifty years a large row of jokes
which are written with taste and talent. This is the third book published
this year by the IWO. And there is a fourth one in press! 

More news: If someone thinks that Dzigan and Schumacher are only dear
memories form the past.. is wrong! Both are alive and kicking at the IWO
hall, 483 Ayacucho St., Buenos Aires, Argentina!  Normal Erlich and Luis
Minces, two local actors with a "schmaltzy" yiddish, are performing with
great success, some of the original monologues and duets of Dzigan and
Schumacher. The show, named "Aby men zet zikh" (nice to see each
other) is
completed with the performance of Cesar Beleny (an outstanding singer)
and
the pianist Nestor Stofblat. People split their sides laughing from
beginning to end and, why not, shed also some tears...

I like to share with you a short poetic note, written many years ago I still
remember and recite it often in my Yiddish class.

Dem 22stn October iz arayn tsvishn Mendele e-briv  di onfrages fun Dovid

oysgerekhnte fregzatsn zaynen rikhtike oyf mame-loshn:
"Tsi hostu haynt gezen Shloymen?"; "Efsher hostu haynt gezen
Shloymen?" "
Hostu haynt gezen Shloymen?"

Vos shaykh deklerative zatsn, iz es an AYZERNER KLAL az di tsveyte
pozitsye in a zats (d"h di tsveyte pozitsye nisht DOS tsveyte vort"
farnemt der konyugirter verb: (1) DER GUTER ZUN  (2)KUMT (3)ALE

ZUN (4) ZEN
(5) ZAYNE ELTERN, ad"gl. In beyde faln farnemt der teil funem verb vos
vert konyugirt di tsveyte pozitsye.

On the 22nd of October, we received Mendele e-mail with David
Hershkowitz's inquiry whether he expressed himself properly in the
imperative by saying: "nem es nisht tsu fun im" and whether "nem es fun
im nisht tsu" would have been equally correct.  I believe that both are
correct Yiddish commands.

He also asked whether anyone could explain the basic rule for Yiddish
sentence structure.  I will  attempt to hurriedly answer. (A) In
declarative sentences N.P.-- NOUN PHRASES (noun and modifiers) OR
OTHER
UNITS EXCEPT THE INFLECTED PART OF THE VERB are allowed, but
only one
must be chosen (subject noun, subject pronoun, adverb/ial phrase,or 
indirect object).  N.U.W. (non-unit words) can preceed the N.P. (ober -
but, oder - or,  az/oyb - if, un - and, vayl - because, to - so; khotsch
- despite/though). (B)  THE SECOND POSITION TAKES THE VERB
PHRASE --a)
THE INFLECTED VERB, AUXILLIARY VERB OR MODALS -- THAT'S AN
IRON RULE;  b)
optional: nagating verb, pronoun, subject. adverb, direct object,
indirect object. (C) V.N.I. - VERB NON INFLECTED - In senctences
containing in addition to the inflected verb, an uninflected part, past
participle or infinitive, sentence units may be place between the two
parts of the verb and after the uninflected part.  (4) N. P. OTHER
INFINITIVES, OBJECT NOUN AND PHRASES, PREDICATED NOUNS
AND ADJECTIVES,
ADVERBIAL AND PREPOSITIONAL PHRASES, CLAUSES.
    
I believe that although some linguists tried to make a rule that in
inquiring sentences the verb also takes the second position, I believe
that it is not always so.
