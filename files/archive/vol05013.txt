Subject: A Sholem-Aleykhem Series: Three

English translation from the Yiddish of _Nekrolog_ by Sholem-Aleykhem

Obituary: The Jewish People's Paper is has died.

Alexander Zederbaum became father to a child, born on Thursday, Oct. 1
(Old Style), 13 (New Style), 1881 in St. Petersburg.  He named the
newborn "The Jewish People's Paper."  This child developed in a normal
way, was properly weaned and reared, and packed off to Jewish school.  It
was brought up with care so as to be accepted among decent people.  The
child thrived very well indeed.  Connoisseurs foretold that the child
would in time be surely seen fit to join the respectable crowd.  It
learned its lessons and played along with friends as they grew up
together.  The first friend was Motl Spector, and the other was
Sholem-Aleykhem.  They matured together, got married, and today, thank
God, they themselves have children, long may they live.  With these two
friends the "Jewish People's Paper" felt so intimately at home that it
seemed impossible that they should ever go their separate ways.  But if
God does not wish it, no bright ideas can help.  Fate decreed a
misfortune: namely, that Mr. Zederbaum should get together with some
hapless litvak, a fine rascal, a seasoned veteran of all kinds of
devilment.  The Litvak came to like the child, so he hung around for as
long as it took for the child to fall into his own hands.  And then he
took to bringing up the child according to some newfangled fashion, of
all things.  He began to interfere with the child's speech, and feed it
such tidbits that the child could not digest until cramps plagued its
poor belly, and it became sick (it shouldn't happen to any child) with
consumption.  When one of the friends championed the child's cause, the
Litvak (the devil take him) became arrogant, overbearing, basely
insulted everybody, cursed each and every one as they do at the fish
market, quarreled like a crude drayman, and bragged that he did not have
to listen to anybody.  "Who cares what anyone says!" he told the child.
"You speak the way I tell you!"

[I can't really translate the next passage.  It describes the "litvak's"
orders to "the child" to substitute good, ordinary Yiddish words with
outlandish orthography, or Hebrew expressions meant to be high-falutin'
but which emerge as pretentious twaddle.  For example, "the Litvak"
substitutes "died" with a Hebrew expression that seems to mean "left its
life to all who live" or some such thing.]

And the child, alas, twisted its tongue as it repeated the Litvak's every
word.  The Litvak (may he never find a place of rest) brought in new
friends for the child to cause it shame before the whole world.  For
example, he brought in Shomer himself and other fine youngsters who
crippled the child, made it dirty and ugly so that even Frug himself (who
often used to keep busy singing extraordinary, fine songs to the child)
could not help it.  And so the child was ruined. In the meantime, a
deadly quarrel broke out between Zederbaum and Litvak (may he never come
to mind).  Zederbaum argued, "Give me back my child. Enough already,
litvak, playing nursemaid with it."  And the Litvak (may his name be
erased) shouted, "No!  Absolutely not!  The child is with me. It's mine.
I have it from you in writing!  If not to me, then not to you.  Who cares
about the child!  Good riddance. Victory is sweeter!!"  Back and forth
went the lawsuits between them, and the child, alas, as usual, was
suffocated between yea and nay.  Its years on earth ran out a year ago
just at this time, summer 5651.  And so the "Jewish People's Paper" _left
its life to all who live_, that is, in our plain language, simply died.
May its paradise be bright having suffered enough in this world.  God
grant that it will soon be reincarnated on this sinful earth, and we
should have the honor to see it healthy and strong in every limb, and have
long life.  Amen.

[Israel Levy, the eccentric publisher, half maskil, half mystic
(according to Dubnow) moved to Vilkomir (now Ukmerge) eventually and died
in obscurity.]
