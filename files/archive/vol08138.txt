Subject: alkes

Al Grand asked about _alkes_:

There is a slavic word "galkes" which is probably the origin of this word. 
It means little spheres, or balls.

Subject: alkes

If Al Grand had read the term "halke"  instead of "alke" its meaning
would
have been immediately obvious.  In soup or elsewhere a "halke" is
recognizable as a ball of something- be it meat or matzoh meal or in the
case at hand snow. Oh for the tam of some of Bubbe's halkes!

Subject: alkes

Dear Mendele, 

This is in response to Al Grand who asks about "alke."My knowledge of
"alke"
is that it is food. It is similar to a "Knaidel" (matzo ball). My mother A"H
made a mixture similar to a "Knaidel" recipe and put it in the "cholent"
and
called it an "alke." Perhaps the author was alluding to the
"alke"-"Knaidel"
being as light as snow.

Subject: nitl

Some time back,there was a posting on Yiddish words with no Hebrew
equivalents.  One of these was "nitl."  The posted defined it as "the
custom
of not studying Torah on Christmas."  As I had never heard of this
custom, I
asked about it on mail.jewish, a halachic and Orthodox mailing list.
Every
respondent agreed that the word simply meant "Christmas," not the
aforementioned custom.  The word derives from "natal," birth,
ultimately
from the Latin "dies natalis," or birthday (referring, of course, to
you-know-whose).  Christmas Eve is "nitlnacht."

Subject: Norman Salsitz's "Against All Odds."

In Mendele Vol 08.135 Norma Breuer asks, among other things, about
Norman
Salsitz's "Against All Odds." 
  
I don't remember the original posting that stimulated her query, but
she
seems to be under the impression that it is a new book. Here is the
bibliographic information: 

Salsitz, Norman & Salsits, Amalie Petranker (1990). New York:
Holocaust
Library. $24.95. 
  
Here is the address of the Holocaust Library:
216 West 19th Street
New York, NY 10011, U.S.A.
Telephone: (212) 463-7988

Subject: Paris and Vienna

If you wanna read a fabulously entertaining book, get hold of the recent
edition of PARIS AND VIENNA, a wild sixteenth-century Yiddish epic
probably
by our very own Elia Levita, who brought us the BOVE-BUKH.  I haven't
seen
the Israeli edition of PARIS AND VIENNA, but the (overpriced)  German
edition is wonderful.  It contains the entire text (in German
romanization)
plus a 130-page intro by Erika Timm, who provides rich data and
provocative
analyses.  You must, alas, know Middle High German to fully appreciate
the
fun and frolic of PARIS AND VIENNA--unless you already know medieval
Yiddish.  But it's worth the trouble!  The scholarship is very thorough
and
the epic itself is the best teen-age romance since Mary got a visit from
the
Holy Ghost. 
        
Let's give it up for PARIS and his lady-love VIENNA!  May all our lives be
as adventurous and romantic!!!!
