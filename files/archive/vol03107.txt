Not surprising really. The mishna refers to "yom tov shel rosh hashono ..."

We have always used the greeting @gut yontef@ on yom kiper. By the way we also
 say @gut yontef@ on motze yom kiper (see Siddur of R. Yaacov Emden and others)

Subject: Vegn zikh

I am currently finishing up my BFA in composition at SUNY Purchase,
but have been fascinated by languages and linguistics for as long as
I can remember. Unfortunately, my Yiddish is not as good as I'd like
it to be (though I can usually read it -- I speak decent German),
but I hope this will change...at any rate, I'm excited to be on this
list, and, well, don't know what else to say for now...

Subject: Re: shmues

When a conversation with friends a little while ago got around to
shmuesn< schmusen, a dictionary of Viennese dialect was checked and
it recognized not on ly shemuot (Heb)> shmusen (Yid)> Schmusen, but
also connected the Viennese (!) term Shmonzes to the same
development. Mishnah R.H. 4.1 (and another place that I forget at
the moment) calls Rosh ha-Shanah a "yom tob."

Subject: greetings

Since this is the season of greatings, let me add the following
episode. In a recent personal letter a colleague of mine, Professor
of English, wrote mazel tov, intending to wish me good luck (by its
location in the letter the expression was certainly not meant to say
`congratulations'. I recall having read the same mistaken usage,
with the same spelling, in John Le Carre's `little drummer girl'.
Ring a bell with anyone?

Subject: Shas?

Tayere Mendelnikes:

Recently, I was reading Bashevis and came across the acronym "Shas"
(shin"samekh).  I've seen this before and know that it refers to the
Talmud, but I'd like to know what two words (or more) the acronym
stands for.  Neither Stutchkoff nor Weinreich give any clues.  Any
insightful info would be appreciated.

Gut yontif, gut yor,  tikhotaivu ukhasime toyve,

E. Portnoy
