At last Mendele is ready to go public.  We have as of
today a total of 22 subscribers (list on demand) and
a very good roster it is.  And while we're neither in
Czernowitz or Vilna we may in at the start of something
that none of might have thought possible 10 years ago.
Let us hope so.

A word about my role.  I'm the shammes.  That means that
everybody can (and should) offer advice, criticism, help.
The only thing I ask of you is that you contribute regu-
larly and often.

Please direct contributions to: mendele@trincc.bitnet

I am presently trying to decifer a number of letters
written from Sedalia, Miss ouri around 1891 IN YIDDISH! 
The letters were kindly lent to me by the great-g
randson of their author.  Several years ago a rabbi in
Kansas city was asked to translate the letters, which
he did quite well.  He also transcribed them in ro man
characters, though interestingly enough this proved to
more of an (unconcio us) translation into his own
dialect of Yiddish than a transliteraton.  
At any rate, the hard part is not understanding the
letters but decifering them  and interpreting the
vowels and diphthongs.  There is no telling a vov from
a yud or often an alef fron tsvey vovn etc. Spelling is
also very inconsistent an d there is no punctuation. 
As a result I have no idea of the actual phonetic v
alues represented by the graphemes for the vowels.  For
this reason, in the fol lowing excerpt I will not try
to interpret the the value of the vowels, but wi ll
represent them as follows: alef: ' , vov: u, yud: y,
ayen: e. Tsvey vovn, ho wever is "v" to make reading a
bit easier.  The consonants are plain old YIVO. I hope
this hastily conceived scheme doesn't cause too much
eye strain.

I would be interested in any comments regarding the
language of this excerpt or  anything else.  (I'm not
familiar with manuscripts from this period. Is the
spelling always this erratic?)  Thanks for your help.

Mr. Eshelman, some comments on your text. Forgive me if
I dwell on things that are obvious to you. Some of us
are in the business of being pedantic. (I'm copying
this to "Mendele", by the way. You can "forward" to
"Dave".)
 
     The spelling in your document is not really
erratic although I can see why you think so. The key to
it lies in what you describe when you say that "there
is no telling a vov from a yud". This reveals, first
and foremost, that the writer's native speech is
DECIDEDLY NOT northeastern: it has merged all the
historical u-sounds (represented by vov in the Standard
language) and i-sounds (represented by yud). ALL of
them are realised as "i"; thus singular "bruder" and
plural "brider" are alike: "brider". The writer's
attempt to differentiate them in writing leads to
hypercorrection (writing vov where one would expect
yud, and vice versa) We find spellings like "kund" for
"kind", "funger" for "fingerr", etc. It's a common
feature of 19th century manuscripts (and even of
published works) in Poland and the Ukraine. One puzzle,
though, the name of the town. I'm surprised to see the
substitution of vov for initial SEMI-VOCALIC yud (as
the name Janow would imply).
 
     Let me draw your attention to two other features
of the writer's speech which the spelling reveals:
 
1)  'yyte (= hayte 'today') and 'andlyn (= handlen 'to
trade') suggest that he "drops" his aiches; this is
regionally distinctive.
 
2) tsyytn t'g (= tsveytn tog  'the second day'), in
which the "v" is lost, is also regionally distinctive;
essentially the same region, though.
 
     Now then, both features ARE TOTALLY consistent
with part of the area in which the u's and i's have
merged in "i". and, from its location, Janow does seem
to be a good candidate for the cooccurrence of all
three.
 
     There is definitely more, but other duties beckon. 

     One more comment, to close. I don't think that the
grammar is heavily influenced by German. I see only one
really German grammatical form "k'm" (= the preterite
"kam" 'came'). The others all seem to be
"Germanizations" (stylistic affectations) of spelling,
mainly, in such cases as "'nd" (und for un), "bryev"
(for briv)  and in the form of some words "h'be" (=
habe for hob) and "'yyte" (= ? German "heute"? No!
"Yiddishized" "ayte" (and without the aich, yet!).
These are better designated as "daytshmerish" not as
"daytsh" (= German). Are you familiar with the concept?
See Mordkhe Schaecter's "The Hidden Standard" (and
accompanying bibliography) in THE FIELD OF YIDDISH,
Vol. 3 (1969). OK?

i'd be very grateful if those subscribers who consider
themselves native in yiddish would translate the
following. please send your answers to me at
ellen@central.cis.upenn.edu. a hartsikn dank! 

1. a child was born every hour.
2. two people live in each house.
3. i went to a few funerals in each city.
4. i meet someone i know wherever i go.
5. all that glitters is not gold. (i'd like a literal
translation--it doesn't    have to be a proverb in
yiddish.)
6. no news is good news. (again, a literal translation,
please.) 7. everybody isn't as smart as you, you know.
8. everyone died in each battle.

A few little answers. By the way, you surely know the
one about the field-worker learning an Amerind
language. "Can you say XX?" "Yep". "Can you say YY?""
"Yep". "Can you say ZZ?" "Yep". "By the way, what does
it (XX, YY, ZZ) mean"? "It don't mean nuthin!" SO . . .
 
1. A child is born every hour.
i) ale sho vert gebo(y)rn a kind.
ii) yede(r) sho vert gebo(y)rn a kind. ("yeder" can be
treated as an invariant")
iii) a kind vert gebo(y)rn ale sho
iv) es vert a kind gebo(y)rn ale sho
 
alongside of iii, could you also say:
 
v) a kind vert geboyrn yeder sho.  ?   YES
 
also, does iii mean exactly the same thing as i, ii,
and iv? I THINK SO.
 
2. Two people live in each house.
i) in yeder/yedn hoyz vojnt men zalbetsveyt
   in yeder shtub vojnt men zalbetsveyt
ii)in yeder, etc. voynt men in tsveyen
iii) in yeder, etc. voynen tsvey/voynen tsvey
mentshn/voynen tsvey ire.
 
is it possible to say iv:
 
iv) tsvey mentshn voynen in yeder/yedn hoyz/shtub.  ? 
YES  
3) I went to a few funerals in each city.
in yeder shtot bin ix gegangen/geven af/oyf etlekhe
levayes  
is it possible to say also:
 
ikh bin gegangen/geven af/oyf etlekhe levayes in yeder
shtot.  ? YES
 
4) I meet someone I know wherever I go.
i) vu nor ikh gey, bagegn ikh/tref ikh emetsn vos ikh
ken ii) vu ikh zol nit geyn, bagegn ikh/tref ikh emetsn
vos ikh ken  
is it possible to say also:
 
ikh bagegn/tref emetsn vos ikh ken vu nor ikh gey/vu
ikh zol nit geyn.  ?  YES, WITH AN INTONATIONAL ASSIST
 
5) All that glitters is not gold.
 
ni(sh)t alts vos finklt iz gold
 
is it possible to say also:
alts vos finklt iz ni(sh)t gold.   ?  YES, BUT IT DON'T
FEEL SO GOOD.
 
6) No news is good news.
i) az siz ni(sh)to keyn nayes iz dos aleyn a gute bsure
ii) az siz ni(sh)to keyn nayes iz dos aleyn a gute
yedie  
(Is that what you mean by literal?)
 
no, that's a proverb. i mean literal-er. IF IT"SD A
PROVERB, I MADE IT UP. I'M NOT SURE I KNOW ANOTHER REAL
POSSIBILITY.  
7) Everybody isn't as smart as you, you know  ("you" or
"ya"?) i) vejst dokh, (az) ni(sh)t yeder iz azoy klug
vi du ii) yeder iz dokh ni(sh)t azoy klug vi du
iii) ni(sh)t yeder iz dokh azoy klug vi du
 
does ii mean exactly the same thing as iii? CAN ANY TWO
VARIANTS MEAN "EXACTLY" THE SAME THING? THEY "FEEL" THE
SAME. THE FOCUS IS DIFFERENT.
 
8) Everyone died in each battle
i) in yeder/yedn kamf zaynen/zenen ale
umgekumen/geshtorbn ii) in yeder/yedn kamf iz yeder
umgekumen/geshtorbn  
could you also say:
 
iii) ale/yeder iz umgekumen/geshtorbn in yeder/yedn
kamf.  ? ALE ZAYNEN/YEDER IZ UMGEKUMEN. . . YES. IN
THIS CONTEXT, I THINK THAT UMGEKUMEN IZ BETTER THAN
GESHTORBN.
