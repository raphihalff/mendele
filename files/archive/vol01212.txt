on transcription, and Ellen Prince's note ("why not simply
adopt the yivo system?"):

by saying "mostly" YIVO-like, i was just hedging, not
having the relevant books to check in the office.  i think
my suggestion of _hh_ is unique, altho, as admitted, _kh_
is also good.  but mostly i was just responding to a couple
of earlier comments/questions, which seemed to come from
further away (geographically and linguistically), e.g. on
_sh_ vs. _sch_.

i'm sure YIVO recommends _z_ as in _zeyde_; i think they
also use _ts_ (rather than _tz_) -- if so, i agree again,
since the alternative _tz_ is more easily confused or
mispronounced as _z_.  like YIVO system and all other
phonetic systems (as against Berlitz-type), i think it is
vital not to use the idiosyncratic spellings of German (as
for German letters S, Z, etc.) or of English (especially
vowels).

the YIVO spellings are good, although a "new tradition" for
America, which has "traditionally" used a bizarre mish-mash
of English and German spellings, e.g. maven, zayde;
Chanukah, BUT cholent; zaddik/tzaddik, BUT zayde, BUT
words/sentences transcribed German-style, e.g. sehn, zehn.
i despair of getting ordinary American Jews to use
phonetic/YIVO style, since they're already all too confused
about vowels. (for them, i use a sneakier compromise
between phonetic and Berlitz, but one that uses lots of
diacritics, so it's not usable on e-mail.)

Are you aware of Eli Yasif's Hebrew study of Yudel

Zev Hochberg asks:

> Does anyone know the etymology of "oysen veynik" (?)
> meaning "by heart"? Weinreich doesn't have it ...

A good kashe.  First of all, it's a word, not a phrase; the
initial stress tells us that.  It would certainly be a
puzzle why "out of the few" should mean "by heart"!  The
original (and still extant) meaning of the word is
"external" or "outside" (Weinreich).  This apparently goes
back to the Old High German "uzzenewendiun" (with yoghs).
Grimm (under "auswendig") gives the OHG phrase
"uzzenewendiun theru grasceffi" as meaning "extra parietes
comitatus", and Der groyser verterbukh gives this as an
archaic meaning.  The "-wend-" would seem therefore to be
an unmlauted form of "wand" (our "vant"), "wall".  I don't
know why Yiddish lost the "d", but once it did, that left
the vowel in an open syllable, subject to lengthening and
diphthongization.

So why does "outside" mean "by heart" or "thoroughly"?
After all, that does seem to be the opposite of the
metaphor we would expect -- wouldn't you think a thorough
knowledge would extend deep into the interior of a subject,
and not just lie on its exterior surface (= superficial)?
Well, both Duden and Kluge state that the reference is to a
book: if you know something by heart, you don't have to
open the book.  You only have to look at the outside of the
book, not its inside.  This in fact dovetails with the
definition in the Groyser verterbukh.  I neglected to copy
it down, but the lead definition was something like "to
know something without having to look in a book, seyfer,
etc."

This account seems convincing to me, in the absence of a
good Yiddish etymological dictionary (does such a beast
exist?)  At least I hope this submission acts as a
lightning rod for somebody with a better account.

Subject: CURSES: UKRAINIAN/YIDDISH

When my frum uncle, Dovid, became particularly incensed
over someone he would mutter (as best as I can render
this): "ti-yop ti-ya mat."  When I was a kid I only knew
from context that this was a curse.  When I started going
to high school with a large black population I began to put
2 and 2 together.  When I asked uncle Dovid whether there
was a black strain in the family, and explained what I
meant, I got an embarassed laugh -- but no denial.  Later I
hypothesized that in every society where there's an incest
taboo that involves mothers and sons, there will likely be
such an insulting curse.  Jews certainly have a powerful
incest taboo, but I never heard any Jew insult another by
calling him a mother-fucker.  Is there such an expression
in Yiddish? In Hebrew? Or does the insult imply a violation
of such magnitude that it is not permitted to express this
in, as at were, one's mother tongue-- so that one uses a
"heathen" language -- Ukrainian, I assume, in my uncle's
case -- to refer to a barbarous person or act?  Any
clarification (and of course examples!) would be apprecia-
ted.
