A 1000-page event in Yiddishland - the 3 volumes of "Shpeter Shnit" by
Azario Dobruszkes have just been published!!

Azario Dobruszkes is an 89-year old Yiddish writer. His collected
works, Shpeter Shnit ("Late Harvest"), contain his articles published
over many years in Yiddish magazines throughout the world, together
with some of his unpublished work. The 3-volume edition in Yiddish came
out in September 2001.

Azario Dobruszkes was born in Vilnius, Lithuania. He grew up in a
cultured Jewish family and attended one of the town's Yiddish secondary
schools. In 1941, when the Germans reached Vilnius, he fled with his
wife to the Soviet Union. His qualifications as an engineer, obtained
in France, enabled him to find work there. He experienced life in a
Stalinist society on a day-to-day basis. He spent a year in Poland
immediately after the war, before settling in Belgium. There he worked
until his retirement as an engineer specializing in construction
materials. He continued to write, gave lectures and took an active part
in Yiddish cultural activities in Brussels.

Azario Dobruszkes writes in a variety of different genres. His writings
are a unique testimony to intellectual life in Vilnius. His
recollections of his school days - he was a pupil of Moishe Kulbak and
Max Erik - are interwoven with cultural events and his discoveries in
the fields of literature and the theatre. He describes daily life in
the Soviet Union in short stories and narratives. He has written poems,
essays and articles about the Shoah, Israel, Jewish holidays, and
God...  His essays and literary criticism give the reader a panoramic
view of Yiddish culture in the 20th century.

EDYTAD, a French registered charity, was founded with the aim of
publishing Azario Dobruszkes' work in book form, and entrusted the task
to the I. L. Peretz Publishing House in Israel. EDYTAD works in
Montpellier (France) in close cooperation with the author and is
responsible for the sales and promotion of the book. The project has
the backing of the Biblioth=E8que Medem (Paris), whose support is in
itself an indication of its worth.

The three 300-page volumes of "Shpeter Shnit" are at last available -
place your order now!

Libraries, cultural organizations and individuals can purchase the
books from EDYTAD. The 3-volume set costs 500 FF/ 70 $ US / 77 euros
(postage paid in Europe).

For details on how to order, get in touch with EDYTAD, c/o Beatrice
Baer, 1043 chemin de Moular=E8s, Montpellier, France (e-mail:
evans@wanadoo.fr, fax: (33) 4 67 65 74 38). Copies can also be
purchased by credit card from the Biblioth=E8que Medem, 52 rue
Ren=E9-Boulanger, 75010 Paris, France (e-mail: medem@yiddishweb.com).

Subject: radio documentary

We, two radiomakers from Holland, are making a radio documentary series
(3 x 45 minutes, Dutch national radio) about the memories on Yiddish
life before WWII.

We would like to come into contact with Yiddish speakers to interview
them about their pre-war youth memories. We are interested in the
Yiddish cultural life (music & theatre), the social movements - Der
Bund, zionism and other movements - and we are interested in family-
and day-to-day life. One of our focuses in our radio documentary is the
composer Mordechai Gebirtig, who wrote 'folk-songs' like Kinder-jorn,
's Brennt en Gehat hob ich a hejm. We hope that his songs invoke
memories of the people we interview.

We plan to come to the USA (or around the end November or in February
2002), we will go to New York and one other city in the USA or Canada.
Can you please help us with finding people who we could interview: an
older familymember, of maybe you yourself? You can contact us on:
grietje@xs4all.nl or on the address below. More information about the
radio documentary on this website:

Subject: Sheyn Bin Ich, Sheyn

For Claire Silverman, who asked about the song "Sheyn Bin Ich, Sheyn"
[11.017]. It appears in the book "Jewish Folk Songs" by Ruth Rubin (Oak
Publications, 1965).  There's no information about the song's origin
there unfortunately, but Freydi Mrocki, with whom I've recorded the
song, always sings it in a strong Varshaver (Warsaw) accent.

Subject: Blessings, Curses, Hopes, and Fears by James A. Matisoff

Among the several dozen books I own dealing with Yiddish there is one
that I ^?e owned since it appeared in 1979 (and which recently [2000]
came out in a slightly revised edition) to which I^?e returned more
often and with more intense joy than to any other publication.  I speak
of _Blessings, Curses, Hopes, and Fears_ by James Matisoff.  Unlike the
(to me) embarrassing borscht circuity, tasteless, badly edited and
inaccurate _Joys of Yiddish_ by Leo Rosten (see Peddling Yiddish
Midstream, March 1969, Pp 75 - 80) or the rather dry and opaquely
written semantic and sociolinguistic treatises by some other authors
from academia Matisoffs book takes a refreshing middle course.  In his
delightful book he enumerates and classifies the formulas Yiddish
speakers use to express their emotions.  He, too, develops a most
rigorous, totally footnoted linguistic argumentation - but he does it
with such charm and wit that I can^? recommend it too highly.

James A. Matisoff, Professor of Linguistics at Berkley, has just
returned from a trip to Sweden, where he gave a talk on Yiddish
psycho-ostensives (a term which he coined and which is fully explained
in _Blessings, Curses, Hopes, and Fears_) at a place called the
Multiethnic Center at the University of Uppsala.  He tells me that
Yiddish has just been declared one of the five official minority
languages of Sweden (along with Romany and Finnish, among others).

From: "Gur Klein" <talia@home.nl>
Subject: Lea Rudnicki

My Ph. D. research concerns aspects of veneration of Jewish Women which
I am doing with Prof. D'Haen of the Leiden University and the
Theological department of the Catholic University of Utrecht. Part II
deals with the veneration of Jewish women victims of the Holocaust.

I have two queries for you.

1. I am trying to find data about the poet Lea Rudnicki, or Rudniski,
or Rudniska, born in Kalvarija, Lituania in 1916, member of the
editorial staff of the Yiddish newspaper Vilner Emes. Killed in
Trablinka or Majdanek in 1943. The writer of the Ghetto song Dremlen
Feygl, published a volume of poetry entitled Neplen .

2. I would like some confirming information about the case of the
schoolgirls of Krakow, of whom it is told that they collectively
committed suicide on the eve of their deportation to serve as soldier's
prostitutes and sent a letter relating it.

I can read Hebrew, Yiddish, Dutch, German or English. I would be more
than willing to cover all costs involved in copying material and
postal.

kind regards

From: "Scott E. Meyer" <se-meyer@northwestern.edu>
Subject: Yiddle/Fiddle

I am trying to determine if any connection exists between the name
Yiddle and Fiddle (other than the fact that they rhyme)--most likely a
story, poem, song or play, prior to 1905.

My grandfather's original name, Yehuda, was often used in the
diminutive, Yiddle. He used to say that he was called "Yiddle with a
Fiddle," as a child. I recently saw his 1904 passenger ship records,
and he is variously referred to as "Iddle" and "Fiddle!" That certainly
seems to back up his statement. But I wonder what the derivation was. I
have leaned that Irving Berlin penned the song Yiddle on Your Fiddle
circa 1909, and Molly Picon starred in the film "Yiddle Mitn Fiddle"
circa 1937. (I believe that script was more recently turned into a
theatrical musical.) However, I have not been able to locate any
references to similar titles prior to 1905--when my grandfather was
dubbed with the phrase.

Any ideas?

Subject: "Development of Yiddish," [sic] at U. of Chicago Linguistics

The University of Chicago Linguistics Department is offering a course
in the Development of Yiddish.  Its description online is I would say
controversial enough to suggest that I share it with others, text
below.  The website I secured the text from is:
http://humanities.uchicago.edu/depts/linguistics/courses.html

  355. Development of Yiddish. PQ: 2 years of German or Yiddish or
  consent of instructor. Yiddish is the term for the dialects of German
  traditionally spoken by the Jews of non-German speaking Eastern
  Europe. Various theories as to its origin exist including, 1) that it
  is a sister language to the extinct Judendeutsch that the Jews of
  Germany used before the nineteenths century, both descending from a
  common ancestral "Proto-Yiddish" dating back to the Middle Ages, 2)
  that Yiddish arose only in the East, developing independently of
  Judendeutsch, 3) Yiddish is a creole language that came about when
  speakers of a Slavic language learned German imperfectly. These views
  will be examined using a variety of evidence including the Jewish
  writings in some from of German that made use of Hebrew letters, the
  rather numerous grammars of Judendeutsch that Gentile scholars and
  missionaries produced in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the
  representations of Jewish speech in roman letters that German authors
  included in their writings from the late medieval period onward.
