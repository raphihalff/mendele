Subject: yiddish ethnography of speaking in Argentina. 

I've just subscribed to Mendele.  My name's Claudia Oxman. I'm assistant of
Ethnolinguistics at University of Buenos Aires (Argentina). I've just got a
Master on Linguistics and I'm trying to work on a Ph.D project on yiddish
ethnographic research in Argentina. Could you tell me whom I can write to in
order to know who is doing this kind of research anywhere? Fil Adank.

Subject: frenkine/yoyshi

Whilst I do not wish to dwell unnecessarily on offensive words I find it
interesting that Sephardi women are sometimes referred to, insultingly, as
frenkines. 

I cannot think of any other yiddish word that gets the suffix -ine, rhymes
with argentiner, when feminized. 

While on the subject of insults to women, not long ago there was a discussion
regarding the subtleties differentiating yakhnes from yentes.  A more modern
word with a similar meaning is 'yoyshi'. I think the word comes from the
Hungarian tendency to exclaim 'yoysh' instead of the haymishe 'oy-vay' - yet
another Hungarian desecration of our noble customs. But though yoyshing on
every little thing will qualify one for the title other things like
slouching, certain facial contortions and overuse of 'already' are of equal
value when discussing admittance to the club.

Subject: "vuzvuz"

Back in the early days of net.religion.jewish on Usenet (1984-87 or so),
there was a fellow in Boston named Joachim Martillo who, from his postings,
would best be described as a "sefardi supremacist". He used to post at length
about "vusvus Ashkenazic scum" and how Sefardim were much better. It was
offensive and there was a fair bit of flaming, but I think most people took
it in good humour. 

The phrase "vusvus Ashkenazic scum" thus entered our family vocabulary (my
wife Simone was on Usenet at the time as well), and it comes to mind
periodically when I say "vus? vus?" to the kids (which I usually do if they
start speaking English -- I profess not to hear them until they switch back
to Yiddish). 

Any other Net old-timers remember Martillo? I was going to meet him when I
was in Boston in 1987 for a conference, and we spoke on the phone but never
connected in person. (Hmm, just checked dejanews and he's still very active
on Usenet. There are 251 postings in their database from Telford001@AOL.COM:
Joachim Carlo Santos Martillo Ajami. Mostly pro-Palestinian stuff in
israel.lists.il-talk. I guess his focus has changed.)

Subject: Shiksa

I agree with Yankel on the current meanings/connotations of Shiksa and
Sheygetz ... in the USA.  In Switzerland, my friend who was born and raised
in Basel tells me that the connotation there is a girl who is a prostitute. 
I had used the word in a conversation with her and her body language response
was utter shock!  It was then that I asked her and she told me what she
thought the word meant.

Subject: Goyete

A small note on the geographic distribution of "goyete":

My mother referred to the young women who served as "maids" and baby-sitters
as goyetes in Denver back in the 30s, and so did my grandmother, a"h.  My
mother was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and spent her high school years
in Utah.  My grandmother moved to Canada as a young girl from London,
England.  And my grandfather ended up in Canada after fleeing from somewhere
in Russia as a young lad.  So far as I can recall, the gantze mishpokhe used
"goyete." 

Incidentally, R. Shloime Twerski, z"l, used to call me a "goyatz," somewhat
playfully but also half-seriously, when he learned of my youthful violations
of halokheh.

Subject: goye/goyte

In reply to the 'goyte' discussion, my family, from Radmish'l in Galicia used
the word 'goy'ita for a female non-Jew in a pejoritive manner with the
introductory expression, 'ah zayr meen' with the word goy'ita'.

Subject: The name Shprintse; suffixes -e and -te; Frenkim & Ashkenazim

1. What a pleasant surprise to encounter the pedigreed name Shprintse
(Esperanza) among living and breathing Yiddishists. Welcome Shprintse Willes
(08.030). 

2.  David Sherman (08.033) asks about the significance of the variants of the
feminine suffixes -e and -te.  The etymological answer is:  Hebrew -e,
Aramaic -te.  The ideological/political answer,derived from my Toronto
experience (you're there and can test it yourself): 
_khaveyre_ is the Labor Zionist (Farband/Pioneer Women) designation for
its female members.
_khaverte_ is the Workmen's Circle (Arbeter-Ring) varia

3. Yosef Gilboa points out the irony of designating the Eastern Jews in
Israel as "Frenkim", a term obviously derived from the Western Jews who
settled among them. The same phenomenon appears to be true of the term
"Ashkenaz". According to Wexler (1993:48), the first "Ashkenazim" came from
the East ("Iranian Scythians"), and gave their name to their coreligionists
among whom they settled in the West. At the moment, I can't put my finger on
the precise location of a similar statement by Max Weinreich about the
Eastern (Armenian???) origin of the Ashkenazim.

Subject: English words in Yiddish

A shayle vegn Eynglish far di lingvistn

Over the years on Mendele, countless Yiddish words and expressions have been
discussed or analyzed - acceptable, kosher words that we learned were derived
from Russian or Polish or German or Hebrew.

I often found myself wondering why Yidishistn who happily employ these
Slavic, etc. derivatives in their speech, shudder and sneer at words that are
derived from English (also our mame-loshn, or at least our tate-loshn).
Colorful words like nekst-dorike, payde, endjoyen zikh, even vinde for
fenster. 

These words were uttered from the souls of immigrants in a new land,
immigrants trying to communicate, immigrants trying to belong. Why are
English words trayf and less expressive than German or Polish? 

Why were/are these words derived from English censured, while the Jews in
Russia or Poland incorporated their country's words into their Yiddish
vocabulary?

[Moderator's note: It seems that a position similar to Marjorie's is taken by
Rakhmiel Peltz in his "From immigrant to ethnic culture : American Yiddish in
South Philadelphia" (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998.  xix, 269 p.: 
ill. ; 24 cm. ISBN: 0804730202; 0804731675 (pbk.)).  - i.v.]

Subject: Nakhum

My distinguished teacher, Rabbi N. Bronznick, once explained to me that the
name Nahum (with a patach) is frequently rendered as Nohum (with a kamatz)
because "nahum" should properly be reserved for the Almighty, the source of
compassion (cf. hanun, rahum), whereas "nohum" is appropriate for human
beings who are (or hope to be) the recipients of compassion. So, actually,
there are two variants of the same name - Nahum and Nohum - depending on how
much of a stickler you are for the fine points of Hebrew grammar. Rabbi
Bronznick calls himself Nohum. Of course, in Israeli-Sephardic both names are
pronounced the same.
