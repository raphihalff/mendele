Subject: dos un yents

leygt zikh nit ken feygelekh in buzem means 'don't brag
about that which you don't have a right to brag about'.
(i'm sure we have a nice sounding English equivalent in
english, but i can't think of it.)  

question to robert rothstein:  could you explain the
correspondence between yiddish f and Ukrainian kh or khf or
khw.

somebody asked about daniel vs. doniel, a couple of
Mendeles ago.  while the name is with a komets in
loshn-koydesh texts, it's pronounced in Yiddish, as far as
i know, with [a] -- [dani'el].  so daniel-moyshe (hamekhune
dave) sherman is translating his yiddish name correctly.
why this is so in the case of daniel/doniel?  yelamdeynu
rabeynu.  another example of komets being pronounced pasekh
is khaver (although there's a form khover which means
'study fellow'). but this in an accented syllable, so it
may have nothing to do with daniel. Although I've never
heard [doniel] ("loy shomati eyno rayo"), there's a
prominent Modern Orthodox rabbi in Northern New Jersey
named Donniel Hartman.  The letter o could mean that some
people do pronounce the komets, or that the name should be
pronounced as in the one-syllable English name Don (i.e.
Donald).  who knows? [editing my text above:  the word
"English" in the 1st paragraph is extra.  in paragraph 2, i
mean transliterating, not translating.  this paskudne
computer system that i'm on won't allow me to correct
things. kam vi se lozt mikh shraybn!...]

be me all well!

Subject: Kapores un elevelomp

1- Vegn kapores: mayn mame nitst ot dem variant: "S'toyg af
tishe -V'- nayntsik kapores."  (Ikh aleyn hob
untergestrokhn dem "v'").  Vos iz der untersheyd?  Di mame
nitst di hebreyishe konyunktsie, "v'" anshtat der
germanisher "un."  Vi azoy etlekhe andere mendelnikes hobn
shoyn gezogt iz dos a numerishe tsunoyf- shmeltsung fun
hebreyishn "tishe" mit germanishn "naynstik" tsu meynen 99
kapores.  Kh'nem on az der bal-kashe veyst avade az epes
vos toyg af kapores iz in gantsn on a vert.  Iz epes vos se
toyg af tishe v'nayntsik kapores legamre un bishleymes
aroysgevorfn! Az me git tsu dem 99 shtraykht es unter gor
ironish punkt vi nishtik epes ken nor zayn.

[Combining the Hebraic "tishe" (9) with the Germanic
"nayntsik" (90) adds up to the numerical modifier, 99 to
emphasize that this is not only suitable for kapores, i.e.
worthless but multiplied 99 times to be utterly, totally
good for nothing!  I can't believe that my mother is the
only one who uses the Hebraic conjunction "v'" (and)
instead of the Germanic "in" between the 9 and 90.  Does
anyone else use or know of an informant who says "tishe
v'nayntsik kapores" and not "tishe un nayntsik...?"]

2-Kh'hob lang gevolt visn tsu emetser volt mir gekent
derklern punkt vos der doziker oysdruk meynt: "Me kukt af
im/ir mit an eleve(:)lomp."  Di tate-mame nitsn ot dem

Ver nokh hot gehert epes azoyns un ver ken es mir geben tsu
farshtyen?

[An expression my parents sometimes use goes something like
this "me kukt af im/er mit an eleve(:)lomp" but never have
been able to adequately explain its mean-ing and certainly
not give me an English equivalent.  It's one of those
expres- sions the meaning of which I can feel but can't
really translate.  When someone has a request, demand, or
proposal that hasn't the slighest chance of being accepted
or acted upon by someone else, the second party is said to
"kuk af im/ ir (the requesting/demanding/proposing party)
"mit an eleve(:)lomp" as if to say "like hell, s/he'll get
it (whatever is demanded/requested/proposed) or "Fat
chance"  but the actual meaning and origin escape me.  It
sounds like "an 11 (o'clock?) lamp...maybe?  Any clues out
there in computer-land?  I've even talked to a few mevinim
but so far no one's offered any illumination (not a
pun...)]

Subject: Kest

Witness the following joke (even made it into Freud's
"Jokes" p. 112. in the ppb. ed):
  > A shnorrer is invited for lunch to a rich man's house. He
  > shows up with a young man, and when asked who that was, the
  > shnorrer says: "This is my son-in-law and I've promised him
  > his board for the first year."

I suggest the joke only works because indeed the rich were
the ones who provided kest-- the anomally here is the
schnorer has found a way to do it too. while the
hardworking poor could not give  kest, the shnorer can. Dr.
R. Werman is surely correct, kest was only given by the
wealthy-- as vitsnessed by the above joke.

(1) YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, 1048 Fifth Avenue,
New York, NY 10028; tel. (212)535-6700; fax (212)734-1062.

(2) Several individuals at YIVO have e-mail addresses,
courtesy of the Research Libraries Group, whose network
RLIN is familiar to those of you who are affiliated with
large academic institutions (or specialized Judaica
research centers).  There is no e-mail address for YIVO per
se.  My mailbox is noted above.

Subject: YIVO e-mail or fax address

I found a message of Feb. 1st from Dr. Heinrich J.
Dingeldein looking for the current e-mail address or fax
number of YIVO in New York. I went to the trouble to phone
YIVO and learned that they are not on e-mail but they gave
me FAX 212-734 1062. The address of YIVO INSTITUTE FOR
JEWISH RESEARCH is 1048 Fifth Avenue, New York City, N.Y.
10028

I tried to communicate directly on e-mail with Dr.
Dingeldein and the i.d. was unknown, so here is the
information I have managed to acquire. Hope it answers his
query. Good Luck.
