Subject: dukhenen

The derivation of this word, as far as I know, is from the Hebrew dukhan, or
platform (where the kohanim stand during dukhenen.)

Subject: Indianer

I'm surprised that Pamela Lapham [07.079] couldn't find "turkey" as a regional
meaning for "Indianer" in the various dictionaries she consulted. The first
volume of my old four-volume German-English/English-German Muret-Sanders lists
"Truthahn" (turkey) as a regional meaning for "Indianer".  Dialectal and
regional meanings are not always included in desk dictionaries, so it pays to
consult larger ones--such as the old Muret-Sanders:  published around the turn
of the century it still remains the finest and most thorough German-English
dictionary--though obviously one would have to consult later lexicons for
subsequent neologisms.  Ms. Lapham might also have tried specialized Austrian
dictionaries.  Moreover, in Austria, "Indian" (without the -er) means only
"turkey" without the ethnic meaning of "Indianer"--just check the 1974
four-volume German-English/English-German Muret-Sanders.  Advice to all
dictionary users:  if you can hold a dictionary in one hand, it's probably
useless for any complex research. As for Sholem Aleichem:  one would still
have to trace some kind of trade route for "Indianer" meaning "turkey".  Even
so, Sholem Aleichem, as an avid practitioner of the Jewish national
sport--etymologizing--would certainly have been aware of the original ethnic
derivation of "indik."

Subject: finger in fist superstition

Since we are dealing with "emunot tfeilot" I wish to add one from my 
collection.

I. If you go on travel, a piece of garlic will be placed in the suitcase or
in the talit/tefilin bag. It will be done for instance by a wife for a 
husband, or for the children. At home a braided garlic is hung for protection.
I can speculate that the reason is that garlic has a long shelf life.

II. If one left the house on his/her way somewhere, and realized that he/she
forgot something in the house, it was dangerouse to walk back, therefore they
called for someone from the inside to bring the item out.

Subject: Dav(e)nen

In reponse to Esther Goffstein, it is impossible that doynen could have
changed to dav(e)nen. At best doynen was replaced by dav(e)nen. The two words
cannot be related, as noted by Birnbaum.

But another interesting thing noted by Weinreich is that he says that he once
had a letter from A. Landau (with Saineanu arguably the creator of modern
Yiddish linguistics) listing twice as many proposed etymologies as Birnbaum
knew of.  And crucially for me he mentions the d-b-b one, so it cannot be that
Florence Guggenheim-Gru"nberg was the first to come up with this etymology,
which I still regard as correct.

The crucial point here is that only the d-b-b etymology acounts for teh actual
form of the word in Yiddish.  All others that I know of would give merely a
similar form but not the right one.

Subject: zol mir zayn far dir

In some Middle Eastern communities, Jewish and non-Jewish, the word qurbaan or
qurbaana (which is obviously cognate with the Hebrew korban, Yiddish
korbn/korbm) is used by itself or in various combinations to express the idea
"May I be a sacrifice for ...", in other words, I would sacrifice myself for
so-and-so's welfare, usually one's children's. Aramaic-speaking Jews and
Christians say this, and I think Arabs, but I  haven't been able to come up
with references.

Subject: Iolanthe in Yiddish?

Yasher koyekh, Al Grand.  Who would have guessed that Iolanthe, a very British
comic opera, could inspire Yiddish comedy?

Al Grand (7.079, 7) accomplishes a tour de force in sustaining Gilbert's
English rhythm and rhyme with only an occasional, slight compromise of Yiddish
rhythm.  As he points out, there are seven metric feet to the line, but to my
ear, it is seven plus one.  The eighth is a necessary rest for the performer
(and reader) to catch a breath.  I found it a breathtaking, refreshing,
hilarious sprint to the finish line.  I enjoyed it immensely.

Thank you Al Grand.

Subject: Jewish superstitions and non-Jewish concomitants.

Ellen Prince and David Sherman both recollect a superstition that forbad
stepping over someone, particularly a young child.  This superstition is
alive and well in non-Jewish South India as well.

Subject: Vider Amol Indianer

Der tate fleg zogn, "Az dray zogn shiker darf men zikh tsuleygn, afilu az men
hot nisht getrunken eyn tropele vayn tzi shnaps." More than three Mendelyaner
have deemed Dos Porfolk to be turkeys, so perhaps we should let them rest in
turkey Valhalla. 

Yet, it matters deeply to me what one takes from a story, so here I go one
more time. With my deep respect for Lou and his expertise regarding Sholem
Aleichem,  at the end of the story "the prisoners lay on the ground. Their
still warm throats rested on each other..." Any way I try to humanize the
protagonists, I cannot see even agile American Indians with necks long enough
for their throats to rest upon each other.

Lou states further that Sholem Aleichem calls them vilde mentshn, and American
Indians, as we sadly know, were referred to as savages. But in the story, the
keepers, the shoykhets, are called vilde mentshn, not the protagonists.

Also, why would the Turkish shawl boast "that God would reward her for
fattening such a pair for Passover"? Would two fat American Indians enhance
the seder or the yontef?
