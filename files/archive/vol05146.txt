I recall that Sholem Aleichem used the word "lokkhenen" (or is it
"lakakhenen," "lakkhenen,") from the Hebrew lamed-kuf-khes, meaning to
take. I think I remember it from Motl Peysi, and as I recall it was a
kind of cute euphemism to use when one didn't quite want to say that
someone had stolen something, but that is in fact what he/she had done.

Subject: Khap'n, khapts'm and pak'n

What with the yontoyvim and enough schoolwork to last a yur in a mitvokh,
I'm way way way behind on Mendele, and thus will be writing on some
topics which have begun to fade from memory;  I'll try to refer to volume
numbers where I remember them.

Rick Gildermeister (5.139) is correct in surmising that the "ts" in
"Khapts-im" is a suffix being added to imperatives;  for me, it's not
just an addition, but the plural imperative marker, necessary when
addressing two or more people, and contrasted with the singular
imperative. "Ets tsvay, her owf ts'redn" is anomalous to my ear--it
should be "Ets tsvay, herts owf ts'redn".

The noun "khapts'm" is Yinglish, not Yiddish--an adaptation of the
(formerly) oft-heard cry in the streets of "Khapts-im" (an imperative
sentence).  The former is used by non-Yiddish speakers, as in "There was
a huge khapts'm on Thirteenth Avenue this morning, but the cops came and
stopped it."  The latter is an imperative sentence, used to rally the
troops after a mugger or any other unwelcome element--rarely in Boro
Park, more often in Williamsburg.  No Yiddish speaker will use the
noun--it hasn't made its way back into Yiddish, and would sound very
anomalous.

I have deliberately distinguished the spelling of "khapts'm" and
"Khapts-im", not only because they're grammatically distinct, but because
my nose tells me there's a slight differnce in the phonology (actual
sounds):  the last vowel is articulated in the imperative, but lost in
the noun;  when the imperative sentence is shouted (as is usually the
case), the last vowel is extremely elongated ("Khapts-iiiiiiiiiiiiim!!!").
And the noun can show up as "khapts'n" (possibly a case of homorganic
nasal assimilation?).

As for other uses of "khapn," one that wasn't mentioned was "khapn
shrayim"--when, at a tish, kh'sidim try their best to grab the rebbe's
leftovers, which get passed around the table.

Also, in yeshives and the lomdishe world in general, to "khap" something
is to realize it/understand it/'get' it.  e.g. "Demults hob ikh g'khapt
far vus der Rashbe hot du arayng'brenkt a toysfes fin zvokhim." (It's
used in American Yeshivishese quite a lot, even outside the context of
lern'n, e.g. "I don't khap why they didn't have a khapts'm when the
shaygets broke the window."  It isn't used in Israeli Yeshivishese,
possibly because Yiddish agreement suffixes are less similar to Hebrew
suffixes than to English ones, so using Yiddish verbs sounds more
anomalous in Hebrew than it does in English.  Cf. fargin'n, which can be
used in Yinglish, but has been changed into Hebrew "l'fargen", as in
"Ani lo m'fargen la.")

Regarding khap'n and pak'n, I'm familiar with both, but for me, the
former is a physical catching, while the latter refers to knowledge,
catching someone in the act, finding out/proving what they've done.  To
wit:

"kh'o'g'pakt a ganif in maan shtib in mitn di nakht, ober ikh hob'm nisht
g'kont khap'n." ('I caught [i.e. interrupted, espied] a thief in my room
in the middle of the night, but I couldn't catch [apprehend] him.')

"Di polislayt fin losandzheles hob'n g'khapt Vadzhe Yankel Simpson, ober
zay hob'n'm nisht g'kont pak'n--er hot farbrent zayne hentshkes." ('The
L.A. police caught O.J. Simpson [i.e. prevented him from escaping], but
they couldn't catch him [in a crime, show he committed a crime]--he
burned his gloves.')

My translations are obviously rather loose, but to me, both those
sentences make perfect sense.  Do they sound strange to anyone else?

(As far as I know, the plural of "politsay" is "politsay", but I've also
come across "polislayt;"  I suspect it's an Americanism, based on an
analogy: yingerman-->yingelayt, ureman-->uremelayt,
policeman-->polislayt.)

I can remember the pawn shop district in Montreal during the 30's and
40's where men were hired to stand outside some of these stores with the
sole purpose of enticing pedestrians to come in and buy or "sell". They
were called "khappers". Here too, the inference is alike to kidnapping
someone or control by great persuasion or mind bending.
