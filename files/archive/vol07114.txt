[Incidentally, Nomberg wrote (stopping about 1908) during Sholem Aleichem's
lifetime so that his usage of _indianer fun amerike_ should help settle
anybody's remaining doubt as to whether _indianer_ meant American Indian to
Sholem Aleichem.]

Subject: Yiddish: Future Continuous 

I would like to thank all Mendelyaner who sent me letters about my last 
"Yiddish in the news" review in 07.109 (and of course, particularly I thank 
those who praised my posting).

(By the way, why is it that some of my posts generate many private and very
few public responses? Am I touching on something unseemly for a public
discussion? Being envious to the others' public success, I am seriously
considering writing an essay on the proof that the word _dav(e)nen_ is not
related etymologically to the Chinese _dao fen_ (which means kadish, or more
precisely, prayer to the dead), because Chinese "f" never ever becomes a "v" 
in Yiddish. I know 7 native speakers and 43 linguists who can confirm this
fact, so it is not an empty threat.) 

Looking at the responses I received I would like to clarify two issues. First,
in my message I did not intend to promote or discredit any particular
ideological leaning. Which is due perhaps to the liberals' "voluntary
preference for powerlessness" (Ruth Wisse, Yiddish: Past, Present, Imperfect,
and other works). They (liberals) are so spineless, that they: a) do not hate
their opponents, b) are seeking a dialogue with them, and c) even worse, are
ready to find some reasonable common ground. 

This common ground is the second, and probably more complex issue. In the
whole world there are not that many of those who care about the Yiddish
culture, that they can easily afford to antagonize each other. Yet this is
exactly what's often happenning. If we were able to learn from history (either
Jewish or general), we would have realized the destructive potential of such
patterns: a small number of individuals and/or groups apparently pursuing the
common goal, but unable to resolve their internal contradictions.  Neither the
goal, nor the parties involved ever benefited from those situations.

Again, I am not blaming either side. And this is not a call for an immediate
and total peace or truce. The idea is as modest as it is unrealistic: if for
the sake of the common cause everyone would give up just a small portion of
his (or her) righteousness and correctness, the cause would eventually say
"thank you".

Subject: Mendele in Podolia

I am curious if anyone knows which towns in Podolia Mendele Moykher-Sforim
journeyed through during his time as a wanderer (in which he traveled with
Avreml the Limper, possibly a model for "Fishke the Lame"). I do know that he
wound up as a teacher in Kamenets-Podolski. 

thank you

Subject: Daunen

A non-linguist might not be the right person to try his hand at finding
etymologies, but he might know enough about language to follow a linguist's
explanation of an etymology. Within limits a non-linguist might even have some
insights in language. Someone knowing Yiddish, German and English can safely
say that the consonant 't' does often change into 'd' like in 'tokhter' and
'daughter' He might not know when this happened or how the linguist would
describe this common phenomenon. For the same non-linguist it is easy to see
that an 'oy' in Yiddish often represents Modern German 'au', as in hoyz -
Haus, Engl. house. The same non-linguist would not be amazed to hear that
Yiddish written 'oy' might have been pronounced in different ways in different
dialects, for instance like German 'au' or English 'ou'.  If a linguist
explains that there was a Western Yiddish word 'orn' which in time was
replaced by an Eastern Yiddish word with the same meaning, 'dav(e)nen, it will
be accepted by the non-linguist. It will also be taken for granted that the
verb 'orn' was related to a verb related to Latin 'oro', which originally
meant 'to speak'(comp.  orator) and later acquired the specific meaning 'to
pray', the same as Yiddish/German 'betn'.  According to linguists there once
was an Old Yiddish word with the same meaning: 'doynen'.  With his general
knowledge the non linguist might figure that: 'doynen' could have the
pronunciation 'daunen' and that the 'd' comes originally from 't'. 

Now, if 'orn' came from 'oro', 'doynen' or 'daunen' could be related to modern
German 'toenen (e=umlaut), which goes back to Lat. 'tono' - to speak in a loud
voice, thunder.  This jump the non-linguist cannot make unaided, but when told
that German indeed had a related form 'daune' and that Dutch still has a
related form 'deun' (eu pronounced as German o-umlaut), both meaning 'tune' or
melody, the non-linguist can easily follow the argument and make it his own. 

The question a non-linguist might ask at this point is whether 'orn' and
'doynen' ever existed next to each other, as 'orn' and 'dav(e)nen did, and
whether there ever was a clear distinction in meaning between them, such as
'orn'-to pray with speaking voice, recite prayers and 'doynen' to pray with a
singing voice, chant prayers.  If this was the case, if the two words
originally were used to indicate a technical distinction, this might explain
why a third word was taken over for the more general concept, namely 'betn'.
That at a later stage all three words would have ended up having the same
meaning does not seem improbable and that as a consequence one or two went
missing altogether sounds believable. There seems to be some 15th century
evidence that a form of 'doynen' [do "ent] was used to express the chanting of
a cantor, the gazn. 

The non-linguist is told by the linguist that at in the 16th century yet
another word for praying appeared on the scene, 'daven' or 'dav(e)nen': "The
meaning of davnen in Yiddish, from its appearance in the works of Rivke
Tiktiner in the late 16th century to the present is 'to recite the prescribed
prayers' -- whether silently or at the top of one's voice. The written form it
is found in is "dvnin".[v=veyz] (Meyer Wolf). 

If the word 'dvnin' was pronounced 'davnen' at the time, the now lay-linguist
might think that it cannot be a long way from doynen=daunen to davnen. Anyone
who has ever looked in an etymological dictionary knows that 'u', 'v', 'w' and
'b' are tricky characters and that especially in writing the 'u', 'v' and 'b'
seem almost interchangeable, whether we are dealing with Hebrew, Sanskrit or
Latin.  But here the non-linguist will be severely ridiculed by the
professional linguist. The notion that there could be any connection between
'daunen' and 'davnen' appears to be outrageous and nonsensical. We have to
accept this criticism, because it is true, we cannot find any other Yiddish
words with a similar derivation.  Next we are asked to believe that davnen
represents Hebrew 'davav', to speak, whisper.  Why Hebraists, while
introducing Hebrew words in the Yiddish language in order to replace words of
Germanic or Romance origin, would take the Hebrew word 'whisper' instead of
the normal Hebrew word for 'speak' - 'diber' is not explained. Moreover, if
Hebraist had felt that the common Yiddish word praying needed a replacement,
one would expect them to take a Hebrew word with the meaning 'to pray' in
stead of finding the wrong Hebrew translation for a word originally meaning
'to speak in a loud voice'.  It remains also vague why the forms related to,
'doynen' would have disappeared from the language without leaving any trace in
one or another dialect.  It appears that the non-linguist is not allowed to
ask such stupid questions.

Subject: davenen again???

Claus Buryn's contribution would be more useful if he paid more attention. 
When he says: 'In "der oytser fun der Yidisher shprakh" we find the
expression: "dav(e)nen farn omed".Sholem Aleykhem has Motl use these words,
speaking about the work of a khazn. This does not exclude other uses of the
word dav(e)nen, but if the first attested use of the word is found in a "15th
cent. manuscript in which der khazen do"nt", the original meaning could have
been "chanting" instead of "praying" or "reciting in silence".'
 
he is buying into the idea davenen can be derived from the 15th cent. 
German-origin verb do"nen.  But for the hundredth time, this is impossible. 
It is in my view useless to try to make progress by going back to the most
elementary mistakes and repeating them. 

More generally, I dont know if Meyer Wolf and Bob Hoberman would agree, but I
HOPE they would, that there is a rather basic distinction to be drawn between
the proposals made or endorsed by people who have SOME idea of linguistic
methodology (e.g., Max Weinreich or F. Guggenheim-Gru"nberg or, it turns out,
Hillel Halkin or even, dare I say it, me) and the ones which are put forward
by people who violate every methodological principle that has been learned in
the in teh last 200 years.  I think it would help to organize the discussion
by separating out those few proposals which have been made by the former
group.

Subject: davenen 3

I am more and more perplexed by Mr. Buryn's comments.  There is no mystery
about Dutch Yiddish 'ou' corresponding to 'oy' in certain kinds of EY.  This
is a well known and trivial sound correspondence.  As for the word shpousering
and where Beem got it, the answer must be that he got the same place as his
other Dutch Yiddish forms, from informants (who I believe are listed in one of
his two books). These are all forms which occurred in somebody's recollection
of Dutch Yiddish SPEECH.  Whether they also can be found in some text is
something he does not address--and something which is of no relevance
whatever.  Many Yiddish dialects were never written at all, but that makes
them of no less importance to teh historian of the language.  So there is
simply nothing in Mr. Buryn's comments which detracts from the force of my
observation that there was once in Yiddish a stem of the form (Eastern)
-shpoyz- (Western) -shpous- meaning 'to betroth' which survives in relics but
must once have been quite widespread, which is of Romance origin, and which
has been almost totally replaced in Eastern Yiddish by words derived from
Hebrew-origin knas.  Moreover, I cited at least one other suche xample, so
that even if there WERE anything wrong with this one (and there is NOT), my
general point against Mr. Warshawsky's ingenuous (pseudo)history of Yiddish
would still stand, namely, that elements of Hebrew origin have in historical
times in many cases become more frequent in Yiddish than they once were,
sometimes.  supplanting earlier eleemnts of Germanic or Romance origin.

Subject: davnen, doynen, etc

1. M. Kosover based his surmise on the derivation of davnen from doenen on the
basis of his study of a rare early manuscript of of a book of minhogim in a
library.  Those of us who have more ready access to later printed versions are
in a better position to study the text at length and to correct the inevitible
mistakes Kosover made in poring over the ms. under less enviable conditions. 

According to the text the khazn does doen, but from passages that Kosover
missed, it is clear that the congregation also doens. The khazn as well as the
congregation or, zing and zog prayers, even zog mit a nign, with no clear
specialization of the verbs. 

2. doenen cannot be the source of the variant of davnen, doynen, which has
been recorded from a number places in Northeastern Yiddish. As Uriel Weinreich
has shown, the oy diphthong in this word, in an area where voynen is
pronounced veynen and the like, clearly indicates that the word is not
descended from doenen. It is, in fact, the result of a regional development
which also produced bahoynt from bahavnt. 

3. The discussion of Dutch Yiddish dawwenen should not be allowed to obscure
the fact that davnen is not only found among East European Yiddish speakers.
Steven Lowenstein's map on p. 28 of Field of Yiddish III shows davnen found
well into Germany.  This is not recent; texts from the 16th and 17th centuries
already attest to areas where both orn and and davnen are found. 

4. The attempt to derive davnen from dovev is far older than F. Guggenheim-
Gruenberg's etymology. In volume III of his Geshikhte, on pages 85-87, M.
Weireich writes at length of a number of etymologies of davnen sent to him by
A. Landau in the 1920's, this very one among them. 

5. The usage of the DBB root in ancient Hebrew and Aramaic does not suggest
that it is the source of davnen. However the root enjoyed a second career in
the prayers and hymns of the middle ages, where it is found as a poetic
synonym for other verbs of speaking and saying, as Even-Shoshan's Hamilon
HeHadash shows.
