Rafael Finkel: Actually, skotsl kumt has nothing to do with
cats. It's an old greeting meaning 'welcome', probably
derived from a medieval form like "bis(t) bay got
vilkomen". In Western Yiddish, it's often said only by
women instead of "sholem aleykhem" and it's pronounced more
like "g/kotl kum".
 
You're right about the meaning of "noyekh mit finf/zibn
krayzn". The issue has concerned its origin which, if I'm
right, depends on grayzn, in this instance, having been
substituted for an original krayzn.

Subject: SHOAH; HAREY AT

Re: SHOAH, I saw most of it, and I recall noticing that the
Jewish witnesses who spoke Hebrew were, as a whole, very
matter-of-fact in their descriptions with few adjectives
and little emphasis, while those who chose to speak Yiddish
in the interview used lots of complex adverbial and
adjectival phrases (e.g., "it was SO COLD that ...").  Not
being a language expert, I may not have described this in
correct technical terms, but the difference struck me.
There were also lots of speakers of Germanic languages, as
I recall, but I thought I could easily tell the difference
between the German and the Yiddish speakers.

Mikhl Herzog: I will risk one more revisit to our initial
interchange, because it appears that it is still troubling
you.

1) I did not know your impressive background at the time of
   our initial interchange.  I hear that you want to be
   respected, and I do.

2) I would like to believe your assertion, but I still
   don't like being told my conjecture is wrong without
   contrary evidence, or a pointer to same (see below).

3) I don't bristle just because you made an assertion about
   Yiddish (indeed, you've made many assertions since).

I think you're on to something about the nature of evidence
that I'd find convincing enough to justify your assertion:
"The origin of 'heirat' has nothing to do with 'haray at'".

First of all, it would take a lot to prove (to me) a
negative assertion like that, e.g., a "clincher" or several
strong (but not quite clinching) facts. It would take less
to prove a more modest assertion, such as "The origin of
'heirat' is unlikely to be 'haray at'".

Examples of clinching evidence are:

a) Evidence of the origin of my faulty "heirat"/"haray at"
   conjecture. For example, I've seen and heard it cited
   that W. C. Fields' epitaph reads "I'd rather be here
   than in Philadelphia".  In fact, Fields and other
   celebrities of his time were asked to write their own
   epitaphs, as a joke, and the one Fields submitted for
   publication was "All in all, I'd rather be in
   Philadephia".  Seeing the magazine article convinces me
   that he wrote it as a joke.

b) Evidence about the origin of "heirat", e.g., if it dates
   from the 8th century, prior to the rise of Yiddish, then
   it couldn't have entered via Yiddish.  Such a
   fundamental word surely would have been used in some
   written form, if it existed.

c) Published counter-theories, e.g., Joe Shmoe's Germanic
   word origins cites the origin of "heirat" as ..., or
   even a standard German dictionary (though I must admit
   that I'd suspect that non-Jewish German experts might
   suppress or ignore evidence of Yiddish word-origins).

d) Personal counter-theories.  These need to be backed up
   by lots of evidence, and I'd have to take an authority's
   word on this, I suppose.

d) Evidence about pronounciation of "haray at".  I think
   that this WAS pronounced like "heirat" is, but I'm not
   sure about that.  This could admittedly be a
   coincidence, but knowledge about Hebrew pronunciation by
   various Yiddish-speaking Europeans might shed some light
   here.  One reason that the theory sounds so plausible to
   me is that there's little or no change in the
   pronunciation.  I understand that it could still be a
   coincidence.

And finally, let's not forget the other word-origin: German
"lashe" (for the tongue of a shoe), which my friend claimed
was from  Yid/Heb "loshn".

I am certainly no authority on Yiddish, but I am an
authority (a second- hand one) on the spelling of Mordkhe's
name, because my wife who is Mordkhe's daughter uses his
last name as part of her last name.  She spells his last
name as Schaechter.
