Subject: Bund

re the Jewish Labor Bund.  In 1935 the Bund commissioned Aleksander Ford to
produce a film about the work of the Bund in Poland.  The film "Mir Kumen on"
aka Children Must Laugh has been restored and is  available from the National
Center for Jewish film together with 20 other Yiddish language feature films.
The film is a wonder document about the Medem Sanitorium which was established
and run by the Bund outside of Warsaw.  For details contact NCJF at phone 617 
899 7044 or email.

Subject: Rights to Translate Jacob Gordin Satire

I have a lengthy academic article, which was originally presented as the 
Vivian Lefsky Hort Memorial Lecture at the YIVO Institute in New York, that is
currently under consideration for publication.  The editor of the journal has
asked me to secure the rights to publish my translation of Jacob Gordin's
short satire, "Moyshe Rabeynu, Iezus Kristus un Karl Marx tsu gast in Nyu
York," which was published in book form by the _Forverts_ in 1910 (4 vols.).
Does anyone know if Gordin's estate is still active, and holds a copyright to
this piece, or is it in public domain?  Any advice would be greatly 
appreciated.

Subject: Folk songs from Beregovsky's collection in Shtetl

Shtetl invites all Mendele subscribers for a preview of "Yiddish Songs
Online": four beautiful but obscure songs from Moisey Beregovsky's collection
(http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/music/beregovsky.html). You can read the lyric
in Yiddish or transliteration, see the score, hear the music, and even sing
along, accompanied by a Virtual Klezmer. Presented songs include: _Vu bist
du geven, tokhterl mayne_, _Shnur, mayn shnur_, _A khosn hot gevolt zain kale
oysklern_, and _Ikh bin geforn keyn eyns_. The site is designed by Shura
Vaisman and illustrated by Alexander Vaisman (yes, it is mafia, Shtetl-style).
Yiddish texts were recreated from Beregovsky's transliteration using Raphael
Finkel's Yiddish Typewriter.

Although we are closer to Roshashone than to Purim, for an added bonus, the
visitors will be treated to the excerpts from the performance of Golias-shpil,
recorded by Beregovsky in Kremenetz (Ukraine).

Publications, containing all these and many other materials from Beregovsky's
collection include:

Folklor-lider: naye materyaln-zamlung. Moskve: Emes, 1933.

Subject: Former Shuln students

Are there any former students at the IWO or JPFO shuln  on the Mendele lists
who would like to communicate with other former students in Yiddish or about
Yiddish in English, or about any other subject? The shuln provided me with a
strong feeling for Yiddish, second only to the profoundly Yiddish feeling I
experienced at home. I am not interested in discussing political ideology,
although I suspect many former shula students may find they have a common
outlook on life with other former shula students.

I attended the Philadelphia shuln but would like to meet via E-mail people who
attended the shuln elsewhere. Any one who is interested, please contact me.

Subject: Bund literature

There is a wealth of literature in many languages  also articles in 
periodicals in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the Bund. A good
place to start is the Bund offices in New York: 25 East 21st St. New York,
N.Y. 10021  tel 212 473 5101, 475 0059.  -khotsh der bund iz shoyn lang nit
