Subject: Preserving YIVO's resources

I'd like to thank Jeremy (Yude) Rosof for posing some questions about
disaster preparedness and contingency plans at the New York YIVO
(especially in light of recent events in Argentina).  Few libraries and
archives are truly prepared for the ultimate disaster -- fires, floods,
earthquakes, explosions.  Many take steps to protect their collections,
and the range of steps varies according to the means available, as well
as the physical conditions in which the collections are housed.

Visitors often ask, for example, "Why is YIVO leaving that beautiful
mansion on Fifth Avenue?"  (We are in the process of relocating, first to
temporary quarters at 555 West 57th Street, and in about two years' time
to 15 West 16th Street -- both addresses are now official.)  Having spent
a grand total of twelve-and-a-half years in that building, I have
witnessed more than my share of water leaks, minor floods and falling
plaster, in a structure that NEVER was intended to house books and
archival records.  I have worried constantly that unique documents would
be lost forever to a water main break (a frequent occurrence in New York
City) because they are kept below street level.  I have picked up volume
after volume that crumble to the touch -- victims of an unforgiving
climate: no air conditioning or humidity controls have ever been in place
at 1048 Fifth Avenue, which is hot and damp in summer and winter alike.
And then there is the space problem:  We simply ran out of room to house
our collections, somewhere around 1970, i.e., about 15 years after YIVO
moved in.

So one answer to the question, What is YIVO doing to protect its
collections, is:  We're moving out of a poor environment and intend to
move into a far roomier and better one (funds permitting).

Meanwhile, while YIVO lags somewhat behind many research institutions --
especially the large university libraries to which most MENDEL- nikes
presumably have direct access -- we have accomplished a lot to preserve
the intellectual contents of our collections.  Large portions of the YIVO
Archives and Library have been microfilmed -- not enough, but a fair
amount nevertheless.  The master negatives of these microfilms are stored
in a secure site in Upstate New York. The bulk of our pre-1939 European
Yiddish press (along with much of our American Yiddish press) is
available on microfilm, and about 6,000 Yiddish books have also been
microfilmed by YIVO.  Other libraries, including the Library of Congress,
the New York Public Library, Harvard University Library, and the American
Jewish Periodical Center (at Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati) have also
been active on that front.  The National Yiddish Book Center's tremendous
collecting efforts have also made it easier for the Yiddish librarian to
sleep at night.

YIVO is not only about Yiddish, however, and it's not only a library.  We
have not done as much work with our important collections in Hebrew and
the Slavic languages (above all, Russian and Polish) as we have with
Yiddish, though these too may be available in other libraries.  As for
our archival materials, there is much work still to be done.  I might add
that one doesn't just buy some rolls of 35 mm film, put them into a
camera and start shooting; in order for a microfilmed archival collection
to be truly usable, it must be arranged (organized by a professional
archivist), with proper "targets" (brief descriptions) inserted before
filming. Preservation -- in whatever format we're discussing (today it's
microfilming; tomorrow it is likely to be in digital format) -- is a very
labor-intensive (and costly) procedure.

The Buenos Aires YIVO's public catalogs were destroyed; what have we in
New York done to prevent the loss of that kind of information?
Unfortunately, the YIVO Library has not had the staff or funds that would
permit us, retrospectively, to computerize our card catalog. We have,
however, reproduced the Yiddish portion of that catalog (about 30% of the
total), as well as the catalog of our microfilmed press holdings, and
this catalog is available for consultation in many libraries.  A
microfilm was also made, over 20 years ago, of the catalog of religious
books (sforim) in our Vilna collection. The YIVO Archives are in the
process of producing a printed guide to their collections; in advance of
that, descriptions of over 1,000 YIVO Archives record groups are
available online, through the RLIN bibliographical database, and
diskettes for the printed guide are stored off-premises.

To sum up, I'd say that YIVO in New York is somewhat better positioned to
withstand the ultimate disaster than our Argentine counterpart was.  We
are aware, though, that our collections will continue to be at risk as
long as they are not properly housed and as long as their contents have
not been preserved in an appropriate medium.  We are also aware that we
have to reach out more to our supporters and potential supporters, so
that our financial basis will also be secured, thereby enabling YIVO to
continue to serve as THE address for research into Eastern European and
Yiddish-speaking Jewry.

Subject: A girl named Getole

Once again to Dr. Zellig Bach:  the Yiddish poet Hinde Zaretski (who is
now 103 years old, if I'm not mistaken) wrote a poem about the girl named
Getole.

Subject: Diminutive plurals
Can somebody please speak to the correct orthography and sound of the -x
diminutive plural?  E or A?  What's the deal here?  I've always heard
"-ax" from native speakers, but seen "-ex" written in many cases. Any
info would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Bernard S. Greenberg

Subject: Diminutive plurals

Not knowing Yiddish linguistics, I have also been puzzled by these
plurals. But I've always heard the ending as -(l)ax.  As in kinderlax,
teyglax, kneydlax. Is this the same or different ending?  And is the /l/
always there?  I guess I'm asking if the ending is only added to a stem
ending in -l?  Some general linguist but Yiddish layperson questions?
The ending seems to be popular with foods that you normally make a
"batch" of, i.e., a collective.  In addition to the 2 foods mentioned
above, I remember "bletlax" for the "crepes" you make into blintzes.  Is
this valid?

Subject: Without Malice, but with Aforethought, Genuine Goodwill

I ended my note on the Romanization of Yiddish in Mendele (4.059) with
the following sentence: <We need greater care and self-discipline when
romanizing Yiddish.>  Well, I am fully aware of the E-mail network
etiquette ("netiquett") not to flame people for spelling errors.  But for
the life of me I cannot see how a call to "greater care and
self-discipline" can by any stretch of the imagination be characterized
as "cross and ill-tempered" (Davis, 4.061,4).  Interestingly enough,
Evelyn Feins (4.060,3), whose "a shainem dank to allah" I satyrized as
thanking Allah, found my comment correct and very amusing.

Orbach too (4.065,7) referred to my comment as "carping," but Axelrod
(4.068,3) readily saw Orbach's totally missing the important point that
my suggested "alemen" in place of 'allah" was the correct grammatical
dative, and that his example "Loz mir alle zingin" is not relevant to the
correction.

Mikhl Herzog, the famous cartographer of Yiddish and its dialects, wrote
recently (4..040,5) that "in numerous Mendele postings it is... apparent
that no effort to learn is taking place."

I think of the Mendele khavruse as a learning society (not as yet as a
learned society), and I am sure that many Mendele khaveirim wish to learn
and do not mind an occasional friendly  correction.
