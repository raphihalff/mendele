Subject: peygern

The recent discussion over the etymology of peygern reminds me of a
mystery.  A phrase that my mother remembered from her childhood was:
"Bin ikh mir a tsig, un peyger oykh in tsherida."  She would recite
this in a kind of childish sing-song, and she thought it might have
been from a children's story or folktale, or perhaps it was just the
punch line of a joke.  She translated "tsherida" as "field",
"pasture", "meadow"; I don't know if it is a Yiddish word or
(perhaps) Ukrainian or Russian.  (I have just transcribed it, more
or less, phonetically; the accent is on the first syllable.) The
meaning of the phrase, as she explained it, was, "I [too] am a goat
and [have the right to] die [with the others] in the pasture." Can
anyone shed light on this phrase and the (presumed) story that leads
up to it?

Subject: Yiddish material in Portuguese or Spanish

Just to let you know that I am replying to Mr. LEvacov directly, and
in our native language, Portuguese.

By the way: Mr. Levacov wrote from Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul,
a Brazilian region from where comes an outstanding Jewish Brazilian
writer: Moacyr Scliar.

Mr. Scliar has written more than 20 novels and many more short
stories. Most of the subjects of his stories deal with the Jewish
immigrant to the southern Brazilian area.

Presently at Brown University, Mr. Scliar will be at my University
on Thursday to give us a talk. (I am organizing this conference,
with the support of the Univesity of Maryland, Georgetown
University, The Catholic University (Washington, D.C.), the Woodro
WIlson Center for Latin American Scholars, the Brazilian -AMerican
Cultural Institute and the Brazilian Embassy).

This is a partial listing of Scliar's novels in English: *The
Centaur in the Garden*   *The Carnival of the Animals*   *The
One-Man Army* and *The Strange Nation of Rafael Mendes*.

If you are in the Washington are and would like toa attend his
presentation, please call the Brazilian American Institute for more
information: (202)362-8334. He will be there on Thursday, October
21, at 8 PM

If you want information on Scliar or his works, please feel free to
write to me: RI1@umail.umd.edu or to the address below.

A sheyne dank!

Subject: introduction

I am an English professor at Chapman University, specializing in
eighteenth-century poetry.  My Yiddish connection is that I attended
the Workman's Circle elementar-shul and middle-shul in NYC.  My
grandmother was the poet Malka Lee, and my other  grandparents
helped to establish the Jewish People's school in Montreal.  Lately
I've been haunted by the fact that all this "yichus" means nothing
if I don't carry on the Yiddish tradition.  That's why I have joined
this group.

Subject: introduction

I read about Mendele in the magazine Lilith.  The only Yiddish I
know is "Rednish for the children".  My Grandmother used to say it
before speaking yiddish to the other members of my large family when
we lived in Oakland, Ca.

I was an elementary school teacher but have returned to school to
study for a Master's degree in Library Science.Israeli dance and
music are my hobbies---I like Yiddish music, too.

Tayere MENDELnikes

For those who might be interested, here are some news from the
Yiddish Theater in Montreal (der yidisher teater beim saidye
bronfman center).

>From a letter from the Yiddish Theater...

   This year's season opens with the Yiddish premiere of
   "Conversations with my father" by Herb Gardner, the award-winning
   playwright of "I'm not rappaport" fame. This though-provoking
   dramatic comedy, a smash hit on Broadway, will entertain and
   inspire audiences of all ages.

   ... (past achievements)

   This year will be another outstanding one. So join us for Opening
   night on November 13, at 8 p.m. Tickets cost $36.00 and can be
   purchased at the box office, (514) 739-7944.

I expect tickets for other nites to be around $20 (I haven't called
yet). The comedy runs 'till Dec 5. Saidye Bronfmann Centre general
no: (514) 739-2301.

There will be a musical next June. No details available at this
point.

Last Sunday saw a special event, a Gala Musical Review featuring
Mike Burstyn (Israel) and Joanne Borts (NY). The event, organized by
the Yiddish Consortium (as a fund-raising event), celebrated the
100th anniversary of the Monument National which recently reopened.
This was the home of the Yiddish Theater for the first half of this
century (they are now in the SBC), and many great names (including
Mike's tate) were seen/heard there.

The evening was *very* enjoyable. The first half featured Joanne in
a number of songs, mostly in Yiddish, but with some English. The
second half featured Mike Burstyn in songs and humor, a very
entertaining program. His show was multi-lingual: Yiddish, English,
Hebrew, French, and even a bit of Spanish!

But it was a tough test for someone like me who's learning. He talks
fast, in a different dialect (mamelushn anstat -loshn and no long
syllables), and when he imitates the voice of a 103 year old zayde
or a 3 year old yingl, it was hopeless. My ears obviously still need
a lot of training... But most of the audience had no trouble (and
thoroughly enjoyed themselves).
