on Mendele may have been due to network troubles rather
than a collective exile on Cape Cod.  Sorry about that. nm]

Subject: one more try

Reb Noyekh,
     let me try one more time, although it may not be
relevant anymore. It's interesting that my apologies made
it, and this poor thing got rejected 5-6 times.

Subject: tailors, movies

1. I think, Paul Weichsel owes an apology to our Ambassador
to Montreal, Zachary Baker, for changing his name to Taylor
(2.51 #3). If he said butcher, mi-meyle, but a tailor ...!
Considering the low socio-economic status of tailors (and
shoemakers, baale-melokhe in general), Zachary may
rightfully feel to be insulted. See, for instance, Reb
Tevye, who makes a deal with the respectable butcher Layzer
Wulf, only to find out that his daughter fell in love with
the poor shlemil Motl Kamizol, the tailor. Tevye is very
worried that Motl will not be able to support the family,
but one cannot convince children these days ...

2. I have no doubt that the New York area Mendeleyt saw it,
but let's bring our exiled colleagues up to date. This
Sunday's (8/2) New York Times (Book Review Section, p. 25)
had a positive review of J. Hoberman's book on Yiddish
films. The book:

Hoberman, J: Bridge of light; Yiddish film between two
worlds. New York: Museum of Modern Art / Schocken Books,
401 pp, $40.-

Subject:  Sign language

The latest issue (no. 4) of the Max Weinreich Center News
(a newsletter issued by YIVO's graduate center) contains
the following inquiry:

     We have received a query regarding the existence of a
     sign language developed for deaf or hard-of-hearing
     speakers of Yiddish.  Please write to us if you have
     any information on this.

 If any subscribers to MENDELE can shed light on this
 subject, please share it with us, directly (by writing to
 me at YIVO, 1048 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10028) or
 indirectly (through MENDELE).

Subject: Sesame & calves'-foot jelly

Eli Katz (2.55.3) asks about the Yiddish for "sesame".
Mordkhe Schaechter (Food: A Yiddish Terminology [Yiddish
title:  Mit a gutn apetit!], mimeo 1976) translates "sesame
seeds" as *der seza'm (-zoymen)*.

Some previous correspondence had to do with jellied calves'
feet (*petsha'* in my childhood home).  Schaechter gives
*petse'*.

Subject: Questions

These from subscribers:

1. Would it be fair to assume that today's Ashkenazic final
-s (aggodes, tekhines, kehilles, etc.) was also used by
Yiddish speakers 200 years ago?

2. If you already explained this, I missed it... what is
the origin of the name Mendele for this list?  There is a
street in Yerushalayim named Mendele Mocher Sforim.  Is
this person our namesake?  Who was he?
