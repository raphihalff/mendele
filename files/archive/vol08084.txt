Subject: dead language?

Regarding Comments about Ruth Wisse

In response Dovid Robboy's recent message, I can only express my total
dismay that a self-professed academic can call a language spoken by at
least
200,000. Americans (1990 U.S. census figures - a fact, not emotional
dismay,
prejudice, politics, etc.) "dead". Facing the fact that Yiddish is spoken by
an ever-growing, extremely traditional Jewish population (haredim) is
sound
scholarship. Systematically dismissing this linguistic group simply because
one does not like haredim is not sound scholarship and borders on a
blatant
misrepresentation of reality, a "crime" for academics who are committed to
educating others. If Yiddish has suffered a demise among secular Jews,
then
this does not mean that the language is dead, but rather that its group of
speakers has shifted from secular circles to more pious ones. This is a
trend in Europe and Israel as well as in America, which statistics will
amply verify.

If people disagree with Ruth Wisse's opinions, this can hardly be
considered
"bashing". Academics should be able to disagree with one another without
taking things personally. I have not read any "vicious"  comments about
Ruth
Wisse on Mendele or elsewhere. If anything, I have perceived a bitter
attitude, if not contempt, for a renewed Yiddish popularity in Ruth Wisse's
essays. Understandably, labeling a language still spoken by hundreds of
thousands "dead" just may have provoked negative comments.

For those academics who believe that haredim are not interested in
Yiddish
literature, I suggest they start reading haredi Yiddish publications where
they will find pious poetry and various forms of Yiddish narrative. A casual
glance at Yiddish language schoolbooks destined for hasidic school
children
will also contradict statements made by leading "scholars" in the field of
Yiddish, not mentioning any names in particular. For a critical analysis of
haredi literature in Yiddish, consult "London's Haredi Periodicals in
Yiddish: Language, Literature, and Ultra-Orthodox Ideology", due to appear
in "European Judaism", Autumn 1999. For reading in Yiddish, please
consult
"Yidish in der Lubavitsher Vetl un der Algemeyner Shurnal", Yerushalaymer
Almanakh, 26, 1998. For an essay on a renewed academic interest in
Yiddish
among secular Jews, consult "Yiddish and the Hebrew Revival: A New
Look at
the Changing Role of Yiddish", Monatshefte, Summer 1998.

Subject: Send no flowers

Consider a benign (but discouraging) process.  Consider the very short
step
between 1) advice that Yiddish is "irrelevant" and 2) advice that it ought
to be mourned as dead. 

One Mendelyaner recently took that step, and advised us all to mourn the
death of Yiddish. 

My advice?  Put that mourning on hold.  Better yet, forget it.

Subject: Demise of Yiddish

Concerning David Robboy's comments in defense of Ruth Wisse.  Others
have
already replied and I don't want to belabor the issue, but as a newcomer to
Mendele, I feel constrained to add my 2 cents worth.  I don't know or care
about Ruth Wisse's politics (well, maybe I do, a little), but I do care a
lot about her abandonment of Yiddish.  She may feel that the language is
dead, but the culture, the literature, the music, the traditions that still
do exist - are they destined for the trash heap of Yiddish history? 

If she loves the language, culture and literature as David stated she did,
she should be fighting to preserve it.  That's what takes real courage, not
facing the grief of losing it. 

I am not a Yiddish scholar, an "old crank" or a part of the "haredim".  I
just think that Yiddish is worth preserving and in that context, I will be
attending a program at the University of Arizona, Tucson.  The program is
being offered by Elderhostel and is entitled "In Love With Yiddish: 
Experience the richness, versatility, origins and history of the Yiddish
language and the culture surrounding it.  Become acquainted with its
idioms,
blessings and curses, its humor and proverbs.  For those interested in,
nostalgic about, or curious to discover the uniqueness of this beautiful,
resonant and vibrant language."  And this is a dying language??  Good for
Elderhostel, but should they be leading the effort to preserve YIDDISH, OR
SHOULD WE?

Subject: Baseball in Yiddish

In November 4th personal announcements, Binyumen Schaechter talks
about the
yiddish weekend in 1999 where, among other things, "Beysbol" will be
played. 
l had learned the word for baseball in Yiddish was Hilke Pilke, yet never
seem to hear it used.  Anyone know why not?

Subject: translating yiddish poetry

Ikh'll dos makhn b'kitzur. Me redt un me redt un me shushket zikh. Der iker

Zikher muz men prubirn - fun eyn zayt -- far di vos kenen kin yidish nit.

I'll make it short.We talk and we talk and we don't get to the point. The
thrust is that only in YIddish can we really understand what a Yiddish poet
wants to say. And Yiddish poetry is deeply drenched in what, in the Jewish
spirit -- even when I translated my own poetry, it was such hard work -- and
I am still not pleased with my own translations. 

Of course we have to try -- on the one hand -- for those who know no
yiddish. But again, it's better in mame loshn -- and I think it is a big sin
that those who love Yiddish so much (so they say) won't make the effort to
learn to read Yiddish. Through translations you don't come to the heart of
the poetry -- it's easier in drama and prose.  If one is already so far as
to love Yiddish poetry -- why not learn to read it? 

I'll say this part in English only because it's intended for the
English-speaking Mendelyaner specifically. Yiddish poetry is more than the
sum of its parts -- the rhyme, the meter, the cadence, the idiom -- that's
difficult enough to capture from any language into another -- but the
Yiddish poem does not exist in a vacuum -- it is wrapped up in a complex
something that eludes translation. What did the great Peretz call
translations in his words for the Czernowitz conference?  - teyte oysyes --
dead (would lifeless be better?) letters. If you are not for Yiddish
literature, who is? If not now, when ?

Subject: Clarifications for the "Translation in Forward" (08.075)

It was not my intent to be patronizing to anyone, least of all an
accomplished translator...  On the other hand it was not my intent to argue
for totally literal translations.  The amount of discussion in reaction to
my note seems to me to indicate that steering a course between highly
adaptive translations and highly literal translations is a topic that bears
discussion.  Since much of Yiddish poetry will come to future generations
in
the form of translation, it behooves us to render it in a manner that is
compatible with 20th century poetic modes so that in the eyes and ears of
those who come to it ,it will not sound quaint or stilted. In my experience
Americans are astounded when they are exposed to translations they can
relate to, astonished that Yiddish poetry can "speak" to them in today's
world. But that can be said of any translation from a prior time, place, or
culture.  Yes it is hard to translate, to translate poetry, to translate
from ANY language, not just Yiddish.

Subject: "Froyds teorye fun khaloymes" (vol. 08.081, no.1 Moishe Kijak)

The play "Froyds teorye fun khaloymes" was translated from Polish.  In the
original it is a comedy in 3 acts by Antoni Cwojdzinski (1896-1972). The
title of the original is "Freuda teoria snow". It was staged in Polish for
the first time in Teatr Maly in Warsaw in 1937. It was published (in Polish)
in the volume: A. Cwojdzinski, "Komedie naukowe", PIW, Warsaw 1968,
pp.
95-171. 

The play was translated into Yiddish by Diana Blumenfeld. It was staged
for
the first time in Yiddish in December 1938 in Biblioteka Judaistyczna
(Yudaistishe Bibliotek) at 5 Tlomackie Street. It was said to have 125
performances in Warsaw. After the end of the season in Warsaw, in June
1939,
J. Turkow and D. Blumenfeld went on a tour. It included Western Galicia
with
Cracow and Eastern Galicia with Lvov/Lemberg. In Cracow the play was
performed by Turkow and Blumenfeld (it is a two-actor play) in Zydowski
Teatr Letni (Jewish Summer Theatre) "Pawilon" at 11 Stradom from July
26 to
July 30. There were 7 performances of this play in Cracow. The total
income
from the first performance was devoted for weapon for the Polish army
preparing for the war. 

In the Warsaw ghetto J. Turkow and D. Blumenfeld performed this play on
November 8, 1941 in the same building at 5 Tlomackie Street as before the
war.

Subject: Sholem Aleichem's "Korohod"

Sholem Aleichem's "Shir hashirim"(first part,cap. 9) contains a word I
didn't find in my yiddish dictionary:.....(di karlikes) spilen ganze teg
"korohod".  The protagonist, Shymek, is speaking to Buzie of the dwarfs (di
karlikes) who are descendants of the warriors of King David's time and live
only on candies and they all dance rounds together. So Curt Leviant in his
translation of Sholem Aleichem's Shir hashirim (Simon & Schuster Editions
1996). Aliza Shevrin (A Treasury of Sholom Aleichem Children's Stories)
who
translated the first part of Sholem Aleichem's wonderful novella, translates
(p. 301): "and (the dwarfs) dance in a circle." 

The German translator, JÅrgen Rennert (Scholem Alejchem,
Schir-ha-Shirim.
Lied der Lieder. Roman einer Jugend, Suhrkamp, Frankfurt a.M.1985)
doesn't
translate this expression: "und dazu tanzen sie alle zusammen einen
zÅnftigen Kohorod".  I think "Korohod" is a dance (perhaps a slavic dance).
Is "korohod" a Russian or Ukrainian word?
