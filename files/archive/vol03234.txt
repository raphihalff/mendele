Subject: Benjamin said it first

Judah P. Benjamin did say in the US Senate prior to 1861 in a reply
to another senator," The gentleman will please remember that when
his half-civilized ancestors were hunting the wild boar in the
forests of Silesia, mine were the princes of the earth". This
putdown may or not have carried across the Atlantic, but probably
the seminary quotation was the reply made by Benjamin Disraeli (1801
-1881) in the House of Commons when taunted by Irish Daniel
O'Connel, "Yes, I am a Jew, and when the ancestors of the right
honorable gentleman were brutal savages in an unknown island, mine
were priests in the temple of Solomon". George Bernard Shaw was
certainly aware of that putdown, and adopted it in his play "Caesar
and Cleopatra". Viper-tounged, mini-brained Henry Mencken(1880-1956)
probably saw the play and adapted it to his anti-semitic insult. Vi
a tzibeleh.

Hirsh Schipper (I have not checked Caesar and Cleopatra)

Subject: math books, card games, Yiddish wordprocessing/database

To Ted Alper re math books:

Lebedintsev, K.P.  1924.  Algebre.  ibergezetst fun A.Zaretski.
Vilne: B.A. Kletskin.  184 p.  [at Harvard: Widener: Y 8512.5]

Lebedintsev, K.P.  1923.  Algebre: ershte teyl.  Idish: A.Spivak.
Kiev: Alukrainisher melukhe-farlag.  [at Harvard Microfilms:  Film A
373.249]

[BTW, unlike most of the Harvard Libraries, Government Docs and
Microfilms (which has a number of Yiddish titles on microfilm) are
open to the public/unaffiliated.  They can be accessed through Pusey
Library].

To Neach Zide re card games:

check also out:  Shmuel Vinters article "Kortn-shprakh" in
Filologishe Shriftn 1 (1926): 319-324

It gives terms for card-playing and explains them briefly.  It has
mostly references to "oke"

Query: Yiddish wordprocessing/database:

A while ago I got Nota Bene 4 and I tried using its Cyrillic/Hebrew
fonts for its database (Ibid/Ibid Plus).  Unfortunately, I don't
get the entire entry on the shorter browse-screen and it can't
search for Cyrillic/Hebrew and has some problems with diacritics
(it works, though, in the word processing program).  NB told me it
should work, but couldn't help so far  (they are working on it, I
was told). Does anyone have an idea or has had similar problems?
