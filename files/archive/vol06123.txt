Subject: Johann Heinrich Daniel Zschokke

Zschokke (1771-1848) was a german historian and author of very readable,
exciting, and thoroughly forgettable tales and novels.  i used to imbibe
him in my adolescence and, much to my embarrassment,i can barely recall
anything.  his first novel was _Abaellino der grosse Bandit_ (Abaellino
the big highwayman), and all i remember is that someone said in german,
of course) to some highly distressed damsel, "Your money or your
honor"--and I mumbled to myself "nimm doch beide, um Gottes Willen"
(take both, for God's sake)--I was not a very ethical teenager, and it's
been morally downhill for me ever since.

zschokke, who settled in switzerland (in the grisons of all places) was
immensely popular not only in german-speaking countries but in
translations as well and was apparently widely read throughout the
civilized world (if you can apply that term to europe).  the
monologist's mother in A Vayse Kapore probably lapped him up the way she
might chow down on Jacqueline Suzanne today.....   the author may be
hinting that she didn't have much taste and simply read whatever was
expected of her--I have no idea.  an equivalent yiddish author might be
Nomberg--whom I actually enjoy reading very much.  but dont go by me:
while i fully agree that flaubert was a genius, i'd much rather read
balzac anywhere, any time....

Subject: A griner shtern

Hi - I'm puzzled by a line in a poem by Anna Margolin, and wondered
whether anyone could help me out.  The poem is called "Mari un di gest,"
and is part of a cycle of poems called "Mari."  This particular poem
imagines Mary as a sort of hostess - it begins, "Mari geyt iber di
tsimern oyf un op,/tseshtelt di frukht, dem vayn, di shlanke blumen" -
but it has a hallucinatory quality to it, I think.  The phrase I'm
curious about occurs in the following context - Mary is addressing
various of her guests, and says:

	Betler, zay gegrist!  Bizt mies un finster vi a rob,
	dokh hob ikh gezen dikh lakhn vi a got
	eynmol in shney un shturem.
	Un ot iz a griner shtern, tsvey kustes fun yasmin,
	[that's the line I'm puzzled by, i.e., "a griner shtern"]
	a brunem in a hoyf - alts gest fun lite.
	Un a khasene, tseblite lust, un mentshn kep af kep,
	un gasn in virvar, un fayern lang farglite.

Any ideas? A sheynem dank,

Larry Rosenwald

Subject: Please

i'm not sure when and how the various yiddish idioms for "please"
developed as i've never done much research in pre-19th century yiddish.
since most of these formulas exist in german, i assume they were taken
into yiddish at various times:

	german                  yiddish

sei so gut                      zai azoy gut
ich bitte dich			ikh bet dikh
darf ich dich bitten...?        ken ikh dikh betn....?
bitte			        bitte (i know, i know, it's daytshmerish)
 etc......

zayt zhe moyhl, a periphrastic verb containing a loshen-koydesh
loanword, seems to be the only phrase that doesn't go back wholesale to
german....  i'm curious if there are other equivalents, perhaps
localisms.....

german "bitte" has a function that yiddish "bitte" doesnt have: it's
used in response to "danke" (thank you).  When someone thanks you, you
say, "bitte" and perhaps add "gern geschehen" (yiddish: "nisht do far
vos).   And in german you also say "bitte" when doing someone a favor,
say, handing him something that he's asked for:  "bitte".  There's no
equivalent in american english;  however in britain when you do someone
a favor, hand him, say, a book or a ticket stub, the doer of the favor
says "thank you" and is then told "thank you" by the recipient of the
favor..... and can anyone tell me the geographic spread for "tank-salat"?
