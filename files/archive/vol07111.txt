Subject: Lullaby for Jacob Feldman

I believe the lullaby that Jacob Feldman is looking for is probably "amol iz
geven a mayse".  I have been told that it is one of the oldest Yiddish
folksongs known.  It can be found in Ruth Rubin's A Treasury of Jewish
Folksong as well as in the Mlotek's mir trogn a gezang.  The version I learned
begins: 

Amol iz geven a mayse.  
Di mayse iz gortnisht freylech.  
Di mayse on geyhobt 
Mit a yidishn meylekh.

Chorus:
Lyulinke may feygele,
Lyulinke mayn kind.
Kh'ob ongevoyrn aza libe.
Vey iz mir un vind.

Susan Lerner

Subject: shpatsiren

I think this is obviously related to the German spazieren, which has been in
use for over 600 years (Middle High German). It is derived from the Italian
spaziare (to spatially expand, aimlessly walk), which in turn is derived from
the Latin spatiari. The common root is the Latin spatium (space). 

I have another question: is anybody familiar with the term "opikuress" (or
similar, I have never seen it written). I vaguely remember a story where the
term was applied to a Jew, who is very knowledgable about all rules and
commandments, but deliberately applies them in the wrong way. This was
contrasted to another Jew who ignores the rules out of ignorance.

Subject: orthography for transliterated yiddish
     
I am a new member of this list--and my yiddish is rusty, though once it was
fluent und is geven mein mamaloshen.
     
What system of transliteration into the western alphabet is used here. I
gather it originates with, or was oublished by, YIVO. 
     
Can it be found on the internet and, if so, where?

Subject: Hebrew-Aramaic words in Yiddish

Excoriating Manaster Ramer for his views on the possible origin of
_dav(e)nen_, Beni Warshawski writes:

"The Hebrew-Aramaic words are the core words in Yiddish because they
articulate Jewish religious concerns which are not expressed using words from
the dominant environment.  These words express the continuous core of Jewish
religious life and are not simply expressions which are swapped in and out
based on location or fashion." 

Hebrew-Aramaic words like _got_, _bentshn_, _leyenen_, _praven_, _treybern_,
right?

Subject: Warshawsky on davenen

I will leave it to those who know Aramaic better than I do to establish which
forms existed in Aramaic and which ones did not.  But I would like to point
out that Mr. Warshawsky completely failed to address any of the points I made
in the form of challenges for his and his informants.  Thus, I must conclude
that he is conceding that IN GENERAL informants who are not linguists canNOT
come up with correct etymologies--my main point.  Likewise, he has not
responded to my subsidiary point that, while Yiddish has many verbs based on
Hebrew words, it does not have very many based on Aramaic and in particular
not on Aramaic phrases beginning with the preposition d-. 

Mr. Warshawsky now raises two new points, on which he again simply issues ex
cathedra pronouncements instead of citing evidence.  One is that we do not
care what forms actually exist in Aramaic.  I simply cannot begin to imagine
what he means by this.  But supposing it is the correct approach, why I can we
not make anything we want?  If it does not matter wheter avanan or avinan
really existed in Aramaic, then why can we not decide that the English word
'father' comes from Chinese or that Aramaic words come from Yiddish, or
whatever else we want. In that case there is no need to do etymology at all. 
If he can make up non-existent Aramaic forms, so can anybody else, and so I
could claim that daven- itself is Aramaic, and thus "solve" the problem.  This
is just an illogical position to take. 

  The second point is that he does not accept my statement that in Eastern
Yiddish we find Romance and Germanic words being replaced by Slavic or Hebrew
ones.  To argue that this is inconsistent with a preconceived scheme of jewish
history is besides the point; it merely shows that the preconceived scheme has
no basis for it.  The idea that Hebrew forms some kind of basic core of
Yiddish has been dead for a century.  Scholars such as Weinreich and others
demonstrated that--CONTRARY TO WHAT LATE 20TH CENTURY COMMON SENSE WOULD
INDICATE--the history of Ashkenazic Jews, as reflected in language, is quite
otherwise.  It is instructive for example to read Yiddish texts from the 16th
century to the present.  You will see that the percentage of Hebrew-derived
vocabulary was much lower in the 16th century literary texts than in 20th
century ones.  This perhaps clearest when we look at Hebrew-origin verbs like
ganv(en)en, pask(en)en, and so on.  They certainly occur much more frequently
in later texts than in earlier ones.  The 16th (or is 17th, I forget) century
text Kaiser Octaviano has one just one occurrence of one such verb, namely,
ganven, for example. 

As for specific instances of the replacement of Romance by Hebrew elements,
the terms of betrothal, engagement are an obvious example.  The verb
antshpoyzn is no longer used in modern Yd (except in the archaic language of
Bible translation) and the related noun shpousering 'engagement ring' is only
attested I believe in Dutch Yiddish.  Instead of the Romance stem
shpous/shpoyz-, modern Yiddish uses the Hebrew stem knas-.  Likewise, for
'defiance', the Romance term stirdes is acc. to Weinreich unknown to many Yd
speakers today.  But, acc. to Uriel Weinreich's dictionary, we also have the
Hebrew-origin tselokhes, which is universally known. 

It is currently controversial whether the Jews who created Yiddish originally
spoke Judeo-French (Weinreich, Birnbaum, Bin-Nun), Judeo-Slavic (Wexler),
Judeo-Aramaic (Katz), or maybe Judeo-Italian, but it seems clear that they did
not speak Hebrew as their vernacular, and many Hebrew elements in modern
Yiddish clearly are of relatively recent date.  This does not mean that I am
right to suggests that davenen is derived from Hebrew and that it replace the
Romance-origin word orn, but at least that scenario is consistent with the
bigger picture.  A derivation from a non-existent Aramaic phrase beginning
with d- is unparalleled and so it does not.  And I hope Mr. Warshawsky is not
going to now argue that etymology should be done atomistically, on each word
separately, ignoring the whole history of the language.

From: Hugh Denman <uclhhfd@ucl.ac.uk>
Subject: shpatsirn

with reference to Avraham Chasid's enquiry [07.109:9] concerning the etymology
of 'shpatsirn', I think we can say with considerable confidence that the word
is directly derived from MHG 'spazieren'. True, in many comparable instances
we encounter Polish or other Slav languages in an intermediary role [cf.
'rateven' < Pol. 'ratowac' < MHG 'retten'] and in Polish there is indeed a
verb 'spacerowac', but the formant suffix '-irn' makes it clear that in this
case MHG is the immediate source. The MHG form was borrowed around the 13th
century from Italian 'spaziare/ spaziarsi' which in turn comes from Late Latin
'spatiari' (all in the same sense as the Yiddish word), a derivative of Lat.
'spatium' = 'space'.

Subject: yiddish film book

Five Leaves Publications - a small press is the UK - is to publish a new book
on aspects of Yiddish film, edited by Sylvia Paskin. The book will be aimed at
both a film studies audience and a Jewish/Yiddish interest audience. We plan
to publish in 1998, in English. Contributions already in hand include essays
on Mollie Picon, Joseph Green, the Yiddish documentaries, an overview of
Yiddish film within Jewish film, Yiddish film within Yiddish culture and more.
A nominal fee will be paid to writers whose work is used. The book will be an
illustrated paperback of roughly 240 pages. 

We are still seeking submissions... Please send ideas, abstracts and
submissions to Five Leaves Publications, PO Box 81, Nottingham NG5 4ER, UK. 

Thank you very much, zait gezunt.

Subject: The Forward and Transliteration Schizophrenia 

I guess we've enjoyed our _zibn gute khodoshim_ as regards the YIVO accepted
spelling of the word MENTSH (since last May) in the Forward Classifieds. 
Someone has "corrected" it back to _mensch_, and just when the Forverts
strides into the land of YIVO standardization. 

Isn't this an Abbot andf Costello routine in the making? _Spell it mensch.
No, that was on first.....

Subject: shpatsirn 

The etymology of shpatsirn probably goes back to the Latin specere, to look,
and so is related to the words spectacle and speculate. Thus the nuance in
shpatsirn is not so much the walking as the looking about as one tours the
neighborhood.
