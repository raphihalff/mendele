Subject: shabash

[The moderators refer readers to Mendele 23.015, 23.016, and 23.018 for previous discussion of this term.]

As I said, shabash has NO connection with the Ukraine ("shabash (shabbes) nik” seems to be a small stove and relates to shabbes and NOT to shabash!  or to Kurdistan (well maybe a Muslim connection there) --

It is a Persian-derived exclamation and means Great! Excellent! Well done!,Fabulous! etc.  So please--no Yiddish interpretations for the word are relevant.

A dank

Subject: French horn

Does anyone know how to say French horn (the musical instrument) in Yiddish?

bloz-horn? vald-horn? Something else?

With thanks

Subject:  Vartn af Godot

Dear Mendelianer,

How can I get the Yiddish translation of Godot by Shane Baker? And the DVD of the play? I have the one by Gisela Shkilnik from German. This is not the original language.

With many thanks and kind regards

Astrid

Subject: Homer in Yiddish

Does anyone work on translations of Homer into Yiddish (or know if there are
any)?  A colleague is looking for someone to write an article on the topic
for an anthology.  Please let me know if you are interested in writing for
such a project and I can put you in touch with the editors.

Subject: Morris Rosenfeld?

Can anyone identify this poem or song, which may have been written by Morris Rosenfeld on behalf of striking furriers in 1912?

Es meg di beste futer
Oykh khapen der “nit-guter”
Dos varemt uns nit, nayn!
Mir shnayden un mir neyen
Un hobn tser un veyen
Un hunger un gevayn.

Subject:  Dissertation 'Kurant'

Dear Mendelyaner,

This summer I defended my dissertation on the Kurant at the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands. The full title of the dissertation is: Arranging Reality. The Editing Mechanisms of the World’s First Yiddish Newspaper, the Kurant (Amsterdam, 1686-1687).

Follow this link for the digital edition of the dissertation: http://dare.uva.nl/record/479585

Subject:  info: "Nakht in Step"?

[Yidish do untn:]

I have in front of me a choral arrangement of a folksong entitled (at least on the score), “Nakht in Step”.  It could elsewhere be entitled simply “In Step”.  I'm looking for any information on the original poem and/or the original folksong: what book might have it, from what region/country it might emanate, etc.?  The lyrics (as they appear on the score) are as below.  Any information would be appreciated.

Ikh hob ba mir a khor-aranzhirung fun a folkslid vos heyst (lepokhes af der partitur), “Nakht in step”.  Se volt oykh gekent heysn, andersh vu, poshet “In step”.

Subject: Adam Biro

The leader of our Palm Beach Leyenkrayz, Shulamis Levine, the warm, witty, wily, wonderful (daughter of Yankov Levin, our group's learned, outstanding, Arbeter Ring mitlshul teacher and motivator, author, Nayvelt camp director, etc.,) is searching for information about author Adam Biro. Are any of his books in Yiddish?

She has discovered that he has written “Two Jews on a Train” and “Do It For Jews,” and one is also in Hungarian.

Thank you for any answers.

Subject: di grine kusine author(s)

I found this information about the song “di grine kuzine” in Milken Archive:

“Abe Schwartz was the first to copyright this tune and its lyrics (though the music copyright is only for his arrangement), but one Yankele Brisker, pseudonym for Jacob Leiserowitz, also claimed copyright for the lyrics, listing the tune as a “folk melody.” Yet a third claimant to the song was Hyman Prizant. Eventually it was republished and re-copyrighted, crediting Prizant with only the lyrics and Schwartz with the music—although again, in a particular arrangement. Meanwhile, Leiserowitz initiated a lawsuit, but did not prevail. Still, the truth about the authorship is impossible to know. “

Besides, in the book “Mir trogn a gezang”, Eleanor Gordon Mlotek mentions the copyright crediting Prizant and Schwartz, but attributes the lyrics to J. Leiserowitz.

Does anyone have more informations on who did really write the lyrics of the song, and from where the melody was taken, before Abe Schwartz arranged it?

A dank in foroys,

Subject: farhaken a koo

My father-in-law's White Russian grandfather was known to be able to 'farhaken a koo'; to stop a straying cow in its tracks by sticking a knife or hatchet into a wall and saying some sort of spell. As far as I can tell, the only other mention of this can be found in a yizkor-bukh from the town Lenin, also in White Russia. Has anyone else ever heard of such a thing, and is it attested anywhere else or among other ethnic groups? The closest I have seen is in 19th century Pennsylvania, where placing an open pair of scissors in a bible would cause the cow to return, after reading some chapter in the bible...
