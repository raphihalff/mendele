Subject: Some notes on shayle, kashe, etc.

Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter treats the Yiddish names for "question" in his
book, Laytish Mame-loshn.  There are four words in Yiddish for question,
as listed by Uriel Weinreich's dictionary: di shayle--s, di frage--s, di
kashe--s, der freg--n.  As I recall from Dr. Schaechter's book, shayle
was most common historically; its use was far from restricted to the
religious shayles vetshuves of rabinnic discourse, as some have here
suggested.  Frage is perhaps today more common, having been adopted into
Yiddish from German around the haskole period.  Note that the standard
plural ending is --s in Yiddish, rather than --n, as in German.

The authentic Eastern Yiddish Germanic-derived word for question is freg
(the verb to ask is fregn).  In modern standard Yiddish, freg is rarely
used, except in the formula /ton a freg--er hot a freg geton/.  Western
Yiddish, I believe Dr. Schaechter remarks, had a noun /frog/, but this
word did not enter the literary language of today.  Another word for
question in Yiddish is kashe, derived, not from Hebrew, but from Aramaic
(Targem-loshn).  The root means hard or difficult.  Thus a kashe tends to
denote a harder or more weighty question.

The toughest questions of all, the "million dollar question," is called a
/klots-kashe/, which Weinreich defines as a perplexing question.  A
klots-kashe may also refer to a foolish question.  "klots" is Yiddish for
a log or wooden beam--perhaps the alternative meanings for klots-kashe
derive from the different meanings of klots.  A klotz (English klutz
borrowed from Yiddish) is something of a clumsy buffoon (a _foolish_
question), whereas a wooden beam is a central supporting structure of
hard wood, explaining a _hard central_ question.  Hope this helps.

Subject: Kashe

Harvey Spiro states (4.315) that "kashe" stems from the Hebrew adjective
ka-SHEH ›hard, difficultº.  While that relationship might exist
linguistically, the more direct source for thhe Yiddish word is the
Aramaic Kushia, meaning "question."  The Four Questions on Passover (in
Yiddish: fir kashes) are known in Hebrew\Aramaic as arba` kushiyyot.

Subject: Why Study Yiddish?

Dear Dr. Sherman,

I have spent the past week since reading your request attempting to
discern my own motives for studying Yiddish.  I have several reasons for
studying Yiddish, ranging from a sense of historical moral imperative to
personal pleasure, but through them all runs a thread of personal
identity and belonging.

I am in awe, that today, fifty years after the Holocaust, Yiddish not
only survives but flourishes, albeit mainly in religious and academic
enclaves and not the greater populace.  I take great pleasure in the
realization that here I am, a gentile in Columbus, Ohio, at the Ohio
State University, studying and teaching Yiddish.  This is a triumph of
the human spirit, a living memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, and
a celebration on the graves of those murderers who would have destroyed
all traces of Yiddishkeyt from the world.

I am a student of languages; Yiddish, Hebrew, Aramaic, Spanish, German,
French, and English; and with the exception of English which is my native
tongue, I have not found such joy or life in any language but Yiddish.
English is my native tongue, but Yiddish is my Mame Loshn.  I guess I am
less a student of Yiddish than an adopted son.  Yiddish is the language
of a people, of a folk, not of a state or country.  It has been said that
this has been one of Yiddish's shortcomings, but I submit that it is one
of Yiddish's strengths.

One can study German, French, or Spanish, and then go to a specific
geographic locale where the inhabitants speak that language.  Yiddish
however, is a beautiful disembodied spirit which possesses you, and makes
you its own. Wherever Yiddish is spoken there is Ashkenaz.  Yiddish is a
language which defines its own boundaries, while all other languages are
defined by their boundaries.

Why should one study Yiddish?  First, we must obey the 614th Mitzvah and
remember the Holocaust.  Yiddish is more than a living memorial, it is a
bridge to the past which allows us to revisit that world which has ceased
to exist.

The most important motive which I can offer up is that most personal and
perhaps even selfish.  Yiddish is life, it is a living, breathing entity,
of countless age and boundless wisdom, which, when embraced takes one in
her arms as a wise old grandmother, and with infinite love and patience
passes on to us her wisdom, experience and sense of humor.  This is the
language I love, and my purpose is to know her better.

Matt Dailey
