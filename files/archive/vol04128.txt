Subject: A "shul" by & for ameratsim?

Mikhl Herzog (4.122,2) had already commented on Howard Kaplan's threat
"it's time for a schism" (4.119,4).  As the one who critisized Pinker's
Yiddish sentence I'd would like to add a word or two of my own.

Perhaps Howard will tell us what he's so wrought up about?  Is it the
grammarians who disturb him so much, or what he calls disparagingly the
"correctniks"?

Who are "the rest of us," he refers to, who can now "be on our merry way
as language free spirits, literature enjoyers, joke tellers"?  The
anti-grammarians?

Is the literature Howard enjoys devoid of any language rules?   Does he
spell haphazardly in his own writing, with wanton inconsistency, in an
"anything goes" hodgepodge?

I wonder if he vehemently objected to his teachers' demands that he speak
and write according to accepted conventions of language usage, that he
adhere to rules of grammar and syntax, or he gets particularly worked up
and irked ONLY when such demands are made with regard to Yiddish?

That would be revealing, wouldn't it?  Just as his so-called joke about
"correctniks" who dwell upon the problem of a hyphen between
anal-retentive, reveals a great deal that I would as soon leave it
unsaid.  v'hamEYvin yOvin.

My own contribution to the repertoire of jokes Howard proposes for his
new network concerns the ameratsim (ignorants) who objected to the fact
that only those who knew "ivre" (who could read "di kleyne pintelekh"),
were called to the reading of the Torah.  They decided to establish their
own shulkhl (small synagogue) to be called "di ameratsishe shul"...

Subject: Re: Di Dray Bern

Since Harvey Spiro wrote in Mendele, Vol 4.114,4, we have received
several inquires about our book, "di dray bern, mirele-goldherele
antshuldikt zikh."  The book and tape are available from ourselves at
2209 Greenery Lane, Silver Spring, Maryland 20906, the Workmen's Circle
Book Store, NY (Steve Dowling), National Yiddish Book Center, MA,
Border's Childrens' Book Store at White Flint, Rockville, MD, and
Lisbon's Hebrew Books and Gifts, Wheaton, Maryland.

The Book/Tape retails for $18 plus postage. Individually - Book, $13 +
postage    Audio-Tape, $7 + postage.

For my fellow Mendeleniks we're offering $1 off each, $2.50 off the B/T.
That's $15.50 + postage and free handling.  Checks are payable to our
nonprofit organization, Jewish Educational Workshop, which piblished the
Book/Tape.

Dr. Bilik was my main editor for the work.  And we were fortunate to have
Dov Noy, Rabbi Noah Golinkin, Naomi Kadar, Henia Lewin, and Leonard Wolf
review our book before we published it.  The exquisite Hebrew typeset was
done by James Kapplin of The Ethnic Press of Baltimore and my artist
sister, Fayga Williams drew the charming illustrations.  The audio-tape
contains original music by Paul Frank, enhancing the Yiddish telling of
the story.  Arnold Kuzmack offered invaluable help computing the English
printing.  The 60 page spiral-bound book is written in Yiddish with a
facing page of English and transliteration, an alphabet key at the end,
and vowel help on the bottom of many pages.

Thank you Harvey, for bringing this to our attention.  "Zayt ale bagrist
mit frayndlekhn grusn."

Subject: On Reverends and Rabbis

My grandfather, Samuel A. Baker (alevasholem) -- to whom I am indebted
for teaching me Yiddish -- was the proud bearer of the title Reverend.  A
1912 graduate of the Teachers' Institute of the Jewish Theological
Seminary of America (his diploma, which is a family keepsake, is signed
by Rabbi Solomon Schechter, Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, and Mr. Louis
Marshall), he steadfastly refused the title Rabbi, preferring instead to
be called Reverend.  During his long career, he bounced from post to
post, and city to city (New York, Roanoake, Newburgh, Brooklyn, Canton
[Ohio], Norfolk, Rochester, Minneapolis), teaching recalcitrant bar
mitzvah bokherim their haftores, leyening Torah, serving as a bal-tfile
--in general acting as a synagogue factotum, not as the leader of a
congregation. He was the product of a Conservative seminary, but was not
ordained as a rabbi.  In his era, "Reverend" was a title commonly adopted
by those who performed various religious roles but did not occupy
pulpits.  Some were undoubtedly charlatans, and use of the title strikes
the present-day listener as quaint at best, but Reverend Samuel A. Baker
was not ashamed to be called Reverend -- indeed, he insisted on it.

My grandfather died in 1975, at the age of about 84 (we don't know for
sure how old he was).  After his death, our family established Reverend
S. A. Baker Memorial Scholarships (for a student attending the Uriel
Weinreich Summer Yiddish Program) and one at the National Yiddish Book
Center (for their summer study program).

Subject: World Script

Macintosh users now have the option of using World Script for System 7
that allows standard applications that support World Script to mix Hebrew
(Yiddish) and and English (as well as other non-Roman alphabets) in the
same document. I believe that Nisus and Word Perfect support World
Script.

Subject: A talk by John Hollander on his Halpern translations

Mendelniks in the Boston area or near to it might be interested in
knowing that the poet John Hollander will be giving a talk about
(and a reading of) his translations of Moyshe-Leyb Halpern, at
Wellesley College, Thursday, October 20th, at 4:30, in the
English Department Common Room, 106 Founders Hall.  The talk is free.
Hollander's translations of Halpern are in my opinion really brilliant -
virtuosic ventriloquism, if you'll pardon the alliteration.  If
people are interested in coming to the talk but don't know how to
get to it, let me know and I'll send you directions.
