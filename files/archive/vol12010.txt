history, society and culture of Ashkenazic Jewry and to the influence
of that culture as it developed in the Americas. As the only
pre-Holocaust scholarly institution to transfer its mission to the New
World, YIVO is at the core of the renaissance of interest in the lives
of Eastern European Jews and their descendants. The YIVO Library

Subject: "Hof un gleyb"

The words and music of "Hof un gleyb" are found on page 86 of Pearls of
Yiddish Song, compiled by Eleanor and Joseph Mlotek (Workmen's Circle,
1988).  The words are by Y.L. Peretz and music by Eliyohu Hirshin.  As
the Mloteks note, the version sung differs from Peretz's version in the
last line.  The original poem has "keyver", not "vinkl"...

Hof, hof, hof,
Nit vayt iz shoyn der friling.
Es veln shmeterlingen shpringen,
Naye nestn, naye feygl
Veln naye lider zingen.

Gleyb, di nakht iz shoyn farshvundn,
Un di volkns oykh tserunen,
Bloy vet zayn, vet zayn der himl,
Naye shtern, naye zunen.

Naye royzn, naye blumen
Veln blien, vaksn hoykh.
Es vet shaynen, shmekn, zingen,
Un in undzer vinkl oykh!

(Have hope.  Spring is not far off.  Butterflies will fly.  New nests,
new birds will sing new songs.  Have faith.  The night has already
passed and the clouds have also dispersed.  The sky will be blue with
new stars and new suns.  New roses, new flowers will bloom and grow
tall.  There will be light, frangrance and song in our lives as well.)

A groysn dank in faroys!

I am writing a Ph.D. thesis on the oldest Yiddish newspaper, the
Dinstagishe un Fraytagishe Kurantn, that were published in Amsterdam in
the seventeenth century. Remaining copies date from August 1686 till
December 1687. That is, they got lost in the seventies when they were
being transferred from Ets Haim, the library of the Portuguese
synagogue in Amsterdam, to the National Library in Jerusalem. Some say
they were stolen. Nobody knows (well, hardly anybody). Fortunately we
still have photos, photocopies and microfilms of the Kurantn, but if
someone can tell me where I can find the real ones, I will be immensely
grateful. And possibly somewhere in the world still other copies of the
Kurantn can be found. If you can tell me more about it, you are most
welcome!

Thanks a lot in advance!

Subject: another plea re new books

May I once again plead with Mendelyaner who commend new books to us? As
I have said before, I'm sure I'm not the only subscriber to Mendele who
is responsible for proposing Yiddish books for acquisition for a major
library. At my institution we buy one or more copies of everything in
Yiddish, on Yiddish and translated from or into Yiddish, but wh have to
have the full bibliographical details before we can place an order. It
is a very welcome practice that authors (and their relatives, friends
or heirs) take the trouble to announce their books in Mendele. In fact,
it would be highly desirable if more authors and publishers would do
likewise. However, to save time-consuming correspondence, could I enter
a plea that when anyone is announcing a new volume, she or he should
give full bibliographical information in the following format:

author's or editor's surname, first name or initials of author or
editor [in this case marked "ed."], _title of book: subtitle of book_,
tr. name of translator if any, names of foreword and introduction
writers, brief details of illustrations, maps etc., number of volumes
[if more than one] [series title], place of publication: publisher,
date of publication, total number of pages [the last page number
actually printed in the book]pp. [ISBN: X-XXXX-XXX-X], price (cloth/
paperback, if known).

 Or, to take a recent example:

Rozenberg Jedwab, Lena, _Girl with Two Landscapes: The Wartime Diary of
Lena Jedwab_, tr. Solon Beinfeld, foreword Irena Klepfisz, intro. Jan
Gross, photos & map, New York: Holmes & Meier, 2002, 218pp. [ISBN:
0-8419-1427-3], $24.95 (cloth).

Incidentally, those of you who followed the links that Doroth‚e
Rozenberg gave in her contribution to Mendele of 10 October will have
been able to read Mikhal Krutikov's _Forverts_ review of her mother's
diary in the original, clearly an important publication which I for one
had missed when it first came out, viz:

Rozenberg-Yedvab, Lena, _Fun heym tsu navenad: milkhome-togbukh
1941-1945_, intro. Yitskhok Niborski, Paris: the author's husband,
1999, ???pp. [no ISBN] [available from the Bibliotheque Medem,
<medem@yiddishweb.com>}.

Subject: Spinoza in Yiddish

To answer to Kay Schweigmann-Greve (Mendele vol. 12.007)

The Yiddish writer Moyshe Broderzon (Moscow 1890-Warsaw 1956) wrote a
theater play with Spinoza as the main character. This play, "Salve
Benedikte" was published in the Warsaw periodical "Vokhnshrift far
literatur" nø 40 (september 30, 1932), p. 3 and nø 41 (November 4,
1932) p. 7, and later in : Moyshe Broderzon, Forshtelungen, Lodz 1936,
132 pp., pp. 16-27

Subject: Do a Deer

My deepest thanks to Margie Schonhaut for her very accurate and very
generous tribute to my brother, Nat Zumoff. I do not have all the
words, but the interested reader can get them in one of two places:
from Nat himself (Normandy P-736, Kings Point, Delray Beach, Florida
33484, or from Zalmen Mlotek, at the Folksbiene, 45 East 33rd Street,
New York, NY 10016. The Folksbiene has made "Do a Deer" a prominent
feature of its "Kids and Yiddish" presentations.

Subject: Bund exhibit at YIVO

Re the following words in Paul Glasser's announcement of a YIVO
exhibit, which appeared in Mendele, Vol. 12.009:

"The Bund, a political party whose history on Polish soil begins in
1918, with the establishment of the Polish Republic"

The Bund may have begun its life as a formal political party in Poland
in 1918, but it was an active organization in Warsaw, Lodz, et.al from
the Bund's inception in 1897. This included legal municipal electoral
activity, which was actively encouraged by the German occupation
authorities.  If Paul Glasser's statement is intended to describe the
time frame and other (electoral?) limits of the exhibit, that should be
made clear.

I am very interested in the work done by the Bund prior to and during
the first World War, so the above formulation gave me quite a start.

Subject: Yiddish translation of "Anne of Green Gables"

Please forgive if I have asked this before... I have heard rumours of
the existence of a Yiddish translation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's famous
1908 novel, "Anne of Green Gables". Has anyone on the list come across
a copy? Hebrew University's ALEPH online catalogue does not show one
there. Any suggestions as to where I might look?

A shynem dank!
