Subject: rock on my heart

Pamela Quilt asks (7.125) about the Yiddish equivalent to 'rock on my heart'.
Let me be one of the many to respond:  es ligt mir vi a shteyn oyfn harts (and
several slight variants, often preceded by a heartfelt oy!) 

On another topic:

I became a loyal mendelayner less than a year ago and remained unaware of the
genesis of the group until it was outlined by mikhl herzog (7.124) I had heard
a great deal about mendele long before I got wired up however.

There aren't that many Yiddish users in the world. Can't we few get along? I
did not expect to tap into the world of liguistics, but it has been a
serendipitous addition for me. Some I tune out, but much of the academic
discussion I find stimulating and rewarding. Why must this be a zero-sum game? 

Is it an onerous task to answer such kashes as Pamela Quilts? Yes, I'm sure
someone will refer her to a learned tome that she should have tried before
asking mendele. But I get a big extra kick out of mendele by being able to
help someone else. No can do if I'm restricted to reading only the learned
writings of academics! And if academics only speak to academics, where does
that get us? That sounds like a twist on something out of Gulliver's Travels.
nisht shayn! 

Please! Let us all enjoy this precious little community of maziks, nudniks and
even outright narishe layt. lozt mikh yetst op. ikh gey davenen---in the
subjunctive, of course.

Subject: Dobrushin

Now that we have some biobibliography and a bit of hagiography in place
regarding Yekheskl Dobrushin, has anyone read him?  I have a little, and found
in him a familiar chronology of intellectual twisting and turning in
ideological winds.  I would be grateful if anyone can add to my limited
impressions, which focus on Dobrushin's writings touching on the interplay
between nationalism, folklore, and children's literature. 
     
Some of the changing positions taken by Dobrushin in his discussions of
Yiddish literature for children follow (I paraphrase something I wrote
elsewhere): 
     
     1919: Dobrushin argues that the absence of moralizing and ideology in 
     primitive folk art makes it attractive and appropriate for children. 
     ("Primitive Folk Art and the Art Book for Children," _Gedankenfang_, 
     1922)
     
     1932: Dobrushin denounces his earlier critical writings as formalist 
     and nationalist (introduction to _In Iberboy_).  In "The Social 
     Evolution of the Yiddish Lullaby," (post?)dated 1922, Dobrushin 
     divides Yiddish lullabies into those that express national and 
     "mercantile" yearnings, those that express proletarian yearnings, and 
     those that express a conflict between the two. Folk art is here seen 
     [in the revised and guarded eyes of the early 1930s] in terms of 
     ideology, and Jewish and proletarian perspectives are posited 
     (damningly for the former) as mutually exclusive. While he does not 
     return to the issue of fairy tales at this point, the emphasis on 
     ideological content reverses his position on the benefits of 
     ideology-free children's literature.
     
     1935: Now Dobrushin follows the revised official position on fairy 
     tales, articulated by Gorky and Marshak in 1934, which (1) calls for 
     the creation of new fairy tales with revolutionary morality and (2) 
     rediscovers traditional folktales as a reflection of the "common 
     people and their relation to their labor."  Previously the official 
     position on fairy tales was that they were distractions from hard 
     reality that encouraged passivity, superstition, and childhood fears 
     (e.g., Krupskaya, 1926).  Dobrushin argues in 1935 that fantasy built 
     on accounts of witches and goblins and spirits (by using their Yiddish 
     names he identifies superstition in Yiddish folklore as Jewish 
     superstition) is destructive or dangerous in that it undermines the 
     child's belief in causality and enforces fears and faith in magic. On 
     the other hand, Dobrushin now also recognizes the possibility of  
     positive fantasy that reflects the child's natural way of exploring 
     and actually strengthens the child's ties to the real world.  Thus 
     Dobrushin is again prepared to allow for fantasy without ideology and 
     also sees the need for fantasy for children that encourages approved 
     ideological thinking.  ("On Children's Poetry," _Sovyetish, 
     literarisher almanakh_, #3.)
     
Can anyone describe other aspects of Dobrushin's work first hand?

Subject: "In Ades"

The track of "In Ades" that I own sounds reasonably clear for transliteration.
It's called "KLEZ" by Vanguard CV79449. The liner notes refer to it as from a
mid-twenties musical, "Volodke in Ades," and expresses the joy of being young
in the cosmopolitan port of Odessa, telling the story of pretty girls dancing
and flirting with handsome officers. The notes allude to the song the group
heard recorded by Charles Cohen and the Nat Shilkret Orchestra. Mit
freundshaft.

Subject: "fonye" 

Re "fonye" from "Vanya", the stereotypical Russian soldier, this is common
as army slang as well as ethnic slang in general, note "Fritz" for a German
soldier, as well as patties, micks, bobbies [British cops], hymies, etc...
In this regard, the Russians used ?"Fony" for the Germans (in WWI only?),
from the common prefix "Von",   so I've wondered if there were Yiddish
speakers in the Russian army who called their fellow Russians "fonje" and
the enemy "Fony"--it could get confusing!

Subject: a shtayn ayf mayn harts and Yiddish maps

I find it humorous that yiddish expressions which I grew up with would be used
in English by an elderly lady!  Yes, the use of "a shtayn ayf mayn harts"
accompanied by a deep sigh was frequestly used when remembering someone who
had died as well as when a child was a little naughty or did not complete a
responsibility or a promise was not kept. It was "heavy" with sadness and
caused a lot of guilt!  To David Herskovic, I will send the words to khanike
oy khanike to you directly.  It would take up too much if printed in Mendele,
Hokay?  To Miriam Isaacs who is seeking mapn, tryl Avotaynu........maps
galore!!!! Old one, currant ones,individual and in collections.....they have
them for you !  A guten, gesuntn Chanukah mit fill lotkes far yeder eyner !

Subject: hekdesh, not hegdesh

I would like to elaborate on the word hekdesh (not hegdesh) which Milt Eisner
(Vol. 07.122) asked about and to which Wolf Krakowski responded (Vol.07.125). 
Yes, Hekdesh was, as W.K. points out, the town's poorhouse where people
congregated and was a place of commotion and disorder, hence the connotation
in general of hekdesh as a place of disorder. 
--Hekdesh is a yiddish word based in the Hebrew word Kadosh/holy.
--Kadosh is a combination of two words Hebrew words, Kad Aish, burning by fire.
--A sacrifice was called Kadosh because it was burned in fire
--Every sacrifice was designated  holy and separate,hence the meaning of
kadosh as separate.
--In Chumash Devarim we see the negative use of  the concept of kadosh-
separate- in the use of the word Kadeshe for  a harlot, who separated herself
from society.
--The poorhouse was designated for a certain segment of the people, the poor,
who were separate from society-- hence the word hekdesh.  
--And from the disorder of the Hekdesh/poorhouse came the general sense of
hekdesh-- a mess, disorder, baalagan, etc.

Subject: Shuls and Temples

Stephen Berr's kind words of encouragement (07.122) inspire the following
thoughts on the distinctions between shuls and temples.

Most obvious, of course, is the fact that in a shul people daven (Ikh bet aykh
mir tzu antshuldikn), while in a temple, they pray.  This raises yet another
shayle, vos heist davenen k'neged prayer?  Az m'davent, muz men shoklen, l'fi
minhag hamakom.  In some venues, the shoklen is forth and back, in others it
is right and left; in most Galitzianer shuls, as well as in Ungarishe shuls, a
proper shokl is very vigorous, so that if one arrives early enough, lemoshl,
on shabbes, one can get a thorough aerobic workout before Toyre leynen, with a
suitable cool-down period during Musaf.  In Yekeshe shuls, on the other hand,
shoklen, if it occurs at all, is heavily internalized.  One works up a sweat
simply from the intense concentration and rigid silence.  Silence in other
shuls is assiduously avoided.  In fact, with rare exceptions, a simple
auditory measure will determine whether one is in a shul or a temple. The
higher the decibel reading, the more likely one is to be in a shul.

A corollary to the auditory measure is the giggle measure.  In most shuls,
children are everywhere.  They dart in and out and all about, running to and
fro with gay abandon, sitting on strangers' laps when they can't find their
own parents, or maybe because they like the strangers better since they are
more likely to provide them with sweets.  Most of them are happy except during
the rabbi's sermon, when the younger ones are most likely to need diaper
changes or to burst out in heart-rending cries, inspired, no doubt, by the
tragic events of our people's past. 

In temples, children are remarkably silent.  In order to create and maintain
proper temple decor, some have installed crying rooms--soundproof studios in
which mothers with small children and emotional bubbes and zeydes can cry to
their hearts' content without disturbing those who are intent on praying in
decorous silence. 

One does not shokl in a temple unless one has come from an uncouth shul
background or does not mind standing out as a stanger or a greenhorn. 
Conversation is out of the question, even during the Torah reading.  A temple-
goer sits in respectful silence throughout the "service" (NOT the "davenen'),
either listening or pretending to listen to the performance that is taking
place on the stage, or, as it is sometimes called, the bimah. 

In many shuls, people seem to have the quaint idea that what happens is a kind
of do-it-yourself thing with a kind of loose connection between the oylam and
the goings-on at the bimah.  In many temples, on the other hand, the emphasis
is on the performance, which the attendees are encouraged to participate in by
serving as a kind of chorus from time to time.  Their only calisthenics are in
response to frequent interruptions by the emcee, who intones such phrases as
"Please rise" and "You may be seated."  Well-trained temple goers respond
swiftly to flowing hand gestures, often done quite dramatically: a two-handed
palms up outstretched rising motion for "Please rise" and the reverse for "You
may be seated." 

The decor of many temples is enhanced by the tones of the mighty Wurlitzer,
which does not rise up from the bowels of the temple as it used to do at the
local Paramount or Radio City Music Hall, but still makes a great impact. 
Shuls rarely have organs.  Khazonim only performed with organs (in the old
days) when they were making scratchy records. 

In some shuls, during boring stretches, folks chat with one another in an
amiable way or engage in vociferous arguments about whatever happens to move
them--ranging from the sidrah to politics to the Yankees.  In the old days,
especially on Yom Kippur, some of the men would pass snuff or smelling salts
around.  We don't see much of that any more. 

The distinction between shuls and temples is fading, at least on the more
liberal side.  Khazonim are being displaced by khazontes, and rabbis--not by
rebbetzins, which is a special category--but by rabbontes.  In both, one finds
women wearing taleysim and yarmulkes, though one is not likely to find anyone
of either sex sporting tefillin. 

One thing all shuls and temples have in common is a sumptuous feast after
davenen or services, often called a kiddush.  This can range from a little
herring with kikhelekh and schnapps at the smaller shuls to more elaborate
offerings at the larger ones, and even to shrimp cocktail and escargot at the
really fentzy-shmentzy temples when there's a major bar or bat mitzvah. 

When it comes to diversity, a major concern these days, we needn't look much
further than the yiddishe folk.  We have it all.

Subject: Yiddish expression: A shtayn afn harts

Pamela quilt asked if a stone on my heart comes from Yiddish. The answer is
yes. "s'ligt mir vi a shtayn afn harts" (purists please forgive my
Galitsianish tendencies, but the other doesn't work for me.) This expression
is quite commonly used as a way of expressing ongoing sorrow.  Stones seem to
figure largely in Yiddish metaphorical expression. "Ikh bin geblibn vi
farshtaynert. " is "I remained as if frozen. Yiddish doesn't use "stoned" to
mean -overuse of drugs, however. My favorite, "Afile a vorem inter a shtayn
vil lebn".  "Even a worm under a rock wants to live."
