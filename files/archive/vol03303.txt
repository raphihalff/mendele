Subject: Re:Sholem Aleichem's yortsayt

Meyer David asks about the exact English and Hebrew calendar dates of
Sholem Aleichem's death.  He died on May 13, 1916.  It was the 10th of
Iyar.  My calculation makes it 5676.

Subject: Name origin & Sholem Aleykhem's yartzayt

In Mendele 3.299, Mikhl Herzog <BM.YIB@RLG.Stanford.EDU> asked:

>"Siegel" is, as a rule, an acronym for Hebrew "sgan levi". Whence
>does it derive in your case? Is it German 'seal'?

Could be.  Apparently some makers of signets received the name "Siegel".
Another etymology I've read about is a (southern German) diminuitive of
the first name "Siegfried", "Siegele" or "Siegel".  While I can't rule
out a Jewish origin, there is nothing to confirm it.

In Mendele 3.302, Meyer David (mhd@world.std.com) asked:

>Could someone please supply the exact English and Hebrew dates of Sholem
>Aleichem's death?  Thanks.

Shalom Rabinowitsh died in New York on 10th of Iyyar, 5676 (May 2nd,
1916).

Subject: Introduction

Hello. David Ferleger here. New to internet. Lawyer - do civil rights
law. Child of Holocaust survivors - my mother was in the Warsaw Ghetto
till it was destroyed and then in Maidanek and Auschwitz etc. And my
father, from Chmielnick, Poland, survived in a hole under a stable.

So I grew up hearing Yiddish and Polish both. I understand a bissel
Yiddish, but dont speak Yiddish. And found this little mail list as I
looked for Yiddishe places in Internet.

I live in Philadelphia, PA USA.

Subject: The Yiddish word "Tren"

Jack Lubowsky comments that he thought the Yiddish word "tren" meaning
sexual intercourse was a family in-word and was not aware that it was a
general Yiddish term for the act (though it is more vulgar than the
rather medicinal "sexual intercourse").

The word gave rise to a Hollywood-cum-radio joke that dealt with two
characters.  (And if you don't see this one coming from a mile away, you
need glasses.)  The male actor was George Brent, and the fictional radio
personality was (you guessed it) Helen Trent.

The joke was "George Brent while Helen Trent."   Does it need a
translation?

The word is also important in the telling of the joke about the visit to
the zoo of an old man and his grandson.  The grandson gave a running
commentary in Yiddish on the various animals that they were seeing. When
they came to the laughing hyena, the grandson described it in the
following way: "Ehr pisht  ein mohl a vokh, Ehr kahkt ein mohl a monat,
Ehr tren ein mohl a yohr" to which the grandfather replied "Und dos is
die lechedickeh chaya?  Vos lochet ihr?"

Subject: Bessarabish loshn

I saw Ellen Prince's name on some earlier postings (I've only been on
Mendele a couple of weeks now, Zachary Baker of YIVO having referred me).
I'll never forget about 8 years ago she was on the Forverts Sho on WEVD
with Moishe Rosenfeld, and she discussed Sarah Gorby, and we heard so
many great (and sad) tunes.Ellen remarked what I myself have noticed that
Romania and Bessarabia (the latter now the Former Soviet Republic
Moldova) produced a lot of music, and coincidentally, influenced my
Yiddish pronunciation, since I love Yiddish music and have been exposed
to a lot of it since my teens.  Anyway, Sarah Gorby was from Kishiniev,
in Bessarabia and sings like the Malke haYofi (hope I got that right; I
know I'm close).

I remember when I was eighteen, living in D.C., and there weren't very
many Yiddish speakers around that I knew of. Down the block aways was a
little bakery, manned by a charming older couple from Argentina. I was
still a native speaker of Spanish then, having come from Peru in 1961,
and I detected an accent. Well, I asked and they said they were Jews from
Bessarabia. We switched out of Spanish into Yiddish and I was struck deaf
and dumb. I remembered from Weinreich's College Yiddish that there were
dialects, but this was really epes andersh. Khob gehat keynmol nisht
gehert azoyns! They goofed on me a lot, because of my Litvak
pronunciation, and they told me some of the peculiarities of the way they
spoke. They told me that for them "wood" and "everything" were pronounced
the same: Olts. For me it was a real eye-opener. I really like the way it
sounds. Moyshe Oysher olevhasholem was from there too. Two features I
especially like are the raising of final e to almost an i. Also,
darkening the a to o, so you get "toti" instead of tate.

Ellen's presentation was interesting from an intellectual standpoint,
too, and since I'm from everywhere I especially liked her discussion of
dialect shift. I arrived here at age 8 with a British/Latin accent that
within four years shifted to inner Tidewater pronunciation. And when I
speak Yiddish, I move from the literary standard to the stage
pronunciation very easily, since that's what I hear when I hear
performances, by and large.

It's funny how life is; in 1970 there weren't that many secular people
speaking Yiddish, least of all a gentile like myself. It was a real koved
when I was asked to m.c. a Yiddish radio program; the two older men that
asked me were involved with broadcasting, and they said that my
pronunciation was pretty good. We talk about daytshmerizms -- I've been
told that my speech has no trace of the German I heard all around me
during my youth. That for me is the nicest compliment I ever heard.

Anyway, before I ramble further, I just want to say that I have met other
non-Jews who for various reasons have learned Yiddish and speak it well.
That's a phenomenon that doesn't get discussed much, but I'm sure Polish
servants in Jewish houses spread the use of words like "altinke"
kleyninker, etc.
