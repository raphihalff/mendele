Subject: Introduction

It boggles my mind to create an association between the
computer, symbol of the future, and the Yiddish language,
whose future is so uncertain.

As for myself, I spoke Yiddish until I went to kindergarten.
Thereafter, my parents spoke Yiddish and we answered in
English. When I went off to college, the first week, my
mother wrote me a letter in English and wrote in
parentheses within the letter that she hoped she had
spelled a certain word correctly.  I wrote back that I
didn't care how she spelled, and why didn't she just write
in Yiddish and thus avoid the whole problem, if it was of
concern to her.  That is how I learned how to read Yiddish.
Of course, this story dates me, since who sends letters to
their kids in college nowadays.

In the last year, I read about 150 pages of Grade's "Der
Yeshiva" , a book that I read years ago in English
translation.  Both my parents come from that world in a
sense, and so it was an incredible experience for me to
read it in Grade's beautiful Yiddish.

[Steve Dubin (Vol2.27) asks about Maurice Schwartz)]

re maurice schwartz, he's been dead for many years--at
least 30, i think. i can find out for sure--he was the
uncle of a cousin (by marriage) of mine. she's out west at
the moment visiting her daughter, but i'll check with her
as soon as she comes back.

don't know of tapes of his theatre work, but there are
certainly videotapes of at least some of his movies. even
my local little video store around the corner carries
'tevye der milkhiker' (i *think* that's the title) and a
few others. if yours doesn't, request them!

Subject: That old refrain

Sholem Ruveyn Benjamin takes the shames to task for having,
in an unguarded moment, expressed his feelings about borsht
circuit Yiddish.  Darned shames!  Thinks he can get away
with that tired and discredited cultural elitism.

But the shames, being older than he'd like to be, figures
it this way: koydem kol, he hopes that the readers of
Mendele will tolerate his crotchets; v'hasheynis, ver hert
zikh tsu tsum shames?  So he feels free to express his
personal view that much of borsht circuit culture is
painfully self-abasing and in any event godawful (which
of course has nothing to do with standing in awe of God,
but that's for another forum) because he knows that readers
will continue to send in what they want.

An interesting question does emerge: where else in modern
Jewish history have we leaned so heavily on parody of the
host culture (l'moshel 'An Old Cowhand' and other such
khidushim of the Jewish Euterpe)?  I learned a good many
Russian songs as a child, some of them in Yiddish trans-
lation, some with Yiddish stanzas, but they were the same
sentimental smarmy tunes that were popular at the time
among Russians.  There were also macaronic ditties, but no
parodies.  Am I missing something?  Did Poland between the
Wars have some of this? I've seen no references to such but
I'm no authority.
