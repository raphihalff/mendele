Subject: Introduction

I'm a Ph.D student in Applied Linguistics at UCLA.  For my dissertation,
I hope to focus o n teasing in Yiddish conversation.  Through Mendele, I
hope to get in touch wit h other scholars interested in this topic, and
people who speak Yiddish regular ly at home, especially young parents and
their children, or grandparents who li ve with their grandchildren.  My
data sets are based on video and audio tapes of Yiddish conversation.

I've been enjoying and finding useful the communications I receive from
Mendele and will begin contributing as well.

=============================================================
*NEW* EASTERN EUROPEAN JEWISH HISTORY AND KHAZAR STUDIES LIST
=============================================================

Are you interested in research on the origins and history of Eastern
European Jews?  Have you been fascinated by the medieval multi-ethnic
Khazar Empire of the northern Caucasus and Eastern Europe, and the
influence of Judaism among the Khazars? Would you like to exchange ideas
and information with fellow professors, students, researchers, and other
interested people?

If you have answered yes, then I would like to invite you to join the
newly-formed EEJH (Eastern European Jewry History) conference on the
Internet.  We already have almost 200 users!

The list has been set up as an easy way for people who are interested in
the history of Khazars and Eastern European Jews to communicate.

The following topics are especially relevant:

         1. The medieval Jewish empire of Khazaria;
         2. Ethnic, cultural, and religious heritage of the Jews of
            Eastern Europe;
         3. Migration patterns from the pre-Khazar era to modernity;
         4. Archaeological discoveries in Eastern Europe pertaining
            to the history of Jews and Khazars;
         5. Analysis of published works about Eastern European Jews.

    Our geographic focus will be on the regions now comprising
    the nations of Latvia, Belarus, Lithuania, Ukraine, Poland,
    Slovakia, Hungary, Roumania, Moldova, Russia, Kazakhstan,
    Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Czech Republic, and the
    Balkan nations (Bulgaria, Serbia, Croatia, etc.)
    However, relevant history regarding Jews from other
    regions of the world will be acceptable, especially
    within the context of interrelations among Eastern
    European Jews and Jews from other places.
