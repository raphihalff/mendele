Subject: Literal meaning of "helfn vi a teytn bankes"

I have always believed that the expression "es helft vi a teytn bankes"
means, literally, that the subject can no more help than cupping can
benefit a corpse, therefore, that the subject is doomed to failure. Now,
however, I hear of another literal interpretation, one in which the
banke is described as _dead_ and therefore ineffective. Can this be?

Subject: Kalekh

I don't want to belabor the point because Ithink that we can agree that
kalekhic would imply something round or the concept of roundness.  But I
recall something different.  When I was about 12 I used to keep my
father's books (m'zol nisht visn derfun).

Er fleg mir zogn--"ikh hob oysgkalekht der zal un dernokh hob ikh gegebn
tsvey 'koyts peynt'".  Roughly translated it was I applied calcimine
before the two coats of paint. Can anyone else come up with support for
this definition?

Subject: Yiddish on shortwave radio

One Saturday afternoon not long ago, I was "surfing" the bands of my
shortwave radio (a habit I have found essential to interesting
discoveries) when I came across a program in Yiddish, interspersed with
obligatory interludes of klezmer music.  Because my Yiddish skills are
nonexistent and my Hebrew language abilities are not much better, I
cannot say for sure who was broadcasting the program, though I believe
it was Voice of Israel.  In any case, for Mendele readers who are not
sabbath observant and who are interested in listening again for the
program, the frequency was 11.605 Mhz and the time 1:00 p.m. Eastern
Standard Time.

My recent experience leads me to both a question and a comment. The
question is, does anybody know of other frequencies and times that I
might listen to Yiddish programming?  If this is not a subject of
general interest, please feel free to write to me privately.

My comment (at the considerable risk of stirring more controversy) is
this.  Languages in essence are meant to be heard as well as read (and I
say that with all due respect to the scholars among us who dedicate
their lives to reading texts of languages that are no longer ever
spoken). If you accept this proposition as true, does not shortwave
radio provide a unique and relatively inexpensive method of reaching
many current and potential Yiddish listeners who live in areas too
remote to ever receive even the limited Yiddish radio programming
described in Mendele entries earlier this year? If we are committed to
the continued vibrancy of spoken Yiddish among us, this certainly must
be one tool to be considered.

Subject: Yiddish children's rhymes and games

Mara Vishniac-Kohn (Roman Vishniac's daughter) is preparing for
publication a new book of Roman Vishniac's photographs of children of
Shtetl. She plans to "illustrate" the book with descriptions and
examples of typical children's activities: games, songs, rhymes, etc.
and is looking for materials about these subjects. I was able to find
several references about Jewish children's games in Eastern Europe in
1920s-1930s:

_Bavegungs-shpiln zaml-bukh_ (Vilne, 1920), Abraham Bulkin _Ruike
shpiln_ (Vilne, 1921), A.Pulner _Baveglekhe un sportive masn-shpiln in
shtetl_ (Moskve, 1925), and George Eisen _Children and play in the
Holocaust: games among the shadows_ (Amherst, MA, 1988)

Are there other good sources?

Mendele archives contain a number (a large number, I must say) of
postings about children's rhymes and games (no, not just "pishi-pashi").
I (and everybody else) have access to the archives, but for the
copyright purposes, explicit permission of the authors is neccessary to
use the materials. On behalf of Mara Vishniac-Kohn I am asking all
Mendelyaners who posted (or was going to post :-) something interesting
about children's culture and who is willing to make it available for the
new book: send me your original messages (or a permission to use them).
Or, if you would like to contact Mrs. Vishniac-Kohn directly, I will
give her address and phone number (she does not use e-mail).

Disclaimer: I am just relaying the information.
