Re:  Shuli Berger's inquiry on sneeze-responses:  My
grandmother used to say gez undheit after the 1st sneeze
and "lang leben zolstu hobn" on the second sneeze.  She
didn't mention any other ones although my mother had
severe hayfever and my grandmother had a lot of
opportunity to go further if she wanted.  Actually, I
think her pronunciation, after the second sneeze, was
"zolstu ibm", at least that is what I recall.

I recall my grandmother, who was from Mogilev Goberny in
Vays Russland, having only a 3 stage blessing for sneezes.
One sneeze would earn you a "tsu gezunt,"  2 sneezes "tsu
gezunt, tsu lebn," and 3 "tsu gezunt tsu lebn laynge
yor'n."  But, it we are on the subject of the Yiddish
response to bodily functions, then I should tell you what
we would hear if per chance we were to grepse--"a greps
aroys, a gezunt arayn, der mogen zol keynmol nit leydig
zayn!"

Hershel Bolshiviker (fishbane@epas.utoronto.CA) pointed out
that there are many words in Rabbinic literature for
non-Jews, such as "goy", "nochri", "akum" ("Oved Kokhavim
U'Mazalot", literally, "star worshipper"). In addition, one
will also see "Aino Yisrael" and "oved elilim" (idol
worshipper).

Many of these terms came about because of the heavy
censorship present. The Rabbis were certainly not free to
say what they chose about Romans, Christianity, or Moslims,
but speaking about star-worshipers or idol worshippers was
relatively safe, and understood by all.

I hope the day comes soon when the Vatican returns to us
the many censored Jewish books they have! But I digress...

Re Goy = gentile. The equivalence, and the formulation of
the blessing that got into the liturgy are rabbinic.  See
last chap. of Tosefta Berakot and Diqduqe Soferim on BT
Menahot 43b.

Subject: reply to Rotterdam

This is my first communication with your newsletter and I
have had difficulty sending e-mail.I am not on Internet,
only Bitnet so I hope this goes through.

In response to an inquiry from the Netherlands, I have
spoken with the Jewish Daily Forward and asked them to
write directly to the party below and send him a
subscription to the yiddish newspaper and they promised
they would. I hope it does indeed work out since he seems
anxious to obtain this newspaper and nowhere in the
Netherlands can he get it.

This reply is to: Mischa van Vlaardingen
                  Nazarethstraat 3-c
                  3061 KN Rotterdam
                  the Netherlands

He can also write directly to the 'Jewish Daily Forward' at
45 East 33 Street New York City. Their telephone number is
(212) 889-8200 I am enjoying your mail and hope to be able
to make my own contribution.
