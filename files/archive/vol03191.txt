Subject: Yiddish kiddy lit

Was there a children's lit in Yiddish, ca. 1900, in US or Russia?  I
assume there was a fairy tale lit and a folk tale lit, which may or
may not have been written down.  But was there a juvenile lit in the
sense that Little Women etc were written for young folk?  Query is
prompted by a passage from an imigrant who says she discovered the
lit of childhood in America. It may have been metaphorical, but I
became curious.

Subject: Taytshn, etc.

1. Shleyme Axelrod: "i'berzetsn--ikh zets iber" is not daytshmerish.
On the other hand, "iberze'tsn--ikh iberze'ts" is.

Difference in nuance? "taytshn" is certainly more usual in the
"Jewish" context although it can also be used more generally too.
"Men zetst iber fun frantseyzish af yidish" but "men taytsht dem
khumesh" probably meaning 'to explain' as much as or more than 'to
translate'.

I'm trying to puzzle out the following myself and any help would be
appreciated:

MHG glosses the entry "diuten, tiuten" as 'bedeuten, erzaehlen,
uebersetzen'; cf. Yiddish "bataytn".

An entry "tiuten" is also glossed 'schallen' and 'blasen'. Yiddish
knows this usage  from as early as the 15th century in connection
with 'blozn shoyfer', first in the forms "tutshn" or "tuetshn",
later as "tetshn". Are these cognate with English "toot" and Yiddish
"tut" 'paper bag' (in the shape of a cornet)?

Do Germanists consider "tiuten" 'to translate' and 'to blow (a
horn)' to be a case of homonymy or polysemy?

MHG also glosses the entry "diutisch, diutsch, tiutisch, tiutsch" as
'adj. deutsch', and the entry "diutschen, tiutschen" as 'auf deutsch
sagen' and 'erklaeren'.

Is there a clear connection between "diuten, tiuten" and "diutschen,
tiutschen"? The sources I've been consulting leave me with a feeling
of uncertainty.

2. Perets Mett: The feeling that Litvish Yiddish grammar is closer
to German is a common one. It's illusory, nevertheless. Why the
impression prevails, I don't know, but a closer examination of the
facts doesn't bear it out. One need only look at the "case and
gender systems" as an example of how "deviant" Litvish is. Too much
to deal with here.

3. Ellen: Your "pishy-tushy" analogy is a nice one.  The only
Yiddish childhood reference to the male organ that I recall is,
strangely enough, "pipikl". Am I alone in this?

While we're on the subject though, here's one I owe to Khone
Shmeruk: "Yidish iz a modne shprakh: me shmekt fin a pishkele (i.e.
a tabak-pushkele), in me pisht fin a shmekele".

4. Reyzl, Reyzl. Fun ergern zikh azoy ken keyn gezunt nit tsukumen,
nit dir un nit undz. Zol shoyn di yeshue kumen funem rebn. Tsum
nayem yor, let`s move on to other things.

Subject: Rhymes

Here's a rhyme that we use while pounding a fist on the bottom of
baby's foot:

  Shmid shmid shmid
  Nemden hamer mit
  Ven du vilst das ferd bashovn (bashlagn?)
  Musten hamer mitchik tragn
  Shmid shmid shmid

Please excuse & correct the transliteration; I'd appreciate the
corrected version.

Subject: Introduction

I am a Fine Arts graduate from the University of the Witwatersrand,
in Johannesburg, South Africa and I am currently poised on reading
for a Masters degree (I plan to register in the first quarter of
this year). My masters will focus on the question of the social
phenomena of the Holocaust museums, in relation to the work of a
(diasporic) artist, Mark Podwal, who deals with Jewish liturgy in
relation to contemporary (Holocaustic) issues.

Being a third generation Holocaust survivior, who "lost out" as it
were, on the history of my grandfather's generation because of
social erasure and imposed self-hatred, I am very keen to pursue
what may still be there to learn - in other words, I wish to learn
and recapture the essence of Yiddish.

I also believe that should I gain a working knowledge of the
language, it will enable me to enrich my research into my degree as
well as my understanding of the questions which I raise about being
a Jew in the Diaspora, and what this means, by implication, for me
as a Jewess and as an artist.

At the same time, I am a printmaker and an aspirant bookmaker.  I am
working on a letterpress which has been converted to function as an
intaglio press, but am keen to start printing my own texts.  I am
trying to get hold of or find ways in which I can make type, both
Hebrew and English, which may enable me to do this.

So, that's me in a nutshell.  I look forward to an interesting and
fruitful relationship with this discussion group - what I have seen
so far is really delightful and inspiring.

A grouse dank.
