Subject: YIVO/IWO/YIWO etc.

With regard to the ongoing discussion concerning the acronym YIVO, I
would like to point out that the full name of YIVO in English was
initially (no pun intended) Yiddish Scientific Institute, not Jewish
Scientific Institute, until about 1955, when the name was changed to YIVO
Institute for Jewish Research.

About the acronym: In the book by ALEXANDER POMERANTZ The Jewish Writers
Martyred by the Soviet (Di sovetishe haruge malkut), Buenos Aires, 1962,
the acronym appears as YIVO on the English title page and as IWO on the
Spanish title page (thus: Instituto Cientifico Judio - IWO). I don't know
any Spanish, but I seriously doubt that the letter "w" occurs in the
Spanish alphabet. Why then its use in the acronym? I have also run across
the acronym YIWO (though I don't recall where). Can anyone explain?

The last issue of the YIVO journal Yidishe Shprakh to reach me was
vol.38, no. 1-3, 1984/1986. Does anyone know if there have been any later
ones, or, for that matter, whether this journal officially still exists?

Subject: Vulekh = Romanian Gentile

Rick Gildemeister comments (4.020) that Romanian Gentiles were referred
to as "Vulekh."  The southeastern region of Romania is called Wallachia;
Italians (who lived nearby and -- like the Romanians -- claim a Roman
pedigree) are called Wlochy in modern-day Polish.

Subject: Happy, happy Jews

I must respond to Dan Leeson's recent posting in which he cites Chaim
Grade's _The Agunah_ as presenting something other than Sholem Aleichem's
Tevye and "happy, happy Jews."  Well, yes, Grade is a magnificent writer,
and his works are certainly quite different from those of Sholem
Aleichem, but Tevye is hardly a work that looks back at the good old days
for Jews in Mother Russia.  That may be part of the impression one gets
from Fiddler on the Roof (a work that also has a number of virtues, I
think), but if one reads the whole of Tevye, one sees the accumulating
tragedies of Tevye's life, tragedies that reflect the course of Jewish
history in Russia at the time the stories were being written.  It's also
worthwhile taking a look at the old Maurice Schwartz film of Tevye which,
despite some flaws, captures that sense of the Tevye stories.

Sorry, I just couldn't let Sholem Aleichem get slammed that way.

Subject: "Ikh for aheim" and translation help

To Frank Boches:

I have a copy of "Ich for aheim" that Bob and Molly Freedman, the famous
Philadelphia Yiddish music collectors, assembled for me. The tape doesn't
indicate who the singer is, but it might well be Jolson. It's a pretty
stirring rendition ... I don't think I can reproduce the lyrics for you
here, but if you like I can email you the Freedman's address and you can
ask them for a copy ...

To all:

I'm trying to nail down a couple of words in my grandfather's memoirs.
One is "spuzhet" as in the following:

     "di eingeshpanene ferd hoben zich tsu spuzhet fun dem blitzenden
funken regen, un hoben genumen loyfen mit di boyden ibe mark .. other is
"karahulke" in:

     "Motke der desiatnik loyft arum vi a fersm'ter, etlikhe fun unzere
khaverim hot men shoin avekgefihrt in karahulke..."

The general meanings are reasonably clear from the context, but I can't
find specific definitions in any of the dictionaries I've tried. Anybody
heard them used elsewhere?

A dank far di hilf,

Avreymel Cassel

Subject: Singer brothers

As I'm sure many other mendelniks will rush to note: I've read I.B.
Singer (The Family Moscat, etc.) and I.J. Singer (The Brothers Ashkenazi)
but I never heard of J. B. Singer.  Dan Leeson please enlighten me.

Subject: J.B. (sic) Singer

Zachary Baker was quite right in his use of (sic) with regard to the
non-existent Yiddish author J.B. Singer. Dan Leeson corrrectly remembers
the existence of I[saac] B[ashevis] Singer's older brother, whose name,
however, was I[srael] J[oshua] Singer. The prematurely deceased I.J.
Singer was the author of, inter alia, the family saga The brothers
Ashkenazi.

Subject: J.[sic] B. Singer

Dan Leeson's question about J. [sic] B. Singer's brother refers to
Yisroel Yehoshua (Y. Y., or I. J.) Singer, who was indeed a prominent
Yiddish novelist, author of "Brider Ashkenazi," "Yoshe Kalb," and other
notable works.  The Polish flyer for the book on Yiddish uses the letter
J instead of I, for Isaac Bashevis Singer's first name, presumably
because Yitskhok would be spelled Jicchok according to the rules of
Polish transliteration.  But Singer is best known even in Polish as I. B.
(and not J. B.) Singer.
