To Dan Leeson: my father, who was born and lived in Warsaw until the age
of nineteen used the term feldsher to refer to a sort of paramedic or
physician's assistant. The term is also known to my friend Dr. David
Ladner who stems from Tarnow (Galicia). The word feldsher appears in two
biographical sketches about Abraham Pinkusewicz, who lived and practiced
his profession in the western Polish town of Piotrkow Trybunalski. So
much for geographical localization.

Uriel Weinreich translates _feldsher_ as "old-time barber-surgeon", while
Harkavy gives "assistant surgeon". What precisely were the functions and
qualifications of barber-surgeons in 19th century America is not clear to
me but they may have been similar to those of the feldsher in 20th
century Poland and in the Soviet Union. Among the duties of the feldsher
were the withdrawal of blood by application of heated cups ("cupping") or
leeches, the dispensing of medications such as aspirin, the changing of
bandages, and the setting of broken limbs. I suspect that the training of
a feldsher involved mainly a prolonged apprenticeship under the
supervision of an experienced practitioner, after completion of secondary
school

Dan Leeson asks about the occupation of feldsher.  As I understand it,
and from my Polish relatives, this term refers to someone who was trained
as a sort of bone-setter cum first aid practitioner. The training was
usually as an apprentice to an established feldsher, but I have heard
about some who were "trained" as a result of their medical work experi-
ences in the army.  My impression is that the latter were rare and that
di feldsheren were very countrified and relatively primitive in their
approach, although many had good natural talents and acquired excellent
skills, and that they practiced in rural areas that were not well served
by physicians (if served at all).  I also know that the word in German
means a military field surgeon, and that it was sometimes used for the
old-fashioned "barber-surgeon".

Dan Leeson asked about the term _feldsher_ (5.078).  In German
_Feldscher(er)_ is an army surgeon.  Russian (and Ukrainian) _fel'dsher_
and Polish _felczer_ refer to a kind of doctor's assistant who has only
high-school level medical education (i.e., is a graduate of a medical
technical high school) and who is entitled to provide first aid and other
low-level medical treatment.

Weinreich's dictionary definition is 'old-time barber-surgeon'. My
grandfather, _Arye der feldsher_ (my _yikhes_) was from Mozyr, a bit
north of the Belorusian-Ukrainian border--not Lithuania but, culturally
and linguistically, Lite, which may bear out Dan Leeson's point
nevertheless. 'The Jewish, unlicensed doctor' is what we were told: I
would imagine _geshtelt ba(y)nkes_, _tsugeleygt piyefkes/pyafkes_
(leaches), maker of _proshkes_ 'powders' (_geviklt proshkes_, I think);
'barber'? No.

A widespread synonym is _royfe_. Both contrast with a full- fledged
_dokter_.

In due course, a map (_az met derlebn_).

Subject: Feldsher

Regarding Dan Leeson's question about the use of the word "feldsher", it
is not necessary to refer to it in the past tense; just last summer I
came across a building in Slutsk (Belarus) with a sign in Russian
indicating that this was the clinic of the Feldsher.  At the time, I
(mistakenly) thought it meant veterinarian, so I considered it a minor
coup to photograph a family of geese just happening to be waddling
haughtily past the building.

My Russian-English dictionary gives as definition of feldsher: "doctor's
assistant, medical attendant", while Weinreich defines it as an "old-time
barber-surgeon". Clearly the Russian came from the Yiddish (or perhaps
from German), not the other way around.  A feldsher, literally a "field
scissors", seems to follow the pattern of other words like
"feldtrumeyt"--a bugle--and "feldflash"--a canteen--in alluding to a
military context.  So I would guess that the feldsher began historically,
at least, as a military medic.  The word also follows another pattern,
namely the Jewish practice of referring to a person according to the
tools of his/her trade, as for example in "klezmer".

I take the definition "old-time barber-surgeon" as describing what a
feldsher _was_.  Mikhl is surely right in saying that "today's" feldshers
are not barbers.  Well, almost surely right.  The barber around the
corner had in his window a set of bankes together with a sign: mir shteln
bankes.  And I well remember watching while he administered to someone
in my family.

I _think_ feldsher was used in Ukrayne.  At any rate my father used the
term, though he'd served in the Czar's army and maybe picked it up in
that setting.  But my bobe, who grew up in a dorf, only used royfe and
belfer (Jewish doktoyrim were rare).  A royfe knew what he was doing,
a belfer didn't.  Azoy hot zi gezogt.  But what's a belfer?  The
dictionaries say that a b(eh)elfer is an assistant melamed.  Nit ba indz.
Is belfer as apprentice healer limited to Ukrayne?
