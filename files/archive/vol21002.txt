Subject: heirs of Yiddish poets sought
Date: June 30

Hello,
I've been working on an anthology of Kinderlider, Yiddish poems for
children translated for the first time into Hebrew. Among the poets, there
are some whose heirs I could not find in order to ask their permission to
publish the poems. Therefore, I would like to ask whether someone in the
Mendele discussion group knows any of the poets who lived in USA and died
there.

*Leyb Berkovich* (1897-1957) Children's poet, as well as his wife,
 *Lea Kapilowitz Hofman* (d. 1952).
*Shmuel Yokir Londinsky* (1889-1956). He wrote the famous song "Gegangen
iz a yingele" and *Abraham Reisen *(d. 1953)

If you know something about their children or where I could find such
information, I'd be happy to hear about it.

Many thanks,
Michal Arieli

Subject: shitere finger

The person who possess "shitere finger" is someone who cannot save or hold
on to money, a spendthrift.  The money runs right through his/her fingers.

Subject: shitere finger

In reply to Jane Peppler's question, it means exactly that the person's
money runs through his fingers.  No sense of being a crook is attached to
the idiom.

Subject: "Shver tsu zayn a yid"

I am forwarding the following inquiry in hopes that Mendelyaner may be of
help. Sholem Aleykhem's play was also known as "Der blutiker  shpas" and
was last performed in the U.S., I believe, by the Yiddish Theater Ensemble
in 1945-6 at New York's Barbizon Plaza (see Leksikon fun yidishn teyater,
Vol. 6, cols. 5877-5879). (I had a non-speaking role, but that's a whole
'nother story.)

Here's the inquiry:

Subject: It's hard to be a Jew script

Hello, my name is Jackeline Tenenbaum and I'm a teacher at the Jewish
school in Guatemala City. I would love to do a theatrical adaptation of
"It's hard to be a Jew" with my students but I have been unable to find
the script. Can you advice me on where to find  it?
Hope to hear from you soon.
Thank you very much in advance.
Yours truly,
Jackeline

Subject: "Shver tsu zayn a yid"

Since sending the following inquiry two days ago (6/20/2011), I've  been
informed of a Folksbiene production in 1983 (NY Times review, 11/9/83:
http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9D02EFD71439F93AA357
52C1A965948260&gt;http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?res=9D02EF
D71439F93AA35752C1A965948260)

The inquirer has been referred to the Folksbiene.

Interestingly, one of the members of the Yiddish Theater Ensemble, Jacob
Gostinsky, with whom I performed as a callow youth, is also listed as an
actor in the 1983 production.

Subject: Abbreviation giml''pey

I often translate hand-written Yiddish letters from private family
archives and frequently come across the abbreviation giml''pey that
usually follows any mention of family, particularly children. It's clearly
a blessing, but does anyone know what these letters actually stand for? I
assume it's something like "Got farhit," but this is nothing more than a
guess.

Many thanks,
Lena Watson
