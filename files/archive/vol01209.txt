Subject: RE:Mendele Vol 1.206

Thanks to all who have answered my questions, and even
corrected some misconceptions that I was carrying around,
like mixing up Eastern _vaan_ with Western _flaash_.

Also, on the request for a transcription, and not knowing
whether MENDELE has an official one, may I suggest:

:::::_sh_ rather than _sch_ on grounds of simplicity, since
_h_ is a handy non-diacritic substitute for the hook
(hacVek, hachek) of phonetics; (Dutch _sch_ is completely
different; wouldn't Dutch use _sj_ for _sh_?)

:::::and maybe even _ch_, altho it is spelled in Yiddish as
if _tsh_; :::::similarly either _zh_ (with diacritic H) or
_zsh_ (as spelled), although both these are marginal enough
that "mistakes" are unimportant;

:::::main vowels are as in: mAma jEt skI nO gUru; 

:::::and _ay_ as in "Kaiser", and _ey_ as in "weight",
which conform both to phonetics, and also to Yiddish
spelling -- except where used to represent "non-standard"
pronunciation;

:::::there's no need to distinguish "shwa" from _e_, since
position in the word does this, although perhaps a symbol
like @ can be used if a need is felt to distinguish, or the
full vowel could be marked with / for stress, e.g. _gezen_
or _g@zen_ or _geze/n_, if not _gezeyn_; vs. _geben_ or
_geb@n_ or _ge/ben_ or _geyben_ OR _gebn_, of course.
(There's no necessity for complete consistency; the
simplest is best unless there's a need to emphasize
something.)

:::::_h_ should not be used except when pronounced, e.g.
_handelt_ but not _zehn_ (a German-like spelling);

BUT ...... can I sell people on _hh_ (double H) for the
_ch_ of "Bach", e.g. _hhaver_, _hhapen_?  I use this in
Hebrew and a few other languages, and find it very
convenient, e.g. not subject to any misunderstanding, even
if one knows little of the language.  _kh_ is not bad
either (again with diacritic H), but _ch_ always leaves one
wondering...

This system can be used by people who don't read/write
Yiddish, and avoids the Germanization of its spelling.
It's mostly YIVO-style, too. (The five vowels of MAMA JET
SKI NO GURU are mostly as found in just about any languages
in the world except English.)

Subject: Intro. and question

Sholem Aleychem (a better way of saying hello then MENDELE
Moikher-Seforim): 

This is my first submission to Mendele. My Yiddish is quite
minimal (my parents used it for their "secret language")
but my interest is high, so I hope to actively participate
on the list.

Does anyone know the etymology of "oysen veynik" (?)
meaning "by heart"? Weinreich doesn't have it; a number of
fluent speakers I asked know the expression, but not its
literal meaning or etymology.

A sheynem dank,

Zev Hochberg

Subject: lakhn mit pyafkes

After reading about "lakhn mit yascherkes", I remembered
that my grandmother used to use a similar expression "Lakhn
mit pyafkes", which I think means "laughing with leaches".
Can anyone tell me the origin of this expression?

Subject: please

'Please' is:
	- kh'bet dikh/aykh
	- zay(t) azoy gut
	- zay(t) (zhe) moykhl

Yes, the last one also means 'excuse me', but is used when
we say in English 'please', with the understanding
'excuse/forgive me for troubling you'.  zay(t) azoy gut
when introducing the request (i.e., at the beginning of the
sentence) is very often accompanied by un: zayt azoy gut un
farmakht di tir.

Of course there's the daytshmerizm _bite_, to which one
answers (humoristically):  bite iz a tokhter (>Heb. bita
'her daughter').

Thanks, Bob Rothstein, for the translation of "the song".
Interesting that this is a Ukrainian version, sung by a
non-speaker of Ukrainian who had an elementary knowledge of
Polish from school and White Russian/Polish (the dialect of
where these two languages meet/met) from the street, who
thought the song was in Polish, did not know that the White
Russian language even existed, and exhibited traits of
Ukrainian Yiddish in her mame-loshn.  So a Slavic folksong,
in its original language (more or less), travelled the same
route as Yiddish-internal sound changes.
