Subject: Dav(e)nen/gedabrt

Anno Siegel:

The switch in verbs is solely for comic effect.  In the third verse (the
verse in question), the balagola (wagon driver) is judging the khazen.
Tying in to what Anno Siegel suggests, the implication is that wagon
drivers are less refined, more prost, than either the more demure
shneyder or shuster.  The "brr" sound in the word "gedabrt" may also be
comically imitative of the driver's horse.

I don't know how common its use in Yiddish, but "gedabrt" is a
Yiddishized verb from the Hebrew root "DBR," meaning "to speak." I
believe that Harkavy lists the verb, but don't remember the precise
meaning -- something like "utter," I recall.

There is _no_ variant of "dav(e)nen" with "r". You're right to suggest
that it's an attempt to characterize the gruffness of the character--the
"balagole", as I recall. I think Jan Pierce also sang it that way.

The variants of the word 'to pray' are davnen, davenen/dovenen, and
rarely, doynen.

There _is_ a word "dabern" derived from Hebrew "ledaber" 'to speak' which
is used cryptically, especially in Western Yiddish:

daber nit, der seyg iz meyvn kol diber.

I've asked before, to no avail: does anyone know the origin of Western
Yiddish "seyg", fem. "seygistn" referring to a non-Jew.

Happy New Year all.

Subject: Dav(e)nen/gedabrt

Actually the purpose is explicitly to characterize the speaker as a
"balegolchikl", a teamster.  Brr or prr were sounds used by eastern
European horse drivers to make the horses go, the equivalent of "giddyup"
in the U.S.

Subject: Cholomitzki?

In my wife's family, when something is very old (often something that's
been forgotten, say, in the refrigerator), they say it's from
"Cholomitzki's day." Is this a common expression?  Does it refer to
Chmielnitzki?  Thanks for clearing this up.
