Subject: forverts/forvits and r-dropping

I think the matter of _Forvits_ is independent of the issue of r-dropping.
I'd venture a guess that _Forverts_ in Yiddish is strictly a spelling
pronunciation. In the Yiddish of my family of non-r-droppers, the
newspaper
was called _Der Forvits_ and the word _forverts_ simply did not occur. The
name of the newspaper always smacked of the _daytshmerish_ that
characterized the language of the Trade Unions and the _bavegungen_.
We knew
_forverts/Vorwaerts_ from the German songs of the International Brigade. 

As for Yiddish r-dropping: As Ellen Prince points out (08:067), in a large
part of Central Yiddish, post-vocalic r-dropping is the rule. HOWEVER, this
generally has a decided impact on the quality of the preceding vowel. It
permits me, for example, to distinguish clearly between the adjectives in
the phrases _a gite man_ and _a git@ fro:_ (something a real Litvak may
have
trouble with). While such a distinction would not be evident from the
spelling (_forvits_ would still be spelled with an "r"), as a "native"
_forvits_-sayer, I can testify that the absence of _r_ is not reflected in
the vowel. Could it be that the _r_ was never dropped because the word
was
imported without an _r_ in the first place? Other borrowings suffered a
similar fate in Yiddish. The foreign word _fanatish_ was first rendered by
the familiar _farnarisht_ (semantically, perhaps, a justified
misinterpretation). In any event, I doubt that Central Yiddish r-dropping
accounts for _forvits_. 

If anything, there is another, less well-known aspect of Yiddish r-dropping
that may provide a linguistically more reasonable, albeit geographically
unlikely explanation: At locations in an area to the South and West of
Budapest, Yiddish is characterized by PRE-CONSONANTAL r-dropping,
without
any impact on the preceding vowel. Thus, _shvats_ 'black', _dot_ 'there',
_fatik_ 'ready/finished'. Still, I'd be reluctant to invoke this as an
explanation for the widespread Yiddish rendition _forvits_.

Subject: Shapiro

The family name Shapiro may be derived from the German town of  Spier
(Speyer).  I think there may be a more ancient,if you will, source.  There
is the Hebrew word shapir (shapira) from Aramaic  meaning fine, excellent,
good, handsome, well.

Subject: Shapiro

In regards to the name, Shapiro, I learned that it comes from the Hebrew
"Shin-Pey-Resh" meaning, "beauty".

Subject: student looking for klezmer musicians to interview

Re Larry Rosenwald's question [08.067]:

I would humbly suggest that the jewish-music mailing list, which I moderate,
would be a great place to look for klezmer musicians (although it is not the
only jewish music topic therein). 

To join the mailing list, send e-mail to:
   listproc@shamash.org
with the one-line message
   subscribe jewish-music YourFirstName YourLastName
substituting an actual name for "YourFirstName YourLastName".

The student might also be able to locate local musicians through the
"bands
by location" page of my KlezmerShack:

Subject: "Glupsk"

Re Naomi Fatouros' question [08.069]:

The novel by Mendele that mentions Glupsk is _The Journeys of Benjamin
the
Third_.  Abramovich must have lifted the name (could somebody please
check
the dates?) from the novel _The History of a Town_ by Mikhail
Saltykov-Shchedrin.  It is a satire on Russian history presented as the
administrative record of a town named Glupov (Foolsville). 

Vasily/Iosif Grossman was born in Berdichev, and set some of his stories
there.  Unsure how much of it has been translated into English.  The film
"Commissar" is an adaptation of one of them.
