Subject: Introduction

I am a neophyte on internet.  I am a public servant in the
Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto, and a part time
Yiddish teacher.  I teach a grade 10 course in Yiddish in
the North York Board of Education, one of the six area
municipalities which comprise the "federation".

I have three daughters who attend Bialik Hebrew Day School
and have been learning Yiddish since the third grade.

I am very proud that my second daughter is pursuing
volunteer work at the Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care,
and numbers among her skills the ability to speak (not bad)
and understand (flisik) Yiddish.

In Toronto, not traditionally known in the past for its
Yiddish atmosphere, it is now possible to study Yiddish from
pre-school to the Ph.D level.  A lot of work by a lot
people, particularly one Sylvia Lustgarten.

Shik mir noch a brivele.

Subject: Meyir bal ha/nes

In shaykhes mit Ruben Frankenstein's etlekhe fartaytshn vegn vord "yeke"
(4.148,2), ot iz a kurtse geshikhtele vegn a yeke, vi an ilustratsye:

A yeke zukht a gas in Tel-aviv.  In hant halt er a tsetele mit an adres.
Shtelt er op a farbaygeyer un fregt em vu iz di gas "Meyir bal HANS" .
Nu, vos zol ikh aykh zogn?  Di gas heyst "Meyir bal Ha'NES."

The street sign in Hebrew does not show the diacritical marks under HNS,
that is no pasekh under the letter /hey/ and no segl under the letter
/nun/. This explains the yeke's reading of the word as the popular
German first name Hans.  At the same time it also demostrates the yeke's
total lack of familiarity with Jewish life in Eastern Europe where for
centuries Jewish women kept charity boxes called Meyir bal ha'nes
_pushkes_ for collection of money for the poor in the Holy Land.

These alms boxes were the forerunners of the Zionist Keren Kayemes boxes
for the forestration of the lend in what was then called Palestine.

His real name was, apparently, not Meyir.  He was so called-- Meyir in
Hebrew means the enlightener--on account of his exeptional ability as an
expounder of the Toyre.  And he was called "bal ha'ness--the miracle
worker--but I do not know of any miracles ascribed to him.

Meyir bal Ha'ness was martyred during the Roman oppression in the second
century A.D.

He was a ta'ne--a Talmudic sage, a disciple of Rabbi Aki've, and
continued his teacher's work of clasifying systematically Jewish Law,
which made possible the final classification and compilation of the
Mish'ne.

Subject: Sheva Zucker's book/IB Singer Biblio.?

A comment and a question--

1. Sheva Zucker's new Yiddish text seems wonderful--though I'm at an
intermediate level, at least for reading, have benefitted from going
through the lessons so far--good grammar points, entertainingly
presented. The language has a lot more tam than Weinreich's College
Yiddish--it has a real colloquial feel.  Highly recommend it to beginners
and others wanting to review their grammar.  One drawback--no key to the
exercises, no good for autodidacts.  With the Mendele discount, a metsie.

2. Does anyone know of a bibliography of Bashevis Singer's Yiddish work,
other than the one which appears in "Der shpigl un andere dertseylungn"?
Am specifically searching for the Yiddish source for his story "Two",
which is found in the collection "Old Love", without any reference of
course.  Would be grateful to help in tracking this down.

The phrase was used with just about the same meaning in my Polish-Jewish
family. However, I knew the word "petrushka" as referring to a white root
vegetable that I believe are parsnips. My mother used it in (delicious)
soups. Gey Veys!

We use it in our family.  My in-laws are from Staszow, Poland.
I didn't know the origin of Petruskii, though; thanks for the explanation.
