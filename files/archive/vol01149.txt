i meant verb-final. old yiddish and modern german and also
dutch are sov--subject, object, verb, with the extra twist
that, in main clauses only, the part of the verb that
carries tense moves to second position. since i don't know
german, i'll give examples using english words:

subordinate clauses ('basic' sov word order):
...because hans a movie sees/saw
...because hans a movie seen has
...because hans a movie see will
...because hans a movie see can

main clauses (sov word order plus tensed verb in 2nd
position):

hans sees/saw a movie 
hans has a movie seen
hans will a movie see
hans can a movie see

'topicalized' main clause (where something other than the
        subject is 'topicalized' to first position; note:
        tensed verb is still in second position):

a movie sees/saw hans
a movie has hans seen
a movie will hans see
a movie can hans see

what happened in yiddish (in the 18th century, more or
        less, according to beatrice santorini's
        dissertation) is two things:

(1)the rule that says that the finite verb be in second
   position was extended to subordinate clauses.

(2)the basic word order became svo (subject,verb,object).
   however, there are lots of 'remnants' of the old sov
   word order, which is how come geven/geveyzn can pop up
   at the end of the clause.

more than you ever wanted to know about germanic syntax...

Subject: RE: Mendele Vol 1.146

 My real research in midrashic studies has ;led me into
some fascinating tangents of expressions of distress in
biblical and talmudic literature, including such
expressions as hoy, oy, eey, vay and way, etc.  All the
above are well attested in classical sources, leading me to
the suspicion that their later colloquial counterparts
among Ashkenazim (oy vey) and Sfardim (way) may be parts of
the Hebrew-Aramaic heritage rather than, as I had supposed,
borrowings from the respective German\Slavic\Arabic
environments.  Can anyone shed light on the topic (e.g.,
what do we know about the use of oy and vey among the
Germans and Slavs)?

Re: vol. 1, no. 144
 
Once we adopt the Standard Yiddish Romanization (SYR),
which is keyed to Standard Yiddish (StY),some of our
difficulties may disappear. The preposition _lebn_ 'near'
and the verb _lebn_ 'live' are always pronounced with a
final syllabic /m/ : /lebm/.  But in SYR (so-called Yivo
transcription, not to be confused with transliteration,
which implies letter-to-letter substitution), which is
morphophonemic, we romanize: lebn.  Moroever, _lebn_ is one
of the few prepositions (_in_ and _fun_ are two others)
which does not require the masculine and neuter definite
articles: _Er voynt lebn gortn_ 'He lives near the garden'.
In SYR, Moishe-Nussen would romanize his name Moyshe-Nosn
and everyone would pronounce it according to his own
dialect/
 
sociolect/idiolect, etc.

_Nosn_ can be pronounced /Nusn/.  But regardless of whether
or not M.-N. agrees to Nosn, he must acknowledge that the
final _n_ is syllabic and the presence of the _e_ before it
is derived from NHG and is inauthentic.  Thus we should
write _vos_, even though the phonological realization of
the komets alef in some dialects is /u/.  In other words,
we all follow the same spelling (here = romanizing)
conventions, and if we wish to indicate pronunciation, we
use phonetic notation. Incidentally, isn't the Yiddish name
Meylekh as opposed to the Hebrew Melech.  It is a thorny
business to suggest to others how to spell their names, but
these matters are not purely arbitrary.

I notice that the subject of how to romanize Yiddish is
constantly being raised in _Mendele_ and we will have to
keep hammering at it until we reach a a sensible and
civilized consensus.  The notion of spelling by ear to
placate one's ancestors is touching but totally impractical
-- and also inconsiderate of one's colleagues who are kept
guessing what you are trying to say.  Let's stick to
Standard Yiddish in the Standard Yiddish Romanization.

Re: vol. 1, no. 145
 
It is, I believe, always better to borrow authentic
morphemes and follow the normal neologizing patterns of a
language than to accept barbarisms of the order of
_boyd-vuchers_!
 
In StY we write _gey_ even though it it pronounced /ay/ in
Central (Polish) Yiddish.  When we write the word in
Yiddish we write it with two yods, without a pasakh = /ey/.
The correct transcription is _mayn_ -- here there is a
pasakh under the two yuds -- not the German _mein_.  The
tes + shin sound is /tsh/ and thus you would have to write
_vatsher_ if you wanted to borrow English _watch_.

Re: vol. 1, no. 145
 
Dovid, here are the two references you requested.  I give
them as they appear in my _Yiddish Literary and Linguistic
Periodicals and Miscellanies_ (Norwood Editions, 1982),
which I believe is out of print and in any event is now
undergoing revision for an expanded and corrected second
edition -- for which I would appreciate the assistance of
all Mendele khevre with access to Yiddish collections:
 
_Yidish far ale; khoydeshdiker zhurnal_ 'Yiddish For All,
Monthly Journal' Warsaw: 1 - 2 {= Nos. 1 - 14}; March 1938
- June / July 1939. // ed. by Noyekh Prilutski.  Volume I
(1938) = pp. 1-296 = 1 (March), 2 (April), 3 (May), 4
(June), 5 (July), 6/7 (August/September), 8 (October), 9
(November), 10 (December); II (1939) = pp. 1-128 = 1 {11}
(January), 2 {12} (February/March), 3 {13} April/May, 4
{14} June/July.
 
   This is the first Yiddish linguistic periodical intended
for the educated lay person, yet it contains a wealth of
important information useful to the linguist as well.  The
debate over Hebraisms is aired in I, 3, 65-75 and a useful
list of doublets is given in I, 10, 291-293. There is a
great deal of onomastic data in these slim volumes.

   This journal is the predecessor of the _Filologishe
shriftn_. It was published as a single volume by
Kultur-lige in Warsaw in January, 1926 with the aid of the
recently organized YIVO. It belongs to the small body of
indispensable source books for the student of Yiddish
language, folklore and, to a lesser extent, literature.

I have access to these periodicals, but have not found the
Prilutski article you are looking for.  Both periodicals
could do with indexes.
