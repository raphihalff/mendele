Subject: Release of Landmark Yiddish Translation

Tayere chaverim,

The Dora Teitelboim Center for Yiddish Culture is proud to announce the
release of its seventh book of Yiddish gems, The Jewish Book of Fables,
The Selected Works of Eliezer Shtaynbarg, (Syracuse University Press,
2003, ISBN 0-8156-0718-0.)  The fable has a 3000-year-old tradition in
Jewish literature, going back to the Bible and the Talmud.  Other works
of fables abound in the long stream of Hebrew literature, but it was
not until the advent of the illustrious poet and fabulist Eliezer
Shtaynbarg that fable writing in Yiddish was honed to perfection.  
This volume marks the first book devoted to his work.  Expertly
translated from the Yiddish by award-winning author and translator Curt
Leviant, this edition features the fables printed side by side in
English and Yiddish with all new color and black and white
illustrations by Dana Duane Craft.  The book can be purchased at
bookstores, directly from the publisher, Syracuse University Press at
http://sumweb.syr.edu/su_press/ or safely on-line at the Center's
website, www.yiddishculture.org <http://www.yiddishculture.org/> .

Keep your oygn ofn for these upcoming Center books: Proletpen --
America's Rebel Yiddish Poets, A Children's Garden of Yiddish Verse,
Opatashu's Bar Kokhba, Peretz Markish's Yerushe, and our third Yiddish/
English children's picture book, Sereena's Secret.

Mit grusn,

David Weintraub

Subject: yiddish on dutch  radio

On the tuesdays 10, 17 and 24 June there will be the radioprogram about
yiddish culture broadcasted on dutch national radio (747 am, at 16.00
and Radio 1 at midnight)

It was possible to make this radioprogram through the responses i got
on a request for help I posted on this mendele list.

At the moment we are busy editing the radio program, unfortunately the
radioprogram will be mostly accompanied by an 'voice-over' in dutch, so
it will not be understandable for most of the people here on the
mendele list. it would be great to make an version of the radioprogram
in english (or yiddish!), but at the moment we do not have the money
and/or a broadcaster for that. If anyone has an idea, we are very much
interested. for more information you can mail me at: grietje@xs4all.nl

Subject: "Hiawatha meter"

I am trying to trace uses in Yiddish of unrhymed trochaic tetrameter
(the meter of "Hiawatha" and the Kalevala, the Finnish epic that
Longfellow was imitating).  I'd particularly like to know of any poems
written in (or translated into) that meter in Yiddish before 1908, and
what, if any, associations were connected to that meter.

Many thanks for your help!

Subject: Short story identification

I am seeking a reference to a short story by a Jewish writer in which a
young Jewish man's love for a woman is frustrated when he learns that
she is not Jewish.  Thereafter, but too late for renewal of their
relationship, he finds out that one of her parents was Jewish.  I
believe that there is a scene on a lake. The story is in a book of
short stories.

Subject: Herz Grosbard's recordings

For quite a while I have been searching for audio recordings, either on
LP, audio or other format, of Herz Grosbard reciting poetry, without
success. I very much want to include some of his performances in a
course I am designing. I would be grateful for any information from a
Mendele subscriber about where one might obtain recordings of that
great man.

Subject: recordings of Lodz dialect

Dear Sir, 

I started to write a book about the Yiddisch dialect of Lodz, I work
with my material collected in Paris and in Poland (about 20 hours
recordings), I would like to have a copy of the recording made in the
50ies by Herzog. I am sure there is here some very good recordings
which could be very useful to me.

Sincerely yours

Best regards.

Subject: The female names Vikhne and Prive

I am interested in finding out from native Yiddish speakers whether
they know the female names VIKHNE and/or PRIVE, and if they do, from
which place do the speakers originate (please give both the Yiddish and
standard-language place names). Thank you.

Subject: Tekhine text sought

Dear Mendelyaners:

I am searching for the text of a "tekhine" that is paired with the
Hebrew prayer "Yevarech'cha Adonai veyishm'recha..."

I had a book of tekhines recently, and misplaced it. The initial part
of the tekhine reads,

"Riboyne shel oylem, ikh bin dayn, un mayne khaloymes zenen dayne. Es
zol zayn der viln far dir, got, az ale mayne khaloymes zoln zayn af mir
un af kol yisroyl tsu gutn."

The instructions noted that when the khazen chants this tekhine, then
it should be said.

Perhaps some Mendelyaner can contact me privately and send me a
photocopy, and the source for said tekhine.

A sheynem dank in foroys,

Shloyme-Khayim (Steve) Cohen
