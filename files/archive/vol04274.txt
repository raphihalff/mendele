Subject: Sholem-Aleykhem's Zhargon standards

Sholem-Aleykhem seems to have been one of the first modern Yiddishists
(before there was such a word) to see a complete language in _Zhargon_.
His first letter to Simon Dubnov clearly expresses his perception that
standards are needed for Zhargon, the same kinds of standards applied in
judging language propriety in other european languages.

This letter (part transcribed below) was published by Dubnov in Dubnov's
Yiddish translation from the original Russian.  The Jewish intelligentsia
corresponded only in Russian at that time.

Kiev, May 29, 1888
Bayleygndik derbay mayn khibur "Dos Bintl Blumen" oder "Der Buket" _Ferzn
in Proze_ (in der Yidisher shprakh der ershter pruv tsu shraybn azelkhe

tsu keyn Daytshe nisht tsu keyn Rusishe oysdrukn un verter), bet ikh aykh

Es iz nisht bashert geven mir zoln zikh do trefn; ersht ven ir zent

Kiev; kh'hob gehat mit aykh a sakh tsu redn, der iker vegn mayn
unternemung: aroystsugebn a yidisher zhurnal in Zhargon.

>From _Fun Zhargon tsu Yidish_, by S. Dubnov, Vilna: Kletskin, 1929, p.
64.

My English translation:
I enclose my opus, "The Bundle of Flowers" or "The Bouquet," lines of
verse in prose (the first attempt at writing such poems which steers the
language toward completeness, depending neither on German nor on Russian
words and expressions).  Please say a few words about it in the next
issue of Voskhod [a Russian language monthly devoted to matters of
interest to Jews].

We were not fated to meet here.  Only after you had left did Mr.
Kalmanson [a fellow writer, a maskil who was living in Kiev] let me know
that you had been in Kiev.  I had much to discuss with you, mainly about
my undertaking: to publish a Jewish journal in Zhargon.

Subject: Splitting the list

I know this is a minority opinion, but I would like to argue
(reluctantly) to split the list.

Basically, the original argument, by Patty Becker, was that that some
persons who are subscribers do not have the background or (less likely),
the interest, in the focus on the Yiddish language.  (Here I do not want
to get into the side debate as to whether we are "really" dealing with
linguistics, or whether the postings are academic enough, etc.)  She is
one such subscriber and so am I.  Maybe we are the only two!

Two cogent arguments against splitting the list.  The first, very
compellling, is wanting to maximize the number and variety of
participants, which may be encouraged by having only one list.

IMHO, there exists the ironic possibility that splitting the list may be
the only way of keeping maximum number of total participants.  What do I
mean?  The suggestion is that those whose primary or sole interest is in
culture skip over all the other stuff.  In theory this is a great
suggestion.  In practice, as someone who often gets 50+ messages a day,
several that are digests, this is bordering on the impractical.

An alternative might be to have 2 segments of the list, and people can
subscribe to one or both.  Someone like myself or Patty can subscribe
just to the Yiddish culture list.  It probably will be less voluminous
(or, taking Hope Ehn's warning, which is the second cogent argument, of
not enough critical mass, disappear). That is a risk.

It is clear to me that I need to cut back on my subscriptions.  Because
of the amount of time I spend browsing and ignoring much of the mendele
postings (no disrespect meant here), mendele is a prime candidate.  I
would do this with a heavy heart.  If there were a list that concentrated
on Yiddish culture I would surely subscribe to that.

So both paths, splitting and not splitting, carry the danger of losing
subscribers.  We don't know how many people on the list are like Patty or
like me. We don't know how many people (if there are any) who have
desubscribed from the list for this reason.  I do know of people who I
have tried to interest in mendele don't subscribe because its "too
linguistic."

Ideally, of course, you cannot separate a culture from its language.
Sadly, the reality is that there are many of us whose access to the
language is minimal, who may learn it one day, but in the meantime are
primarily or soley interested in the richness of Jewish culture in
general, and East European culture as an important component, in
particular.  Scrolling through much material and feeling irrelevant and
an outsider is discouraging as well as a huge timewaster.  Maybe a
separate, possibly less frequent list, on Yiddish culture would attract
and encourage such persons to stay on, or even join in the first place!

Subject: Nature of Mendele

Where David Braun, et al, make their mistake is in not understanding that
there are thousands of potential beneficiaries of Mendele who are
alienated by a system which devotes itself exclusively or even
overwhelmingly to academic jargon and turgid analysis.There is no
question of the  value and importance of your input but have rachmunes
(pity) on the unwashed majority who want to listen and learn and have an
input on perhaps a lower level. More mundane, more digestable and
interesting folk material should be encouraged. Let a thousand flowers
grow in the Yiddish garden.  (Luz ein touisent blumen vaxen in dem
Yidishen gawrten ).
