Subject: Introduction (Learning Yiddish)

My name is Allen Dronet.  I have just recently learned of the existence 
of the Mendele list.  This is my first time on a list of any kind, and 
I apologize for my awkwardness in addressing you. 

I work in Los Angeles as a legal intrepeter and translator.  Mostly, 
of course, my bread and butter language is Spanish, here in the courts 
etc.  I work in Spanish, French, Portuguese and sometimes Italian.  I 
studied German many years ago in college, and then I spent a couple of 
years in Germany as a soldier in the US Army.  I picked up quite a bit 
of German during those couple of years and became almost fluent.  But 
then when I came back here to the States, I lost touch with anyone with 
whom I could have practiced speaking, and therefore I lost whatever 
fluency I had started to acquire in Germany. 

I started to get interested in Yiddish when I started to read some of 
the classical Yiddish writers of the end of last century and the 20th 
century in translation.  I became almost obsessed with Isaac Bashevis 
Singer a couple of years ago and I have tried to read in translation 
everything he has written.  His influence on my intellectual and 
spiritual growth has been something I had never expected to experience 
again in my life.  I am 61 years old and I had sort of thought I had 
settled into a satisfactory state of the soul.  Then I read Isaac 
Bashivis Singer and I went through a complete reawakening to the moral 
and spiritual demention of things. Now I want to learn to read Yiddish 
so that I can read some of these writers in the original. I know that 
this is a quixotic dream, but stranger things have happened.  If I 
could learn to read a couple of novels of at least one of them in the 
original Yiddish, I would be more than  satisfied, or even just a 
couple of stories I would rejoice. 

When I started this a couple of months ago, I had no idea how 
difficult the process would be. I thought that with my knowledge of 
German I would have a real foot in the door, as it were. But such is 
not the case as anyone who has attempted this knows. 

I have a College Yiddish Grammar and a Yiddish-English dictionary.  I 
have got to about the 12th lesson of 30 in the Grammar, and I am 
tearing the dictionary apart as I study every day for about 6 hours   
on the subject, but I often feel I am getting nowhere.  Right now the 
main problem is being able to recognize "whole" Yiddish words without 
grunting through the phonetic particles for every new word I come 
across. 

I am hoping that by writing to the Mendele list I will be able to get 
some help in my study. Right now I am at that point in the language 
where I need to hear it spoken and to be able to recognize "whole" 
words.  If anyone reading this note knows of a Yiddish course on tape 
which contains a set of FLASH CARDS with English or Spanish etc. words 
on one side and the corresponding Yiddish word on the other I would 
very much appreciate knowing about it.  

Also I have thought that if there are no courses which contain FLASH 
CARDS, maybe someone would know of software which could turn my 
keyboard into a Yiddish Keyboard, then I could make my own flash 
cards.

I am sorry to ramble on. I started this introduction with the 
intention of writing a couple of lines and here I have been typing for 
a quarter of an hour.  I hope to hear from someone, even if it does 
not have anything to do with Yiddish courses.

Subject: National Yiddish Book Center new building

I wonder whether I missed reading  a posting on Mendele, related to the 
opening of the National Yiddish Book Center in Amherst Massachussetts. If I 
did please accept my apology. On June 15, 1997, a festive opening of the new 
building for the National Yiddish Book Center took place on the grounds of 
Hampshire College in Massachussetts.

The impressive ceremony included a live Klezmer concert and tours of the 
building, with lively and emotional participation by hundreds. It seems 
strange that this event was not mentioned in Yiddish forums such as the 
Forwerts, nor did it gain publicity in national newspapers. It was however 
mentioned in local papers in Massachussetts. There is no doubt that the 
"samlung" efforts of the NYBC headed by Aaron Lansky, can take pride in 
the salvage of hundreds of thousands of volumes of Yiddish books. The Center 
is establishing its own collection and is distributing duplicate titles to 
libraries across the country.

The last YIVO bulletin included mention of a special "preview" tour of 
The NYBC by YIVO staff, and described collaborative activities between 
the two institutions. However, at the ceremony, no mention was made of YIVO, 
or of any other Yiddish related facilities/resources.

There is no doubt that the National Yiddish Book Center has added a new 
dimension to the preservation of Yiddish culture, not covered by YIVO or 
by others. The preservation and dissemination of Yiddish books is 
benefitted by the NYBC. It is however beyond my understanding, why was 
the Center placed in rural, western Massachussetts, instead of in a more 
central location, with better accessibilty for people interested in Yiddish.
Hopefully, this disadvantage will be compensated by efficient book loaning 
by mail and by electronic media.

In any case : "Kol Hakavod" for the NYBC !

Subject: Weinreich's phrase book

I have to take issue with the note from Al Grand in Mendele Vol 7.023 
regarding an article in the magazine _Civilization_ about the above book.  
I haven't read the article (nor do I intend to, based on Al's review), but 
I find reference to Ashkenaz as "a country that never was" quite offensive 
and not "delightfully humorous" at all.  While there never was a _country_ 
(in the ordinary use of that word) where Yiddish was the official language,
there were certainly places in Europe "wherein all street signs, billboards, 
directional markers and public notices [were] all in Yiddish _oysyes_."  
There was even Yiddish writing on Ukrainian paper money from the period 
1917-1920!!  I remember a situation exactly like that he described on the 
Lower East Side of Manhattan (New York) while I was growing up during the 
1950's, and there are certainly places in Israel today (e.g., parts of 
Bnei Braq and Jerusalem, etc.) where all but the street signs are in 
Yiddish.  The author of this piece should be excoriated rather than 
praised for this article, and placed in the same kheyrem as the rest of 
those who think Yiddish is dead.

Subject: National Yiddish Book Center

I have waited a week for a reply in Mendele to Sholem Berger's shocking
diatribe against Aaron Lansky and The National Yiddish Book Center. That
none has as yet appeared is, I presume, not a sign of disinterest, but
rather of disbelief that the writer could display such ignorance and
ill-will. His allegations are really beneath contempt but they must be
challenged.
 
It is evident that chaver Berger has not attended a Summer Workshop at the
NYBC. I had the good fortune to do so 5 years ago, and I can say that the
experience literally changed my life, and I regard myself now as a
Yiddishist. Had someone told me before that time that I would be speaking
Yiddish today, that I would be reading and enjoying the great and lesser
masters of Yiddish poetry and prose, subscribing to and reading Der
Forverts from cover to cover, seeking out programs and activities offering
Yiddish (not just Jewish. YIDDISH!) culture: music, language instruction,
theatre, film, history, folkways, I would have laughed at them. It was my
experience at the NYBC that opened these doors for me. The size of the
membership, over 15 000 I last heard, indicates the appeal of what is
happening there.

Go there for a week, khaver Berger. Go as a participant, not as an
onlooker. Immerse yourself, as in a mikve. THEN write about it in Mendele.
Until you have done so, you have no business throwing stones.
