Subject: az me lebt ...

Michael Steinlauf asks in 7.041 about a translation for "az me lebt, derlebt
men". It reminds me of the German saying "Wie man sich bettet, so liegt man."
and the French "Comme on fait son lit, on se couche." which are both used to
point out to someone, esp. children, that a previous behaviour is the cause
for current discomfort. The English equivalent has a slightly different
connotation in "If you make your own bed, lie in it." being more of an order
than an explanation. The Yiddish sentence could be rendered with the talmudic
"Whatever you sow, you shall harvest."

Subject: terms of endearment

Sholom alechem.  I am a new student of Yiddish.  I was wondering if someone
could help answer a question for me.    In English we have dozens of words
that are  used to refer affectionately to one's significant other:  darling, 
honey, dear, baby, sweetheart, sweetie, lover, angel, honeybunch, sugar, 
precious, doll....   I realize that I don't have a clue what words are  used
in Yiddish.  The only terms of endearment I recall hearing from my  mother
were tateleh and momeleh, but they were used to refer to us kids, not to my
dad.  What words are used in Yiddish?   I came across the word  Tsutsik, used
as a nickname in Singer's book Shosha.  Is that a term of endearment?  I
realize that I should try to get my hands on a Yiddish thesaurus, but I
haven't yet been able to do so.  Thank you for you help.

Subject: Help For Teachers

Ot. Ot. Dos hob ikh davke gemeynt [7,046;6]. Dos iz an onheyb a khoshevdiker.

Un fun ot di temes kenen zikh antviklen diskusies, lokale konferentzn, un

A dank dir,  mashinke.

That's it. That's it. This is exactly what I had in mind. This is a most
respectable beginning. Information about conferences on Mendele, and more.
A large number of teachers do not receive this information, or, live too
far to travel. Perhaps it would be possible, after the conferences, to post
on Mendele Review the most important workshops.

And from these topics, discussions could develop, local conferences, amd
most importantly, conferences on the Web, in which all teachers could
participate.

Speak out, teachers of Yiddish. Let's hear your opinions. Let people know
where you are, in which institutions yu teach, so that students can find
you in time.

Thank thee, Mashinke.

Subject: Yiddish on CD-ROM

Hugh Denman's thoughts on integrating several dictionaries on one CD are
precisely on the mark (7.046, 3).  In the same issue, Bob Rothstein, no doubt
after thorough search, discovered drimplen deeply enfolded among a list of
words under shpiln in Stutchkoff's Oytser.  Such depth of search is what it
takes, of course, to really mine the treasures in Stutchkoff's thesaurus.  On
a CD, that kind of search would be very easy, very rapid.  I have met some
who think it may be too easy, but I hold that saving time for other pleasures
such as learning Yiddish, reading Yiddish literature, conversing in Yiddish,
etc. is a basic, most worthwhile goal. A pronouncing dictionary (sound files
can be added) would satisfy a genuine need, and would be a useful teaching
aid.  The student might even be able to explore various dialects, and better
grasp the extent and lively nature of Yiddish pluralism.  The list of
possible computer-generated wonders goes on, but devoted teachers and plenty
of books are still sine qua non.  Yasher koyekh tsu di kompyutor mevinim, tsu
di lerers un lererins, un tsu di bibliotekers!  A gezunt af ale zeyere
kepelekh!

Subject: Verlaine into Yiddish

I have a particular fascination with Verlaine's famous opening lines from his
Forgotten Melodies (Ariettes Oubliees) # 3:  

Il pleure dans mon coeur
Comme il pleut sur la ville
Quelle est cette langueur
Qui penetre mon coeur?

I have three Yiddish versions of these sublime lines - two by M. Litwin from
his _Frantsoyzishe Poezie_ and a third version of my own:

1. M. Litwin - Es khlipet in harts
                    Vi s'khlyapet arum mir
                    Fun vanen kumt tsu mir
                    In hartsn der kumer?

2. M. Litwin - Inem hartsn veynt es
                    Vi in shtot der regn
                    Vozhe ober meynt es
                    Ven in hartsn veynt es?

3. Al Grand - Es veynt in mir dos harts
                    Vi es regnt in shtot
                    Vos iz di shlafkayt
                    Vos fargeyt mir in harts?

I'd be grateful for other Yiddish versions of these lines to add to my
collection that anyone may wish to share.

Subject: Information about Khaym Grade

A khaver of mine is interested in knowing whether the widow of the writer
Khaym Grade (1911-1982) is still alive, if yes where she lives and who owns
the copyrights for Khaym Grade's works.

A dank in advance,

Subject: More on Joseph Green

Mendelyaner,
An update on materials concerning the Yiddish film pioneer Joseph Green. The
National Center for Jewish Film (NCJF)  has the papers and archives of the
late filmmaker and all his films restored and available in film and video.
They are an excellent resource and can be reached by e-mail at
NCJF@logos.cc.brandeis.edu

Subject: drimplen

I smiled when I read Heynkeh Sapoznik's tale of constant banjo playing as a
youth, and his parent's description of it as "drimplen."  My late parents used
to describe my incessant torture of an accordion (and in later years of
an equally guiltless guitar) as "grimplen."  My brother took to referring to
the accordion as my "grimpl-box."

After reading the exchanges about drimplen, I went straight to Weinreich,
which indeed does list "grimplen," meaning to "strum tunelessly."  Following
up on Bob Rothstein's discovery of drimplen in Stutshkov, I found grimplen in
the index, and enjoyed reading all of the rhymed, onomatopoetic synonyms
listed: grimplen, shkrimplen, rumplen, rimplen, drimplen, klimpern, etc.
Unfortunately, the distinctions among them are lost to most of us non-native
speakers.

Admittedly, for me, "strumming tunelessly" was an apt description.  My guitar
and accordion playing have not improved much since I was a teenager.  I still
grimpl (infrequently).  L'havdil, Heynkeh Sapoznik, a world-famous klezmer, 
whose drimplen obviously was more successful than my grimplen.  Yasher koyekh
to Heynkeh.

Shpilt, klezmorim!
