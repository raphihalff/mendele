Subject: reply to Kertesz on mauscheln,and to Prince

To Yitzhak K: the book on Kafka that talks about mauscheln (rather
differently than you did in your reply) is Marthe Robert, AS LONELY
AS KAFKA, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, l982 (a translation of Seul,
comme Franz Kafka, Calmann-Levy, l979).See the index under German
language, particularly the section beginning at the bottom of p.
153: 'The only way Kafka could envisage of making his in every
respect impossible writing possible was to demarcate the area of
impossibility by creating a language without particular color,
without local tone, without qualities, as it were. In his indictment
of his Jewish colleagues, he freely admitted that the Mauscheln
[speaking German with a Jewish accent] of which Karl Kraus was the
uncontested master, - "an organic compound of bookish German and
pantomime," as Kafka himself defined it ..." I haven't read
(Prager's suggestion) Gilman, and I don't know if Kafka on mauscheln
is congruent with, familiar to, and dealt with by Gilman.

To Ellen Prince: I don't know where the Hall quotation comes from. I
would have guessed Leave Your Language Alone. It was commonly -
perhaps wrongly - attributed to him in the early fifties.  I had no
idea he had opinions - and that kind of opinions - on the Holocaust.
He should have stuck to Rhaeto-Romance.

No replies  yet to my question about Kafekal.  Another fictitious (I
think), expressive placename I used to hear about (and would like to
know more about), Shnipishok.

Shalom allechem!

I've just subscribed to Mendele.  It caught my attention as I
browsed through the list of groups available on e-mail.  My command
of Yiddish is, well, not so commanding (I took part in one session
of the Oxford Summer Yiddish Program in England some years ago), but
I would welcome the chance to keep up my knowledge of the language
and culture.  I'll probably be on the list only until September,
when I will go to Berlin to conduct research on my dissertation
topic, the Austrian writer Joseph Roth (1894-1939).  I look forward
to hearing from you.

zaid gesunt!

Subject: introduction

I'm no linguist, and have only recently begun an informal
self-course in Yiddish. But over the past few years I've
been trying to translate and edit my grandfather's Yiddish
history of his native town, "di shtat Keidan," published in
1930 by the Keidaner Farein of New York. Among the things I
learned from this was that zeyde (who died in 1941, nine
years before I was born), had collected folk songs in his
youth, and was a major contributor to the 1901 book
published by Ginsburg and Marek.

Baruch Chaim Cassel was a stolz Keidaner, and was quite put
out that the G.-M. book credited the songs he had collected
as merely from "Kovne gubernie" rather than Keidan. In 1990
I brought this to the attention of Chana Mlotek at Yivo,
who put me in touch with Dov Noy at the Hebrew University.
The result was a footnote on p. 85 of Noy's re-issued
(1991) Ginsburg-Marek (Bar-Ilan U. Press), which corrects
this 90-year literary mistake.

Sadly, the 1901 Ginsberg-Marek contained only lyrics; the
money apparently ran out before they could publish the
accompanying music. I'm hopeful that someday I'll turn up
at least some of the tunes; my dream is to resurrect
zeyde's music for his great-grandchildren, now aged 4 and
2.

I've also got some grist for any Sholem-Aleichem scholars out there,
in the form of 6 letters from S-A to my grandfather in New York in
the period 1906-1908. (Some of these were published last year by
Itche Goldberg in Yiddishe Kultur.) They mainly concern an attempt
to translate and publish several works, including "The First Jewish
Republic" and "Motl Peyse dem Khazan's" in the U.S. Nothing ever
came of it, so far as I can tell; probably it was one of many
not-too-successful ventures my merchant-scholar-Zionist
grandfather tried over the course of three decades. But they may be
of some interest. For my part I'd like to find someone  with
detailed knowledge of S-A in that period, in the interest of
establishing context and possibly shedding some light on my
grandfather's early life.

Anyway, I've got translations of the 1930 history, along
with some delightful zichroines from other Keidaners of
that period, available to be posted or emailed if anyone is
interested....
