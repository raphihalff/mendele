Subject: Yiddish board games

"Handel Erlekh", the Yiddish "Monopoly" game which was featured in Joshua
Fishman's article in Yeshiva University's alumni magazine, can be
purchased in Eichler's book store on 13th Ave. in Boro Park, Brooklyn.
They also sell "Shtayg Hekher," a Yiddish version of "Chutes and
Ladders."

Subject: Gikh/gikher

In 4.327 Mikhl Herzog asks:

>1. Are there any regional German cognates of _jaeh_ with word- initial
>"g-"? (Berlin, Anno?).

Not contemporarily, as far as I know.  MHG forms of "jaeh" were "gach",
"ga:", "gaehe" (fast, sudden) until Luther adopted the dialectical
initial j.  Berlin, and probably earlier related dialects too, substitute
the j sound for g wherever they can, but never the other way around.

>2. Is there a regional German usage in which _jaeh_ is 'synonymous' with
>_schnell_?

The word still means, (besides "steep") "immediate", "unexpected" and
"jerky" (of a movement).  "Schnell", on the other hand, means primarily a
rapid spatial movement, the meaning of "soon", "jaeh" only being
secondary.  There is certainly some overlap, perhaps best characterized
by "rasch" (brisk).

Richard Wagner (ahem) uses "jach" for "sudden(ly)." (_Das Rheingold_, 3rd
scene, Alberich: "Bestimm', in welcher Gestalt soll ich jach vor dir
steh'n?")  Not the purest of sources, to be sure, but W. certainly new
how to use his German.

>3. Is there a German usage of the comparative that parallels the Yiddish
>one?

(The Yiddish being: _eyder geyn tsu der arbet volt ikh haynt gikher
geblibn in der heym_.)  Hmmmm, that sounds familiar... :-)

"Jaeher", "schneller", etc. cannot be used this way.  "Eher" (sooner)
comes closest, though it is used to give preference to one of two
unfavorable choices, excluding the other:  "Ich zahle nicht!  Eher gehe
ich ins Gefaengnis!"  (I won't pay!  I'd rather go to jail!) Can "gikher"
be used like this?  Alas, there is no connection of "eher" to "jaeh",
plausible as it may seem.

German "jagen" has a primary meaning of "hunt (for game)."  The earlier
sense of "move fast" lives on in "nachjagen" (follow swiftly).  Its
etymology is not very well known, but a connection to "jaeh" is nowhere
suggested, nor are there forms with an initial g.

To conclude,  "gikh" and "jaeh" are most probably cognates (I wasn't
aware of this), as are "yogn" and "jagen".  However I was unable to find
the missing link between "jaeh" and "jagen."

Subject: Rogelakh

Meyshe-Yankl Sweet asked (Vol. 4.331) about the etymology of "rogelach."

"Rog" in Slavic (Russian, etc.; Polish ro'g) is the horn or antler of an
animal, which is quite a bit larger than the baked good in most cases,
hence the diminutive plural ending -lakh.

FWIW, the hand signal for a cuckold, the forefinger and pinky extended
over a clenched fist, is called "rogovi" (horns) in Serbocroatian.

Subject: Doktoyrim, naronim un lehavdl kabtsonim

Don't understand the source of ellen prince's doubts about etymology of
"kabtsn." It appears, defined as "beggar, pauper" in both my
Hebrew-English dictionaries and in Nakhman Krupin's invaluable and
just-republished "hantbukh fun hebreizmen in der yidisher shprakh." The
Ehud Ben-Yehuda pocket Hebrew-English dictionary gives the related verbs
kabats as "to assemble" or "to gather" and kibeyts as "to beg; to
collect." Given the vehement nature of the kulturkamf among yiddishists
and hebraists, i doubt that modern Hebrew would have taken over kabtsn
from Yiddish. S'leygt zikh nit afn seykhl.

Subject: Kabtzonim

Ellen Prince asks about "kabtzonim" (Mendele 4.327).  I believe the word
is ori ginally Hebrew, derived from the piel form of _kvtz_ having the
root meaning "to gather."  The nun ending indicates that the person
referred to is one who is a constant or frequent practitioner of the
activity alluded to by the verb--i.e ., a constant gatherer or collector
of things, a beggar.  So kabtoznim, in Hebrew or in Yiddish, are rag
pickers, beggars, or shnorrers.

By the way, the Israeli kibbutz gets its name (obviously without,
kholile, the negative implications) from the same root--a collective
farm.

Which leads me to wonder: Where does "kibbitz" or "kibbitzer" come from,
since I see no connection with gathering or collecting?

Subject: Tokhes

In re the question of Alan Shuchat (4.330) about not finding "tokhes
"in his Vaynraykh ,the same is true for my Harkavy 1910. I always
understood that the Hebrew word for "under" (tokhes) was our answer to the
Germanic "hinten ".
