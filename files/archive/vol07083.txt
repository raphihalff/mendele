Subject: Yiddish tongue twister

In Kishinev the word for fox was pronounced _fiks_. The challenge: trogt a
fiks a biks in pisk. That is: A fox carries a gun in the mouth.  Haven't
thought of that in ages.

Subject: Fifth IAYC Conference Announced

The International Association of Yiddish Clubs is proud to announce that the
Fifth Conference will be held August 27-30, 1998 in the beautiful Westwood
section of Los Angeles at prestigious UCLA (University of California at Los
Angeles) with the Bel Air section across the street from the campus. The
university also has a Yiddish program.

IAYC President, Dr. Harold Black, stated that this is the first time the group
will be meeting on the West Coast. It will give the second largest U.S. Jewish
population the opportunity to participate, and offers Canadians, Easterners
and Midwesterners the chance to have an extended vacation in one of the prime
vacationlands of America.

Previous conferences have been held at the University of Maryland and hosted
by Yiddish of Greater Washington. The second conference was hosted by the
Toronto Friends of Yiddish near the University of Toronto.

The third conference was held at the DiLido Hotel in Miami Beach and was
coordinated by Ruth and David Barlas. In May of this year our fourth 
conference was hosted by Mameloshn in Fairfield, CT.

This Fifth Conference's coordinator is Mel Rogow and is shaping up to be the
finest one. The rooms are guest suites at the UCLA Conference Center. 
Meetings, dining, accommodations, and entertainment will be held around a
courtyard area.

Monthly updates and applications will appear in "der bay" and posted on 
Mendele.

Subject: davnen

Esther Goffstein recently posted this interesting message (in Vol. 07.079):

<According to Max Weinreich: History of the Yiddish Language (Pg.24) the word
was "doynen" (old Yiddish) before it changed to "davnen". "The grandparents
might still have said /zaver and /doinen/ for zoyer (sour) and davnen (to 
pray).">

Is there any chance "doynen" could be in any way related to the Romanian verb
"a doini" (to sing or play a doina), or is any resemblance purely coincidental?

A doina is, of course, a slow, melismatic, sometimes semi-improvisational song
(often melancholy) found in both Romanian and klezmer music.

Subject: Duchenen and superstition

Rita Falbel's query about "dukhenen" reminds me of another superstition we
youths believed in, that to look at the cohanim when their hands were
outstretched toward the congregation, fingers spread in the special
configuration, was to incur serious impairment of eyesight. One teenager, a
Levite, swore that he needed glasses soon after peeking during one such ritual.
He was convinced that he would go blind if he ever looked again.

Subject: dukhenen

In [07.079] Rita Falber says, "Does anyone recognize the word Dukhenen and
know what the derivation might be?" I quote "The Encyclopedia of the Jewish
Religion", Holt, Rinehart and Winston, New York, 1966, page 308:

"After removing their shoes and having their hands washed by the Levites,
the priests ascend the duchen (the platform before the ark; hence the
Ashkenazi expression dukhen".

I have just joined this list and have found it very enjoyable. I am sure I
will continue to enjoy and to learn.

May we all enjoy the simcha of the coming chag.

Subject: Nokh a mol davenen

A gut moed.

I was told years ago that davenen, bentshn and tsholent all came from Old
French: diviner, whatever the reflex of the Latin benedictere was, and the
appropriate antecedent of Modern French chaud/chaleur, respectively.  If this
is incorrect, would someone please explain why.

A pretty thank-you.  Be me well and strong.

Subject: superstitions

While we are on the subject of superstitions..I thought I might take the
chance to clear up one of my family's mysteries (maybe).

Well...my great aunt Charlotte (who WAS eccentric and who's family was from
Poland) used to ,every time it rained(which it frequently does in the spring
and summer in Chicago and Milwaukee) run all around the house  and put little
dishes of water on EVERY window sill...  the reason that I remember(I was
younger than 10 at the time) is that the lightning if it hit the building
would go into the dishes of water and drown! well... that doesn't seen very
likely! i don't remember who offered this explaination.... does this sound
familiar to anyone? i have no idea if this was a Jewish superstition , a
Polish superstition or just Charlotte's..in my family, at the time we did NOT
talk about when anyone did  anything  that was kind of old fashioned(IE
embarrassing!)

on another note..
when I was in my teen years, I was fooling around with my Mamma's wedding
dress, and i felt something odd in the hem, being nosy I said, hey there's
something odd here! my Mamma said no I don't think so.. I said yes, it's
heavier and lumpy here,can I look? she said oh,ok and I opened the hem and
found silver dollars with a piece of what looked like cake or salt (I'm not
sure )between she was very embarrassed and said she had NO idea what that
could be doing there!
I was happy, even though her wedding ended in a divorce, it seemed nice that
someone must have been wishing her well(probably my Bubbe,or great aunts)
any one know what this is supposed to wish? and what it was, in there with
the silver dollars?
  
thanks,

Subject: finger in fist - a fayg

Bob Poe [07.080] said: "If I remember correctly, this gesture, called `a fayg'
in Yiddish, is used to express simple defiance, etc., like the middle finger
in mainstream America, and does not necessarily have a superstitious
association."
 
In South America the Yiddish "fayg" is called "fige" (Spelling?) in Spanish
and it is a good luck charm. I used to have one made of red wood. Note what
Harkavy says about the word Fayg: (2) FICO motion of contempt made by placing
the thumb between the two fingers. 'geben a fayg' to give the fico. Weinreich,
true to his idea of keeping his dictionary clean of any vulgarities, does not
have this meaning.

Subject: Zibn und zibale

Ellen F. Prince in her discussion on "indianer and sneezing" brinngs the
following: "when uttered by someone despised -- would elicit 'Zibn! Shoyn a
lign!' (Of course, this was usually said behind the person's back, so to
speak.)"
 
That must be the explanation for the term 'zibale' which meant a child born
prematurely, supposedly on the seventh month instead of the ninth month. The
saying "she had a zibale" usually went along with a chukle, every one knew
that the girl got pregnant before the chuppah. So the Ziben = Zibale was a
lie. The usual explanation that children survived only if born on the seventh
month or on the ninth month, but did not survive if born on the eighth month,
did not make much sense and was thus a "Zibn".
