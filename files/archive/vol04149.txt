Subject: Mixed usage and mixed language

How often I ask if anyone else is familiar with the expression "Hefker-
Petrushkii" which literally means of course two things, a. Hefker, or
abandoned, or upside down and b. Petrushkii, being Russian for Punch and
Judy, the puppet clowns of internationally familiar favorite shows for
fairs and the like. In my own family, the phrase was used to indicate
states of "mixed upness" or utter confusion, but not without comic
undertones. It maight be used to describe the state of affairs in
someone's house the (mis)handling of affairs. It seems to be an example
of accent or emphasis by the use of two languages, and to "strengthen the
image" by use of the Russian. Incidentally, I have been relatively
inactive as a Mendelnik owing to the difficulty of getting "into the
system" because there are so many active users of internet and too few
lines in my department. I hope that this will be remedied shortly. Tomer
az nit, vos ken men ton?

Subject: Frug's the author!

es shaynt di levone
es glantsn di shtern etc.

is from a poem by Shimen Frug.  Sorry: no title, no book reference, page
number at my fingertips at the moment (but I bet others will come up with
those soon -- it's a well-known poem).  What I _do_ have at hand (at
head, more precisely, since it's committed to memory) is the parody
version of the opening of the poem.  Its value is of an entertainment
nature AND of a dialectological one:  two free tickets to the person who
can determine the provenance of this ditty.

es shaynt di levone
es blishtshen di shtern
ikh zits mir in gortn
un rays mir a mern.

zayts mir ale gezunt un shtark!

Subject: Stanford University Jewish Studies Program

Not likely many of you can make it, but Stanford just announced the first
annual lectures in Yiddish Studies.  Professor Dan Miron, Professor of
Jewish Literature at the Hebrew University, Columbia, and the Max
Weinreich Center for Advanced Studies will deliver two talks, one in
English and one in Yiddish on Nov. 2, and 3, respectively.

The Nov. 2 talk will be on the subject "The Literary Image of the East
European Shtetl: An Aesthetic Construct, A Historical Comment."

The Nov. 3 talk will be "Is There a Unified Modern Jewish Literature?"

Both talks will be given in the Tressider Union, the one of Nov. 2 at 8
pm in the Oak West Lounge, the one of Nov. 3 at 4 pm in the Cypress South
Lounge.

The lectures are free and open to the public.  A reception will follow
each lecture.  For more information call (415)-723-7589.

Subject: Re: Upcoming conference on Yiddish & Ashkenazic Studies

I'd like to hear from David Neal Miller as to whether or not any part of
the Conference on Yiddish and Ashkenazic Studies will be open to the
public.  I know of quite a number of us here in Columbus, some of whom
are even mendelniks, who might like to attend at least part of this
conference as interested nonprofessionals.
