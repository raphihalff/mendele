Regarding Izaly Zemtsovsky's query (Mendele 13014):

Uriel Weinreich suggests for "Keep your chin up"
the yiddish phrase: "Nisht gedayget!" which is
more: "don't worry!" but comes very near to it.

Regarding Bernard Dov Cooperman's query (Mendele 13014):

A "kanarik" is a canary.  The Moishe to whom you refer may have raised
canaries or have had them for pets.  Also, Michel Rosenberg had a comedy
monologue that he titled, "Shepsel Kanarik Fun Poughkeepsie" that dealt with
a chazan who was making "probe" (auditioning for a cantorial position).
Since a canary sings...you can make that connection yourself.

Here is an excerpt from my translation (expected to go to press in April)
of Pinkas Zamosc into English:

Jack S. Berger

*********

The times of the Polish boycott of the Jews arrived, and this affected our
`Blooms.' A certain Pole, Namislovski, founded a peasant's orchestra, a
modern one, and they usurped the place of the `Blooms' with the nobles. The
musicians then took to other lines of work, and trade as well.

After several years of the boycott, the occasion arose for a great ball at
the house of a Nobleman. The young nobles invited Namislovski's orchestra.
The old Nobleman, however, wanted the merriment to be like it was in the old
days, and he invited the `Blooms,' to enliven the guests in their style.
When the night of the ball arrived, Binyomi'leh called his sons, and
instructed them it will be necessary to prepare themselves very well for the
ball. He forbade everyone in his ensemble to drink at the ball - in order to
remain alert. His sons heeded his behest. For the whole night, both
orchestras played, one after the other; the drunken guests were required to
offer an opinion about the music. Before dawn, the old Noble asked of the
`Blooms' that they should play a `Kanarikl.' This was one of the really
artistic pieces of this ensemble, which the Noble had heard more than once.
The ensemble played this `Kanarikl' like never before. Their performance
captivated everyone. The old Noble was moved to tears, and all the guests
stood and applauded `Bravo!' Namislovski went over and shook the hand of the
boycotted Jewish musicians. Binyomi'leh's ensemble left the ball with great
honor.

Isn't kanarik just another version of soloveitchik, a canary?  Why that was
a name is perhaps the other question. Perhaps someone who sang like one.

Subject: Re: auf/oyf?

As one who never knew any pronunciation other than ohfreef until I first
left London, let me throw my oar in.

Firstly, it a khidesh to me that there ever was a place in Europe where the
word was pronounced oyfrif, but I'll accept his word for it.

The point I really want to make is that Polish Yiddish also differentiates
between prepositional 'oyf' and verbal complement 'oyf-' albeit the
differenc is less striking than in Litvish and Voliner pronunciations.

In my experience, the OHF pronunciation of 'oyf-' is longer whereas 'oyf' is
pronounced with a more clipped OF.

But where does the increasingly common AUFRUF come from? (Even my litvishe
wife has started using it!!)

Was there really such a word amongst German Jews, or have they just made it
up in Anglo-Saxon speaking lands?

Subject: VZMAY

This letter will be in Yiddish transcription.  If you are ever in need of a
place to ask "How do you say _____ in Yiddish" or What does [a Yiddish word
or phrase] mean in English", read the following:
