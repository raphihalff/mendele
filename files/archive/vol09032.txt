To my recent notice on Pious Voices: the volume of IJSL, International
Journal of the Sociology of Languages, I want to simply and most importantly
add the name of the general editor, Dr. Joshua Fishman, who supported this
project over many years in advice and encouragement as well as tracking down
other reseachers and collaborators. My heartfelt gratitude.

Subject: Yiddish romance literature

Does anyone have bibliographical information or ready data to share on the
medieval Yiddish traditions in courtly romance literature, troubador and
trouvere traditions, and Yiddish responses to the Arthurian fad from the
12th-15th centuries.  Thanks,

Subject: Il Dibuk

We all know the Yiddish film The Dybbuk (in recent years restored with some
new footage).  I understand that the source of the film is the play,
Tsvishen Tsvei Velter, by Shalom Anski. (circ. 1920)

I have recently learned that there is an Italian opera called Il Dibuk , by
Lodivico Rocca, based on the original story. According to the Grove Book of
Opera, it opened in Teatra alla Scala Milano on March 24, 1934, and was
performed from time to time in Italy until the 1980's.
 
Has anybody ever seen Il Dibuk ?  Does anyone know if there exists a
recording?  And, if it exists, how does one get a copy?

Subject: Yiddish lessons ideas

Can you direct me to any sites which provide Yiddish lessons ideas for young
adults.  I have a group of young people who want to learn more about Yiddish
and I will lead them through various grammatical, stories and humourous
ideas.  Thanks for your ideas.

Subject: diln/duln a spodek

I first came across this expression, if I remember correctly, in Ghitta
Sternberg's book about the Romanian shtetl Stefanesti, and I also heard Isa
Kremer use it in one of her songs. I didn't find "diln" in Weinreich, so I
just assumed it was a Romanian/ Bessarabian Yiddish expression. Silly me, to
miss the obvious, that in Southeasten Yiddish, the vowel vof is pronounced
like yud. 

Dil mir nisht keyn spodek! Hak mir nit keyn tshaynik, gey klop zik kop in
vant! These are all very rich expressions, and wonderful to the ear when
spoken.

Subject: frebl; frebelistn

I have found references to "frebl-kursn" and "frebelistn," presumably the
students in those courses. Can anyone help translate these terms? The
references pertain to activities in the Vilna Yiddish schools in the 1920s. 

Thank you,
Cecile Kuznitz

Subject: Mikhl Hertzog on kitke

Thanks to Mikhl Hertzog, I know a (to me) new yidish word.  Our family and
friends never used 'kitke': ours was the yidish of Lublin province and Volin
(Volhynia), with enunciation modified by Vilna.  As asked for in the bakery,
the Friday night-Shabbes khale was either a 'geflokhtene khale' or
'koylitch' or 'koyletch' - the braided khale; or a 'bulke khale' - the
oblong khale with sections; or 'a khale mit a flekhtl' or a 'flekhtl khale'. 
The latter is a plain (no egg), lozenge shaped khale with a thin braid laid
across its length.  This braid is 'dos flekhtl', regarded as a treat by the
children. 

The Rosh Hashana khale is round, turban shaped, called a 'foygl'.

Subject: u as i in Brezin

Mikhl Herzog says kime, piter, git, etc. in which the etymological "u" is
realized as "i" is of Southern Yiddish, possibly Southeastern Ukraine. My
people came from Brezin, a town near Lodz, Poland and that is exactly how
we pronounced those words.  I never thought of Lodz being southern or in
the Ukraine.Is there any connection?

Subject: word on a jar

Several years ago my parents brought me back from a trip to Hungary a ceramic 
jar with a carved wooden top (most likely a reproduction) that resembled an 
old medicine jar, with the following hebrew letters on the front: 
zayin-nun-gimel-bet-yud-lamed sofit. The first letter, I presume a zayin, 
also resembles a daled. Does anyone know what word this might be? I am 
guessing that it is some sort of medicine or remedy.
