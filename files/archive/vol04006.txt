Subject: Introduction

My name is Larry Rosenwald, and I teach English at Wellesley College.
I've probably corresponded with some of you, during the time when I was
co-editor of a prospective Schocken anthology of American Yiddish prose.
(The anthology is on hold, by the way;  I don't know what plans Schocken
has for it.)  I learned my Yiddish from Pearl Kahan, at the University of
Chicago; I've done a little translating (a story by I. J. Singer) and
some teaching of Yiddish material.

Two questions, one general and one specific.

1) I'm working on a big project I call Multilingual America, on scenes of
language and dialect contact in American writing.  I'd like there to be a
chapter on Yiddish as an example, neither typical nor unrepresentative,
of what happens to immigrant languages in America.  I have some sense of
what English texts are central for me;  but I'd appreciate any
suggestions of Yiddish texts that reflect on, or portray, the relations
between Yiddish and English in America.

2) I had a student this last semester working on Yiddish who did a
translation of a Peretz story called "A Khanike-Lempl."  In that story
there's a phrase about someone eagerly seizing something "vi tsu/oyf [I
can't remember and have no access to the book at the moment] a heysn
poplinik."  I can't find poplinik, either in my dictionaries or through
consultation with Slavicist colleagues.  Anyone know the word or the
phrase?

A sheynem dank,

Subject: Verb-Adj vs. Adj-Verb word order

A slightly belated answer to Holger Nath:

This is how I (at least currently) see the situation (in very general and
crude terms):  adjectival phrases, like noun phrases and adverbial
phrases, can be scrambled in Yiddish if their content is not focused.  By
scrambling I mean movement of a constituent to a non-base-generated
position following the tensed verb.  In your (a)-sentence (slightly
modified):

a. s'iz gegangen a shpreyregn.  azoy vi er hot nit gehat ken shirem iz er
nas gevorn

since the rain was going on for a while (as per the first sentence), the
fact that the guy is getting wet is not new information -- speaker may
imply and hearer may infer that, standing in a drizzle without an
umbrella, one will get wet.  In (b):

b. beshas er iz gegangen af der gas hot zikh plutsem ongehoybn a shturem,
iz er gevorn nas

the fact that the guy got wet IS new information:  from the context we
don't have reason to believe necessarily that he got wet, because the
strom had just begun and the guy might have taken out an umbrella,
might've run for shelter, etc.  Compare:

c. s'iz geven a sheyner tog.  di zun hot geshaynt.  bin ikh mir
aroysgegangen fun shtub un mit a mol bin ikh gevorn nas.  imetser hot af
mir oysgegosn an emer mit vaser!

		vs.

d. ...aroysgegangen fun shtub un mit a mol bin ikh nas gevorn. ...

Methinks (c) is awkward, infelicitous.  Do native speakers with very,
very fine judgments concur?

As for nekome nemen vs. nemen nekome, I think the difference is that the
first is a "periphrastic" verb and the second isn't.  Periphrastics have
fixed word order, e.g. ikh vel morgn khasene hobn *ikh vel morgn hobn
khasene So there would be two dictionary entries: 1. [nekome nemen] --
periphrastic verb ex.:  ikh vel in im nekome nemen 2. [nemen] + [nekome]
-- verb + complement (idiomatic expression) ex.:  ikh vel in im nemen
nekome If nekome in #2 is scrambled for discourse-pragmatic reasons, it
looks like #1.

If the compilers of the Russian-Yiddish dcitionary meant something by the
apparent distinction that you cite: blednet'	BLAS VERN poblednet'
VERN BLAS this is quite insightful.  But isn't the order inconsistent?
You gave another example: krepnut'	VERN SHTARKER okrepnut'	SHTARKER
VERN In the case of blas vern, the order Adj. + Verb is associated with
the Russian imperfective form, but in the case of shtarker vern, that
same Yiddish order is glossed with the Russian perfective form (if I'm
right that okrepnut' and poblednet' are perfective -- my knowledge of
Russian is minimal).

Incidentally, the last living editor of the Russian-Yiddish Dictionary
died just recently, Moyni Shulman.  See obituary on last page of Forverts
of three (?) weeks ago.

Subject: The stem construction

A belated answer to Beatrice Santorini:

A _makh_ is a physical gesture, a gesticulation.  The use is quite
general, as opposed to the English counterparts -- a wave [of the hand]
(a makh mit der hant), a wag [of the tail] (a makh mitn ek/veydl).  All
derived from makhn mitn ek, makhn mit der hant, makhn mit di zaytn (one
of the humorous an- swers to "vos makhstu?").  So the sentence from
_Grine felder_,

	me tor nisht a makh ton mitn hant af a dorfmentshn

means:  'One shouldn't dismiss a villager' (as in the idiomatic
expression:  avekmakhn X mit der hant -- 'wave away, dismiss somebody').

In instances of the so-called stem construction, there is indeed
variation possible wrt whether the stem preceds or follows ton/gebn.  I
think, however, that there is NO variation wrt possible orders for
invariants which are composed of stem+particle; i.e. (a) and (b) are
possible, but only (c) and not (d) is possible: (a) er hot a
zog/shprung/... gegebn/geton (b) er hot gegebn/geton a zog/shprung/...
(c) er hot gegebn/geton a shray oys/shtey uf/... (d) *er hot a shray
oys/shtey uf gegebn/geton So there's a lot of explaining to be done.
Incidentally, I changed your _gebn a geshrey oys_ to _...a shray oys_,
which is also fine, just to be consistent with the other stems given.
_geshrey_ is an interesting case of a non-stem which can have the stem
construction apply to it.

Somebody who is more versed in Yiddish historical linguistics than I:
what's the story behind the vowel shift in _shray_ --> _geshrey_?
