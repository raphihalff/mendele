i believe all the 'strange death' definitions given, but
the only way i've ever heard it used is in the way david
hirsch notes, describing color, e.g. 'a mise meshine green'
= 'a sickly green'. it was definitely used as an adjective
or adverb, never as a noun. wonder if there was some sort
of reanalysis of it as related to mi(e)s 'ugly'?

1. I've seen and heard 'meyashev' used in several ways:

bin ikh meyashev
bin ikh mir meyashev  
bin ikh zikh meyashev

Does this interest grammarians?

2. Meyashev is often used for ironic or comic effect:

Iz zikh meyashev dos redl un falt arop fun vogn.
Iz er meyashev un heybt on shrayen 'Gevald! A fayer!'

Which is something like the American 'he upped (or went)
and died'. Do other European languages go in for this sort
of thing?

Subject:  Shmendrik

I can't believe I'm actually writing this.  Anyway, in vol.
2, no. 13, Dovid Braun writes:  "We know who coined the
word!  [I wish I remembered who the coiner was. . .]" Well,
I don't know if Abraham (Avrom) Goldfaden COINED the word,
but he certainly is responsible for popularizing it.  The
earliest edition of Goldfaden's "Shmendrik" that we have in
the YIVO Library was published in Odessa, 1879, i.e., VERY
early in Goldfaden's illustrious theatrical career.  For
further information, I recom- mend that readers of MENDELE
consult Zylbercweig's Yiddish theater lexicon or numerous
sources on Goldfaden that are available in libraries near
you.

Subject: Mise-meshune

The expression "mise-meshune" is used in the Morning
Blessings, before the Order of the Sacrifices. There is a
section called Tefilas Rabi which says,

        "It should be your will .... to rescue us this day
        and all days from Aze-Ponim and Azus-Ponim, ...,
        from libels, mi'MISA MESHUNA, from bad diseases,
        ... "

David Hirsch writes:

>feminine for "mies", I think, meaning ugly.

while Seymour Axelrod writes:

The first element seems unrelated to MIES, "ugly."  Is it
related to mem/sof [MES] "dead body, ghost"?

*****************

As a number of reporters noted, the expression is derived
from the Ashkenakic pronounciation of mita m'shu-ne [yes,
same root as mes or met in Sephardic Hebrew].

The "derivation" from mies is quite common, a result
probably of the Ashkenazic indifference to samech-sof
differences, while Sephardic is indifferent to sof-tof
nuances.  Mies, I would guess is derived from
mem-aleph-samech, or mi-us, disgusting in Hebrew, as in
pasul m'hamas[t] mi-us.
