        Which leads me to another vocabulary question: for
        lack of a good Yiddish word, my kids use "vatchen"
        for watch, as for example if I'm assembling
        something and they want to watch me ("kon ikh dikh
        vatchen?").  Similarly, "vatchn TV". Any
        suggestions that don't sound stilted?
 
I would use plain 'kiken' ('bakiken'/'unkiken' in the
transitive case).

        My feeling is that bal and bar may only be used
        with nouns and they imply a certain amount of
        possession vis-a-vis the noun.  This would fit bal
        guf, bal agule, bal shem tov, balebos, etc;
 
In fact 'ba`al' means 'owner'/'possessor' in Hebrew; that's
the sense of ba`al as husband -- even it dismays some.
 
        With bar oyfes, I can immediately see bird keeper,
        but bird watcher seems farfetched.  Perhaps
        mistakel oyf (on the pattern of mokher sforim?).
        melekh.
 
Why not use 'tsoife oyfen' which is even closer to Hebrew;
'bar oifes' certainly doesn't mean bird-watcher for *me*,
but I ain't neither a native Yiddish nor a native English
(nor even Hebrew) speaker.

Subject: David Sherman's Krign, Watch T.V.

David: I see the problem with "get" since it's a degenerate
case in English, both passive and active.  Vos ken men ton?
My son just learned his first pseudo-word yesterday,
'Dada', so right now he uses it to express everything he
wants to say to me!

Re: "vatchen", which I assume is really "vatshn" in YIVO:
In English, "look [at]" and "see" are the active and
passive forms, analogous to "listen" and "hear".  The
English "watch" also seems to be used as an active form of
"see", but my gut feeling is that it's weird or special in
some way.  In Yiddish, there's "kukn" for "look [at]" and
"zehen" for the passive form, "see", but I don't know a
word for "watch", which in some contexts is very active,
e.g.,

	Watch the kids for me while I go next door.
	
implies considerably more activity than "Look at the kids
..." or "See the kids ...".  In Yiddish, there's an
expression that literally means "keep an eye on", that
would be appropriate in this context, but not for T.V.

I almost wonder if "watch T.V." may be a misnomer in
English, since it isn't very active.  In fact, some people
still say "look at T.V.", which is analogous to "listen to
radio".

Perhaps the etymologists can enlighten us on why we say
"watch T.V.", and where "watch" came from.

So my guess for "watch TV" is that one would use either
"kukn" or "zehen". Thus, "ikh vil zehen 'L.A. LAW'" sounds
OK for "I want to watch 'L.A. LAW'", which could also be
rendered "I want to see 'L.A. LAW'".  In my limited
Yiddish, the more generic "I want to watch TV" could be
"ikh vil kukn oyf televizshn", where the fact that there's
no definite article before "televizshn" signals that I want
to watch what's on T.V., rather than the T.V. set itself. I
also assume that T.V. is English (in Yiddish, would it be
"tes vov vov"???).

For "May I watch [what you're doing]?", how about "ken ikh
kukn [oyf vos du tust]?"?  Or if they really mean they want
to look AND COMMENT, how about using "kibitsn", which seems
more honest than just "watch"?

As usual, I have a frage of my own:

My native-Yiddish-speaking grandmother used to say  "di
mime hodel hot genemen 'care' oyf untz" (Aunt Hodel took
care of us).  Vizoy zogt men 'take care of' oyf Yidish?

Regarding dave's comment on his kids' use of vatchen,
Mexican-Americans near the El Paso border ( I don't know of
other places) use watchear for 'to watch'. bay undz nitst
men 'afkikn af televizye'.

A correction to my previous posting regarding 'watching
television'. My wife informs me that what she uses is 'kikn
af televizye' and not 'afkikn af televizye'.  Sorry for the
error  (as might be obvisou, I myself do not use these
terms regularly. melekh.
