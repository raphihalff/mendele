Subject: Yiddish in Sunday Times acrostic

Dear Mendelyaner,  Again we want to note two Yiddish definitions in the
Sunday Times acrostic.   One asks for "snacks, from the Yiddish"  which
turns out to be "noshables".  Dpes anyone know this word?  The second
item does not mention the Yiddish connection; it simply asks for - note
this - a"Polish-born American novelist and dramatist (l880-l957)." which
is Sholem Asch.  Yiddish literature, it seems, cannot claim its  own
great authors. Don't they still slight Sholem Aleichem too as being an
Ukrainian writer without mentioning his Yiddishkeyt?

Subject: Slavic influences on Yiddish syntax

thanks to meyer-leyb wolf for suggesting that yiddish multiple
wh-questions may be possible only in embedded clauses. molly diesing
made a similar point in email. interesting! the plot thickens! can't
wait for the syntacticians to figure this one out. in any event, that's
a nice bit of evidence that the yiddish form, whatever it is, isn't
simply lifted from slavic.

re english 'go tell aunt rhodie' as a double imperative, it's a
puzzlement. the problem, as i see it, is that english doesn't
distinguish formally between the infinitive and the imperative, so how
can we tell if 'go tell' is 'gey(t) dertseyln' or 'gey(t) dertseyl(t)'?
but you are absolutely right that 'don't go tell' is weird. (actually,
'don't go tell him that i said that' sounds not too bad to me -- but
'don't go dance' is totally impossible.) of course, if 'tell' is an
infinitive, we should expect 'go tell' in non-imperative modalities --
but we don't find anything like 'i went tell aunt rhodie', 'i'm going
tell aunt rhodie' -- tho we do get it when BOTH 'go' AND 'tell' are
infinitive -- 'i must go tell aunt rhodie.' in any event, i agree with
you entirely, whatever it is, it's murky in english as well as in
yiddish and is therefore very likely to be germanic.

a dank!

Subject: Jet-lag af Yidish

Khayem Bochner (6.156,1) likes a great deal the phrase _khulshe
d'porkhe_ that David Herscovic suggested for Jet-lag af Yidish.

But then he writes:  "Farshteyt zikh az s'iz shver ayntsure(y)dn dem
oylem ontsunemen a wort ven men muz es derklern jedes mol [Of course it
is difficult to persuade speakers to accept a word that (its meaning)
has to be explained each time].

Therein lies the problem:  Such required explanations of the term, or
its new meaning, would certainly lead to conversational "detours" and to
futile, heated disputes, sometimes especially with people who normally
have very, very little to do with the creative aspects of the language .

Bochner also adds:  "Ikh volt oykh nit gevust mit vos me est es" [I
myself would not know which eating utensils to use)].  I dare say that
the overwhelming secular majority of Yiddish speakers would not only not
know "mit vos me est es,"  but would also experience an obvious
difficulty with "digesting" it, with grasping it at once without a
lengthy explanation. . Both of Bochner's statements are an exceptionally
poor recommendation for the use of "khulshe d'porkhe" in Yiddish for jet
lag.

A nay geshafn wort [a newly coined neologism], or the use of an already
existing word or expression with a totally new meaning, should ideally
be self-evident, readily understood and recognized at first hearing and
reading, to a degree -- but  only  to  a _minute_ degree -- hamtsO'esdik
(innovative), in a construction familiar and proper to the language into
which it is proposed.

For all of the above criteria I opt (personal bias) for my own  proposed
_fli-mid_ , Yiddish for "jet lag" (6.147), vs. the Hebrew-Aramaic
lomdish [learned] "khulshe d'porkhe."

The use of "fli-mid" is self-understood and sounds so natural in Yiddish
that it will not incite any sharp "liguistical" disputes, nor cause any
deconstructive conversational detours.

Dan Leeson (6.150,2) argues against my proposed _fli-mid_ because it
fails to cover the actual causes of jet lag -- the changes of time zones
and the body's disturbed biological clock.

It is my sense that a neologism does not necessarily have to cover each
and all of the causes involved in the resultant phenomenon.  _Fli-mid_
meets the several conditions cited above for the introduction of a new
term, and uses for its construction simple and familiar Yiddish words.

_Fli-mid_   conveys clearly and explicitly the general sense of fatigue
and weariness that one feels in the bones and muscles after a lengthy
flight, and that is the essence in our search for a Yiddish equivalent
of the English term.

Subject: Sui generis-fun latayn oyf yidish

Keyle Goodman fregt vi azoy tsu zogn sui generis oyf yidish [6.144]. Ikh
hob gefunen dem oysdruk in eyn yidishn verterbukh-[English-Yiddish
Encyclopedic Dictionary-Paul Abelson Ph. D. editor, 1924].

sui generis--in eygener art, eygnartik.

Weinreich zetst iber eygnartik vi- -peculiar to.

In Englishe verterbikher gefint men: in a class by oneself, one of a
kind, unique.

In yidish ken men zogn: eyntsik, eyn-un eyntsik, yokhid bemine, eyne in
