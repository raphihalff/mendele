Subject: Introduction

My name is Benjamin Micah Weiner (Binyomin.)  I'm a senior at Columbia,
studying Yiddish with Miriam Hoffman.  As of now, my major Yiddish
passion is with the poets, but in class, we are reading (very slowly)
some of Chaim Grade's prose which I also like very much. So how's that
for a brief introdcution?  Looking forward to having more to say,

Subject: Bruklin yiddish?

Martin Davis hut geshriben az de vurt far "scrotum" is 'mekel'.  Es dacht
zich mir oz er meint 'shmekel' for /penis un er muz visen oz 'scrotum. or
testicles', in yiddish is 'baytzim'.   At least that was the way I
learned it from my early days in the Bronx, until 1934, and my relocation
to Brooklyn at that time.

Since I retired about 7 years ago and moved to the Gan Eden of South
Carolina 4 years ago, I am grateful for being able to keep in touch with
the shprach and yiddishe things.   'swonderful!!

Subject: Whence shulamis?

Dovid Braun asks where shulamis comes from.  I would say it refers to the
Shulamite in Song of Solomon in ashkenazic pronunciation.

Song of Solomon 6:13

Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon
thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two
armies.

Incidentally, Sholem Aleichem wrote his children's lullaby, "Shlof Mayn
Kind," in 1892 using Shulamis as his pseudonym.  I don't know whether he
wrote it before or after Goldfaden's musical drama, "Shulamis."

Subject: Shulamis

In mendele 4.166 Dovid Braun asked:

>Does anyone know where the name _shulamis_ comes from (i.e. any Judaic
>source familiar to you)?

Sure.  It appears in the Tanakh, in Shir HaShirim 7.1, twice.  The
root appears to be that of shalom.  For what it's worth, according
to Mandelkern's _Concordance_ the word is translated 'Shunamit'
(woman from Shunem) in the Septuagint and Vulgate.  However, he
says, it may mean 'woman from Shalem (i.e., Yerushalayim),' or
possibly have something to do with paying (leshalem).

Subject: (h)am, (h)amenyu, amtshi

_(h)am_ is Yiddish kid's language (or probably caretaker language -
they've gotta learn the word from somewhere) for 'food' or 'eating'.
Mother (or whoever) brings spoon towards baby's mouth and says
"ham-ham-ham-ham..." until baby opens mouth and food disappears.

From there, the noun; and from the noun, further diminutives (I only knew
of _hamenyu_, and in Rovne, apparently, _amtshi_).

Reminiscent, by the way, of English kids' language _yum, yummy_, which
means not just 'food', but 'the food is good' (as we all probably know).

Subject: (h)am, (h)am

(H)eynekh:
(h)am, (h)am (and, I presume, its derivative "amtshi") is
explicitly part of Yiddish baby talk, the forerunner of "es,es,
mayn kind".

Subject: "Hobn" auxiliary

"Hobn" used exclusively for the present perfect is interesting. Now,
Isaac Bashevis Singer's pluperfect is "Er iz gehat gelofn".In the
Northeast somewher they say Er iz gevest gelofn. My German relatives have
confirmed for me that these also occur in German. Geweest is standard
Dutch for geven.

Subject: Romanization

Mendele takes great pleasure in calling your attention to Vol 4.170
which consists of the long-awaited "faq" on romanization/transcription.
Numerous hands have been involved, including Ellen Prince and Mikhl
Herzog.  Zellig Bach, on whose earlier post this document is built,
deserves special thanks.  The really heavy lifting was done by Arn
Abramson and Shleyme Axelrod.  A hartsikn yasher koyekh ale.

The document will also be placed in the archives under the name
transcription.faq.
