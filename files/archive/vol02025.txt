Subject: Romanization

Using a standardized system of Romanization (or
transcription or transliteration) is extremely important
for lexicographic or bibliographic work, morphological
analysis, and many other purposes, but there are times when
no simple a-priori policy will do and some ad-hoc
makeshifts are better. Here's an example.  I was recently
asked to translate a ketubah/ksube which had been written
in Poland about 80 years ago.  Meyle, the frozen, obsolete
Hebrew-Aramaic legalese was murder to try to express in
English; my question has to do with the names and a few
Hebrew words that I wanted to retain in the translation.
Normally, I like to use the standard Yiddish romanization
and the Library of Congress romanization for Hebrew.  They
have a lot in common, such as kh for khof, ts for tsadik,
sh for shin, and they both omit a lot of the complications
of other systems.  Here are a few examples that appeared in
this marriage contract, in both systems (omitting the dots
under some of the h's).

tena'im/tnoyem
ketubta' de-'irkesa'/ksubte de-irkese (de-irkeso?)
Ya`akov/Yankev (Yankoyv?  Yaakoyv?)
Shelomoh/Shloyme (whole Hebrew shloymoy?)
Tsevi 'Aryeh/Tsvi Arye
Hayim Haykil (written with -kuf-YUD-lamed)/Khayem Khaykl
Rahel/Rokhl
huppah/khupe
Avraham/Avrohom
Shevat/Shvat (the name of the month)

The problem is that some of these are clearly
loshn-koydesh, not Yiddish, others clearly Yiddish (e.g.
Khaykl and the family names), others could go either way.
A uniform system to accommodate both there isn't.  You
COULD say, [here imagine gemore-intonation], all of these
were written and pronounced by Yiddish speakers, including
my client's parents, so stick with the Yiddish system,
hence tnoyem, khupe, Rokhl, Shloyme (Shloymoy?).  But I
think those would look absurd to my client.  After all,
people are ACCUSTOMED to seeing Sefardic-Hebrew-based
romanized spellings and pronouncing them more or less as in
Yiddish.  So I think I'll have to make a lot of
compromises.  Such things must come up all the time in
genealogical and historical work.  Does anyone have
suggestions or experience, or off-the-cuff feelings, to
offer?

Subject:  National Yiddish Book Center

For MENDELE subscribers who make use of the National
Yiddish Book Center, that organization has a new mailing
address and telephone number (I don't recall seeing this
information conveyed in previous issues of MENDELE):

National Yiddish Book Center
48 Woodbridge Street
South Hadley, MA 01075
Tel. (413) 535-1303
Fax (413) 535-1007

The Book Center has moved to temporary quarters (3 years, I
am told) on the Mount Holyoke College campus, while they
try to raise funds for a permanent structure on the
Hampshire College campus.  Their warehouse is still in
Holyoke, Mass., and the phone number remains the same:
(413)536-0584.

Subject: Schlemiel revisited

I would like to return to my friends, Reb Shlimmazal and
Herr Schlemiel.

Mordkhe Schaechter was quoted some time ago, who argues
(Yiddish II) that the difference between them is dialectal:
"Schlemiel" is used in the West, while "Shlimm-mazal" in
the East. This is unfortunately not entirely correct,
although Bernstein's collection of Central-Yiddish proverbs
uses "Schlemiel" as the German translation of
"Shlimm-mazalnik". "Schlemiel" indeed does not appear in
Eastern Europe (although the "Book of Jewish proverbs" has
a quotation from Sholem Alechem), but "Schlammassel"
appears in Germany, both in Jewish and non-Jewish sources.
The dictionary of the Grimm brothers, Schmeller's Bavarian
dictionary, H. Fischer's Swabian dictionary, just to
mention the most important ones. The word "Shlimm-mazal"
appears several times in Tendlau's collection of
Judeo-German proverbs (1860), and in Herz's Esther (Fuerth:
1828).

On the other hand I was eager to hear something else. When
I wrote that the earliest occurrence of these words is from
1784 (both in the same book, published in Prague!!), I
hoped that an expert of early-Yiddish will jump on me with
a quotation from an early source, let's say the
"Melokim-buk" (it is not there, I checked). So let me ask:
In return for proper acknowledgment in a footnote, is
anybody aware of the occurrence of the words "Schlemiel"
and/or "Shlimm-mazal" in any source in any language
(dialect) prior to 1800?

Thanks.
