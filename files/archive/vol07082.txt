Subject: dukhnen

Rita Falbel asks, "The discussions on the derivation of davenen reminded me
of another word that my father used, to refer to the kohanim's blessings 
during the high holidays.  Does anyone recognize the word dukhenen, and know
what the derivation might be."

>From the meaning of the word and its Hebraic spelling I have always thought
_dukhn-en_ had to have come from the Hebrew _dukhan_ 'platform' (_dukhon_ in
the surely Ashkenazic Hebrew source). The members of the priestly class, the
kohanim, on whom it is incumbent to pronounce the priestly blessing upon the
congregation on certain holidays and, in some parts of the world, every
Sabbath, face the congregation with their backs to the ark containing the Tora
scrolls while, under the leadership of the prayer leader, pronouncing the
blessing. Commonly, then, they are on a dais or platform where the ark stands.

Subject: Tum balalayke

Alexander Maxwell (Vol 07.079) asks about the line in Tum balalayke 'vos ken
vaksen, vaksen on regn --> a shteyn kan vaksn, vaksn on regn'. [what can grow
without rain? A stone can grow without rain.]

The thought that comes to my mind when singing this line is of anger, which
becomes like a stone, growing harder with time.

Subject: Peddlers in Vietnam, too?

Melekh Godfrey tells of tum balalayke also being a Vietnamese song.

The following, perhaps related story, was told to me 40 years ago by a famous
musicologist whose son was a musico-ethnologist.  The son attended a
conference where one of the more exciting papers was given by a man who had
succeeded in reaching an isolated South American Indian tribe, never before
visited by white men with a battery operated tape recorder and recorded their
music.  When he played the tape, one of the audience caused a disturbance by
jumping up and shouting, "Those are Polish Jewish Hassidic melodies."

The story becomes more interesting when the researcher presented a paper a few
years later in apology.  The new story, prompted by the reference to Hassidic
melodies, was as follows.  One of the older Indians remembered that some 60
years earlier a peddler had come to the village and was trapped there for a
long time, more than a month, perhaps even as long as two.  At that time, as
they warmed themselves, taking shelter from the rain, he would sing to them
and teach them his songs.

[Intrepid Jewish] Peddlers in Vietnam, too?

Subject: dukhenen

Rita Falbel raises an interesting question [07.079:9] re the etymology of
'dukhenen' on which I have pondered before without coming to any very definite
conclusion. At first sight, it seems obviously derived from Hebrew ''alah
ladukhan' 'to ascend to the platform or deliver the priestly blessing', but
when one reflects that Polish 'duch' means 'spirit' and 'stan duchowny' means
'priesthood or clergy' [there are cognate Ukrainian expressions that need not
detain us] two other possibilities suggest themselves, viz. 1. this is once
again a case of polygenetic, mutually reinforcing derivation or 2. and
potentially more interesting, if it could be substantiated, that the Hebrew
expression (not, of course, the word 'dukhan') is derived (by a kind of
Volksetymologie) from the Yiddish 'dukhenen' and hence ultimately from a
Slavic source, rather in the way that the familiar Israeli tag 'mah nishmah?'
comes by way of 'vos hert zikh?' from Polish 'co slychac'. Of course, if the
phrase cited from _Shulkhn orekh_ by Yussil Weiss [07.080:8] can be shown to
come from Caro's original text and not from Isserles or a subsequent
Ashkenazic commentator then this second possibility collapses. Can someone
instruct us on this point?

Subject: zol mir zayn far dir...

I remember that my mother, when she held her grandchildren, would always 
chant: "mir far dayne beyndelekh" and "mir far dayne tseynedelekh".

I had never heard it used by anyone else and always thought it unique to
her. Thanks to Mendele I now see the connection.

Subject: Sneeze protocols

In Mendele 7.078, Ellen Prince reports her family's sequence of responses to
sneezes (to ward off evil), including: 'Tsum gezunt!' and 'Lang lebn!' She
reported mysteriously that the familially correct response to the third sneeze
was "'Nis deroyf!' or something like that."

My family had similar protocols for sneezes: `Tsum gezint (revealing my
Galitzianer roots),' `Tsum leben,' and `Tsum lange yuer.'  However, we
occasionally used Ellen's mysterious third protocol, which didn't sound
Yiddish to me.  I heard it as `nazdrovye.'  When I was older, I finally
figured out that the expression was simply the Russian `Na zdarovye,' which I
believe means simply `to health,' and is one of many toasts used in Russia
for that ever-present shot of vodka.

Subject: Tum Balalaika and Superstitions

I'll take the opportunity to comment on two postings.  Referring to Alexander
Maxwell's query about what "..a stone can grow without rain" means, it was
explained to me that it described simple wind erosion around any  boulder or
stone that would make it appear larger and larger.  It sounded perfectly
logical to me as a child..and still does. 

As for Ellen Prince's litany of superstitious practices, I found myself 
nodding my head in recognition as I read them.  I'd like to add one of my 
Bubba's.  When my husband was drafted during the Korean War she made him a
little fabric packet sewn around a piece of the afikomen from the last seder
and told him to keep it with him all the time.  He kept it in his 
wallet/pocket all during the duration and, I must say, it certainly didn't
hurt since he brought it back safe and sound (him and the packet)  (For the
record...I still have it in my "memory box"!)

Happy Simkhat Torah to all....

Subject: Tum Balalayke in Vietnamese and Yiddish in Libraries

I too found out that Tum Balalayke has made it into the Vietnamese repertoire
-- by hearing it in Vietnamese in a restaurant. It was a very disconcerting
experience. And yes, it was played very slowly with a lot of pathos. About a
week after that, I heard Yidishe Mama in Japanese, also in a restaurant.
Anyone want to conjecture about how either of these songs migrated?

On a more serious note, I am looking for information regarding Yiddish and
libraries. I'm a graduate student in Library Studies and I haven't narrowed
my topic so any citations on any aspect of Yiddish in librarianship would be
useful at this point. You can e-mail me directly.

Thank you.
