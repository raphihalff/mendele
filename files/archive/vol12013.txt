Subject: Dictionnaire Yiddish-Francais

There has recently been some not terribly well informed discussion on
our sister mailing-list UYIP re Yiddish dictionaries. It occurs to me
that perhaps it would not be entirely amiss if I were to repeat here
what I said there:

Of course, the current state of Yiddish lexicography is not overly
felicitious. In addition to the works mentioned by colleagues [i.e.
Weinreich (1968), Harkavy (1928/ 1988), Niborski (1997) etc.] it is
often necessary to have recourse to the various
"component-dictionaries", i.e. dictionaries of Hebrew, Aramaic, Middle
High German, Polish and particlarly Ukrainian, as well as to the four
existing volumes of the _Groyser verterbukh_, but I am very surprised
that so far nobody has mentioned that the situation has recently been
substantially improved by the appearance of Yitskhok Niborski's
_Dictionnaire Yiddish-Francais_, Paris: Bibliothäque Medem, 2002,
632pp. [ISBN: 2-9511372-7-3], Euros 32.00 [h.b.], which with its 37,000
lemata has now (for more than six months already) become undoubtedly
the finest single-volume Yiddish dictionary in existence, despite the
fact that unfortunately it does not incorporate 100% of the lemata and
all the rich phraseology to be found in his earlier _Verterbukh fun
loshn-koydesh shtamike verter in yidish_, Paris, Bibliothäque Medem,
1997, 306pp. [ISBN: 2-9511372-0-6]. Naturally, for English (or any
other language)-Yiddish Uriel Weinreich (1968) remains unsurpassed,
even allowing for M. Tsanin, _Fuler hebreish-yidisher verterbukh_, Tel
Aviv: H.Leyvik Farlag, 1983, 888pp.

As I wrote to a friend recently, "Niborski and his co-author Bernard
Vaisbrot (with the assistance of Simon Neuberg) have done exactly what
many of us have been advocating for years. They have created a
dictionary which combines the philological virtues of Weinreich with
the breadth of vocabulary of Harkavy, Niborski's own dictionary of
Hebraisms, Stutshkov's _Oytser_ and material from the _Groyser
verterbukh_.
        
The next stage would be to do the same thing in English, but on an even
larger scale, by taking more material from the _Groyser_ (and its
archive) and inviting people who have been annotating their
dictionaries for decades to submit material. In addition more citations
of usage from authors' works (as already in the _Groyser_) should be
included. The resultant work could be in two volumes, be called the
_Kurtser_ and play a role corresponding to the _Shorter OED_.
Pipe-dreams, I suppose."

p.s. Both the Niborski dictionaries are available direct from the
Bibliothäque Medem, 52 rue RenÇ-Boulanger, 75010 Paris,

Subject: Aharon Tseytlns poem

Dear Mendelianer, dear friends,

Who can help me? I am writing a chapter on Yiddish and Jewish-Polish
literature in Poland for a new History of Polish Literature to be
published in Italy by Einaudi. I need the Yiddish version of some lines
of the famous poem by Aharon Tseytln "Once upon a time in Poland"  
(1946), that I know only in the Polish translations. In English it
could roughly sound as "It has been a long time ago/in a certain
country/a long long time ago/Once upon a time, in Poland" (The Polish
translation is: "Bylo to dawno temu/w jakies krainie,/bardzo dawno
temu/kiedys w Polsce"). I need also the exact Yiddish quotation of the
famous 'slogan' by Sholem Ash, "Vistula speaks Yiddish to me". Thank
you in advance for your help - A sheynem, a groysem dank!

Subject: how is "lamed yod" pronounced?

Dear friends, 

Would "lialke" be pronounced identically if written "lalke"? ie is the
orthography a pre-YIVO historical accident only? Or is it to indicate a
softer L sound than otherwise? A friend has suggested moreover, that
the yod is sometimes used to show accent, eg, kapelie, not
pronunciation. Your comments would be appreciated.

Subject: a folkloristishe frage

Tayere Mendelyaner,

Does anyone know the Yiddish parody (sung in my family) on the part of
the Passover Seder that is based on Psalm 115, which mocks the idols?  
The parody starts with the first Hebrew line "eynayim lahem ve'lo
yir'u"  (they have eyes but do not see), then translates "oygn hobn zey
un zeen nit," then mocks: "oy iz tsu zey un vey iz tsu zey, a blindn
getshik hobn zey."  As the Hebrew continues, mentioning ears, mouth,
nose -- the Yiddish follows derisively: "a toybn getshik... a shtumen
getshik... a fonfevatn getshik."  I am looking for a source or
documented tradition.  Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

A sheynem dank alemen,

Yael Chaver

Subject: Dogma or semantics?

The Yiddish 'apikoyres' is a sad figure, despite his epicurian origin.
Being an 'apikoyres' in the nineteenth century meant that one was
attracted to the ideas of the 'haskole' movement that one was a
'maskl', a believer in enlightment, western education. During the
second half of the nineteenth century being married to an 'apikoyres'
provided a woman with grounds for getting a 'get', a divorce.

Hebrew and Yiddish dictionaries appear to side against the 'apikoyres'.
Though several Yiddish dictionaries agree that an 'apikoyres' is merely
a free-thinker or an atheist, others insist that he is a heretic.

The standard defenition of a 'heritic' does not square with the meaning
'freethinker' or 'atheist'. For someone who abandons a faith or a
religion, English uses the word 'apostate'.

However, Hebrew and Yiddish dictionaries agree that an apostate is a
'meshumed', while a meshumed is someone who has converted to another
religion, notably the Christian religion.

I wonder how this change in meaning, whereby an apostate became a
heretic came about.

Toe illustrate the problem I give what I have found on the subject in
several dictionaries:

Subject: lullaby

Hi,
  
I'm trying to find a recording of a Yiddish Lullaby my parents used to
sing to me, for my 2 year old daughter.  Unfortunately, I don't know
what it's called.  Phonetically, it begins:  I le loo le, mein
gedoo-le, shlof ze aygaloch tzu
  
If you can be of any help, I would greatly appreciate it.

Subject: Seeking a reference

I am seeking a reference to a short story in which the "hero" is a man
whose main role in his shtetl is to receive the aliyah in which the
tochechah (Parashat Ki Tavo) is read.  The man leaves town and the
townspeople are in a quandry.  If you are familiar with this story, I
would appreciate the title and author.
