Subject: Occupational names and women

As women in the millions entered the work force during World War II, and as
societal changes brought about the relatively new phenomenon of two-income
families, a new movement for a _gender-neutral_ nomenclature of the
professions came into being.  The _Dictionary of Occupations_ in the United
States revised many strictly masculine titles to reflect the new reality, for
instance, "mailman" has become "mail carrier," and many other similar changes.

Yiddish never had such a problem, having used identifying names for women's
occupations or social status.  This factor added richness and color to our
language.

Herewith a second random list of Yiddish names of professional women,
reflecting the new fields into which women entered in the last several
decades, as well as some quite very old professions.  The first list was
published recently (Mendele, 5.225):

1.  Advokatin
2.  Bas-samkhe (expert, authority).  Coinage after the masculine term
    bar-samkhe
3.  Bederin (woman bathhouse attendant)
4.  Bederke (bath-keeper's wife)
5.  Direktorshe
6.  Forzitserin (chairlady)
7.  Ployneste (gentle, lighthearted reference to one's own wife or to the wife
    of a very good friend)
8.  Provizorin, apteykerke (pharmacist)
9.  Prezidentin (of an organization  more formal and probably more respectful
    than "prezidentke")
10. Dem prezidents vayb (It is my sense that the First Lady of the U.S. should
    not be referred to as "prezidentke" or "prezidentin" "Dem Prezidents vayb"
    sounds descriptively correct.   Anyone has another suggestion for "First
    Lady" in Yiddish?
11. Ministorin, ministorshe (member of the President's, or a Prime Minister's,
    cabinet)
12. Negl-shnayderke (manicurist/pedicurist)
13. Profesorin, profesorshe
14. Sarverin (waitress)
15. Tukerin (woman assisting the ablutions in the women's ritual bath [mikve]
16. Zogerin (woman prompting the prayers for the women worshippers in the
    _vaybershe shul_ [the women's section in the synagogue)

NOTES:
(a)  This list, nor the one published earlier, is in no way meant to be
exhaustive, nor could it be in this space

(b)  Names with the suffix /-in/ do not have the letter yud in Harkavy's
_Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary (1988 YIVO reprint of the 1928 expanded
second edition).  Since the suffix -in forms a syllable, the /yud/ should be
retained.

(c)  Uriel Weinreich's _Modern Yiddish-English/English-Yiddish Dictionary_
does have the letter yud in all the names of women's professions ending with
the -in suffix.

Subject: Soviet Yiddish songs

I cannot refuse a challenge from my Brooklyn landsman Shleyme Axelrod (5.235)
to come up with more verses to the Soviet song cited by Iosif Vaisman (5.219)
and Michael Shimshoni (5.233). there's a version of the song in the
Beregovski-Fefer _Yidishe folks-lider_ published in Kiev in 1938, where it's
called "Far dem libn khaver Stalin":

		S'hot gelebt mit undz a khaver,
		ay-ay, ay-ay-ay,
		s'iz geven a yat a braver,
		ay-ay, ay-ay-ay!
       		S'iz geven a yat a braver,
		ay-ay, ay-ay-ay!

		Fun der shot aropgekumen,
		hot er undz tsunoyfgenumen.

		Hodi kukn af di shtern,
		a kolvirt zol ba undz vern.

		Lomir trinken a lekhayim,
		far dem lebn far dem nayem.

		Far di felder far di zate,
		far der nayer hoykhe khate.

		Lomir trinken a lekhayim,
		far di kinder far di traye.

		Far di kinder, far di zkeynim,
		un far alemen ineynem.

		Zol der ershter kos zikh khvalyen,
		far dem libn khaver Stalin.

Subject: Life and death of Yiddish

I think Ellen Prince's posting [5.233] is on to something.  Certainly, Hitler
caused the destruction of Yiddish-speaking Europe.  But what about
Yiddish-speaking America?  The Second Ave. Yiddish stage did not survive the
dispersal of Jews to the suburbs and their conscious choice to raise their
children as "Americans".  I, for one, am the child of an American-born mother,
whose mother spoke to her in English, to forster her ability to get on in
America, and who can understand a bissele Yiddish, but not very much, and
really doesn't speak it at all.  When I told my mother of my interest in
Yiddish and Yiddishkeit, she the "modern girl" said, "But that's the language
of the old superstitious people".

Until recently, Yiddish was avoided in official Israel for the same reasons.
We and our families voted with our feet.  Very typical of first and second
generation immigrants, I think.  Only now, when we feel somewhat more secure,
and there is a renewed emphasis and fashion for "ethnic identity" and "roots"
have younger generations from non-Yiddish speaking homes found the old
language.  I do not suggest that this process is a good thing, but rather a
somewhat natural one.  How many of us know fourth generation
Italian-Americans fluent in Italian?   After all, our forebears came here to
get away from the Old Country and fell in love with the idea of equality and
liberty for all.   The pressures to assimilate were fierce - read Yezierska.

Of course, if there were still a flourishing European Jewry, some of us could
return (as the Italian-Americans, etc. do) with nostalgia for Tevye and all
the quaint Yiddish speakers...But that would not change the reality for the
vast number of Jews in the US and Canada.
