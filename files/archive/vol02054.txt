Subject: "shlock"

I've just heard the suggestion that this word derives
from Shylock and is therefore somewhat antisemitic.
This struck me as being very far-fetched etymologically 
and otherwise. Expert opinion would be appreciated.

Columbia/Yivo summer program and love to read, mendele,
sutskever, I.L. Peretz far hanoeh. I returned a month
ago from a year in Berlin and find that German has
wrecked my Yiddish. I would like to try to do a little
something to revive my active command of Yiddish, as
well as catch some live Yiddishkeit over the computer
network.

Subject: The Internationale (vider amol)

Mark Livingston from the Hillel list told me to ask you
if you might know where I can find the Yiddish words to
the song "The Internationale"
