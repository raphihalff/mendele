(in Brooklynese: enough already!)2) Maritime: "ship oars!, way enough!"And=203) as a verb, colloquially: "leave off work, knock off work" -(i.e. to play hooky)Best New Year's wishes to you, linguists all!Dina Levias2)----------------------------------------------------Date: December 27Subject: Mendele's "Dos Kelbl"In reply to Dov Dukhovny, Mendele frequently revised his works in new editions, refining the Yiddish and often providing parenthetic explanations of Talmudic and other citations from sforim. Yiddish literary critics count these revisions as among Mendele's major contributions to the modernization of Yiddish literature.Based on its selection of a 1930s Warsaw edition of "Shloyme reb Khayims" for digitization, I'm assuming that the Yiddish Book Center selected its copies of Mendele's works that were in best condition. The cited edition, for example, transliterates Hebrew/Aramaic words, apparently for the benefit of a secularized readership. The library at UCLA has a much earlier edition, the pages of which are yellowed and the binding insecure.Hershl Hartman3)----------------------------------------------------Date: January 23Subject: roundtable at YIVO on Jewish-Lithuanian relationsWe are pleased to invite you to YIVO on Thursday, February 13, 2014 for "Unresolved History: Jews and Lithuanians After the Holocaust," a roundtable with European Union Parliament Member, Leonidas Donskis, writer and political dissident, Tomas Venclova, and Chair of the Lithuanian Jewish community, Faina Kukliansky, to discuss the controversy surrounding the mainstream perception of the Holocaust in Lithuania today.For more details, please visit http://yivo.org/about/index.php?tid=154&aid=1263We hope to see you at this important event.Leah Falk4)----------------------------------------------------Date: January 8Subject: tekseMendelyaners, I've just read a Sholem Asch story "Di Yatishe Tokhter" with my leynkrayz and there is a word in the last (and crucial) sentence that has stumped me, couldn't find it in any dictionary: "tekse" (tes ayin kof ayin samekh ayin). The context is a young coachman who has doggedly worked, done well financially, and married into a very balebatish family in his shtetl. His upward mobility has distanced him from his khevre, and at the story's end he is going back into his house, after unsuccessfully trying to socialize with them, and his former best buddy tells the others that "di tekse geyt." A sheyem dank in foroys far ayere hilf,Michael (Meyshe) Sweet5)----------------------------------------------------Date: January 26Subject: Yiddish Romanization toolHi!I have to transcribe yidishe oysies into Latin letters. Not only one single word but a lot of text. I know Yiddish and how it should be transcribed but it's a lot of text and I'd like to make life easier. Do you know of any tool available to do this?Very grateful for an answer.Sincerely,Paula Grossman______________________________________________________End of Mendele Vol. 23.015Please do not use the "reply" key when writing to Mendele.
