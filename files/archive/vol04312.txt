Subject: Shalatn-shames and other insults

Sam Juni (my uncle) asked about the etymology of 'shalatn-shames'; Mikhl
Herzog suggested it is a shames who takes the initiative, who doesn't
wait to be told.  If he is right, then a shaltn-shames is better than
stam a shames, and gor a fayner mentsh.

However, my grandmother, who is my source for the term (and my uncle's,)
used it in a clearly derogatory way; it was in a context which made it
sound like a shalatn-shames is even less important and more to be
ridiculed than a regular shames.  (She had just referred to someone
derisively as a shames, then said something to the effect that he's not
even a real shames, he's just a shalatn-shames.)  She compared
'shalatn-shames' to 'shik-yingl' (a child sent on errands,) which she had
previously used to refer to the same adult of whom she is not exactly
fond.

On to bigger and better things:

My grandmother's reaction to this person has provided me with a beautiful
sampling of (Carpathian) Yiddish insults, some of which are puzzling me.
I wonder if any Mendelyaner know anything about:

a)  'shoyte ben pikholts' [pronounced pickholts] (I know what a shoyte
is.  I assume pikholts is a type of holts [wood], but have no idea which
type, and I'm not exactly sure what the compound insult means either.)

b)  'Udem a mentsh, katshke draydokh': Adam a person, duck turn yourself
(I think that in some dialects 'draydokh' should be drayzikh'.)

My grandmother used it in reference to someone's acting very self-
important, but isn't sure what it means.  She said it as a sentence by
itself, almost as an aphorism.

Is anyone else familiar with these insults?  Does anyone know what they
mean and where they're from?

A shaynem dank.

Subject: Shoyte ben Pikholts

There is a Yiddish expression which I localize to Mukacevo (Munkatch) in
the Carpathian mountains, which impugns the sophistication of an individ-
ual by referring to him as "Shoyte ben Pikholts."  Shoyte is the Hebrew for
idiot. Pikholts beats me.  It might refer to a toothpick, perhaps?  Anyone
know more about this?  Mother will bless you.

Subject: Yiddish in Newsweek article

     There's an interesting article in the new issue of Newsweek about
the resurgence of Judaism in east and central Europe. The article, while
inspiring a good deal of cautious optimism, offers the following claim:
"The Yiddish language is becoming as inaccessible as Welsh or Aramaic."
Leaving aside the inaccuracy of this regarding Welsh, it seems to me that
we have much to do to correct this assumption. If the amount of students
in college Yiddish classes here at Ohio State are indicative of others
around the globe, then Yiddish would seem to be quite healthy and getting
even better. Perhaps the Mendelniks should rise en masse and answer
Newsweek's claim.

Subject: Name pairings (Itzik/Yitskhak)

No discussion of name pairing should be without mention of Sholem
Aleikhem's wonderful short story, Fun'm Priziv (From the Draft Board),
found in his collection of Ayzenban Geshikhtes.  It is also available in
an excellent and faithful English translation as "The Automatic
Exemption" in Hillel Halkin's "Tevye the Dairyman/Railroad Stories" by
Schocken Books, 1987.

The story revolves around a man's two similarly-named sons and his
dealings with the Russian draft board.  His first son, Ayzik, died as a
very small child; his other son was named Itzik (presumably, but not
explicitly, named after the first child who died).  To call it a case of
mistaken identity is to miss the flavor of the narrative entirely.  A
great vignette even in translation, but delightful in the original.  Here
are some excerpts.

The father explains the source of the confusion:

Heysn heyst er Itzik, dos heyst Avrom-Yitskhak, nor rufn ruft men im
Alter.... Mir hobn gehat, a khuts im, nokh a yungl hobn mir gehat ... er
hot geheysn Ayzik hot er geheysn.  (He was called Itzik, that is
Avrom-Yitzkhak, but he actually was called Alter.... We had had, in
addition to him, another child ... his name was Ayzik.)

The father tries to explain the confusion to the last in a series
of lawyers:

"Ikh hob nor moyre," zog ikh, "ayoy vi me zukht itster Ayzikn, un Ayzik
is nito, un azoy vi Alter, Itsik heyst es, shteyt farshribn
Avrom-Yitskhak, un Yitskhak - - azoy zogt der Rabiner unzerer der lekish
-- iz Isak, un Isak iz Ayzak, un Ayzak iz Ayzik, kon men kholile zogn oyf
mayn Itzikn, oder Avrom-Yitskhakn, Altern heyst dos, az er iz dos der
Ayzik."  ("I'm just worried," I say, "since they're now looking for
Ayzik, and Ayzik is gone, and since Alter (that is, Itzik) is written
down as Avrom-Yitskhak, and Yitskhak -- according to our dolt of a
Government Rabbi -- is Isaak, and Isaak is Ayzak, and Ayzak is Ayzik, one
might (God forbid) say about my Itzik, or Avrom-Yitskhak (that is,
Alter), that he is the very Ayzik they seek."

Subject: Sholem-Aleykhem's "Zhargon" passion

Toward the end of 1887 the 28-year-old Sholem-Aleykhem wrote to Ravnitski
about his active participation in Dos Yidishe Folksblat.  From the
context I must infer that the letter was basically in Yiddish, but
Sholem-Aleykhem inserts a sentence in Russian and French, "Zhargon, this
is my passion..., my idee fixe!  He then continues to say, "Dertsu is do
a _Hoyzfraynd_, mit a _Familienfraynd_ [Yiddish publication outlets], mit
a liber fraynd, mit a rukh veyst vos far a fraynd, velkhn ikh hob
tsugezogt mithelfn, den vort darf men haltn.  He goes on:

[Now I'll try a suggestion from Zellig Bach.  Good idea.  Thanks Zellig.
He thought it would be useful to place Yiddish and its English
translation side by side on the screen.  If it survives transmission
through cyberspace, it will be only with a non-proportional font, and if
the margins are not changed, or are wide enough on recipient screens.]

                                 readers?

Sholem-Aleykhem's style changed in later years when he rigorously
tried to exclude words that were strictly German or Russian from
his Yiddish.
