Subject: The survival of Yiddish

Thanks to Mechl Asheri, for an interesting posting [6.104].  His
observations about Yiddish usage in various communities were very
informative. Observations such as these which appear periodically on
Mendele will some day serve as historiographic sources, given the dearth
of description available on most of Jewish life as it is actually lived,
not to mention the life of minority groups within klal-yisroel (and,
further, not to mention Yiddish- speaking Jews, who all too frequently
are assumed to be dead or near death).

A criticism:  I think we may abandon the notion Asheri expresses in this
sentence: "It must be remembered that before the Holocaust Jewish
communities were, if not hermetically sealed off from the world of the
non-Jews, so close to it as made little difference." The fact that some
of the khsidim he mentioned speak to each other in Hungarian (while
living in 1996 in New York or Israel! -- not Satmer, Ihel, Siget, or
Klouznborg) indicates just how invalid the "hermetically sealed"
metaphor is.

Subject: The survival of Yiddish

I was particularly interested in Mechel Asheri's comments, which in many
particulars were similar to the concern I "voiced" in my first
contribution to Mendele (vol. 6.080, 15th October). I hope there will be
more letters on this subject, as the goal of Mendelniks, in addition to
exchanging so many viewpoints, questions, etc. is, I feel, to keep our
beloved mameloshn alive and well, today and for years to come. I look
forward to more mail on this subject.  A sheynem dank.

Subject: A tikn toes

In volume 6.105 I accidentally wrote "acusative" instead of
"nominative." I meant to say that the _nominative_ case is used for the
subject of a verb not for the object (in the quoted line the case should
have been the dative).  Sorry about the typo.

Subject: Helfn vi a toytn bankes

Yet another reading of 'svet helfn vie a toyten bankes: As I recall the
expression, it took the form of "...vie a toyten's bankes." The possessive
form would suggest that the bankes have been applied/belong to the dead
person. Hence, the more conventional reading that the analogy is being
drawn between the pointless situation in question and the effectiveness
(ineffectiveness?) of attempting to cup a dead person.

Subject: Yiddish for kids

1. "Telling on someone" - my husband, who was born in Cuba and whose
family moved to Boro Park in Brooklyn when he was 11, remembers that in
Cuba, where they spoke Yiddish at home, an un-Englishized Yiddish - the
expression used was "ich vel oyf dir masern" (from moyser, presumably).
I seem to recall, growing up in Winnipeg, saying "ich vel oyf dir zogn"
- prost un poshet

2. Please oyf yiddish - isn't it interesting that we have no official
word for this - what does this say about us (please regard this question
as rhetorical). There are, of course, in addition to Mr. Neugroschel's
suggestions, "ken ikh", "meg ikh", and so on.  But I have to agree with
David Herskovic's suggestion of "please", English being as widely
understood as it is; "please" may work where other really Yiddish
expressions fail.

Subject: Yiddish children's games sources

Roman Vishniac's daughter should look into Yekhiel Shtern's book,
Kheyder un besmedresh, published by YIVO around 1950, in the Yivo-bleter
and then as a separate book. There is an abbreviated translation in one
of the early volumes of the YIVO Annual.
