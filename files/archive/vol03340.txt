Subject: dona dona

Was it on this discussion group that we were debating the origins of the
phrase "Dona, Dona"?  I believe some readers posited a Yiddish or other
Eastern European source.  Accordingly, I was rather surprised to find the
following lines in a poem appended to the memoirs of Frederick Douglass:

	Come, saints and sinners, hear me tell
	How pious priests whip Jack and Nell,
	And women buy and children sell,
	And preach all sinners down to hell,
	  And sing of heavenly union.

	They'll bleat and baa, dona like goats,
	Gorge down black sheep, and strain at motes,
	Array their backs in fine black coats,
	Then seize their negroes by their throats,
	  And choke, for heavenly union. . . .

It is interesting that the editor of The Norton Anthology World
Masterpieces adds the following footnote after the word "Dona": "Believed
to be a printer's error in the original edition for "go on" or "go
n-a-a-ah."

Any comments?

Subject: Fritshunes, Zhid

I suspect that the word in question (Fritshunes) is actually
"pritshines," from the Russian word "prichi'na" 'reason,'

As to the word "zhid," it is found in all the Slavic languages and
probably entered Slavic from Romance, perhaps via Slovenian. Strangely
enough, it is the standard word for "Jew" in non-Eastern Orthodox
countries and has become derogatory only in the Orthodox countries where
it is replaced by the word originally meaning "Hebrew." (So zhid is the
standard word for Jew among Croatians, but among Serbs the term Jevrej is
used.) This phenomenon has even affected non-Slavic languages: the
Georgian word for Jew 'Uria' has become derogatory and has been replaced
by 'Ebraeli' = 'Hebrew.' I suspect that the change in the meaning of
'zhid' is relatively recent and probably spread from Russian to the other
Orthodox Slavs.

Subject: fritshunes

It is an yiddishized form of Russian word _prichiny_ meaning 'reasons'
(common usage among Yiddish speakers in Soviet Union).

The fragment from this letter is quite tragic (how many families were not
only prevented from reunion - the mere correspondence was virtually
banned, and those who did write often paid a high price of being labeled
as "communicating with foreigners" with many unpleasant consequences.
However, I couldn't refrain from posting a joke, that used to be very
popular in sixties and seventies:

Rabinovich is summoned to KGB. Officer asks:

-Comrade Rabinovich, you have a brother in the US, don't you?

-(quietly) Ye-es...

-Than why you did not write to him for twenty years?

-???

-No, no, comrade Rabinovich, times have changed! Nothing to be afraid or
ashamed of. Now you can write freely to your brother about how you enjoy
this wonderful life in our socialist motherland. Here is the paper, why
don't you start right away.

Rabinovich takes a pen:

"Main taier brider!

Plitsem ikh hob gefinen di tsait un der plats tsu shraybn dir a briv..."

The word that Shleyme Axelrod is looking for is from
the Russian "prichina" = reason.

Shleyme Axelrod's "fritshunes," given the graphic ambiguities that
he reported, is presumably "pritshines" (from Russian _prichiny_)
'reasons'.

Subject: Kortn

Reb Noyekh lists the term _shrage_ as meaning 'full house', but it was
apparently used to refer to a hand containing a mixture of suits, i.e.,
_SHeln_ 'diamonds', _Royt_ 'hearts', _Grin_ 'spades', _Aykhl_ 'clubs',
whence the punning proverb:  "Mit 'Shrage' ruft men oyf, ober a kon ken
men nit oysnemen" ("With 'Shrage' [the Hebrew name corresponding to
Yiddish _Fayvl_] one is called to the Torah, but one cannot win a
kitty.")

He also cites the proverb "Eyn khokhme ve-eyn tevune keneged shlekhte
kortn," which has a variant:  "...keneged frau fortune."  Both parody
Proverbs 21, 30, which also gave rise to one of many proverbial put-
downs of cantors:  "Fun vanen iz gedrungen, az a khazn iz a nar?  Fun
posek:  Eyn khokhme ve-eyn tevune ve-eyn eytse leneged adoshem."

Subject: I)zhid and Zidlen ii) Yeke iii) Western Yiddish

Paul Ritterband: Only a Litvak would associate zhid and Zidlen (not
zhidlen). Yiddish zidlen 'to curse' is of German origin; cf MHG sudelen
'beschmutzen' (although you'd think there'd be a German variant with
u-umlaut).

For Yiddish "yeke", cf. German "Geck", Berlin dialect "Yeck" (I would
think, no?) 'dandy, fop, dude' etc. Far better than all the other
pseudo-etymologies offered by philologos, et al.

Living speakers of Western Yiddish from Alsace, Holland, Western Hungary,
recorded in the early 60's can be heard on the tapes of the Yiddish Atlas
in New York; Astrid Starck in Alsace surely has more recent one. Also,
the Swiss Phonogrammarchiv recording prepared by Guggernheim_Gruenberg.

There is still a preterite of a single verb (vor 'was') in West
Transcarpathian Yiddish.

Subject: Kieke

In response to Yude Rozof's message about the phrase that includes
"kieke" which was used in Berlin.

The Berlin Gentile dialect has heavy low German influences, which,
incidentally make it more similar to Dutch than to Hochdeutsch. In the
Hanseatic territories (where my own ancestors are from) Plattdeutsch was
used to the exclusion of the standard, but finally yielded to the
standard, except for the working class and the peasants, who still use it
today. Anyway, to come to the point. Tallin, Estonia was the farthest
outpost in German-speaking territories, and there is a large building
that carries the logo "Kiek in de keuk" (I can't remember the spelling of
the words after kiek). Kiek is and always has been a Low German
equivalent to "Kucken". The "i" sound was so strong that it yielded in
Dutch to "kijk", which is procounced kaeik, much as min and din yielded
mein and dein. The quoted phrase means "Gib a kuk in kikh" by the way.

Just thought I'd put in my two bits. One P.S.: I read that there was
never a "Juedisch-Plattdeutsch". That same article (wish my memory were
better) said that in Amsterdam ("Low German" country) you heard Low
German on one side of a certain bridge and on the other side High German.
Then the author explains that what was meant was that Jews spoke Yiddish,
which has few if any connections with Low German, and was perceived as
"Highland" speech as opposed to "Nether-Land" speech; the Jews lived on
one side of the bridge and the Gentiles the other.

Subject: Re: Galicia/Gaelic

As you may know, there is a province of Spain called Galicia, which is
not populated by Galizianers necessarily.  Also, ancient France was
Gallia, and the language of Ireland and Scotland is Gaelic.  Well, this
all points to the Celtic relationship between all those areas.  What I'd
like to know is, was there ever a time when the Celts and the Jews lived
in Galicia (Poland) at the same time?  Is there any reference in the
Yiddish literature of Galicia to the ancient Celtic settlers who gave the
area its name?  Has anyone written about this?

Thanks
