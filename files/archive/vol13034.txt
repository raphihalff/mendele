Subject: Mayontek

Yankev Berger echoes many of my sentiments regarding Mr. Asheri's letter
regarding "Understanding Yiddish," and I will not even get into how much  I
disagree with the definition of Yiddishkeit in that letter, but  Mayontek
is, if not purely Slavic, definitely a good Polish word. It is written
Majatek with a diacritic mark under the second "a" that means it is
pronounced something like "Mayowntek" in English transliteration. It has
the same basic meaning as the Yiddish word: property, estate, etc.

Subject: Re: Labor Pledge in Yiddish`

Alan Singer asks about a widely-mentioned quote from the 1909 garment
workers strike where at the instigation of Clara Lemlich, over a thousand
people "repeated the Yiddish words: `If I turn traitor to the cause I now
pledge, may this hand wither from the arm I now raise.'" A google search
for this quotation turns up dozens of responses.  However, none give of
these, as interesting as they are, include the Yiddish words of this
pledge, which is of course a secularized paraphrasing of the traditional
expression -- "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand wither, let
my tongue cleave to my palate if I do not remember you, if I do not set
Jerusalem above my highest joy." (Psalm 137, 5-7).

A good source for tracking down the Yiddish words might be the book by
Bernard Weinstein, Idishe yunyons in amerike (New York: United Hebrew
Trades, 1929). Copies are probably available in many large libraries. The
Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University has it [along with
the papers of the Jewish Labor Committee] - see
http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/tam/yiddish/Yiddishbks/yidlaborus.html
; another source might be Elias Tcherikower, ed., Di geshikte fun der
yidishe arbeter-bavegung in di fareynikte shtatn (New York: YIVO Institute
for Jewish Studies, 1943-45).

Subject: Re: Understanding Yiddish

It appears to me that the important takeaway lesson from khaver Friedman's
post (Mendele 13.033) is the highly variegated forms of Yiddish that have
existed, and continue to exist, throughout Europe.

I remember feeling that the Folksbiene production of Singer's 'Yentl the
Yeshiva Boy' was spoken throughout with the characteristic Galitzianer
accent of the southeastern corner of Poland, where the story was set. While
no lover of this accent, I nevertheless appreciated its use, as a tool by
which greater authenticity was brought to the presentation.

Rodgers & Hammerstein's "Oklahoma!" is a wonderful piece of theater, as is
Shakespeare's "Macbeth.' Yet it would seem silly to interchange the way the
English is spoken in both of them.....

Nu, lomir vayter iberkhazern di frage fun vokabular un farshtendinish.  I am
not an academic.  Ikh bin a tog teglikher reklame makher far vemen yidish
is zayn mame loshn.  I am a simple advertising writer for whom Yiddish is
still the language of his heart not the language of the job.  As an
advertising writer I am faced with some simple facts that relate to the
richness of Yiddish and the foreigness (to me) of some terms.  Yiddish is a
fusion language.  As such it absorbs terms that establish truth, accuracy
and understanding that is "correct" for the surround in which the speaker
finds him or herself. When I am writing for the Canadian market I am very
well aware that there are some phrases, or words which I can not use when
writing for the Australian, English or American market.  But, all the words,
in their variety are still English.

Problem for Yiddish is that, in theory at least, the amount of space where
Jews live and where Yiddish is still of interest is or seems to be
shrinking. Be that as it may, my cousins in Melbourne, which has an active
Yiddish speaking community, probably lard their language, (is that an apt
expression for a Jew to use) with terms that grow out of Aussie english.

The discussions that we are having today are a reflection of an archival
effort to distill the language so that on a universal plane a "standard"
yiddish will arise. A futile exercise.  Let's celebrate the richness and
diversity. Let's celebrate that VZMAY, Vi zogt men af Yiddish, the group
looking to establish new vocabulary for new experiences in life.  Above all
let's celebrate "Yiddishkayt."  The fact that those who are of the "chapeau
noir" persuasion may use terms that are different to those I, who am an
aynvoyner in a linke veltlikhe svive, a child of the left secular stream of
Yiddish experience, usage is a wonderful fact. It makes our language richer,
mer frukhtbar.

I just this morning read a poem by Avrom Sutzkever..."Der Royter
Hon" in which he has the line "un plutzm iz der royter hon gevorn a
pazharnik."  And I was stumped.  I couldn't recall hearing the term.  My
Litvak mame un bobe never used it.  My shule teachers, insofar as I
remember, never used it. Since it sounded faintly Slavic I went to me
Polish/English dictionary and found out it meant a "fireman or a fire
brigade."  Should Sutzkever, the ultimate Litvak have used the same term
that my mother, also a Vilner, used "fayer lesher or fayer brigade?"

Let's celebrate the richness and diversity of Yiddish and know that the
arguments we have contribute to adding links to the goldene keyt fun undser
kultur.Lomir derklern, iberkhazern, vayter derklern un vayter iberkhazern.
Far di frume iz ez taytsh gemore.  Far di fun undz vos arbetn l'toyves

Subject: Re: Understanding Yiddish

If one's goal in learning Yiddish is to read Yiddish literature, then
familiarity with a Slavic language or two is very, very helpful.  (Of course
it goes without saying that knowledge of German, Hebrew and Aramaic also is
useful.)  Case in point:

Over the weekend I was reading one of Yankev Glatshteyn's "Yash" books and
came across the verb "miltshen."  It's not in the Weinreich dictionary
(haven't checked Harkavy or Niborski yet), and while I am not a fluent
reader or speaker of either Polish or Russian, the Russian infinitive
"molchat'" (equivalent to Yiddish "shvaygn," "to be silent") stuck in my
mind.  The Polish cognate is "milczec" with an accent over the final c.  In
context, this tentative gloss certainly made sense.

At the Yiddish leyenkrayz that I used to attend in Brooklyn, there was
always a full battery of dictionaries, in Yiddish, Hebrew, German, Polish
and Russian (and possibly Ukrainian) on hand to help us out with "difficult"
words.

Knowledge of Slavic languages is less critical to reading contemporary
American Hasidic magazines such as Der blik and Der shtern.  Mastery of
English is more important, as a cursory glance at the articles and the ads
reveals.

Subject: Understanding Yiddish

Regarding the assertion made that a thorough grounding in yidishkeyt (by
which is meant both Jewishness and Judaic religious knowledge and practice)
is an essential component of not only speaking yiddish but also transmitting
that characteristic to the next generation, I have to ask: does one need to
be Christian to speak good English?

We are no longer quite aware of it, but English and many other European
languages are sodden with terms and references that derive from a Christian
sensitivity and world-view, in the same way that Arabic, Persian, Urdu and
other languages spoken in the Islamic world have a dense veining of
Islamisms.

Yes, a Judaic grounding opens windows.  So does a familiarity with the
Germanic languages (not just German - I speak Dutch, Flemish, and Afrikaans,
ober ikh red taytsh nor amaturish), and the social and cultural environs in
which yiddish was/is spoken. Knowledge of Slavic languages and cultures also
certainly opens windows. But not all windows need to be opened to have a
deep perspective.  Is Antverper yiddish any less yiddish for being worlds
and generations removed from the shtetlekh?

Nor can I believe that Bundists and revolutionists spoke and wrote their
yiddish texts grounded in frumspeak, or for the frum kehile.  No matter how
deep a steeping in yidishkeyt, there would still be less conversation
possible between a leftwing social activist and a frumer mentsh than between
frume mentshn from different linguistic backgrounds - American and Israeli
yeshive bokherim are more likely to talk with each other than either would
with an apikorsishe radikal, no matter how pure the yiddish.

There are different levels or registers of speech - how one uses a
vocabulary is dependent often on whom one converses with, one's exclamations
are often edited for appropriateness.   Precisely that is why 'native'
fluency in any language requires much exposure to that language being spoken
- in all circumstances and environments in which that language is native.

The vocabulary as it is used demonstrates how it may be used.  Whether one's
usage is kosher depends as much on what one says, as how.

Nor mayne tsvay penning.

Subject: Re: shikse and understanding yiddish

Would it be in order for my non-erudite, non-authoritative, wholly personal
opinion to appear in the ongoing discussion on the two subjects above ?

When I married my first husband, whose parents came from a Shtetl in
Poland/Ukraine, my father-in-law affectionately called me "shikse". Since I
was raised in a non-Yiddish-speaking family, I did not know the precise
meaning of the word; but I understood the loving tone he used ! He called me
that because I had been raised in an "assimilated" home by Odessa-born
Russian speaking parents who, while fully aware of their Jewishness, were
entirely non-religious. So "shikse", like many other derogatory
epithets,(and I've heard American blacks calling each other "nigger"!) can
be used by the *insiders* of a culture as bantering and loving words amongst
themselves. "C'est le ton qui fait la chanson", say the French.

As for understanding Yiddish: on first being exposed to it in New York at
the age of 13 - I was amazed, and amused, to realize that my knowledge of
Russian and German provided a key to understanding about 70% of what I was
hearing. Later, my understanding was enhanced by the smattering of Hebrew I
acquired. There is no doubt in my mind that these three languages are the
open-sesame to understanding Yiddish - though not to speaking it ! Ober, mit
di yorn, vel ikh oykh lernen redn!

Entshuldikt mayn hutspa!
