Subject: Tokhes afn tish

One will find in Partridge's dictionary of slang for the 19th Century, a
Victorian term, "aftish," which denoted being open, frank, and dealing
cleary, from tokhes afen tisch, or your cards face up, or better yet,
perhaps, what we might have thought of as baring the breast to the
attacker, or neck on the block, or laying the wager, life and death,
brought down, No more evasive indirections.  The PlainDealer, in short.

Actually, I should have said more clearly, Aftish means no more bluffing.
So, when the t is on the table, bluffings tops, and serious calling of
wagers commences.  Adapted to other forms of business behavior in mid 19th
century by "aftish."  I like "aftish," to denote an attitude, but no one
uses it today, I guess, not even in the UK.

Subject: Is Yiddish dying?

The following opinion on Yiddish from one Stan Goodman, a resident
of Qiryat Tiv'on in Israel, appeared on the Jewish Genealogy bulletin
board and I thought that it might be worth while for me to post it on
Mendele with the explicit purpose of gathering reactions to Goodman's
view (if any) and then posting them en masse back onto the Jewish
Genealogy board.

Here is Mr. Goodman's opinion on Yiddish.

     You are correct, of course, when you speak of the development of
     such languages as English and Italian from predecessor tongues (an
     even better example would have been Maltese).  The difference is
     that English and Italian are dynamically growing languages; they are
     still organic and successful; they have a public, independent of
     nostalgia. Yiddish, for reasons that are no doubt regrettable, is
     not;  it is contracting, and will die in the not too distant future
     for want of speakers.  It is already possible to say that the
     survival of Yiddish is artificial, rather than organic: I do not
     know of any population large or small, anywhere in the world, in
     which Yiddish is spoken as a first language -- except for the rather
     pathetic groups in i.e. Jerusalem and Bnei Braq (and Brooklyn, I
     understand), who demonstrate in every possible way their attachment
     to Jewish life in 16th-century Poland. Consider the other argument
     that is now raging in this newsgroup, that concerning whether
     Yiddish even has a word for 'disappoint', or whether one has to use
     the local vernacular, because 'enttaeuschen' is German and not
     Yiddish at all.  Think about it and what it means for the
     seriousness of Yiddish as a living language.  I don't need to."

Comments anyone?

Subject: Holy fool

Ramona Koval asked [5.196] about a jewish jester.

I think that the badkhen who performs at Jewish weddings is very fitting
the characterizations she mentioned.

My PhD dissertation :"Badkhonim Lider vi a Genre in der Yiddisher
Folkstimlekher Literatur".  Heading in English: "Badkhonim Songs as a
Literary Genre in Jewish Popular Literature", deals with this subject.
I'll willingly answer any further questions.

Subject: Why the "K" Rations in Israel's Army are a m'khaye...

American G.I's are known to gripe at every opportune occasion about the
"K" rations.  But not in the Israeli Army.

The reason:  The "K" rations there are the culinary Yiddish offerings
consisting of:

Ka'she, ka'she varnishkes, katshke, kishke, k'neydlekh, kreplekh, kugl,
and kikhl for dessert.

This explains the victories of Israel's Army, in addition, of course, to
its courageous fighting spirit and its sophisticated weaponry.

Long live Jewish mothers, the eternal preparers of "K" platters, the
genuine n'shome shpayz [soul food] to _derkvikn_ [delight] one's heart,
including, though not necessarily in the Israeli army, chicken soup, the
golden elixir and universally acclaimed Jewish penicillin as an antidote
to colds...

Subject: An invitation

Mendele has grown so fast in the last year or so that your shames was
unable to send out to every new subscriber the customary invitation to
write an introductory post.  Toyg nisht.  If you are one of those who
who were not asked before, please excuse this belated request and send
us something soon.

We maintain a file of these introductions (who-is-who, available from
Mendele via anonymous ftp) which is updated each month by Anno Siegel.
Anno has not had much business lately but maybe this appeal will change
matters.

The shames also takes this opportunity to wish all Mendelniks and indeed
the world at large a better year than the one now ending.
