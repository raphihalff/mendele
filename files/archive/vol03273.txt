In the absence of specific evidence of 'feygele' in Poland, what
word did/does Yosl Mlotek recall being used??  Surely the Polish
Jews did not lack for a word for a condition that existed, even if
repressed.  My relatives all came to North America as young persons
-- before or right after WW I.  [My mother spent almost two years in
Paris and some months in Montreal en route.]  I think Noyek Miller's
point about age when coming to the US is important in explaining
their vocabulary.  At the same time, as the recent point about Moshe
Kapoyek illustrates, American Yiddish did not exist in a vacuum and
fed back to European communities.

'Fag[g]ot' (and 'fag' as derivative) are credited as American by the
OED (and Partridge) to refer to male homosexuals.  They don't appear
in the original OED, but in the supplement where they have examples
that date no earlier than 1916 for the first and then become
widespread in the '20's and '30's in underworld and literary
contexts.  There even is a 1966 cite from the New Statesman
complaining about how the American 'fag' is ousting the British
'queer.'  I would like to see Mikhl Herzog's argument for the
derivation of 'feygele' from 'fag' [or 'fey']

I don't understand (and this may be my ignorance of Yiddish
linguistics) why 'feygele' as a woman's name bothered him as plural
"birds."  I recall very clearly that my mother (and other relatives)
used a 'le' as a form of pesonalizing diminutive, usually implying
"little" -- especially with names for young children (Mindel,
Mindele ...  Hershel, He[r]shele, etc.).

Subject: Prudery

I have been struck by the prudery in Ashkenazic life.  As an
example, there are not native slang words for the sex organs.  there
are of course shmuk (jewel) and putz (decoration) for the penis, and
I do not know of any vaginal references at all, besides the
indescribably filthy  lokh  .

The place where I have been trying to piece together something is in
the folk song  Tumbalalaika  .  To the three questions, we are told
that a stone can grow without rain, love can burn and never stop,
and a heart can cry without tears.  The last two are the sort of
thing one expects in a love song, but what is meant by a stone can
grow without rain?  It is possible to make up far-fetched
explanations, but they are really out of it compared with the
simplicity of the other two answers.

What I find more convincing is that the song has been bowdlerized.
If I were to answer the questions, I would find it natural that
love can grow without rain.  In that case, what can burn and never
stop?  That, of course, is desire, not love.  However, in my own
experience, I never heard a Yiddish word for desire, as opposed to
love, but I could conjecture that the word, whatever it is, was
censored from the song early on, to make if fit for the ears of
children.

There are subtleties here.  The word love, as Eros, did not mean
devotion and commitment.  That was not the emotion over which
Aphrodite had her domain.  It was indeed desire, as manifested in
her feeling for Ares, or Paris' for Helen.  Is it possible that
liebe had this meaning originally in Yiddish, and another for the
less torrid emotion?  In that case, what is the original Yiddish
word for that which can grow without rain?  And if there has always
been a Yiddish word for Eros, what is it?

Subject: Yiddish Pen Pals

Since my comment some time ago about Yiddish students "Pen Palling"
I have gotten approx. 5 inquiries...Is anyone out there who teaches
at the University level, or comparable level, interested in
organizing something with me for next year...for this year whoever
has contacted me will just "wing" it....

Subject: Purim lid

Let me repeat my request with your indulgence:  Mir zukhn di verter
fun text un nit fun tsuzung vos is zeyer bakant.

A gitn Purim, malakh
Vu ikh gay fall ikh
Di burd iz mir lang
Di vab iz mir krank
--------------------
--------------------
Hant iz Purim, morgn iz aus
Gib mir a grushn un varf mir araus.

My transcription of mer tsi veyniker "sw Yiddish" iz an
approximation to say the least, but this is the closest Miriam
Isaacs and I could get. Has anyone heard something like this ?

Subject: S. Anski

Aside from "The Dybbuk" I am having a hard time finding any works by
S. Anski in Yiddish.  The National Yiddish Book Center had a 15
volume collection of Anski's collected writings available for a
short while, but it has been sold out.

It occurred to me that the reason it is so difficult to find Anski's
works in Yiddish may be that it is not all written in Yiddish
originally.  The collected writings that the National Yiddish Book
Center had offered may have been made up largely of translations of
his work from some other language into Yiddish.

I have not been able to confirm this theory from any scholarly
sources, but I thought that some Mendelnike might know the answer.
