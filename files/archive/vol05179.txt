Subject: A Wartime Song from Israel

Indeed, the Six-Day War song "Nasser Mechakeh L'Rabin" has its origins --
the music, if not the lyrics! -- in a bawdy Yiddish tune.

By way of introduction, a version of "Nasser Mechakeh L'Rabin" (sung by
the Doodaim) appears on the Hed-Arzi compilation album "Jerusalem of
Gold:  Songs of the Six Days [sic] War."  According to the liner notes, a
"folk tune was used by Haim Heffer for his song 'Nasser Waits for Rabin,'
which helped keep spirit high during the battles."

But an earlier tune -- with the same music and even the ai-ai-ais ending
each line -- can be found in an innocuous-looking French 78, released on
the Saturne label (just after World War II, from the looks of it) and
with two sides of Yiddish "folklore arranged and interpreted" by "S.
Berland et son orchesare" (orchestre is French for orchestra; I'm not
sure what orchesare refers to specifically). Both sides feature an
unidentified male vocalist and chorus; possibly the lead singer is S.
Berland himself.

The A-side is a slow version of "Yidl Mitn Fidl" (as it's spelled on
the disc).  The B-side, and the inspiration for the Six-Day War song:
"Der Rebe Mit Di Schikse."  Three guesses as to what it's about!

The vocals are in a heavy "Poylish" accent -- so thick that a Yiddish-
speaking colleague, whose parents are from Poland, has trouble
distinguishing the words (my folks are of Litvish background, so forget
it).

Some lines I can recognize, though.  The Rebe is "mit a shikse tsvishn
boimer/un [ohn?] a shames, nur a shoimer."  He is discovered: "Macht der
shammes a grois gevalt...ai-ai-ai!"  Later, the Chassidim pronounce:
"Der Rebe's hois iz gevoren trayfer" (the rabbi's house has become
traif).  However, the Rebe has the last word.  "Enfert der Rebe mit a
shmeykhl ponim" (the rabbi, with a smile on his face, answers) that "ma
shikse hob och alle males" (I believe this means that "my shikse has all
virtues).  He concludes, apparently, that one shouldn't ask too many
"shales."

As I co-host a Jewish radio program in Vancouver, British Columbia, I
have been sorely tempted to play this on air!  However, my "yetzer hara"
has so far been dissuaded by -- among others -- my parents and my
Yiddish-speaking colleague (who also co-hosts the show).  They're not
sure of the exact lyrics, but the title is enough to convince them that
the words aren't exactly kosher.

So far, I have avoided temptation...but Purim may provide me with an
excuse to play "Der Rebe Mit Der Schikse"!  BTW, my dad tells me that
many years ago, somebody did play some blue and bawdy Yiddish songs on a
radio program in his native Saskatchewan.  Nobody complained, as even
some of the older folks, who might have found them objectionable, didn't
want to "maser" (fink) on a fellow Jew.

The disk came from the collection of my late aunt and uncle (her husband)
in Saskatoon, Sask.  Wonder how they got it?

Subject: Sol Liptzin

Although I did not have the privilege to know Professor Liptzin
personally, I know his published work well. Of especial importance to us
in South Africa is the fact that, in consequence of several vsisits here,
he became intimately familar with the small but important body of South
African literature in Yiddish. He was a close personal friend of all our
most importnat writers in poetry, prose and cultural history. Liptzin
devoted an imprtant chapter to South African Yiddish writing in his book
*The Maturing of Yiddish Literature*, which accorded to South Afrrican
Yiddish its rightful place in the history and development of Yiddish
creativity. Liptzin's precis of the range and quality of South Africa
Yiddish literature is of necessity both descriptive and somewhat cursory,
but to date it remains the single most important published international
recognition of the considerable achievement of Yiddish artists in our
country. Liptzin's chapter and its critical comments opens areas for
fuller investigation, and calls attention to those significant features
of South African Yiddish writing that distinguish it and make it a unique
contribution. All of us working in the field of Yiddish studies here
mourn his loss and honour his memory.

Subject: Morris Rosenfeld's "Yiddish"

In addition to the text source given by various respondents (Vol. 5.165),
an excellent English translation by Max Rosenfeld (no relation) appeared
in "Morris Rosenfeld: Selections From His Poetry and Prose," Yiddisher
Kultur Farband, NY, 1964.

The first verses are rendered:

"You ask if Yiddish is a tongue
grammatical and polished?
One thing only I affirm--
The Jewish tongue is Yiddish.

I do not study words to seek
some origin or other.
I only know I love my speech,
the language of my mother."

Hershl Hartman

Subject: A vertl

Allow me to share a vertl I recently heard.

es iz nisht do aza klakhe zakh vi a krime layter in es iz nisht do aza
krime zakh vi a glakh vort.

There is nothing as straight as a crooked (slanting) ladder and there is
nothing as crooked as a straight word.

Subject: Transcription

Sorry for intruding into your mailing list, and for doing it in English.
I do understand much of Yiddish, but I do neither speak nor write it. I
happen to be working on a translation of a biography of Isaac Bashevis
Singer from Hebrew into Dutch. I am talking about the biography written
by his son Israel Zamir.

There are some things which I have to render in the Latin alphabet, which
refer to certain persons or places probably known to part of my future
readers, which would make me look stupid if I just transcribed them. I
hope some of you will be able to come up with answers to some of my
questions without going through to much trouble.

For example, Is someone familiar with a Jewish restaurant somewhere in
Manhattan called Steinberg? Or perhaps Sztajnberg? It's the spelling of
the name I need to know...

Or his brother, also a Yiddish-language writer... In the Hebrew text his
name is Yehoshua Yisrael Singer, but I need the name he used in the
States. Does anybody know whether he wrote his name as Joshua, or in a
transcription of the Yiddish pronunciation unknown to me, or elsewise?
And what about his family name?

The book is full of such things, _real_ things from Jewish New York,
Poland an Israel. I am more familiar with the latter two, perhaps you
could help me with the first.

I do not know whether an English translation of the book exists. If it
does, the name would be something like "Journey to my Father". If anyone
has it or could give me the bibliographical details, most of my problems
might be solved at once.

Thanks a lot in advance.

Daniel Bugel
