Subject: YIVO transcription

When Fraydl [6.291] first posted her question about a system for
transcribing Yiddish in roman characters, I was sure that someone
would respond that we had gone through this in Mendele a long time ago
and that a couple of us had prepared a table of the YIVO system, which
is now, I believe, available at our web site.

Now Ruth Goodman says [6.292] she has been having trouble with that
YIVO system, saying that it is "time to cvonstruct a new code that
will conform more closely with English phonetics."

The point of such a system, whether it be for transcription or
transliteration, is not to make one that pleases the literate speakers
of any particular language, say English. Rather, the system should be
universally clear and useful. Thus, YIVO spellings are not meant to
represent the sounds of English or Polish or German, just to take more
or less at random three languages other than English that also use the
roman alphabet.

Admittedly, given the orthographic biases we bring from our various
native languages, one has to go to a little trouble to learn to write,
e.g., veynik for 'few' and vaynik for 'winy, juicy,' but it is not all
that hard to do.

Thanks to Jean Maslo for telling us about the Corvol children's camp
in France. It sounds just like the four Yiddish children's camps that
once existed (two still do) in the States--Kinderland of the former
Jewish People's Fraternal Order, Kinder-Ring of the Workmen's
Circle/Arbeter Ring, Kindervelt of the Labor Zionist Alliance and
Boyberik of the Sholem Aleykhem Institute--including the fact that
some of the campers of earlier generations married each other. This
was the case with me and my late wife, May Stein Hartman.

Further: the children and grandchildren of such couples--just as in
Corvol--attend the surviving camps, Kinderland and Kinder-Ring, while
their parents and grandparents help to support and lead them. Just a
few weeks ago I was privileged, as a certified Secular Jewish
vegvayzer/madrikh/Leader, to perform a wedding in San Diego, Calif.;
the groom had virtually grown up in Camp Kinderland, just as did his
mother, a childhood friend of mine. It was a distinct pleasure for me
to use Yiddish in the ceremony, as I almost always do, this time
knowing that I was understood by the groom, by his mother and siblings
and by a number of the guest couples, also Kinderland alumni, as well
as Kinderland-friends of the young couple.
