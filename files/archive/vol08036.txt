Subject: Mlotek is 80 

Yosl Mlotek, octogenarian

Mazl un gezunt to Yosl Mlotek on his 80th birthday! Yosl's countless
accomplishments for Yiddish education, language, culture, and music are
indeed a precious legacy for the Jewish people. 

The Yiddish Forward of July 17th celebrates him as co-editor of theYiddish
Forward;  editor of _Cultur un Lebn_; creator, with his wife, Chane, of many
worthwhile books about the Yiddish folksong; winner of the Manger prize for
Literature. 

My personal bouquet to Yosl is for his ability to span generations. As
National Director of the Arbeter Ring Education Department, his wisdom and
precious guidance helped us create and build the largest and most active
Yiddish schools to flourish in New York, to imbue thousands of our yugnt with
our secular culture. His manner was gentle; his deep idealism was contagious,
and to work with him was to love him.

May he continue to have music wherever he goes.

Subject: Nakhum/Nokhum/Nukhem?

The Hebrew name Nakhum has a patakh under the 'nun'.  The patakh transforms
into a kometz and is pronounced in Litvisch Yiddish as Nokhem and in Poylish
Yiddish as Nukhem.  Can anyone explain the vowel transformation?

Subject: Moshe Rabbenu

When I was nine or ten, my father taught me to read Yiddish. We used a primer
called Dos Idishe Kind There were pencil illustrations of children in clothes
of the 1920's .In the back of the primer were poems.. I can recall the
opening verses of one of the poems. If anyone out there in Mendele land knows
the rest of the poem I would appreciate hearing from him/her

Moshe Rabbenu auf yener velt
Varft mir arop a zekele gelt
Vawss vest du tuen mit a zekele gelt

And that is all I remember except the boy speaking to Moshe Rabbenu asks for
money for all kinds of things When he finally says the money will go to build
a beis midrash , I believe, the request is granted.

Subject: koshere fodem

I can't explain the derivation of this expression, but it has been a new and
very useful one to me as I've sat through too many faculty and board meetings
in recent years.  I heard it for the first time just a few years ago from my
mother, now almost 94 years of age, who lived in Busnevetsia, Ukraine the
first 17 years of her life.  I asked her, one day, after she retrieved her
mail, what was in the pile. 

Her response:  " Die zelbe drek in a koshere fodem"  How very useful, and
better said in Yiddish ! 

Deena Mersky

P.S. Following my earlier response on this phrase, I had further opportunity
to consult with my mother, the sage of Busnevetsia.  She did not remember the
anecdote I had relayed to Mendele, but she did explain that in her memory the
phrase referred to a wrap, to cover something less than acceptable, usually
some sort of hypocrisy or cunning at worst, or perhaps inadequacy, to be
somewhat knder.  "Er is a gonnif (nar, momzer)  mit a koshere fodem"  -D.M.

Subject: pulkes

Friends and relatives frequently admire my baby daughter's "pulkes" -- her
round little thighs.  I know that this word can be used for chicken thighs as
well as baby ones.  My question:  does anyone know its derivation?  It sounds
Slavic, but doesn't seem to be Russian or Polish.

Subject: nivl pe

In an effort to avoid rude words -mise verter- certain frime yidish speakers
use their ingenuity to say what has to be said but without actually saying
it, thus avoiding nivl pe. 

Here is my short list; I'm sure others will have their own.

p*ts			akhtsik nayntsiger
k*ker			knaker on a nun
t*khes			vi di yidn hobn gerut
			as in kish mikh vi di yidn hobn gerut
(for this last one I'm indebted to my neighbour at layning who whispered
it into my ear while they layned 'vayakhni betukhas')

But impossible to beat is the one that appeared in the orthodox journal
'males'. Despite 'males' receiving a favourable review in the forverts it
could not bring itself to mention the forverts by name even when discussing
the very review, kal vokhoymer to mention the 'intishter' by name rakhmone
litslon would be totally out of the question. So when in their parenting
column they were discussing the how's and when's of corporal punishment the
writer suggested that 'lekatkhile zol men shlogn nor dort vu es iz gemakht
grvorn tsu shlogn'. atsind farshtayt ir farvos men hot es bashafn?!

Subject: A Yom Kippur Scandal?

As to Shari Haber's query (8.033, 2) about where to find the original
Yiddish of "A Yom Kippur Scandal."  In Yiddish it is called "Oysgetreslt" by
Sholem-Aleykhem.  It certainly is in the Folksfond Oysgabe, Ale Verk fun
Sholem-Aleykhem, Volume VI, Kleyne Mentshelekh mit Kleyne Hasoges, page 211. 
This edition was published between 1917-23. 

In 1937, Morgn-Frayhayt published exactly the same series but altered the
volume numbers for reasons that escape me entirely.  There, the volume
entitled "Kleyne Mentshelekh mit Kleyne Hasoges" is Volume 3.  Go figure. 
Other editions of the same material may have yet different numbers.  Seek out
the volume title. 

Incidentally, another English translation besides "A Yom Kippur Scandal" 
exists called "The Search."  In neither English title can one find the
slightest hint of the apt Yiddish title.
