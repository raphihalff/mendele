Shevuos

After Pesach, Spring  ruled our  lives more and  more each day. The days
became warmer, lighter. From after kheder until bedtime there was more
time to play outdoors, and also more time to  devote to making toys. As
long as you had a pocket-knife you could make almost anything: a little
mill from a nut, a stick of wood, a potato and thread; a windmill from a
stick, clip and a bit of paper. Trick-boards; bows and arrows from a
half-hoop, a rope and a pointed twig. A pistol from a goose's foot-bone
and a stick of wood, and so forth.

But the chief pursuit in those few spring weeks was making whistles from
the tender, supple shoots of the willow trees . Keidan used to be
inundated in that season with those sort of shoots: people would twist
them into planks and baskets and carriers. But we youngsters would make
whistles and flutes. A certain length was cut from the smooth shoot, some
little holes were poked out, it was soaked in water, and with a few taps
on the shoot the bark stripped off like a jacket. A little piece of wood
was inserted near the top hole and the whistle, or flute, was ready.

It was, however, the time of Sfire, and you could not whistle, or
everyone would glare at you for being an impudent smart-aleck.

Lag b'Omer relieved some of the season's severity, but only for a day. So
everyone really seized that day, making bows and arrows and going to the
woods outside town for a picnic.

But from the first day of Sivan on, life began to be transformed. From
then until Shevuos we went half-days to kheder : Rosh Khodesh and the
"three days of setting bounds" were already preparation days for Shevuos.
People went prospecting in the Skongale, where you could cut fragrant
water-grass for spreading on floors, and pick bunches of lilacs and other
blossoms to stick in the beams and rafters in honor of Shevuos.

The half days that we spent in Kheder were dedicated to a different sort
of study than usual: The story of Ruth, her love with Boaz in the field
at night among the harvested sheaves. It was filled with images of field,
country and nature, things not foreign to us Keidaner children. Then the
chanted study of Akdomes, with its poetic portrayal of the glory of the
Ruler of the  World, whom even "if all the forests were your pens and all
the waters ink" it would be impossible to describe.

The other half of the free days we spent in different games and in
expeditions to Kelerke's fields, the court road or across the river.

All that, together with the abundant vegetation and colorful cherry
blossoms in the orchards in and around the town, which filled the air
with pleasant smells, filled our young hearts with happiness and  joy.

Two days before Shevuos I went off with my closest friends to Yanushova,
where my mother kept a garden and orchard. I and the gang picked many
bunches of lilacs to decorate the house for yontev. The road home,
through Long Street, was a gauntlet; from all sides we children were
besieged with demands: "Give me a bit of lilac." But our usual answer was
"Go chew some mud," because if we happily supplied everyone who asked,
we'd wind up at home without a single flower.

The day before Shevuos we went to cut water-grass at the bottom of the
Skongale. We chopped it into little bits, and when Mother had cleaned up
the house and scubbed the floor with yellow sand, she spread the
water-grass around the house.

It was still very light outside. The house was cleaned and festive, the
windows hung with clean drapes; from the apothecary orchard, near where
our house stood, a breeze came through the open window carrying smells of
blooming fruit trees, and mixed with the scent of lilac and water-grass
in the house. Father headed for the bathouse in honor of the holiday.

Meishe the Heart -- (he got the nickname because he always went around
with the buttons on his shirt unfastenend) -- the shames of the Eyin
Yakov syagogue, where my father prayed, came with a basket collecting
candles for the synagogue. After he took the few tallow candles that
Mother gave him, he found it necessary to praise the Shevuos holiday: "A
Jewish house smells like the Garden of Eden," Then, detecting the smell
of the dairy-pastries, the babka with saffron and the coffee that was a
centerpiece of the Shevuos meal, he added: "I tell you Khaye Sheyna, I'm
so fond of coffee that I don't know if I can hold out until Shevuos!"

As we come home from shul after evening prayers, and Father makes the
holiday kiddush over raisin-wine, the holiday feels quite unlike Pesach
and Sukkos. First the dairy supper, that we eat only during Shevuos, with
farfel- tzimmes and saltenosis (kreplakh) filled with cheese and fried in
butter and sour cream, and then an unusual sense of freedom. Father sits
down to say the Tikkun Shevuos prayer, and I run around outside with the
children, free as a bird. Mother doesn't even chase us to bed.

In the morning Father came from shul early -- he had prayed at dawn -- I
hadn't done more than bless my tzitzes -- and we ate breakast with the
babke, something that typically happened only on Shevuos.

Then we went strolling until noon. And then more  delicious dairy dishes
with blintzes and coffee. After eating a stroll in Yanushova to visit the
orchard and garden. That is how the holiday was spent in this world. It
was like taking a vacation, and it was very welcome.

And that is why, truly, Shevuos has remained in my memory as the happiest
holiday of my youth.
