Subject: Kvelling in excelsis

The following extract is from John Diamond's newly published _C: because
cowards get cancer too..._(Vermillion, 1998): 

"I even received a letter from that sweetest of men, the Chief Rabbi, to tell
me that prayers were being said in the highest quarters. Well, the second
highest anyway. My grandfather would have kvelled, kvelling being the Yiddish
word which most precisely describes the emotion of a grandfather on
discovering that his cancerous grandson is being prayed for by the Chief
Rabbi. There is almost certainly another Yiddish word which describes the act
of hypothesising on the possible emotions of dead grandfathers, but it's not
one I've yet come across." (pp. 95-6) 

On the far-off-chance, could Diamond be onto something here? is there such a
word (not necessarily for grandparents' emotions...)? 

Many thanks,
Tamar Fox

Subject: Miraculous Mendele

Two special items show off how the miracle of Mendele works for (at least) me.

One: Thanks to Miraslawa Bulat for explaining the origin and meanings of
khalaburde (1, 8.012).  That puts one finishing touch to my understanding of a
light-hearted letter from Sholem-Aleykhem to Mendele Moykher Sforim.  All the
way from Poland came the clarification of an apparently rare word.

The second example is Shaya Mitelman's quotation of Sholem-Aleykhem's letter
to Tolstoy (2, 8.013).  That helps fill in a picture.  I envy those who know
BOTH Russian and Yiddish because a letter from Tolstoy in answer to Sholem-
Aleykhem is available in both the original Russian (Cyrillic alphabet) and a
Yiddish translation.  See Dos Sholem-Aleykhem Bukh, ed. I.D. Berkowitz, New
York: Ikuf, 1926, 1958, p, 236.

Subject: ENK

Well, I grew up in the eastern Tyrol, Austria, where "enk" is used to this
day.
The forms would be:
* You (pl) are here = Es saits do
* Your (pl) house = Enker haus
* I give to you (pl) = I gib enk
* I see you (pl) = I sich enk
So it seems that all three forms mentionned above could be related to
German.
There is no distinction between the dual and plural in the dialect, as far
as I know.

Johannes Seppi

Subject: 1. es/dos; 2. izn iz er; 3. khurbn/khorbn; 4. enk(er)/ets

1. Peter Klues (08.014) asks about the special Yiddish usage of "es" and
"dos" in the sentences "vi tsit men ES vider op, dem gantsn inyen?"  "hob ikh
zikh dervust, az DOS hot eyner fun mayne gehilfn opgeroymt di roln." 

Note that the two can be combined in, for example:
"hob ikh zikh dervust, az DOS hot ES eyner fun mayne gehilfn opgeroymt di
roln." 

For some wonderful additional examples, see Ayzik Zaretski's _Praktishe
yidishe gramatik_, Moscow, 1926. Indeed, anyone with a serious interest in
Yiddish should know this still unsurpassed grammar. (The 1926 edition is far
superior to the 1929 edition.)  

For a discussion of the "expletive es"  (and other fine points of Yiddish
grammar), see the University of Michigan Dissertation by Zelda Kahane-Newman:
_An Annotation of Zaretski's Praktishe yidishe gramatik_. (It's available
through University Microfilms.) If Zelda is a Mendele subscriber, she may
wish to add something to the discussion. 

2. Alexander Maxwell (08.014) asks about a rule that governs the unique 
formation _izn, iz er_.

A rule can be formulated concerning a "tautological infinitive" that permits
constructions like _tantsn, tants ikh nit, ober zingen, zing ikh yo". ('As
for dancing, I don't dance, but, as for singing, I do sing'.) The rule:
"infinitive + the appropriate finite form of the same verb. 

There are a limited number of cases where this doesn't work: _binen, bin
ikh_, _izn, iz er_, _viln, vil ikh nit_ (Note that the infinitive should be
_veln_), _veln, vel ikh nit_ (Note that, in this case, "veln" is a form of
the future auxilliary which has no infinitive.) _veysn, veys ikh nit_ (The
expected infinitive is _visn_.) =20

In these case, perhaps we can speak of special "infinitive-like" formations
for use exclusively in the context of the cited construction (which we've
designated "tautologous infinitive"). Perhaps there is a more sophisticated
formulation (Dovid Braun? Ellen Prince?) 

As for the origin of the construction, the only one I've heard (where??), but
would not push too hard, cites the Hebrew construction _hayo haya_ as a
model. 

3. Fayvel Halpern (08.014) confuses _kharpe, _khurbn_, and _korbn_.  Toronto,
bless it, is _a shtu:it fin poylishe yidn_, so its no surprise that he hears
Hebrew _khurban_ 'destruction' as _khorbn_ in Yiddish (There's that lowering
before "r" again.)  _Oy a khorbn_!!, Right? And, NOT to be confused with
_korbn_ 'sacrifice'. As for _kharpe_, listen for _a kharpe 'n a shande_.

4. Feygl Glezer (8.015) is puzzled about _enk/enker/ets_ in Lodz. These forms
were the rule throughout western Poland reaching eastward to Warsaw and then
some. Their Yiddish distribution is actually geographically contiguous with
their occurrence in Austrian German. 

I wrote about this on Mendele some time ago (and, I'm beginning to think,
even more recently). Suffice it to say, now, that a feature of the same
system of the "dual" (imperatives like _kumts, geyts, shraybts_ ) through
eastern Poland, as well, and were even known in Vilna in the mid-18th
century.

Subject: Chas vechalila

Irving Young inquires about the derivation of "Khas vekhalila," often used in
the sense of "God forbid."

Both words are Hebrew and both are found in Tanakh.  "Khalilah" makes its
first appearance in Avraham Avinu's negotiation with one of the three
"messengers" (malokhim) sent to announce the impending destruction of Sodom
and Gomorrah.  Nearing the end of his bargaining session, and appearing to
speak directly to God, he says that if there are 20 righteous persons in
those disreputable places, "Khalilah l'kha"--It would be unworthy of you,
God, to exterminate the righteous with the wicked.  Such khutzpah! 
"Khalilah"  obviously can't mean "God forbid" when one is speaking directly
to God.  So its meaning must be something more or less similar to the English
"unworthy"  or possibly "desecration."  Along the same lines, we have "Khilul
shabbos" and "Khilul hashem," the desecration of shabbos or of God's name, in
which the first word is simply another form of "khalilah." 

"Khas" is also found here and there, and always, if I'm not mistaken, as an
interjection at the beginning of a sentence that deals with some highly
undesirable situation--the destruction of a city, for example.  It's almost
as if the author were trying to say, Hush, let it not be said that
such-and-such might happen. 

"Khas" is related to "Khus," which is found, for example, in the High Holiday
liturgy, "Khus vrakhem aleynu,"--Khus and be merciful to us--suggesting that
"Khas" and words related to it are more or less synonymous with other words
having to do with compassion, mercy, etc.  And of course, in common parlance
we have "Khas v'sholom," with the same connotation. 

A gut vokh alle.

Subject: Laas

Sam Kwesner mentions a language called laas (loos?),as an alternate jewish
language. 
Laas is used frequently by Rashi as a language into which he translates words
from Hebrew or Aramaic. We have always read this as an abbreviation of "Lashon
Am Zar (or Am ZU) presumably referring to the French of his era. Is there a
distinct jewish language corresponding to this designation?

Subject: modern usage of 'shvartser'

Sholem-aleykhem, khaveyrim; I have a question for anyone interested.  I am
researching a sociology project on the usage and received understanding of
the word 'shvartser' by English-speaking Americans.  As a sidebar, I wondered
what the Mendeleyaner think about how to name African-Americans in Yiddish. 
Referring to Weinreich (yes, it's still the only Yiddish dictionary I have,
but I'd rather concentrate on spoken language anyway), I can only find
'shvartser' and 'neger' as translations for a black person.  Since that
dictionary was published before black Americans began referring to themselves
through their geographic background, and since it's meant to be a normative
catalog of written Yiddish, I wanted to get feedback about how Americans
actually use it. 

In Yiddish, 'shvartser' is a perfectly ordinary, neutral word.  In English,
though, there is often the perception that it is derogatory -- why else use a
Yiddish word when an English one is readily available?  And I've never even
heard anyone actually say 'neger' in conversation.  Did this just fall by the
wayside by itself, or did people ever mention its disturbing similarity to the
English pejorative 'nigger?'

Moreover, I would prefer to bring Yiddish vocabulary up to speed on
sociological developments.  On those rare occasions when I speak about
African-Americans in Yiddish, I use a word that I suppose I have coined: 
'afrikan-amerikaner.' Does anyone else use this, or some other similar
construction?  Is there an official lexical entry like it? 

Please send me anything you would like to contribute to my research.  A
sheynem dank.
