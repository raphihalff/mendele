Subject: Fishman papers

The Fishmans have asked me to post the following:

Stanford University has recently acquired the Papers of Dr. Joshua
A. (Shikl) Fishman and Gella Schweid Fishman. Dr. Fishman is a noted
sociolinguist and activist in the field of Yiddish language and
culture. His papers include materials from his courses, lectures,
and research projects, as well as published and unpublished works.
Mrs. Fishman's papers pertain primarily to her work in the Yiddish
secular school movement in the United States. Also included are
manuscripts of the Yiddish poetry of Rukhl Fishman, Dr. Fishman's
sister. The collection also comprises professional and personal
correspondence, as well as other materials pertaining to Yiddishist
activity among five generations of the Fishman family.

For further information, please contact Margaret Kimball, Head of
Special Collections, Stanford University Libraries, at

Subject: Vos meint "intermarriage"?

Dan Leeson writes:

Dan goes on to use the term "intermarriage" extensively to mean
"marrying relatives".  I've always known the term to mean "marrying
out" (i.e., marrying a non-Jew). Is its use in Dan's terms common?

And, to bring us back to an appropriate topic for MENDELE, what are
the Yiddish words for (1) marrying out, and (2) "intermarriage" in
the sense that Dan uses it?

Subject: A query

I need an authoritative spelling with nikud for the Aramaic
feminine of "roshe"; i.e. for Yiddish "rOshete/reshAnte".

Much obliged.

Subject: Ludwik Zamenhof's Yiddish grammar

In the Feb. 4 and 11 issues of the "Forverts," Dovid Katz has two
articles on Yiddish and Esperanto -- specifically, on Dr. Ludwik
Zamenhof's relationship to the predominant language of his native
Bialystok (a city that was well over half Jewish in his day).  A
portion of an otherwise unpublished Yiddish grammar by Zamenhof was
printed in "Dos naye leben" (NY) in 1909; at the conclusion of his
second article Dovid Katz asks the following question:

"Tsi hot zikh amol ergetsvu oyfgehit a kopye fun Zamenhofs keynmol
nisht farefntlekhter gramatik fun yidish, vos er hot geshribn mit an
erekh 120 yor tsurik? ... Tsi hot es mitgenumen in Amerike A.
Litvin? [der aroysgeber fun 'Dos naye leben' -- ZB]  Nokh zayn toyt
in 1943, zaynen zayne papirn ariber in arkhiv fun der Yivo.  Darf
men zukhn."

Regretfully, it appears that A. Litvin did not have a copy of the
Zamenhof manuscript.  I have checked the inventory to the A. Litvin
Papers in the YIVO Archives (Record Group #206) and did not find any
mention of a manuscript meeting that description.  It is conceivable
-- though not likely, since the inventory is quite detailed -- that
the grammar might yet be located among Litvin's papers, but that
would require more time and effort that I am able to devote at this
time.

Liber Hirshe-Dovid, kh'veys nit tsi du krigstdem MENDELE.  Tomer

Subject: Indian Jewry

In discussing the origin of European Jews, Ellen Prince interjects
(in a much earlier issue of Mendele--I was out of town):

>furthermore,
>we know that it was entirely male migration in the case of the jews
>of india, and yet these communities have managed to keep a strictly
>jewish identity to the present day.

I would appreciate it if Ellen could provide a reference to this
point. Are we talking about the Cochini jews, or the bnei israel?
