Subject: answer

In regard to the English verb "answer," I have to disagree with my friend
Morrie Feller.  In English, "answer" is a transitive verb--unlike "tell" (e.g.
"tell me the story," etc.)  "Answer to" is an entirely different verb, meaning
to be responsible to, etc. 
        
Furthermore, the grammatical status of an English verb has no bearing on a
Yiddish verb like "entfern".  There is no logical reason why a Yiddish verb
should take the accusative or dative.  "Entfern" presumably takes the dative
because it derives from a dative verb in German:  "antworten."  Cases are
traditional and have little logic to them.  Yiddish cases are a bit simpler
than German ones, since German has verbs that take a genitive object:  "ich
habe seiner vergessen."  Granted, most of these genitive verbs have changed
cases in contemporary German, but they're still interesting because in the
original Indo-European language,a transitive verb took the genetive and not
the accusative.  indeed, the Slavic tongues have maintained an extensive use
of genetive objects for transitive verbs.  Thus Russian uses a genitive object
for living beings and every negative transitive verb takes a genitive object. 

As I've said, there's no logic to the Yiddish dative for "entfern"--like many,
probably most, features of any language, usage is an absolute beyond any
reasonable explanation. 
        
Incidentally, there's one German verb that takes a double accusative--which is
a rarity: "lehren" (teach):  "Er lehrt sie die Sprache"  I know of no such
example in Yiddish.

Subject: Newsflash: _whore_ in Bulgarian

According to Roumyana Izvorski, an advanced grad student at in linguistics
Penn currently spending the year at MIT and a Bulgarian, the Bulgarian word
for 'whore' is _kurva_. 

Will it now be claimed that Yiddish may have infiltrated Bulgarian as it's
been claimed to have infiltrated Old Church Slavonic?

Subject: Gratitude for facts about _G_ and _H_

I thank those who have responded to my question about Russian use of _G_ where
Yiddish and English often use _H_.  The disagreements among the specialists is
illuminating in its revelation of uncertainties.

The facts are important.  Whatever the uncertainties regarding origins, the
description of the facts is most important to me.  Given my interest in
Yiddish literature and especially in the life, times and works of Sholem
Aleichem, I am delighted to learn, and am educated by, facts of which I was
not previously aware. 

The depth of the discussion about origins that has followed illustrates, in my
opinion, how valuable it is to raise a question on Mendele.  The relevant
linguistic science is obviously in a higher state of development than most us
(I would guess) have realized.  The depth of the resulting discussion also
illustrates that the answer to the question is a research work in progress. 
Uncertainties most probably remain.  But that's the way it is for scientists
who must have a high tolerance for uncertainty or they are lost.  Yasher
koyekh to the laborers in the field.  It seems, there is much labor to be
done.

Subject: Shvat nyi brat

David Herskovic wrote another version of a frequent winter saying of my Booba
( from Chernike in Minske Gubernya)  "Shvat nyi brat"= the month of Shvat
(usually February) is no brother. I never heard the rest of the saying that he
quoted.  I understood it to be a Russian saying, as it would be "Shvat iz
nisht kin bruder" in Yiddish. It was nice to recognise it on Mendele.

Subject: vayoymer-dovid glitshn

In Mendele Vol 07.174, Andrew Cassel asks what the point of vayoymer-dovid
glitshn was. I myself am hard put to understand what the point of ice-skating
is.

Be that as it may, as I understand it, glitshing is not enough; the sport is
elaborated by "figures", e.g. skating the figure eight -- familiar to most
Americans, from movies if not from experience. Jewish children invented
figures of their own, based on their culture. I should have supplied the
letter writer's own explanation: 

"_analogye_: in groys takhenen (montik un donershtik), az men kumt tsu
'vayoymer dovid', darf men zikh aniderzetsn un onshparn dem kop af der rekhter
hant (nefiles-apayim) un zitsn azoy biz tsu 'yeyvoyshu roga' (16 psukim)." 

By the way, I did not spend two years researching the topic. I have been
singularly blessed for the effort of cleaning for Peysekh by uncovering,
almost every year, some piece of information which has been eluding me
(except, of course, the etymology of davnen...).

From: AJ Gilboa <bfgilboa@weizmann.weizmann.ac.il>
Subject: Vyoimer-dovid-glitshn

I think I have the answer to that. "Vyoimer Dovid" is the opening of a posuk
in Shmuel Bais (va-yomer david el gad, tsar li m'od; nip'la na b'yad Adonai
uv-yad adam al epola) which is quoted at the beginning of Tahanun (the daily
penitential prayer following Shahris and Minho) at least in minhog Ashkenaz.
It is customary to recite Tahanun seated with the head resting on the left arm
(or the right, if one has tefillin on the left) in a supplicatory position.
Resting the head on the hand while sitting in Vyoimer-dovid-glitshn is clearly
derived from this.  Incidentally, Tahanun is also referred to as "n'filas
apayim" - inclination of the face.

I wish to acknowledge the help of my friend, Gershom Martin, in arriving at
this insight.

Subject: seeking yiddish reference for chaim grade story

the recent movie "the quarrel" is based on a chaim grade story "my quarrel
with hersch ressanyer". i'm trying to find the yiddish reference, the name of
the story and the collection it appears in ( in yiddish ). one of the books i
own gives an incorrect name for the collection. thank you.

Subject: Dopess

On March 17 Zachry Baker discussed Leo Rosten's fanciful treatment of
"dopess" (an ineffectual person, fool) and speculates that the etymology may
forward the following speculation.  If this word was indeed known among urban
American Jews, could it not have developed from "tipesh" influenced by the
English "dope"?  There is an obviously cognate word in Pennsylvania German,
"dopish" meaning clumsy or foolish, which according to the Dictionary of
American Regional English, is from the Std. German "taepisch."
