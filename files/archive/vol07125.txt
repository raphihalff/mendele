Subject: Abelson's encyclopedia

Re Abelson's encyclopedia mentioned by Gevaryahu [07.123]. I have a
pristine
copy of the text, but rebound.  Whatever its lexicological or
etymological or
scientific linguistic merits it is an endless source of humor: the
examples,
in english, of 'idiomatic' usage are sensational.  The best found to
date
illustrates 'to prune with' as "He pruned himself with borrowed
feathers."
More typical, 'hunt up' is given as "When you are in Chicago hunt up
my
uncle," which is certainly Ok.  One can reconstruct a 1920s Brooklyn
sociology
from a compilation of the sentences given to illustrate usage, and in
an
evident attempt at being all encompassing, perhaps on the level of
the
Oxford-English, the archaicisms and colloquilisms defined are a gold
mine.
Whenever conversation with guests lags all one need do is take out
Abelson,
open to almost any page, and read especially the illustrative
sentences.  To
illustrate, I have just taken the book off the shelf, opened at random,
and
have. by way of illustration thefollowing.  avenge:  He will avenge the
blood
of his servants. avenger:  the Lord is the avenger of all.  Right on!

Subject: H.D.Nomberg, the commentator

John Gay gave good advice.
Those who in quarrels interpose,
Must often wipe a bloody nose.
John Gay (1685-1732), English dramatist. Fables, "The Mastiff"
(1727).

This post is, I hope, a contribution to Yiddish education, not to
controversy.

Reading Tsvishn Berg by Hirsh Dovid Nomberg piqued my curiosity
about him. 
Surely there is more to him that that.  I had read only what
Encyclopedia
Judaica said about him.  Nachman Meisel includes a brief,
appreciative essay
about him in good Yiddish style and spelling in his book, Noente un
Eygene
(Those who are Close to us and of us), New York: IKUF (Yidisher
Kulter
Farband), 1957, pp. 121-127.  It was written in 1942 in
commemoration of
Nomberg's fifteenth yortsayt, in the awful days of World War II. 

Meisel's essay is not the last word about him.  Nothing is said about
his
participation in the Czernowitz conference of 1908, surely a key
contribution
and a key moment in Nomberg's life. 

In Meisel's assessment, Nomberg (1874-1927) emerges as lacking
the soaring
imagination required for story-telling belles-lettres.  His characters
never
took on a life of their own, bursting the bounds set by the author, as
happens
in the works of many creative writers.  On the other hand, in the last
two
decades of his unfortunately brief life, Nomberg became a highly
talented and
effective commentator on current affairs.  _The commentator in him
defeated
the story-teller_. Once a week, he labored long and hard to put
together his
thoughts.  The results were, in Meisel's judgment, masterful.  Today,
such
carefully wrought commentaries would, no doubt, afford very
valuable insights
into the lively Yiddish world of those times.  Are they accessible? 

In one passage, Meisel refers to Nomberg coming to Warsaw from
his shtetl at
almost 25 and his association with Peretz.  Peretz was about 25
years older
than Nomberg.  Peretz was always filled with ideas, enthusiastic
flights of
imagination, and, compared to Nomberg, Peretz seemed youthful
while Nomberg
seemed old. 

In Meisel's essay, Nomberg emerges as a tragic figure, mainly
pessimistic,
depressed, and sometimes out of touch with then current
excitements among
fellow writers.  Miesel writes (p. 121): grod ven nomberg gufe iz
geven
shvakh, mid, shtark-oysgeshept, iz dos arumike yidishe lebn in poyln
ful geven
mit lebn, mit impet, mit yunglekhe un laydnshaftlekhe farmestn.
Oftmol hot es
im shtark fardrosn un tif gekrenkt, vos di yunge, di naye farloyfn im
dem veg,
farshrayen im, fartumlen im...  (Translation) Just when Nomberg
himself was
weak, tired, feeling rather drained, Jewish life in Poland around him
was full
of energy, bursting with youthful and passionate aspirations.  Often
he was
deeply distressed and aggravated that the young, new colleagues
would stand in
his way, noisily shout him down... 

Of course, all of this is from Meisel's viewpoint, his _kukvinkl_.
Nomberg
deserves to speak for himself, and I hope some library collections
afford that
opportunity.

Subject: efsher genug shen fun davenen

Concerning the ongoing discussion on whether the ongoing
discussion of
the word davenen is interesting, I found two things enlightening, not
to
say consciousness raising.  One is that Philologos got dragged in,
although he did not explicitly acknowledge Mendele in his column.
The other
was Leon Rosenberg's story about the parrot.

Subject: yiddish expression

Is there a Yiddish expression that translates to "A rock in my heart"?
I know
a 94 year old woman that uses that expression in English, and am
wondering if
it has it's root in Yiddish. She speaks of the death of loved ones as "a
rock
in my heart".

My grandma used to use the expression "A heartz vatic", which I
believe to
mean "heart ache"?  Any Yiddish you know along these lines?
Thanks!

Subject: "hegdish"

A "hegdish" was a community-supported building ( more often a hut
or barn) for
the use of the Jewish poor and homeless, and indigent transients in
the
shtetlekh.  Its squalor and moreover, its < disorder> are
memorialized in the
use of "hegdish" as a synonym for "mess" or "chaos".

Subject: fremder menner fuhn kindheit uhn

Now that I read Mendele, I can scratch a longstanding itch
propagated by my
parents (Eishyshukers who prattled on in L:ithuanian, Polish, Russian,
some
German, their unique version of English as well as Litvak, der
smetana fuhn
Yiddisher folk. Who in the world are these people: the Motke in nit by
Motke...the Itchkeh in Itchkeh der kuhritchkah...the Moyshe in
Moyshe
Kapoyer...the Mischa in Mischa Borch (a "pet" word for my father
which my
mother flung around the apartment like a bolo). I have a list of many
other
words which I haven't been able to trace strictly to Yiddish, though I
haven't
been as diligent about it as some of the polemicists I have been
sloughing
through since becoming an official Mendelista. Please forgive the
horrible
phoneticization. It's all I can do at my age to remember the subject
of this
brevele.

Subject: Linguistics

Rick Turkel poses a good question when he asks what's wrong with
admitting
sporadic sound changes such as that in the Slavic word for '9' with a
d- in
place of Indo-European n-.  The answer is rather simple:  such
sporadic
developments (a) fall into cetain definite patterns, such as
assimilation or
dissimilation with respect to another item in a series (as in Slavic d-
form
for '9' because '10' begins with 'd')  --but that only applies to words
which
are commonly found in a series; assimilation or dissimilation of
nonadjacent s
vs. sh sounds (e.g., Yiddish shames < shamash)  or l vs. r sounds
(e.g.,
pilgrim vs. peregrine), etc.,etc., and (b) cannot be used to justify an
otherwise uncertain etymology--that is, we posit such changes in
cases where
we are certain about the etymology and cannot otherwise account for
the sounds
we find.  There are many examples of very attractive etymologies
which
linguists would not accept until and unless the sound changes could
be shown
to be nonsporadic, although the best examples I can think happen to
be in
Armenian and so I wont go into them here.

Davenen < divinare or divinum does not fit either (a) or (b), and
THAT is why
it cannot possiblybe accepted--even if there were no other
objections (I think
Birnbaum did have others).
