Subject: Nivel pe

The term 'nivel pe' (Vol. 5.187) includes obscenities, pornography,
sexual innuendo and even love stories. Various biblical stories would
probably be classified as nivel pe by that rosh yeshive had they not
appeared in the Bible in the first place and the characters were other
than who they were.

With a name like 'di tsniesdike gartel' (The Chastity Belt) it is obvious
why the rosh yeshive termed it nivel pe rather than plain bitel toyre.

The literal meaning of 'nivel pe' is fowling of the mouth. It is only
used to imply as we would say in English 'talking dirty'. In Talmudic and
Rabbinic literature it is classed together with loshen hore and rekhilus
(defamation and slander).

There is a gemore in mesekhtes shabes regarding NP that almost sounds as
if it is straight out of a peyrets or zinger short story.

'It is universally known why a kale enters the khipe but he who fowls his
mouth will descend into the depths of the Gehenne.'

Subject: Judeo-languages: The case of Alsace

To Mikhl Herzog:

I enjoyed very much your essay on the above in Mendele Vol 5.188.
However, I am compelled to take issue with the third example below:

>What's in a language name? How different are Serbian and Croatian? Dutch,
>Flemish, and Low German? Belorussian and Ukrainian?

I've been a student of Slavic linguistics for over twenty years, and have
_never_ encountered anyone in the field who considers Belorussian and
Ukrainian dialects of the same language.  There are many differences
between them in phonology, morphology and syntax, and they are far from
being mutually intelligible (except perhaps for local dialects within a
narrow band along the border area between them).

You continued:

>              Yet we say that the differences between Serbian and
>Croatian are between "languages", but those between High and Low German
>are "only" differences between "dialects".

There is no question that the Serbian/Croatian situation is full of
politics.  I am fluent in Serbocroatian, which most non-native linguists
consider to be a single language.  My teachers were Serbs, and most of my
speaking experience has been with a Croat.  When I first met the latter,
it took me all of two weeks to get over the dialectal differences between
her speech and that I had heard earlier.  And that was after only one
year of course work - how much easier would it be for a native speaker?
The differences between the two standard variants are no greater than
those between British and American English, in my opinion.  Like the
situation of Hindi and Urdu in South Asia, much of the difference is
cultural/religious.  (That isn't to say that a peasant from northwestern
Croatia would have an easy time trying to communicate with one from
southeastern Serbia, or that a Serb from the vicinity of Nis^ could
readily understand a Croat from outside Pula; that is to be expected.)
Objectively, the only criterion by which standard literary Serbian and
Croatian can be judged to be different languages is that which defines a
language as a dialect with an army.  To the great sorrow of much of the
civilized world, that seems to be the way it's being played out currently
in Bosnia-Hercegovina.

The question of High and Low German is also a political one, but in the
reverse.  I doubt that many would consider them dialects of the same
language if they weren't spoken within a single country.  Even so, I
believe most linguists consider Frisian a separate language, and the
closest one to English.

Dutch, Flemish and Low German, as far as I know, are generally treated as
dialects of the same language, since they are mutually intelligible for
the most part from Hamburg to Brussels.

It's interesting that you used these examples.  Many years ago I read
somewhere that the differences across the Slavic speech community (from
Russian to Slovenian, from Polish to Bulgarian) are no greater than those
found within the borders of (then East and West) Germany.

Zayt gezunt un shtark.

Subject: Auld Lang Syne

Does anyone know of a good, i.e., singable translation into Yiddish of
"Auld Lang Syne"? It would be fun to have it this New Year's Eve. If one
doesn't exist already, maybe some of you would like to post your
different versions and we can come up with a standard one. How 'bout it,
folks?

Which reminds me of a wonderful thing that just happened to me that
knocked my socks off. As the new Director of the Southern California
District of the Arbeter Ring (Workmen's Circle), I sat in on our chorus
rehearsal my first day at work a month ago. They were beginning to
rehearse the Chanukah songs for our party Sunday, December 17th at 1 pm
(1525 S. Robertson Blvd., Los Angeles--everyone invited, AR members free,
guests $3). They launch into "Zeh der ziegreicher," which turns out to be
"Hail the conquering hero comes" from George Frideric Handel's oratorio
"Judas Maccabeus." Handel in Yiddish! Nu? Incidentally, the chorus is
free and open to anyone who wishes to sing with us. We rehearse at the
Arbeter Ring Center Mondays at 1:30 pm. It's a genial time. Come sing!
It's the only Yiddish chorus in L.A.

I have heard that Bekishe is the transposed acronym of Bigdei Shabbos
