Subject: Tsar Nikolai

The song about Tsar Nikolai quoted by Sheldon Benjamin (4.420) in
response to Meyshe-yankl Sweet's earlier posting (4.418) was one of the
most popular Russian workers' songs of 1905, known in many variants.
Perhaps the most famous lines are from the middle of the song:

        Tsar' ispugalsia, izdal manifest --
        Mertvym svobodu, zhivykh pod arest.

(The tsar got frightened and issued a manifesto:  freedom for the dead
and jail for the living.)  Two lines from the refrain are also well
known: Rossiia, Rossiia, zhal' mne tebia, Bednaia, gor'kaia uchast'
tvoia.

(Russia, Russia, I feel sorry for you; poor and bitter is your fate).

The Yiddish text that I learned from a graduate-school roommate (who
claimed to have learned it from his mother) starts off:  "Tsar
Nikolayke..." and proceeds into Russian and Yiddish obscenities directed
at Nikolai's mother and his wife ("Zey nor mit vemen du host khasene
gehat...").  If anyone is interested, I can supply the text (in a plain
brown [electronic] envelope) upon request, but unless otherwise directed
by Reb Noyekh, I will--in keeping with the mores of my generation--
refrain from sullying the pages of Mendele.

dream of directing Bob Rothstein to do anything of the sort.  nm]

Harriet Feinberg: Were your mother's Podolyer parents (h)aitsh [i.e.,
"h"] droppers?

Re koyletsh, keep your eye on this space.

Subject: National Yiddish Book Center

I was appalled by Mr. Sherman's response to the call of organized labor
to require the National Yiddish Book Center to deal with the employers
who use union labor.Since when do we as ethical Jews measure all
things,or for that matter ethical Americans ,by the "best price"?  Should
we buy goods made by Chinese Communist child labor brcause its cheaper?
Should we have bought Nazi made goods bedause it was cheaper?  Did we buy
Japanese made cars because they may be cheaper without any concern for
our fellow Americans in Detroit?

Do we spit in the face of the American trade unions that for years have
supported Jewish causes throughout the world with money, manpower and
political clout?

There are thousands of us, who live fairly decent lives in our old age
because of the unions, who resent the contemptuous, gratuitous attacks by
dollar worshippers.

I speak for a group of about 60  Jewish senior citizens who attend my
Hadassah discussion group . Most of us have given time, money, books
and labor to the NJBC . At our next meeting we will send a massive
telegram, solicited in many areas in San Diego, urging the NJBC to do the
ethical thing and support organized labor.

A sheynem dank David Sherman!  I fully agree that the NYBC is fully
justified in hiring non-union workers for the construction of its new
facilities.

Perhaps I'm denser than most, but I fail completely to understand why the
fact that an institution is trying to preserve Yiddish literature and to
disseminate it imposes a special obligation on it to spend more of its
limited resources in order to please old-line unionisten.

I'm even more puzzled as to why this issue is germane at all to a group
that is devoted specifically to Yiddish language.  It's a political
issue, not a linguistic or even a cultural one.

Construction of the new NYBC headquarters with scab labor desecrates the
memory of the donors, whose gifts of Yiddish books  made the NYBC
possible.

It is misleading to write, as David Sherman has written, that the NYBC
"collects and distributes Yiddish books".  More accurate is this:  the
NYBC is given Yiddish books free of charge and it then turns around and
sells them at market  or  above market prices.  The books' donors  were,
by and large, workers  -- proste mentshn, undzere eltern, bobes, zeydes
-- who, in many cases, bought the books with sweat-shop earnings.  In
the 1920's and 1930's, some fought with their blood to build labor unions
to insure humane working conditions for themselves and succeeding
generations.

By accepting these books, Aaron and the NYBC board have incurred a moral
obligation to the donors -- certainly not to desecrate their memory.
Most wouldn't have knowingly given away their books for housing in
quarters built by scab labor.

Now that we've had a suitable exchange of pleasantries, maybe we can
avoid an endless repetition of the same themes and arguments.

However, and with all due respect to Berel Leiser, the notion of a non-
political culture is beyond imagining.  Is there a culture anywhere that
has nothing to say about power or justice or good and evil?  And even if
there were such a culture (there isn't), can anyone visualize a
non-political _Yiddish_ world?  The existence of Yiddish has been and is
a political issue. Its very orthography has been a political issue. Its
literature began with the quite explicit political satires of the
eponymous Mendele.

Yiddish-speakers without politics?  Zekher Sam Goldwyn: in two words, im
possible.

Mendele will therefore always be open to politics.  What's to be avoided
is slogans, bromides, cliches and heartfelt (as well as heartless)
pieties.  Mendele will therefore not accept any further posts on this
subject unless they have something fresh and interesting to say.  Rules
of civility apply as always.
