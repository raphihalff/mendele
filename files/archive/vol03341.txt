Subject: "Teibele & Her Demon" the story & the play

Last week I saw a play entitled "Teibele and Her Demon" at the Jewish
Repertory Theatre in New York, apparently a revival of an original
Broadway production. The play was based on Singer's well-known story and
was allegedly "adapted for the stage by Mr. Singer and Eve Friedman." I
say "allegedly" because the play does such violence to Singer's beautiful
story that it is difficult for me to believe that Singer could have
approved it let alone co-authored it. I'll summarize below, but would
appreciate any information Mendelnicks might be able to offer.

The play and story agree that Teibele, an abandoned Shtetel wife, is
forced and cajoled into a sexual relationship by Alchonon, the teacher's
helper, pretending to be a demon. Eventually, she comes to accept the
situation and to look forward to their meetings.

In the story, Teibele's marriage had been marked by tragedy. All three of
her children died in infancy. After that "her womb closed up." Finally,
her husband deserted her and disappeared.  Alchonon is a widower, "a
dissipated fellow, full of cunning goatish tricks." No fool, Teibele
found that her lover "had all the habits and frailties of a man," and
that his tales of demonhood were full of contradictions, but she "neither
probed nor wished to probe too closely." After her demon comes to her one
last time, feverish and miserable, he comes no more. Soon after, Teibele
finds herself following Alchonon's corpse to the cemetery.

In the play, Teibele's husband had been sexually impotent and quite
incapable of having impregnated her. Alchonon is a starry-eyed student of
the Cabala hopelessly in love with Teibele. As the demon, he tells
Teibele that she will soon be free to marry, but she must marry Alchonon,
a man for whom she has nothing but contempt. He conspires with a friend
to have a forged document produced attesting to the husband's death and,
grieving, Teibele goes along with the marriage. As Alchonon's wife she
find him sexually repulsive and yearns for her demon.  Finally in
desperation, Alchonon arranges (don't ask me why he thought this might
help) an orgy involving his friend (who is pretending to be the demon),
Teibele, and her best friend (but not Alchonon).  Just as the friend is
about to help himself to the two acquiescent women, the rabbi and his
helpers burst onto the scene, preventing the consummation of the
three-some and eliciting a confession of everything from Alchonon. But
Teibele refuses to accept the fact that her demon was really Alchonon,
and goes somewhat mad. A year later as she is dying an operatic death,
Alchonon is persuaded by the rabbi to ease her death by denying his
previous confession.

As my parents would have said, "Kham shtram."

Subject: Oyve Butl; Kushik

Two brief queries: Just heard the expression "Oyve Butl", seeming to mean
in context "I've got my own tsores." Butl I know, as nullity etc., but
can't find "Oyve" or this expression anywhere.  My mother used "Abe
Butl", as an expression of contempt.  Could this be the same phrase?

What about "kushik", basket in standard Yiddish but often used in my
youth to refer to a large shopping bag.  Is this just ideolect, or an
American Yiddish extension of meaning?

Subject: Introduction

I'm a librarian and have always had a keen interest in languages. So far,
reading the Forverts every week and rereading Weinreich and Dovid Katz
take up all the time I have to devote to Yiddish.

I'm delighted to have discovered Mendele for two reasons. First, because
I find that Yiddish is such an eclectic language that the standard
reference works, excellent though they are, never answer all my
questions. Second, because connecting with people who know and use the
language is what makes it come alive.

Subject: Introduction

My name is Pavel, I am 24 years old, I study eastern european history,
political science and slavonic studies in the 5th year at the university
of Erlangen/Nuremberg in southern Germany (ca. 100 miles north of
Munich). My specialization is Jewish history of Bohemia and Moravia. My
background is sort of crazy, but I want to explain a bit, maybe it helps
to solve strange questions...

I come from a family with 4 nationalities and 3 (4) confessions and live
since 1975 between Germany and the Czech republic. I am Czech-jewish, my
mother is Czech-atheist, her 2nd husband Serb-Orthodox, my step-sister
German-CzechoYugo, my father Czech-atheist, his wife Czech-catholic and
their children tend to be something Italo-Czecho as they live in Italy.

Excuse me for this crazy goulash, but it explains in a way my own
schizophrenia... but if you ask me where I am at home: It's Prague. I
have studied some Yiddish at my university, but unfortunately there are
nearly no genuine native speakers around here to converse with. But I
love the language and the culture connected to it, so I am happy for
every opportunity to get in touch with the "Yiddish world". I don't know
if I will be able to contribute on a high level to the fascinating
professional discussions on the server, but I speak fluently a couple of
languages, so if anybody has any questions on slavonic, germanic or
francophone particularities, maybe I can help. Personally I am especially
interested, where and how Yiddish is still in use worldwide and to learn
about some personal experience the mendeleyniks have made or are making.

I speak following languages:
Czech, German - mother tongues
English, French, Russian, Serbo-Croat - very good
Italian, Dutch - good
some Slovak, Polish, Spanish, Hebrew...

Subject: Galicia

There is an assumption on the part of many of us that the name Galicia,
as applied to the region of former Austria-Hungary whence many of our
ancestors came (including my own maternal grandparents), refers to an
ancient Celtic presence in the area.  This is based on the coincidence
that a region of northwestern Spain bears the identical name.  However,
these two names are what my French text book calls "faux amis" -- i.e.,
they look and sound alike but have different meanings, or, in this, case,
different etymologies.

In Roman times, Spanish Galicia was known as Gallaecia, which is indeed
(as far as I recall) derived from an association with Celts, or Gauls.
As MENDELnikes may recall from a previous posting, the most prominent
native son of that Galicia was Generalisimo Francisco Franco (still
dead).

Austro-Hungarian Galicia owes its name to Halicz, a duchy that united
with the duchy of Vladimir after 1188 and became part of Poland in the
14th century.  Some historical sources refer to it as the duchy of
Galicia and Lodomeria (note the connection of the latter toponym to the
Yiddish name for Vladimir Volynski/ Wlodzimierz:  Ludmir [home of the
Ludmirer moyd]).  The "G" in Galicia reflects the Russian pronunciation
of Halicz:  Galich. The Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer refers to Galich
(under that spelling) as "an old Ruthenian settlement," located 13 miles
north of Stanislav/Stanislawow (nowadays called Ivano-Frankovsk; the
present Ukrainian authorities are unlikely to restore its original name).
Paul R. Magocsi, in his newly published Historical Atlas of East Central
Europe (Seattle:  University of Washington Press, 1993), lists the
following names for Galicia:

     Galicia (English)
     Galicja (Polish)
     Galizien (German)
     Halychyna (Ukrainian)

The Russian name is Galitsiya.

Incidentally, Magocsi (the leading academic specialist on the Ruthenians,
or Rus), also gives the following Polish name for the *ecclesiastical*
province of Galicia: Rus Halicka.
