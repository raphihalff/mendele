Subject: Vayter mit der mise-meshune

I have no new light to shed on the not-very-positive term
"mise-meshune" which was dealt with fairly thoroughly in
Mendele 2:14.  I write to corroborate the definitions sent
in by Nokhem Slobin, Peyrets Mett, Seymour Axelrod, and
Moshe Taube.  My father has always said of someone he
despises (in his modified SE Yiddish from Podolia by way of
Poland and the USSR): "Eh zuhl annemin uh meesuh mishinuh
["uh" here = schwa]!" (i.e. "Er zol aynnemin a
mise-meshune!")  Gloss: "He should die a horrible/violent
death!" or "He should meet a horrible/violent end!"

Although I always sensed the meaning from the context, for
a long time I never really understood the actual meaning of
the words in the expression until I formally undertook the
study of Yiddish and renewed my intensive study of Hebrew.
I had -perhaps as many others- the mistaken notion that
"mise" meant ugly as in "mies" (sp.mem/yod/alef/vov/samekh).

Of course there is the exact same expression in Hebrew from
which the Yiddish expression was derived (as per Modern
Hebrew): "mitah meshunah," gloss: "unnatural/abnormal/unusual/
violent death" from MITAH: "death" and  MESHUNEH: "strange."

Thank you, Peyrets Mett, for your interesting explanation
of the origin of the expression.  I have seen your book and
found it very intriguing.  It does deserve wider attention.
And yes, if ever there was a "mise-meshuneh" it was that
met by those spies!

Subject: Shmendrik

The Yiddish word shmendrik has to be from Polish -medrek-
(pronounced mendrek and spelled with a hook indicating
nasalization under the first -e-) meaning a 'wise guy,'
'wiseacre.' The Yiddish seems to illustrate the second half
of a sh-reduplication (e.g., the well-known 'money-
shmoney,' 'mink-shmink' pattern that has entered English).
I would suspect that the original must have been something
like 'mendrik-shmendrik,' which might indicate that the
Polish word, which is derived from the adjective -madry-
(pronounced /mondri/, again with a hook marking
nasalization under the -a-) 'wise' , originally meant a
wise person.

Subject: miese zachen !?

>>nuances.  Mies, I would guess is derived from
>>mem-aleph-samech, or mi-us, disgusting in Hebrew, as in
>>pasul m'hamas[t] mi-us.

To Yankele Matisoff:

Not only am I aware of your "Psycho-ostensives", I spent
some time last year trying to get two copies.  It took me
at least a month to find out at last that ISHI was out of
business.  The only thing I failed to do was ask you!  I
particularly wanted one o f the copies for my colleagues at
Universitaet Trier, where one of them was doing work on
such expressions in older literature.   Ultimately (I
confess) I xeroxed it.  But now I'd like to take advantage
of your offer to obtain two from you.  I'll call you in
Berkeley.

To Yankele Kessler:

Here is my version of your "buttered toast" motif:

Eyner fregt dem tseveytn:

--"Farvos falt dos broyt alemol mit der puter arop?"

--"Staytsh, vos heyst alemol mit der puter arop?  Amol falt
es mit der puter arop, amol mit der puter aroyf."

--"Neyn, dafke alemol mit der puter arop!"

--"Vos redste narishkeytn?  Na, ikh shmir on a shtik broyt
mit puter un ikh loz faln.  Zest?  Dos mol iz es gefaln mit
der puter aroyf."

--"Khokhem, eyner!  Du'st es ongeshmirt af der linker
zayt!"
