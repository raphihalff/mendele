Subject: A question for readers of Onkelos

Most of the stories in Howe and Greenberg's _A Treasury of Yiddish
Stories_ are again available in Yiddish.  Now we're getting ready for a
very important second phase.  Toward that end we need to know something
about your viewing habits.

Here's the question: do you read the stories on-line, or do you
download them to your computer for later viewing and/or printing?

Please write as soon as possible to mailto://nmiller@trincoll.edu.
Your cooperation means a lot for the success of Project Onkelos.

a dank,

Noyekh Miller

Subject: Yiddish teacher's listserve

Khaverim,

I am considering starting up a listserve for Yiddish teachers and
teachers in Yiddish schools to share material and ideas: curriculum,
music, dance, holidays, plays, etc.  Are there any of you who may be
interested in joining such a list?  I would be thrilled to hear from
you.

Mit frayndshaft,
Lorele Cahan-Simon

Subject: etymology

The first of Jan Katlev's turns of phrase (11.013) may well have
Yiddish origins, although not etymological; "Sauregurkenzeit" is "sour
pickle time".  Possibly as opposed to late summer, when one could
rejoice in half-sour rather than sour pickles - preferred in all
quarters?

"Hals- und Beinbruch" was, for the first German aviators, the
equivalent of "break a leg" for an actor - but rather more gory, "Break
your neck and your legs."  It's still used today by opera singers for
the same purpose.

Subject: Hals- und Beinbruch

Re:  "Hal- und Beinbruch" (11.013)

The suggested etymology, I believe, is from Yiddish/Hebrew "hatslokhe
uvrokhe" (literally, "success and blessing").  Further proof that
German is a corrupt dialect of Yiddish.  I wonder further if the
English "break a leg" derives from the German expression.

Subject: Sauregurkenzeit etymology

Dear Mendelyaners,

In Mendele 11.013, Jan Katlev mentions the Yiddish etymological
background of German idioms "Sauregurkenzeit" and "Hals- und
Beinbruch". Indeed, both terms go back to Yiddish roots, but
indirectly. Over here in Germany, the traditional secret vocabulary
('language' as it often is called)  of the criminals, the "Rotwelsch",
has a relatively high amount of Yiddish and Hebrew words. This has -
obviously - led to the wide-spread assumption that most of our
criminals are Jews (and, respectively, that most of our Jews are
criminals). The reason for this recruitment of words from Yiddish and
Hebrew (as well as, e.g., Romani), however, is simply that these words
are difficult to understand to out-siders. Rotwelsch was and is used in
order to be able to speak publicly about illegal issues. - This is
comparable to the signs criminals attach to houses in order to tell
their accomplices that the house is empty (i.e. safe) or not, or the
languages used on the horse-markets, making it possible to discuss the
price offered without the potential buyer understanding what is being
said. Possible English equivalents for Rotwelsch words might be "grass"
or "pot"  (well, at least in times in which ordinary people did not
know what was being spoken about).

But back to "Sauregurkenzeit" and "Hals- und Beinbruch". The former
goes back to an initial "Saurejurkenzeit", subsequently mistaken as a
Berlinism (j for g). Saure > tsores, jurken >yoker, zeit=tseyt. A
"Sauregurkenzeit", then, is a time of hard trouble (no opportunity to
be a successfull ganev). "Hals- und Beinbruch" goes back to "hazlokhe
brokhe", in a way a ganev's mazltow...

The field of pseudo-Yiddishisms in modern German is very interesting.
Quite often, you can find familiar Yiddish words with a perverted
meaning (one of the most obvious and unhealthy examples would be of
"mezuza" being used for a prostitute).

I would like to recommend Sigmund A. Wolf's "Deutsche Gaunersprache.
W?rterbuch des Rotwelschen" (Hamburg: Buske, 1985) and (obviously)
Salcia Landmann's "Jiddisch. Das Abenteuer einer Sprache" as, probably,
the best starting points for excursions into a criminal vocabulary.

(Sorry for not providing a Yiddish version.)

Best,
Peter Gutmann

Subject: a plea re new books

I'm sure I'm not the only subscriber to mendele who is responsible for
proposing Yiddish books for acquisition for a major library. We buy one
or more copies of everything in Yiddish, on Yiddish and translated from
Yiddish. It is a very welcome practice that authors take the trouble to
announce their books in mendele. In fact it would be highly desirable
if more authors and publishers would do likewise. However, to save
time-consuming correspondence could I enter a plea that when anyone is
anounces a new volume, she or he should give full bibliographical
information in the following format (to take a recent example):

Weinstein, Miriam, _Yiddish: A Nation of Words_, South Royalton, VT:
Steerforth, 2001, 303pp. [ISBN: 1-58642-027-5], $??.??.
