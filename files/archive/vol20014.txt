Subject: origins of Yiddish

I received this message from a Dutch historian during a discussion on the
origins of Polish Jewry:

East European Yiddish has no similarities with the Rhineland dialect. It
has similarities with Bavarian. Eckhard Eggers published an alternative
hypothesis, the so-called Bavarian-Czech hypothesis, which I think is the
best. It actually is a modification of the Danube hypothesis (Dovid Katz
and Bob King). It states that Yiddish originated from the Bavarian
speaking area, which includes also Bohemia and Bavaria, where Bavarian was
spoken as well. The oldest Slavic component in Yiddish is namely Old Czech
(which hardly differed from Old Polish). In my forthcoming book I have a
chapter on this issue. My conclusion is based on my demographic research
on she'elot utshuvot (responsa) from the early 17th century, and on the
information rabbi Ber Levinsohn provides. It appears that within Europe,
East European Jews do not originate from Germany, but from southern
Russia. I do not mean the Khazars. Jews were living in southern Russia
already before the beginning of the Common Era. They did not disappear, as
some historians are trying to make us believe (because they want them to
originate from Germany). These Jews were very much assimilated, and
married all kinds of people, which is clearly shown, among other things,
by the blond East European Jews with blue or grey eyes.

Any comments?

Subject: Dovid Hofshteyn's "Friling"

Our Yiddish literature discussion group at the Jewish Cultural Center in
Munich has been reading some of Dovid Hofshteyn's poetry.  We ran into a
problem with the last two lines of his poem "Friling" (1912):

alts gringer varft der kop zikh inderheykh un shnur farbrokhenem di
busheles tsu tseyln . . .

The  first line is not difficult to render in daytsh:  "Immer leichter
werft sich der Kopf in die Hoehe," but rather awkward in English,
something like: 'Ever easier to cast your head aloft'.  The real problem
is the second line, which seems to make no sense although the individual
words are not obscure.

Some of our thoughts:  shnur ="string" or daytsh "schnurstracks" "straight
and fast"? busheles = either "storks" or "bundels," "tufts." farbrokhenem
"broken," but what is broken? Hand wringing and criminal exploits don't
seem appropriate here.

But, I can't imagine casting my head aloft to count storks with a broken
string.  Other interpretations are equally difficult.

Suggestions would be appreciated.

Subject: gas

Al Grand asked about the etymology of Yiddish gas "street." I don't know
why he considers the Scandinavian words with a "t" unlikely; Germanic
non-initial t regularly corresponds with Yiddish and (high) German s, as
in "white"/ "vays," "great"/ "groys," etc. English "gate", which is
sometimes used in the sense of "street" in street names
("Highgate"), is an obvious cognate. There's no Yiddish etymological
dictionary, but for the German(ic) component, a good German etymological
dictionary, such as Kluge's, should be of use.

Leybl Goldberg

[Moderator's note: Dina Levias offers the following on the subject.]

Al Grand's query about the word "gas" (January 4, 2011 Subject: gas) has
been answered in the same posting by the "Moderator": i.e. its most
obvious origin is the German word Gasse, referring to a small, narrow
street.

The various Scandinavian "gate," "gade," "gata" are, to my mind, obvious
cognates.

And, to end on a humorous note: the Yiddish-speaking people arriving in
Paris from various East-European countries "yiddishized" many Parisian
street names; thus, la rue de Rivoli became "di Rivele gas"!

Subject: dozik

Regarding the query "dozik" by Mike Koplov:


It comes originally from the German demonstrative pronoun das or, rather,
dies (Yiddish dos)  plus the gender endings according to the declination -
dies, diese (dozike), dieser
(doziker etc.), dieses, diesem, diesen etc.

Subject: unidentified book

I have a book length Yiddish poem, 135 pp., with the title page missing
and need help identifying it. It begins:

A geviser ferd hot zikh amol batrakht, in mitn mitvokh shabes tsu nakht,
hot er a groysn bal gemakht, un hot hibshe etlekhe gest arop gibrakht:
tsum ershtin ershaynt, der hund zayn fraynd...

If memory serves me, I showed this to Prof. Shmeruk in the 1980s and he
said that the printing was done in Warsaw. I would guess the work to be
from the 1880s - 1900.

Subject: Chagall's Yiddish poetry

I am looking for a source (sources?) of Marc Chagall's Yiddish poetry. I
once had a copy of a Yiddish literary journal (monthly? quarterly?) that
included a poem of his written, I vaguely recall, on the ship which
brought him and his wife, Bella, to the U.S.

Is anybody familiar with the 512 page book by Zalmen Zylbercweig titled
"Yidisher kunst-teater in amerike"? I've seen the text but I don't know if
and when it was ever published. Can anyone give me more specifics?

Thank you.

Subject: Yiddish terms in need of translation

Sholem aleykhem!

I am translating a text from Yiddish to English and I find that many words
and expressions do not appear in the two dictionaries I have--Harkavy and
Weinreich--nor on the Yiddish-English translation sites that I have gone
to.

Is this a proper forum to ask the meaning of various words? Or can anyone
recommend a comprehensive dictionary or an appropriate forum?  The words I
am looking for are not especially exotic--e.g.,  mehl kleitl, angezetzt,
galeres, yarshever, sternove, harde, tzeplikte, etc.

Thank you!
