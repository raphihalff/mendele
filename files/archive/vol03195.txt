Subject: The Bashevis Singer Papers

On another list I saw a message from the Harry Ransom Research
Center at the University of Texas at Austin saying that Singer's
widow has donated (or sold) his mss, proofs, letters, etc. to that
Library.  I am delighted that a library of such excellence has the
care of these papers, and appalled that they did not wind up in NY.
Can anyone tell me why NYPL or Columbia or NYU did not get them?

(1) Regarding Mark H. David's question on access to the microfiche
edition of "Yiddish Children's Literature" (MENDELE 3.193),
unfortunately one must either view it in the few libraries that have
the set (Harvard, YIVO, possibly the Library of Congress, JNUL in
Jerusalem) or purchase it at a substantial price from the company
that markets it.  (At last account, that was the Congres- sional
Information Service, Inc., 4520 East-West Hwy., Suite 800, Bethesda,
MD 20705-4002, OR 11935 Beltsville Dr., Beltsville, MD 20705-4002
[Beltsville is doubtless named after the Bessarabian city Beltsy].)
Many of the 1,000+ books included in the set are no longer available
in hard copy, but some are, either through the Workmen's Circle (45
E. 33rd St., New York, NY 10016) or the National Yiddish Book Center
(48 Woodbridge St., South Hadley, MA 01075).  I do not know if
copies of the published catalogs to "Yiddish Children's Literature"
-- either the original Clearwater list or the Harvard catalog -- are
still available.  For the former, inquire at CIS; for the latter,
contact:  Judaica Dept., Widener Library M, Harvard College Library,
Cambridge, MA 02138.  In general, I would not recommend use of
microfilm or fiche "for parents... in order to preserve their
children's Yiddish" -- I think that both parents and children would
prefer the genuine article.  As a preservation-oriented librarian,
it pains me to say that there is no true substitute for the book
itself.

(2) Bob Rothstein asks about the Sholem Aleichem story, "Khanike in
der finfter evenyu" (MENDELE 3.192).  While I cannot readily verify
if the story ever appeared in any of S.A.'s books, it does indeed
appear in the Tageblatt on the dates indicated by Khone Shmeruk
(Dec. 2 & 3, 1907).  That newspaper is available on microfilm at New
York Public Library, YIVO, Hebrew Union College (Cincinnati), and
possibly elsewhere.

Subject: Di yiddishe Charleston

Not trusting my yiddish, I have been lurking on the list for some
time. Recently, however, I wrote someone about a yiddish question.
She asked me why I lurk, I should participate.

I have been interested in Yiddish jazz music for some time, but I
have so very little of it.  I have heard the Barry Sisters and the
Andrew Sisters, but they are more swing.  What I like the most is
piano music from the 20s.  The last place I came in contact with a
suprising sample of Yiddish jazz piano was in the 1980 film "Oingo
Boingo in the Forbidden Zone."  The writer, Richard Elfman, uncle to
the bands lead singer Danny, drew heavily from the genre for the
sound track.  It also included a version of di yiddishe Charleston.

What I would like to know is who are some Yiddish jazz artists whom
I could look up at the record store?  I have heard a man from New
York, who sang during the 20s (a song about Hoover's FBI), but that
sketchy information is all I remember.

Subject: Christian Translators from the Yiddish; Johan Saubert

Leonard (Yude-Leyb), Leonard.Prager@Haifauvm, writes:

	Churchmen were among the first to study Yiddish
systematically and may be regarded as the founders of Yiddish
philology.  They entertained the hope that Yiddish would be a key
both to the Jewish Scriptures and to Jewish hearts.  This hope
proved fanciful but in the course of nursing it, a few German
Christians like J.H. Callenberg made a real contribution to Yiddish
studies.  Callenberg had established an institute for missionary
activities at Halle in 1728 and published Yiddish translations of
the New Testament in parts from 1732 to 1744 {Rep: BL} (as well as
of other Christian writings).

*************************************************

	For more information about Christian Yiddish writers, and
particularly Johan Saubert, see my wife, Golda Werman's forthcoming
book, _Milton and Midrash_, Catholic University of America Press.

	Saubert (1638-1688) a German Lutheran minister and professor
of Hebrew, was an expert in Oriental languages and translated the
popular, contemporary folk Midrash, the _Ze'enah U-Reenah_, written
in Yiddish, into Latin.  Saubert made a special effort to acquire
the Yiddish Midrash from a rabbi friend.  Saubert informs us in the
Introduction that he undertook the translation out of a sense of
Christian duty; he considers it his responsibility to make this
Yiddish midrashic work available in Latin.

	In knowing Yiddish he was not at all unique among his fellow
Christian theologians.  Special Christian textbooks existed for the
teaching of Yiddish to theological students for missionary purposes
in the Protestant seminaries.  Saubert translated the Genesis
chapter of the _Ze'enah U-Reenah_ into Latin in 1660 when he was
only twenty-three; in the same year he was appointed professor of
Hebrew at the University of Helmstadt.

	More on the Yiddish of Christian translators and theologians
in the 16th and 17th century can be found in two fascinating
chapters in Golda's book.
