Subject: What to call a rabbi's husband?

A rebbetsin is the wife of a (male) rabbi.

Anyone know what we should call the spouse of a female rabbi?

This problem didn't exist during the peak usage of Yiddish, but how do Yiddish
speakers handle this now?

Subject: Yiddish bookshops in London (summary)

Last month I posted a question about where one can buy Yiddish books in
London, promising to give a summary of the personal replies I received, if
any.

Only two replies came, from Irwin Mayer and David Herskovic; my thanks to
both.

DH says: I live in London and have also been looking for a good Yidish
bookshop. The best one I've found to date is Sentinel Books in 80 Manor Road
London NW4 2EL. Tel. 0181-346 7430.  (He adds that this is for secular Yiddish
books, which he guessed, rightly, that I was mainly interested in, and
mentions that religious Chasidic books can be obtained from several orthodox
bookshops.)

IM doesn't know of such a book store but suggested contacting the Jewish Book
Quarterly at: jewish.books@ort.org

Once again, many thanks.  I will check out Sentinel Books, although I have a
feeling this is the one I looked for (having been given the address the
previous year) and it turned out to have moved, according to a sign on the
window.  I believe that was in Sentinel Square (?), a rather long walk up the
road from Golders Green.  I assume that Manor Road is the new address, so I'll
try again next time I can get to London!

Subject: Hasidic Yiddish

Based on what I have learned concerning my questions about Haredi Yiddish both
from the answers which have appeared on Mendele and from private
communications from several people with an insider's view, it is indeed clear
that Yiddish is not at all a dying language. My colleague, Michael Krauss,
here in Fairbanks, who is an authority on the statistics of language
endangerment and death, estimates that of the world's approximately 6,000
languages, based on the rate of decline (or increase) of the numbers of child
speakers in the recent past, only 5 to 10 percent are "safe", meaning that
children will probably still be learning them as their first language at the
end of the coming century. On this basis Yiddish is among the tiny minority,
300 to 600, of safe languages in the world. This, despite the fact that
Yiddish is often given as a prime example of a dying language, that the use of
Yiddish among the non-Hasidic religious and in the less-religious and secular
sector (along with its journalistic, literary and theatrical tradition) has
certainly declined drastically, and also the fact that the sheer number of
speakers has probably dropped more sharply in the last 75 or 100 years for
Yiddish than for any other language.

From one of the people who wrote to me from inside the Hasidic community I
obtained a recently published Yiddish novel, "Geknipt un Gebindn" by Khaye
Rosenburg in Jerusalem. Unlike some other recent Yiddish fiction publications
this book seems not to have been subsidized by a committee to see it
published; rather, the publisher apparently felt that he could make a profit
from selling the book. It is published -- without ISBN or Library of Congress
number -- by a Hasidic (I guess) publishing house (Mekur Khaim) which states
in the book that the book has been approved as fit for Torah Jews to read, and
there are a number of attestations from rabbis to this effect. Though it
certainly isn't Sholem Aleichem or Bashevis, the book is captivating enough
that I kept reading page after page. It seems to be a continuation of the old
"morally uplifting instructive Yiddish literature for women" theme, which was
the precursor of the modern Yiddish literary classics. What's most interesting
to me is that this and similar books exist at all. I've never seen such books
offered for sale by any of the places one usually buys Yiddish books, and, had
I not received it from someone inside the Hasidic community I would not have
known about it at all.  The very existence of such books testifies to the
continued vitality of the language in Hasidic circles.

One thing that puzzles me is that in this book, and also in the
Hasidic-oriented Yiddish newspapers that I've seen, there are a lot more
daytshmerisms than in other Yiddish. For example: shikzal (fate), heykel
(ticklish, delicate), shtunde (hour), monat (month) nahrhaftig (nourishing),
etc. Some of these are words marked as treyf in Weinreich's dictionary but
some aren't in any Yiddish dictionary (that I know of), and I could find them
only in a German dictionary. Can anyone explain why so many such daytshmerisms
are used in Hasidic Yiddish? After all, Hasidic circles wouldn't have shared
the late 19th and early 20th century attraction to German culture experienced
in secular Yiddish circles, which produced the phenomenon of daytshmerisms now
so hotly debated among certain Yiddish scholars.

Subject: Ober = Or ?

David Sherman's comments re the use of 'ober' for 'or' and subsequent con-
fusions when young were interesting.  I wonder if in fact his in-laws had
acquired the very same confusion when they were young.  Don't we find this in
many instances, where a gramatically incorrect usage eventually becomes an
accepted use?  I spoke mameloshen and Polish before I spoke English tho' I was
born in Toronto.  My Dad was a Galicianer and Mom was a Drilger, so I did have
a diverse set of linguistic examples as far as relatives were concerned.  But
I also attended Yeshiva Torah Chaim Talmud Torah (the late great Rabbi Price's
Yeshiva) and we were taught "correct" Yiddish.  When I sort of close my eyes
and clear my mind, and think about 'ober' and 'oder', all aspects of my
Yiddish learning fall on the side of 'ober' *not* being used for 'or'.  But if
I heard someone using it instead of 'oder', I would certainly have no problems
understanding what was actually meant, given the context.

Subject: Diminutives

Does anyone know of instances where the diminiutive suffix -ele- is used to
feminize a male? For example, referring to a male secretary named Moishe as
"Moishele" in order to give a perjorative, decidedly feminine, slant. Any help
would be appreciated.

Subject: Pluperfect?

In today's Forverts (16 Feb 96) a  piece about the engineer who died in the
collision of his train in New Jersey a week ago carries the headline,
"mashinist fun gekrakhter ban is gehat adurkhgeforn roite signaln," meaning
that he had run red signals in earlier years, not necessarily on this
occasion.  The verb in this headline -- "iz gehat adurkhgeforn" -- is in the
pluperfect, isn't it?  The form is new to me.
