Subject: shvarkes

I have heard similar expressions used sarcastically.  For instance, when a
child wouldn't eat his regular meal, mother would say: "nu, to vos vilstu,
martsipanes? Bald vel ikh dir makhn taybelekh mit shkvarkes! Es, zog ikh
dir!" Shkvarkes is the same as gribenes.  There are many similar recipes.

Subject: shvarkes

Concerning the inquiry about "shvarkes":  first, the word is shkvarkes. It
refers to fat goose skin fried to crispiness, a delicatessen side dish
(with a lot of calories and cholesterol) to meat dishes. Shkvarkes comes
from Russian shkvarki.  In New York, on the Lower East Side, a maven
translated it as cracklings.

Subject: nant

I think that might be what is called "nunt" (or almost "nu-int")in
Tsentral-yidish, which is a kind of candy made of honey and nuts.  In
Yiddish, it would be spelled nun komets-alef nun tes.  (Hence the
questioner's having spelled it "nant").

A recipe for this confection can be found at
http://www.recipezaar.com/109332, although I recall it having been made
with coarsely chopped, rather than finely chopped walnuts.  I only had it
once or twice, at the home of some Bobover khsidim.  I remember the host
remarking as a play on words that "nunt" symbolizes that we are "closer" to
God on Purim.  Nunt (nont in Standard Yiddish) means "close."

Subject:  nant and other foods

Concerning Bob Rothstein's inquiries about foods on behalf of Monika
Adamczyk-Garbowska:

1. valakhes (berries - perhaps blueberries or wild cranberries)

I haven't seen this, but I wonder if it has anything to do with a
preparation that might have been rolled.

2. nant (an item in the basket next to chickpeas and pumpkin seeds)

I bring to mind hearing the sound "nahit" with reference to chickpeas.

3. poplinkes (children taking freshly baked ones to kheyder).

I have seen this before in the same context, but do not know its origin. I
took it to mean some sort of a baked confection that the children could eat
as a snack, maybe something akin to an Italian "zeppole."

Subject: nant, poplinkes and valakhes

My guess would be that poplinkes are kind of bread, plural for poplinik
(paplonik); and valakhes must be voloshkes, the cornflowers. Nant doesn't
ring a bell.

Subject: nant, poplinkes and valakhes

Concerning Bob Rothstein's query (on behalf of Monika
Adamczyk-Garbowska)[16.014:6], I'm afraid to say that I'm equally stumped
by "valakhes" and "poplinkes." However, for "nant" a solution is readily to
be found in Yitskhok Niborski's Dictionnaire Yiddish-Francais (2002) where
"nont" is recorded as a variant of "nontl," whose meaning is given as
"confiserie  base de miel avec des noix ou des graines de pavot" which fits
the context admirably. I might add that no serious Yiddishist can afford to
be without this invaluable work when seeking recondite Yiddish lexical
items. With its 37,000 lemmata, it is by far the most comprehensive Yiddish
dictionary in existence so far. Of course, the absence of "valakhes" and
"poplinkes" is evidence (as if it were needed!) that something even more
exhaustive is still required. Fortunately, it is rumored that Simon
Neuberg, who collaborated with Niborski on the DY-F, is at work on a
Jiddisch-Deutsches Woerterbuch that promises to be yet larger.

Subject: yizker-bikher translations

[Moderator:  regarding Monika Adamczyk-Garbowska's translations of two
Bilgoraj yizker-bikher.]

Folks,

It is a singular delight to see that a scholar has, perhaps indirectly,
received some support to undertake a translation of Yizker books into
English. Long time readers will know of my avowed concern that the precious
history found in this substantial archive (1273 total volumes, of which 432
are in Yiddish) not be consigned to oblivion behind a language barrier, as
facility with Yiddish continues to fade among the general Jewish populace.

Accordingly, it is -- to me -- of paramount importance, to learn how this
specific task was accomplished, and whether some general lesson can be
learned about how to propagate this experience into a more broadly based
initiative.

It also strikes me that we need a clearing house for such undertakings.
Having completed six of these translations myself, to date, I am now deep
into my seventh, which is Tomaszow-Lubelski. I note that Bilgoraj is on my
"punch list," but a lesser priority. It would have been a shame to squander
the limited talent that could be applied to this task, if a needless
duplication of effort had taken place simply out of an ignorance of one
another's activities.

Can someone who knows about this instance brief the readership?

Regards,
Jack Berger
