Subject: Yofes?

 
Mendele in general is somewhat above me, but at least your
 
      Bay Noyekhn in der Teyve, a Khumesh-shpil
 
was something even I could enjoy.
 
I have two questions.  Why do you  call the third son Yofes
instead of Yefes? In  the "Khumesh" it  is basically with
two  segols.  Sometimes the yod is with a qamatz, but  this
is the frequently used change to a qamatz at the end of a
passage (I  do not know the posh words for this type of
change :-( ).
 
If it is a "Khumesh-shpil" why does it go against the
Khumesh story in which Yefes was was one of the good guys
and only Kham was naughty?

Subject: RE: Emet/emes

Berl, in explaining the origin of 'emet' writes:

The historical root of emet was aleph-mem-nun, the same as
in amen, and the -t is a suffix, so the word was
underlyingly something like *'emen-t.

However, in very early Hebrew, before the Biblical spelling
was fixed, the n-t sequence in *ement assimilated to t-t,
then just -t, before it had a chance to get split by an
epenthetic vowel as in shamEnet. --

If so, why does the final 't' not take a dagesh?  I suppose
there is some additional rule governing that.

Meylekh.
