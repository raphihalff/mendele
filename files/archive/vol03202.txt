Subject: Grade vs. Singer

My Yiddish teacher gets very passionate about the fact that I.B.
Singer re- ceived the Nobel Prize rather than Chaim Grade.  She
argues that Grade was a far superior author to Singer and that
Singer received the Nobel Prize for political reasons.  She also
suggests that Singer catered to a more general audience than Grade.
What do you make of her argument?  I'm not sure what to think
because I don't know enough about either author.  I have to admit
that Grade's work appeals to me more than Singer's.

Subject: introduction; re: query by K.Weiser

I have been receiving Mendele for a couple of months and I think
it's time to introduce myself:

My name is Holger Nath and I am  a Ph.D. candidate at Columbia U.  I
am currently working on my thesis which deals with the
standardization of Yiddish in the Soviet Union between the two World
Wars.  I intend to compare the planning of Soviet Yiddish with its
co-territorial languages, Ukrainian and Belorussian.

I am generally interested in language contact (in particular with
Slavic languages) and in language revival, especially of Yiddish and
Catalan.

re: Kalmen Weiser's query:

I am not familiar with Western publications, but I came across some
Soviet books/articles/references during my research.  Some, if not
all of them should be found at YIVO, the New York Public Library,
Columbia, or Harvard:

Ukrainishe Visnshaft Akademye.  (1935).  Matematishe terminologye.
Rusish-ukrainishe-yidishe, mit a yidishn indeks.  Kiev-Kharkov:
Ukrmelukhenatsmindfarlag

Vaysrusishe Vinshaft-Akademye.  institut far yidisher proletarisher
kultur.  (1926).  Yidishe terminologye, num. 2: Matematishe
terminologye. proyekt.  Minsk: Institut far vaysruslendisher kultur.

Zaretski, A. (1920). "Yidishe elementar matematishe terminologye"
Kultur un Bildung 25-26: 29-38.

Zaretski, A. (1923). Treminologisher [sic!] materyal: [Review] M.
Zabludovski. Aritmetike: praktisher kurs far dervaksene: ershter
bukh. Byalistok. In Yidish (Kharkov) 1: 23

Zaretski, A. (1923). "Yidishe elementare geometrishe terminologye"
In Yidish (Kharkov) 1: 15-19.

I also remember a reference to a math-textbook at Harvard,
translated, I believe, by Zaretski.  I'll look it up when I get a
chance to go to Widener next week.

Subject: Re: Learning Yiddish

"College Yiddish" is the best we've got, for students who are
comfortable with grammatical terminology. Unfortunately that's a
problem for many people, especially if they're trying to use it
without a teacher.

Other possibilities:

1) "Learning Yiddish in easy Stages" has already been mentioned.

2) "Der yidisher lerer" by H. E. Goldin, 1939. Still pretty readily
available.

3) "Yiddish for Beginners" by Jean Joffen, revised edition 1982.

4) Yudel Mark once put out a nice tape+booklet combination called
   "Invitation to Yiddish", if I remember correctly. If this is
   still available somewhere, I'd like to hear about it: my copy of
   the booklet has disappeared, and I'd like to buy another one!

I also am in interested in hearing the status of Sheva Zucker's long
awaited new book, which Pierre Lewis has mentioned.  Perhaps Mottel
Lakin could ask her, and report back to us?

To Pierre P. Lewis:

  Yes, the National Yiddish Book Center still exists! I don't know why you
have had no answer to your two letters. The address is indeed 48 Woodbridge
St., South Hadley, MA 01075.
