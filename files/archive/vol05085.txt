Subject: Introduction

Andy Cassel introduced me to Mendele last week.  My parents left
Lithuania in 1939. I was born in 1943 and Yiddish was my mameloshn. I am
an orthopaedic surgeon in the Los Angeles area.  I have a (Jewish)
humanitarian project in Lithuania and just returned from my sixth visit.
I may be of help to those with an interest in Lithuania.

Subject: Introduction

Allow me to introduce myself. I am a retired professor of Information
Systems and Statistics, residing in California. I was born in France and
spoke Yiddish at home until the age of six.  When I moved to Israel after
the war, I learned Hebrew and a modicum of Arabic as well. (In those
days, for obvious reasons, the use of Yiddish was discouraged. Questions
asked in that language were usually answered in Hebrew.) After so many
years of neglect, my Yiddish is fragmentary at best. As a result, my
participation in Mendele will clearly be by way of questions.

Subject: Feldshers in Konin, Poland

While the shames was away, I was leafing through a newly published book,
"Konin, a Quest," by a British Jewish writer, Theo Richmond, who
interviewed many of his parents' landslayt from the Polish shtetl of
Konin.  He also revisited the shtetl itself, as part of his research --
and studied Yiddish at Oxford, in order to be able to read the Konin
memorial book.  Anyway, on pages 192-195 there is a description of the
town feldsher.  Here are excerpts:

"Most ordinary folk in need of medical help for the less serious
illnesses and minor surgery summoned not the doctor but the feldsher,
descendant of the medieval barber-surgeon, whose presence in Konin long
preceded that of the doctor.  He was a sort of para- medic, or what the
Chinese would call a bare-foot doctor.  People trusted the feldsher's
practical experience.

"The census of 1765 lists two Jews as having the occupation of feldsher.
The first to be mentioned by name lived in much more recent times.  Chaim
Warmbadt specialized in treating children. His expertise included
'tearing teeth,' to use the almost too graphic Yiddish phrase, a service
he performed in his barbershop opposite the Catholic church....

"There was a woman feldsher too, reputed to be good at resetting
children's dislocated bones, but the feldsher most surviving Koniners
remember was Warmbadt's son-in-law and heir to the business, Jacob
Strykowski.  He began to practice before the First World War and remained
active until the 1930s, running his barber shop as well as working as a
paramedic.  With a diploma that entitled him to write prescriptions,
Strykowski was no ordinary feldsher.  His bone-setting skills were said
to be better than any doctor's.  (He also happened to be my paternal
grandfather's land- lord.)

"Strykowsky's range of treatments included cupping, much favored for such
maladies as fever, asthma, bronchitis, and rheumatism.  The cupping
glass, shaped like a round eyecup, was called a banke in Yiddish.  The
feldsher would put a drop of methylated spirits in the glass, ignite it
to induce a vacuum, and swiftly clap it onto the required part of the
body, most frequently the back.  The patient could end up with bankes all
over his or her back, sucking away for ten minutes or more to draw blood
to the surface of the skin.  This was said to relieve deep-seated
congestion.  Some thought it helped to draw impurities from the body....
Bankes have given rise to an expressive Yiddish saying, used to describe
an action that has proved totally futile.  'S'hot geholfn vi a toytn
bankes'-- It helped as much as bankes help a corpse.

"The Oxford Companion to Medicine confirms that cupping 'is now
obsolete,' which was my impression too, until one day in 1992 when I went
to a young physical therapist in London for treatment of a bad back.  To
my amazement, he suggested cupping, which he said he used to great effect
on some of Britain's top rugby players.  How could I refuse a treatment
known to so many of my Konin forebears? As I lay on my stomach, I felt
the bankes sucking gently at my skin -- not an unpleasant sensation --
and heard the pop when each glass was removed.  It didn't do much for my
back....

"The feldsher's other favorite form of treatment, also long recorded in
the history of medicine, was bloodletting by piavkes (Polish for
leeches)....  Izzy Hahn remembers his grandfather applying leeches to a
rheumatic leg.  'They sucked for perhaps twenty minutes, and when they
had drunk enough blood, they dropped off.'

"There was another treatment that the feldsher administered in people's
homes, always with the chamber pot or commode at the ready: the enema.
Strykowski probably used a rubber appliance for this purpose, a
technological advance on the equipment used in the previous century,
which my mother could recall from her childhood. Here, too, her memory
found its way into a novel:

     "Life was full of sinister, unmentionable figures who lurked, thrust
     out of sight, in the back of Leah's mind:  like the enema woman her
     grandmother talked of sometimes, from her village.  The gross,
     red-handed enema woman with her goose- quill and her sheep's
     bladder, who came to deal with those over whose over-charged systems
     needed clearing." [The reference is to a novel by the author's wife,
     Lee Langley, "From the Broken Tree" (New York, 1978), p. 55.]

"Konin, a Quest," by Theo Richmond, was published in 1995 by Pantheon
Books.  Its list price is $27.50 ($38.50 in Canada).
