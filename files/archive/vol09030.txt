Subject: "Akht Teg Pesach"

The article about Isaac Bashevis Singer was very interesting. A number of 
years ago Singer came to the Twin Cities to give a lecture. I had the 
opportunity to speak to him. I told him that although I enjoyed his books in 
English, I longed to read him in Yiddish. He suggested that I subscribe to 
the Forverts. And I did. I read  some serialized novels. The last story was 
called "Akht Teg Pesach" (Eight Days of Passover) The setting was historical 
and the hero was a young rabbi, in trouble with his congregation. On  the 
night of the first seder somebody leaves a dead child on his  doorstep and 
the rabbi is charged with the murder.  He is arrested and tortured. Then the 
story breaks off. The newspaper announces that the story will be finished 
later.  A year or two later  the author died. So  I wonder, did he finish the 
story?  Your article suggests that We will never know.

Subject: quote by Sholom Aleichem

Allan Dershowitz in his book "Vanishing American Jew" has a quote by Sholom
Aleichem.  The line (in Dershowitz's book) goes "If one is unemployed, he is
free to knock his head against the wall", and apparently comes out of a
larger piece called "Free". 

Does anyone know the origin of this?

Subject: duln a spodek

in Mendele Vol. 09.027 Jason Payne asks about the origin of "dulen a
spodek" [sic]

The dictionary gives:
spodek/spodik der - high fur cap [Pol. saucer]
a ... dreyen: bother, annoy

In Sh. A's "Motl" I found: "duln a spodek un dreyen a moyekh"

One would expect: "dreyen a spodek un duln a moyekh", which is, wherever
and whenever it originated, quite graphic. I imagine it means something
like: he stood their fumbling his hat and drove me nuts. The changing
place of the two verbs would be for comic effect. My guess.

Subject: A Sukele?

Tayre Mendelyaner,

A friend forwards this description, by Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, of the song "A
Sukele":

  "One of my favorite Yiddish songs, which I sing during every sukah meal,
  is called A Sukele. It tells the story of a young girl who warns her
  father that the winds are heavy and the sukele is about to collapse.
  'Don't be foolish and don't be upset,' the father responds. 'There have
  been almost 2,000 years of ominous winds, and our sukele has managed to
  prevail.'" 

I know nothing of this song, nor how to find it.  Can any Mendelyaner
help?  A dank in faroys.
