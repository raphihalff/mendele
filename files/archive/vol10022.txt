Subject: Rochel Boimvol

Rochel Boimvol, well knownYiddish poetess, passed away at the age of 86 in
Jerusalem, on Friday June 16.  Burial services took place on the following
Sunday with appropriate memorial tributes in Yiddish, and readings from her
poems, rendered by Profs Gershon Winer, Dov Noy, Dr. Heszel Klepfisz and Eli
Baider.  Boimvol was among the first of the Soviet Yiddish writers allowed
to leave Russia, arriving in Israel in 1971, together with her husband, the
Yiddish poet Zjame Telesin who passed away a few years ago at the age of 89.
She was among the last survivors of the distinguished group of Yiddish
writers from the Soviet Union -- about two dozen of them-- who came to
Israel in the 1970's, which led to a revival of Yiddish literary creativity
in Israel.  Her literary harvest is gathered in about twenty collections of
verse and children's literature, equally divided between the Soviet period
in her life and Israel.  Her poems are characterized by their
comprehensibility, playfulness and  delightful poignancy. Everything within
sight and experience, be it ever so ordinary and common --  tree, bird,
weather, neighbor, child, mother, son, -- is seen and felt through the
poetic perspective, evoking  a refreshing and often thoughtful response in
the  reader. The fate of the  martyred Russian Yiddish writers, 0the message
of Yiddish in Israel, the pangs and above all, the joys of adaptation to and
adoption in the new homeland, are impressively conveyed in her verse
produced in Israel. During her Russian period, Boimwol also attained wide
recognition as an author in Russian--largely of children's literature, with
some of her books published in the tens of thousands.

Subject: Israel Independence Proclamation

The Foundation for the Advancement of Yiddish Studies, which is conducting
its eleventh annual summer Seminar for Yiddish and Yiddishkeit in Eastern
Europe, would appreciate assistance in locating an authentic Yiddish
translation of Megillat Atzmaut -- the Israel Independence Proclamation --
of 1948.

A Yiddish rendition of the historic document is not available at the Jewish
Agency nor at the Zionist Archives in Jerusalem.  The Proclamation is
urgently needed for a course on Israel and Zionism to be given at our Kiev
Seminar beginning July 25. Appropriate credit will be recorded in our
textbook.

Subject: "oyb men vil fleysh.."

For me, when the teacher said "a ku git nor milkh; oby men vil fleysh muz
men es derhargenen..." quite simply says to his students..."English is
treyf...don't ask me to express myself in a treyf manner."  Our tradition is
you don't mix meat and milk. To push the analogy a bit more... we call
Yiddish "Mamme Loshn"...the first nurture we get is mother's milk....and the
first words of love we hear are in Yiddish. Yiddish comes with mother's
milk.  "Oyb men vil fleysh"  changes the total nature of the exercise
because we have slaughtered the essense...the  "source" goodness of what the
cow gives.  Mixing meat and milk is  unkosher. So why should a teacher of
Yiddish do something "unkosher?"

Subject: Yiddish in the camps

Miriam Isaacs wrote (Mendele 10.021)

     To Miriam Weinstein's question (Mendele 10.20), yes, Yiddish was the
     Jewish lingua franca and because German is so close there was a whole
     lingo and use of the Semitic component so that the enemy would not
     understand. There is a lexicon of these code words that was published.

The lexicon mentioned is:

     Isroel Kaplan
     dos folksmoyl in nazi klem
     (Jewish Folk Expressions Under the Nazi Yoke)
     Tel Aviv 1982

The other dictionary of the time is:

     Nachman Blumental
     verter un vertlekh fun der khurbn tkufe

But the first one concentrates on the use of loshn-koydesh as "code",
unintelligible to the Germans.

Subject: lovitch

My father from Skierniewice (Lodz/Warsaw) used the expression.  I am sure
that the reference is to the cemetery at Lowicz nearby which was established
before the local one.

Subject: Help with some idioms

My father was fond of two idioms:

1. so klug vi Roch's perd - He is'nt as smart as he thinks he is.
2. Toitele's business - a dead loss deal.

Were these references to real or mytical persons Roch and Toitele? And were
they of purely local (Lodz/Warsaw ) or general use?

Some were not so nice:

eg  oysgerisen from khazer a hur - plucking a hair from a pig.
It does little good but at least he is discomforted.

Subject: "shikt arayn a boyer"

The version I've heard begins < shikt der her a poyer in vald arayn er zol
di epl raysn... der poyer vil nit epl raysn un di epl viln nit faln, di epl
viln nit faln>  The lord sends (his) peasant into the woods to pick apples,
the peasant doesn't want to pick and the apples don't want to fall.  The
song continues pretty much as in khad gadyo:  a dog is sent to bight the
peasant, a stick is sent to beat the dog, a fire to burn the stick  etc.
until the (L)lord (?)  (H)himself goes to the woods and all falls into
place.  Also sung  at end of seder.

Now, since my Jewish roots are from Vilna and those of  the singers from
Warsaw, I may have gotten it all wrong.

Subject: shmir dir oys di shikh

i recently heard, in reply to "a sheynem dank", an expression that sounded
something like "shmir dir oys di shikh". my informant could not give the
exact wording of the expression, but explained that it was a mildly
deprecating reply - similar to "it's nothing" . perhaps someone can give
further information about the expression?
