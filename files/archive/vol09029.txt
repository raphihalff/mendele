Subject: "Pious Voices: Languages Among Ultra-orthodox Jews"

Announcing the publication of "Pious Voices: Languages Among Ultra-orthodox
Jews", a focus issue - Vol 3, #138 of the International Journal of the
Sociology of Language, issue editors -Miriam Isaacs and Lewis Glinert. This
volume contains a series of articles that address issues of language and
identity among haredim. The articles and book reviews offer an in-depth
understanding of the dynamics of language, religion and group identity for
this population in contemporary settings in enclaves in Israel, America and
Great Britain.  Because of the rate at which this population is developing,
this volume is essential in understanding trends in modern Judaism and
modern Israel, in heritage languages, and in the relationships between
language and religion.

Subject: Homentashn

Italian Jews have a Purim pastry called orecchi di Haman 'Haman's ears' (I
might have spelled the Italian wrong). There is a description of this I
think in Claudia Roden's recent cookbook or in Joan Nathan's.  They are
not at all like Ashkenazi homentashn, and they're shaped a bit like ears. 
Possibly the Italian name, translated into Hebrew as ozney haman, was
arbitrarily assigned to the Ashkenazi poppy or prune pocket.  Who knows
when?  Even Shoshan's "Middle Ages" category is very broad and vague, but
you could find early attestations in the big Ben Yehuda dictionary.  So
where did American Jews get the idea it was Haman's hat?  Just from George
Washington's three-cornered model?

Subject: yivnikah

I'm editing a manuscript and it includes what is described as a
"Yiddish-sounding word" "yivnikah".  Said to mean "frozen horse droppings,"
pluralized in English as "yivnikahs," ascribed to native speaker of Yiddish. 
Can your readers supply (by email) any information on this word?

Subject: Yoshe Kalb - I.J.Singer

I wonder if any member of Mendele could help me with the following:

Some time ago the cable company here in Jerusalem screened a film, by a
company called Yiddishshpiel, which was simply a recording of the stage play
"Yoshe Kalb" by I.J.Singer, without any mention of the actors or director
involved. 

As I had recorded the film on timer, and (as happens so often in this
country) the film overran the time allotted and I had not allowed for any
extra time, I missed the last few minutes of the film. 

The part I got up to was the climactic scene where Yoshe has to answer
before the Bet Din how can he reconcile the fact that he had apparently
married a second wife when his first wife was still alive, as an aguna.  The
last thing I saw was where he admitted he had no explanation. 

Could anyone please fill me in with the ending? 

Many thanks,
Sinai Rome

Subject: Romanized spelling 

There is another reason to use Romanized spelling rather than di Alef-Beys
-- I, for one, am such a novice at the computer that I feel fortunate to be
able to read and send email at all! I would need a patient teacher to train
me to get more complicated than that! 

By the way, in my last trip to Jerusalem, May '99, I witnessed lots of
Yiddish being spoken, in the Romema area, not just Mea Shearim, and among
little kids -- some were hasidic in appearance, others modern orthodox.

Subject: Shrouds/takhrikhim; hiletse

In story by Blume Lempl, a woman -- born in Poland in this century and
living after the war in the U.S. -- sews herself a shroud (takhrikhim).  It
has long sleeves and a high collar, "farendikt mit a shliarkele, vi s'past
far a tsedeykes." 

Does anyone know what style is customary for a pious woman's shroud?  Would
the COLLAR be ruffled ("farendikt mit a shliarkele"), or would the shroud
itself, i.e., the hemline, be ruffled? 

Also, the woman reflects on "di shmole hiletse" where she grew up.  What is
"hiletse"? 

Thank you for your help.
