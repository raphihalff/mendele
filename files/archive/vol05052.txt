Subject: Rabenu Tam

Does anyone have the words to Rabenu Tam by Itzik Manger?

It's a fantastic tale of how Rabenu Tam had an adventurous affair with
the daughgter of the Sultan. Something like that.

My dad used to sing it to me, but now he claims to have forgotten the
words...

Subject: Origins of Yiddish

There has been some discussion on Mendele of Paul Wexler's theories on
the origins of Yiddish, but I don't recall any examination of the
challenge to "Weinreichian orthodoxy" posed by Dovid Katz.  (I just
happen to have read his 1985 paper, "Hebrew, Aramaic and the Rise of
Yiddish," [in Joshua A. Fishman, ed., _Readings in the Sociology of
Jewish Languages_] and am innocent of any knowledge of most more recent
literature on the subject.)

In his 1985 paper Katz concludes that "...Yiddish arose some thousand
years ago when Aramaic speaking Jews settled in German speaking areas
east of the Rhineland, and the remnants of their vanishing language fused
with the local coterritorial dialects..." (100).

Max Weinreich, on the other hand, argues (in the English version of his
_History of the Yiddish Language_) that "Yiddish came into existence in
Loter [roughly, the Rhineland] because [speakers of] "western Loez and
southern Loez" [the Jewish correlates of Old French and Old Italian]...,
with Hebrew as their mediated [written, not spoken] language, created a
small gathering of exiles in an area where the coterritorial non-Jewish
population spoke different variants of German" (347).

Thus the first Yiddish-speakers were Aramaic-speaking Jews living east of
the Rhineland or Romance-speaking Jews with a knowledge of written Hebrew
living in the Rhineland (or neither of the above).  I suspect that I am
not the only reader of Mendele who would be interested in the comments of
those who know something about these matters, albeit most would probably
prefer relatively non-technical comments.

Subject: Children's books

I had meant to reply to several things I've seen recently much sooner than
this.

1. Bono Wiener's loss is a great one. He would travel frequently and
would act as the Shaliach for the Bundist and Yiddish movements. Whenever
Koala Farlag (See Zachary Baker's recent post) would publish a new book,
he would deliver it to us, Russia, Montreal and Europe. I was greatly
saddened to hear of his passing.

2. I had planned to mention the I. L. Peretz school and Bialik High
School. I see that my friend Anna Gonsher beat me to it. They are the
largest purchaser of Workmen's Circle Yiddish children's book in the
world. The only other school that comes close is the Sholom Aleichem Day
school in Australia. I have heard rumor that Argentina and Mexico have
Yiddish day schools. We have little contact with them. Fishl Kutner had
made some contact with Mexico. They do not use WC books. I've seen some
samples of older children's that they use in school in Argentina.
Shoshana Wolkowicz (oykh a mendelnik) brought them to me. Perhaps she can
be prevailed upon to answer.

3. I'm going to try to answer the various postings on kid's books in the
order they were made.

a. The Workmen's Circle continues to publish the Yiddishe Kinder series.
We have three books in the series and as Harvey Spiro has pointed out,
little has changed. I suspect that if Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan were to
compare it to when she used it, she would also find few changes.

b. Harvey Spiro mentions Dr. Seuss. That actually is not an impossibilty.
The trick is to make a deal with the publishing house. What many
publishers do is use the same color plates and drop in the text in the
language of choice as they are printing. Would it be possible to do this
with Yiddish? I don't know. At a guess, it would cost $15,000 to do it.
It would require donations.

c. Marcia Gruss-Levinsohn has an excellent book for kid's that uses
Yiddish, English and Yiddish in tranliteration. It has an excellent cover
and art work throughout. She can tell you more about it.

d. Koala Farlag has published several books. The first two are
out-of-print. We stock the book at the Workmen's Circle. It can also be
ordered by mail.

e. David Sherman's suggestion of Boro Park is a good one. While we stock
all of the "Secular" Yiddish children's books we do not always carry
those with a greater religious content. When I can, I try to sell these
books in the store. Some are more saleable than others. A good example of
a recently published title that fits this mold is "Ver iz Der Shtarker"
It was published by the Bet Chana Girls School in Boro Park. The book
strong points are the fact that it uses full color thoughout and has a
fairly modern look. Its weak points are its poor Yiddish and the fact
that it is so infused with Chassidic culture. Don't take the above as
being critical of Chassidic culture. What I mean is that when I try to
sell it to the larger Jewish world, it sells more slowly.  Does that mean
that if it were less so I could sell more? I don't know. Maybe a few. If
a school like I.L. Peretz were to adopt it, yes. I'm sure it does well in
the market for which it was intended. At one point Lubavitch published a
book of stories in Yiddish and a matching volume in English. We have also
recently received two books of stories for older children by Kipnis. In
the Boston area, consider trying the Israel Book shop. They have a large
section of kid's book in Yiddish. They are primarily intended for the
religious market. I like them.

f. Shuli Burger posted something about Monopoly in Yiddish. I was
intrigued and made a point of visiting Eichler's. They have it. The
problem (or blessing. I guess it depends on your point of view and
education) is that many of the things you are trying to buy will be
unfamiliar to most people that have not been raised in a Chassidic home.

4. The Jewish Book Center of the Workmen's Circle is currently preparing
its Fall catalogue. If anyone would like to suggest any titles to be
included in the catalogue, please let me know. While I can't promise that
they will be included, I will certainly seriously consider all
suggestions.

5. Plans are currently under way for Mameloshn '96. If anyone can suggest
a place that can comfortably hold 400 people at a reasonable price and
that is convenient to Boston and New York, please let me know.
