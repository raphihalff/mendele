Subject: shaygets, etc.

What a lovely storm has been brewed out of all this!  Next
we need references to Joseph's coat, etc.

Perhaps because Jews have historically been able to
acknowledge their ambivalence and, to that extent, deal
with it, they have  been able to maintain their identity
for over 2000 years.

As to Jewish walks: whoever said this, I was then alerted
to the phenomenon and have spent a lot of time observing
Jews walking (among other things).  The main problem with
my methodology was I knew they were Jews to begin with.
I've tried to "predict" who is a Jew from among strangers
primarily on the basis of their walk.  This works better
for people over 35; under 35 assimilation has become too
widespread to tell.   Of course, you could say that all
Jews walk as though they were over 35...that too may be
true. Here's to a few more logs on the fire!

Subject: "shiksa" again

From the book review section of the NY Times, Sunday,
12/13, in a review by John Simon of a new biography of Kurt
Weill, referring to his marriage to Lotte Lenya:

"Yet the secret of their getting on so well together was,
as he wrote his parents (upset at his marrying a shiksa),
that here were 'two people with different, unconnected
artistic interests, each helping the other along his own
path'."

Subject: RE: Uxoriousness

Apropos Ellen Prince's remark about her spouse, the uxor.
Uxorious is denoted in English as a husband who is overfond
of his wife, doting, therefore submissi ve to the woman. It
is not henpecked, nor "pussy-whipped," but one who dotes, a
nd that does not necessarily come out as pejorative.  I
regard myself as a uxor ious type of husband; but my wife
would say I was overbearing, bullying, domineering,
difficult, too independent, too selfmotivated,
tooinconsiderate of her f eelings and rights, and etc. I
think we who enjoy nuances would probably all ag ree that
it is how a thing is said, how a think is said, that is,
that determin es the intention.  "Brutus is an honorable
man."  So he was.  Not in that speech. Who could tell from
one sentence. I am delighted with my shaygetz soninlaw, of
course, but I can hear those very narsty now deceased aunts
and uncles, a sc ad of them, all gone, putting a spin on
their intonation that would curl the ha ir on all our
heads. My poor mother, nearly fifty years married, or 60,
if I cant count, was always called Sie, to her face.  My
father's sisters were a rough lot in their youth, till
their 80s. My mother was far too intelligent and refi ned
and American for them.  Imagine being called "her" to you
face over dinner by your sistersinlaw!  Rage and
exasperation with them were my dear mother's lot all her
life. This is a family I could never recognize from Jewish
literature as Jewish. I was 22 before I happened on Maxim
Gorki's autobiographies, MY CHILDHOOD, and the other two,
and I immediately spotted my folks as Russian, violent
Bessarabian types, out of Gorki's family, yet! Just lacking
the use of vodka as a substitute for tea.  Had they used
vodka, no telling the murders that might have occurred.
Instead it was savage satire....Shikse was the least word
of offense in their vocabulary.
