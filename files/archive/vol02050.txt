Subject: Galitsianer

Ellen is right about thew usual features by which Galician
Jews are stereotyped. The reasons for the difference from
the stereotype of local non-Jews has interested me. Like
all stereotypes, there seems to have been some difference
between the stereotype and reality. I'm not particularly
proud of NOT being a G-man but I always figured that there
must have been something special in the drinking water when
I encountered colleagues like Salo Baron and I.I. Rabi at
the Jewish Studies Seminar at Columbia. Or, think of Freud
and his entire early circle. Any theories out there about
historical or sociological ca the negative stereotyping
among Jews?

Subject: re: Country Yossi revisited

[Dave Sherman:]

*my* problem with country yossi and his ilk is that (1)his
audience tends to think this is yiddish music, (2)it is not
yiddish--it is english (or yinglish) with lots of
borrowings, (3)his audience (not you, of course) tends not
to listen to 'real' yiddish music. if he's taken for what
he is--a contemporary version of burlesque, in english, and
with a missionary zeal in his proselytizing--then i have no
complaint or criticism.

i should add that i don't blame country yossi et al. for
this situation--it's the 'jewish' radio hosts that i blame.
whether it's their personal taste at play or a matter of
payola, i don't know, but, for each isa kremer- or moishe
oisher-type song they play, one has to sit thru at least 20
country yossi- type chefs d'oeuvre. this is true at least
in ny (wevd, art raymond) and in philadelphia (wibf, barry
reisman).

Subject: Galitsianer

I would never have believed that I would write a public
defense of Galitsianer, but ...

When I told my late father, Sancha, z"l, that I intended to
marry [Golda], he asked where "they" came from.  I said,
"Jersey City."  He answered, "No, before that." "Berlin."
"Before that."  "Tarnov."  A look of shock. Then, "I warned
you about shickses and I warned you about schvartze, but I
always thought you had enough sechel on your own not to
marry a galitsianer."  Golda did, however, soon become a
favorite of my father's too.

For those who want to hear beautiful spoken Yiddish, I
suggest they listen to records of the marvelous -
unfortunately dead now - Israeli comedians, Dzigan and
Schumacher, who were Galitsianer through and through.

For the stereotypes: remember Nobel Prize winner and
proud galitsianer, S.Y. Agnon, who puts the lie to
each and every one of the pejoratives mentioned by
Ellen.

Subject:  Montreal update

A few brief postscripts to my lengthy paean to Jewish
Montreal (MENDELE 2.49):

Montreal," showing at the Canadian Jewish Congress, Aug.
3-Sept. 4, 1992 (Mon.-Thu., 10 a.m.-4 p.m.; Fri., 10 a.m.-2
p.m.).  Address: 1590 Docteur Penfield (intersection of
Cote des Neiges).  Tel. (514) 931-7531.  From Sept. 15-Oct.
31, 1992, this exhibit will be at the Mercier Maison de la

Fri.-Sun., 1 p.m.-5 p.m.)  Tel. (514) 872-8755 (fluency in

special performance of "Di shvegerns [Les belles-soeurs],"

RESTAURANT:  Brown Derby, in Van Horne shopping plaza (Van
Horne & Victoria).  "Kosher-style," with an ambience and

border.  Includes such Eastern Ashkenazic delicacies as
karnatsl and (ugh) ptsha, alongside Southern fried chicken
and key lime pie.

BIBLIOGRAPHY:  Novels by Mordecai Richler:  "The
Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz," "St. Urbain's Horseman,"
"Joshua Then and Now," and "Solomon Gursky Was Here." "An
Everyday Miracle:  Yiddish Culture in Montreal," edited by
Ira Robinson et al.  Montreal:  Vehicule, 1990

[The shames notes with sadness that his otherwise faultless
colleague has an aversion for ptsha/ptsya/petcha.  But, as
the b'laz speakers of Montreal say: des gouts et des
couleurs on ne discute pas.]
