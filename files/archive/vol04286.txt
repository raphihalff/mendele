Subject: Photos of deported children

I realize that the following announcement is only marginally related to
Mendele's concerns, but I hope that the shames will accept my
rationalization that the people involved were largely Yiddish-speaking,
and hence that this  matter falls within Mendele's purview.

According to data collected by Serge Klarsfeld approximately 76 000 Jews
were deported from France to the death camps, mainly Auschwitz. Included
in this total were about 11 100 children under 18. In October 1994,
Klarsfeld published a remarkable book of 1552 p, entitled "Memorial des
Enfants Juifs Deportes de France" which not only presented lists of these
children, grouped by convoy of deportation with AGE, place of birth, and
last known address in France, but also photographs of some 1485 of the
deported children.

The purpose of this posting is to bring this extraordinary work to the
attention of the Mendele list. It is planned to publish a supplementary
volume of photographs. Any Mendelniks or their relatives or friends who
may be able to supply photographs of the murdered children are urged to
do so. Photographs or orders for the book (500 F) should be sent to :

Subject: Including home town with the signature

In reading the many interesting discussions on Mendele I am often elated
to find that contributions come from all four corners of the globe.
However, it is not always clear from where a particular posting emanates.

I therefore suggest to all members of the list that whenever a
contribution is sent, that the signature includes the town of origin (and
possibly the country) so that we can get a better feel for, at least, the
physical breadth of our discussions.

[A fine idea.  Let's hope it takes hold.  Please note that this applies
to home town only.  Degrees, titles, affiliations remain treyf. nm]

Subject: A poem by Glatshteyn

For another taste of Glatshteyn's poetry, here are excerpts reflecting
one of his major themes: the Holocaust and antisemitism.  Translation is
by Richard Fein, from his book of Glatshteyn's selected poems. YIVO
transliteration is mine: "mea culpa" in advance.

"A gute nakht, velt," (Good night, world), is possibly Glatshteyn's most
well-known poem.  Glatshteyn's depressing visit to Poland in 1934 gave
him a view of a formerly vibrant Jewish world disintegrating under the
inexorable spread of virulent antisemitism.  The poem, written _before_
the Holocaust (1938), is a scathing rejection of European "culture," with
its "flabby democracies" and "cold sympathy compresses" and Jew- hate.

A gute nakht, breyte velt,
groyse, shtinkendike velt.
Nisht du, nor ikh farhak dem toyer.
Mit dem langn khalat,
Mit der fayerdiker, geler lat,
Mit dem shtoltsn trot,
Oyf mayn eygenem gebot --
Gey ikh tsurik in geto.
Vish op, tsetret ale geshmadte shpurn.
Kh'valger zikh in dayn mist.
Loyb, loyb, loyb,
Tsehoykert yidish lebn.
Kherem, velt, oyf dayne treyfene kulturn.
Khotch alts iz farvist,
Shtoyb ikh zikh in dayn shtoyb,
Troyrik yidish lebn.

...

A gute nakht. Kh'gib dir, velt, tsushteyer
ale mayne bafrayer.
Nem tsu di Yezus-markses, verg zikh mit zeyer mut.
Krapir iber a tropn undzer getoyft blut.
Un ikh hob hofn az, khotsh er zamt zikh,
geyt oyf tog-eyn-tog-oys mayn vartn....

==========

Good night, wide world,
great stinking world.
Not you, but I slam the gate.
With the long gabardine,
with the yellow patch -- burning --
with proud stride
I decide ---:
I am going back to the ghetto.Wipe out, stamp out all traces of
apostacy.
I wallow in your filth.
Blessed, blessed, blessed,
hunchbacked Jewish life.
Go to hell with your polluted cultures, world.
Though all is ravaged,
I am dust of your dust,
sad Jewish life.
...

Good night.  It's all yours, world.  I disown
my liberation.
Take back your Jesusmarxists, choke on their arrogance.
Croak on a drop of our baptized blood.
And though He tarries, I have hope;
day in, day out my expectation grows....

Subject: Glatshteyn and Ozick

It was a good number of years ago, and I'm having a little trouble
recalling the precise event, but there may be some of you (Janet Hadda?)
who can help. An award ceremony honoring Glatshteyn, (sponsored by the
Bnai Brith, perhaps), at which Cynthia Ozick spoke. Her quite magnificent
short story "Envy" had recently been published in Commentary, and the
atmosphere was rather tense.

As I recall, Cynthia Ozick had known and been a friend of Glatshteyn's
for many years, and tearfully spoke of the misunderstanding caused by the
publication of the story. The title which she had submitted to Commentary
had simply been "Envy"; the editors alone were responsible for adding the
offensive subtitle "or Yiddish in America". It had not been intended as a
depiction of Glatshteyn/Bashevis.

I'd value any help in sorting out the details of this event.

Subject: More on tifle

An interesting curiosity:  The residents of the small German town of
Schlofloch (I'm not sure of the spelling) use a secret patois, a kind of
rural jargon containing many Yiddish-Hebrew words.  And the word that
non-Jews use for church in this "language" is the Hebrew-Yiddish _tu'me_,
which means impurity, sinfulness.
