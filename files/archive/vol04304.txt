     "Singer told me a few jokes to pass the time.  He asked the man in
     front of us, 'fun vanen ir shtamt', [sic] where he's from.  'Ikh
     bin fun ayzn,' I am made of iron, replied the man, not divulging
     his origins. 'He's a Galician, that's why he doesn't want to say
     where he's from', whispered Singer.  'Two men are sitting in a
     dentist's office.  One asks the other, 'Where are you from?'  The
     second says, 'I'm a Galician.'  The first man is surprised:  'Oh,
     excuse me, I thought you were Jewish!'" cited from Jonathan
     Boyardin, _The Ethnography of Memory_, Bloomington and
     Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1991, p. 143.

     _Der galitsiyaner feter_ ('The Galician Uncle'), starring
     the guest team of Peysekh Burshtin and Lilyen Luks (1958);

     by Vilyem Segal with music by Herman Vol [Wohl] (1930, 1935);
     _Der galitsiyaner khosn_ ('The Galician Bridegroom') (1930);
     _Der galitsiyaner koboy_ ('The Galicican Cowboy') starring Leo
     Fuks and Reytshl Ritshman (1948, 1957);
     _Dos galitsiyaner vaybl_ ('The Galician Little Wife') with
     Dzheni Lovitsh (1957).

     Tsvi-Hirsh Rubnshteyn and Avrom Amber-Strush.  Kemat a
     galitsiyaner was used by Leo Kesner.  Munye Nadler called himself
     Galitsin.  There are other variants as well.  See Berl Kagan,

     "Vos nokh bin ikh dir shuldik, poyln?
     Ikh hob getrotn af dayn feter erd
     In tshobetes mit lekherlekhe zoyln.
     Tog un nakht hob ikh zikh tsugehert

     Ikh bin durchgegangen ale groyln --
     Vos nokh bin ikh dir shuldik, poyln"?

     ("What More Do I Owe You, Poland?"

     "What more do I owe you, Poland?
     I have tred your rich soil
     With clodhopper boots with leather soles.
     Night and day I listened
     To your curses.  My twisted shoulder
     Received your blows with love,
     And like stalks full of grain,
     Your sons cut off my brothers'
     Heads.  Even now before my eyes
     I see the scythe and the steaming axes.
     That spring day the grass
     Was covered by blood not by dew.
     I have been through all your horrors,
     What more do I owe you, Poland?")

(21) Ibid., p. 138-139.
(22) The prominence of Galician Jews in the arts, sciences, public and
     religious life, Judaic scholarship and a host of other areas could
     be documented by a very substantial encyclopaedia which remains to
     be compiled.  Literature alone provides evidence of a rich Galician
     -Jewish achievment.  In the distinguished bilingual anthology,
     _The Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse_, edited by Irving Howe,
     Ruth R. Wisse, and Khone Shmeruk [New York, Penguin Books, 1988],
     with translations by noted American poets and translators, no
     fewer than seven of the thirty-nine poets represented were born
     in Galicia.  One of these poets, Berish Vaynshteyn, was born here
     in Rzeszow.  A list of Hebrew and Yiddish writers and scholars
     born and raised in Galicia would include the Nobel Prize Laureate
     Shmuel-Yosef Agnon and such Yiddish writers as Yankev Fridman,
     Moyshe-Leyb Halpern, Rokhl Korn, Meyer Shtiker, Judd Teller,
     Berish Vaynshteyn, Abe Shtoltsnberg, and Meylekh Ravitsh, just to
     name a few from the modern period.  One ought also to mention
     Menakhem-Mendl Lefin-Sotenever (1749-1826), who was called "the
     father of the Galician haskala."   His translation into Yiddish of
     Mishle ('Proverbs') [Tarnapol 1813] is remarkable because it
     rejected the tradition of literalistic translation and because it
     is rendered in the colloquial Yiddish of the beginning of the
     nineteenth century.
(22a) An instance of this is _Trubadur z Galicji_ produced at
      the Yiddish State Theatre in Warsaw through 1992.

      S'tut vey!                          It hurts!
      S'tut shreklikh vey!                Oh, how it hurts!

      Fun vilde soynes hent.              Of our barbarous foe.

                                          From old Jews' beards.

      Fun yidns berd --                   From Jews' beards --

      S'tut shreklekh vey!                It hurts!

          Kroke, februar 1940.                 Krakow, February 1940.

Note: The Yiddish expression "valgert zikh af der erd" can also mean
     'is homeless', thus reinforcing the more immediate sense of
     'lying about on the ground, neglected, discarded'.  Gebirtig
     appears to have consciously chosen a daytshmerism, _plindern_
     (from NHG _pluendern_ 'to plunder, loot') to emphasize that the
     action was committed by Germans.  There are plenty of terms for
     'to plunder' in Yiddish which the poet could have used.  Note how
     the pronoun _zey_ 'they', which at the outset refers unambiguously
     to the Nazis, the barbarous other, and is antithetical to an 'us'
     that includes Jews and Poles, shifts to point to antiSemitic
     Poles', leaving open perhaps the question whether 'us' still
     includes the Poles.

     pp. 341-2, prints the first two lines on one line.

-----------------------
NOTE: For some time now I have been trying to understand why
_Galitsianer_ (is this the preferred transcription, or should we
palatalize and write _Galitsiyaner_ or _Galitsyaner_?) have the
reputation(s) they do and I am still not altogether satisfied with
what I have uncovered.  I am familiar with the stereotypes Ellen Prince
mentions (ignorant, fanatic, primitive), but not her fourth one (dirty).
I know that in certain contexts, all Ost-Juden were called "dirty" and
that this has often been a part of antisemitic stereotypes generally.
In a talk I recently gave in Galicia I grappled with the question of
what "Galician-ness" consists of both from within and without. L.P.
