Subject: Instructional materials for non-standard Yiddish

[Regarding Eliyahu Juni's query (6.045)]: There is always H.E. Goldin,
_The Yiddish Teacher_ (Hebrew Publishing Company, 1993), in the same
format and style as _Shalom Aleichem_, which is used to teach Hebrew to
adults.

Subject: Learning non-standard Yiddish

In response to Eliyahu Juni's query:

S.A. Birnbaum, son of the famous Nathan Birnbaum and himself a great
Yiddish linguist and Hebrew paleographer, was firmly opposed to
"klal-yidish" on both ideological and practical grounds.  He denounced
SYO (Standard Yiddish Orthography), which is based on "klal yidish"
(which is in turn based on Vilna pronunciation) as "neo-maskilic,"
"heretical," and unreflective of the pronunciation of three-quarters of
Yiddish speakers. His "Yiddish:  A Survey and Grammar" (University of
Toronto, 1979) provides instruction in what Birnbaum calls "Southern
Yiddish," i.e. "Polish" Yiddish, although he offers notes explaining
differences between it and the other dialects.  Further, he employs in
the book his own interdialectal orthographic and transliteration
systems, allowing the reader to pronounce words according to any of the
three major dialects. Birnbaum also published a spelling dictionary for
his orthography some time in the '30s.

Subject: Dutzn un irtzn

Some years ago, when I did the Yiddish summer program at Colombia
University, the advanced Yiddish class was castigated by the professor
for addressing each other and occasionally him by _du_ instead of _ir_.
He stated that when he was a student it was inconceivable to address the
teacher in that way, and that even school colleagues used _ir_ except
with their close friends. He felt our use of _du_ was a reflection of
"thinking" in English since "you" is used both in singular and plural,
and "thou" has effectively disappeared.

However having grown up in Yiddish circles in Melbourne, Australia I
think _du_ is used almost exclusively and acceptably by everyone and of
all ages ie by both Australian born and European-born, old and young. If
anything my impression is that _du_ is more acceptable because of the
relative informality of relationships now rather than any grammatical
transposition. In the Melbourne context this might be because virtually
the entire Yiddish speaking community arrived together post-war and in
many ways regard each other and all their off-spring as one extended
family or it may just be a reflection of the late 20th century.

But I would be interested to know if this is a common experience
elsewhere in the world, and whether anyone knows if other languages have
undergone a similar "deformalisation" - eg is _vous_ more likely to be
_tu_ in 1990s France than it was in the 1930s?

Subject: Yiddish names

Here are two sources for Jewish -- and Yiddish -- personal names, both
of them in-print:

Harkavy, Alexander.  Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary.  A reprint of
the 1928 expanded second edition.  New York:  YIVO Institute for Jewish
Research; Schocken Books, 1988.  See pp. [525]-530, "Fartseykhenish fun
yidishe nemen.  Mit zeyer iberleyg oyf english."

Gorr, Shmuel.  Jewish Personal names:  Their Origin, Derivation and
Diminutive Forms.  Edited by Chaim Freedman.  Teaneck, NJ:  Avotaynu,
1992.  (Rabbi Gorr's book includes a few questionable etymologies.)

There are a number of dictionaries of Jewish surnames, but the state of
the art for that genre is represented by Alexander Beider's two books:

A Dictionary of Jewish Surnames from the Russian Empire.  Teaneck, NJ:
Avotaynu, 1993.  Covers the 15 gubernii of the Russian Pale of
Settlement (i.e., excluding Congress Poland).

A Dictionary of Jewish Surnames from the Kingdom of Poland.  Teaneck,
NJ: Avotaynu, 1996.  Covers the 10 gubernii of Congress Poland (=
Kingdom of Poland).

Each of Beider's volumes includes several thousand surnames that the
author encountered in various types of lists, along with etymologies
for, and geographic distributions of these names.  The two dictionaries
also include extensive introductions, of a substantial scholarly nature.
The author, a computer analyst (and Soviet emigre) who lives in Paris,
is said to be working on a companion volume that will cover Jewish
surnames in Galicia.

(N.b., As he points out in his introductions, many surnames are
formed on the basis of personal names.)
