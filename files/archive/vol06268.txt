Subject: "Afn Fidl": serial or not?

Henik Sapoznik [6.265] identified the linkage device in _Afn fidl_
that suggests a serial origin.  So it does.  And a sheynem dank to him
for his thoughtful response.

On the other hand, I still find the length of each kapitl surprisingly
short if it was serialized in a monthly.  It seems to me just as
possible that the arrangment in "chapters" was contrived as a literary
conceit, in order to give a more novelistic sweep to a shorter form
designed to be read in one sitting.

Of course, I am simply speculating -- that is to say, speaking in
reckless ignorance of the facts.  The thing to do is go to an
authoritative source. Are there copies of _Der yidisher familye_ held
in any collections?  Does _Dos Sholem-Aleykhem bukh_ give more
information beyond that which Mr. Fridhandler passed along [6.264]?

We are all counting a full report from Henik!

Subject: A fine caricature of Sholem Aleichem

The discussions about Afn Fidl by Sholem Aleichem remind me of a fine,
beautifully insightful, artful caricature by David Levine.  It's in
The Big Book of Jewish Humor, ed. William Novak and Moshe Waldoks on
page 202.

Sholem Aleichem is holding an open notebook under his chin as though
it were a violin.  His left hand supports the other end of the spine
of the notebook. The fingers curl over the far end of the spine as
though fingering strings. His right hand holds a large pen which he is
drawing across the notebook like a bow.  The meaning is obvious: He
makes soulful music with the sounds of his writing.  His Yiddish
appeals strongly to the ear.

Sholem Aleichem never learned to play the violin although he was
strongly drawn to music, especially the violin.  The story, Afn Fidl,
has a curiously discordant note at the end, out of tune with the
beginning.  At the start the narrator (named Sholem Nakhem Veviks, the
author's real name) offers to play something on the violin for his
listeners.  At the end, he cries out with obvious disappointment, _Oys
Fidl!_.  In the story, the father's anguished disapproval of his son's
meeting with a non-Jewish violinist on shabes had undone his hopes for
learning to play.  But David Levine's caricature focussed on how well
Sholem Aleichem compensated.

Subject: The Second Commandment

Can anyone refer me to Yiddish anecdotes regarding the Second
Commandment prohibition on graven images, or more generally, an
aversion to visual representation?  Examples from novels, poetry,
memoirs, essays, stories, even paintings will do.  Personal
reminiscences from anyone who encountered this taboo at some point are
also welcome.  The material is for my dissertation which addresses the
problem of iconicity in modern Hebrew and Yiddish poetry.

A sheynem dank,

Barbara (Blume) Mann

Subject: Tsholnt

I saw the posting referring to the origin of cholent.  My father told
me that it was invented by Rashi in France and simply means warm
beans from the french chaud lent.

Subject: Pareve

Thanks to Les Train (6:263) for his Latin etymology of the ultimately
Slavic Pareve. It certainly sounds logical and answers a long-standing
question in my mind. I always wondered how the Sephardim express this
specific reference to food containing neither meat not milk. I speak
Ladino, but don't know of any such term. In Hebrew-speaking Israel,
the word is simply "parve", an admitted borrowing from Yiddish, and
everyone, Ashkenazic and Sephardic understands it.  As far as its
secondary meaning, neither one nor the other,  those Mendeleniks with
an interest in biology might like to know that Israeli scientists
tried to cross a chicken with a rabbit, but failed. The result was
nisht a hin nisht a hare. Purim is close upon us, after all...

Subject: Mendele vert a navenodnik

As already announced, Mendele will be silent until about April 2.
Please continue to send posts as usual.  If getting back and bentshing
goymel is the best part of a trip, a full e-mail box without bills is
a very close second.

Between now and then two interesting meetings involving Yiddish--and
open to the public--will be taking place.

I mention them in this space in the hope not only that many of our
readers will attend but to invite those who do (Kathryn Hellerstein's
idea, for which thanks) to act as rapporteurs for Mendele. Opgeredt
that papers from the participants themselves would be more than
welcome.

The first is the Third Annual Yiddish Conference and Festival at the
University of Hartford, March 23-25.  It features lectures by Curt
Leviant on the 23rd, Michael Steinlauf on the 24th, and Zalman Mlotek,
on the 25th. The latter two speakers are Mendelists.  Call
860-768-4964 for details.

The second, already announced, is the Kutchin Conference at the
University of Pennsylvania on March 31. Speakers include Mendelistn
Kathryn Hellerstein and Ellen Prince, as well as Rakhmiel Peltz,
Jeffrey Shandler, and Chava Weissler.  Call 215-898-6654 for details.

A dank ale velkhe hobn geshribn mekoyekh "farkukn zikh".  Un zayt mir
ale gezunt.
