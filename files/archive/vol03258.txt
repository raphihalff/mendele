Subject: Re: "White Challah"

Someone, a few issues ago, mentioned the story "White Chalah."
Lamed Shapiro is the author.  It was first published in 1919.  You
can find it in English translation by Norbert Guterman in Howe and
Greenberg's A TREASURY OF YIDDISH STORIES.  It's a great story!

Subject: White Challah-Lamed Shapiro

Thanks to Mark Flumerfelt and Dvosye Bilik for responding to my
question about Yiddish literature and non-Jews.  And to Tsipe Khana
Shavelson for prompting me to respond.  I believe the "White
Challah" story Mark Flumerfelt referred to is by Lamed Shapiro, not
I. L. Peretz.  "White Challah," an excellent story, is included in
the Irving Howe/Eliezer Greenberg anthology, Treasury of Yiddish
Stories.

I know little about Shapiro, but I really like the two stories of
his that I've read.  The other, entitled "Newyorkish," is available
in translation in The New Country, a compilation of Yiddish
literature about America edited by Henry Goodman.  Unfortunately, I
don't have the other bibliographical information at hand.  For
Shapiro in the original, look for the collection of stories entitled
"Di yidishe melukhe."  This collection is in translation as either
"On the Jewish Government" or simply, "The Jewish Government."

Subject: Feygele/feigele

My memory of this word being used for an effiminate/homosexual male
male extends back to my childhood in the '30's in Paterson and
Passaic, N.J., [greetings Dan Leeson] where at the time c.25 % of
the population was Jewish.  I distinctly remember my Paterson uncle
using the term to refer to a man.  Less clearly, I believe he had a
78 rpm record of a vaudeville-type comic where the word was used...
In the mid/late 40's it was used in the Catskills where I worked a
few summers including one at the Yiddish Farband's Camp Eden (not
exactly the Catskills across the Hudson below West Point).  In 1944,
I hung out with the band at Klein's Hillside where the term was used
by one of the musicians to refer to a particular guest.

I vividly remember going to a burlesque show in Newark in the early
'40's (they weren't very fastidious in checking age) with my best
friend [the Empire if I recall rightly].  I remember it because it
was my first and only burlesque show -- Mayor LaGuardia having
closed down the 42nd street burlesque row at the start of WWII for
national security reasons. And I remember only one act, one thing
about the show: the comic scene where a man hides various female bed
partners in different rooms and places as others, finally his wife,
knock at the door and eventually he gets rid of all of them, after
which he goes to the closet and out comes a man... and I remember
thinking 'feygeles.'  Many [most?] of the burlesque comics were
Jewish and they did semi-Yiddish routines, using Yiddish works and
phrases.

I can give no help on the origins in relation to bird, but note that
various western languages, e.g., French, have a variety of words for
homosexual males that all relate to traditional sterotypes of
so-called "frilly, fluttering, girlish behavior" most of which are
flower-derived [pansy being the most common; but Boris Vian in a
1955 song, Bourree de complexes, used coquelicot (field-poppy) which
is not in either of the two French slang dictionaries I have.]  It's
easy to see how Yiddish could go from bird.  After all, Feygel(e),
and in English, Birdy, were common nick-names for women... many
older women I knew were called "Birdy" ... but I haven't run into
one among recent generations.  I would suggest looking at Burlesque
for early use of 'feygele' -- ask Milton Berle or George Burns,
Uncle Miltie was famous for his cross- dressing and the Burns and
Allens old TV show was loaded with double entendre sex jokes
including homosexual ones -- and Yiddish "popular" records.

Fred Kogos' Dictionary of Yiddish Slang and Idioms (c.1966,1967)
lists: "Faigeleh" as "Little Bird.  Also a pervert, fairy,
homosexual, fag" as his first entry under 'F' (p.35) and gives
"faigeleh" as the Yiddish for "pansy (male)" on p.142.  Norman
Rosten in Joys of Yiddish (p.114) also lists "faygeleh" as
"Homosexual.  Quite common ...in the American-Jewish vernacular.
...Jews use faygeleh as a discrete way of describing a homosexual --
especially where they might be overheard."  "Fairy" and "fag" are
his English definitions.  {From original 1968 edition).

More generally, as a sociologist I am "fascinated" by the process of
how Mendele got into this topic: looking to "coin" or create a
Yiddish equivalent to "gay" as if linguists' decisions govern a
language community's usage.  Only active Yiddish-speakers will
create a word if they feel a need for one and clearly those who
write and publish in the popular domain, especially homosexuals,
will have a lot to say about what comes to be used.  Perhaps they'll
just make 'gay' Yiddish as the French have made ski, weekend,
whiskey etc., French despite the French Academy, and as they seem to
be making 'gay' a French word too, judging by contacts I have had
since 1989.  But active members of the community will have a better
feel for that.
