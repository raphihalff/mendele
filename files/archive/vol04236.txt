Subject: geography

Can anyone out there tell me precisely where Otvotsk (Otwock), the resort
town with hot springs, I think, and Bereze-Kartuskay are/were located?
I'm especially interested in knowing which national borders they fell
within circa 1923.  Thanks.

Subject: On [RR] requests

A much belated comment on Zellig Bach's proposal to handle revision
requests:  I am all for it, and many good reasons have been metioned on
Mendele which I don't need to repeat.  There is just one part of the
proposal that bothers me:

>3.  The flag [RR] will promptly be deleted, so nobody, except the author,
>will know that a review was done.  Thus no stigma whatsoever will attach
>to an [RR] request.

While this is certainly well meant, I don't like the idea for two
reasons:

If I were in the situation to send something out in Yiddish with an [RR]
request, I'd definitely want the readers to know my text has been
revised.  Otherwise I'd feel I'm decking myself out in borrowed plumes. I
might even get a Yiddish reply that went way over my head which, IMO,
would be more embarrassing than to openly state that I'm not quite sure
of my Yiddish.

Now this isn't very likely in my case -- I'd probably take hours to
produce something that might be justly deemed beyond repair.  But for a
learner of Yiddish, the [RR], if it remained with a message, would be a
valuable hint that the text has been checked by a native speaker and can
be safely taken at face value.  It would thus make Mendele an even more
valuable instrument in learning (or picking up) some Yiddish.

Zayt ir ale gezunt, [RR] :-)

Subject: Pronouncing "geooghit"

Thanks, Dan Leeson, for explaining how to pronounce the word "geooghit".
Upon first seeing it, I imagined some 15 ways that you might have meant
for it to be pronounced, and none of them were familiar to me.
Graphically, it reminded me of the spelling "ghoti" for 'fish'.  And just
as _ghoti_ is graphically quite far from _fish_, "geooghit" is quite far
from the way the word would be written in a developed system of
transliteration/transcription/Romanization.  More below.

Indeed, it _is_ hard to describe sounds!  One of the best arguments in
the world for a standard transliteration or transcription system (for
individuals languages, and for all languages).  If I understood your
answer correctly, "geooghit" would be rendered _zhuzhet_ in the system
worked out for Yiddish romanization.  (I'm familiar with _es zhumet in di
oyern_, so I've learned something new.)  With a developed system, the
(say) 500 out of ca. 600 readers of Mendele who are more or less familiar
with the system will now be able to read the word with no difficulty.
Lang lebn zoln sistemen!

Btw, a refue shleyme!

Subject: Pronouncing "geooghit" /ankle pain

Ah, the usefulness of YIVO romanization!  Dan Leeson's description of the
pronunciation of "geooghit" makes it clear (?) that the word is
"zhuzhet", from "zhuzhen" meaning 'hum, drone'.  So it's tinnitus, not
earache, that's being described.  For "I have an earache", what's wrong
with 'der oyer tut mir vey', or 'es tut mir vey der oyer"?  For ankle
pain, 'dos knekhl tut mir vey", etc.  "Klapn" and "hakn" seem to describe
the character or feel of particular pains, rather than their sites.
"Shtekhn" is another such verb; no doubt there are others.
