>"reb" far a mentsh.

Hershl Berman shraybt:

>mentch is a person, not a man. The correct term is Froy un Man.

Subject: Starting with a verb

It's OK for songs to start with a verb because of the literary rule
known as artistic license. Poetry is also exempt from proper grammar
at times. However, in writing or speaking for non-artistic purposes,
the rule stands.

Subject: Yiddish "spelling"

The local paper recently carried an obituary for an elderly
Mennonite lady named Mrs. Elizabeth Schmuck.  Don't laugh.  I'm sure
there is a perfectly reasonable etymological explanation.  If you
want a chuckle, consider the name of the famous Augsburger banking
family:  Fugger.  Run that through a slight consonantal shift.  I'm
not making this up.  I've seen it in print.

At any rate,  no one with a modicum of ability in the English
language is going to talk about the late Mrs. Skmuck.  It has to do
with a basic principle of linguistics.  (Mario Pei, where are you
when I need you?)  "Sch" followed by a consonant simply cannot be
pronounced any way other than soft, thus I see no reason why it
should not be as acceptable in Yiddish transliteration as "sh."

Would a French Yiddishist really write "chmou...," er, "chou" or
"choustaire?"  I'd be interested to know.

Vowels get a little stickier.  But consonants are pretty
straightforward.  YIVO hin, YIVO her, so what's the difference
between "schuh" and "shuh," "tzitzis" and "tsitsis?"

Subject: My father's obituary: some missing tam

Erstens, many thanks to the Mendelniks who sent condolences.

Zveytens, the Columbia University press office eliminated from what
I wrote out for them a few points of potential interest to
Mendelniks, and the Times cut further. (Incidentally, I was
surprised to discover that the Times will not give their informants
a chance to review the piece as written.) Edited out: (a)his, and
his parents', affiliation with the Bund, even though a gloss was
supplied;(b) the nature of his early education, viz. in the secular
Yiddishist grunshul and gymnasium directed by, respectively, his
mother and his father; (c) his underground activity against, to be
specific, the fascist regime which ended Latvian democracy in 1934.

To honor my father's strong sense of justice,I will take the
opportunity to add this detail: after they discharged my
grandparents and closed their schools, the fascists handed the
schools over to the *rabonim* for their use; the *rabonim* accepted.
