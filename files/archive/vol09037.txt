With Deepest Sorrow ...

I wish to inform our friends that our beloved cultural co-leader CHANAN
LEVKOVITZ  passed into eternity on the 22nd of october, in Israel.

Chanan has not only orphaned his family but also his friends in israel and
america. he was very active with us in Yiddish of Greater Baltimore and
created his own musical group. He himself played mandolin, banjo and fiddle
and sang for us beloved yiddish and hebrew songs.

He was born in Trab, a shtetl that is now in Belarus, but he always
considered himself a a Vilner and spoke a rich Vilner Yiddish.

During the war, Chanan fought as a young partisan in the Naliboki
wilderness against the Nazis and their helpers. arriving in israel after
the war, he began to fight against the enemies of Medinat Israel.

Not long ago, he spoke here in Baltimore, before leaving for Israel for a
small trip (the last one) and spoke optimistically about hopes for peace,
as well as for a future in Israel for the Yiddish language.

He s already sorely missed.

Subject: The Golden Age of Yiddish-American Radio

Sound Portraits Production is in the midst of producing a NPR documentary
series about the "golden age" of Yiddish-American Radio (1925-1955). As part
of the series, we are searching for individuals who participated -- as
announcers, performers, producers, sound engineers -- in this largely
overlooked chapter in Jewish American history. We are also looking for
individuals who have vivid memories of the great shows, like "The Forward
Hour," "Bei Tate-Mames Tish," "The Yiddisher Filosof," "The Grammeister."

From: "Charles H Fuchsman" <charles.fuchsman@gte.net>
Subject: Brumberg on Yiddish/Hebrew

Regarding my remark, associating Khaim Zhitlovsky with the Bund, Brumberg
notes that Zhitlovsky was never a Bundist.  In popular perception, however,
he was closely identified with the organization, which published a number of
his articles in the late 1890s (Leksikon fun der nayer yiddisher literatur
3:693, NY, 1960). Of particular interest was his 1899 article in the Bund's
"Der yiddisher arbeter", where his strong anti-Zionist stand provoked
considerable controversy (H.J. Tobias, "The Jewish Bund in Russia",
Stanford, 1972, p.106).  As late as 1904, Theodore Herzl, in the belief that
Zhitlovsky was a Bundist leader, transmitted to him a Russian government
proposal for a cessation of Bundist revolutionary activity (Tobias, op. 
cit., p.248) 
  
Brumberg's dark portrait of a "castrated" Yiddish literature in the Soviet
period appears to blur the distinction between the earlier period
(1919-1933) and the subsequent years of sharp repression and physical
destruction of the Yiddish literary establishment.  The Evsektsiya and
"grotesque orthography" notwithstanding, many high-quality works of Soviet
Yiddish writers were published, including works written but not published in
the pre-Soviet period.  Censorship and heavy=handed editing did have a
chilling effect, especially in the later years.  But we know of works that
were criticized as "nationalist", "individualist", "symbolist", or
"sympathetic to disappearing classes", precisely because they were
published. 
  
Some evidence of the status of Yiddish writers can be found in the
attendance statistics and curriculum contents of Yiddish-language schools in
the USSR.  According to N. Levin, "The Jews in the Soviet Union since 1917",
the proportion of Jewish school-age children attending Yiddish-language
schools in Belorussia rose from 22% in 1922 to 64% in 1932 (in absolute
numbers from 10,745 to 33,398) while comparable increases apparently
occurred in the Ukraine. 
  
The literature contents of grades V, VI, and VII are listed in R.Robin's
"L'Amour du Yiddish", Paris 1984, pp.183-184.  Grade V readings include
Hofshteyn. Raboy, Ignatov, Mendele Mokher Sforim, Kharik, Peretz, Ash,
Markish, Vinchevsky, Shvartsman, Broderzon.  Corresponding readings for
Grade VI include Mendele Mokher Sforim, Sholem Aleikhem, Peretz, Vaisenberg,
Ash, Kharik Hofshteyn, Leivik. 
  
It would be interesting to compare both the Yiddish school attendance and
curricular offerings of the Soviet Union with those of Poland where Bund
influence was strong.  Perhaps, at its best Soviet Yiddish schooling and
literature wasn't so bad.  The tragedy of Soviet destruction of Yiddish
culture lies largely in its greatness and promise in the 1920s.

Subject: The Yiddish of the "Hareidim"

In response to Abraham Brumberg [09.033]:

As a proud Yiddish speaking and reading, Ultra-Orthodox "Hareidi", and yes
"Hassidic" Jew, I was astounded by your recent comments in the "Mendele."
You state "But the ultra-orthodox by and large deny that Yiddish has any
form or specific grammar.  They teach Yiddish exclusively as a spoken
language, and will have nothing to do with anything that smacks of secular
Yiddish, be it literature, scholarship, folklore, ethnography, and the like" 
It is true that we have no need or purpose for "secular literature", for our
"literature" and "culture" and its spirituality and warmth, that has been
the key to the miraculous of the Jewish Nation fulfills all our needs. Yet,
this culture, though of course built on the Holy Books which are written in
"Loshon Hakodesh", spawned a rich and great "Yiddish culture". We are fully
aware of the "rules" of Yiddish, after all we are nearly the only youth that
speak and write this language. Enter any Jewish bookstore in new York or
Jerusalem and you will find scores of novels for young adults written in a
perfect proper Yiddish. The circulation of our Yiddish papers is in the tens
of thousands.

My Dear Mr. Brumberg, indeed we have no need for Peretz, Mendele, Sholem
Aleichem, An-sky, di vilner trupe, etc. For our Yiddish is the Yiddish of
yesterday and tomorrow. Our Yiddish is the Yiddish of the Schuls and
Shtiblach, of the Cheder and the Tisch, the Yiddish of the essence of the
Jewish people, the Yiddish that has a future. Our culture is the laws
revealed to us at Mt. Sinai, and for hundreds of years we have expressed
those thoughts by speaking Yiddish. 
        
It is time for the "secular" "Yiddishests" to recognize that the Yiddish of
the Chareidi is a living growing culture. Perhaps this recognition will
allow us to work together to ensure the survival of Yiddish even outside the
orthodox community. I invite you, to come for a Shabbos to Boro Park, see
and hear the Yiddish in the streets and in the homes, see our culture, feel
its warmth and power, and you will be amazed. 

Respectfully Yours
Abraham Joshua Heschel

P.S. I wrote this letter in english simply since my e-mail does not support
Hebrew fonts, which is necessary for real Yiddish.
