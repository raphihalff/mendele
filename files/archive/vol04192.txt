Subject: Minkhe

I have just read my last contribution in, I think, vol.4.191. Before one
of our Hebraists jumps on me, let me hasten to say that in my little
table of loshn koydesh terms in Yiddish script and YIVO spelling, I left
a letter out of the entry mem-nun-khes-hey for Yiddish /minkhe/
'afternoon service.' I failed to write the final /hey/.

Subject: Bistu

Arn Abramson:

With respect to your query concerning the pre-standardization writing of
"bistu", I am forwarding a message which Anno Siegel was good enough to
send me. If, indeed, the practice is as early as the 15th century, the
form is surely a derivative of "bis + du", however much the synchronic
form "bist" plays a part in our synchronic perceptions. This doesn't
address the issue of consistency in present-day practise.

As an aside, note also the Litvish form "binste": "fun vanen binste?"
"ikh bin fun Yehupets, un du? fun van binstE?" (or "un du fun vanen
binst?")

Subject: Red and redt = ret

Arn Abramson: Incidentally, the contrast between such pairs as red/ret
which persists in Central Yiddish, illustrates stankiewicz's caution tha
the presumed word-final voicing neutralization in CY is constrained by
part of speech. It occurs in substantive but not in verbs and
adjectives.

Subject: Re: Bistu

Since the subject came up again in Arn Abramson's article in 4.191,

I'd like to share a data point.  Forms like "bistu", "hastu" for "bist
du", "hast du" were quite common, if not standard, in older forms of
written modern German.  They are, for instance, often seen in Martin
Luthers writings, so I guess these forms came about at least as early as
the 15th century.  Other monosyllabic verbs were treated similarly, such
as "weistu" for "do you know" and, strangely "wiltu" (not "wilstu") for
"do you want".  I can't say when these forms disappeared from high
German; they still survive as "haste", "biste" etc. in some dialects,
Berlin for one.

Subject: Morpheme integrity and -stu

As with Arn Abramson, other pressures have prevented me from commenting
on the _bistu, hostu_ riddle earlier.  (I wonder if the pressures were
the same?)

I think there isn't anything more to be said about the -stu issue than
"morpheme integrity is violated in this case" and it's probably (one of
the) only ones in the system we're talkiong about (namely, that of the
_Takones fun yidishn oysleyg_, commonly known as "YIVO-oysleyg").

One commonly sees the spelling _volst_ (i.e., vov-alef-lamed-samekh-tes),
but the correct (according to the Takones) spelling is _voltst_ (i.e.
with a final sequence of tes-samekh-tes).  The former spelling reflects
the actual pronounciation, which in turn reflects the rule "delete a
stem-final /t/ when it is followed by the morpheme /st/".  In spoken
Yiddish you actually hear [volst] for orthographic _voltst_, [arbest] for
orthographic _arbetst_, [trakhst] for orthographic _trakhtst_.
Nevertheless, the spelling preserves the stem-final t.  So too when
stem-final -st meets the superlative morpheme -st; thus _dreyst_ 'bold'
must be written _dreystst_ (e.g. shimen iz geven a dreyster held, nor der
dreystster fun zey alemen iz geven ruvn), although the two forms are
actually pronounced the same, viz. [dreyster].

With regard to the pronunciation of _redt_ vs. _ret_:  I was recently
told by a native speaker of English that he feels a difference in the
pronunciation of the /m/ in _lamb_ and _slam_.  The /m/ in the latter
word, he claimed, was "softer".  The intuition mentioned with reference
to _redt_ and _ret_ probably falls under the same category.

Subject: Morpheme integrity and ni(sh)to

Morpheme integrity is violated in _ni(sh)to'_, also.  Note that this is
in contrast to _ni(sh)t do_, where both words are stressed.  In
_ni(sh)to'_, only the second syllable can ever receive stress.

Subject: "Distinguishing" homonyms

Conducting Atlas interviews yields an endless supply of "mayses". In
trying to elicit the gender of the word for 'border', we'd ask "vi hot
geheysn di linye vos tseteylt eyn land fun a tsveytn. Normally, the
definite article plus the word "grenetz" would emerge. If the question
wasn't clear, we'd offer the word in English, Hebrew, or whatever. One
informant insisted that the word border was "vald". After eliciting the
word for 'nose', say "di nuz/nuis" we'd ask for the plural, only to hear
"barinc iz dus nish geveyn. Veye hot den mer vi ayn nuis? Er hot a nuis
in zi hot a nuis!.

We confronted people with rhymes and homynyms--same or different? In
Podolia Bessarabia, where "a"-words are frequently realized with "o"
(tote, mome, vold, voser), people rendered the English sentence 'I touch
the pot' as something like "ekh ti a top dem top". Asked then whether
"top" and "top" were the same, the answer was invariably and
emphatically, "neyn, 'ekh ti a top' iz dokh 'ekh ti a TOP', n 'a top' iz
dokh 'a TOP'. Clearly differentiated, no?

A reverse phenomenon, in a similar vein: You will recall the linguist's
famous problem "one phoneme or two?",  often illustrated by the Polish
distinction between the pair "trzy" 'three' and "czy" 'whether' (Yiddish
interrogative "tsi"). The teacher in my one semester of Polish at
Columbia (a native speaking Pole who shall remain nameless) insisted that
they were homonyms while repeating and obviously distinguishing them
every time he said them. When I insisted that I could hear the
difference, he defied me to take a test. When I hit the target every
time, he said, in desperation "OK, I'll ask my wife". She, perhaps to her
regret, sided with me.  He went down claiming she couldn't be trusted
because she was "too literate", she knew the difference in spelling.

I don't know what her fate was, but the episode made me uncomfortable
enough to keep me from returning for a second term.
