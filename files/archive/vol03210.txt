Subject: Jewish Languages

While we're on the subject of Jewish languages other than Yiddish, I
think I'll put in a word about Yevanic, or Judeo-Greek (I assume the
word comes from Hebrew "Yavan" = "Greece"), which I understand bears
much the same relationship to Greek as Yiddish does to German: it's
basically a dialect of Greek written in Hebrew script. I think it's
pretty much died out; I don't know that much about it, but I can
check around if anybody's interested. (BTW, I've never heard Ladino
called Judeo-Espagnol, though I have heard it called Judeo-Spanish
or Djudesmo/Judezmo.)

Subject: Korn's "A nay kleyd"

Mark Flumerfelfelt was struck by an English version of Rokhl Korn's
"A new dress".  Here's the Yiddish.

	a nay kleyd

	ikh hob zikh ongeton haynt,
	tsum ershtn mol
	nokh zibn lange yor
	a nay kleyd.

	nor s'iz tsu kurts far mayn troyer
	un tsu eng far mayn layd,
	un s'iz a yeder vays-glezerner knop,
	vi a trer,
	vos flist fun di faldn arop
	farshteynert un shver.

Striking indeed.

Subject: Yosele Hill

Fro those mendelniks who are familiar with the old wobbly song Joe
Hill I thought that you might enjoy an old Yiddish version from the
30's. Unfortunately I only managed to recover 3 stanzas but the tam
is still there.

Ikh leg mir shlofn do ba nakht
In shtib siz sha un shtil
Ikh efn op die aygelakh
Hoo ha do shtayt Joe Hill

Oy Yosele ikh sog tsu ihm
'Khob gemaynt du host geshtorbn
Makh tsu dayn moyl du narish khlob
Kuk ikh oys vie a korbn?

Die balabostn hobn dikh umgebrakht
Tsu hitn ihre raykh
'Svet zay gor nit helfn ven arbeter
Fun velt feraynigt aykh!

If anyone is able to add the many missing stanzas it would be much
appreciated.

Arre Komar.

Subject: Learning Yiddish

Khayem Bochner's note on January 17 reminded me that I actually had
a copy of "Der yidisher lerer", by H. E. Goldin.  It was given to me
in the 1960's by my great-uncle, Pinkhes Rudoy, who wrote under the
name Pinye Bal-Loshn; apparently he had used the book (which was
originally published in 1924 and was re-published in 1939) to teach
Yiddish, but I don't know when or where.

He also gave me an old dog-eared copy of a book he had written
himself: "Dos yidishe kind", described on the title page as "a
lerbukh--bashtimt far di yidishe klasn in di talmud-toyres".  The
copyrights are from 1929 and 1931, by the Educational Stationery
House and the Hebrew Publishing Co.  It was based on his teaching
experiences in New York.

I found both books helpful when I was first trying to learn
something of Yiddish, but I would think that "College Yiddish" would
be more generally useful to an adult student, even for self-study.
