Subject: The English _Forward_ maims Yiddish

My apology to Zellig Bach for misinterpreting his post re 'mentsh' in
the English Forward.

I would have no problem with the Forward deciding to adopt YIVO
transliteration conventions. I just have a problem with anyone
dictating any sort of linguistic conventions. And I suspect the
Forward has a pretty good sense of what their readership is most
likely to be familiar with, which has to be their primary concern.

Btw, this week's issue has my beloved noun 'big' in a front-page
headline... ;) (Ok by me -- I just hope they know that this is not a
possible usage for native English speakers.)

Subject: A vertl af yidish

Tried to do it with the tip of my tongue, but it got stuck in the
cracks on the keyboard. Better with the fingertips.

English: God loves the poor and (but?) helps the rich.

faryidisht: oremelayt helft der riboynesheloylem mit libe; gvirim
helft er mit maysim.

Subject: A vertl af yidish

In response to the request of Shari Buxbaum in Mendele 6.300, this
saying can be found in "Words Like Arrows" by Shirley Kumove (p.108).
It is given in regular Yiddish, transliteration and English.  The
transliteration is: "Got hot lib dem oreman un helt dem noged."

and helps the rich one.

Un vos iz der untershid tvishn 'nogid' un 'poretz'??

Does anyone have any  information about Yiddish translations of the
Sherlock Holmes stories? How many were done and how faithfully do they
hew to the originals? A dank,

Subject: A new transcription proposal

In recent issues of Mendele several people have expressed their
dissatisfaction and frustration with the standardized system of
writing Yiddish using English letters.

Maybe the following will be of help.

Don't think about the Yiddish letters that you would use in writing
the word.  Think only of the _sound_ of the word. Here is a key to the
sounds, using common words as they are pronounced in ordinary
American English:

        a  ---   car, father
        e  ---   set
        i  ---   machine, ski, debris
        o  ---   horse, cough
        u  ---   ruler

       ay  ---   Mayan, bayou, kayak, aye, Joseph Haydn
       ey  ---   they, hey!
       oy  ---   toy

       sh  ---   shoe
       zh  ---   azure
        g  ---   good
        s  ---   salt

       kh  ---   voiceless throat sound
        r   ---  voiced throat sound (untrilled uvular R, as in
                   French)

      Letters not listed above are pronounced as in English.

      The letters c, j, q, w, and x are not used.

Zol zayn mit mazl!

P.S.  Yiddish has no capital letters,  but the English alphabet does.
And since we are using the English alphabet, I think we should use
capital letters wherever appropriate -- as at the beginning of a
sentence,  or the first letter of a name.

Subject: Frequency of letters in Yiddish

Does anybody know if there are some statistics about the frequency of
letters in Yiddish? I remember of seeing such statistics about French
(the most common letters being e, s, a, r, t...) and am wondering if
some similar statistics exist for Yiddish.

Subject: Lipograms

I would like to know if some lipograms (i.e., texts with missing
letters, such as "La disparition" by the French writer Georges Perec-
who, by the way, might have been I.L. Perets' great-grandnephew -
which included no "e") have ever been written in Yiddish.

A dank in advance,

Estelle Souche
