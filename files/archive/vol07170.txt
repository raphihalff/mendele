Subject: kurve

Meyer-Leyb Wolf raises some interesting points [07.167:8] concerning the
etymology of 'kurve' [a question to which, I might mention in parentheses, my
nuts-and-sledgehammer trope was never applied]. The H/A suggestion was
intended as a suggestion. As I said, it is just what I have been inclined to
assume in the past without thinking about the question too much.  However, I
still believe that a 'proto-Slavic' origin is unlikely. If the derivation were
Slav, Preobrazhensky would not have to posit a tentative Old High German
source that he himself regards as dubious. Furthermore, were the word to be
found in Slav languages not themselves in contact with Yiddish, this would be
inconclusive, since a word once borrowed can easily be passed on, particularly
in the case of racy, slang terms. (The only Bulgarian dictionary I have to
hand does not list the word, but that is not conclusive either, of course).
Again, if 'kurve' were indeed pronounced [kurve] throughout Yiddishland, this
would tell us nothing, since it is not at all uncommon for words to be
borrowed from a language and returned at a later date or at another place. On
the other hand if [kirve] and [kerve] are attested anywhere this would go a
long way to substantiate my hypothesis. Did the Atlas questionnaire include
such indelicate topics or can some Mendelyaner with personal experience of
Galitsyaner low-life please enlighten us?

Subject: Leo Rosten's _The Joys of Yiddish_

I wish to respond to the startling revelation in Peter Gutmann's posting on
Leo Rosten (Vol 07.167 ) that _The Joys of Yiddish_ "is used it as a source
for information and, most of all, for quotes in academic papers on
Yiddishkeyt."  If this be true then _s'iz az okh un vey_ to the academics who
visited _Joys_ for anything other than to lament.  But why don't we hear from
the Yiddish scholars themselves?  Are you out there listening Dr.Mordkhe
Schaechter, Dr. Sheva Zucker, Zelig Bach, Sholem Berger, Eli Wiesel, Dr.Shikl
Fishman, Dr. Benyomen Hrushovski, Yosl and Chana Mlotek, Miriam Hoffman, Dr. 
David Fishman, Dr. David Roskies, Avrom Sutzkever, Motkhe Shtrigler, Yankev
Goldstein, Dr. Esther Himelshteyn and Leybl Botvinik?  How often have you or
any of your colleagues or students dipped into Rosten as a source of
information?

Subject: Sarah B. Smith

I am looking for information about the Yiddish writer Sarah B. Smith, beyond
what is available in the Leksikon fun der nayer Yidisher literatur and
Reisen's Leksikon.  Briefly, she was born in Hungary in 1888, and came to the
U.S. at the age of 15.  She wrote for the Forverts, Morgn-Zshurnal, Tog, and
others, and reported on courts and crime in NYC.  She also wrote in English,
including a play called Piper Paid and another play which was made into the
film My Sister Tisa.

I have not been able to find any information on her outside of the Leksikon
article, except for a few reviews; can anyone add anything to this?  Please
reply to the list and to brsteinb@ajhs.org. 

Many thanks.

Ben Steinberg

Subject: Mirele Efros

Steven Cassedy asked about the "shtekn" in Gordin's Mirele Efros.  Gordin's
script refers to Mirele's cane several times in the last act.  I don't recall
the film version but in all photographs that I have seen of the play's
performances Mirele is shown as an old woman with a cane. It is, in fact,
probably the most pervasive image of Mirele.

Tsi veyst emetser vegn interes in lernen yidish tsvishn di ba'aley tshuva arum

Does anyone know about interest in learning Yiddish among ba'aley tshuva
around the world?  Where can one find citations about such research?

Subject: Same sound, different meaning

I know there is a special term to designate two words which sound alike but
have different meanings.  And there probably are words in different languages
which sound the same but have a separate meaning in each language.  This is
probably true of Yiddish and other languages.  However, to find a complete
sentence in one language having meaning in another language is probably much
rarer.  I recall hearing many years ago such an example of a sentence which
when pronounced had a definite meaning, within limits, both in Yiddish and in
Spanish. Thus in Yiddish: Ah ki est un a meser, A cow eats without a knife. 
Spanish: Aqui esta una mesa. Here is a table. 

I wonder is anyone knows of other examples similar to the above which have
Yiddish as one of the sentences.

Subject: translating Yiddish phrases

I have forwarded Parshandoso's queries (07.164) to my favorite expert
<vayzusu@purimshpil.edu> and we can expect a reply almost momentarily unless,
of course, his computer is down until after Friday, the 13th, since he happens
to live in a walled city. 

In the meantime, I would caution all Mendelyaner, Mendelistn and abiver es hot
got in hartsn un a khush far humor NOT to send e-mail to my favorite expert,
lest the electronic powers-that-be take urgent umbrage. (And is that last word
derived from Middle High or Middle Low Aramaic? I must remember to ask
vayzusu.)

Subject: Adar

My father tells me that in der haym fleygt men zogn 'shvat tonye brat;  uder
tonye bruder'.(Or something like that.) It means Shvat in not a friend and
Adar is not a brother, a reference to the cold months.

Subject: expressions

My mother came from a shtetl Pavoloch near Kiev. She used many colourful
expressions. Here are two that I have not heard elsewhere: 1. "Odem a mentsch
un katchke rik zich" (This I understood as poking fun at someone who was
trying to act big or grand). 2. "Shoyn chasene gemacht"  (indicating something
that got used up very fast) Sound familiar to anyone?
