Subject: Shulamith Recording                       
 
In response to Maynard Wishner's question in [7.042]:
A 10" 33rpm recording  of Shulamith was issued by Tikva Records in 1954
under the # LP T-16. The artists are Fraydele Lipshitz and Raymond  
Smolover. There are eight songs interspersed with English narration.
 
There is a recording issued in Rumania titled Highlights of Goldfaden
Operettas with three songs from Shulamith. The performers are the
Orchestra and Choir of the Bucharest State Jewish Theatre.
 
Robert Freedman
 
[Note from moderator: There is at least one other recording issued by
Victor Talking Machine Co in 1910 under the title "Recitativ aus der Oper
Shulamith" (#63610) performed by Fraulein Steif and H. Duetsch on one side
of 10" 78 rpm disc.  -i.v.]

Subject: Drimplen

More on _drimplen_ (and on reference books).  In addition to Harkavy and
Weinreich, no home should be without a copy of Nahum Stutchkoff's _Der oytser
fun der yidisher shprakh_. Stutchkoff doesn't list _drimplen_ or any of its
variant forms in his index, but in section 283 ("Muzik"), the list of verbs
beginning with _shpiln_ includes:  labern [klezmer-loshn], verzen; fidlen, 
smiken, a fir ton mitn smik; grimplen, ripen, (sh)krimplen; rumplen, rimplen,
drimplen, klimpern, brumblen, brumken, bremzen; blozn; poykn, payklen,
drum(l)en, barabanyen, tarabanyen, drinzhen; fayfn; tsimblen; dreyen di
katerinke.

Subject: Electronic dictionaries

With reference to Louis Fridhandler's valuable suggestion [7.045:7], I might
mention that this topic was aired to some extent on the uyip list last
December. I hope those who subscribe to both lists will forgive me if I
share my thoughts with the wider khevre.
I altogether agree with LF that it would be nice to have Harkavy on CD, but
I think this is setting one's sights too low. After all, would so much
effort be justified for the marginal value of having an electronic version
as well as the hardback? What I think should be considered is an integrated
compilation of Harkavy, Weinreich, Spivak-Yehoyesh and now I imagine the new
Niborski which I have not yet been able to get hold of. [The Bibliotheque
Medem seems to have closed down for summer holidays.] If this were
successful, at a later stage material from the Groyser Verterbukh and
Stutshkof could be added.
One could envisage having both an on-line version and the periodic issue of
updated CDs.
Then one would need to have some procedure in place for ongoing addition and
amendment, possibly linked to a lexicographic forum either within mendele or
as an independent entity. Most importantly there would need to be a
moderator (perhaps the same person as the editor of the initial compilation)
to filter out the rubbish that would inevitably be contributed by nudnikes
and that could quickly vitiate the quality of the whole project.
Once the project was up and running, I imagine there would be many of us who
have been annotating our dictionaries by hand for decades (often
with illustrative quotations from representative authors) who could feed in
supplementary material.
The funding and copyright problems would be considerable, but not
necessarily insurmountable. In this way we might see within our own lifetimes
something equivalent to the realisation of the original Groyser Verterbukh
project but with the additional facility of machine searchability.

Subject: Arbeter-ring

Almost immediately after sending off my recent posting concerning the
inefficiency of the Workmen's Circle [7.044:6] I had second thoughts about
my possibly ungracious and querulous tone. At least that's how I felt until
private communications from other Mendelyaner started popping up on my
screen reporting similar experiences [Thank you, kind people!]. So paranoid
am I, that until that moment I was still searching my conscience as to
whether I might unwittingly have done something to offend them. 
Is this sorry state of affairs inevitable? One has to bear in mind that the
Workmen's Circle is the official distributor of YIVO publications. I have
been a paid-up member of YIVO for almost a quarter of a century. In the good
old days members received publications direct, but since distribution has
been "out-sourced" (no doubt, in the name of increased efficiency), it has
become quite a struggle to be sure of not missing issues. I have still not
been able to get my hands on copies of _YIVO-bleter_ (NS) 2 & 3. If loyal
members like myself have so much difficulty something must be gravely wrong.
If YIVO doesn't want to handle the distribution of its own publications,
can't it appoint a distributor that actually executes the orders it
receives? Just off the top of my head, what about the NYBC who are anyway
rapidly becoming the THE international centre for the dissemination of
Yiddish materials old and new?

Subject: drimpln

The word "drimpln" comes from a similar word KLIMPERN which means to strum or
attempting to play a piano.
