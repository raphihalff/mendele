as a galitsianer, i can tell you that the stereotypes *i*'ve
encountered are none of the ones you mention for ukies but
rather: primitive, ignorant, dirty, and fanatic. and, the
unkindest cut of all, full of daytshmerisms (shudder).

many singers have recorded it but one that's readily available
is by chava albershteyn. i'm usually not too crazy about her,
but i like her rendition of this song.

Subject: Country Yossi revisited

Yankel Kessler makes a good point, and I don't disagree
with him. He gives the example of a movie that was
enjoyable but still "crapola". I don't have any problem
saying that, for example, Sidney Sheldon is not "good
literature".  But that doesn't stop me from liking his
books.

I suppose it depends why we are discussing Country Yossi,
Rechnitzer Rejects, borscht belt Yiddish songs or any other
instance of Yiddish music.  I have not suggested Country
Yossi is "good music" in the sense of "good literature".  I
do maintain that it's entertaining, catchy, and enjoyable
to listen to, and I reacted strongly to the people who
seemed to be horrified that it even exists.

I might point out that the Yiddish used in Country Yossi's
songs comes out as very natural because it is -- it's a
reflection of a community where young people still speak
Yiddish.  Like it or not, the world of Boro Park,
Williamsburg and Monsey is the *only* world today where
Yiddish is still used by whole communities. As such, for
all the cultural sneering that goes on, it should be
recognized that the future of Yiddish as a communal
language spoken by Jews lies only in that world.

Subject: Introducing myself

Sholom:

My name is Max Stern, but don't let the name fool you: I
don't speak mamaloshen.  I know a few expressions, and I
can dope out a package label in Yiddish, but I am
definitely _NOT_ fluent.

On the other hand, I am very interested in knowing more,
and in the idea that this wonderful language should be kept
alive if at all possible.  That's why I joined this mail
group.

My Great-grandfather Samuel Joachim Stern was born in
Cracow and migrated to the Goldene Medineh in the 1840's.
I was born in 1939 in Cleveland, Ohio.  In between, ah,
what a world of difference.

Although I remember my great-grandparents Sam and Nettie
Toffler, who died when I was seven or eight, I don't
remember that they spoke Yiddish -- but I expect they
probably did.  The Tofflers arrived in the U.S. via
Austro-Hungary and Glasgow.

Religiously, I am sort of Conservative, trying to find my
ground between liberal and traditional.  I daven at the
Library Minyan of Temple Beth Am in Los Angeles.  I live in
Sherman Oaks, and work as a systems software developer at
NCR Corporation (formerly Teradata) in El Segundo,
California.

I sing in a Jewish chorus called Kol Echad Chorale, and we
frequently include Yiddish songs on our lighter programs.
"Sheyn Vi Di Levone" and "Bei Mir Bist Du Shoen" are our
favorite encores.  We have also sung less light-hearted
Yiddish pieces like "Partizaner Lid" and "Zog Nit Keinmol".

I am looking forward to increasing my Yiddish literacy in
this group.

Subject: Galitsianer (Alan Rutkowski)

I'm interested in learning more of the details concerning
stereotyping of Galician origin among non-Jews. Is there
literature in English? Galician Jews were certainly
stereotyped, but whether the details of the stereotype
among Jews and non-Jews correspond is a question still to
be answered. I cite a passage from the  the Introduction to
Volume 1 of the LANGUAGE AND CULTURE ATLAS OF ASHKENAZIC
JEWRY, (now available at your local newsstand) which
projects a series of specific substantive studies, to be
undertaken by anthropologists and linguists once the data
of the Yiddish Atlas become more easily accessible. They
include:
 
     c) Areas of Archaism in Jewish and Non-Jewish
Coterritorial Societies. An investigation of whether
Western Lithuania, southernmost Galicia (Carpathian
foothills), and other regions which are full of cultural
and linguistic relics among Jews manifest the same
conservatism on the non-Jewish social plane.
 
     k) "Verticalization" of Geographic Differences in
Culture and Language. A contrast in the prestige ranking,
by Jews and non-Jews of corresponding regions, of
originally geographic differences in behavior and speech,
and of the utilizaton of regional differences in the
"vertical"-social differentiation of coterritorial
societies. Sample question: Is Galician origin as much of a
social stigma for Poles or Ukrainians as for Jews? If not,
why not?

Subject: Lachoudisch   (to Bob Hoberman)
 
The Lachoudisch business keeps reemerging every so often as
a kind of sensational "archaeological" find. It makes the
rounds of world newspapers and each generation gets the
thrill of rediscovery. Something like the discovery of
crypto-Jews in Latin American jungles. I don't have
immediate access to the bibliographic references. Didn't
Dovid Katz include a piece on the subject somewhere
recently? I think it's what you say it is, a concentration
of vestiges, among non-Jews, of words deriving from Jewish
speech. The pronunciation of the name probably varies among
Lacho:dish, Lachoudish and Lachaudisch--which can be either
"holam"-derived or "kamats"-derived in Western Yiddish (for
example: Yiddish "broygez" and "xarote" have these
variants). I'm inclined to derive  Lachoudisch, a
non-Jewish designation, from the frequent designation,
among Jews, for their own language as something like
"loushnakoudish".
