Subject: Genghis Cohn

Just by coincidence, I picked up my copy of Gary's "The Dance of Genghis
Cohn" just before the two items on the book and TV version were posted.

I appreciate Zellig Bach's comments on what he feels is meaningful about
Judaism (and in fact I agree).  I believe him when he says that the TV
show gave a shallow representation of what it means to be a Jew.
However, I believe that neither he nor Louis F. were being fair to Gary's
work.

I can't supply a full review of the book yet, as I have just started
reading it.  (If there is interest I will supply one when I finish it.) I
can tell you that it was not Gary's idea (as LF has suggested) that for
any normal person being turned into a Jew would be a punishment.  The
person who is being punished by being turned into a Jew is an SS officer,
a committed Nazi, who was "cleansed" and has a position as a Police Chief
in postwar Germany.  Of course such a person would find it punishment to
discover that he was turning into one of the people that he so hated that
he tried to exterminate them.

At one level, the response of the people around our "cleansed" Nazi to
his "Jewishness" is a bitter reflection of the superficiality of German
"rehabilitation" after the war.

I can also report that Gary's work is not to be taken at its face value.
It is a bitter bitter black comedy.

Finally, when "The Dance of Genghis Cohn" came out, it got a host of
favorable reviews, from commentators ranging from well known
intellectuals to committed Jews to Israeli newspapers.

Subject: Shvarts-kheynevdike

Peter Kluehs asked (5.021) for the meaning of the word "hanevdike", found
in a poem fun Izi Kharik.

It seems very likely from the context ("di shvarts-hanevdike goye") that
the word starts with a "khes" rather than a "hey" and means "graceful".
The usual spelling would be "khes-nun" (the Hebrew root meaning "grace,
favour") plus an adjectival Yiddish ending.  Again, in this context, the
word "shvartz" may possibly echo the Song of Songs.

Subject: Denver Shpitol (Sanitarium)

The Denver Shpitol that Andrew Cassel asked about was the JCRS
Sanitarium, established in the early 20th century in what is now
Lakewood, a western suburb of Denver.  JCRS, or the Jewish Consumptives'
Relieft Society, was organized by a group of working men who were
frustrated with the policies of the other tuberculosis sanitarium in
Denver, National Jewish Hospital, which refused to serve kosher meals,
discouraged the use of Yiddish, and for a time (because of the fear of
being swamped by destitute patients) only accepted sufferers with
incipient tuberculosis and those who could afford to support themselves
once they left the hospital.  Leyvik was a patient at JCRS in the 1930's,
and I imagine your great-grandfather was there as well.

The organization and success of JCRS was due in large part to the efforts
of Dr. Charles Spivak, a local legend, and Yehoash (Solomon Bloomgarten),
who came to Denver to "chase the cure" in 1899.  Starting around 1906,
Yehoash presided over the Yiddish section of the 'Sanitorium,' a JCRS
publication, including his own poetry and that of "Lung-fellow" as well
as using graphics designed by the Bezalel School in then-Palestine.
(Spivak and Yehoash, lovers of Yiddish, are famous for their dictionary
of Hebrew elements in Yiddish).

I've started researching Denver's Yiddish history.  So far my search has
yielded the Yiddish sections of the 'Sanitorium' (which deserve to be
translated), and record books of the Arbeter Ring, Branch 957, from 1941
through 1962.  I also visited the Golden Hill Cemetery, also in Lakewood,
to find the graves of Dr. Spivak and David Edelstadt, another Yiddish
poet and an anarchist, who died of t.b. around 1892.  Edelstadt's grave
(a monument) was inscribed with one of his poems and a photograph of the
poet.  Spivak's grave was adjacent; Spivak donated his skeleton to the
Hebrew University. The upper part of the cemetery contained the graves of
the patients who didn't beat the "white plague;" many, unfortunately, are
marked only with small metal plaques, now unreadable.

The Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse has several poems by Leyvik,
including one entitled "Sanitorium" ("Efn Zikh, Toyer" in Yiddish).

As a final note, my zeyde, suffering from t.b. circa 1918, was invited to
recuperate at JCRS, which would have meant a long trek with family from
Syracuse, N.Y.  My bubbe nixed the idea; she didn't want to leave her own
mishpokhe and "live with the cowboys."

[Thanks to Jeanne Abrams, Director of the Rocky Mountain Jewish
Historical Society, for the information about JCRS.  For further
information, see her article in the Summer 1992 issue of the
Book-Peddler, entitled "The Magic Mountain."]

Subject: The name "Tevye"

In Mendele 5.022, Bernard Greenberg asks:

>> What is Tevye the Dairyman's name? For what name is
>> this a diminutive, via what language?

[All that follows is conjecture; I look forward to hearing from someone
who "really knows."]

In the Sholem Aleykhem printings that I own (all from US publishers), the
name is spelled tet-vet-yod-he.  A phonetic "Yiddish"spelling would use
tsvey-vovim in place of vet, and would not end in a he.  I assume from
the use of vet, and the placement of he in the final position, that the
name comes from Hebrew.

[In the Maurice Schwartz movie, the local Orthodox priest refers to Tevye
as Tevel.  And at the end of the prologue to the Tevye stories, Tevye
gives his Russian name and address to Pani Sholem Aleykhem as follows:
"Peredat gospodinu Tevelyu Molotshnaha Yevrey" (all phonetically spelled
in my editions).  I guess that this means something like: " ??? Mr. Tevye
the milkman and Jew," but I _obviously_ don't know any Russian or
Ukrainian.]

Hebrew versions of the Tevye stories, translated by Sholem Aleykhem's
son-in-law Berkowitz in the earlier part of the century, spell the name
tet-vov-vet-yod-he, or Tovyah, meaning "tov yah," or "G-d is good."
Certainly some Yiddish dialects would pronounce Tovyah as Toyvya, from
which Tevya is a short leap.

According to my Webster's, Tobias (Late Ecclesiastic Latin from
Ecclesiastic Greek) is precisely the same name as Toviya, or Tov Yah.

Other Jewish reference sources cite Tovyah as a name in use among the
Babylonian exiles.  The name is also found in Rabbinic sources, such as
Leviticus Rabba and the Talmud (Pesachim).

Per the Encyclopedia Judaica, Tobias as a surname is found in the 11th
century (a Karaite), and in various places in Europe and Eastern Asia
during the 16th - 19th centuries.

To what extent the name Tovya or Tevya was used in the shtetl among
Yiddish speakers, I have no idea.  Does anyone know of a reference in
print that discusses origins and use of Yiddish first  -- not Christian
:) -- names?
