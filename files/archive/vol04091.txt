Subject: Introduction

I'm new to the list, so I'm introducing myself. I'm a grad student in
linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, and I'm just
beginning the study of Yiddish, so I have very little to contribute to
discussions, but I expect to learn a lot just from eavesdropping.  My
research is on ethnic identity and language use, and I also do research
on Old English, so I guess this all fits together somehow in a Germanic
kind of way.

I do have one request: Where can I find an up-to-date source for Yiddish
use in the U.S., esp. at present? (I teach a course on language in the
US, and we discuss Yiddish among many others, but much of my material
seems out of date.)

Thanks

Subject: Yiddish Language tapes

To Eli Katz:

A set of tapes for use with College Yiddish was prepared by Jim Matisoff,
Department of Linguistics, UC Berkely--a neighbor of yours.

Perhaps Jim has a copy. His telephone number is (area code) Lahu Owl (Jim
divides his time between Lahu and Yiddish). If he doesn't own a copy, try
YIVO. The tapes were prepared for language lab use at the Columbia-YIVO
summer program, and for a while, YIVO was making the tapes available.
Write to Jessica Kligman.

Subject: Are they cognates?

Can one of the Mendele linguists tell me if Yiddish 'koyf' and English
'shop' are cognates?  I admit that at first glance the chance is remote,
but the Swedish equivalent of 'koyf' is koep (oe = o with two dots), and
is, I think, pretty obviously a cognate with 'koyf.' 'Koep' is pronounced
SHOEP (OE is like EE with mouth open in shape of small hole).  What I
know from a linguist friend is that Yiddish 'koyf' can be traced back to
Latin 'caupo' (small shopkeeper), and English 'shop' can be traced back
to Middle English 'shoppe' and Old English 'sceoppa.'  So is it just
coincidence that 'koep' (cognate with koyf) sounds so much like 'shop'?

Subject: der bingl

noyekh, do you know that bing crosby was called 'der bingl' in germany?
i'm asking because the -l diminutive is found only in bavarian,
apparently. also, do you or anyone else remember whether jews called him
'bingl' in the u.s.? i listened to the song again and the 'der' could
really be the andrews sisters' 'west indian' dialect version of 'their',
which would make just as much sense in the context--but 'bingl' sure
sounds like 'bingl'!

Subject: Correction

I won't sleep tonight unless I correct a typographical error in my
posting yesterday on the on-line electronic _LCAAJ_ Archives. In the
seventh paragraph, the sample interview question appeared yesterday as
follows:

               voser hobn yidn geredt?

The word LOSHN was inadvertently omitted. The question _should_
read thus:

               voser loshn hobn yidn geredt?

Subject: Briv-bruder [pen pal]

Allan Blair mentioned several times in Mendele the subject of
"feder-fraynt" [pen pals].  Max Weinreich, olev-hasholem, the eminent
historian of Yiddish, coined in his lifetime many necessary Yiddish terms
for various scientific disciplines, such as linguistics, sociology,
education, psychology, psychoanalysis, as well as general terms for
modern concepts. One of his latest coinages was "briv-bruder." for pen
pal, and was used in print for the first time in the journal _Yugntruf_
in December, 1968.  It has an alliteration, as pen pal in English,  (as
does Blair's feder-fraynt).

Briv-bruder is analogous to "shifs-bruder" [oceanliner brother], a
reference to a man with whom one crossed the ocean at the same time on
the way to America.

Ocean passages in the old immigration days often took many weeks and were
a true ordeal, a traumatic episode of many dimensions:  Dislocated from
family, home, and traditions, tantamount to having been uprooted from
one's very core, immigrants found themselves huddled in steerage, in
highly unsanitary conditions.  Food was as a rule inedible, but even if
they could eat it, they could not hold it down.  Sea sickness was all
around them. (Jewish immigtrants refused to eat the non-kosher meals, and
lived on bread they carried with them on ship, and hot water for tea.)

Throughout the voyage gnawing worries and fears would overtake the
passengers--fears whether the immigration papers will all be found in
order, whether one's health will be found acceptable to the medical
inspectors in Ellis Island, or whether, khas vesholem,  one would be sent
back to the port of embarkation.  These fears alternated with
unmeasurable hopes about "di goldene m'dine" (the golden land).

Such utterly new and unique experiences forged strong bonds among
passengers, to recall and retell, and Jewish immigrants started to call
each other "shif's bruder," the calque for briv-bruder.

One shortcoming of Weinreich's coinage: it is gender-limited.  I
recommend "briv-shvester" for correspondence with a woman.  While it is
not alliterative, as briv-bruder, it has the advantage of staying within
the familial kinship.

Subject: Bernstein's "Sprichwoerter"

Indeed there is a German reprint of the original Bernstein Shprikhverter
called _Juedische Sprichwoerter und Redensarten_, reprint by Fourier
Verlag, Wiesbaden, or Weiss Veralg, Dreieich, 1988.

I bought a copy in Germany a few years ago, it has yiddish on the left
page, with explanations and comments, and a german transcription on the
right page, with even more explanations. You can surely find it in the
Literaturhandlung, a bookstore in Berlin and Munich specialized in
Judaica.

Subject: Bay mir bist du sheyn

Following up from Martin Davis in Mendele 4.088, here's the
second verse:

Bay mir bist di git, bay mir host di "it,"
Bay mir bist di tayere vi gelt.

(Note:  Apologies to all Litvaks and klal-shprakh advocates; this
doesn't rhyme in Standard Yiddish.)

If I had the time to retrieve my Barry sisters recording, I could
fill in more of the blanks.

noyekh, don't go by MY memory--it ain't worth beans. i can't believe i
forgot the verse with 'hostu it', one of my all-time favorites! vos
geven iz geven, iz nisht do, as another song puts it...

Subject: Bei mir bistu shein/Papirossen

Bei mir bistu shein was written by J. Jacobs (lyrics) and Sholom Secunda
(music).  I have no date but it was surely before the Andrews sisters got
onto it.  I also have all the lyrics if you want them.

Papirossen was written by Herman Yablokoff.  Lyrics available by request.
It is a real tear-jerker!

Ich hob zei gefinen in an alter _fake-book_ mit a sach andere yidishe
lieder.
