Subject: Parisian Yiddish Writers in Yale French Studies #85 (1994)

Stories by two Yiddish writers active in Paris--Oser Warszawski and Wolf
Wieviorka--both of whom died at the hands of the Nazis, are translated in
volume 85 of "Yale French Studies" (1994).  The volume bears the
subtitle:  "Discourses of Jewish Identity in Twentieth-Century France."
Also included are numerous literary texts translated from French about
Jewish life and sentiment in France.

The volume can be consulted at most university libraries, or ordered from
Yale University Press at 1-800-YUP-READ.

I know so much about the volume because I was its special editor.

Subject: YIVO in Chicago?

I've seen references from time to time about YIVO events in Chicago, and
am wondering if there exists an actual organization.  I'd like to consult
some YIVO publications: "Filologishe shrifn", "Yiddishe filologye," etc.,
which unfortunately aren't available here (at the U. of Wis. library),
and want to know if these are available in Chicago or elsewhere in
striking distance of Madison.  Would appreciate any suggestions on how to
get quick and easy access to these materials--a sheynem dank in foroys.

Subject: Oyfn Boydem

Arre Komar asks about the words to this folk song, which Shostakovich set
in his song cycle "From Jewish Folk Poetry."  Here they are as printed in
Joachim Braun's essay "Shostakovich's Jewish Songs":

Af dem boydem shloft der dakh,
Tsugedekt mit shindelekh,
Un in vigl ligt a kind
Naket, gor on vindelekh.

Hop, hop, ot azoy,
Est di tsig fun dakh dem shtroy, oy! (x2)

Af dem boydem shteyt a vig,
Vigt zikh dort a shpin in ir,
Tzit fun mir dos khayes oys
Un dem dales lozt er mir.

Hop, hop . . .

Af dem boydem shteyt a hon,
Un zayn kam iz fayer royt,
Zol mein vayb khotsh far di kinder
Ergetz borgn a shtik broyt.

Hop, hop . . .

(In the music, the words "ergetz" and "borgn" are reversed.)  Joachim
Braun's excellent essay is published by the World Council for Yiddish and
Jewish Culture -- in English, Russian, Yiddish, and Hebrew (all in one
book!).

Subject: A Mendele Convention?

On Sun, 30, Oct 1994, Zellig Bach (4.159) passed on Noyekh Miller's
suggestion, "Maybe we should have a convention."  I thought it was a
great idea.  Ober, vi azoy kumt di kats ibern vaser?

We are a scattered crowd of over 600.  Where? When? Who? What?  The
newspaper reporter's basic questions apply to almost any kind of report
or to any kind of plan.  It certainly would apply to a Mendele
convention.

I have no experience in organizing any convention, let alone an
international meeting of such wide scope.  However, I volunteer to think
about it.  (Not much, but it's a start.)  Maybe local meetings among
locals could be the "dry runs."  Each small meeting may hammer out ideas
to propose to the shames who would select and publish.

Zellig Bach has already listed some basic needs: "overall theme, speakers
and panelists for the plenary sessions, workshop topics and leaders,
etc."

Zellig Bach's experience in the Yiddish world of letters and learning is
no doubt a rich source of ideas and inspiration.  Maybe a small East
Coast meeting drawing on his experience and talents should be planned
among those in that area.  We are probably too thinly scattered on the
West Coast to make a preliminary meeting among ourselves truly
productive.  Ober ver veyst?  A kashe oyf a mayse?

How about it?

I wish to thank publicly our khaver, Dr. Zellig Bach, for his hearty
recommendation of my book, _Yiddish and English: A Century of Yiddish in
America_ in Mendele Vol. 4 190.

There was actually a Second Printing of the book in 1987 but all copies
were sold out. If anyone wishes to take up Zellig's campaign for an
updated edition of the book, he or she may write to:
