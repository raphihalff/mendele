Very informative, thanks.  I definitely didn't know all that, esp. shtert
-> shtekht.  I didn't even know of retn = rescue, but I had thought of
the possibility of such a word.  Nevertheless, I wasn't sure to what
extent YIVO transcription was strict.  For example, we have 'farshemt'
meaning 'renowned' and 'farshemt' meaning 'ashamed' both transcribed
similarly (I presume) with no way of recovering the original.  I realize
that with 'redt' we have an easy way of distinguishing the two spoken
possibilities.  On the other hand, I understood transcription to make it
possible to more faithfully express dialect differences.  If this is so,
then writing 'the yid. for speak' as 'redt' would not be helpful; if
there were some dialect that actually did pronounce the 'd' in 'redt,'
the system would not allow us to show that distinction.

The answer to this 'what if' query may very well be that 'that does not
happen' or 'it's not worth allowing for that possibility in the interests
of the greater good.'  I presume that the answer is the second one and in
this case, the YIVO transcription rules don't follow (what I understand
to be) the general rule of transcription.

Subject: redt vs ret, un bistu vs bist du

I don't claim to be a professional Yiddishist however in a certain sense
I am a native yiddish speaker since it was my first language at home as a
child. I notice that when I speak I make a clear distinction between redt
and  ret. The former ending is slightly softer and more d-like than the
latter.  however when in comes to  bistu   it is a sharp clear t rather
than a d as in the more germanic (or should I say daytchmerish) bist du.

Subject: Writing morphemes

In my two postings about points and questions raised by Dovid and Meylekh
very late last  night, I was guilty of an oversight. I said, "Curiously
enough, there are instances in which the morphemic or lexical information
is not preserved in the writing. On this board I have seen "bistu" for
/bis du/ 'are you (fam.).' It also occurs in Yiddish script in the
equivalent way way: beyz-yud-samekh-tes-vov! the rendition "tu" must be
meant to reflect the lack of a contrast between /d/ and /t/ immediately
after /s/ and the impression that the consonant is more like a /t/ than a
/d/. (Leigh Lisker remarked on this in a posting some time ago . No one
responded.) Compared with the writing of "redt," this is paradoxical. Why
not preserve the information that it is the pronoun "du"?"

Instead of /bis du/ for the more explicit form of 'Are you (fam.)' I
should have written, of course, /bist du/. What must happen in running
Yiddish speech, not surprisingly, is that the final voiceless /t/ of
/bist/ is  assimilated to the initial voiced /d/ of /du/, given that they
are both articulated by the tongue tip at the ridge just above the upper
teeth (alveolar ridge). The same thing apparently happens in /host du/
'have you,' which is pronounced /hostu/ and is so written in Yiddish
script and thus in the YIVO spelling.

In her new textbook recently advertised here, Sheva Zucker introduces
these spellings  without comment, at least at first. Presumably, if I
were in her class and wrote /host du/ or /bist du/, either in roman or
Yiddish script, she would mark it wrong as an unconventional spelling. In
such instances, I wonder how Mikhl Herzog's comment about preserving
morphemic in formation, as in /redt/ rather than /ret/, is to be applied.

Subject: Bistu

Arn Abramson:

I'm not at all satisfied that I can provide as reasoned an explanation
for writing "bistu" as I was able to do for writing "redt" as against
"ret", "zingt" as against "zinkt". (As an aside, note that "bistu" has a
Litvish variant "bistE" with word- final stress, as in "un vu bistE
geven" 'and where were YOU?'.)

Two things come to mind: the first may simply be fortuitous, and may be
said to "permit" the accepted spelling; the second may, by some stretch
of the imagination, be said to underly it. I'm not happy with either as
"explanations" but, I offer them, off-the-cuff, as somehow, relevant.
I've never given the matter any thought before.

As for i: The spelling "bistu" is permissible and tolerable because there
doesn't seem to be any actually occurring ambiguity. There is no
distinction between "bistdu" and "bistu" to parallel that between "zingt"
and "zinkt".

As for ii (and this is more tortured), tell me first why you suggest that
the spelling "bistu" is "for the expression /bis du/" rather than for the
expression /bist du/, in which -t and d-have merged and assimilated as
[t] to the preceding unvoiced [s]. I don't disagree, but perhaps for
different reasons--unsatisfactory ones, maybe, but what the hell?

Aren't we dealing with a word that was historically "bis"? Thereafter
"bis + du", with the assimilation of "d" to the preceding "s", yielded
[bistu], but could as easily have yielded the litvish type *bizdu--do you
remember that for Uriel "the fact that" was "the [fagthat]"?

Ultimately, metanalysis of [bis+du] in Yiddish and in German produced
"bist" but left "du" (in this context [-tu]) unchanged, the consonant
serving two masters; in English, I am guessing, and in Dutch(?), on the
contrary, the pronoun gave up the consonant; thus "you"/"U".

In other words, writing "bistu", preserves the _historical_ morphology
represented by your writing /bis du/, even if it misrepresents the
synchronic morphology, the preservation of which dictates the distinction
"redt" and "ret".

Whew! Will you buy that?

Subject: Re: /bistu/

Arn Abromson recently discussed the pronunciation of /bistu/, which he
derives from /bis du/.  If this were correct I'd say that the /s/
devoices the /d/.  However, /bistu/ is really /bist + du/, and it's the
/t/ that devoices the /d/.

Subject: gemination ('doubling of consonants')

After composing my entry on double consonants, I reread it and took a
double-take, realizing that, as it stood, I was claiming what Arn
Abramson says I claim.  And after intuiting a bit and thinking back to
the Yiddish linguistic literature I've read that touches on the matter, I
was satisfied with my claim: normal spoken Yiddish has a phonological
(postlexical, if you will) rule of degemination.  Wherever you have two
like consonants meeting, pronounce the sequence as if there were only
one.  "madam meyerson" is syllabified as [ma.da.me.yer.son]; "onnemen" is
syllabified as [o.ne.men]. In "careful speech", a speaker might lengthen
the consonant for purposes of disambiguation or phonetically preserving
the integrity of each morpheme, but in casual speech, this is lost
categorically. This being the fact, the codifiers of the Soviet Yiddish
spelling system were able to go ahead and propose _orthographic_
degemination (within the word); the Soviet spelling is thus: o-n-e-m-e-n.

The following two sentences should illustrate that gemination is not
contrastive.  (It might be difficult to level out the intonational
differences between the sentences; but after you do bearing in mind
that this should be said in casual style, the two sentences should come
out equal.)

ay, onnemen dem shuster far a man?
ayo, nemen dem shuster far a man?
