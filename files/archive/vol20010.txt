Tayere Mendelyaner,

Hasia Diner (NYU) is collecting information on Jewish peddlars, and 
wonders if
Mendelyaners know of places she can search in Yiddish literature.

Subject: Internationale

I want to thank Leybl Goldberg for his response.  I already have that 
version of the song.
I am still looking for the version that starts with the lines I noted -

Der arbet iz der tags gezangen

Der ruh, der troime fun der nacht...

  Any help in this would be appreciated.

Subject: "A goy af dir"

Tayre Fraynd:

I am looking for the meaning of an unkind phrase that my mother-in-law 
would use when
someone coughed, not when they sneezed.  When they sneezed she would, of 
course, say
tsu gezunt, or gezuntheyt, but when they coughed she would say, "A goy af 
dir."  I have
no understanding what she meant by that. I know what the words mean, just 
not why
they were used.  Has anyone else used the expression, or heard it used, 
and can they say
what the origin and/or meaning is?
