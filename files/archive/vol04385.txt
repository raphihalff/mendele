Di gantse po

In response to Ruben Frankenstein's renewed request (4.378) for  H.
Leivick`s "Shloflid":

		Leyg dayn kop...

	Leyg dayn kop oyf mayne kni,
	gut azoy tsu lign,
	kinder shlofn ayn aleyn,

Subject: _Leyg dem kop af mayne kni_

Mikhl Herzog's post with the words to this viglid brought tears to my
eyes and a smile to my face.  My bobe had a black dog named Schvartzie.
When she sang _Leg dem kop af mayne kni_, Schvartzie would trot over and
put her head on my grandmother's knee, and remain still until Bobe
stopped singing.

Subject: Yiddish newspapers

Leibel Yelgin asks for possible repositories of Yiddish newspapers.  The
Jewish Collection of the New York Public Library at 5th Avenue and 42nd
Street has a vast accumulation of journals.  I have seen old Yiddish
newspapers there, and s uspect that if the articles he is seeking are to
be found anywhere, they might be found there.

Subject: Tundele/child's game

I am curious if anyone else is familiar with a child's game analagous to
"This Little Piggy" which is played in my family.  It goes like this:

   Parent grasping child's little toe "Tundele," then grasping next toe
   "Tundele," ..., grasping each toe and reciting "Tundele" in turn,
   (Then walking fingers up ankle and leg saying "Meezele, Mayzele," and
   tickling.

Also, what are the exact meanings of the words?  I'd always assumed that
tundele meant "toesy," but I cannot find it in my dictionary. A shaynem
dank,

Subject: A bilingual pun (Yiddish-Spanish)

On this morning's Kol Yisrael I heard a joke circulated in the days of
Golda Meir's premiership.  What do Chile and Israel have in common?
Answer: a yente.  I will leave it to our Hispanicists to decide how close
in sound is Yiddish _a yente_ to the Spanish family name _Allende_.  The
joke is sociolinguistically interesting in its intrepid Israeliness --
disrespect for authority and use of Yiddish for free and uninhibited
expression. This example can be easily added to. I offer this fragment
only, not wishing to burden our dear shames and wishing him _a refue
shleyme_.

Subject: The use of computers in Hebrew and Yiddish teaching

I have been asked by a yeshiva to assist them in their use of computers
for educational purposes. I was wondering whether anyone on this list has
any information on where I might be able to learn how computers are being
used in the teaching of both Hebrew and Yiddish subject material. I shall
greatly any input anyone may have.

Thanking you in anticipation,

Subject: Letter from Lithuania

Please forgive me if Mendele has already received this.  I am far behind
in my email reading, but I decided not to wait any longer to post this.
It is a letter that was sent to the Simon Wiesenthal Library in Los
Angeles, which was passed on to me by my new kalleh who works there.  I
will transcribe it below exactly as written (in English):

Dear -----
We know about your interest in the life of Jewish diaspora in Lithuania.
May be you have heard, our Jewish newspaper "Jerusalem de Lita" has not
appeared for more than half a year, due to the bankruptsy of the JSC
"Lithuanus" publishing house.

The Jewish community of Lithuania thinks it necessary to resume the work
of editing and publishing the monthly newspaper in Yiddish and in
English. When the newspaper will appear again, success of resuming this
newspaper, depends on the number of our future subscribers (that is on
your decision as well).  We think we shall be able to publish the
"Jerusalem de Lita", if the interested persons (including you, your
friends, etc) subscribe for a year ($50).

We would be very grateful to you for your answer, and, in the case of the
subscription, we would like to know which version you prefer--the Yiddish
or the English one.

We also highly appreciate if your additional support by donation the
newspaper publishing.

Please answer us to the following address:

Attn. J. Levinson

Subject: Radio program in Perth Australia

My colleague David Hoffman has started a weekly radio program on a
community public radio. He is appealing for items of cultural interest
that would be appropraite for a younger Jewish audience. Do subscribers
to Mendele, (particlarly those in Australia) have suggestions as to
sourcing suitable news/magazine items for such a program?
