We do them all the time at home.  It's an automatic byproduct of
switching back and forth between two languages all the time.

This is the kind of stuff that caused Noyekh to despair of my
original mail.yiddish mailing list and create MENDELE.  At the risk
of offending the literati, here's a sample:

What do you get when you cross a chicken and a rabbit?
Nisht a hin, nisht a hare.
What do you call a bedbug in a test tube?
A vants in a vial.

I have lots of this kind of stuff on the old mail.yiddish archives.
If anyone wants them, drop me a line.  (There were 53 issues.)

Just a note to Dan Leeson....

Did you ever hear of the old (not very complex) joke:

What do you get when you cross a chicken with a rabbit?

Answer:  NISHT A HIN, NISHT A HER
         (the play on "hen" and "hare")

The Yiddish Wrong-way Corrigan was a comic strip in a a New York
Yiddish daily in the teens ands trwenties. It was very popular and
reached the Yiddish readers of Poland as well. It was another in a
long line of descriptions of ineptitude that Yiddish relishes.
Someone who is beyond shlimil and shlimazal and does everything
backwards. It was a favorite expression of many.

Subject: lekish ber

as i eagerly await the answer to dan leeson's query about moyshe
kapoye(r?), i'd like to add a question about another 'personality'
who was alive and well in my house: lekish ber. he would make his
appearance when someone rang the doorbell and someone inside would
yell out 'who's there?'--someone else inside would invariably answer
'lekish ber'.

Subject: crosslinguistic jokes

there was one oft-told joke about a girl who has a very 'american'
suitor who was freaked out when he overheard the girl's mother
telling someone in the kitchen to 'shit in the pot', meaning to pour
[something] into the pot.

btw, in my house, the line often uttered to dawdlers during poker
games, 'shit or get off the pot', was (folk?-)analyzed as meaning
LITERALLY 'put in your money or fold', where _shit_ was taken to be
yiddish shitn 'pour' and _pot_ was taken in its sense of 'pile of
money consisting of the antes and bets'. thus it was technically not
vulgar but of course always evoked giggles.

another giggle-evoking crosslinguistic line was my father's _azoy
geyt di yorn_, which he pronounced 'azoy geyt di yurn', homonymous
(for him) with english _urine_. now that i think of it, i don't know
why it was _geyt_ and not _geyen_. any explanation? (he was truly
fluent and literate in yiddish, btw.) could this be an instance of
lack of number agreement with postposed subjects? (i came across a
number of clear examples of this when i was working on postposed
subjects, using olsvanger's _royte pomerantsn_ as my corpus.)

and, finally, there was the line _a ki (= ku) est un (= on) a mese
(= meser)_ 'a cow eats without a knife', which, in our central
yiddish, was supposed to sound just like spanish _aqui esta una
mesa_ 'here is a table'. there was also a line that was supposed to
mean something in french and that was something like _avu tut ir a
vey..._ but i can't reconstruct it. (azoy geyt di yurn... :) )

Subject: Jews and numbers

There is a tradition (is it a minhag? or halakhically documented)
among Ashkenazic Jews not to count members of a community. For
example when counting people present for a minyan, one would say
"nit eyns, nit tsvey" etc. Or recently I read one of the problems
Jews had with the German Authorities during the Age of Enlightenment
was that the state wanted to know the size of the communities, the
exact number of members they had, and Jews had a hard time
explaining they would not give such an information. Does anybody
have any information on the origin of that custom. Are there any
other traditions linked with numbers?

Thanks for helping
