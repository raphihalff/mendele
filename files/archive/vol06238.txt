Subject: _In Polish Woods_

A friend has asked me to pass on a question about a Yiddish movie
titled _In Polish Woods_.  It was apparently based on a novel about
the Kotzker, which protrays him in a very unfavourable light.  When it
was released in Varshe in 1928, khsidim supposedly rioted in the
streets. There is also some source which claims that someone from the
Aguda "censored" it, and/or got the film-maker to remove a scene which
was especially offensive to traditional sensibilities (I don't know
whether before or after its initial release).

Does anyone know anything more about the film?  Is it extant?  If so,
where is it to be found?

Thanks.

Eliyahu Juni

_There Once Was a Vilne_ -- this is a collection of Vilne stories --
the author is Avraham Karpinovitch - an Israeli, but a Vilne native
from a family that ran a yiddish theater in Vilne.

Today there is a city named Vilnius -- and this is not only a question
of realpolitik --Vilnius and Vilne are very different.

Vilne was -- Jerusalem of Lithuania, hometown of the Vilner Gaon, of
Abba Kovner, Hirsh Glik, Shmerke Katcerginski, of YIVO, of a broad,
rich Yiddish life and culture, of wonderfully smart people - a
community exterminated by the Nazis and their vicious antisemitic
Lithuanian and Polish collaborators.

Vilnius is the capital of modern Lithuania. Period. Paragraph.

What do I want to say with this as relevant to Yiddish?  That it is
not only a question of spelling -- or simply variants -- it speaks to
two completely different "creatures".

Subject: Yiddish-English Version of "Reyzele"

Does there exist an Yiddish-English performing version of Gebirtig's
"Reyzele"?  We would very much like to find or create one for use by
our Vancouver based band "Macedonian Mazl-Tov".

I know that many people may consider such versions to be shameless
bastardizations of the Yiddish.  However, we have found that when we
perform a theatrical piece like "Reyzele" in front of a general
audience, the words are lost on the listeners (even if we include a
translation in the program notes or preface the performance with a
synopsis). On the other hand, an Yiddish-English version keeps the
audience interested and involved, while retaining a flavour of the
original language.

How do Mendele subscribers feel about mixed language versions?

Subject: Ende oysiyes

I was last week in a second hand bookshop and came across a collection of
works by Bergelson in Yiddish. On opening the book my eyes were dazzled and
I immediately noticed that the reason for this was that all the end letters
had been replaced by normal ones.

Was there ever a movement to remove the end letters from the Yiddish
orthography? And if so, why?

A khitspe to dare mess with the beloved ende tsadik!
