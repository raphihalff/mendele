Subject: yidishe hagode

I mailed my personal Yiddish Haggadah to Arieh.
My Haggada is a compilation of Yiddish-Englesg and Hebrew Haggados
puplished by the 'Workmens Circle', 'Farband'
and 'Gr. Washington Yiddish Clubs" (in 1998).

If Yiddish Clubs still need a Yiddish Haggadah, please, write to Arieh
and he will send you a copy.

Have a nice Passover.

The Arbeter Ring in N.Y. issued a number of New Hagodes in Yiddish, filled
with song and modern Yiddish poetry and excerpts from the Yehoash Tanakh.
The narration/story line was more or less politically honed depending on the
times. In the 60's they began to include lengthy English translations. As
time went of, the Yiddish content was diminished both in quality and
quantity. Years ago, when I worked for the Education Dept. of the A"R, I saw
a collection of these hagodes but don't know if it's still there.

Can one get a copy of the Hagode issued by the Bund in 1900. I'd very much
like to have it.

How about a leech?

I am of the opinion that it is derived from 'shnoddering' which in turn
comes from the Hebrew, 'She-Nadar' to make a pledge.

I think the image is right, insofar that the 'shnorer' is always coming back
for more.

However, 'moocher' is actually not bad.

Subject: Re: shnorer

I think myself that schnorrer may be pejorative for beggar, having a taint
of mockery and ridicule, when telling jokes or satirizing people less
fortunate than oneself, or those who ride high, like Benya Krik of Odessa on
the wagon of plenty [gangster-style], but I have used it as it were
objectively for beggar in a tale that was published in MIDSTREAM in the
latter '90s, part of a collection I am making.  I used it, not beggar,
because the tale is involved with what Chaucer says in the Preface to the
CANTERBURY TALES, "radix malorum est cupiditas."

Subject: shnorer/schnorrer

The American Heritage Dictionary lists _schnorrer_ (slang) 'One who
habitually takes advantage of the generosity of others; a parasite'.
[Yiddish_snorer_ 'beggar', 'sponger', from _shnorn_ 'to beg', from Middle
High German _snurren_ 'to hum', 'whir' (from the sound of musical
instruments played by beggars)].

GEY VEYS!

Subject: Re: shnorer

Hershel Bershady's query about a suitable English translation for "shnorer"
(Mendele 13.018) yet again demonstrates the traduttore/traditore conundrum.
I haven't been able to come up with a single word that is better than
"moocher" (though I, too, am dissatisfied with "moocher"), but we shouldn't
forget that shnoren iz a beruf. The shnorer is singleminded in his pursuit
of a handout, in the same way that a businessman is consumed with running
his business. The parasite of classical antiquity, famous from comedy and
satire for finagling his way into the banquets and business affairs of the
rich, comes to mind as the closest parallel. Alas, the meaning of "parasite"
to most Americans today is a microorganism, but in its classical sense the
word makes an excellent translation for "shnorer."

Subject: Re: yovn

I had heard the derivative concept of someone boorish,clumsy and aggressive
in the expression - er iz arayngefaln vi a yovn in suke - which
interestingly enough is not in Schtutchkoff's "Oytser".

I think also there is an interplay between Yovn - the Greek and the name
Ivan - in fact, I remember one of our mitlshul lerer expounding on that
point. Jews used many loshn-koydishdike convolutions so that the general
gentile population, who had maybe picked up some Yiddish, would not
understand.  Yovn, was one such. Lomir makhn mit di reglayim - would be a
circumlocution for - let's get out of here. It was a common practice.
