Subject: Re: James Cagney's Yiddish

Al Grand's post about James Cagney's fluent Yiddish (learned on the streets
of Yorkville where he grew up) reminds me of my long fruitless attempt to
discover the identity of the Yiddish actor who plays opposite him in the
1932 film "Taxi!" He is not identified in the film credits, nor was I able
to find any reference to him on IMDB, J. Hoberman's "Bridge of Light" or in
any volume of Zylberzweig. Anyone? BTW: Cagney also snuck some Yiddish into
his 1933 film "The Mayor of Hell" (1933)

Cagney, in his eponymous autobio said of an all-Yiddish poster advertising
"Taxi" "...I was one of the few, if not the only Irish actor able to read
this Jewish-directed poster." His Yiddish helped him immeasurably with his
always contentious relationship with his bosses the Warner Brothers (he
noted they would slip into Yiddish during negotiations with
non-comprehending non-Jewish actors/actresses. Needless to say, this ploy
failed miserably with Cagney.)

Subject: Yiddish Geography: "Rayzn"

There is a phrase sometimes found in sidurim and makhzorim "ke-minhag Lite,
Zamot un Rayzn."  Lite is Lithuania (more or less) and Zamot is Samogitia.
Could someone give me a definition of the borders of "Rayzn"?

Subject: Re: pareve

[In reference to Alan Astro's citation, Mendele 14.016, of a possible link
to the French 'pareil'.]

The Westyiddish equivalent of pareve is menikh (from monakhos -- monk).
Neither fleishik nor milkhik (fleishtik and milkshtik in Alsace) is like
neither male nor female -- the status of a monk.

If pareil or derivative was used like pareve or menikh in Judeofrench or
Westyiddish, it was lost long ago without a trace.

Subject: Re: prost un grob

Not every use of "grob" is pejorative, as several correspondent have stated.
How about "grobe zalts," the kind of salt required in kashering meat?  There
it simply describes the size of the salt crystals, with no negative
connotations at all.

I hesitate to disagree with my friend Michael Meckler (Mendele 14:15), but I
think his grandmother's reference to "grobe lokshn" might well have been, at
least in part, of the same type.  Wide noodles are better for some dishes,
thin ones for others; lokshn kugel would be very dense if made with thin
lokshn, while wide ones tend to slide off your soup spoon.  And wide noodles
are chewy only if they're undercooked. :-D

[Not to mention grober finger which, in Yiddish at least, is thoroughly
innocuous.]

Subject: Re: Is it a Yiddish idiom?

In answer to Todd Hasak-Lowy's query [Mendele 14.011]: Yes, the phrase "like
a mouse rescued from a pitcher of milk" is based on a Yiddish idiom.

The issue is slightly complicated by differences between the first version
of _Benjamin III_ (1878), the Hebrew version (first published in 1896), and
the final Yiddish edition that was published in Abramovitsh's lifetime
(1911).  Hillel Halkin's English translation is, for the most part, based on
the 1878 text; however, he used both the 1911 version and the Hebrew for
Chapter 14 and the Epilogue.

The opening paragraph of Chapter 14 in English, Hebrew, and Yiddish (1911)
is from the last part of Chapter 13, top of p. 95, in the Yiddish of 1878.
Halkin's English phrase "like a mouse rescued from a pitcher of milk" is
translated from the Hebrew _ke-akbar mutzal mi-kad halav_, in turn based on
the Yiddish _vi a moyz vos men nemt aroys fun a ladeshke zoyermilkh_.

What do the Mendele Yiddish language meyvinim have to say about the
untranslated word "ladeshke"?

Subject: Re: Construction with 'ton'

Regarding Yakov Blum's query [Mendele 14.015]:

While I can say nothing about the "acceptability" of the construction in
Yiddish, the usage is to be found in German : it is not considered "good
style", has a slightly childish or humorous ring, but "tun" with an
infinitive may be a matter of deliberate choice as it introduces  a definite
shade of meaning : "Ich tu dich lieben" is a timid way of avoiding the more
assertive "Ich liebe dich" (contrary to English, where it creates emphasis :
I do love you.)

As for the use of "ton" in the song "Dona, dona" - <bidne kelber tut men
bindn >,- to my mind this is used primarily for rhythm and rime; but maybe
"tut men bindn" also implies an action protracted in time, an aspect which
would be absent if one said "bindet men" ? The same would then also be true
of Manger's lines, "tu ikh lign" and "tu ikh batsoln"?  I'd be interested to
hear other views on this.
