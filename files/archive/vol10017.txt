Subject: komerne

Does anyone on this list recognize the term "komerne"? It is used in a
context which makes it likely that the word is Yiddish or Polish. The
speaker is being driven out of her house in 1840 Brisk and says that she
will not take pictures from the wall because she has no need for them in
the "komerne". Any thoughts?

Thank you in advance.

Subject: yizkor books

I am delighted with the recent discussions of yizkor books on Mendele
as I have more than a passing interest in these remarkable books.

I am the JewishGen Yizkor Book Project Manager, known to Leonard
Prager (who has contributed some notable translations to our site)
but perhaps not to many of the readers of Mendele.  At last count we
had 215+partial and complete translations of yizkor books online.  We
add about 10 new books  each month and a like number of updates.
Most of the projects are "works in progress" as we encourage donors
not to wait until the entire book is translated but to put it online
chapter by chapter.

We shortly will have online a new translation which will be a side by
side presentation of the original Yiddish and the English
translation.  Leonard made an oblique reference to this project a few
days ago as the two of us had been discussing the technology of
preparing the dual language pages.

Our translations are located at
http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/translations.html and the explanation
of our procedures is at  http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/donation/ .
We encourage you to visit the web sites and to consider translating a
yizkor book to make it accessible to people who cannot read it in the
original language(s).

Subject: kal'e vern; bulakh

Milt Koosman's attempt to explain "kale (=spoilt) vern" by relating the
adjective to "kale"(=bride) is an unforgivable blunder, as the two words
never even sounded alike - they are what linguists describe as a minimal
pair with a "hard" /l/ and a soft (=palatalized) /l'/. Both are of Hebrew
origin, but of distinctly different roots. True, both contain the same three
letters [kaf-lamed-hey], but in "bride" the lamed has a dagesh and should
therefore be transliterated with doubled LL (KALLA), while its counterpart
is KALE (=perishable). In Yiddish the phonetic distinction was preserved in
a different contrast.

I often heard the disparaging epithet "bulakh" in my childhood spent in a
shtetl in Belarus - it is synonymous to "goilem". As for the pogromist with
a similar sounding name, the connection is tenuous to say the least. To
begin with, "bulakh" was obviously well rooted in common usage, which would
not be the case if it was an allusion to some little-known personage;
moreover, the first part of the pogromist's name was not "Bulakh" - his name
was "Bulak-Bulakhovsky".

Subject: Orl

I recall an incident about 15 years ago that transpired in the Satmar
Bays-Medresh in Montreal. I was in the middle of a heated argument, in
Yiddish, about Zionism with one of the yeshiva-bokhrim, when he noticed an
elderly janitor working nearby. The bokher signalled to me to cease the
conversation and said, in loshn-koydesh: "Orl mayvn kol dover" (In modern
Hebrew, "Arel mayvin kol davar." In English, "the uncircumcised one
understands everything." That is, this particular French-Canadian janitor,
having worked in the Satmar environment for many years understood Yiddish,
and the bokher had the rare sensitivity to feel that an argument about
Jewish matters was something he should not hear. Of course, he did not say
"Goy, or sheygetz, mayvn kol dover" since those terms for a gentile are well
known, unlike orl.

I wonder how common this expression was in the non-haredi Yiddish world?

Subject: Getsl; pamelekh; shmontses

1. Getsl is the Yiddish derivative of Gotschalc 'God's servant'. NO relation
to Gershon.

2. Pamelekh is a Yiddish "blend" of Slavic-origin _pomalu_ and German _allmaelich_.

3. _shmontses_ 'rumors' is ultimately derived from Ashkenazic Hebrew _shmuoys_
through the nasalization of _ayin_ (as in _maynse/maanse_, _resha(y)nte_, etc.

I have two words to say: Oops, sorry! (I guess I shouldn't have shot from
the hip...)

Subject: Yiddish children's ditty?

Dawn Ash (10.016) asked about the ditty:

     Saku navu ranu
     Kachkih navu drilla
     Dimetele (x5 or so).
     (Generally followed by the Yiddish "kitzl kitzl")

A friend of mine says something like this:
(Pretend to spit three times in the palm of the child's hand, then
brush it away, then draw circles on the palm with the speaker's
forefinger, saying:)
Siroka varana titumkasha navarila stanovila napopitchka
(Pull on each of the five fingers of the hand, saying):
Mizele mayzele mizele mayzele kitz kitz kitz...
(Run hand up to chin, tickling.)

My interpretation of the words is something like (someone) put kasha
on the stove and cooked it.
Perl Sapoznik had a similar version of this, too.
This has a captivating effect on small children.

Subject: Yiddish children's ditty

The Yiddish 'ditty' is 'Soroka Vorona.'

It is from Russian, and is a rough equivalent to 'this little piggy went to
market,' except it uses birds, like the magpie (soroka) ands the raven (vorona)
in the rhyme.

I have all the Russian words and their translation and transliteration, if you
like.
