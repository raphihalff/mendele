Subject: Diminutive plural -lekh

Khevre,
        Does anybody have a good etymology for the
diminutive plural ending -lekh, as in fiselekh, hentelekh?
In other words, where does the velar spirant come from?

        By the way, has anyone ever seen my 1979 book,
Blessings, Curses, Hopes, and Fears: psycho-ostensive
expressions in Yiddish? It has passed virtually unreviewed
these many years.  I have a few copies I can let you have
wholesale.

Subject: YIDDISH CONFERENCE IN JERUSALEM

I wonder whether any Mendele readers/contributers who
attended the recent Yiddish conference in Jerusalem would
be willing to report on it?

Dear MENDELE, Did I miss this attribution? viz., The
schlemiehl drops his butte red toast,because he is that;
the shlimazl drops his buttered toast, but it alw ays lands
buttered side down.

Ellen, I think you deleted a word from your text by
accident because I didn't understand your point about
shlemiel, shmendrik, nar, khokhem, shmegegi.

I, as an American who's been exposed to shlimazl in Yiddish
and English and shlemiel in English have the same feeling
as you regarding their respective meaning:  the former has
no luck in life and the second is a 'poor slob'. Note,
though, that two of the other fools you mention are also
American creations:  shmendrik and shmegege.  (Actually,
I'm not so sure about the latter, because Stutchkoff lists
a similar form, _shmegde_ in the combination _shmegde mit
esik_, but re the former, we know who coined the word!  [I
wish I remembered who the coiner was and where I know this
from;  my argument will remain weak till I find out.])
Sure your family used these, as did many families in
America.  Apparently, and not surprisingly, America has
brought numerous forms together which were not current in
one and the same region in the Old Country, or non-existent
in the Old Country.

I learned a similar fact just recently:  here in the US we
wish parents of a newborn zey zoln derlebn tsu firn dos
kind tsu der khupe, or zey zoln fun im/ir derlebn a sakh
nakhes, or, the formula I used (and had no idea where it
came from:)  ir zolt fun im/ir derlebn yidishn nakhes.  It
turns out that specifying _yidishn_ nakhes comes from the
German Jews/speakers of Western Yiddish.  I had surely
never heard this blessing from one of them but from my ilk,
Jews of Eastern European descent.  The Western Yiddish
blessing merged with the one used by the mizrekh-yidn and
now we all, in Ashkenaz III, use it.

a gutn!
