Subject: Slavic influence on Yiddish syntax

Re:  Ellen Prince's suggestion (6.165) that Slavic usage may have
affected the tenses in indirect Yiddish speech, i.e. "Er hot mir gezogt
az er iz krank":

Actually, that usage must have originated in German, which still
practices it today (like Yiddish and the Slavic tongues).  The sole
difference is that in German you have two choices:

the more bookish subjunctive:  "Er hat mir gezagt, dass er krank _sei_"
or:  "Er hat mir gesagt, er sei krank.

the more colloquial:  "Er hat mir gesagt, dass er krank ist."

The rule in German is the same as in Yiddish, most Slavic languages, and
some medieval English:  the tense of indirect discourse is the same as
that of direct discourse (except that, as I've said, literary German
puts the tensed verb in the subjunctive.

The modern English practice is the same as that of the Romance
languages, and I suspect that it may have been taken over from French:
"He said he _was_ sick" = "Il a dit qu'il _etait_ (past imperfect)
malade".

Yiddish has far, far fewer tenses than German and certainly than English
or Romance, so it has to husband them very carefully.

Subject: Slavic influences on Yiddish syntax

The use of zikh for first and second persons as well as third is not
universal in Eastern Yiddish -- many native Yiddish speakers use the
accusative and dative forms of the personal pronouns, e.g. "Ikh vash
mikh". So if Slavic influence is at work here, how come it affects some
speakers but not others? Moreover, while the universal zikh users are
quite happy with 'er hot zikh gekoyft a hoyz', Polish has 'kupil sobie
dom' = er hot im gekoyft a hoyz -- so even in the third person "Slavic"
doesnt always provide a model for undifferentiated zikh.

It strikes me that the appeal to Slavic influence in the case of zikh
raises more questions than it answers.

Subject: Slavic influence on Yiddish syntax

In regard to the issue of Slavic influence on Yiddish, there's one
area in which Slavic affected Yiddish by _reenforcing_ the latter's
syntax rather than altering it--specifically, the second position of the
verb.

Both Yiddish and German tend to put the verb in second place
within a main clause.  But when asking a question without an interrogative
word, the two languages go their separate ways:

German:  "Sprichst Du russich?" (= "Do you speak Russian?") The tensed
verb is in_first_ place.

Yiddish: "Tsi redtste rusish?" The tensed verb is in _second_ place
because Yiddish requires the word "tsi" at the start of such a a
yes-or-no question.

Tsi, however, is part of the Slavic component, cognate with "czy" in
Polish and parallel with "li" in Russian:  "Li govorish po-rusky?

(In German you can ease the abruptness of the question by adding an
non-translatable adverb like "etwa" or "denn" or even "eigentlich" after
the pronoun:

"Sprichst Du denn russisch/Sprichst Du eigentlich russisch?" But the
verb remains in first place.

I find it mesmerizingly bizarre that a Slavic borrowing actually helped
Yiddish _maintain_ its syntactic character.

A connected issue is the inflection of a question: In an English
question, the voice always goes up:  "Where are you going?" but in
German the voice rises only if there is no interrogative word:

"Wohin gehst Du?"  The voice goes down on the last word, but "Sprichst
Du denn russisch?"  The voice does up.

In Yiddish, the voice seems to go up at the end of every question, but I
wonder if there are regional differences. Can any natural speaker tell
me if any question in any Yiddish dialect has a downward inflection?

Subject: From Yiddish to other languages

Not only do the missionaries work by translating their texts into
Yiddish, but they have also bothered, in times past, to translate
Yiddish texts, mostly into Latin, in order to better understand the
beliefs of the poor benighted Jews.

Golda Werman, my wife these many years, writes about this phenomenon in
two chapters of her book _Milton and Midrash_, 1995 [I dare not give
more details.  Otherwise this posting will be rightly placed in one of
the Notices issues]. She deals with the 17th century translation of the
_Tsena Rena_ into Latin at length and other works more briefly.
