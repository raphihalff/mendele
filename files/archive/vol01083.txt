This reminds me that my mother, who is from Poland, used to
make a dish called "gallah," (rhymes with khallah) which is
calf's foot jelly.

Subject: Vowel differences for Galitsianer pronunciation

It took me a while to reconcile Yiddish spelling with
bobe's and zeyde's pronunciation in galitsianer yiddish, as
well as the so-called "sepharidishe" Hebrew davening.  Here
are the differences I have observed, all in vowels:

YIVO Vowel          Standard (litvish)          Galitsianer
---- -----          ------------------          --------------------
a    patakh-aleph   English short a             same
o    kometz-aleph   "aw" as in law              "oo" as in pool
                                                (and kometz is
                                                pronounced "koometz")
y/i  yud            between short i and long E  same
e    ayin           "e" as in led               same
ey   yud-yud        English long A              varies: long A or I
ay   yud-yud-patakh English long I              varies: long A or I
u    vov            "oo" as in pool             i or ee
oy   vov-yud        "oy" as in oy vey           same

Thus, in Galitsianer, "nokh a mol" is pronounced "nukh a
mul" (using YIVO transliteration). Similarly, "du bist do"
(you are here) is pronouced "di bist du".

I have heard the Galitsianer pronunciation in Hebrew
refered to as "davenen sephardish".  An example is "burikh
atu" instead of "borukh ato", and "v'imeri umayn" instead
of "v'imeru omeyn".  If you want to hear a native speaker
do this, listen to the rabbi in the final scene of the
movie, "A Fiddler On The Roof", in which he is chanting the
kaddish, and you'll hear "v'imeri umayn".

Perhaps due to the effects of Litvish assimilation on my
grandparents' pronunciations, I find no consistency in
differences between yud-yud and yud-yud-patakh variations.
If I consistently pronouce a patakh-less yud-yud as either
ey or ay, it does not match the way they spoke, and the
standard spelling seems to match most of the time.

The New York Yiddish dailies never used a yud-yud-patakh,
which I conjecture is due to the many differences in
pronunciation of those vowels by readers. Thus, you can
hear (using the YIVO vowels) at least three of the
following:

	fleysh mit beyner
	fleysh mit bayner
	flaysh mit beyner
	flaysh mit bayner

Another difference in pronunciation that I have noticed is
an interchange of "oy" and the Hebrew long O "oh", as in
the following:

	Standard Yiddish	My Grandparents
	----------------	---------------
	moyl (mouth)		mohel (rhymes with "coal")
	mohel (circumcisor)	moyl
        boykh (belly)           bohekh ("oh" is long O, and
                                        two syllables)

Again, I have heard this combined with the other
Galitsianer changes in Hebrew prayer, as "ho-ohlam" coming
out as "hu-oylem".

These are personal observations, and I'd appreciate a
pointer to a reference that codifies these differences.
