Dear Mendelists:

Does anyone know where I can buy children's videotapes in Yiddish? I am
looking for tapes which are good for toddlers and chldren (like Sesame
Street in English, and Rehov Sumsum in Hebrew), but in Yidish. I am not a
hasid, but Torah stories could be okay , and also secular shows. 

I have already been to Lakewood, NJ, and bought several picture books for my
2.5-year-old. But, I think, most of the books are concerned with Hasidic
matters.

[Moderator's note: Several games suitable for toddlers can be found in
Shtetl's children corner, e.g. http://metalab.unc.edu/yiddish/School/Bpgame
or http://metalab.unc.edu/yiddish/School/Cardgame
Three picture books by Chaim Beyder: Alef Beys, Yidishe Retenishn, and
Yidishe Folks-Vertlekh (online editions by Shura Vaisman) are available as
well at http://metalab.unc.edu/yiddish/School/chlib.html           -i.v.]

Subject: Lomir Yehoyesh romanizirn

This is my first post, so I'll start by introducing myself. My name is Matt
Fisher. I am just beginning to learn Yiddish.

I was a German major at Haverford College, class of '88, then went back to
school for a second bachelor's degree in Environmental Toxicology at the
University of California at Davis. After graduating from Davis in 1993, I
moved to Chicago, and took a job as an environmental consultant for an
engineering firm. None of which explains how I wound up as a computer
programmer for the Art Institute of Chicago, where I have been employed for
the past three years. 

Recently I discovered an old copy of Yehoyesh's Yiddish translation of
Tanakh in a closet at my shul. I don't think anyone had been in that closet
for decades, except perhaps to stash or retrieve a cake and a bottle of
whiskey for the customary breakfast after shacharis. (I don't have the iron
constitution of the minyan oldtimers, so I don't partake. Dos zeynen di
giborim vos fun fartsetn, mener mit a nomen!) 

But, back to Yehoyesh. I was surprised to find that I could make sense of
much of the text -- partly because I already know the story, and the
alef-bes, and partly because I can read German. As a way of teaching myself
a bisl Yiddish, I have begun romanizing Yehoyesh. Bli neder, I'd like to
publish to the web a romanization of the entire text, as well as an Adobe
Acrobat and/or Unicode version in the Yiddish alphabet. I would also like to
link portions of the text to matching audio files. 

Of course, I am not yet fluent enough to make the recordings myself, and the
text alone is a big enough task. From a previous issue of _The Mendele
Review_, however, I gather that a number of people on this list have already
romanized portions of Yehoyesh. Anyone who would like to collaborate on the
text or audio portions of this project, please drop me a line. (You need not
be handy with computers in order to help.) 

Here's the idea: Lomir Yehoyesh romanizirn, un rekordirn far "Real-Audio",
un verefentlikhn dos gantse oyfn veltveytn veb!

A freylakhn un a kashern pesakh,

Matt Fisher

Zollen mir a tritt veiter reydn veygn Paula Teitelbaum's "Galkhes"? "Round"
and "snowball" come equally to mind when we realize that "galokhim" evidently
comes from the bald-pated  friars and priests who wore their shaven heads a la
"galkhos".

Subject: Yiddish song about Russo-Japanese war

My father recalled hearing a Yiddish song in his youth that had to do with
the 1905 Japanese victory over the Czar in the Russo-Japanese war.  The song
was basically praising Japan for teaching the Czar a lesson, and probably
came out of the democratic or socialist movement.  Do the following words
sound familiar to anyone (I know they're somewhat garbled, or something may
be missing - I don't know much Yiddish)? 

"Nippon hat sich far ihm geschelt, un mit sympathie die ganz welt"

I would love to learn the full correct lyrics and melody.

A sweet Pesach to all, and especially to anyone who comes up with the answer!

Subject: broyt mit kiml, byalistoker kukhn, beygl, obarzhanki

I am writing serious article on the history and changing meaning of the
bagel, primarily in the United States, but including the historical context
in Europe. 

I have found a source that indicates that bagels were eaten before starting
the fast for Tisha b'Av and that they were also eaten on Lag b'Omer. Earlier
sources indicate that bagels were associated with the birth of a child. Is
anyone aware of any customs associated with the eating of bagels (aside from
the Sunday morning ritual brunch of bagels and lox)? 

Can anyone help me identify references to the bagel in Yiddish literature,
poetry, folksong, drama, or other sources? 

Does anyone know anything about the bagel baking business and its history
outside New York? 

I have prepared a bagel survey. If anyone is interested and willing to fill
it out, I would be happy to send it.  I am also interested in interviewing
people who remember bagels from before 1970. 

I would also appreciate help with the following questions:

    Were bialys known outside the New York area before the 1970s? Is
anyone familiar with them in Europe? Or, in United States before World
War II.

    What are the various names for bialy? Is anyone familiar with
byalistoker beygl as a term for bialys.

    Does anyone remember bagels from Europe? How do they compare with
obarzanki? Does anyone recall "bagel bread"?

    Yiddish terms for rye bread?

    Does anyone remember other Jewish small breads (and their Yiddish
names)--shtengl, pletsl, bulke, etc.

    I would like to contact bagel  bakers who once belonged to Local 338.

Thanks,

Subject: Kalte shul

To Mendele

In many memorial books, there are descriptions of the various synagogues in
the particular towns, and one is often designated, "di kalte shul."  Is this
because it was big and inadequately heated, or because it lacked the warmth
and intimacy of the shtiblekh?  I would really appreciate an explanation of
the term.

Subject: Legacy of Yiddish choruses in America:  a query

Dear Mendele Readers:
  
For a PhD dissertation, I am gathering information on people's experiences
singing and participating in Yiddish choruses, and the phenomenon of Yiddish
folk singing in general.  If you have ever participated in the Workmen's
Circle Chorus, the Jewish People's Philharmonic, the New Yiddish Chorale
(formerly, Di goldene keyt) or any Jewish labor chorus in the U.S. or
Canada, please contact me at msjacobson@worldnet.att.net

I chose this project for my doctoral research at NYU for a number of
reasons.  First, I feel that tradition of Yiddish folk choruses, and their
role in enriching yidishkeyt has been widely overlooked. While Jewish music
scholars and the press have given much attention to klezmorim, cantors and
other Jewish musical professionals, the musical lives of everyday people
have yet to be explored in depth. Through ethnography and oral history, I
hope to explore this little-understood phenomenon from the perspective of
the singers and their audiences. 

Confidentiality is a very important consideration in this type of research. 
Quotes from all survey respondents will be anonymous.  If I quote some of
your answers, I will do so without using your real name or other details
that will identify you. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if you are willing to
offer more detailed insights by telephone or in person. Many thanks for
participating in this project.
