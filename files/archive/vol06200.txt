Subject: Beit sholem aleichem: a closed corporation

Sylvia Schildt enjoyed listening to Sholem Aleykhem's letter to Bialik
about Bialik's slippers [6.198]. The letter (that was written in 1907)
was published twice in Russian translation (Sholom Aleikhem, Sobranie
Sochinenii, 1974, v.6, p.591 and 1990, v.6, p.273). Apparently it was
published in Yiddish as well. If somebody is interested I can e-mail
Russian text off-list.

Subject: Mauscheln

My thanks to Michael Kranz for his felicitous translation [6.199] of
those last two lines from Wagenseil. The structure of that sentence
eluded me.

Thanks also to Ron Robboy. I did, indeed, "misremember" the precise
wording of the Mahler review--juedelt, not mauscheln. I read the
original several years ago while standing _af eyn fus_ in the home of
Slonimski's daughter in New York. The association I made between the two
words is a reasonable one, though, isn't it?

Mikhl Herzog

[Es vayst zikh oys dem shames az mit dem fodem zaynen mir farforn in der
velt arayn, vayt vayt funm derekh hayidish.  Efsher shoyn a sof?

We may have reached the limit--and then some--of discussing a topic
whose ties to Yiddish might have been tangential to begin with.  In the
absence of fresh material that brings the discussion back to our central
focus, no more please.  nm]

Subject: Mezinke

I am collecting information on the mezinke - the origins, any special
customs, songs, etc. associated therewith.  This is the song that is
played when he last child of a family is married.  Thank you for any
information.

Subject: Yiddish language tapes

I purchased the Yiddish Language Tapes referred to by Leybl Botwinik
[6.198] several years ago, and was (unfortunately) disappointed.  They
are more in the nature of an audio phrase book than an actual language
course. As best as I can remember, they give a fairly good example of
certain phrases that would be useful to a traveler.  However, they are
not complete enough to constitute even a beginner's course in Yiddish.

Through Yiddish of Greater Washington, I sell the books from the W.C.
Book Center, N.Y. and I sold this to someone for her son, 20-30 years
old. She told me he is enjoying the tapes which he plays in his car.
They are easy for him to follow.

Subject: Yankev

In Vol6.198 Ruben Frankenstein wrote:

>.. The vowel extension with guttural sound of the hebrew
>_ayin_ finds no appropriate substitute other than the corruption through
>the nasal _n_...

The following will also be posted to _heblang_, but it clearly has
significant relevance to the history/development of Yiddish, as well.
Therefore, (at the risk of irritating Dr. Frankenstein further,) is it
safe to assume that throughout Ashkenaz the Hebrew _ayin_ had the
guttural pronunciation until relatively recent times?

It's easy to say what Mendele is in English--it's a mailing list.  The
literal translation of this into Yiddish would be "adresn-reshime" or
"post-reshime," which don't sound so natural.  What's the solution?  In
their Forverts column, the Mloteks once made use of the term
"kompyuter-program," presumably on the model of "televizie-program,"
"radio-program," etc.  This is creative but inaccurate.  Better, to my
mind, would be "kompyuter-meldtovl," or, in short, "meldtovl," which is
quite simple and compares favorably with the English "bulletin board."
(If you want to get technical Mendele isn't actually a bulletin board,
and so using the Yiddish equivalent is a slight inaccuracy in
itself--but never mind, since the Yiddish term has none of the technical
connotations of the English.)

What do you think?
