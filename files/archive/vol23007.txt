Subject: Zhitlovski quote: "sintetisher magizm"

Gloria Donen Sosin (in Mendele Vol. 23.006 July 19, 2013) asks about a term in the title of a Zhitlovski lecture.  My guess is the word is _magizm_ “(adherence to or philosophical doctrine of) magic.”

Dovid Braun

Subject: khay gelebt

How would you translate the idiomatic expression of “Khay gelebt!”
I found this as the title of an etching of a dancing Chasid.

Eve Perkal

Subject: kiem and kiyyum

I'm afraid the moderator's note on this matter is misleading, or worse. Both words are Hebrew. “kiem” is the Ashkenazic pronunciation, adopted into Yiddish. “kiyyum” is the Sefardic/Israeli pronunciation.  (It's potato/patato all over again, except that it feeds the common  concept of the “difference” between “truly Jewish” and “that kitchen  
language.”)

Hershl Hartman

5)----------------------------------------------------
Date: July 28
Subject: Nikolai Kaufman

I am looking for any information, histories, biographies and especially arrangements of Yiddish songs by Nikolai Kaufman - a Bulgarian composer who arranged and composed thousands of songs in Yiddish, Hebrew and Bulgarian.

If you have such information please respond to the list or email me directly
at:  jbaruch@wi.rr.com

Thank you,

Jeremy Borouchoff

Subject: Peretz story about bass viol sought

Hi Mendele,

I am seeking the full Yiddish text of the Peretz story about the bass viol. And does anybody know of a good translation viewable online? It's not in the Eli Katz translation.

Many thanks,
Jeanette Lewicki

Subject: ikh hob zey ale in bod/“Sheyn vi di levone”

1)Ikh hob zey ale in bod.

It like saying “Ikh hob zey in der erd.” It means, I don’t care what they are saying or thinking, I don’t give a damn about them...

2) “Sheyn vi di levone”

Sheyn vi di levone,
Likhtik vi di shtern,
Fun himl a matone,
Bistu mir tsugeshikt!
vayl/mayn glik hob ikh gevunen,
Ven ikh hob dikh gefunen,
Sheyn vi toyznt zunen
hostu/hot mayn harts baglikt.

Dayne tseyndelekh,
vays vi perelekh,
Mit dayne sheyne oygn,
Dayne heyndelekh, dayne herelekh,
Hot mikh tsugetsoygn.

Der moykh is mir tsumisht,
Ikh gey arum tsukhisht,
Khveys aleyn nit vos ikh vil,
Ikh shem zikh, ikh bin royt.
Di tsung is bay mir toyt,
Ikh ken nit zogn, vos ikh vil,
Du bist arayn tsu mir,
In hartsn oyf kvartir.
Khtrakht vi tsu zogn dir,
Az du bist...

Sheyn vi di levone,
Likhtik vi di shtern,
Fun himl a matone,
Bistu mir tsugeshikt!
vayl/mayn glik hob ikh gevunen,
Ven ikh hob dikh gefunen,
Sheyn vi toyznt zunen
hostu/hot mayn harts baglikt.

Subject: “Sheyn vi di levone”

Regarding Sara Wolch-Zuckerbrot's request, here is the song as I used to hear at home in my childhood.

Sheyn vi di levone,
Un likhtik vi di shtern, 
Fun himl a matone,
Bistu mir tsugeshikt!
Dayne tseyndlekh, vays vi perelekh,
Dayne zise, zise oygn,
Dayne kheyndelekh, dayne herelekh, 
Oy, hostu mikh tsugetsoygn!

Beautiful as the moon
Bright as the stars
From heaven as a gift
you were sent to me!
Your little teeth, white as little pearls
Your sweet, sweet eyes
Your gracefulness, your hair
Oh, you have captured me!

Perla Sneh
