Subject: nit vs. nisht

I frequently hear and see nisht written for nit. Is nisht just daytshmerish
or is it part of a dialect.

Another question: Does anyone have more information on the "recent law
mandating the promotion of Yiddish" mentioned by Sholem Berger [07.102]?

Subject: Yecke

Leah Zazuler asks [07.101] for information of the word Yeki/Yeki. I assume
that she means the name given to German Jews in Israel although I have only
heard Yeke (the way I heard it pronounced) singularly and not doubled.  While
in Israel I was told the word originated when the Jews escaping Hitler to
Palestikne were far more formal in attire than the earlier residents.  They
wore "jackets" which the Jews in then Palestine pronounced as "Yecket". From
this developed the "Yecke".

probably related to the lost ten tribes...and must have been influenced by the
hebrew language. de torres remaind in the new world and is thought to have
been responsible for the origin of "turkey" as the name for the strange new
bird he observed - a corruption of the hebrew _tukki_ (parrot)".  (norman

A little comment ...

there is a very interesting area concerning yidish and the languages from
which it springs, and this the subject of syntax, of structure. There are
certainly quite a few influences that have brought to Yiddish its very special
character. What do you say, folks, dear Mendelyaner, linguists, historians,
pedagogues, Yiddish lovers, etc. ?????

Subject: Alexis Manester Ramer-(dav(e)nen)

In Alexis Manester Ramer's posting (07.099), he criticized my use of a
respondent to test Weinreich's statement that dav(e)nen has a
pseudo-etymology.  The pseudo-etymology mentioned maintains that dav(e)nen
comes from Aramaic and means "from the patriarchs."  I was, at first, not sure
whether to respond to the psychological aspect of the posting or the
substantive aspects.  Upon consideration, I decided to limit my remarks to
substantive issues raised in that posting. 

Initially, I want to address Mr. Ramer's statement, "Scholarship begins when
we realize that the world is not as simple as "common sense" and that goes
double for anything to do with language, where native speakers ideas are
almost always false."  I agree that common sense has its limits and that there
are contra-intuitive notions.  However, scholarship divorced of common sense
is building sandcastles at the seashore. Additionally, the casual dismissal of
native speakers as a source of knowledge is opposed to all principles of
scholarship I value. 

As for the source of the word dav(e)nen, one must remember that Weinreich
called Yiddish, the language of the way of the Shas and he himself lists
dav(e)nen among the "beyn odem lamokem" words which "the coterritorial
non-Jewish population did not have at all or else had with a different nuance
of meaning."  Weinreich's understanding leads us to an exclusively Jewish
source for dav(e)nen.  As a paradigm for the development of the word
dav(e)nen, lets use the development of term dukhnen.  Dukhnen is the giving of
the Cohanic blessing which required ascending the "dukhn"(platform).  Rather
than calling the mitsve by the formal term, "birkas cohanim" or "nesias
kapim", the common folk named it dukhnen.  As for dav(e)nen, the gemore
Brachos (26b) states, "Always say our forefather's instituted prayer (tfile)." 
Consequently, it is convincing that the mitsve of prayer was referred to as
the mitsve d'Avanan (from our fathers) and hence dav(e)nen rather than tfile.
As for the term d'Avanan itself, it is comparable in structure to the terms
Rabanan(our rabbis) and Maranan(our Masters). 

Accordingly despite Mr. Ramer's scholarly opinion, I am still most taken
by the old Poylisher Khosid/Respodent's response that dav(e)nen shtampt.

Subject: standard transcription

I think we should be careful not to confuse two distinct issues, on the one
hand what lect of Yiddish we employ and on the other what transcription system
we use. One of the few advantages of transcription over the original
orthography is that it permits us to be specific about pronunciation. In most
neutral situations it is no doubt preferable to use klal-yidish in YIVO
transcription, but where dialect pronunciation is itself the topic under
discussion or where individual Mendelyaner who are native speakers of certain
dialects feel more at ease using their accustomed pronunciation it is also
possible to use YIVO transcription (as several of the khevre already do with
considerable virtuosity), since with one exception the dialects have no
phonemes lacking in the standard language. [I say 'phonemes' advisedly.  If
one wants to make subtle distinctions at allophonic level it is preferable to
switch to IPA.] The exception is the vowel-length distinction which is found
in CY and certain varieties of SEY. I propose that we take a leaf out of the
IPA-book and adopt the convention that we simply augment the YIVO
transcription system with the symbol ':' to indicate distinctive vowel length.
Thus CY 'di zin', 'der zi:n', 'di zi:n' (= klal/ NEY 'di zun', 'der zun', 'di
zin'). Transcription systems other than the YIVO system do, of course, exist,
but today the authority of the YIVO system is much greater than those based on
the orthographies of German, Polish, Spanish, French etc. A fortiori we should
eschew random mixtures of these. On transcriptions such as 'bubbe' and 'zine'
(for 'zayn') I forbear to comment.  Incidentally but on a closely related
issue, one may have one's differences of opionion with Alexis Manaster Ramer
on specific questions, but his plea [07.099:4] for sobriety and rigour on
linguistic issues cannot be bettered and should be regarded as axiomatic.
