Subject: Phillips' doggerel

With regard to the rhymed doggerel submitted by Gerald M.
Phillips, beginning "Once I had a candy store . . .," a
variation of this poem appears in the introduction to
Hillel Halkin's translation of Sholem Aleichem's "Tevye the
Dairyman" and "The Railroad Stories" (Shocken, 1987).

Subject: boym un tsig

Seymour Axelrod asks for the background of the expression
"oyf a yungn boym shpringen ale tsign (= all goats jump
into young trees). On a recent visit to the San Diego Wild
Animal Park, the monorail passed a group of goats (I don't
recall the species). The guide suggested looking carefully
at the surrounding trees - sure enough, a branch about 7 ft
high held a young goat! So, the expression may be used to
point out instinctive, common behavior - but it would help
if we knew the basis for the behavior (safety? as an attack
perch? etc)  By the way, the Wild Animal Park (about 10
miles north of downtown SD) was wonderful.

Subject: tsign oyfn beymer

I agree with Shl. Axelrod's observation (110 #4), it is
very frustrating that Bernstein often does not give any
clue to the use, or to the meaning of the proverbs he
lists. Regarding #362 ("Oyf a yungn boym shpringen ale
tsign") I would like to suggest the following:

"All goats leap at young trees" may be a simple
observation, that goats, just as all animals, prefer to eat
young, soft leaves and branches as opposed to the dry, old
and hard ones. I assume, this is how you select fruits and
produce, as well.

You may ask, what's special about the goats? I think they
symbolize the gentlemen, who also prefer to jump on the
"yunge boymelakh", if you know what I mean.

Subject: A mayse mit a tsig

Zev Hochberg's story about goats in trees, as well as the
references to doggerel, resulted in the dredging up of a
fragment from childhood.  There may be lines missing which
I hope someone can supply.  Bob Rothstein may also want to
correct my non-existent Slavic.

[A shtetl Jew is hauled up before a magistrate]

Panye marevoy
di zakh iz derfun azoy
..?
pa'am oyo koze
v'hakoze shtukhem-bukhem
umoye dakhem..

Roughly:

Your honor,
this is what happened:
..?
once there was a goat.
the goat pushed and shoved
and ate the roof..

It occurs to me that having to learn this kind of stuff may
have something to do with my _former_ (but no longer: it's
Noyekh Redux!) sour view of culture junk.

Subject: Introduction
 
I am a student of Computational Linguistics, German and
English at the University of Trier, Germany. The German
curriculum allows for specialization in Yiddish; Trier has
got one of two Professors for Yiddish Studies in Europe.

I'd like to hear from other students of Yiddish.
