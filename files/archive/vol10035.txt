Subject: Mendele

I'm DELIGHTED to have Mendele functioning again.  It was sorely missed the 
weeks that it was not available.  A hartsikn dank aykh alemen!

It was especially good to see Gershon Winer's report on the E. European
Yiddish activities.  I remember Dr. Winer from his administration of the
Yiddisher Lerer Seminar in NYC, as well as from having the pleasure of
having one of his daughters as a student in the Sholem Aleykhem Shul of the
North Shore (of Long Island) when I was the Director.  As always, his
contributions & activities are a nakhess.

I wish Mendele were written in YIDDISH rather than in transliteration.  I am
also interested in a Yiddish word processing program that would enable such
activity.  Anybody have information in this regard?  It would be most
appreciated.

Hartsike vuntshn alemen af a zis, gezunt un gliklekh yor!  Aldos guts...

Subject: LCAAJ on Eydes

I would like to thank Kalman Weiser for calling attention to the Eydes
website. I have visited it and have found that it comes nowhere near the
goal of making the database of the Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic
Jewry available to everybody.
      
At the least, a website dedicated to the Atlas should allow people to start
with any question in the Atlas questionnaire and look up the written answers
to it, for all or a substantial proportion of the locations. The original
design of the project has meant that this has been technically feasible for
a long time.
    
The bad news is that, at present, the Eydes website does not reach this
minimum standard. The good news is that this could be achieved very easily.
I urge Eydes to provide us with the all the answers to all the questions as
quickly as possible.

Dear all-
        
Many of you will no doubt be as pleased as I was to discover that there is a
new edition of James Matisoff's long out-of-print classic **Blessings,
Curses, Hopes, and Fears:  Psycho-Ostensive Expressions in Yiddish.** The
new version is published by Stanford University Press (www.sup.org) in both
hardbound and paperback.

Subject: Naming a Yiddish tango orchestra?

Tayere khaveyrim,

I got the following request from a woman named Jenny Levison, have no
ingenious suggestions for her, and therefore am submitting the request to
Mendele.  I hope someone can be of help!  If you have suggestions, they
should probably be addressed to me (lrosenwald@wellesley.edu).  A sheynem
dank, and a gut un zis yor to all - best, Larry Rosenwald

  I would like to invite you to do some creative thinking to help me come up
  with a name for the orchestra who will play in my new show:  Shtil, Mayn
  Corazon, a Yiddish Tango Cabaret.

  I am looking for a name that tells the world that this is a Yiddish Tango
  Orchestra -- (could include those words.)  I am looking for a name that is
  inviting to people who do and do not speak Yiddish or Spanish ... or
  English for that matter.   However, most of the music comes from Poland
  and Argentina, so if the name had Yiddish and Spanish in it, that would be
  appropriate.

  The name of my production company is Tango Meydl Productions.  The
  orchestra is made up of piano, accordion, bass, and 2 violins.  It is
  under the direction of Pablo Aslan, and fronted by me, singing tangos in
  Yiddish, with a few Spanish and English lyrics thrown in there.  The songs
  are mostly from the early 1900's through the 1950's.  There is a big
  emotional range in the material;  they are love songs, lullabies, comedic
  parodies, folk songs, theater songs, and ghetto songs.

  I would very much appreciate your input --

  Thanks a lot, and gut yontef.
  Jenny Levison

Subject: Yiddish grammar question

Shana tova and a happy new year to everybody.

I am a professional linguist with no knowledge of Yiddish.  I am looking for
a fluent speaker of Yiddish who would be willing to answer a short (but
perhaps tricky) question about Yiddish grammar.  If you think you may be
able to help me, I would be extremely grateful.  My question follows below.

YIDDISH GRAMMAR QUESTION

Please translate the following sentence into Yiddish:

"My two daughters each got three presents for the holidays"

My particular interest is in the "mathematics" of the sentence:  how
does the translated sentence make sure that EACH daughter got three
presents, that is to say, for a total of six presents; or in other
words, how does the sentence rule out the possibility that the two
daughters shared a total of three presents between them.

In English, it's the word "each" that does the job.  In written German
they say "je drei", but in most regional varieties of German the word
"je" is not used; in some places they say "jede drei", while in other
places they put the "jeder" at the beginning of the sentence.  In Hebrew
the sentence would be as follows:

"Shtey habanot sheli kiblu kol akhat shalosh matanot lakhagim"

Here, it's the phrase "kol akhat" which corresponds to English "each"
and German "je".

When responding to this query, please indicate which dialect of Yiddish
you speak, as I am also interested in tracing out this construction as
it occurs in different regional varieties. 

Thanks,

David Gil
Leipzig, Germany

Subject: Another Yiddish story for Onkelos

A modern Yiddish version of Dovid Bergelson's "yoysef shur" is now available
at http://www2.trincoll.edu/~mendele/onkelos.htm.  

An English translation of this story, as with the others in Onkelos, is to be
found in Howe and Greenberg's _A Treasury of Yiddish Stories_, Penguin.

Subject: Disney and Yiddish

In late July I visited Disney.com, an interesting and informative site.  I
would encourage you to explore it.  Via Family.com, I clicked on a baby name
finder because I was curious to see what names were included, etc. There I
located my name, although it was spelled differently than I spell it.  The
origin of Shaina was noted as Hebrew, meaning beautiful.  I was more than a
little disturbed.  Of course I didn't take issue with the meaning ( a nar
zol ich zein), but with the origin-not Hebrew as all of us know!

I wrote to the editor in chief, as visitors are invited to "write us",
explaining that the origin of Shaina is Yiddish, and providing the correct
YIVO spelling which I had requested from YIVO. (For any of you who may be
interested and don't know, the correct transliteration is Sheyne).  Just
change the origin of Shaina to Yiddish, add Yiddish to the list of
languages, right after Swahili, I said, and I will be a happy camper.  I
wrote again at the end of July and at the end of August asking for the
correction.  Still nothing.

The other day I received an e-mail from Reyzl aka YiddishNet containing two
Associated Press articles about Joseph Lieberman and Yiddish.  The second
article, by Brigitte Greenberg, dated September 18 stated in the body as
follows:

Although Yiddish and Hebrew are often associated with one another by
Americans, they are different tongues.....

The internet is proving to be a wonderful tool for Yiddish and Yiddish
culture.  The folks who invented it deserve a Mazel Tov.  Smart bunch they
are, whoever they are.  However, chaverim, I am perplexed.  How does one go
about getting the folks at Disney to make one such small change on their
website?  Vos tut men mit uzeleche menschen?  I am open to suggestions.
 
In the meantime, a healthy, happy, and productive New Year to all of you.
