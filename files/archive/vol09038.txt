Subject: klezfest st. petersburg 1999

i wrote this article recently and it appeared in the Jewish Transcript, the 
seattle jewish newspaper.  maybe you would like to share some of it with 
mendele readers. 

mit a grus fun seattle,

St. Petersburg in June is the time called "white nights".  This last summer
it was also the third time that Klezfest- St. Petersburg occurred.  I had
the most incredible journey and look into Russian Jewish life.  I found that
Jewish communities are still very much alive and growing.
 
The wonderful people of the former Soviet Union that I met are passionately
learning or in some cases relearning about their Jewish roots.  The 35-40
musicians and singers I performed and learned with for 12 days at Klezfest-
St. Petersburg , came from all over Russia, the Ukraine, Moldova, Lithuania,
Byelorussia, Estonia. There were 5 of us from the U.S (2 were teachers, 1,
an interpreter, 2 students). Many Russian participants traveled for days and
days by train or bus to get there.  Russia is huge and taking planes is
uncommon.  They were young and old, very dedicated to their communities and
families. Many of the singers and musicians were conservatory trained. 
Their warmth and sincerity made me feel so welcomed, almost at home (my
great grandfather was a trombone player from St. Petersburg).  We shared the
same desire and enthusiasm for learning about our Jewish heritage.  I felt
such tremendous spirit there, in spite of (or now in retrospect) maybe
because of the hard conditions under which they live.

The Klezfest program included Yiddish classes, vocal coaching,
instrument/ensemble class, chorus, lectures and a total of 4 performances, 2
in St. Petersburg, and the others in Pskov and Novgorod, smaller towns about
5 hours by bus from the city.

Arkady Gendler, a 78 year old man from Zaporozhye, was my Yiddish teacher.
It was tough being taught Yiddish in Russian with an English translator . 
He had lots of stories, about before and after the war. In a town of about
2,000 Jews, he was the only one who remembered or would come forth, with how
to do a seder.  In 1993, the Hebrew school helped him to organize one. So
many people came they had to do another one the next night to accommodate
everyone.  My vocal coaches, were Zalmen Mlotek and Adrienne Cooper, both
from New York, who I know from past Klezkamps.  If it were not for them, I
would not have come to Klezfest. Their rich knowledge and understanding of
Yiddish folk and theater songs comes from their life experiences. Both were
raised in families that come from music and theater backgrounds. I could
listen and watch them both in class and on stage for hours and hours. Zalmen
taught chorus as well. What an honor it was to sing with so many beautiful
voices and work with such magnificent people.

One lecture I will surely never forget was by Lithuanian, Yiddish writer
Masha Rolnikayte, a Vilna ghetto survivor.  She was strong and beautiful and
77 years old, I think.  She spoke in Yiddish.  She was 14 years old when the
nazis occupied.  She saw the tearing down and the rising back up of the
Vilna ghetto theater.  She sang in the Hebrew language choir in the torn up
theater.  Musicians and actors continued to put on shows throughout all the
horrid actions. She said at first there was shock in the ghetto; how they
could continue to perform like this?  But then people saw how it gave
strength and spirit and many started to come.  Masha came to our repertoire
class and Adrienne, our teacher, sang a song that Masha had written lyrics
for.  "Moyshe Halt Zikh"  (Moyshe Be Strong).  She was smiling and nodding
her head. Her eyes were beaming. 

An exceptional pianist I enjoyed working with, was 25 year old, conservatory 
trained, Marina Lebenson from Yekaterinburg, (a college town famous for the 
killing of the czar). We used sign and body language, facial expressions and 
of course the music, to communicate with each other. We really had fun 
performing together. 

One night after one of our concerts at The Actor's House in downtown St. 
Petersburg, we went on an enchanting boat excursion on the Neva River from
10 pm to 5 am. St. Petersburg is far north, only an hour from Finland and
June is the time of "white nights" which provide this incredible pale pink
light most of the night. 

I was actually quite impressed with what was provided for us, in light of
the country 's economy.  It was made possible through funding from The
Jewish Community Development Fund, (JCDF) a project of American Jewish World
Service.  Most of the Russian participants were there on scholarship due to
this fund. They had to compete amongst 80 or so applicants.  The Jewish
renewal and human rights programs that JCDF continues to fund and organize
in the former Soviet Union are having a wonderful impact on peoples' lives
there.  Alik Frenkel, an extraordinary Jewish activist, administrator, and
cultural worker heads the St. Petersburg Jewish Community Center.  His
coworker at Klezfest and wife, Lika was phenomenally effective at running
the whole megilla , with help from Eugeny Khazdan, a talented composer and
pianist. 

Some of the group continued on with our concert tour to Pskov, a small town
about 5 hours by bumpy bus ride from St. Petersburg. The small towns we
passed through along the way looked as if they could be shtetls from my
great-grandfathers time.  Little houses of wood, leaning one way or the
other with folkart trim around the windows and doors.  Little garden plots
outside most houses.  People working by hand in the fields.  People afoot
and by bicycle, harvesting berries and nuts from the trees. 

Pskov is one of the oldest cities in Russia. We visited the old monastery
and kremlin and then met with the woman director of the Jewish community
center.  Across from the center I saw a Holocaust Memorial, an Eternal Flame
burning.  Eternal Flames burn in many cities all over Russia.

The concert we gave was enthusiastically received by the under served Jewish
community of Pskov. The mostly Jewish audience was all ages, and so
beautiful. The younger people, high school and college age, danced in the
aisles, eager to hear and learn anything Jewish. Little girls with long
braids and little boys dressed in their best, brought flowers up after each
singer and then curtsied and bowed amongst thunderous applause. The finale
number we all sang was Ale Brider, (All Brothers) and neither the performers
or the audience wanted the evening to be over.  We were just locked in
applause for each other. 

The second city on our concert tour was Novgorod.  We barely had time to
rest after arriving there, when it was time for our concert.  We walked
through the grounds of a kremlin to get to the concert site, a multicultural
center. There was this huge bell, a monument with all the heroes and
heroines of Russian history.  The workmanship was astounding.  During the
war, the nazis dismantled the bell some how, and hid it in different places
around Novgorod, planning to steal it and transport it back to Germany. The
war ended before they could do this and all the pieces were found and put
back together again. 

The audience response to our concert was again similar to what we had
experienced in Pskov.  The tradition of youngsters presenting us with
flowers, loud and rhythmic applause.  This time we joined the audience in
dancing and brought them up on stage with us.  There were unforgettable
beaming faces and sparkling eyes.  The moment felt timeless to me. 
 
This was to be our last night altogether. We took a lovely walk at about mid 
night , I think.  You could never tell what time it was till about 4:00am 
when it was considerably darker but still this pale pink light prevailed. 

The next day we shared presents and songs.  I recorded as much Russian,
Romanian and whatever other songs people wanted to sing for my Russian
friends at the Kline Galland Home back in Seattle. It was a sad day of
good-byes as we dropped people off at the bus stations along the way.  Fima,
Susanne and Anzhela would ride the bus 5 hours to Moscow. Then 36 hours on
the train back to Kishiniev.  Alina and Polina left the night before right
after the concert. They had a long train ride back to Kazan.  Polina
Achkinazi is 1 year married and 5 months pregnant.  She is a beautiful
singer and musician. She has visited Israel and knows she could move there
but she will stay in Kazan because it is where her family is. It is her
home.  The 15 or so that are left, see us off at the airport.  Everyone
comes to the very last check point with us.  What a group!  Today it is sad,
it is joy, it is connecting. We feel strong and happy at what we created
together.  Will we ever see each other again?  Next year, Klezfest 2000, we
say.

Sheila Fox is the vocalist for Seattle's Klezmer/Ladino quartet, The Kosher 
Red Hots.  She recently performed in New York  in the 26th Annual Yiddish 
Music and Theater Festival.  For a video and pictoral presentation of

least one page of news written in Yiddish and expressed in Hebrew
characters.

The format of the newspaper is tabloid (page size: 29.5cm wide x 43cm high)
and it usually contains sixteen pages. The non-Yiddish pages are written in
English. The serial number of the current issue (21st October) is 1503. The
founding date appears on the masthead as 1962.

Subject: Itzik Manger and Elieser Steinbarg

A friend of mine recently chanced upon an exhibit "Jiddische Dichter aus der
Bukowina" (Yiddish Poets from Bukovina) at the university library of
Tuebingen, Germany. The exhibit showed manuscripts, books (many in
translation), articles by or about the two poets, as well as many photos and
woodcuts (most by Arthur Kolnik). An interesting exhibit catalogue entitled
"My dear Roisele" (taken from a letter of Manger to Rose Auslaender) was
also available and my friend lent it to me. This booklet is written in
German, but has extensive quotations in Yiddish (Latin letters). 

Sincerely,

From: "Mikhl Herzog" <mherzog@bestweb.net>
Subject: 1. dos, di, or der 2. foygl-khale

 1. Feygl Glaser's "essay" (09:304) on Yiddish dialects leaves much to be
desired--too much for off the cuff comment. Suffice it to say that her
assertion that in Lodz, it was "mit DER piter arop" iz way off the mark--in
the category of "Noyekh mit zibn grayzn" (try that one!). 

"Mit DER piter/puter" implies that "puter" is a feminine noun: "di puter"
--dative: "mit der puter". Is it? Actually, "di puter" may occur BUT, NEVER
in Lodz, ONLY in the Northeast Yiddish area (Lithuania-Belorussia, more or
less). Furthermore, because of a rather unusual feature of the grammar in
much of this area, the dative form there would be "MITN puter"(sic!) .[i.e.,
"di puter--mitn puter"]. 

What about Lodz? "puter" [piter] was surely a neuter noun: DUS piter
--dative MITN piter. IF it had been feminine "DI piter", the dative in Lodz
would have been "mit DI piter". But, then again, vi zogt men? _Ven di bobe
volt gehat reder volt zi geven a "street-car". 

Dative "DER" of feminine nouns generally occurs ONLY in parts of
Southeastern Yiddish [the Ukraine, more or less], AND in Standard Yiddish.
However, in Southeastern Yiddish, "puter" is generally a neuter noun; i.e.,
"dus piter--mitn piter". 

Got it?

 2. Gilad Gevaryahu (0:9304) suggests that a _foygl-khale_ is so named
because it resembles the letter "fey". Hundreds of our informants report
that _foygl-khale_ is one of several special types of khale, baked
especially for Rosh Hashana, so-named because it has a decorative peak on
top, in the form of a bird's beak, not because it is round. However, the
_foygl-khale_ generally IS round. 

There are a number of symbolic "dough" decorations reserved for Rosh Hashana
_khales_-- birds, ladders, and hands--all intended to facilitate the ascent
of prayer to heaven. 

One other familiar _khale_ is decorated with a _kitke_ (Polish _kitka_
'aigrette', 'ornamental plume'--a strip of dough that runs across the top.
As I recall, in this case, the entire _khale_ was often called a _kitke_. 

OK?

From: "NormanB" <buders@erols.com>
Subject: Mikhl Herzog's Extreme Thesis

This is my first posting.  I am a European native Yiddish speaker who came
to the US at the age of almost 13. 

Though Mikhl Herzog is right in defending Kathryn Hellerstein, he presents a
very extreme thesis that is in no way needed for her defense. He is simply
wrong to claim that "except in America, Yiddish _man_ is inevitably
'husband', and English _man_ is rendered by Yiddish _mentsh_.
   
A European native Yiddish speaker would say:

"A man mit a froy zaynen gegangen shpatzirn," NOT "A mentsh mit a froy
zaynen gegangen shpatzirn." 

On rest rooms the signs might read "mener" and "froyen," NOT "mentshn"  and
"froyen." 

Again, how would one translate the proverb in Ignacy Bernstein's "Yidishe
Shprikhverter," page 122: 

"Ven an alter man nemt a bsule, hobn beyde nit keyn groyse gedule."

Would one start with, "When an old husband marries a virgin" or "When an old
man marries a virgin"?  It seems to me that one shouldn't do it the first
way, because the old man is not a husband prior to marrying the virgin.  If
he were already a husband, he would be committing bigamy.

Subject: man - mentsh

As an American raised in a Yiddish-speaking immigrant household, I would
agree that 'mann' is husband and not the seemingly more obvious 'man.' I
agree that the English 'man' would more likely be rendered as 'mensch.'
