Subject: Introduction

I thought you would like some information as to my interest in Yiddish
and my background.  Firstly, born June 1, l916 in the Bronx, New York.
My father was a printer and also active in Yiddish affairs having among
other things translated English language books that were serialized in
the Yiddish language newspapers of the day.  I was told that my brith was
a literary gathering.  I personally do not remember.

Most of my fathers later years were with the Forvetz, as a zetzer
(compositor), and like many a zetzer, was an avid, hungry reader.  We,
all four children were sent to the Sholem Aleichem shulen in the Bronx. I
got as far as mittel shul, but my two sisters went further.  My elder
sister performed with the Folksbiene for many years and also appeared on
the stage for professional theatres and during the later part of her
life, was on WEVD as the broadcast voice of YIVO.

My claim to fame is that I read all of the available novels of Jules
Verne in Yiddish before I saw them in English.  Being the son of a
Forvetznik colored my thinking of the language and found it warm and very
comfortable. Unfortunately, my parents have been gone 40 and 30 years,
respectively, and my contacts with the language have been very sparse.  I
find no trouble in reading nor in understanding the spoken word, but,
have difficulty in expressing myself and finding the right word.

As to Mendele, I get a great kick out of it and have no trouble with the
transliterations.  I am familiar with the YIVO conventions, but have
little patience with some of the nitty picky discussions about what would
be the proper way to transliterate.  My feeling is that if it is possible
to make ones self understood, then fine, the problem is solved and we are
communicating.  That was the purpose of the original concept and
therefore we are on target.

Zeit alle gezunt un lummir olle schreiben mer un mer.

Subject: Red and yellow hair

My grandfather was a redhead, but like a carrot!  I new knew him but he
was famous (maybe notorious)for being the only red-headed Jew in
Paterson, NJ. His son (my father) had most of the red squashed out of him
and I have none at all.

I would think that any nickname given to my grandfather had to have been
Al-lazar di rote, but such was not the case.  He was calle Al-lazar di
geller. I heard of other Litvaks with red hair called "yellow-haired" in
this same strange way and wonder if Litvak Yiddish exchanged red for
yellow for some reason about which I know nothing.

This matter came up on the Jewish genealogical bulletin board and 18
people jumped all over me when I said that my red-headed grandfather was
called Al-lazar di geller.  But two Litvaks came to my defense saying
that that was common use in beautiful downtown Ponnovez.

Now I know red from yellow, but was there a geographic crossover of some
kind?

Subject: Oranges/pomegranates

Anno Siegel in Berlin reminds me that there is a reference in the Song of
Songs to cheeks like red pomegranates, so maybe I wasn't so crazy after
all.  Anno also has a recording of the song to which I was referring and
it is called "Di Grine Kuzine" with music by Schwartz and lyrics by
Prizant.  And (while we are on the subject of colors and for those who do
not remember), the beautiful girl cousin with cheeks like red oranges
(baloney!!) was called green because she was a newly arrived immigrant or
a greenhorn.

A greenhorn cousin has come to us
This greenhorn is as beautiful as gold
Cheeks like red oranges
And feet that would dance constantly

She did not walk, she leapt
She did not speak, she sang
Happy and gay is this greenhorn
And that's my girl cousin

Subject: Fedder-Fraynt

Tayer Mendelniks:

Our Fedder-Fraynt Program is doing great!  So far, we have 26 froyen un
menner writing to each other in Yiddish, and getting to know each other.
Most are writing in Hebrayishe oysyes, and a few in transliteration.

All the Yiddish Grad Students at Ohio State University are participating
and enjoying their Fedder-Fraynt.  I haven't heard from any of the other
University Grad Students.  Could it be that Ohio State is the only University
that has a Grad Yiddish Program (nudge, nudge)? ...........sorry, just trying
to stir up a little competition!

So........University Grad Students:  Let's hear from you (and that goes
for the rest of you guys.)  Try it; you'll like it!

You can reply to me either through Mendele or through my own E-Mail
address: ablair@magnus.ac.ohio-state.edu

A gezunt ahf aykh alle,

Avrom Yitzkhok (Allan) Blair
