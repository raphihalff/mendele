The Di Froyen/Women and Yiddish conference wants to encourage students to
attend this groundbreaking conference on October 28th and 29th in New
York City.   We are offering a special price incentive to students with
I.D.-- $5 for the Saturday evening performance at Hunter College, Park
Avenue at 69th Street, 8 p.m.  The evening will consist of conference
opening keynote remarks by Frieda Forman and Irena Klepfisz, and "Zeyere
Eygene Verter/Their Own Words:Yiddish Women's Voices,"  a bilingual
Yiddish/English performance of women's poetry, stories, and songs about
their lives, passions, and dreams which premiered at the Jewish Museum in
New York.  Sunday's program (at the Jewish Theological Seminary, Broadway
at 122nd Street)  of over 30 panels, workshops, and artistic readings is
available to students with I.D. for $30, lunch _not_ included.
Work-study opportunities are open to all for $20 for both days, including
lunch. We still need help on both Saturday night and Sunday.  Call Ruth

Subject: "Khapt un nemt"

In Vol5.135, Mendy Fliegler inquired about the song "Khapt un Nemt." I
sent in the words to this song earlier this year in response to an
earlier query.  You might want to look it up.

Subject: Reasons for putting Yiddish in curriculums

In my previous posts about teaching Yiddish to children, I stated
that Yiddish should be taught on as broad a scale as Hebrew, and that
synagogues and Jewish community centers have to be convinced that Yiddish
should be part of their curriculums.  This would also apply to Bureaus of
Jewish Education (or their equivalent).

As one who has taught Hebrew for many years in various settings such as
synagogue afternoon classes, Bureau of Jewish Education High School,
public high school and junior college, I think I can explain some of the
reasons why Hebrew is offered on such a broad scale.  First and foremost,
synagogues want their children and youth to prepare for Bar Mitzvah, and
to participate in services where Hebrew is read.  Ability to read the
Hebrew Bible is also a goal.  Courses in community centers, high schools
and colleges offer Hebrew as a modern language with one objective being
able to utilize the Hebrew when in Israel.  An additional objective is to
acquire the ability to read modern Hebrew writings.

When it comes to reasons why Yiddish should be offered on the broad scale
mentioned above, I have a few.  But I would appeal to the members of
Mendele to come up with as many as possible so that a really good case
can be made for stating that no Jewish education can be complete without
a Yiddish component.  At the forthcoming 3rd International Meeting of
Yiddish Clubs in Miami next March, we will have the opportunity to
present a position paper on this subject at a plenary session.  After
discussion, a resolution would be drafted.  This could be an important
first step in our effort to broaden the study of Yiddish.

Subject: Mogen oder mogn

We have organized a new chapter of (their spelling) "ARMDI - American Red
Magen David for Israel" and everytime I receive correspondence on their
official stationery git es mir a tzip in hartzn.

I wish to formulate a letter to the national  headquarters, as well as
the regional command here in golus, to describe/explain Yivo's (our
Library of Congress) transliterational standards/rulings.

Ot iz mayn shayle: Should I suggest Mogn Dovid (which I deem correct) or
Mogen Dovid (which my Board says is more familiar)?

Subject: Asch's _God of Vengeance_

I know that when this play was first performed on Broadway in the 1920s
it was shut down for "immorality."  Having read the play I can figure out
why, but I'm interested in the details of the event, and any reviews the
production may have received before it was closed.

Was it ever staged on Broadway in later years? Were Yiddish productions
also raided?

The play has only been staged once in Israel in the past 20 years (in
Hebrew) as far as I know, and there were very few performances. The
censor didn't care, but certain people were bothered...

Subject: hob, bin

Can someone please tell me the difference between 'hob' and 'bin' when
used in the past tense.

For eg. you say 'ikh bin geshlofen' and 'ikh hob gegesen'. 'ikh bin
geshtanen/gekimen' but 'ikh hob gegeyben/genimen/gezokt'. In plural 'bin'
becomes 'zenen' and 'hob' becomes 'hoben'. So we say 'zay zenen gegangen'
as opposed to 'zay hoben gegesen'. I am not sure if every 'bin' becomes a
'zenen' when pluralised. In third person 'bin' becomes 'is' and 'hob'
becomes 'hot'. 'er is gegangen' vis a vis 'er hot gegesen'.

When used in present 'hob' is 'have' and 'bin' is 'am' but in the past
the two become confused.

Is there a rule?

Subject: pakn, khapn

I disagree with Eliyahi Juni in his eg. of pakn in the OJ context. He is
using pakn in place of convicting or perhaps to say 'but they couldn't
make it stick'. pakn is used to emphasise when one is caught red handed
and also implies, but not neccesarily, a certain element of suprise on
the part of the catcher. If a boy is caught cheating during a farher he
could say 'der rebe hot mikh gepakt'. Catching a shoplifter would provide
the perfect example of men hot eym/ir gepakt.

Regarding khapn, a riddle or a witty pun is also known as a khap. I don't
think 'ikh khap nisht' is quite used for 'I don't understand'. I would
prefer 'I can't figure it out' which is why I would not go along with his
example of "I don't khap why they didn't have a khapts'm when the
shaygets broke the window."
