I can't really give a good answer to the question of
WHAT variety of Yiddish is spoken in Antwerp. I assume
the variety is at least primarily based on geographic
origin. There are various relligious groups, but I
don't know whether it matters. Another determining
factor, I have been told, is whether the language used
to converse with the non-Jewish Flemish population is
primarily French (older generation and some of the
younger) or Dutch (part of the younger population). I
am afraid I am neither a Yiddish dialectologist nor a
sociolinguist nor a Yid.

Comment:
 
I was in Antwerp last week, but I had not read Johan's
missive at that time, so I couldn't cock an ear out (?)
for the Yiddish.  However, I try to speak Yiddish
whenever I get the chance and I can report the follow-
ing.  I went to a Gemore shier in yidish and the yidish
I heard was very similar to that I have heard at a
khasidish rebbe's shier in boro park (this rebbe in
Antwerp was also khasidish).  I can't really character-
ize it linguistically: I haven't spent enough time on
studying the particular characteristics of different
yidish varieties; but I do remember that he systemati-
cally used ay where standard yidish would have ey (e.g.
kayn instead of keyn).  I also talked to some people on
the street and they did not all have this characteris-
tic.  Furthermore, I asked one of my frum friends what
kinds of khasidim there were in Antwerp and he said
bobover, gerer, lubavitch,...  all kinds.  bekitser, I
would say there is no one variety of yidish spoken in
antwerp. ___________________________________
 
 
 Last year, we had a graduate
student from New York visiting, who was all three, and
who was here to study the contact Dutch-Yiddish situa-
tion, but he found it very hard to get enough contacts
to do the work.
 
Comment:
 
I am not surprised.  Khasidim aren't very open to
speaking to non-Jews (or even non-khasids) in yidish. 
I have found in Williamsburg that it is sometimes
difficult to get khasidim to speak to answer a yidish
question in yidish (even when their own english is
bad).   (Although in my case, that might be because 1)
I don't look like a yidish speaker and 2) my yidish
isn't 100% fluent, rather than that I am not khasidish)

Self-intro:
 
My yidish (in both senses) name, melekh (pronounced
meylekh) is a partial translation of my indian name,
vis(h)wanath, which means "nath (lord, king) of the
vishva (universe, world)" As you may have guessed, I am
from India, from the state of Kerala in the south.  My
mother tongue, however, is Tamil, spoken in Tamilnadu
and by some groups in Kerala, and by large groups in
Srilanka, Malaysia and Singapore (where it is also an
official language).
I learnt most of my yidish at the YIVO zumer-program
and by hearing it spoken and speaking it.  My wife's
mother tongue is yidish and she uses yidish almost
exclusively to communicate with her relatives, so I
hear a lot of it. She also speaks yidish exclusively
with our children, while I speak only Tamil to them.
I teach finance/economics at Rutgers Univ. (Newark, NJ)
and am currently 'into' the study of law and economics,
one manifestation of which interest is the investiga-
tion of jewish (rabbinic) law in terms of economic
theory.

Subject: Introduction

My name is Yossi Galron-Goldschlaeger. I am the
Hebraica & Judaica cataloger at the Ohio State Univer-
sity Libraries. Yiddish is not my mame-loshn. I was
born and lived most of my life in Israel and my mother
tongues are Hebrew and German (my parents immigrated to
Palestine from Austria and Czechoslovakia).  In Tel-
Aviv I worked at the Tel-Aviv University (1973-1988) as
cataloger and as automation librarian.

To date I've published three bibliographies: the writ-
ings of and about Yisrael Yeshyahu (Yemenite Mapainik -
Histadrut leader, Cabinet minister and Speaker of the
Knesset - some of his articles were translated into
Yiddish and published in Di Goldene keyt); the writings
of Prof. Dov Sadan (Berl Stock) - Prof. for Jewish
literature (Hebrew and Yiddish) (I am sure that I don't
have to introduce him to the Mendele Mentshen); and a
bibliography of the writings of Yeshayahu Avrech, an
essayist of the daily Davar and winner of the Israel
prize for essays.

I compiled another two bibliographies that have not yet
been published: A critical bibliography of and about
Nathan Alterman (Israeli poet and writer) and a
completion of my bibliography of Dov Sadan (his writ-
ings from 1984 to 1989).

Now I am working on the bibliography of Abraham
Shlonsky.

Beside my bibliographic work I am cataloging at the
Ohio State University in Columbus. Most of the books
are Hebrew books (Hebrew literature, Israel -politics,
geography, history, etc. and Rabbinical literature) and
Yiddish (most of them Yiddish literature). Our collec-
tion in OSU is big and with the help of the Melton
Center for  Jewish Studies we are trying to keep our
place as one of the leading collections in the Big Ten.

I realize this is a question about language and histo-
ry, instead of current practice.  But perhaps some
reader of this group can help explain something.

_Shadchonim_ are matchmakers.  I understand that.  

But, as we know, Hebrew words rarely show up in English
except via Yiddish. _Shadchan_ is like _shohet_, as far
as I can tell, in that people only use it to refer to
the man charged by tradition and his community with the
relevant task-- making matches of people or making meat
of beasts.  

But Yiddish surely has its own word to describe people
who make matches in-formally.  I've often heard _yenta_
used to describe a woman who plays this role.  In fact,
I've only ever used it in this sense, to refer to
someone  who introduced two people.  But I understand
that it also means 'an intru-sive or meddlesome woman'. 
Perhaps the only sense that has been preserved in the
Yinglish I hear is the one that involves _desired_
meddling.  

Now for the questions:
1.  Is _yenta_ truly from Latin _gentilis_?  If so, how
did it become feminine, why does it mean what it does
(rather than 'Gentile woman'), and how come people
don't use it instead of _shiksa_, which I consider
offensive?

2.  Is there an equivalent word for men?  _Yentl_ is
different, surely, but why?

3.  Are there other words for matchmakers in Yiddish,
of the informal or formal kind?

Thanks very much.  I know it's complicated but I'd love
help.

Subject: Introduction

Thank you for including me to the Mendele List - I
received 1 file so far.  

Although I do not speak Jiddish except for a few words
I understand it at leas partially and I am interested
in the language itself and also in its concepts. (in-
cluding the aspect of "book" both in Jiddish and He-
brew, as I work on a project on building electronic
books.
 
My Jiddish is virtually nonexistant as Vienna, that is
where I live when I do not work in L.A., is not a very
good place to learn it: if you are orthodox -which I am
not - you speak Hebrew - otherwise you don't. I know
one person in Vienna who speaks Jiddish ...
 
Anyway I look forward to more stuff.
 
Regards
 
Florian Brody
 
PS: Do you know of a bilingual edition (Engl/Jiddish or
German/Jiddish) of works of I.B. Singer?
 
PPS I recently found a late 19 c. / early 20c (?) 1 vol
dictionary Engl-Jiddish in a shop in S. Monica for
approx US$ 100 - I did not buy it but if you are inter-
ested I can get their tel#
