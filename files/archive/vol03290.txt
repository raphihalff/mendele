Subject: Yinglish

Another loss with the decline of Yiddish are the wonderful yiddish
jokes...the following is probably not one of them...but it does
illustrate the phenomenon of Yinglish.

A fellow had forgotten the Yiddish word for "disappointed" and so decided
to call his mother. Ashamed for a declining mame-loshen vocabulary, he
didn't have the nerve to ask her the word directly. So he said "Mameh,
ich ken nisht kumen tsu essen by dir nexten vokh." To which she replied,
"Oy, ich bin azai disappointed!"

Subject: Request from Paris

Received this letter yesterday. Write him directly, or email me a
message, and I'll send it to him by snail mail.

I am preparing my new project which is about Yiddish and Klezmer music
for French television.

I am looking for testimonies of old klezmer musicians and composers of
old Yiddish music, and producers of the 30's and 40's.

The American singer Rosalie Becker, who is living in Paris, told me that
you were in possession of a listing of many musicians, and to contact you
in order to find some information about them.

I would be very grateful if you could give me the name and address of old
musicians, singers or composers who lived and worked in Eastern Europe or
in the United States before the Second World War.

May be there are other informations you would find useful to my work.

Sincerely yours,

Stephan Rabinovitch

Subject: Rosenfield's Prufrock

When I was an undergraduate, one of my profs., JY Lettvin, a grad of U of
Chicago, used to delight in quoting the lines:

"ikh ver alt, ikh ver alt,
s'vert mir in mayn pupik kalt"

Sorry, that's all I know. I'd love to know the rest as well.

Subject: The Workmen's Circle 61st Gala Pesach Celebration

At the risk of being accused of using this wonderful discussion list for
commercial purposes (which I am not) I would like to advise the Yiddish
speaking users of this list of the 61st Gala Third Seder Celebration to
be held this Sunday afternoon, March 20, 1994 at the Sheraton Hotel, New
York, 53rd and Seventh St at noon. For those of you who are not
acquainted with this affair, it is one of the most satisfying and
wholesome events of the Yiddish year. It is a multimedia cultural
spectacular which I have witnessed for the last 6 years and I am led to
believe that this might well be the last of them. It is for this reason
that I am bringing it to everybody's attention.

It consists of a string of highly talented artists, singers, musicians,
actors, narrators, dancers, the Workmen's Circle Yiddish Choir (of which
I am an avid member). The ages of the participants range from little
children to bobbas and zeydas and everything in between. For information
about tickets, you can call (212) 889-6800 x 523. Whether you are located
in Australia or South Africa, in Hawaii or the Bronx, I assure you it
will be well worth your while to attend.

Hoping to see you all there,

Henry Mullish

Subject: Nukhem Stutchkoff

Does anyone know if there is such a thing as a Nukhem Stuchkoff
collection or archives? My research on Yiddish radio (on which Stutchkoff
was a prolific genius) has turned up nothing.   One would think that the
compiler of the magnificent "Der oytser fun der yidisher sprakh" and
hundreds of insightful and gripping radio shows would leave behind some
amount of paper. How about a necrology? A thumbnail bio? Epes. I would
greatly appreciate any leads.

Subject: Juedisch-deutsch

I'm glad Mr. Hoberman brought the subject of Juedisch-Deutsch up (and
please excuse my formality; I accidentally erased my entire discfile).
I've read only a few books on Mayrev-Yidish and Juedisch-Deutsch, and I
don't like to initiate a post unless I know what I'm talking about
(what's regarded as fact, what's controversial, etc.)

My limited understanding is that on the periphery of Mayrev-Yidish, one
hears the "Vollmundart," i.e. Mayrev-Yidish in its full state, with
little contamination with local German patois or formal High German:
Switzerland and Alsace-Lorraine. In Germany, on the other hand, one hears
Juedisch- Deutsch,in one of the meanings of the term:a "Yiddish" whose
German component has been replaced with local and national German. It is
now German, but the loshn-koydesh expressions are part of people's speech
when they are speaking in a certain "Jewish" context. This element
retains the original pronunciation of its region, and one can infer to
some extent what the Vollmundart must have been like. The sh-sh of the
ich-laut existed in the Vollmundart and did not enter the language
through contact with Modern standard German or local dialect, so far as I
have been able to ferret out of the few books I've read (wish I had the
titles).

The other meaning of Juedisch-Deutsch, as I understand it, is the
crypto-language with deriva- tives from loshn-koydesh (ze-ge melokhnt lau
= that goy doesn't work). Gentiles will often assume that this is
Yiddish, even though it's a cant or form of in- group slang. There is
really a blur, I think, between these two meanings of Juedisch-Deutsch,
since the the population that speaks one also speaks the other. This cant
was part of the old Vollmundart before its use in conjunction with
German. However, its use side-by-side with German as spoken by local
Jews, i.e. as fragments, may have led to the notion I grew up with that
"Yiddish is not a language." To further complicate the matter, the Jewish
population of Lengnau and Endingen in Switzerland refer to their
"Vollmundart" as "Yidishdaytsh".

This subject fascinates me, and I -- though a sensitive soul -- would
welcome being "corrected" so we can get a really clear picture of what
the situation is.
