Subject: Introduction

I am a newcomer to Yiddish, stricken with all the symptoms of new
romance. I am likewise new to Mendele, and hope to understand more in the
coming months. What is the possiblility of a Yiddish Ulpan, like the
Hebrew ones, or the Middlebury summer language school, total immersion,
with grammar and readings available at several levels as students wish?
I believe there would be much interest for a summer four or six week
session, as well as one week or ten day sessions in fall and spring.
Perhaps the NYBC in Amherst could be tempted to start one.

over three years now playing all kinds of music of the Jewish
people;Yiddish folk songs,theatre songs,Israeli music, khazones, klezmer
both old and new,Ladino,etc. I'm on every week for an hour on Sunday
morning at 8AM on WUCF 89.9FM,the station of the U. of Central Florida.

I'm the gantze tzimmis;the producer, the on air host,the editor,etc.
I am always on the lookout for Jewsih music. Ich bin take a shnorrer. I
have found Yiddish music at the Smithsonian, in the Library of Congress,
wherever. I very much enjoy Mendele and Fish'ls Der Bay. Zeit ale gezunt.

Subject: Introduction

My name is Arthur Sheppard (Art to friends) and I've just started to
learn Yiddish. I come from a very non-jewish home. In fact I had my Bar
Mitzvah two years ago at the age of 66. Our Temple Chavurah has just
started a "Yiddishkite Chavurah and I and my wife are both members. My
wife (Bobby) and my sister-in-law both speak and sing in Yiddish since
their mother and father were members of the Yiddish theatre in Pittsburgh
many year ago.

I am a retired Communications Engineer and spent many years travelling
around the world in that capacity. The sobriquet "Spaceman" comes from my
many years connected with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. We
have four children worldwide. A son in Denver, another son in Redondo
Beach, California, a daughter in Israel, and another daughter in Los
Angeles, which gives us four grandchildren. So you can see my wife and I
still do lots of travelling.

Subject: Yiddish census guide

For Zellig Bach and others:  it might make you feel just a tiny bit
better to know that Barbara Bryant, Director of the Census Bureau from
1989-92, has acknowledged the problems with the Yiddish guide.  This
appears in her new book "Moving Money and Power" which is a chronology
and perspective on her years as Census Director.

As for the 2000 Census, we'll be lucky to have a Yiddish guide, or any
foreign langugage guides, at all.  Congress is being pretty sticky about
money for everything that doesn't actually count people directly.  (If
anyone wants to know more about Congress and the 2000 census, or anything
about the census, please email me directly.)

Subject: Mu asapru

I was away for Pesach and when I checked my mail today, I came upon the
discussion of Mu Asapru, one of my favorite songs.  The version I know
from one of Theo Bikel's recordings has a few differences.

Subject: Zhotnik

I am trying to clear up a mystery I hope you can help me with.

I recently adopted a cat named "Zhotnik".  Zhotnik was named by a
previous owner who has since departed the scene.  Thus the mystery:
What's Zhotnik?

I have inquired about the derivation of "Zhotnik" with Russian and Serb
language newsgroups to no avail. Zhotnik himself has nothing to say on
the subject.

A friend suggested the word might be derived from Yiddish.  I would be
fascinated to hear any clues to this mystery anyone may have.

Subject: A nametag for Mendele

With Mameloshn '95, Ashkenaz in Toronto, and the wonderful third
International Yiddish Convention in Miami, all looming on the horizon,
wouldn't it be a fargenign to be able to identify our Mendele family
members in the yom fun penimer that participate?

How about designating a means of identification to be worn as a nametag?
I volunteer its design and an attempt to disseminate same, if you deem
the idea workable and valuable.

Looking forward to meeting (and easily recognizing) you,

[Hearing no objections, Mendele now has an official graphics designer.
A dank fun undz ale.]
