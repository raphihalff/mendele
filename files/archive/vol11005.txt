Dear Mendelyaners

I read somewhere that the University of Ukraine released some years ago
a cd with recordings of the An'Ski collection of Yiddish songs. An'Ski,
as an ethnographer, travelled through several shtetlekh equipped with a
roll-phonograph and recorded lots of klezmer music. After the
Revolution, the rolls were "forgotten" in the St Petersburg Museum.
Following the fall of Communism, the rolls were transferred to Kiev. I
wrote half a year ago to the librarian of the University of Ukraine,
and got no answer at all. Did a Mendelyaner ever hear the record?

Subject: prufrock's pupik, Madansky et al

I quoted the Rosenfeld translation in full from what was supposed to be
an authentic Rosenfeld source (the Rosenfeld Reader?) in Mendele some
years ago. It should be sitting in your archives. (I can no longer find
my copy.) You could look it up.

Subject: Rosenfeld's and/or(?) Bellow's Prufrock

Almost seventy years after it was written, "Der shir hashirim fun Mendl
Pumshtok" continues to generate lively interest. It was discussed in
Mendele in 1994 (3.285:6, 3.288:3; 3.290:3; 3.292:5; 3.292:6; 3.294:1;
3.294:4) and recently (10.052; 10.053; 10.056) and is frequently
mentioned in the literature. Ruth Wisse beleives that this parody
signifies a critical point at which "American Jewish letters gave
notice of its independence from Anglo American modernism" (The Modern
Jewish Canon, p. 289). However, it seems that there is no consensus on
who has written the piece. It has been attributed to Isaac Rosenfeld
and Saul Bellow, either separately or in various combinations.
According to different sources, the author is...

...Isaac Rosenfeld

"he [Rosenfeld] did a translation of Eliot's _Prufrock_" (Saul Bellow,
Foreword to "Isaac Rosenfeld, An Age of Enormity", The World Publishing
Company, 1962;  also reprinted in "Preserving the Hunger: An Isaac
Rosenfeld Reader", Wayne State University Press, 1988)

"Visiting Isaac, I would beg him to do his Yiddish version of Prufrock"
(Irving Howe, A Margin of Hope, HBJ, 1982).

...Isaac Rosenfeld with the help of Saul Bellow

"Isaac Rosenfeld, with the help of Saul Bellow, composed a Yiddish
parody of "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" (Ruth Wisse, The Modern
Jewish Canon, The Free Press, 2000)

...Isaac Rosenfeld and Saul Bellow

"Isaac and Saul produced Yiddish-language spoofs of masterpieces of
English literature, including, most famously, their playful, sardonic
translation of T. S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"
(Steven Zipperstein, The First Loves of Isaac Rosenfeld, Jewish Social
Studies, v.5, no.1/2, 1999)

...Saul Bellow with the help of Isaac Rosenfeld

"a spoof of Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock", written in
Yiddish by Bellow and his Chicago sidekick Isaac Rosenfeld" (Al
Ellenberg, Bulletins of His Own Condition, The Jerusalem Report, April
5, 2001)

...Saul Bellow

"As a youth, Bellow composed and performed a standup spoof of "The Love
Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" in Yiddish" (Christopher Hitchens, The
Great American Augie, Wilson Quarterly, v.25, Winter 2001)

"Bellow's translation into Yiddish of T.S.Eliot's "The Love Song of J.
Alfred Prufrock" (Debbie Forman, Literary Community Toasts Noted Author
Saul Bellow, Cape Cod Times, July 25, 1998)

It may be difficult to allot the credits precisely in cases like this,
but some clarification would be very helpful.

The current thread in Mendele was started by Ezra Mendelsohn (10.052)
who inquired about the text of the parody. Al Madansky posted text
(10.053) that was published in a volume, edited by Mendelsohn, so I
assume that he knew that one and was looking for something different.
A slightly different version was reprinted in Mendele by Shleyme
Axelrod, z"l in response to Neyekh Zide question:

  Mendele Vol. 3.288
  Date: Tue Mar 15 13:30:12 1994
  From: <PTYAXEL@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu>
  Subject: Rosenfeld's Prufrock

  Neakh Zide asks about Isaac Rosenfeld's parody of Eliot's "The Love
  Song of J. Alfred Prufrock".  The following is the version given by
  Gene Bluestein in an article entitled "Prufrock-Shmufrock" in the
  journal *Yiddish*, published by Queens University Press, 1987, Vol.
  7, No. 1. I have made a few minor changes to conform to the YIVO
  transcription scheme.

  Nu-zhe, kum-zhe, ikh un du
  Ven der ovnt shteyt unter dem himl
  Vi a leymener goylem af tishebov.
  Lomir geyn gikh, durkh geselekh vos dreyen zikh
  Vi di bord bay dem rov.
  Oyf der vant
  Fun dem koshern restoran
  Hengt a shmutsiker betgevant
  Un vantsn tantsn karahod.  Es geyt a geroykh

  Oy, Bashe, freg nit keyn kashe, a dayge dir!

  Ikh vel onton vayse hoyzn
  Un shpatsirn bay dem yom.
  Ikh vel hern di yam-meydn zingen Khad Gadyo.
  Ikh  vel zey entfern, Borekh-abo.

  It's forced in places of course, but the renditions of the "In the
  room..." and the "I grow old ..." sentences alone make the piece
  worth preserving.

Shalom,

Does anyone know if this giant poem of Itzhak Katzanelson was
translated into English and ever published?

Thank you,

the listed editions are bilingual. First Yiddish edition was published

Subject: Scrambled eggs

Hardly a day goes by that I don^? have an urgent need to look something

up in a Yiddish etymological dictionary.  The problem is that I don't
own one nor have I ever been able to locate one.  I'd therefore be
supremely grateful for information on where to obtain such a useful
reference work. My latest puzzlement is with the origin of the Yiddish
word for "scrambled eggs" which Weinreich lists as _prezhenitse_.
That word sounds so "Russian" to me that I was sure I would find it in
my Russian-English dictionary.  But all I could find there for
"scrambled eggs" was the hyphenated word _yaychnitsa-boltuna_ [my
transliteration].  I found no Russian entry for _prezhenitse_.  I would
therefore be grateful for anyone who can give me an etymological gloss
on that word.

Subject: Mendele at a Decade

Tayere Mendelyaner,

I wish to add my congratulations to the many who will send in
congratulations as we look forward to your bar mitsve.

Most of all, we must not forget the role Dave Sherman played in getting
it off the ground. You rightfully acknowledged his early work, and his
gracious manner in relinquishing the helm to Noyekh--and the great role
Iosif undertook.

With people like these, Yiddish has a bright future.

mit frayndshaft,

Philip "Fishl" Kutner

Subject: Yiddish poet Rejsel Sichlinski

In searching about the yiddish poet Rejsel Sichlinski (that's the
spelling I got from an old lady) I found your home page. I would be
very grateful if somebody knew something about the author Sichlinski.

And having found your site, I would like to subscribe, as I'm very
impressed of the huge lot of knowledge. So please tell me how to
subscribe (if you accept me to do so: I'm a librarian of Vienna
University Library and have published catalogues about Manes Sperber,
Joseph Roth and Karl Kraus).

Sincerely

Victoria Lunzer-Talos

Subject: Freiheit

With reference to Hershl Hartman's comment [11.002] on the relegating
of the Freiheit to the status of a non-newspaper, the ironic part is
that, despite its role as a Communist publication, the Yiddish in the
Freiheit was better, less corrupted by English and more readable than
that in any of the other three dailies.  I used to read it for that
reason alone, since I was on the very opposite end of the political
spectrum and my natural home was the Morgen Jornal.
