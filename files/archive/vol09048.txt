Subject: Yiddish Reports of the Yishuv

A shaynem dank tsu Yael Chaver in Berkeley far di informatsye vegen di tsvay
bikher vos ikh hob geredt derfun in a foyerdik e-post.  I very much
appreciate Yael Chaver's enlightening information on the two Yiddish books
about which I had posted an earlier message to the list. A few more points
may be of interest regarding one of them. 

Reading the forward to "Vos Arbetorins Dertseylen" more carefully than I had
done previously, as Chaver's comments were made without having a copy at
hand, I found that most of the translation indeed had been done by the
editor, Rakhel Katznelson-Rubashov, as Chaver had thought to be the case. 
But Katznelson-Rubashov also credits a significant amount of translation
(two out of the seven sections of the book) as well as sharing throughout in
the work of editing ("vos hot zikh oykh batayligt mit mir tsuzamen in der
redaktsye funem bukh") to "Z. Rubashov" -- later known as Shneur Zalman
Shazar, the third President of Israel and her husband.  Nothing about his
involvement appears on the recto or verso of the title page. My
understanding of Zalman Shazar's connection to Yiddish is that it was
significant, and included his having contributed some original work on
Yiddish philology which was published by Yivo. 

Two others are also mentioned as having helped with the translations, in a
much more minor way (only one or two specific pieces): Kh. Erem and Rakhel
Faygenberg. 

Katznelson-Rubashov also says something interesting after she notes that
there is a necessary link between what has been the cuture of the Jewish
women workers and their present work and developing a culture in Eretz
Yisroel which draws it's nourishment from Jewish and Arabic cultures.  She
goes on: And in a given sense as a symbol of continuity, the Yiddish
translation itself already became a cultural binding together: just as one
would return here a duty to someone to whom one is very obligated.  ("Un in
a gevisen zin, vi a simvol fun hemsheyk, fun kultureler tsuzamengebindkayt -
iz geven shoyn di etsem iberzetsung oyf idish: azoy vi men volt do umgekert
a khoyv aynem, vemen men iz a sakh shuldig.") 

As I'm not entirely happy with my translation of that sentence, I welcome
both a better one and some clarification of her meaning.  She *seems* to be
saying that providing a Yiddish translation of the written experiences of
these women in Eretz Yisroel helps to fulfil an obligation to link the past
culture with the new one. 

Shavua tov,

Bernard Katz

Subject: "Af zain treyd"

I am a researcher from Jewish University of St. Petersburg (Russia). I study
different aspects of traditional shtetl culture in the Podolian region of
Ukraine. During my last expedition to former shetls of Podolia I came across
an interesting expression. One of my informants told me that after a tragic
death of his father, his mother had blocked up the main door entrance of the
house, for she did not want anyone "to walk over the father's footsteps". In
this part of the story my informant started to speak Yiddish and used the
expression: "Af zain treyd". I should be most grateful if somebody explain
the meaning of this expression. 

With best wishes,

Alla Sokolova

Subject: He should know better!

Philologos writes (Forward, November 12): "We all know what _shabbes_ is,
and _lobbis_ rhymes with it nicely." 

Does it really? 

Philologos fails to tell us that this can only be true where, as in London,
the prevailing pronunciation of _shabbes_ is [shobes] which, like London
[khole] (= khale) suggests a Bessarabian/Podolian origin. 

Are you listening Phil?

Subject: Index to Sholem Aleykhem stories

Does anyone know whether there is a master list or index to all of Sholem
Aleykhem's stories in the 28-volume Folksfond Oysgabe edition "Ale verk fun
Sholem Aleykhem." (New York, 1927). Also, are there other stories of his
that are missing in this edition? If so, where can they be found?  A
cross-index of English translations of all stories which have been
translated would also be nice. It need not, for obvious reasons, list every
translation in every anthology.

Subject: Future of Yiddish

Hello to anyone out there. Let me introduce myself. My name is Alec
Braizblatt, 62 years old, born in Melbourne, Australia, to parents who came
out there from Poland in early 1937. Yiddish was the language spoken at
home. I attended a teachers training institute and in 1959 graduated as a
teacher - primary and junior secondary school. Married in 1960, and the
next year made aliya with my wife Ann.  For the first 12 years in Israel we
lived on Kibbutz Yizreel, (we were both graduates of the Zionist youth
movement Habonim) and then just before the Yom Kippur War we moved to Tel
Aviv. I found work in the defence establishment where I still work. 

In the youth of my old age I have decided to go for a BA. This I am doing by
distance learning with the University of Birmingham in the UK. 

So why have I told you all this? Here is the answer: I must present a thesis
at the end of my course. I have chosen the subject of Yiddish, more
specifically - the future of Yiddish as perceived by Yiddishists. I received
your e-mail address from Catherine Hellerstein who is currently in Israel. 
She teaches Yiddish at Pennsylvania University, and told me that I should
write to you. I am interested in corresponding with anyone about this
subject and, hopefully, gain some insights which might help me with my
thesis. 

That's all for now folks. Hope to receive something from someone - anything
from anyone! 

Zait gezunt, 

Alec Braizblatt

Subject: German and Slavonic influences in Yiddish

I am a student at Cambridge University, England, and am writing a
dissertation on Yiddish. I am looking most specifically at the German and
Slavonic influences, as well as dialectal variations. If you have any
information that may be of help, I would love to receive it!  Thanks for
your time,

Naomi Russell.

Subject: Translation of "Fargin zich"

I went to a klezmer concert last night and in the program the phrase "Fargin
zich" was used and translated as "enjoy yourself". This phrase is not
familiar to me and I was wondering whether that was because of my meagre
yiddish or whether it was a misspelling. 

Cordially,
Neil Sandow

Subject: Words for a song "Nayn, Nayn Nayn"

Dear Mendele Readers:  Is there anyone out there who knows the words to the
song Nayn, Nayn Nayn ( svet unser fulk nisht untergayn. It was a song my Dad
and his two brothers learned at the Farband's Unser Camp and their five sons
want to learn these wonderful words. 

Many thanks
