Subject: More about "melupm kind"

I received several requests from Mendelyaners with reference to my post
"Vos iz a melupm kind?" (5.003,5) for additional information and
explanations. Herewith my reply:

The letter "pey" was inadvertendly left out from the spelling of the word
"melupm."  (My new spelling check system, Thunder 7, does not [as yet...]
read yidishe oysyes and thus missed to alert me to the lapse.)

Uriel Weinreich's Dictionary has four (4) entries of the word in
question:

a) An initial entry: "mem, lamed, _alef_,  pey, vov, shlos mem," with the
direction to see "melupm;"

b) "Melupm" -- the diacritic of the letter vov;

c) "Melupm vov" -- the letter /u/; and

d) "Melupm kind" -- defined as: 1) babe in the woods (that I criticised
since it may also apply to an adult), and 2) tyro (a beginner in
learning, a novice).  The latter definition corresponds with Harkavy's
"abecedarian."

Harkavy's Dictionary (1928) has a similar initial entry:   "mem, lamed,
_komets alef_, pey, vov, shlos mem," with a similar direction, as in
Weinreich, to see melupm.

Note particularly the letters _alef and komets alef_ in both W's and H'
initial entries, but *missing* in the other entries, and especially the
last three letters in both (PUM).  This gives us a clue to the meaning of
the source word from which it originated.

The word is "molepum," comes from targem-loshn (Aramaic), and means "full
mouth."  (In Hebrew 'mole-pe'.)  Fullness of the mouth is a reference to
the way one has to shape the lips and cheeks in order to pronounc a /u/
-- lips rounded and cheeks stretched and puffed up with air.

Is it possible that the task to teach and train a very young child to
make the /u/ sound was found to be overly complex, and therefore stood
out in the teaching process to the point where the child at this stage
was called a "melupm kind"?

Since melupm in Yiddish has no vowels, I erroneously assumed it to be
Hebrew, but I was unknowingly quite close.

How the Targumic "molepum" came to sound in Yiddish melupm, I do not
know.

The dot in the center and to the right of the letter vov ("Melupm vov")
is also called shurek, or shuruk vov. .

I mentioned that the langer nun of the spelled "melupin" takes in
transcription the sound of /m/.  This is similar to the word "kheshbN,"
for example, which when transcribed becomes "kheshbM."  This has to do
with the fact that the letter 'nun' is a palatal consonant, and some of
my learned colleagues in Mendele can explain the phenomenon of the shift
to 'mem' better than I could do it.  It does not seem to me, however,
that the same phenomenon also applies to the shift from /m/ to /n/ as in
yoM-tov (Hebrew) to  yoNtev (Yiddish).

Subject: NYBC

I want to comment on something that someone wrote about the high prices
that the NYBC charges for its books.

To assume that because they get the books donated doesn't mean that they
should sell them cheaply. The NYBC has to support a large network to
guarantee that the books get collected, catalogued and distributed. It
costs a great deal. Staff time, space, the truck and publicity all factor
into it.

They are the only search service that I know of for used Yiddish books.
They provide an invaluable service and we would all be much poorer if
they didn't do it.

Their prices are determined by supply. I know of many cases where they
charge peanuts for some of their titles and others where I feel they
sometimes overcharge. It is all part of doing business. I'm not so sure
that I mind the idea of a high value being placed on Yiddish books. I can
think of far too many cases where they are thrown out.

I know a little about what I write. I am the manager of the Jewish Book
Center of the Workmen's Circle and to some extent am in competition with
them. It is viewed as a friendly one on both sides and I respect them a
great deal for what they do.

Subject: Greed and Lust

I've just read Jack Feldman's posting about his search for a rare
Russian-Ukrainian-Yiddish mathematical dictionary, a book that got away
from him twenty years ago.

I could not help but respond to the poignancy within that plea, for deep
within Yiddishkeit's love of learning and our love of the oysyelakh, that
world of words, is a powerful greed for the amassing of books, for
possessing them. And when a rare, truly beloved one gets away, we can
lust for it for a full twenty years or more.

I extend my sympathetic wishes that he rediscover it one day.

Is there a Mendelnik amongst us who has not suffered at least one such
loss?
