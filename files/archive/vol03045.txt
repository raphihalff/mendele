Subject: Introduction

My name is Randy Kloko.  Ikh bin a goy--with a name like 'Kloko',
you should expect a Klingon, already.  I work as a rare book
cataloger at Duke University; I deal with a lot of 17th-19th century
German texts.  My three chief passions are language, singing and
humor.  You can see why I'm interested in Yiddish.

What little I know of Yiddish comes from reading Leo Rosten's books,
a quick perusal of Weinreich's text and phrasebook, intense study of
a 1967 Lou Jacobi LP called "The Yiddish are Coming!", and most
recently, reading Salcia Landmann's "Jiddisch:  Abenteuer einer
Sprache".  At least the anecdotes.  I also sing with a group that
recorded "Shnirele Perele".  Finally, the only article I ever liked
in the "German Quarterly" was a discussion on the best system for
transcribing  Yiddish. (The conclusion: "Why don't you just learn to
read the Hebrew alphabet?")

Which brings me to a practical concern.  Which system of
transcription is preferred here, since I can't use Hebrew characters
anyway?

A groyssn dank,

Randy Kloko

year, here is a reprint of a very useful post by Zachary Harris.]

Subject:  YIVO transcription of Yiddish

There are three handy tables for the YIVO transcription of Yiddish:
(1) College Yiddish, by Uriel Weinreich (p. 26); (2) Modern
English-Yiddish Yiddish-English Dictionary, also by Uriel Weinreich
(English preface, p. xxi); and (3) Encyclopaedia Judaica, vol. 1
(Index vol.), p. 91.  In the latter source, please ignore "ch" as an
alternative trans- cription for "tes-shin."  "Ch" should NEVER be
used in ANY transcription or transliteration scheme aimed at English
speakers.  As an example of the confusion that this causes, see p.
15 of Chester G. Cohen's "Shtetl Finder" (Los Angeles: Perivale,
1980), where there are the following adjacent entries:

     Chmiliv (Chmielow, SW of Lublin) [pronounced KHMILIV]; Chmilov,
     Chemilov (Cmielow, SW of Lublin) [prounounced TSHMILOV or
     TSHMILEV]

There is one other YIVO-based transcription/transliteration scheme
for Yiddish, called ALA/LC (American Library Association/Library of
Congress), which is used in virtually all card and online library
catalogs in the U.S. The most visible difference between the YIVO
and ALA/LC schemes is in their respective handling of "zayin-shin" =
"zh" according to YIVO, and "zsh" according to ALA/LC. Thus, ALA/LC
is closer than YIVO to a pure transliteration system.  On the other
hand, both systems transcribe, rather than trans- literate
loshn-koydesh elements in Yiddish, although here, too, there are
differences between YIVO and ALA/LC.  For more information on ALA/LC
romanization, see "Hebraica Cataloging:  A Guide to ALA/LC
Romanization and Descriptive Cataloging," prepared by Paul Maher
(Washington, DC:  Library of Congress, Cataloging Distribution
Service, 1987).

Subject: Various

to meylekh: apology graciously accepted. and i'm happy you're
finally happy!

to leo goldstein: uh, there's a perfectly good 'old theory', i.e.
the classification of yiddish as a germanic language, sister of new
high german, daughter of middle high german, with strong effects of
language contact with semitic and (for eastern yiddish) slavic. so
i'm a little confused about what data you have in mind that we need
a new theory of...

to bob: that's wonderful! and a great informant you've got there...
(also sounds like a great baker.)

Subjects:  Wexler; Philologos

(A)  Thank you, one and all, for responding to my initial inquiry
about Paul Wexler's theories.  Doubtless my friend Reyzl K-W's
posting was also a major factor in the spirited conversation.

(B)  Philologos:  I asked the "Who is..." question back when I first
signed on to MENDELE.  [A conspiracy of?] silence greeted my
inquiry. I know two individuals who claim to know the individual's
identity, but are sworn to secrecy.  Fie! -- or should I say, Feh!
And then I have spoken to two others who say they know but whose
claims conflict with each other.  One says it's Gus Tyler
(implausible -- far too initimate a knowledge of the day-to-day
Israeli scene is found in "Philologos"); the other pronounces that
it's Hillel Halkin (more plausible:  HH writes under that byline for
the Forward, he lives in Israel, and he translates from Yiddish and
Hebrew into English), citing as his authority HH's mother.  And then
there's Reyzl's conjecture that Philologos is none other than Paul
Wexler, although I have my doubts -- at least as far as the previous
columns are concerned, since his romanization strays far from any of
the recognized standards (then again, the plural of "Chasid" (i.e.,
Hasid, Khosed) in the Forward is "Chasids", so go know). On the
basis of asides in earlier columns, we do know this about
"Philologos":  He's an American-born Israeli who made aliyah circa
1968.  Any more guesses, folks?

P.S.  The Slobodyanski affair would fit very nicely into a Philip
Roth plot (speaking of Phils).

Subject: Prayen and tetshn

Pe'rets Mett, et al:

"prayen" (to rhyme with "kayen" 'to chew') is cognate with Fr.
'prier' and is the usual Western Yiddish word in the expression
"mekhile prayen", 'to ask forgiveness (often/generally? of the
deceased)'. It also occurs in the Dutch Yiddish proverb "ungeprayte
gest zetst man bay di tir" ('uninvited guests--as at a wedding--are
seated at the door').

"tetshn" (to rhyme with "kvetshn") means 'to blow' as in 'sho(y)fer
tets Western Yiddish? Etymology? Will the Sadan Indexer out there
check this too?

Subject: Sissle/tsitsel

Bob Hoberman may have solved the mystery (and warm thanks from us
all for having done so) but there's always a new question: what
is the the etymology of tsitsele as in tittie/nipple?  Heb (tsits),
OF (cf. ModF teton)?  Efsher gor Sorbian?
