Subject: Betty Klein tapes

Does anyone know where to buy tapes of the Israeli singer Betty Klein?
I heard her singing recently in yiddish and ladino.   She was exquisite -
quite extraordinary. I'm trying to find tapes to give as Hannuka gifts,
but I don't find them in the record stores.   Also, does anyone know the
label?   Can anyone help?

Subject: Dorem-afrikanish

Joseph Sherman writes (5.179) of the late Sol Liptzin's "The Maturing of
Yiddish of Literature" that "it remains the single most important
published international recognition of the considerable achievement of
Yiddish artists" in South Africa.

I am certain Professor Liptzin would have agreed that it does nothing to
diminish our appreciation of his contribution to mention the anthology
_Dorem-afrikanish_, edited by the redoubtable Shmuel Rozhansky in Buenos
Aires.  And certainly Joseph Sherman would want to credit his Argentine
co-latitudinists!  If I may offer a few bibliographic details:

_Dorem-afrikanish_, unter der redaktsye fun Shmuel Rozhansky. Buenos
Aires: Yoysef Lifshits-fond fun der literatur-gezeleshaft baym YIVO;
1971, 360 pp. It has an added title page: La literatura Idish en Africa
del sur.

Rozhansky has for many years overseen the series _Musterverk fun der
Yidisher literatur_, of which the South African anthology is Number 50.

I myself have never read this volume, but I am very familiar with a
number of other titles in the same series. Typically, they include an
introduction by Rozhansky; perhaps 250 pages of excerpted chapters or
complete short stories from the field under survey; and then another 50
or more pages of historical and critical appraisals drawn from a range of
Modern Yiddish commentators.  As acute a commentator as Liptzin may have
been, and as attentive as he may have been to the then-recent scene in
South Africa, it would seem doubtful that his eleven-page English-lan-
guage treatment in "Maturing of Yiddish Literature" could compete in
scale or depth with that of the book-length Argentine survey, which is in
Yiddish, after all.  (I assume that by "international," Sherman was
referring to discussion outside of South Africa of the South African
scene; and not to discussion outside of Yiddish to the Yiddish scene.)

Rozhansky is now at an advanced age and much less active in recent years,
but it has not been so many years since I saw a notice of a speaking
appearance in New York City.  He was, by all accounts, understandably
devastated by the Buenos Aires bombing, which destroyed so much of the
archive he did so much to build.

If I may make one last comment, there is a small detail I have always
enjoyed with respect to spelling Rozhansky's name.  In Yiddish, it is
reysh-komets alef-zayen-shin-pasekh alef-nun-samekh-kuf-yud.  In Spanish
--as on the Spanish-language title pages on the (Yiddish) back- or
(Spanish) front-page of volumes in the Musterverk series-- it is always
transliterated as Rollansky.  This is because, while in most other modern
Spanish dialects the letter _tsvey_ ells (LL) is pronounced like 'y'
(amontillado = a-mon-ti-YA-do; llama = YA-ma), in the Argentine
pronunciation it is like the Yiddish _zh_ (_zhargon_, _zhurnal_,
Zhitlovsky, _patlozhelye_).  (_Patlozhelye was a risky example, and
_zhlob_ would be a bad one in this context, as the _lamed_ could easily
be confused with the non-liquid _tsvey_ ells of Rollansky:  don't make
this mistake!) There are two bibliographic records in the University of
California catalogue (where I happened to look it up on-line) for the
South African anthology.  One  gives the editor as Shmuel Rozshanski
(UCLA library), and the other cites Shemu'el Rozshanski (Berkeley
library). The Berkeley spelling (Shemu'el) is clearly less "Yiddish," is
it not?  But both faithfully denote (with an added 's') the presence of
the _shin_ following the _zayin_, but which seems to contravene the YIVO
transliteration convention for _zayen-shin_, which is 'zh'.  Or am I
misunderstanding that also?

Subject: Ghetto song "eykho"

Does anyone know where I can obtain the music of the ghetto song "eykho"?
There are two versions of the text in S. Kaczerginsky's collection, but
the melody was never printed as far as I know.
