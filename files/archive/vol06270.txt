Subject: Idiomatic expressions

Could anyone shed light on the origin of the following two sayings:

1. Tzveytn tog yontif... I always assumed that the second day of the
holiday was being refered to as a repeat of the previous. In that
context, reference to a person as a tzveytn tog yontif always meant to
me a person who was always "a day late and a dollar short." I'd like
the definitions from others.

2. Ale montik und donershtik... Likewise, I always assumed that every
Monday and Thursday alluded to  the days (other than Sabbath that the
Torah is read in the Synagogue and that in context it meant "on a
regular basis," or words to that effect.  Please tell me the origins.
Thanks again.

Top of Adar to you! Is it my imagination, or is the melody to "Mayn rue
plats" "influenced" by the Londonderry Air, better known as the Irish
"Danny Boy"?

Subject: Was Sholem Aleichem ahead of Sigmund Freud?

Sholem Aleichem (1859-1916) and Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) were
contemporaries.  As far as I can tell, neither ever mentioned the
other. That Freud mined Jewish jokes for insight is very clear, but he
seems to have overlooked the major Jewish humorist of his own era.
Freud probably understood Yiddish (both of his parents were born in
Yiddish-speaking areas of eastern Europe), probably used it in
childhood, but probably abandoned it as he advanced his education.

In one specific instance, Sholem Aleichem was ahead of Freud by about
a decade.  In his 1894 play, Yaknehoz, Sholem Aleichem has a character
tell a joke to illustrate a psychological point.  In 1905, Freud used
essentially the same joke to make much the same point in his _Jokes
and Their Relation to the Unconscious._  The point being that telling
the truth is not a simple matter of conveying facts.  How the listener
receives facts must be taken into account.

To paraphrase from Yaknehoz [Ale Verk Fun Sholem-Aleykhem, Nyu-York:
Folksfond Oysgabe, XXIV, p. 118]:

Faynkugl says: The greatest swindle is the truth.  Two Jewish business
meet on the train to Shpola, both going to the same town, both for the
same business to the same big shot.  Naturally, they try to hide
business secrets from each other.  One asks, "Where are you going?"
"To Shpola," says the other.  "Oh yeah?  Dealing with a Jewish
businessman is no joke I tell you. You are telling me you're going to
Shpola because you want me to think you are going to Boybrik.  But I
happen to know you really _are_ going to Shpola, so why are you trying
to mix me up?"

Freud, mining the same source, used Minsk and Pinsk for the same
point.  That is, one businessman says to his competitor that he is
going to Minsk to buy cotton.  The other one replies, "You are trying
to make me believe you're going to Pinsk to buy wheat, but I know for
a fact that you _are_ going to Minsk to buy cotton, so why are you
lying to me?"

Freud went on to say, " ...Is it the truth if we describe things as
they are without troubling to consider how our hearer will understand
what we say?" [Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious, by Sigmund
Freud, tr. James Strachey.  New York: W.W. Norton, 1960, p. 115.]

Sholem Aleichem probably eventually became aware of Freud's _talking
cure_ that was all the rage in the early 1900s.  In Sholem Aleichem's
_Dray Almones_ (Three Widows) written 1907 (Ale Verk fun
Sholem-Aleykhem, Folksfond Oysgabe, Vol. XXI, Monologn, pp. 163-212)
the angry narrator seems to be unburdening himself to a listener with
a psychological bent [Ir hot nokh gefunen dos rikhtike vort,
psikhologiye - pss!].  The narrator reveals his own character and
personality, despite himself.

Subject: Shmir zikh oys di shikh

In vol. 6.264, Marjorie Hirshan asked about the expression "shmir zikh
oys di shikh," used in response to thanks instead of "nishtu farvus".
My Kozhnitser grandparents often reply to "a shaynem dank" with "shmir
dikh ows'n shank," especially when they're in a joking mood;  I've
always assumed it to be a cutesy rhyme, used for the alliteration and
word-play, not for the content.  Is "shmir zikh oys di shikh" a
variation on "shmir zikh oys deym shank"?  Or is "shmir zikh oys deym
shank" is a cutesy version of "shmir zikh oys di shikh"?  (It seems
unlikely that they're unrelated, given that they're both used in
response to thanks.)

Subject: Shmir zikh oys di shikh

Yes, this expression lives in my memory! My dear Papa to whom I was
devoted often used the expression "shmir zikh oys di shikh ".   I
cannot  fathom the many times I would ask him to explain this
expression instead of a simple thank you and he would always smile and
say "that's the way it is. ....no explanation!"  ..... when I used
these words with our vinkl there were always raised eyebrows and not
one person who found a familiarity or rememberance of anyone saying
this in lieu of a "thank you".....no one until Marjorie Schonhaut
Hirshan's letter to  Mendele .... and I thank her for asking because
now there are two of us!  When I pressed my Papa for an explanation he
would agree that it was alright to say  "Nitto far vos" for an every
day "thank you"  und azoy hub ich oysgelernt unzer vinkl.  Zy gezundt
un a zisn freilechn Pesach tsu ale.

Subject: Vey iz mir (nit?)

I have often heard the expression "vey iz mir!" but recently came
across a slight variant that is puzzling. In Sholem Aleichem's dos
meserl, the boy's mother cries out "vey is mir nit!" when his father
gave him etlekhe petsh.

The translation I have (as a crib for my very limited Yiddish) just
translates that as the usual "Oh, woe is me!". Is the "nit" a local idiom,
or intensifier, or some sort of "wishing the woe away"?

a dank.

Subject: Star-Spangled Banner in Yiddish

I tried to follow up on a recent posting regarding a Yiddish version
of "The Star-Spangled Banner" in Adolph Mann's _Songs for My People_
copies of which were said to be available at the New York Public
Library.  I called the library  and they said it was indeed in their
computer.  But when I went there it turned out that it was not on the
shelf and was probably missing. I'd be grateful if the person who
posted this would share the Yiddish lyrics with this list or with me
personally.
