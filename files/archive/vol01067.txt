Subject: Columbus, a vaytig in zeiner baner!

My Yiddish is largely latent, and my memory of my Bubbeh's
expressions no doubt distorted by passage of years, BUT I
do recall her saying something like: "A broch auf
Columbus."  I think "broch" means something like "illness"
or "calamity," or simply, "curse."  In my recollection,
the whole family -- uncles, aunts, my parents -- would
occasionally say the same thing.  This is not a gend er
specific curse.  (Please forgive my eclectic orthography).

Aren Abramson supplies the curse "gay in drerd," glossed as
`go to hell!' Harkavy agrees. Literally though, it means
`go into the earth;' that is, `go die and get yourself
buried six feet under the earth where you won't bother me
with your kvetching any more.' "Drerd" is a contraction for
"der erd." All this from Harkavy as well; I must admit I
looked it up because of the similarity in sound of _drerd_
to _dreck_.

My father was in the "shmatih" business and, as i recall,
"klohks" was a yiddish accent version of "cloak."
"Shmatih" is the generic for any garment or rag.  sometimes
it meant a cheap-piece-goods, sometimes literally a rag,
sometimes ironically to refer to an expensive, but gaudy
garment, sometimes as a metaphor to refer to a person who
was ill used (having been treated as a shmatih, a rag),
sometimes, also, to refer to an expensive, tasteful garment
but in such a way that the evil eye would not be tempted to
rend it, since it was disguised, at least verbally, as a
rag.  At least, these are my recollections.
