Subject: petsha

My Ukrainian-Jewish family (from Izyaslavl) called it "p'tcheh."  I still
make it, as a hot soup, but with pipiks and chicken necks, as chicken feet
are not available and, in any case, beyond what I can handle in the
kitchen.  Our family variant is the following: after cooking the pipiks
forever in the broth with a chopped onion, add a lot of crushed garlic and
1 or 2 tbsp. white vinegar to 2 beaten egg yolks. Add a little of the hot
liquid to the yolk mixture to balance the temperature with the hot broth,
then add to broth and swirl through. The yolks should not solidify. Liquid
will be opaque and a lovely pale yellow. (I discard the necks, after
picking off the meat.)

Enjoy.

Rezinyor (rezonyor) is one of the types (amplua)in the traditional theater,
like hero, villain etc. If I am not mistaken, a rezonyor is something like
a friend-helper of a hero.

Subject: es toyg oyf kapores

One of my mother's favorite and frequently used expressions, which connotes
uselessness or helpless frustration, is "es toyg oyf kapores!"  I grew up
hearing it frequently and thought I always understood exactly what she
meant in context.  I never parsed out the obvious connection to the
rejection of religious rites. I'd be interested in an exegesis of the
origin of this expression. My hunch is that it may be broader and older
than a late 19th or early 20th century product of Eastern European Jewish
secularism. But I really haven't a clue.

Subject: Yiddish food words for Jews

Re: Jules Rabin's inquiry (v.17, no. 9): "Does anyone know of any Yiddish
food words that are used in reference to ourselves, generically?"

A somewhat-related term may be "a kosher kelbl (calf)," which was used --
especially among fiercely secular Yiddish-speakers -- to describe an
overly-sheltered, naive, observant Jewish young woman.  There was also
implicit the expectation that the "kelbl" was fit for, or about to be,
sacrificed on the altar of an arranged marriage.

There's also a vague memory floating under mayn vaysn kop (my white-haired
head) of "sherayim freser" as a negative term, from the same source, for
heyse khsidim (fervent Hasidim). (Sherayim being the leftovers at a revered
rebe's tish (rabbi's ceremonial table), for which his disciples would
scramble; freser being those who gorge as animals do).

Subject: -(e)lekh

The plural endings of diminutives may also be defined as -lekh/-elekh,
rather than -ekh, which does not occur in another context in Yiddish
(unlike some German dialects).

In her "Historische Jiddische Semantik" (Historical Yiddish Semantics,
2005), Erika Timm devotes a small chapter to the diminutive plurals on
-lekh and their historical development (p. 109-113).

They do still occur in parts of Franconia, as Hugh Denman notes, but are
unknown to many speakers of German. Their occurrence was more widespread in
the Middle Ages, but nowadays they are restricted to small areas. In 1592
Elias Schadaeus already wrote that the diminutive plural endings on
-(e)lekh were typical of the language of the Jews. These suffixes were not
known to him in his native German since he lived outside the "- ekh
territory."

These plural suffixes (-lekh and early variants -likh and -likht) were
standard in Yiddish even in most of the earliest (Western) Yiddish sources,
but under the influence of more northern German dialects and of Dutch, the
-kh diminutives eventually became more frequent in the Yiddish of the
northwestern part of Europe (but as far east as a western strip of Poland).

Subject: lokshn

Regarding the word "lokshn": please let me add that Brazilian Jews use it
as a slang to mean American dollars.
