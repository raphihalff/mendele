Gefrishte matse is a variant of matse bray.  A mixture of
matse meal, egg yolks, water and salt, with the egg whites
folded into, is spread on matse boards. Then you fry the
matse, batter side down, until golden.  As the matse fries,
the remaining batter is spread on the other side --then
flipped to fry.  Gefrishte matse is served warm or at room
temperature with cinnamon sugar.

a gutn appetit,

Subject: gefrishte broyt, gefrishte matse

M. Herzog, isn't (op)gefrishte broyt 'French toast' and not
stam 'toast'?  If so, then it's clear how gefrishte matse
is what's more commonly known as matse-bray -- gefrishte
must mean (by extension) 'bread (or bread-like food) fried
with egg'.

B.t.w., I say 'more commonly known' because matse-bray is
the form used in the "New Country".  I don't know whether
this or gefrishte matse was more common in the Old Country.
Does the Atlas know? Incidentally, in the Philadelphian
English of part of my family, French toast is known as _egg
toast_.  Anyone familiar with this?

Too modest, Eli, too modest. Tell us about the Cambridge
Codex, etc. Zay visn, that Volume 1 of The Atlas is in
press. And, of course, zay gezunt.

Mikhl.

Subject: vos far a gut-morgn, aza gut-yor

As many of us know, Yiddish greetings that have _gut_ in
them (gut-morgn, gut-yontev, gut-shabes, gutn ovnt
[pronounced: gut-novnt], etc., etc.) receive the reply
_gut-yor_, or the hearer of the greeting will repeat the
1st greeting and continue with _gut-yor_ (e.g., Person A:
gut-morgn. Person B: [gut-morgn,] gut-yor).  Also, upon
departing with a gutn shabes, a gutn yontev, etc., the
answer is _a gut yor_.

It's been frequently pointed out that numerous of Yitskhok
Bashevis [Isaac Bashevis Singer]'s work have never been
published in book form in their original language --
mame-loshn.  Many have only been printed in serialized form
in the Yiddish press (particularly, the _Forverts_).
Furthermore, it's been noted that many of Bashevis'
writings have been translated into scores of languages --
from the *English*.  Nu, perhaps one can't much complain
about the translations from English into Japanese (although
there actually have been numerous Japanese who have studied
Yiddish over the past twenty years)

But even the translations from the Yiddish original into
English, it seems, leave something to be desired.  (All the
more reason to be wary of the retranslations of these works
into languages other than English.)  Khaye-Ester (Corinne)
Karlin, a Penn student in Beginning Yiddish, showed me this
translated line from Bashevis' _The Penitent_ (translation
of _Der bal-tshuve_), pg. 123:  "'Good evening, good year,'
I replied."  The Yiddish original is, of course: - gutn
ovnt.  - gutn ovnt, gut-yor - hob ikh geentfert. In her
words, "If I weren't studying Yiddish, I would have no idea
why he said this and would try to interpret some hidden
meaning into it."  The translator, by the way, is Joseph
Singer (Bashevis' nephew).

It's wonderful that recipes vary as much as dialects of
Yiddish.  Both my grand mothers, and my mother (and me)
would not think of making sweet motzah brie. But then my
father even salted herring before he tasted it. (No, he
didn't have high blood pressure).
