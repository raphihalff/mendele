Subject: Acronyms

     One of the three lectures I gave for this summer's
Workmen's Circle "Jewish Cultural Experience" at Circle
Lodge was on humor in the Yiddish proverb.  Among the
mechanisms of humor I dis- cussed was the use of
abbreviations or acronyms.  Among my examples were the
following:

1) "Khazn" makht:  khazonim zaynen naronim.

2) "Zikne" makht:  ziftsn, krekhtsn, nisn, hus(t)n.

3) Az men tut a shidekh, zol men kuken oyf der kales kni.
(KNY = keren, nadn, yikhes.)

4) Er is a guter betsedek.  (BTsDK = 'biz tsu der
keshene'.)

5) Men meg im shikn nokhn "yaknhoz".  (YKNHZ = yayin,
kidush, ner, havdole, zman, the five blessings at the end
of the sabbath; used to name an imaginary thing that a fool
is sent to get.)

6) Mit "Shrage" ruft men oyf, ober a kon ken men nit
oysnemen. (Pun on the Hebrew name Shrage, used to call a
man with the Yiddish name Fayvl to the Torah, and the
acronym ShRGA = sheln 'diamonds', royt 'hearts', grin
'spades', aykhl 'clubs'.  With one card from each suit one
cannot win a jackpot.)

Subject: "es","dos"(ellen prince)

es and dos need not be at the beginning of a sentence to
mean roughly "it" and "this",respectively.but in colloquial
usage they are often just fillers and don't refer to
anything.this is the way i would understand it in my
mameloshn.

Subject: question for mischa van vlaardingen

i was told that there are two words in dutch--at least in
amsterdam 'slang'--that are very close to 'balebos', one
meaning 'bully' and the other meaning something else, but
also not unrelated to the sense of 'balebos'. (something
like bolleboos? ballebaas? something like that?) is this at
all familiar to you? also, do you know the origin of the
dutch word baas 'boss'? i'm curious because the english
word 'boss' is claimed to have come from caribbean dutch
'baas' but i haven't been able to find an etymology for
dutch 'baas'. given that we know there were jews in the
dutch caribbean (the oldest synagogue in the western
hemisphere is in curacao, for example) and given the
phonological and semantic relationship between 'baas' and
'balebos' and given the fact that we know dutch did borrow
words from yiddish, it's hard not to fantasize that english
'boss' might ultimately be from yiddish 'balebos'! any
insights you could give on this would be very much
appreciated. a dank!
