Subject: Placement of the Verb in Yiddish sentences

I have read the debate for several issues and cannot understand why
it is lasting so long. The rule governing the placement of the verb
in a Yiddish sentence is one of the few gramatical rules in the
history of linguistics to which there are no exceptions.

The usage is as follows:

In sentences which are in the imperative, the verb is the first
sentence unit

In all other sentences, the verb is the second sentence unit.

Yes or no Questions (e.g. geit ir in shul?) may appear to be
exceptions to those rules but they are not. In a yes or no question
which starts with a verb, the word "tsi" is always either spoken or
implied, prior to the verb. So the actual for of the question is
"tsi geit ir in shul?"

There is no more to it than that. Of course you will find examples
in poetry and literature where the author has taken license, but
these examples fall outside the rules of grammar.

This information is brought to you from a family of native Yiddish
speakers who use the language on a daily basis.  My mother is also a
teacher of Yiddish language and grammar.

Subject: Dutch sh

I am a Dutch speaker (although not native). Sch is pronounce
something akin to skh, and yes, sj is how one writes sh. However, it
is not all that common a sound in Amsterdam Dutch.

A little "grapje" about that - when I had been in the Netherlands
for a few months, and was proud of my relative fluency, working in a
Dutch firm speaking only Dutch, I had the opportunity to overhear a
customer spekaing what sounded like a very strange Dutch to me. A
foreign, obviously.

I somewhat arrogantly asked where the man was from, later, of my
boss, and said that I thought I had mastered such sounds as "sch"
much better - he laughed and told me the man was actually Flemish
and was speaking Flaams, which does not so distinguish the sch
sound. Oh well I hope this helps.

Subject: Yiddish New Testament

A friend of mine just lent me a copy of a New Testament translated
into Yiddish  I would like to know if anyone on MENDELE has heard of
it.  The translator was one Aaron Krolenbaum and the book was
printed in 1950 by Evangeliipress in O:rebro, Sweden.  The publisher
is listed as: Million Testaments Campaign, 1505 Race Street
Philadelphia, PA.

It is a pocket sizes, hard-cover book, which includes relevant
verses from Tanakh.  The book includes a statement from a Rev. P. P.
Levertoff.

The style is very modern -- there is no attempt at a stylized
Daytshmerish.  Interestingly, the translator uses the Jewish forms
to express certain things.  For example, he calls the Yiddish New
Testament a "seyfer" and urges people to "mispalel zayn" that God
will reveal the truth in reading the book.  He also calls the verses
"psukim" -- is there a non-Jewish form for verses, or is that
normal?

Subject: Mentsh un froy

Dear Mendlnikes, I will abstain from begging my beloved colleagues
to please use YIVO transcriptions tsum veynikstn ven me shraybt in

On the subject of "mentsh un froy" let us recall that in Sholem
Aleykhem's Taybele, the main character says referring to herself "a
froy iz oykh a mentsh" This is a very early work by S.A.-- 1884.

Zayt gezunt,

Dvosye Bilik
