Subject: translating Yiddish poetry

I'm glad Hershl Hartman took up Leah Zazulyer's question about translating
Yiddish poetry, and I hope that people like Kathryn Hellerstein and
Joachim
Neugroschel, to name only two of those who are both expert Yiddishists
and
distinguished translators of poetry, respond to the questions that are being
asked here.  I don't suppose that Reb Hershl would care to name the
research
institution and Yiddish literary work he refers to, in the case where - as
is all too usual - a cheaper translation was preferred to a better one? 
        
As for my own views - I'm an admirer of the translations translational ideas
of Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig, so I guess that makes me, in
relation
to a lot of kinds of translation, a fanatical literalist.  But poetry is an
area where I'm not so doctrinaire, and am less certain of principles and
more certain that certain translations are excellent, and certain other
translations are not. 
        
I am certain, though, that there hasn't been enough talk about how Yiddish
poetry is being translated.  I'm thinking of the Howe/Wisse/Shmeruk
_Penguin
Book of Modern Yiddish Verse_, and how none of the reviews of that book,
of
the ones I saw at any rate, gave serious, judicious consideration to the
wide variety of translational practices and principles being made use of in
the book.  I'd be grateful, in fact, for any references people might supply
to excellent essays on this subject, or to particular insightful reviews of
translations of Yiddish poetry.  (There's a very interesting Glatshsteyn
review of a translation of Nelly Sachs' poems _into_ Yiddish, in _In der
velt mit yidish_, but that's something different .)
        
So, in the hope of hearing a lot more on this, al dos guts, 
Larry Rosenwald

Subject: translation of Yiddish poetry

I feel I need to respond briefly to what was most recently said about the
translation of Yiddish poetry (esp. into English) and the 'failure' of some
translators to capture certain elements, 'rhyme' being one of the key
examples used.  Of course, volumes have been written about the theory of
translation and what the best techniques are, but I'd still like to give my
two cents. Generally speaking, a _truly_ 'faithful' translation of any
literary work is impossible. Two languages, like Yiddish and English, are
very different. There are rarely one-to-one correspondences, in
vocabulary,
for instance, and in the very sounds themselves. If a Yiddish poet uses, for
example, something like an iambic meter, it is a very different thing than
if an English poet uses that same meter. They 'mean' different things
based
on how the language works and, much more complicatedly, on the
language's
cultural nuances and associations. Nabokov suggested that his preference
was
for an ocean of footnotes on which to float as 'literal' a translation as
possible. Sometimes, I must admit, that sounds like a good idea. But a
translation is a creative act. A translator cannot help but to put something
of himself into his translation - to 'add' to the author's text. The most
responsible thing a translator can do, in my opinion, is to contemplate the
work long and hard, reflect, and figure out what s/he honestly believes to
be the 'sense' or 'meaning' of the poem, and work from there to "translate"
all of its elements into the 'atmosphere' of the second language. This might
mean losing words, or rhymes, or cadences from the original. But every
translation must necessarily lose many things. It is the strong translation,
though, that captures the _feeling_ of those effects.

Subject: Translating Yiddish Poetry

Hershl Hartman wants Yiddish translators of poetry to adhere to the poets
rhyme and rhythm. What might be lost by this is the poet's meaning.  One
must make a determination -- only for translating purposes, not for original
work -- whether form is to be preserved, even if the meaning changes; or
whether the poet's vision and meaning must be preserved. The nuances of
language, on which poetry often depends, cannot easily be carried from
one
language to another, even if equivalent words are found. As I said in my
note on translation in the prefatory material of my translation of I. J.
Schwartz's magnum opus, Kentucky: Poetry is a blend of form and
meaning. It
can never be restated, even in the same language, and remain the same.
Often
translators of poetry impose a different rythmic form than that of the poet.
They create something different thereby, which is their own and not the
poet's. 

Often, an injustice is done to the poet's intention. Stanley Burnshaw
believes that the original and the translation should be published side by
side. And he states that the obligation of the translator is to relay what
the poet is saying. I agree.

Subject: Yiddish poetry translations in the English Forward

I am one of the frequent contributors of English translations of Yiddish
poetry in the English Forward. I have also published three volumes of
translations of Yiddish poetry, one by Glatstein, one by Sutzkever, and one
by Zychlinsky. I am sure that Leah Zazulyer knows that something has to
be
lost in any translation, however skillful--either the precise meaning, the
tone, the meter, the rhyme, the rhythm, or the style, or several of them,
must be lost or weakened. It also goes without saying that the translator is
rarely, if ever, as good a poet as the original author (furthermore, when a
very good poet has made translations of Yiddish poetry, he or she is often
very cavalier about sticking closely to the original--often the poet
swallows the original, digests it, and spits it out as a new poem in his or
her own style and bearing only a faint family resemblance to the original). 

For myself, I try very hard to maintain the tone and accuracy first. In my
three books, I decided to forego rhyme in favor of very precise rendering of
the meaning.To be sure, it is sometimes possible to get a very nice
rhyming
translation (az es lozt zikh), which adds to the charm and the reading
pleasure with only minimal loss of precision of translation. I have done
this in some of the poems I have translated for the Forward. When one
attempts a singable translation of a poem that has been set to music,
which
I have also done in some of the Forward translations, one is in a
particularly stringent vise: the rhyme and meter MUST be maintained to
make
it singable to the original music, and accuracy may (or may not)  suffer
slightly. I am quite proud of some of my singable translations, particularly
O Guter Fraynd, by Dovid Edelstadt. If that's one of the ones Leah
Zazulyer
thinks are inadequate, then we have a difference of opinion (not unheard
of
in poetry, whether original or translated). 

In conclusion, I might add that I found the tone of Ms Zazulyer's
comments rather patronizing.

Subject: Sholom Aleichem Curriculum

To the Mendele List Readers:

The Sholom Aleichem Web Site, "www.sholom-aleichem.org" which is
produced
with the assistance of the SA Memorial Foundation requests information
from
educators for the purpose of developing an on-line curriculum.  This
curriculum is to be varied based upon the work and life of Sholom
Aleichem. 
All age groups are targeted, the outline will separate material for younger
audiences.  Courses that are currently offered by professors/teachers
which
need to remain intact, will be presented as such, with proper credit to all
submissions. 

The site will be upgrading to include a discussion group - with password
access - in addition to real audio etc.  All suggestions are welcome

Thank you --

Subject: Sholem Aleichem & Dineson: Defenders of the Legacy

We who treasure our legacy of Yiddish language, literature and culture are
devoted to maintaining our contact with that legacy.  However, we quickly
learn it's a rather fragile enterprise.  I was emphatically reminded of that
the other day when I addressed the Oakland, California chapter of
Hadassah. 
About ten percent could understand Yiddish well enough to follow a
paragraph.  The age range was perhaps early fifties to about eighty.  Even
those up in age had lost touch to a major degree. 

Because of its fragility, the enterprise cannot endure too many injurious
insults (such as the charge of "irrelevance") and needs defense.  It's an
old story.  The need to defend Yiddish was uppermost in Sholem
Aleichem's
mind and heart in 1888.  Sholem Aleichem was fresh from aggravating
encounters with Israel Levy, publisher of Yiddish who made a living from
Yiddish and despised Yiddish and harassed Yiddish writers including
Sholem
Aleichem. 

Below is a letter written by Sholem Aleichem in 1888 expressing gratitude
to
Yakov Dineson for a defense of Yiddish, and incidentally, an opinion that
German had too great an influence on Dineson's Yiddish.  The need for
defense against Germanization also continues today.  Just take a look at
the
latest Pakntreger and see the Germanic orthography of the Yiddish.  The
given reason for that is respect for the possible intention of the author. 
In my opinion, it is a weak excuse that caters to a fancied wish of the
author while ignoring the realistic, pedagogical needs of learners of today. 
Further, could the author's intentions include the confusing typographical
errors in the Yiddish?  These must utterly confound and discourage any
young
learner of Yiddish.  We old timers can see through those errors and shrug
them off, but the fragile, labor-intensive enterprise of maintaining contact
through teaching Yiddish is thus needlessly injured. 

Here is my translation of a relevant part of Sholem Aleichem's letter to
Yakov Dineson (Yivo Bleter 1: 395, 1931).  It is laced with his
characteristic light irony.  In this letter, Sholem Aleichem used the word ,
zhargon, for the Yiddish language.  Zhargon had been a derisive term for
Yiddish, but years of usage in Eastern Europe had made it a neutral term
by
1888.  The word was later to regain its power to insult.  Dineson's defense
of Yiddish was published in Dos Yidishe Folksblat, 1888, No. 2, entitled
Ver
Mit Vos Darf Zikh Shemen?  (Who Need be Ashamed of What?). 

Kiev, Jan. 18, 1888
My dear friend and comrade!

Thanks, O thank you! To you, my heartfelt gratitude for your passionate
defense of Yiddish, and for arguing its case. 

This is the first time I have seen your writing.  I like it, and yet I don't
like it.  It has fire, and for that I like it.  Yet I disapprove because it
is more German than Yiddish.  I can provide the explanation: for those of
us
in the lands once ruled by Poland, it is German, while for you, in the
Baltic regions, it's Yiddish. 

And yet it's good.  It is earnest and true, with genuine understanding.  If
I myself had made a serious try at that, I would have shot out like a
cannon, and covered myself with fire.  And you wisely avoided that.
Without
rancor, you weighed and measured your words, really like a German.  You
erred in only one aspect: you directed reproaches toward Professor Graetz
[a
Jewish historian].  It reminds me of how Spector [Mordecai Spector, a
writer/editor friend of Sholem Aleichem] was highly incensed, carried on a
debate with Suvorina and Pikhno [editors of the anti-Semitic newspapers,
Novoya Vremya (St. Petersburg), and Kievlianin (Kiev)] and treated them
like
garbage.  But I couldn't bear to witness the suffering of those wild
fellows, so I wrote to Spector thus: "Mighty King!  Hear my prayer, and
have
pity on Pikhno and Suvarina!  Do not dirty their faces in the Folks-Blat!  I
implore you!  Have mercy on their wives and children, and let them be. 
Enough!  Is there no limit to punishment?" etc...  ....  
Your good friend,
Sholem Aleichem.

Subject: Al Damato and Philologus (Forward, Oct. 30)

I don't know if Al Damato subscribes to Mendele,but Philologus surely
does.
A search of the Mendele archives will surely turn up something I've written
in the past about their current concern with Yiddish anatomical terms. No,
Yiddish _pots_ (English _putz_) has nothing to do with German _Putz_. It's
rather a form of a word known throughout the Aegean area, at least in
Greek
and in Turkish) that refers, among other things to: SURPRISE!!, the female
genitalia and the cleft in the buttocks. 

Look it up!

This song, among other places, can be heard (not read) on The Barry
Sisters'
CDs "The Barry Sisters - Their Greatest Yiddish Hits" (Legacy
International,
under license from Rhino Records, catalogue # 336) and "The Barry
Sisters"
(Banner Records, catalogue # 1009). The Mloteks have also written about
it
in their "Leyener dermonen zikh lider" some 2 years ago. However, in
Moldavia (up until lately) we used to sing virtually identical lyrics
combined with those of "Mekhuteneste mayne" into one song (with the
melody
of the latter): 

Mekhteyneste mane, mekhteyneste getraye!
Vus geysti arupgelozt di nuz?
Vus geysti arupgelozt di nuz?
In tomer vilsti visn ver s'iz dan mishpukhe,
