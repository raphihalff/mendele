Subject: Call for Yiddish speakers

I'm collecting samples of Yiddish conversation for my Ph.D. dissertation.
I'm especially interested in finding young adults and children (or
grandparents who live with grandchildren), who speak Yiddish regularly at
home.  If you live in the Los Angeles area and would like to participate
in video and audio recording of conversation, please get in touch.  If
you live elsewhere, but have or can make recordings (preferably video,
but audio is fine, too) of everyday sorts of conversations, I'd be
grateful for those and for being in touch with others who recognize the
necessity of keeping our beautiful language alive and promoting interest
in it.

Does anyone know the origin or writers of these songs?

Subject: Alte zachen

Chane (Alice) Honig writes about the origin of the word 'bunkie'.  My
parents also came from a shtetl near Byalistock, called Grajevo, and I do
not recall ever having heard the word being used.  Must be a family
expression.

On another matter, she wrote about the Molly Picon show she saw.  I am
brought  back to memories as a child attending Yiddish theatre on the
Lower East Side on a regular basis.  I also recall having seen the
original Yankele played by Molly Picon and her husband, Jacob Kalish.
Yes, she was something else.  Also she loved to show her physical agility
in moving around the stage, even when the calendar in later years told
her to act her own age.

Are there any other Mendelniks out there that have memories needing to be
refreshed about the state of the Yiddish theatre in its heyday when
Second Avenue was called the Yiddish Rialto and theatre patrons liked to
look through the windows of the Cafe Royal to get a glimpse of their
favorite stars.  (This last comment does not apply to my sister, living
in New York City, who also reads Mendele and has a pretty sharp memory as
well.)

Subject: Transcription, not romanization

Leonard Mathless has raised the question of the treatment of Hebrew--and,
I should think, Aramaic--words in the transcription of Yiddish; however,
he thinks of it as romanization. In our work on the YIVO orthography for
presentation on Mendele, one difference between Shleyme Axelrod and me
has been my unhappiness with the implicit confusion between replacing the
_letters_ of a non-roman script with roman letters and the _transcribing_
of the sound units ("phonemes") of a language. The YIVO tables as given
here should enable any of our members who wish to avail themselves of it
to write down Yiddish words or even full messages as they say them,
whether it be in "Standard" Yiddish or any particular regional or socil
variety of the language. Thus. it is unreasonable to demand of such an
orthography that one be able to recover the original spelling of each
word in its native script, even though this will happen to be feasible
much of the time.

Does the ordinary Yiddish speaker always know when he or she is using a
word of Semitic origin? What about the Slavic component in the lexicon?
Should one be able to read through a transcription and automatically
recover the underlying Polish, Ukrainian, or Russian spelling?

For our purposes here, the only virtue I see in the problem raised by
Mathless is in the matter of code-switching. If the Hebrew-Aramaic word
is integrated in the Yiddish lexicon, what I have been saying should be
relevant. If, however, one is quoting the Hebrew Bible or, say, a
Judeo-Aramaic passage from the Talmud, we might argue that the person is
switching codes at that moment, i,e, switching from Yiddish as such to a
quotation in another language either in speech or writing. (If Henry
James writes in English, "Later we can stroll to the quartiers serieux"
we have a similar situation.)

At this moment, I have no answer for the last question. I doubt that it
will come up very often in our exchanges.In a true _transliteration_ (not
a transcription), the Hebrew or Aramaic is rendered by philologists in a
letter-by-letter conversion from Hebrew script to Roman script. Thus the
Hebrew word for 'ban' will be translitered  h.rm, although a transcrip-
tion for modern Hebrew might be /kherem/ and for its use as a Yiddish
word, /kheyrem/.

In code-switching, then, should a Hebrew quotation be rendered in the
YIVO writing for Yiddish,giving the Yiddishized Ashkenazic Hebrew that is
normal, or should some conventional LC system, or the like, be used? I
don't know.

To complicate the matter, it seems to me that the line between words from
the Semitic component of the Yiddish lexicon and Hebrew or Aramaic
quotations is sometimes blurred, because certain pithy sayings from the
Tanakh or the Talmud could be said to have become lexicalized in Yiddish.

The professional Yiddishists in our group may be able to shed light on
this topic.

Subject: Bubbeh-baby games

What bubbeh-baby games can Mendelniks suggest on the order of
"patchie-patchie kikhelekh"?  Does anybody know of a published resource,
or can some of you describe some games like patchie-patchie to play with
an infant?  Much obliged.

Subject: EEJH list

> *NEW* EASTERN EUROPEAN JEWISH HISTORY AND KHAZAR STUDIES LIST
>             majordomo@beacon.bryant.edu
>             subscribe eejh

I should clarify that I have no connection with this list, other than
having received the posting that I forwarded to Mendele. I subscribed
briefly to make sure that the list was what it claimed to be and relevant
to Mendele subscribers, and confirmed that it was. It seems to be quite
active.  I've unsubscribed now, but the ongoing discussion at the moment
relates to the origins of the word "yarmulke" and whether the Karaites
had a connection to the Khazars.

Subject: Petrishke

Mottel Lakin's question about "hefker petrishke" elicited a fair
amount of comment and some question as to whether petrishke is a
parsnip or parsley.  Weinreich says the latter and so did a number of
our correspondents, so parsley it is.

Nevertheless it bothered me that petrishke _wasn't_ a parsnip or
pasternak (pastinaca sativa). As a boy I was sent to the grocery pretty
regularly to buy a petrishke mit a meyerl (two cents in real 1927 money,
ober nisht dos bin ikh oysn) and I remember that along with the green
stuff was a root that certainly looked like what I now know to be
parsnip.  Question: was the petrishke of that lost past the green stuff
with an attached root or the root with some attached green stuff?  As a
reference point, the parsley I dug up the other day had a scrawny pitiful
root. Not the kind I brought home from Mr. Gittis' grocery store.  So
there was a problem.

Maybe I should have called this piece: "A la recherche du persil perdu"?
Or "Ceci n'est pas une madeleine"?

Yesterday comes a herb catalog from which I learn that parsley (petro-
selinum) has not only a curled group P. crispum crispum ("French") and a
plainleaf group P. crispum neapolitanum ("Italian") but a _third_ group
P. crispum tuberosum ("Hamburg").  And this third variety is described as
follows:

    Both leaves and its slender parsnip-like root are used.  Roots are
    excellent for flavouring soups, stews, or steamed to serve with
    butter or sauce.

That's more like it: azoy redt men!  Though I can't swear that it's so
I'm ready to believe.  That, khusheve fraynt, is my contribution to
matters botanical.  And, Mr. Gittis, wherever you are, zayt mir gezunt.
