Subject: Serdatsky's "Lilien"

Kenneth Wishnia [Vol.6.186] wonders about the phrase "Lilien's Queen of
the Night" in a a 1912 "Forverts" issue.  I wonder if that's not simply
a typo for "Lilith, Queen of the Night"?  Typos, known fondly as
"drekfeler(s)" in Yiddish, are not exactly foreign to newspapers,
especially Yiddish ones.

Could this Lilien be the very propminent Jewish woodcut artist, whose
works graced so many early 20th century Yiddish poetry books?

Subject: Serdatsky's "Lilien"

Kenneth Wishnia asked in Mendele Vol 6.186 who Lilien might be.

There is a famous Jewish artist, Ephraim Moshe Lilien, who worked around
the turn of the century/beginning of the 20th century. His work is
typically Jugendstil (art nouveau). He dealt with a lot of Jewish
Biblical themes.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Serdatsky's "Lilien"

E.M. Lilien was a prominent graphic artist at the turn of the century.
He was Jewish and active in Zionist affairs, but his art centered on
both secular and Jewish themes. Martin Buber included him in his 1903
anthology _Juedische Kuenstler_.  Surely the Queen of the Night is
Mozart's famous coloratura part from The Magic Flute. I am not aware
that Lilien made an image of her, but it would have been a natural for
his style (art nouveau, or Jugendstil as it was known in Germany), as
well as his milieu (Munich and Vienna).  You might consult Lothar
Brieger's 1922 volume on Lilien (in German) for possible illustrations
and further information. If you can't find Lilien illustrations easily,
just imagine a kind of Aubrey Beardsley rendition, not a portrait of any
particular opera star.

I hope this helps.

****

I ask you in advance, dear Mendelyaner,  to excuse the error-ridden
Yiddish you're about to find here.  It is unfortunate that I can't do
better.

Not long ago, Mimi Halkin wrote (Vol 6.170) that she is very thankful
for the Mendelyaner who append an English translation to their Yiddish
postings on Mendele.  I would like to add my appreciation to hers.

I am sure I'm not the only Mendelyaner who can understand, and perhaps
also speak Yiddish much better than I can read or write it.  For me
(us?), a translation comes in very handy.  Even if I understand most of
the yiddish that is found on Mendele, I'm often missing (don't
understand) words that I would like to look up in a dictionary (I have
Weinreich).  But the problem is,  to do that one needs to first spell
out with hebrew characters the yiddish words that are found written with
english characters on Mendele ... and then go to the dictionary!  That's
a tough job for my little head!

If someone knows of a Yiddish-English dictionary where the Yiddish words
are arranged according to English characters,  it would be a real
god-send (lit. true cure).  If not (and I do fear such a thing doesn't
really exist), then be assured that you have a very appreciative
audience for your attached translations.

Subject: Nevura

Recently in my communications with mendelyaner, I used the word "nevura"
for "truth".

I learned the word from my parents, who were Polish Jews, from Lodz,
specifically.

I was surprised to find that my correspondents had never heard of the
word or did not know what the word meant.  I then looked for it in my
Weinreich dictionary and could not find it, both under the Yiddish and
under the English sections (in the latter, I looked under "Truth").

Can someone tell me if the word is common in Yiddish, and if so, what is
its exact meaning, and its origin?

I look forward to your responses.

Jeff Neiman
