Subject: Universities with degree programs in Yiddish

In response to Shalom Goldberg's request for schools that offer degree
programs in Yiddish, the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor offers degree
programs.  Their Graduate School library has a large collection of
Yiddish books.

Subject: Af and oyf

When we discuss romanisation problems, I believe we should make a clear
distinction between phonetic transcription and transliteration. For
purposes of broad phonetic transcription (preferably in square brackets,
so that the reader is clear that this is what it is) we will for example
write (if a klal-yidish pronunciation is intended): [af der gas],
[ufheybn] and [lebn] but [lept]. In a trasliteration we will write: 'oyf
der gas', 'oyfheybn', 'lebn', 'lebt', but 'af der gas' if the text we
are transcribing was spelled pasekh-alef fey, e.g. by a Soviet Yiddish
writer. The virtue of this practice is that it is reversible and this is
of particular importance for the bibliographer.

However, a curiosity of standard scientific practice is that for the
sake of readability we do, in fact, insert phonetic transcription of
loshn-koydesh items into our otherwise transliterated romanisations:
'loshn-koydesh' is a case in point. It is, of course, possible to follow
Library of Congress practice and tranliterate these items also as if
they were Hebrew/ Aramaic. It just looks a little awkward.

Subject: The prefix "tse"

The prefixes "tse-" and "tsu-" are  unfortunately often confused, although
each serves a completely different and distinct function.

The prefix "tsu-," among a number of other meanings, often carries the
meaning of _to_ with the verb infinitive, for example:  tsumakhn [to close],
tsutulyen, or doubled tsutsutulyen [to cuddle], tsuzogn [to promise],
tsureydn [to advise, urge].

Whereas the prefix "tse-" connotes splitting, taking apart, fragmentation,
dispersion.  Examples:  tsebrekhn [break], tseglidern [dissect], tsevorfn
[scatter], tseshoybert [disheveled]

In his comment on the subject "s' hitset" (6.075,3), Rick Turkel
is on the right track about the meaning of the "tse-" prefix, but when he
adds an /r/ after it, even in parentheses., for example, "tse(r)brokhn," it
becomes _Unyiddish_.  The /r/ addition is strictly German, therefore totally
superfluous in Yiddish.

By the way, when he translates "tse(r)kokht" (sic) as "overkooked" he is not
necessarily correct.  "Tsekokht" is more likely to be a reference to
someone's overheated temperament.

The research, care, and deep love that Sol Steinmetz invested in his book _A
Century of Yiddish in America:  Yiddish and English_ are evident in every
page.  But notwithstanding an author's almost superhuman efforts, no book can
totally escape the blemish of a typographical error.

Thus, in his excellent Yiddish-English glossary, a very careful and
responsible compendium of Yiddish words all properly romanized, one finds the
following error (Appendix II, p. 146):  "tsudreyt" [confused, unhinged],
tsudreyter [mixed-up person].  These words should, of course, read
"tsEdreyt," "tsEdreyter."

This small finding does in no way diminish the value of the lovely book.  The
Glossary (pp. 114 - 148)  consists of some twelve hundred Yiddish words,
phrases, and idioms, and may well serve as a guide to proper romanization.
