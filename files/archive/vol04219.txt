Subject: id/yid, ippies/yippies

A fellow-Mendelyaner writes that he and his "idene" went visiting last
week.  Now, "idene", "id","idn", "idish" were so pronounced 60 years ago
when I was the child of Litvakes in Brooklyn.  That was also the
spelling: [shtumer alef-yud-daled ...].  "Yid-", etc., beginning
[yud-khirek yud], have now become standard.  The Yiddish Forverts has
resisted the standardization, and, with a few exceptions, like the
Mloteks' contributions, continues with  "id-", etc.

Fair enough, I guess:  two Jews, three shuls, as the joke has it.  But
look what the resistance to [yud-khirek yud] has led to.  In their
obituary of Jerry Rubin, the Forverts writes (12/2/94, p. 28) "er iz
geven, tsuzamen mit abi hofman un poul krasner, a mitgrinder fun di
'ipis' [shtumer alef-yud-pey-yud-samekh], di rosheteyves [initial
letters] fun 'yut interneshonal parti'."  Thus,  while acknowledging
through their yiddishization that the English nick-name of the group must
have been "Yippies", the editors seem forced to write it as if the
English word were "Ippies".

Subject: Thank-yous to Zellig Bach and Mikhl Herzog

I deeply appreciate Zellig Bach's "Campaign for a new edition of
Steinmetz's book" (4.90 and 4.213). Allow me, however, to correct the
e-mail addresses at the University of Alabama Press. They are:

             nmitchell@ua1vm.ua.edu

                       and
             jzigler@ua1vm.ua.edu

The title of my book is _Yiddish and English: A Century of Yiddish in
America_.

Oykh a hartsikn yasher-koyekh tsu undzer khoshevn khaver un lerer, mikhl

This work-in-progress, _The Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic
Jewry_, is one of the great monuments of Yiddish scholarship. Marvin
(mikhl) Herzog is performing a tremendous service to Yiddish dialectology
and linguistics in bringing to completion the work conceived by Uriel
Weinreich, of blessed memory, and launched by him and Professor Herzog.
The introductory material is brilliant, especially Chaper IV (The
Systematic Dialectology of Yiddish), and the series of maps are stunning
in their detail and comprehensiveness. The work is bilingual, equally
useful to Yiddish speakers and Anglophones not proficient in Yiddish. No
scholarly work on the dialects of Yiddish can be done today without
reference to this great work.

Subject: Kristlen un yidlen

Attributed to Heinrich Heine, I believe. It refers to the fact that
Jewish fashion follows Christian fashion. Maybe he was prophesying the
phenomenon of glatt kosher chinese restaurants. mit kovid

Subject: Biz 120

The former conductor of the San Jose, CA symphony orchestra is named
George Cleve.  His father was well into his 90s when he died and I would
frequently visit him to talk Yiddish.  He once confided in me that, as a
youngster when studying medieval German poetry in a largely Gentile
class, "the other students were having trouble, but to me it was mostly
Yiddish."

Anyway, to my point: whenever I would, in reference to him, say, "biz a
hundert und tsfantsik" he always corrected me by saying, "a hundert und
fehrtsik."  When I would inquire why, his response was always the same:
"Inflation!"

Felix Cleve was, perhaps, the world's leading authority on Anaxagoras and
I concluded this by looking up articles on Anaxagoras in 5 different
encyclopedias.  Each was by a different author, but each noted, as the
most important resource in their bibliography Dr. Cleve's writings on the
subject.

His Yiddish was so refined and elegant that I would just sit and listen
to him speak on a variety of topics (including Brahms) for hours.

Biz 140!!

Subject: dialect variants

Arre Komar:

"gegangn" would be quite unusual; "gegangen" (with "bin" except among
Litvaks who say "hob") is more usual; note also "gegan" (NOT just an
abbreviation) and "geganen". Variation is regional but map has not yet
been plotted.

Central Yiddish "Ikh hob dikh/zi lib", Litvish Yiddish "ikh hob dir/ir
lib" (Standard requires the accusative forms "dikh/zi")

I have never heard or read a mention of "oon" in Yiddish. Can you trace
the source of your informationm?

tshatshke vs. tsatske

The distinction you offer is a nice one. I know it from my own experience
but I've simply not been conscious of it. There are other dialectally
variant pairs that are similarly exploited: e.g. "pupik/pipik" 'navel'
[or 'gizzard'] (derived from Eastern Slavic) as against"pempik" 'fat
belly'/'chubby fellow' (derived from Polish). Where are your parents
from?

The most "yidishlekh" relative pronoun is "vos" regardless of gender or
number: er iz der vos ...; zi iz di vos . . .; zey zaynen di vos . . . .

Definitely "faran(en)" not "es git".  Logic shmogic!

The system that uses "x" vs "kh", "c" vs "ts", etc, like the
International Phonetic Alphabet, also requires the extensive use of
diacritics and often of unusual symbols that are ordinarily available
only to specialists. We can't even transmit them on E- mail. I always use
it in rendering dialect variants in the Atlas, but not in transcribing
Standard Yiddish.
