Subject: Learn about the Yiddish Theater on-line
 
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Patriotn un Patriotkes,

We are delighted to announce the release of 2nd Avenue On-line: The Yiddish
Theater Digital Archive Project at New York University.  By visiting our
website at www.yap.cat.nyu.edu - you can read histories of the Yiddish
theater, hear oral histories, read scripts in Yiddish and English, see
photographs and listen to music.

Before the explosion of downtown basement theaters hit the lower east side,
the Yiddish theaters ruled the neighborhood, with theaters of 3000 seats and
more.  The movie theater on Second Avenue and 12th Street is the former home
of Maurice Schwartz's Yiddish Art Theater - the longest running repertory
theater in New York City's history.  Actors Joseph Buloff, Stella Adler,
Paul Muni, Rudolph Schildraut, Jacob Ben-Ami, lighting designers Abe Feder
(the Empire State Building), set designers Sam Leve (Citizen Kane) and Boris
Aronson are just a few of the greats who learned their trade on the Yiddish
stage before transforming English language theater with their talent.  The
history of the Yiddish theater - begun in the late 1800s, by Boris
Thomashefsky (the grandfather of Michael Tilson Thomas) whose first venue
was Turn Hall (the present home of La MaMa)- is a particularly glorious
chapter in the history of American Theater.

It's impact on our culture (hello Jerry Lewis, Danny Kay, Jerry Seinfeld,
Lenny Bruce, The Three Stooges, ah the modern Broadway musical) has yet to
be properly recognized and its influence continues up to the present day.  
(Leonard Nimoy acted in Yiddish with Maurice Schwartz, Yiddish actor manager
Herman Yablokoff was the first to mike actors on stage)

Please send us your comments and suggestions when you have a chance to look
through the site.

Visit www.yap.cat.nyu.edu and remember we update our site daily so tell us
what you want to see.

A Shaynem Dank.

Sincerely yours,

Caraid O'Brien

Subject: An-Sky's Expedition

I envy Mr. Shulman, not only because he found a book called "Yiddishe
Etnografiye un falklor" but also because, by only glancing through it, he
was able to read enough to tell what it was about (09.060).

Not being able to read Yiddish (unless its transliterated as it is this mail
group), I probably wouldn't have borrowed this book from the library at
Indiana University even if I had found a copy there.

But a few months ago I did borrow a copy of a large, illustrated paperback
book entitled "Tracing Ansky"  from I.U.'s library and found it so
fascinating that I tried, so far unsuccessfully, to find a copy to buy.  No
online used bookstore had a copy and I was told it was out of print.  
Someone from another Jewish mail group wrote me privately to tell me that he
had a copy which he purchased from the Amsterdam Jewish Museum, which had
held an exhibition about the An-sky collection. The book was I was unable to
find for purchase was:

"Tracing  An-Sky; Jewish Collections from the State Ethnographic Museum in 
St.Petersburg."   The title page says "Waanders Uigevers, Swolle, Joods 
Historisch Museum, Amsterdam, State Ethnographic Museum, St. Petersburg.

The catalogue was "made possible by a generous contributioin from the 
Schussheim Foundation , Haifa, Israel."   

The ISBN is 0-6630-454-9  (There is also another library number printed in 
the back of the book: NUGH 641-639. The copyright is 1992, but again 
reverting to the obverse of the title page, there  are the dates 1992-1994.)  

It suddenly occurred to me one day to write to the gift shop of Jewish
Museum in New York about the book.  At first I was told they did have it and
would send it, but soon I got another email saying they had been mistaken
and didn't have that book, but I was offered another, well-illustrated book
on An-sky's collection, (greatly reduced in price) which I eventually
received:

Vasilii Rakitin and Andrei Sarabianov, Eds., "Semyon An-sky 'The Jewish 
Artistic Heritage: An Album,' "RA" Moscow, 1994, ISBN 5-85164-024-3  (With an 
introduction entitled "Aladdin's Lamp" by Abram Efros and text by Alexander 
Kantsedikas.)

Mr. Shulman asked: "Does anyone know what happened to this wealth of
material?  Does it still exist?  Is access to it possible?  Can any of it be
recovered?"

Although some of of An-sky's collection may have been lost, and parts
scattered, much of it is in the State Ethnographic Museum in Peterburg. A
collection of "lubki" (folk paintings) on the "Legend of Joseph" is or was
in the Berlin Museum which published a brochure about them in1937.  The
Jewish Museum in London has a copy of an An-sky-collected ketubah.  Some of
his xletters and other memorabilia are at YIVO and some can be found in the
archives of Moscow, Kiev, and Petersburg.  Some of the pinkassim or their
fragments in An-sky's collection are in the collections of Peterburg and the
Institute of Manuscripts in the Central Science Library of the Ukrainian
Academy of Sciences.

>From the book I had to return to I.U.'s library, I vaguely and perhaps
mistakenly recall that some of the collection had been sent to Odessa (the
Moykher Seforim Museum) or removed from Odessa to Germany.  The notes to the
illustrations in the Rakitin-Sarabianov book trace much of the history of
the collection, but I think the book I had to return gave a better idea of
its fate.

Subject: An-ski collection

Yaacov Dovid Shulman asks, regarding materials collected on the Sh. An-ski's
ethnographic expedition:

  Does anyone know what happened to this wealth of material?  Does it still
  exist?  Is access to it possible?  Can any of it be recovered?

The answer, as far can be ascertained, is that much of this material _does_
still exist, and access to it is theoretically possible (though I am not in
a position to gauge the practicalities of access).  Some of the An-ski
expedition material is in St. Petersburg, at the State Ethnographic Museum,
and was exhibited during the first half of the 1990s in Amsterdam, Cologne,
Frankfurt, Jerusalem and New York.  See the following publications:

(1) Semyon An-sky:  The Jewish Artistic Heritage; an album.  Moscow:  RA,
1994.  (In English.)
(2) Tracing An-sky : Jewish collections from the State Ethnographic Museum
in St Petersburg.  Editors: Mariella Beukers & Rene Waale.  Zwolle :
Waanders Uitgevers ; Amsterdam : Joods Historisch Museum ; St Petersburg :
State Ethnographic Museum, 1992.  (In English.)

Additional material -- documentary collections (e.g., pinkasim, other
manuscripts) above all -- are at the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine,
in Kiev.  The most astounding discovery there is the collection of over
1,000 wax cylinder field recordings made by An-ski before World War I and
by the ethnomusicologist Moyshe Beregovski during the Soviet period.  (The
Beregovski recordings were obviously not done under the aegis of the An-ski
expedition but are similar in content.)  The Vernadsky Library has been
gradually transferring these recordings to CD, but I am not aware of the
current status of this project.

Subject: An-ski's expedition

In answer to Yaacov Dovid Shulman's question about An-ski's expedition :

the history of the material after An-ski gathered it is a long one. Most of
the material is at the State Ethnographic Museum of St Petersbourg. An
exhibition was organized in 1992-1994, and it went though a few countries :
Joods Historisch Museum in Amsterdam, Juedisches Museum in Frankfurt, Israel
Museum in Jerusalem (I saw it there) and Jewish Museum in New York. You will
find more details in the catalog of the exhibition : "Tracing An-Ski:
Jewish Collections from the State Ethnographic Museum in St Petersbourg",
1992-1994, Zwolle/Amsterdam/St Petersbourg, or in Kantsedikas, Alexander,
"Semyon An-sky: The Jewish Artistic Heritage, an album", RA, Moscow, 1994.

Subject: An-sky's 1913 Ethnographic Expedition

Y.D. Shulman asks in Mendele 9.60 about the fate of Shlomo An-Sky's study of
Jewish life in the Jewish Pale in 1913.  The material is in the collections
of the State Ethnographic Museum in St. Petersburg.  An exhibition entitled
"Jewish Life in Tsarist Russia: A World Rediscovered," was mounted October
9, 1994 to March 5, 1995 at the Jewish Museum in New York with over 300
hundred objects and 46 photos.  I saw this marvelous exhibition and believe
I mentioned it in a post to Mendele in December 1994. Prof. Dan Miron gave a
lecture on "The Literary Image of the East European Shtetl" in connection
with the exhibition examining the portrayal of shtetl life by Sholom
Aleichem, I.L. Peretz and Mendele and others as related to the themes of the
exhibition.  The Museum sold a printed a catalog of the exhibition and the
Russian book on An-sky's work mentioned by Shulman.
 
Inquiries about accessibility should be directed to the St. Petersburg
Museum I would assume.

Subject: An-sky's expedition and Bratslav bibliography

In reply to Yaakov D. Shulman's query on An-sky's expedition (Vol. 09.060),
one can read more about it in the book "Tracing An-sky: Jewish Collections
from the State Ethnographic Museum in St. Petersburg", Amsterdam 1992 (also
published in Hebrew: Be-chazarah la-Ayarah [=Back to the Shtetl], Jerusalem
1994). I don't think that any of the remnants of Bratslav that Rechtman
mentioned had survived. 

This is a good opportunity to inform Mendele readers about the publication
of my recent book "Bratslav: An Annotated Bibliography", published by Merkaz
Shazar for the History of Jewish People: Jerusalem 2000, 320 pp.  This
friendly multilingual bibliography comprises 1,100 entries on all aspects of
Bratslav Hasidism and its context - both the Bratslav writing and the
writing on Bratslav. The book includes as well dozens of citations taken
from the Yiddish literature and Yiddish Press.
For more details see the web site: www.shazar.org.il or contact the
publisher: shazar@netmedia.net.il

[Moderator's note: in addition to the above mentioned Russian, English, and
Hebrew editions of the catalog, there is a German version:

Leben im russischen Schtetl : Juedische Sammlungen des Staatlichen
Ethnographischen Museums in Sankt Petersburg : auf den Spuren von An-Ski. 
Koeln, Frankfurt am Main : Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum ; Juedisches Museum,
1993. ISBN 398021253X  

A review of the exhibition can be found in Meir Ronnen, The man between two
worlds.  Jerusalem Post, March 4, 1994. P.10.                   - i.v.]

Subject: Azay neyt a shnayder

I recall this Yiddish ditty my father sang. He likely learned it on the job
in a Paris hat factory or later at the Barclay Hat Company NYC (c1920).

  Azay neyt a shnayder,
  Azay neyt er dokh,
  Er neyt un neyt a gantsen nakht,
  Un krigt a fertsiker mit a lokh.

Is anyone familiar with the ditty?
What exactly is a "fertziker"?

Thanks!

Subject: a colleague in need of some Yiddish idioms

Dear Mendelyaner,

A colleague of mine, an artist, posed the following questions - I can
answer some of them, but not all, and thought that my colleague would get
classier ideas if I posted her queries to the list as a whole.  Her name
is Naomi Ribner, and you could either post answers on Mendele (in which
case I'll forward them to her), or send them to me at
lrosenwald@wellesley.edu, or directly to her at nribner@wellesley.edu.
        
Thanks!  
Larry Rosenwald

Query follows:

I'm looking for yiddish expressions that refer to each of the ideas listed
below (any loosely relevant expressions would be fine; the more
superstitious the better, but anything remotely related will be most
appreciated).  The Yiddish expressions will be worked into the surface of
an artwork for an exhibit at the Jewish Community Center called "The Power
to Enchant: Amulets, Talismans and Superstition".  This particular piece
has to do with the custom of placing certain items into a new home before
anything else is moved in.

Please let me know if you can you think of any expressions related to the
following: 

whatever one might wish someone upon moving to a new home

warding off bad luck or the evil eye (other things besides ken eyn hora)
or perhaps the opposite...wishing someone good luck (besides your basic
mazal tov)

that there should be enough to eat (or that you shouldn't go hungry)  

that you should find happiness or joy (or that you shouldn't be faced with
misery)

that you should be properous (or that you shouldn't be penniless)

anything related to wishing someone sweetness in their life

Thanks so much in advance,

Naomi Ribner

From: Robert Goldenberg <goldenbe@vaxxine.com>
Subject: ashlekh, patelnye

 From time to time, in Der forverts, I come across a word that I cannot find
either in Weinreich or Harkavy. For example, On Feb 4, there is a recipe for
low-fat meat loaf (a klops), and one of the ingredients called-for is "1/4
tepl tsehakte ashlekh." I would guess that ashlekh is some kind of green
vegetable, because it is sauted, with the other vegetables listed (onion,
carrot, celery, etc.) in "a patelnye." "Patelnye" is not listed in Weinreich
but Harkavy directs you to "skavrode," which in both Weinreich and Harkavy
is "frying-pan." (One would have predicted this anyway from the context.)

 I wondered about the origin of "patelnye." I would guess at Russian or
Ukrainian, partly because the editor of that section of Der forverts, Nayes
far bney-bayis" is Sore-Rukhl Schaechter. Ir tate, oyb ikh makh nisht keyn
toes, iz D"r Mortkhe Schaechter, un er shtamt fun Tshernovits, vos ikh meyn
itst gehert tsu Ukraine. This exercise shows that it is useful to have both
Weinreich and Harkavy, the latter unfortunately out-of-print at present.

It is also a reminder of how interesting Der forverts has become since Boris
Sandler became Editor. It retains the best of what it featured before, plus
a wealth of interesting new features, many directed at newcomers to Yiddish.
The quality of the content merits a larger readership. Anyone who can read
Yiddish owes it to themselves to become regular readers/subscribers. Even if
you are a snail-slow reader, you will see your reading speed and
comprehension improve incrementally. Start with the headings and
sub-headings of the contents, gradually try to read an article or two in
each issue. You will amaze yourself.
