Actually, it's a serious question.  Because of the possible
presence of bugs, many people won't eat lettuce unless they
know it's been checked carefully.  Standard practice among
many kashrus-keepers is to remove each leaf and soak it in
salt water, then examine it carefully under the light.
(This is more of a problem for romaine and Boston lettuce
than iceberg lettuce.)

Subject: Germanic and Semitic

With the discussion of "heiraten" and "lasche" on my mind,
I happend to come across an article titled "On the
possiblilty of lexical borrowings from Semitic into
Proto-Germanic or dialectal Proto-Germanic" by Gerald L.
Cohen In  1975 Mid- America Linguistics Conference papers.
Lawrence, Kansas: Linguistics Dept., KU, 1976.   This is
sort of a related thesis,if rather more likely.  Cohen
deals wi th the possible Semitic origin of proto-Germanic
words including *par (Hebrew par=bull), *kas (Hebrew kæos),
*kwelb (Arabic kulyab=small dog) and others.

Subject: Calves' foot jelly

My grandmother from Byelorussia called calves' foot jelly
/petshA/, definitely two syllables with stress on the
second.  But my grandfather, from just a short distance
away in southern Lithuania (Vilkovishk, near Kovno), whose
dialect was very similar to hers, called it /fisnogi/.
Clearly, /fis/ is 'feet', /nogi/ is 'feet' in Russian, but
why the duplication?  I wondered about this for years,
until someone mentioned a phenomenon that is said to occur
further north in Lithuania and in Latvia, in the land of
"Sabesdiker losn", where the /sh/ sound had become /s/,
merging with original /s/.  There, /fis/ is both 'feet' and
'fish'.  According to my unfortunately second- or
third-hand informant, one could avoid misunderstanding by
saying, for 'feet', /fisnogi/!  (My informant didn't know
whether anything like /fisribi/ was possible for 'fish'.)
My grandfather's dialect was south, he had no merger of
/sh/ and /s/, but apparently the term /fisnogi/ had spread
south of its home territory in the sense not of 'feet' but
of 'petsha'.
 
Incidentally, lack of uniformity in vowels is not limited
to Galitsyaners. Among us Litvaks, though the dialect was
closer to Standard phonology, there was similar
irregularity to that mentioned by some of our Peylishe
colleagues. For instance, my other grandmother, from the
corner of northeastern Poland where the dialect was
essentially Northeast Yiddish ("Litvak"), had [oy] or [ey]
in most words with vov-yud /oy/ in Standard, but [ow] in a
few.  E.g. /boykh/ 'belly', /eykhet/ 'also', but /yowkh/
'soup'.  Gey veys.  But where there was REAL vacilation was
in the gender and case system.  One thing my Brooklyn-born
mother became convinced of in the Sholem Aleykhem Shule was
that she doesn't know Yiddish, because she can't handle the
standard gender/case system.  No linguistic relativity for
her.
