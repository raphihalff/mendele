Subject: Matke Botke

In my youth when something appeared old - a dress, chipped dish, dogeared
book  - my mother would say, "Dos zet ois vie es iz fun der Matke Botke's
tzeitn." Anyone have a clue who she/he was? Last summer in a collector's
book store, I spied a book called "Matke Botke" but it was written in
Czech and nobody there was so versed. Also, a friend tells me her mother,
in the same context, used the phrase, "Eretze Betskes tzeitn."

Subject: kholile

I am new to the list (my first outgoing message) and so I wish to say how
happy I am to have found so many kindered hearts. Most of you know "tons"
more of Yiddish than I and I am most appreciative for the opportunity to
learn from you. In my introduction I said that I woud contribute "vus ich
kenn" and take " vus ich darf". I have taken much for which I thank you
all. I am wondering if anyone noticed or mentioned in the past, that
beautiful piece of Yiddishkayt on the last page of every message, we all
get. On line d. it says "To unsubscribe kholile: unsub mendele" The
"kholile" makes my day every time I see it. Whoever thought of it, thanks
a million! If I may, I will enter into your discussions at a later date.

Subject: Split the list

On Louis Fridhandler's plea for more of us to participate:

Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I am _not_ fluent in Yiddish.  I
happen to have a barrier to learning languages (I'm hard of hearing and
it's hard to lip read and understand at the same time), so while I had 7
years of formal Arbeter Ring shule, ending some 40+ years ago, I cannot
speak Yiddish or understand more than a few hundred words.

Accordingly, I am frankly not interested in the great detailed
discussions of language structure, and even less in the questions of how
to transliterate. I sometimes think this list should be split, into one
dealing exclusively with language and another dealing with Yiddish
culture.  I'm much more into the latter.  The postings have become so
voluminous that, many days, I have to just look at Noyekh's helpful
listing of subjects and then hit the delete button.  I do read the
introductions because I'm interested in how different people have come to
Yiddish interest and to Mendele.  It is too expensive to read everything,
especially when so much of it is of little interest.

I'd be interested in others' opinion of this issue.  Meanwhile, I join in
wishing everyone a Happy Secular New Year (yes, that much Yiddish I do
know!).

Subject: Giddyup

Eli Katz writes, "Brr or prr were sounds used by Eastern European horse
drivers to make the horse go, the equivalent of 'giddyup' in the U.S."

I have to respectfully disagree.  When I was a little girl in Poland, my
father had a horse and he used to say "vyo!" to make the horse go and
"prr!" to make him stop.  You may also recall a Yiddish song in which a
balegole sings about how his passengers take turns complaining that he is
driving too slowly, or to fast, or that the ride is too bumpy, and the
refrain is:

Vyo, vyo ferdelekh...... firt di parshoyndelekh iber di veygelekh. Vyo! Az
geyn zol a roykh!
