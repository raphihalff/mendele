Subject: Cryptic language

In writing about Yiddish influences on Polish (_International Journal of
Slavic Linguistics and Poetics_ 25/26 [1982]), I had occasion to quote
the comments of two great Yiddish linguists on the subject of Yiddishisms
in European underworld slang.  Max Weinreich, in his 1940 article on
Yiddish in the _Algemeyne yidishe entsiklopedye_, pointed out that the
Yiddish influence on neighboring languages is almost exclusively on the
language of "the lower strata of the population or of specific groups
(e.g., student language)" and that "in creating their secret language
thieves have recourse to those linguistic elements that are unknown to
the majority of the population."

Ber Borokhov, on the other hand, writing in 1913, argued that "Jews have
always constituted a large percentage of thieves' and swindlers' gangs.
This explains the fact that a large number of words from Yiddish can be
found in the thieves' dialects of the nations of the world, in particular
in Germany.  These are mostly corrupted Hebrew and Aramaic words."

The police chief was not from Berlin but from Luebeck, I believe,
certainly from Northwest Germany. His name is F.C.B. Ave-Lallemant and
his book _Das deutsche Gaunerthum in seiner social-politischen,
literarischen und linguistischen Ausbildungen zu seinem heutigen
Bestande_ (4 vols. Leipzig, 1858-1862) was undertaken as a criminological
study, a description of German thieves' language, Rotwelsch. While he was
working on it, he became fascinated with the Yiddish language and decided
to write a special section on Yiddish and compile a dictionary of this
language. He states very clearly that Yiddish is not the same as
Rotwelsch and that many Hebraisms in Rotwelsch couldn't have come from
Yiddish.  Of course there are words and expressions that did come from
Yiddish, but Ave-Lallemant was one of the first to realize that the two
"languages" were distinct. It is because of this, that his work includes
_two_ "dictionaries": a Yiddish and a separate Rotwelsch dictionary. This
is not to say that there was no influence of Yiddish on Rotwelsch, only
that it is much less significant than suggested by a couple of
contributors to Mendele. If a nineteenth-century German police chief
finds it necessary to make a distinction between Yiddish and Rotwelsch,
why aren't Yiddish enthusiasts prepared to do so?

Subject: When Sholem-Aleykhem defied the censor

The recent talk of censorship on Mendele seems to be just idle talk. But
it reminded me of the times of Sholem-Aleykhem when the work and personal
safety of writers were truly threatened by tsarist censorship.  I was
especially reminded of a little known work by Sholem-Aleykhem, "Der Feter
Pinye Mit Der Mume Reyze," published by Bikher Far  Ale.  On the flyleaf
is printed, "Povoleno tsenzuroyu, Varshava, 11 Marta 1905" [Permitted by
censor, Warsaw. March 11, 1905].  It was a political satire on the
Russo-Japanese War in the form of an allegory.  Hulking, clumsy Mume
Reyze represented Russia, while lean and agile Feter Pinye represented
Japan.  It was published before the tsarist officials realized its
meaning.  Later, it dawned on them and the copies were confiscated.

Here is what Mume Reyze was like according to Sholem-Aleykhem:

A hoykhe, a gezunte, dos ponim fet, di hent megushem grob, di negl
shvarts, a kol fun a mansbil, a harts fun a toter, a karge, a foyle
shtik, nit aza shlekhte, vi an ongebroygezte af der gantser velt, zeyer a
proste zakh - ot dos iz geven di mume Reyze.

Nokh a mayle: gehalten fun der akhile un lib gehat, zol zi mir moykhl
zayn ... tsvishn undz vet dokh es mistome blaybn, ikh volt dos aykh
gezogt glaykh, past dos ober nisht far keyn froy ... bekitser, zi hot lib
gehat dos trunk, un dafke oft, un dafke a poshet bisl yash, un dafke fun
a tey-gloz.

Gezogt hot men, az dos iz a khalas.  Andere hobn gerekhnt, az dos iz ir
gekumen beyerushe fun ir elter-elter-bobe, geven, zol hobn a likhtikn
ganeydn, a gants erlekhe, nor a groyse trinkerin.

(My translation)

Strong and tall with chubby face.  Big, thick, clumsy hands with dirty
fingernails.  Mannish voice.  A Tartar's heart.  A stingy, lazy piece of
goods.  Not so cruel as angry at the world.  A common creature.  There
you have her: Aunty Raisa.

Another noble quality: she loved to stuff herself with food, and
worshipped (may she forgive me, and this will go no further than between
us, probab- ly)....  I'd come right out with it, but this....  This does
not befit a woman.  In short, she adored her drinks, and really often;
and always plain old booze; and only from a tea glass.

Some said it was a sickness.  Others figured it came down to her from her
great-great granny who (may her paradise be bright) was a virtuous woman,
but what a guzzler! * * *

This was not the first time that Sholem-Aleykhem had stuck his neck out
in defiance of censorship.
