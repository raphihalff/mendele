Subject: knibbers/heri zayn ondenk

Yude Rozof, ellen prince:  no "knibbers" in my neighborhood in Brooklyn
(East New York, 1930s-40s), either.

Zachary Baker:  "heri zayn ondenk" must surely be a corruption of the
datshmerish "ere zayn ondenk" = "honor his memory", ayo?

Subject: Heri zayn ondenk

In answer to Mendele Vol. 4.058, regarding ZACHARY BAKER'S subject above,
it might be... her iz z'ayn un d'gdenk, which would translate to, he is
the one on  my mind = he will remain in my thoughts.  Am I close on this?
And I enjoyed your comparison of my parents dialect, to this item.

Apropos of my parents dialect, my Father used to enjoy telling me Yiddish
jokes, and this was one of his favorites. (using his dialect, as I
remember it)   Ain afderfree, az Getzel, a "grubber ing" shtatyt in guss,
gibt ayer a "keek" und zayt a lantzman, der Doctur fin d'shtetl in
drayhm. Lust ayer ohys a gashrai,"oy Docktur, eichbin azoy tzfreeden deer
tzuzayn! Nu, v'zoy zunt eir, and vus teitzuch in shtetl? Und zug meir
nor, vus teitzuch mitt mein frant, Baruch?" Der Doctur, un adelah mahn,
ut nicht g'volt d'tzailin boldt, mita prusta vayhg, az Baruch ut
g'shtorbin, zuckt air, "Baruch?, Baruch iz nifter." "Nifter, zucht
Getzel, nifter, pifter, alaiben machter ?"

In answer to Zellig Bach, re: allemen, instead of allah. You are correct,
and I found your comment very amusing.  But it is difficult when one has
picked up the language only through listening to it as a child. I do
appreciate your comment, and hope my story above, does not have too many
boners in it.

Subject: Sliakhtshitz, Heri

To Andy Cassel:

Sliakhtshitz > Polish "Szlachcic" (generally pronounced "SHLAKH-tshits"),
a (Polish) nobleman, member of the "szlachta" (Polish aristocracy, landed
gentry), landowner.

Polish aristocratic landowners held property, often lots of it,
throughout much of Jewish Eastern Europe, especially Poland, Ukraine,
Belorussia and Lithuania (the former territory of Poland at its height in
the 16th-18th centuries). In some areas, these holdings were retained
until the end of the Second World War. As you might imagine, the New
World Order is allowing for some revival of this quaint institution in
contemporary Poland...

TO Zack Baker:

While honoring Novick's memory, as his eulogist suggests, I'll mention
that one of my folksong informants from Belorussia used to "hempty di
harbage" from her kitchen when it became full.

Subject: Shliakhtshitz

Andrew Cassel writes in Mendele 4.059:

"...Savitzki is gewen a shliakhtshitz, un hot getrogen a gantze gute
dertzihung als kind. ..."

"Shliakhtshitz" sounds to me like Czech "slechtic" (Shlechtyits) or the
similar word in Polish, which both mean "nobleman" or "member of the
aristocracy".

As Savitzki seems to have enjoyed a good education in his childhood, this
origin of the word seems to be most likely.
