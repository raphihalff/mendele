Subject: Riseven; "family words"

To Dave Sherman:

_riseven_ is 'draw'.  It doesn't (necessarily) denote the random,
haphazard or careless marks that are produced by patshken or mazhgen.

With regard to "oysgetrakhte verter":  your family's "salat-ontuekhts"
for 'salad dressing' comes from somewhere, viz. it's calqued from
English.  Now, only you, Surele and the kids use it so it's a family
word, but it has a source, and an identifiable one at that.  I was
talking about the oft-heard perception that a particular word or phrase
is purely, plain and simple oysgetrakht.  To use the _mazhge_ example, I
could imagine that whoever it was who asked Daniella HarPaz what "mazhgee
(around)" meant thought that some- body put together some funny sounds
(funny to the English-oriented ear, that is) and used it as a verb to
denote some sort of haphazard activity.  If the person wasn't
Yiddish-literate and heard it only within a limited context (home, one
specific individual at work, what have you), s/he might have con- cluded
that the word itself was just as random as its meaning.  And falsely
concluded this. (Veho-raye:  it's in the dictionary.  Granted, not all
words are in the dictionary, so the more likely for an obscure usage to
be thought to be oysgetrakht.)

Subject: (on)riseven; more on Yeke

1. (on)riseven

Dave Sherman: This is a relatively late acquisition in my own vocabulary,
synonymous with "(on)tseykhenen" 'to draw'. Come to think of it,
"riseven" is probably cognate with English "write".

Dave, I was sort of expecting you to comment on the recent assertion that
Toronto was, historically, an "unYiddish" city-- Toronto, "a shtu:it fin
poylishe yidn", the city where Zionist youth recited Bialik in Yiddish,
sang Yehuda Halevi in Yiddish. What say you?

2. Yeke

Bob Hoberman: I don't offer this biographical note as authoritative but,
for whatever it's worth, I should say that the word "yeke" was never part
of my "original" Yiddish vocabulary: nor have I ever encountered the word
in Yiddish literature, where "daytsh" is a more likely designation for
the German Jew (at least, one in modern dress).

In my own experience, the word is part of my pre- and poststate
"youth-movement"-derived vocabulary. It entered both my Yiddish and my
English along with words like "pOntsher", "makhanE", "aliyA", "kibbUtz",
"shalOm", "bitakhOn", etc. Perhaps it was imported into the Yishuv during
the German Aliya in the 20's, and exported from there.

By the way, a former colleague, a historian of Latvian Jewish origin,
born(?) in a DP camp, insisted that in her European experience, "Yeke"
was a designation for Germans, not Jews.

Perhaps Dorothy Bilik can tell us more. She has worked/is working? on the
image of the German (Jew/non-Jew?) in Yiddish literature. Does the word
crop up.

Subject: Risivn

Regarding David Sherman's use of "risivn" for scribble: In Polish,
rysowac is to sketch or draw.

Subject: Where can one find "Di Kishef-Makhern" a.k.a. "Koldunye"

Mr. Zalmen Srebro, chairman of the Yiddish Culture Club of Boston, is
trying to find out where/whether Avrom Goldfadn's Di Kishef-Makhern or
Koldunye is printed.  Does anyone have this information?

Subject: Reply to Zev Bar-Lev

I think it's a mistake to refer to a "YIVO grammar and lexicon".  There
are no such things and I truly believe that it's not helpful to introduce
such concepts into a discussion of Yiddish standards and standardization.
Not that Z. Bar-Lev has introduced it, as in 'coined the term'.  It is a
common belief that there is a YIVO-sanctioned Yiddish, or for that matter
a YIVO-invented Yiddish.  It's a misunderstanding, in my opinion.

The actual standardization tendencies in Yiddish haven't received serious
attention, as I see it; and an investigation of the standardization
tendencies has to be stated relative to the actual facts of the spoken
(and written) language, and this latter part is even more neglected than
the former.  (I.e., to know why a linguist or publication preferred the
form X, we also have to know what forms X was in competition with and
what forms X was a reaction to.)

A cover term such as "YIVO Yiddish" (in contemporary usage) usually means
no more than the standardization preferences given in U. Weinreich's
dictionary and beginners textbook (_Modern English-Yiddish Yiddish-
English Dictionary and _College Yiddish_, respectively). Since these two
books were published by the YIVO, "YIVO Yiddish" might be the Yiddish
that a student, let's say, has learned if s/he has used only these two
books.  Just like someone who learned their French in language courses at
the Sorbonne might be said to speak "Sorbonne French" -- just because
s/he learned it there, not because there actually is such thing as a
dialect/register of French spoken in or sanctioned by the Sorbonne.

It is probably linguists and Yiddish academics only who will understand
the surface I am trying to skim, and I apologize for the opacity.  I'm
waiting for my sabbatical :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  to be able to discuss this
more at length, and in a CLEAR fashion.

Iker-shokhakhti:

The transliteration (not to mention the native orthography) of _many_
languages is a source of debate (and, indeed, probably a turn-off to
those who are just interested in learning the basics and getting the bare
_facts_).

I don't think I understood the point of your posting.  Should those who
_are_ in command of the basic facts not discuss issues that they have a
stake in, so that those without a command won't be turned off?  Doesn't
everyone have a scroll-ahead command or a delete button?

Biz ikh hob gelernt andre verter in gas fin kinder, is "meki" gevehn di

fun Lodz. "Penis" not "scrotum". I don't recall any family word (English
or Yiddish) for "scrotum" or "testicles".
