Subject: Arre Komar's kluge verter

I find myself in reluctant agreement with Arre Komar in his
understanding of the shift to Hebraization of names in modern Jewish
History and in particular post Holocaust Zionism. There is certainly
an element of what was called "Shlilat HaGaluth" or negation of
everything that smacked of Eastern European Shtettledom and YIddish
was certainly one of those things. "Self Hatred" it may be called,
but here I differ somewhat. It was rejection of the former helpless,
ingratiating, dependent image of Jews in favor of (yes! "the warrior
image") a fighting pioneer who could create his/her own circumstances
far more than brethern who remained in Europe.

It reminds one of the bitter fight between Bund (Arbeiter Ring) and
Zionists. YIddish got a "rep" for being the ghetto tongue, whereas
Hebrew was of course the aristocratic language of the "proud heri-
tage".  Of course reflection makes one aware of how jingoistic it
all is, but then so is the bottom line of identity.

Subject: More on verb-first construction

I spoke with my father (a native Yiddish speaker) about the
verb-first construction; he said that aside from questions (Fort er
in arbet?) he could only remember its use in a literary context. He
couldn't recall hearing it in conditionals, but he hasn't actually
had a conversation in Yiddish in years, so I wonder......

I know of one place this side of Korea, where 'sh' is not pronounced
as in YIVO transcription.  In Czech, e.g. 'na shledanou' means
something like 'goodbye.'  The 'shl' combination in the beginning is
pronounced as an 's' sound followed by an 'h' sound followed by an
'l.'

WASHINGTON, DC, U.S.A., 1993 NOV 29 (NB) -- While the Bible and
related religious documents have long been available in electronic
format, the massive, 5,000-page Talmud containing Judaic law and
commentary, has not been widely available. Now, Chicago, Illinois-
based Davka, in cooperation with the Institute for Computers in
Jewish Life, has published English and Hebrew versions of the Talmud
on an Apple Mac-compatible CD-ROM.

Besides making the documents more widely available, the electronic
version of the Talmud, which includes Rashi's commentary in Hebrew,
as well as the respected Soncino English translation in addition to
the original Hebrew, is also fully indexed. The company claim that
this allows the programs to be searched electronically using a bi-
lingual search engine using just a word or two.

Both versions of the text can be displayed simultaneously and
scrolled together and there is also a topic index as well as the
full-text search capabilities.

The Macintosh CD-ROM is priced at $299.
