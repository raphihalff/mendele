Interview with Mordkhe Tsanin, Founder/Editor
Of Israel's Yiddish Newspaper "Letste Nayes"
On The Yiddish Voice, WUNR 1600 AM, Weds., Nov. 27, 1996

Boston's Yiddish-language radio program, The Yiddish Voice (WUNR-AM,
1600 in Brookline, MA), will feature an interview with Mordkhe Tsanin,
editor of "Letste Nayes", on its upcoming program, Wednesday, November
27, 1996.

Tsanin is the president of the Yiddish Writers and Journalists Union in
Israel, where he is active to this day as a journalist and novelist.  He
is the founder and editor of the newspaper "Letste Nayes", which was
Israel's first Yiddish daily newspaper (published weekly in recent
years).  For many years he was also the Israeli correspondent of the
Yiddish Daily Forward.  His most recent novel, "Shluf Nisht, Mameshi",
(the title is in Polish-Yiddish dialect) was published by H. Leyvik
House in 1986.  Material by and about Tsanin and his work recently
appeared in a "mini-anthology" in the September-October issue of the
journal "Yiddishe Kultur", published by the Yiddisher Kultur Farband.

This exclusive interview was conducted in Yiddish upon Mr. Tsanin's
recent visit to New York, where he was honored by the Zhitlovsky
foundation.  In addition to the interview, excepts of Mr. Tsanin's
remarks at the annual Zhitlovsky Foundation banquet will also be
broadcast.  The interview is by Yiddish Voice host and producer Mark
David.

The Yiddish Voice is a weekly Yiddish-language radio program heard in
Boston since 1994 that features music, poetry, comedy, interviews, news,
commentary, and announcements of current events.

Subject: Toytn bankes, illustrated

Kindveis hob ikh g'hert menshn zogn "es vet helfn vi a toyten helft
bankes", clearly meaning that a dead one won't be helped. Of course you
have heard the story about the performance taking place in a theater at
which an actor suddenly drops to the floor. A doctor rushes up and
declares the man dead. A voice from the balcony shouts "Give him an
enema". The doctor replies, "He's dead, it can't help".  Comes back the
voice, "It can't hoit!".

Subject: Literal meaning of "helfn vi a teytn bankes"

Walter Golman asks if [6.102] _helft vi a toytn bankes_ could mean
'helped as dead cups' -- no, and we can tell that because of grammatical
agreement. The adjective _toyt-_ 'dead' occurs in this phrase as an
accusative or dative masculine singular, while _bankes_ 'cups' is
plural. So we know that 'dead' can't be modifying 'cups' -- 'dead cups'
would be _toyte bankes_. Isn't grammar useful? :-)

Subject: Yiddish for kids (or should it be for zise kinderlekh?)

In response to David Berman's shale [6.101] on how children should
threaten to snoop on one another I can only say that the khsidishe kids
lingo is 'ikh gay oszogen', to which the response is 'moser katz'. I am
not sure if it is phrased 'ikh gay oszogen of dir', but it is definitley
used on its own or 'ikh gay oszugen der rebe/taty/dan mame etc.

There is another age of children when almost every other sentence of
theirs begins with 'true' as in 'True that you're going to buy me a
present?' and 'True that I came to your house?' and so on.

Yiddish speaking kids outside Israel say 'Emes' like 'Emes ikh hob dikh
gezeyn?' etc. In Israel the children say 'ayo, the 'yo' pronounced like
'yo', yes in yidish. This word is relatively unused with adults and this
lead me to believe that it is an Israeli dialecticl addition. That was
until I came across the word in the works of either Sholem Alaykhem or
Mendele and left me wondering why only Israelies use it.

There is another question I have: How do you teach children in yiddish
to say please? The Belgians and some others use 'bite' which is a German
word and the adaptation by the Belgians may be connected to their
proximity to Germany. I dislike the word first because it somehow
doesn't sound yidish and also because it has a very wieghty formal
sounding.

Another word that appears in the dictionary is 'za moykhel'. While this
contains the full taste of yidish I find it too fartsatish and heavy a
word to bring kids up in.

My father used to say to us 'za azoy git' which is better than 'za
moykhel' but is not always applicable and is also long winded. For eg.
if a child says in English 'Can I please have a drink', he would have to
say, 'za azoy git in geb mikh a trink' or 'kenst di azoy git zan in mikh
geyben a trink' which is a rather long way of getting a drink.

The simple option is to drop the please and that is indeed how many
khsidishe kids talk. I assume that they didn't talk much differently in
the shteytl so at lease history is on their side.

My prefered choice is to use 'please'. It is short and easy to use and
the khirik sound in it gives it a yidish flavour.

I wonder what others think.
