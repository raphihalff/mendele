Subject: Narr

The German word has been around for a while. Heine ends
his marvelous poem "Fragen" with the line (as I recall
it):

Und ein Narr wartet auf Antwort

Subject: NAAR

On the "naar" "nar" relationship:  I had a teacher who
was fond of translating the last part of the birkat
hamazon as "I was a "nar"--I was a fool--and then I
grew older."  And he would comment that it was only
"narishkeit", only the foolishness of an old fool, that
could claim that a Zaddik is never abandoned or his
children sent out to seek bread!

Subject: Nar 'fool'

Yiddish nar 'fool' is spelled phonetically,
nun-alef-reysh, not like the Hebrew word for 'youth',
nun-ayin-reysh.  I betcha in the Yiddish dialects that
distinguish long and short vowels 'fool' has a short
/a/ and the Hebrew word, if used at all, has a long a
/naar/, maybe even two syllables--but this is a guess.
So I think it's a safe guess Yiddish nar 'fool' and
modern German Narr both come from a common earlier
Germanic source.  I hope the Germanicists among us will
give us the details.

I wonder, though, about the pseudo-Hebrew plural of the
Yiddish word: naronim. The plural of German Narr is
Narren; Hebrew naar has the plural neorim, as in the
aliye on Simkhas Toyre known as kol-haneorim 'all the
boys' (so pronounced by my grandfather).  Maybe all
along Yiddish speakers have felt nar to be sort-of
Hebrew, and gave it a plural, complete with -im, stress
shift, and the additional derivational suffix -on- that
in Hebrew often makes agent nouns) for good measure.

(By the way, isn't that what a tradional shul is all
about anyway--kol haneorim?  [Sorry.])
