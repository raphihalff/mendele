Subject: Fun meylekh (s)abestkes tsaytn, fun khmeltnitskis tsaytn

The forms people heard are _fun meylekh (s)abe'tskes tsaytn_ and _fun
khmelnitskis tsaytn_ for something old.  The former refers to the Polish
king Jan Sobieski; the latter to Bohdan Chmelnitski of the Chmeltnitski
Massacres.

Subject: raysn

To Michael Steinlauf:

The long-awaited acknowledgment  ;-)

Thanks for correcting me as to the composition of the Vaad Arbe
Arotses/'Council of Four Lands'.  Memory served me incorrectly when I
cited M. Schaechter as having said "somewhere" that the words _lite
veraysn_ 'Lithuania and White Russia' were in the title of the Council.
As I had recalled (incorrectly, alas), he had brought this as testimony
to the fact that Jewish natives of Lite and of Raysn have distinct
regional identities, while non-litvishe and non-vaysrusishe lump these
people together and call them all _litvakes_.

After a visit to my permanent home where the bulk of my library is, I got
to the bottom of my (mis)recollection.  The actual source with the actual
text follow:

M. Schaechter, _Laytish mame-loshn_, pp. 46-7, fn. 1: "zol es zayn
fartseykhnt in a heore:  ba yidn fun poyln un ukraine iz raysn poshet a
teyl fun lite.  di raysishe yidn gufe hobn ober a klor visikayt fun zeyer
identishkeyt [sic!, leyen: identitet -- DB], vi me ken zen funem banits
ba tsunzern ("raysn tsi lite") un andere litvishe-raysishe shraybers, vi
oykh funem altn nomen fun bund:  "yidisher arbeter-bund fun lite, poyln
un raysn".  der arumnemiker banits fun _lite_ vi an eyberbagrif far der
kovner lite, letland, estland, raysn iz azoyernokh beiker a
dorem-yidisher termin. "ikh bin nit ken litvishe, nor a vaysrusishe", hot
mir farzikhert di almone funem poet A. Berger, "ersht in amerike hot men
mir gezogt, az ikh bin fun der lite".  [...]

[The whole issue was brought up a few months ago in my response to Dvosye
Bilik -- who was responding to a yet earlier posting of mine.  My
grandmother, of the Grodne area, used almost the same exact words as the
above-cited Mrs. Berger.]

To end on a purimdik note:  surely you'll agree, Michael, that it's
historically accurate to say that the Bund and the Council of Four Lands
were one and the same thing.  ;-)  ;-)  ;-)  I'll argue this in a future
posting, bli-neyder.

Subject: A heymishe khasene, cont.

Last month I asked for help with several words from a 1940 memoir I'm
trying to translate vegn "a heymishe khasene." Many thanks to those who
responded. Here's another passage, with some intriguing but baffling
expressions <marked like this>. Can anyone help?:

oyf morgn, shabes, is abisele shtiler vi nekhtn, akhutz fun firen di
yunge vaybl in shul, eyn aliya dem yungen man, aynladn balebatim oyf
koved, makhn a l'khaim tzubaysn kikhlekh mit gehakte hering <mit ayer
bashotn>, vinshn mazltov un arikhes-yomim far khosn v'kale, geyt der tog
avek shtil. m zikh op a guten tsholnt un men leygt zikh tzu shlofn,

* four words I in (I presume) Hebrew, spelled: kof-lamed,
daled-kof-fey-vov-nun, yud-vov-tof-alef, vov-yud-alef-kof-lamed.

Nokh amol, a dank

Subject: Gedabrrt

Perl Teitelbaum is surely correct that "prr" means "whoa" rather than
"giddyup".  I apologize for having mixed them up.  But that doesn't
change my view that "gedabrrt" is meant to characterize the balegole's
style of davnen.

Subject: Matke Botke

In Mendele 4.256, Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan asks about the expression
"Motke Botke's tzeitn" and who Motke Botke was.

"Matke Boske," (not sure of the precise spelling), is Polish for "mother
of God," i.e., Mary.  I'd guess that Czech and other related Slavic
languages have close variants of that.  Like something from "Khmelnitzkis
yorn, or Melekh Sobyeskis tzeitn, I believe it just means something
"pretty old."
