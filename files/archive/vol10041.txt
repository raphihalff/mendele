Subject: Fela Mendelsohn

A patron is looking for information on a family member who may have
written poetry in the Forverts in the 1930s and 40s. Her name was Fela
Mendelsohn. That is as much information as we have. She is not listed in
the Leksikon, Yidishe Dikhterins, or various articles on Yiddish women
poets that we have turned up. We have begun the tedious process of
checking microfilm reels, but would appreciate hearing from anyone who has
heard of this poet before.

Subject: Yiddish Parsifal

Many years ago in an interview, Boris Thomashefsky's grandson, the
conductor Michael Tilson Thomas, mentioned that his grandfather produced a
Yiddish version of Wagner's "Parsifal." A researcher would like us to
verify that such a production took place, and the venue and dates. I have
not found any mention of it in the usual sources (Lifson, Sandrow,
_Leksikon fun der nayer Yidisher literatur_, and other books about the
Second Avenue theater) or among our large collection of Yiddish
playscripts, either published or unpublished. I have not read
Thomashefsky's autobiography--400 pages, unindexed--but if someone has and
could direct me to a page I would appreciate it. A definitive "no" would
also be acceptable.

Itzik Manger's poem: "Epitaph", see my web page:

Thank you all very much in advance, shalom,

Subject: 'Ishkabibble' -- alleged Yiddish roots?

This much seems clear: Merwyn Bogue (?-1994), a cornettist sideman in
'Kay' (James Kern) Kyser's (1905-1985) "Kollege of Musical Knowledge", a
popular "big band" of the 1930's and 1940's, was featured with them in a
'novelty number' entitled 'Ishkabibble', which brought him such renown
that this term, and its contraction, 'Ish', became his nickname, as well
as the title of his 1989 autobiography
(http://lsumvs.sncc.lsu.edu/lsupress/catalog/Author_Listing/authors_b.htm,
published by the Louisiana State University Press; I have not acquired or
read it).  Bogue was also known for his onstage role as an
-agent-provocateur-, apparently regularly harrassing leader Kyser with
comic antics.  (See http://www.kaykyser.net for background).

The Bogue/Kyser references available to me gloss "Ishkabibble" (or "Ish
Kabibble" or "Ish Gabibble", etc.), as a "Yiddish term meaning, loosely,
'I should worry?'", some citing a "Yiddish song" of that name, but I
cannot it parse as Yiddish, let alone as the Neuman epigram.  Nor have I
ever encountered this phrase or alleged earlier song in any independent
context.

Especially given the talismanic use to which the term has since shifted,
Hebrew roots are seductive (cf., "shibboleth"), in particular, a
hypothetical regional/dialectical ablaut -qua- pointing variant of "*Ish
ka bovel", "(a) man who is like unto Babylon" (i.e., a dissolute paragon
of decadence and debauch, which is within semantic earshot of Bogue's
aforementioned chaoturge persona), but this hypothetical phrase lacks any
attestation.

I would appreciate any insight or knowledge anyone might be willing to
share on the putative Yiddish roots of 'Ishkabibble', or any citation
and/or gloss predating Bogue.

Thanks,

Subject: Searching for words to a poem

It would be wonderful if someone could provide me with the
words to the poem  "Di Dame Mitn Hintl" originally written in Russian by
Samuil Marshak and later translated into Yiddish by Kadye Maladovsky.  I
don't need it transliterated, the original Yiddish would be best, but I'll
be glad to get the poem in any shape, manner or form

Subject: ha-Yoetz (Bucharest) and Yiddish translation of a French novelle

Dear Mendelikes,

I am trying to find bibliographic information on a Yiddish translation of
Ponson du Terrail's (1829-1871) book "Les drames de Paris".
The Yiddish translation was published in parts in Bucharest under the
title: <"Di drame fon Pariz" : ayn velts roman zehr shehn illustrirt.>
It was published by Tipographia Hajoetz, Bucurest, Calea Vacaresti, Nr. 57.
On the title page, as well in the book it self, there is no hint for a date
when it was published as well no name of a translator or editor.
I looked up Natan Mark's books "Yidish-literatur in Rumenye" (1971) and
"Sifrut Yidish be-Romanyah" (1973) as well as Yitshak Korn's book
"Yidish in Rumenye" (1989) and only found that "Ha-Yoets" le-vet Yisrael
be-Romanyah began in 1874 and was published for almost 40 years.
Ha-Yoets was edited by Yehiel-Mikhl Uziel. Another periodical that was
published in Bucharest in 1885 (according to Korn) or 1895 (according
to Mark) Der vahre ha-yoets, that was edited by Yosef Azilescu (spelling?),
the son of Yehiel-Mikhl.

Could some help me and find who translated Ponson du Terrail's book into 
Yiddish, and when was the Yiddish translation published.

Thank you very much,

Subject: Rafoyel Un Sheyndele

Hello -- does anyone know the real title of the play Rafoyel Un Sheyndele?
It might be Rafuel, it might be Rafael, it might be R AND S instead of R
UN S.  Thanks in advance.

Subject: Question regarding Yidisher Kinder Zhurnal

Dear Colleagues,

I have a patron who is searching for a Yiddish children's periodical
entitled Yidisher Kinder Zhurnal.  Yidisher Kinder Zhurnal, apparently
started in 1914, was edited by Joel Entin.  In the entry on Joel Entin in
the Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur, Yidisher Kinder Zhurnal is
cited as the oldest Yiddish children's journal in the U.S.

Please note that Yidisher Kinder Zhurnal is not the same as the Kinder
Zhurnal which began in 1920.

We have already looked for this journal in the YIVO library, the Dorot
Jewish Division of the New York Public Library, and the Klau Library,
Hebrew Union College/Cinn.  If anyone has any leads on this periodical,
please let me know.

Many thanks,
Aaron Taub

Subject: Trying to find Yiddish poem

Hello,
    
I once had but sadly misplaced a Yiddish poem with a title something like
"Nomen fun Yiddishe Kinder" ("Names of Jewish Children"). I would be very
grateful if you can be of any help in finding it.

Thank you.
