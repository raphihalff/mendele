Subject: Yiddish orthography in Communist Russia

Marc Chagall returned to Russia to live the dream of a new world
promised by the victory of the Bolsheviki. His stay was a rich period
of productivity for him but the dream was not realizable and the years
he spent in Russia, his homeland, in the 20's, were a passing phase in
his life.

One powerful painting of that period is a graveyard in Vitebsk.  I was
always impressed that he spelled "eretz" in the logo on the graveyard
gate with an eyin [instead of an alef] and thought it an example of
am-ha-ortzus [ignorance].  But in light of the discussion of the
changes in orthography, I realize that I might have been hasty; the
eyin may be an example of "reformed," purist Russian Yiddish
orthography.  Can some one help with that? And when were the changes
in final constanants made, in Stalin's time or before that?

I have a sense of deja vu or deja apercu when I read the justifications
for Yiddish spelling to be ivris rayn [cleansed of its Hebrew roots].
Have we learned nothing?  What did Santayana say about learning from
history?  I should have said ivris fray, no, to be a purist, shouldn't
I have?

When will we ever learn?  Yidn!!!

Subject: Soviet Yiddish orthography as "Power to the People!"

Those who focus on the "affront to tradition," "de-Hebraization,"
"dissociation of Yiddish from religious culture," "anti-Hebraist
stance" and/or "anti-Zionist stance," etc. so commonly associated with
the reformers of Yiddish spelling in the Soviet Union fail to notice
(often, surely, because of their political allegiances or
philosophical outlook) that the reform towards spelling Yiddish
vocabulary of Semitic origin in sync with the rest of the Yiddish
vocabulary could be looked at as an *appropriation* or a
*(re)claiming* (to use some trendy terms) of these vocabulary items
for *all* speakers/readers/writers, independent of their social class
origins, (non-)religious upbringing, or sex (since content and depth
of education depended on these factors). [Pardon the length of the
sentence.]

Btw, thanks to Bob Rothstein (as always) for _source_!  And I don't
understand what Iosif Vaisman is referring to when mentioning tes-shin
and zayen-shin.  Probably I misunderstood the point, but these
combinations have nothing to do with the Soviet Yiddish spelling
reforms.

Subject: More on "tsadik" and "tsadi"

Although the original and correct pronounciation and spelling of the
18th letter of the Hebrew alphabet is tsadi, the usage has been tsadik
at least from the mid 1940s and on. I grew up in Israel, and was
surprised one day, later in life, to find out that the letter was
"tsadi" and not "tsadik. See the Hebrew dictionary by Gur (Gruzofsky)
2nd edition, 1947, p. 841, where he listed the usage "tsadik" as
slang.

Did it come to Hebrew via Yiddish?  Probably not.  Harkavy calls this
letter "Tzadi" 1896 edition p. 279, while Weinreich "Tsadek", 1968, p.
339. If the change from Harkavi "tsadi" to Weinreich "tsadik" is
reflective of the time of the change; then both Hebrew and Yiddish
moved in about the same time? A personal unsubstantiated guess is that
the known word tsadik was adopted because it is easier to say,
remember, and use; but then that reason existed for a long time, so
why did it change only in our century? In fact I think that the more
elaborate reason goes back to the Talmud B. Shabbat 104a "tzadi
kefufah ve'tzadi peshuta; tzadik kafuf vetzadik pashut" [=a bend tzadi
{letter} and a straight tzadi {letter} connotes a bend tzadik {a
person} and a straight tzadik {a person}]. Thus I would not be
surprise if research will find the letter name used both as tzadi and
tzadik for centuries both in Hebrew and Yiddish.

Subject: Hebrew words in Yiddish

Every time I think I've gotten thoroughly tired of this topic, someone
says something that makes me feel compelled to reply.  Sholem Yafe
says [6.246] that English words derived from Greek are written with
English letters, and by that reasoning, Hebrew words used in Yiddish
should have standard Yiddish spellings.

Wrong analogy.  Greek, Hebrew, Russian, or Yiddish words used in
English are written with the Latin alphabet and given some semblance
of a phonetic English spelling.  Likewise, German or Russian words
used in Yiddish are written with the Hebrew alphabet and a Yiddish
spelling.

A better analogy is how English uses words from other languages that
also use the Latin alphabet.  German, French or Spanish words used in
English retain their German, French, or Spanish spellings, although
their pronunciation is often anglicized.  And Hebrew words used in
Yiddish retain their Hebrew spellings, although their pronunciation is
often Yiddishized.

Subject: Hebrew words in Yiddish

Joseph Ross is mistaken I think.  While it's true that Greek words are
these days rendered in English (and phonetically) that was often not
the case before 1950, particularly in Britain where an easy
familiarity with classical Greek was _the_ hallmark of the cultivated
gentleman.

An easy familiarity with Hebrew (and even more so Aramaic) among
Yiddish speakers plays and always has played the same role as a mark
of social class.

A single example?  Try "makhtese", a word used everywhere but which
these days often goes unrecognized in the original two Aramaic words.
(I've tested.)  Skeptical readers are urged to make up their own word
lists and run their own tests.

Was this always a problem?  Sure.  Almost all women. Lower-class
children.  What, after all, are the vowel markings in the makhzor for
if not to make it easier for the uninitiated to pronounce a loshn-
koydesh word correctly?  And what are these markings if not the
functional equivalent of phonetic spelling?

The rise of literary Yiddish in the 19th century coincided with
urbanization and a rapid increase in secularization. A growing chunk
of the Yiddish-reading public had little or no first-hand familiarity
with Hebrew.  That was the situation in post-revolutionary Russia.

And so for the same reason that Greek is now usually written
phonetically in English..
