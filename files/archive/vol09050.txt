Subject: translation questions

Dear Mendele subscribers,
In editing translations of texts for a forthcoming YIVO publication I have
come across several terms mentioned in Yiddish manuscripts written in various
locations in Poland during the 1930s, which the translators and I are unable
to translate.  I would greatly appreciate your assistance with any of the
following terms familiar to any of you (I've indicated what they might
possibly be based on context in parentheses):

florekh (a chemical or  dye?)
kravapke (a disease)
khoyak (horse or other barn animal?)
gribl (children's game)
tsushnelerlekh (children's game)
babik (children's game)
klaperlekh (children's game)
pukankes (children's game)
estraykhishe shiflelekh (lit. Austrian boats, but what does that mean?)
Fodzhek (child's nickname--does it mean anything?)
tseler (an honor roll student?)
dominik (dominoes? or dice?)

If you wish to respond off-list, kindly contact me at jashandler@aol.com

Many thanks,
Jeffrey Shandler

Subject: use of "lung"

I am looking for an explanation of why the lung is used in Yiddish 
expressions when the intent is the mind or one's thoughts. For example, 
(roughly) "vos iz af'n lung is af'n tsung."

A dank for your help on this.

Subject: Curious about two expressions

"Mershkuts gevorn" and "ale shvarts yorn":

I'm curious about these two expressions and would like to know if they
were/are in common usage in Yiddish-speaking communities.   My mother's
family used them daily; they came from the Keidan area of Lithuania.

A sheynem dank,

Subject: learning

Hello,

What is the best way to learn Yiddish online or by others means.  I am
interested in learning the language as a Jew as well as a physician who
deals with a great number of Hasidim. 

Thanking you
Aaron Meyer

Subject: Levin Kipnis in TMR (The Mendele Review Vol. 03.018)

This is a brilliant tour de force which deserves the widest possible
appreciation and usage. It provides an entree into the mondset of the
Yiddish culture at its best and provides a deep vision of the inside Jewish
world of Eastern Europe and the vision of alterity to the surrounding
world. I commend the whole pedogagical effort.

Subject: ptshah/ptseh

Apologies for a query on tish loshn, and for the yinglish of this message.

In speaking to my grandfather the other day af inglish, he began extolling
the virtues of calf's foot jelly, which he calls "ptseh." (In hebrayishe
alefbays: PAY-TSADEK-AYIN.) My grandfather was born in the United States,
but his family came from Bessarabia. From other Yiddish speakers, however
(speakers from Poland, Lithuania, Ukraine), I have always heard the
pronunciation "ptshah" (with the "tsh" representing the sound of "tch" in
the English word "kitchen"; in alefbays: PAY-TES-SHIN-ALEF). 

Knowing nothing of the etymology of this word and being somewhat hesitant
about the reliability of my grandfather as a reporter of Yiddish
pronunciation, nonetheless I was struck by the difference. Are there other
examples of Bessarabian/Romanian/SW Yiddish "ts" for "tsh"? 

Michael Meckler
