Subject: Curses

In response to Jules Rabin's question about Yiddish curses (Mendele
16.022), I suggest he try to obtain a copy of "Blessings, Curses, Hopes,
and Fears" by James A. Matisoff (Stanford University Press, 2000). This is
a second edition.

Subject: Curses

Jules Rabin (Mendele 16.022) quotes his mother as saying (75 years ago)
"Geh' kerbenye matri," which he translates as "Go fuck your mother," adding
that "we kids took the phrase to mean something as innocent as "Go to
Hell!" or some 1930's equivalent of "Bug off!" The Russian original is
actually "idi k ebene materi," which literally means "go to [your] fucked
mother" (the form "ebene," pronounced approximately [yebyenye], is a
reduction of the past passive participle of the verb "ebat'" [to fuck]). It
is used to mean something like "get the fuck out of here."  I would venture
to guess that his mother knew that it was strong language, but had no idea
how strong or what it literally meant.

A Russian joke tells about a little boy sitting in front of his house. A
passerby says, "Little boy, bring me a glass of water." The little boy
replies, "Idi k ebene materi. I haven't learned to walk yet."

Subject: Vulgarism & "Ashkenazis"

The Russian vulgarism "k yebenoy matyeri" doesn't mean "f... your mother"
[yob tvoyu mat'] but rather "[go] to your f...ed mother," i.e. go to hell.

In the highly amusing Israeli slang dictionary Milon 'olami le-'ivrit
meduberet [World Dictionary of Hebrew Slang] by Dan Ben-Amotz & Netiva
Ben-Yehuda, the editors have the following three pertinent citations:

Lekh-kibini! -- Go to hell; a rather strong curse (short form of lekh
kibinimat).  Citation: "Lekh-kibinimat!", Uri raged. (M. Shamir, He Walked
in the Fields, p. 321];

Lekh-kibinimat! -- a very strong curse (from Russian; or some reason or
other it has become inseparably attached to the Hebrew lekh, go). Citation:
"Don't threaten me.  You want to go! Go, then, go kibinimat! You, too!"

Lekh le-Binyamina! -- Go to Binyamina (a town), a euphemistic phrase in
place of the phrase "lekh kibinimat."

Mayse shehoye:  At the Lauder Foundation's Polish summer camp, I have seen
young Jewish women giggle and blush (and young Jewish men sing much louder)
when the song "yibane ha-mikdash" [may the Temple be rebuilt] was sung,
since "jebane" [yebane] -- in Polish as in Russian -- means "f...ed."

Ashkenazit
As readers of Mendele might appreciate this, I'll take the opportunity to
point out another interesting feature of the Ben-Amotz-Ben-Yehuda Hebrew
slang dictionary about which I wrote a college linguistics paper decades
ago.

In the dictionary, the editors cite the etymology of slang phrases as
coming from Yiddish, French, Russian, Arabic, Turkish, etc.  They also
uniquely designate certain phrases as coming from "Ashkenazit":  This
refers to Hebrew words that passed into Yiddish, obtained in Yiddish a
comical or ironic overtone, and then _returned_ to Hebrew in an Ashkenazic
pronunciation with an ironic sense _alongside_ the original Hebrew word in
its original sense (pronounced in Sephardic Hebrew).

Examples:

Heb. hakham, "wise man" vs. Ashk. khokhem, "wise guy";

Heb. ba'al 'agalah "wagon owner"; Ashk. balagule, "coarse slob" or "poor
driver"

Heb. metziya, "discovery"; Ashk. a metsiye, "what a bargain!" -- usually
dismissive or sarcastic (e.g., it's actually a bad deal)  etc.

Subject: pagira

Does anyone know the meaning of the word "pagira."  This is transliterated
from the Yiddish.  I have been told that it is used in a pejorative manner,
but have not been able to find it in any Yiddish dictionary that I own
(Harkavy, Weinreich).

Thank you for your efforts.
