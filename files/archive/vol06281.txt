Subject: Love: Yiddish style

This is the season to turn to Shir Hashirim, to welcome sweet green
springtime. For a surefire zisn Peysakh,  I heartily recommend a
beautiful new (1996) translation by Curt Leviant of Sholem Aleichem's
slim novella, "Shir Hashirim".

"Song of Songs" by Sholem Aleichem  illustrated by Devis Grebu
(publisher Simon and Schuster, New York 1996 - ISBN O-684-8146-2).

Besides "Stempenyu" where Rukhele and Stempenyu are each  taught a
lesson about physical attraction that can lead to downfall, I believe
this is Sholem Aleichem's only love story. It is a lyrical, magical
book of young love (Sholem Aleichem called it a yugnt roman), its
language bordering on poetry, its story gentle yet poignant, its
characters that warm your heart.

The illustrations are strongly piercing and uniquely imaginative,
Shmulik and Buzie literally freeing themselves from the pages of a
book.

I've given the book to several people from ages 32 to 79 (the shamas
has decreed - yidn koyft bikher!)  and have been warmly thanked each
time for my "sensitivity" and "good taste." What better way to hand
down the shtetl culture of our roots...

A zisn Peysakh aykh ale!

Subject: What song is this?

I'm delighted that mayn khaver un yugnt-fraynd Marv Engel raised the
question and that so many Mendelistn referred him to Moyshe
Beregovski's collection. There's yet another connection that I've had
previous occasion to mention here.

After the 1934 publication in Moscow of Beregovski's "Jewish Musical
Folklore," (Jewish Folk Music), Nathaniel Buchwald, theatre critic of
the New York Yiddish daily _morgn frayhayt_ and Jacob Schaeffer,
conductor of the New York _frayhayt gezangs fareyn_, collaborated on a
folk-operetta, "A Bunt Mit a Statshke" (a conspiracy and a strike)
using many of the songs Beregovski had published. One of them, in two
variants (nos. 107, 108) was called _shimke_(107) or _simkhe_(108)
khazer_. If I remember correctly, the character's name was changed
on-stage to "meyer khazer."

In the operetta, the song described the grisly but justified end of a
conscienceless opportunist who spied on the Jewish workers for the
Czar's police, fled to Istanbul when he was unmasked and there
perished. This would seem to fit the folk lyric far better than the
suggestion that this was a veiled reference to Czar Alexander II (!)
who was assassinated by Nihilists in a bombing, not by stabbing.

A linguistic aside: the Russian word for foreign (cross-border), za
granitshni, was "yidished" in the folksong, receiving the Yiddish "em"
declension: _zagranitshnem meser_.

As to _er is gevaldik tsufridn_, I think the Buchwald/Schaeffer score
_may_ have wedded that ditty to _meyer khazer_, but I won't take an
oath on it.

Subject: What song is this?

My mother suddenly remembered a song which her mother used to sing in
Soviet kolhoz:

        Fun ale meydelekh is Beylke bay mir sheyner,
        Khotch in zags mit ir gevolt tsu geyn azh fir mener...

This was a very popular song, but I've never seen it it any collection.

Maybe somebody has heard it or know the author and the composer.

I would be very thankful if there can be found any information about this.
"Zags" is a registration office in Russian.

Note that the "Erotica and Rustica" that I cited is simply a final
chapter supplement to the full Bernshteyn collection.

Subject: Yidishe shprikhverter

The response to the subject of yidishe shprihkverter is an encouraging
sign that Mendele is getting away from inconsequential trifles
(Oslvanger's umlauts etc.) and back to tachlis. Al Grand's list of 227
addtions to Bernshtayn's collection, even if most of them do violate a
sort of unspoken rule against nibl pe, is a valuable contribution to
Yiddish folklore in general as are Abraham Brumberg's further examples.
I am sure I'm not the only one who has printed them out and added them
to my copy of Bernshtayn. For whatever they're worth, here a few more
proverbs and proverbial expressions.

1. Ale Yivonim hobn ayn ponim. (Yivonim in this case means goyim in
general)
2. Az me fregt a shayle, iz treyf.
3. Vi in posik iz geshribn, oyf a shikse meg men lign.
4. Al tifroysh min ha-tzibur (source Pirke Ovoys: "do not cut yourself
off from the community", but commonly said when drinks are being served
and someone refuses one.).
5. Goy goy, y'makh sh'moy, ki leoylom khasdoy (kheder yingl rhyme)
6. Der goy is tref ober di shikse iz kosher.
7. Mir veln hobn dray teg rosh khoydesh ven... (roughly equivalent to
"That'll be the day!").

Subject: Nibl-pe

Tsi veyst emetser tsi iz ergets faran a yidish-ivrit- (oder farkert)

A dank in foroys.

Does anyone know if there exists anywhere a Yiddish-Hebrew (or
vice-versa) dictionary of obscenities?  And could anyone recommend me
a good general glossary for such words in Hebrew?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Tsveytn tog yontif

In my experience the phrase "tsveytn tog yontif" always expressed
anticlimax.

Subject: Yiddish name cognates

I would appreciate some help with the meaning of the Yiddish name
Leybish, which, I imagine, comes from the word "leyb"--body. Also
would appreciate knowing of English cognates for that name. Thanks.
