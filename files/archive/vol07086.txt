Subject: Duchenen and superstition

I think it was commonplace for a father or bubba to wrap his tallis around a
child during the dukhenning, and to warn the child not to look: `The first
time you look you'll go blind; the second time you'll die.'

It was probably equally traditional for the smart-aleck child to respond, `If
I go blind the first time how can I look a second time?'

Subject: silver dollars for the bride

I remember silver dollars being given to a bride at her wedding for the
purpose of providing the needed silver in the event that a pidyon habend was
required, that being the ceremony for the redemption of the first born son.
So giving silver dollars is the Jewish equivalent of the Italian hopeful wish,
"May your first born be a masculine child."

Subject: Fig

Gilad J. Gevaryahu write authoritatively about the use of the word "fig" in
various translations, including Yiddish.  I would like to add a footnote:

"Fig" in some Mediteranean languages [Italian, for instance] is a slang
representation of the female sexual organs.

Subject: Blindness on looking at the Cohanim while duchaning

Paul Ilie reminds us of the superstition of getting blind on looking at the
Cohanim while they were duchaning.

My mother of sainted memory, descended from a well known Cohanic family
[Shattin] was an affirmer of this traditional belief. She told me that if I
were to look at the Cohanim while they were duchaning, I would surely become
blind in one eye.  I asked, "And if I looked again?" Answer: "In the other
eye, too."  "And if I looked again?" "Blind in your third eye!"

Azoy geyst!

Subject: turkey and Indianer

All this talk about turkeys is ruffling a lot of feathers and making
people give one another the bird--and a bird in the hand can easily be
translated as a fig, except when you're eating crow.....
	in regard to Lou Fridlender's comment that Sholem Aleichem would
have been in touch only ordinary Germany, I wonder.  First of all,
"Indianer" was certainly ordinary German for (inter alias) "turkey" in
Austria.  Secondly S.A. like many other Yiddish speakers of his era
certainly could and did read German, and an enormous amount of German
literature has come out of Austria during the past few centuries (not 
just Freud and Hitler).  So Sholem Aleichem
might very possibly have found the word "Indianer" meaning "turkey" in an
Austrian novel or newspaper.
	then again, he might not.

	For me the point is more mute than moot since, in order to set the
fox (fiks mit a biks) to guard the henhouse (no chicken he)  I've
decided to translate the story for an anthology I'm contracting
for--and to play on what might be a pun I think I'll render "indyaner" as
"Turk"....etv--at the risk of coming up with a turkey.
	then again, I might not.
	if there are any objections (and I'm sure you give fig) please
insert them in my suggestion box, and we'll talk turkey  I hope I don't
step on too many toes--or should I say claws?
	incidentally, Al Grand's Yiddish version of Iolanthe, or at least
the song that ran in Mendele, was quite grand and grandiose...too bad the
audience for translations into Yiddish is even smaller than the
readership for English translations of Yiddish.

Subject: Isaac Meir Dick

Steven Cassedy inquires about Ayzik-Meyer Dik's _Der shivim moltsayt_ 
(07.084).  David G. Roskies published "An Annotated Bibliography of 
Ayzik-Meyer Dik" in _The Field of Yiddish:  Studies of Language, Folklore, 
and Literature_, Fourth Collection, ed. Marvin I. Herzog, Barbara 
Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, Dan Miron, and Ruth Wisse (Philadelphia:  Institute
for the Study of Human Issues, 1980), pp. 117-84.

In it, he reports he has seen copies of _Der shivim moltsayt_ at Widener
(Harvard) and YIVO (New York) libraries.  Roskies' entry (#144):

  _Der shivim moltsayt_ (The seventieth birthday feast.)  Pseud. AMaD.
  Vilna:  Rom, 1877, 90 pp. (W[idener], Y[IVO]).

        The rags to riches story of Tobias Moser,
        son of a melamed from Mezritsh.  in the preface,
        Dik outlines his literary philosophy.

There is a lengthy Dik bibliography reproduced in Zalmen Reyzen's Leksikon
[s.v. Dik, Ayzik (Yitskhok) Meyer], which he bases on that of Khaykl
Lunsky, who was the librarian of the Strashun Library in inter-war Wilno.
In that entry, Reyzen cites _Der shivim moltsayt_ as one of the examples of
works carrying "characteristic Prefaces" that are important sources for
Dik's biography and "velt-anshyung" [Weltanschauung?] (vol 1., p. 733).

Subject: Tumbalalayka in Vietnamese

My friend Seymour Frydrych of Toronto asked me to submit these comments on
his behalf, in regard to the Vietnamese version of Tumbalalayka, recently
under discussion on Mendele. Seymour told me that after reading the letters
about this, he brought a Yiddish recording of Tumbalalayka to his office and
played it for his Vietnamese secretary, who has been in Canada for about 15
years. She immediately recognized the melody and said she remembered hearing
it as a child, as a popular song with both French and Vietnamese lyrics. She
said it dates back to the French era in Vietnam, then Indo-China, and thinks
that it was  popular there first with French lyrics, and that later on lyrics
in Vietnamese were used. She cannot recall any of the words now, but if she is
able to get them, they will eventually find there way to Mendele.

Subject: tumbalalayka

I'm sorry if this has alredy been posted, but I've missed a few issues.
Regarding the lines, 'vos ken vaksen, vaksen on regn?' The reply we have
always used is "protsenten kenen vaksen, vaksen on regn.'

Harvey Spiro's Sneeze protocols sound like those in my family except
that they go on further. `Tsum gezunt!' alone, or else  'Gezunt, tsu leben,
tsu lange yor. Tsu vaksn, tsu kvellen, a chosen tsu veln, tsu der chupe tsu
shteln'
