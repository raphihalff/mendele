Here's another one for the list of greetings.  My father used to say, when
asked:  Vos makht a yid?  "Nu, mir lebn un gott mitshet zikh."

Subject: openers/vos makhstu?

A couple of friends of mine, both born in Latvia, had several of these not yet
mentioned by others: 

In response to "vos hert zikh?" -

        Vos m'ret.

        Az m'shtinkt on, hert zikh.

In response to "vos makht a yid?" or "vos makhstu?" -

        Keyn bris nit.

"vos makhstu?" reminds me of a story involving a non-Yiddish speaking friend
whose Yiddish-speaking father-in-law had a friend named Max.  Whenever the
father-in-law would greet someone (in Yiddish), my friend could never
understand why he kept asking people what Max did when he had known Max for
who-knows-how-many-dozens-of years and knew full well what he did for a
living.  :-)

Subject: Sobieski's yorn

These expressions depend on who used to own your part of territory.  My
grandmother grew up in Uman (Kievskaya guberniya, Ukraine), which used to
belong to the Polish counts of the Potocki family (currently re-established in
their palace in Krakow, after living in Oakland, California).  So her
expression for things "way back when" was, "Dos is geveyn in Pototsky's
tsaytn."

Tsibetsky's Yurren reminds me of my mother saying "Noch fun Chmelnitzki's

Subject: German word "oder" 

In regard to Irv Young's question about the German word "oder":  as any
German-English dictionary will reveal to him, "oder" doesn't mean "other"--it
means "or" just like the Yiddish cognate "oder".  The German word for "other"
(adjective)  is "andere(r)"--just like the Yiddish cognate;  however, the
Yiddish word can also mean "second"--a connotation that has disappeared in
German except in a few leftover expressions such as "am anderen Tag" = "the
next day."  By the same token, the Yiddish adjective "tsveyt" can mean both
"second" and "other":  e.g. "im tsveytn tsimer" = in the other (next)  room.
This meaning, "next, other," is absent from the German adjective "zweit"
except in a few expressions like "das zweite Mal" = the second (or next) time.

From: YOU 2 IG <YOU2IG@aol.com>

I hasten to retract an erroneous submission hopefully before the excoriation
begins.  I refer to the identification of "oder" as the German word for other.
Clearly I meant "ander"  and sincerely regret the error and any indigestion it
may have caused. --Ganz verschaimt !

Subject: Homentaschen

Tayre Mendelyanchicks:

S'iz shoyn tzaht zikh tzu dermonen vi vikhtik iz der homentasch, vus far a
kraft es hot, un iberal tzu loyben der eybeshter, vahl er hot uns gebentscht
mit a zah heilige zakh baz'man hazeh, omeyn.

It's high time we recall how important and how powerful the homentasch is, and
to praise the Lord and pass the ammunition for the blessing he has given us at
this season.

It is easy, of course, to forget the "lowly" homentasch, because our good
neighbors, and some who are, loy oleynu, not so good, nebekh, have khapt onto
it as if it were their own.  We gave it to the world gladly, knowing how much
good it could do--and do we get any credit for it?  A nekhtige tug!

Take the Egyptians, for example.  Take them, takeh.  Yosef hatzaddik (Joseph)
explained the importance of the homentasch to Pharaoh.  He pointed out that
the step pyramids, such as those at Sakkara, were utterly useless, and were
doomed eventually to fall into ruin, which has happened, as anyone can see.
Make a pyramid with four sides of perfectly symmetrical homentaschen, he said,
and you've really got something.  Nu, Pharaoh, y'makh shmoy v'zikhroy, decided
to experiment with the grand homentasch design and what did he do?  No sooner
did he have the secret of the homentasch firmly under his belt--it should only
have stuck in his craw--than he promptly forgot Joseph and turned on his
people, enslaving them and forcing them to build his great four-sided
homentaschen, which stand proudly to this day.

Every schoolchild learns the Pythagorean theorem.  I wouldn't, kholileh, want
to take away from Pythagoras or the Greeks any of the glory they used to have.
But we have always believed that the ethical thing to do is to give credit
where credit is due.  The fact is--I'm not making this up--that Pythagoras
studied at the yeshiva of Beys Hillel.  Moreover, I have it on good authority
that when he was a boy, his father, realizing that he was not getting such a
good education from the wandering sophists, who even then were serving as
private tutors, since very few of the Greek cities had public schools, decided
that a good day school education was what he wanted for his son.  There was no
better school in those days than the local Hillel Day School.  Since Mr.
Pythagoras was a widower, nebekh, he sent the boy to live at the yeshiva.
Pythagoras Jr. was a pretty good student, according to fragments of records
that were destroyed in the great fire at the Alexandrian library, though he
was often guilty of bittul toyreh, since he liked to strum on his harp and
dream up theories about musical instruments.  But I digress from my story.

He used to take his meals at the homes of Mrs. Shapiro, Mrs. Goldberg, Mrs.
Melnick, and other kindly Jewish ladies in the neighborhood.  Essen teg they
called it in those days.  Nu, came Purim, and naturally Mrs. Shapiro gave her
young guest a few homentaschen.  He inquired of his rebbe the next day about
this remarkable delicacy, and the rebbe took him aside (for the arcane secrets
of kabboleh are not revealed in public), opened the holy sforim that deal with
the homentasch and its great powers, and started the lad on his way to
greatness.  What is called the Pythagorean theorem is in fact nothing more
than a simple formula for squeezing the greatest number of homentaschen onto a
single baking pan, which every Jewish housewife had been taught by her bobbeh.
But listen!  The kid made a fortune selling  pamphlets about the right-angled
homentasch and became one of the yeshiva's biggest supporters, serving on the
board for many years.  You have to have to give him credit, he really knew how
to market an idea, and no one had a copyright on it anyway.

Incidentally, it was Mrs. Melnick's cholent that Pythagoras ate every Shabbos
that convinced him that beans have such serious side effects that he declared
them non-kosher when he founded his own yeshiva years later.

If you want to know why the dollar is still the strongest currency in the
world, just check it out carefully.  On the back side of the greenback you
will find the homentasch.  When Jefferson designed the great seal of the
United States, believe me, he knew what he was doing.  There's the four-sided
homentasch that the Egyptians learned was the most powerful door to eternity;
and above it, winking its eye, is the divine homentasch itself.  As long as
that homentasch is on the dollar, we're in good shape.

By the way, the early geniuses of finance knew precisely what they were doing
when they settled on Wall Street as the site of their business, locating it in
Tribeca, a homentasch-shaped section of Manhattan, and therefore naturally the
most powerful financial district in the world.

When our government needed a powerful, fast, invisible fighter plane, to whom
did it turn?  To none other than the Lubavitcher Rebbe, zikhrono livrokho, who
was not only a great talmid khokhom, but also an engineer who graduated from
the Sorbonne.  "No problem," said the Rebbe.  "You should have asked sooner."
And he prepared blueprints of a fighter jet built in the shape of a
homentasch.  A few little adjustments here and there, and we had the Phantom
Jet, which they call "delta wing" because for them, homentasch is a mouthful.

Nu, kinderlakh, may we all have a joyous Purim as we spin our dreydlekh, shake
our lulavs, hear the shofar, enjoy a latke or two, have a little schnapps . .
. (hic!)
