Subject: re ethnicities

I always wonder why the discussion of the population origins of the
Ashkenazis goes from pickled herrings back to the time of the Zealots,
with a brief nod in the direction of something called Medieval Europe,
which begins, when? 9th Cen tury? 8th Century?  There is a great big void
in between, it seems.  As one Isr aeli paleographer once showed me: there
are several centuries of texts altogeth er missing, between about 200 and
450-500 CE.  Not a jot or tittle is to be fou nd.  And yet the later
texts correspond withe earlier ones.

Point of interest: my son, a Chinese archaeologist, who has mounted the
great s how at present in LA, which goes to NY Mus of NHistory in
September, was taken to a great site in Inner MOngolial last summer among
about the 100+ new city si tes recently discovered.  This one had a wall
10m high, wiht a base of pounded earth 10m wide!  and...seven miles
around.  The Black City.  City of 100 Temple s.  What had they just dug
up there in Inner Mongolia, among other things? The cornerstone or
foundation stone of a 4th Century Nestorian temple!  I suppose e
ventually a synagogue will turn up too, or the floor of one, or a
cornerstone. Item: the other year I read about the underwater
explorations in Caesarea, the search for the foundation of the mole and
breakwater that must have been there for it to have been a port of
Herod's at all, and what did the scuba men come u p with? tons of shards:
Chinese pottery!  Think of the size of the trade overla nd and by sea
that it required for so much pottery to have been available only to be
used for fill to make a mole!

J Levin talks about Poles and such ethnics.  Those folks show up in
history muc h later.  Casimir the first invites Rhineland Jewry to his
kingdom because he n eeds artisans, literates, craftsmen, burgers, etc.
That is rather late in Medi eval times too.

And then, we all have friends and relatives who could pass for Tatars
without m akeup or hair work or epicanthal tucks.  Jews as far back as
they remember.  Ch inese? Kazaks? etc.

As for that character at UCLA, wait till I get my hands around
his...gradesheet !  Protocols.  These guys get scholarships and have to
earn Brownie points.  We have seen it for decades now.  Also some profs,
just to stay on Arafat's safe side, I guess.

[The time has come--to put it mildly--for this thread or theme to be
put to bed.  There is simply not enough in most of the posts that deals
with Yiddish; in any case we seem to be going over old ground.  Unless
there is an overwhelming cry of dismay from our readers, Mendele will
not accept any more mail on this subject.  Noyekh]

Subject: Non-Slavic Languages Conference, May 1995

The University of Chicago will be sponsoring the 9th International
conference on the Non-Slavic languages of the former USSR Wednesday to
Saturday, 3-6 May 1995. (We shall try to schedule all papers for
Thursday, 4 May through Saturday noon, 6 May 1995. Only if the number of
papers accepted requires it, will presentations be scheduled for
Wednesday, 3 May 1995.) Yiddish clearly falls within the purview of this
conference and we would be very happy to consider any linguistic papers
dealing with Yiddish, particularly papers dealing with the relations
between Yiddish and co-territorial languages, Slavic or non-Slavic. If
you are interested in receiving information about participating in the
conference, please send a message to:

hia5@midway.uchicago.edu

and we will send you full details.

Subject: medical texts

For Mikhl:

If I'm not mistaken there is a chapter or section on such texts in Jean
Baumgarten's Introduction a la litterature yiddish ancienne. In any case, I
know that he has been working on such texts.
