Subject: Asch transliteration

I am the foreign languages cataloger at Purdue University and have done
some cataloging of our Yiddish collection.  If you have a book called
Hebraica cataloging: a guide to ALA/LC romanization and descriptive
cataloging it may be of some help.  Transliteration of Yiddish seems
fairly straightforward, with the exception of words of Hebrew origin.
The section on Yiddish romanization begins on page 22.

"Icke, dette, kieke mal."  It's a very common saying in Berlin, not only
with kids, used to refer to the Berlin dialect, and it just combines
three especially characteristic variants of common words:  "Icke" for
"Ich" (I), "dette" for "das" (that) and "kieke mal" for "guck mal" (now
look).  I don't think it's Yiddish.

Subject: Kick a mal

In response to Mr Orbach:

I am a speaker of both standard Yiddish and standard German.  Here is
my attempt to explain.  I cannot understand why the vowel is i: kick.
Perhaps Icke and Dicke are children's figure and were therefore made to
rhyme with the verb.  I can't rule out but I discard the possibility that
this is from yiddish, here is why:

"Gucke mal 'her" pronounced Kuke mal (hier)her or just plain Gucke mal
are extremely common on all levels of spoken German.  The word mal is
used to add strength or urgency to the request to look.  Eg.  Bringe mir
mal das Buch! Emphasizes Bring me!  I have never seen this in Yiddish
where "mol" means exclusively time in the sense of one time or 5x5.  In
view of this, the expression Kick mal is clearly rooted In German and not
in Yiddish. The only question is what is the reason for the i vowel and
what is Icke Dicke?  The latter probably is a children's invention but
who knows?  It seems to me that if you can establish Icke Dicke as a
German expression than you may discard a theory of Yiddish influence.  If
you can find Icke Dicke in Yiddish then Yiddish influence is likely.  I
don't recall whether dick meaning fat is used in Yiddish (I personally
you grob, grobboykhik, or fet).  If dick meaning fat is used only in
German as I suspect may be the case, then you can probably rule out
Yiddish influence altogether and attribute the i in kicke to rhyming with
Icke Dicke.  One thing is certain, the rhyme could never have occured in
Yiddish alone, 1) because of the -e added in the command form GuckE mal
and 2) because of the mal added for stress.  At most the expression
represents Yiddish influence on German, but the phrase itself cannot be
described as a Yiddish one.

Subject: The Light Ahead, ironies, miracles

Where would Jews be without irony?

In this case, first of all, the suggestion by Ben Alpers, responding to
my comments on "The Light Ahead," that I am disrespectful of "historical
losers." As someone who turned to Yiddish as a way, among other things,
of fulfilling Walter Benjamin's injunction to "brush history against the
grain," I totally and completely concur with Ben's concern for
remembering both the apparent "winners" and the "losers" of history.
Indeed, my own tastes tend toward siding with the latter.  Insofar as my
original posting can be read as suggesting something different, I accept
Ben's criticism and stand corrected.

But I don't consider it self-evident that to call Jewish communists in
the late 1930's "ideologically-crazed" is simply a reflection on their
failure to predict the future.  Here again I entirely concur with Ben
(indeed, it's a cornerstone of much of what I do): it is outrageous to
reproach anyone, Jew or gentile, for failing to predict/conceive of the
Holocaust.  But my comment was less about a failure to see into the
future, than about a particular view of the present. One character from
"The Light Ahead" has particularly stuck in my memory: the stocky,
beardless Jew, worker's cap on his head, who, throughout the film, and
especially when Mendele's delegation of "proste yidn" confronts the
balebatim, manifests a stereotypically pure and focused anger.  This
Jew's upraised fist, endlessly multiplied, is what, for the makers of
this film, would overthrow oppression everywhere, throughout the world.
To believe that the planet was locked in combat between all the world's
balebatim, be they the rulers of a shtetl or the rulers of Germany, on
one hand, and on the other hand, all the workers of the world, to believe
with absolute, politically-correct, messianic certainty that this
conflict could only end with the victory of the latter -- this is what I
call "ideologically-crazed," and although this too is not evident from my
original comment, it is a state of being I'm hardly unambiguous about, be
it in the 1930's or 1960's.  Nevertheless, the occasion for all this
(Rick's original posting) is OUR reaction to a film, and here it is
impossible FOR US not to view the film through Holocaust lenses, for us
not to counterpose the film's "light" to the darkness that ensued
historically, not to ponder the "craziness" of Jewish belief in the
"light ahead" at such a time...

Finally, Birobidzhan.  It was in my mind because I had just lectured
about it in my course on East European Jewish history.  I ended the
lecture with a description of the destruction of Yiddish culture in the
Soviet Union climaxing in 1952, and the subsequent Jewish renewal
movement which discovered itself in Hebrew.  When a student then asked
about Birobidzhan and Yiddish today, I answered that nevertheless one
never knows.  Between the fall of the wall and the Internet, I replied,
who knows what may emerge into light.  The following day on this very
screen my own posting to Mendele appeared followed by the miraculous
electrons from Birobidzhan...

Thanks, Birobidzhaner khaveyrim, for this small miracle, which Jews need
as much as they need irony, and thanks, Ben, for the opportunity to
reflect more deeply.

Subject:  More on Yeke

    In Sh.Aleichem's story "Joseph" (_Monologues_) the narrator refers to
the young intellectual socialist Jews as Yenkele.  Could this be a
precursor of Yeke?
