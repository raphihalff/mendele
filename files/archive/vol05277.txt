Subject: /zun-shtraaml/

eliyahu juni: found your description of your purim in boro park fascinating --
thanks!

re /zun-shtraaml/, your idea that it was a disambiguation is interesting --
but couldn't /zun/ also mean 'son'?

there's one additional point that may be relevant, even to a disambiguation
story: for some reason,_some_ vowels seem to vary while others don't. what i
mean is: central yiddish speakers who typically say /zin/, /kimen/, /git/ etc
may _sometimes_ say /zun/, /kumen/, /gut/ -- so at least they've heard it both
ways and _can_disambiguate or at least vary an item when they choose to. other
vowels seem _not_ to vary like this for them -- e.g. /dus/, /vus/, /tukhes/...
are much less likely to be said (and therefore heard) as /dos/, /vos/,
/tokhes/... fishman even notes this somewhere -- don't have the reference at
hand -- but has no explanation. as for /shtraaml/, i don't remember what
fishman says about the ay/aa variation but i can tell you it was a shock to me
when i got yivo-ized that words with /aa/ could be pronounced any other way!
my great insight came when i realized that my tante braandl had the same name
that my textbook was writing /brayne/. :) i'd never heard it with /ay/ -- and
had never heard /maanse/, /maarev/, /shaale/, /laadn/, /shtraaml/ etc with
/ay/ either.

Subject: _zun-shtraaml_ and some questions for Eliyohu Juni

_zun-shtraaml_ and some questions for Eliyohu Juni:

I like Eliyohu Juni's explanation [5.274] for the anomalous _zun_ 'sun' in
_zun-shtraaml_ in an area where one would expect _zin_, _except_ that:

To my knowledge, there is only a small area on the Polish-Lithuanian border
and, perhaps on the Belorussian-Ukrainian border as well, where _zin_ 'sun'
and _zin_ 'son' are actually homonymous. The two words are _always_ homonymous
in the Lithuanian-Belorussian area--both are _zun_--but _not_, as a rule,
elsewhere, where the _i_ vowel occurs. In Poland-Galicia, the two are
distinguished by quantity, in the Ukraine, perhaps by a qualitative feature.
In both cases,

di zin ("short" _i_) 'the sun', is clearly distinguished from _der ziin_
("long" _i:_) 'the son' or, for that matter _dii ziin_ 'the sons'. Eliyohu's
explanation would fail in theses cases.

I'm a bit uncertain though about the prevailing situation at some locations in
what for many of us may be a mysterious
Transcarpathian--Transylvanian--Hungarian area. Are the words for 'sun',
'son', and 'sons' homonymous there?  Does the word _zin_ 'sense', 'mind' also
occur? E.g., _se hot nisht keyn zin_, or _er hot es in zin(en)_?  Is it
synonymous with the others?

At these same locations, does _gut_ occur with _u_ or with _i_? What of
_shmutsik_, if it occurs at all? Is it with _u_ or with _i_? _blum_ or
_bliim_? _shtru(n)dl_ (sic!) or _shtrii(n)dl_?

If you're still with me, note that at some Volhynian locations in the
Belorussian-Ukrainian border area, where all four of these _zin_ words ARE
homonymous (all are, phonetically, either _zin_ or _ziin_) there is yet a
fifth word that may enter the merger: _er iz blind, er ken nit ZIN_.

Nice, no?

Subject: German contact

hello again, eliyahu. i have no figures on movement from german-speaking lands
to central-yiddish-speaking lands in recent times and i'm sure you're right
that it was minimal -- but it certainly occurred! my great-grandparents moved
from carpato-rus to hamburg, where my grandfather was born -- and my
grandfather moved back to carpato-rus, where my father was born. and no one in
my father's family thought this was unusual. (this is not the grandfather that
grew up with chickens and goats in poland -- that was my mother's father. this
was my father's side, the literate side of the family. :-) )

one other possibility. what was the official language of interaction with the
outside world in lite? i have a pile of documents (leases, deeds, etc)
relating to my father's family's store and house in carpato-rus from the late
19th and early 20th century and most are in german, with a few in hungarian.
did german have this role in lite as well? german was also the lingua franca
in my father's family's INSIDE world -- my aunt and uncle's wedding
announcement in the early 1930s was in german since that was the only language
they were sure everyone on both sides could read, my aunt's family being
hungarian speakers who did not speak yiddish. would german have served in this
way in lite?

as for the german-style spelling, that is still how my father's brother writes
-- but i can't believe that that would have resulted in the use of basic
vocabulary items in the spoken language like _gestern_ or _monat_.

Subject: "Az me git, nem"

The version of the expression above was jarring to my ears.  My father, who
arrived in this country in 1910 from Galizie would often say "Az me git, nemt
men".  The addition of the "men" seems to give the phrase needed balance.
Comments?
