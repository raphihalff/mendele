Subject: Nota Bene (correction)

In an earlier posting (5.084), I wrote, "As a word processor, Nota Bene
is far from perfect -- no spell check..."  In my haste, I neglected to
qualify that.  I should have written "no *Yiddish* spell check"; N.B.
does have an English spell check and the Lingua manual states that
"optional spelling dictionaries are available for a number of European
languages (French, Spanish, Italian, and German).  Additional
dictionaries are under development."

A few years ago, there was talk at the National Yiddish Book Center, of
developing a Yiddish spell check for Nota Bene, but I believe that idea
is not being pursued at present.

Subject: Hebrew Word Processors for Yiddish

I have tried a number of WP's for Hebrew to be used for Yiddish,
including an add-on to Word Perfect, which I found to be, at best,
horrible.

The most satisfactory program, and the one that I am using now is Dagesh,
made by Kivun (Jerusalem), and distributed by Davka, 7074 N.Western
Avenue; Chicago, IL phone: 1-800-621-8227.  Call and ask for their
catalogue.

Dagesh has all the nekudos (althgough the pasakh in pasakh tvay yudn is
slightly off center, it really looks OK.  It is not perfect, as it is
quirky and cranky, especiaal when you try to mix 2 or more languages, but
it is the best I've seen.  If there is another that is better, please let
me know so I can give it a whirl.

Subject: Yiddish fonts

In complement to the information on Yiddish fonts and the request from
Brenda Fayerman, I can now confirm that the macro's I made earlier in
WinWord6 using the WinGreek 19 shareware now work very well and allow any
Yiddish character combination (in addition to the standard hebrew
character combinations already available in Wgreek). In fact I assigned
most of the specific Yiddish signs, including correct spacing of double
yud with patach, as TTF's (True type fonts allowing correct screen views
and printing) and gave them a keyboard assigment that is quite logical.
It is a-"home-made" solution for which you need Wingreek 19, but useable
for anyone that accepts to learn a little on macro's in WinWord6 and I
could send the WinWord6 template on a diskette or upload it somewhere if
there is interest.

The only drawback I have is that the end of line or carriage return you
need some attention to avoid that the next word comes on the previous
line instead of the next, but with my speed of typing (slow) this does
not involve too much effort.

The major advantage is that it is using an existing wordprocessor (one of
the 2 most important for the moment) and allows any other kind of
operation with it.

Subject: Oxford summer school problems

I wonder if some Mendelniks have been at the Oxford Summer school this
year.

I registered for a 2 weeks (on 4) of their yiddish summer course as well
as a two weeks room at a college for me and my wife (she wanted to
improve her english at another school over there). Unfortunately, due to
some health conditions popping up, it was advisable, to stay close to our
home base and I cancelled the course one month before my arrival.

Big was my surprise to recieve ar only reaction one month later to have
my Visa card and my bank account debitted for an amount of USD 3000, that
was the double of what I asked for. I spent hours on the phone as well as
several faxes around to correct the situation on the bank, Visa etc...

However, I was not finished regarding surprises: the Yiddish Institute
refused to refund any money for the 2 weeks, because they pretended they
had to pay the rooms at the colleges, and refused me to give any
assistance on that matter. I had according to them to accept this as a
"fait-accompli", which involves they still claim me an amount of USD 2000
for no services neither goods rendered. Faxes, telephone, neither
registered letters did not help.

The advance I paid to another institute in Oxford for my wife's english
course was fully refunded, without any queries from my side.

Without wanting to go in more details about the serious financial
problems and embarassements I had over the last two weeks with my Visa
card, bank account and subsequent problems with several payments blocked
(this all due to the completely wrong non-authorised debit by Oxford
Institute for Yiddish studies from my Visa account), I would like to
receive by E-mail some feedback from those mendelniks that attended the
course.

I still hope that the above problem is only an organisationnal problem of
them in running this course for the first time and will therefor be
corrected and that I do not need to make use of the documents and the
full legal file I have build up mean-while.

I must also confess that after E-mailing with some mendelniks, I found
out that there has been a lot of correspondence going on about the
Oxford institute before I joined Mendele. I regret not having checked it
before, because that could have avoided these problems. I would also not
have posted on Mendele the dates and information about the course if I
had known there was some contention about the institute.

Anyhow and thanks to this experience, in the future, I will refrain going
to "exotic" places for doing yiddish and stay very quietly at the
University of Brussels continuing the normal course and the
financially-save summer events.

Subject: Iosif Vaisman's Virtual Shtetl

Back in Mendele 5.071, Noyekh mentioned Iosif Vaisman's Virtual Shtetl,
and he told how wonderful it was.  I am here to second that motion.  I
accessed it, and I can truly say that every Mendelyaner with access to
Netscape, or any other gateway to WWW, should by all means visit this
remarkable site.  My thanks to Noyekh for bringing it to my attention. In
case you don't have the address handy, it is:
