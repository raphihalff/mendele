Subject: Yenem tsu kritikirn iz laykht, ober...

In Mendele 4.417,3 I published a post called "The _Forward_ needs an
in-house Yiddish consultant," with examples of incorrect transliteration
of Yiddish words and its general ignorance of Yiddish (for example,
"sheygetzes" instead of "shkotzim").

Now comes the Forward's Philologos, its language commentator, and
criticizes the New York _Times_  for its haphazard attitude towards
Yiddish words.  In his column dated May 12, 1995, p. 10, he wrote:

"The New York Times checks its reporters' English with a fine-toothed
comb, but when it comes to Yiddish... its copy editors simply flag
through what comes along."

He specifically refers to an article by the _Times_ correspondent in
Israel who interviewed the Mayor of Jerusalem Ehud Olmert, and quoted him
as saying ,with reference to demographic policy matters in the city, "I
have to show who is the balabuste [of this city]."  The correspondent
added the explaination that "the Yiddish word means master (sic) of the
house."

Was it a verbatim quote?  Highly unlikely.  Jerusalem has a large
Yiddish-speaking population.  Besides, there is a gender confusion.  It
is very doubtful that Mr. Olmert would have referred to himself by the
feminine "bal(e)boste," instead of the masculine "balebos."

Philologos then goes on to say:  "... One wonders whether the Times would
have let such an error slip by unnoticed had it been in French or
Spanish... It is a sign that [Yiddish] is still regarded in some circles
as a quaint folk dialect, a _zhargon_, to use the old word, that has no
real rules and needn't be held up to elementary standards of correctness.
From the Times one expects a less cavalier attitude."

Well, there is a Yiddish saying  "khesroynes zet men nor af yenem" (one
readily finds faults in others).  What about his  own bailiwick?

It would be of singular interest if Philologos would address the same
criticisms he leveled at the Times to the _Forward_  as well.  Since the
_Forward_ is a Jewish paper, it would  equally be called for, if not,
indeed, more so.

Subject: Anniversaries

The recent posting on Mendele of its outstanding growth is due mainly to
the conscientious effort of our list moderator Noyekh and to Dave Sherman
our Toronto friend who started it all with his predecessor, Mail Yiddish.
No better award can be given to Noyekh than to tell our Yiddish-loving
friends about Mendele.

Along with this growth of Yiddish online, has been that of the
International Yiddish Club Conferences. Groups in varied forms called a
club, vinkl, leyenkrayz, or even shmoozkrayz are coming together. The
Miami event next March 1-4 will be the Third and is expected to be the
largest one. Origin of these Conferences can be dated back to the
cooperation of the editors of the four Yiddish club newsletters extant in
North America at that time. Recently we welcomed the newest newsletter
from Houston Texas.

This upcoming January marks the fifth anniversary of DER BAY, and a
limited, special fifth-anniversary edition will be published. It started
as a local, single-sheet issue listing Yiddish events in the San
Francisco area. Today's database is shown below. Our society seems to be
interested in statistics. :-)~

US                               1280
US online                         141
Canada                            210
Others                            156
US "clubs"                        285
US teachers                       351
US klezmer groups                 135

It has been the unselfish sharing of information among the groups that
has made all this possible. Yiddish is finding its new strength in new
technology and new geographic areas.

Subject: Miuskeit

Louis Fridhandler (Mendele 4.419) recently asked about the origin of
"Mieskeit" or, as I have often heard it pronounced, "Mie-us-keit," and
related words such as "Mies" and their relation to German.

The Hebrew origin of these terms is quite simple:  The root is mem, alef,
samekh.  The word "ma'as" and its many derivatives appear frequently
throughout the Tanakh, always with the implication of despising,
rejecting, or repudiating som ething or someone.  So far as I can
determine, the Biblical uses of the word ar e all verbs, never nouns or
adjectives.

In the Talmud and other rabbinic literature, however, the noun form
appears, us ually as "mi'us," spelled mem, yud, alef, vov, samekh (the
yud added to aid in pronunciation, but often omitted).  It was a short
step from "mi'us" (or mi-usa in Aramaic) to "mies" and its derivatives in
Yiddish, which clearly didn't have to turn to German (high, middle, or
low) to learn how to refer to what is ugly, gross, or despicable.
