Subject: Sholem-Aleykhem's Mazepevke and Byron's Mazeppa

In my article _Place Names and Their Meaning in Sholem-Aleykhem's Work
[in "The Three Great Classic Writers of Modern Yiddish Literature:
Sholem-Aleykhem," eds. Zuckerman and Herbst, Joseph Simon, Pangloss
Press, 1994, p.30], I discussed Mazepevke.  He created it no later than
1888.  It is an awful place befitting its association with Mazepa, the
Cossack hetman who succeeded the infamous Khmielnitski.  Incidentally,
wretched Mazepevke is the original home town of Menakhem-Mendl, not
beloved Kasrilevke, as in the revised form now available.

I did not then mention Lord Byron's poem, Mazeppa, because a quick
reading made it clear that Byron's subject was somebody else.  However,
there may still be some untapped connection.  Sholem-Aleykhem read Byron
(probably in Russian translation).  That was revealed in at least one
place: in an interview in the New York Times published on Oct. 22, 1906,
page 7 where he is quoted saying that his favorite English writers were
Shakespeare, Byron, Kipling and Mark Twain.

Could it be that his imagination was triggered by noting Byron's
subject?

Could anyone in this khevre, expert in English literature, throw light
on whom Byron's Mazeppa was modeled?  Was it simply Byron's imagination?
Perhaps his Mazeppa was a relative of the successor to Khmielnitski?

I would guess that Sholem-Aleykhem obtained much inspiration for his own
prolific output from his wide reading.  One hint must have led to many
associations with his current experience and his ideas flowed profusely.

Subject: Sources of humor? Oy vey!

It's true.  Looking at the sources of humor is no laughing matter.

The struggle to achieve mastery over life's occasional blows is fought
in many different ways.  Humor is a difficult but attractive and often
effective choice.  A letter from 29-year-old Sholem Aleichem to Shimen
Dubnov illustrates.  While humor is, at its source, self-directed, this
example takes off from a dreadful experience of another Russian Jew.
Since almost all Russian Jews were in the same boat, I suggest it is
also self-directed.

The letter is an invitation to Dubnov to come for a visit.  To reinforce
the invitation, he praises the charm of his two children.  First, he
relates a rather frightening interruption in the life of Jacob Dineson,
but Sholem Aleichem puts a mildly humorous, ironic spin on it (surely
not meant to rub salt into Dineson's wounded dignity).  Reaction to the
kind of danger that Russian Jews constantly faced then must have been
potentially overwhelming, consuming, but gentle humor (often in the form
of irony) aided maintenance of perspective and mastery over crippling
anxiety.  Is it any wonder, Sholem Aleichem was so beloved?

Excerpt of letter to Dubnow, orignially in Russian, translated into
Yiddish by Dubnov, translated into English by me.

      Aug 7, '88

      ...To show even more clearly that you _must_ stay at my place, I
      relate a sad tale of what befell J. Dineson, whom you know.  This
      fine, likable man was in Podol [a district in Kiev where Jews were
      allowed to live]. Just in time for midnight prayers (while happily
      reading my "Bouquet," by the way), "they" thumped on his door...
      Well, after this and that, "they" suggested he read my "prose
      stanzas" some other time.  Without ceremony "they" placed him in
      some sort of dungeon for about ten hours. That was just two weeks
      ago. He [Dineson] swore never to read my works again, but also
      never to be in Podol again.  Now is it not clear that you must
      stay with me?

      About being crowded, there's no point in discussing it.  My wife
      plans to travel to Yalta in September, and a visit from you would
      please me very much. I've forgotten to let you know that at my
      place there live two little angels in the form of two little girls
      with whom you will soon fall in love, exactly as Dineson did.  He
      also made Mr. Frischmann [David Frischmann] also fall from afar
      (all the way from Warsaw).

(From _Fun Zhargon tsu Yidish_, by S. Dubnov, Vilna: Kletskin, 1929, p.66.)

The book by Dubnov provides insight into this historian's assessment of
the historical background and current status of Yiddish in 1929.
