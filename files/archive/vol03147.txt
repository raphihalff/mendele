Subject:  Scha, schtil...

I thought I'd put in my two guilders' worth regarding the use of
"sch" for "sh":  Anyone who has traveled in the Netherlands or has
heard a bit of Dutch spoken knows that "sch" is NOT pronounced "sh"
in that language, but rather "skh" (to use a YIVO "transcription"
from the Dutch).  I believe (not being a Dutch speaker, myself) that
"sh" is represented by the letters "sj" in Dutch -- the point being
that standards for romanization exist for a reason (one of them
being to avoid excessive confusion -- why use "sch" when "sh"
already does the job perfectly well? I realize, of course, that
there has been discussion in MENDELE regarding the "ay"/"ey"
ambiguity, at least for English-speakers.)

Regarding the use of "ch" in French, at YIVO we have a series
published in Paris which bears the title "Domaine yidich."  However,
these days "Yiddish" is a commonly used spelling in French --
perhaps yet another example of the insidious influence of Franglais
on the language of Voltaire, Racine and Finkielkraut.

Subject: on Schmuck

The German Schmuck of course rhymes with book, not with buch. To
forstall any more such distressing discussing, it should be pointed
out that German Putz, with a vowel like that in book, means finery,
etc., i.e. semantically akin to Schmuck.  It's presumably no problem
to figure a semantic connection with the Yiddish words that resemble
them phonetically.

Subject: Verb-first phrases

Jeremy Stern makes a possible connection between the verb-first
feature, e.g. Omer R. ploni, and its occurrence in talmudic Yiddish.
Why stop with the Talmud?  The verb-first form is ubiqitous in the
Tanakh.  To cite the granddaddy of them all, a sequence of five
consecutive verbs preceding the subject: "...vayo'khal, vayesht,
vayaqam, vayelekh, vayivez Esav et habekhorah. (Gen. 25,34).

Subject: "Mayerson" vs. "Mair"

A number of people indicated their chagrin at my somewhat
insensitive but quite intentional comments concerning the name
changes ofthe founders of the state of Israel.  Of course my comment
was intended to provoke a response. But I don't want it to be
misunderstood to imply my lack of affection and support of Israel.
It primarily reflects may sadness that the creation of a Hebrew
state is leading to the slow demise of the Yiddish culture which I
hold very dear. It is just another example of how the state
sponsorship of one language and culture can lead to the
marginalization of another. In fact if one listens to the Hebrew
used in the American synogogues these days one hears how the Israeli
sponsorship of the Sephardic prononciation is driving out the
Ashkanazic pronunciation used almost univerally in the days of my
youth. I have even heard people in one synogogue say that the
Ashkenazic Hebrew was "incorrect"! Shades of Louis 14!

In the 30's  and 40's it was quite common for American Jews to
anglisize their Jewish family names. The situation became so
egregious that the New Yorker ran a cartoon showing a tomb stone
with the inscription "In memory of our beloved father Haymen Cohn.
Signed: William Mckenna, George Quesne, ...." My family deplored the
shame and self-hate reflected by such behavior. I was therefore
equally pained to see similar behavior by the Israeli leadership. I
always felt that a far stronger blow against ubiquitous antisemitism
would have struck by having the world leaders have to accept as
equals the ghetto Jew a Dovid Grinboym (whatever the spelling) than
the sanitized Israeli Dovid Ben Gurion for whom they have no
preformed biased image. Now the goyim still can retain their
schizophrenic dicotomy between "their" Jews, Grinboyn, et.al. and
exotic Israelis about whom they have no prior mental associations.
Hence my comment re Mayerson used to be a Jew but then she became
Mair the Israeli. Fortunately in our hearts she always remained
Golda.

Subject: Videramol sissel bread

In Vol3.044, Bob Hoberman put to rest the vexing problem of
"sissel/sissle" bread, showing once and for all that it was
what the rest of the world calls "corn" or "corn rye" bread.

The description of how it's made might have daunted some
Mendelniks who enjoy baking but don't enjoy working with
super-sticky doughs.  No longer.  In "Secrets of a Jewish
Baker" by George Greenstein (The Crossing Press, 1993) there
is a recipe adapted for heavy-duty dough-mixing machines.
Reports solicited.

The author also has what looks like an authentic recipe for
sour rye bread.  Why "authentic"?  Because it contains a
substance I never heard of before.  He spells it "altus".
What is "altus"?  A mash made from leftover bread.  Might
this in nusach YIVO be called "altes"?

The sissel story has its comic elements; at least we like to play
it that way.  But it's a sad story as well.  Sholem Aleichem, in
"Vos iz Khanuke?", saw it.  So does the old hasidic story of the
song whose words and later melody are forgotten.
