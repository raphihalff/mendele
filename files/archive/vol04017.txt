Subject: Yiddish comics

It may be of some interest to you, that Will Eisner, the author of the
yiddish comic strip "An Opmakh mit Got", was awarded the famous Max &
Moritz Prize at the 6. International Comic Saloon 1994 in Erlangen for
his life-long work in the field of comics.

Born in 1917 in New York, he is a first generation child of jewish
immigrants from Europe (father from Vienna, mother from Romania). In his
comic stories he was always concerned about the little everyday dramas of
the "every-day people". This gender of comics became famous under the
expression "graphic novel".

Today, Will Eisner is 77 years old and still full of energy, working on a
three volume comic novel to be published soon.

Subject: Re: Yiddish/Jewish comics II

That was a fine summary of Yiddish/Jewish comics, but I think you left
out the main one: Art Spiegelman's Pulitzer prize-winning comicbooks,
_Maus_ and _Maus II_. Prior to publication of the entire "Maus" story in
book form, the strips were included in early issues of "RAW", the arty
comics magazine produced by Spiegelman and Francoise Sagan(?). The Jewish
content of "Maus" exceeded that of "Superman" or "MAD", and the writing
was, as noted above, recognized by the Pulitzer prize committee (the only
other comic strip so noted was "Doonesbury", which occasionally features
Mark Slackmeyer).

Subject: Yiddish/Jewish Comics

Just a note to introduce myself to Mendeleniks and add a comment or two
to the discussion of Yiddish/Jewish comics. Ikh hays Itzik (Jason) Payne
and I'm beginning a Master's program in Yiddish this fall at Ohio State.

That said, on to the comics. To correct a note from Mr. Sapoznik, the
Golem character appeared in the series "The Invaders," a book featuring a
U.S. mandated team of superheroes -- Captain America, Submariner, Human
Torch -- as they fought the Axis across the European theatre. Actually
this incarnation of the golem is rather interesting; the golem and its
creator, a Polish religious scholar, possess a collective consciousness.
As comics go, its a good read. I'd like to chime in as well on Jewish
presence in the comics field. While Siegel and Shuster gave us Superman,
it was Stan Lee (nee Stanley Lieber) who created most of the popular
characters for the Marvel Comics line. Amongst his creations are the
golem-knockoff from the Fantastic Four, the Thing, and the FF's first
super-villain, the Mole Man (a character slight in stature and possessing
a king-size schnozz, both of which cause his ostracization from society).
Most interesting is Lee's character Magneto, an eastern European
Holocaust survivor who channels his rage and trauma into an attempt to
make the world safe for his kind, the mutants. There is some critical
work out there examining the X-Men as a parable for Jews in society. I
hope this stimulates some interest for readers, even though it's less
about Yiddish and more about superheroes.

Subject: German "nachts"

Mikhl Herzog asks (Mendele Vol. 4.105) :

> Question: Is there any apparent basis for the "nakhtS" form in German?
> Any reason to think that this construction may have required a genitive?

In German, "Nacht", a feminine noun, would not form the genitive with -s.
Many temporal adverbs are derived from the genitive, e.g. "morgens",
"abends", "montags".  The genitive derivation can be seen pretty clearly
in certain adverbial phrases that have not achieved independent
"wordhood", e.g. "eines Tages", gen. of "ein Tag", meaning "one day" or
"some day" in the sense of "One day I'll fix that leaky faucet".  I can
only guess that the Germans one day started turning the genitives of
certain masculine temporal nouns into adverbs and kept doing it so long
that they ceased to see the connection to gender, at which point they
could start saying "nachts" without feeling funny about it.

i'm not sure what m. herzog's question is -- but it is my understanding
that not only does gm. nachts derive from a genitive form: so does
english "(he works) nights"!

Subject: Tax Farmer?

Ok.. I'll admit my ignorance: a Mr. Mullish wants to know if his friend's
(a Mr. Baltaxe) claim to a member of the rabbinic court on the basis of
his last name (Baltaxe) is true. The answer given is, no, Baltaxe means
"tax farmer.' So..tell me,  what is a tax farmer?  In English, pulleze!
Another frage: Why didn't  Mullish take  Baltaxe's word for it in the
first place?

Subject: eynikl

I have long believed that "eynikl" (grandchild) is related to "eyn",
"eyner", "eyn-un-eyntsik" etc., and so expresses the singularity of the
relationship. When I became a grandfather for the first time, this seemed
entirely appropriate.  But now I have three eyniklekh--the end is not
yet--and I wonder whether the etymology I've assumed is correct.  Is
"eynikl" *not* related to "eyn" after all?
