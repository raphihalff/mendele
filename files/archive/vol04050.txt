Subject: YIVO archives

I recently returned from a visit to Vilna (and other cities in Byelorus
and Ukraine), and as I understand it from brief conversations with Jewish
museum people and guides there, the re-discovered YIVO archive is
available for consultation, but it is considered the property of the
Lithuanian state, not YIVO or any other Jewish institution.  As Rachile
Kostanian of the Jewish Museum commented to me, "With independence we
have more of everything--more democracy, more money, more crime, more
freedom, more anti-semitism...."

Subject: YIVO archives in Vilna

In October 1991 I attended a meeting, (perhaps the first meeting) of the
Society of Lithuanian Jewish Professionals in Vilna.  At that meeting
the discovery of the YIVO materials was discussed.  A Jewish employee of
the State Library (or Academy of Sciences?), who is "now" [Oct '91]
responsible for the collection, was asking for support from fellow Jews
for cataloguing the material, which contained many surprising things (he
mentioned a letter from Albert Einstein!).  Jews in the West tend to
think only of "rescuing" Judaica from Eastern Europe, when de facto it
means stripping the remaining Jews of the few treasures they have left.
The Jewish community here should offer help in cataloguing, preserving,
and using the materials, on the spot in Vilna, where there are still a
few thousand proud Yiddish-speaking Litvishe Jews.

(With regard to rescuing Judaica, when I was in Vilna in '81 for 4
months, two torah scrolls were stolen from the Synagogue, and the poor
congregants had to pay 800 rubles for a scroll being kept by someone in
Vitebsk.  I learned that these scrolls were being stolen by opportunistic
thieves, exported in third-world diplomatic pouches, and sold for
thousands to Reform temples in places like Long Island, in guise of
"rescuing" Eastern European torah scrolls.  How sad...

Subject: Questions about YIVO

Responding to Gaston L. Schmir's request (MENDELE 4.048), (1) So far,
YIVO's efforts to recover or microfilm those portions of its archives
that have been found in present-day Vilnius have not been successful.
Negotiations with Lithuanian archival and library authorities have led on
more than one occasion to signed, but not implemented agreements.  We
hope to have more positive news to report in the not-too-distant future.

(2) The last issue of Yidishe shprakh to appear was indeed vol. 38, no.
1/3 (1984/86).  I have not heard of any plans to resume publication.  The
editor of that volume (and those immediately preceding it) was Dr.
Mordkhe Schaechter, who can be contacted at the League for Yiddish (200
West 72nd St., New York, NY 10023).

The YIVO Library and Archives closed to the public on July 1st. Over the
next three months we will be inventorying, packing and moving our
collections to two interim sites:  (a) an office space at 555 West 57th
St. (which will also accommodate about 50% of our library and archival
collections) and (b) a nearby warehouse (where the remainder of our
collections will be stored).  Our telephone number (212-535-6700) and my
e-mail address will remain the same.  In about two years, we expect to
move to a site on West 16th St., together with other Jewish research and
cultural organizations.  Meanwhile, we expect to reopen soon after the
High Holy Days, on a somewhat reduced scale.  Please stay tuned.

Subject: Yiddish language sports writing

With the World Cup of Soccer in full swing, I've been wondering if
Yiddish has been used to describe soccer games. I'm interested in all
sports, baseball especially, but here, because of its greater
international expanse, would like to find any writings in Yiddish about
soccer. Concomittant with this, while looking in the index of Kyle Rote
Jr.s COMPLETE BOOK OF SOCCER, I see references to a soccer club New York
Hakoah (I've guessed, but could be wrong that this is from the Hebrew for
strength, ha-koakh) winning amateur soccer titles in the USA in the
1950s, as well as the Los Angeles Maccabees winning in the l970s. While
this may not directly touch on Yiddish (I beleive Hakoah originates in
Vienna and must have had numerous Yiddish speaking followers) I would
appreciate any references you have on these and other Jewish soccer clubs
outside of Israel.

Subject: Jokes about Yiddish

The following joke on Yiddish in Israel, was reportedly common among
Iraqi olim in the maabarot (immigrant absorption sites) in early 1950s:

     Two Jews from Iraq meet one evening and chat in Iraqi Arabic about
     where each one was being sent. "Hezkel, where are you going?" asked
     the first. Hezkel answered, "To ulpan." -- "To what ulpan?" -- "An
     ulpan for Hebrew." -- "Why study Hebrew, learn Yiddish straight
     off."

This is wryly told by Prof. Sasson Somekh of Tel Aviv Univ, (whose field
I think is sociology of multiculturalism and education). Somech explains
that the Eastern olim felt that the Jewish Agency clerks (Polish or
Rumanian) used Yiddish against them. (The Iraqis of 1950s were the most
educated aliyah after the yekkes of 1930s.)

[The above I take from Yosef Algazi, "We did not inform on one another"
*HaAretz*, 24.6.94, p. B6, a review on a new book on Iraqi Jewish
communists.]

(For the wider picture of misperceptions of Yiddish in Israel, there's
the history by Arye Pilovsky, *Zvishn yo un nayn*, Tel Aviv, 1985.) -

Subject: Skongale

In my grandfather's zikhroines, he tells of going swimming in a place
near his home in Keidan (Lite) which he calls "tife Skongale". I thought
this was a local place name, except he also seems to be referring to the
Neviashe river, which flows by the town. I can't locate the term
"skongale" in Yiddish, Russian or Lithuanian dictionaries, but perhaps
I'm missing something. Does it sound familiar to anyone?

Subject: A Shimilekhl: Vos iz?

Kh'hob geleyent di artikl fun Yude Rozof in "Mendele 4.048", un er hot
gezogt vegn di verter fun Brooklyn "to make a shimilekhl." Mayn mame, ver
iz geboyren in Brooklyn in 1940, dertseylt vegn di dozike verter oykh. Di
kinder hobn gezungen:

    "Make a shimilekhl in the old man's back"

(Ikh veys nit ale verter af Yidish...) And when they sang the words "Make
a shimilekhl" they drew a circle with their finger on their friends'
back. At the word "back", they poked the friend's back, in the center of
the circle, with their finger.

I have asked my mother, who does not speak any Yiddish, what a
"shimilekhl" is, or what the whole phrase means, and she cannot give me
an answer.

Efsher ken Yude Rozof, oder an ander mensh, dertseyln vos iz a
"shimilekhl", vos zaynen di verter, un azoy vayter.
