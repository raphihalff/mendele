Subject: re FORVERTS

I'm abashed to say that I had know that the FORVERTS had gone into
English lang uage publication, though I seem vaguely to have read
about it somewhere, the ne w york times?  Anyhow, I should be
grateful for the editorial mailing address, tel or FAX, all of them,
please; editorial management, ed-in-chief, literary editor, etc.

Subject: philologos

As Hillel Halkin's sister, I've been following with great interest
the lengthy discussions re the identity of Philologus. At a couple
of points my mother (Hillel's, as well) has been cited as the source
of the Philologus = Hillel hypothesis. I'd like to state, for the
benefit of anyone interested, that my mother has been dead for over
ten years, and that unless there are Mendelniks who are active
participants in seances, she could hardly be the source for any
information at all concerning Philologus.

Subject: lernbukh/bikhl

Regarding Shloyme Axelrod's question, I checked with my wife, who
was heavily involved in the editing of Yiddish II  (I couldn't
access Dr. Schaechter right away).  She tells me that the original
version was not supposed to be important enough/big enough to be a
lernbukh, so it started out as a lernbikhl, even though it turned
out to be big enough to qualify as a lernbukh.  The new edition, is
certainly @vazhne@ enough to be called a lernbukh, and so it is.
(In other words, Shloyme's guess regarding the bukh/bikhl
distinction was confirmed to be correct.)

(I will check directly with Dr. Schaechter when I get the
opportunity, but I will forbear posting his reply unless its
different from the above.)

Subject:  MENDELE on Gopher

Though neither the Shammes nor I (the titular on-site "owner") know
how this happened, back issues of MENDELE, up to Vol. 3.46, are
available on GOPHER. I myself stumbled on it by asking the VERONICA
search at the University of Nevada at Reno to find "Yiddish." As
often with GOPHER, one doesn't know whence the files are coming, but
I *think* it's from cic.net, wherever that may be. If the
lamed-vovnik(e) who put them there would identify him/herself, we
will express public or private gratitude, as s/he prefers.

If "GOPHER" means nothing to you, inquire of your local computer
authorities. It's an extremely convenient system, far easier than
FTP.

Subject: eppes, khale, lox ... etc.

After a month in Europe I returned to catch up on Mendele and found
a great number of fascinating items to read, from the discussions
about Philologos and Wexler's speculations to the Slobodjanskyj
case.  Our library doesn't have Lingua Franca so I couldn't find the
story.  I must say that in the sociological field, writing a review
under a false or assumed name would be considered ethically
unacceptable, and reviewing your own work as part of this even
further beyond the pale.  A literary nom de plume is one thing in
literature, or even in politics, where no unethical deception is
involved but the "open norms" of science demand public
accountabilty.  We have a specialized journal of reviews and it is
edited as any other journal.

'eppes': part of my time was spent in Switzerland, based in Basel
with trips to central Switzerland.  My friend/colleague, a native
Schweitzer- Deutsch speaker from the heartland of Switzerland,
assures me that 'eppes' as equivalent to 'etwas' is common
throughout Switzerland and suggests it is also found in Swabian
German.

'khale': on Saturday morning in Basel my friend brought a braided
Khale from the local corner bakery for our morning coffee and bread
and jam. It was in part for me and he said it was a special
"weekend" bread; he since has told me that it is common in
Switzerland and is called a "zopf" which generally refers to a
braid, as in braided hair, or a tip of something which is braided.
His family ran a mill and bakery in the past in a small town near
Lucerne; he said that since "times have been better" the "zopf" is
sometimes baked a few times a week as a kind of special or "luxury"
bread, but generally just on the weekend.  Is this a case of
something "borrowed" from Jews (not any to be found in his home
town) and generalized in Switzerland, or the other way around or
.... ? In any case, the braided, long Khale tasted like a real Khale
from the Jewish bakeries of my youth.

'lox': I meant to note that in Sweden and Scandanavia generally,
'lox' is just salmon; special kinds have special names, i.e., grav
lox, made by curing the salmon between boards in the sun; it looks
grayish. 'Smoked salmon" which is not the lox of Jewish bagel/cream
cheese fame, i.e., chunks or sides of salmon that have been cured,
is sold regularly in the US as "smoked salmon" so that US usage
seems to have followed Jewish lox which I assume was borrowed from
Scandanvians or Germans. In Munich in the Nordsee chain of fish
stores found in most local markets, a "lox sandwich" is thin-sliced
"lahks" as in any Jewish US store, but on various rye or wheat rolls
with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc., but no cream cheese.  Very
popular with Weissbeer! But you can also buy lox (i.e., fresh
salmon) steaks for broiling.

Munich Jewish Museum: Anyone visiting Munich should stop by the
small Jewish Museum (two small rooms two flights up at
Maximillianstr. 36; corner of Thomas Winner Ring) just across the
way from the famous Voelkerkunde [anthropological] Museum, and just
a few blocks down the street from the National Theatre and State
Opera house).  It is run by Richard Grimm who is an art dealer and a
non-Jew who has created this on his own as part of an effort to prod
the local city to assume some responsibility for the history of
Munich's small Jewish community.  Begun in 1989, he mounts various
exhibitions in cooperation with other museums and Jewish groups.
While I was there he had a fine exhibition of photographs of the
Synagogues of the Venice Ghetto.  The next exhibition is entitled
"Juedische Zeremonien Kupferstiche von Bernard Picart (1673-1733)"
to be mounted this month till winter.  He has a small collection of
Jewish art objects including pages from a French book of the 18th
century depicting Jewish life and customs, (described as engravings
by an 18th century artist, Martin Engelbrecht.)  I was there on a
non-open day and managed to see him by chance.  While the museum is
now listed in the city's official tourist maps, they give no
information of the exact address or times it is open. Hours are Tu
and We 2-6 and Th 2-8.  Stories appeared in Art News (Oct '92),
Allgemeine-Juedische Wochenzeitung (6 Aug '92) and in Die Zeit (2
Jul '93).
