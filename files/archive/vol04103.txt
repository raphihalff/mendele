Subject: Introduction

I'm a retired university of california librarian with a love of yiddish.
Being a sephardic jew, my mame-loshen was ladino rather than yiddish but
having read yiddish literature at first in english translation, I became
so entranced with it that I studied the language for a number of years. I
have read, with the indispensable help of Harkavy, a fair amount of
yiddish literature in the original, including my favorite of all, Ansky's
The Dybbuk.

Subject: German spin on "Bay mir bistu sheyn"

This is just a side note on the discussion of the song "Bay mir bistu
sheyn." In the early 1970s, while I was studying & working in Europe, a
German informant in her mid-20s told me the following, prompted by my
asking how it was that she was familiar with this song:   She claimed
that the song was "really"  "Bei mir bist Du schoen", and that the song
had to do with American (male) military personnel stationed in Germany,
singing to/about German women they were meeting there.  The pronunciation
sheyn ([ej]), and not [oe] (i.e., the mid, front-rounded vowel) had to do
with Americans' inability to pronounce front-rounded vowels.  According
to the informant, there was no Jewish and/or Yiddish connection to this
song. Thus, she explained, even when German performers--who presumably
"could" pronounce [oe] "if they wanted to"--would preserve the "imperfect
German" of the Americans when performing this song.

"Danke scheyn".

My copy of Haravay is the 1893 edition reprint with a foreword dated
January 1910.It not only contains male and female names but also place
names and Latin,French,and Italian phrases translated into Yiddish.Could
someone advise me as to what institution could get the most benefit from
inheriting my copy of Harkavy? Its in good condition and has a new libray

Subject: The Power of a Name

In a recent issue of _Verbatim_ I read a touching passage, and wish to
share it with members of the Mendele family.

It was written by _Marc A. Schindler_, from Spruce Grove, Alberta,
Canada:

I bought the book _Schindler's List_in a bookstore at New York's La
Guardia airport, and paid for it with my credit card.

When the clerk saw my name on the card, her eyes widened.  "Mr.
Schindler, please--let me shake your hand."  I was very embarrassed...  I
protested that I was no relation to Oskar Schindler, but this did not
seem to make any difference to her. "I'm Jewish," she explained, "and
it's enough for me to touch the name."

Subject: The final word on Bing Crosby

BTW, under the heading of "We Should Claim Der Bingle Naivete,"
I noticed that _Invention and Technology_ magazine, a GM advertising
rag, quite matter-of-factly referred to Bing Crosby as "Der Bingle"
(fall '94 issue, p. 59).  Seems that the editors assume everyone already
knows this one.

Ale mentshn arum Mark Tveyn in zal vern oykh tsehitst un tserudert.  Ober

Anyone, out there, don't hesitate to correct transliteration or Yiddish
usage.  I can take it.  I don't mind learning.
