Subject: Hefker petrishke

In Yiddish as well as in Russian, Polish, Ukrainian, etc., _petrushka_ is
parsley and _pasternak_ is parsnips, but since the roots of the two
plants are similar, parsnips are sometimes thought to be the root of the
parsley plant (folk botany?).

In vol. 14, no. 3 of _Yidishe shprakh_ (July-Sept. 1954), pp. 92-3, Alef
Katz suggests that the expression _hefker petrishke_ comes from the world
of the _beys-medresh_.  He cites a passage from the mishnah Sheviis 9,
which lists various fruits and vegetables that are not subject to a tithe
(_meyser_) and suggests that someone joked about parsley being a bargain
since it grows wild (_hefker_) and is tax-free:  _hefker petrishke!_  The
joke, he suggests, spread, and eventually the expression took on two
meanings: 'worthless' (cf. _s'iz vert a petrishke_, cited by Harkavy) and
'free, out of control.'

Mottel Lakin. I've known nothing about "Punch and Judy" but "hefker
pyetrishke" was always, well, "hefker pyetreshke", having something to do
with wild parsley, I thought. The Jewish family name Petrushka is a
prominent one in Montreal, by the way. Petrushka translated the Mishna
into Yiddish.

As for 'parsnips', another prominent family name, Pasternak.

Subject: Groyser verterbukk

In response to Ruben Frankenstein's timely question:

Some history: The verterbukh project was conducted first under the aegis
of the City College of CUNY, then at the City College in conjunction with
the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (for a while in conjunction with
Columbia University), and in the last phase of its activity, at Columbia
University and the Hebrew University, with the cooperation of YIVO. An
Editorial Board of linguists and literary specialists in the US and
Israel oversaw the effort.

Volumes 1-4 (covering the letter "alef") were published. The "beyz"
entries for volume 5, and some selected entries for several later volumes
are available in a partially edited manuscript and on disk. In addition,
innumerable (would you believe a million?) hand-written 3 x 5
"tsetelekh", with citations from the literature, for words with "giml" to
"tof", are stored in filing cabinets.

Copies of all the materials are housed both at the Hebrew University and
at Columbia. Some are also housed at YIVO.

The multi-dimensional problem:

i) Funding. The project entered a "dormant" phase when funding was
terminated in 1988. The termination of, largely US government, support
came when progress over a period of time was deemed to have been
inadequate. In large measure, the inadequacy was the result of unresolved
computerization problems.

I am not sufficiently well-versed in high-tech matters to be able to make
these problems explicit myself but, I do know that if the project were to
be resumed today, the problems would no longer be as formidable, and that
help in resolving them would be forthcoming from previously unforseen
quarters.

ii) "Tofasto merubo lo tofasto". The _scope_ of the dictionary, as
originally projected, was to include _all_ of Yiddish from its earliest
(13th century?) records to the present day. Whether or not this was ever
a realistic goal, it was evident to most of us engaged in the effort that
we were probably insufficiently qualified to deal with pre-18th century
materials.

After 1988, an alternate scenario, proposed by the Editorial Board, was
to restrict the corpus to the "modern" (post-18th century) period, in the
event that the project was resumed.

Still another possibility, now under investigation, is that it is
possible to assemble quite a separate team of people especially qualified
to work on pre-18th century materials.

iii) Personnel. If funding were available to resume the project, there is
good reason to think that the US, Israel, and Europe could still provide
an adequate number of qualified lexicographic and editorial personnel, in
addition to an advisory Editorial Board, to bring the effort to a
successful conclusion.

The paradox: No new funding can possibly become available before a fully
qualified and committed lexicographic and editorial staff is demonstrably
available, including an Editor-in-Chief and editorial associates,
together with the FULL support of an appropriate institution and all that
that implies. The latter is a sine qua non.

Where do we stand?  Although interest in resuming the project has
recently been expressed in new quarters, it would be premature to provide
any details about these overtures before the Editorial Board of the
Dictionary and its institutional partners have been satisfied that the
conditions described in the preceding paragraph can actually be met.

Is there anyone else out there who would like to try to meet them? All
offers considered!
