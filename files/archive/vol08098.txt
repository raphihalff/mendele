Subject: non-Jewish use of Yiddish

I was wondering what Mendelyaner might know about the non-Jewish use of
Yiddish in the years before the World War II.  In some Yiddish fiction from
that time, you see non-Jewish characters presented as speaking Yiddish, with
various degrees of competence, and I was interested in knowing what the
situation was in the real world, either the eastern European or the
American;  I also wondered whether anyone knew of Yiddish texts _written_ by
non-Jews during that same period.
        
Thanks in advance, 
Larry Rosenwald

Subject: Yiddish word "Choizek"

I am new to this list and hope that am conforming to desired etiquette.  
Can anybody enlighten me as to the etymolgy of the Yiddish word "Choizek",
meaning derision. In Hebrew it means strength.

Subject: A glezl tsimes?

Just a fanciful bit of Yiddish-derived culture to entertain my fellow
Mendeleyaner after the umpteenth posting about the rashly proclaimed death
of Yiddish.  While surfing the web, I came across a bizarre bit of applied
Polish Yiddish.  At http://www.polmos.com/cymes.html, there is a web page
from the Polmos Vodka company in Poland dedicated to their recent creation
"Cymes Vodka."  For those unfamiliar with Polish, "cymes"  is the Polish
spelling of the Yiddish "tsimes."  As if that weren't strange enough, the
web page recommends a rather strong recipe for a screwdriver (vodka and
orange juice) that they call a "Szajgec Cocktail."  "Szajgec" is the Polish
spelling of the Yiddish "shaygets" -- Polish Yiddish pronunciation of
"sheygets."  Combined with the picture of a grinning Jew, complete with
shtrayml and talis, the whole thing leaves a strange taste in my mouth, but
I'm still too amused by the absurdity of such a product to dwell on the
possible tone of patronizing anti-Semitism. 

So now you know.  Fun vanen kumen shkotsim?  Fun a tsimes!  Dos lebn iz
komish, neyn?

Sema Chaimovitch Menora asks if there is a Yiddish word for a "walker", the
device used by older or disabled people.  My Mom calls it her "kadilak".

Subject: Yiddish erotica

Harvey Varga wonders about Yiddish words for sex.  A number of years ago, I
came across a book in the humor section entitled "Worlds Best Yiddish Dirty
Jokes."  The format of the book was that each joke was told mostly in
English, except that the punchline was given in Yiddish, and then in English
translation.  As such, I did pick up a few such words.  I already knew words
like "putz" or "schmuck" for example.  I did learn "kurve" for prostitute
and "trenen" for the sex act.  There's also "shtup." 

I think part of the problem is that the Weinreich dictionary is very
prudish, leaving out any vulgarisms.  It doesn't even include well-known
words like "tuches."  I have a Victorian-era Harkavy dictionary from my
grandparents which is more candid.

Subject: Yiddish erotica

In reply to Harvey Varga's plea (08.095):

1. Start with the supplement to Ignaz Bernshtein's _Yidishe shprikhverter 
un redensartn_ (1908): "Erotica un Rustica".

2. Gain access to Mordke Schaechter's reputedly unsurpassed card file.

Subject: Yiddish erotica 

Reply to Harvey Varga on off colour Yiddish

About ten years ago while teaching a course in Yiddish literature and
culture to some senior adults in Albany New York we set about collecting
-sheltn un bentshn- in Yiddish. Needless to say, sheltn was much more
popular and it was amazing to see how the years disappeared and the blushes
came as we began to explore the various ways of saying things that one
doesn't say. One of the things I discovered is that for much of what has to
do with what used to be known as the fairer sex, food words were used as
euphemisms. I would also suggest that you not rely on a written
questionnaire but oral interviews - because of the nature of the subject
matter the terms may not lie at the surface of one's memory. One of my
favorite ones way. Bay im iz simkes toyre in kop un yom kiper ergets
andersh. 

Good luck.

Subject: a curious locution

There is a curious locution with the verb 'hobn':

ikh hob im in bud; and also (less derisive, sharper): ikh hob im in d'rerd.

We have scoured our memories, and Stutchkoff's Thesaurus for similar usages
of 'hobn', and turned up little.  For example, 'zi hot got in hartz', 'zi
hot rakhmunes in hartz', 'er hot khaloymes in kop' reflect states of mind or
feeling, and do not have the same magical projection of personal possession
upon an object by parking it somewhere pleasingly unpleasant. 

Can Mendelyaners think of similar constructions? 

And, why 'in bud'?  The bathhouse is, unaccountably, the location of the
silly, the stupid, or the fraudulent: e.g. 'gey in bud arayn' dismisses the
flat-earther; or 'er firt im in bud arayn' describes the con man at work. 
Does yidish fiction or historiography bear out this denigration of the
bathhouse?
