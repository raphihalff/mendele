Subject: preglen

Why should there be a Slavic source for preglen, which I am familiar with
in the phrase gepregelte matze (not mentioned so far as I know in
discussions of this tasty dish). In the Muret-Sanders Deutsch-Englisch
dictionary the word bregeln = braten is cited as "mitteldeutsch." Maybe a
germanist should be brought into the discussion.

Subject: Program/book notices

A freylekhn dritn geburtstog, Mendele.

     I note with gratitude that our shames welcomes notices of lectures,
etc. as well as notices of books and articles.  I have had a natural
reluctance to tout my participation.  It seemed too self-serving.
However, I agree such announcements relevant to Yiddish language and
literature are appropriate.  I naturally welcome comments and criticism.
Thank you Noyekh.  Here goes:

     On Sunday, June 5, 1994, 2:30 to 4:30 pm, there will be a program
called Ashkenazic Culture and Music: a Yahrzeit (sic) Commemoration for
Sholem Aleichem.  [Of course, I'd prefer yortsayt to yahrzeit, ober vos
ken men tun?)  It will take place at the Jewish Community Center (JCC) of
Orange County in Costa Mesa, California.  Inquiries may be made to JCC at
(714) 751- 0608.  There will be bilingual readings, brief talks on
history of Yiddish literature, theater, and performances of dances,
music, etc.  I am a participant.

Something else:

     A new anthology on the works of Sholem Aleichem has just been
published:

The Three Great Classic Writers of Modern Yiddish Literature, Volume II.
Selected Works of Sholem-Aleykhem. Ed. Marvin Zuckerman and Marion
Herbst. Malibu, CA: Joseph Simon/Pangloss Press, 1994.

My participation: (1)_A brief psychomedical examination of
Sholem-Aleykhem's untimely death, "Was His Death Too Soon?" (2)_An
analysis of "Place Names and Their Meaning in Sholem- Aleykhem's Work."
(3)_A translation of the first piece for which Rabinowitz used his
pseudonym, Sholem-Aleykhem, "The Election" [Di Vibores, 1883].  (4)_A
translation of the 1887 version of Legboymer.  The 1903 revision is quite
different and rather defanged of its vigorous protest.

Subject: oyvr botl

Funny... I'd never heard the expression until the recent discussion on
Mendele.  Yesterday, in shul, an older gentleman who I'm friendly with
was looking for his coat and hat in the cloakroom.  I asked whether he'd
perhaps not brought them (since it was a warmish day). His reply: "I'm
oyvr botl, but I'm not that far gone!"  (Turned out his coat was in the
next row over from where he was looking.)

Subject: Gershenzon

The only Gershenson/Gershenzon listed in the "Leksikon fun der nayer
yidisher literatur" (vol. 2, col. 327) is M. Gershenzon, and details
about his life and works are sketchy.  The "Leksikon" describes him as a
Soviet Yiddish dramatist, satirist and composer of fables or parables
(mesholim), who was from the Ukraine (no place or date of birth given)
and who belonged to the generation of Yiddish writers that came to
prominence on the eve of World War II.  He was best known for his plays
"Hershele Ostropolyer" (about the legendary Jewish prankster) and "Mayn
zun." He fell at the front in 1944.  Several articles about M. Gershenzon
are listed at the end of the paragraph-long article in the "Leksikon."
His works -- also under the name M. (not Y. or J.) Gershenzon --- are
listed in the bibliography "Jewish Publications in the Soviet Union,
1917-1960," edited by Khone Shmeruk (Jerusalem: 1961), item nos. 1130
(the collection "Heymland," published in Moscow, 1943) and 1447
("Hershele Ostropolyer," published in Kiev, 1939).

From this sparse data it is of course impossible to verify whether or not
M. Gershenzon (J. Gershenson is probably an error) is related to Howard
Gershen.  The geographical distribution of Jewish surnames in the former
Pale of Settlement is documented in Alexander Beider's monumental new
book -- to which I do not have access during the Shevues holiday, alas.

Subject: Information on Eastern European Travel

I am posting this note on behalf of four academic friends, scholars and
roots-seekers, who are now teaching at the Jagiellonian University on
Krakow for a month, and would like to travel after that time to
their bubbe and zayde's villages in Belarus and in the Western Ukraine.
They have asked me to ask you (1) whether anyone knows if reports
regarding the dangers of travel in the Western Ukraine are indeed
true - bandits, thieves, muggings of tourists, etc.; and (2) if
anyone can identify people to contact who may serve as guides and/or
drivers in Belarus, in the areas of Omstibova; Pruzhany; Minsk; and
Grodno.  I thank the participants in Mendele in behalf of my friends
for your assistance.

Subject: query: grine felder

does anyone out there have access to a published english translation of
hirschbein's _grine felder_ and could check something in it for me? a
dank. (if anyone has a published translation of the play into any other
language, that would also be very much appreciated.)

Subject: "Jewish ship" docks in Salonica

I found an article where Bob Hoberman might have found the story of the
"Jewish ship" (really a Spanish ship) docking in Salonica and the
sensation it caused; Dzhudezmo was the native language of about 90% of
the population of the city, and non-Jews simply called it "Jewish" the
way a lot of people here do when referring to Yiddish. The non-Jews had
never been exposed to Spanish, which is very close to Dzhudezmo,and made
the cognitive leap that Dzhudezmo = Jewish; Spanish = Dzhudezmo; ergo,
Spanish = Jewish.

Estrugo, Jose M. "Tradiciones espa~nolas en las juderias del Oriente
Proximo (reminiscencias y apuntes). In: Sefarad. A~no 14, fasc.1 (1954).
It also contains the anecdote I posted about Sephardim joining their
families in Latin America and their puzzlement at being in a country
"where *everybody* talks Jewish".

Subject: I.B. Singer on Yiddish

There is a quiet humor in Yiddish and a gratitude for every day of life,
every crumb of success, each encounter of love... In a figurative way,
Yiddish is the wise and humble language of us all, the idiom of a
frightened and hopeful humanity.

                     Isaac Bashevis Singer, Nobel Lecture, 12/8/78
