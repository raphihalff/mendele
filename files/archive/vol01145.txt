Don't I know it.  I have to work on my kids all the time on
that one, even though they're "native" Yiddish speakers.
But they're in school using English all day, which seems to
affect the Yiddish they use at home with us and with each
other.

An even trickier one is "get".  They (Ariela and Shoshana,
who are almost 8 and almost 6; the two younger ones aren't
old enough yet) know that "get", as in "receive", is
"krign". This has led to things like "Ikh gay krign a lefl
fun shiflud". I come back at them with "Krign krigt men fun
an ander mentsh", which they're finally grasping (and using
on each other!), and switching to using "nemen" instead of
"krign" when the getting is active rather than passive.

There's a more difficult use of "get", however. [Turn on
whining tone] "Far vus krigt zi tsu hobn a tsikerl un nisht
ikh?"  Mistranslation of "get to", meaning, in
youngkidspeak, to get some kind of special treat or favour.
How should I tell them to express this concept?

Which leads me to another vocabulary question: for lack of
a good Yiddish word, my kids use "vatchen" for watch, as
for example if I'm assembling something and they want to
watch me ("kon ikh dikh vatchen?").  Similarly, "vatchn
TV". Any suggestions that don't sound stilted?

Lodzh makes sense -- it's not far from Stashiv, which is my
data point.

Coming at all of this with little knowledge of the academic
writings on Yiddish linguistics, I confess to never having
heard of Prilutski.  Could someone provide an overview of
the main Yiddish language/grammar/linguistic publications
that exist?  For example, I have Weinreich's and Harduf's
dictionaries, and I've seen the Oytser der Yidisher
Shprakh, though never read or used it.  Are Yidish
filologye and Yidish far ale scholarly periodicals in &
about Yiddish?

(I'm probably opening a big can of worms here... I'm sure
Mikhl Herzog's Yiddish-language-academics library is
probably as large as my Canadian tax law library.  I just
have no idea of the range of what's out there.)

And, tied in to the above, are there any publications
people would recommend for people in our position, who are
raising kids in Yiddish only (and starting to need more and
more vocabulary, as the kids grow)?  So far we've pretty
much used Weinreich and my in-laws.  Oh, and Mordkhe
Shaechter's neat little verterbukh on "Trogn, hobn un
fri'ike kinder-yorn". Anything I should try and get from
the NYBC?

My feeling is that bal and bar may only be used with nouns
and they imply a certain amount of possession vis-a-vis the
noun.  This would fit bal guf, bal agule, bal shem tov,
balebos, etc;   There are other cases, such as bar plugte
or bar mitzve or bal khoyv where the relationship is not
directly possession, but even there the connection seems to
be implied immediately by the noun.  Thus bar mitzve is not
one who has a lot of mitzves (under his belt) but he is one
who is metzuve, bal khoyv can stand for the creditor or the
debtor, and bar plugte is a disputant
(plugte=dispute,argument). With bar oyfes, I can
immediately see bird keeper, but bird watcher seems
farfetched.  Perhaps mistakel oyf (on the pattern of mokher
sforim?).  Even if it is a direct translation (almost) of
bird watching, being from Hebrew would 1) give it the tang
you want and 2) mark it as a non-conventional use of
'looking at birds'.
