Subject: information about Inzikh photo sought

There are at least two versions of a group photo of Inzikh writers located
in the YIVO archives (Groups 120, ca. 1923). One version of the photo
appeared in the Harshavs' American Yiddish Poetry (University of California
Press, 1986). Included in the picture are Glatshteyn, Leyeles, Minkov,
Stoldoski, Alkvit, Dropkin, and Likht. Because I am intending to use a
version of this photo in my forthcoming book (same people, different
seating arrangement), I need to find out, if I can:  who took the picture?
Or: how would I contact the estates of the writers involved to get
permission to use their image in my book? If anyone familiar with this
picture has relevant information, I'd greatly appreciate receiving it. (I
already have contacts for estates of Likht and Glatshteyn, but would need
them for the other poets).

Please send information to me at batshira@earthlink.net. Because of my high
spam filter, you may get a message saying that you need to identify your
purpose, but I *will* get your message, and please -- don't be offended! I
want to hear from you, but I am filtering "spam."

Mendeleyners have been very helpful in responding to my previous requests.
I look forward to hearing from you about this photo.

Many, many thanks.
Sincerely,

Malke Bachman

Subject: Book on I.B. Singer

I came across an unusual title today, one which I can't find in any of the
local library databases, nor can I find reviews of it by googling.  So, I'm
wondering if any of you are familiar with it or have any thoughts about
whether it is worth pursuing.

Here is the publisher's description:

Qiao, Guo Qiang The Jewishness of Isaac Bashevis Singer Oxford, Bern,
Berlin, Bruxelles, Frankfurt/M., New York, Wien, 2003. 272 pp. ISBN
978-3-906769-74-5 / US-ISBN 978-0-8204-5911-0 pb. Order online:
www.peterlang.com US-$ 51.95

This book explores Jewishness in the writings of Isaac Bashevis Singer. The
author makes a close examination of Singer's literary works, Judaism,
Jewish history and related criticism to illustrate Singer's unique but
ambiguous position in American Jewish literature. The book offers a
discussion of Singer's modernity. Singer's Jewishness finds its major
expression in challenging the notion of covenant and the concept of the
coming modern consciousness of Spinoza's philosophy. The book also focuses
on Singer's representation of Jewish assimilation in the past and present,
both in Poland and in America, and on the de-Americanization of the
Holocaust.

After an examination of Singer's narrative strategies, the author also
discusses the similarities and diversities of four major American Jewish
writers, Singer, Bellow, Malamud and Roth, in terms of Jewish identity and
Jewish historical consciousness.

Contents: Isaac Bashevis Singer's Ambivalent Modernity Assimilation: An
Ineffable Tribulation; De-Americanization of the Holocaust or Indelible
Shadows on the Jews; Narrating Jewishness - Isaac B. Singer and His Jewish
Contemporaries.

The author, Guo Qiang Qiao, was born in Qingdao, China. He obtained his BA
from Qufu Normal University, his M.A. from Shandong University and his
Ph.D. from the University of Nottingham (UK). He is professor of American
Literature at Shanghai University.


A dank!

Subject: PBS program sought

I know this isn't much to go on, but can anyone tell me the name of a
program that appeared many years ago on PBS television (channels 13 and 21
in New York) in which young people talked enthusiastically about Yiddish
(in English) and sang songs in Yiddish and English?  My memory is that the
program was probably about 1/2 hour.  The only line I remember from it is
"in mayn hertsele", which, when the same song was sung in English, came out
as "in my little heart".  Any leads would be most appreciated.

Subject: "Dos familien kokhbukh"

I am hoping to hear from anyone who has actually referred to, or used "Dos
familien kokhbukh" by H. Braun (Hebrew Publishing Company N.Y. 1914, 1928)-
a Yiddish Cookbook of 400 pages.  More important, does anyone know of the
author H.Braun, a competent nutritionist it seems?  I find no information
anywhere, and would be grateful for help.

A shaynem dank,

Subject:  James Cagney in Yiddish

I once posted a partial transcription of some Yiddish lines that James
Cagney spoke in the 1940 movie "The Fighting 69th."  I say "partial"
because in re-watching the film I see that I missed some of his Yiddish
words.  It was in the scene where a group of World War 1 recruits are in
formation for inspection and Cagney is standing next to a short Jewish
soldier who just finished telling the sergeant that his name is Murphy.

Sergeant:  "Did you say your name is Murphy?"

Jewish Soldier:  "I did your worship; save in your presence."

Sergeant: "What were you born?" Soldier:  "I was born a boy!"

The sergeant walks away in disgust to peals of laughter from the other
soldiers.

Cagney (turning to the soldier next to him):  "Vos veys er!  Er veyst fun
gornisht!"

Soldier: "Vos veyst er - er iz der balebos!"

Cagney:  "Nisht far mayn gelt!"

On re-listening I now hear some rapid-fire Yiddish words that Cagney says
just before he utters "Vos veys er!  Er veyst fun gornisht!"  But no matter
how often I replay that segment I find that my 76 year old ears (and brain)
aren't fast enough to process them.  I'd be grateful to hear from anyone
who was able to make out those lightning-quick words.

Subject: English translation of Peretz' "Mayses"

I am looking for an English translation of the Y. L. Peretz story "Mayses."
It is in volume 4 of the complete works published by Farlag Idish, New
York. Can you help me?

Subject: Sholem Schwartzbard

I'm researching Sholem Schwartzbard, the 1926 assassin of Simon Petliura of
Ukraine pogrom infamy.  I've found info in Dreamland, a bit in the Forward,
a play by Kacyzne, and some from a South Africa Maknovist group. But I've
heard of a poem or song called the Ballad of Sholem Schwartzbard and I
understand he wrote a memoir.  I hope someone can assist me in finding
resources for my study which will result in a song about the hero.

Thanks for your time and interest in this project.
