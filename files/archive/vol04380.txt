Subject: Yiddish exhibition, Toronto

Announcing,

Yiddish panorama: a thousand years of Yiddish language, literature,
and culture: an exhibition at the Robarts Library, University of
Toronto, April 3-May 31, 1995.

A catalogue is being prepared to accompany the exhibition. In order
to get an idea of what size print run I should order, I would like
to see how many people on Mendele would be interested in purchasing
the catalogue. The exhibition surveys Yiddish literature and culture
from the Middle Ages until the present. The catalogue will be about
70 p. long and will include some 30 illustrations. I hope to keep the
price reasonable (between $5 and $10, probably closer to $5)
If you are interested, please send me an e-mail message. When the
catalogue is available I will post instructions for ordering.
