Subject: Menashe Skulnik.

As a youth, I mingled with his daughter, Maya.  I little
understood that I could claim fame on this basis.  The
scene, Greenwich Village, the years 1948-49.  We had
friends in common, spoke together, nothing very exciting,
not even a serious flirt.

Subject: RE: Maurice Schwartz

The fact that Maurice Schwartz is dead explains why he has
been quiet. It reminds me of a story my Bubba, of blessed
memory, told me:  There was a town drunk who was totally
passed out. To play a trick on him, the townsfolk  lay him
an a grave that had been prepared for a burial and
sprinkled a little earth over him.  When he awoke from his
stupor, he saw where he was and screamed, "Oy Gevalt! Ich
bin toit!  Ich bin toit!!" However, upon further
reflection, he said, "Az Ich bin toit, far vus darf Ich
pishen?" She told this story in the context of explaining
how one should not complain about discomfort - sometimes it
is the only way you know you are alive.

Subject: judgements/Mendele intro

     As I have been subscribing to Mendele for a couple of
months now, and as I also have a question (actually three
questions) to ask of those of you who have Yiddish as your
native language, the time may be right for me to introduce
myself.

     I am a Danish linguist working in Stuttgart, and my
main interest is word order variation across the Germanic
languages. I am trying to look at as wide a selection of
languages as possible (i.e. more than English and German).
I am particularly interested in the Scandinavian languages,
i.e. the differences between e.g. Danish, Faroese, and
Icelandic. In this respect Yiddish is extremely relevant,
even if it isn't a Scandinavian language, as Yiddish and
Icelandic have a very high number of properties in common
(which, moreover, are rather unlikely to be the result of
borrowing). I am involved in a long (but interesting)
debate with (among many others) Molly Diesing (Arizona),
Beatrice Santorini (Northwestern) and Hoskuldur Thrainsson
(Harvard) concerning the basic structure of Icelandic and
Yiddish sentences.

     I would like to hear your opinion as to whether it is
possible to have what the Germans call "accusatives with
infinitive" in Yiddish, e.g. "I saw Peter talk to Mary".
Can one say anything like the the following three
(homemade) sentences in Yiddish (either as yes/no-questions
or as declarative clauses in the middle of a narrative) ?

 1  Zet  der yid plutsling den shokhn    kumen (?)
    Sees the man suddenly  the neighbour come

 2  Lozt der yid plutsling den tsigar faln (?)
    Lets the man suddenly  the cigar  fall

 3  Vet der tsigar plutsling faln gelozn (?)
    Is  the cigar suddenly   fall let

   I suggest you mail your opinions directly to me, and
then if there seems to be some general interest, I will be
happy to post a summary of the various answers.

Subject: Nokhamol vegn borsht

I'm sorry to have given the impression that I deplore all
or most Yiddish music.  I don't.  Quite the contrary: I
like or love most of it. On the other hand I have to differ
with Ellen Prince when she distinguishes between schlock
(e.g. The Shteeblehoppers rakhmone-litzlan!) and borsht
belt music as though much of the latter was free of
meretricious junk.  Ah, if that were true!  But alas, while
I was never able to afford to stay in the Catskills I _was_
a waiter in 1940 or 1941 (Sholem Asch was a patron) and
while I remember some good stuff I remember the vulgarity
better.

As for Menashe Skulnik, mostly wonderful.  Ditto for Aaron
Lebedeff, Isa Kramer and Ludwig Satz.  I almost forgot the
unforgettable Pinkhas Burstein.  Quite forgettable on the
other hand was a Yiddish Rudy Vallee named Irving Grossman
whose specialty was kitsch like this:

In der South.
Vo di feyglakh .. zingen
in der South.

Or Jenny Goldstein who wasn't awful but sang:

Ikh bin a mamme
Nor vi iz mayn kind?

Not to mention the time she sang to a tombstone.  The Irish
have no monopoly on Mother Machree.

But kitsch is another matter anyway.  Salmagundi ran a
whole issue about it a couple of years ago with all the
heavy hitters (Irving Howe, Susan Sontag, etc.) and I know
less than I did before.
