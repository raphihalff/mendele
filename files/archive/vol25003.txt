Subject: afn ganef brent dos hitl

In reply to Hershl Bershady’s question [25.002] about his  colleague’s mother, whom he remembers saying "on a thief the hat turns twice as fast", I would suggest that his colleague is slightly misquoting his mother.  She probably said some version of "afn ganef brent dos hitl", "on the thief the hat is burning". Maybe she added "twice as fast" for effect. It’s a familiar saying which Ignatz Bernshteyn, in his 1908 collection Yidishe Shprikhverter un Redensarten explains as follows:

"Af a yarid iz a zakh farloyrn gevorn un men hot nit gevust, ver es hot zi geganvet.  Do hot a vitsling af eynmol a geshrey gebebn: ‘afn ganef brent dos hitl!’  Hot zikh der ganef dershrokn un hot aropgekhapt dos hitl, un dermit hot er zikh gegebn tsu derkenen."    

In other words your guilty conscience will betray you sooner or later.

Subject: af tselokhes

[Due to a faulty link in 25.002, the moderators include these details, by way of Itsik Goldenberg, as an answer to Joyce Tamara’s inquiry.]

In Mendele 25.001, Joyce Tamara asks about a song containing the words "af tselokhes, am yisroel khay." 

It can be found, with the title "Am Yisroel Khay," on Theodore Bikel's recording "SILENT NO MORE," (Jewish Underground Songs from Soviet Russia) released in 1971 on LP.   A very moving recording indeed.

Subject: Redundant direct object

In Di brider ashkenazi, IJ Singer often uses a redundant direct object.  Was this common usage or is it idiosyncratic with Singer?

Ex: Tsuzamen mit der shtot iz gevaksn dos hoyz fun reb avrom hersh ashkenazi, vos me hot im gerufn dantsiker.

Subject: Lebns Fragn

Dear friends of Yiddish and of Lebns Fragn:

Lebns Fragn was the last published bulletin in Yiddish in Israel to appear in print and was closed due to circumstances beyond our power on June 2014. 

We are happy to announce the summer 2015 issue of 

FRAYE LEBNS FRAGN 
(Free Lebns Fragn)

on the digital platform.

In this issue: 
A collection of articles and op-eds covering the period between the war-operation TSUK EITAN in Gaza in the summer of 2014, the Israeli elections which took place in March 2015 and the creation of the new coalition and government thereafter. 

You can read the Fraye Lebns Fragn on 

http://lebnsfragn.com/index.html

We are now collecting  material for our next issue.

Subject: OCR of Sholem Aleichem

Don't be left out! In half a year we have already finished correcting 25% of the OCR of the complete works of Sholem Aleichem. It's easy to help, and it's fun! The computerized tools make it easy to find letters that might be misrecognized. 

Just go to https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.cs.uky.edu_-7Eraphael_yiddish_sholemAleykhem_contents.html&d=AwIBAg&c=-dg2m7zWuuDZ0MUcV7Sdqw&r=hgSCSvtHqNOp40iT6T4uKyOHqvQreUPfVso-KO1Kgto&m=RrKOSsYh9o_afaLEs6dBmO3eQWVhY16mjmafL64MLOE&s=67wp3IXf8zLUs1I3j_gNeEe47ksq2uBp_OKHPiKKDh0&e= , pick a favorite story, and click on "leyent". From there you can click on "redagirt di zayt". Try editing, moving back and forth between the "hilfike eytse" and the original text, making your corrections on the right-hand column. You can "derfrish di eytses" multiple times to account for the changes you have made. The only thing you can't do (until you are registered as an editor) is save the changes. Once you have tried a few pages like this, "shikt a bakoshe tsu vern a redaktor". 

You get these benefits: 

1. The pleasure of reading Sholem Aleichem. 

2. The mitsve of providing an improved text for anyone to search, leading eventually to a new complete edition. 

3. Your name in lights. Well, not in lights, but the "status" page shows exactly what pages each editor has worked on. 

Don't worry if you can't figure something out. You can always ask me (or others), and every edit is reversible or subject to further revision.
