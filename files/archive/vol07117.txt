efsher ken men zukhn in verterbukh fun ladino -- un gefinen nokh bavayzn. 
eykh an ofene frage. 

in the spirit of the words of peace from our leader, i wish to comment on the
word davenen. perhaps our discussion is a very important one, because it is a
word that goes to the essence of the jewish experience. 

let's try to eliminate what we can eliminate and perhaps an answer, or at
least a path to the truth will remain -- one that is logical. 

according to david goldberg's "yidish af yidish (yale 1996) it is asserted
that verbs (participles) of slavic origin, end in eyin tes. one says - ikh hob
gedav(e)nt - nit gedavenet oder gedavnet - so, a slavic origin is out of the
question. 

as to an h/a origin, matters are less clear -- i wonder a little about the
need for all these acrobatic exercises -- when other words of h/a origin are
so much easier to recognize by their 3-letter root or shoresh - in all forms
and changes loshn kodesh and the other goles-languages. 

as to german-dutch and their various forms and dialects - no one has yet
demonstrated a sharp, clear connection. but this is still an open question. 
let us seek further. 

as to latin/italian/french and perhas even spanish/portuguese, even ladino, we
must not forget that jewish populations lived in all these lands, and wandered
from land to land and with them, words dealing with jewish religious life. and
not all these words were h/a words - such as got, bashert, etc.it is therefore
an open question that there is a possibility that words like bentshn and
dav(e)nen actually do derive from romance languages - benedicer and diviner -
go hand in hand. 

another point. the second great exile (of sephardic jewry) begins in 1492.  we
find sephardic names like basson and peretz and others, among ashkenazim.
sephardim came to holland from spain and portugal -- and these same families
later came to the slavic lands. perhaps we can research the ladino lexicon -
and find similar examples. also an open question.

Subject: Purpose of Mendele

I second the motion of Mendy Fliegler.  I, too, was beginning to wonder when
we would get off the etymology track, and get back to posts which would be
more in line with what I had thought was a real purpose of Mendele, namely, to
promote the use and revival of Yiddish.  I would like to see some posts from
those who can tell us what is being done in their area to promote the spread
of Yiddish.  Let's hear of new developments in approach, techniques, and
technological advances which are available for this purpose.

Subject: Chanukah stories

I work part-time in a children's book store, and just saw a new (1997) book by
David Adler, "Chanukah in Chelm."  This new story captures the charm of the
traditional Chelm stories very well; I recommend it highly.

re-constantal droping of g's.  he obviously did not know my elterfeter oyf der

There's another Socialist in the US Congress at present, Bernard Sanders of

Representative Sanders is also Jewish.

Subject: Davenen in Mendele and elsewhere

Mendy Fliegler and several other Mendelyaner complained about "The Great
Davenen Discussion". Although it does seem somewhat pervasive, one should not
blame Mendele: there must be something in the air these days, that causes an
obsessive-compulsive search for the etymology of "davenen".

Look for example at the Philologos' column in the last Forward (Dec 5). It
reads like a synopsis of the discussion in Mendele (without mentioning Mendele
of course). Too bad that Mr (or Ms) Philologos is not subscribed to Mendele,
otherwise they would have included a reference as a professional courtesy.

I also wonder why nobody mentioned a fairly recent article by Herbert Guy
Zeiden "Davenen: A Turkic Etymology" in Yiddish, v. 10, 2-3, p. 96-99 (1996).

And let me finish with an old prophesy by a very wise man: "The origins of
_daven_ and _pareve_ are once again hot items.  As they will be again next
year and the year after." (Noyekh Miller, Mendele Vol 1.086, Thu, 10 Oct 1991).

Subject: Yiddish linguistics vs. Yiddish amateur linguistics

Some people have suggested to me that it might be useful to post a brief
statement of some of the principles I keep alluding to which define the
linguistic approach to Yiddish etymology (and more generally to Yiddish
linguistics) as opposed to the amateur approach.  This is by no means an easy
task, but here goes: 

The fundamental distinction to my mind is that the linguistic approach is
systematic (or systemic), while the amateur approach is atomistic.  That is,
for a linguist an etymology can only be considered in the context of a whole
systematic description of the history of a given language or dialect.  This is
why I keep saying that, for example, deriving dav(e)nen from Hebrew daf Fleaf'
is unacceptable because we know of no examples of Hebrew /f/ becoming Yiddish
/v/ in a comparable situation.  This is why dav(e)nen cannot be derived from
dialectal doynen or medieval do"nen because we know of no comparable examples
of -av- coming from such sources.  This is why I say that dav(e)nen cannot
come from Aramaic d+something, because Yiddish verbs come from Hebrew and not
from Aramaic, and this is why Birnbaum, with whom I agree, also said that a
Turkic or a Lithuanian or an English etymology is impossible or at least
unlikely, because Yiddish does not seem to have many or indeed any old
established words from these sources. This is why I worry myself about how to
explain the variation between davenen and davnen, although this time the
situation is a little different: there MUST be a connection of some kind to
explain this but in the absence of any comparable examples, it is difficult to
be sure what it is.  In each case, what we insist on is that what is claimed
for dav(e)nen should be exemplified elsewhere as well.  This is one way in
which being systematic or systemic differs from being atomistic. 

But we actually go further because we usually insist that what is posited for
the history of any one language or dialect should normally (perhaps there are
exceptions) be paralleled in other languages of the world.  For example, when
we describe the sound changes required to explain the development of a
language or a dialect, we usually want these sound changes to be found
somewhere else in the world.  I am not sure this is relevant in the case of
dav(e)nen, but it is important in general.  For instance, we normally want the
statements of how the sounds of one dialect or language relate to those of a
related one to allow no exceptions (so that EVERY word which has /oy/ in
Northeastern Yiddish, for example, has /ou/ in Dutch Yiddish, if I am not
mistaken, and so on).  The reason we insist on this is not just that this
makes us more confident of the correctness of our statements, but also because
for 150-200 years a huge number of languages and dialects have been studied
and overwhelmingly we find that the sound systems thereof do exhibit this
property, known more technically as the regularity or exceptionlessness of
sound laws.  It is controversial whether this always so or merely most
commonly, but it is certainly common enough for us to be suspicious of any
example that does not have this property.  So it is not merely that we know of
no examples where /av/ comes from /o"/ or /oy/ (or where /v/ comes from /f/,
except perhaps at the end of a word) in Yiddish.  It is also that, since we
have lots of examples where medieval /o"/ gives modern /e/ or /ey/, where
Hebrew /f/ gives Yiddish /f/, and so on (while on the other hand we know that
modern /av/ comes from /av/ and modern /v/ from Hebrew /v/ or medieval German
/v/ or /w/), we assume that it is very very unlikely that there should be an
individual word (namely, dav(e)nen) where these regularities are not observed
(for no apparent reason). 

Much much more can be said about this, and I hope at some point to be able to
post more, but this is the basic point I think: that real linguistics treats
the etymology of any given word (or indeed any fact about a language or a
dialect) as part of the whole enormous body of knowledge about that
language/dialect (and related languages/dialects), whereas amateur linguistics
is atomistic.  And if you will forgive the atrocious pun, anything atomistic
is bound to bomb.

Subject: Y. Dobrushin

I wonder if anyone can supply me with information about Y. Dobrushin, Russian
author, critic and ethnographer.  In particular, I am interested in details
about his collection of Yiddish folk songs, published in Moscow in 1940. 
Also, I would like to know what happened to him during the Stalin years; he
died in 1953.
