Subject: Halperin's "A Nakht"

I have just joined Mendele and am impressed so far.

A bakoshe. I would like to introduce my monthly Jewish (not Yiddish)
Literature group to some Yiddish poetry - in particular I would like to
do "A Nakht" by Moyshe-Leyb Halperin, from his book of poems _In New
York_.

Does anyone know of a translation?

A shaynem dunk. Mit grusn for dort untn (Down under!)

Subject: "Oyfn Pripetchick"

I need the lyrics of additional verses, if any, to this classic Yiddish
song, Oyfn Pripetschick brent a fayerl....  The music is not necessary,
as I have a decent, if imperfect score.  If anyone out there has the
lyrics, could you forward them to me at the above address? I am
performing it for a Yiddish festival, but the lyrics I have seem
incomplete.

A dank,
Warren Winkelman

Subject: "Ober/bloyz dem talis nemt er mit"

Reading a book on Yiddish theater in Berlin before WWI this past Sunday
I happened to come across the text of a song called "Dos talesl" which
might be the one Bernard Katz is referring to. Unfortunately, the text I
have is the version that was handed to the local censorship office--thus
it is more or less translated into German. I assume that someone on this
list will be able to provide the original text, if not I'd be happy to
share this version with you.

Subject: Female cross-dressers on the Yiddish stage

In her summary of Eve Sicular's article on Homosexuality in Yiddish
film, Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan mentions that Sicular proposes that
presenting females disguised as males was an outlet to deal with the
discomfort of acculturation of Jewish immigrants in America.

Molly Picon in Yidl mitn Fidl is of course the best known example of a
woman impersonating a man (or boy).

However, it is important to note that women disguised as men have a long
tradition on the Yiddish vaudeville stage in Europe and were a common
phenomenon at least since the turn of the century. And I believe it was
Berta Kalish who played the role of Hamlet in the first decade of this
century on the "legitimate" Yiddish stage in NY. Thus Picon's role in
Yidl seems to be part of a long-established tradition of Yiddish
theater--a tradition and phenomenon that certainly merits some serious
research.
