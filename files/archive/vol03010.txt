Subject: Introduction

My name is Benjamin Elkins (Baruch) and I live in Dallas, Texas. I
am 28 years old, single (but looking) and work as a Mathematician
for Texas Instruments. I am a PhD candidate in Statistics at
University of Texas (Dallas). I am originally from Savannah, GA and
still have much family there.

Besides speaking, reading, and writing fluent Yiddish, I have
studied Russian for 7 years and also I am a long student of
Esperanto.

During a recent trip to Eastern Europe, I traveled thru Poland to
visit the shtetele where my family is from and many museums. I
looked for and found all (not too much) the Yiddishkeit in Poland.
My Yiddish was invaluable because there is no English in Poland. I
used my Russian, Polish phrase book, and my Yiddish exclusively. Oh
yes, I did use my Esperanto in the Hotel once with the manager!

I welcome all personal notes and correspondences. I am a very good
and reliable e-mailer. I can be found at the following:

Subject: Vyechere; Yiddish literature

My friend David Ebin, who knows little Yiddish but a lot of Russian,
came up with a beautiful suggestion about  "beyze vyechere": the
original Russian word in the phrase must have been NOT vecher
'evening, evening party' but rather veter 'wind', which is
pronounced in Russian with "soft", palatalized v and t, something
like vyetyir.  Then the expresssion, meaning 'evil wind', is a
translation of the familiar Hebrew term ruakh ra'a.  In Hebrew ruakh
means both 'wind' and 'spirit', so if this is all correct then the
original source of the Yiddish expression is a Hebrew one meaning
'evil spirit', translated, who knows why, with a Slavic word for
'wind', reinterpreted in Yiddish as the similar-sounding word for
'dinner'!

On the subject of Yiddish literature: as a few people have commented
recently, it's true, and regretable, that we discuss literature so
much less than language.  In my case, I read the other people's
postings about literature with a great deal of interest.  I haven't
read a lot of Yiddish literature, and what I've read I've read
mostly in English, but recently I'm been very impressed and moved by
much of the 20th century Yiddish poetry collected in the two fairly
recent anthologies.  As it happens, though, I'm a linguist by
profession, and often feel I can make a contribution to discussions
of the language (don't know whether anyone else agrees, but I'll
continue nonetheless), and in most cases don't have anything to add
to discussions of literature.  To those who are knowledgeable about
Yiddish literature: please keep it up, and don't think the rest of
us are ignoring you!

Subject: Literature/fools in Riga

1. Indifferent to literature?

I can assure the troubled Bob Werman that in our leyn kreiz at Yale
we spend >90% of our time reading Yiddish texts of various periods
and genres. Not only is the activity edifying per se, it also keeps
a (loosish) lid on the ideological differences that, if fully
expressed, could require the intervention of the Yale Police and
turn into a veritable shande far di goyim.

2. "Fools" in Riga.

Somebody (I apologize for not remembering who) asked about "naroyim"
as the plural of "nar" in Riga. I tried this out on my Riga-bred
mother, one of Mikhl Herzog's informants for his dialect atlas.
Without, of course, leading the witness, I asked her for the merzal
of "nar." Her first answer was "naroyim," but then "correcting"
herself she produced "naronim."

Subject: idioms

A lebn oyf shleyme akselrod un b. kats far zeyere tsushtayers tsu
der idiomen zamlung.

Some remarks:

1. a beyze v(y)etshere - I think this is used to intensify the
phrase "ikh zol azoy visn fun beyz" which literally means "may I
know as much about evil" but which pragmatically means something
like "beats me!" "you got me", or "don't ask me".  It also occurs as
"ikh zol azoy visn fun shlekhts".  Another way of expressing the
same sentiment is "freg mir b'kheyrem" which implies "even if you
demand that I answer under threat of the ban, I still don't know the
answer".  I have only heard the phrase as part of the expression
"ikh zol azoy visn fun a beyzer vetshere".

2. folg mir a gang - also used to express disinclination to
undertake an effort disproportional to the result.  "The doctor will
be able to see you, but you will have to wait two hours."  "Folg mir
a gang!"

3. a glik iz (we say 'hot') mir getrofn - a (possibly stronger)
variant: a glik hot mikh batrasket.

4. Shleyme's pungent "zikh arumdreyen vi a forts in rosl" is an
intensification of "zikh arumdreyen",  "to wander around aimlessly"
but also "to hang around aimlessly".

5. "dreyen" is at the core of many idioms; for starters, "drey mir
nit keyn kop" or "drey mir nit keyn spodek" 'don't bother, annoy,
pester me' (this applies only to verbal bothering or annoying);
"fardreyen dem kop" 'to bother, confuse'.
