Subject: Introduction

Ich hays Mendl Fliegler. They call me Mendy. I am an engineer retiree
from the Fed. Gov't. But my background in  Yiddish originates when I came
to the US in 1937 from Honduras, my birthplace, when I only spoke Spanish
and Yiddish. Spanish disappeared when I learned English. I was a student
in the Sholem Aleichem Folkshule Drei, while growing up on a poultry farm
in Central New Jersey. Marvelous teachers, Schegloff, Chanukov, etc.,
came from New York and stayed over at various farms and taught the
language, theater, history, poetry, etc., at the community center on
weekends. I graduated at 13. My folks and I, un die schaynim all spoke
Yiddish to each other. A mix of Galitz, Litvakish, some literary, etc.
The farmers were a mix of Linke, Rechte, Refugees, Spinoza-ites,
Dahtchen, Socialists, un zo veiter. Sometimes a Republican!

Yetzt vil ich mit eich redn. Die shprach shpringt arois fin mein

Subject: Introduction

I am thrilled to have finally arrived on Mendele's list. My formal
studies in Yiddish started in 1983 at YIVO's Columbia Univ. summer
program.  Currently I'm studying Yiddish at the University of Maryland
with Dr. Dorothy Bilik, at the DCJCC leyen krayz with Dr. Max Ticktin,
and a small group of lovers of Yiddish.  Adrienne is already on Mendele.
As you can see, Adrienne, I finally made it! My husband, Meyshe, and I
hold a class, Mishpokhe Yiddish, for 3 to 7 year olds, in our home.
Parents and/or grandparents are encouraged to participate.  We present
Yiddish stories, (puppet shows), for children 3 to 93 years young.  "s'is
take a mekhaye." yidn, zayt bagrist.  a gut yom tov.  a gut yor.

Subject: ALA/LC Romanization of Yiddish

There has been some discussion on MENDELE lately, regarding libraries'
practices in Romanizing Yiddish.  Those who are familiar with the YIVO
standard for the Romanization of Yiddish are often startled to see (for
example) "mekhaber" transliterated in library catalogs as "meh.aber," or
"zhargon" as "zshargon."  These spellings are not, however, the caprice
of an ignorant cataloger (though some of us may indeed not know Yiddish
well); rather, they represent the systematic application -- or
occasionally, misapplication -- of what is best known in the trade as
ALA/LC [=American Library Association / Library of Congress] Romanization
of Yiddish.

ALA/LC Romanization is intended to be a *transliteration* (not a
transcription) scheme.  In other words, it represents the letters that
appear on a printed page, and not the sounds with which those letters are
normally associated. Librarians transliterate (rather than transcribe)
Yiddish for bibliographical purposes:  Transliteration ideally should be
"reversible"; when one sees the title "Der yud" in a library catalog it
signals to the researcher that the original spelling is daled-ayin-resh
yud-vov-daled -- even if it is actually pronounced "Der yid."
Transcription has its place, but bibliographical accuracy (one of the
principal raisons d'etre for library catalogs) demands transliteration.

ALA/LC bases its Yiddish transliteration on the YIVO standard, but is far
from identical to it.  That is because Yiddish is treated as a subset of
Hebrew-alphabet transliteration as a whole (just as ALA/LC
transliterations of languages using the Cyrillic or Arabic alphabets
conform to overall rules affecting those alphabets, albeit with
modifications).  In ALA/LC Romanization, each Hebrew letter is
represented by a distinctive symbol, as mandated by the Library of
Congress' "Hebraica Cataloging Manual."   H.es is distinguished from
khof, kaf from k.uf, s'in [accent aigu after "s"] from samekh, s`ov
[accent grave after "s"] from samekh, t.es from tov.  Zayin-shin is
represented by z+sh (zsh), rather than zh.

ALA/LC Romanization of Yiddish works reasonably well from the
transliteration perspective, as long as one avoids Yiddish words deriving
from the language's loshn-koydesh component.  There is a tendency in the
library world to strain toward reversibility, yielding such bizarre
Romanizations as "s'imh.eh" (for simkhe) -- whereas a Hebrew book with
the identically spelled word in its title would have it Romanized
"s'imh.ah," according to current library practices.  ALA/LC Romanization
has been particularly problematic in the area of Hebrew personal names.
Take, for example, the name Rokhl Boymvol.  As long as the author resided
in the former Soviet Union, her first name was spelled
resh-komets-alef-khof-lamed -- and was transliterated Rokhl.  But as soon
as she moved to Israel, her books began to appear under the spelling
resh-h.es-lamed, and her name was transliterated Roh.el. Thus, ALA/LC is
not a pure transliteration scheme, but a mixed,
transliteration/transcription scheme (not a happy situation).

The point of all this is that there IS a method to the madness of ALA/LC
Romanization, even if that system ultimately is a bit of a "plonter."

Subject: Transliteration

My comments are not meant to suggest any alteration in the rules of
transliteration now practiced in Mendele.  I appreciate the logic (see
Zellig Bach in 4.102 for some of the rules), and the benefits of
consistency.  But, an observation:

I learned transliteration from Weinreich's "College Yiddish" and from
Weinreich's English-Yiddish, Yiddish-English dictionary.  There, upper
case letters are used except when a combination of letters was needed to
transliterate a single Hebrew character.  For shin, the transliteration
was Sh.  For a khes or a khof, Kh was used.  J is rendered DZh.  A couple
of examples: To render the Yiddish word meaning "to hear out," the
prescribed transliteration is OYSHERN.  For "to cut out with scissors,"
the transliteration is OYSShERN.  Clarity is served.

This is perhaps a point overfine, but I see another advantage in using
the system used by Weinreich.  In writing in English about Yiddish
literature, italics are often used for quotations in Yiddish.  It has
seemed to me useful to reserve italics for the more familiar uses:
emphasis, foreign languages other than Yiddish, titles, etc.  The upper
case system immediately signals that those passages are Yiddish, not any
_other_ language.  For distinguishing Yiddish quotations (from intermixed
italicized Russian, Ukrainian, Polish or German), a format reserved for
Yiddish might be helpful.

This applies mainly to the printed page.  I don't suggest any alteration
in Mendele (considering custom and the limitations imposed by modem
communication), but my comments do contain a question: Why has an
integral part of the system in Weinreich been abandoned?
