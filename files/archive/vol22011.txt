Subject: "Dray tekhterlekh"

Dear Mendelyaners,

I am currently translating Gebirtig's song "Dray tekhterlekh,, and there are two 
expressions in it that are really difficult to translate, although I know all the words in 
them...
I found a translation in English on the internet but it's not literal, and I'd like to really 
understand the expressions.

The two expressions are:
"vi halt men shoyn bay zey"
about the girls still to marry,
and
"shpilt klezmorim, heybt on shnaydn!"
Why would the klezmorim cut anything?

Here is the whole song:

ven mit mazl, gezunt un lebn
s'eltste tekhterl mir veln oysgebn
vel ikh tantsn mir hop, hop, hop!
arop an ol fun kop
vel ikh tantsn, oy, vel ikh tantsn,
arop an ol fun kop

shpilt klezmorim, shpilt mit lebn
s'ershte tekhterl haynt oysgegebn
nokh geblibn undz meydlekh tsvey
vi halt men shoyn bay zey?
shpilt, klezmorim, oy, nemt di kley-zayen
zol di gantse velt mit undz zikh freyen,
undzer simkhe veyst nor eyn got
un der vos tekhter hot

ven kh'vel zen dos tsveyte meydl
ongeton in vaysn khupe kleydl
vel ikh trinken, a tentsl geyn
arop fun harts a shteyn
vel ikh trinken, oy, vel ikh trinken,
arop fun harts a shteyn

shpilt klezmorim, heybt on shnaydn!
s'tsveyte meydl gibn mir oys in freydn
dos mizinkl geblibn mir,
vi halt men shoyn bay ir?
shpilt klezmorim, far undz mekhutonim
zoln nakhes hobn oykh kabtsonim
a kind oysgegebn, oy, gotenyu
a meydl nokh dertsu

ven baym letstn kh'vel shpiln hern
vel ikh epes troyerik shteyn un klern,
s'letste tekhterl shoyn oykh avek,
un vos iz nokh der tsvek?
oy, s'letste tekhterl, oy, s'letste tekhterl,
un vos iz nokh der tsvek?

shpilt, klezmorim, bazetst di kale,
tsugenumen undz di kinder ale,
dray tekhter iz a shverer yokh,
nor on zey iz shverer nokh.
shpilt, klezmorim, aroys mit trern
s'letste betl vet haynt leydik vern,
s'gantse shtibl, ir kleydershank
oy vey, vi pust un bang.

Subject: An observation/question to add to the 1999 discussion re: farfasn

I am hunting down melodies for about 130 song texts printed in "35 letste teatr lider fun 
Sambatiyon un Azazel" 1929 and by record and bookseller Itsik Zhelonek in Warsaw 
Poland 1933-1934.

I'm mulling here over two of the 1929 songs.

One, "Nervn, nervn," reads: "gezungen un baarbet fun Sh. Lindenfeld." Another, "Di velt 
hot zikh ibergekert" reads: "farfast un gezungen fun Sh. Lindenfeld mit der melodiye 
Gevald a dire"

Confoundingly, both of these songs are in the US copyright office (found at the Library 
of Congress). "Nerven" reads: words and music by Aaron Lebedeff. "Die Welt hat zich 
ybergekert" reads: words and music by Joseph Feldman (arr. H. Zolis).

In both cases, as with many of the songs and couplets in the Zhelonek collection, the 
verses sent to the U.S. copyright office have the same gist but are quite different from the 
ones printed in the Zhelonek collection.

Zylbercweig writes "in farlag Melodiye (Varshe) zaynen dershinen
folgndike L's lider, vi oykh durkh im iberzetste un baarbete: ... "Gvald, vu nemt men a 
dire?" (1924) ... "Nerven, nerven" "Di velt hot zikh ibergekert" (1926) ..."

Feldman copyrighted "Di velt hot zikh ibergekert" in 1924, the year that Lindenfeld 
supposedly wrote the melody "Gevald vu nemt men a dire" which he then supposedly re-
set in 1926 with the text of "Di velt hot zikh ibergekert" - however, if Feldman wrote the 
music, then Lindenfeld stole it and used it twice. (It's a crummy tune.)

I wonder whether baarbetn and farfasn in this context both mean "worked over, 
elaborated, reworked," other possibilities being that (1) farfasn refers only to the words, 
not the music; (2) Lindenfeld was lying and just stole the songs from Feldman and 
Lebedeff; (3) Lebedeff and Feldman were lying and just stole the songs from Lindenfeld.

I have not seen recordings of any of these songs. They are not in Lerski's Encyklopedia.

Thoughts?

Thanks,
Jane Peppler

Subject: "Der findjan"

From Itzhak Luden:

"Der Findjan"

As the authorized translator of Haim Hefer's song The Findjan into Yiddish on the 
request of the author, I ask you to kindly re-publish the words of The Finjan in Mendele, 
due to some errors in transliteration from Yiddish to English. 

The text of this song is now updated, to ensure correct pronunciation.  


Tsulib merere grayzn, vos zenen arayngefaln in dem yidishn tekst fun dem lid, bet ikh 
nokh a mol im farefntlekhn in Mendele, kedey es zol nisht vern farshibesht un falsh tsitirt 
durkh di vos veln zikh mit im banutsn.

Itzhak Luden, Tel Aviv

 
The authorized corrected text is below:

    "Der Findjan" / Haim Hefer
     Yidish: Itzhak Luden      Muzik: Armenisher folks-motif

Tayere Mendelyaner

I am searching for more information on the writer Dr. K. - EL, which appears in Yiddish 
as Dalet. Kuf. - Ayin Lamed. His essay appears in the selected works of Ayzik Meir Dik 
published in Warsaw in 1900.

Any information about Dr. K - EL is much appreciated.

Subject: Jane Peppler's query about Farzykhn

I am sorry to have to object again to the Moderator correcting the spelling and 
pronunciation of a word whose meaning was sought by the questioner.  Since Ms. 
Peppler heard the word in a song, that's what she heard.  Whether that is not Standard 
Yiddish is immaterial.

And to answer Ms. Peppler, farzykhn (pace the Moderator) means "to taste," in her quote, 
i.e., "the uncle had (them) taste the egg."  Whether this has anything to do with custom, 
someone with knowledge of customs would need to reply to that.
