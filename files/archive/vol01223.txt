Subject: wagging tails

The second English line that Dovid Braun has for Adir Hu is
from the English nursery rhyme, "Little Bo Peep," where it
is also the second line:
	
        Little Bo Peep has lost her sheep, and can't tell
        where to find them.

        "Leave them alone, and they'll come home, wagging
        their tails behind them."

There doesn't seem to be any particular rhyme or reason to
its inclusion in Adir Hu, except that it more or less can
be fit to the melody.

Subject: Eppes/epes/epis

I have to admit that the "eppes/epes/epis" is not as simple
as I thought. I may be wrong with *bis, but not ready to
admit it yet.

Wolf relates it to MHD etewaz without any further thoughts.
In the Melokim-buk it is repeatedly etsvash, that is
ayin-tsadik-tsvey-vovn-shin.

Zev Bar-lev's suggestion (216.3) is hard to accept. Landau
(on Gluckel von Hameln's language) quotes examples for pf
becoming tf, rarely the other way. Acc. to Webster's 3d
International: piece is from Vulgar Latin, Old French
pettia. Not OHG bizan, OE bitan. I am sure they all go back
to the same Sanskrit root. This is a long way of saying "I
don't know anymore".

The "Grannan-sentence" (218/5) is unacceptable for purists,
but I am sure, it is done. In 20 years somebody will write
an article on Anglicisms in Yiddish.

To Dovid Braun on "oybershter" (I should have started with
this) In't a superlative included here?  So, the literal
literal translation would be "the One above everything",
"the Supreme One", or simply "Elyon"?

Subject: The Origin of the Word YOK

I joined this most interesting e-mail discussion list a short while
ago when my colleague, Martin Davis, was getting all that feed back
on his topic of the Shickser.

At the risk of monopolizing both the topic area and the
institutional source of the enquiry, I was wondering about
the following related Yiddish word. Where I come from (the
East End of London, England, which was a virtual ghetto at
the turn of the century) it was customary when using
impolite speech for the gentile to be referred to as a Yok.
Since arriving in the United States in 1952 I have never
heard this word being used and haven't found anyone who is
at all familiar with the term.

However, I was on a visit to South Africa a few years ago
and there I heard the word being used in exactly the same
context. Does anyone know of the origin of the word and why
in heaven's name it is restricted to the British Isles and
South Africa? I wonder whether it is used in Australia.

Subject: _gefrishte_ matse & 'matzo-brei'

'matzo-brei' as made by my mother (and also by my wife) is
made with eggs. Matzoh is broken into pieces, made wet, and
then scrambled with eggs and fried.

I'm not familiar with _gefrishte_ matse but assume from
what I read in MENDELE that it doesn't contain eggs.

My mother made a terrific Bobalah. I have no recipe. It was
a puffy pancake made with matzoh meal with sugar on top.
Takke a m'chaye!
