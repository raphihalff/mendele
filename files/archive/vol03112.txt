           Yiddish Clubs International Conference
                         Sid Resnick

One of the newer and less reported developments on the American
Jewish scene in the past two decades has been the emergence of
locally-based informally organized Yiddish-language activity groups
composed mainly of American-born, middle-ages and older people.
Jews meet together to speak and hear Yiddish, to read Yiddish books,
etc.

How many such groups are there?  I was amazed to learn from Fishl
Kutner, the resourceful editor of the monthly newsletter, Der Bay,
in Belmont., CA, that he maintains a register of contacts with over
200 Yiddish groups in the United States!  Der Bay is a clearing
house of information for these groups and features a calendar of San
Francisco area events, and another for national and international
activities.  His newsletter of eight pages, two of them in Yiddish,
is sent to 600 subscribers.  Another bilingual newsletter is
published by the organization Yiddish of Greater Washington, for a
mailing list of 3000.  Newsletters are also issued in Toronto (Dos
Bletl) and in Florida.  There is even an on-line computer bulletin,
issued in Middleton, CT.

****

For these reasons one welcomed the initiative of the organization,
Yiddish of Greater Washington, in arranging the First International
Conference of Yiddish Clubs, held at the Hillel House and adjacent
buildings at the University of Maryland in Rockville from May 29 to
June 1.  About 150 registered for the Conference, of whom 100 were
from outside the Washington, D.C. area and six from Canada and
Argentina.

****

The four lectures presented indicated the Conference planners'
seriousness of purpose.  The lectures were: "H. Leivick, his Life
and Work," a moving account by the poet's daughter-in-law, Ida
Leivick, who lives in Bethesda, MD; "The W.P.A. Yiddish Writers
Project of the 1930's," a fascinating discourse given with much
verve by Prof. Hannah Kliger of the University of Massachusetts;
"The History and Development of the Yiddish Language," a lecture
with slide by Prof. Mikhl Herzog of Columbia University.  The only
Yiddish lecture was that of Moisey Wolf, M.D., also a professor of
psychiatry and a Yiddish writer from Russia who had been a
contributor to Sovetish Heymland in Moscow.  Dr. Wolf, now living in
Portland, represented the Jewish Federation of that city.  Though
his address was not readily understood by everyone he was,
nevertheless, given a standing ovation when he concluded, so
captivated was the audience by his colorful and authentic Yiddish.

Yet, unexpectedly, language truned out, at one point, to be a source
of contention.  The shprakhenkamf, as some dubbed it, reared itself
when an elderly man from Orlando, FL, speaking in Yiddish,
reproached Prof. Kliger for lecturing in English though it was
obvious she knew Yiddish perfectly well.  He had come to the
Conference, he said, "to hear Yiddish and instead all we hear is
English!"  He had his supporters, but it was evident that most of
the audience preferred hearing the lectures in English because their
knowledge of Yiddish was not sufficient to follow a scholarly talk
in mame-loshn.  Was it worth losing one's audience to uphold a
purist attitude?  Indeed, it was clear that most of the Yiddish
groups in the localities generally combine Yiddish with English.

Subject: The joys of Yiddish

[Regarding Sid Reznick's post, zeyt hekher]

Aside from pointing out that the one place Mendele is _not_ issued
from is Middletown, CT (try Brookline, Waltham, Hartford or New
Haven) I have a maysele.  It involves the very same Prof. Hannah
Kliger who was chided for speaking English to a Yiddish audience.

Three or four years ago, Ms. Kliger gave a very interesting talk at
the University of Hartford on the subject of Jewish landsman-
shaften.  Comes time for questions.  First one up is a tense, angry
man who intoduces himself as a Galitsianer and demands to know why
the lecture was given al-pi nusakh Lite.  And more: why does everybody
make bad jokes about Galitsianer?  Poshet, a bezoyn!

A little back-and-forth ensues.  Shteyt oyf an anderer un vil visn:
what about us Turkish Jews?  (Turkish Jews at a Yiddish lecture?
Yes, dear reader.)  And he wants to register his dismay over
Ashkenazi dominance in America.

So it went.  Not one person asked one question about the landsman-
shaften.  Geyt firt oys mit an Idishen oylem!

Subject: Manse/mayse/maynse

Regarding the current mayse/manse debate, my parents have always
said maynse (or mayntse -- it's hard to tell). My father's parents
came to the US from the Polish/Ukranian border area (his first
language was Yiddish), and I believe my mother's grandparents came
from the same area (her first language was English). Seems to me my
mother used the word more.
