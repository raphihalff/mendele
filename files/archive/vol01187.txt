Subject: Introduction

My FULL name is Linda Ellen Feldman. If you want to call me
Hinda, that's fine: I'd like to hear the name used once in
my life!

Despite my address, my place of work is really at the
University of Windsor , where, contrary to what one might
expect, I teach German. (That makes me the resident
Germanist in drag? Or are there any others out there in the
electronic wilderness?)

I am currently working on a research project on the
Zichroynes of Glikl Hamil, or, as I usually call her,
Glueckel von Hameln. Specifically, I am studying the
question of marginality in the genesis of her - and
eventually - early modern German autobiographical writing
by women. I won't bore you with the tedious details unless
I am asked. . .

From working on the project, I have had the lonely task of
confronting Western Yiddish on my own, and my interest in
post-renaissance reading materials in Western Yiddish has
been aroused. So I suspect that, should I survive Glueckel,
I shall march determinedly toward the Brantspiegel, and who
knows what else after that! My approach is
interdisciplinary, which can be stimulating, but also
extremely frustrating: to my knowledge, there are few early
modernists in the two fields, which means I soliloquize a
lot.

This is where the list comes in: I hope it will forge a few
useful contacts, provide bibliographical references,
increase my awareness of on-going debates in the field of
Yiddish lit, stimulate my imagina- tion and provide a
recipe for earthly happiness!

I have also taught courses on the Holocaust in western lit
and film, but that probably lies outside the scope of the
list's discussion.

My only credentials as a Yiddishist is that I sing in the
Yiddish choir at the Windsor JCC. (:-)

Still, I hope that my voice will occasionally be heard in
the land of mendele.

A gut yomtov.

Subject: Glueckel's Yiddish

To whoever enquired about a Yiddish edition of Glueckel's
Zichroynes:

1)David Kaufmann transcribed and annotated the memoirs in
1896; they were published in Frankfurt am Main by F.
Kaufmann (I may have to check that: my copy of the memoirs
is in my office)

2)Alfred Feilchenfeld published a German translation of the
memoirs around 1916; his GERMAN translation is the basis of
English, French and modern Yiddish translations of the
text. This is to be regretted, as Feilchenfeld chopped
parts of the text he considered "wordy".

3)However, a German translation of the complete text was
published privately by Bertha Pappenheim about 1910.

As far as I am aware, a Western Yiddish edition of the
memoirs is not currently in print; I obtained my copy
through Germania Judaica in Cologne. If my memory serves me
well, Hebrew Union in Cincinnati has the text, ditto the
Leo Baeck Institute in New York, and possibly the Jewish
Public Library in Montreal. Pappenheim's translation I also
obtained through Germania Judaica; I have not looked for it
here, nor have I stumbled across it, but presumably the
first two institutions named above would be good places to
begin looking, especially if you are desperate.

Hope these comments have been helpful.

Subject: Introduction

Louis (Label) Janus

I am a historical linguist, with particular interest in
North Germanic Languages.  My interest in Yiddish, aside
from its relatedness to West Germanic, is cultural.  My
parents and grandparents spoke Yiddish, and I have studied
it a bit (one course at the U of Minnesota, and one at
Hillel in Wisconsin.
