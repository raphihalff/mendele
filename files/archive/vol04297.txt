Yossi Galron [4.295] asks about "Ishkabibel Domanickel"

I don't know the context of Haim Chertok's Bronx Pesach story, but to
anyone growing up in the US in the late thirties and forties, the name
'Ishkabibel' was that of a comic musician/character who was part of the
late Kay Kayser's band.  Kayser's "College of Musical Knowledge" was a
popular musical and comedy radio and then TV show.  It was sort of a
"joke" name intended to evoke laughs and the character played a comic
funny-man role to Kayser's "straight-man" role. [Having a "comic" band
member was a regular ploy of US pop bands -- n.b. the guitarist in
Branford Marsalis's TV "Tonight" show band used by Jay Leno.]  I don't
recall the 'Domanickel' part, but it sounds like a rhyming play.  Not
being a devotee of the Kayser show, I can't offer more help, but there
must be a book on him...though our university library doesn't have one.
Try Philip Eberly's _Music in the Air_ (1982), a history of popular music
on radio.  I do recall some time back an obituary item in the NY Times
for Ishkabibel.  Try there to start, for Kayser, too.  His band made many
records ... I don't believe this had any Jewish connection, but Kayser
was likely of German-American heritage and, as I recall from the
"heartland" of the US.

"Ish" as in "Oh, Ish!" was [is?] a Minnesota localism of the '30's and
40's popularized in Minneapolitan Max Shulman's early comic writings
featuring Dobie Gillis and his Twin City buddies... Oy vey! this takes
me back to grad school in Minnesota... Where are our regional linguist
specialists in Mid-American language?

I do know that this term was a nonsense-word popularized by Kay Kaiser, a
bandleader in the '40's, when I was not even a gleam in my daddy's eye,
so someone who was around then should speak.

There is little question in my mind that the term is mock-Hebrew, and an
allusion to the use of Hebrew as incantation/code by legendary sorcerers
and adepts of mediaeval myth.

I have fancifully imagined that perhaps it might an idiosyncratic
misvocalization of "a/the man who is like unto Babylon" (Ish ka Bovel,
cf, "Iscariot" (Ish Kerioth), the man from Kerioth). WARNING: This is an
original, malicious folk etymology, not research!

I don't know if it will throw any light on the mystery, but
back in the 40's, the Kay Kaiser Band had a vocalist called
Ishkabibel.  I can't remember his real name.

It is always discouraging to have a vague sort of handle on a subject but
not be able to get to its heart.  Here is my handle on the word
"Ishkabibel" and it may be of no value at all.

During WW2, and in the era of the big bands, one of them was that of Kay
Kaiser.  To me he was always a moron; i.e., he had a surprised expression
on his face at all times, he behaved like the village idiot, and he
seemed to take pleasure in having various members of his band behave in
ways that were even more imbecilic than he.   One of them was a trumpet
player whose hair was cut in bangs.  He was skinny and goofy.  I have no
idea what his real name was, but he was called Ishkabibel, though how it
was spelled is unknown to me.

Kaiser had a radio program called "Kay Kaiser's College of Musical
Knowledge" which may have even extended into the early days of TV.
Ishkabibel played an important role in both.  He also made a series of
the most awful films known to man or beast.  Even "Plan 9 From Outer
Space" was a masterpiece next to the Kay Kaiser films.  Ishkabibel, and
all of his mishegos, was a part of those awful films.

The origin of the name never interested me.  I was always embarassed
whenever Kaiser turned the spotlight of attention on him.  Please don't
tell me that the name has a Yiddish origin.  I couldn't stand the shame.

If my memory serves me right, that was the name of a character in a cartoon
strip by possibly Rube Goldberg or Milt Gross.  This would run back to the
30's.

[The character was Abie Kabibble.  I prefer to think that it was
withdrawn because the caricature resembled too closely the drawings that
were appearing in Der Stuermer.  We're wandering from Yiddish again and
Mendele will accept no further posts on this topic.  nm]

Subject: Kalye gemakht di mashinke; a note to new subscribers

Posters to Mendele a few days ago have been wondering why their
messages haven't appeared.  The reason is simple: the shames in
fooling around with the Unix software--of which understands absolutely
nothing--wrote a / instead of a \ (or maybe it was the other way).
Deep regrets.

Some of you have already been in touch and have been asked to repost.
Would others please follow suit?  A dank.

Mendele has been in the habit of writing new subscribers asking them for
an introductory post.  But not in the last week or so.  To those who
haven't been officially welcomed, please accept this note in lieu of
same.  And send us a note as soon as you can.

Zayt mir ale gezunt.
