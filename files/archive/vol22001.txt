Subject: etymology of "poyer"
Date: April 27

What is the etymology of "poyer" for "peasant"?
Seems more Slavic than either Germanic or Hebrew.

Subject: Yiddish for "know it all"

I am writing a novel that takes place in a shtetl on the road between Warsaw and 
Bialystok in 1919. I'm looking for the Yiddish equivalent of "pompous ass" or "know-it-
all." Any suggestions?

Subject: rebbe

Yiddish dictionary on line, citing YIVO standards, spells the Hasidic rabbi as "rebe," 
http://www.yiddishdictionaryonline.com/ while Wikipedia uses "rebbe." 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebbe_%28disambiguation%29
Please, which is correct? A non-Jewish friend of mine read "rebe" as "reeb"

Cheers,
Norbert Hirschhorn

Subject: gimze

Earlier today, Gloria Berkenstat Freund posted a question to the Mendele Personals list, 
but the answer is of general linguistic interest.  Gloria wrote:

I am translating an article from the Kurow Yizkor Book. There is a reference to "leder 
gimzes." The phrase appears in a paragraph about a "Polish shoemaker who agreed to hide 
Jews in exchange for 10 "leder gimzes." Does anyone know what a leather "gimze" is?

In "Jews and Shoes" (Oxford, UK: Berg, 2008), Edna Nahshon defines "gimze" as "thin 
and supple goat hide... Gimze, which was very pliable and expensive, came in brown and 
black." [95]  For European shoemakers, gimze was "[t]he most expensive leather for 
uppers." [97]

I found another clue in the soc.genealogy.jewish archives (14 Nov 2011): 
"Gimze" is a regional Yiddish variant for the German gemze but is not standard Yiddish.

And Gemze?  It's the German name for the wild European antelope better known to us 
by its French name (chamois).  But so far as I know, not related to Gomez (gam zu 
l'tovah).

Subject: Vestiges of progressive voicing assimilation in NEY

EY famously employs the "Slavic" habit of regressive voicing assimilation in obstruent 
clusters.
NEY is described as having an even more pervasive application than other EY dialects, 
namely assimilation also applies across word boundaries: "host genug" "hozd genug" etc.
Interestingly, the word /nito/ "absent," a contraction of /nit do/ "not here," seems to 
demonstrate progressive, rather than regressive, assimilation. /nit/ is also a NEY lexical 
item, cf. nish (mostly non-NEY).
Maybe there are more examples, but this is likely a vestige of a time when yiddish 
employed a different phonology.
This should be looked into.

Subject: "ruf mikh nar un gib mir lekakh"

Tayere leyeners,

I was wonder if anyone recognizes the expression "ruf mikh nar un gib mir lekakh" as a 
song, probably from right around the turn of the century? Do you know which one? I 
looked on the internet but didn't find anything. The line is from the play "Mirele Efros," 
written about 1898. Here is the text it appears in: 

Hannah Devoire: Afilu in der linker peyah ligt es mir nisht. Vi zogt men: ruf mikh nar un 
gib mirlekakh. . . Ikh vil zen beser di kallah-matones. Ir hot tzugezogt dimentene 
oyeringlekh, mit a brosh, mit a bronzshelet, nomikh akorsht zen. . . ir meynt nisht, az ir vet 
opkumen mit shieh-pieh.

I'd appreciate any suggestions! Also, I've seen various translations for "lekakh" (cinnamon 
cake, honey cake). Any thoughts on this word?

A sheynem dank,
Rus (Ruth Murphy)

Subject: "Vi shver s'iz tsu gleybn"

The poem George Sacks is looking for is a Holocaust song called "S'vet Zikh fun Tsvaygl 
Tseblien a Boym." Lyrics: Sh. Katczerginski. Music: A. Volkoviski.
The words and transliteration appear in Gottlieb and Mlotek's *25 Ghetto
Songs.*

Subject: "Tsistsilist"

Hi there,

In a Yiddish book I am translating, "Mayn Lite" by Solomon Buirski, published in 1976 
in South Africa, but referring to the years 1902-1911 in Lithuania, they use the word 
(noun) "Tsistsilist" for somebody who has become a free thinker or apikoros. On a google 
search the word "Tsitsilist" appeared in the online English translation of the Yizkor Bukh 
for Nowy Sancz on the Jewishgen.


What would b a good English equivalent for "Tsitsilist" and what is the derivation of the 
word? I know what immediately comes to mind is the German/Yiddish word for a 
woman's breast. However, a friend of mine wondered if there could be any connection 
with the word "zeteticist," meaning a skeptic, which entered the English and other 
European languages from the Greek?
