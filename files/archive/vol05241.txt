Subject: Some questions about Western Yiddish

Would anybody know whether WY dialects have (or had) either  of the following:
-c (ts) in the 2nd person pl. of verbs and the absence of umlaut in the 2nd
and 3rd person pl. of the persent tense of strong verbs (forst, fort rather
than, like German, fa"hrst, fa"hrt)?

Please respond to me directly.

Subject: "The last Yiddish..."

Journalist A. Litvin wrote a 5 volume journalistic-ethnographic series
_Yidishe neshomes_, depicting East European Jewish life as he saw it during
his travels throughout various regions populated by Yiddish-speaking Jews:
Lite, Galitsye, etc. etc.  In a piece written, if memeory serves me correctly,
in 1911 [!], he describes his meeting with "the last [!] Yiddish folksinger."

Subject: Life or death? - Nu shoyn!

This discussion has been going on for an eternity here on Mendele. Isn't it
time to stop? We all are interested in yiddish as it is and has been. Why not
move forward and do what's necessary to encourage further growth and stop
wasting our effort on discussions that are fruitless and cause for dissension.

Lozt shoyn op!

Subject: Pronunciation of suffixes

The yud in the yud-nun feminine suffix is not pronounced in any dialect.  The
standardizers of Yiddish spelling possibly thought they were doing the
Yiddish-reader a favor by upholding a graphic distinction between the
/n/-suffix which marks the plural and the /n/-suffix which is a feminine
marker on certain agentive nouns.  Given the "daytshmerisher oysleyg" -- the
spelling system they were standardizing away from, they seem to have kept this
orthographic daytshmerizm (cf. M. Schaechter's article of the 1960s "The
HIdden Standard," which discusses numerous cases of New High German influences
that, even if not common (or at all existent) in the spoken language, were
okayed by the okaying powers -- the standardizers). The "sovetisher oysleyg,"
on the other hand, did away with the yud.  That system undid numerous other
spellingisms that were inherited from Modern German (e.g. "oyf" which is never
pronounced that way in Yiddish).

The allowance of the yud-nun spelling has had the effect of "creating"
speakers for whom the suffix in fact has the vowel [i] in it.  (Likewise,
there are now speakers who say [oyf].)

As for the lack of a pasekh under the tsvey yudn in the suffix _kayt_, this
reflects the curious fact that in "Voliner" Yiddish (Southeastern Yiddish --
the dialects of Ukraine, Bessarabia, Podolia, etc.), speakers actually
pronounce the suffix [keyt] and not [kayt].  This is unexpected, given the
usual correspondence between the three main dialects where "Lite" and "Volin"
have [ey] and "Poyln/Ungern" has [ay].  Instead, Lite and Poyln agree on this
one.

As for -hayt, it is not a productive suffix in Yiddish.  Aside from _frayhayt_
which, I've noticed, is used only (or usually) in the context of national
freedom, political autonomy, etc. (i.e. in the domain of political discourse),
there's also _fraykeyt/fraykayt_ 'fluency; "freeness"; state of being
unoccupied or gratis; etc.' or _frayshaft_, i.e. an analytic form. _frayhayt_
probably came into Yiddish through Modern German (the language from which
Yiddish absorbed many words of political discourse); old words with what was
priginally the suffix -hayt have preserved it as -et, e.g. [vuret] 'truth' in
"poylish" Yiddish, from /vor/+/hayt/. Probably also the name [frimet] > /frum/
+ /hayt/
