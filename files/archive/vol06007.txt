Subject: Norman Fishman

I'm not sure if this is the appropriate forum to send an obituary, but
since my father was such an avid Mendele reader, I felt it was the best
way to contact his on-line friends.

Norman Fishman spoke fluent Yiddish and always enjoyed conversing with
others about it, both in person and in correspondence. "Pop" would
frequently print out articles and share with family and friends who did
not have access to computers.  Since there are so many wonderful people
he maintained email relationships with, it would be nearly impossible to
notify everyone individually.

My father was my hero...the perfect role model of generosity, humor,
integrity, and intelligence.  Pop insisted on telling the truth and
doing the right thing in all situations.  Norman had an enormous impact
on everyone who knew him, and the thousands that he helped indirectly
through anonymous contributions to Jewish charities. Norman Fishman was
truly a mensch and will be fondly remembered.

Below is the funeral announcement we placed in the San Jose Mecury News
and the San Francisco Chronicle, for those of you not living in the SF
Bay Area.  An announcement will also be sent to the Jewish Bulletin.
Please feel free to forward this to anyone who might have known Norman.

Norman Fishman -- Died on May 25, 1996 at the age of 72, due to
complications related to leukemia.  Norman was born on July 18, 1924 in
Petaluma, California to Tova and Max Fishman, Russian immigrants.  He
served in the U.S. Navy during WWII, graduated from UC Berkeley, and
retired from SRI International in 1988 after a 34 year career as a
chemical engineer and consultant.  Norman was an active member of the
Jewish community, serving three terms as president of the South
Peninsula Jewish Community Center; founder of the Palo Alto School for
Jewish Education; and treasurer of the Sino-Judaic Institute, where he
spent considerable time researching Asian Jewry.

Norman is survived by his wife Lillian of Menlo Park; son David,
daughter-in-law Mitzi, grandson Max of San Jose; daughter Devora of
Redwood City; sister Lily Krulevitch of Petaluma, and many relatives and
friends in the United States, Europe, and Israel. Norman will be greatly
missed by his family, friends, associates, and the community.

Friends are invited to attend a celebration of Norman's life on Sunday
June 2, 1996 from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm at the Albert l. Schultz Jewish
Community Center, 655 Arastradero Road, Palo Alto, California.
Donations may be made to the American Cancer Society, American Technion
Society, ORT, or the Hebrew Free Loan Association.

Subject: Introduction

Recently I subscribed to this list, now I would like to introduce
myself. I am living in a small, rather isolated village in the
Netherlands near the German border. I have been working during forty
years as a scientist in industry. Since I retired I am studying the
cultural history of Central- and Western-Europe in the XIX and XX
centuries.

I am preparing now a biography of a fast forgotten author from Galicia,
his name is Salamon Dembitzer. He was born in 1888 in Krakov, at that
time belonging to Austria. He wrote his poems in Yiddish, his prose was
published in German, English and Dutch. He died 1964 in Lugano,
Switzerland.

Dembitzer lived in exile in New York from 1941 up to 1947. There are a
few letters to him from this period in the archive of the Leo Baeck
Institute in New York. That is all the information I have on his stay in
the USA. These letters are from Julian Tuvim, Rudolf Rocker, Leo Jung,
Ludwig Lewisohn, H.E.Jacob and D.Marianoff. Who knows where I could find
more about Dembitzer's stay in New York?

Of course any information on Dembitzer is very, very welcome !

Subject: Yisroel Pollak's _In a shturmisher tkufe_

I am trying to obtain a copy of Israel Pollak's autobiography, _In a
shturmisher tkufe: oytobiografye_ (Tel-Aviv: Farlag Y.L. Perets, 1988).
I would be very much grateful for any suggestions about how to go about
doing this and whom to contact.  Thank you very much.
