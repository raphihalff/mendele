Subject: A Yiddish film database

My apologies if this has been run before.  I recently came across what looks
like the ultimate in film-buffery, The Internet Movie Database.  The number of
films covered is staggering, the details even more so.  Among them are 83
Yiddish titles, and most readers can find out more than they probably want to
know by clicking http://us.imdb.com/M/list?tv=on&&language=Yiddish

Translation:

Nachman Meisel's book, Predecessors and Contemporaries (New York: IKUF, 1946) 
consistis of twenty articles about Jewish authors.  In the last article,
written 1945, Maisel expresses his opinions and impressions about Chaim Grade,
poet and person.  He writes from personal standpoint with descriptions of
earnest discussions with Grade. 

Meisel provides a glimpse into one of the group, _Young Vilna_, who lived
through such horrifying, deadly dangers.  Mayzl writes (p. 415): 

He lived in Vilne, and outwardly, indeed only outwardly, he belonged to the
group _Young Vilna_.  Basically, he marched and clambered along his own path,
his own direction.  He worshiped solitude, although he was _enrolled_ in the
Vilna group of poets.  He actually appeared in various photographs with the
_Young Vilna_ group, but he had definitely detached himself from them, just as
he had sharply separated a few years earlier from the circle called Muserniks
(moral ascetics) in the Novoredok yeshiva, where he had lived together with
comrades and yet was an absolutely independent outsider with his own doubts
and quests, his own dreams and aspirations. 

Meisel ends his article with a few words about Grades latest book (1945),
_Generations_.

Subject: Yiddish Linguistics (Reading List)

Noyekh Miller has asked me to post some references to non-Weinreich work on
the history of Yiddish.  I will post some of the things which which I
personally happen to think of as particularly important (which may be
idiosyncratic).  In this posting, I will only list people belonging roughly to
the same era as Max Weinreich.  At some point, I will try to post a list of
some of the more recent work on the origins and early history of Yiddish (here
I will only call attention to the Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic
Jewry, the project started by Uriel Weinreich and for many years carried on by
Marvin Herzog, where references can be found to most of this work as well as
to much other work which I am not listing here). 

Beranek, Franz J. (1965) Westjiddischer Sprachatlas.  Marburg: N. G. Elwert.
(With references to his other works, which collectively are very important,
although not always reliable.  Much of his work was not taken into account
fully or at all by Weinreich). 

Bin-Nun, Jechie (1973) Jiddisch und die deutschen Mundarten unter besonderer
Berucksichtigung des ostgalizischen Jiddisch. Tubingen: Max Niemeyer.  (This
was written in the 1930's when Bin-Nun's name was Fischer but the bulk of it
was published many years later.  As a result of when the main part of this
came out, it could not be taken into account by Weinreich.  Bib-Nun did not
really do any other work on the subject, but in many ways his is one of my
favorite works on Yiddish.) 

Birnbaum, Solomon A. (1979) Yiddish: A Survey and a Grammar. Toronto and
Buffalo: University of Toronto Press. (This is a rather disorganized book and
hard to follow, because it is essentially put together out of various bits and
pieces which, while revised, come from various publications of his dating to
fifty or more years earlier.  Some pieces are highly technical, others are
excessively popular, and he does not take almost any theoretical work by other
people into account, even though he has a very lengthy bibliography) 

Mieses, Matthias. 1924. Die jiddische Sprache.  Berlin and Vienna:  Benjamin
Harz.  (Mieses was an amateur and he makes some amazing mistakes, e.g.,
deriving Yiddish vorn Fbecause' from Latin quare instead of connecting it to
German warum, and so on.  But in many OTHER respects it is a great work, and
another favorite of mine.) 

There is of course a lot more, but these are perhaps the most important works
for someone who wants to get a sense of what besides Weinreich's Geshikhte
existed in Yiddish historical linguistics as it was as of 1975 or so. 

For Eastern Yiddish specifically, the indispensable reference is:

Herzog, Marvin I. (1965) The Yiddish Language in Northern Poland: Its
Geography and History. Bloomington. Indiana University. (This is the book that
got me interested in Yiddish historical linguistics in the first place, which
is the least important of its many merits I guess.) 

For those interested in what I call non-Eastern Yiddish or better the various
non-Eastern Yiddishes (the accepted term has been FWestern Yiddish' but I have
argued that, whereas Eastern Yiddish is a unit, Western Yiddish is not),
Beranek's work is one source.  Another source for non-Eastern Yiddish is Max
Weinreich's (1958) article ``Roshe-prokim vegn mayrevdikn yidish''.  In: Yuda
A. Yofe-bukh, 158-194. New York: Yivo.  Also Guggenheim-Gru"nberg, Florence.
1973. Jiddisch auf alemannischem Sprachgebiet. Zurich: Juris Druck + Verlag.
[Beitra"ge zur Geschichte und Volkskunde der Juden in der Schweiz, 10.]

Of special interest, although it is in many ways obsolete, is Weinreich's
history of Yiddish linguistics (which only takes us through the early 1920's,
when it was actually written): 
Weinreich, Max (1993) Geschichte der jiddischen  Sprachforschung. Atlanta.

Finally, I do not know how many people are aware of the never-settled
controversy as to whether all, some, or none of the so-called FOld Yiddish'
texts are actually Yiddish (as opposed to German in Hebrew letters, some OTHER
Jewish language of German origin other than Yiddish, or a stage at which
German and Yiddish were still one language and so indistinguishable).  This is
one of THE central issues in Yd lx, and perhaps the best place to start is
Jerold Frakes' The Politics of Interpretation. 

There is as I say much much more, but I think this is a good starting reading
list for someone whose sole or main source on Yiddish lx and the history of Yd
is Weinreich's Geshikhte.

Subject: Mourning the death of a colleague

Dorothy Bilik, recently retired from the teaching of Yiddish and Yiddish
literature at the University of Maryland, College Park, died several days ago.
Friends will soon be notified of plans for a Memorial in Maryland and burial
in New York. 

Please contact me directly for more information.

Subject: Dorothy Bilik z"l

I heard from a friend that Dorothy Bilik, a professor at the University of
Maryland, and a scholar of Yiddish, working most recently on Glikl of Hameln,
passed away recently.  I saw her at the Yiddish literature session on
translating Yiddish literature at the Modern Language Association Convention
in Toronto, on December 28.  She looked beautiful in her scarlet hat, and it
was wonderful to talk with her.  I shall miss her and her contributions to the
profession.  May her memory be blessed.

Subject: khaloymes

dos shraybt der podolyer goylem:

tu ikh. 

farvos podolyer?  vayl mayn balebos shtamt fun podolye un dort redt men

shrayb ikh "loshn".  er zogt "van", shrayb ikh "vayn" u"a"v. 

un tsu klep iz men nokh nisht gekumen.

The balebos says:

The goylem is only a few days old. Originally intended to ease arthritic
fingers, it occurred to me that voice recognition software --once it gets
easier, more powerful and cheaper--could be useful to Yiddishists.  So I
taught the program to write "shrayb" when I say "shrab", "mame"  when I say
"mome", etc.  No special problems encountered except for the training
sessions, which take time. 

To teach the program new words one brings up a text of some sort, which in
this case is simply Refoyl Finkel's word list, taken with his approval from
his wonderful "yidishe shrayb-mashinke" (about which more later). The program
lists all the words not already in its vocabulary and the user is asked to
pronounce each word.  The rest is pretty straightforward.  It works. 

And here is the heart of my message.  Input varies with dialect. Written
output does not. 

Who could benefit from voice recognition software?

    . Those with geleymte hent, like me, who have trouble typing or
      who, again like me, never learned touch-typing.

    . Those Mendelists who are somewhat unsure of their Yiddish but
      are reluctant to use dictionaries.

    . Those to whom writing YIVO style seems for whatever reason
      strange if not downright heretical.  This latter group, which
      includes some of Mendele's best writers, would be mekayem a
      real mitsve (as they say in yeshivish) if they were to write
      with an eye to those who are learning or relearning Yiddish
      and for whom learning _one_ way of spelling is already a
      task, let alone three.

    . Finally those who cling to the notion that Yiddish is not a
      language, that it has no grammar and no spelling and that
      what they dimly remember is good enough.  These have the most
      to gain.

But there's more.  If speech recognition is here, so is Refoyl Finkel's system
for transforming romanized Yiddish texts (using the YIVO standard) into
Yiddish texts--the most beautiful Yiddish fonts by the way that anyone has
ever seen. So with a little tweaking here and some shoe-horning there we may
be only a few steps away from being able to _talk_ a brivele der tante or an
article for the Forverts or TMR.  (For an example of what this looks like in
Yiddish you can visit http://www2.trincoll.edu/~nmiller .) And I hope that not
even our most farbisene regionalists will argue with a system that yields
standard written Yiddish in Yiddish characters. 

I'm using Dragon's _Naturally Speaking_.  Not cheap, not expensive. It comes
with a headset and a blessedly short manual that can be read in five minutes. 
You will need a soundcard and quite a lot of memory. 

A word of caution: training the program to recognize the way you pronounce
your words is by no means lightning-swift.  It takes in fact quite a lot of
time.  There will also be lots of frustrating moments.  We techies (ot di
teyve hob ikh geyarshnt fun tatn) think we're in the catbird seat; more
sensible folks undertand in fact that the technology is only beginning to be
usable. 

And there are other, perhaps better, software packages available, so it might
be wise to let the dust settle a bit before buying. It would be helpful if
knowledgeable Mendelists were to chime in on this. 

Maybe not this month or this year, but I'd be very surprised if by the year
2000 the majority of Mendelistn were not speaking their posts.  Efsher kumt
take bald meshiekh?

Subject: Famished?

Hello. I'm new to the list. When I was a kid in Boston my parents used 
to say of my sister (or me) when we were real tired and acting like 
brats, SO and SO is "famished?" Farmisched? I can't find the word in a 
Yiddish dictionary. Was I hearing right?
