Subject: Mel Poretz's memories

Mel Poretz asks about some expressions he heard in his youth. I know a few of
them. 

1. Morditchka. Morda in Russian means snout or face. In Yiddish it means chin.
Morditchka would be a little chin. So Mel had a cute little chin as a boy. 

2.  Lachen mit yashcherkes. In Russian yashcherke is a lizard.  The
Yiddish expression is a form of gallow's humor.  If you laugh with lizards it
means, I'm laughing but it is not  funny. It is actually very sad.
                                        
Those are the expressions I know.

Mel Poretz asked about the meanings of several expressions:

1)  men ken nit zayn mit eyn toches oyf tzen yariden - one can also say the
following: Men ken nit tantzn oyf tzvey chazones mit eyn mol.

2)  ikl'l visn fun tzuris should be:  ikh zol nit visn un kayn tzuris. 

3) morditchka - diminutive of mordeh which means chin. and

4) lochn mit yastcherkes means that you are really laughing on the outside,
but crying on the inside.  It means that your laughter is really not true. 
Ich hof as ikh hob a bissl aroysgeholfn. 

Hot a gutn tog!

2) There is a Purim song that begins:' Vikhna Dvusha fort in shtut./ Halt zikh
in eyn pakn/ Tsayt af Purim koyfn mel/ Humin tashn bakn.' Vikhna may be a
variant of Yenta.

6) "Ayn tukhus awf tzvay yaridn."  Bay undz hot men gezugt: "Mit eyn tukhus
ken men nisht tantzen af tzvey khasines."

10)  "Lokh mit yakhtchikes." We took this to mean that the laughter was marred
by some underlying feelings other than 'funny.'

Azoy is geven bay undz in der haym. Mir hobn shtendig gelakht mit yakhtchikes.

Good luck. Thank you for your memories.

Subject: Mel Poretz's memories 

Mel Poretz, requested (Mendele 7.143) clarification of some expressions he
remembers from his childhood. The region from which his parents came was
sometimes Polish, sometimes Russian and was certainly within what is now,
Lithuania, so that the Yiddish was influenced by all their languages. Assuming
that Russian predominated, and that Mel is indeed off orthographically, I can
offer the following:                                                
   Item 2. "Dvusha" is a nickname for Dvoyre, i. e. a girls name.
   Item 3. "Chishik" - Russian "Chizh"= "finch". "Chizhik" is diminutive. The
word for "squirrel" is "byelka."
   Item 4. "khurum" could be "khurbn", Yiddish for "catastrophe", although
there is a Russian idiom, "khorom idyot"="moves in a chorus", i.e things are
happening fast. The nearest to "avalitsya" in Russian is "metelitsa"="a
blizzard" or "valitsa"="is falling"
   Item 5. "Kondrasha" is a diminutive of a man's name, "Kondratii" who could
have been a local bully.
   Item 7. The expression we used was "er (ikh) zol azoy visn fun tzores"="he
should only know of such troubles." 
   Item 8. "Morda" is Russian for "snout" or, derogotary, for "face", i. e.
"mug." "Mordochka" is the diminutive and becomes a term of endearment.
   Item 9. This is obviously a non-sense verse, so the combination of words is
picked for sound.  "Surrokeh" is probably "Soroka", Russian for "magpie",
"varoneh" is "vorona"="crow" and "kotchkeh" is "koshka"="cat" (it could also be
"katchke", Yiddish for "duck" --- take your choice!). "varilla, etu" should
have no comma since "varila"="was cooking" and "etu"="this". "Medallah", I
guess, is the Yiddish "meydele"="little girl", although why a magpie, a crow
and a cat(duck)  "were cooking a little girl" is beyond comprehension. But,
since "malenka" is the feminine diminutive of "little one,"  the poor girl must
really have been done in! The rest of that ditty I'l leave to the linguists,
since none, even remotely, resembles Russian words I can think of.
   Item 10.  "lokh mit yakhtchikes" should be "lakhn mit yashcherkes"="laughing
with lizards", i.e. "laughing through tears."

[Moderator's note: "Soroka-vorona" was discussed in Mendele at length, see
e.g. Mathis Chazanov's text and translation in Vol4.390:2]

lokhn mit yakhchikes:
Literally, to laugh with lizards. Figuratively, to laugh through tears. The
reference is to having a cold sore or scab (the yakhchikeh) on or adjacent to
one's lip, which cracks apart when stretched by a smile or a laugh.

Subject: Mel Poretz's memories

The phrase, 'tsu lachn mit yaschikes' was not uncommonly used, implying
laughter without joy or humor.  I had not found the word 'yaschikes' in my
limited search, but an unnamed source, a friend of my older sister who is
said to be quite knowledgeable and reliable said the word means lizard.
The phrase then becomes an analogue of 'crocodile tears' in english, and
may even imply some cross-cultural recognition of a 'crocodile smile.'
Sure enough, looking up lizard in Abelson was rewarded;there was yaschike,
more or less, although not given for either alligator or crocodile.  I had
certainly never heard the word other than in the idiomatic context, and
this despite many visits to the Bronx Zoo in the company of my father, who
was the yiddishist.

Subject: p'tscheh

My family is from Yzaslavl (Ukraine; Rovne gebernye), and our version of this
dish, pronounced p'tscheh, was a hot garlicky-egg soup made with chicken
pipiks and chicken feet (discarded before eating). It was certainly more
appealing than the traditional cold version of calf's foot in aspic.  As kids
we loved it, and fondly referred to it as "yellow gravy"--though as I write
this, that doesn't sound much more palatable. I make p'tscheh today when I
think my arteries can handle the strain. (Recipe upon request.)

Subject: P'tsha or P'tsa.

I haven't had anything to contribute to this list before, since I am not
fluent in Yiddish.  I subscribed to the list in hopes that it would help me
learn.  It has provided me with a great deal of information and many smiles. 

I grew up in a small town in west Texas (yes, there are Jews in Texas).  The
only time I heard Yiddish was when my folks didn't want me to understand what
they were talking about, when my grandparents or other older relatives
visited, and when we listened to Mickey Katz albums. 

My mother felt that, even in though we lived in Texas, my Jewish culinary
heritage should not be neglected.  The nearest delicatessen was 400 miles
away, but my mother was a master at creating ethnic food in this cultural
wilderness.  For instance, she pickled cucumbers, tomatoes, sour kraut,
tongue, and corned beef, since the nearest delicatessen was over 400 miles
away. 

Mom used to make a mock p'tsa (that's how she pronounced it) using left over
turkey.  She made a gelatinous sauce that contained eggs, flour, vinegar, a
lot of garlic, and white pepper.  According to the story she told, my
grandfather (who came from Lithuania) loved the P'tsa, but nobody else in the
family would come near it.  So, my grandmother (whose family came from
Hungary) created the mock dish which had a similar consistency and flavor, but
was made from more acceptable ingredients.  Anyway, it was delicious! 

We used to say that p'tsa prevented disease.  If you ate it, the garlic smell
kept everyone away from you for at least a week! 

Thanks for triggering this wonderful memory.  Now that I live in California,
there is much more available to me, but the flavors of my memories are the
best.

Subject: Rafoyel Mahler and Yuri Suhl

In the 50's,I think, I attended a mitel shule class in New York City, in
Yiddish.  I had no previous schooling in the language but grew up in a home
with immigrant parents and was familiar with the "tog teglikher sprakh.  My
lehrer was Dr. Rafoyel Mahler.  I remember him as a wonderful man and great
teacher.  Can you tell me anything about him.  I know he was not in the
Arbitering Circle.  I think he was politically left.  I would also like to
know about a Yiddish poet of that era, Yuri Suhl.  I know he wrote a book of
verse called "Di Partisaner" 

These two people were my guides to Yiddish.  I read Mendele with much
"farginigun" and lead a Yiddish Vinkl in my community.
