Doesn't -layt come straight from the German "Leute"
(people/men&women) ?

To Cal Pryluck (regarding vol. 1, no. 239):

My intention was to assure proper credit to the correct
sponsoring agent for the right camp and certainly not to
cause embarrassment.  I must admit though that I thoroughly
enjoyed your masterfully crafted and poetic clause used to
describe your blushing reaction (I would be very hard put
to render it into Yiddish!) I was merely reminiscing when I
went over to Yiddish.  I stated that to the best of my
recollection the parents (of the kinderlekh at Kindervelt)
mainly spoke Yiddish while we kinderlekh only used English
amongst ourselves.  (This formed a major linguistic and
cultural barrier separating Kindervelt from Unser Camp...)
I finally went back in 1989 to see what had become of the
place.  It was all boarded up, a silent, empty ruin.  The
"No Trespassing" signs deterred me from closer examination.
There may have also been a "For Sale" sign attached to a
tree.  (Anyone want to buy it for a new Kindervelt -a
YIDISH LAND- and truly make it Unser Camp once again?)

If I'm not mistaken, Theodore Bikel has a version of
"Shvartse Karshelekh" on one of his Yiddish records.  He
sings it as if he were a drunken Galitsyaner, the chorus
beginning "Ay, vay iz tsi mi-er..."

David Miller writes:

   Vilne--as well as its companion font, Kovne--are based upon
   the Hebrew font distributed with the old Mac in Hebrew
   init/da; Vilne strips the Mac in Hebrew-specific encoding
   while Kovne retains the right-to-left encoding unique to
   Mac in Hebrew.  Mac in Hebrew is/was shareware, with a fee
   payable, if memory serves, to the Cambridge (MA) Hillel
   Foundation; Vilne and Kovne are themselves in the public
   domain

You've got it almost right.  MacInHebrew was developed by
Dr. Joseph Weinstein and distributed by MIT Hillel
Foundation, 312 Memorial Drive, Cambridge, MA 02139.
Version 2.x was shareware ($25 requested); subsequent
versions are by license only ($65).  Alas, we stopped
shipping recently because the current version is not
compatible with the newest Mac systems or hardware.  We
have no current plans for an upgrade.

Users of MacInHebrew or parts thereof may indeed want to
make a donation to MIT Hillel, or at the very least to
acknowledge the organization in some way.

Subject: Yiddish summer camps

Kinder-Ring = Workmen's Circle
Kinderland = IWO and their inheritors
Kindervelt/Undzer Kemp = Farband
Hemshekh = Bund
Boyberik = Sholem-Aleichem Folk Institute
Camp Hofnung = Workmen's Circle (in Pennsylvania)

	to add a few.

Any in Canada?
