Subject: Viennese table

Being out of touch with the American people not only made
me lose in the elections, but I fell behind with Mendele as
well.

2.82#5  I am still not comfortable with Mr. Prager's joke
("Ich bin von hollandischen Adel" "??" "Ich bin von/van
drueben") I think, he is interpreting dripen correctly, and
the Dutch connection may come from the names of Holland:
Netherland, Niederland, Low-land, or, as Mr. Schachter from
Chicago pointed out, Pays-bas in French. I would suggest
that the joke could be transplanted into English, as "I am
an Australian aboriginal" "??" "I am from the land down
under" (bottom-land, that is). But to tell the truth, I am
still not happy with my explanation. I don't understand,
how could this joke laugh at the Galicianers, as Mr Prager
suggests, since Gs are the only ones to understand the pun.
Of course, I am a heretic, at least with regard to Freud's
theory about the use of jokes to express subconscious
emotions.

2.85#1  For M. Herzog, regarding initial Western Yiddish
"b" showing up as "p", not only in Yiddish but in certain
German dialects, examples: Bauer-poyer, butter-puter, etc.
(bretzel- pretzel) Probably, has to do more with
North-South rivalry, rather than West-East.

2.85#3 For Debra Biasca: Doesn't the Hebrew module of
Wordperfect reverse the cursor? I never saw it, just assume
so.

2.85#5 The Hebraist in me asks: Why did Hebrew Khurbn
become unpronounceable Khurbm in Yiddish? The word refers
to the destruction of Jewish communities in general, and
not specifically to genocide.

2.86#3 My name Itzik/Itzig not only rhymes with shpitzig,
but also with witzig, as in Tendlau's Sprichwoerter: "Der
Itzig ist witzig". Incidentally, my last name ends in a
samekh. (In Hungarian, unlike in Polish, sz is samekh, s is
shin.) Also, for Mr. Prager: Vunder oytser fun Yiddisher
shprakh by Yehuda Leb Zlotnick (a.k.a. Elzett/Avida) has a
section (I guess, part 2) on Yudishe maykholim and in it a
few pages on mashkes. More for Mr. Prager: Thanks for
correcting my pseudo-litvak "Deytshen" to Galitzianer
"Daytshen".

2.87#3 To end with my sarcasm: I am getting used to the
notion that Yiddish is a separate language, independent of
German, but I still find it interesting that the Elementary
Yiddish brochures were published by a Dept. of Hebrew and
Semitic Studies!

From: davism@turing.cs.nyu.edu
Subject: "foot" & "leg"

I'm moved to reply to Yankel Lantz because of my confusions
as a child. My parents (immigrants from Poland) spoke
Yiddish to one another and English to me. I grew up using
the English word "foot" to mean everything up to the knee.
By the time I was in high school I had learned "leg" but
when I began studying German, I learned "Beine" for "legs"
and became really confused because of the cognate Yiddish
word meaning "bones". I'll bet there's a Yiddish dialect in
which the German useage "beine" for legs prevails. Anyone?

Subject: Feet and legs

Yankel: Yiddish does not make a lexical distinction between
"feet" and "legs" (or, for that matter, between "fingers"
and "toes"). Hence, guard against translations of Yiddish
poems into English which proclaim the beauty of a young
woman's "feet" (of which there is no shortage;
translations, I mean).

A tzetl to the shames will remedy that in a hurry.
