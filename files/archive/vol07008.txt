Subject: "Es vi a porets"

Ruth Kleinman Etkin (7.004,3) remembers from her childhood that after
the last words of the benediction before sitting down to a meal --
"hamoytsi lekhem min haarets" -- her folks would add the words:  "es
vi a porets" [eat like a gentile landowner].

She wonders whether these Yiddish words were ever included at the end
of the brokhe.

The answer is no.  They were never included in the canon of this
benediction, and were certainly never meant to be included.

One minor but significant pronunciation correction:

In those days in Poland the Hebrew words of the brokhe were spoken the
Ashkenazic way and not in modern sephardic Hebrew.  The  last word
therefore sounded not ha'Arets, as she transcribes it in her post, but
_ha'Orerts_, with a komets-alef.

The rhyming factor of _ha'Orets_ and _pOrets_ was clearly predominant
in this family tradition, and not the riches of the porets.

Otherwise, why not say "es vi Rotshild," universally familiar among
Jews for his legendary riches?  But Rotshild lived far, far away, in a
different land, while a porets could occasionally be seen in shtetl
flaunting his wealth in a specially designed coach, pulled by three
muscular, well-groomed horses, with a driver and a footman to boot.
So the wealth of the porets was, so to speak, a visible one, and more
real than Rotshild's countless gold _dukatn_ that one could only talk
or imagine about...

Thus the ready rhyme and reality gained the primacy over dreaming...

However, the image of the porets among Jews was generally, by an
unspoken consensus, one who was habitually given to  overindulgence in
food and drink. Therefore, "es vi a porets" certainly did not mean in
a literal sense but rather:    Relax, take your time, chew well,
enjoy!

I gather it was a light-hearted within-family joke, causing smiles all
around, and a relaxed atmosphere.  A happy household!

Subject: Yiddish "Khad-gadyo" (was "Yiddish chad-gadya")

A belated bibliographical footnote to Itzkhok-Dovid Goldfein's inquiry
in 6.289.  Noyekh Prilutski's _Yidishe folkslider, ershter band_
(Warsaw:  Bikher-far-ale, 1911) contains two variants of "Shikt der
har..." (plus commentary), pp. 75-84 (##55-56).  There is also a
version, with additional references, in Shmuel Zanvel Pipe's _Yiddish
Folksongs from Galicia_, ed. Dov and Meir Noy, published in volume 2
of _Folklore Research Center Studies_ (Jerusalem:  The Hebrew
University, 1971), pp. 224-26 and 324 (#146).  Finally, the Mloteks'
column in the _Forverts_ for April 11 of this year contains
information about another Yiddish version of "Khad-gadyo."

Subject: "Papirosn"

In 4.094 there are comments by Sheldon Benjamin about the possible
Russian origins of the "Papirosn" melody, as well as my report of
information from the Bulgarian folklorist Professor Nikolai Kaufman,
who cites a Bulgarian song with the same melody as an example of songs
song to Romanian urban melodies and popularized in Bulgaria by the
circus _kupletist_ [singer of (usually satirical) cabaret songs]
Dzhib, whose real name was Iakob Goldshtain.  "The melody," Professor
Kaufman wrote, "like all his other melodies, came from Romania, his
birthplace. He came to Bulgaria around 1919....  Dzhib sang all his
songs to Romanian, or rather Romanian-Jewish melodies.... Yablokoff's
song 'Papirosn' [written in Kovno in 1922, but not popularized by
Yablokoff until some ten years later] probably had the same origin as
Dzhib's songs---his own text set to a familiar Romanian-Jewish
melody."

Subject: Going to a monastery

In Vol.  7.006 Dan Leeson  expresses remorse  (as he should  have) for
having paraded in  public his ignorance about  the continued existence
of Forverts in Yiddish.   He is to be praised for  the extreme form of
tshuve he imposes on himself by informing us of his intention of
joining a monastery.

        And the reason why I have chosen that one is that they have a
        resident rabbi, Charles Arian. [..] So I will start a small
        Yiddish club in the Abbey of New Clairvaux and your guilt will
        be unable to reach me there.

May  I warn  khaver  Leeson to  think  again before  he  makes a  life
commitment to the Abbey.  From what I have read, Rabbi Arian's stay at
the  monastery will  end this  summer,  and then  it might  be a  very
sparsely populated  Yiddish club.   Actually, while from  past contact
with Rabbi Arian I know that he has a pretty good command of Hebrew, I
am not sure that his Yiddish is so hot.  There are not too many arians
who speak Yiddish.

A gutn shabes,

Michael Shimshoni

Subject: The Forward

But--The Envelope, please

All things considered, the ribald content of Dan Leeson's first
fictional publication in the Fast Forward (May 16 issue), would give
one pause to think that he might take the Bard's advice, "Get thee to
a nunnery" in lieu of a monastery to start his Yiddish Club.

But--I think our Academy should present him with the golden Mendele
award for the funniest posting (7.006) in all the years I am part of
it.

I join in the dancing in the streets to celebrate the Forward's
centennial!  A blessing on Bob Rothstein's kepele for his appeal for
100 new subscriptions!

But--isn't there something deeply lacking in its new essence if a
reader like Leeson was unaware its mother publication, the Forverts,
is still alive, and lives right across the hall? The youthful editors
are truly Adler's "papirene kinder" that the Mloteks offered us. How
might they be educated to educate the Dan Leesons who are eager
students?

Subject: A very important announcement

Khosheve mendelistn:

Mendele is not only getting new shamosim; it's also getting a new
computer.  The venerable machine at Yale (remember it from the days
when we still used punch-cards?) has been replaced by a new one. And
it has a new, simpler address.

From now on, please send posts to:

        mendele@lists.yale.edu

Furthermore, _listserv_ is gone and has been replaced by _listproc_.

From now on, please send messages about change-of-address, etc. to:

        listproc@lists.yale.edu

For those interested in other possible commands, please have a look at

Subject: Mendele gets a web page

Despite much grumbling about the frivolous and gaudy nature of the
World Wide Web, it's become obvious to this cranky troglodite that
it's too useful a resource to ignore.  The Web is the perfect place
for storing and retrieving all manners of archival material: books,
bibliographies, photographs, and so on.  A naye velt!

So without shtiklekh a web page has been established at:

        http://www2.trincoll.edu/~mendele

There's nothing much on it as yet, but there are some interesting
plans afoot.  Leonard Prager and I have been conferring and I hope
that others will offer us their advice and counsel as things proceed.
Expect many changes.

As a _total_ ignoramus in the writing of web pages who shuns manuals
like the onshikenishn they are, nothing would have happened without
the advice and help of Iosif Vaisman, Refoyl Finkel and Bernard
Greenberg.  The latter is not only a musmakh in kompyuteray but a
dauntingly good editor.  My thanks to all.  Un a gut shabes aykh.
