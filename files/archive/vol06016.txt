Subject: In response to "Shul Daze"

In response to "Shul Daze" by Ruth Wisse, _New Republic_, May 27, 1996:

I can readily sympathize with Ruth Wisse's frustration with reporters
who hope that she will provide them with a glowing report on the state
of Yiddish, full of cute quotes they can use in a superficial, feel-good
article for the Sunday supplements. But I'm afraid I can't consider her
essay a balanced appraisal either.

Much of Prof. Wisse's essay is focused on extreme comparisons of no
direct relevance to the contemporary situation. Her main point is that
the immigrant generation had good reasons for placing its emphasis on
English. Of course. This is Sociology 101, as Joshua Fishman pointed out
in response to a stir Prof. Wisse created with similar remarks nearly
ten years ago (_Oyfn Shvel_ number 265, January-March 1987). But what
relevance, other than historical, does this have for generations raised
and educated in English?

Even less convincing is Prof. Wisse's attempt to raise the specter of
the separatist movement in Quebec. Does she really think there's a
danger that Brooklyn will secede from the union?

These comparisons seem to be an attempt to frame the discussion around
an implicit assumption that embracing Yiddish requires rejecting
English. That is, Prof. Wisse seems to want to convince us that there
are only two possibilities for the modern Jewish community: complete
linguistic assimilation, leaving Yiddish for academic specialists; or
political separatism a la Quebec. The only third alternative she
recognizes is the cultural isolationism of the Hasidic community.

But Prof. Wisse does not actually present arguments that alternatives
are not possible; she simply presumes it. Joshua Fishman asks, in the
article mentioned above:

"Vos hot bikhlal dos oyfhitn di eygene shprakh un kultur tsu ton mit
ayngelebtkeyt in amerike un gut-bruderishkeyt mit amerike un aroyfarbetn
zikh in amerike? Tsi zenen den tsveyshprakhikeyt un tsvey-kulturishkeyt
take ummeglekhe, nit-vikhtike tsi ummoralishe aspiratsyes?" (_Oyfn
Shvel_, no. 265, page 3)

'What does preserving one's own language and culture have to do with
being at home in America, affection for America, becoming successful in
America? Are bilingualism and biculturalism impossible, unimportant or
immoral aspirations?'

Prof. Wisse takes it for granted that the answer is yes; Prof. Fishman,
a prominent figure in sociolinguistics, does not.

Touching briefly on the current situation, Prof. Wisse points out that
the primary mission of the National Yiddish Book Center is to save books
that would otherwise be consigned to the trash, and she asks
rhetorically if this can be considered a revival. In and of itself, of
course not. But it may well be part of a revolution in popular
attitudes.

To take a serious look at the significance of the Book Center, we have
to take into consideration the change it represents. Twenty years ago
those books were being sent to the incinerator. Worse yet, they were
being sent with the tacit understanding, by all concerned, that there
was no point in saving them because no one could possibly be interested
in them. The Book Center entered the scene too late for many items of
physical culture, but at the right time to catch the wave of change that
made its success possible. Its enormous success is paralleled by the
success of Klezmer music, and by the upswing in popular events focused
on Yiddish whose target audience is _not_ exclusively elderly.

I would attempt to summarize the on-going change in attitude as follows:
there is a growing appreciation in the Jewish community of the fact that
our immigrant ancestors were not all ignorant clods; that behaving in a
civilized manner does not require us to ignore their culture or to
ridicule it; and that even as well- educated English speakers thoroughly
immersed in modern American (or Canadian, etc.) culture we can enrich
our lives by incorporating elements of their culture.

How much change has there actually been? After all, the current upsurge
is far from a mass movement. Furthermore, in some circles the 'new'
attitudes are nothing new. By no means do I intend to deny the major
difficulties Yiddish still faces outside of the Hasidic community.
Nevertheless, my perception is that the change in attitude in Jewish
community over the last ten or fifteen years has been quite significant.
Certainly this is something that any appraisal of the current state of
Yiddish in America needs to take into consideration.

Prof. Wisse's essay seeks to reinforce the traditional attitude that
Yiddish is something the general public is better off without. I think I
see signs that this traditional attitude may be on its way to becoming
old-fashioned. In any case, it is fortunate that Prof. Wisse's stance
does not keep her from serving as a resource to those who do not see
speaking Yiddish as a threat to their standing as English speakers.

Subject: In response to "Shul Daze"

May I add my two cents worth of comment about a one-cent article?

Ruth Wisse's title "Shul Daze" is a feeble pun heading a feeble article
which exudes an authoritarian air.  By that I mean she speaks as though
ex cathedra.  That is revealed in her statement that reference to her
academic post reminds her that she is not being paid to lie.  Neither am
I.  So what? That clothes no one in a cloak of infallibility.

She does advance important facts.  Then she blithely ignores other
relevant facts (that Yiddish is not, in fact, dead) to cover the
emptiness of her thesis.

The question tackled doesn't exist.  It matters not whether she believes
that there can be a Yiddish revival or renaissance (whatever those terms
mean). After all, her power to predict the future is equal to mine:
absolute zero. It does matter, however, that she dismisses in an offhand
sentence the towering achievements of the National Yiddish Book Center
as though it doesn't matter that so many great Yiddish books were
rescued from trash.  I am grateful to have a number of them, and she
probably does, too.  As a matter of fact, she cites trashing Yiddish
books as evidence of linguistic decline (but does it with a snide,
gratuitously sarcastic tone).  Further, her tone seems to trash the
value of Yiddish work today.  Perhaps she follows the adage: if you
can't lick 'em, join 'em.  I was irritated, not by her facts, but the
pathetic air of unwarranted certainty.

Subject: Shver

"Shver" (father-in-law) and "shver" (heavy, difficult) are unrelated.
The former comes from the now defunct German "Schwdher" (the umlaut may
not look right on all screens) which denoted a number of in-law
relations, father-in-law among them.  The latter goes back to "schwer",
which means the same in Yiddish and German.  Puns that draw on the
homonymy are just that.

Subject: Michael Rozenberg, Yiddish singer

I am seeking information on Michael Rozenberg, a Yiddish singer and
actor born c. 1900.  One of his recordings was the song "Shepsl
Kanarik."

Thanks.
