Subject: Joe and Paul's glok, glock

On Fred Sherman's query:  I'm sure that what the speaker is saying on that old
naughty Barton Brothers record is _globt mir_, 'believe me'.  _globn_ appears
to be a regional variant of _gloybn_ 'believe' (which Weinreich frowns upon,
preferring _gleybn_ for the verb.) 

Another song of the Barton Brothers, "Cockeye Jenny", contains what in younger
days I thought of as the funniest macaronic couplet imaginable. 

        _Ire fislekh un ire zokn_,
         I tell you, people, it's no use talk'n'...

Taste-shmaste.

Subject: introduction

Hello

I'm Michael Simon, living in London.  I am a barrister (lawyer), a chazan and
a chossid of the Bostoner Rebbe Shlita. 

My Yiddish is far from fluent, but I'm anxious to improve it all the time.

Subject: A question on transliteration of "evil eye"

A short story I wrote is will appear as part of the Chicekn Soup series, or
more specifically, "Jewish Chicken Soup for the Soul." 

Anyway, the story is about the proper ribbon color for use in eliminating the
influence of a powerful but negative force; i.e., the evil eye.  Now the story
is in English but I want to use the Yiddish word for evil eye because the
setting for the story is in a home for the Jewish aged. 

The question is how to spell it.  Is it "ahara," "ahora," "ohara,"  etc.? 
Actually, it is not a question of spelling so much as it is a question of
transliteration.  So where else does go with a question like this?  To
Mendele, that's where.

2 questions: 1) What can you, Mendelyaner, tell me about the the meaning of
"grisheh"?
            
2) Who can suggest a good "Yiddish-English/English-Yiddish Dictionary only in
Transliteration". Among the 175 members from my Yiddisher "Briv
Fraynd"(Pen-Pals) club, there are some "beginners" in yidish, who want to
write, practice and learn Yiddish, and they want to write letters to their
selected new friends but they need to assist themselves sometimes and consult
a dictionary, so they ask: "WHICH ?", Which "Yiddish-English/English-Yiddish
Dictionary only in Transliteration"  do you, Mendelyaners, recommend?  Did you
hear about the Hippocrene Practical Dictionary from David C. Gross?  What do
you think about it? I haven't had the opportunity to see it. 

Miht yiddisheh grusn(greetings) un mayneh besteh vuntshn(wishes) far ah

Subject: Survival of Yiddish

Some time ago, when there was a spate of discussions on Mendele about the
survival of Yiddish, I submitted a message which said that the Internet can
function as the "gahs" which is referred to in the expression "ah loshn muz
hobn ah gahs".  This expression implies that this is a requirement for Yiddish
to survive and thrive.  I think I also pointed out that the surviving form of
Yiddish may be different from what we were used to in the past. 

Now I would like to call attention to an article in the current, April, issue
of the AARP Bulletin which describes the views of futurist Nicholas Negroponte
who is the founder and director of the MIT Media Laboratory.  In it he says
that with the new technology everyone will be wired to everyone else.  The new
"smart" machines will change every aspect of our lives from the way we work to
the way we communicate and relate to friends and loved ones.  Let me quote: 

"Not just a revolution about receiving information differently, '[It's] really
about how you are going to live,' Negroponte says.  'What is community?  What
is family?  And what does it mean to be part of a community?'

"The digital revolution is providing a new answer, he claims, pointing out
that community today is defined less by physical proximity than by electronic
proximity....'We're going to live much more connected lives'." 

It seems to me that the implications for strenghtening the future bonds of the
Jewish community world wide are quite obvious.  This same strengthening effect
should also apply to the world of Yiddish and to the Yiddish language.  It is
interesting to note that on the World Wide Web, in the site entitled "Der
Bavebter Yid", there is an editorial by Sholem Berger and Refoyl Finkel which
expresses similar thoughts about cyberspace and our physical world. 

Let the debate continue!

Subject: Women/Ladies in American Yiddish

A friend of mine is doing research on women in American Jewish organizations
in the 1920s and 1930s.  Her work necessarily includes Yiddish sources and she
has come across something that sounds slightly strange, so she asked me to
relay the following question to Mendele.  Do you think it is odd that a
Yiddish-speaking American socialist organization would use the English
"ladies"?  For example, "di froyen in dem leydis klub" -- please excuse the
transliteration.  Any comment on how Yiddish-speaking socialists used "damen",
"froyen" and "ladies" in their Yiddish would be appreciated.
