Subject: A great underrtaking by the N.Y.B.C.

The National Yiddish Book Center, Amherst, MA, in a pioneering
collaboration with station KCRW/Santa Monica, CA, the largest public
radio station in the country, is producing a series of 13 one-hour radio
shows featuring Yiddish and other Jewish stories in English translation,
read by well-known Hollywood actors and scheduled for broadcast in the
United States and throughout the English-speaking world.

The stories include work by Sholem Aleykhem, Yitskhok-Leybush Perets,
Isaac Babel, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Cynthia Ozick, Philip Roth, and
others.

Thirty six (lamed-vov?) stars of film, stage, and television have signed
on as readers.  Among them: Alan Alda, Lauren Bacall, Claire Bloom,
Fyvush Finkel, Jeff Goldbloom, Elliot Gould, Walter Matthau, Rhea
Perlman.  The host of the entire series is Leonard Nimoy (the famous Mr.
Spock in the sci-fi television series "Star Trek").

It is hoped that the series will have its American debut on National
Public radio during the last week of July l995.

Subject: Manfred Lemm in Concert (Toronto)

On Thursday, May 18, 1995 at 8:00 p.m., at the Leah Posluns Theatre in
Toronto, Manfred Lemm will sing Yiddish Songs by Mordechai Gebirtig.

This concert is being host jointly by the Holocaust Remembrance
Committee, the Committee for Yiddish of the Jewish Federation of Greater
Toronto, and the Goethe-Institute.

Many of you are familiar with Manfred Lemm.  Born in Germany in 1946, he
has dedicated himself to reviving and performing Yiddish folk songs, most
of which were created by Jews who perished in the Holocaust.  He is also
the initiator and organizer of the European Yiddish Festival (Zurich,
Cracow, Leverkusen), and is credited with having the works of Gibirtig
from the fate of oblivion. (Do I know--I am copying straight from the
publicity!)

Tickets are $10.00.  Student groups will receive free admission, but must
call ahead to reserve their seats.

Please contact Sylvia Lustgarten at the Committee for Yiddish of the
Jewish Federation of Greater Toronto, 635-2883, or the Goethe-Institut,
924-3327.

Or, contact me.

I am curious about a person of German background who would be so
interested in Yiddish.

As always, kol tuv.

Subject: Misha Alexandrovich in Concert (Boston)

An interesting opportunity to see Misha Alexandrovich, a great old-time
khasn with a vast Yiddish repertoire.

We plan an interview with Alexandrovitch in Yiddish on my upcoming radio
show, The Yiddish Voice, Weds., May 10, 7:30-8:30 on WUNR 1600 AM
(Brookline, MA).

Some notes from the flyer I just received:

Sunday, May 14 at 3 p.m., John Hancock Hall, 180 Berkley St., Boston.
Copley Station on the T.

"Sacred Music; Jewish, Russian, and Italian Songs"

"Mikhail Alexandrovich -- the best Jewish singer of Russia. He reached
audiences of millions in the USSR, performing on the radio, in concert,
becoming one of the country's best loved lyric tenors. He made 70
recordings in Yiddish, Russian, and Italian."

Tickets available through Israel Bookshop, and for delivery, call
783-5323.

Kol Tov,
