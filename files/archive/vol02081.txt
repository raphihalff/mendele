Does anyone know the origin of the Yiddish name
"peshe/pesye/pesl"?

Mikhl Herzog

Subject: forverts online?

Nu, the Forverts online is more than I would even dare hope
for, at present, but I would hope I could at least get a
hold of all or most of the last 95 years' worth of issues
on microfilm?  How could I do this, preferably without
leaving the Boston area?

Would you happen to have addresses (BITNET or otherwise)
for the following:

	Buchen, Irving
	Gladsky, Thomas
	Irving, Malin
	Leviant, Curt
	Saposnik, Irving S
	Slotnick, Susan
 
I would also appreciate it if you could announce through
your channels a conference in London (at University College
London) on Bashevis Singer, 29-31 March 1993.  Anyone
wishing to read a paper should contact me. Accommodation in
London is provided for participants reading papers, and
some travel grants are available.
 
Thank you.  Mark Geller

Subject: Germans in Yiddish literature

Dvosye Bilik asks (Vol2.79) for instances of Germans
appearing in Yiddish literature.  I have one sure, one
maybe.

1. J.J. Trunk's Poyln (Vol.3).  Most of this portion of
Trunk's memoirs deals with the rapid growth of Lodz as a
textile center. Many if not most of the original weavers
were Germans and Trunk mentions them throughout, among
other things comparing their "tidy" homes with those in the
Jewish quarter.

2. I.J. Singer's Fun a Velt Vos Iz Mer Nishto.  Singer
mentions the German residents of a nearby village who
showed up at the larger fairs.  I'm not absolutely sure
about this one.

*******

I wonder if anyone would care to write a more definitive
piece about Trunk's Poyln.  It may not be the best-written
book in the literature but it's absolutely fascinating.
Maybe a (severely edited) translation is in order?

Noyekh
