Subject: Oysdrucken

Having recently returned from a great week at Mt. Holyoke College in
Mass. with 170 or so fellow "Yiddishite" from around the world, at the
Nation Yiddish Book Center "camp", I have a deeper appreciation and
understanding of Mendele. This is not the format to tell you all about
that most memorable week, however, it was a week I will always remember.
The faculty, the staff and the participants were the finest! Now to the
biz. at hand. Yiddishe oysdrucken (expressions), when translated to
English verbatim generally don't make good sense. (Hak mir nisht a
tchaynik, etc.) I think that they are ment to indicate a mood, a feeling,
an endorsement, a curse, etc. in the stongest manner possible. Their
origins are steeped in things like religious ritual, fear of or respect
for Gd, local custom, local events, play on words, and other sometimes
irrational reasons. It is therefore better, I think  to translate them,
and then accept them for what they mean and leave the "analysis" alone.

Yankel (or Yankl) Lantz, I feel had the best explaination in,"in spite of
everything you do, it still comes out wrong". Now, can anyone give me the
translation as well as the "where used" of the work khotch"

There is a song called '"Papirosn" (cigarette in Russian) in which that
is used.

Subject: Children's rhymes

In a recent posting, Zellig Bach offered several examples of children's
rhymes as mild verbal aggression: "Beylke, host dayn fatsheylke?" ...
"Ma'le, Ma'le, ven verstu a ka'le?" ...  "Zay nit kayn Meyer der dreyer"
...  "AvrEml, vos hostu in dayn kreml?"

Sholom Aleichem offers other examples in _The Great Fair_, saying the
city children didn't know how to do these: "Leibel-Kapeibel sits on a
table, lives in a stable in the land of Kababel.  Jake Kapake is a fake,
always eats cake in the land of Kabake.  Moses-Kaposes snores when he
doses, sitting on roses in the land of Kaboses...."

They all bring back memories of stories my grandfather made up for me,
and many years later, stories I made up for my son with some of the same
names.

Subject: Komets alef

Not too long ago, I was present at a wonderful event in which some
adorable children performed the song "Afn pripetshik" (variously
pronounced [ofn] and [pripetshok]).  Being too young to understand what
the song narrates and what many of the words mean, what was heard in
their versions of the song was:

zogt zhe kinderlekh, gedenkt zhe tayere
vos ir lernt do
zogt zhe nkh a mol un take nokh a mol
komets alef beys [sic]

and

zolt ir fun di oysyes koyekh shlepn [sic]
kukt in zey arayn.

(As if it were necessary, I placed the symbol "[sic]" by the mistakes the
kids made.  As things look, I wouldn't be surprised if Mendele were to
get a correspondence to the effect that these versions are indeed the
ones sung in _somebody's_ neighborhood.)

As for *adults* who are **fluent, native speakers of Yiddish**, the
expression is _shepn nakhes_.  Those who come from "di zelber gegend" are
obviously not reliable sources for *Yiddish* (although they may be
reliable sources for passive Yiddish or memories of Yiddish) -- in fact,
anybody who utters the *feminine* definite article followed by an
adjective inflected for the *masculine* is obviously not a reliable
speaker of the language.  Those of us who are native speakers of English
would immediately deem the utterer of the following sentence non-native
and not reliable as a source for learning Engllish:  "John no go home."
Speaking Yiddish in this way qualifies you as *familiar* with the
language, but not a reliable speaker or native speaker of the language.
It is not your fault if this is the case; it's just a fact about the
language you grew up to be proficient in -- which is apparently not
Yiddish.

Subject: Yiddish nowadays

Noyekh Miller writes that "bad Yiddish abounds and in surprising places".
He then gave some examples of a 'Boro Parknik' he had encountered on the
Net.

May I add my own insight.

Chasidic and Chareidi Jews are nowadays the largest group of users of the
Yiddish language. There are thousands of children in these communities
whose first and sometimes only language is Yiddish. This has allowed the
language to evolve and to adapt to all its modern usages. They have
maintained the warmth and personal nature of the language and new phrases
and idioms are constantly being creatd. Their grammar may not be up to
Sholem Aleichem's yiddish but they have nevertheless preserved the
language not merely in a historical sense but as a live ongoing tongue.

Whilst lists like these discuss the finer points of the language and
revolve around literature and arts one constantly gets the feeling that
it is all in a rather nostalgic, historical and aesethic way. All the
scholarly discussions of the language do not make up for a few weeks of
buying, selling, loving, hating, laughing, crying, phoning, faxing,
blessing, cursing all in mameloshn. In England people are not expected
to use Jane Austen's English so why should a kheder boy be reqiuired to
use Peretz's Yiddish.

May I finish with this. If this world is ever to see again the likes of
Sholem Aleichem or Peretz I think he is more likely to be kheder/yeshiva
educated than high school/university.
