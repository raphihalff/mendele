Yes, ikh hob af dir faribl = 'I'm upset/displeased with
you, you've offended me'.  The word is not a negative
polarity item, i.e., it doesn't need to appear alongside a
negative.  It may be used in an affirmative sentence.

reb yude-leyb:  what is the pronunciation of _parech_?  If
[parekh], then it's from Yiddish parkh (regionally
pronounced [parx, parex] 'head scab; S.O.B. (male only, I
think)'.  The derogatory epithet of Yiddish-speakers (and
their Mod. Heb.-speaking progeny) for Sephardim is dokh
_frenk par(e)kh_.  Is this the same word?

I wasn't clear in my note about the Bund.  There was a
Yugntbund (Bundist youth organization) in the US (and
elsewhere?) until the most recent decades (in the 70's
definitely; into the eighties?)  And Camp Hemshekh was of
the Bund (closed in early '80's, methinks).  Anyone with
more (and more precise) info.?

Does anyone know the lyrics to the song "Rumenye" which
Aaron Lebedeff was famous for singing?  Or does anyone know
where they are printed?  A dank in foroys.

In re "skotsl kumt":

    In vol. 17, no. 2 (Dec. 1957) of _Yidish shprakh_ Yudel
Mark answered an inquiry about the expression as follows
[in my translation]:   "The greeting _skotsl kumt_, with
which one primarily greets a dear female guest (although
one could in certain cases say the same words to or about a
man), has intrigued many people.  All sorts of hypotheses
have been put forward about the origins of the expression
and a number of folk etymologies have been created.  The
most widespread are: (1) "gots viln kumt," as an allusion
to the women's blessing "sheosani kirtsono"; (2) "eyshes
kotsin kumt."  It was also suggested that it comes from the
German expressions:  _sei Gotts willkommen_ and _das Heil
Gottes kommt_.  The great Jewish philologist Dr. Alfred
Landau showed that the expression comes from a Middle High
German greeting formula: _bis gote (unde mir) wilkom_, or
for short, _bis (mir) gote wilkumen_.  Alfred Landau also
cites dialect forms: in the Swabian dialect, _bis got
wilke_; in Regensburg and generally in Bavarian German,
_gotlkum_; in an area of Moravia, _skolkuom_; in Silesia,
_skodlkomt_.  (For more details, see _Yidishe filologye_,
1924, pp. 336-334.)"

Re:  Bob Goldberg's request.

1) To keep an eye on = akhtig gebn.
Gib akhtig oyf di kinder zey zoln gurnisht zebrekhn.

Also hiitn = keep an eye on.
Hiit up di kinder zey roln kholile nisht krank weren.
hiit up = gib achtig.

2) Veil:  Gib achtig oyf di kinder veil (because) ikh muz
geyn zim Shoykhet.

Du kenst oyfmakhen dus Fenster veil di kinder Shlufen.
(veil - while).

3) Veil sounds right in the sentence "Konikh gey arop in
keler veil du bist in kikh".

4) Take care of = Di mime hot untz gehitn - or better - hot
oyf untz akhtig gegebn.

              TENDENTIOUS POSTCARD CAPTION
 
A picture postcard of Mea Shearim published by Palphot of
Herzlia, Israel, carries the English caption: "Jerusalem -
At Mea Shearim Quarter / Extreme Religious Jewish Quarter."
The Hebrew caption is neutral and translates the first half
of the English caption. -.Extreme-. is quite a loaded
descriptor and hardly appropriate for a postcard.  Most of
these "extremists," incidentally, speak Yiddish, which
obviously only an extremist would. *****
 
   AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS OF YIDDISH
 
This association (which in Yiddish calls itself "Amerikaner
farband fun yidish-profesorn"), with headquarters at Queens
College, CUNY, Flushing, New York 11367, USA, publishes the
English-language journal _Yiddish_ and a newsletter. It is
alluded to (and perhaps immortalized?) by the British
novelist and critic, David Lodge, in his brilliant comic
romance, _Small World_ (London: Secker and Warburg, 1984).
Describing the social amenities which are inseparable from
the scholarly sessions at the annual convention of the
Modern Languages Association of America, Lodge writes: "You
can attend the cocktail party by the Gay Caucus for the
Modern Languages, or the Reception Sponsored by the
American Association of Professors of Yiddish, or the Cash
Bar Arranged in Conjunction with the Special Session on
Methodological Problems in Monolingual and Bilingual
Lexicography...." (p. 314)  There are professors of Yiddish
in America, and some of them belong to the above
association (not all of whose members can read Yiddish --
many teach Yiddish literature in translation).  Lodge's
collocation here (only part of the list) of gays, Yiddish
professors and lexicographers (known as harmless drudges)
was, perhaps, random.  Yet to many people the words
"Professor of Yiddish" sounds like "Professor of Graffiti"
or "Instructor in Underworld Slang."  In short, it sounds
incongruous, but only to those with misconceptions and
prejudices regarding the language. ******
 
            JEWISH MOOD CUBE (Ludic Yiddish Revisited)
 
One of the many expressions of the vulgarization of Yiddish
in our day is the proliferation of "gimmick" objects which
exploit sentimental cliches commercially.  The customers
for these items may even be under the impression that there
is Jewish cultural value to owning them.

One American entrepreneur has concocted a "Jewish mood
cube," each of whose four sides is inscribed with a Yiddish
expression of the sort which persons who might know very
little Yiddish would recognize immediately.  The principle
of the cube is that of the _dreydl_, known to all Jewish
children from the celebration of Chanuka.  The _dreydl_, or
top, has four sides, each of which is marked by the first
letter of significant words (Nes godol hoyo shom) 'A great
miracle occured there', the letters nun, gimel, hey and
shin traditionally standing for the Yiddish words nem
'take', gib 'give', halb 'half' and shtey 'stand'.  A "pot"
of hickory nuts or pennies or some other desired prize is
shared out according to one's luck at turning the top.  The
same notion of four various fates is present in the
presumably amusing "Jewish mood cube."

David Gold has called attention to the "ludic" function of
Yiddish, a function he finds characteristic of declining
languages.  The words on the cube, which I give as spelled
there, are _farblonjet_ 'lost', _tsuris_ 'troubles', _a
mechaieh_ 'feels good' (exclamation), _oy vay!_ 'good God!'
or 'help!' (exclamation).  The manufacturers (Colton-Lewis)
of the "fun" cube tried to represent the sounds of the
words as they are spoken in Jewish English, where they are
current. The correct transcription is farblonzhet, tsoris,
a mekhaye, oy vey!

Tsuris is a legitimate variant and the spellings, while not
scientific, do somewhat help the ordinary person in
recognizing the words.  The manner in which they are
actually pronounced would depend on a number of factors,
principally on the speaker's distance from spoken Yiddish.

The word farblonzhet, it is interesting to note, is
regarded as a "funny" word per se. It is derived from a
germanic prefix and a slavic stem, but is felt to be
uniquely Yiddish.  It is that, but those who react to the
word as comic per se are delimiting the word's meaning as a
native speaker would not.  This is not to deny that the
word farblonzhet often crops up in Yiddish in humourous
contexts.  Trivial though the cube is in itself, it tells
us something about the way isolated lexemes in a declining
language are selected for survival.  All the four terms of
the cube are affect terms, three of them negative and one
positive.

The acculturated children of East European immigrants are
perhaps less emotionally candid in certain respects than
their less cultivated parents, who spoke a language rich in
exclamations and expletives. Each of the four terms in
question have particular phonotactile features and are
normally spoken with distinct expression, accompanied by
facial and other movement. The two exclamations in
particular are virtually sung and dramatized when used
conversationally.  Such words, therefore, are hard to
forget and hard to give up, since they do not have felt
equivalents in English.

At the same time the cube may be mocking typical emotional
outbursts of the immigrant generation and the tendency for
frightened people to panic needlessly in moments of
apparent difficulty.  The cube is thus also self-directed
in-group humour.  It could also be skirting a psychological
truth, which might explain why otherwise sensitive people
have bought this toy.
