Does anyone know about the book "Froyen in di getos," printed 1946, ed. L.
Shpizman, put out by Pionern Froyen Organizatsie?

Subject:  khaven

What does "khaven" mean in the following?

In our story, a German torpedo is heading directly for the ship.  The
author then writes: "ale lebedike bashefenishn af ir [der shif] hot es
ufgevekt.  ale hobn genumen loyfn un khaven.  ale hobn bagrifn az men kemft
farn lebn." (The word is spelled "khaven", and since the orthography is
old, it might really be "khavn."  However, since it seems to be a Slavism,
my assumption is that it is "khaven," as spelled.)

Subject: "Gits arayn a nekhomele"

I've been asked to forward the following query to the list:

Does anyone know the correct text for the Yiddish ditty, usually appended
to Or zarua la-tsadik:

Gits arayn a nekhomele
in a yidishe neshomele

The above is what I remember from my youth.

Another version I have seen is:

Gits arayn, oy, nekhomelekh
in a yidishe neshomele

A friend questioned gits arayn and thought it should be gist aryan, i.e.
pour, but I distinctly remember gits. I always thought it was derived from
gebn rather than gisn. But then Weinreich has gist under gebn, which is
puzzling.

Someone else questioned yidishe, pointing out that it should be yidish
(sing?), but again I distinctly remember yidishe (maybe it's just needed to
scan).

Or maybe its nekhomelekh in yidishe neshomelekh.

Any light that can be shed on this puzzle would be appreciated.

Subject:  Wedding invitations in Yiddish

I am getting married in August and am diligently trying to work out some
details. Our invitations are going to be in English, Yiddish and Hebrew.
Whereas we have some ideas as to the wording of the Hebrew and English
texts, we don't know how Yiddish invitations were typically written. Can
anyone give us an idea of how a Yiddish wedding invitation would have been
worded?
