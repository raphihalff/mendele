Subject: Yiddish and Haredim

I'd like to add a p.s. to Miriam Isaacs eminently reasonable response to the
discussion here on Yiddish and Haredim. Depending on one's method of dating,
Yiddish is between 700 and 1000 years old. The percentage of that time when
it was blessed with the likes of Mendele, Sholem Aleichem, Manger, etc is
*very very small*. If the past 125 years saw a flowering of Yiddish
literature, it was only at the end of nearly a millenium of Yiddish as *the
language of a group not unlike the Haredim*. I wonder how many of the
Yiddish writers that we all respect so much were read by their own parents!
So, if the super-orthodox kept it going all that time until their children,
the 'secularists', created the literature you valorize, presumably they can
do it again (tho probably not in our lifetime).

The future of Yiddish depends *only* on whether there are children growing
up speaking it as their mother tongue, within a *Yiddish* speech community
-- which is what the haredim, and only the haredim, are providing.  How they
spell 'undzer' and what they think of the Goldfadens, the Singers, the
Weinreichs et al is so irrelevant to the issue as to be laughable.

Subject: Haredi literature

Sholem Berger writes, "Haredi and secular Yiddish literature do differ. Not
in quality -- I would venture to say that dross dominates among the
veltlekhe just as much as among the Haredi (perhaps less so in poetry)." 

A question - the issue for me wouldn't be whether dross is more common than
gold in both repertories;  it would be where the gold is, and how fine. That
is - what are the works of haredi Yiddish literature that are up there with
Bergelson and Chaim Grade?

Subject: Haredim and Yiddish

Regarding the Blumberg/Heschel exchange on the Haredim and Yiddish, it seems
to me painfully obvious that Blumberg is deliberately, ideologically blind
to anything positive that might emerge from the Orthodox world, even if its
net result will be the virtual salvation of Yiddish. There is no doubt that
the genres, styles and forms of Yiddish writing in the Haredi world are
experiencing an unprecedented expansion. Not only is there an explosion of
Yiddish journalism and belletristic literature. The Haredim are even engaged
in genres that until very recently were considered completely trayf,
including historiography. 

To cite one example. The last published book in English translation by the
Israeli historian Jacob Katz ("A House Divided", Brandeis University Press,
1998) dealt with the radical split of Hungarian Jewry into Neolog, Status
Quo and Orthodox movements. I reviewed it for the English Forward and stated
that it is the first full, book-length study of this topic ever published.

Alas, I was wrong. As I discovered while browsing in a Sforim store in
hasidic Montreal last summer, a year before Katz's book appeared in English,
a Yiddish volume, entitled "Di Shpaltung in Ungarn" was published
anonymously in Brooklyn, dealing with the exact same themes as those handled
by Katz. Yes, it is a highly polemical and clearly biased account of the
history of mid-19th century Hungarian Jewry, but it contains all of the
basic historical facts, names and dates, and is not that much worse, or more
slanted, than much of the Zionist-oriented Jewish historiography produced by
generations of professional, university based, Israeli historians.

It is quite evident to me that these new tendencies in Haredi Yiddish
literature reflect the fact that, for all their isolationism, they are aware
of, sensistive and reactive to, trends in the wider Jewish society.  Rather
than "makhn avek mit di hent", those concerned with the very survival of
Yiddish should celebrate this unexpected phenomenon.

Subject: Abraham Brumberg on Yiddish

I'd like to comment on several points made by Abraham Brumberg in his latest
contribution (09.041). It appears that he went too far in his ardent
dismissal of Soviet Yiddish. 

He claims that "gradually parents began to realize that the future for their
children lies not in the Yiddish schools, but in the Belorussian, Ukrainian
and - primarily - Russian". This is exactly how Soviet authorities
substantiated the closure of Jewish schools (that's right, they were called
Jewish) in 1939 and then in 1948. This statement reflects a thoroughly
superficial awareness of the situation and has nothing to do with reality.
Jewish parents did prefer to send their children to study in their native,
and often only (at age 7), language - as one can tell from all available
statistics (cf. Charles Fuchsman, 09.037). Moreover, the enrollment was
usually automatic without extensive inquiry into the parental preferences.
And finally, Jewish schools were regarded highly precisely in terms of the
children's future perspectives, so that significant number of gentile
children was sent by their parents to study in Yiddish. Unlike many other
national schools in the USSR, graduates of Jewish schools had an opportunity
to further their education in numerous technical schools and university
departments in Yiddish as the language of instruction (even compared with
Belorussian and Ukrainian). If one seeks a first-hand information - one
should contact Khaim Beyder, a current editor of Di Tsukunft, who graduated
from one of the Odessa University Yiddish departments.  When the schools
were abruptly closed, children were transferred to primarily Ukrainian and
Belorussian, but not Russian, facilities. 

"When they started, they had the full help, financial and otherwise, from
the state (that is, the republican governments )". All schools in the USSR
were public, maintained by the state (and not the quite nominal republican
governments). 

"Yiddish schools were gradually denuded of Jewish content".  Has anyone
decreed what is "Jewish content"? Do you mean that being based on communist
ideology denuded Jewish schools of their Jewish content?  And by analogy -
Russian schools of their Russian content? Then what content were they left
with? (Sounds absurd, ah?) All subjects (algebra, physics, chemistry,
geography, etc.) were taught exclusively in Yiddish, with strong preparation
in classical and contemporary Yiddish (and not only) literature (see Charles
Fuchsman, 09.037, for by far incomplete list of mandatory authors).

This may, of course, be argued, but "dehebraization" of Soviet Yiddish -
above any other considerations - pursued rather utilitarian, as opposed to
ideological, ends. In its "revolutionary spirit" it reflected the
orientation on spoken language, which wasn't nearly as loshn-koydesh-laden
as the written one. The same processes were taking place in Russian and
other languages of the land. As far as I know, some publications in America
and Romania followed similar orthography. 

As "castrated" Russian literature still managed to produce the likes of
Babel, Bulgakov, Pasternak, Platonov, Sholokhov, Brodsky, Bakhtin -
"castrated" Yiddish literature, in its own right, churned out Izi Kharik,
Moyshe Altman, Yankl Yakir, Elye Shekhtman, Yankev Shternberg, Ikhil
Shraybman, Yosef Kerler, Lev Berinsky, etc., etc. Tolstoys they may not have
been, but were they in any sense less talented than their fully virile
Western counterparts? If one tends to collectively negate them, it's purely
a matter of literary taste (or rather distaste) or ignorance. This
literature held certain prominence in the Soviet literary milieu:  I can
hardly think of any other Yiddish belles-lettres as much translated as Leyb
Kvitko and Shike Driz (Bashevis incl.) - literally millions of children in
the USSR grew up with their children's poetry, and Sholem-Aleykhem was a
must for any Russian envisioning himself a part of intelligentsia. The
tragedy is - as Mr.Fuchsman put it - in the continuous oppression and
destruction of anything Jewish in that part of the world, but to put blame
on the victims is near-sighted, to say the least.

Subject: "Yiddish neighbourhood" in Buenos Aires

There is no such a neighbourhood in Buenos Aires today. Years ago use to be
Once, or Villa Crespo, but today young generations dont speak yiddish
anymore. One can listen to a "yiddish vort" at the IWO (YIVO) premises at
Ayacucho 483.

Subject: Abraham Shulman

I should like to thank Yaakov Dovid Shulman for his moving and informative
eulogy to his father , ABRAHAM SHULMAN, the Yiddish writer.  I wish Mr
Shulman 'Long Life'. 

Could he possibly publish in Mendele one or more of his father's humorous
pieces? 

I should also like to ask him, when he feels able to, to explain the
reference to "Yaacov Dovid: a well-known Amshinov name".  My own paternal
grandfather was Yaakov Dovid. I have never heard of the Amshinovs, and would
be grateful for some information about them.  He might be kind enough to
write to me direct, if this is not suitable for Mendele. 

Thank you.

Subject: Yosl Cotler

A wonderful book entitled "muntergang" by Yosl Cotler ("Yosel Cutler" in
1934 Library of Congress transliteration) has fallen into my hands.  It has
interesting stories and exceptionally beautiful and ingenious illustrations,
also by the author.  I know that Yosl Cotler was, among other things, a
puppet-maker and puppeteer, and also that he died in an automobile accident
in the 1930s.  But that's the extent of my knowledge. 

Does anyone know any more about him?  Can anyone steer me in the direction
of biographical materials concerning this artist? 

A sheynem dank!

Subject: Lullabye

A friend is searching for a lullabye in which the mother laments that the
baby must think that night is day.  The birds, the rooster, the shepherd
have all gone to sleep; only the baby is awake.  My friend is looking for
both the Yiddish and the English versions.

Subject: Pious Voices - correction

This is a follow up.I had posted a notice about the publication of the
journal issue entitled Pious Voices: Languages among ultra-orthodox Jews-
Volume 138 of the International Journal of the Sociology of Language.  After
I mentioned it-because the publishers had moved- some people told me they
had trouble ordering a copy. I have written and since gotten hold of
information about the US distributor for Mouton De Gruyter. Contact Teresa
Fozard, Journals Division, Walter De Gruyter, Inc. 200 Saw Mill River Road.
Hawthorne, NY 10532. (914) 747-0110 fax (914)747 1326. Thank you and sorry
for those of you who had trouble. For those in Europe the main office is in
Berlin. 

A dank
