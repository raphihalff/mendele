Subject: Zalbe- has no numeral limits

I greatly appreciated Anno Siegel's eloquent and instructive post
(5.115,4) about the zalbe- construct in recent German.

He then asked:  Is there a limit [in Yiddish] to zalbe- with higher
numerals (than the ones cited in my post (5.110)?

I do not believe there is a limit.  Theoretically one might say
"zalbefuftsikst... zalbehundertst," but it would not be practical.
Instead of zalbe- it might be simpler to say in such cases "in groups of
fuftsik... in groups of hunderts."

The advantage of lower numerals with zalbe- is that it is a kind of
shorthand, and one can perceive the total number of persons described as
a unit by an actual count or mental scan (zalbe'elft, zalbe'tsvelft...
zalbe'tsvantsikst).  With much higher numerals this would not work.

Subject: Second Volume of Weinreich's History of Yiddish

The YIVO Institute for Jewish Research is currently preparing the English
translation of the second volume of Max Weinreich's  _History of the
Yiddish Language_.

YIVO published in Yiddish all four (4) volumes of this _History_  in
1973. Two of these volumes were published in an English translation as a
_single_ volume by the University of Chicago Press (1980).

The new English volume will contain the translation of the remaining two
Yiddish volumes that were never translated or published before.  This new
volume will consist of all the annotations and references to the first
English volume, numerous explications, and addenda, and will thus serve
as a complement to the 1980 English volume I.

[Zellig is too modest to mention this but readers should know that he
has made a truly handsome gift to YIVO to make this possible.  Yasher
koyekh!  nm]

Subject: looking for the source of a story about a veil

On the theory that a good year is one rich in questions, I though I'd
make my first posting of this year a question about a story. I'm not sure
that the story is a Yiddish one, but I'm not sure it isn't, so . . .

Anyway - Martin Buber in a little-known essay on Bible translation writes
about what it was like for him to read the Bible for the first time in
German translation, having grown up knowing it in Hebrew.  He makes this
comparison:  "it was the way it is in the fairytale, when a wicked sprite
throws a veil over a girl, and thereby fearfully trans- forms her."  (The
German is, as far as I can recall it, "es war mir, als wenn im Maerchen
ein boeser Geist einen Schleier ueber ein Maedchen wirft, und es dadurch
furchtbar verwandelt.")  My question is, what story is he thinking about?
I thought at first it was from Grimm, but I can't find it there;  and I
can't find it in any of the fairytale motif-indexes my library has.  So I
thought, maybe this is a motif from some Yiddish story, maybe a Hasidic
one;  and then I thought, I'll ask the polymath readers of Mendele for
help.  A sheynem dank alemen,

Larry Rosenwald

Subject: Translation help needed

I am writing to you as a follow up to a recommendation I received to an
earlier post in Jewish Genealogy about translation of a long Yiddish
manuscript. At that time I was unaware that the manuscript was the
autobiography of my grandfather David Chaikoff.  He was born near
Kherson, was apprenticed out as a shoemaker, and subsequently emigrated
to Toronto in 1912 with his wife, two of his children, and $6.50.

It was only recently that I had confirmation that the document was the
autobiography, and I have only the first page translated. It consists of
117 pages (sides) of 8" by 10" lined paper. Although David was a
shoemaker he was extremely well educuted, putting me to shame!

Translation of this document is a must for me. I find his writings
remarkable, insightful, and interesting, over and above any genealogical
content.

I will append the first page to this message so you can get a taste of
his writing.

Ukraine, Russia  Part One Of Growing and Blooming

Twenty-five miles from the city Kherson the little village Havzune lies
spread out right next to the river Ingul which flows between two green
walls, one side covered with (unclear) and on the other side stone banks
can be seen covered with various wild grasses and all sorts of flowers.
From on high, the peasants' houses with their white plastered walls look
down and are reflected in the still waves of the river and through the
still noise of the trees the fresh air is carried from the flowing water
far across the village and freshens each person with the beautiful
nature, free life.  In the midst of the two hundred peasant houses there
was the only Jewish house where the family Cheikoff lived, for many years
had a tavern, a bar and also a store, and also hired fishermen, and ran a
thoroughly spiritual life, a strictly Orthodox house, kept a melamed
(teacher) for the children until they grew. The two oldest were sent to
greater melamdim, one to Kherson to the greatest melamed, and the younger
one, named Dovid Elya, set up in the colony Tatarke at Reb Zundl Melamed.
Thus time flowed in its normal way, but conditions do not remain the
same, they change during one's life and often because of bad people.  A
Jew came to the village Havzune and promised the authority twice as much
money for the tavern, so the tavern passed over to the new person who
dared to take away...

Subject: Yiddish stories on radio

With regard to encouraging one's local NPR affiliate to broadcast the
series of Yiddish stories on tape---I found that a personal call to the
program director was not only helpful but essential:  The announcements
about available programs filled a drawer in my local director's desk.  He
rummaged quite far down thru' the pile before he even came to the
information sent to him by the Natl Yiddish Book Center and/or the
affliate station in Santa Monica.  Fortunately I was still on the phone
with him as he scanned the brochure.  It was at this point that my
explanation of the historic significance of the series was crucial,
particularly my point that this so-called dead language (Holocaust,
etc.,) was in the midst of an important re-invigoration.  Then, I offered
to have the Natl. Yid Bk. Center call him about the details/costs of
obtaining the series, since he didn't yet realize that cost factors were
not a big issue....You too can perform this mitvah?! And thanks to the
folks at NYBC, who did indeed call him back.

Subject: Farshidene verter

Just a few brief comments on recent word-issues:

a) another (better?) Yiddish equivalent for "doggerel" is "gram-shtram."

b) the word "shlak" appears in the Yiddish wedding song "mekhuteyneste
mayne" as follows:

"nor tomer vet ir zayn a shlak, a beyze shviger
iz mayn tokhter oykh nit kayn antikl."

c) The opening phrase of _one_ Yiddish version of the
Internationale--quoted in the "oyf-af-ouf" discussion-- actually goes:

"Shteyt oyf, ir ale ver-vi shklafn
_Fun_ hunger-lebn, muz un noyt..."
