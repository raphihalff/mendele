Subject: Kemp Nitgedayget

In response to Itsik Goldenberg's questions (Mendele Vol 5.265) as to why
_kemp nitgedayget_ was spelled phonetically: As he mentioned, Sovetish
oysleyg, or, Soviet spelling, in which Hebrew admixture was spelled
phonetically, was used world-wide by Yiddish-speaking communists, though not
all. The Frayhayt, the official Yiddish organ of the communist party did not,
though some of its satellite journals, like Signal, did. Numerous other books
and journals which used this spelling system were also published outside the
Soviet Union (more accurate info is surely available from bibliographers:
names, I won't mention).  Additionally, it would be interesting to find out if
any of the zetsers (typesetters) ever protested Sovetish oysleyg. Anybody know
anything about this?

Nitgedayget was not a children's summer camp like Boyberik, Hemshekh or
Kinderland,  but a resort for workers and their families, built in the early
twenties by the far left of the needle-trade unions. A little write-up of it
by Michael Gold was printed in The Nation of 9/29/26. Here are two telling
paragraphs: "No one can come to this camp who is a boss or who owns a business
of any kind. But any wage earner, and this includes intellectual workers, can
come at the low rate of $15 a week. He is given clean linen and two wooly
blankets and can climb to his tent among the trees to rest until the camp gong
brings him down for dinner. He can sleep. He can roam the hills. He can sing
in the moonlight. He can swim, take sun-baths, listen to lectures, sing in the
mass chorals, act in proletarian comedies, read in the library, talk, laugh,
play games, go about all day in nothing but bathing trunks until his body is
brown as a faun's." "Yiddish is the prevailing langauge, though English breaks
out at strange moments, and half of the lectures are in English. I cannot tell
how queer and new it seems to an East Sider who has grown up with a kind of
prejudice against Yiddish to hear and see a baseball game conducted in
Yiddish. Yes, the needle workers play baseball at their camp. Some of them
even become good players. They don't know all the rules...but they throw
themselves into the game with passion. Anyway, these strike pickets, these
readers of Marx and Tolstoi and Lenin and Gorki play as joyously as
sandlotters. The teams are made up of all ages and both sexes, girls and men
and children, anyone who can learn to swat the ball. They play a rough game of
soccer too; it is the second most popular game in the workers' camp." Sounds
to me like it was a fargenign and a metsie.

Subject: Camp Carefree

As I recall it, my father, when a stalwart founder of the Fur Workers Union
with Gold, the trueblue Communist union, used to want take us to Camp
Nitgedayget, with the chaverim, but my mother, always skeptical of that crowd
resisted, and so I never saw it. She _had_ to belong as welfare supervisor in
the Bronx, I say _had_ to, to have a job at all (they were both eventually
thrown out of the CP for a trait in our genes: undisciplinable people, around
the time of the Moscow Trials).  It was up near Peekskill or Poughkeepsie.
And it was rather popular with thinking workers.  We ourselves deplored
folksinging and all the rest of the specious kulchur of the CP, it seems, and
especially we deplored in my family any mass actions, mass meaning anything
more than the family itself.  I suppose we should have been Confucian
skeptics, by name, and that is something handed down. If one thinks for
oneself, then Leninist tyranny was to be avoided at all costs, and so it was
in our family, after 1922, when the "Revolution" was over for good and all
forever.  I am sure some sentimentalists are to be found on this list, who may
even have been at that camp with the comrades. Well, it was affordable, at the
price of organized activities.  That the world loves those things is
commonplace: look at the success of the cruise ships in our own decade.

Subject: Camp Nit Gedayget

I was a camper there sometime in the late 1930s. My mother was a single parent
and worked in the separate hotel area. I suppose as a condition ofher
employment I received a free campership.  Most of the kids were there just two
weeks.  I have only good memories of the counselors who were a happpy group
and taught us the Yiddish songs we sang on the walk to the camp dining area .
I remember the International, shteyt auf mir ale zeinen gleiche, Tumbalaika,
etc. Only the wealthy at that time could afford to stay at the hotel and send
their kids to camp.  Most of the kids were sent there by some Jewish agency.
At that young age I think I sensed the rich from the poor kids. I never see a
big glass pitcher that fails to remind me of the pitchers of heavy sweet cream
with several placed on each table for us to pour on

Our breakfast hot cereal, plus heaps of unsalted butter waiting to be added to
it all (that is my secret craving).  Hey, I hope I am telling you about the
right camp.

Itsik Goldenberg [v5.265] asks about Camp Nitgedayget.  While I have no lucid
memory of the camp, I do recall trips there with my parents when I very young
(and spoke only Yiddish) and have pictures of them with some of their friends
dating from the mid-1920's before I was on the scene.  The name was a
recurrent one in my early childhood and I have a vague memory of Yiddish
comics' jokes about Kemp Nitgedayget...

The phonetic spelling may reflect the political orientation of the camp. It
later became known as Camp Beacon and was located just south of Beacon, New
York.  I don't know when (if?) it ceased to exist.  The camp was connected to
the Jewish People's Fraternal Order of the IWO [International Worker's Order],
the more left competitor of the Workmen's Circle.  Nearby was another Yiddish
camp that had changed somewhat by the time I worked there as a waiter in the
summer of 1946.  Called Camp Eden then, it was run by the Jewish Cultural
Farband and while still Jewish in cuisine and character, was no longer
basically Yiddish.  I was one of the few Jewish persons on the "working" staff
(unlike what I had found a year earlier in the Catskills' hotels.)  Eden was
east of Cold Spring, across the river from West Point, and about 25 miles from
Nitgedayget/Beacon.

The physical location of the two parallels the close physical location of the
two children's camps of the JPFO and the Workmen's Circle, Kinderland and
Kinderring, a subject covered in Mendele a few year's back.
