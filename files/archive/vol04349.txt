Indeed.  One of the more curious aspects of Mendele, for me, is many
contributors' complete familiarity with details of Yiddish which, in my
speech community (the "ultra"-Orthodox), are considered esoteric or are
entirely unknown, while some of the details which every kheyder-yingl
knows are big chiddushim to them;  this has been especially noticeable
WRT names. I guess it's related to the fact that in my speech community,
using traditional Jewish names, including Yiddish names, is a Big Issue
(much more so than *speaking* Yiddish or Hebrew), while in secular
circles, where most Yiddishistic activity takes place, I assume it is
not.

Hmmmm.  Stress in the third-to-last syllable in a Hebrew loan word?  I'm
not familiar enough with Yiddish to be sure, but I'm familiar enough to
be rather sceptical.  /yho'yshie/ sounds very un-Yiddish to my ear;  even
a /balago'le/ wouldn't talk like that :-).  The combination
Yehoshua-Heshl is usually used together, and it's usually pronounced
/shi'e-he'shl/.  (It can even be merged into a single word, /shihe'shl/,
used in fast speech for anyone whose name is shi'e-he'shl.)  While this
could be a later combination of an existing diminutive with a form of
Yehoshua which has a different stress pattern, it's more likely that the
diminutive comes from the same word, stress pattern and all, with which
it is paired.

My (non-native) instincts say it's more likely that it went like this:

1) /yhoyshi'e/ --> 2) /hoyshi'e/ --> 3) /heshi'e/ --> 4) /he'she/ or
/he'shl/

In the transition from (3) to (4), stress would move to the /e/ to remain
on the second-to-last syllable when a syllable is dropped.  I assume that
the transition form /oy/ to /e/ is a process which happens in many other
words as well.  It can be placed in the middle (as I did above), earlier,
or later, depending on history and how it interacts with other processes.

While I'm on the subject of diminutives for Joshua, here's another:
Yoshe. (I think it's most common by Litvishe, maybe Russishe as well.)  I
assume that for /yo'she/, the etymology is:

1) /yhoyshu'e/ --> 2) /yoyshu'e/ --> 3) /yo'she/

Again, in the transition from (2) to (3), stress would move to remain on
the second-to-last syllable when a syllable is dropped.  I'm not sure
where to place the shift from /oy/ (choilem) to /o/ (komets), but I
assume it's also a process which occurs in many other words.

Of course, according to the theory put forth by Reb Dovid, it could be

    1) /yho'yshue/ --> 2) /y'ho'yshe/ --> 3) /yo'she/

or  1) /yho'yshue/ --> 2) /yo'yshue/  --> 3) /yo'she/

with no shift in stress necessary.

There's also another use of "Yoshe"--as a nickname for Jesus;  other
Yiddish diminutives which were used to allude to Jesus include "Yoizel"
and "Getzel".  I assume there are more; would anyone care to enlighten
me?

Subject: Skotsl kumt

My mother used to say "skotsl kumt" in a somewhat pejorative way when she
was dissatisfied with the unexpected visitor before he/she crossed the
threshold.  She would mutter, "Skotsl kumt. Zey nor ver s'hot zikh
ge-yavet."

It seems to me that in the video, Fishke der Krumer, Mendele uses the
expression "Getsl Kumt" and I wonder if this wasn't tongue in cheek for
skotsl kumt.  If my memory serves me Mendele used this in relation to the
Ganev with Doba.

Subject: Kaptsn, mazl

Berl Leizer discusses mazl and kaptsn.  Thank you Berl for your
information.  I was not aware that the tradition of the paytanim included
astrology and that diagrams appeared in makhzorim--are you sure makhzorim
and not just siddurim?  The astrological signs are also part of a
traditional Jewish luekhl (calendar).

On the question of the Yiddish origin of Modern Israeli Hebrew
kabtsan: I believe another such word is the Yiddish talyen: hangman,
based on the German Henker, which is in turn I believe based on the verb
haengen, to hang.  I may be mistaken partially or entirely, but I heard
this idea recently so I thought I'd throw it out to the the Mendlyaner
for scrutiny.

In any event, it is well known that Yiddish created new Yiddish words
from Hebrew roots.  I think that such words as hislayves/hitlahavut,
dveykes/dveikut are original Yiddish coinages.  The meanings are today
somewhat distinct in Yiddish and Israeli Hebrew.  We tend to assume that
a word of Hebrew coinage in Yiddish is a Hebrew word borrowed into
Yiddish.  Clearly though, this is an oversimplification: although perhaps
less active than other components, loshn-koydesh yielded new Yiddish
coinages.  These coinages were modern Hebrew's for the taking.

Unfortunately, because of the anti_yiddish attitude of many leaders of
the Hebrew revival, these living Hebrew creations within the Yiddish
language and other Jewish languages fell into disuse, and sometimes they
were replaced by calques of western usage. Eg. Yiddish has iker
shokhakhti for P.S.  Israeli Hebrew has totally forghotten this form,
initially used by E. European immigrants.  Today the expression "tosefet
ah.arona"is employed instead.

In general, it has been my observation that Israeli Hebrew, when given
the choice between an expression of Loshn-koydesh in Yiddish, and a new
creation, has a marked preference to distance itself from Yiddish.
Mordkhe Schaechter explored a similar phenomenon in the development of
Yiddish in his paper, "The Hidden Standard," which argues convincingly
that standard Yiddish, when confronted by dialectical variants, chose the
variant closest to German, regardless of majority usage.  It would be
interesting to make a comprable study of Hebrew development and attitudes
towards loshn-koydesh in Yiddish.
