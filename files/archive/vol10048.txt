Subject: shifke shiva shifkes

In response to the "shifke shiva shifkes" question [vol 10.044]:

I am not familiar with the expression "shifke shiva shifkes", but it
appears to be Aramaic, meaning literally "forgive (me] seven
forgivenesses". In the given context, it appears to function like
meshteyns gezogt. The root shin-veyz-kuf is found, for instance, in the
"shvikin" of Kol-nidre.

Subject: "Oif Kapores"

I'm trying to understand the connection between the meaning of "kapores"

as "something worthless," or "a pox on it!" and the original Hebrew
meaning of kaparot, "atonements."  I can imagine three routes of
connection:

 1.  Something that you'll just have to atone for later would hardly be
worth its trouble. Hence it's worthless, or "kapores."

 2.  It's something as valueless as the "kapores" chicken.

 3.  In Sepharadi usage, a minor misfortune happening to me might be
dismissed as "kapara," meaning, rougly, a relatively trivial downpayment

on future atonements that I undoubtedly will have to end up making.  In
other words, while I didn't not enjoy the misfortune, in the greater
scheme of things, I probably got away with a bargain.

Any thoughts as to which of these explanations -- or any others -- is
the
link between the two meanings?

Subject: Menasha Skulnick

The other day, a friend and I were trading stories and wallowing in our
affection for our favorite actors, actresses and composers of the fabled

Yiddish Theater which we traveled to see, not only to Second Avenue but
to
Brighton Beach, Brownsville, The Bronx and wherever else we could find
something Yiddish on a stage. When our rondelay stopped at Menasha
Skulnick, my all-time, forever favorite, I discovered that my friend
could
match me in doing the Menasha shuffle, wherein Menasha would enter the
stage wearing that adorable porkpie hat, short jacket and mismatched
trousers, and do his famous "Menasha Dip." Then he'd intone in a nasal
twang that only he could deliver, "Heh-heh-hello, du kenst mir? Dus bin
ikh, Menasha." Who needed writers? That line exploded the house even
though the audience probably heard it dozens of times. But where my
friend
was mekhulah in Menasha-dom was when Menasha delivered his (to me, at
least) most famous short routine. This is where he would challenge an
actor, usually playing a protagonist, to spell his stage name. I can
hear
him now, delivering the answer after the actor phumphered and phumphered

for minutes, trying to unravel the spelling of Menasha's name which was
always the same, "Schnitzelputzel." The grand denouement came when
Menasha, and, invariably half or more of the audience, shrieking the
answer in sync, and in time with Menasha, delivered the answer which was

"Schnee-eye-itzel-pee-u-utzel...Schnitzelputzel." Ta-da!

Subject: timtum

Shalom Aleichem-

My name is Micah- I am a new subscriber from Portland, OR. I am only a
beginning Yiddish student, and I am working on a poster with Yiddish
text.
I am looking for some words which I can't find in my dictionaries,
possibly because they are of a more private, casual, or anatomical
nature.
If any of the much more fluent individuals on this list would graciously

donate a few minutes, I would send you the small list of words I cannot
find. Also, I am looking for information about the word 'timtum'. I have

seen it used in a derogatory way to mean 'stupid', and also read that it

originally referred to someone of ambiguous gender.

A sheynem dank-

Subject: Yiddish in Israel

 1. I can clearly identify only one of the words about which Nakhum
Goldwasser of Kibbutz Gesher Haziv (friend of my youth--and his)
inquires:
_barve_ 'nap', i.e. 'a soft or fuzzy surface on fabric or leather'. As
for
the other words, I might venture a guess about 1 or 2 of them if I could

see them in some context. Any help Nocky? That's what we called him way
back when.

 2. And, even before that, when I lived in Jerusalem (in 1963), I
encountered Arabs in Meah Shearim who spoke Yiddish and, even more
surprising, the tall, handsome, Yiddish-speaking, black chauffeur of the

Belgian ambassador. His family was apparently part of Haile Sellasie's
entourage that went into exile in the mid thirties and found refuge in
Jerusalem, where he grew up.

Those of you who are familiar with the maps of the Yiddish Language and
Culture Atlas, will find that both Safed and Jerusalem are included
among
the native Yiddish-speaking communities. In Jerusalem, the Litvish
(breyt
mit puter) dialect prevailed, in Safed, the Ukrainian (tote-mome)
dialect.

Subject: Kantonisten

Mikhoyel Basherives asks about the origin of "kantonisten", the word
used
to designate the Jewish children who were kidnapped and forced to serve
25
years in Tsar Nicholas's army.

According to the Soviet Dictionary Encyclopedia, the word comes from the

German "Kantonist"  which designated those Prussian recruits who were
required to serve in the Prussian army from a Prussian district
(Kanton).

In Russia, during the period 1805-1856, the word referred not only to
the
young Jews who were kidnapped into the Russian army, but also to sons of

Russian soldiers who, from the date of their birth, were registered with

the Russian military.

Subject: who remembers Ida Kaminska?

Tayere khaverim!

I am writing a paper on the actress Ida Kaminska, for a congress on
Yiddish theatre that will take place in Rome on March 4th-5th. I have
gathered enough materials in Polish, but, except from her biography (My
Life, My Theatre) and some references in "Vagabond Stars" by Nahma
Sandrow, I could not find any English text on her, and no Internet
resources (even if she has been living in the States from to 1968 to the

day of her death, in 1980). Maybe some Mendelyaner can suggest me
something, or maybe among Mendele readers there is somebody who still
remembers personally Kaminska, and is able to tell me something? Even a
little anecdote would be really helpful

A sheynem dank!
