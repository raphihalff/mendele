Subject: Introductory statement

Sholom aleichem

I am a new Mendele subscriber, but not new to the Yiddish world, having
been a klezmer clarinet player with Kapelye since its inception in 1979.
I grew up in the Bronx, NY, during the late 40s...mid-sixties; a place
where Yiddish was interchangeable with English on the street.  In
addition to my work with Kapelye, I teach music in the public schools and
am an official with the Amer. Fed. o f Teachers.

and now I'm glad to be a part of Mendele.

Subject: references to beatings in Yiddish

I can't contribute to the subject of wife beating references, but I do
have a related one.

One of my mother's favorite songs was "Unter a green baymele"
It continues something like this

Zitsn yingelekh zwei
Ertsayln zikh a maynsele [sic re the "n"]
Kayn zakh ... ...

Ayner dertsaylt dee nissemlakh
Vos er hot geht
Shlogt der zvayte inter bald
Bei mir ahkurah

Un der tate in der haym
Mitn pasek dem groysn
Hot geshlogen a gevalt
Un vertribn deroysn

That's all I can retrieve from my memory of 60 years ago.

Anyone really know the song?

Subject: on not one not two

Ms. Bechtel asked about the custom of counting not one, not two.  It is
my understanding that this custom derives from the the folk superstitions
surrounding the evil eye.  Related customs are the expression
"konehore--keyn eyn hore," recited to ward off the evil eye after
reckoning a blessing, and the custom of the word as power as reflected in
names: sick Jews would sometimes undergo name changes or have the name
"alter"- old man added to their name in order to prolong their lives and
hide them from the evil eye.  My father's hebrew name is Avrom Khaym.  He
is named for his father's brother Avrom who passed away at an untimely
age.  The name khayem has the meaning that through my father Avrom lives,
but the name "life" may also be rooted in the folk tradition, serving as
a protection to my father, saving him from a similar early death.

Subject: two questions: schmuck, varf mir aroys

Anatole Beck attributes, as do others, the word schmuck to the German
Schmuck, meaning jewel/decoration.  If I am not mistaken, the
pronunciation of this word in Yiddish is /shmok/ and the German Schmuck
is pronounced /shmuk/.  If this is the case, then the German etymology
posited appears unsound.  German /u/ becomes NE Yiddish /u/ and Southern
and Central Yiddish /i/.  Witness Fuss-fus-fis.  Thus the derivation
/shmuk/ - Yiddish shmok seems phonetically contrary to the history of
Yiddish phonetics.  The same would seem to hold true for putz.  I
remember having read a suggestion that schmuck in fact may have its
origins in a Polish word for dragon.  Does anyone know more about this?

What do we say haynt iz purim morgn iz oys gib mir a groshn un varf mir
aroys rather than mikh aroys as the accusative case would seem to demand?

Subject: on ekl

Recently there has been much discussion surrounding the word ekl.  I
thought I'd put in my two cents worth.  As I recall Dr. Mordkhe Shekhter
in his opus Laytish Mameloshn identifies ekl and its varied uses as
daytshmerish.  Most particularly unpalatable to the Yiddish Sprachgefuehl
is the thoroughly German ekelhaft.  I believe that migldik is recommended
instead and possibly s'iz mir nimes for es ist mir ekelhaft?
