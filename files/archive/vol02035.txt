******************

For the edification of Mendelekoi [Gevald!  I seem to be
mixing up my lists.], Placido Domingo [and his wife] sang
for several years in the Opera, here in Tel Aviv, before
becoming famous.  He picked up a lot of languages,
including some Hungarian and elementary Hebrew.  Perhaps
Yiddish, too; I am not sure.

Had, in Me'a Sha'arim.  Out of business a good few
years, now.  It was not more than one sponge in
the Mendele Guide, where Silver's of Coney Island
rated a top three sponges, worth going 50 miles
out of your way for a soak and a sleep in the
solarium.

Subject: YIVO

I was saddened to learn that the Yivo-binyen is up for
sale.
 
To be sure, the facilities are inadequate, and the absence
of climatization probably even more destructive to the
Institute's treasures than to the health and equanimity of
its staff.
 
It's just that the recent history of building-swapping has
not been (at least to this observer) an altogether happy
one: the new Arbeter-ring-binyen, whatever its amenities,
can't hold a candle to that Chinese Baptist church on East
Broadway; and who even knows the current location of the
Kultur-kongres?
 
Whatever my personal/professional taynes to the Yivo, it is
the central address of Yiddish scholarship, the Yiddish
national library--indeed, the Embassy of Yiddishland. Its
proximity to museums is, if anything, ideologically
regrettable; by contrast, its promimity to consulates
general is an altogether satisfactory contextualization.
 
Let's hope that the Yivo's future home is not appreciably
less imposing: this is one edifice complex not worth
outgrowing.

Subject: Chaim Grade

Chaim Grade's name came up a few days ago. I am here to
report that he is doing well, olev hasholom, at the
Riverside Cemetary in Lodi, NJ. His gravestone is
wonderful. He is buried next to Martha Schlamme - and
deservedly - she was a gem a WEIL ago. They are all buried
near other celebrities. Our family plot is nearby, and
after my visit there, I tend to wander.
