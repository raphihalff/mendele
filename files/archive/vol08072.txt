Subject: parevnik

Is anyone familiar with the term parevnik? I am interested in how it is
used, but especially where it was used.

Subject: Esq.

It is customary for certain categories of people to use abbreviated word
"Esquire" in the signature in documents written in English.

I wonder if Yiddish has any equivalent for a "self-inflicted" courtesy title. 
In other words, what Boro Park lawyers add to their names in the signatures
when they write in Yiddish?

Subject: Camp NITGEDAIGET

Regardless of how Harold Orbach or his mother may have pronounced the
word,
any name is spelled as its owner says it is spelled.  Marvin Engel, in a
previous Mendele volume, referred to Camp Nitgedaiget as having been
mentioned
in the book "Followers of the Trail" by David Leviatin, published by Yale
University Press in 1989.

On pages 281 and 282 of that book are reproductions of materials IN
ENGLISH
published by the camp, where the spelling is NITGEDAIGET, pronounce it
as you
will.

It was not only likely but certain that ads for the camp would be published in
English as well as Yiddish, as were ads for other "roite" camps.

Subject: oym ani khoymo

Today's portion for the hoyshanes reminded me of a song to those words.

Here are the lines I remember but first the translation -free- of the Hebrew
words in the liturgy. (I have no books to hand so I am not sure about the
first one) 

oym ani khoymo - a people for whom I am their wall [protector]
boro kakhamo- clear as the sun
goylo vesiro- exiled and forsaken
domso lesomor- compared to a palm tree
haharigo olekho- are murdered for You

refrain:
lomir dertayln, lomir dertsayln
der loyb fin di yidishe kinder

ayn male iz
oym ani khoymo
nokh a male iz
boro kakhamo
khotsh khotsh khotsh
goylo vesiro
dokh dokh dokh
domso lesomor

lomir dertsayln...

nebekh nebekh nebekh
haharigo olekho

sorry this is all I remember.

Subject: Yiddish matters

I have to tell you, I get a kick out of the "Yiddish matters" heading
that appears on every Mendele Review. I treat "matters" as a verb and
see the heading as a reminder. Is the pun intentional?

Subject: Tante Sonye's briv

Leonard Prager will be too modest to announce in this forum his latest
contribution to the JewishGen Yizkor Book site, his translation of Tante
Sonye's Briv, which can be seen at
<http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/grebinki.html>.  In his own words he
describes this wonderful piece: 

"In 1962, when my wife Barbara and I were living in London ..., we wrote to
Tante Sonye (Aunt Sophie) and asked her to write down all that she could
recall about her family, the Progers (Pragers), and her shtetl Rebinke
(Grebenki).  On 18 October 1962 (from her home at 341 Remsen Avenue,
Brooklyn 12, NY), Tante Sonye sat down and wrote a sixteen-page letter in
Yiddish in which she tried to satisfy our request."  (Leonard Prager) 

Leonard's translation into English is, of course, magnificent. 

Thank you, Leonard.

Subject: Career change

Yesterday Sally and I attended graduation exercises at the Guide Dogs for
the Blind in San Rafael, CA. The ceremony and tour were very impressive
and
filled with emotion. It was at the end of a blind person's month's training
when the person officially receives the dog and goes home. I raised the
question what they do with dogs that were not successful or what happens
when the dog gets old.

It was at this point that they used the term /career change/. Today this
term is often used for people in real life situations. The term for /career/
is /di karyere/ and /baytn/ means /change/. Now what would be the proper
way
to say /career change/? 

mit frayndshaft,

Philip "Fishl" Kutner
