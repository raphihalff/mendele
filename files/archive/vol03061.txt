The original expression in Hebrew is "kaf-ha'qel`a", spelled as
above, but very definitely with the final "`ayin".  It is defined in
Even-Shoshan's dictionary as "the hollow in a sling [and presumably
also in a catapult _A.H.] that holds the projectile (qel`a)."

It first appears in Abigail's blessing to David (1st Samuel 25,29),
in which she expresses the wish that his soul would be bound up
"bitzror ha`hayim" whereas those of his enemies would be tossed out
of "kaf-haqel`a". (Sorry. I do not  have an English Bible with me so
I will not know how the term is translated there until I get home
this evening.)  According to Even-Shoshan, it was later used
colloquially  in the first sense given by Norman Zide (that ascribed
to Spivak &  Bloomgarden). In medieval Hebrew literature the term
was used in the same sense by Emanuel the Roman (Italy, 1260-1328),
and is used figuratively in  modern Hebrew literature (Bialik,
Klausner, Sokolov, Barash) in the description of lost and/or
tormented souls.

The use of the term to describe hell or purgatory (a place rather
than an instrument) would seem to  be a purely Yiddish development.

Subject: Twixt Yiddish & Pennsylvanisch

Since they both have roots in the Rhineland, how mutually
intelligible are Yiddish and Pennsylvania German?  I'm thinking
about the scene in "The Frisco Kid" in which Gene Wilder, as a rabbi
from Poland, comes upon some Amish farmers.  Supposedly they
couldn't understand each other, and switched to English.  Was this
just a plot device for the benefit of an English-speaking audience?
Isn't there a broader base of intelligibility between Yiddish and
the Rhenish dialects of German?

While you're thinking about that:  How much does intelligibility
rely on tolerance?  How much does being understood depend upon the
will to understand?

Subject: Gezeres tach

I am currently translating a Hebrew article by Shmuel Ettinger about
Jews in Ukraine up to 1648. The Hebrew term,"Gezerot t"akh"
(Yiddish, "Gezeres tach) meaning "the harsh decrees of {1648} seems
to be the standard expression for the Khmelnytsky uprising in Hebrew
and presumably in Yiddish. Does anyone know what decrees are
referred to? Are they the harsh decrees of Khmelnytsky, or, perhaps,
of God?

Thanks to Khaim Bochner - just what I needed to know about
Kafakale/Kafekal. The word was used by my grandmother. Being in
kafekal was being in partibus infidelium (excuse my Latin case
usage), and the particular kafekals I can remember being in were
Iowa City, Oklahoma and Calcutta.Not that my grandmother disapproved
of these places - they were the sorts of places, apparently, that I
was going to spend time,and not unhappily - but, I now see, they
were a kind of limbo, were not Brooklyn or Manhattan where I should
have been content to stay.

Thanks also to Bob Hoberman for clearing up a small mystery. In the
thirties when I used to shop at bakeries on Thirteenth Avenue in
Borough Park, my mother would sometimes let me buy (what we called)
corn bread, something I really liked but that nobody else in the
family was very fond of. It was a slightly moist (oily ?) heavy rye
bread. When I first spent time in the South I tried and was
disappointed by their cornbread. It was nothing like my
cornbread.Back in Borough  Park in  the late fifties I tried to buy
corn bread - with no success, and then to find out something about
it. I was met with blank stares and misinformation. My cornbread is
obviously Hoberman's baker's corn rye bread. Where can you find it ?

For the Schiksearchiv: I was driving on the near north side of
Chicago last week and passed a new Jaguar with the license plate
SHIXSA. Deep sociological implications ?
