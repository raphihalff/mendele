Subject: Leo Fuld's language

There is a singer named Leo Fuld who has put out many records over the
years. I can't make out his dialect, because it shifts with every song,
and even within a song. He even uses German in some songs, and though he
sounds foreign-born, he sometimes articulates the "r" in the General
American way. There's a song he has, called "Ein Polnisch Yidl" which
seems to fall into the same category as Mein Kind, musst beten, but it
may be some dialect I'm unaware of. Nat aykh a por lidlekh:

Vayt vayt in Polen, anuver (?) dem Dniester,
Dort var ikh tsu hauz
Dort het ikh mayn vayp, un mayn tokhterl di Ester
(next two sentences unintelligible)
Un gab tsu a sude a huukhtsayt
(next unintelligible)

Ikh bin nur ayn polnish yidl,
Mit mayne lidl, fardin ikh mir a shtikl broyt
Mayn raykhtum iz mayn fidl
Mayn gantses glik vart of der vanen (?)
Un mayn Ester a bisl royt (?)

another moshl:

Der tsigoyner lid iz fray
Eybig yung un eybig noy

Very mysterious. Anyone have any ideas about this language use?

Subject: Yiddish specialty recordings

I like to browse through old record shops and pick up little gems. A few
months ago I was at the House of Oldies, in NY, and there on the wall was
an album called _Connie Francis Sings Jewish Favorites_. I checked OCLC,
a bibliographic database used in libraries for cataloging, and the
library that created the cataloging record for the item estimated it was
made in 1960. I also discovered that it's been re-released in 1994 on CD.

Poor Connie, she gets treated like a joke, but I have to say she did very
well on this record. She sang all the standards, like Mayn Yidishe Mame,
Ikh Hob Dikh Tsufil Lib, etc. Her pronunciation was virtually flawless,
and that gets explained in the liner notes; she early on in her career
did the Borsht Belt circuit and picked up the language from the guests
and from other musicians. My only quibble was the sounding of final ayen
as "ah". But maybe there were regions where it was pronounced that way. I
know the penultimate e as in brivele gets pronounced by some speakers as
brivale.

I myself favor, for final ayen what some linguists refer to as the
"Balkan 6th vowel", which is the Turkish i without the dot, and the
Romanian i with the circumflex. It's pretty much like the Polish y, which
is maybe why Solomon Birnbaum romanized it that way. It's not a shwa,
it's in between i and eh.

Another terrific singer, Dusty Springfield, gets short-shrift by people,
though several critics say she is the best pop singer England ever
produced. I just bought her boxed-set CD's for a pretty penny, mind you.
Many of her Italian and French renditions are on there, and again, we
have the case of a singer regarded as eccentrically buffoonish, with her
huge beehive hairdo, ping pong paddle eyelashes, and white lipstick, who
really mastered the subtleties of two important languages. I think it
would be terrific to hear her do some Ize Kremer favorites like "Amol iz
Geven a Mayse", "Vos Bisti, Ketsele, Broyges?" One of my favorite Kremer
songs is "Oyfn Pripetshik". The final stanza is chilling, she sings "Az
ir vet kinderlakh elter veiern" "dem gules shlepn" and ends with "Koylem
gimel goy". I like that frankness at the end, implying why the gules
shlepn exists. Hey, me, take anything personally? :-)   Anyway, Dusty has
finished a project called "Dusty in Nashville" (she recorded "Dusty in
Memphis" in the late sixties, which was panned, but is now not only
considered her best work, but has been reissued and is mentioned in
reference sources as a very important, classic record) If the Nashville
project succeeds, maybe she'll feel secure enough to give us Nye Platsh
Mama. Or Dusty in Minsk? Dusty is a stickler for authenticity, so maybe
she'll record it in sabesdiker losn. You don't have to say you love me,
dzust be close at hand! I know, sabesdiker losn was on its way out years
ago. But Molly Picon had a routine where she talked about a lady in the
audience whom they nicknamed "The Yankee" because "I don't know Dzuis"
but her "Minsker accent" said otherwise.

So to come back to the topic of Yiddish specialty albums, have any other
Mendelyarn come across interesting "Jewish-interest" records by
mainstream singers? It would be interesting to look at choice of songs,
date of performance, pronunciation, and the challenge of interpreting
that elusive yidishn tam correctly.
