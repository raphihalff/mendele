sorry, dovid, you should see the whole movie. there is
definitely yiddish in it. lanzmann treats yiddish the same
as polish and hebrew, the other two languages in the film
that he doesn't speak--he has an interpreter. (he speaks
directly with the interviewees who speak french, german,
and english.) one scene in yiddish that i remember very
vividly is of a barber in tel-aviv, a powerful scene.

in fact, i asked lanzmann once about the choice of
languages and he told me that he left it entirely to the
interviewees. and, i believe, if you see the movie again,
you'll find that the choices are exactly what you would
have expected.

[Same quote from Dovid Braun as above]

I believe you're wrong.  I taped the whole thing (8 hours)
from TV and watched it at the time.  I seem to remember
some interviews in Yiddish.  The whole point certainly
seemed to be to get people's recollections in whatever
language they were most comfortable in. Many of the
interviews, of course, were with non-Jews.

i'm not sure what you base your presumptions on, but all
the research on dialectal variation over the past 25 years
show that in fact there is VARIATION. very few dialect
features are categorical in speakers' repertoires. and this
is true of people living their whole lives in their
original dialect region; the variation found in speakers
who have moved to another dialect area, not to mention
another language area like the singer you discuss, can only
be greater.

with respect to the dialect discussed, in fact it fits very
well joshua fishman's introspective findings (mentioned in
his book never say die, i believe) that o/u, e.g. zog/zug,
vary more than e/ey, e.g. vemen/veymen. that is,
southeastern (also central, i might add) speakers (when
singing OR speaking) are more likely to say, for ex., /zog/
instead of their regional /zug/ than they are to say, for
ex., /vemen/ instead of their regional /veymen/. it also
fits the findings in a longitudinal study i did of
bessarabian/standard variation over a 40-year period in the
singing of someone born in kishinev. (1987. Sarah Gorby,
Yiddish folksinger: a case study of dialect shift.
Sociology of Jewish languages. Internatl. J. of the Soc. of
Lg. 67.83-116.)

>I appreciate the fact that singers may take certain

nothing certainly in my study suggests that there is
anything special about singing in this respect. it seems to
be no different from careful, more or less self-conscious
speech.

i just want to add here that 'contaminated' might be
more appropriately expressed as 'influenced'.

"grayzen" with the sense of error cannot come from gemoro
looshen gri'es-- which after all seems to be found only as
a singular and then it has to do with lack and deficiency,
not error as such but a missing qualification which if
there would render the object ritually fit. at root it
means "a subtraction"-- do not add or subtract (tigra) from
the words of the torah etc. Come to think of it-- the way i
add, subtract-- even spell it could mean mistake, but there
are better words for mistake, even if from hebrew, like
toois. "Circles" kroyzen is a creative  derivation but the
jump to "error" is weak. Besides, it makes no sense-- the
point would be-- even if noyech has 2 letters, it is
complicated for a child to construct these letters-- so it
would mean as the classical saying has it "small in
quantity but mighty in strength." in the spirit of-- last
is best. that is the way the phrase noyech  mit siben
grayzen should have developed had it referred to circles.
But it did not and I wonder if we are not barking up the
wrong dog to find the True Grayz.
