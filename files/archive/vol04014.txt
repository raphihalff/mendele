Subject: oyver-botl and its original form

The spelling of oyver-botl in that article in the Forverts is according
to how the expression appears in peyrek (Pirkey Oves).  I doubt it was
meant to be read any way other than [oyver-botl].  Assuming Yiddish got
the expression from Mishnaic Hebrew, we would indeed expect
[oyver-uvoteyl] and then maybe [oyver-uvotl].  Yiddish is "bound" by the
rule in the sense that, if a lexical item in which this rule is
instantiated makes it into Yiddish, the phonetic output of such a rule
shouldn't be expected to be different in Yiddish, al- though it may be.
In oyver-botl, the original sounds different in the Yiddish by lacking
the result of the Hebrew lenition rule (/b/ going to /v/ after /u/) AND
the conjunction u- itslef.  So if oyver-uvoteyl is read without the
conjunction in Whole Hebrew, you have oyver-boteyl and not *oyver-voteyl.
The u- dropped out first, presumably within Hebrew where Hebrew
phonological rules hold, then got integrated into Yiddish where vowel
reduction took place a la Yiddish phonological rules and stress patterns:
boteyl --> botl. So my assumption is that oyver-uvoteyl was already
lacking the conjunction in pre-Yiddish Hebrew speech (vernacular or
learned discourse, or whatever form of Hebrew it was that first fed into
Yiddish).

Subject: Questions from the Underworld

	Aloha, mendelniks, fun Hawaii, the treyffene medinah of the
Pacific.  I had to desubscribe from mendele for awhile (I was on
Compu$erve), but now with an internet connection I am back I hope.

	I have two questions, both of which can probably be answered
readily by most of you out there, but I plead my ignorance, so bear with
me:

1. What does YIVO stand for? (not politically; acronymically)
2. What does "shpilkes" mean?  Etymology?

	At this point in my beginning of the study of Yiddish, I'm afraid
that if Leo Rosten doesn't have it, I don't have it.  Any help would be
appreciated.

Subject: Baltaxe

Since there are so many melamdim on this discussion list, permit me to
present the following question. I have recently made a professional
e-mail contact with a fellow whose last name is Baltaxe. He is a proud
Jew and though an American now lives and teaches in a university in New
Zealand.

He claims that his name means originally: the bailiff of a rabbinical
court.

I wonder if anyone can corroborate this meaning?
