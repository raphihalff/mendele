Subject: "Di Mezinke Oysgegebn"

For Les Train and Fay Lipshitz and for anyone else who is interested: Di
Mezinke Oysgegebn was written [text and music], by M. M. Warshawsky

Hekher! Beser1
Di rod, di rod makh greser!
Groys hot unz Got gemakht,
Glik hot er mir gebrakht,
Huliet kinder a gantse nacht!
Di mezine oysgegebn! [2]

Shtarker! freylekh,
Du di malke, ikh der meylakh!
Oy, oy, ikh aleyn,
Hob mit mayne oygn gezen
Vi Got hot mikh matsliekh geven--
Di mezinke oysgegebn! [2]

Itsik! shpitsik!
Vos shvaygstu mitn shmitsik?
Oyf di klezmer gib a geshrey:
Tsi shpiln zey, tsi shlofn zey?
Tserays di strunes ale oyf tsvey!--
Di mezinke oysgegebn! [2]

Ayzik!  mazik!
Di bobe geyt a kozik.
Kayn eyn hore, zet nor zet,
Vi zi tupet, vi zi tret.
Oy a simkhe, oy a freyd--
Di mezinke oysgegebn!

Motl! Shimen!
Di oreme layt zaynen gekimen
Shtelt far zey dem shensten tish,
Tayere vaynen, tayere fish,
Oy , mayn tokhter, gib mir a kush--
Di mezinke oysgegebn! [[2]

Subject: die mezinke

I seem to recall a "mezinke oysgegebn" song (about marrying off the
youngest daughter) from a Theodore Bikel album of Yiddish songs years
ago (in the days of vinyl records, maybe the 1960s or 1970s?) Hope this
helps.

Subject: Tsugreytn a yerushe: Dovid Bergelson

Once again we should all sing out, "A blessing on your head, mazl tov,
mazl tov..." to our shames. This time it is for his posting 6.220.
"Yidn, koyft bikher!" he beseeches. "...Asch, Bergelson and Grade are
gone," he continues.

The very good news is that Bergelson is alive and well under the
talented care of our Mendelnik, Golda Werman, who has a sparkling new
translation_The Stories of David Bergelson:Yiddish Short Fiction from
the Russian_ (Syracuse University Press 1600 Jamesville Ave, Syracuse,
NY 13244-5160. att:Amy Rashap). This seems an excellent choice
ontzuheybn tsugreytn oder tsu farbesern a yerushe!

Our Golda (definitive translator of Anski's Dybbuk for Schocken Press,
1992) is a scholar to reckon with  of 17th century English literature
with many learned articles and a recent book on Milton (Milton and
Midrash, Catholic University Press, 1995). Holocaust events switched her
focus to Yiddish prose of the 19th and 20th centuries. Because the
survivors of Treblinka gave their testimony in such elegant and moving
Yiddish during the trial of Demanjiuk, she was inspired to study
Yiddish, a language she had not taken seriously and had never read.

The witnesses described a rich, vibrant Jewish world that was no more.
Herein was born her decision to help preserve the remnant of that lost
world, the Yiddish books, to snatch them out of the graveyard by
translating them into English. She was fascinated and deeply touched by
the surprisingly modern stories of Peretz, Sholem Aleichem, the 2
Singers... and her translations were all published in American journals
to the applause of their readers.

Thinking The Dybbuk had left her breathless, she discovered David
Bergelson, whom she names as more sophisticated, more innovative, more
modern in outlook than any of the Yiddish writers she studied. Drawn to
his elegiac prose style and compelling rhythms (not easily rendered into
English), he became her lofty challenge and turned into a project of
love.

Bergelson wrote for a new time, after the decline of the shtetl and its
literature, of the problems of modern society with its lack of
commitment to common goals and common values. He captures the dreariness
of the uncommitted life and the suffering of alienated, lonely people
everywhere.

His treatment of women is particularly impressive in their transition
from a protected life with little freedom of choice to the new life of
freedom but increased tension. His portraits of women will please the
most ideological feminist.

The book includes Golda's wonderful translations of two short stories
and a novella; a long introduction that surveys the tragic history of
Yiddish and Yiddish writers under Stalin; and a preface by Aharon
Appelfeld.

Bergelson's biography is fascinating, scanning the Stalin period. On
August 8, 1952, his birthday, he was shot along with most other Yiddish
writers who had had no trial.

In Golda's sensitive, compassionate hands, Bergelson rises like the
phoenix, and will live forever - if you buy the book!

Subject: Hebreyizmen in der yidisher shprakh

I'm responding to Bess Katz's inquiry regarding a volume entitled
"Hebreyizmen in der yidisher shprakh" by Yisroel Steinberg published in
Poland in 1949.  I own a 1957 volume entitled _Hantbukh fun hebreyizmen
in der yidisher shprakh_ by Nakhman Krupin.  It was published in Buenos
Aires, Argentina.  I don't know if Krupin's book has any connection with
the similarly titled book by Steinberg.  Copies of the Krupin book can
be purchased from Manuel Krupin, 11431 Clover Ave., Los Angeles, CA
90066-1331, Tel. (310) 391-9659.  Manny Krupin is selling the book for
$13.00 plus $1.24 postage ((total: $14.24).  The books are in mint
condition and very clearly printed.
