Subject: Nokh a yinglish vitsele

When I first started studying Yiddish, I guess I must have been about 14
or 15 years old, I loved the Borsht-Belt style jokes, with English
narrative and a Yiddish punch line. The last one I submitted to the list
was the first one I had ever heard, from a spoken recording of Dr. Murray
Banks, psychologist, doing the bit about the Litvak in boot camp.

Another one of my favorites from his repertoire was "Adultery".

An old man goes and visits his son out on Long Island. While there, he
attends a service in the local Reform Temple, but his English nebekh
ain't so hot. Anyway, they're listening to the Rabbi thundering about the
evils of adultery. The old man turns to his son and says, "What means
adultery?" Caught off-guard by the old man, the son replies, "So that you
don't turn the oven on on Saturday". "Oh Oh very good". After the service
the Rabbi walks over to shmooze a bit, and the old man immediately says,
"Rabbi, you talk about adultery, excellent, first class, ober mir hobn
far dos a shikse."

    Although some people find these materials insulting and demeaning, I
    find them to be extremely entertaining, and a fascinating look at a
    musical-sociological phenomenon.

while i find most of the more recent stuff to be pure shlock (e.g.
country yossi, rechnitzer rejects), some of the older stuff is priceless,
imho. and also interesting from a linguistic point of view, to see how
the languages were mixed. i actually did a study of lexical borrowing
based on some of this material and it turned out to be an interesting
corpus. (it was also interesting to present it at a conference at that
oh-so-elegant jesuit institution, georgetown university, and play an
excerpt of menashe skulnik's _i'm sam the man who made the pants too
long_! :-) )

Subject: Oxford Program

I attended the Oxford Yiddish program back in 1990.  It was a wonderful
experience but I too had difficulty with the administration. They did not
seem to care that we had problems outside the classroom such as housing,
transportation, etc. At the end of the program, we were asked to evaluate
the 4 week session.  I then did suggest improvment concerning the
"mechanism" for running the program out side of class. Apparently, the
suggestions were not taken seriously.

All in all, it was a great experience. However, be sure to question
housing, meals, off campus programs, fees, etc. _before_ you go to
Oxford.

Thinking about it just now for some reason--the wonderful juxtaposition
of modern technology (internet, international communication, etc.) with
the ancient mameloshn that is our topic.  Conjure up a computer, modem,
etc. in the shtetl!

Shalom, how wonderful to be a part of Mendele. It is so enjoyable to see
growing, striving, and developing people corresponding.

I have a question -- I'm good at that. I just started my study of
Yiddish. I must say that it is my 10th language, so that my other
languages are helping, but I was wondering what kinds of advice people
out there might have to someone who wants to read the Baal Shem Tov,
Isaac Bashevis Singer, and Sholom Aleichem in the original and just loves
to read in general. Grammar books I have on the way, and I read up to
Noach in Breshit last Shabat -- an edition in Hebrew, English, and
German by Rabbi Levi Goldstein of NYC.

Any hints, advice, etc. out there?

Subject: A zindele a sheyns

Like a moving picture in slow motion to enhance minute details for a more
accurate observation, so are syllables in the words of a song, maybe
especially in a lullaby, stretched out for melodic effects.  In writing
or in print, however, such syllables have to be joined together.

This then is the answer to Leah Zazulyer's song query (5.103,1).  When
the syllables are _re-joined_, and with the addition of several missing
consonants, the text of the verse reads as follows:

ver hot a zindele, a zindele, a sheyns,/
Oygelekh vi shternlekh./
a neshumele a reyns,/
La, la, la.../

Translation:

Who has a handsome little son, little son,/
little eyes like little stars,/
a pure little soul,/
La, la, la.../

All diminutives are in the mode of endearment.

P.S. No translation of the last line, however...

Subject: Ver hot aza yingele

The song sought by Leah Zazulyer's friend (5.103) is "Ver hot aza
yingele?", which is included in the Mloteks' _Pearls of Yiddish Song_
(available from the Arbeter Ring Jewish Book Center and elsewhere).  The
Mloteks write that the song was originally entitled "Who Has Such a
Girl?" ("Ver hot aza meydele?") instead of "Who Has Such a Boy?"  It was
written by Janet Fleishman, first published in 1933, and popularized by
Herman Yablokoff.

Although written by a known author, it is identified as a folk song on
two records in my collection (one by Chava Alberstein) and has indeed
become folklorized in the sense of existing in various versions.  For
example, the text printed by the Mloteks begins:  "Fun dem himl
tsugeshikt/A matone mir" while the version sung by the Polish singer
Sl/awa Przybylska beings "Fun dem himl tsugeshikt/A zundele mir."
