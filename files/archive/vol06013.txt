Subject: 'living language', nokhamol

morrie feller claims that it is _my_ 'contention' that: "a language is
kept alive only when children learn it from their parents and family,
and then continue to use it at home".

several points are in order there. first, it is irrelevant who the child
learns the language from -- that depends on who the child grows up with
-- parents and family in our society, adult female members of tribe in
the new guinea highlands, etc. second, while it's always an honor to be
quoted ;) , i do feel a bit funny about being quoted here as tho i were
being original. alas, this is neither my discovery nor my invention: a
living language is _by definition_ a language learned by children as their
native language (or as one of their native languages -- you can have
more than one).

while i hate to be a party-pooper, this does mean that yiddish on the
net is really not relevant to the future of yiddish as a living
language. at the same time, i should like to (once again) cheer up mr.
feller: yiddish IS a living language -- it is alive and well in mea
shearim, parts of brooklyn, and a few other places where the
ultra-orthodox live and grow up speaking yiddish natively. why he
worries about the vitality of yiddish all the while ignoring the
community for whom it IS a living language is a puzzlement...

finally, in case this definition seems too ad hoc to be taken seriously,
i should point out what is perhaps obvious: for strictly _biological_
reasons, linguistic competence acquired in childhood is _qualitatively
different_ from linguistic competence acquired after puberty. it has even
been shown (melissa newport, don't have refs here) that linguistic
competence gained only after the age of 5 or 6 (but before puberty) is
demonstrably weaker than that gained before the age of 5. thus the
definition of 'living language': for a language to be classified as
'living', its complete grammar/structure/etc must reside in some
(living) human heads; for a complete grammar/structure/etc to reside in
human heads, it has to have gotten in there when those heads were very
young. hope this makes things clearer.

Subject: Yiddish back from the dead

[Regarding Morrie Feller's post in 6.010]:

If this is a correct extract from Professor Wisse's article, one must
wonder whether it is backed up by any serious research. Living in  a
'Hasidic' community I feel qualified to comment. Nothing could be
further from the truth. It may well be that the scope of topics
discussed in khasidishe communities does not reflect the content of the
Sunday press or the television channels. But Yiddish is used as a living
language, to a greater or lessser extent within these communities, and
at least some of them use yiddish as their first language. I don't know
whether the extent of yiddish spoken within these communities will have
a noticeable impact on the number of yiddish speakers in 50 years time,
though I suspect it will. But facts do not have to be invented.

Subject: Another article on the survival of Yiddish

It looks as if this is the season to maintain that Yiddish cannot
survive as a living language.  The "Na'amat Woman" (magazine of Na'amat
USA,the Women's Labor Zionist Organization of America) in its May-June,
1996 issue has a lead article by Isidore Haiblum which is entitled : "A
Bird's-Eye Look at Yiddish."  Haiblum is described as a novelist who has
written numerous articles about Yiddish, humor and popular culture.

This article might be considered to be a companion piece to Ruth Wisse's
article "Shule Daze".  Its tenor is much the same, and its conclusions
are similar.  In the body of the article Haiblum states that today
Yiddish is spoken by three groups: (1) the elderly, (2) the
ultra-Orthodox, and (3) students and teachers.  Of the latter group he
says:  "Those who actually learn the language, unless they intend to
become Yiddish professors themselves, can usually 'speak to the wall' -
a fine Yiddish expression, if not very encouraging."

His concluding statement is: " So where are we?  In college - where
every Jewish mother wants her children to be.  And where one can study
Yiddish just like Latin.  And learn all kinds of nice words.  But not
the words in _this_  article, which, alas, despite being in a Jewish
magazine, are all in English.  Welcome to modern times."  (To Na'Amat
Woman's credit, it still includes a page of Yiddish in each issue after
having published fully in Yiddish many years ago.)

To Isidore Haiblum I would like to say that instead of speaking to the
wall, those who learn Yiddish can comunicate with their counterparts the
world over on the Internet.  And when he says "welcome to modern times",
I suggest that he recognize the positive impact of the computer and the
Internet on the survival of the Yiddish language.
