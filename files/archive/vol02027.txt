Subject: Mickey Katz

Regarding Alex Rosenberg's queery about Mickey Katz...I,
too, enjoy his music.  I think we should whisper, though,
as I recall our shames mentioning once that borsht belt
Yinglishizing might be a bit declasse for Mendele.  I have
a few tapes of Mickey Katz collections that were reissued
in the not too distant past.  I purchased them at our local
Jewish book store.  Don Byron, the former clarinetist with
Boston's Klezmer Clonservatory Band, has become an expert
on Mickey Katz, and has performed only MK tunes in New
York, where he now resides.  I believe Mickey Katz is
deceased.  However, his son is alive and has become
interested in playing his father's tunes.  He has gotten
together with Don Byron on this I believe.  Katz was a very
talented clarinetist but also a master of the parody.
Remember Dovid Krockett, King of Delancey Street?  The Cry
of the Vilde Kotchke? I've never seen a published song book
of his, but would certainly like to obtain same if you
learn of one's existence.

Subject: International Guide to Shvitz's

Though not a matter of Yiddish language exactly, it struck
me that mendele readers could well be of the sort that
appreciate a good shvitz.  Any interest in reviewing the
shvitz's that exist in our respective cities?  It would be
a great travel aid.  I refer, of course, to the traditional
Russian-style Jewish shvitz where one can spend several
hours relaxing, having a pleytza perhaps, and getting
generally contented.  Here in Boston, there are at least a
few places, but my favorite is the Blue Hill Shvitz.  A
fellow named Yossel gives wonderful playtzes
there...gathers the oak leaves himself in the fall, dries
them and bundles them in his basement, and what a machaya!
This particular shvitz migrated to Norwood from Roxbury 20
years ago.  It hasn't been in Blue Hill for years except in
spirit.  They make a real effort to preserve the Yiddish
feeling there.

How many of Mendele's readers have a good shvitz in town in
which to take refuge?  Care to offer a review?

The recent discussion about Mickey Katz and Menashe
Skulnick prompt me to post another query.  Can anyone tell
me the whereabouts and/or well being of the great Maurice
Schwartz and Yakov Bullov?  I recall their theatrical work
with great pleasure. I also recall Maestro Schwartz's
artistic temperament from the time I was a yeshive bucher
in "Yosele Solovei."  Also is any of their work or other
serious Yiddishe theater on tape?  I saw Bulov's troupe
perform Macbeth and Death of a Salesman in Yiddish - ten
times better than the Old Vic!!!

Subject: lyrics

i've gotten so many requests for my transcripts of menasha
skulnik and mickey katz that i thought some of you might
like some other record transcriptions that i've made and
that i have on-line--many many many by a yiddish singer
named sarah gorby. she wasn't well known in north america
(having been mysteriously deported from the u.s. after ww
ii), but was fairly well known in south america and paris.
anyway, all you yiddish singers/song enthusiasts, let me
know if you want them and how many. (i should warn you that
the transcription of gorby's stuff is not the official yivo
transliteration since i was doing a dialect study and
needed a more fine-tuned system. but i can send along a
key.)

To Benjamin C. Kite:

     Alas! It is too late to enroll in the "Yiddish Summer
Camp" this year. I came back Sunday the 5th from a
stimlating and enjoyable week on the Mt. Holyoke College
Campus in South Hadley, Mass. It a week-long seminar run
every summer by the National Yiddish Book Center, which
recently moved to temporary new offices on that campus. All
members of Mendele should join the Center. If you do, in
addition to supporting its activities, you will get the
word on all special events.
