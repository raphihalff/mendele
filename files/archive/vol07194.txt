Subject: poylish & paylish and then some

Bob Werman asks (07.192) about the pronunciation differences between those who
"refer to themselves" as _poylish_ and those that "refer to themselves" as
_paylish_. The short answer is that there are probably NO speakers who refer
to THEMSELVES as _paylish_. The term _paylish_ is a HYPERCORRECTION created by
LITVISH speakers in the following manner: 

Standard Yiddish _oy_ in words like _broyt_, _groys_, _poylish_ is rendered
_ey_ in Litvish (thus, breyt, greys, Peylish). 

Standard Yiddish _ey_ in words like _geyn_, _heym_, meydl_ is rendered _ay_ in
_Poylish_ (thus gayn, haym, maydl). 

When the Litvak attempts to imitate __Poylish_, he "interprets" (either
mistakenly or mockingly) HIS _ey_ (from Standard Yiddish_oy_) for Standard
Yiddish _ey_ (which is rendered _ay_ in Poylish). In other words, he
classifies HIS OWN "Peylish" with the words _geyn_, _heym_, etc. (which are
_ay_ in Poylish) rather than with the words _broyt_, _groys_, etc. 

In revenge, the speaker of Poylish, for similar reasons involving other
regular sound correspondences, refers to the Litvak as "lutvak" or, at an even
further remove, as "lotvak". 

Is that confusing enough?

Subject: Hassidic Yiddish periodical "Mayles"

In the Apr. 17 issue of the Yiddish Forward, Dovid Katz discussed a Hassidic
Yiddish monthly, "Mayles". Does anyone know the address and price for
subscribing to this journal? Along this line, while there are several
Ultra-Orthodox (and plain Orthodox) Yiddish newspapers and other periodicals
published in the US, are there any such periodicals in Israel?

Subject: Yiddishland 

I think "Yiddishland," is a term made up by Harshav to metaphorically identify
a world-wide community which spoke Yiddish, thought in Yiddish, and lived in
it. There is a danger with taking metaphors too literally. I think it was not
'literature' but language itself that was 'everything.' Their language
included and incorporated 'body language." A shrug of the shoulder, a movement
with the hand -- communication skills. Yiddish speakers are masters of it all. 
I don't know what Harshav means when he writes: "Literature...was a substitute
for religion and for statehood." The religious books were prime literature,
and their readers endlessly debated points from them in Yiddish. 

These are just some thoughts from the top of my head.

Subject: -te suffix with non-Semitic stems

I am not sure but that Mikhl Herzog may be recanting too readily.  To be sure,
poyerte and the like prove that -te can be attached to non-Semitic stems (in
this case, a Germanic one), but I am not sure that this can be documented for
all of Yiddish or for the earliest stages of Yiddish.  I suspect that from a
Pan-Yiddish or proto-Yiddish perspective, such as I have been repeatedly
advocating here in place of the narrow and ahistorical focus on Eastern
Yiddish, Mikhl's original statment might be right (I am being cautious because
I dont have all the relevant sources of information at hand).  Incidentally,
the interesting thing historically, and one whose significance for teh origins
of Yiddish has not been adequately studied, is that the most securely pan- and
proto- Yiddish examples of this suffix (which is of Aramaic origin) are with
Hebrew stems.  This should tell us something about the relationship between
teh Hebrew and Aramaic elements which went into the making of Yiddish.

Subject: Adrabe - Aramaic or Hebrew?

Quoting Alex Manaster Ramer (7.192, 5) "For example, adrabe is written with a
final alef, just as in Aramaic,..."  That is how it is spelled in Weinreich.
But not in Harkavy who spells it with a final hey, not alef.  Three Hebrew
dictionaries I consulted also spell it with a final hey.  In the Folksfond
Oysgabe of Sholem-Aleykhem's Ale Verk it is also spelled with a final hey.
Seems that Weinreich is alone among sources I've looked at.

Did Weinreich know something that others didn't?  Did Yiddish take the word
from Aramaic rather than Hebrew?  If so, it seems unusual.  Are there other
examples?

Subject: Zvi Kolitz and Yidishe Tsaytung

I am looking for a (photo)copy of:  Di Jidishe Zaytung (El Diario Israelita),
Yom Kiper, Wednesday, 25 September 1946, pages 39&40, ed. Mordechai Stoliar,
Buenos Aires.  These pages should contain: Yosl Rakovers vendung tsu got
(dertseylung); spetsiel far di yidishe zaytung fun Zvi Kolits.  A Dutch
translation (from a German version?) has just appeared, together with the
translation of an essay by a German journalist, Paul Badde. In the Dutch
edition appears "a facsimile of the reconstructed original text". It is not
stated who reconstructed the text and in which way the text differs from the
original. Paul Badde suggests that he owns a photocopy of the only existing
original, which was destroyed on July 1994 when the library in the Calle
Pasteur 633, Buenos Aires, was bombed. 

I would like to compare the original with the 'reconstructed original'. Any
information on how to obtain the document would be welcome.

Subject: Guggle-muggle 

Can you speculate on the etymology of the term "guggle-muggle"?

As I recall, "guggle-muggle", a concoction made by my Bubbe long ago, was a
'cure' for sore throats. If you know the ingredients, that too would be of
interest.

Subject: His Yiddish ain't dandy but his sales sure are.

Mandy deserves all the credit for his hit CD which, I understand, is a runaway
best-seller in Europe. Doesn't this success highlight the thirst  for new
Yiddish entertainment, 1998-style, even if it's not by a famous show biz icon?
I am not a Mandy fan. His shteemeh affects me like a nail digging into glass
and his Yiddish...freg nisht. He trills his r's as though he were doing an
imitation of Karen Aker doing an imitation of Edith Piaf. In my life I never
heard any Yiddish singer rake those r's the way he does. But the material and
the marketing are first rate and it's good to think there will be more, from
Mandy, not to mention other Jewish entertainers who will be encouraged by this
first huge success.

Subject: Mandy Patinkin's CD _Mameloshn_

In Mendele Vol.07.193, Marjorie Hirshan asks "Has anyone heard Patinkin's CD"?
I have the recording and after one hearing am not inclined to go back to it
again.  I generally enjoy listening to Patinkin - but in this recording he
overloads the songs with such strident emoting as to become quite unbearable.
This coupled with such borscht-circuity numbers as "Take me out to the
ballgame" makes the entire experience rather tiresome.  As for his Yiddish
pronunciation, I thought it was quite good for someone who required intensive
coaching.
