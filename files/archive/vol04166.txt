Subject: The Power of a "Halevay Gedank" (Wishful Thinking)

With reference to the postings by Sarah Moskowitz and Kayle Goodman
(4.161, 5 & 6) about New York City as the proposed site for our planned
Convention:

As I reread my "Call for a Mendele Convention" (4.160,2)  I realized
that, while I clearly stated that a special Committee be in charge, among
other things, of selecting the location (city), I suddenly shifted,
without any explanation, as if New York City has already been selected.

This leap strikingly illustrates the power of wishful thinking, of a
wishful thought, for which Uriel Weinreich coined the ingenious term "a
halevay gedank".

Since for reasons of health and age I most likely could come to the
Convention only if it were held in New York City, I did not notice, to my
later amazement, the contradictory transition in the paragraph.

Of course, one's individual preferences, for whatever reason(s), cannot
be a determinant factor in the selection of a city for a Convention.

Many other factors, and the opinions and preferences of a majority of the
general membership on the Mendele list should be taken in consideration
and given full weight.

Personal motives aside, may I add some general reasons why New York City
would be a good site selection:  It is the vibrant centers of the print
media, the television industry, and the world-wide news services, such as
the Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, etc., and,
especially, J.T.A., the Jewish Telegraphic Agency.

To the degree that one of the purposes of a Mendele Convention would be
to disseminate to the world the news of our presence, interests, and
activities, the coverage of our Convention in New York City would
certainly be greater than anywhere else.

May I further add a suggestion of a program note:  A  Klezmerama, by our
own Mendele member Henry Sapoznik, might be a fitting _si'yem_
(conclusion) to our Convention.

Subject: Re: the "Mendele Convention"

I believe that most Mendelniks are aware that two very successful
conventions  under the umbrella of the "First and Second Internation- al
Conferences on Yiddish Clubs."  The first was organized and put on by the
Washington Yiddish Clubs held at the University of Maryland; the second,
by the Yiddish community in Toronto, Canada. Both were huge successes!
The next one in 1996 in either Cleveland, Ohio or New York City.  The
competition is quite lively.

Why am I telling you all this khazerei?  To ask the question, "Do we need
_another_ Yiddish Convention competing for the same people? I believe
that this needs some deep and serious thinking before we become
farbloget.

Consider this: Why not a Mendele section at the next [Third]
International Convention on Yiddish Clubs?

Subject: Yiddish theater in America

I noticed the following announcement in Garland Publishing's catalog on
19th century American Musical Theater.

================================================================

"YIDDISH THEATER IN AMERICA

David's Violin (1897) and Shloyme Gorgl (189?)
Edited by Mark Slobin, Wesleyan University

Yiddish theater in its heyday in New York between 1882 and the 1920s
produced thousands of sheet-music editions and sound recordings of hit
songs.  Since conductors worked from lead sheets rather than full scores
and the eclectic shows constantly changed, the performing editions
presented here present manuscript and published materials with songs and
dances typically used in the period.  The protagonists of both these
turn-of-the-century dramas about Jewish life in Eastern Europe are
musicians.

Subject: Petshke and 'chin' revisited

To Motl Lakin:

The _petshke_ you're talking about comes from _pots_, one of whose
diminutives is _petsl_.  Obviously _petske_ is another.  You're family is
litvish, having the /s~sh/ alternation (maybe in only a few words, ober
dokh), thus /petshke/ and maybe also /petske/. (I assume, by the way,
that this is the pronunciation of the word that you mean.  You wrote
_petschke_.  Does your "sch" correspond to "sh" of English, or of the
Library of Congress system?  I.e., the Yiddish letter shin?)

Anyhow, I'm talking about a different _petshke_ (unless the chin, in
Yiddish caretaker language [the PC word for 'motherese'] was associated
with the penis).

Subject: Petschke

In response to Mottel Lakin's observation about the use of "petschke," it
may be useful to note that the Russian for "cock or rooster" is petukh.

Does anyone know where the name _shulamis_ comes from (i.e. any Judaic
source familiar to you)?
