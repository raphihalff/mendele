Subject: From the shames

Someone will yet write "Motel-room Editing for Fun and Profit".
Beats shuffleboard: vegn dem iz opgeredt. So a hartsikn dank to the
many subscribers whose contributions during the past few weeks
prevented me from becoming just another graybeard-in-the-sun.

The shameste's resigned comment: "I thought they said that Yiddish
was dead".  Nu, meyle.

But we've fallen far behind, thanks to an unprecedented number of
posts.  I will try to get everything out as quickly as possible
so that we can return to the policy of next-day delivery (or
better).

I appreciate also the effort that almost everyone has made to
remember the Subject: line and signature.  It may seem petty to some
to insist on such things but for the editor to devise them has in
the past led to dissatisfaction and complaints.  Polite notes have
helped in some cases, not in others.  Let this message serve as an
explanation as to why some posts have not been, and will not be,
redistributed.

A final favor.  It would help a great deal, especially if our volume
of mail is to increase (we're almost at 400 subscribers!), to
establish the optimum size of a Mendele number.  Up until now it's
been between 5-7 kb. and with no more than 5 or 6 messages.  Is that
about right?  Should/could it be twice as long?  Or should we get
rid of the "digest" format altogether and have each post appear as a
separate piece of mail?  The shames in a previous incarnation used
to construct questionnaires; now by way of atonement he will forgo
that route and simply ask that you write to him at

nmiller@dot.trincoll.edu

(_not_ to Mendele).

A sheynem dank aykh alle.

Subject:  More on tumtum

The concept of tumtum is developed in the Talmud and in other
rabbinic literature and refers to a sexually undeveloped individual
and is differentiated by the Rabbis from a hermaphradite, an
individual with organs representing both sexes [androginus].  The
word is probably derived from tet-mem-mem, meaning hidden. A folk
derivation is from tet-mem-aleph, or impure. See TB Yevamot 99b and
TB Baba Batra 140b.

Subject: Re: No More Klez Kamp

I recently heard that YIVO will no longer be offering Klez Kamp.
Does anyone know why?  Is it possible than another organization
could take over the job of organizing Klez Kamp?

Subject: Sports terminology -- Nisht Yoysherdik!

I vote for "Nisht Yoysherdik!" as the Yiddish sports term I'd like
to see.  You'd use it in place of our English expression, "No
Fair!", e.g., after a perceived bad call by the referee.

It helps that it couldn't be confused with German when printed in
transliteration.

Subject: Re: The name for 'Yiddish'

I've missed the recent discussion, so I apologize if this goes over
old ground.

I agree that the name 'Yiddish' works in English to refer to the
language, although I recall my grandfather's friends saying things
like 'How do you say X in Jewish?'

I do find a problem in Yiddish, howver, in distinguishing between an
adjective referring to the language and to Jewish matters in
general. For example, the Yiddish name of Prof. Gershon Winer's
organization is 'Fundatsie far yidish limudim', presumably because
'yidishe limudim' would refer to the full range of Jewish studies.
On the other hand, it violates the rules about adjective endings.
Or is it a noun in apposition?

Subject: Introduction

I'm Louis (Lou) Fridhandler. Retired professor U.C.I. I am a
researcher: before retirement, biochemistry; since retirement:
Sholem Aleichem's life, works, times, milieu, associates, sources of
his ideas, etc. Found some works unknown to today's Yiddish readers.
Translated a number. Published some. I live in California's Orange
County which is not fertile ground for a Yiddishist. I only just
learned about MENDELE, and it seems to offer a source of info and
stimulation. I want to learn more.

Louis Fridhandler.
