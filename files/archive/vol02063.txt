Subject: Use of es

Will someone please comment on the use(s) of the word "es"
in the following sentences. Is it based on a Slavic model?
I capitalize it to draw attention to the word, but it's
unstressed in every case. Your comments will be
appreciated?

Mikhl Herzog.

Subjects:  Lachoudisch (clarification)

For those who may have wondered at the phonological
connection between the words "loshn-koydesh" and
"Lachoudisch" I should have based my transcription of the
former on its Western Yiddish pronunciation:
loshn-kaudesh.

Subject: peh-tsadik

My father (not at all religiously observant) used this
expression often to mean a dummy. It was only years after
his death that it occurred to me that it was the spelling
of "putz."

Well, I wasn't around before 1940 (or 50 :-), but the
Spivak & Bloomgarden (Yehoyesh) dictionary of Hebraisms has
it, and that was published in 1911. So some one must have
been using it. (Unless it's a conspiracy by the dictionary
writers :-)

I don't think I've _heard_ it, but I think I've encountered
it in reading. Couldn't say where, though.
