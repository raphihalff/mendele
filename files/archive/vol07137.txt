Subject: Literature on pragmatic functions in Yiddish??

Dear mendelyaners,

does anyone of You know if there exists some material on how Yiddish expresses
pragmatic functions (Topic-Coding, Switch-Reference, Focussing...)? Although I
doubt there has been done some work on it at all... Anyway, it would be nice
if someone of You knew something on this matter.

Thanks - a hartsign dank,

Julia Buechler

Subject: Tseleger?

Recently one of our ultra Orthodox Kneset Members (Ravitz) referred ironically
to his party and its "strength"  as a "groyser tseleger"  (or so it sounded to
me).  It seems to be something like a big shot.  Is that so and what is the
origin of that term?

Subject: Mendele: a gourmand's perspective

Few months ago Russell Harris, a scholar of Islam, Near Eastern politics, and
food history from London asked about the word fisnoge [07.066]. Following the
ensuing discussion in Mendele he wrote an article and published it in the
world's leading journal on food history Petits Propos Culinaires (Issue 57,
December 1997). The article reproduced below with Russell Harris' permission. 

Iosif Vaisman

***************************
The double naming of a dish

Judges 12:6
Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he
could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the
passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and
two thousand. 

It is not important to talk about the meaning of the word shibboleth, (1) 
rather the fact that we have documentation that a tribe of the Children of
Israel had a problem distinguishing between the sound "s" and "sh," with dire
consequences for forty and two thousand of them at the passages of Jordan. 
What is intriguing here, is that a couple of thousand years later, the same
problem among Lithuanian Jews gave rise at least one pleonastic construction
in Yiddish for the name of the great feast dish of calf's foot jelly. (2)

It was while helping Alan Davidson slew huge chunks of data around a hard disk
in order to bring some slight comfort to an editor who was going to have to
deal with a million words, that I remembered fisnoge and noted that there was
no entry for it in the Oxford Companion to Food. I could distinctly hear my
tutor at university deconstructing the word with glee. Alan asked if I could
write something on the matter, however in trying to write an entry for this
dish for potential inclusion in the Companion, my library proved too limited,
and I turned to the internet. 

The usual search engines yielded no trove for fisnoge or variant spellings,
but I did alight upon the home page of Mendele (3), wrote an e-mail to the
contact name stating the nature of my problem ("help on the derivation of the
name fisnoge"), and by the next morning messages were flowing.  One kind
correspondent obviously misread my original question and replied telling me
that fisnogel [sic] in his dictionary meant 'toe-nail'. Others wrote to me
recalling the finger-licking deliciousness of jellied calf's foot with
hard-boiled eggs. However, as I had hoped, some serious etymological replies
were sent, and I have compiled them below, while at the same time, hoping to
make an appropriate reference to the verse quoted above.

In one of Yiddish dialects, the name for this dish (calves' feet cooked with
much garlic and onion, deboned and left to set in their own jelly, generally
with the addition of hard-boiled eggs) is fisnoge.(4) I quote Ron Robboy (a
member of the Mendele mailing list) who states that "the word fisnoge occurs
only in so-called Lithuanian Yiddish, or Litvish, which was spoken in the
Baltic lands, the present Belarus, and the extreme northeast of Poland.  The
Litvish speaker would characteristically pronounce the sounds 's' and 'sh' as
's'." Thus we had the beginning of a problem. When a Litvish speaker asked for
what sounded like "fis", the listener did not know if he was requesting
(calf's) foot (fis in Yiddish) or fish (fish in Yiddish). The shibboleth
issue! 

"To distinguish between the two," continues Mr Robboy, "the Litvish speaker
attached a second Slavic component - noge, meaning foot" - thus we have the
word fisnoge, literally "foot-foot."(5) My own contribution to this short
discussion of fisnoge, has been to try trawl my memory for food items
apostrophised in Yiddish songs. Mentioned were Mameliga, various soups,
succulent stuffed carp, raisons and almonds, Rumanian wine, even herrings and
black bread, but calf's foot jelly remains unsung. 

Moreover, there is not even much danger these days of being slaughtered at the
Jordan for a wrong pronounciation of fis! The Litvish term fisnoge has
generally been superceded by the name petchah, derived from the Ottoman word
for foot.(6) 

1. Dr Georg. Benedict. Winer, Lexicon manuale Hebraicum et Chaldaicum in
Veteris Testamenti Libros, Fridericum Fleischer, Leipzig, 1828, gives "fluxus
aquae, flumen" and also gives the Ephraimite pronounciation sibboleth. 

2. In gathering information for this discussion, I am deeply indebted to
various members of the mailing list centred around the "Mendele"  website, and
have been requested to credit the archives of the Language and Culture Atlas
of Ashkenazic Jewry, housed at Columbia University, New York, and published by
Max Niemeyer Verlag, Tubingen. 

3. "Mendele: Forum for Yiddish Literature and Yiddish Language"
(http://www2.trincoll.edu/~mendele)

4. Romanized Yiddish words are written here according to the Standard YIVO
Orthography. 

5. "To disambiguate the homonymy that results from the merge of 's' and 'sh'
in Litvish," according to another correspondent from the Mendele mailing list,
Mr Mikhl Herzog, speakers of Litvish also added a second component to stress
the meaning "fish" when they meant "fish" and not "calf's foot":  the Slavic
word for fish - ribe, or the Hebrew word for fish - dogim (Ashkenazic
pronounciation) was added to the stem fis (fish), making another pleonastic
construction - fisribe or fisdogim (i.e. fish-fish). 

6. In response to my surprise at reading of the origin of the word petchah, Mr
Mikhl Herzog replied that "as for Turkish influences in Yiddish, there are
several that probably made their way up, largely from the southeast (via
Ukraine, I'd think).. even royte patlezhanes [red aubergines] - 'tomatoes'."

Subject: Vilner lasunes--lyokum bembe!

Recently our Vinkl's leyen-krayz translated a satiric folksong collected by Y.
Dobrushin in 1937.  (The song also appears in abridged form in Ruth Rubin's
"Voices of a People.")  The reading circle got stumped by four words. 

Briefly, the song's first stanza satirizes dwellers of several shtetlakh
between Vilna and Minsk; the lines always end with the nonsense term, "lyokum
bembe!"  E.g., 'Vishniver klotnikes--lyokum bembe!' (Vishneva brawlers--l.b.) 
Here are three of the words that stumped our mitglider: 

Vilner -LASUNES-
(Vilna ???--glossed by Rubin as 'dandies with a sweet tooth')

Lebedver -KULAHE-
(Lebedzeva ???--one guess was 'shouters')

Krever -MEKHILE-
(Krevo ???--no ideas)

In addition a later stanza contains these lines:

Un hot untergeshmisn 
Mit a milkhike -KUTNITSE-
(And had beaten
With a milkhike ???)

The song is published in Sovietized Yiddish.

Does anyone have any thoughts about these words?  Should I spell out the words
using the names of the letters? 

A hartsikn dank,
