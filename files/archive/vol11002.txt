Subject: Di Tsukunft Soliciting for New Writers

Dear Colleagues:

A friend at the Yiddish literary journal Di Tsukunft (Zukunft) -- a
venerable New York-based publication now marking 108 years of
uninterrupted publication -- has asked me to post this message, an
invitation for potential writers to contact the journal. Please share
as appropriate.

The editors and trustees of Zukunft are actively seeking opportunities
to involve and invite talented writers -- be they authors, poets,
belle-lettrists, scholars, critics, folklorists, essayists, etc, etc.,
whose thematic and intellectual endeavors are appropriate for
submission to Zukunft. While writers have as a rule submitted material
to Zukunft in Yiddish, the journal is expanding its outreach to new
writers not only beyond their traditional roster, but also to people
who write in English and/or Hebrew.

Regardless of their ability to write in Yiddish, people "should by all
means consider submitting material to the journal, be they authors,
poets, belle-lettrists, scholars, critics, folklorists, essayists, etc,
etc., whose thematic and intellectual endeavors are appropriate for
submission to their journal.

"If manuscripts arrive in less than pristine Yiddish, we have redactory
experts to do careful and non-invasive editorial correction. Moreover,
if the submission deals with any area that might come under the overall
rubric of this non-sectarian, non-political literary journal and it
happens to be in English or in Hebrew, we shall find adequate
translators. The inclusion of an English abstract of significant
articles is under consideration.

The editors and trustees strongly believe - "we have reason to be
nearly certain - that within the ranks of people on this discussion
list and among your colleagues and even your students there are people
who would be interested in writing for or submitting material to
Zukunft."

Aware that there are relatively few good Yiddish journals for serious
creativity in many of these fields, the editors "are most eager to
perpetuate the honored role as well as the literary and critical scope
and renown of Zukunft into the future. We shall be pleased to speak
with any one of you personally, should you have questions.

"Manuscript submissions should follow the usual format - double
spacing, margins, diacritics where possible. Proper references are
expected.  Please contact us before sending material on disk. While
technically ideal, we would have to explore if the file was compatible
with our equipment.

Subject: alevai

I have never known the source of the word  alevai  .  If it has been
discussed by Mendele, I have missed it.  Can someone inform me?

Subject: Uncovering a pseudonym?

Mendelites:

I am doing some work on the Kharkov-based Soviet Yiddish journal Royte
Velt.  It's first edition (summer 1924) lists one of its editors as
"Ravitch-Cherkassy."  I am trying to determine if this is a pseudonym
of Melekh Ravitch, who was, as far as I can tell, in Warsaw at the
time.  Or is this a reference to an entirely different person to whom I
cannot find any reference.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Subject: new Sholem Aleichem translation

Dear Mendele Readers,

Syracuse University Press has just published my new translation, "The
Further Adventures of Menachem-Mendl", by Sholem Aleichem (ISBN
081560677X). This is the hither unknown sequel to his first volume,
"Menachem-Mendl". It continues the correspondence between
Menachem-Mendl, now a reporter for a Warsaw newspaper writing about
pre-World War I events and his wife, Sheyne-Sheyndl back home in
Kasrilevka. This is my ninth Sholem Aleichem translation. I would
certainly appreciate comments from readers.

Subject: Travel literature between 1850 and 1920

Dear Mendelyaner,

I'm working on a study about Yiddish travel literature between 1850 and
1920. I am interested in the travels of East European Jews towards the
Western world.

I started from "The Short Travels of Benjamin the Third" and some works
by Sholem Aleichem (Oys dem nahen osten), Sholem Asch, and Peretz
Hirschbayn (Iber Amerike, Felker un Lender). Does anyone know other
works or other shraybers, who wrote on this subject?

A sheynem dank,
paola sannino

We are looking for a letter that Sholem Ash sent Sutzever.  Ash
requested that the letter not be opened until after his death.  We
thought that the letter appeared in "Der Goldene Keyt" in 1957, but we
didn't find it.  If someone could send us a copy or knows where we can
find the letter, we would be very grateful.

Re: Sholem Berger's (10.056) concern about the fate of old Yiddish
newspapers. It would seem that the more times change, the more they
stay the same. Sholem lists only three of the four Yiddish dailies that
appeared in New York until the final quarter of the 20th century. The
Morgn Frayhayt (morning freedom), it would seem, never existed. Then
what was it my parents read and supported? And where was I a staff
reporter?
