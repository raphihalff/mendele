Subject: Tsatske/tshatshke

[Apropos Bob Rothstein's statement (4.237) that tsatske may be derived
from the Polish _cacko_ (tsasko):]

Yes, a nursery word that quite possibly got to Polish from Hebrew tza`atsu`a
(via Yiddish, of course), to which was added a Slavic diminutive ending.

Subject: Nokh tchatchkes

For the sake of discussion, I'd like to add that we can find in many languages
words which bear a close resemblance to Yiddish  tshatshke.

German  "Tschatsch" (=toy, plaything, knick-knacks, bauble); Czech c^ac^a
(=beautiful, nice-looking, comely;  pr. "tshatsha");  Russian "tshatsha"
(=beautiful,  nice-looking);  Votyak "tshatsha" (=knick-knacks, gimcrack,
gew-gaw); Cheremissian "tsetse" (=nice-looking, comely; knick-knacks);
Hungarian "csecse"  (=pretty, lovely; sweet, dear; gew-gaw, bauble; fancy
articles. Approx. pr. "tshetshe")

Cp. also Hungarian "csacska" (approx. pr. "tshatshka") -- which has the
meaning of "talkative, garrulous, prattling, silly" with a note of endearment,
being mostly referred to young girls or to children. From this word originate
both  "csacskasa'g" (=talkativeness, loquacity, garrulity) and the verb
"csacsiskodik" (=to be childish, to say silly things).

Subject: Yinglish lists

In 5.312 Howard Kusnetz asked about Yinglish lists. One approach is to use an
electronic dictionary and reverse search for "Yiddish" or other appropriate
words. The following unedited list is the result of  a search on "Yiddish"
using the American Heritage Dictionary, Third Edition v4.0. (Note that the
recently discussed "tsatskes" is here listed as "chachka" with "tchotchke" and
"tsatske" listed as alternate spellings. The word origin is said to be:
Yiddish tshatshke from Polish dialectal czaczka.)

Subject: Alsatian Yiddish

[Regarding Dan Leeson's post in 5.302:] Claude Vigee is a good friend.  I have
a tape of him reading some Alsatian Yiddish texts that I can copy for
interested people, at their expense.  Mikhl Herzog has a copy, too.

Subject: The Opatoshu family

Unlike Macbeth, Dovid Opatoshu was of woman born, and I offer some remem-
brances of her.

In the '40s, Adele Opatoshu had the respected distinction of being the only
female teacher in the Arbeter Ring Hekhere Coursn. She was slender and lithe
which matched her soft, gentle speech and manner. She taught us Yiddish, and
parsing was fun, even the pluperfect - hot geven gehat gegangen - went down
easily with her spoonful of sugar method. She loved words and instilled a
deeper respect for language in all her fortunate students.

She touched hundreds of students with her motherly mien and sharp mind.
Humility was another of her aspects, as we learned of her son's acting and her
husband, Joseph's writing talent, from Yudl Mark and N.B. Minkoff.
