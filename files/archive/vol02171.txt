From SJB2@PSUVM.PSU.EDU
Subject: Introduction

I'm glad to have such a list available!  I am a professsor
at Penn State Harrisburg in Folklore and American Studies.
I am also the son of Yiddish-speaking Holocaust survivors,
and I still speak Yiddish to my mother, but I get little
other practice, except for an occasional Yiddish speaking
group meeting in Harrisburg.  I have scholarly interests in
Yiddish folklore and I would like to hear about proverbs,
sayings, tales, beliefs, and folk arts that people on the
list are collecting.

Regarding Holocaust studies, I am translating some of the
testimonies touching on legends and beliefs in the
Oshpitsin Yizkor book (My father is from Osphpitsin or
Oswiecim in Polish).  I would also appreciate reviews of
new works on Yiddish and Yiddish culture.  I am currently
reviewing Polish Jews in Paris for Jewish Folklore and
Ethnology Review, for example.  I am heartened by new
interest in Yiddish and I hope to be able to sponsor a
course before too long on Yiddish culture in America at
Penn State.

Sei gesund,

Simon (Shimen) Bronner

Subject: Tipesh

I have now received more details from my  son.  It  seems
that  the  expression which  is pure  Hebrew is  a
translation from Yiddish.  Here goes what he sent me now:

It goes like this. A Tipesh shel HOREF comes home.
Takes off his heavy coat and puts it in the closet.
Takes off his other coat and puts it in the closet.
Takes off his light coat and puts it in the closet.
Takes off his sweater and puts it in the closet.
Takes off his other sweater and puts it in the closet.
Takes off his vest and puts it in the closet.
.....
And then you see he is a Tipesh.
A Tipesh shel Kayitz you see it right away.

Subject: Tipesh

The expression that Michael Shimshoni's son brought home is
listed almost exactly in the wonderful Hebrew slang
dictionary "Milon olami la-Ivrit ha-meduberet", "The World
Dictionary of Hebrew Slang", by Dan Ben-Amots (Dahn
Ben-Amotz) and Netiva Ben-Yehuda, page 103.  Here's my
translation of the entry "tipesh kayits", literally
"summer-fool": "A person whose stupidity is exposed
immediately, at first acquaintance.  (After Bialik)."
Compare it with the entry "tipesh khoref", winter-fool: "A
person who outwardly pretends to be smart, but after
further acquaintance it becomes clear that he is stupid.
(After Bialik)."  If this is really from Bialik, did Bialik
get it from a Yiddish expression?

Subject: Shayles

The Ukrainian (Podolian) Yiddish I learned prefers 'dil' to
'podloge' and 'shtakheten' to 'shtigen'.  I hope that this
is b'seder, Mikhl?

However, in the case of 'layen' and 'borgen' I'm less sure.
I'm almost positive that my family preferred the former,
but it seems to me that they also said 'borgen' from time
to time.  Do some use both and if so is there a difference?

'Shkarpeten' (socks): can the Slavists among us provide the
etymology of this Polish (and Ukrainian?) word?  My
grandmother, who was raised in a dorf, used it. Others I
_think_ used 'zokn' for socks and stockings.  Does that
check out?

Finally, 'shalemayke'.  I ran across it in print the other
day in a context suggesting 'contraption', 'thingamajig'.
Is that correct?  Is it roughly equivalent to 'makherayke'?
Or do they occur in the same speech community?
