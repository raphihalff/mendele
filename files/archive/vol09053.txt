Subject: Zelda

Several Mendelisten have written to me in reply to my comments about the
name "Zelda". Unfortunately, a recent computer disaster has wiped out my
memory of my own posting and some of the comments as well. Perhaps the
following will serve as a reply: 

Appearances to the contrary, Zelda is not likely to be related to
Slavic-origin Zlate (or to other variants of that name that is sometimes
realized as or paired with _Golde_). 

_Zelda_ is, on the contrary, better derived from the Medieval German
_saelde_, which, among other things means 'blessing', 'health', 'good
fortune'. Cf., the masculine _Zelig_. If you're interested in further
elaborations (e.g., _Frau Soelde_, look up _saeldaerinne_, _saelde_, etc. in
a Middle High German dictionary.)

Subject: zelda

With reference to Mikhl Herzog's query [09.045:4] re the female first name
Zelde, it seems to me that the most likely explanation is that this a
relexification of Simkhe derived from the MHG saelde 'joy, beatitude,
goodness'.

Subject: Zelda - Query about a name 

Mikhl Herzog" <mherzog@bestweb.net> asked:  Can anyone venture an etymology
for the Yiddish/English name "Zelda"? 

A beginning is Benzion Kaganoff's entry in "A Dictionary of Jewish Names and
Their History"  which states that the family names Zelda, Selda, Selde,
Zeldin and Seldin are all from the woman's name "Salida" which means
"happiness."  But that doesn't seem to be the whole answer.  My Spanish
dictionary does not say that salida means happiness and, of course, a
complete response would include the Hebrew, Biblical or Yiddish equivalent.

Subject: ZELDA

I got the following answer to the "Zelda" query.

<<ZELDA ([fem.]) Possibly "luck" (Yiddish from Teutonic) or a short form
of GRISELDA.

=> GRISELDA ([fem.]) "grey battle" (Teutonic). This was the name of a
patient wife in tales by Boccaccio and Chaucer.>>

From: frankens@uni-freiburg.de
Subject: Zelda

To Mikhl Herzog's query about Zelda I propose the following etymology:  the
english Zelda must be the diminutive of Griselda/Griseldis, from the german
gris-hild (=grey battle). The yiddish Zelda is the female form of Zelig,
deriving from the german "selig" (= blessed, happy).

Subject: shabbes and shobes

In response to Mikhl Herzog (09.048):

I can absolutely confirm Rov Mikhl's correction, as I was the originator of
the query that Phil answered in the Forward.  My father and my mother both
knew the rhyme, he from Leeds and she from London.  Alas, my interest in
Yiddish arose after the death of my maternal grandmother, who had all sorts
of other wonderful expressions that I haven't heard or seen elsewhere.  Some
of them are relatively obvious, such as shtik glomp for a clumsy oaf
(actually our dog), and oser , meaning something like today's 'Yeah,
right..' Alas, I have forgotten many more of them.

Subject: "Af zain treyd".

In response to Alla Sokolova (09.048):

You already have the English translation of "Af zain treyd:" It is as you
indicated, "to walk over HIS footsteps." 

In my Yiddish, I might have said 'trayt' - a little harder on the end
consonant.

Subject: litvish feminine

To add to Mikhl Herzog's posting:  "real" litvish doesn't have tsu DER mamen
but tsu DI mamen -- "the gynic" in U. Weinreich's terms.  Btw, "real
litvish" needs to be better defined, because for subdialects of litvish it
is indeed tsu DER mamen.

Subject: Verner's Law

A linguistics graduate student in my department asked me the following
questions which I do not feel qualified to answer. I am wondering if any of
our linguistics experts could repsond. 

If you want to respond to her directly, her email address is:
jgranger@indiana.edu

Here is Jammie's request:

   I am working on a paper on Verner's Law in Germanic, and I was hoping
   that you could give me some information about Yiddish.

   Does Yiddish preserve the alternations due to Verner's Law between voiced
   and voiceless obstruents? (/p t k s/ with /b d g r/) as in Gothic strong
   verbs wairthan and giwordan.  Dutch preserves these in many strong verbs
   such as verliesen/verloren, kiesen koran gekosan.  There is levelling in
   German and English (except for cases such as was/were).

   And are there any voiced/voiceless distinctions based on stress (i.e.
   when stress comes on the preceding vowel, you get a voiceless obstruent
   and when it comes afterwards, you get a voiced one).  These new Verner's
   Law like alternations are found in German: Hannover /f/ and Hannoveraner
   /v/ and on the phrase level: das muss /z/ ich doch machen (because stress
   follows the [ss] and does not precede it).

   Can you think of any examples in Yiddish?  There is one more example I
   can think of in German: nerven /f/ and nervoes /v/.

Thank you,
Nina Warnke
