Subject: Yiddish Word Order

Ellen Prince:

I have done as you suggested and spoken to a number of the native
Yiddish speakers with whom I have contact. The consensus regarding
the verb placement is that, to them, sentenses constructed other
than in accordance with the rules I explained do not sound natural
or correct. Most of the people to whom I spoke have never studied
Yiddish in a formal setting or did not do so until after they had
learned the language "naturally".

It is remarkable, but true, that the Yiddish language, for all of
its diverse dialects and  pronunciations is highly consistent in its
grammatical structure. In my experience, the study of grammar (in
any other language) has always been a frustrating one because there
seemed to be rules where the exceptions outnumbered the examples
that followed the rule. However, when I did take a Yiddish course at
University, I found Yiddish grammar to be consistent and easy to
absorb.

True, you may find individuals that speak in a different way, other
than the rules would indicate. However, these individuals (in my
experience) are rare and are often influenced by the grammar of a
second language that may have dominated the region where they
learned their Yiddish.

From: Hal Berman <hberman@edu.uwo.ca>
Subject: Ellen Prince's comment about word order.

        My brother's comments about word order were based on
Weinreich because that is the rule.   The rules are based on the
language as it was spoken (basically codifying an oral language that
had been developing over 1000 years).

	Because we are native speakers, and learned from people, not
the book (the book is in English, we didn't know english when we
learned Yiddish), we speak "natural" Yiddish. Every Yiddish speaker
I know (most older than the book) follows the word order rule.

	Now are you convinced?

Subject:  Yiddish New Testament

I have a Yiddish Humash published by Christians for missionary
purposes and very different from Yeho'ash's classic translation.
The title is Sefer Torah Nevi'im, u-ksuvim, das izt di gantze srift
fan dem alten testament [a dead give away of its non-Jewish origin]
traya und richtig iberzetzt fan lashon ha-kodesh oif yudish-daitch
fan Mordechai Shmuel Bergmann und zardfeltig iberzehen fan R' Aharon
Bernshtein gedrikt in Landan [London] oyf kasten der Britishen und
Oyslendishen Bibel [Bible] Gezel-lshaft, 1893.

A stamp on the verso of the title page states in English:
Volume 1.
Yiddish Pentateuch
Tentative Edition.

From: Seymour Axelrod <PTYAXEL@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu>
Subject: Verb position/Yiddish New Testament

1.  Verb position:  The issue now appears to be definitional, so why
not drop it?  There is unlikely to be agreement between the two
sides on exactly what is meant by "rule", "exception",
"license"--perhaps even by "all", "always" and "never"--so no
accumulation of unquestionably acceptable declarative sentences with
verb first is likely to convince the Bermans.  As Abe Igelfeld said
a few numbers back:  iz meyle.

2.  Der bris khadoshe af yidish:  I have the first edition (1941) of
the Einspruch translation that ellen prince has the 1977 edition of.
(1977!  What Yiddish-speaking Jews were they trying to convert that
late in history?)  The English title page lists the Lederer
foundation, but also the American Board of Missions to the Jews of
Brooklyn.  The orthography is quite YIVO-acceptable, and the
language fluent.  By contrast, another translation I have (undated
but maybe 30 years older, translator unnamed) put out by The
Distribution Fund in Chicago, is full of daytshmerisms.

I'm assuming that Einspruch was born Jewish--the English title page
calls him "Henry Einspruch, D.D.", but the facing Yiddish title page
calls him "Dr Khaim Aynshprukh".  I wonder what  motivated him to
undertake such a translation?  Convert's zeal seems the likeliest
possibility.  But I suppose that other reasons might be found, e.g.,
academic/literary interest, desire to enlighten Jews from eastern
Europe about the wider world and its beliefs.  It's worth
remembering that some first-rate Yiddish writers (e.g., Itsik
Manger, Sholem Asch) had considerable familiarity with Christianity.
(Asch in particular drew heavily on the New Testament for his
once-controversial trilogy on Jesus, Mary and Paul. Does someone
know what language he'd have known it in?)
