Subject: Introductions

We are a senior high school class at Bialik High School in Montreal,
Canada. As many of you know, Bialik High School is the only one of its
kind in North America, where Yiddish is part of the core curriculum.
There are 700 students in the school, approximately 130 in the senior
class. Some of the students in the school have been learning Yiddish
since grade 1 in the Jewish Peoples' and Peretz School, the elementary
branch of the High school. Others only began studying Yiddish at the
high school Level.

Our particular class of 18 students are relative newcomers to the
language. Our teacher, Anna Gonshor, has embarked on a project with us
entitled, "Why Yiddish?" We have already studied the history of the
Yiddish language and the beginnings of modern Yiddish literature in
order to be able to understand the role of Yiddish in the shaping of
modern Jewish identity.

Part of our project also includes interviews with individuals who are
involved in some way with Yiddish. This brings us to you. We would like
to have you participate in our project by responding to our invitation
via Mendele. It is our hope that we will meet people from various
backgrounds and ages with varied interests and reasons for being
interested in  and committed to Yiddish.

We hope to find approximately 20 interested individuals to respond with
on an ongoing basis. We plan to post a summary of the project on the
list for all Mendelyaners to enjoy.

We are quite excited about this project and hope that you share some of
our enthusiasm. If you do, please respond to the list. We will then
choose from among the responders to ensure as varied a sampling as
possible, and then communicate with you individually.

A groysn dank.

Please respond in English, as some of us are still only learning
Yiddish.

Subject: Zamenhof and Yiddish

The following two bibliographies of Zamenhof in Esperanto give a short
but reliable account of his knowledge of Yiddish:

Holzhaus, A. 1969. Doktoro kaj lingvo Esperanto. Helsinki. (pp. 19-34)

Maimon, N. Z. 1978. La kashita vivo de Zamenhof. Tokyo. (pp. 71-78)

By the way, Zamenhof, under the pseydonym of Dr. X, wrote an article
entitled "Vegn a yidisher gramatik un reform in der yidisher shprakh" in
_Lebn un visnshaft_, no. 1 (1909).

On a possible Yiddish influence on Esperanto, see, for example, the
following articles:

Gold, D. L. 1980. Towards a Study of Possible Yiddish and Hebrew
Influence on Esperanto. In: Miscellanea Interlinguistica, ed. by I.
Szeldahelyi, Budapest, pp. 300-367.

Piron, C. 1984. Contribution a l'etude des apports du yidiche a
l'esperanto. Jewish Language Review 4: 15-29.

Subject: Alexander Pomerantz

Ron Robboy's interesting information about the late Alexander Pomerants
leads me to announce that immediately upon reading Kathleen Rose's
query, I sent word that I had known Pomerants for the last ten or so
years of his life, becuase he was my former wife's beloved uncle by
marriage to a sister of her mother. The good shames, Noyekh, simply
forwarded my message to Kathleen, thinking that that had been my real
intent; in the meantime I had sent her a copy anyway. I promised to try
to get more information from Ruby Heller, my former wife, who has indeed
let Kathleen know, through me, that she could be approached and that an
aunt of hers might have even more information.

Ron's information, as far as I can recall, seems quite accurate. Most of
the time that I knew him, Uncle Alex was working as a book-cataloguer in
the library of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City. I
always found him to be a kind, gracious man whose conversation and
company I enjoyed very much. I was greatly saddened by his final illess
and death.

Subject: Yiddish vegetarian writers

In answer to Pawel Dorman who wanted to know which Yiddish writers were
vegetarian, I can think of two, I. B. Singer and Melekh Ravitch. I'm
curious about the reason for the question.  What might be deduced from
the conjunction of vegetarianism with authorship in Yiddish?

Subject: Is Yiddish a fading language?

I am a High School student attending Bialik High School in Montreal
Quebec. My Yiddish class has a project about the current position of the
Yiddish language in today's literature and school system. This is a very
serious topic and I would like to see some well thoughout comments about
the issue.

Subject: "Meyerke mayn zun"

My name is Michelle. I'm a student at the University of Wisconsin at
Madison.  I am majoring in Vocal Performance and Semitic Studies.  I
have a problem that I hope someone can help me with. I am currently
working on a piece of music composed by Maurice Ravel for my Senior
Recital.  This piece, titled "Hebrew Song" (Mejerke, main Suhn),is from
his group "Four Folk Songs."  My problem is that Ravel wrote the text in
the vernacular French. I was told by my Rabbi that this piece is a
traditiional Yiddish folk song.   I would love to perform this piece in
Yiddish.  However, I cannot find the Yiddish text anywhere. Could
someone please help me either locate a copy of this song in Yiddish, or
(if possible) send me a copy of the words if they have them on hand?
Thank you so much for taking the time to read this message.  I would
appreciate any responses that I receive.
