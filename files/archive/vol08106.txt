Subject: "eysekh" 

Twice, or more, in Boris Sandler's story "bank-kvetshers" (in _toyern_), a
character uses as an interjection the word "eysekh" (shtumer-alef, tsvey
yudn, samekh, ayen, lange khof), a word not in my Weinreich, nor Harkavy.
And a word that I remember my mother and especially her mother use (their
Yiddish was from the Ukraine). 

Is this possibly related to "veys ikh!?" or "veys ikh vos!?" as in "Who
knows?" or "Nonsense!" or "Don't be silly!"? That fits the context, but I
thought I'd ask anyway.

Subject: nitl

I was surprised to see Leonard Pragers report on Szajkowski's writings about
nitl, which is interpreted to mean "carol", and is no doubt an authoritative
interpretation. We used Nitl not only for Christmas but for other Christian
holidays, e,g, Easter, and it was meant to be a day in which learning of
Torah was omitted, and other "entertainments" such as card playing, were
substituted.

It was my understanding that the word means nitul from Hebrew, i.e. taken
away, referring to the obligation to "learn". Furthermore, it was said to
have originated in the Middle Ages, when on such days attacks on jews might
be threatening, and congregating in the Beth Hamidrash was dangerous.

Subject: zidlung

On Dec. 18, 1998 Ruth Goodman asked for the meaning of some Yiddish words.
The only one I think I understood was "zidlung." To the best of my knowledge
it means cursing. Zidlehn means to curse. At least that's what I thought my
Yiddish teacher told me not to do when I was a child.  ("Zidlehn is nisht
shein.") Zeit Alle gezunt.

Subject: zidlung, etc.

Re Ruth Goldman's request for words:

"vlakh" in Russian "blyakh" is a rigid piece of metal.  "grabia"  are spoils
in a theft.  "Grabli" is a horse comb.  "zidlung" is an insult.  "bazidlung"
to insult

Perhaps N. Miller could write where in Sholem Aleichem he  found "farvarfn
genz."

Subject: zidlung, etc.

Ruth Goodman inquires about the meaning of:
grabia:  grabye - a rake (the implement used to gather leaves, not the
human kind.
zidlung:  a scolding

Subject: zidlung, etc.

In response to Ruth Goodman's inquiry about the yiddish word "zidlung" I
offer the translation - insult.  I am most familiar with the usage such as
-- er hut mir up gezidelt where the infinitive is probably "zidlen".

Subject: Idiom needed

A friend of mine has asked me for a Yiddish idiom which would convey the
concept of buttering someone up, i.e., telling him/her more than what is
necessary, and not necessarily truthful.  He said that the term "to shmear" 
was close but not quite good enough.  I have perused all of Yosef Guri's
"1000 Yiddish Idioms" (wonderful book!), but was unable to find anything
which seemed applicable.  I assured my friend that without a doubt someone
on Mendele would come up with the right phase.  Nu?

David Herskovic writes: "According to vaynraykh yidish for doughnuts is
donats. Had vaynraykh not heard of pontshkes?"

Are there any terms or variants thereof in Yiddish which can be traced
to the Laaz language?
A dank!
