Subject: Kvit

I would like to amend what our Moderaior wrote on the origin of "Kvit."  In
German "Quitt" means "we are even" (I don't owe you anything) and in
Czernwitz we used to use the word both in German and Yiddish (it may be a
"Daytshmerizm" and we should ask Mordkhe for an authoritative opinion.

BTW, the word occurs in Romanian "chit" (pronounced kit), French (quitte --
Liber\'e d'une dette p\'ecuniaire - Larousse), and is certainly of Latin
origin -- from "quietus." (English quiet).

Subject: cross-linguistic homonyms; Peter

1. David Sherman describes Yiddish-English homonyms in his family. Of the 3
examples he cite, 2 work: "vent" and "mist". I don't think the 3rd one does.
As a Torontonian, David should easily perceive the distiction in the vowels
of English "writer" and "rider"; (many Americans/New Yorkers? do not). In my
own speech, the vowel in Yiddish "tayl" - that of English "writer", while the
vowel of English "tile" - that of English "rider" (more or less, that is). 

There are numerous instances of Yiddish cross-dialectal homonyms that merit
collecting: 

vaynik - 'winey'/'insufficient'
hun - 'hen'/'rooster'
layb - 'body'/'lion'
veynen - 'cry'/'dwell'
breyt - 'broad'/'board'/'bread'

2. As I recall, the name "Peter" is among those listed in the 11-12th century
Jewish martyrologies during the Crusades (the Nuerenburg Memorbuch, as I
recall).

Subject: Yiddish as a foreign language

Sylvia Schildt posts excerpts from Spolsky and Shohamy's _Natl Profiles of
Lgs in Education: Israel: Lg Policy_, for which I thank her -- very
interesting. But at one point she makes a comment that I think needs to be
addressed: "[ My comment: Yiddish is dealt with as a foreign tongue ... the
mame loshn of Ashkenazi Jewry is not dealt wity under the rubric of "Mother
Tongue Education" -- what is wrong with this picture? ]" 

I see nothing wrong with it. It IS a foreign language in Israel! 

Consider these analogies: 

Imagine that a very large number of the world's Gypsies returned to their
homeland in India. They would no doubt try to learn the modern version of
their ancestral tongue, say, Hindi (I don't actually know which Indian
language they originally spoke). But some of them, especially the older ones,
would no doubt continue to speak the languages they grew up speaking, with
those from Slovakia speaking Slovak Romany, those from Spain speaking Spanish
Romany, those from Egypt speaking Arabic Romany, etc etc etc. Those are all
'their' languages -- no one but Gypsies has ever spoken any of them as a
native language -- but they would still be foreign languages back in the
Indian homeland. It might be important to them to eventually teach those
languages in the schools, in memory of their 1500 years in the Diaspora and
to keep alive certain traditions that developed in that period -- but the
languages would still be foreign in India. (Of course, India already has
about 20 official languages -- but I doubt they'd be up for adding another 20
or 30! ;) ) 

And, as long as I'm at it: Of all the Jewish Diaspora languages, Yiddish is
by far in the best situation since it's the only one that still has a real
speech community, i.e. a community where children grow up speaking Yiddish as
their first language and where their neighbors and grocers and butchers etc
do too. There is no such community today in the world for Ladino,
Judeo-Persian, Judeo-Catalan, Judeo-Marathi, Judeo-Arabic, etc etc etc. So
maybe we can _fargin_ Ladino a few bucks before us -- they're in a bigger
hurry, nebekh.

Finally, what *I* fear happening is quite different from what you fear.  I'm
afraid that Yiddish will actually make it as a 'foreign language' in the
Israeli curriculum, as it is making it in increasing numbers of colleges and
universities in the Western world -- but that it will be totally cut off from
the Yiddish that is actually being spoken today by its young native speakers
-- yes, the little haredim. I would hate to see all these Yiddish classes
frozen in a sort of 'Victorian Yiddish' period, even as the language is
living and changing (as all living languages do). That would be a real shame,
IMO. But it could happen so long as our primary motivation is nostalgia for
what was rather than interest in the language as it is. Vos geven iz geven,
iz nisht do... 

Stepping off soapbox... ;)

Subject: Yiddish in Israel

In 08.042 Yosef Gilboa states that "until quite recently (with the advent of
non-Yiddish-speakers into Israeli politics), all important cabinet meetings
were conducted in Yiddish". 

I am convinced that this is not correct and that all cabinet meetings were
held in Hebrew.  While some ministers might have used from time to time a
Yiddish word or phrase, the language used was Hebrew.  I wonder if Yosef has
any source on which he can base his claim.

Gut shabes, Shabbat Shalom,

Subject: "shudnikas"

First of all I have a reply to John Levitow. I have a copy of Vu Zeinnen
Meine Zeiben Gitn Yahr, words and music by David Meyerowitz. In my doc. film
At the Crossroads: Jews in Eastern Europe Today, one of my main characters
Eli Mermelstein from Kosice, Slovakia sings a couple of verses of the song.

Having done a lot of research in Eastern Europe conducting field research on
klezmer I came across this word "shudnikas" used by several klezmorim I met
from the Lviv region. I know there were several "klezmer loshns" that
basically are extinct in terms of them being used at all today among klezmer
revivalists. Any idea what "shudnikas" meant?

A dank,
Yale Strom
