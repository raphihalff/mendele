Subject: Introduction, spinach cholent and a ptcha story

Spinach cholent sounds zeyer geshmacht mit an interessant tam- if I were to
make any kind of cholent I would give this one a try. 

At least ten years ago, when there seemed to be more time for everything,
there was a circle of women friends here in Austin who got together very
rarely and irregularly for the sole purpose of enjoying our Jewishness.  We
were all first generation, long time Texas residents, but originally, by
various routes from the Northeast.  We called ourselves The Yentas, and those
of us with daughters had Yentas- in- training. ( I can't speak for the others,
but mine have all entered very gracefully and naturally into full blown
yentahood.  I couldn't be prouder.) 

Strangely enough, we were all social worker or psychologist psychotherapists. 
Our usual activity consisted of going off for a day to interesting outlying
towns, to poke around, explore, have lunch, using the car trip as an
opportunity to tell Jewish jokes, use as much Yiddish as possible in
conversation and to share stories of our very diverse Jewish backgrounds. 
Several times we shared a holiday meal--usually at Hanukah. ( Be patient, I'm
getting to the ptscha) 

One time we were together, discussing what our next activity might be, and the
idea came up to gather for a non- holiday , but totally jewish meal, and we
teased our palates talking about everyone's favorites--holischkes, kasha
varnishkes, pirogen, stuffed derma, and so on.  I had never seen, let alone
eaten pstcha, but had read about it and had seen recipes. So I asked if
someone would make it.  Several of the others were not intimately familiar
with it, but knew what it was--more or less.  There followed a collective
sharing of ptscha-lore.  Then one of the women interrupted , and said, " I
know what we can do-----let's have a ptscha-ma party !" 

We never did it, but it's a memory I cherish, since the days of the Yentas
seem to be over.  and it surfaced only because I 've been fairly recently
introduced to mendele and the ptscha discussions. 

As a mendele newcomer, I have a few more comments.  First, I am not personally
offended by the disparity between the professional linguists, and the others,
like myself, who enjoy reading all of the entries for the simple reason that
they love Yiddish. The observed impatience or intolerance to me is a Jewish
characteristic.  I have spent , at various times a total of two years of my
life in Israel, the most intense Jewish experience one can have.  The vitality
I associate with Jewish life in that country reflects people being totally
engaged in every detail of life and living--pushing, shoving, driving like
maniacs, interupting, shouting, and so on.  Coming from the quiet, if not
silent household of my childhood, I rather enjoy the tumult and strong sense
of engagement (from time to time, at least)  I have enough quiet in my life to
look forward to a little jousting now and then. 

Finally, just another word about myself.  Although my parents were quite
learned in both Yiddish and Hebrew,I learned neither in my home,since they
only spoke English to us, and if they spoke Yiddish to each other it wasn't
very often.  But I was sent to Camp Boiberik at a very young age-- five, in
fact, and continued to go until I was 13. 

My last summer there I have memories of everyone talking about the atom bombs
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and how the war would soon be over. 

But my most compelling memories of Boiberik were the annual summers' end
"Felke Yontif", complete with music, dancing, and lavishly ornate costumes
made from hundreds of bolts of cheap fabric.  The most powerful memory of all
was the grand finale, every year, when we all sang, to the theme of
Beethovan's Ode to Joy: 

Alleh menshen zinen brieder
Shvartzeh, viseh, roiteh, galeh,
Misht die farben oistzuzamen
Sis an oisgetrachte miseh.

Shvartzeh, viseh, roiteh, galeh,
Misht die farben oistzuzamen.
Alleh menshen zinen brieder
Fun ayn taten un ayn mamen.

A few years ago I returned to Camp Boiberik , newly incarnated as the thriving
Omega Institute. The lake had amazingly shrunk, exploding my lifelong pride in
traversing it at a pretty young age.  I found the spots where I broke my foot; 
where we played volleyball;  where we had Yiddish stories and songs around the
campfires;  where Leibush Lehrer held my hand as the youngest child as we lead
the entire camp to the dining hall, still in use, but no longer serving the
pitchers of cold borscht which I loved, and boney gefilteh fish which I hated. 

If I write again it will be a one-liner!

Subject: Soviet  Writers  in Translation

For Leah Zazulyer, a few more prose translations:

Isaac Babel _You Must Know Everything (Stories 1915-1937)_ Carrol and Graf
1984 ISBN 0-88184-027-0

Isaac Babel  _The Collected Stories_   Criterion Books 1955  

Howe and Greenberg, editors   _Ashes Out of Hope_   Fiction by Soviet Writers
Schocken Books SB605   Short Stories by Bergelson (Joseph Schur, The Hole
through which Life Slips, and Civil War)  Moshe Kulbak (Zelmenyaner) and Der
Nister (Under a Fence: A Revue)

I wonder if Leah is searching only for the Soviet poets....

as kids we played "Telephone" which shows how words get mixed up as they
pass from one ear to the other.I suggest that "khale khalelyes" is a mixed
up version of "ale kholeryes."

yougn american jews use the term ale drerden -- isn't that the same genre
of folk expression (as khale khalelyes?)

a propos, about americanisms in general, my beloved a.r. shul, mitl shul
and lerer seminar teachers were very against -anglicisms. some time had to
pass before we could understand that certain anglicisms could be accepted
as genuine yiddish words, just as with slavisms and other european
elements. these teachers had feared that yiddish would disappear in these
anglicisms. on the contrary, anglicisms actually added more nuances. vords
like: boitchik, olraytnik, shop, dzhob, avekmufn -- mirror the life of 4-5?
generations of jews.

Subject: Kurve

Every so often, one feels the need to describe someone in a less than
palatable fashion in Yiddish.  In just such a case, I have noticed that one of
the stock insults in my family's old neighborhood for a woman is "kurve."  I
worry about offending the sensibilities of mayne khaveyrim, so I will
charitably translate this as "lady of the night."  I can't find the word in
any dictionary (vos far an oyftreyslung!), so I can't be 100% sure of the
spelling.  This evening, a friend of mine from Hungary mentioned the word, and
was pretty certain that it is Hungarian.  Another in our group actually
wondered if Yiddish borrowed it from Hungarian, or the other way 'round.  So,
does anyone else know this word, and where it comes from?

Has Yiddish ever been used as a secret language for political purposes?
I'm not talking about parents who spoke Yiddish so the children would not
understand what was being said.  I'm asking if anyone known whether at any
time a Yiddish-speaking community used  Yiddish as a code language against
political or military enemies.  I'm looking for specific citations.

Subject: Eliezer Schindler

Who is or was Eliezer Schindler?  He is the author of a poem entitled "undzer
yidish," a stirring paean to the Yiddish language, which appears on Emanuel
Goldsmith's wonderful learning tape, "I Love Yiddish."  

Does anyone know when and where he lived, when he wrote the poem, what else he
wrote, what he was known for?

Subject: The story of Yiddish nasal vowels

W. H. Phillips's gracious posting nevertheless is not right.  Polish nasal
vowels are older than the nonnasals found in corresponding words in almost all
other Slavic languages, so that the Polish nasal in, e.g., ra,k 'of hands',
pronounced more or less 'rongk', represents a state of affairs more like that
found in the ancestral form of all Slavic languages than e.g., the Russian
nonnasal in ruk.  We know this from many sources, such as the way Slavic words
were represented in foreign languages a thousand or so years ago and the way
foreign nasals come out in Slavic, the fact that the oldest Slavic alphabet,
createdby Cyril and Methodius, had special letters for two nasal vowels, from
the Indo-European etymologies of the words in question (where Slavic nasals
correspond to sequences of vowel + nasal consonant), etc.  For example, the
neuter singular ending which is -ya in Russian (e.g., imya 'name')  but -e, (a
nasal 'e' vowel) in Polish corresponds to the -en ending in e.g. Latin nomen. 

And by the same token Yiddish nasal vowels in words like mayse represent the
original early Yiddish state of affairs, not some kind of late development,
and certainly not one due to Polish influence. In fact, Polish influence on
Yiddish is much overrated and could only affect dialects spoken in Poland, but
the Yiddish nasals occur or once occurred over a much larger territory. 

It may be of interest to note that ayin becomes a nasal not just in these
special cirucmstances in Yiddish (in my view, whenever it occurred before
another consonant), but as someone noted some weeks ago in Italian Hebrew as
well.  Even more interesting is teh fact that the Arabic ayin, which is
cognate with the Hebrew ayin, comes out as a nasal in some languages of Muslim
peoples which have borrowed Arabic words, esp. in Acehnese, one of the
languages of Western Indonesia. 

It is a general rule of thumb that any change you find in the history of one
language canbe found in the history of some other totally unrelated language. 
This is usually taken as evidence that sound change over time is not arbitrary
or conventional but rather a reflection of human physiology or perhaps the
psychology of speech production or perception.

From: Dembart <Dembart@aol.com>
Subject: A nekhtiger tog

"A nekhtiger tog" is something that's impossible, right?  What does it derive
from?

Leo Rosten says in "The Joys of Yiddish" that "nekhtiger" comes from German
"na[umlaut]chtiger" (nightly) and literally means, "a nightly day," i.e., an
impossibility.

But Fred Kogos says in "A Dicitionary of Yiddish Slang & Idioms" that
"nekhtiker" comes from Yiddish "nekhtn" (yesterday) and literally means,
"yesterday's day," i.e., gone forever and therefore impossible.  In their
"Yiddish Dictionary Sourcebook," Herman Galvin and Stan Tamarkin give the same
derivation ("yesterday's day.") 

Who's right?

From: "Stanley N. Werbow" <s.werbow@mail.utexas.edu>
Subject: p'tsha Hungarian

My wife's grandparents came from Hungary, and their term for p'tcha was
"kotcheninnye." I don't recall having seen that word among the long lists of
variants for the calve's foot delicacy. From the dictionaries (both Weinreich
and Harkavy) I am led to associate "kotshen" with cabbage and rolling, so that
I wonder whether my wife's memory is off and "kotcheninnye" may have to do
with rolled cabbage.  Can someone confirm?
