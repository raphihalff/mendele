Subject: Sukkah decorations and cultural borrowing

I've found the discussion on using Christmas decorations for sukkahs
fascinating.  We've done it for years; if you go shopping at G & Son
(a large general store in Boro Park) in September you'll find a good
selection.  I think Reyzl hit the nail on the head with her comments
to the effect that the less one is solidly grounded in Jewish
religious observance and ritual, the more "nervous" one is that
"someone" will think one is borrowing/using Christian traditions. I
believe it's also related to how comfortable one is displaying one's
own observances/traditions without feeling self-conscious.

On a related point, the best time for buying Purim costumes is, of
course, in November, when all the leftover Hallowe'en stuff is on
sale.  (That's in the secular stores, of course; I haven't been in
Boro Park in March.)

Az men sitzt baym tish muzn men kidish makhn, I found a yidish
translation of the traditional Tahnksgiving tale in "Gut Yontif, Gut
Yohr (edited by Maria Jaffe). It adds the right Yidish feel to
Thanksgiving. A great wit, Milton Himmelfarb?, once said that the
reason Jews are thankful on Thanksgiving is that the Pilgrims didn't
find a a pig. mit kovid,

Subject: Pseudonymity

Sholen Aleychem worked so well for Shalom Rabinowicz. I had once
thouht of changing my name to Moshe Exit. I'd have my name up in
lights in most public buildings , it's easy to spell and it's as
common a word as shoelm aleychem was to the average Jew not to very
long ago.

All the best,

Moshe Waldoks

Subject: Standardized transcription why?

I've been thinking about the debate a couple of months back between
those who insisted that all writing of Yiddish words in Latin
letters should be in the standard YIVO system, and those who
prefered more flexibility.  I don't think it was really a matter of
linguists vs. non-linguists, with the linguists opting for formality
and rigidity for reasons special to our own discipline. The impetus
for standard transcription comes partly from a desire to see Yiddish
treated like all other languages, with a sense of behaving
responsibly to the language as it presents itself to us on its own
without the interference of English habits nor as a jargon that can
be written any way you like; in this it is analogous (but not
identical) to the impetus to standardize Yiddish spelling,
vocabulary, etc.  (I'm NOT in favor of efforts to standardize
Yiddish spelling.)  On the other hand I think it comes from a horror
of what was done often years ago, when Yiddish was written in Latin
letters as much as possible like German, Ihr versteht was ich sog?
Yiddish is a language like all other languages, but yet it is not
just a version of some other language.

I've been noticing that the newspapers sometimes respell names of
people and places from Eastern European languages which use the
Latin alphabet, for instance adding an h to make the sh sound when
it is written in Croatian or Hungarian or Polish with a s (in some
cases with a diacritical mark that is lost in English).  But they
don't do the same with Scandinavian names, whose pronunciations are
equally unpredictable to most American readers.  Most of us would
like Yiddish to be treated like the latter, not the former: Yiddish
has its own way of doing things, why "pander to the ignorant",
kaviyokhl?

So much for motive; it still doesn't determine what ought to be
done.

Subject: Beheyme

Here's a bit of information relating to Arnold Kuzmack's question
about beheyme.  The wonderful Hebrew slang dictionary by Dahn
Ben-Amotz (Dan Ben-Amots) and Netiva Ben-Yehuda, The World
Dictionary of Hebrew Slang (Milon Olami le-Ivrit Meduberet), lists
it with two pronunciations: behemA (accent on the -A), which is the
normal Hebrew pronunciation for the word when it simply means large
domestic animal, and behEYme, a pronunciation borrowed from Yiddish,
as is the plural behEYmes (the plural in its literal meaning is
behemOt).  (Not only is the stress different, so is the vowel /e/
versus /ey/.) Both are defined as "a term for a stupid person,
idiot" and marked as both masculine and feminine.  The illustrations
which are given are: "Don't waste your words.  This (masc.) behEYme
won't understand you."  "And this (masc.) behEYme is going to study
law yet."  "This (fem.) behemA doesn't know the multiplication table
by heart."  No reference to fatness.
