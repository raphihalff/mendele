Subject: shlock/schoch

These shlock/schoch postings are beginning to sound like a Mel Brooks
routine.  I had always thought shlock was used as a derogatory description
of shoddy goods, but I hesitated to enter the fray.  But, thanks to Robert
Weman's posting (Vol 07.090) I'll be brave enough to put my two cents in as
well.  We also used the term schoch in describing the covering of the sukka
but went even further in that we called the cut branches  themselves
schoch.  In fact my father and mother were delighted when we bought our
first house (in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn) to discover that across
the street from us there was nothing (yet) but fields of "stuff" growing
which my parents described as schoch to use for the sukka.

Subject: davenen

When I first read in Weinreich that davenen has a pseudo-etymology which
maintains that comes it is from Aramaic and means from the patriarchs. I
tested the theory on an old Poylisher Khosid that I knew.  I asked him "Fin
vanen shtampt dus vort davenen?( What is the source of the word davenen?) He
answered, "Ale vaysn az es shtampt fin lushn koydesh, un es bedayt, fin inzere
Uves."( Everybody knows that it comes from the holy tongue, and it means from
the patriarchs).

Now after having read all the learned Mendeleyener theories about the origin
of word davenen,  I have to admit that I am  most taken by the old Poylisher
Khosid response, es shtampt fin inzere Uves.

Subject: early Yiddish book illustrations

Diane Wolfthal asked (Vol. 07.095) if other art historians work on Yiddish
book illustrations of the 16th and 17th centuries. Naomi Feuchtwanger Sarig
(Jerusalem) has done very interesting work on the illustrations to the
editions of _Seyfer minhogim_, the "Book of Customs".

Subject: Schmoozing on Satudrday Night Live

Since Bob Werman (7.095) has given the example of 'schmoozing' found in the
New Yorker, I will mention my posting of a few year's back that called
attention to Mike Meyer's regular feature on Saturday Night Live where he
imitated a Jewish female TV call-in host who had a program devoted to
"schmoozing" [the title escapes me now, but I think had 'schmooze' as part of
the title] where [s]he got all choked up over Barbra Streisand..., most
notable because Mike Meyer is not Jewish and knew no Yiddish until he moved to
New York.  Just another example of Yiddish into pop English.

P.S.  My posting on Hai and Topsy Frankl's record and book [7.095]
 contained an error that crept in unintentionally.  Their song book was
 _Jiddische Lieder_ as in the German, not "Yiddische"...

Subject: Davenen

Although some seem to have lost interest in the subject, I think Meyer Wolf's
clarification about the meaning of davenen [07.093] is very useful.  However,
perhaps we should soon take this to a different forum?  Anyway, I do think I
should respond to his critique briefly here:

I think there are a number of things one should not accept here. F.e., 
etymologies often involve"outlandish" changes in meaning (see the connection
between pork and porcelain as an example), which is why good etymologists
emphasize the details of the forms, as I have been saying over and over.  And
it is with respect to form that the da:vav etymology is superior to all
others.  I would also add that Meyer's semantic clarifications actually
probably help the case for this etymology, and certainly do not hurt it.  As
for what davnen replaced, that in my view is quite clear: the earlier Yd verb 
for this meaning was orn (which survived in most of Yd, but was replaced by
davn in Eastern Yd).  In my view, there must have been a time when the two
coexisted in EY, and at that time it might have been that orn was used for the
praying aloud which Meyer is concerned with.

In any case, let me reemphasize that this etymology is not mine, and that i do
not regard it as proven. However, it is to my mind incomprehensible that Meyer
(with whom of course I have been collaborating quite peaceably on other
topics) should not be willing to grant that this etymology is simply in a
different league from all the others that we know of. Etymologies such as
Turkic (Qypchaq) tabun-, Latin divin-, English dawn, MHGerman doeun-, Hebrew
daf simply do not account for the form dav-.  The etymology I keep defending
does.  Hence, all the others are to be dismissed, but this one still needs to
be taken seriously.  Of course, it still does not quite solve other problems
(as I have pointed out), but that in itself is another indications of the vast
difference: with the da:vav etymology, it makes sense to try to dot the last
i, with the other ones (which are completely unrealistic anyway), it does not.
This to me is a sign of the difference between a reasonable etymological
theory and ones which are not.

And I think that is really all that can be said here at present.

Subject: Schlock as sukkah cover (corrigendum)

The second paragraph of my note in Vol 7.095, did not get through. It stated
my reason for believing that schlock in "schlok zol dir trefen" refers to the
sukkah cover.

'Trefen' has an aspect of hitting a target or achieving a goal. If the ailment
were meant, 'khapen' or 'nemen' would be used.
