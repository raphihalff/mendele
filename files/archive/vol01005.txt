Subject: Yiddish in English

Ellen Prince's instances of English in Yiddish prompt
these examples of the reverse.  They're taken from 
Sol Steinmetz (Yiddish and English: A Century of Yid-
dish in America, University of Alabama, 1986).  

Steinmetz devotes a chapter to 'Jewish English', the
basic point of which is this:

    Whereas the ultra-Orthodox and Hasidic Jews
    have retained Yiddish as their primary lan-
    guage.., the Modern Orthodox have become by
    and large English speakers, though many of
    them are in varying degrees Yiddish-English
    bilinguals.  But while English is their pri-
    mary language, and often the only language
    they use (especially if they are American
    born), their form of English is to a greater
    or lesser degree influenced by, and often
    heavily dependent on forms and expressions
    of Eastern European origin. (p.83)

He quotes Joshua Fishman:

    JE in the USA, as used in Yeshiva circles
    (and is gaining currency in other circles
    with which the latter intersect), has incor-
    porated numerous word-by-word calques of
    Yiddish paraphrastic constructions common
    both in learned and in popular discourse:
    e.g., zay zikh mekhaven--be me mekhavn,
    'Should I be you mekhavn?'  These are expres-
    sions learned by students from their talmud
    instructors.  These students now study talmud
    in English translation.  The instructors seem
    to be transposing their fully routinized
    Yiddish translation into their Yiddish trans-
    lation.

Among the many words and phrases Steinmetz mentions, I
found these particularly interesting.  I also wonder    
a) how many of these words show up in the English
spoken by Forverts readers and b) how many show up even
in the _Yiddish_ spoken by Forverts readers.

    be meshadekh, zivig, hesped, be maspid,
    limudey koydesh, harabonis, zal, make a
    moytsi, make a lekhayim, say torah, write
    tnoyim, khap shirayim.

Some examples:

    Whatever the reason one wants to be with a
    Boro Park family--for a simcha, for a shid-
    duch, for companionship, for chinuch, for
    chizuck,...the Committee and its 90 baalei
    battim welcome you (Jewish Journal, Dec. 12,
    1975, p.22).

    Since we had only one Sefer Torah it was
    agreed that the Ashkenazim would leyn first
    ...and we leyned after the roll call (Jewish
    Life, July 1973, pp.45-46).

And my favorite:

    We must practice Ahavoh not Sinoh; we must
    build Yiddishkeit, not destroy it.  If a
    non-frum boy moves into your neighborhood..
    be mekarev him (Darkenu, July 1975, p.7).
