Subject: Language and culture of Greek Jews

For Kalmen Weiser: Asking about Romaniot, you might write the letter
you posted as an inquiry for advice to: MARGALIT MATITYAHU: Kiron
55454, ISRAEL.

Margalit is a Greek, who writes poetry in Ladino.  Her family is
Salonika.  But she is looking into that community and perhaps she
will have some leads for you . YOu might also ask if she has leads
into that community via the Cairenes, man y of whom might be
Romaniot connnected, and who left for Israel after 1948.

Subject: Language and culture of Greek Jews

For Kalmen Weiser: If you haven't already done so, consult Paul
Wexler, "Recovering the dialects of Judeo-Greek in non- Hellenic
Europe," in J.A.Fishman (ed.) Readings in the Sociology of Jewish
Languages (1985): 227-240; and Max Weinreich, History of the Yiddish
Language, Index s.v. Yavan and Yavanic.

Write directly to Professor Paul wexler, Department of Linguistics,
Tel Aviv University.

If you do your graduate work in NY,you can use the Yiddish Atlas as
a model to design a study among Greek Jewish emigrants.

By the way, is your name (Kalmen) a conscious reflection of
your Greek-Jewish forebears?

Best wishes.
Mikhl Herzog.

Subject:  YUNG YIDDISH opening

YUNG YIDDISH celebrated the opening of their new house in Jerusalem
on Thursday evening, 27 Jan.

Mendy Cahan, the director of this new organization, has defined Yung
Yiddish as a contemporary Yiddish culture center...

Now in a rented Romema basement, they are collecting unused Yiddish
books... This beginning follows from three years as the Israeli
branch of the "National Yiddish Book Center". (Yung Yiddish received
non-profit organization status in Jan. 1993.)

So far they have collected about 35,000 books, according to the
leading zamler, Russian oleh and Hebrew University Yiddish student
Pinchas Maurer.

Along one cement wall are new, compact book shelves which move on
tracks. (These library shelves were designed by Bezalel Architecture
Dept. lecturer Phillipe-Ami Holtzman, among the volunteers who have
fixed up the place.)

At the opening of the Yung Yiddish bookhouse, a cosmopolitan and
bohemian gathering of 50 "Yiddishists and friends in solidarity"
toasted the event with songs, recitations, and slivovitz.

Among those who spoke (not in Yiddish, but in Hebrew, French,
Russian...), there were: a mathematics professor from the Technion;
a local Italian restauranteur (in fedora); a literature lecturer
(Dr. Michal Guvrin); a library student in the National Library; and
many Yung Yiddish zamlers and volunteers.

Among the Yiddish offerings:

-    Ruth Levin sang Yosef Papiernikoff's "Zol zayn..."  (melody by
     Sidor Bilarsky, an anthem for Israeli Yiddishists).

-    An undergraduate, Russian oleh declaimed a 1950s *Sovietishe
     Heymland* accolade to the "shaliakh tsu himmel, Grigarin,
     Yuri".

-    Mendy Cahan led the local rap version of Leivick verses, with
     community chorus "veiter"; which they first made known at the
     Yiddish Film Festival at the Jerusalem Cinematheque last year.

-    Benyamin Zemach sang "what a Chasid would do for his rebbe".
     Shukling between shelves and back of a chair, it was a dramatic
     song by the spry, 94-year old, emeritus Tel Aviv theater
     professor, an associate of Stanislavsky, a co-founder of
     Habimah...

It was near last buses, the Motsaeh Tu B'Shvat moon between clouds
high overhead, when Yung Yiddish rolled the new book shelves to bed.

Yung Yiddish can be reached at:
     Mail:     P.O.B. 24193 / Mt. Scopus / Jerusalem.
     Fax:      (03)-528-3625.
     Address:  Rehov Yermiyahu 52 / Romema / Jerusalem.
     Tel:           (02)-371322
(Current hours, Wed., 11:00-15:00; north of Egged central bus station, near
J. Post press).

PS (Incidentally, apropos theater history, the early Chagall works
   exhibition at the Israel Museum will close on February 14th.)
