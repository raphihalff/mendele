Dear Mendele & worldwide friends: the various comments on
knocking the head against the wall, to alleviate boredom on a
sleety Bronx winter day in the 1930s ( in my case), set me to
wondering what the figure was about.  If one has nothing (better)
to do, one is advised to knock one's head against the wall.  Is
the root of this advice some sardonic skeptical (worldly) advice
that those who are unemployed should daven?  It seems a likely
kind of sarcasm to me; but then my family, and many others no
doubt, were a steelyhearted skeptical lot.  I know how hard it
is to get to the root of any adage; but one may speculate. In any
case, I never understood what my mother meant by it; I know,
however, that when I took her exasperate admonition to heart and
began smashing my head against the wall, and denting the plaster
and paint, she was appalled at my literal nasty folly.  Darling,
darling! the poor bloody head was cradled...and everything was
laughter, later, at some Sunday retelling.  The other head
knocking I can reca ll occurs in a marvellous Babel story, or is
it the father's fists against the john's door? where the lad is
locked in,in fear, because he has never gone to the violin
lessons, like Jascha Heifetz and Nathan Milstein and the rest of
those youthful Odessa geniuses, but gone instead (like this
Jascha) to the docks to hear the yarns of an old sailor....It has
a marvellous ending, if some of us recall, with the old
grandfather passing by as the boy goes down to drown himself for
the third time in the rainbarrel's water...Where are you going,
Zaydeh? asks Babel, and the old man says with blistering
contempt, I am going to take some castor oil.  Why, Zaydeh? So
as to have something to put on your grave! That is the sort of
family I can recall surrounding my childhood.  Anyway, why is
that command to knock one's head against the wall as a remedy for
boredom given?  It puzzles me still.

Kessler here, still.

Subject: literature, idioms

1) I'm with Bob Werman: although I'm a linguist, I'd love to hear
   more about literature. Besides not being too sophisticated on
   literary matters, I'm still in the slow process of becoming
   well-read in Yiddish. I'm just reaching the end of the first
   volume of Sholem Aleykhem's "Funem Yarid", and finding it only
   moderately interesting. Anyone care to explain to me what I'm
   missing?

2) Please do compile a list of idioms -- I have Bernshteyn &
   Stutshkov, but they rarely explain the idioms, since they
   expect you to understand them already :-( A list could be a
   big help to advanced learners!

Subject: introductions all around

Hello to the Mendele community,

	My name is Lisa (Leah) Jenschke, and I'm a graduate
student in Yiddish and German at Ohio State University.  I only
recently fell in love with Yiddish and I have to heartily thank
Neil Jacobs here for his (unpaid) tutorials and both him and
David Miller for taking me on as a graduate student.

I grew up in the flat, hot city of Dallas, did my undergraduate
work at UPenn in Philly and now I'm here in central Ohio,
wondering when I will ever get all my reading done.

I wanted to respond to the non-literature types who feel they have
nothing to add to a discussion of Yiddish literature.  I think many
an author would be dismayed to think that only literature types
could respond to and discuss his/her work.  As an author, I would
feel that I had failed to connect with the reader, to suspend his or
her disbelief, to strike a responsive chord.  I guess I believe that
most people read because they are looking for part of themselves in
the text.  They want to find out more about themselves.  So, unless
all linguists are inhuman, they are probably looking too. I'll get
off of my soapbox now.  Hopefully, this struck a chord somewhere.

Please feel free to send me e-mail at
ljenschk@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu

Hope to hear from you,  Leah

Subject: Yiddish literature

I know that many Mendelniks are linguists and that others teach in
departments where Yiddish is regularly taught.  I wonder how many
others have an opportunity to include Yiddish works in appropriate
courses.  For example, SUNY Fredonia is not a hotbed of Yiddish
studies, but I have managed to teach any number of Yiddish works
over the years in courses on satire or on religion in literature.
Now that multiculturalism has become such a force (and I'm all in
favor of it), I can include Yiddish works in even more of our core
major courses that require a multicultural focus. What books might
people be teaching.

Also, on a related topic, I'm teaching a course in the fall on Black
and Jewish literature, which will devote considerable attention to
our Yiddish heritage, both for its intrinsic value and for its
influence on American literature.  I would appreciate advice on any
aspect of this course from anyone who feels moved to offer some.

Ted Steinberg
