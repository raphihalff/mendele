Subject:  Boiberik and Anatevka -- Tikn toes

(1) In my Aug. 27 posting (MENDELE 3.096), I mistransliterated the
title of Dr. Khariton Berman's article.  Instead of "Keyn Boyberik
un Anatevka vu s'hot gevoynt Tuvye der milkhiker..." I inadvertently
wrote "... vo s'hot gevoynt..."  Ikh shver benemones az dos iz geven
a posheter drukfeler (vayl keyn germanist bin ikh dokh nit)!

(2) One of my own sentences got garbled, in my haste to get the
message off.  I should have written:  "It appears that the Bermans
were not the first to undertake such a pilgrimage, because the
locals in Boyarka have preserved the memory of Sholem Aleichem, and
they continue to collect memorabilia relating to him and to his
literary protagonists."

Subject: Sluschei

According to my mother and her mother, the word is polish in origin.
It means LISTEN.

Subject: Introduction

     I'm a linguist who teaches and does research on language
change, the History of English and other languages (incl. Germanic,
African and Asian tongues).A former long-time resident of Brooklyn,
I am a speaker of a variety of Yiddishized English -- i.e. the
colloquial language typical of second or third generation Jews in
New York and other centers of Jewish population in the U.S.. My
interests in Yiddish are centered on its development over time, its
affect on American dialects and its place in the modern world.

Subject: question about yiddish exclamations

this is a question for a friend who is interested in yiddish syntax
who doesn't currently have access to email.  he is interested in
knowing whether it is possible to have exclamations with the
(tensed) verb in first position, as is possible in other germanic
languages (like the following german examples):

is he an idiot!
boy, does that ever make life easier!
won't she be thrilled.

many thanks in advance.

Subject: Introduction

Dan Kirschner told me about this list and sent me a summer's worth
of back issues to get my feet wet.  I would like to join the list as
a "lurker" :-)  My Yiddish is practically zilch, but a background in
Hebrew, a smattering of German and Russian, and of course a long
major in English help me decode bits and pieces.  Anyway the topics
are interesting and I promise I'll be quiet.

I have a Master's in Near Eastern Languages and Literature (major
Hebrew, minor Arabic).  But that was then ...  now I write about
computers and the Internet.
