Subject: Re: Rekude Potash

In a message dated 12/23/03, Ben Potash writes:<<I am writing in reference to
a photograph of a Jewish writer named Rekude Potash that I found on your
website. My name is Benjamin Potash and the woman in the picture bears an
uncanny resemblence to several members of my family. I was wondering if you
had any information about this woman or knew of any sources where I could find
information.>>

My desire to help Mr. Potash prompted me to go to: www.jewishgen.org, where I
used its "Family Finder" to look up others who are researching the surname
POTASH. As might be expected from the name and the use of potash in gardening,
I found quite a few listings. I also checked Jewishgen's Discussion Group
Archives, and there I found a message describing a book entitled "Found
Treasures: Stories by Yiddish Women Writers" published by Second Story Press,
Toronto, Canada.

This book  includes page-long biographies for each of the writers of each of
the stories  including "Rekudah Potash." So Ben Potash may want to find a copy
of the book in order to read Rekudah Potash's biography.

According to the one website I found for this author, she wrote  a book of
poems "Moyled iber Timna"(New Moon over Timna) which was publised in Jerusalem
in 1959 or 1960.

Subject: Re: Rekude Potash

In response to Benjamin Potash's query about Rikuda Potash (Czestochowa,
Poland  1906 - Jerusalem, Israel 1965),  I would point him and others who are
interested in this unique poet to my forthcoming book "What Must Be Forgotten:
Yiddish in Zionist Palestine" (Syracuse University Press, 2004), in which
Potash's Palestinian poetry is the subject of a chapter. The book is based on
my 2001 Ph.D. thesis at the University of California, Berkeley. Since my
research on Potash is ongoing, I would be grateful for any more information
that people might have, particularly on her life in Poland before 1934, when
she immigrated to Palestine.  I am answering Ben Potash separately.

Yosl Kurland asks who wrote this. It was Avrom Reisen, and it's one of my
favourite stories. It can be found in many anthologies for Yiddish schools, as
well as in collections of Reisen's mayselekh.

In regard to the query about the story THE JEW WHO DESTROYED THE TEMPLE, it is
by Avrom Reyzen, and iv e included it in my collection of Yiddish stories from
1382 to the present: no star too beautiful.

Subject: Arbeter Ring in London, 1938-46

In Mendele Vol. 13.006 / December 14 , 2003, Sara Goudge sent in a query re:
the Arbeter Ring in London, 1938-46.  A number of books have recently been
published about the English community in general in terms of its reactions to
the persecutions of the Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe during the Holocaust
years.  However, to get information on the Yiddish speaking community in
London's East End to the persecutions of the Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe
during the years 1938-1946, the best place to look would be some of the
Yiddish-language publications of the time.  Not just UK publications in
Yiddish, but also the Jewish Daily Forward, which, during the years in
question still had the largest worldwide circulation of any Jewish - and
Yiddish - publication.  Many Yiddish readers in the UK read the New York-based
publication regularly.

As part of her work involves the Arber Ring [that is, the Arbeiter Ring -
known in the UK generally as the Workers Circle, not the Workmen's Circle, as
in the USA and Canada], someone must know -- or know of someone who would know
-- if the AR in the UK had any publication[s] of its own.

If I am not mistaken, there was also at least one additional Yiddish
publication in the UK at that time - probably more.

The last chapter of the book JEWS, LABOUR AND THE LEFT 1918-1948 [Ashgate
2000] has a rather extensive bibliography of [primarily] English-language
sources dealing with the Jews and the trade union movement[s] in the UK and
the USA.  [I compiled that chapter: it's quite good, thank you, thank you.]
Included are articles, books and other sources on such groups as there were in
the Jewish labor movement of those years in these two countries.

Subject: Re: deyzhe borsht

Mikhoyel Basherives (Mendele Vol.13.005) is not the only one stumped by
"deyzhe borsht" (13.005).  Yehude Elzet writes in his _Yidishe makholim_
(Warsaw, 1920, p. 93): "Umfarshtendlekh iz mir bay Mendele Moykher Sforim
'geven in deyze borsht fartrogn'" ("Tsores hobn im dem kop farshlogn/ iz geven
in deyze borsht fartrogn").  He also cites another example from MMS: "Der
ibriger oylem undzerer, funem miteln sort mentshn iz tomid fartrogn in deyzhe
borsht" and one from Linetski's _Dos poylishe yingl_:  "Fun di ale vaynen, iz
gevorn besekhakl tsen butelkes, vi reyzhe (?) borsht."

In an article called "In mayn mames kikh" (_Yidish shprakh_ 12 [1952], 4)
Shoel Hurvits (Saul Horowitz) mentions a _deyzhke_ as a vat for water to sour
cabbage or cucumbers and a big _deyzhe_ as a container used for leavening
bread (tsu farroshtshinen  broyt).

In Russian _dezha_ is a kneading trough and can also dialectally refer to
leavened dough; there are related words with just the first or with both
meanings in Polish, Belorusian and Ukrainian as well.

None of this answers Mikhoyel's question, although perhaps the answer is
connected with the fact that Russian _borshch _ (and Jewish borsht?) can be
based on various liquids, including _kvas_, the beer-like drink made from
fermented grain and/or bread.

Subject: Re: vos heyst 'a mentsh'?

I agree with you entirely, 'a mentsh' is not a 'cool guy', unless we take the
adjective 'cool' to be synonymous with admirable, out of the ordinary, a model
for the rest of us..

And the "image" I have of a mentsh goes far beyond the concept of an "English
gentleman": who is too pale a figure, too steeped in his own culture's
conventions.

Robin Hood - there, perhaps, is a figure of 'a mentsh' !

"a mentsh is someone who acts justly and is compassionate and kind toward
everyone without further distinction", you say.

No, that is not enough. There is, in my opinion, another characteristic of a
'mentsh' and that is that he will remain just and charitable EVEN IN THE FACE
OF DANGER TO HIMSELF, or in the face of majority attitudes and opinions with
which he disagrees. The Israeli air pilots and conscientious objectors who
refuse to fight in Palestinian territories are eminently "mentshen" in my
opinion !!

Subject: Re: vos heyst 'a mentsh'?

Noyekh Miller's musings on the meaning of "mentsh" (Mendele 528.5) reminded me
of my parents' long-departed Labrador retriever, Winston. Winston was a
wonderful dog: calm and gentle in demeanor, courageous and protective, loyal
and obedient. He was neither whiny nor demanding, and despite serious health
problems his entire 13-year life (including a gunshot wound in his neck, a
collapsed vertebra, and an almost life-ending bout of meningitis), the dog
maintained his dignified disposition. As my mother used to say all the time
(and still does today), "Winston was a mentsh!"
