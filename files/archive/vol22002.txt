Subject: May 27 
Date: tsitsilist

Veronica Belling is asking about the meaning of the word "Tsitsilist": it is a corruption of 
"socialist". The word also exists in Lithuanian, usually referring to the revolutionaries of 
1905.

Subject: tsitsilist

Just a guess for the roots of "tsitsilist":

Might this word be a jab at the gratuitous free-thinker for incessantly asking questions or 
weighing alternatives (i.e., overusing the Yiddish "tsi")?

Best,
Jordan Brown

Subject: tsitsilist

"Tsitsilist" was used on the Lower East Side by immigrants who could not easily 
pronounce "Socialist."  May have found its way to Europe and taken on a sarcastic 
meaning.  Remember, the word, "shap" was born the same way and made its way to 
Europe.

Subject: poyer/know-it-all/reb(b)e/tsitsilist/

Responses to:

1) Jules Levin: The German "bauer" for farmer or peasant is the obvious derivation of 
"poyer." I'll leave it to the etymologists to find the origin of the German word...

2) Barbara Krasner: for "know it all" I'd suggest: a khokhem fun der manishtane. Lit: A 
wise man from the "ma nishtana" -- i.e., someone whose depth of wisdom is limited to 
knowing the simple question asked by children at the peysekh seyder.

3) Norbert Hirschhorn: The appeal to the confusion of "a non-Jewish friend" hardly 
invalidates the YIVO Standard. Remember the hapless politician who pronounced the 
"accepted" transliteration of "chutspah" to great deserved derision...

4) Veronica Belling: "tsitsilist" is a disparagement of a "Socialist" (non-believer, 
apikoyris) with a sideswipe at Litvakes whose displacement of "s" (samekh) for "ts" 
(tsadi) was a source of great amusement for the pious -- khsidim, especially.

Subject: poyer

Tayere mendelyaner,

In bezug auf die Frage van Jules Levin m=F6chte ich verweisen auf Schmellers 
Bayrisches W=F6rterbuch' (Jubileumsausgabe, Muenchen 2002,  Bd. 1, 187. und 257) 
und Wolfgang Pfeifers Etymologisches W=F6rterbuch,  Berlin 1989, A-G, S.134. Sie 
beziehen das Wort 'Bauer' auf das ahd. gib=FBro &gt; mhd. geb=FBr (cohibitator 
...rusticus). Als Bedeutungen: Familien- Stammesgenosse, Dorfgenosse. Mhd. 
Geb=FBr(e)/ b=FBr =(Miteinwohner, Nachbar, Bauer, roher Mensch. Vgl. im 
Holl=E4ndischen: nabuurschap, buur, boer.  Schmeller signalisiert den Gebrauch von 
'gpaur' auszusprechen als 'paur' ge/gi in der Bedeutung von co/zusammen. Im Bayrischen 
sieht man oft die Erscheinung von b&gt;p im Anlaut;  und  mhd =FB &gt; 'au' // im 
Jiddischen als oi &gt;&gt; vgl.: h=FBs &gt; haus/hois

Mit a sheynem grus,

Jan Jonk de Koning,

Subject: poyer

poyer (meaning peasant or boor) is the same as the German word Bauer, meaning the 
same thing.

The German B becomes P in some Yiddish words, such as Butter becoming Putter, and 
the "oy" vowel in Yiddish is often the "au" vowel in German:
oykh/auch; hoyz/Haus, etc

Leyzer Gillig

Subject: poyer

Poyer is the same word as standard German Bauer and English boor. The devoicing of b, 
d, and g in some words is an old feature of Yiddish and it is also shared with the vast 
majority of High German dialects--though why some words have it and others not has not
really been explained properly.

Subject: Niborski/Vaisbrot dictionary

I am attempting to but a copy of the famed Niborski/Vaisbrot dictionary, which seems to 
have been out of print for the entire decade since its first publication. Does anyone have 
any suggestions as to where one can buy a copy or what prices are being asked? Checking 
with the online antiquarian sellers, I find only one copy available, (condition undisclosed) 
for $55 and another 25 in shipping. Is this the best one can do.

Any advice would be welcomed.

Subject: song sought
Date: June 13

I'm looking for a song that a senior I work with sings.  She gave me some fragments:

Mit dayne klige oygn
Host di mikh tsigetzoygn...

.... tsuris host di mikh gebrakht
Kh'hob moyre, kh'hob moyre
Far vemen hostu moyre...

...bay nakht.

Does anyone recognize these lyrics?

thanks,
Jane Enkin
