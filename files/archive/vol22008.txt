Subject: frand

My untutored guess would be that the writer meant "fraynd", i.e. friend.
Probably, not having mastered Yiddish, the writer used "frande" to address a woman 
under the impression that this was the feminine form for fraynd and therefore an 
appropriate way to address his female correspondent.

Dina LŽvias 

[Moderator's note: Similar responses were received from Barry Goldstein, Lena Watson, 
and Stephen Berr, who adds, "I would, however, have written "fraynt" not "frande."  The 
structure of the greeting and closing is quite standard."]

Subject: frand

I'm sure I won't be alone -- or even the first -- to assure Martin Jacobs that the salutation 
and signature lines of the letter he's dealing with refer to "friend" Madam Berman and 
"friend" Bibi. It's also possible that difficult penmanship may be obscuring "frayndine," 
the feminine form.

Hershl Hartman

[Moderator's note: a similar response was received from Zulema Seligsohn.]

Subject: frand

"Ayer frande Bibi"...It would appear to me from the context that the person was merely 
misspelling "fraynd," friend. The "ay" diphthong when pronounced by tsentral-yidish 
reders indeed often sounds more like "a."  The "e" at the end - fraynde as opposed to 
fraynd -  might be a daytshmerizm or a kosher dialectical variant, since Bibi is apparently 
a single individual.

Leyzer Gillig

[Moderator's note: similar responses were received from Maurice Wolfthal and Tom 
Wisniewski.]

Subject: Yoshke Pandre

Pandre or Pandera was, according to Jewish sources, the last name of 
Joseph, the father of Jesus--or in some sources, the name of a Roman 
soldier who was supposedly the father of Jesus.

Subject: Findjan

Dear Mendelyaners,

We just released a new page in the website "yidlid" at the address:
http://rama01.free.fr/yidlid/chansons/findjan.htm

but I have a couple questions unanswered still and I thought somebody here
might know about this song's history.

The questions are:
Who is the author of the Yiddish version of this song?
and
Is the Yiddish version anterior or posterior to the Hebrew one?

Zayt gezunt!

Subject: Tfise-lid (Vet shoyn do undzer keyver zayn)

Hello friends,

Does anybody have a tune for this song?

First verse:
Vet shoyn do undzer keyver zayn
Zenen mir shoyn do farloyrn
Zen veln mir nisht mer di likhtike shayn
Farsholtn zenen mir fun geboyrn

refreyn:
Farlirt keyn mut nisht bruder
Der goyrl undzer iz shoyn aza
Shaynen vet di zun far undz nokh vider
Dinen zol undz di fray...

Second verse:
Dort gelozn froy un kind
Bay "nash brat" iz dos tayer...
Do muz men zin flogn erger vi hint
Brenen zol es vi a fayer...

Subject:  Translation help

Dear Mendele List,

I need some help please with a Yiddish poem I am translating. I have two questions: one 
concerning the eighth line and a more general translation question. The poem is "Viglid" 
by Eliezer Shindler. Here are the first eight lines, so you can see the context. I've 
italicized the parts I have questions on: 

Shlof mayn kind un hob hanoes, Iber dir di himlen bloe: Zilber-volkn sheyn geshlifn, 
Shvimen shtolts vi vunder-shifn. Firn oystres gold fun ufir Un meshiekh's geule-shoyfer. 
Tsederbeymer fun levonen, Mastn far di (khores? kheyres? khet-resh-vuv-sof) -fonen. 
(combination word khores/kheyres-=
fonen).

Here is my iberzetsung thus far (very rough, not the final copy): Sleep, my child, and be 
happy Above you are the blue skies Beautiful silver clouds so polished Swimming 
proudly like wonder-ships. They carry golden treasures from Ophir And the meshiekhs 
geule-shoyfer. Cedar wood from Lebanon, [Masts of (?) for (?) the kh
ores/kheyres-flags.] 

My questions are, please: I am having a hard time with the last line shown. I think he 
means masts as in masts of ships, but I am not sure. I know cedar was used for that 
purpose. The word khey-resh-vuv-sof I could not find in any of my Yiddish or Yiddish-
Hebrew dictionaries, but I saw in an online Hebrew dictionary that it can mean 
"independence" or also "engraved, embroidered." I have no idea what the author is 
saying. If you have some ideas, and/or can speak to the imagery he is using so 
beautifully, that would be really helpful to me.

The author uses the term "hob hanoes" and also "shlof mayn kind mit groys hanoes."
I know that phrase as "enjoy, etc." I am having a hard time to translate it into something 
in English suitable in a lullaby. To me, you would want to say something soothing: a 
version of "Good night, sleep tight." You would want them to be peaceful and think 
happy thoughts as they drift off to sleep, the blue skies and silver clouds above them. Can 
anybody please tell me about different ways to use the phrase "hanoes hobn" that would 
fit here, perhaps slightly different meanings from the more standard ones? I can send you 
a .jpg of the entire poem in the original Yiddish if you like. I welcome all comments and 
thoughts, positive or negative. I am just learning how to do this, so any and all ideas are 
very much appreciated. Please feel free to reply through the list or email me at 
murphy.ruth@rocketmail.com. 

A gute vokh aykh,
Ruth Murphy
