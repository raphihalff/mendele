Subject: Dovid Hofshteyn's "Friling"

Russell Block (February 16) asks about a line in Dovid Hofshteyn's poem
"Friling":

alts gringer varft der kop zikh inderheykh
un shnur  farbrokhenem di busheles tsu tseyln . . .

Could this be about throwing back one's head to count the storks flying
high in the sky storks that are flying, as geese do, in the shape of V's
or broken  necklaces?  Storks returning to the area now that it is spring.

Subject: Dovid Hofshteyn's "Friling"

A straight up translation of the last lines in David Hofshteyn's poem
"Friling":

*alts gringer varft der kop zikh inderheykh
un shnur farbrokhenem di busheles tsu tseyln . . .*

may be read read:

Ever easier throwing your head up above and [leaving] the broken down
daughter-in-law to count the bushels.


*Shnur* daughter-in-law

*Shnur* also meaning rope, might layer the meaning of the rope around the
bushel broken opened but not dealt with in counting and sorting.

Not having the Yiddish or the whole poem, and the context will help a lot
here, perhaps it is *shnur farbokhnem*, hunched over daughter-in-law.


So the lines are saying how easy it is to escape dealing with the mundane
by floating into  lofty thought and leaving the overworked woman to deal
with the task at hand.

Subject: Dovid Hofshteyn's "Friling"

Russell Block asks for the meaning of the last two lines of Dovid
Hofshteyn's poem, "Friling," part of his 1912 (first published 1919)
series of poems describing the changing seasons in the rural area in which
he grew up, the most famous of which is In vinter farnakhtn--In Wintry
Evenings.

The lines in "Friling" may be translated as follows: "It's ever-easier to
throw one's head back/to count the storks in their broken strings (of
flight)."

Subject: songs sought

Hello friends,

Sheva Zucker suggested that I subscribe to Mendele for the best help on
the planet in  matters Yiddish.

I'm working with my friend Beth Holmgren, chair of the Slavic Languages
Department at  Duke University, on her book (and companion cd) project
investigating Polish and Yiddish cabaret (kleynkunst, revi-teater) music
in Warsaw between the wars. Here is my first question:

I read in the Issachar Fatar book on Polish musicians that Zigmund
Byalostotski had a great hit called "M'ken nisht tsvingen tsu keyn libe"
and that Polish lyrics were
subsequently written for it:  "Nie mozna kogos zmusic do milosci," (by
Zenon
Friedwald). Bret Werb thinks no Yiddish text has survived. Has anyone
heard of this
"great hit" ?? Any pointers?

And here is my second unanswered question on cabaret/kleynkunst music in
Warsaw
between the wars:

Bret Werb at the Holocaust Museum intimates that a Yiddish text for the
song "Oy, Madagaskar" finally showed up." I believe that Rebecca Joy
Fletcher must have found a copy because she included an English-language
version of it in her Kleynkunst show. Does anybody have sheet music or a
recording or the Yiddish words to this song? Orother pointers?

I'm also looking for the nightclub Azazel's theme song...

Miroslawa Bulat wrote for YIVO
(http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Kleynkunst):
"Particularly celebrated was a number called the 'Azazel-Shimmy,' by
Broderzon and Kon."

... and Bob Rothstein himself wrote
(http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/printarticle.aspx?id=3D2195): "
Azazel's theme song, the "Azazel-Shimmy" (words by Moyshe Broderzon
[1890-1956], music by Henekh Kon [1898-1972]), was said to be so popular
that people were whistling it on the streets of Warsaw. "

Is it utterly gone? Any ideas?

Best,
Jane Peppler

Subject: origins of Yiddish

I read a little of a few things by Dr. Paul Wexler, who is or was a
professor at Tel Aviv University.  One article was over 100 pages and
called Yiddish: the 15th Slavic Language.  He also wrote a thick book
about how Yiddish started.  His proposal is: Some Jews spoke a Slavic
language, maybe old Sorbian, maybe in Bavaria.  The local non-Jews spoke a
Slavic language.  Then speakers of a Germanic language migrated to the
area.  The Jews retained their sentence structure, word order and/or
underlying grammar, but mainly just most of their Slavie word forms were
replaced with Germanic word forms, but the original Slavic meanings were
retained.  But the Jewish religion made certain Germanic words
unacceptable, so for these words, the original Slavic word was retained,
or the original Slavic word was replaced with a word from old Hebrew.  A
second relexification might have happened somewhere farther east or
North-East, among other Jews around Ukraine or maybe Poland or Lithuania
or Russia.  My B.A. degree was in Linguistics and Dr. Wexler's proposals
about relexification in Yiddish and other communities makes intuitive
sense to me.

Michael E. Kovnat

[Untershames Bers recommends reading through the many items in the Mendele
archives pertinent to Wexler's hypothesis. They can be found by going to
http://mendele.commons.yale.edu/wp/, and writing "Wexler" in the search
box.]

Subject: translating Yiddish terms not in dictionaries

Sometimes, a Yiddish word is spelled in a manner which suggests a
pronunciation different from the standard in the Weinreich or Harkavy
dicitonaries.After you know enough Yiddish you will start to recognize
certain words as "different variations" of the standard words.  Some words
are actually a stem + diminutive, or a prefix + stem; for these words try
to figure out which part might be the affix and which is the stem, look up
each part separately, and then, try to mentally combine the meanings in a
very literal manner, or a non-literal manner, as you wish based on your
opinion of what makes the most sense.  If you can't think of a nice single
word English translation for a Yiddish word, just describe what you think
it means and translate the one Yiddish word as a few English words or an
English phrase or whole sentence.  Alternatively, just put the Yiddish
word in the main text with a footnote or glossary explaining the word, but
don't do this too frequently.  At least this is how I translate.

Michael E. Kovnat
