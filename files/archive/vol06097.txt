Subject: Ver du bist

dear friends,

here are interesting words (I read last time) which I could refer to
situation between man and woman at all. I am curious do you also
think the same about sentence below?

       Ver du bist - dos veys ikh,
           nor ver ikh bin - dos veystu nisht...

       I know who you are,
           but who I am - you don't know...

           (from Aaron Zeitlin's drama)

Subject: The song "Arayn un Aroys"

[In answer to Doodie Ringelblum's query (Vol. 6.096:]

I believe Dave Cash is the one who did the hilarious Yiddish version of
the Toreador aria from Carmen. I think he lived in the US tho the only
place I've ever found his records was in Paris. And in fact OSI is a
French company -- an old record (not Cash) I have from there lists the
address as 26, rue des Rosiers [Nu? Vos den? ;) ], Paris IVe. Good luck.
And thanks for the movie rec -- hope it plays here someday.

Subject: Viazoy shraybt men "khanuke"?

M. Schonhaut and B. Hirshan write:

>1. If YIVO distributed a khanuke card, how would it be spelled?
>2. Would the spelling be the same for an all English word card (I wish
>you a happy khanuke {Webster has it Chanukah, also Hanukkah}) and for a
>Yiddish transliterated card (Ikh vintsh aykh a freylekhn...).
>3. Other than the sound equivalents listed on p xxi in Weinreich, where
>do I find the YIVO rules for transliteration?

If you're talking about a Yiddish transliteration, then the YIVO
transcription would be _khanuke_. If you're talking about writing in
English, then I would think you'd use any conventional _English_
spelling, e.g. the two you found in your English dictionary, since it is
now an English word. In any event, Yiddish and the YIVO conventions for
transliterating Yiddish are really irrelevant -- the word is, after all,
from _Hebrew_. (Presumably, even the old anti-Zionist Bundistn could
have lived with that... ;) )

Re the YIVO rules, I think someone wrote them up once for Mendele and
they're archived somewhere. [Shames, do you remember where?] But, as I
recall, the listing in Weinreich is complete, no?

[The YIVO rules (adapted for us by Shleyme Axelrod and Zellig Bach) are
indeed available from from Mendele.  A note to the shames
(nmiller@mail.trincoll.edu) will get you the file.  Also available via
anonymous ftp (see any number of Mendele ending in "1" or "6" for
further details. nm]

Subject: Vi zogt men Yidish in Velsh?

Two more suggestions for the Mercator Project's Welsh-Yiddish conundrum
(6.095).

I showed Alan King's inquiry to a linguist acquaintance.  "Locate a
London neighborhood where Welsh and Yiddish speakers live in close
proximity, go there and ask the Welsh what they call the Jews'
language," my friend said. He was surprised they hadn't done that, and
wondered whether it was because some "purist agenda" would prevent the
Project from "accepting the data" that would so generate.  Wouldn't
there be other cities in England -- as well as Wales, of course, as
Ellen Prince suggests (6.096) -- that might provide further data as
well?  The question is, of course, not what Jews call the Yiddish they
speak in Wales, but what Welsh call the Yiddish spoken by Jews
everywhere.

A second important resource ought to be the people at and around Gwasg y
Tair Chwaer, or Three Sisters Press, Cae Fadog Farm, Rowen, County
Gwynedd, Wales LL32 8YP, UK.  They are the publishers of Heershadovid
Menkes, pseudonym of Dovid Katz, of the Oxford Yiddish program.  Katz'
_Der flakher shpits: maysyes fun vilner gubernie_ (Three Sisters Press,
1993) includes -- voila! -- a Welsh title page, _Y Copa Gwastad: a
storiau Idish araill o Dalaith Filna_.  That looks to me like a Welsh
Yiddish publisher's translation of the word "Yiddish." In any event, I
don't doubt that those associated with Three Sisters would have opinions
to offer.

Combining these two suggestions, what about interviewing Welsh residents
or tradespeople near Cae Fadog Farm in County Gwynedd?  If anyone has to
deal with these Yiddish publishers, they must exchange views amongst
themselves about the enterprise going on there.  What vocabulary do they
use to discuss that?  I don't know if Three Sisters is still operating,
but they certainly were in the very recent past.

Subject: Kaalekh and mikvues

In Reb Yudl-Leyb Prager's translation of "KhaveLaye, gitshabes," [vol.
6.093], he translates "kalekh" as "lime." I was rather surprised by this
translation, as I know kaalekh as a food, and it appears in the song between
khale and tsholent.  Kaalekh, as my Minkatsher Babe makes it, is made from
chopped up baylik (chicken breast), made into balls in such a way as to
resemble g'fiilte fish (and with a broth which looks very much like
fish-yowkh), but which tastes very different.  I assume that Reb Yudel-Leyb
was translating with some sort of dictionary--I know Vaynrakh translates
kalekh as lime, and doesn't mention the food--but, given the context, I
think the food is clearly meant.

(My mother has just suggested that the food was named kaalekh because it
looks like chalk, but I find that a bit farfetched, particularly since the
kaalekh I'm used to has carrots in it, and is not even close to being
white.)

Also, regarding mikvues, although sitting and talking in the mikve is
frowned upon, it is a very common practice.  This is especially true in the
khsidishe community, where all men go to the mikve every Friday afternoon,
which provides a regular social setting of sorts.  The stereotypical
mikve-reyd is the tall tale, and I have often heard "mikve-reyd" used to
dismiss something as preposterous, but actual shmuesn in mikvues range all
over the place--social matters, politics, business, and philosophy, both
serious and otherwise, always with a rather casual tone, and usually
peppered with jokes.  ("mikve-reyd" is also used to refer to vulgar language
and/or impolite subjects, which are sometimes the subject matter of the
least aydele of mikve-goers.)

All the above is specifically about a men's mikve.  Women's mikve-going is
supposed to be absolutely private, hush-hush, no one's supposed to know as a
matter of tsni'es; I'd venture to say that in order to put a line in a song
about a woman going to mikve, one would have to be substantially removed
from the community where women do so.  Moreover, women's mikve-going is
dictated not by Shabbes, but by hilkhes niide.

As for non-khsiidim in Nadverne gonig to the mikve every Friday, Nadverne
was a major source of Hungarian khsiides, and anyone in interland who wasn't
khsiidish themselves was at least influenced by khsiides, so it's not much
of a raye as to the practices of non-khsiidim.
