Subject: Re: Yiddish Noun Phrase Constituent Order

I am doing a typological study on Noun Phrase (NP)
constituent order-- the order of articles, adjectives,
adverbs (like "very"), numerals and possessive
adjectives with respect to the noun.

If you are a native Yiddish speaker, I'd very much
appreciate it if you could give me your Yiddish
translation of the following phrases:

1.  my seven very big very beautiful balloons

2.  these seven very big beautiful (not very beautiful)
balloons

3.  these seven (not very) big very beautiful balloons

4.  a very beautiful balloon

5.  a very big (not very) beautiful balloon

6.  a (not very) big very beautiful balloon

If there is more than one way to translate and you
adjudge one way more "common" or "natural" than the
other, please give me both and identify the more
common/natural version.

If the results are interesting in comparison with the
other languages examined, I will be happy to report
them back to Mendele.  I have a suspicision, fun mayn
onheybers yidish, az iz do an interesante farglaykh mit
Turkish, speaking of 'lehavdil!'

Thanks for your help.

Subject: Joseph Opatoshu

In the "New Member" welcome I was asked to actively
participate, so here goes. I would like to admit that I
am not a fluent Yiddish speaker, my Polish is all right
and my Dutch is even better. Still I have a reason to
join this list which is my interest in Jewish culture
in Poland. I have a question and I think this place is
the right place to ask that question.

In his book "The Jews in Polish culture" Aleksander
Herz mentioned a story of the Jewish writer Joseph
Opatoshu. It was one of the last stories Opatoshu wrote
before his death in 1954. Aleksander Herz (1988, p. 5)
summarises the contents as follows:

   In a formerly Jewish town in Poland, there are no
   longer any Jews. All that remained is a dim memory
   of the strange people who once lived there. Of the
   town's present inhabitants only one, grey-haired old
   man, saw those Jews as a child and still remembers
   something of them. The young people of the town,
   having by chance heard of its former inhabitants,
   try to find out from the old man who those people
   were, what happened to them, why they perished. Thus
   begins the legend of those who had ceased even to be
   ghosts, and the legend seems to bring them to life
   again.

I would like to know the title of this story and the
book (or anthology) in which this story was published.
And I (of course, you think) is there any translation
(in English, German, French, Dutch, Polish) available.

Thanks for any information,

Rosa Lehmann, Amsterdam.

Subject: Introduction & Comments

     I have been quite interested in reading the last
couple of months of Mendele and would like to introduce
myself.  Please excuse the English, but the
transliteration tsebrekht di finger.

     My name is Arnold Kuzmack (my wife, Linda's, name
is on the Internet account, so her name will
automatically appear on messages).  As a child, I
studied Yiddish at Arbeter Ring schools in New York for
four years, then four years of mitlshul.  My
grandparents spoke Yiddish among themselves and with
their friends and also took me to various meetings and
functions that were conducted in Yiddish.

     As an avocation, I did a fair amount of reading in
Yiddish linguistics in college but have not kept up
with it.  I am now active in Yiddish activities in the
Washington, DC area and edit the Yiddish section of the
newsletter of Yiddish of Greater Washington.

     My day job is as a specialist in water pollution
     at EPA.

     I'd like to comment on some of the subjects
discussed recently:

Du and ir
=========

     We were taught that ir is used as the plural and
the polite form.  Apparently, who one uses the polite
form with varied in different social circles.  We used
it with parents and other relatives as well as adult
family friends.

     In other languages/societies with similar forms,
using the wrong form was a faux pas of considerable
magnitude.  Using it with a woman married to someone
else could get you into a duel. (Avade nisht bay undz!)
I believe the great Russian poets wrote love poems
using the polite form, and when the woman allowed a
suitor to use the familiar form, it meant acceptance.
Years ago, I read that a then newly-independent
French-speaking country passed a law forbidding
Europeans from saying "tu" to Africans without
permission.

     Re dutsn and duken, I checked Harkavy's 1898
"Jewish-English English-Jewish Dictionary", and it also
had only dutsn.  Could duken be by analogy with Russian
(and I presume other slavic) tykat'?  BTW, Russian also
has the much more expressive byt' na ty s...

Subject: tender turban

1. Regarding "tsart", there is a regular German word
"zart" which, according to my dictionary, means
"tender", "soft" (color), or "delicate" (health). While
this word is written with an "a" (pasekh), its
derivates (zaertlich, zaertlichkeit) all have an
"umlaut".

2. Dr. Herzog surprised me once again (no, not with
lehavdil) with the Turkish origins of the "yarmulke". I
had been told that the word comes from the Polish
"yarmuk" (cap) with the regular Yiddish diminiutive
"--li" (does this make it "smallcap"?)
