Subject: short autobiographical note 

Hello everyone,

I am a Ph.D. graduate student at the Autonomous University of Barcelona,
while performing my research in the neuroscience field. Although the area
itself as well the thesis topic are extremely attractive, a reason to
swallow up a great part of my time, I have directed my attention to the
yiddish culture. And since your discussion group is concerned with the
literature and language aspects, it seems to me the appropriate place to get
in contact with. Some exciting subjects as to distinguish in which terms the
confluence among the other lending cultures, e.g., hebrew, germanic, slavic
or romanic ones had given birth to what at a certain moment of time was the
non-unitary, but flourishing yiddish life, are worth to be mentioned here.
Though it is far from being extinguished, methinks a certain marginalisation
(and academicising) peril may heavily endanger the ongoing of the yiddish
spirituality.

Another reason I have joined the group is that I am still confident that by
means of such news/discussion exchanges one can keep alive at least dos
mame-loschn.

Faithfully yours,

Octavian Mocanu

Subject: New at Mendele

Mazel tov,

my name is Harald Krause - I want to introduce myself.  My profession is to
programme software and internet sites.  But before I've studied in Tuebingen
and in Prague theology and judaistics. In Tuebingen I had a very good and
fascinating language course in yiddish. 

Now I want to learn more about yiddish literature and culture - and want to
communicate with other yiddish-enthusiastic people.

Subject: English translations in Mendele

I'd like to echo Lori Cahan-Simon's gratitude (09.023) to those who supply
an English translation along with their Yiddish writings. You are of immense
help to those of us who are at the level of perpetual struggle. I realize
the time and effort it takes to perform this service. I am not requesting
more of you to do the same, nor set any kind of expectation. Simply thanks
so much to those "translators" out there. 

nokh a hartzikn dank,
Fred Sherman

Subject: Yiddish

Many years ago as a child I went to a chedder where yiddish reading and
writing was taught.  While I can still converse in Yiddish have lost my
knowledge of r&w Yiddish.  Where can I obtain Yiddish primers or take
courses to refresh the language. I need it for my genealogy searches as well
general purposes? I live in the Montreal area.

Subject: Yiddish in Prague

I know very little about Yiddish, but can understand some of it through
German, and am more and more interested in it.  I have two questions:  what
does mishpokhe (if that's spelt right) mean?  I'm living in Prague, does
anyone know of any Yiddish publications/ anywhere here where I can get more
information on Yiddish? Thank you!

Subject: Maylos contact information

I am responding to Sylvia Schildt's request for the posting of contact
information for Maylos.

The address of the Hasidic Idish monthly Maylos is: 18 Suzanne Drive,
Monsey, New York 10952. Telephone 914.425.3780.  Subscriptions: $48 a year
post paid. I have no other association with this journal other than being an
avid reader. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in living, Hasidic
Idish. The average issue runs about 50 pages including ads (which are also
quite interesting for me).

Subject: Summer Yiddish Scholars

On behalf of Yiddish of Greater Washington, I would like to inform
Mendelyaners about the summer scholarship program we have begun in
Washington, D.C., and to congratulate the recipients of this year's
scholarships.  The scholarships, in the amount of $1,000 each, were offered
by Yiddish of Greater Washington on a competitive basis to any student who
had taken a college-level Yiddish course in a college or university in
Washington, D.C., and the surrounding area during the 1998-1999 school year
and who wanted to continue Yiddish studies over the summer.  The purpose of
the summer scholarship program was to encourage local students, especially
those who had just begun studying Yiddish, to take advantage of the many
opportunities to deepen and enrich their Yiddish studies over the summer. 
The recipients of the scholarships were Ethan Kraus and Lisa Singer, both of
the University of Maryland.  Mr. Kraus used the scholarship to attend the
Oxford Summer program in Yiddish, and Ms. Singer used it to pursue an
independent study program in Yiddish, supervised by Prof. Miriam Isaacs of
the University of Maryland.

Subject: Pinkhes Minc (Aleksander) of Lodz

I have translated the Yiddish memoir, _Lodzh in mayn zikorn_ (Buenos Aires,
1958), by Pinkhes Minc (Aleksander; 1895-1962). Can anyone help me in
locating any heirs? 

Minc (Mints) was from a Gerer family in Lodz (related to the manufacturer
Jakub Wojdyslawski) and was a clerk with the Jewish community board there
during the years before World War I. Minc eventually became a Bundist, a
founder of the Kombund, a Communist who rejected Stalinism in the early
1930s, and returned to the Bund. A political prisoner in Poland, he
emigrated to Paris where he edited and wrote for Bundist Yiddish newspapers
before, during and after the German occupation. In the early 1950s, he
emigrated to Buenos Aires to continue his career as a Bundist journalist and
editor. Minc died in March 1962, as he prepared to emigrate to Israel, where
his only son was a kibbutznik. I have heard that the son died without
immediate heirs in the 1970s. 

Anyone with suggestions or information is requested to contact me directly
at rmshapiro@juno.com. Thanks in advance.

Subject: Der rikhtiker zakh

I am midway through a project of collecting usable recordings of Yiddish
songs that were sung by our own mothers and aunts, etc. I will include them
in a CD that is scheduled for release next Spring. Some of my friends were
fortunate enough (as I was) to have recorded our mothers, mostly acappella,
though in some cases with piano or guitar accompaniment, singing songs that
are charming or that tug at your heartstrings, or both. If your mother or
aunt, etc., left behind a reasonably clear recording on any recording
medium, please consider sending it to me for evaluation. If I can't use it,
I will return it promptly with thanks. If I can, I will submit a brief
contract outlining royalty terms and further details about the project.
Write my e-mail address if your might be interested and I'll reply with my
mailing address. I want this to be an authentic and inspiring album of
Yiddish songs, not one done by professional opportunists, that will be
rendered by the people who were near and dear to us.
