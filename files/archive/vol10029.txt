Subject: Yosl Mlotek

A por persenlekhe verter vegn Yoslen......Haynt zaynen mir geven tzuzamen
mit mishpokhe un fraynt bai der levayeh fun Yosl Mlotek.  Farshteyt zikh az
der zal iz geven ful.  Di vos hobn geret, hobn dertzeylt vegn Yosl's arbet ,
nokh vi a yunger man, in der Yiddishe kulturele un arbets bavegn in Bund, in
Varshe.  Un shpeter, zayn arbet fun a gantz lebn, do in Amerike, in di
Yiddishe shuln, in Arbeter Ring, in Forverts.  Kaseyder, hot men dermont as
Yosl is geven DER adres fun der Yiddisher velt.

A few personal words about Yosl Mlotek.....Today , together with family and
friends, we were at the funeral of Yosl Mlotek.  Of course, the hall was
filled to capacity.  Those who spoke, described Yosl's work, while still as
a young man, in the Yiddish cultural world and in the Jewish socialist Bund
movement in Warsaw.  And later, his lifelong work, here in America, in the
Yiddish secular schools, in the Workmen's Circle, in the Forward.  Again,
and again, mention was made that "Yosl was THE address of  the Yiddish
world." Now that Yosl is gone, it is up to each of us, in our own ways, to
see to it that the Yiddish world that he was certain would have a viable
place here in America, continues to thrive.  And very personal words were
spoken by Yosl's two sons, his sister, and three of his grandchildren.

Others can better remark about the great significance of Yosl's work in the
Jewish world, and in the Yiddish world, in particular.  My recollections are
mostly personal ones.  The lives of the Mlotek and Patt families have been
intertwined for virtually all our lives.  My parents, Monye and Brokhe Patt,
were close friends with Yosl yet in Warsaw, in the youth movements of the
Bund.  And those ties continued here in the Bronx, NY for all these years.
My brother, Avram, and I grew up with the Mlotek kids, Zalmen and Moishe,
along with the children of the few members of our families that survived the
Holocaust, and a wonderful circle of close friends who were, and are, in
every sense of the word, true meshpokhe.  We have watched as the paths of
our various lives have spun off in so many different directions, while the
core of our beings remained close to each other in mind and in spirit, and
devoted to each other, and to our special Yiddish world. Yesterday, when I
spent some time with Khane in her apartment, we looked through some old
photo albums of Yosl's early years in America.  There they were:  the Patts,
the Mloteks,  and others, and.....me.....a kid of about 8 years old, the
first-born, within this group of friends, of the next generation, born an
American citizen.  And, oh boy ! When Yosl met and married this beautiful
American girl, Khane.  WOW!  May father called her "di Varshever meydl fun
der Bronx."  And while I was there, the phone never stopped ringing.  There
were calls and e-mails from all over the world and from many parts of the
U.S.

This afternoon, after the funeral, again at Khane and Yosl's home, we
reminisced and remembered.  Everyone had a maysele to tell, an anecdote to
repeat, about some time or event, whether large or small, that was
intimately connected with Yosl.  Many of us recalled the large Peysakh
sedorim in my parents'  home, which always ended with everyone sitting back
to enjoy singing together, led, of course, by Yosl and Khane.  I recalled my
years travelling from the Bronx to lower Manhatan to attend the Arbeter Ring
Mittl Shul----which I didn't love (sorry, folks), and where I paid scant
attention to the instruction and read movie magazines under the table during
class. But when Yosl was my teacher, this close family friend, a member of
the family, I really did try to pay more attention.  After all, es past
nisht... how would it look...it could be embarrassing...We talked about our
great times in Camp Boiberik, or Kinder Ring, or Hemshekh (depending on your
age), and compared notes about our experiences in various arbeter ring
shuln.  And I recalled my five years as Organization Director of the
Workmen's Circle when I had the opportunity to work as a professional Jewish
communal worker side by side with Yosl Mlotek.  We talked about our own
children, the next generations, and the different ways that many of them are
finding for themselves to be connected to Yiddish and to Yiddishkayt.

I started out above by saying that I had a few personal words to share about
Yosl.  The few turned into many.  Each of us who had the pleasure of knowing
Yosl could fill manuscripts of anecdotal stories about our connections with
him, and more importantly, his connection with us.  How special to have
known and been a part of the life of a person who has had such a tremendous
impact, both personal and professional, on so many lives. His life and his
work continue to be an inspiration to others, and his caring ways and
smiling eyes remain ingrained in our memories.

Koved zayn ondenk.

Subject: Glikl Hamlin

Glikl Hamlin was published in  the series:  Musterverk fun der yiddisher
literature by the Yivo Literatur gezelshaft  in Argentino.   Glikl Hamlin -
zichroines was Vol. 27 of the musterverk and was published in 1971. The
National Yiddish Book Center   in Amherst may have a copy by now, (unless it
was sold off already. I am fom Cape Town S.Africa, and in January of this
year  we sent off a substantial  and comprehensive collection  of over  2000
Yiddish books sasvaged by our local Yiddish Book Rescue Project. I was the
convener of that project and I remember seeing that book there. In fact we
had most of  the books in that Musterverk series and all were sent to NYBC.

I hope this info will be of help in tracking down the book.  There is
available an English translation published a few years ago.

Subject: zay mir nit keyn feter

It stands to reason, because of the tenuous logical connection between
grandmothers and wheels, that the saying "Ven/az di bobe volt gehat reder
volt zi geven an omnibus/a tramvay" arose as a sanitized take-off on the
grandmother/grandfather version, discussed numerous times over the years on
Mendele.

As for the well-known saying "(Tu mir nit keyn toyve:)  zay mir nit keyn
feter un koyf mir nit keyn shikh!", perhaps it originated as the
sanitized version of "Tu mir nisht keyn toyve:  zay mir nit keyn shvoger un
tren nisht mayn shvester!" (which I learned from a Transylvanian source
whose identity I won't disclose, in order to protect my grandfather's
dignity).

Subject: kirtsungen un roshe-teyvesn, revisited

My article includes Yiddish (i.e. not "Whole/Merged Hebrew") abbreviations
exclusively.  An abbreviation such as _geb'_ or _gesht'_ ('geboyrn,
geshtorbn'), which may be found on Yiddish matseyves, will be found as part
of my list, while, for example, p"n (poy nitmen/nigber 'here lies buried')
won't.

Hebrew rashe-tevot are listed in Dov Ashkenazi & ??, _Otsar Rashe Tevot_ - a
standard Judaica reference work. (Sorry, I've forgotten the second
compiler's name.)

Subject: purimshpil

Moyshe-Shaye Steinlauf writes (10.028):

     Sotn: Di tkufe falt dray teg in rosh-hoydesh tamuz. Demolt iz groyse
     hitsn un groyse blitsn un groyse glitshn. Es zenen aroysgegangen tsvey
     yunge meydlekh, eyns fun zibetsik yor, un eyns fun akhtsik yor, un
     gefaln un zikh tsebrokhn a beyn in marz [sic].

     Tkufe in the passage in question probably refers to menses. Is that it?
     Or is there more?


I do not think so. tkufe in Hebrew/yiddish refers to the solstice/equinox.

The summer solstice is called tkufes tamuz.

The incidence of the tkufe is traditionally associated with potential
hazards. For example water in a vessel at the time of the tkufe is
considered to be dangerous to drink, unless a piece of metal was in the
water at the time.

Furthermore, the month of tamuz is associated with an evil spirit called
ketev mriri which preys on those who wander out alone during the middle of
the day.

These would fit in with the quoted passage, bearing in mind the nonsense
element of the purimshpil.

Subject: beyndl

With regard to Martin Green's note (10.027) on the use of bones for "medical"
purposes, it is noteworthy that Falik Zolf, who was a Kamieniec Litewski
native, was probably influenced from the well known memoir of Yechezkel
Kotik (Mayne zichroynes, Warsaw 1913), also from the same town (Max
Weinreich defined Zolf's book as "a continuation of Kotik's memoir" (see:
Oyf fremder erd, p. 6).

In his memoir (vol. I, chap. XV) Kotik tells the following:

     There were two people in our township who knew incantations against the
     "evil eye." One of them was David the carterer who delivered the flour
     from the mills to the shops. He used to neutralize the "evil eye" by
     means of the small bones of a human skeleton. To this day it has
     remained a mystery to me how he came by those small bones. If anyone's
     face swelled, in other words his cheeks swelled up due to an infected
     tooth, as it is called, or suffered from a sore throat, he would go to
     David the carterer. He would take hold of those small bones and circle
     the swelling with them, all the while whispering incantations to
     himself. And the patient was convinced that, if not at once, then the
     next day or the following week or so, the swelling would disappear.
     There was no doubt in the minds of the town's inhabitants that the
     swelling was caused by the "evil eye."

     The other person who knew how to neutralize the "evil eye" was Golda,
     the preacher's wife. The preacher was an outstanding Torah scholar,
     with great knowledge of the Talmud, and of his wife, it was said that
     she too knew how to learn Gemarrah. She would cancel out the "evil eye"
     by means of two eggs,  one in each hand, with which she would circle
     the swelling or the sore throat and also whisper incantations to
     herself.

     This "medicine" was cheap -  ten groshen; six - for the poor. I
     remember my own face swelling up several times, obviously from
     toothaches. I was then taken to David the carterer who was considered
     more effective. I remember that he scratched me with those small bones.
     They were rough and sharp and I nearly fainted from the pain. He would
     run quickly, round and round, the small bones placed over the face of
     the patient. I pleaded to be taken to the preacher's wife: she did the
     same thing  - but with eggs  - and the procedure was so simple and
     easy, a virtual "pleasure." But no one listened to me. "Foolish child,"
     they said, "though he might hurt you a little, you'll get rid of the
     swelling much faster. The method used by the preacher's wife takes much
     longer to heal."

     Sometimes I was "lucky." David the carterer would be away from home
     carting flour from the mills or to Brisk, and I'd be taken to the
     preacher's wife, instead. I was truly "overjoyed" at that. It's no fun
     having someone run over your swollen face with the jagged tips of
     little bones.

An annotated edition of the first volume of Kotik's memoir will be
published soon by Wayne State University Press.

Subject: Nadir's "der rebe Elimeylekh"

I am looking for the words for the Moshe Nadir poem of Der Rebe Elimeylekh,
from which the song was made.  Does anyone either have an accessible source
or could it be emailed to me or to the list?

Subject: kipelekh

I was discussing cookies of the old country with a friend.  She recalls a
cookie which her bubbe used to make, a big, puffy affair with a sour cream
dough she called kipelekh.  I have heard from another source of a caraway
roll, also called kipelekh.  I have seen a cookie called kipfel advertised
at a deli, but they seem to be more like kikhel.  What does anyone know of
the food that went along with these names?
