Subject: Vilna YIVO Archives

As an enthusiastic and long-time supporter of YIVO, I have been following
with great interest the recent postings on this list re the almost
miraculously rediscovered YIVO archives in Lithuania. I find it dismaying
that the original materials are considered to be "on loan" to YIVO and
will have to be eventually returned to Vilna (pardon me, to Vilnius). I
may be unrealistically naive, but couldn't a legal challenge be made as
to the ownership of this material?

One might have expected that the collapse of the communist regimes would
be accompanied by the re-establishment of some of the pre-World War II
rules governing the ownership of private property.  In 1947, the U.S.
State Department recognized YIVO in New York as the legitimate heir to
the Vilna YIVO collections found in Germany following the defeat of the
Nazis (see News of the YIVO, March 1951).  Now, it is likely that the
Lithuanian authorities are not as well-disposed to the New York YIVO as
was the U.S. Department of State, but it should be mentioned that
additional YIVO materials were recovered later from Vienna despite the
decidedly uncooperative attitude of the Austrian officials (News of the
YIVO, July 1957).

I find it difficult to believe that Lithuania could make a credible claim
to ownership of the YIVO collections.  I am no lawyer, however, and, as
the old saying goes: "possession [is] the strongest tenure of the law".
I suppose that YIVO does not wish to jeopardize the access to the
materials gained after lengthy and delicate negotiations, and copies are
much better than nothing, but I sure would like to see these literary
"She'erit Hapletah" reunited with their brethren.

Subject: Another bilingual coincidence?

The word "arriba" in Spanish means "above." Doesn't the word "ariber" in
Yiddish have similar meanings?

Subject: Bi-lingual coincidence

Varda Novick's gentle correction (4.358) of my Spanish phrase was not
unexpected, but its form was.  I had already been told by a member of my
Yiddish leyenkrayz that the Spanish word "aqui" means "here", not "where
(donde)".  So the correct translation of "aqui esta una mesa" is: "Here
is a table."

Varda's comments show that it is not unusual to have more than one way of
asking the same question.  I hope that the bi-lingual coincidence has
been "saved".

Subject: Poet and poem query

Dovid Moishe Goldstein's 99-year-old dad (er zol zikh eltern in eysher un
in koved!) can find other verses of the song he remembers in Ruth Rubin's
"A Treasury of Jewish Folksong," where its title is given as "Chatskele,
Chatskele" (khatskele, of course). Mendelyanishe musikologn will probably
confirm or revise Ruth's conclusion that this is an anonymous folk tune.

Subject: Sholem-Aleykem's opinion of his style

At the early age of 27 Sholem-Aleykhem had already been a popular writer
of "zhargon" for about three years.  His style was still developing but
he had some definite opinions about where his strength lay.  Ravnitski
was a critic whose opinion was highly valued among Jewish writers.  I
find it riveting to catch a glimpse of the developing style of such an
icon of the Yiddish world.

Ravnitski, invited Sholom Aleichem in early 1886 to write something for
Der Veker to stir love for Zion in Jewish hearts. "Po zakazu" is Russian.
Sholem-Aleykhem wrote:

Ikh volt aykh nisht gezhalevet       For you I would not be stingy in
keyn drames, satirishe epizodn,      furnishing dramas, satirical
humoristishe romantshiklekh,         vignettes, humorous novellas,
shtekhndike nodlen, baysndike        piercing needles, stinging gnats,
fliglekh, u.z.v., u.z.v. [un zo      etc. etc.  But then you offer me
vayter].  Vos zhe, az ir git mir     publication conforming to _your_
a zhurnal nokh _ayer_ gust un        taste, and you ask me to _write_.
heyst mir _shraybn_ - - - arbetn     Working "made according to order"
"po zakazu" toyg af kapores - - -    is good for the garbage.  I can't
ikh kon nit heysn yenem gloybn       advise another to believe in what
dort vu ikh gloyb aleyn zeyer        I myself have scant faith.  I
vintsik - - - ikh vil azoy az        want your idea to be embraced no
ayer idee zol ongenumen vern nit     less than you, but what can I do
vintsiker fun aykh, vos zol ikh      if I know my people, the children
ober tun az ikh kon mayn folk        of Israel, so very well that I
yisroel azoy shtark az ikh kon       can not believe that, deep in
nisht gloybn er zol dos nemen        their hearts,  they will fully
tsum hartsn.                         accept it.

Sholem-Aleykhem then ended the long letter with the following. It
contains Russian words, sposobne and seriozne.

Ikh bin iberal nit sposobne tsu      I have, by and large, no talent for
keyn seriozne roman.  Zeyt ir,       any serious novel.  You see, to
shpetn, oyslakhn, khoyzek makhn,     mock, ridicule, laugh away, crawl
araynkrikhn yenem in di gergeres     under people's skins, yet deliver
un fundestvegn tsushteln dem         pleasure to the reader, and make
lezer fargenign az er zol mikh       him also like me as I heap scorn,
far mayn khoyzek makhn oykh lib      for that, you see, I'm a bit of a
hobn - zeyt ir ot deroyf bin ikh     devil, a past master, all you
a mazik, a khvat, vifl ir vilt!      could want.  Can I be blamed that
Vos bin ikh shuldik az in yeder      in everything, in every person I
zakh un in yedn mentshn derzey       promptly see the _worst_ side?
ikh bald di _ergste_ zayt?
