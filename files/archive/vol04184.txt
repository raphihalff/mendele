Subject: Shprintse < Esperanza

Meyshe-Yankl Sweet (4.180,6) asks for additional references on the
etymology of Shprintse:

Maurice Samuel, in his _In Praise of Yiddish_ (p. 27), also suggests that
it derives fron Esperanza (hope).  He characterizes her as "a lively
good-natured daughter of an orthodox unpretentious household..."

Subject: bunke vs. lyak

A datum for Mikhl Herzog, from Harkavy's Yiddish-English-Hebrew
Dictionary (1928):

bunke - a kind of jug with a narrow neck; (H.) min kad im tsavar tsar
lyak - narrow-mouthed earthen vessel; (H.) kli kheres im tsavar tsar

Subject: bunke, lyak, grajevo

In 4.175 Dovid Braun wrote about pronunciation of bunke and about lyak as
spoken by yidn from the Grajevo area, near Byalistok.  I was shocked and
surprised that the shtetl that my parents migrated from in 1905 would
turn up in Mendele.   As a side-light, we always believed that the town
was wiped out during WWII.  Surprisingly not, because my sister (who I
hope will read this in Mendele from her house in Long Island) had
employed a woman, part of a group of Grajewo women, who came here to work
in houses so that they could send money and goods back home in Poland.
She was informed that the town was thriving and consisted of about 15,000
people (a far cry from the dirt road shtetl with its 'mark' in the
central part of the town).

To get back to the words, "bunki" or "lyak", I have no recollection of
either word being used.

Good to hear from a second generation landsman.  I doubt that anyone
would know or recall, but my father's name then was Byalishevski and my
mother's Buzinsky.

Subject: Prokofiev Overture on ???? themes

I wish to thank all of those who spent time and trouble getting my head
shaped correctly with respect to what title of the Prokofiev "Overture On
Hebrew/Yiddish/Jewish Themes" is the most appropriate.

Of particular delight to me was a sentence in Dvorah Biasca's detailed
response which read "'Yiddish' is the English equivalent of 'Hebrew' in
Russian."  That one left my head spinning for it is rare for a single
sentence of only 9 words to contain the names for 4 different languages.
I had to think about that for quite a while before all parts of it sat
correctly.

Soreh Benor indicated that Prokofiev denied the music's Jewishness while
Arre Komar stated that he used a very well known Yiddish folk song
"Zayzhe dir gezunt mayne tayer eltern" which he is said to have been
taught by his room-mate in NY, Boris Tomashevsky (more on him in a
moment). And I was advised that the music was no known Jewish song or
songs but was, instead, created for the composition by the clarinetist
Simeon Bellison, formerly 1st clarinet in the NY Philharmonic.

Finally Howie Aronson glued it all together with a very cogent
description of how one speaks about Jews in Russian.

It was all very helpful and I am most appreciative, but I am left with
two problems, or I should say two questions:  whatever the translation,
what is a 'Hebrew' theme, or what is a 'Yiddish' theme?

Jewish music I can speak about with some intelligence, but Yiddish music
and/or Hebrew music are terms that have no definition.  I am not
referring to music which happens to have words in either Yiddish or
Hebrew, but music that may be identified because it has the
characteristic of being Yiddish or Hebrew, and I don't know what that is.
If I were to sing "All the things you are" in Yiddish, that would not
make it Jewish music.  And the tune "Bay mir bist du sheyn" only made it
to the top of the charts when it became an American song sung by the
Andrew sisters, though it still retained enough of its Jewish character
that everyone speaks of it in this sense, not as a WW2 pop song.

If I play the 'Survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto' of Arnold Schoenberg, that
is clearly music by a Jew about Jews, but is it Jewish music?  Certainly
the nazis thought so.  They referred to his music in this pejorative
fashion.  If I play 'Hebrew Rhapsody' for cello and orchestra, I play a
work that has a recognizable Jewish character because the tune is part of
liturgy, is sung by a cantor at the time of Yom Kippur, but is it Hebrew
music?  If I play "Di grine kuzine" am I playing Yiddish music (because
it happens to have Yiddish lyrics) or is it Jewish music?  And if it is
Jewish music, what makes it more Jewish than say, the Mozart Requiem?  In
fact, the Mozart Requiem was considered sufficiently Jewish with respect
to one fugue (Quam olim Abrahae promisisti = From the seed of Abraham-we
were promised) that the nazis changed the text during performances of the
work during WW2.

Precisely what is the characteristic of music that allows it to be called
'Jewish', much less Yiddish or Hebrew?

I suspect that this is a question more for an ethnological/musicological
bulletin board, but you gotta' start someplace.

Let me end with my Boris Tomachefsky story, please.  The new conductor of
the San Francisco symphony is Michael Tilson Thomas, grandson of the
famous Yiddish actor, and at a concert I did with him in NY a long time
ago, I told him the following joke about his grandfather:

Tomachefsky was doing Hamlet in NY.  In the middle of the soliloquy, "Tsu
zayn -- nisht tsu zayn" he turned red in the face and fell to the floor!

The curtains came down in mid scene and a half hour went by before the
theater manager came out and said to the audience, "Ladies and gentlemen,
it grieves me to tell you that our star, the world-famous Boris
Tomachefsky, has died."

GASP!!! And from the balcony a voice shouts out, "Give him an enema!"

The theater manager says, "Sir.  Perhaps you did not hear me.  Mr.
Tomachefsky is not ill.  He is dead."

Same voice shouts, "Give him an enema."

"Sir," says the theater manager, "it will not help."

The voice shouts down, "It wouldn't hurt."

Michael enjoyed the joke about his grandfather.
