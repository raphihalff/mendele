Subject: pishe-peyshe vs. patshe-patshe kikhelekh

Ted Steinberg, might you not mean patshe-patshe from the rhyme
"patshe-patshe kikhelekh" as the Yiddish pat-a-cake (and not
pishe-peyshe)?

Subject: Yiddish counting-out rhymes

Having broached the subject of children's folklore (hurray!), would
readers please submit the Yiddish counting-out rhymes they are
familiar with (with all relevant info:  when they used it, where,
how, from whom they learned it, from where that person is/was).

A dank in foroys!

Subject: written yiddish v. speech

Neil G Jacobs <njacobs@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu> writes [Vol. 3.174]:

>etc. Furthermore, the issue of written vs. spoken language can also

I find this fantastically interesting. I was just reading the
booklet "a klimentover yid dertseylt" published in Poland shortly
after WWII which is an account of a survivor of the khurbn in Poland
who somehow made it through those horrors. In his story he gives a
detailed account of what he lived through.

What interests me is that I just couldn't square the language in
which the book is written with the the yiddish that my father (born
in Klimontow and lived there until age 14) spoke. Even allowing for
some change in my father's language, it just didn't add up. Besides
the language difference, the places were almost all given their
Polish names e.g. Ostrowiec (ostrotvtse), Sandomier (tsouzmir),
Opatow (apt), Tarnobrzeg (dzhikev) etc. I am quite certain that
yiddish speaking Jews referred to towns by their yiddish names. Not to
mention the constructions (and spellings) in the book e.g. der hoykh
(heykh), ongehoybn (ongeheybn) and so on.

Maybe what happened was that the story was transcribed by a literary
author (who may or may not have been a local person) and words were
deliberately respelt to conform to a publishing norm.
