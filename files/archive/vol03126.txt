Subject: Birobidszhaner Shtern as seen by Robert Hoberman

Last year I saw a copy of the Shtern; a six or eight page paper
brought back to the States by a "shaliach" sent there to organize
Jewish youth camps (also to Moscow and St.Petersburg).It was chiefly
remarkable for its awful print, misspellings (even according to the
"Freiheit" model of phonetically spelling any Hebrew terms) and its
news was almost entirely about the local agriculture and animal
husbandry. The only item of Jewish interest was an interview with
this individual who had gone there as a shaliach. The level of
Jewish life, gauged by that paper must be very limited indeed.

My acquaintance estimates not more than 4-5 thousand Jews living
there, although in  its heyday, there could have been as many as
25-35 thousand, not all of them willing or "happy campers". He told
us that the camp was eagerly attended by up to 35 % non-Jewish
children whose parents were happy for the opportunity.

Incidentally, I happen to have personally seen the "famous" sign in
Yiddish designating the railway station in Birobidzhan, when I was
traveling the trans-Siberian Railway between Khabarovsk and Tashkent
during World War II, not as a tourist, but as a US soldier-airman,
who became an unwilling guest of the USSR. Then, as now, the aim of
many Jews whom I met was "Get me out of here!"I don't know how much
faith can be placed in any revival of Yiddish culture in Russia,
generally, and in Siberia and Birobidzhan in particular. Naturally,
one hopes! In that I am one with Robert!

Subject: German Holem

A couple of people have asked me to clarify my comment on
German-Jewish [aw] versus [ow].  What I said was a guess, very
likely a rash one, based on a few observations.  Probably some
Mendelnikes will have some information that can either support it or
knock it down.  In any case, I guess I've gotten in the habit of
taking historical guesses based on slim linguistic evidence -- I
hope I haven't given the impression that that's what linguists do
for a living! (Well, some do, but no one thinks they're good
linguists.)  And I hope no one takes my guesses for gospel, nisht do
gedakht.

My comment was based on what I heard in the 1970's and 1980's in a
German synagogue in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York City.  Two
rather elderly brothers frequently served as shliakh tsibur, and I
noticed that one of them pronounced holem as [aw] and tsere as [e:]
(prolonged [e]), while the other had [ow] and [ey] respectively.
(Both had [o:] for kamets and had the identical pronunciation as far
as I could tell.)  I asked them about it, and they attributed the
difference to their different educational backgrounds, with [ow],
[ey] as the more old-fashioned.  The brother with [ow], [ey] had
studied in a yeshiva away from home.  Now it's possible that the
yeshiva pronunciation had some (Eastern) Yiddish influence, but they
didn't seem to think so.  I don't know anything about Western
Yiddish pronunciation (all the Juedischdeutsch expressions that my
in-laws use are fully compatible in pronunciation with their German
dialect, except that the kh sound, as in Yiddish ikh, occurs in
phonetic environments where it can't in German), so I can't say
whether or not [ow] and [ey] existed in Western Yiddish of a few
hundred years ago, but they don't in the relevant varieties of
German, while [aw] and [e:] are frequent in German.

Michael Shimshoni pointed out to me that Samson Raphael Hirsch
transcribed Hebrew holem as "au" in his books, written in the
mid-nineteenth century, and that Hirsch was very concerned about
precise and correct Hebrew pronunciation. That proves that the
pronunciation [au] existed in German Jewish usage at least as far
back as 150 years ago.  We have to remember, though, that Hirsch,
was the leader of the modern trend in Orthodoxy; among other things,
he chose to write some of his works in German (rather than Hebrew).

That's about all I know.  The rest is a guess.  I guess that the two
styles of pronunciation may have been in competition for as much as
a couple of hundred years.  The person who would know best would be
Prof. Werner Weinberg of the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati.  Or
maybe Mikhl Herzog has some relevant information.

Subject: searching for singer

      The Boston Kleztet, an avocational yet authentic klezmer band
in the West Suburban Boston area, is searching for a female
vocalist, skilled in singing Yiddish and perhaps also Hebrew/Israeli
songs.  We average about 2 gigs/month, and occasionally we have need
for a vocalist.  For example, for an engagement party scheduled for
January 2, 1994, the hosts wish to evoke a cabaret atmosphere and
they have specifically requested that a female vocalist sing with
our band, to entertain while the guests rest from what is to be
expected as very spirited yiddishe dancing.  Our band consists of
clarinet, violin, keyboard, banjo/mandolin, and double bass.  Can
any of the mendeleniks and their numerous contacts out there help
us?
