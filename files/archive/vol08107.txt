Subject: Yiddish Word Order

I am studying linguistics at the University of Manchester (UK) and am
currently involved in a project which is looking at clause structure in
Yiddish.

You will probably all be aware that Yiddish has a basic SVO word order
(subject, verb, object), not unlike English.  This is not entirely
predictable, as Yiddish's nearest cognate (or sister language) is German,
which displays an underlying SOV order.  There are, however, some
constructions in Yiddish, which continue to display SOV qualities.  Should
any of you know how this reversal of word order came about I would be very
interested to hear about these events. 

Not being a Yiddish speaker I wondered if I may use this list to gather 
data (if, of course, this is acceptable and/or of interest to the 
owners/users).  In particular I am interested in the acceptability of 
preverbal nominal objects. 

If I may expand:

Ix hob gezen Moisn

follows the predicted SVO order, but according to the data I have come 
across the reverse (and threfore SOV version ) is equally acceptable:

Ix hob Moisn gezen.

Indeed, if we have two objects (direct and indirect), the indirect must
precede the verb, as in: 

Er hot Soren nextn gegebn a matone.

while it is supposedly unacceptable to have two nominal objects preceeding
the verb, as in: 

Er hot Soren dos bux gegebn.

 From having followed your list for a short while I get a glimpse of the
many dialects and versions that together represent 'Yiddish'.  My ignorance
of the language hinders my enquiries and I wondered if any of you could
point me in the right direction in terms of reading, or just reply as to
what you think is acceptable and whether different dialects display
differing word order rules. 

In return I would freely offer any findings by way of short paper should you
be interested. 

Thanking you in advance for your time

Subject: A yidisher vits

For those who may have missed it or who don't subscribe to the Yiddish
_Forverts_ here is a charming bit of whimsy that appeared in the humor
column of the current (Dec. 25th) edition:  [My transliteration]

A yid iz gevorn shver tsu trogn af zikh dem yidishn goles, hot er eyn
inderfri bashlosn zikh tsu shmadn.  Tsu morgns zet dos vayb vi er shteyt oyf

Subject: 2nd Ave Theater in NY

Recently, Alan Berkowitz of Montgomery, Alabama, wrote about seeing Jewish
shows at the Second Avenue Theater. I, too, was about ten at the time, and
since the theater was the love of my parents' life, I saw all of those
wonderful performers.  When the show was over, (musicals) they would sell
the sheet music in the lobby. We had a piano at home, and while mom played,
I sang. (the words, of course, were on the music sheet). I learned a good
deal of my Yiddish in that manner, but more importantly, developed a love of
Yiddish music that remains until today.

Subject: "Lailekh"

Contrary to Leo Secunda's supposition, the Yiddish noun "lailekh" (= sheet)
does not derive from a medieval French dialect:  it's from the now obselete
German word "Lailekh"/"Lailaken" (= linen sheet), which goes back to Old
High German "lailahhan"--and is presumably cognate with modern German
"Leinen" (= linen), etc.....

Subject: use of "bod"

Just to add to the confusion or hopefully to elucidation I suggest the
following possibilities for the the expression - Ich hub im in bod. 

Considering the use of the word bath as in bathroom constituting a reference
to the privy, the phrase might constitute a derisive dismissal relegating
the subject thereto and if it be an outhouse (as it probably was)  all the
better. 

A contemptuous dismissal as in the English "go take a bath".

Subject: "Nupse"?

Dear friends 

Is anyone familiar with an allegedly yiddish word "nupse"?  I'm not sure of
the spelling. It apparently means a little thing that throw a big thing out
of whack. e.g. getting to the airport on time only to discover your plane
tickets are in the jacket you decided at the last minuted not to wear on the
trip.

Many thanks.

Subject: Joseph Roth in Yiddish

In Michael Hofmann's introduction to his translation of _The Tale of the
1002nd Night_ (1998) by the great Joseph Roth (1894-1939), there appears an
interesting bibliographic note.  The novel was perhaps the last of Roth's to
be published in his lifetime.  But "some copies of an early version of the
book were printed and circulated in 1937, and from this version translations
were made into Yiddish and distributed in Roth's native Galicia".

Surely an odd way of distributing a translation.  In any case I have three
questions, arranged from small to large. 

1. Does anyone have any information about the translation? 

2. How was the book received in the Yiddish-reading world?  This applies as
well to any of Roth's other novels if translated.

3. Which of Roth's "Middle European" contemporaries, e.g. Musil, Broch,
Heinrich Mann, Svevo, Nabokov, Canetti, Zweig, Wassermann, etc. were
translated and how were they received?  (Here some bibiographic references
would be sufficient.) 

A dank. 

At least two of Roth's other books, by the way, bear a strong resemblance to
the grim novel by Israel Rabon (1900-1942), _di gas_ (1928, reissued by
Magnes Press, 1986, with a fine introductory essay by the late Chone
Shmeruk).  I haven't read the first of these, _Hotel Savoy_ (1924), but
Shmeruk himself points out the parallel, though he doubts whether Rabon had
read it.  Shmeruk doesn't mention a second Roth novel, _Flight Without End_
(1927)  which is so much like _di gas_ in feel and mood that the
protagonists from one could easily trade places in alternate chapters with
no injury to either story.  No nasty suspicions intended.  The truth is the
strangest of all accounts.

Subject: A new mailing list for children of Holocaust survivors

I have started a new discussion list for children of Holocaust survivors as
part of my attempts in recent years to establish an international
organization of children of Holocaust survivors.  I do this not only as a
child of two Holocaust survivors, but very much as a Yiddishist who has
always believed az merste fun di kinder fun sheyres-hapleyte kenen shoyn

The 2G-Legacy mailing list is a new list for children and grandchildren of
Jewish Holocaust Survivors, dedicated to the discussion of, and hopefully
action on, social, political, and historical issues related to the
Holocaust.  Rather than a list for the exploration of psychological and
parental relationship issues, this is a list for those who want to focus on
understanding and furthering the legacy of the Holocaust.  The goals of the
list are: (1) greater awareness among, and education of, second and third
generation children of Holocaust survivors so that we may learn to (2)
implement effective memory, action, and justice for Holocaust victims and
the perpetuation and (3)  revival of the Jewish (particularly Yiddish)
culture that the Nazis tried to destroy.  This list will be a place for
informed discussion on all issues important to 2G's, especially political,
historical, and financial Holocaust issues. 

To subscribe to this list, send the following message:

        subscribe 2G-Legacy your-first-name your-last-name

NOTE: You must subscribe with your real name. No aliases are allowed.
