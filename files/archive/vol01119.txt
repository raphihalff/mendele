Re: /vatnmakher/

I look forward to Mikhl Herzog's finding of the work of Dov
Sadan on the topic. In the meantime, I must say that my
group's gloss of the term as 'cotton-maker' is surely not
good. Having looked it up in the Harkavy and Weinreich
dictionries, I guess a better gloss is 'wadding-maker' or
'padding-maker.' It must be a person who makes cotton
stuffing for quilted garments or bed- quilts. Anyway, an
explanation of the folklore is still needed.

I'm just guessing, but might it be a reference to the
vatenmakher taking old horses, slaughtering them, and using
them (perhaps the bones?) in some way relating to his
trade?  I plead ignorance as to what a cotton-maker
actually does.  (Doesn't cotton *grow*?)

There's a feminine suffix -ekhe, which I've mostly seen
used two ways:

1)  In folktales and the like, to form words for female
    animals where there is no established word for the
    female. (berekhe = she-bear).

2)  To form a nickname for a woman based on her husband's
    name; Mikhl has given examples of this.

Both uses have, to my "ear", an old-fashioned
folksy/humorous sound. (I put "ear" in quotes because I
think I've only encountered this suffix in writing.)

Yudel Mark's grammar mentions these two uses, and also

3)  Forming a nickname for a woman based on her lastname
(e.g. Goldbergekhe).

Maybe the reason Noyekh preferred this suffix is that the
woman in question was the wife of a judge rather than a
female judge. Previously the other feminine suffixes were
often used this way, but nowadays, in non-orthodox circles,
a khaznte is more likely to be a female cantor than the
wife of a cantor (I think :-). So maybe Noyekh preferred
this (rare) suffix because it's unambiguous: it always, as
far as I know, names a woman based on the name of the
corresponding male, while the other suffixes nowadays tend
to name a woman based on her own characteristics. (And more
power to them for that!)
