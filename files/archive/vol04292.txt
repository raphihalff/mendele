Subject: _Apikoyres_

Omeyn! to Mikhl Herzog's gloss of _apikoyres_ as "heretic."  My late
father-in- law, Harry Siller, z"l, had a wonderful story illustrating
this, which I will relate in English.

A man prides himself as being the biggest apikoyres in the world.  One
day he hears of a man in Shnipishek who is an even bigger apikoyres than
he is, and he decides to go visit him.  He arrives there early in the
morning after a three-day walk, and he is directed to this man's house.
There is no answer when he knocks, but since the door is ajar he enters
quitely, only to find the target of his search standing in the room
wrapped in a talis and tfilin and shokling. He waits for the man to
finish davening, and then tells him of his surprise to find the person
purported to be the biggest apikoyres in the world engaged in such
activity.  The man responds, "Well, I may be an apikoyres but I'm not a
goy!"

Subject: Ayn por shikh

Sometime between 1939 and 1943 at the Borokhov shule on division street
in Chicago, Fishl Oderberg and I learned a song that goes something like
this:

Ayn por shikh hobn mir
Ayn por shikh ikh un er
Gayen mir in di letste mode un tsuzamen kain mol nisht
Ven Archie daf gayn, bleyb ikh in shtub alayn
Ven Archie daf gayn, bleyb ikh in shtub alayn
Lebn mir in zalbanand
In gliklach un farban
bsholem bshas bvei harmonie ikh un er.

Now the question is, is there more to this song I don't remember?
Is it written anywhere with notes and music etc. I'd love to get hold of
it.

Subject: Mzinke

Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan:

"Di Mizinke" is the last remaining unmarried daughter. So when she has
been "oisgegebn" all the daughters have been married off (and presumably
the necessary "nadn" successfully obtained). Truly a time for rejoicing.

Subject: Yiddish and German

I wish to thank Mikhl Herzog and Dovid Braun. they hit the nail on the
head, indeed several nails but unfortunately only one head.  Although my
childhood language was Yiddish I had to study German in college. To
survive I was compelled to unlearn Yiddish in many subtle ways. In later
life it is the German that I have attempted to unlearn, but as you can
see, not with great success.  Incidently, in case you couldn't have
guessed, the Yiddish dictionary that I employ is Harkavy. However,
although it is totally accepting of so-called "daytchmerisms" it also
happens to comport much more strongly with the Yiddish of my parents,
relatives and childhood neighbors than does Weinreich. And in that
respect I'm not misremebering since I have made an effort to check with
siblings and Brooklyn friends.

Subject: Boston Globe Yiddish article

The Boston Globe Magazine of Sun. Jan. 22 contains an article "Mazel
[sic] Tov:  A Yiddish Revival [sic]".

One paragraph is devoted to yours truly, containing two quotations.  I
would like it publicly known that the first quotation is mine, although
totally out of context ("It takes chutzpah to consider Yiddish dead") and
the second is not even a quotation -- or perhaps a quotation of somebody
else, but not me. As such, I won't even print it, but I do dissociate
myself from it.

As I told the reporter, a historian of modern Ashkenazic Jewry was
recently talking to me about Yiddish and at one point said, "Well,
everyone knows that Yiddish is a dead language."  This was especially
surprising coming from this individual since the person is well-informed
about contemporary Jewish society and, in addition, is known to be a
defender of the rights of minorities and of the underdog in general.  As
far as I was concerned, dismissing two statistically significant
subpopulations and one valiant but statistically insignificant
subpopulation of Jewry is khutspe, especially since it came from an
individual who is (or should be) knowledgeable of the statistics.  (The
subpopulations are, of course, a. the ultra-Orthodoxy, b. senior
citizenry, c. non-ultra-Orthodox, non-seniors who use Yiddish regularly
with their families.)  This person agreed, with little resistance, that
indeed if you are 60 and over, that doesn't qualify you as dead; and if
you observe your religion in a particular way, you also should not be
considered dead.  Just because these communities are marginal wrt
mainstream society should not kill them.

Subject: Shalatn-shames

Sam Juni, we _should_ make it an international affair. The more the
merrier. I have a friend in Israel who's been badgering me for two years
to tell him the etymology of this word. Did I once pose a query on
Mendele about it? In any event, let's get the budding Toronto linguist in
on the act to (does he have a name?); and your Mexican mishpokhe, too. Do
they all speak Yiddish? Carpathian Yiddish? A treasure! Which of the
Carpathian towns are they all from?

Back to the _shalatn-shames_. My definition is actually quite different
than yours. A "gopher" is, after all, someone you send. A
_shalatn-shames_ is distinguished by the fact that you don't have to send
him; _er geyt shoyn aleyn_. In other words _er iz eyner vos tut
nit-getene toyves_. Test that on the fount of all knowledge--your mother.
