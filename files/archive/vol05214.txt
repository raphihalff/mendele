Moyshe-Zekharye Beker

For those who are interested in the supposed death of Yiddish, you might wish to
read Dovid Katz's very fine rebuttal to Philologos' recent assessment.  See the
latest issue of the "Forverts" (January 5, 1996), "Yidish shtarbt shoyn
vider..." [Yiddish is dying once again].  Prof. Katz deals cogently with the
topic; now, if only the English "Forward" were to publish a translation of his
article for its readers!

Subject: Life of Yiddish

I normally ignore discussions about the putative death of Yiddish, since it's
obviously alive; but a recent personal experience seems worth reporting.

Having a routine appointment with the doctor, and knowing that the office wait
can often be quite long, I took along a softcover book (in Yiddish) to read
while waiting.

After the appointment, while paying the bill, I placed the book on the counter.
The young secretary (perhaps 20 or fewer years old), noticing the Yiddish title,
asked what the language was. As I was anxious to finish my business and leave, I
answered, simply (though pleasantly): "Yiddish," with no further explanation.
After a moment she asked: "Where is that spoken?" At this point I realized that
I had an obligation to explain, and told her that it was the language of the
Eastern European Jews who were murdered by the nazis, and that many Jews,
including myself, still spoke it, and worked to revive it as an expression of
the culture the nazis tried to destroy.

Suddenly, what had for her been ancient history learned in dry textbooks, came
to life. Surprisingly, she knew more about recent Jewish history than I would
have expected of a non-Jew, especially a youngster. I was pleased that she
applauded the efforts to restore Yiddish culture through its language and its
arts. She asked many questions about Yiddishkite (a word that was new to her),
and we spent a pleasant quarter-hour on my favorite topic.

What most impressed me was this young non-Jewish girl's intuitive recognition
that possibly the greatest honor we could do for the victims of the khurbm would
be to perpetuate their language.

Subject: language death

hershl hartman writes that the relevance to yiddish of the research on dying
languages depends on whether or not they have a written literature and, if so,
how big it is and whether it's still being produced. to which i reply:

uh, yiddish should be so lucky to have the written literature of the two dead
languages i mentioned, latin and sanskrit. and yes, there is still literature
being produced (and published...and read) in both of them. the fact remains that
a language is considered 'dead' or 'alive' according to whether children are
learning it in the normal way that children acquire languages, and the presence
or absence of a written literary tradition and corpus is irrelevant. children
acquiring a native language do not know (or care) about its literature...

Subject: Hasofe

Checking Eli Katz's message in di sforim--dictionaries, that is--I find that
both Weinreich and Harkavy give _no other_ definitions for hasofe than "appendix
(to a book); raise (in pay)" (Weinreich);  "1) supplement; 2) addition; 3) raise
(_of salary_)" Harkavy.

Nothing new. While Yiddish derives many words from loshn koydesh, the meanings
are often quite different. That might just imply that Yiddish is historically
secular in its outlook.

Subject: Tracking down an article

A few years ago, I read a very interesting journal article, and I thought I had
copied it.  I can't find it.  I have forgotten the reference, but not the
subject matter.  I believe the title includes something about the _secular
dimension of Yiddish culture_.  One of the points made was that in the late 19th
and early 20th century, the American Yiddish-speaking Jews having suffered from
religionists in Russia were determined to erase religion from their lives.  Some
even went so far as to organize a Yom Kippur Ball to assert both independence
from and ridicule of their religious heritage.  The article made the case (I
believe) that it was eventually found impossible to eradicate reference to
Judaic traditions from the language.  It just did not _feel_ Jewish.

Can anyone recall such a paper?  If so, I'd appreciate the reference.  It
contains material that I believe is relevant to appraisal of current movements
that seem to try to remove Judaism and Yidishkayt from Jewishness.

Subject: WWW Yiddish site

Recipients of Mendele may be interested in visiting a new World Wide Web (under
construction) site set up by the J.Waks Cultural Centre Inc.. The page provides
information on Yiddish oriented organisations in Melbourne Australia. The page
uses English and Yiddish. The Yiddish is not in the form of an image file but is
entered as normal text. The page provides instructions and pointers on how to
set your WWW browser to read such text. The address is
http://www.ozemail.com.au/~mzylberm

Comments and suggestions would be appreciated.

Subject: Farpotshketing?

This is a message forwarded from the Lantra-l translators list. I thought it
might be of interest to some of you. I think the verb should be a bit different.
Can anyone help out, perhaps by mailing directly to lantra-l@searn.sunet.se ?

Here is the post:
___________
>farpotshket (Yiddish): Something that is all fouled up, especially
>as the result of an attempt to fix it.

<snip> Can the transitive verb "to farpotshket" be counted upon as
the one million and first word of the English language? <snip>
____________

Thanks,

Daniel Bugel

Subject: Willy Wonka

Not having seen the movie I do not know what Gene Wilder said in Yiddish, but
fervently hope it was something that would make R.Dahl's ears burn, that rabid
anti-semite. But, then, the medium itself is the message, isn't it? The item was
documented in the (British?) press some years ago. At the risk of appearing
revisionist, I must say I never much cared for his work, even before I knew he
didn't care for ours.

Subject: The apostrophe in Romanized Yiddish

I wholeheartedly align myself with the criticism by Marion Aptroot (5.208) and
Alan R. King (5.212) about my suggestions for apostrophes in romanized Yiddish
(5.203).  Since these suggestions were solely delimited to readers and speakers
of English, as evidenced by a number of examples, readers and speakers of
_other_ languages might find a need for new signs and symbols to meet special
phonetic or spelling characteristics of these tongues, and such an approach
would be tantamount to opening a Pandora box.

The YIVO romanization system is a universally accepted system to transcribe
Yiddish in all languages using Latin letters, and it is therefore best not to
tamper with it.

Mendele readers will find an in-depth study of the YIVO transcription system,
with details and explications, in David L. Gold's article "A Guide to the
Standardized Yiddish Romanization" in _Jewish Language Review_ (Vol. 5, 1985,
pp. 96-108).
