Subject: PRONUNCIATION
 
Re. Mendele vol. 1.132: Bob Goldberg's query on clues to
pronunication via rhymes in songs:

As kids we used to sing:

Oy khanuke, oy khanuke
A yontif, a sheyner
A lustike, a frelikhe
A brokh of deine beyner...

"We" came from a little town near Kiev -- Sokolifke.
According to my rela- tives, the town numbered no more than
200 souls.  But the Sokolifke cemetery in Buffalo -- a city
which apparently remains the mecca of former native
Sokolifke rs -- contains several hundred graves of original
Sokolifkers.  No Sokolifker I know would claim to be a
Galitzianer or Litvack -- heaven forfend!  They all say
they're "Ruhshshish."  The point of this little story is:
who knows how widespread this particular haccent is?  Or
exactly what kind?  Bob's bube, from noy Shtot near Krakow,
seems to share many similarities of accent with my fami-
ly.  There are a few differences.  My bube used to say -- I
reproduce this pho- netically rather that orthographiucally
-- mawe-mehle, taw-tehle, not mamele, tatele.  Kayn-e-hora,
bubele, etc., seems to capture Sokolifke sprakh.

Well, since the subject has come up again, I'll write what
I was thinking before, but didn't get around to writing
before.

I don't think the phonology of pharyngealization in Semitic
has anything to do with this. Why?

1)  These "intrusive" [n]s occur in the environment of 3
    loshn koydesh consonants: ayin, aleph & he. Ayin was
    originally a pharyngeal glide, but aleph (glottal stop)
    and he (ordinary [h]) were not.

2)  The one other consonant that was originally pharyngeal
    is khes. To my knowledge, the "intrusive" [n] never
    shows up in words with khes.

So I think that pharyngeality is a red herring. (Vi zogt
men "red herring" oyf yidish?)

What ayin, aleph & he have in common? Well, he as often
become silent in loshn koydesh words, while ayin and aleph
have become silent everywhere (ignoring the fact that
they're used to spell vowels in non-loshn koydesh words).

So I think the answer is more likely to have something to
do with the phonetics of vowel coalesence or compensatory
lengthening than with pharyngeality.

I haven't seen any other replies, so I'll give it a stab;
It's hard to answer without knowing your language-learning
background.

The best reference for beginners in U. Weinreich's "College
Yiddish". The main problem with it as a textbook is that it
presumes a good deal of familiarity with grammatical
terminology: back when it was written, most college
students had had a year or two of Latin. Many people
nowadays have trouble with this; if you don't, I recommend
this book.

The easier books I'm familiar with are particularly good
for people who start out without already knowing the
aleph-beys, but that's not likely to apply to you if you're
religious. For the record (and from memory): 1) "Learning
Yiddish in easy Stages" by Marion Herbst (??). 2) a booklet
+ cassette combination by Yudel Mark (the title escapes
me). 3) "The Yiddish Teacher" an old (30's) book whose
author escapes me.

I hear that Sheva Zucker is writing a new textbook, and I
have high hopes for it, but as far as I know it isn't
available yet.

With respect to religion, the only book I know that
mentions an explicit attempt to avoid being offensive is
Schaechter's "Yiddish II". I don't think any of the books
are openly hostile; while I can't judge what you might find
offensive, I know observant Jews who teach from "College
Yiddish" without discomfort.
