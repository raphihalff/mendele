Subject: Learning Yiddish alone

To respond to the person studying Yiddish, I would like make a few suggestions 
and observations. I am impressed with the energy put into the process, working 
with College and dictionary will get one there eventually, at least as far as 
reading comprehension is concerned, though never to speaking. Because you will 
come out sounding like a textbook and will make all kinds of funny mistakes. 
Yiddish is so similar to German that it is beguiling, because so much of its 
essence is entirely its own. 

1. First, I would say, learning a language from books is a lonely process.
So find people, wherever they are, who know Yiddish and listen to them and
talk with them eventually. There are courses at universities and community
centers that will help you. Languages are meant to be spoken and Yiddish
is not a dead language, despite rumours..

2. Sheva Zucker's Introduction to Yiddish Language and Culture comes with
tapes.

3. You can get Yiddish films from a variety of sources. Listen to the
intonations, discourse patterns.

4. There is a Yiddish 30? cassette out commercially that is good for
learning the days of the week etc. as well as pronunciation. Also get some
tapes of Dzigan, the Yiddish comedian. He is funny and speaks with a
wonderful regional accent that you need to listen to - balancing out the
Standard, which often lacks some of the fun and musicality of Yiddish. 

5. To improve reading speed, the best bet is to work with simple, very
predictable texts that have lots of repetition in them. That will help you
train your eye to scan more rapidly.

Good luck
Zol dir zayn mit mazl.

Subject: learning (more) yiddish & loving it

Dear Mendelyaner ...

I will deviate from my policy of writing in Yiddish for the sake of the
lurking Mendelyaners with  questions similar to those of Khaver Allen
Dronet. And instead of answering him personally, I will speak to the body
general of those who admit they need to know more Yiddish, but are going
about it the wrong way.

We who love and teach Yiddish are painfully aware that the bum rap Yiddish
has received for so long permeates even the world of those who purport to
love Yiddish - the analogy of being ready to kiss off a beloved moribund
grandmother springs to mind. But this bube is alive and jogging and kicking
and worthy of respect, even within the meshpokhe.

Let Mr. Dronet be aware, living as he does in Los Angeles, that he has many
opportunities there to learn the language in a more formal and structured
way. Contact UCLA and other universities, write YIVO, check the Workmen's
Circle, Yiddish clubs, etc. Many good classes are offered which give an
opportunity to interract.

If he has no time or opportunity, I'd suggest Sheva Zucker's "Yiddish: An
Introduction to the Language, Culture and Literature." which also offers
companion tapes he can play in the car and she has prepared answer keys as
well.  For continuing students, I find the new Yale offering to be
excellent -- "Yidish af Yidish" by David Goldberg, founded on solid
pedagogic principles by the late, great Yudl Mark.

For everyone else, with Yiddish being offered in over 50 universities
worldwide, not to mention adult ed classes in many, many more venues ...
and a plethora of new materials coming out to meet the demand, there's no
excuse not to acquire mame loshn "vi es darf tzu zayn."

I don't believe that young Sholem Berger's excoriation of NYBC came from
khutzpah, perhaps an excess of love for mame loshn and the wounds we lovers
of Yiddish feel about the "About Yiddish" approach as a substitute for
"Yidish Af Yidish" -- there is no substitute for the real thing. For us
NYBC and Pakntreger can be a mixed blessing.  On the negative side (like
listening to Klez) it can make some less enlightened friends of Yiddish
feel they are doing something Yiddish, without having to pay their dues and
actually learn the language. Every fall, as my classes troop in, I
encounter shock from some, when they discover that I expect them to learn
(gasp!) alef-beyz. If they take Russian, they come in predisposed to tackle
Cyrillic. And the issue of grammar is a whole other mayse.

The Public Radio readings of Yiddish stories gave lots of folks the
impression they were "doing Yiddish" -- which of course they weren't. And
these folks haven't a clue from this material, as with any translation from
Yiddish, as to what they missed.

On the positive side, the center has rescued a wealth of Yiddish material
for all of us to enjoy. It is moving into Yidish af Yidish in some areas.
Many Yiddish programs and Yiddish readers are enriched by the materials
they can make available.

More importantly, in its popularity and name recognition, it can provide a
beginning for those with Yiddish curiosity, to move in, a toe in the water
as it were, and go further. But further they must go.

I hope that Pakntreger will soon also run articles in Yiddish along with
the English, perhaps some mini lessons with a little alef-beys.

Let's look at the Yiddish Renaissance. It's not the product of a committee
of scholars that sat down and planned it. It is a historic response within
Ashkenazic World Jewry to reconnect with what it almost lost. It is a
mosaic, not a monolith. And there is a place for Klezmer music, and NYBC
and English Forwards -- just as long as there are Yiddish speakers and
students and Yugntrufs and League for Yiddish and Arbeter Ring and Yiddish
Clubs and Vinkls.

Twenty years ago, I could barely find anyone to speak and sing Yiddish with
anymore -- except old folks. Now -- gotenyu, an embarrassment of riches! I
could even do Yiddish this summer in Paris. Or a Yugntruf  sof-vokh. Ten
years ago, the average American Jewish wedding band played a few Freylakhs,
a dash of Tumbalalaika. Belz and Yidishe Mame, something from Fiddler --
something Israeli -- and fartik!  Now the average klez band  -- more of
them, and mostly young people - play Saposhkelekh and Shirele Perele and
doinas and Lomir Zikh Iberbetn, and ... well you get the idea.

So there is a place for you in Yiddishland, Khaver Dronet. And others like
you quietly lurking on Mendele. Don't just lurk -- learn. If you really
learn Yiddish, you'll know why German and Yiddish are not one and the same,
even if they share some common linguistic roots. What they don't share of
course is Hebrew and Aramaic and Slavic, simple Jewish linguistic
creativity that made whole new words out of disparate elements.

Yiddish is a fusion language, a shmeltzshprakh. But nowadays when we speak
of fusion, it's in the atomic sense - generating undreamed of new energy
from simple elements - not a soup or a stew, but a creativer explosion.

You have been making the effort, struggling on your own. But you are,
happily, surrounded by sources eager to fill your life with the real
Yiddish-keyt. Reach out for it.

Let's get away from this polarization - scholars excoriating the uninitiate
who are at least making an attempt (let's encourage, not discourage). Those
who treat Yiddish with less than the respect it deserves (substitute
knowledge for hearsay and half-truths). Those in Yiddish organizations,
stop playing games of turf definition (think Klal.)

Lernt yidish, leyent yidish, redt yidish, zingt yidish, kholemt yidish, zet

Subject: Mendele outreach program

As everybody knows, today only two relatively large groups of Yiddish-speakers 
remain in the world: those who have a computer and Internet access and those 
who don't. The best part of the first category participates in Mendele, the 
best part of the second category wants to participate, but cannot.

Now and then Mendele and Shtetl receive letters from Internet-disadvantaged
lovers of Yiddish (or even more often from their children or grandchildren).
They would love to listen and contribute to our discussions. I beleive that 
there should be ways to involve them in our virtual community. May be we can 
find volunteers to serve as human interfaces between Mendele and those who 
want to participate. They can print all (or selected) issues and mail them  
or read some postings on the phone and transmit the feedback to Mendele in the
same way. The benefit will be mutual for all the parties involved, including
Mendele at large.

Two current opportunities:

Chaim Kusnetz, Yiddishist and Talmudic scholar. Lives in Brooklyn. Published 
his first book in Yiddish in 1927. Author of two philosophical books: _A 
mentsh trakht_ and _Mentsh un mides_. Frequently contributed to several major 
Yiddish newspapers under the pen name A. Duboyer. Would like to correspond in 
Yiddish. 

Lily Dubin, former actress and singer. Lives in Florida. Would like to 
participate in Mendele.

I am sure, many Mendelists know candidates for the continuation of this list.

I hope to hear from somebody who wants to talk to Chaim Kusnetz and Lily Dubin.
I hope we can come up with the ideas for broader program of involvement for 
those who can enrich their and our lives, and who should not be prevented 
from this because they don't have computers.
