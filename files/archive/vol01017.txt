Subject: Comments on mekhutn

Mikhl Herzog's comments [Vol 1.16] are first-rate, but
i think "Vos bistu mir far a mekhutn" is better trans-
lated 'Who are you to me?'  The idea of pretense is, of
course, present, yet 'pretender' doesn't seem to be the
best gloss of _mekhutan_ in the isolated phrase -- in
certain contexts it might fit fine.  The phrase ex-
presses rejection of familiarity, closeness or intimacy
which is in some way seen as not being bona fide, i.e.
pretended, unearned, unjustified, etc.

Subject: du, ir, and regional differences

[From a letter to Noyekh Miller]
 
     Now to the exclamation marks (!). They're motivat-
ed by i) Leonard Prager's correction of your transcrip-
tion and, ii) Your expression of thanks to me the other
day. You wrote "a shaynem dank aykh". This provides me
with an excuse for both a "sociolinguistic" and a
"geolinguistic" diversion.  
Re i) "aykh":
 
     I guess that I am as "native" a speaker of Yiddish
as one born in Canada can be, apparently quite bilin-
gual from the start. I had Yiddish-speaking peers, many
of us who went through the Yiddish school system to-
gether, but we spoke only English to one another.
Hence, everyone I spoke Yiddish to addressed me with
"du" and, except for parents and their siblings, I
addressed everyone as "ir". (The associated verbs are
"dutsn" and "irtsn".)  
 
     The first time I ever remember having been ad-
dressed as "ir" --and by people of my own age and
older--is when I came to NY as a graduate student. I
always felt like looking around for the person being
addressed. I'd somehow failed to anticipate the problem
and, frankly, it disconcerted me. The problem was
further complicated when first-name relationships
developed and I found people saying "Mikhl, efsher vilt
ir . . . .".
 
     The next complication was the result of speaking
Yiddish to my students to whom I was inclinbed to say
"du" but who were entitled to "ir" if only as a lesson
in sociolinguistic correctness.
 
     Finally, I discovered that liberation could be
achieved through the simple mechanism of one of the two
parties concerned saying to the other "efsher iz shoyn
tsayt mir zoln zikh ufhern irtsn". There must be rules
about who should say it to whom, but  
I have taken the bull by the horns, as you can see from
the exclamation marks above.
 
Re ii): "a shaynem dank aykh"
 
     Notice that you've written the same vowel in the
2nd and the 4th words. That cooccurrence is SO UNLIKELY
(not impossible) that if it were truly characteristic
of your speech, I'd catch the earliest flight to Hart-
ford (?) to record you for posterity.  
The "ay" sequence is used to render the sound of the
vowel in English "bite".
 
Standard Yiddish (as well as Northeastern Yiddish and
Volhynian Yiddish) is
"a sheynem (to rhyme with English "plain") dank aykh"; 

In the Southern Ukraine: "a sheynem dank akh" (short
"a" to rhyme with "dakh");
 
Central Yiddish (Poland, etc.): "a shaynem (to ryhme,
more or less, with English "bite") dank a:kh (long a:;
i.e. as in ma:n 'my' vs short "a" in "man" 'husband').
 
There is one town in Northeastern Poland, Wyszkow, if I
recall correctly, (Yiddish Vishkeve), on record (de-
cades ago) for the cooccurence of the same vowel, "ay",
in the words represented by "sheyn" and "aykh". The
cooccurence, which would lead to such anomalous se-
quences as "a shayn vayb" ('a beautiful wife') would
have interesting implications for the relative chronol-
ogy of sound change. Do you know anyone from that town?
It's one of the dialectologist's "missing links".
