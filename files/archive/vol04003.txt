Subject: Zhid

There was an inquiry on MENDELE back in vol. 3 somewhere, concerning
usage of the Slavic "zhid."  [#221,251,257,339,340 nm] Recently, I
uncovered a footnote that cited the following articles (which I have not
read, but I pass them along for the sake of those who might wish to delve
into the matter):

Birnbaum, Henrik, "Some Problems with the Etymology and the Semantics of
the Slavic Zhid 'Jew,'" in Slavica Hierosolymitana 7 (Jerusalem, 1985),
pp. 1-11.

Klier, John, "Zhid:  Biography of a Russian Epithet," in Slavonic and
East European Review 60:1 (London, 1982), pp. 1-15.

Subject: Dina Abramowicz honored

It gives me great pleasure to convey the following news: The Public
Library Association has just announced that Dina Abramowicz, my
predecessor as head librarian of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research
and currently YIVO's reference librarian, has been awarded the 1993
Leonard Wertheimer Multilingual Public Library Service Award.  The award,
which is sponsored by the PLA and by the NTC Publishing Group, will be
presented at this year's PLC All-Star Breakfast, on Monday June 27th,
between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m., in the Fontaine Room of the Miami Beach
Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel.  (Miss Abramowicz will not be there to
receive the award in person.)

Those who know Dina Abramowicz and her work will certainly agree that the
Multilingual Public Library Service Award is one that she richly
deserves.  Miss Abramowicz personifies the very word "multilingual,"
serving as she does a variegated clientele in a range of languages,
including Yiddish, Russian, Polish, French and English.  Her career spans
the old world and the new.  A native of Vilna, she worked as a children's
librarian before World War II and in the Vilna Ghetto library, under Nazi
occupation.  She emigrated to the United States in 1946 and since 1948
has been associated with the YIVO Library (from 1962 to 1987 as its
head).

Her reputation as reference librarian par excellence is legendary. Dina
Abramowicz annually answers hundreds of letters and thousands of
telephone inquiries, in addition to dealing with hundreds of visitors to
the YIVO Library.  Though YIVO is not a public library, it is open and
available to the general public free of charge, and many readers have
gratefully acknowledged Miss Abramowicz's assistance.  As Irving Howe
wrote in his monumental study of Jewish immigration to the U.S., "World
of Our Fathers": "And then there is YIVO, that blessed repository of
Yiddish learning and historical materials, without which this book would
simply not have been possible -- especially its indefatigable and
splendid librarian, Dina Abramowich [i.e., Abramowicz]."  What Howe said
almost twenty years ago has been echoed by researchers before and since
-- right up to the present.  The PLA's recognition of this immensely
gifted and resourceful librarian bestows great honor not only on Dina
Abramowicz and the YIVO Library, but, by extension, on the glorious
civilization of Yiddish-speaking Jews in Eastern Europe.

Subject: Karl Habersaat

Leonard Prager (rhle302@haifauvm.bitnet) would appreciate biographical
information on Karl (also Carl, Carlo) Habersaat, author of about 45
bibliographical articles, mainly on Old Yiddish manuscripts.  Dina
Abramowicz seems to remember that he was a German monk.

Subject: Preglen

Leigh Lisker: Thanks for the dictionary reference. I haven't checked
Grimm yet, but the German dictionaries that I have checked, including
Kluge, have no entry for "b/pregeln". Would such an entry preclude a
Slavic source. I'd welcome whatever the Germanists can contribute to the
question.

As for the gloss 'braten', whenever I see it I want to tear my hair. So
far, it figures as 'roast', 'bake', 'grill', 'broil', and 'fry'.

What to do?

Subject: Over Botl

The phrase is a clear Hebraicism derived from the last sentence of
chapter 5 of Pirkeh Avot where the stages of life are described. The
final one is an individual of 100 years old who is "as if he were dead."
The person is "avir v'batel (= ovir botl) meen ha'olam," "passed away and
wasted/ceased from the world."  It has been a delight to follow the
imaginative discussion.

Subject: Re: Spanish-speaking Jews

Several articles in Mendele about the Jewish ship in Salonika made me
think about my own experience in high school in Chula Vista, California,
near the Mexican border south of San Diego.  The few Jewish families in
the part of town where I lived were Mexican Jews who owned businesses in
nearby Tijuana, and they all spoke Spanish, of course. The high school
was located in a part of town where other Mexicans did not live, ergo the
only Mexicans in my high school were Jewish, and the only Jews were
Mexican (except for me--I'm from Argentina).  Quite a few of the other
students at my high school were convinced that Spanish was the Jewish
language and vice versa.
