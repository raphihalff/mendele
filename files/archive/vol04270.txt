Subject: Not about splitting the list

One thought that I had while reading this discussion:  I have an amateur
interest in Yiddish linguistics, but I can't follow some of the more
technical discussion due to very technical terms.  It would be easier to
follow them if the linguists would keep in mind that others are lurking
and explain their more esoteric terms.

Subject: Splitting the list and a research query

Before I make my research query, a brief comment on Dovid Braun's and
Kathryn Hellerstein's comments on splitting the list.

I am a tenure-track asst. prof in a Germanic/Slavic dept. at a large
state university.  My research is on the cultural and literary history of
German-speaking Jewry since 1700.  I am not a professional Yiddishist,
though much of my research deals with the experiences of East European
Jews in Imperial and Weimar Germany, as well as attitudes toward the
so-called Ostjuden on the part of West/Central European Jews.  I read
Yiddish with proficiency and speak it proficiently for a person who is
near-native-fluent in German.

Enough about me, although I felt it was to reiterate my institutional,
sociocultural positions before I proceed (something few people who
contribute to Mendele ever reveal/show self-awareness of except perhaps
in initial introductions!).

My colleagues and acquaintances in Jewish studies, German studies, and
Yiddish often regard "Mendele" as not "serious" not "scholarly" enough--a
charge most of you have heard a thousand times.  This prejudice is a
prejudice, no doubt, but I would like, for a moment, to explore it
empathetically to see if it has any grounds.  While Dovid Braun is on
target that prejudices abound with respect to linguistics, Yiddish
culture, galitsyaners vs. litvaks, undundund,  my colleagues and
acquaintances, right or wrong, rational or irrational, feel that
"Mendele" doesn't "speak" to them, that is, to their concerns as
scholars/teachers.

Let me try to help the rest of you understand where I am (and they might
be) coming from:  1. Speaking for myself, a young, tenure-track
professor:  there is little incentive to contribute to/ read /"Mendele"
on purely professional (kholile!) criteria.  (These criteria are subject
to criticism, but as standards for hiring, promotion, etc. they have
been/and will be difficult to change immediately.)  At best, "Mendele"
may indirectly, in a mediated fashion, help my research and my teaching.
(No doubt it comprises "service" to the broader community.)  Like
anything else, certain people are real interested/engaged in "Mendele",
others less so; human scholars, moreover, do not share the same
priorities.  I should add at this point:  I believe that any person
researching/teaching Yiddish/Ashk. Studies is doing themselves a
disservice by NOT reading Mendele.

2.  I quote Braun:  "Halevay -- would that a professional (Yiddish)
folklorist would pipe up on this network, or a historian or a literary
scholar/theorist or a sociologist or a musicologist -- with material that
s/he would normally discuss in a serious forum with his/her colleagues --
or with lay people."  While I don't precisely fit into one of the above
categories, let me offer one possible explanation for the behavior of
such folks, again, speaking ultimately only for myself.  I, for one, get
little if any resonance from Mendeleniks when I make a research query.  I
repeat:  I get few responses, if any, most of them (pardon my netiquette,
Daniella!) "uninformed."   Over the years (someone check the archives), I
have made the 5 or 6 odd queries with similar results.  This point won't
surprise most of you:  obviously the people I talk with/would like to
talk with in my interdisciplines (why scholars talk to each other so
little is worth exploring!) aren't replying, indeed aren't participating
in "Mendele."  All of which begs the question:  why then even think of
publishing more substantial contributions on "Mendele"  (aside from the
copyright questions and the (probably unjustified) fear of plagiarism?)
In one respect, however, the lack of response is rewarding:  it confirms
for me that I may be doing original research on neglected topics.

To close: kvetching about _Mendele_ is to me tantamount to loshn hore
(which is perhaps makes griping about it so much fun for so many of us!).
There are a thousand good things to say, and it is my favorite
_discussion list_ of the several I subscribe to.  Finally, as an
anthropologically-minded cultural historian, I am envious of my
colleagues who will have "Mendele"'s archives to consult as a prooftext
for their histories of late 20th-century (primarily) American Jewry

Having talked your ears off, here's a research query for an article I
would like to write:  "For an article on precursors/antecedents  in
Central and East European Jewish culture to the "Jazz Singer"
character/narrative (remember the 1929 film with Al Jolson, based on 1923
story by Raphaelson?) , I would appreciate reading suggestions, comments,
ideas, etc.  Jazz singers, opera singers, actors--entertainers of every
stripe-- are of particular interest, especially those who emerged from a
"shtetl" environment into a more "assimilated" milieu.   Any genre
(novel, story, theater, film, memoir, autobiography) is fair game,
especially if authored in Yiddish, Hebrew, or German.
