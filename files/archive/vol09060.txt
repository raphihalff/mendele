Subject: An-ski's expedition

I recently came upon a book entitled Yiddishe Etnografiye un falklor.  It is
a record of the ethnographic expedition led by Sh. Anski in 1913, and is
written by Avraham Rechtman, who was one of the members of that
expedition.  
Apparently, this expedition collected recordings and artifacts of
extraordinary value.  I've only glanced at parts of the book.  But for
instance he recorded on phonograph a descendant of Rabbi Nachman of
Breslov
playing Rabbi Nachman's tunes on the violin, noted hundreds of stories
from
the Breslov oral tradition, collected artifacts such as the chandelier that
hung in Rabbi Nachman's private chamber, etc.

Does anyone know what happened to this wealth of material?  Does it still
exist?  Is access to it possible?  Can any of it be recovered?

Subject: Academic position and freedom of speech

In response to Majorie S. Hirshan's concern about the statements of Ruth
Wisse, Peretz Professor of Yiddish literature at Harvard University, permit
me to express as the Gale Chair of Jewish Studies at the University of
Texas
at Austin my scorn at the inquiry raising questions of fitness and
appropriateness of the occupant of the Harvard position of Yiddish
literature to express her thoughts. A Professor has every right and
intellectual freedom to raise questions and give opinions on any topic. The
competence of the individual in his or her specialty does not mean that one
is restricted to the one field of endeavor or must voice but one
"politically correct" position. Ruth Wisse is one of the most articulate
members of the Jewish diasporic community and her positions may be
accepted,
debated, or rejected but no one has a right to question her ability and
absolute right and freedom to raise issues and to choose positions whether
in cathedra or ex cathedra. This misplaced questioning of appropriateness
of
the Peretz Professor of Yiddish Literature to give her opinions on feminism
or any other topic just because she bears a title of her speciality reveals
either naivete or some personal animus. I am astonished that such a
posting
questioning the appropriateness of a Professor of Yiddish Literature at
Harvard to her opinions could appear on Mendele.

Subject: Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan's Shayle

Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan fregt a shalyle, gants ernst (9.005, 2), un fun
der shayle kumt aroys a sakh shayles.

First, the caption she quotes (under Ruth Wisse's picture in the Harvard
Magazine) relays opinions reportedly held by Ruth Wisse.  The statement
would surely warm the hearts of Phyllis Schlafly, Pat Buchanan and other
such right-wingers, a congregation overloaded with those who disparage
women, are dangerous to women (and to Jews, too, for that matter).

[A shayle, nisht gants ernst: can hearts at absolute zero Kelvin be warmed
at all?]

Second, as Peretz Professor of Yiddish literature, I agree she has a
responsibility to the name of Peretz as well as to the cause of Yiddish
literature. Disparagement of feminism probably has nothing to do with
Peretz
or with Yiddish literature.  Of course, Sholem Aleichem's Tevye (maybe
Peretz's characters as well) made disparaging remarks about women to
Golde
(a vayb iz nayn moz reyd, zol ikh trakhtn mit dayn vaybershe seykhl?), but
Sholem Aleichem only reflected the injurious prejudices prevalent in
Tevye's
time (which probably reflected the times a generation or two older than
Sholem Aleichem).  Even in Sholem Aleichem's time, married Russian
women
could not own property.

Nu, kumt aroys andere shayles, "Is Ruth Wisse reflecting something in
Yiddish literature she correctly understands or does she misunderstand?  Do
those opinions have anything at all to do with her professional work?  Do
those printed words, those off-the-wall statements, accurately depict her
state of mind?"

Everyone deserves the benefit of the doubt.  A puzzlement!

Subject: Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan's question

Marjorie Hirshan asks in re Ruth Wisse's comments on feminism, "Does
personal integrity to voice what you believe take preference over your
responsibility to a title like Peretz professor of Yiddish Literature when
your title is inextricably bound to your name?"

I believe that there may be three answers to this shayle.

First is if you are in accord with her statements then clearly integrity
requires her to state them.

Second if you disagree with her statements then she blackens her position
and title.

Clearly I believe the third choice is the best.  She has not renounced her
right, and perhaps even her duty in some cases, to express her opinion by
accepting her position and title.  At the same time she has a duty to
protect the good name of her title and position and not employ it in ways
never contemplated .  To create hostility to her POSITION by a very large
number of people does damage to the purpose for which she has been
employed.

When making statements outside of Yiddish Literature that will be offensive
to a large number of people she has the responsibility to insure that her
comments are personal an not in any way related to her position of
professor
of Yiddish Literature.

Subject: Stencl and Manger in London

Firstly, does anyone know of any English translations of AN Stencl's poetry?
Stencl was editor of Loshn un Lebn, a literary magazine published in London
for many years from 1946. Secondly, does anyone know of any material,
again
in English, about I Manger's spell in London and whether any of his poetry
was written when in London. Mit grusn.

I am interested in opinions regarding the novels of Noah Goldberg.  Also, is
anyone aware of any English translations of his novels, or how I could have
them made inexpensively?

Thanks very much.

From: Velvele@aol.com
Subject: "oser"

Geoff Nathan, in his message (Vol. 09.053), defines the word, "oser," as a
rough equivalent to "Yeah, sure."  I'm grateful to him for the information
regarding a word that I, for one, have seen only once before, in a plaintive
song in which the singer declares his preference for a decent life now,
rather than something better in the sweet bye-and-bye:

    "ikh ken dos veltl, got, dokh oser nit farshteyn,
     far yenem kleyder neyen un naket geyn aleyn.
     yene velt far dir, got,
     far mir a bisl mazl shik.
     khbin dir moykhl zibn himlen far abisl glik. . ."

>From the context I had thought the word meant something like "entirely"
or 
"altogether."
