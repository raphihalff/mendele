Subject: Medical knowledge

Jon Levitov [11.025] is skeptical about Jewish medical knowledge in 19th
century
Poland. In fact, Jewish medical knowledge was quite sophisticated. To
become
convinced of this, one need only read Moyshe Markuze's _Seyfer refues_,
('A Book
of Remedies') published in 1790 in Poryck (Yiddish _Pritsk_). My own MA
Essay (1962),
a linguistic analysis of that work is available in Butler Library at
Columbia
University, New York City. An original copy of the work itself is
available among
the rare booksat the Jewish Theological Seminary in NYC, and an enlarged
photocopy
thereof is in the library of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research.
While you're at
it, look for a work called _Der yidisher teriyak_, as well.

Happy hunting!

After a delicious meal of home-made cabbage rolls, I reflected upon the
many yiddish names for this delicacy:  holishkes, galopkes, holepkes,
prakes, galuptsi, geviklte kroyt, pireshkes (not sure of this one) - and

possibly others which Mendelyaner may report.
I am curious to know the names used for another favourite of mine: meat
balls. We called them "kulen," a name that I cannot find in the Yiddish
dictionaries and Jewish cookbooks that I consulted. Harkavy does give
"kulyes" for balls, but this is the closest I could find.  Do other
Mendelyaner know the term "kulen" for meatballs?  Can anyone speculate
on the origin of this name? And what other exotic names were used for
meatballs?  My bobe's and my mother's kulen were usually sweet-and-sour,

but sometimes were just made with the standard onion, garlic and
potatoes. [All of my grandparents and parents came from
Bessarabia/Moldova.]

Subject: shini??

Tayere Mendelyaner,

Is there anayone who knows the meaning of the 'shini' in the title
from the poem 'Shini Mayk'? in Jacob Glatsteins 'kredos' (1929).
I have found also the word in J. Opatoshus 'Fun nuyorker geto'

Subject: Introduction; Diminutive plurals

Hi everyone,

I'd like to introduce myself first, My name is Peggy Afuta, I am a phD
student in Paris, France. I study phonology and I am especially
interested in yiddish. I've learned yiddish for two years here in Paris
with Yitschok Niborski (great teacher), but I had to stop because I
couldn't attend his course anymore. No need to say that I didn't learn
enough to speak or even to understand the radio program in yiddish :) My

MA thesis was about hebrew and aramaic nouns in yiddish. I proved (at
least I hope I did) that there is a contrast of lengh in yiddish (in
vowels and consonants) in the hebrew and aramaic components of yiddish.

I am now working on my phD (under the direction of Jean Lowenstamm) and
I'd need your knowledge to help me a little bit.

I've been lurking here for a year now, looking for some phonological
interests in old volumes of Mendele, and I've found a topic I am
intested in that was debated few years ago. Many people discussed this
topic (Ellen Prince, Malkah Winters, Harry Bochner, Alexis
Manaster-Ramer,...), it all strarted with a discussion about the plural
of diminutives (-lach), like in kreplach. Some people said it comes from

russian, some said from bavarian, east franconian,. From this topic
started a second one about the diminutives that have two marks of
plural, like kinderlech, or doktoyrimlech. That's what interests me the
most. I've read here (I think it was Ellen Prince who wrote it) that the

word "kind" has no diminutive singular *kindl. I'd like to know if it is

true for all the german words that have two marks of plural for  the
diminutive plural. Does someone know words that have both diminutive
singular and diminutive plural in -erlech? Are there many word that have

two marks of plural anyway? I've read most of the articles that people
have mentionned (Perlmutter's, Chapman's,.) but they all take the same
examples, so I can really know if there are only a few words or more
than that. In fact any help on the subject would be appreciated. The
unique representation I gave to diminutives works for most of the nouns
(both bak/bekl and trerl/tretl or hon/hendl) but I am still stuck with
the kinderlech words. I am trying to find an alternative to the Split
Morphology Hypothesis (it can explain the facts in morphology, but
doesn't give any answer on a phonological level). Again, any facts,
data, or bibliographic references would be appreciated. Thank you for
your help.
