Subject: Unter Dayne Vayse Shtern

Jay Brodbar asks about a recording of "Unter Dayne Vayse Shtern."  I have a
tape of a wonderful rendition by Chava Alberstein (Khave Albershteyn).
There may be a CD of it.  I don't know.  My tape is entitled "Chava
Alberstein Sings Yiddish."  Side 2 (Program 2) begins with "Unter ...."

This is a reply to Jay Brodbar's request about a recording of "Unter dayne
vayse shtern."  I know of one version included on a tape called "Partisans
of Vilna" and available from the Workmen's Circle.  I think it also exists
on CD.

Subject: Unter Dayne Vayse Stern

I was very moved by what Jay said about Unter Dayne Vayse Shtern. I, too,
find myself crying when I hear it. I believe the version I heard was
called something like Songs from the Vilna Ghetto. The song below is on
same album.

Ellen Prince will know about the following. Perhaps one of the most
poignant versions of "S'dremlen feygl oyf di tsvaygn" is Sarah Gorby's.
My mother was transfixed! (As I made my first excursions into Yidishkayt,
my mother followed close behind me). We listened to it at Christmas
lehavdl! Bill McAuliff, du bist nisht der ershter sheygetsl do.

I was leaving it in your capable hands, actually :-).  One reason I
didn't reply is that I have no personal experience as to what Toronto was
historically vis-a-vis Yiddish.  I grew up knowing no Yiddish, and
learned it in 1977 at the age of 19.

Certainly Toronto is a very strong Yiddish-speaking community now, due
largely to the high percentage of Holocaust survivors in the community.
Also, there is a noticeable Bobov chassidic community, who use Yiddish
among themselves, and scatterings of others.  There's a strong Lubavitch
community who emphasize Yiddish but don't use it as much as one would
think; our son goes to Lubavitch cheder, where out of 15 boys in his
Grade 1 class, only he and one other actually speak Yiddish at home,
although their rebbe speaks a lot of Yiddish to them in class.  But
that's the present, not the history you were looking for.

Subject: Early morning

Responding to an inquiry about a Yiddish term for "early in the morning"
from someone who half remembered it from childhood, I found the term that
she was looking for in Stutchkoff's _Oytser..._, namely, _fortslokh_.
Stutchkoff lists it along with several other related words, all marked
"vulgar":  _fortstog_, _fortse drane_, _fortse lrane_ and
_fortsh-mortsh_. I can see why he would consider them vulgar (_forts_ is
cognate to English _fart_), and I assume that the _rane_ part is from
Russian _rano_ 'early' or Polish _rano_ '(in the) morning', but does
anyone have any thoughts about the origin of these expresssions?  Did
they perhaps start as a pun on _far tog_?

Library of Philadelphia, Yale, Montreal's Jewish Public Library, Indiana
University, University of Utah, and the Library of Congress.

Subject: Standardization

to david braun's comments:

certainly i wasn't objecting to *discussion* of either dialect
standarization, or of questions of transliteration/transcription.  i've
participated in the latter (e.g. making the suggestion that absolutely
no-one has since followed of using hh for kh). i would participate in the
former if i knew enough.  as a linguist, i just love fussing around with
the little details of language, e.g. the differences in case-system or
conjugation between yiddish and german.

i do recommend against the almost puritan tone (if that is the right
word) that i have sensed in *some* of the discussion, with the possible
implication that those who can't use YIVO standard (by which i intended
only transcription) should learn it or not write to mendele, or that
those who use some "non-standard dialect", or even worse a little yiddish
that they remember from home, should only do so with awareness of their
inadequacy.

my memo was intended to point out how varied people's attitudes are
towards variation in their own language, and that, if anything, yiddish
is *unlike* many other languages in the earnestness that *some* speakers
apply to the notion of a standard dialect.
