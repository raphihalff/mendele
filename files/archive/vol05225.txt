Subject:

The most frequent suffixes in Yiddish for feminine names formed from masculine
names -- not last names -- for the purpose of indicating women's position,
profession, or social status are -ke or -in.

Since the suffix -ke is usually the _diminutive_ of children's name (Beylke,
Leyke, Sorke;  Itske, Shleymke, Peysekhke), people often felt that when a -ke
suffix is applied to a grown-up woman, in whatever capacity, it will not only
sound diminutive but is, in some way, also lacking in respect and thus
unintentionally _diminish_ the person's worth.

Words with the -in  suffix, when compared with those ending with -ke, might be
said (paraphrasing an expression coined by the famous poet and Bible
translator Yehyosh) to wear top hats ["trogn tsilinders"].  Thus "Lererin" is
considered more formal than "lererke," and, it is felt, carries more respect.

As I had occasion to state some time ago on the pp. of Mendele, this was the
psychological reason for innovating the _augmentative_ feminine names Male and
Rive since in their original Hebrew-Yiddish, the names MalKE and RivKE sound
as if they were Yiddish diminutives.

Occasionally, but _not_ always, the -ke suffix serves to indicate a marital
relationship, for instance:  Shnayderke, the wife of a tailor;  shusterke, the
wife of a cobbler.  In many other cases, it might just indicate an independent
position or profession.  In the case of the just mentioned "shnayderke," it
would be more accurate to call her "shnayderin" if she is a tailor in her own
right, or "neytorin" (from "neyen," to sew).

There are several more suffixes serving the same purpose, in addition to -ke
and -in, such as -te,  -she, -tsin, -etsin, and some others.

Herewith a short random list of Yiddish feminine names of professions or
social status:

1.  Artistin, artistke;
2.  Arbetorin, arbeterke (worker);
3.  Birgerin (citizen);
4.  Delegatin (delegate), also delegatke;  [Beware of the plural "delegatkes"
    on account of the last two syllables, since "gatkes" are Yiddish for men's
    underwear, and might result in a howling audience response.]
5.  Gabete (wife of a gabe (giml, beys, alef, yud), synagogue trustee; [Also
    ironically a woman who by "self-appointment" takes over things and starts
    acting with khutspe in an uninvited supervisory capacity ]
6.  Grafine (countess);
7.  Doktorke (woman physician); [Note:  "Doktorshe" is the wife of a male
    physician.]
8.  Mendelyanerin (a khaverte or khavertorin of the Mendele khavruse);
9.  Mitgliderin (member);
10. Rabinerke (female reform rabbi);  [May evolve later, upon greater public
    acceptance, into rabinerin.]
11. Rebetsin (wife of a rabbi);
12. Shameste (wife of a shames);
13. Shilerin (pupil in a Yiddish secular school).

With reference to the suffix -etsin (No. 11 above) I found an interesting
exchange about one single word in Esperanto and its possible connection to the
Yiddish "rebetsin" (_Yidishe Shprakh_, YIVO journal for the problems of
standard Yiddish [klal shprakh], Vol. VIII, No 3, pp. 79-82, Dec. 1958).

All words in Esperanto are readily traceable to their various linguistic
roots, except the suffix -edzin that signifies a married woman.

The editor of the journal, the late Yudl Mark, posited with much certainty
that Zamenhof took the Yiddish "rebetsin" as a matrix for his coinage.

As is well known Zamenhof loved Yiddish, wrote about the need to simplify its
spelling, to rid it from superfluous ayens and shtume [silent] alefs.  He also
composed a grammar of Yiddish.

It is of special interest that he suggested to start writing Yiddish in the
Latin alphabet, and that in some measure Mendele does it in its romanized
Yiddish posts.

Subject: Haredi Yiddish and Rav Shach

I somehow messed up my message on this subject, and only the last sentence got
through.  I'm sorry for the confusion, and apologize to the shames for the
extra work.

I enjoyed Henekh Coleman's informative report on Haredi Yiddish.  I can add a
bit about Rav Shach.  In 1990 I recorded from the TV his famous speech on
national politics.  While it was predominantly in Hebrew, a number of times he
inadvertently reverted to Yiddish, for several minutes at a time.  (This is
based on my 5-year-old memory.) His Hebrew sounds like Yiddish, in its
phonology, some of the syntax, and vocabulary and idiomatic usages.  To most
Israelis it would sound outlandish.  It's not at all like the Hebrew one hears
from younger people in Haredi neighborhoods in Jerusalem, which is exactly
like the Hebrew of other Israelis, aside from terms relating to their
particular culture which they might borrow from Yiddish.  If anyone is
interested, I'll listed again to my recording and be able to give you more
information.  I'd also be willing to send a copy of the recording.
