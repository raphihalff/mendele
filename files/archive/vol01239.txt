Subject: Only one Kindervelt

It's a good thing for me that cyberspace is monochromatic;
otherwise all would be treated to my blush of embarassment
at having forgotten the Farband sponsor- ship of Unser
Camp-Kindervelt.  Of course they were Labor-Zionist.  I've
moved through the left political spectrum since then, but
when scratched I still bleed Labor-Zionist, to the mild
bewilderment of my wife who was a red diaper baby of the
purest hue.  (Reading over my shoulder, Naomi says after
forty years she is no longer embarassed by my peculiar
background.)
 
At one time I really knew the political declension of the
Kinder-camps:
 
Kindervelt = Farband
Kinderland = IWO
Kinderring = Workman's Circle
 
Were there others?
 
I confess that my Yiddish is not up to fully understanding
Elyet Gertl's comment in Yiddish.  If anyone's keeping
track I was at Kindervelt every year between 1931-1936;
that is between ages seven and twelve.  Sometimes I was
there the whole two month season, occasionally only for
half a season, which I knew even then to have been a
consequence of the depression.

Subject: Yiddishization of English

Eli Katz's Yiddish version of "Hold the Fort" includes an
interesting line: "Yunyenlayt in krig."  The last word I
understand to be originally German; what about the first
word?  It looks to me like a Yiddish version of the English
"union men," combining an English word with a generalizing
term, -layt.  Am I reading this correctly?

Subject: Vider amol *Der Internatsional*

A dank aykh, Mikhl Herzog, Eli Katz, un Bob Rothstein, for
the words to The Internationale in Yiddish.  May I now ask
for some help in parsing and translating the first two
lines?

The three versions differ a bit in punctuation:

MH:  Shteyt oyf ir ale, ver vi shklafn
     in hunger lebn muz, un noyt ...

EK:  Shteyt oyf ir ale ver vi shklafn
     In hunger lebn, muz un noyt.

BR:  Shteyt oyf, ir ale ver vi shklafn In hunger lebn muz
un noyt!

I think my problem is with *muz*.  Is it a noun?  A verb
(if so, it doesn't seem to agree in number with *ir ale*)?
In any case, how would these lines be translated?

Many thanks.

Seymour (Shloyme) Axelrod

Subject: Yiddish vaudeville query

        The song that Cal Pryluck asked about can be found
in Chana (Eleanor Gordon) Mlotek's _Mir trogn a gezang_,
which is avail- able from the Arbeter Ring.  Chana Mlotek
refers to it as a "folk song, parts of which were published
by Y. L. Cahan in 1912."  The first stanza "was traced to
the 16th century" by Cahan.  The text is as follows:

        Shvartse karshelekh rayst men,
        Un grine lozt men shteyn;
        Sheyne meydelekh nemt men
        Un miese lozt men geyn.

                Oy, vey iz tsu mir,
                Un vey tsu mayne por yor,
                A libe hob ikh gefirt
                Felike dray fertl yor.

        Vos toyg mir di polke mazurke,
        Az tantsn tants ikh zi nit,
        Vos toyg mir dos meydele fun vurke
        Az libn libt zi mikh nit.

        Vos toyg mir der nayer valets
        Az tantsn tants ikh im nisht,
        Vos toyg mir dos meydele fun shilets,
        Az libn libt zi mikh nisht.

Maybe I'll partially answer my own question.  Although my
"matzo-brau" comes through my non-Yiddish speaking parents,
who were born in England and whose grandparents (not
parents) were from Poland & Ukraine, I can look instead to
my adopted (through my wife) Yiddish of Staszow (Stashiv).
"ay", as we all know, is pronounced "aa" in that dialect
(a.k.a. southern Yiddish, right Mikhl?).  So my guess is
that it went bray->braa->brau over the years.

Comments?
