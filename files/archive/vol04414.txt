I teach English at Dawson College in Montreal, including a course in
Jewish Literature. My class list includes three Jewish students, three
Muslims, one Greek, one wasp, one Quebecoise (my A plus student) and four
Chinese (one of whom aggressively wants to know why I don't accept his
saviour -- I don't suppose he means the Buddha) and all of whom are
convinced Jews have a strong sense of family, are devoted to their
ancestors and are, to a man, fabulously wealthy, oyf mir gezugt gevorn.

Subject: A shaggy dog story

As the El-Al airplane lifted off with a full complement of passengers
from the Kennedy airport tarmac in New York on its direct flight to Tel
Aviv, Israel, a steward walked slowly between the isles to check if
everyone was properly belted in his seat.

When he saw a lady passenger with a basket in her lap, he asked her what
was in it.

"It's my dog," she said sadly.

"Sorry, Madam," the steward said, "it's against regulations to carry
animals in the passenger compartment."  He strongly urged her to give him
the basket to be placed in the cargo section of the plane, reassuring her
again and again that it will be safe.  "We have lots of experience in
dealing with this type of cargo," he said.

After much hesitation and against her better judgment, she handed him her
precious bundle.

When the airplane landed safely at its destination, the steward decided
to personally check the lady's basket, to see how it negotiated the trip.

Upon opening the basket, he found that the dog was dead.

Perplexed by the strange circumstance, he promptly made a Polaroid color
picture of the dead dog, faxed it to the next pet shop in town,
explaining the emergency nature of the request and pleaded for a live
replacement of the same breed, color, size, and approximate age.  All
this was satisfactorily completed in a an amazingly rapid sequence, in
time for the owner to claim her belongings.

When she looked into the basket, she exclaimed with vehemence:  "This is
not my dog!"

The steward, bewildered, said to her:  "What do you mean 'It's not your
dog,' look how frisky it is!"

"Don't tell me frisky-prisky," she angrily retorted.  She became very
emotional, started to cry, and poured out her heart in Yiddish:

"Mayn tayerer hunt, aza zise neshome!  Kh'hob im tsugezogt az ven di
tsayt vet kumen, vel ikh im breyngen tsu kvure inem heylikn land..."

The steward, who unfortunately didn't understand Yiddish, looked even
more bewildered.  So she said to him:  "Don't you see, my dog was dead,
and I was bringing it to Israel for burial"...

Subject: Misha Aleksandrovitsh

I noticed the announcement in Mendele 4.413 of a concert in Boston where
Misha A. will be performing. A couple of weeks ago I noticed everybody
was posting the version they liked best of "Leyg dayn kop af mayne kni".
I didn't want to do it to death, so I let it go. But now I'll say, It's
really a beautiful version (but I'll spare everyone the transcription).

I learned Yiddish beginning at age 14, a non-Jew who knew nothing from
dialects; I naively thought everyone spoke the Klal-Shprakh. Very
coinciden- tally the first Yiddish albums I bought (Nekhame Lifshits
among them) all used the klal-shprakh. So it wasn't till I bought a
spoken recording of I.B. Singer (and I swear I couldn't understand a
word!) that I learned there were other pronunciations. Since then (and
this has a point, just bear with me) I got all engrossed in Yiddish
theater and music, most of which uses a South-Eastern-based
pronunciation, and I learned to speak both ways.

Misha uses the klal-shprakh, and the lyrics and the pronunciation only
enhance a certain refinement or "classicality" of his singing. He does a
beautiful rendition also of "Moyshele mayn fraynd". Go hear him! It's
eynmol an experience of a lifetime! Now, please don't flame me for saying
that the only truly aesthetically pleasing pronunciation is the
klal-shrakh (kholile!) It's just that I agree with something Zellig Bach
said a long time ago about having a standard language, even if it's no
one's native speech. It elevates a language, giving it norms for
expressing complex thought. I read a fascinating book published by YIVO
on Romanian Jewry. It was a real aesthetic experience, each word
carefully and lovingly chosen for nuance, and a regula- rity that
transcended to the sublime in its rejection of German influence (e.g.
grupes instead of grupn). I feel like Molly Picon, all of a sudden, "Oh
boy, am I getting carried away! Listen to me!") I'll say GO,
gezunterheyt!

Subject: A mi(e)se mise

Louis Fridlander is right to distinguish _mise_ 'death' [mem-yud-
sof-hey], as in _mise meshune_, from the inflected adjective _mi(e)se_
'ugly (plural)' from _mies_ [mem-yud-alef-vov-samekh].

Apparently Mr. Fridlander isn't aware that, in German, the latter is a
borrowing from Yiddish (of Hebrew origin)--only one of many whose origin
is obscure to most speakers of German.

Subject: Tzie tut [a lidl]

The following (very beautiful) song caused endless controversy among
Yiddish choir members who clearly need a gloss from a student of Yiddish
with a joint major in gematria and ethnomusicology. I present it as it
appears on our handwritten (no one knows by whom) song sheet, though
without repeats. I defer my own opinion, which did not meet with general
agreement, despite its obvious correctness.

Tzie tut kravitz mieshka

Rebbenyu! Vos iz mein kind?
Oy rebbenyu er hot gezogt "Zie."
"Zie" iz a heiliger vort
"Zie" iz b'gematrio
kof aleph p'omim

Subject: Translation queries

I am busy with some large translation projects, so with the permission of
the shames, gezunt un shtark zol er zayn, I will from time to time send
out appeals to learned khaveyrim for help with problems.

To start with, can someone advise on a good English rendering of the
phrase *mit lib aykh ayer gast* said to someone on the new arrival of
family from the Old Home.

Second, does anyone know what are *alfonzes*  -- a word not to be found
either in Weinreich or in Harkavy. Is it a South Africanism? (though I
have no idea what it means)

I'll await help soonest. A hartsikn dank tsu ale.
