Subject: Nomberg's tsvishn berg

In response to the criticism of my translation of Nomberg's "In the Mountains"
(published in the current issue of DER PAKNTREGER), I feel that the complaint
was based on an inadequate knowledge of German, which, for better or worse,
supplies a large portion of the vocabulary in Nomberg's Yiddish style.  Louis
Fridhandler objected to my rendering the word "widrig" (a perfect example of
daytshmerish) as "repulsive"--but that is exactly what it means.  I've been
speaking German all my life and I've been using the adjective "widrig" to mean
"repulsive" (among other things) all my life.  According to my Muret-Sanders
German-English dictionary, "widrig" can also mean "widerwaertig", which
likewise means "repulsive."  As I've said before:  if you can lift a
dictionary with one hand, then it's not very useful for serious scholarship. 
If L. F. ever knows German as well as I and my dictionary do, then his carping
might be taken seriously. 

As for translating "Indyaner" as "primitive tribesman":  we sophisticates may
not regard Amerindians as primitive.  But both Nomberg and his characters
do--and in order to get that sneering arrogance across, I felt that "primitive
tribesman" had the same impact today that "Indyaner" had in Yiddish nearly a
century ago.  The character in question regards Schwarzwald as a bizarre
creature to be looked at through the eyes of imperialistic anthropology. 

Incidentally, Nomberg's use of "Indyaner" to mean an Amerindian doesn't prove
anything about its meaning in other contexts and other writers. 

As for using the original Germanified spelling of the story in the magazine: 
why not?  Its inautheticity is part of its historical authenticity.  (Try
reading even more flagrant texts like the early books of A.M. Fuks.

Subject: Buryn and Wolf on davenen

Mr. Buryn is wrong to imply that I am sugesting "that the non-linguist is not
allowed to ask such stupid questions".  My point was rather that up till now
he and other amateur etymologists were not asking anything, but rather
propounding dogmas ex cathedra.  As for the specifics, it is certainly true
that Standard Yiddish oy can corespond to Standard German au, but it simply is
not the case that Middle High German oe or o" (as in doenen, do"nen 'to sing')
corresponds to Yiddish ave, as it would have to if davenen were to come from
this word.  As has been known for around a century, MHG oe or o" corresponds
to Standard Yiddish e or ey (I wont go into the rules for when we get e vs.
ey).  I am not sure why Mr. Buryn also wants to derive d from t, but that also
will not work.  There are certain cases of Yiddish that come from d, under
rules which I dont think have ever been stated in the literature on Yiddish (i
mean words like taytsh, taytn, etc.).  But this has no relevance to the
question of davenen.  So the point is that davenen cannot be derived from
doenen no matter how much one wishes to be so derived. So, questions are
certainly welcome and in this case are easily answered. 

As for Meyer Wolf's coments, they are mostly correct, except that he seems to
be implying that I did not know of Weinreich's refernce to the da:bab
etymology as being mention in Landua'sletter to him, but it was in fact me
that posted that information on Mendele some time ago.  Also, I think it is
going a bit far to say that the Hebrew data do not show any traces of the
sense 'pray' for this word.  It still remains to be worked out just what the
Hebrew facts were in early medieval times--and I cannot do this in my present
state of health, but I must assume that the 6th cent. example cited by
Philologos is not made up.

Subject: "Fonye"

"Fonye" was used as a generic for a Gentile male.  "Janek" was often used in
Poland.  "Fonye" was also used to denote the police, other authorities or "the
man" (as employed in Afro-American/hipster argot).

Subject: Organizational Co-operation

In Vol. 07.114 our remarkable, new shames suggests that we bury the hatchet in
our differences in our opinions as to the status, nature and future of Yiddish. 
omeyn! 

It is also time that we begin to realize that the few remaining Yiddish
organizations and publications learn to cooperate and not feel that we all
need to go after that small piece of pie. Some budgets run into the millions
while others run well under $10,000 a year. 

Several groups are very caring, giving and sharing. While others hold onto
their ever- shrinking domain. It is interesting to note that some, who are
most willing to give, are the ones who seem to be growing the most. 

A careful analogy to the Microsoft situation shows how important it is to have
both a giant and yet foster the small upstart innovative groups. Be sure to
read the recent article on Microsoft in Fortune magazine. 

Co-operation is the basis of success.

Here are suggestions, that have been touted, which will foster this
brotherliness/sisterliness and co-operation. 

Let us all publicize each other 's wonderful events.
Let us all publicize each other's wonderful CDs and cassettes.
Let us all publicize each other 's wonderful publications.

If each person in a Yiddish group purchased or subscribed to a different
publication, then at the meetings reports could be give. This would bring in
new material, and a lending library could be started. 

Some of us have beautiful quarters while others work out of tiny offices or
even out of our homes. Some of us need large benefactors. and are able to name
sections in someone's memory. Others are able only to mention names in a
publication. Each is important, and must be nurtured. Each is needed, and
serves a function. Some serve a small geographic territory, and others fulfil
minor functions for which the larger ones can't afford to allocate time and
funds. Many are volunteers, willingly work, and wish only to cover
out-of-pocket expenses. 

Again we should all commend Iosif for bringing up this topic. Mendele has a
bright future. From Sherman to Miller to Vaisman, we keep on getting bigger
and bigger.

Subject: Frankenstein on dav(e)nen

Reuven Frankenstein writes: "a) Siegmund A. Wolf cites Gottfried Seligs
Lehrbuch der juedischdeut- schen Sprache, Leipzig 1792, whre the word is
written DAFNEN. This would support the etymology from the hebrew DAF (= page),
which is also a yiddish synonym for "blat" (of Talmud or Siddur).  b) In his
shortly before Nazi occupation in Paris 1939-40 published "Milon Idi-ivri
male" A B K (Imprimerie L. Beresniak)  gives besides the english "dawn" for
shakhris also the rather possible French "service divin" = tefila le-Elohim
ve-asu bekitsur mehamila hashniya "divin"  poal "davenen".  c) Still I plead
for the Hebrew verb DVV - davov, perhaps in coincidence with one of the above
etymologies. "

Re (a), this fact is known, but there is still no other example of Hebrew /f/
becoming Yiddish /v/ in this sort of situation, and the likeliest explantion
here is Mikhl Herzog's, viz., that Selig wrote the word according to what HE
thought the etymology to be rather than according to its true sound.  I belive
there are other examples of such pseudoetymological spellings in Yiddish. 

Re (b), how does Mr. Frankenstein propose to account for the change from
French /i/ to Yiddish /a/?  As for English dawn, this etymology was clearly
proposed by somebody (I used to remmeber who but now forget) who thought that
English dawn is pronounced /davn/ rather than /do:n/.  Plus there are no
English borrowings in pre-19th century Yiddish. 

Re (c), while I favor this same etymology, what we need are arguments or data
that would help us plug up the holes, as I have mentioned before, not merely
to cast a vote.

Subject: Fonye

Nadia Paladini asks about where Fonye comes from (07.115). Fonye was a
derogatory term for the Tsar of Russia.. the Tsar's "Chappers"  (grabbers)
went into YIddish shtetlach and into villages and "chapped" yiddish boys into
the army for decades..therefore the tsars policies were a terror .

"fonye" was the reference to the tsar.. in the duet song (entitled "Yoshke
fort avek") between a betrothed and her young man who is being taken into the
tsarist army .  She sings" that he is going off to serve fonye..  and she is
weeping.."du forst avek fonye dinen vest in mir fargesn"  and ..the soldier-
to- be reassures her: 

Klug zhe nisht und vaynt zhe nisht, 
siz alsding blote,
Ich vel zayn bei fonye, 
der shentste in der rote

(Dont wail and carry on so, i will be the handsomest one in the tsar's forces!)
i love this duet because it mixes RUssian and Yiddish words so much and is
essentially a humorous song.

for example, when the maiden sings:
koif mir nit keyn oyringlach and und mach mir nit shayn
koif di a por shtivelach ( boots)
Tsum  priziv ( russian for the army) darfst du gayn.

 the chorus goes:
 oy oy oy oy yoshke fort avek
 noch a kush und noch a kush
 der poezd ( train in Russian ) gayt avek

and she also sings: oy vay mamenyu
es chapt mir on a shrek...
Lomir zich gezeygenen
der poezd gayt avek.

In any case, this is a wonderful YIddish folksong that uses the word
Fonye that you asked about.!

Ich vuntch  a gute Channukah tsu  alemen!.

Subject: a bisl vayter mit davnen

As Manaster Ramer said "for the hundreth time" it has been PROVEN that doynen
and davnen are not related. Unfortunately he has never presented the proof. We
are expected to take it on faith because apparantly it is much too subtle and
complicated for amateurs to follow. Wouldn't it be much easier and more
efficient to present the argument for evaluation instead of asserting ones
professional authority to be accepted on faith.  Much narishkayt has often
tried to survive by employing such a defense. 

My naive question is that since we know that zoyer and zover are intimately
related why or how can it be PROVEN that doynen and davnen can not be? Also I
ask only for a relationship, not a direction. Surely we know of many Yiddish
(Hebrew rooted) words that have entered into German (e.g. ganif).  We even
know of more farfetched apparant relationships, such as derek and daroga,
where it is not clear how such a relationship came about. 

Please, more content and less vituperation would be more helpful

Subject: Shteeble

Someone told me that Jay Diamond on WEVD radio explained the derivation of the
word Shteeble for synangogue as the following:

That the Jewish religion, as opposed to others, is not practiced with cold-
hearted pomp and grandeur but rather with simplicity, warmth and heymishkeyt. 
The Shteeble is not a stately building with magnificent artwork and stained
glass etc.  Hence, the word Shteeble; as derived from the english word stable. 
Ad Kahn. 

I would like to note again that this is second hand and might not be what he
indeed said.  But I would like to know if anyone knows anything concrete to
support or to reject this notion.

My personal feeling was that this is ridiculous and blatant am haaratzes but I
would like to hear Mendele's responses.
