Subject: "Yiddish in Canada" numbers from Canadian Jewish News article

A few observations on the CJN article with statistics of Yiddish in Canada: 

First, the 1996 "5-year" census isn't a full census like the 19x1 10-year
censuses. If I remember correctly, only a small percentage of people are
asked to fill in the detailed questionnaire regarding such things as home
language. This increases the possibility of error in either direction. For
example, if our family was sent the "long form" in 1996 (I honestly don't
remember whether we were, but I don't think so), we'd have reported 4 native
Yiddish speakers using the language at home who were under the age of 13 --
and once that gets multiplied by the selection rate, there's a potential for
a large impact of a skewed sample when the gross numbers are so small. (I'll
leave it to the statisticians to tell us how large.) 

Secondly, Prof. Davids supporting conclusions didn't mention a couple of
things. Toronto has a very large "black-hat" (or "ultra-Orthodox") 
community, but relatively speaking it's a less Yiddish-using community, in
terms of young people, than Montreal. This is clearly reflected in the
statistics re young people. For example, Toronto has a large Lubavitch
community, but it is almost entirely English-speaking; our son attended the
Lubavitch cheder for a couple of years, and he was one of only 2 boys in a
class of about 13 who actually used Yiddish at home. I think Bobov is the
only large community that actually uses Yiddish in daily life with kids; it's
certainly not used in the playground at Yesodei HaTorah (the general
black-hat boys' school) as far as I know.  Montreal has larger and
longer-established Chassidic communities that continue to use Yiddish, as the
statistics showed. 

Finally, Toronto has a very high population of Holocaust survivors -- the
Toronto Jewish community is very largely a post-war immigrant community. This
explains the large percentage of seniors, without telling us much about the
younger Yiddish-speaking population. Indeed, anyone wanting to do research
today that involves listening to native-Europe spoken Yiddish (from Poland,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, ...)  should go to Earl Bales Park in Toronto
(outside in good weather, inside the building in bad weather) and hang around
the card tables. But do it soon ... the average age there is around 80. (We
often leave one of our kids (age range 7-14) there for the day with my
in-laws, and the people there LOVE them because they're fluent in Yiddish.)

Subject: Afrikaner-Amerikaner

In reply to Robert Shapiro's letter [08.021]:

The "mispronounciation of the the word "shvartzeh" was merely usage by people
unaware of the use of noun genders:  Shvartzeh=female; Shvartzer=male.  This
was misused so often that "Shartzeh became a unisex noun.

"Khoyshedikeh"  from the Hebrew "khoshekh" or dark later became "shokher" -
also a prejorative term.

"Grineh"  was never (at least in my experience) use to describe black people,
but rather other Jews who had just arrived from Europe ("My Grineh Kusineh")
or those Jews who never quite became Americanized.

One additional note:  My mother's brothers often called her "shvartzeh"
because of her deep olive complexion.  Also not particularly nice, but Mom
never was offended by it.

p.s.  Sorry, I misread the opening paragraph re: shvartzer/shva-tze.  I
believe that the use of the tern "Shva-tze" is a New York-ese affectation. 
(No intention of the prejorative use of "Newyorkese" .... at least I don't
think so.)

Subject: shvartze

The original question concerned use of the term "shvatrze" by English
speakers. I find it impossible to contrive a situation in which English
speakers would resort to use of "shvartze(r)" in referring to a dark skinned
person except as a pejorative, whether the person referred to is within
earshot or not. But in Yiddish, the context is everything. "a shvartz
khaynifdike" is clearly an innocent usage. But "bahalt dus gelt ven di
shvartze kumt pitsn di fenster" is surely a horse of a different color.

Subject: Neutral Yiddish words turn pejorative in English

Summoning my muse of gut feelings and calling upon decades of listening for
nuances in speech, I stand with Rick Turkel in his statement that in Yiddish
the word shvartse/r is neutral, but turns pejorative in English usage. 

I propose other descriptive nouns like _goy_ and _shikse_, and deem them to
be neutral in Yiddish, but charged with negative emotion in English. In
Yiddish a goy is a gentile, somebody who is not Jewish. I remember how
naieve, how unangry, how lacking in sophistication we were, as we held the
shule songbook in our chubby fists and innocently sang the politically
incorrect song, Shiker iz a goy, shiker iz er, trinkn miz er, vayl er iz a
goy. Not a Jew velkher geyt in shul arayn un iz lernen. 

In English, however, a goy is an enemy, someone to be put down or scorned.. 

Ditto for usages of shikse.

Subject: farplasterd

Regarding the question by Tony Michels:  The word "farplasterd "I believe
means bandaged. The word "rak "which precedes it is the Hebrew word which
means "only". When I lived in Israel I remember that the word for bandage or
bandaid that was used was a "plaster".  Hope this helps.

Subject: vos heyst farplastern?

Without any actual knowledge to support me ;-), I would suggest that
"farplastern" means "to put on a plaster".  A "plaster" is defined in my
(English) dictionary as "a pasty preparation spread on cloth and applied to
the body, used medicinally as a curative or irritant".

It fits the context and fits linguistically.
