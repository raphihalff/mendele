Subject: Grammar Questions

I'm so confused! 

Why is "Ikh bin moykhl" in the past tense "Ikh hob moyhkl
geven" instead of "Ikh bin moykhl geven"?

Stated differently, one would think that the past of
"moykhl zayn" would be "moykhl + past-tense(zayn)". But not
so according to Weinreich, page 322 (see also the
incomprehensible footnote). Can someone tell me why?

Many thanks,

Do you remember from Hebrew School the famous begad kefat
letters? Those that sometimes have a dagesh and sometimes
don't? And the pronunciation varies accordingly: b-v, g-gh,
d-dh, k-kh, p-f, t-th. These all appear in the Masoretic
Bible (i.e. the regular Hebrew Bible that is equipped with
vowels, cantillation marks, and other goodies) These signs
are a proof of the variations in pronunciation: following a
vowel the dagesh is dropped. The g-gh, d-dh got forgotten
almost everywhere, (Yemenite Jews are supposed to having
preserved them). The other three (b,p,k)  are kept
everywhere, and the t-th is our topic. It was authentic in
9th c. Palestine, while it probably never developed in
Babel, or later in Sefarad. Under the influence of
Palestinian Jewry, Ashkenazi Jews had it from the earliest
times on. And as Ms. Prince correctly points out, the /th\
became /s\. Not only in the fem. plural (sukkes, shayles,
teshuves), but also in nakhas, mise (!), and so on. It is
easy to prove its existence from 2-300 years ago in
Hebrew/Yiddish texts that were transcribed into German
script. But I tend to think, that the th > s shift happened
much earlier.

Subject:  Lachoudisch

Some weeks ago there was discussion on MENDELE regarding
Lachoudisch.  Since I am a bibliographer and not a
linguist, I will confine myself to mention of two books --
one of which has crossed my desk this week and one which I
have not seen -- that may shed light on the subject. Moshe
Klein, the author of the newly published collection of
essays, "Oyfkum un antviklung fun yidish un fun der yidish-
literatur bizn mitn 19tn yorhundert; algemeyne shtrikhn"
(Tel Aviv:  I. L. Peretz, 1991), has a chapter, "Yidish - a
'geheymshprakh'?" (pp. 32-35), in which Lachoudisch is
discussed.  He also cites the following book (which, alas,
we do not have at YIVO):  "Lachoudisch:  Geheimsprache
Schopflochs," by K. Philipp (Dinkelsbuehl:  Verlag C. W.
Wenng, [year?]).  Klein reproduces an excerpt from
Philipp's book that is in Lachoudisch, "A klaner Schmues af
Lachoudisch," in which Heiner and Fritz discuss the sale of
an old cow and a pig.  He also includes samples from
Philipp's glossary (not directly connected to Heiner's and
Fritz's Schmues) in which Yiddish elements in Lachoudisch,
e.g., acheln, allemoel, dalles, behejme, are given German
definitions.  Klein describes Lachoudisch as follows:
"Lachoudisch... which was used in Germany in the village of
Schopfloch, near the border of Swabia. Cattle-dealers
employed that language, which is now dead.  The word
Lachoudisch purportedly derives from the word "loshn-
koydesh."  The German linguist Siegmund Wolf, author of the
"Juedisches Woerterbuch," believes that Lachoudisch was
influenced by Yiddish, which he regards as "a language
museum of corrupted Hebrew and various German dialects."
Lachoudisch, in other words, is not a secret Jewish
language, but rather, Yiddish influenced it.  It is highly
doubtful whether the cattle-dealers were Jews, because at
that time Jews did not deal in pigs and certainly did not
slaughter them, as is mentioned in 'A klaner Schmues af
Lachoudisch'."

Subject: yiddish folksongs

Recently I bought Volume four of The Anthology of
Yiddish Folksongs, a publication from The Hebrew
University of Jerusalem (Magnes Press).

Now I'm looking desperately for Volumes 1,2 & 3
which are, so it seems, not available here in 
Holland.

Is there anybody out there who knows how and where
I could find them ? 

Thanks in advance,

Shalom,

Mischa van Vlaardingen
