Subject: Afn Shvel, Forward

Some related questions, and one not.

1.  In *Afn Shvel* No. 287-288, July-December 1992, a harsh
review by M.B.B. (mem-beys-beys) of a transliterated
Yiddish-English dictionary begins with a familiar
expression: "Leygt zikh nisht kayn feygelekh in buzem!"
What does this mean?

2.  Later, the reviewer criticizes the transcription:  "Di
transkriptsie?  Zi toyg af 'tish-un-nayntsik' (oder:
[tof-shin-ayin-hey]-nayntsik)..."  From the context, it's
clearly no compliment--but what does it mean?  There
appears to be a pun on "tish" and "[tof-shin-ayin-hey]",
ayo?

3.  The authoritative (and acerbic) tone of the review
reminds makes me suspect that M.B.B. is Mordkhe Schaechter.
Can anyone on MENDELE confirm or deny?

4.  Unrelated:  Who does Philologos in the English
*Forward*?  Is it a MENDELEnik?  (Or -nitse?)

and adds the speculation,

>[Hence "af kest"?]

I do not think that af kest, meaning board [as in room and
...] is of that origin, but I am not sure what the origin
was.

When my friend was asked by a Mea Sh'arim dweller how a
good Jewish boy got to University, my friend explained that
he had gotten a "stipendia."  This appeared unfamiliar to
the questioner so my friend went on to explain that it
meant af kest without getting married, a concept that could
be comprehended as kest was one of the awards a rich man
gave his new son-in-law, board without having to work so he
could devote himself to study of Torah [meaning g'mora].

[Beatrice Santorini is not responsible for that parenthetic
remark: I am.  I had "pencilled in" the remark as a
reminder to look into the matter.  I did and decided not to
use it.  Then I forgot and left it standing.  My apologies
to all and particularly to Beatrice. nm]

Subject: Buried dogs

The dog is buried not only in Hebrew and Yiddish, but also
in Polish (tu jest pies pogrzebany), Russian (vot gde
sobaka zaryta), Slovak (tu je pes zakopany), etc.  But the
source is usually assumed to be German (da/hier liegt der
Hund begraben).  Keith Spalding's _An Historical Dictionary
of German Figurative Usage_ (Oxford:  Blackwell, 1959--),
s.v. _begraben_, lists various old attestations and some
theories of origin, including the notion that "dog" really
means "treasure," since "it is believed that the hound of
hell [_der Hoellenhund_, Cerberus] guards hidden
treasures."
