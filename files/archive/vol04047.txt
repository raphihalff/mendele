Subject: Introduction

  My name is Evelyn (Evalah). I am originally from N.J, now retired and
living in Fla., with my husband, Marty.  Today we are celebrating our 51st
wedding anniversary.

  I belong to a small Yiddish group in the development where we live, and
enjoy, and am very interested in, anything pertaining to the yiddish
language, and to what is happening to the Jewish people all over the world.

Am looking forward, with pleasure, to joining this group.  Thank you for
inviting me.

A gute nacht.

Evalah and Moishe Fein

Subject: Introduction

I learned most of my Yiddish from singing Yiddish songs. But I also heard
Yiddish at home (my father's side of the family) although it was mixed
with Viennese German (my mother's side).  I was born in Vienna, German
was my first language but since I was a baby when we made it out in 1939,
my knowledge of it was limited until I went back to Vienna to study in
the mid-sixties.  My father came from Lvov (he always called it Lemberg).
I understand spoken Yiddish and can usually make myself understood in a
kind of "vardaytchtes Yiddish."  I'm working on a project of
transcribing, and eventually translating hundreds of family letters from
Vienna, Israel, Italy and Lvov (1914-1947); they're mostly written in
German but some are in Yiddish and Polish.  I haven't dealt with those
yet.

I've been enjoying the conversations here, especially the transliterated
Yiddish and derivations of Yiddish expressions.

Subject: Dual forms in Yiddish; Toronto Conference

1) Features of the dual forms

Arre Komar, Yude Rozof, et al

Many, many months ago, (perhaps in a message to Eli Katz), I posted a
long piece on the "ets, enk" phenomenon, generally characteristic of
Yiddidh in Poland, to the West of Warsaw. Although it is, indeed,
geographically contiguous with the German speaking area in which these
features prevail, one should be very cautious about using this as
evidence for the "true birthplace" of Yiddish.

The associated, "historically dual" imperative ending "-ts", as in
"geyts", "kumts", "veynts nit", reach far eastward into northeastern
Polish--Litvish Yiddish territory. The pronouns do not! The
"ts"-imperative was apparently recorded in 18th century letters from
Vilna, as well.

A number of jokes continue to reflect these features:

>From "Polish Yiddish": (Translators alert!!)
"TsOtsidiki:? MOtsidiki:! Nu, abI: tsOtsi"

>From "Litvish" Yiddish:
"Forts gezunterheyt.  Makhts an Optrit. Losts hern fun zikh."

The puns in this last one are worth pursuing. Great for vocabulary
building.

2. Dave Sherman: Can you post the dates of the Fall Conference in Toronto
again? Thanks!

Subject: Re: dual forms

In mendele 4.046, Arre Komar discusses the dual.

One must bear in mind that Common Slavic, the ancestor of the modern
Slavic languages, had a dual, which has been retained only in modern
Slovenian.  I'm not sure at what point it was lost in the other Slavic
languages, but it's quite possible that Yiddish was developing in a
linguistic environment where there was an active dual in the surrounding
language(s).  That, together with the Hebrew dual, may have reinforced
these forms in Yiddish.

Subject: lamed-feh-kuf

ellen prince asked:

>the tayerer shames must be having conniptions because this ain't about
>yiddish either, but...can someone tell me what lamed-fe-kuf means/stands
>for? someone told me it was an abbreviation for l'kudat 'by the command
>of', but couldn't explain the fe. can anybody help? a dank aykh.

There is a nice Jewish story I  could have told in this connection but I
will restrain myself. (Note: I prefer  to use "q" for qof instead of "k"
to distinguish it from the kaf.)

The  first answer  is simple:  the Fe  stands for  the Pe  (or Fe)  in
Peq'uda which is "command".  In the combination with the lamed ("for",
NOT "by") and the smikhut (genitive??) we get lifq'udat "for the order
of", written on a cheque or bill before the name of the person who can
use that sum of money.

There is another use  of lf"q which is used for  Jewish dates when one
does not mention the thousands.  Now we  are in the year 5754, but one
usually just writes 754 (tav shin  nun dalet) followed by lamed fe qof
which stands for LiFrat Qatan (for  the small count).  If one uses the
year  *with* the  thousands one  can write  after it  lf"g, the  gimel
stands for gadol as in heh tav shin nun dalet lf"g.

Subject: lamed-pe-qof

To Ellen Prince: The Hebrew abbreviation lamed-pe-qof stands for /lifkudat/
'to the order of' followed by a noun phrase, probably a name; it is used on
checks.

Subject: Re: lamed-fe-kuf

In mendele 4.046 ellen prince asks about lamed-fe-kuf.

If she's referring to an abbreviation, which she never says, then her
informant was pretty close.  The Hebrew is "lif'kudat" and also means "to
the order of" as on a check.  Hence the fe.

Subject: Lamed-fe-he

The abbreviation lamed-fe-he can mean a couple of things.  The inquirer
did not provide a context that I saw.

1)  LFK' (with a shtrekhl at the end) could mean liFkudat:  at the behest
or command of, where the fe represents the initial letter of pekudah, an
order or command.  However, the more common use for this letter
combination would be:

2) LF"K (with two shtrekhelach between the second and third letters).
This is often found following years (e.g. on tombstone inscriptions) and
means "le-ferek katan," by the condensed cycle, i.e. the Jewish year
witthout the thousands (e.g., this year would be taf-shin-nun-dalet or
754, rather than the complete form he-taf-shin-nnun-dalet or 5754); this
is a common usage.

In reply to Ellen Prince's query about the abbreviation lamed-fey-kuf:
perhaps this stands for lifkudat '(pay) to the order of'.

From: kuzmack@umbc.edu
Subject: Lamed-fe-kuf; Jewess

First, the easy one.  Lamed-fe-kuf stands for 'lifkudat' in Hebrew, not
'l'kudat', which in fact means 'by the order of'.  Hence, the fe.

Regarding the term 'Jewess', I think the problem is more than just being
out of style.  I am quite willing to believe that the English Forward is
not even unconsciously anti-Semitic and used in the term in ignorance of
its connotations.  However, these connotations are negative.

In the many languages which normally distinguish between male and female
members of national, ethnic, and religious groups, there is no problem in
doing so for Jews as well.  However, English is not such a language.  One
does not distinguish between male and female Americans, Russians, Poles,
Muslims, etc.  Moreover, the ending '-ess' is generally used to denote
the female of non-human animals, such as 'lioness', 'tigress', etc.  To
me at least as a native speaker of English, it carries an implication
that Jews are not quite human.  The only similar usage I can think of is
'Negress', which carries similar overtones.

Subject: re: Jewess

Here are some separate thoughts on a recent topic with strongly divided
opinions.

Yidine, Yidishke, Yenta, and Jewess all represent a word for a female
Jew.

In our household YIDINE, and of course YENTA, were common terms which
were used on a daily basis. Neither was complimentary.

Weinreich's dictionary gives the definition of YIDISHKE as JEWESS.

Thanks to Philologus for a lucid and thoughtful response to the reference
of JEWESS in the article.

JEWESS and PRINCESS are both beautiful words for beautiful people. Thank
G-d we can afford to spoil our daughters--they deserve it!
