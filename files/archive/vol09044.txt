Subject: Yiddish reports of the Yishuv

In response to Bernard Katz's note on two Yiddish books about the Yishuv
that were published in New York, the 1931 "Vos arbetorins dertseyln" is a
translation of the 1930 Hebrew Divrei po'alot (Tel-Aviv), published by
"Mo'etzet Ha-po'alot" -- the counterpart of which was the Pioneer Women's
Organization of New York.  Both volumes were edited by Rachel
Katznelson-Rubashov, a devout Zionist who was nonetheless profoundly
connected to Yiddish and had a fine literary sense.  She notes in her
introduction to the Hebrew volume that 51 out of the 57 participants wrote
their contributions in Hebrew; the other 6 wrote in German and Russian.  It
is very likely that Katznelson-Rubashov herself translated the memoirs into
Yiddish (not having the introduction to the Yiddish volume in front of me, I
can't be sure).  Katznelson-Rubashov was the editor of the Hebrew monthly
"Devar Ha-Po'elet" ("The Working Woman Speaks") for decades since its
establishment in 1934.  "Vos arbetorins dertseyln" contains a Yiddish
translation of Katznelson-Rubashov's 1918 Hebrew essay "Nedudei Lashon"
(translated by Harshav as "Language Insomnia," in his "Language in Time of
Revolution")  entitled "Fun Shprakh tsu Shprakh," in which she analyzes the
cultural and personal dilemmas of changing language allegiance. 

The history of the second book Katz mentions, Ben-Gurion and Ben-Zvi's 1918
"Eretz Yisro'el in Fergangenhayt un Gegenvart," was in fact undertaken and
written entirely in Yiddish, as a project suggested by Ben-Gurion for these
two Po'alei-Tziyon leaders who had fled the Turkish regime in Palestine and
were trying to raise money for the Yishuv.  Shabtai Tevet's biography of Ben
Gurion "Kin'at David" ("David's Passion"?) (Jerusalem, Schocken 1977)
vividly describes the 18-month long writing process, as Ben-Zvi was living
in upstate New York and Ben-Gurion in Brooklyn; they divided the work
between them, Ben-Gurion writing about two-thirds and Ben-Zvi writing the
rest.  It was hoped that the book would kindle enthusiasm for the Zionist
political program once World War I was over. 

Another example of a Palestinian book that appeared in Yiddish in the US was
the translation of the Hebrew "Sefer Yizkor," which appeared in Jerusalem in
1912 as a memorial to slain workers and "shomrim" (armed guards).  The 1916
Yiddish edition, published in the U.S., was a great success and all 3500
copies were bought up within a few weeks; a second, revised edition was
published in larger numbers (14,000) and a more elegant format.  According
to Tevet, the Yiddish press received the book very enthusiastically.

Subject: Yiddish  Press

Dirk Hoerder edited a project called Labor Periodical Preservation Project.
As far as i know four volumes were published under the title " The Immigrant
Labor Press in North America, 1840s-1970s."  They were published by
Greenwood Press from 1987- I participated in volume 2 " Migrants from
Eastern and Southeastern Europe." My section, "The Jews," pp 540-706 is the
last item in the volume. Most of the periodicals in the bibilography are in
Yiddish, although I did include a few Hebrew titles.

Subject: Yiddish newspapers in Paris

In reply to Shimmy Silverman [09.041]:

In the late sixties, there were not two but three Yiddish dailies in Paris: 
Unzer Vort (which he calls socialist but I remember as being rather
conservative and nationalistic if not chauvinistic - those are perhaps not
necessarily contradictory?), Di Naye Presse which was close to the Communist
Party if not an official organ of it, and Undzer Shtime, published by the
Bund, which might have had the weakest circulation (I do not know) but WAS
published daily for the entire time I was subscribed to it.  I subscribed to
it because it had the best Yiddish and was the most literary.  I did not at
the time know what the Bund was, but was pleasantly surpirsed to find myself
agreeing with almost all its editorial positions.  At some point after I
returned to the US I heard it had become a bi-weekly.  I do not know whether
it exists at all at this time, but I did see Undzer Vort being sold at a
newspaper stand on a trip to France about a decade ago.

Subject: a groys landshaft durekh a kleyn fensterl

I recently ran across this in the July 13, 1928 _literarishe bleter_
(Warsaw)  and give it over as it appears.  I wonder how many other
Mendelistn might be grabbed by this as I was.  Maybe someone who knows what
those prices meant to readers might comment.

I am a Yiddish teacher, now at Lauder Foundation in Cracow. We have about
twenty students and some 'adults" speking Yiddish. I would like to stage a
Purim shpil. Is there anybody knowing something suitable, not too long and
hard for us? I know there were special issues of Holiday Magazines, also
for Purim.

Subject: translation query

Khevre--

First, thanks for the previous help; it was much appreciated.  I turn to you
again for something which puzzles me. In Sholem Aleichem's "Sender Blank," a
character (the manservant Froyke)  refers to another character (an unknown
man at a telegraph station)  as "a royter Yid." As far as I know, this is
not a hair color reference (I was taught a Jewish redhead was a "geler
Yid").  Any thoughts out there? My own circle is coming up blank. 

Thanks,
Jason Payne

Subject: Searching for Emil Cohen

Hello!  I am new to the Mendele list.  I am a student at Stanford University
taking a course in Yiddish, and was reminded of an old record I would like
to find. 

My grandmother owned an LP record of a Yiddish comedian named Emil Cohen.  I
listened to the record several times, but it was broken.  I would like to
find a new recording, but I have not been able to find anything about Emil
Cohen.  I am not sure if I am spelling his name correctly. 

The record is mostly in English, with plenty of Yiddish mixed in. 

I remember one sketch from the record about an old Jewish man who was taken
to court for stealing a chicken.  He speaks only Yiddish, so they have a
translator for him, but there is a large amount of confusion because the
translator renders the old man's Yiddish idioms literally in English.  The
man's sarcastic "I needed the chicken?" becomes "I needed the chicken" and
so on. 

Does anyone know of where to find recordings or of any starting places for a
search? 

Thanks very much!

Ben Serebrin
