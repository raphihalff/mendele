With much respect and honor to Sylvia Schildt, I believe she may be
projecting her own experience in the Arbeter Ring shuln to the many others
who did not -- as she did -- go on to graduate both mitlshul and lerer
seminar.

I, too, am a product of the full scope of Yiddish Secular education, but in
the Ordn (Jewish Peoples Fraternal Order) shuln. By the mid 1940s, students
at the Kursn far Lerer un Hekherer Yidisher Bildung (School for Teachers and
Higher Yiddish Education, JPFO) were reading the Yiddish literary classics
in the original; that is, with Hebrew words NOT transliterated. My training
there allowed me to proceed immediately to become a cub reporter with the
Yiddish daily newspaper, "morgn frayhayt," (Morning Freedom) which, despite
its support of the Soviet Union, never accepted Soviet-style othography.

My many contacts over the years with contemporaries and younger folks who
were graduates of Arbeter Ring elementar (elementary) shuln -- but who did
not go on to mitlshul and higher education -- leads me to believe that they,
too, were not taught the Hebraic elements of Yiddish in their original
spelling during their elementary school years.

The difference, then, is not in political orientation, but in the
individual's level of education achieved.

Incidentally, we students at the Kursn also studied Tanakh from Yehoyish's
masterful translation, and under the tutelage of the outstanding historian
of kh'sides (hasidism), Menashe Unger, who wrote regularly for the
non-partisan Yiddish daily, "der tog" (The Day). As I recall, he also taught
elementary Hebrew (which allowed me to win a Golden Ayin for Hebrew studies
at Christopher Columbus High School, where we used the same textbook as at
the Kursn.)

I hope Mr. Itsik Goldenberg misplaced a pair of quotation marks which might
have attributed to a source other than himself his comment about the
"unusually unsavoury connotation" associated with the word "shikse." If,
however, that's how he, personally, interprets and uses the word for Gentile
woman, I have to question what century the man is living in. I hope this is
one of many postings of protest you receive dealing with his unsavory,
arcane and seemingly bigoted revelation. I found his submission to be
offensive in the extreme.

Subject: Re: shikse

Once and for all, shiksa is an anglicization of sheygetz; shoresh sh-g-ts.
It is the feminine form. Meaning non-Jew.

Gratuitous negative implications notwithstanding, that's the origin of the
word.

Being led down the garden path to creepy crawl critter is where you get from
_not_ reading the Hebrew/Yiddish alphabet.

In answer to the question about: shiksa, shegetz.  It comes from the Hebrew
meaning abomination.

A propos Mr Berger's cogent statement [TMR 08.004] about Yizkor books...When
the World Jewish Congress/Random House initiative was announced some years
ago, I saw to it that a very fine, very long, survivor's carefully
researched book about his life and times before, during, and after the
Holocaust, which he had written in Yiddish and then self-translated
(adequately) into english over a life time---was sent to that project. I
think the memoir very impressive; it begins in my parents' Belarus shtetl.

I understand that a few such books have or are about to be published by WJC
and/or Random House, which had first pick.  I have been in contact with the
WJC and know that the manuscript is still in the running for the
future---whenever that might be!

I believe that I was told that the WJC received at least 250 submissions,
though varying in length from one page to this 850 handwritten pages in
Yiddish book.

I have two Yiskor Bikher.  My father's town was Gnieveshov (?) in Poland and
my mother's city was Mizrich (?) in the  Ukraine.  My mother's book is
completely in Yiddish.  I have no difficulty translating that into English.
My father's book is in both Yiddish and Hebrew.  I don't know for what
reason, since I do not read Hebrew.

Would Yivo have any role in translating any of these books for the sake of
the continuity of information they contain?
