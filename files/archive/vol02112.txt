For Mikhl

With this strong tendency to lower u to o before r, how do
you explain the raising of same in psure/psire (Heb.
besorah `tidings')?

Subject: Sheygets/shkots

For Ellen

Right you are, both on light comlexion and on use of
sheygets as compliment. And don't forget the back-formation
from the plural, shkots, that can be used only as a
compliment.

A friend from Vienna who is now in his mid-70's always says
"tchatchke".  I never heard the word used in my family tho
both parents and all grandparents spoke Yiddish.  My mother
used English for "dust catcher" which I equate (correctly?)
with tchatchke.  At least one set of grandparents was from
Byelorussia, near Minsk.

Subject: Ts/s

To N.Zide re "Tsadie"  : In fact there is a considerable
area in NWPolan as well as in neighboring Western Yiddish
where initial "s" is rendered "ts". For example "er hot
nisht ken tsaykhl", "Paysekh tsim tsayder", the holiday
"Tsikes", the woman's name "Tsluve" (Slava!). These are all
non-German-origin words in Yiddish since (with only one or
two special exceptions) NO Yiddish words of German origin
begin with the "s" sound (zumer, zingen, zogn, etc.). In
the area in question, Hebrew origin words beginning with
(thus impermissable) "s", were reinterpreted as beginning
with permissable "ts". Perhaps this is the origin of the
comic "tsadie" types.
 
To Ellen Prince: In my experience, Toronto of the 30's and
40's, I think we might have distinguished an "Anglo" from
an "ethnic" as between 'a krist'(a FAYNER krist) and 'a
goy'. "shkotsim" were the guys who beat you up if you went
into the wrong park. They were probably mainly Irish kids
but I don't think we recognized such fine distinctions.

Subject: ts as phonaestheme; tsatske/chachke; sneezes

My doggerel examples - Vol 2, l03 - I realized after I sent
them all contained ts, and Gerald  Phillips, in his welcome
reply (where can I see the dozens of others he mentions ?
who composed them ? who disseminated them ?) gives a nice
example of ts where one wouldn't expect it in 'normal,
colloquial Yiddish' - 'Tsadie' for 'Sadie' - my mother's
name was Sadie, and none of her older - more or less
monolingual (as regards English) Yiddish speakers -
relatives said anything but 'Sadie'. The ts in tsrolley
(with an initial consonant cluster) is even more anomalous.
The translation equivalent in Yiddish of English s is s -
EXCEPT apparently for certain EXPRESSIVE uses in a
conventionalized, comical stage Yiddish dialect of English,
where the 'Yiddishness' (and therefore much of the humor)
is marked - heavily  - by the use of ts and other markers,
e.g. Yiddish e for the vowel in English 'pat' as well as
'pet', and, I suppose, most strongly, intonation - which
doesn't survive non-technical transcription. The ts in
Tsadie is a deliberate, for-comical-purposes,
hypercorrection.

Question: I would like to hear what the (dialectal, or
whatever) distribution of ts versus ch is in
tsatske/chachke (and elsewhere, - which probably
complicates things considerably ) is for Mendelniks. Is
there semantic specialization  for those who use both forms
(distinctively) - in Yiddish , or in Yiddish and English ?
In my (Litvak) dialect the form is always tsatske, which
has a secondary meaning (rejected by some) of an
affectionate diminutive - term of endearment (tsatskele) -
used as a term of address - for little girls. For me
chachka is an English word - of Yiddish  derivation, with
similar meaning, but differences reflecting different
cultural  attitudes toward the objects in question, e.g.
English chachka is more dismissive than Yiddish tsatske.Or
is it ?

Sneezes:  the version I heard - similar in  part to
Albright's and others' - the second part (after tsu lange
yor) is: tsu vaksn, tsu kveln/ a xupele tsu shteln.
