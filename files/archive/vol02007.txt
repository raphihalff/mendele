I refuse to accept Hersehle Bolshiviker's implied
[inspired? inspired by what single malt liquor?] suggestion
that bronfin is derived from those famous Canadian
bootleggers and distillers, th Bronfmans.

[Herb Basser writes (vol 2.05):]

Bronfen surely comes from German 'brandwein' (hope I have
 the spelling right) meaning 'burnt wine'  hence brandy.

But i do not see any connection between gut yontif (= good
good day) and mayim acharoynim vasser (= latter water
water) which are clearly "doubled" expressions and
mazzeltov  which looks like a straight lift from Hebrew
without any doubling of words.

Subject: kibits, bronfen

There is a bird which is called a "Kiebitz" in German which
is an Old World (I believe) sort of plover. They are very
noisy.

There is also an intransitive verb in German "kiebitzen"
which means to look over a player's (e.g. in a card game)
shoulder.

I would guess that bronfen also comes from German
"Branntwein" (distilled spirits, or brandy). It literally
means "burnt wine," the "burning" refers to the distilling.
From this we also get the English "brandy," of course.

Subject: Shlimazel (and friends)

Yitzhak Kertesz writes (in Vol 2.06) that shlimazel as
perpetual loser isn't defined in any European source.  This
may or may not help.  My mother used to refer to a class of
men who were even more forlorn and bedraggled than
shleppers as 'shlimiZOneks'.  Only in the last few years
did I realize that she was saying shlimazelniks.

Yitzhak asks how, since anybody can have bad luck,
shlimazel can apply to a person.  The answer I guess is
that we're talking big talent.
