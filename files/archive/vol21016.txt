Subject: Proust in Yiddish

Greetings.
This may seem an odd question, but does someone know if any or all of
Proust's "In Search of Lost Time" was translated into Yiddish before the
war? And if it was, any idea where a copy might be located?

On a different and more pedestrian topic: can someone tell me what Yiddish
phrase would equate to the English colloquialism "same S%#!, different
day"?

Given Yiddish, I would have suspected that there was a whole list, but
I've been unable to locate one.
Many thanks, in advance, for your assistance.

Subject: Nietzsche in Yiddish

Zhitlovski's translation of Zarathustra is quite well-known, though not
until today did I stumble across a couple of other translations of
Nietzsche into Yiddish: Ecce homo: vi m'vert, vos men iz and Dyonizos
difirambn, both published by Varshe: Turem in 1929, and both translated by
N. Aybeshits. Does anyone have additional information on the
translator?

Thanks,
Josh Price

Subject: tsezeyt in "Rozhinkes mit mandlen"

There is a line in the famous Yiddish song Rozinkes mit Mandlen that goes
"Az du vest amol zayn tsezeyt oyf der velt."  What is the meaning of the
word "tsezeyt?"

Mendele Vol. 21.013

Correction to Zulema Seligsohn's response:

Being born in Russia and leaving Russia for good at the age of 41, and
being also well read in Russian literature, I can testify that there is no
Russian verb "shiebel."

Subject: vinkl-kheyder

Dear Mendelyaner,

In a lot of translations of the song "Rozhinkes mit mandlen," the meaning
given for "vinkl-kheyder" is "the corner of a room". But I read that in
Yiddish the determiner is always before the word it qualifies.So shouldn't
the meaning of vinkl-kheyder rather be "in a corner-room," maybe a remote
part of the beys-hamikdosh?
Thanks for any help on that question...

Subject: "Khanele lernt loshn-koydesh"

In response to the request for the words to the song: "Khanele lernt
loshn-koydesh," here they are:

(Zayt mir moykhl if I misspelled/mispronounced some of the loshn-koydesh
verter.)

KHANELE LERNT LOSHN KOYDESH

Bin ikh mir a lererl un lern loshn koydesh,

Kumt tsu mir a Khanele lernen oyfn khoydesh,

A yetvider frimorgn, zi kumt tsu mir tsu loyfn,

Lern ikh mit Khanelen - oyf a nayem oyfn.



Roysh, fartaytsh ikh Khanelen, gletndik ir kepl,

Fregt zi vos "tapuakh" meynt - vayz ikh ir an epl.

Un az es kumt tsu dem shir hashirim zogn,

Heybn undzere hertselekh shtarker on tsu shlogn.



Ikh lern ales Khanelen, vil keyn zakh nit hipn;

Kumt tsu "yashkeni" - kush ikh ire lipn.

Kh'nem arum mayn Khanelen, oy, iz dos a khayes.



Kumt zi in frimorgn, zogt zi tsu mir "sholem!"

Un az zi geyt avek - blayb ikh vi in kholem.

Es geyt avek a vokh - es geyt avek a khoydesh,

Un di sheyne Khanele - ken shoyn loshn koydesh.

Subject: List of biographies found within Zylbercweig's and Reyzen's
"Lexicons" now completed

I have been working diligently to complete my data entry for the four
volumes of Zalmen Reyzen's "Lexicon of the Yiddish Literature, Press and
Philology" (1926-1930). If anyone needs look-ups, e.g. if a particular
person has his or her biography in these volumes, or what page one may
find a particular biography, please contact me with your specific request.

The list includes the following information (when available): surname,
given name, other names (pseudonyms, adopted names, Americanized
names,etc.),  town/city/gubernia/region of birth, as well as the real book
page numbers and pdf page numbers (see www.archive.org) on which the
biographies are located. I have adopted the YIVO transliteration rules in
my data entry of the individual names.

This database, as well as a similar database I have previously created for
Zalmen Zylbercweig's seven-volume "Lexicon of the Yiddish Theatre"
(1931-1969), is not searchable online -- thus I must be contacted for
information from the databases -- as I have no one who will volunteer to
create a database for me.

The Zylbercweig database contains more than 2,800 biographies, and I have
actually translated about 1,700 of them from Yiddish to English. These
translations will be online within the next month or two, as part of a
larger Zylbercweig online exhibition. How close I come to translating the
remaining Zylbercweig biographies will no doubt depend
on whether any volunteers come forward to assist me in this effort.

I hope to make an announcement regarding the onsite availability of these
translated Zylbercweig biographies within the next month or two.
s
I have no plans to translate any of the biographies found in the four
Reyzen volumes.
