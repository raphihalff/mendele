Subject: Talmud in Yiddish

Lisa Tomlinson asks [6.189] for a Yiddish translation of (parts of) the
Talmud? I don't have the precise reference at hand but, look for
Petrushka's excellent _Mishnayes_. I'm sure that YIVO can provide
precise bibliographic detail.

Subject: Transliterated Yiddish-English dictionary

Icek Mozes asks (6.187) for a Yiddish-English dictionary arranged
according to English characters.

         : NY 10016, USA.

Subject: Transliterated Yiddish-English Dictionary

In Mendele 6.187 Icek Mozes asked about the availability of acquiring a
transliterated Yiddish-English dictionary.  Such a dictionary does
indeed exist.  It was compiled and published by David M. Harduf of North
York, Ontario (in Metropolitan Toronto), another of whose works was
mentioned recently on Mendele.  Harduf published his "Transliterated
Yiddish-English dictionary [filed] according to the English alphabet" in
1992.  It is 270 pages long, and may be obtained from the author at 11
Plum Treeway, North York, Ontario, Canada  M2R 3J1.  I have no idea as
to the cost, but any interested parties could call him at (416)
663-5467.  Mr. Harduf also has published other transliterated
dictionaries for Yiddish and Hebrew.  I have no connection to him or his
works (standard disclaimer), except that I am the treasurer of the
Ontario Chapter of the Association of Jewish Libraries and he has
recently joined us.
