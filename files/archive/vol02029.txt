re maurice schwartz, he's been dead for many years-

[deleted]

don't know of tapes of his theatre work, but there are
certainly videotapes of at least some of his movies. even
my local little video store around the corner carries
'tevye der milkhiker' (i *think* that's the title) and a
few others. if yours doesn't, request them!

****************

Tevye der Mikhiker is a classic, with Hershel Bernardy
playing the grandson.  Of course he played Tevye years
and years later on Broadway in Fiddler on the Roof.
Schwartz can be seen to be the great actor we saw at the
Second Avenue Theatre years later, after his arriving in
the States.

Subject: Introduction

Just signed onto mendele after seeing the reference in the
Forward (yes, we get the Forward in Houston!). I confess to
a proxy interest; I'll be sharing the posts with my friend
Susan Ganc, who's our resident Yiddish
teacher/scholar/musician.
 
I, too, am fascinated by the juxtaposition of Yiddish and
computers. As a newcomer to computer culture, I am very
much drawn to the establishment of norms and community over
e-mail, and am currently working on a study of computer
groups (hi, Cal!). I'm a grad student in social work at the
University of Houston (euphemistically called a
non-traditional student, which means I'm older than most of
the professors). I'll mostly be lurking on mendele, at
least until I get my computer project going.

Subject: Universal Yiddish

After this week, you could tell me Swedish is Yiddish, and
I wouldn't bat an eyelash.

When Mt. Holyoke, which I attended back in the circle-pin
days, is the location of the National Yiddish Book Center
and its Summer Camp; when Garrison Keillor's radio show
mixes Minnesota with Klezmer, originating from the Upper
West Side in New York City, then somehow this (in name
only) Swede has found a home in Yiddishkeit.

zay gezunt,

Subject: Serious songs

When Noyekh Shames expressed his dislike of borscht belt
music, it reminded me of a conversation about the "good"
music in Yiddish, which amounted to Rozhinkes et Mandeln
[sp?] which was a lullaby, remade into a love song. One
person was holding forth that the reason was the paucity of
songs, particularly love songs, in Yiddish. There is one
beautiful song in Yiddish that I know from an Album of Theo
Bikel's--Love Songs of Many Lands--called "Ikh bin a maydl
in di Yoren." That one song, plus Romania, perhaps, was all
I knew to counter the assertion of a paucity of worthwhile
Yiddish songs.

This dying language/culture that is lively enough to
stretch from Mt. Holyoke to Minnesota in one week, surely
there are some good and singable songs, nu?

zay gezunt,

Subject: Mickey Katz

Hello Mendele readers! I'm delighted to be in touch with
you. Vicki Fromkin forwarded your recent discussion on
Mickey Katz to me, knowing I would be interested in it, as
I am his niece, the daughter of Mickey's younger sister. I
noticed a couple of factual errors, so want to correct
them. Mickey was born in 1909, and graduated from Central
High in 1927.
 
I, too, have a collection of his recordings, including one
78-studio re- cording which was never released, and I would
be happy to "share" what I have or know. I also want to
mention a terrific, relatively new Klezmer band called,
"Brave Old World". Bandmembers are: Michael Alpert, Alan
Bern, Stuart Brotman, and Joel Ruben. They have a CD/tape,
entitled "Brave Old World", put out by Flying Fish Inc. Ben
Bazyler joined them for the record- ing. For those reading
this message, some of these names will be familiar to you
and will probably be strong recommendation in itself. For
the rest, it's worth a listen and makes a great gift.
 
Again, glad to be on line.
 
Susie Curtiss
