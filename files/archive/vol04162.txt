Subject: Introduction

New "lister" on Mendele, Ruvn (Roland) Millman is a film-maker who has
been working primarily in the corporate arena for the past ten years with
film, videotape and television.  Roland is a graduate New York
University's Film and Television Department.  He is now making a
documentary film with his wife Beverly (Brurieh) Miriam Post named
"Double Heritage".  Double Heritage is about the post-war adoption of
Holocaust orphans by American Jewish families. Ruvn and Brurieh are
filming people, chronicling how the adoptees fared in their new lives
after the war.  How they came from various European countries and learned
a new language, changed cultures, took-on a new family, new name, new
relatives...and locked away their lives from before the war.  Ruvn has
been learning Yiddish at YIVO evening classes since 1993.  He is a member
of Yugntruf and Workmen's Circle's Yiddish speaking youth branch #105.
Ruvn will be at Yugntruf's "Yidish Vokh" (god willing) this coming
summer.

Subject: Yeke; Scrabble

About yeke: Mikhl Herzog has cited for us the suggestion that it is from
German Geck, pronounced in some dialects as Jeck [yek], meaning something
like 'dandy' -- which strikes me as more plausible than some of the more
picturesque etymologies, which are just as much part of the folklore
about Yekes as the stereotypical character is.  But I wonder how
plausible it is that a dialectal German word would enter the general
non-Yeke vocabulary.  What was the mechanism by which a word that
German-speakers might have used among themselves (on fairly rare
occasions) got into the vocabulary of non-German speakers in a parodic
sort of way?

About Yiddish Scrabble: There is Hebrew Scrabble, which you can buy in
Israel and probably in some Jewish bookstores in the US.  You might have
to buy 2 sets to get enough alefs and ayins, etc. for one Yiddish set.
And of course there wouldn't be single tiles for tsvey-vovn, tsvey-yudn,
vov-yud, etc., but I'm not sure you would want those.

Subject: Yiddish scrabble

My granddaughter Ariella has an idea for you. She owns a Hebrew scrabble
set and suggests that you try using it to learn what is missing and how
many of each letter and how many points would be desireable to make each
letter.

Subject: Yiddish Scrabble

Let me dredge up an old posting of mine to mail.yiddish...

We had a terrific time at the Yugntruf Yidish-Vokh in Copake NY, from Aug
31 to Sept 6.  (Dos vet zein nokh a briev, ven ikh vel hobn tseit tsu
shreibn fun dem.)  Among the unplanned activities, we found ourselves in
a game of Scrabble in Yiddish with Josh Waletsky and his family.  They
have a Scrabble set which has been done over in Yiddish.

Josh told me the value and breakdowns of the letters were done by someone
else about 50 years ago.  I think some of them need adjusting. Josh's set
had only 90 letters instead of 100:

Letter		Value	How Many Tiles
======		=====	==============
aleph		 1	12
beis/veis	 3	 4
gimel		 3	 4
daled		 2	 3
heh		 3	 3
vov (vowel)	 1	 5
vov-vov (cons.)	 2	 2
zayin		 1	 1
ches		10	 1
tes		 2	 5
yud		 1	 4
yud-yud ("ey")	 2	 3
caph/khaph	 4	 2
lamed		 2	 3
mem		 2	 4
nun		 2	 4
samekh		 1	 3
ayin		 1	 6
pey		 3	 2
fey		 3	 2
tsadik		 8	 2
kuph		 4	 3
resh		 1	 4
shin		 2	 4
tof/sof		10	 1
<blank>		 0	 3

A computer-based analysis of word frequencies in something like
a dictionary (not just written text) would be helpful, but I'm
pretty sure the above numbers need some adjustment.  Clearly there
should be more zayins, for example.  Anyway, it was a great way to
improve our vocabulary.  (Did you know that "mi", mem-yud, means
"effort"?  Or that "mesh", mem-ayin-shin, means "brass"?)

Subject: Shtot Fun Palatsn

To Bob Freedman:

The Library of Congress' union catalog lists four holding libraries for
Y. Berliner's Shtot Fun Palatsn (Mexico, 1936): Yivo, New York Public
Library, Yale, and Library of Congress. According to RLIN, it is also
held by Cornell.
