Subject: "Silver Platter" in Yiddish?

With the world celebrating Israel's 50th anniversary Thursday, April 30, the
official day of Yom Haatzmaut for this year, I would like to share with you
this beautiful poem written in celebration of the then newly established
state.  It would be interesting to know if there is a Yiddish version of this
poem. 

THE SILVER PLATTER
by Nathan Alterman

           "A state  is not handed to a people on a silver platter."
                                                   (Chaim Weizmann)

The earth grows still.  The lurid sky slowly pales
over smoking borders
Heartsick, but still living a people stand by
to greet the uniquenesss of the miracle
Readied, they wait beneath the moon
Wrapped in awesome joy,before the light.
--Then, soon,
a girl and a boy step forward
And slowly walk before the waiting nation:
In work garb and heavy-shod they climb
in stillness.

Wearing yet the dress of battle, the grime
of aching day and fire filled night
Unwashed, weary unto death, not knowing rest,
But wearing youth like dewdrops in their hair.
--Silently the two approach,
And stand.

Are they of the quick or of the  dead?
Through wondering tears, the people stare.
"Who are you, the silent two?"
And they reply:  "We are the silver platter
Upon which the Jewish State was served to you."
And speaking, fall in shadow at the nation's feet.
Let the rest in Israel's chronicles be told.

Subject: Looking for Undzer Lid

There was a conference of Yiddish culture in Brussels in 1949.  The conference
published a volume of songs called "Undzer Lid". 

Does anyone know anything about this conference, or know where to find the
book?

Subject: wassershlogn

Does anyone on Mendele know of a custom possibly known as wassershlogn. One
of my older students remembers as a child imbibing 3 gulps of water and
turning towards the door just prior to the fast on Yom Kippur. 

Thanks for the help.

Subject: Lutzky poem

I'm inquiring on behalf of a friend in Philadelphia, Norman Newberg. He has
translated a poem by A. Lutzky, "Der vint un mayn kapelyush" (The wind and my
hat) into English using a cassette tape of a reading by the noted actor Joseph
Buloff. But he hasn't been able to find the written text of the poem. 
Apparently it is not in any of Lutzky's published collections. Can anyone
help? Thanks.

Subject: Adobe Reader and PDF files

When Sholem Berger and Refoyl Finkel announced the arrival of Der Bavebter Yid
No. 2, I rushed to access it and print it out.  I use this kind of material
for my leyenkraz.  However, the GIF format results in a somewhat fuzzy
document.  After several exchanges of messages with Refoyl, who has the
patience of a Job, he has provided a PDF option which now can be opened with
Adobe Reader 3 to give very beautiful, clear Yiddish.  I strongly urge all
Mendelyaner to download Adobe Reader 3 from the Web (it's free) so as to
become able to use this great tool.

Subject: Yiddish typewriter

When I read the poem by Shmuel Halkin in 7.188, I thought this would be a good
opportunity to test Refoyl Finkel's Yiddish typewriter.  So I saved it to my
clipboard and, then after accessing the Yiddish typewriter on the Web, pasted
it into the message area of the Yiddish typewriter.  I then selected the PDF
option which converts the message to Yiddish and saves it as a PDF file.  This
I was able to open with Adobe Reader 3, and, lo and behold, a beautifully
clear Yiddish version of the poem came up on my screen which I was able to
print out. 

I recently received a piece from Noyekh Miller who used the Yiddish typewriter
PDF version to create the Yiddish of his Podolyer Golem and send it to his
list.  This means that by using the Yiddish typewriter we can communicate with
each other in the real thing. 

Hopefully, one day even Mendele will be able to include real Yiddish messages
in its posts.

Subject: Yiddish diminutives

Dear Friends, I am trying to find out more about Yiddish diminutives,
specifically double diminutives (imminutives as they are also called) as in
tishele, brivele, and so on.  I know these occur throughout modern Eastern
Yiddish and in Alsatian Yiddish.  However, I do not whether they occur in
Middle Yiddish so the question is what is the oldest attestation of these? 
And do they occur in any of the sources we have for non-Eastern Yiddish
dialects other than Alsatian (e.g., Swiss, Dutch, German, Bohemian)? 

Also, Eastern Yiddish has the compound diminutive ending -khl (or -khn) in
forms like maylkhl < moyl.  Again, how old is this and does it occur anywhere
outside of Eastern Yiddish.

Subject: -te feminine suffix

In Mendele 7.189, both Joachim Neugroschel and Mikhl Herzog rebuked me
deservedly for my off-the-cuff asssertion that the -te suffix in ployneste was
of Slavic origin.  Serves me right for speculating from my office, from the
depths of my ignorance, without any relevant reference books to steer my foot
away from my mouth. 

My apologies to Mendele for my sloppiness in that response.  For the record,
my formal credentials as a Semiticist, or Slavicist, or any sort of linguist,
are nil.  I'm an amateur, and sometimes I make amateurish conjectures that
should be phrased more tentatively. 

My confusion and hasty conjecture about the suffix probably were driven by a
similar- sounding feminine suffix used in Yiddish that I'm sure (well, I think
I'm sure!) is of Slavic origin, namely -itse.  Examples include: krasovitse,
paskudnitse, nudnitse, pustepasnitse, plimenitse. 

That said, I have some questions about the theory of Aramaic origin that
Joachim Neugroschel cites for the -te feminine suffix.  As he points out, the
Yiddish spelling is the phonetic "tes-ayin," rather than the "tov-alef" that
would be expected in Aramaic.  Certainly not all Yiddish words of Aramaic
origin convert the final alef to an ayin: the words gufe and khoge come to
mind, but there must be others.  Are there any Aramaic- origin words in
Yiddish that maintain the "tov-alef" suffix? 

Furthermore, although Mikhl Herzog states that the -te suffix occurs only with
words of Hebrew origin, Joachim Neugroschel offers poyerte as an example with
a Germanic base.  I've found two others as well: ezelte and lignerte. 

I'll step back and let the linguists take it from here.
