Subject: shabash

A "shabash - nik" is what I heard several Ukrainian gentile women near Sokol call a 
hearth, a kind of stove which people slept on in the winter for warmth. They said they 
called it this because of it being on all time during the "Shabes" in Jewish homes. These 
gentile women would come in and relight the  "shabashnik" when the fire went out, 
acting as the "shabes goy."

Subject: shabash

In connection with Murray Woldman's answer: In one answer there is mentioned
Kurdistan. Well, in Kurdish shaf bash (good light) means hallo, have a good day, a gutn 
tog, maybe it changed to an expression of excitement, as like as in Dutch goeie dag (good 
day) is used for excitement at positive surprise!

Dear fellow Mendeleyaners,

When I reviewed my Twitter settings, I discovered the opportunity to join the ranks of 
volunteer-translators to translate Twitter into other (i.e. non-English) languages. Yiddish 
was not on the list, but it could be suggested/requested. Would I be the only one who 
thinks a Yiddish Twitter interface might be nice to have?

Subject: Book sought

I am desperately seeking a copy of:

"A Distant Voice: an autobiography of Samuel Lewin" translated by Joseph
Leftwich, New York: Cornwall Press (1997).

According to Worldcat records, no listed library in the world owns the book, and the 
publisher, Cornwall Press, appears to be no more. I have been working with the Jewish 
Studies Librarian at UC Berkeley, but neither of us has had any success. Any help or 
leads would be greatly appreciated! Please email me at: jingalls@berkeley.edu

a sheynem dank!

Jenna Ingalls

[Moderator's note: Paul Howard Hamburg, the librarian assisting Jenna Ingalls, provides 
the same information but with a publication date of 1996 based on a citation that 
appeared in the Mendele Review on May 4, 1997.]
