Subject: Re: gret, zhaleven

In response to Hugh Denman's posting re _gret_ et al:

_gret_ has in it the /e/ of _bet_ 'request'.  _greyt_ has the diphthong /ey/
of _heym_ 'home'.  Hence, the 3 dialects
(Northeastern/Southereastern/Central, in this order) have: gret~greyt~greyt
vs. greyt~greyt~grayt.  Doesn't look like there's any relationship between
these two roots.

To Dina Leviash re her reply re _zhaleven_:  Russian _zhalovat'_ and Polish
_ZaLowaC_ 'to regret, feel sorry for' are etymologically and semantically
related to the Yiddish word, but Yiddish dictionaries (and Mendele readers)
have given us straightforward glosses.  The Yiddish word does not mean 'feel
bad for, regret'.

Subject: Re: gret

Those interested in the etymology of gret may be interested to note that
Both Weinreich and Harkavy list vaystsayg for 'linens', where tsayg is
'fabric'.  The usual Yiddish for German geraet 'tools, equipment' is
getsayg. Stutshkoff  (p. 99 col. A) has a list: vaysgret, vaystsayg,
veshtsayg, bettsayg, betvesh.

Subject: Re: Yiddish stories in transcription

In Mendele 14.004, Lynda Cohen asks for a source for  transliterated Yiddish
stories. Ruth Levitan has published several excellent collections, mostly of
humorous stories. Glossaries of "difficult" words are included. These books
are probably available from the Workmans Circle Book Store in NYC. Two of
the books are: "A Sheyne Gelekhter," and "Azoy Gor," but there are others.

Subject: Pronouncing the final "s"

Here's a pronunciation/transliteration question for you.

In English, final written "s" as a grammatical marker (for plurals,
possessives, third person singular verbs, contractions) is pronounced either
s or z, depending on the sound before it: e.g., cats and dogz, the beez
kneez, washez the dishez. In English, if the preceding sound is voiced or a
vowel, then the "s" is pronounced z.

How about Yiddish? I'm interested in the cases where "s" is written and the
preceding sound is unvoiced. There are fewer cases than in English insofar
as Yiddish makes less use of final "s" as a grammatical marker.

Here are just 2 examples from songs:

1. bulbes, mayn mame's oygn (both s sound I think)

2. un geshikt nokh di fidlers, di tsvey (would this be a z sound?)

I don't care too much about how these are transliterated into the roman
alphabet, but I'm doing some transliterating into cyrillic.

I had Dovid Katz' grammar book somewhere, but can't find it. He may mention
this.

Thank you

Subject: Synopses of Yiddish plays

I'm involved in a project with a local Jewish museum (Magnes Museum in
Berkeley, CA) to develop a slide presentation about the Yiddish theater.
Specifically, we are looking for brief synopses of the plots of the
following Yiddish plays:

Dos Groyse Gevins  by Sholem Aleykhem

Der Meshiekh Kumt  by J. Rumshinsky

The Tzadike's Mishpokhe  by Ludwig Satz

The Green Millionaire by Abraham Shomer

Oy is Dos a Meydl  by Jacob Kalich

Can anyone help?  Thanks.

From: FradleF@aol.com
Subject: Two bibliographic questions

I have two queries:

1- The initials samekh-tes are listed as the author of several entries in
both editions of Der Algemeiner Yiddisher Entzeklopedia. I cannot find any
references regarding this author and would appreciate any information as to
who this might be.

2- I am looking for any information about Volume 2 of Asher Penn's
"Yiddishkeit in Amerike."

It does not have a Library of Congress identification, does not exist either
at the YIVO or the 42nd St. Library in NY, and seems to have never been
published although in Volume 1 Penn annotates each chapter of Volume 2. If
anyone has any idea of where/how to access this book, please contact me. I
am particularly interested in seeing Chapter 11, titled Camping.

A sheynem dank,

Fradle Pomerantz Freidenreich

"Dos besere lebn durkh khemye: Chemical Literature in Yiddish
Stephen M. Cohen

Chemical literature is usually studied in one of the principal languages of
chemical research (e.g., English, Russian, German, French, Japanese, etc.).
For marginalized or minority groups, their only exposure to higher education
may not be available in these languages. Yiddish, the language of the poor
and segregated Eastern European Jews, has a highly developed fictional,
political, religious, and theatrical literature, but also includes
little-known scientific writings, mostly from the Soviet Union and United
States. This paper presents a rationale for and history of 20th-century
chemical works in Yiddish, including textbooks for the student and
layperson, teachers' guides, propaganda, reference works, and news articles.
Examples of these works will be shown."
