Subject: pro-am matters

Fred Sherman need not be so apologetic regarding so called amateurism (vol.
07.148) despite being told very condescendingly in that same volume that
mendele "is primarily a scholarly list but there are Yiddish "newbies" also."
Said who? And since when? 

While the various -ists are welcome to their pompous opinions it would do a
lot for the sholem bayis of this list if their views of amateurs "promulgating
all kinds of fantasies" were kept to themselves. This is not a scholar's list;
this is a yiddish list and is open equally to anybody with any interest in
Yiddish. Neither does anybody need any patronising heteyrim to ask questions
"if we don't know the literature". 

If the scholars wish to bore themselves endlessly with the roots of davenen
and cholent then that is their prerogative. As for the rest of us who don't
give a shma-koyleynu for diphthongs and gutturals and who couldn't tell an MHG
from an AEG let's make a quickie minyen -the minion's minyen- in the polish
(etym. ?) and start the kidesh forthwith.ÿ And the scholars had better not
attribute chulent to shul's end because by the time they finish davenen
there's not going to be anything left bar a few beans (bundlekh? bebelekh?
arbes?) which they can then dissect to infinite particles (or should it be
participles?) and sit and munch over them until long past rabeynu tam's zman.
But then they shouldn't promulgate fantasies about it being anything to do
with hot either because I'm afraid it's going to be very cold. 

Ignorance isn't only bliss it's tasty too!

Subject: The spirit of Yiddish needs protection

I thought it might be better to ignore the whole distasteful matter, but...

Along with Fred Sherman (7.148, 7), I too have been unimpressed by a so-called
"professional" with unspecified credentials berating others for offering
Mendele material with which he disagrees and won't digest.ÿ The mark of true
professionalism is care, accuracy, eagerness to share well-founded knowledge,
providing sources and nature of evidence, and eagerness to learn from others. 
Take a look at some of the self-styled professional's communiques (not even in
Yiddish!).ÿ Note the carelessness in spelling, etc. and the apparent
reluctance to learn from others.ÿ Among the 1500 Mendele subscribers there is
an abundance of people who have taught us much. 


It is not attempted humiliation of others, it is not self-promotion, but it
_is_ humility in the face of the huge task which is at the heart of true
professionalism.ÿ In any case, self-aggrandizement approaching arrogance is
inimical to the spirit of Yiddish, as well as the whole spirit, purpose and
basis of any kind of professional scholarship. 

Besides, who passed the law that Mendele was only for those who claim to be
professors in this field?ÿ I have not been informed of that!ÿ Besides, Yiddish
is hardly one field!ÿ Besides, let's get on with Yiddish literature and
language and culture! 

Nu, abi gezunt!ÿ Mir zaynen do!

Subject: Swiss Yiddish

I would like to thank A. M. Ramer for the correction on my comment on Swiss
Yiddish. However, I am very pleased that I shared my first impressions -
however misled - because Swiss Yiddish is a new subject for me and I am sure
that I would otherwise never have been given the concise, clear and
wonderfully pertinent information that my impressions provoked. 

Please don't be too saddened by such having to point out how misleading first
impressions may be, particularly for the untutored. There is a great deal of
literature on Yiddish which for a great many reasons most of us will never
read. As long as misleading impressions are nipped in the bud so that they
can't become "received popular wisdom", they provide a wonderful platform for
the better informed to disseminate their knowledge in an extremely efficient
way. 

For my part, thanks to Mendele in general and A. M. Ramer in particular I
shall be looking at Swiss Yiddish in a new light and probably with more
interest. 

With thanks

Vivian Aldridge

Subject: William Safire-Sunday Feb. 15

William Safire: GOTCHA!

German _Schmuck_ rhymes with English _look_ and means 'jewel'.ÿ Yiddish
_shmok_ rhymes with Yiddish _zok_ 'sock', and means 'penis'. It DOES NOT rhyme
with the German word and there is no known way in which it can be derived
therefrom. The two words are decidedly NOT RELATED, and appeals to a presumed
reference to "the family jewels" in Yiddish are misplaced.

In other words, Mr. Saphire's reference to "penile and ornamental origins of
German-Yiddish _schmuck_" are completely off the mark. There IS NO
"German-Yiddish _schmuck_".

English _shmuck_ rhymes with English _luck_ and means 'fool'.ÿ It IS derived
from the Yiddish word. 


Our best evidence points to the Slavic origin of Yiddish _shmok_. See, for
example, Polish _smok_ 'serpent', 'tail'.

Re: New York Klezmer Ensemble [07.147]

My LP is in storage, but I do seem to remember that the ensemble was formed
around Ray Musiker (clarinet) and his son.

Subject: Carmel andÿ Yiddish newspaper

Re: Yiddish newspaper in England

Naroditski, Yisroel (1874-1942) [Israel Narodiczky]. Naroditski {Narod Press}.
In 1937 the press was located at 129-131 Bedford Street.

Shimen Ravidovitsh and others appreciated Y. N.'s contribution as publisher,
printer and friend of Hebrew writers.ÿ His home at 48 Mile End Road was a
meeting place for Brenner, Gnesis and numerous others.ÿ Needless to say, his
milieu was largely a Yiddish-speaking one and he never saw any conflict
between his Hebrew and Yiddish interests.ÿ N.ÿ gave his children Hebrew names: 
Zerubavel, Shoshana, Bar-Kochba, Carmel.ÿ _Jewish Books in Whitechapel; a
bibliography of Narodiczky's Press, compiled by Moshe Saunders and edited by
Marion Aptroot, London:ÿ Duckworth, 1991.ÿ Ref:ÿ A yidisher farleger.ÿ {Loshn
un lebn (December 15, 1943)}; Yitschak Bakon, Brener hatsair (1975), passim;
Kalmen Marmor, Mayn lebns-geshikhte II, p. 506-507 and passim; NL 6:172-174.

Subject: Introduction

Shalom,
	
My wife and I are friends of Noyekh and Jo Miller.ÿ After many discussions of
Yiddish literature and the state of the world, Noyekh has finally convinced us
to sign on to the E-mail list for Mendele.ÿ We look forward to reviewing the
comments and perhaps sending in our own thoughts. 
	
I am in Medicine and my wife is a Psychiatric Social Worker.ÿ We have three
young children.ÿ Our current energies are focused on our children and making a
weak effort at keeping up with the world around us. 
	
Thanks for letting us join you.
Jerry and Karen Benjamin
