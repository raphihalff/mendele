Subject: Transcription and self-respect

The Journal of the American Oriental Society (vol. 114, 1994) recently
printed the Presidential Address by the president of the society, Jacob
Lassner, a distinguished scholar of medieval Islam.  In it he told a
charming anecdote about his father's attitude to his studying such an
impractical subject as Near Eastern Studies, in which it's clear that he
spoke Yiddish with his father and has a great deal of respect for him.
It was dismaying to see how he wrote the Yiddish:

	"Meyn zun," he said, "vaks'd eyn idyot!"

The "ey" is inspired by German spelling (I think), and certainly the
"eyn" where his father must have said /an/ is from German, and the silly
apostrophe-d in vaks'd is from English with not a moment's thought given
to the function of the suffix.  He would never in a million years be so
careless with transcription of Arabic!

Subject: A sakh

The word sakh is part of the Hebraic element in Yidish.  A hint of the
word's Hebraic origin is the lack of a pasakh-alef as a vowel, which one
would expect in a Yiddish word with Germanic or Slavic roots.

In Modern Hebrew, sakh means "sum," i.e., total quantity.  I believe that
its most frequent use in Hebrew is the expression "sakh-hakol," meaning
total or summary.  The spelling in both languages is samekh-khaf.

Subject: A sakh

Zev bar-Lev writes concerning "a sakh":

> sakh is hebrew for "sum", esp. as in sakh ha-kol "sum of all -- sum
> total".

Be that as it may, my parents (from Poland) certainly used it to mean
"lots", "a sakh gelt" - lots of money "Ir zolt hoben a sakh nakhes fun
dos kind." - May you have lots of nakhes (untranslateable) from the
child.

Subject: Lobuz, pripetshik, zhe

As a speaker of yiddish *and Polish, I want to respond to three of the
"kashes" posed by Henry Mullish and Szalom-Lew Korbman in 5.026.

'Lobuz' is a very common Yiddish borrowing from an equally common Polish
word whose meaning covers a fairly wide spectrum of mild to serious
misbehaviour.  'Der kleine lobuz' could be "the little rascal", while
'der groise lobuz' is "the scoundrel".  It is not mentioned in
Weinreich's dictionary.

'Pripetshik' is not derived from the river Pripet, but from a Russian or
Ukrainian "small cooking stove" (see Weinreich's dictionary).  Mlotek's
collection of Yiddish songs "Mir trogn a gezang" translates 'ofn
pripetshik brent a fayerl' as "a flame burns in the fireplace".  Needless
to say, it was probably a small wood stove and nothing as fancy as an
urban fireplace.  The word has the diminutive ending and comes from the
Slav root "piek" meaning "to heat, heat up, bake".  In my childhood in
Warsaw the corresponding Polish "przypiecek" was a brick ledge built into
the side of an urban coal-burning fireplace, where a cat (or a small
child or both) could curl up and catch a warm nap on a cold winter day.

'Zhe' is also a borrowing from Polish or Russian, in both of which it is
a particle commonly placed after the imperative form of a verb.  In
Polish it has a sense of general encouragement, and this is preserved in
'zet-zhe kinderlekh', 'gedenkt-zhe teyere' and 'zog-zhe nokh ein mol'.
Yiddish 'zog-zhe' corresponds to Polish 'powiedz-ze' (say, please say,
please tell) etc.

Zay-zhe ale gezint und shtark!

When this subject came up on Mendele about 2 years ago, I made a point of
looking up Wexler's paper on this subject in IJSL. My considered opinion,
as someone with a Ph.D. in theoretical linguistics and with a fairly
strong background in the history of Slavic, is that there is no merit to
Wexler's arguments.

An extended critique of Wexler's paper by Edward Stankiewicz (a very
important name in Slavic Linguistics) was passed on to Mendele by Victor
Bers; it should be possible to get it from the archives.

I doubt that it's worthwhile going into this subject again at length on
Mendele ...

Subject: Friends of Yiddish, London, England

Mendelniks who intend visiting London may like to know about the 'Friends
of Yiddish'. This group meets each Saturday afternoon at 3.00 pm. at the
Toynbee Hall, 28 Commercial Street, London E1, in the heart of what was
once the Jewish East End of London. Meetings end at 4.30 pm. There are
readings and songs accompanied by a guitarist. The 'Friends of Yiddish'
is led by Majer Bogdanski, a fluent speaker, singer and writer of
Yiddish. The nearest Under- ground station is Aldgate East (Metropolitan
and District lines). (Friends of Yiddish: +44 (0)171-488 3092).

Much earlier on Saturday you may also like to attend the Shacharit
service at the nearby Bevis Marks Synagogue, Bevis Marks, London EC3. The
entrance is through an archway into a courtyard. This beautiful Sephardi
synagogue was completed in 1701 and will in a few years celebrate its
300th anniversary. It is possible that you may hear Majer Bogdanski
(Friends of Yiddish) taking part in the service. Shacharit is at 8.30 am.
(Bevis Marks Synagogue office: +44 (0)171-626 1274.)

Subject: Sotn in Gorey

Our local leynkrayzl will be starting to read Bashevis' Sotn in Gorey,
and I'm stumped by the title of the first section "Sheynis [shin-nun-tav]
t"kh [tav"ches] in Gorey." This is obviously some date--the translation
has "1648 in Goray"--but it isn't in the usual Hebrew date form.  Will
someone please enlighten me as to how you get 1648 from "Sheynis
tav"ches."  A sheynem dank in foroys.

Subject: Translators and translations

Der Bay has been acting as a clearinghouse for translators and those
seeking translations of Yiddish letters, memoirs and books. Much of this
has been for genealogical purposes. While suggestions for both parties
have been given, it is time for an agreed upon set of criteria of
pricing, modes of transmission, standards, and mediation.

There is no fee to either party for being listed. The financial
arrangements are personal and may be kept private.

The problems to be addressed are: how are the charges to be determined,
will there be partial payments as submissions are made, how will the
material be transmitted, in what format is the translation to be sent,
how will disagreements be resolved.

Here are the current metahods of operation.

All material must be sent as copy and not original (in rare cases a visit
may be made for items which cannot be copied). One must never, never
leave originals out of oneUs possession.

Currently, a list of several translators is given, varying in ability,
price range, and ability to send online, typed, handwritten, or oral
report.

For long manuscripts several representative pages may be sent for an
estimate to determine the cost and the translators style/performance. It,
likewise, affords the translator an idea of the degree of difficulty.

Long manuscripts should have partial payments, at agreed upon periods
upon periods, after translations have been sent.

A clearinghouse is also kept on problems encountered by both translators
and submitters.

In cases of disagreement a mediator should be available, and in major
works one chosen by each party, and a third selected by the other two
mediators.

Please send suggestions and requests to Fishl online. For AOL subscribers
