Subject: leytsan
Date: June 1

Leytsan is Hebrew for clown or entertainer. It was not a common word in
Dutch Yiddish. Instead, the word leits or lets was used, which has the
same meaning and also stems from Hebrew.

Regarding the question about "leytsan" (Aubrey Jacobus), the book Isaac
Rivkind. Klezmorim Jewish Folk Musicians. A Study in Cultural History. New
York:  Futuro Press, 1960 has a whole chapter devoted to the meaning of
this word in relation to entertainers and musicians.  The book is written
in Hebrew.  I have a very rough translation of the chapter that a friend
did for me--it's a little hard to follow but if interested, please contact
me (winklerh@hotmail.com) and I can send it to you.

Subject: leytsan

Aubrey Jacobus asks about the etymology of the word leytsan. This is an
old Hebrew word. In the Midrashim it meant, according to Jastrow's
dictionary, "irreverent talker, scoffer, jester." It is derived from the
root lamed yud tsadi, just like "leyts."

"Leyts" (spelled just lamed-tsadek) is Hebrew for jester, clown, etc. From
the same root: "latson" (Yiddish pronunciation would be  "lotsn") =
frivolity. Also, in the viduy prayer (said on between Rosh Hashanah and
Yom Kippur, on Y "K, and on other fast days) is the word "latsnu," meaning
"we have been frivolous. " Depending on how grim you are, in this context
it can mean either frivolous about serious things, or any frivolity at
all.

Subject: shitere finger

Does it mean of the owner of  "shitere finger" that money runs through his
fingers? Or is he a crook?

Subject:  Ola Lilith, Wladyslaw Godik, Rumshinsky's "Varshe."

In the course of researching cabaret music in Yiddish and Polish in Warsaw
between the wars, I have started to focus on Willy Godick and Ola Lilith
(sometimes Ola or Olya Lillith). (I wrote a Wikipedia article for each of
them.) Briefly, Godick was born in Russia and began his acting career
there, worked in Vienna, moved to Warsaw, started a revue theater called
"Mirage, " worked at Qui Pro Quo where he met Ola Lilith singing in
Polish, convinced her to leave with him and start Azazel, the first
Yiddish revi-teater in Poland. She was the singer of the elusive  "Azazel
Shimmy " which I have not been able to find (written by Moshe Broderson
and Henech Kon).

Godik and Lilith came to America in 1931 and Lilith starred in "The Girl
from Warsaw," her show-stopper solo was simply called "Varshe" (NOT the
Gelbart song which has been recorded several times). In his memoirs
Yardeini waxes most enthusiastic over her, at length.

They went back to Warsaw, fled to the Soviet Union at the start of the
war. They toured there a bit. They must have split up at some point - he
joined the Red Army, was wounded, and sang cabaret in Russian in Moscow
and then after the war came back to Warsaw and sang in Polish revue
theater until he died in 1952! Jewniverse has her dead in the holocaust,
but her friend Yardeini sang with her on WEVD and visited her many times
in Florida - he says she joined the American Army, met and married a
Christian, sang on WEVD, lived the last decades of her life in Miami
Springs FL. Died after 1979.

I'm looking for any other traces of these two. I intend to call the Dade
County library system and see if she left any papers to anybody in
Florida. But -Does anybody have, or know of, any recordings by Ola Lilith
other than the two readily found on the web (An Eytsele and Omar Abajo)?
Does anybody have any further information on either Lilith or Godik? Or
know where any might be located?

Thanks for any pointers.

Subject:  Yiddish theatre website

For those of you with an interest in Yiddish theatre, here is an update on
my work:

1. Most of the unpublished Zalmen Zylbercweig book  "Yiddish Art Theatre
in America" (about the first five or so years of Maurice Schwartz's
Yiddish Art Theatre group) is now online at the virtual Museum of Family
History, in pdf format. You can learn more about
this and find the link to this file at
www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/yata.htm .

2. Most of the unpublished seventh volume of Zylbercweig's  "Lexicon of
the Yiddish Theatre" is soon to be online, and I will tell you all when it
is.

3. I, and to a lesser extent a small number of volunteers, have translated
more than five hundred of the more than 2,800 biographies from the six
published volumes of the aforementioned  "Lexicon," but have not announced
it yet as I am loathe to make the translations available without having it
proofed by someone who is good at it. I may have to relent at some point
so these interesting biographies can be easily read. I also have databased
the transliterated names of those individuals (and organizations)
biographied, but I will hope that someone will volunteer and step forth to
create for me a searchable database so the material can be located online
easily. Of course, I also wish for people who will volunteer to translate
more of these biographies, which include not only actors, but playwrights,
stage directors, prompters, directors, et al, and taken as a whole gives a
good perspective on the history of Yiddish theatre.

4. I also have created a list of more than four hundred Yiddish
productions (in New York), including dates (when available), from the end
of the nineteenth century to the 1950s, many from performances at the
Thalia, People's, Public, Grand, Second Avenue, Kalich, Folksbine et al
theatres.

With each listing I have included the names of the actors who performed in
each. So in this database I can search by the name of the actor or the
season, for instance, and see the history of work of any actor and what
plays were produced during what season. I welcome other play listings,
especially those that include casts of characters, theatre names,
performance dates, etc. I also have a list of Yiddish plays performed
elsewhere, such as Philadelphia's Arch Theatre, Chicago's Douglas Park
Theatre, et al, as well as a list of those who acted in these plays. I
will include all of these with my New York listings.

5. I am working on a listing of Vilna Troupe performances, not only in
Vilna but elsewhere in the world. I have many such listings, with casts of
characters, dates, etc.

6. Don't forget about my Maurice Schwartz collection of listings of more
than 100 of his Yiddish Art Theatre productions, found at
www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yt/yat/yat-D.htm. This is the most complete
such listing to be found anywhere. Also you can visit my entire Maurice
Schwartz exhibition at
www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/mschwartz.htm , or better yet begin at
www.museumoffamilyhistory.com/yat-01.htm.

7. If you have any questions about any of the above, or need a look-up,
just drop me an e-mail with a specific request and I'll be glad to help
you if I can.
