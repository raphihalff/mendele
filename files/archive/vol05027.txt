Subject: lobbes

In response to Mr. Mullish:

The term lobbes is indeed used in North America.  My grandfather used to
claim when I was young that there was one running around inside me,
although 20 years laterhe thinks it may be gone. Of course we live in
Canada, so it could be a commonwealth thing.  Of course, he is from
Poland, so I suspect that it is a common enough term. I'm surprised no
one in New York knows it...

Subject: Yes, there is Yiddish in Halifax!

Jonathan Dembling asked (Mendele 5.026) about Yiddish activity in
Halifax. I am pleased to answer that there is indeed an active Yiddish
club here, meeting weekly from September to June.  The current secretary
is my wife, Lilian Falk (who, incidentally, recently took early
retirement from the English Department at Saint Mary's University largely
to be able to pursue her special interests, one of them being Yiddish).
Several club members are from the Sydney-Glace Bay area, so that further
contacts should be easy to establish.

For more information, either of us can be reached by e-mail and also by phone
at 902-422-5173.

Subject: toyvye, tuvye, tevye, teve, tevl, tevke

With regard to the Tevye issue, all of the above are Yiddish names.
_Tevye_ is spelled tes-veys-yud-hey, possibly because of a folk etymology
relating it to the name written tes-vov-veys-yud hey (and pronounced
[tuvye] and [toyvye].  Mordkhe Schaechter has hypothesized (I don't
remember the written source -- for that matter, I'm not even sure whether
it's written) that _tevye_ in fact has nothing to do with the other two
forms.  Instead, he suggests that it is a diminutive form of the Yiddish
name _dovid_.

"The diminutive of _dovid_?!" you might ask.  "Meshuge mayne sonim?!"
Well, here's the story:  we know that in Western Yiddish voicing of stops
in certain positions lost contrastiveness -- in non-linguists' terms that
are relevant to this case:  the sounds [t] and [d] sounded the same at
the beginning of words, so that _tank_ and _dank_ are indistinguish- able
(probably pronounced [tank]).  Thus, /dovid/ is rendered as [tovid].
Diminutives in this dialect are generally *not* with [l] as in the
Yiddish most of us are familiar with (e.g. tish ~ tishl ~ tishele) but
with [Cye] where, by the symbol "C", I mean the German ich-Laut (the
sound which corresponds to the letters "ch" in the German word _ich_ --
as opposed to the sound in Yiddish, which we transcribe as "kh" in
_ikh_).  For those dialects, it's [tishCye].  (This diminutive form made
it into some of Eastern Yiddish as well, e.g. the Be,dzin area of Poland
-- see Max Wein- reich's _History of the Yiddish Language_ for details.)
The [o] in _dovid_ underwent a vowel alternation that is typical in
Yiddish diminutiv- ization and pluralization, namely [o] --> [e], as in
kop ~ kep ~kepl		top ~ tep ~ tepl	tokhes ~ tekheser ~
tekhesl Put 'em all together and you've got _dovid + Cye_ --> [tevCye].
For most of eastern Yiddish, the sound [C] is unavailable and it drops
out, so [tevCye] --> [tevye].  Voila`!  Anyway, such is the hypothesis.

It would be interesting to find out (and if you know yourself, or have a
reliable traditional khazn, for instance, please ask and then let us
know): What is the _ufruf-nomen_ (the name by which someone is called to
the _toyre_ for an _alie_ 'aliyah') of someone named _tevye_?  "Yaymoyd
tevyo/tuvyo/toyvyo/ dovid ben X"????

I think that in Modern Hebrew, Sholem-Aleykhem's _tevye_ became _tuvya_
based on the belief that _tevye_ is a related (but "mangled") form of the
Biblical name tes-vov-veys-yud-hey.  Under the assumption that _tevye_ is
a Biblical name, it was further assumpted that this must be the Hebrew
name with the vov and the name with the vov, furthermore, must be
pronounced [tuvya'] in Hebrew.  Shtelt zikh a kashe:  why [tuvya'] and
not [tovya']?  The answer may be:  of the two names, at least one -- the
former -- is/was widely familiar to the Eastern European Jews who
initiated Modern Hebrew, i.e. from the Yiddish name _tuvye_.  I don't
know how widespread the name _toyvye_ is/was, but I personally have never
run across it.  (Perhaps [toyvye] is specifically the name of the
Biblical characters and of them only, whereas _tuvye_ and _tevye_
are/were contemporary personal names).  So now here's yet another
question for the readership and for your to ask your Yiddish-speaking
acquaintances:  do you know of any people by the name of _toyvye_?

As for the way the Ukrainians refer to Tevye, viz. [tevel], I think this
is no more than a Ukrainian pronunciation of the Yiddish [tevl], which,
as noted above, is one of the forms of the name.  (Why they should use a
different form from that which Tevye calls himself is still puzzling to
me, however.)

Whether _tevye_ is related to _dovid_ or not, Sholem-Aleykhem nonetheless
probably thought (or thought that his readers would think) that the name
_tevye_ is indeed derived from the two Hebrew roots tes-(vov)-veys
(meaning: 'good') and yud-hey (meaning:  'God'):  no matter how God or
the world messes with Tevye, Tevye's credo remains that "God is good".

Subject: Oyfn Pripetshik

Szalom-Lew Korbman asked in Mendele 5.026 about the words to _Oyfn
Pripetshik_.  I'm not sure I understand the nature of his first question.
I've always taken it at face value - a fire burns in the fireplace and
warms the room.  I don't see it necessarily as anything sentimental, it's
just an excuse for a rhyme with alef-beys.  I doubt that it has anything
to do with the Pripyat' River, where, I think, people might be more
likely to say "hays" rather than "heys."

As for "zhe," it's of Slavic origin.  It's used as an emphatic particle
in most of the Slavic languages in pretty much the same way as it is in
Yiddish.

Subject: Pripitshek and zshe

In response to Szalom-Lew Korbman's request (Vol.5.026), ten years ago
when visiting Tsfat in Israel, we toured a synagogue, and the shamos who
was taking us around pointed to a large, metal box.  It was about 6'
long, 2' wide, and 30" high.  He said: "You have heard about a
pripitshek? _This_ is a pripitshek!"  Apparently a small fire was lit
inside the box, and then the students would lie on top to keep warm.

With respect to the word "zshe", in Mordkhe Schaechter's "Yiddish II",
p.100, "zshe" is listed as a modal particle.  It meaning, depending on
context, is "so" or "then".  I don't see why it has to be used only with
a command.  How about: "Vozshe vilstu ton?" - "What, then, do you want to
do?", and the like?

Subject: Pripetchik + Wexler

I too often wondered about the association between Pripetchik and the
Pripet marshes of Russia. I assumed that it referred to a village in that
region. Is that in fact so?

As to zhe, we have been through that on Mendele some time ago. It is an
emphasizer of Slavic origen.  Thus "gedenk kinderlakh" would gloss
"remember children" while " gedenk zhe kinderlakh" would become "
remember then children" or "remember now children."

I want to raise a question of a deeper and perhaps more controversial
sort for our Khokhonim. Despite the rather conspicuous and dominant
relationship between Yiddish and German, i gather that a thesis was
presented by Wexler that Yiddish is really a Slavic language which was
"relexified" into German. Is there any merit to that point of view, or is
it just narishkayt?

Friends,

In the beginning of last semester I asked several questions about
teaching Yiddish lit. in translation.  Several people sent me letters at
my personal e-mail address, full of interesting suggestions and comments.
A few of these  people requested that I send them a syllabus after the
semester.  In the middle of the semester I had a computer problem and
many e-mail files are off in never-never-land.  If anyone is still
interested I am happy to send them a copy if they would only send a
request to my e-mail address, including their snail-mail address (regular
postal address).
