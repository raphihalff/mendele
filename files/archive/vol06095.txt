Subject: Nahum Stutchkoff

As part of the introductory material to Stutchkoff's 'Thesaurus of the
Hebrew Language',  there is an appreciation by Dov Sadan
"Ba'al-haOtsrot", including an account of his productive life and a
brief bibliography.

A brief note in English is also included, from which I quote:

Born in Poland in 1893, he began his career as an actor in the Polish
Yiddish Theater. In 1923 he made his American debut with Maurice
Schwartz's noted Art Theater. In the years that followed he became a
vital force in theatrical and intellectual Yiddish circles as
playwright, lyricist, director and producer. His radio program on
station WEVD made him indisputably the most popular figure among Yiddish
listeners in the New York City of the forties.

Subject: Vi zogt men Yidish in Velsh?

On behalf of a friend I want to ask for your help with a terminological
problem. Elin Haf Gruffudd Jones, of the Mercator Project in
Aberystwyth, Wales, has put this question to me and I could use your
assistance to give her the best answer possible.  Mercator is a European
Minority Languages information project (I refer you to its website for
more information: http://www.aber.ac.uk/~merc/).

As some of you may know, Yiddish, together with some other languages
like Judaeo-Spanish and the language of the Gypsies, have only recently
been belatedly recognised as European minority languages to be
considered alongside more fully territorially-based languages such as
Welsh, Catalan, Basque, etc. etc.  Still, better late than never!  These
languages now _are_ listed by the European Bureau for Less Used Languages,
and my colleague is now in the process of translating that list into
Welsh. The question she asks me is: what should Yiddish be called in
Welsh?

The most authoritative Welsh dictionary at present proposes two
possibilities, both of which both Elin and I have found problematical.
One is _iddeweg_ which literally means "Jewish language", consisting of
_iddew_ "Jew" and the suffix -eg which is added to names of languages
generally. This is formally parallel to the name _Yidish_ in Yiddish,
but...

The other option given, though not recommended, in the Welsh dictionary
is _iddew-almaeneg_, literally "Judeo-German".  Elin Jones asked me
whether this is not more accurate than _iddeweg_, since there are other
Jewish languages besides Yiddish.

I have answered that while agreeing with the objection to _iddeweg_, I
find the second alternative undesirable for other reasons...

In English, I pointed out, Yiddish is called "Yiddish", which name is
borrowed from the Yiddish name _yidish_; the language is not called
"Jewish". Thus an analogous formation in Welsh might be "Yid-eg".  One
problem with this suggestion, though, is that there is no consonant "y"
in Welsh.  To solve this, it seems to me that the Welsh name could be
_ideg_ without the "y".  This, I think, is fully justified from the
Yiddish point of view given that in Yiddish the language's name is
spelled either _yidish_ or _idish_; while on the Welsh side, the result is
compatible with the language's phonology?

If any of you would like to offer Ms. Jones some advice better than
mine, I will gladly forward relevant messages to her from the list.  You
may also write to her direct at esj@aber.ac.uk if you prefer.

A sheynem dank alemen!

Subject: `First Name' af Yiddish

In his fascinating litany of Yiddish 'rufnemen' in Mendele 6.092, Zellig
Bach has passed over the name my own father, Abraham, went by for much
of his life, "Boomie" ("oo" of "good"), from "(A)vroomie", from
"Avrohom". Born in 1922 on "the" Lower East Side, he has often told me
how other Abrahams wound up with the same nickname via the same route.
Although his brothers, and sometimes my mother, still call him that, as
the East Side and its _Kulturkreis_ receded into the century, he more
and more began to call himself, be called, and think of himself as
'Abe', oddly enough the most "American" form of all.
