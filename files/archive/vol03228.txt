I think the city is Konya  (previously Iconium) a very religious place
even to date (and the only all "dry" city I encountered in my driving
through "secular" Turkey).  Actually one of the names of that city was
Rum and Rumi chose his name after that of the city.  I wonder if Marco
Polo visited the city during Rumi's life,  if he did he must have been
rather  young, but  anyhow  Rumi's influence  should  have been  still
strong whenever he was there.  So  Kessler's point is well taken, that
travellers in foreign  lands can get a completely  wrong impression of
its culture.

I realize that all the above has  very little to do with Yiddish, Jews
etc., sorry.

Subject: Rahel Varnhagen

	I am interested in any information about or copies of
Yiddish letters or even Jewish-German letters written by Rahel Levin
Varnhagen.  Rahel was an intellectual Jewish woman who lived in
Germany at the beginning of the 19th century.  She had a salon where
other intellectuals gathered to discuss art, literature, politics,
etc. and she was also a close friend of Prince Louis Ferdinand of
Prussia.  After her death her husband published her letters (written
in German), but there has been some speculation about the letters
that he did not publish.  German was not her first language, though,
and there are several mentions of Yiddish letters written to her
brother.  I would really love to get a look at these if they still
exist. a sheynem dank--

Subject: "Jewish" Diseases

It is always very difficult to address a topic such as this one,
because many have used Genetic and racial terms to define Jews in
the past, and rarely for our benefit.

Of course, there is no Genetic basis whatever for Judaism. There are
many ways to define who is a Jews (and no doubt there can be much
debate on this issue), however, I think that you will all agree that
Jews can be found all over the world and as part of many (until
recently) non-mixing groups.

So, since there are obviously no diseases that can detect a person's
faith or culture, there are no "Jewish" diseases of this sort.

However, when a large enough group of individuals tends to reproduce
within its own numbers for a period of several generations (as, for
example, was the case of many Eastern European Jews) the frequency
of certain genes within that group can begin to differ from that of
the general population.

This is in fact what happened in the case of Tay-Sachs disease. The
disease is caused by a flawed gene which is by itself not dangerous,
because humans carry two copies of most genes - one from each
parent.

However, if the frequency of this flawed gene is greater in a given
population of individuals (for example Jews of Eastern European
descent) then there is a greater chance that two carriers might mate
and each pass this flawed gene to an ofspring.

I want to stress, however, that this situation should not be taken
to suggest that Jews are in any significant way genetically
different from people of other cultural backgrounds. For one thing,
Eastern European Jews are genetically closer to their slavic
neighbours that to the sphardic Jews. More importantly, the genetic
variation WITHIN any given Jewish population is GREATER that the
average variation BETWEEN that community and ANY OTHER GROUP OF
HUMANS, no matter how that group is selected. This statement holds
true whenever ANY two human breeding populations are compared.

It is now fully acknowledged within the serious genetics community
that the concept of "race", as applied to Humans, is not a valid
one. Jews, Blacks, Whites...none of these groups is a "race", and
thus it is not appropriate to group them on that basis.

This is why it is dangerous to speak of "Jewish", or "Black", or
"White" diseases. To term them in this way (even with quotations)
does seem to some- how imply that the adjective ("Jewish", "Black",
&c.) is part of the reason for the association. This, of course, is
not the case.

Tay-Sachs does not affect people BECAUSE they are Jewish. Some
African populations show a higher than average incidence of the
condition Sickle Cell Anemia; yet this fact has no connection
whatsoever to their skin colour.

I hope that my (longer than expected) submission has not offended
anyone. I look forward to hearing further discussion on this point.

Yosel (Jason) Berman.
