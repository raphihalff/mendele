Waclaw Wierzbieniec has asked me to announce on Mendele
that he is doing a doctoral dissertation on the Jewish
community of Przemysl in the period 1867 to 1943 and
invites assistance and advice from scholars of Polish Jewry
and all others in a position to help him. His address:  ul.
Lenartowicza 29/22, 35-051 Rzeszow, Poland.  He adds he
would be happy to assist others in whatever ways he can.

Subject: Ye

Could "ye" for "yo" in Litvishe Yiddish be analogous to
"Me(i)se" for "Moshe?" This is a pretty well-known
transformation among Litvaks.

Subject: intelligibility

My mother tells of flying back to New York from Paris next
to a M. Goldenberg of Toulouse.  My mother has limited
French, which was apparently equaled by his English, so
they spoke Yiddish, but with necessary `dialect'
accommodation.  In reporting that in the US many families
had two cars, she suddenly realized that the word she had
for `car' in her fluent New York-learned Yiddish was `car'.
Instead she said `tsvey voituren' and found that M.
Goldenberg found that a perfectly fine Yiddish expression.

Subject: Fir kashes

Hershel Bershatsky quoted a version of the fir kashes in
Mendele 2.160.

My children have all learned something similar (as indeed I
did as a child) and my youngest (aged 4) is currently
learning the kashes in preparation for peysach.

Except that we always begin "tate leben"

One thing that puzzles me is that the kashes seem to be
phrased in terms of the familiar "dir" which children do
not use to their parents.
