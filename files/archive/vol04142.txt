A couple of pedantic points here.

Other European languages that distinguish between familiar and formal
forms of the second person, such as French, German, Russian, etc., also
use the familiar form for addressing God.  Thus, in itself, it does not
tell us anything about particularly Jewish ways of relating to God.

Hebrew, on the other hand, does not make this distinction.  "Ato" is
singular and "atem/aten" plural, regardless of the relationship between
the speaker and the person addressed.

Subject: Kiddush Cup Riddle - Solved!

Last week I posed the riddle of my grandfather's kiddush cup, which
is inscribed :

        Aleph.  Yud.  Mem.  Chet.
                Ostrin
                4O Ann.
                 1930

I asked for submissions as to the meaning of the Yiddish abbre-
viations.

The next day I received a private e-mail from Yale Reisner in Warsaw,
Poland, that began, "Hello, landsman!"  It seems that Mr. Reisner's
forebears hailed from Ostrin some 150 years ago, and he knew that the
above letters stand for =Chevra Mesilas Yeshorim Anshei= - "the Society
of the Righteous Path of the Men of Ostrin.  Mr. Reisner also put me in
touch with the gentleman who owns the archives of the Society.

A fine introduction to Mendele, indeed!

Subject: Translators Wanted

I am in possession of a box of letters written in Yiddish around the turn
of the century by my wife's maternal grandmother, Malke Ruslander [later
Lender, then Lander].  These letters were written upon her arrival in New
York City around 1910 to her parents back in Yanaveh (sp?).  The letters,
from what we can tell, contain news about her exploits in America, her
addresses, and one letter is thought to inform her parents that she is
about to get married.  The box also contains other interesting stuff,
such as a post card with a picture of the ship that brought her over, and
a dues booklet from the White Goods Division of the ILGWU, complete with
the constitution of the ILGWU in Yiddish.

We are earnestly seeking translators of these letters.  We will send
volunteer translators a high-quality photocopy (many of the actual
letters are quite frail) via snail mail.  I am told, however, that the
idiosyncratic Yiddish spoken around the turn of the century is different
from modern Yiddish, and thus that the translations may be difficult.
And then there's Malke's handwriting.

We are confident that these letters will provide an interesting
perspective on America as seen by a recent immigrant.

If you'd like a try at this, please send your home address to me at
w.wallen@genie.geis.com.

All of the lectures were completely in Yiddish. Workshops were in
Yiddish and English with many of the questions being asked in English.

Both the National Yiddish Book Center and the Arbeter Ring had excellent
exhibits and several representatives.

While there was sufficient Yiddish speaking for even the most ardent
Yiddishists, the pracatical aspect was very much present. The session
containing ways of attracting young people through music was
particularly well-receoved.

Toronto is a marvelous city for sight-seeing and we were near many fine
museums in the Midtown Section.

Members of the International Yiddish Club Conference Committee met to
start planning the interviews for the next Conference.

Subject: Data on Toronto Conference

The Second International Yiddish Club Conference was held in Toronto
October 7-10 and while the significance of the long-term results is too
premature to evaluate, the growth can be easily measured.

Starting under the leadership of the premiere Yiddish club--Yiddish of
Greater Washington, the first conference was held at the University of
Maryland. A committee was formed consisting of the only Yiddish club
newsletters in North America; Miami area, San Francisco, Toronto, and the
Greater Wash. D.C. area. To this group was added an independent
representative from Ohio, and our own Noyakh of MENDELE.

At this point there is no official leader, no official publication, no
official membership list, and NO PAID HELP. It is a true grass-roots
movement.

These attendance data include only officially registered atendees. Many
more people in Canada came for only a portion of the conference. What
also was encouraging is that the number of letters of support sent from
around the world has greatly increased, including one from Montevideo.

While most of those present participate in a type of Yiddish club,
Yiddish circle, Yiddish sing-along, leyenkrayz, shmoozkrayz, etc., there
were quite a few who are Yiddish teachers or Klezmer band members.
Viewing exhibits, purchasing books, cassettes and CDs, and networking
were additional valuable activities.

Total      139      184

Five cities have expressed an interest in sponsoring the next conference.
No final decision probably will be made by the committee before the end
of this year. Sponsoring cities need a sponsoring club or clubs, a
committee, and satisfactory facilities for meetings/workshops and
accommodations for out-of-town delegates.
