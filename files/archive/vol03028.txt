In Mendele 3.025, Mark Pinson writes:

     I think the correct syntax is "toytn" is in the dative, i.e.,
     it would help as much as "cupping" (=bankes) would help a dead
     man. Anyone else encountered a "frozen", archaic dative that
     looks like this?

Why is "toytn" considered archaic or frozen?  The normal, regular
dative of "der toyter man" is "dem toytn man".  Perhaps, the
confusion is over the fact that "toytn", like other adjectives, is
declined like an adjective, even when it is used as a noun.

Subject: Teaching of Yiddish literature

Why Yiddish literature is rarely taught outside of Yiddish lit
classes? One of the great failures of Jews in this country
(especially in this age of multiculturism) is our failure to insist
that it is impossible to understand the story of modernity (its
triumphs and tragedies) without access to how much of the Yiddish
speaking world perceived reality for over 100 years (1845-1945). This
literature provides a unique striving towards particularism without
parochialism, Yiddishkeyt aligned to mentshlichkeyt, and a way of
understanding minority status that will be helpful to many different
groups who are emerging into their own in these United States. genug

Subject: Teaching of Yiddish literature

Ted Steinberg asks if anyone teaches Yiddish Literature. I am not
sure what he means.  There are lots of Yiddish lit courses around
the USA and elsewhere, too.  There is a Yiddish Dept. here at the
Hebrew University where they teach Yiddish Lit [In HEBREW!] and my
wife, Golda Werman, teaches Yiddish Lit in English translation.

NB The Yiddish taught in Hebrew is read in Yiddish.

Elkeh talks of the sugar string.  For those of us old enough to
remember rock candy, we made it at home by preparing a
supersaturated sugar in hot water and dropped strings into the pot,
leaving the free ends hanging over the edge.  When the sticky stuff
cooled, lo and behold, there was a gigantic crystal of sugar on the
dipped end of the string, i.e., rock candy, also available for
money, for the effete.

Good for you for learning the language and I hope you have the
necessary perseverence to read the literature.  I did not make it;
my wife did.

re: Kathryn Hellerstein.

She did have an email account at Annenberg and David Stern, her
husband, does have one at UPenn.
