Subject: Info about Buffalo Jewish Newspapers from the 30's

I have an interesting project that I've just started to work on, and was
wondering if anyone out there might be able to give me advice on how to
proceed.

In short, my father told me that his father (Morris Goldsman) had several
short stories of his printed in a small Buffalo Yiddish newpaper during the
1930's.  He remembers reading them at the time, and has always felt that they
were as good as Mark Twain or Shalom Alechem. Unfortunately, no one has any
copies of these anymore and my father has always regretted that they were
lost. I have taken it upon myself to see if I can find them somewhere.

Which libraries might be good places to start looking for collections which
might contain something like this? At this point I feel there is only a remote
chance that I will find anything - my impression is that these papers had a
very small circulation, and what are the odds that anyone saved any of them?  

There is also an outside chance that he may have been published in other
larger (national) papers. My aunt recalls that he once received a newspaper
or magazine in the mail which contained one of his stories.

The only major work I've done so far is to spend a day in the Erie Country
Public Library (Buffalo's mail library), but without any luck. Because I now
live in Atlanta, this isn't something I can do every day!

Thanks for any help.

Subject: A shlak

The Rabbi of Satmer is known in the wider world for his militant anti Zionist
views. Amongst Chasidim however he is equally known for his sharp acerbic wit.

On his first sikes after he arrived in America he heard the people around him
talking about a 'roof'. After equiring about the meaning of the word and it
being explained to him he quipped, 'vos men hot in der haym gerifn a shlak
rift men hant a ruv'.

As we are told that etymologising is a 'Jewish national sport' would someone
like to speculate how 'shlak' which other than on sikes means either a lackey,
as in the quip above, or the devil, as in 'der shalk zol eym trefn', came to
mean a temporary flimsy roof on a sike.

Subject: Indianer

Now I am really getting confused. I agree wholeheartedly with Joachim
Neugroschel that the smaller dictionaries are rather useless. I guess the
problem is that my WAHRIG (1986) and MURET-SANDERS (1985) are not Austrian
specialized or turn of the century. I probably read the original article wrong
saying that INDIANER as TRUTHAHN (turkey) should be in any good German
dictionary, and that was the point I was trying to make -- not that it was an
impossibility for anyone to use Indianer to mean turkey (especially if they
were familiar with the American holiday of Thanksgiving).

Confusing part. I just talked to a Southern German (Ph.D.) who said that
whoever said Indianer meant Truthahn was pulling our leg. Guess I'll have to
have a university conference on this one. Just teasing. They already think I'm
a bisl meshugele, and I am sure if Joachim Neugroschel says it is in the
1974 MURET-SANDERS, it is.

I'm probably very much over my head in this argument, not being exactly a
native Austrian:-) and do apologize and wish I had the four volume 
MURET-SANDERS instead of the two volume one.

On another topic: Does anyone know of the superstition of not starting any new
project on Friday as that would bring bad luck?

Subject: Dream work by der bal ha-khaloymes

I thank Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan for her comments and reflections about my
comments (7.081,9).  Dos Porfolk changes in the head like a dream.  Sholem
Aleichem's statements at the start are clear that this is dream work: a sakh
arbet farn bal ha-khaloymes. And I am not surprised that my comments zenen
farplontert gevorn.

For example, I must suggest that Marjorie misquoted me and probably
misunderstood me.  She writes: "Lou states further that Sholem Aleichem calls
them vilde mentshn, and American Indians, as we sadly know, were referred to
as savages. But in the story, the keepers, the shoykhets, are called vilde
mentshn, not the protagonists."

That's not what I said.  I'd like to clear that up.  Here is what I actually
said: "At any rate, 'di vilde mentshn' (the savages) are not the American
Indians who in popular folklore of the time were so conceptualized.  In a
startling reversal, Jews carrying out ritual slaughter of caged, helpless
animals are the savages, 'di vilde mentshn.'  Two of the intended victims of
ritual slaughter are thinking, feeling beings.  They invite the reader to
observe along with them a bitter irony: a feast to celebrate freedom is
prepared by killing caged, bound beings who also long for freedom.  All this
for God. The helpless victims wonder about God."

Finally (and I am done with all this), when the words _indianer_ and _indikes_
are used in the same sentence, it may clue us in as to whether the writer
means that they are identical or not. Sholem Aleichem opens the last paragraph
(p. 153) with a telling sentence.  The essential declarative elements include:
indianer zenen gelegn _vi_ indikes.  He did not write that indianer _were_
indikes, only that they were lying _like_ indikes.  Whatever else one can see
here, it is obvious that indianer and indikes were compared with each other
and were not identical conceptions for Sholem Aleichem.

Dreams are very plastic.

Subject: zol mir zayn far dir

Or, in one of my favorite songs ("a kind a goldene," words by A. Reyzen), "mir
zol zayn far dir."

I think Dan Slobin is on the right track with Middle Eastern origins.  My
ignorance prevents me from offering much, but for what it's worth: R.Kipling's 
fascinating novel "Kim" takes place in 19th-century India and is liberally
sprinkled with Hindi words and expressions that are accurately used. There is
also an important secondary character named Mahbub Ali, a Pathan from
Afghanistan.  One of his favorite expressions, when he reassures Kim that no
harm will come to him, is "May I be thy sacrifice."  In my edition
(introduction and notes by Edward Said), the expression is described in a
footnote as a "Muslim oath of fidelity."

Surely there are Mendelyaner who could illuminate us further.

Subject: equivalent of English saying in Yiddish

I'm wondering if anyone here can answer a question we have been batting
around.  What would the Jewish equivalent be for the saying "We all have
our cross to bear"?  Yiddish and/or English phrases are all welcome.

Subject: Indianer in German, and turkeyness

I can hold my Langenscheidt's German-English dictionary (which defines 
Indianer as American Indian, not turkey) in one hand, but Joachim Neugroschel
warns (7.081, 3) that "if you can hold a dictionary in one hand, it's probably
useless for any complex research."

However, my dictionary does cover ordinary usages. I would bet that ordinary
usage is the influence on Yiddish most likely to operate for Sholem Aleichem's
use of Indianer in Dos Porfolk.

Also, the notion that kareln (beads) would mean a wattle rather than kareln
is a metaphor stretched too far for me.  Beads are hard solids resting with
some degree of firmness on the chest while wattles are fleshy, quivering
appendages hanging from the chin or neck.  Ober ver veyst?  As has been said:
az Got vil, shist a bezim.

I am wondering about the Turkish shawl, though.  I sense it may be 
interesting.  If my memory serves me, there is a connection with Sholem
Aleichem's early novel, Yosele Solovey.  Back to the research.

Subject: folklore

While in Brazil some years ago I purchased a small carved good luck charm and
fertility symbol (at least so I was told) which was called in Portuguese a
"fica". It was precisely the the thumb in finger gesture which I now learn is
called a "feyg" in Yiddish. Is that a coincidence?  In fact, when I learned at
the time that the fica was a fertility symbol I presumed that the etymology
was rather salacious. 

Re Tum Balalaike: I doubt very much that "A shteyn ken vaksn, vaksn on regn"
is as absurd as it may initially sound, nor does it have a salacious origin,
although that also would provide an amusing answer to the posed riddle. As
most farmers know, rocks do appear to grow in the fields.

Before one plows a virgin field one must remove the rocks in order not to 
break the plow blade. However after each winter rocks reappear, having been
heaved up by the winter frost. In certain regions, such as the eponymous
Rockland County NY, this is a perennial problem each spring.  The rocks do
appear to grow, and without rain. It is a rather well known physics phenomenon
that when you mix grains of different sizes and agitate them, the smaller
grains will migrate to the bottom of the container and the larger grains, in
this case the rocks, will migrate to the surface. Zey take vaksn on regn!

I'm trying to locate a work by Isaac Meir Dick called "Shivim Mohltsayt."
Has anyone ever heard of it?
