1.  Being much more familiar with Hebrew than with Yiddish, I was
    under the (mistaken?) impression that "schmus" was actually
    "shmu'es", derived from the Hebrew "shmuot" ("shmuos" in
    Ashkenasi pronunciation), that means "rumors" or "gossip".

2.  My familiarity with German is even less than with Yiddish, so I
    had to look "mauscheln" up in my pocket German-English
    dictionary (Langenscheit, 1983). I was unpleasantly surprised to
    read: mauscheln:  talk sheeny; _fig._ jabber. I then looked up
    "sheeny" in the English-German section, and only found the
    innocuous definition "glaenzend", which in turn, is translated
    as "bright, brilliant".

Aside from my annoyance at Langenscheidt's sneaky, or perhaps
inadvertent, retention of the  pejorative "sheeny" in such a recent
edition, I wonder:

1. Can anyone confirm or refute my guess as to the Hebrew origin of
   "shmus"?

2. Is it conceivable that "mauscheln" was absorbed into the German
   from Hebrew via Yiddish, like e.g. "meschugge", and "Tohuvabohu"?
   (Incidentally, both of these appear in the aforementioned
   dictionary as legitimate German words.)

Shana Tova to all.

1. With regard to Shleyme Axelrod's question and the ensuing
comments regarding "yontef": My father who was not an arayngeyer in
shil (not even rosheshone or yomkiper) was nevertheless fastidious
about proper observance, i.e. he loved to deride those who
professed to observe but did't "really" know what they were doing.
He scoffed at amoratsim who spoke of yomkiper as a yontef when it
is, of course, a "tones."  According to him, one did not greet
anyone on yomkiper with "gut yontef," but rather, "ir zolt hobn a
laykhtn tones." The proper greeting on rosheshone was "leshonetoyve
tikuseyvu" to be answered with "tikuseyvu ve sikhuseymu."  But I
can't recall whether he pronounced on whether it was OK to say "gut
yontef" on rosheshone. I think yes.

2. Mottl Lakin asks about "nemen afn tsimbl."  That was one of the
idiomatic expressions I mentioned a while ago.  In my family it was
used more generally to mean something like "putting on the spot."
Inciden- tally, in my father's vocabulary, pace Weinreich and
Harkavy, "tsimbl" was not a cymbal, but a cimbalom, the "Hungarian
hammered dulcimer" (Webster's Third Unabridged) beloved of Gypsy
(and some klezmer) ensembles.

3. I would maintain that the Yiddish pronunciation of yarmlke DOES
in fact include the r, with the qualifica- tion that uvular r before
m is generally not trilled, but is represented by (more or less)
velar constriction, something that could easily be missed by
someone referring primarily to the English phonological system.
This would be particularly true in places like New York and Boston
where English non-prevocalic r disappeared (at least in our days).
The question concerning i vs u is really not relevant since the u in
yarmulke is really an English spelling convention and does not occur
in either Yiddish pronunciation or Yiddish spelling (cf. Weinreich).

4. Since we're back to talking about idiomatic expressions (2
above), here are a few more that I thought I'd remind you of:

vi kumt di kats ibern vaser?  "How are we going to carry out this
(problematic) project?"  "The idea is good, but its execution is
problematic."

dort ligt der hunt bagrobn.  "THAT'S what's at the bottom this!"
"That's where the trouble lies."  This can also be phrased as a
question: vu ligt der hunt bagrobn?  "Where does the trouble lie?"

a berishe toyve.  The kind of favor a bear did for a man when he
swatted a fly on the man's head with his paw.

Although I've been lying low for the last couple of months I'd still
welcome additional examples, and I AM recording them.  I'll provide
a list of those submitted thus far in a little while.

Subject: Missed opportunity.

The communication from Allan E Blair enititled "Yiddish Clubs" was
short but totally uninformative.  Mendele is probably not the
appropriate place to record the proceedings of that conference,
however it would be of general interest to know whether any such
material is available to the public. More specific information about
what went on at the conference would be more effective in generating
interest in the Second Conference than the opinion that the first
was a "..huge success."
