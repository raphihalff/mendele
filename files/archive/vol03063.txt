Subject: koylech/barkhes

Thank you Yitschok K for elaborating.

In response to your question

"What is the definition of large? Does this mean larger than a loaf
of bread? "

-- I don't know (and I am quite willing to accept your
interpretation. We didn't use (eat) a koylech at home - it merely
came up in conversation, so i have no idea how big it was. Somehow I
just associate it with a very large loaf.

(Totally irrelevant, but this might amuse you: When I was accepted
at university  {=college} as an undergraduate, this became a subject
of some amusement to my father and his family, who had not
participated in a formal educational system, and certainly had
received no secular education. How could they when they were brought
up in Klimontow {klimentov, keltse gubernye} which had no such thing
as an elementary school. Education was at the house of  a mlamed,
followed by a number of years of participation in a shiur and joint
study in the beysmedresh. On hearing the word 'college' this was
immediately translated as koylech)

Subject: Shiksa

Growing up in Colombia, I remember my grandparents referring to the
maids as shiksas also, not with a negative connotation, just
matter-of-factly.

Subject: Old poetry

For a piece on the origins of the yiddish theatre, I would
appreciate information on yiddish poetry and folk songs from before
1880.

Subject: Vanity tags

In Staunton, VA there is a car with OI VEY as the vanity tag.  My
own is YANKELE.  Somewhere in Virginia there must also be YANKEL and
YANKL.  They were already taken when I applied for mine.

Subject:  Necrology

A number of MENDELE subscribers have heard of the sudden and
untimely passing of Bobbi (Getzoff) Zylberman's oldest daughter,
Penina, about two-and-a-half weeks ago, in Melbourne, Australia.
Before she married Michael Zylberman and moved to Melbourne, Bobbi
was a Yugntruf stalwart here in New York, a graduate of the Queens
College Yiddish program and a student in YIVO's Max Weinreich Center
for Advanced Jewish Studies.  Over the past few years, Bobbi has
continued her Yiddish activities through the establishment of
Koala-Farlag, a publisher of Yiddish children's books.  She and
Michael have raised their children in the Yiddishist spirit in which
they themselves grew up.

Penina, who was only nine, died after a brief illness.  Memorial
contributions in her name may be sent to: The Sholem Aleichem
College,  11 Sinclair Street, Elsternwick 3185,  Victoria,
AUSTRALIA.

Condolences may be sent to Bobbi and Michael Zylberman, at: 3
Lubrano Street,  East Brighton 3187,  Victoria,  AUSTRALIA.

A memorial service for Penina Zylberman took place on July 18th, at
Riverside Cemetery, in Lodi, NJ, and was attended by family and
friends from the New York area.
