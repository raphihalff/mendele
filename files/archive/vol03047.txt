Subject: Pseudonyms and lurkers

re david neal miller's discussion of the use of pseudonyms among
yiddish writers: thank you, that was very interesting and i stand
corrected. of course, i knew about singer and sholem aleichem, but i
was told the reason for them using pseudonyms, esp s.a., was that it
was a shande to write in yiddish. i also knew that there was a
custom among traditional yiddish grammarians to bash their peers
pseudonymously. and, now that you mention it, i can think of a case
of a person who writes irregularly for a yiddish newspaper and
frequently does so pseudonymously, but the reason in this case is to
give the appearance that there are lots of people presenting a
particular viewpoint. i didn't know about the other cases you
mention. could you tell me why they do it? partly, i'm curious about
this custom in general and partly i still haven't got a clue as to
*why* philologus writes pseudonymously, given that none of the above
reasons appear relevant. a dank.

btw, while for all i know philologus may reside in philadelphia, i'd
bet my bottom dollar on his maleness. (just a woman's intuition, heh
heh...)

re bob werman's lower-sorbian detective work: thanks, bob. does this
mean we can definitively eliminate you from the running? :)

but i LOVED that tidbit about the 'concealed' subscribers to
mendele! nor in yidishland... the _linguist_ list has over 3000
subscribers and is the largest in academe--and none are concealed.
more dramatically, there's another list in linguistics called
_outil_ (for _out in linguistics_) for bis, gays, lesbians, and
their friends--and even that list has no concealed subscribers. why,
oh why, would mendele? extraordinary. maybe we should start a new
yiddish list with no concealment allowed, called _out in yiddish_,
or, more simply and to the point, _oy_. ;)

Subject: Language, persona, journalism; goy

David Neal Miller's comment about Dubnov, "the russophone Kritikus
was more civil and less emotionally engaged than the yiddophone
Dubnov", reminded me of something my friend Larry Slobodkin said
about American Jewish journalism: that it used to be much more full
of controversy, covered a much wider range of opinion both political
and cultural, and in general on a higher intellectual level of
discussion in the days when it was mostly in Yiddish, while now the
Anglo-Jewish press in American is cautious, always (in Slobodkin's
opinion) afraid of making a shande far di goyim, or, more kindly,
afraid of creating dissension.  To those who are more familiar with
Yiddish journalism than me: is this true, and is Slobodkin's idea of
why correct?

This brings me to Randy Kloko's introduction: "Ikh bin a goy".  I
think Randy used the word "goy" as Yiddish really uses it: the
ordinary word for a non-Jew: Randy iz zeyer a fayner goy.  However,
some of my politically correct friends have decided they must
refrain from using the word IN ENGLISH, because they think it is
offensive in the same way that nigger, kike, spic, etc. are.  Now, I
like to be as politically correct as the next guy, but I just don't
feel that way about "goy".  While lots of Jews did and do have bad
attitudes about non-Jews, in my experience even in English goy
doesn't always have to have pejorative connotations.  But maybe the
English-speaking Jews I'm thinking of are really speaking relexified
Yiddish (!), and in the English usage of the amkho (the great
unwashed Jewish masses) nowadays goy really is a dirty word.  Any
thoughts?

Subject: The Slobodjanskyj scandal

Sorry for not responding immediately but I have been searching all
over for my copy of the Lingua Franca article which I hoped to
reproduce here.  To avoid further delay I'll just summarize it.

Not only did Wexler create this Slobodjanskyj pseudonym in order to
review the book where his own article appeared, but this
Slobodjanskyj "reviewer" went so far as to basically dismiss all the
articles with the severest of criticism and praise only Wexler's and
David Bunim's work.  (I assume that David is Wexler's friend). Ellen
is right, you need a barf bag, but that's only after your skin has
stopped crawling from the shock of such slimey, underhanded chutspa.

I agree with Bob Hoberman that in the early 80's, Wexler was showing
the greatest of promise.  I chose to finally react to this issue on
Mendele because Wexler, in the two classes that I observed when he
was a guest lecturer at Columbia, seemed so ongepikevet with
knowledge and linguistic skill, so capable of new and wonderful
comparisons among all the many Jewish languages he knows, that to
hear of such nasty doings and now to waste time and knowledge on
such a totally implausible theory, is painful and disappointing for
a Yiddishist like me.

The state of Yiddish linguistics is very depressing.  We had someone
like Rakhmiel Zuckerman who is so phenomenally knowledgeable about
Yiddish but is too unstable to function and then there is the
recidivist challenge to Yivo orthography that is totally destructive
to the whole Yiddish terrain.  Then there are others who could
continue in Uriel Weinreich's footsteps but don't want to be in
academia.  And now this business, which I recently became aware of.
What can I say, it just makes me very sad.  Maybe, it got to Wexler
too and it has made him go off the deep end with such a theory.  The
problem is that this is such a small field and there is so little
support available to ambitious young men in Yiddish linguistics that
it drives them to take extreme positions in order to get some
attention.
