Subject: Classification of languages

A couple of comments aroused by Khaim Bochner's last posting:

The Israeli linguist Uzzi Ornan once argued that Hebrew is not a
Jewish language: Biblical Hebrew, because it was not the product of
the chain of Jewish language shift, and Israeli Hebrew because it is
not embedded in a traditional Judaic culture.  Ornan saw himself as
a Canaanite.  Shoyn oys Yid.

The whole "Yiddish, the fifteenth Slavic ..." business is connected
with the question of whether a language can have a beginning.
"Genetic" classification of languages is based on the idea that a
language can have only one true parent, which can usually be
discovered by looking at its basic vocabulary and grammatical
structures.  In this, Yiddish is unequivocally Germanic, and didn't
truly begin when Jews started speaking it, but is just a much
modified (by contact with other languages, etc.) continuation of
Middle High German and Indo-European before that.

Another view is that occasionally a language can have two or more
parents, and new languages do (but extremely rarely) come into
existence.  The best treatment I know of of these two possiblities
is the book Language Change, Creolization, and Genetic Linguistics,
by Sarah Grey Thomason and Terrence Kaufman (U. of Cal. Press,
1988).  Thomason and Kaufman describe the handful of such cases that
are known, and assert that for such a language genetic classifica-
tion is meaningless.  Thus if Yiddish were an instance of such a
phenomenon, it would be NEITHER Germanic NOR Slavic NOR Semitic.
But according to their criteria Yiddish is very far from being such
a case.  The possibility that Yiddish is Slavic or that Hebrew is
Yiddish, if you follow Thomason and Kaufman (which I do), doesn't
come into the arithmetic, as they say in Hebrew (is that a Yiddish
idiom?)   Hope this helps.

Subject: The Shadow

Genug!  From a forensic perspective all of the guessing about
Philologus is off base.  S/he is a brilliant inidvidual who from the
start planned to keep the identity a secret. I for one don't care,
but have read and learned by the articles.

While this hidden identity may be a source of annoyance, it does add
a modicum of intrigue.  If one were to approach this from a truly
forensic angle, then as a criminal one would do all possible to
throw you off of the trail.  It is obvious that all of the guesses
are wrong, for the initial premise of location is incorrect.

If one were to be in this brilliant mind, one would throw you off
the trail from the start.  Lurking among us is the culprit.  What an
enjoyable time s/he is having.  Did you think that such a brilliant
mind would not be privy to our discussions?

Throwing you off the trail by taking opposite viewpoints is one way
this is done.  Someday there may be a slip-up, but I for one enjoy
the excitement of the intrigue more than our feeble attempts to
unmask this genius.  One cannot understand the actions of a chess
champion like Fischer.  His bizarre actions must be a price for
genius.

Subject: Self-review

Ellen takes me to task for my suggestion that self- review might be
a fantasy that we all share.  She says that my passing remark that
an editor duped into publishing such an animal should be strung up
is horrendous.  [Not to speak of the editor who is an active
accomplice; he/she might be put into a hole in the blazing sand of
the Sahara and painted with honey to attract the giant ants.]  She
even cites history; the editor in this case suffered, for two
painful years, for believing Wexler.

Khaim is even more down on me; he does not buy my idea that
self-review might be a universal academic fantasy.  Instead, he
suggests that this event is singular, a major embarrassment to the
field of Yiddish studies. [Parenthetically, this surely proves that
Yiddish studies is now truly establishment, having its first major
embarrassment.]

I approve of your seriousness but remember that fraud, in various
forms, is not singular to your field.  We have fraud in science and
in medicine, too, where lives are at stake. In one marvelous case,
the perpetrator, once discovered, was fired from his university
research job but allowed to continue to practice medicine.  The
purity of science had been upheld.

And seriousness should have its limits, too.  Look at Dr. Fabrikant
of Concordia University, who responded to being rejected for tenure
by killing four (Or was it five?) colleagues.

Forgive my hubris, now that I have listened to your moralizing.  Let
me direct the attention of the linguists to one aspect of the
difference between linguistics and literature.  My suggestion, I do
intimate, of self-review being a universal academic fantasy has
literary -- if not linguistic -- value. I am convinced it could
provide the basis for a great story, or even novel: the man/woman
who reviews him/herself.

Subject:   Macaronic???

I wish I could share L. Pra/oger's enthusiasm regarding Sander
Gilman's book ("Jewish self-hatred and the secret language of the
Jews"). I intend to discuss his analysis of the Jewish jokes in
greater details, but to lend support to Dr. Werman's comment about
academic life, let me ask: How do people feel about an author who
printed 17 pages 3 times with no changes and with no references to
the other appearances? (He doesn't even need a wordprocessor, just a
copier.)

Mauscheln (no umlaut) was the verb used by the German non-Jews to
refer to the dialect spoken by the Jews (Western Yiddish, Judeo-
German, take your pick) It is mildly derogatory. As a matter of
accuracy, let me point out that the word was only used in Germany
(Prussia, etc.) -- in the South (Bavaria, Saxony) and in Austria the
comparable word is ju"deln. For R. Hoberman, and other connoisseurs:

Im Jodeln der Steierma"rker,
Im Ju"deln ist der Meier sta"rker.

(Steiermark is the name of a province in Western Austria, home of
the Alps)

N. Zide, would you post the title of the book about Kafka where
mauscheln is mentioned? - thank you.
