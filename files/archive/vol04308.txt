Subject: Locating a Yiddish story

To Alan Shuchat: Do you know the story by Gerald Kersh "One way of
getting a hundred pounds" in Nathan Ausubel, ed. "A treasury of Jewish
humor", New York, 1951, pp 155-165?

This story is neither in Yiddish nor by Sholem Aleichem, but illustrates
very well the methods used by an entrepreneur who obtains the sum of one
hundred pounds which he needs to become a wrestling promoter by selling
(at a net loss of 21 pounds) chairs and eggs which he bought on credit.

The question has arisen: What female name pairings exist?  I know that my
Galician grandmother and her sister were called in Yiddish: Sushe=Gitl
and Reyzheydl (Reyze=Eydl).  So far, no one has been able to suggest a
derivation or proper spelling for the name Sushe.  Any assistance here?
My grandmother was a rabbi's daughter, so Sushe may have a Biblical or
even Talmudic (Aramaic?) derivation.  Perhaps Sasya?

Subject: Western Yiddish

Several times I've come across the term "Western Yiddish."  I have the
impression that it is an archaic form of the language, which stagnated in
Germany after dynamic development moved to the east.  Is such the case?
What would be some characteristics of "Western Yiddish?"

Subject: Marketing Yiddish courses

In reply to Joseph Sherman's query -- (from South Africa) - re. how to
draw students for a Yiddishcourse where Yiddish is not much valued or
attended to:

Yiddish is neither a dead language nor a ghetto language.  (Of the
shtetlekh, yes -- and only of the ghettos formed by the Nazis during
WWII)..  THe language holds the key to Jewish culture in Europe for 1000
years. No Jew of Ashkenazic descent in South Africa, Israel, America
(either one) , Australia, etc., would  be who he/she is without the
legacy of Yiddish (whether or not he/she knows it!) (And why not learn
your own legacy??!!!).  A knowledge of Yiddish  gives one access to a
body of great literature, music, art, drama, and lore;  Yiddish is
history come alive!  With Yiddish, too, a student can write/speak
with Jews all over the world.  Yiddish is a great way for a person to
draw closer to Jewiness| draw closer to Jewishness without relinquishing
a commitment to secularism (if that's what one has).  Etc. etc. genug
shoyn. Good luck -- hope you can draw students.
