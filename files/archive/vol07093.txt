Subject: fehlen a shtich nez

My father, the most gentle person I knew, was not given to cursing.  The worst
"curse" he would ever evoke was "zohl fehlen a shtich nez [you should lose a
piece of nose?]" which hardly sounds a proper curse at all.

Can anyone help me with the origins of this phrase. Of course syphillis was
known to produce defects in the nose bone structure, looking as if a part of
the nose was absent.  Could that be it?  Or cocaine, which I doubt was part of
Jewish culture before Freud experimented with it in the last third of the 19th
century, that produces defects in the nasal septum?

Thanks in advance.

Subject: shmooze

I've always heard and used "shmooze" in both senses. My Yiddish conversation
vinkl is called "kum shmooze". No kissing up that I've seen, but I'll keep a
sharp eye from now on. When I attended a secular mitlshul in the Bronx we had
a course called "sotsiale shmooesn". Dvoyre Tarant, our teacher, would not
have taken kindly to kissing up either. It was a current events class, if
memory serves correctly.  The pejorative sense was employed in far less formal
settings, sometimes with sexual overtones.

Subject: Zayt moykhl, a correction

Leonard Prager in a private communication corrected my romanization of part of
the Turkish shawl's curses (7.087, 3).  I wrote _shrid upolit_, but it should
have been _sored upolet_ (remnant and fugitive, according to Harkavy). Leonard 
kindly ascribed it to a "Freudian slip."  Actually, this has more to do with
my ignorance of the etymology, and therefore misreading the small print in
Harkavy's dictionary.

Subject: A plea for accuracy, care, respect

I heartily second the motion, i.e., Hugh Denman's plea (7.089, 6) that
Mendelyaner refrain from misquoting each other.  Just as important: to refrain
from distorting the sense of each other's comments.  Distortion, as much as
misquotation, garbles and curdles discussion and productive exchange of views.
Thus can be sabotaged Mendele's most valuable yields.  For example:

I wrote (7.084, 7), "I would bet that ordinary usage [of German] is the
influence on Yiddish most likely to operate for Sholem Aleichem's use of
indianer in Dos Porfolk."  To elaborate my point: Many observe that Sholem
Aleichem wrote so that readers should _immediately_ understand what he meant.
 That was an important principle for him.  As a consequence, he used ordinary
words that his readers readily grasped.  That gave his work that buoyant flow
which captivated Yiddish readers of diverse backgrounds _everywhere_.  His
Yiddish readers were sophisticated but not likely fans of writers who reach
for obscure usage.  I bet (again) that Sholem Aleichem would have rejected
showing off with such verbal quackery.

However, Joachim Neugroschel writes about that (7.086, 5), "In regard to Lou
Fridlender's comment that Sholem Aleichem would have been in touch only with
ordinary German,..."

That was decidedly _not_ my comment.  Sholem Aleichem was in touch with all
kinds of language tendencies.  Besides, who is Lou Fridlender?

Subject: Yiddish songs

The things you find when cleaning out a closet!!

I just turned up a volume of "Seven Popular Songs from the Yiddish" for voice
and piano by Hugo Weisgall, published in 1980 by Theodore Presser of Bryn
Mawr, PA.   The price at the time I bought them was $10.00.  Very professional
publication job, too.

The seven songs are published under the generic title "The Golden Peacock."
There is no information in the publication about the author or the
circumstances or, for that matter, the dates of composition.  But the songs
were apparently recorded by the late soprano,  Judith Raskin with Morey Ritt,
piano on CRI SD 417, which is almost certainly unavailable at this date.

The songs are (with spellings, capitalizations, and translations taken from
the volume of songs):

	1. Undzer Rebenyu (Our Rebenyu)
	2. Der Rebe Elimeylekh (Rebe Elimeylekh)
	3. Baleboste Zisinke (The Pretty Mistress)
	4. Mayn Harts Veynt in Mir (My Heart, My Soul Cries Aloud)
	5. Lomir Zikh Bafrayen (Drinking Song)
	6. Shlof Mayn Kind, Shlof Keseyder (Sleep My Baby)
	7. Di Goldene Pave (The Golden Peacock)

I have no idea why I bought these songs ca. 1980 and I've never heard them.
Anyone have an idea about their origin?

Subject: A song my mameh used to  sing to me

I'm  looking for a song that was  popular in the 30s & was a favorite of my
Mameh who used to go to the Yiddish theater. The words at the beginning are:
"yohren zai loifen zai flihen - vellen niosht mehr oisblihen(?) -
gayt vek di yohren - fangt men zu zorgen - ........."
I'd appreciate any background information + the right words.

A groiser dank.

Subject: dav(e)nen cont'd

Alexis Manaster Ramer does not address the problem of his proposed semantic
development in the change from D-V-V to davnen. First of all, the
development from 'to pray quietly' to 'to pray' (in general) is certainly
not outlandish, but that is beside the point. davnen just doesnt mean 'to
pray (in general), whether or not this is qualified by (Jewish) as U.
Weinreich does. For 'to pray', Yiddish shares the German origin verb betn
with its sister languages and also has the Hebrew origin verb mispalel zayn. 

Jews davn minkhe and davn shimen-esre, for instance. If a child is ill,
they pray for its recovery, they do not _davn_ for its recovery. On setting
off on a journey, they recite tfiles-haderekh, they do not _davn_
tfiles-haderekh. Therefore to gloss it as 'to pray' is imprecise, to gloss
it as 'to pray' (in general) is incorrect.

Alexis Manaster Ramer's etymology fails semantically because Jews _davn_
shimen-esre. Since shimen-esre is recited quietly by every member of a
congregation and then aloud by the bal-tfile or khazn, his etymology
requires us to assume that at some point, the bal-tfile was said to first
davn shimen-esre quietly, but then to ??? it aloud (whatever other verb was
used), which I find outlandish. But outlandish-outshmandish, if this
difference in usage were ATTESTED, we would have to accept that it was at
happened or at least try to explain it away. As far as I know, this
differential usage has never been reported.

Perhaps some etymological path other than the one presented by Manaster
Ramer will lead from D-V-V to davnen. Because of its semantic flaw (and for
other reasons I have not gone into), I cannot agree that Manaster Ramer's
etymology is still not ruled out.

Subject: Shlock or schoch

With all due respect to Bob Werman and for Bob's information, there is no
confusion between schoch and shlock.  Schoch is the sukkah roof and spelled
samech-chof-chof. A shlock is placed on the schoch to protect the sukkah from
the rain.

Shlock, of course, also means a stroke.

I am writing a paper about language in Shakespeare's "Merchant of Venice".
Does anyone of you know whether there is a Yiddish translation of the play?
I know that the Yiddish theatre in Moskow performed "King Lear", did they also
do a production of the Merchant?

Thank you very much for your help.
