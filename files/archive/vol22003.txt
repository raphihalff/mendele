1) Date: May 25
Subject: poyer/know-it-all

Jules Levin (Mendele Vol. 22.001) asks about the etymology of "poyer," "peasant." It 
comes from the German word "Bauer," also meaning "peasant."

Barbara Krasner, in the same issue of Mendele, asks about a Yiddish term for "know-it-
all." The word would be "kolboynik."

Subject: know-it-all
Date: June 3

The closest I can think of for a "know it all" is a "groyser makher."  Also, I believe that a 
groyser kapelush (a formal hat which was commonly worn by a gentleman back in the 
thirties) makher also means something similar.

Subject: know-it-all

Barbara Krasner inquired (April 26, 2012; Mendele Vol 22.001) about ways to express 
the idea of a "know-it-all" or "pompous ass." One way to describe a pedant is by using 
ONBLOZN ZIKH (VI AN INDIK) "to puff oneself up (like a peacock/male guinea 
fowl)." ER BLOZT ZIKH ON (VI AN INDIK) 
AN ONGEBLOZENER

I would suggest "a gantser meyvn."

Subject: reb(b)e

The spelling is a moot point, although in YIVO transliteration is would be rebe. Both 
vowels are pronounced. The reason why the word is sometimes transliterated with two 
b's is that it is of Hebrew origin, and in Hebrew, the b has a dagesh, which indicates a 
doubling of the letter, or in this case a "hard"pronunciation (i.e. B not V).

Subject: lekakh

I don't know the song, but a quick Google search brings up the expression, e.g. at 
http://inmolaraan.blogspot.co.uk/2005/10/blog-post_26.html

Lekakh, in this case is the Hebrew word for lesson (esp. a moral lesson) rather than 
Lekekh, honey cake.

Subject: "Glikl Hameln" sought

Hello folks,

I teach a monthly Yiddish Tish in Sonoma County, California. I wanted to bring in a text 
specimen from Glikl of Hamlin. I've been hunting on line, but have only been able to find 
her words in translation - including one translation into "modern Yiddish."

Does anyone have an idea about where I can look to find an excerpt in the original, either 
online (yay!) or for purchase (okay, fine)?

A dank.

Subject: announcement of translation website

Hello friends,

I've waited for a long time for somebody to start a site like this and finally decided to do 
it myself. It's just a few days old.

http://yiddishintranslation.com

I want to collect all historic and current translations of Yiddish books into English at this 
site, and if the translations are currently available, either for sale or for free online, I will 
link to those purchase opportunities. Eventually I will add a search mechanism and
also the names of the Yiddish works in standard YIVO transliteration but for now, if you 
have a list of English translations of Yiddish books, or have done some yourself or know 
somebody who has, please let me know at jane@mappamundi.com and I will add them to 
my list, which is very short so far!

If you know of someone who has already done this work please let me know - I would 
like to avoid duplicating others' efforts.

I would also be happy to add a section for translations which are in progress. My main 
concern is for potential translators to avoid duplicating efforts when there are so many 
wonderful works that have never seen the light of day in English.

Subject: identifying Yidl mitn fidl, Elyakum mitn bas

Dear Researchers!

In the Rakov Yizkor book my mother's uncle, Yehuda Lifshitz, tells the following  story: 

"I had two uncles, my father's brothers. Both of them were, during their
time, famous musicians. One of them was Yudl Lifshitz. I am named after him. He was a 
famous violinst and a conductor in the Nikolaiv regiment of Kiev. The other brother was 
Josef Lifshitz. He was maestro of many musical instruments. He got, at the time, the prize 
of the conservatorium of St. Petersburg for composing a famous music. It is a tradition in 
our family that the song "Yudl with the Violin, Elyakim with the Bass" is a composition 
written by Josef Lifshitz about his brother Yudl."

When I searched the internet for the song I found a site in the Hebrew Wikipedia, where 
there is a reference to the song, but the words of the songs are related to Izik Manger.

Does any of the readers have any advice how can I search for the fate of the two 
brothers?
Is there a possibility to verify the story in Kiev Military Orchestra History?
Is there any possibility to verify the part of the story about St. Petersbug Conservatorium?
Any idea is welcomed.

Thanks,
Ruthie Wilnai

Subject: spelling of "tseyakhmert"
Date: May 26

The Yiddish On-Line Dictionary, using Yivo transliteration, writes "tseiakhmert" (one of 
the responses when one types in "upset").  Shouldn't this be "tseyakhmert"?
