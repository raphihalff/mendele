Subject: Shem zikh in dayn vaytn haldz

I received a number of feedback comments about my post on the above
subject (6.082), interestingly enough several from Mendele khavertes who
personally experienced in their girlhood this type of tongue-lashing.
And I thought that there was a clear gender differentiation and that
only boys who acted like _mazi'kim_ [mischievously] suffered such
humiliation.

One member of the khavruse wrote that to the best of his recollection
Maurice Samuel, in his book _In Praise of Yiddish_ briefly discussed the
same subject of haldz [neck, throat] and shame.

In response to my suggestion that he post it to _Mendele_ with the _page
number_ as reference, he advised me that he searched for the book in his
library for about half-an-hour, and then suddenly remembered that he
lent the book to a friend, but that it was never returned.

Well, this bears out an old maxim of mine, stipulated from   lessons of
personal experience, that when giving a good book, indeed a treasured
book, on a loan basis to a friend, the book is suddenly afflicted with a
strange but specific case of amnesia -- it does not remember the return
address...

[Regarding Miki Safadi's query (6.084)]:

Es iz take nisht faran a groise untershid tsvishn di dray verter; efsher
iz di gringste (oyb nisht di beste) veg tsu gebn bayshpiln velkhe nutsn
di verter: Ikh denk az dos iz a gute frage. Ikh prubir klern vegn a gutn

Subject: Conjunctions

Around the year 180 C.E. in the dark time of Jewish annihilation by
Roman conquerors, a small remnant of Jewish scholars (tannaim) gathered
at a study site, Bene-Berak, to remember, to learn, to save our
heritage.

Could they have envisioned how their intimate voices would reverberate
from Bene-Berak through the centuries that followed?  How those fiercely
cool, passionate conversations among Rabbi Akiva and his friends were to
inspire future generations as they stumbled and dispersed throughout the
world?

Since May 15, 1991 C.E. as our death-haunted century staggers to its
close, a small remnant of Yiddish scholars gather at the study site
Mendele, to remember, to learn, to save our heritage.

Guided by shames Reb Noyekh, these Yiddish tannaim embrace the
Mame-loshn with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  With every living word
they breathe life back to the gasping Yiddish Tongue, the root soul of
our folk for the past thousand years.

                    *      *      *      *      *

I was half a lifetime late in discovering my need to learn Yiddish.
Since 1970 I have felt my way with dictionaries, books, recordings,
favorite pages from the "Forvitz", but remote from contacts with whom to
share a yiddish word, to discuss or consult for a meaning, a phrase, a
subtlety.

So you may understand my amazement and joy when, to celebrate my 80th
birthday (10/8/96) my son led me onto the Internet Highway... and
there... and there...  kinderlakh, ver tref ihk dort?

Dort geyt der balibte zeydele, Mendele Moykher Sforim!  Geyt er a
freylekher, oyf di pleytzes shlept er a groys pekl, zayn likhtik ponem
balaykhtent ingantzn di hashamayim sound bytes.

"Sholem aleikhem Mendele, tayer zeydele, vos makht a yid?  Gevald, vos
tustu do, oyf derekh internet?"

"Aleichem Sholem, tayere kind...  un vos tu ikh do nit?   Adu-o bin ikh

"Nadir, nadir, kind mayns!  Nemzshe fun mayn pekl vos du vilst! Haynt,
morgn, ale teg derlang ikh mayne bendlekh!"

"Oy, Mendele, tayer zeydenyu, itst tantst zikh mir freylekhs in hartsn".

Subject: Amol iz a nets nisht ver vi a reshime

In recent months well-meaning but computer-innocent friends of Mendele
have spread the word that we are something called a "Mendele Network".
Others talk of "Mendele Online".  Sounds as though we're all tied
together (geknipt un gebindn?) in some wonderful way and that messages
from one reaches others instantly and in some magical way.  One writer in
the Forward even recommended that those wishing to get in touch with
someone "Mendelize" him, an act that sounds positively aggressive if not
obscene but is in any case impossible.

None of this is remotely true.  Mendele is nothing more than a mailing
list ("list" for short).  People write, the shames puts the posts
together, and the result winds up on your screens as e-mail.  No one is
in touch with anyone in the sense that "net" would suggest.

I mention this now because there has been a recent rash of messages from
(mostly) new subscribers which, being personal or of no interest to
Mendelists at large, ought properly to have been sent directly to the
person being addressed.  That is why the From: address is _always_
there.  The shames has no streamlined way way of getting your messages
to where they should have gone; quite the contrary: it's _harder_ for
him to redirect messages than it is for senders to take the simple step
of using the address that's given.

B'kitser, would you please help your shames in this matter?  A sheynem
un hartsikn dank aykh.
