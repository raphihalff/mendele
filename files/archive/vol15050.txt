Subject: pushke

The origin of the Southern Yiddish word "pishke" (standard Yiddish
"pushke") is Slavic--as signaled by the final unstressed -e-- which has 
long been lost in Yiddish words of German origin (except in several modern 
borrowings like "dame," "pyese." Other Yiddish words that end in -e are of 
Slavic origin: tate, mame, bobe, zeyde.
If I may be permitted a slightly off-color, but relevant joke:

Me shmekt fin a pishkele, un me pisht fin a shmekele.

Subject: pushke

John Burke asked (15.048) about the word "pushke"  ("pishke" in southern 
Yiddish). In Polish "puszka" refers to any tin can, but also more 
specifically to a tin collection box.

A Yiddish proverb that rhymes in Ukrainian or Polish Yiddish
characterizes the effects of living on charity: Az me lebt fin der
pishke, iz leydik/laydik di kishke (When you live from the charity box,
your belly is empty.)  In klal-shprakh there would be no rhyme, only
assonance: Az me lebt fun der pushke, iz leydik di kishke

Subject: kasha varnishkes


Regarding Khavertorn Lyba's post:

a) It had slipped my mind that I had made the offer of providing the full 
text to "Soroka Vorona" before.

b) Her comment on "varnishkes" as a stand-alone word intrigues me, because 
cannot recollect hearing it in my household, where 'knaydlakh' were de 
rigueur. And I too, am a Litvak....

Nevertheless, it is instructive, because if you probe the underlying 
Russian root, you run into "var" which connotes all manner of boiling. So 
in my prior message, where I pointed to the word "kashevar, that being a 
Russian army regimental cook, it would appear that this person might have 
been a "kasha boiler," which is not unreasonable.

What intrigues me is whether "kashe varnishkes" is the composite that
Khavertorn Lyuba suggests (pretty likely), or an extension of "kashevar" 
into kashevarnishkes as I suggested (not unreasonable).

I wonder if there is a good way to analyze this question?

Subject: kashe varnishkes

Lyuba Dukker wrote that in her family "varnishkes were dumplings" and
also referred to the song "Varnishkes" sung by Nekhama Lifshitz. I can't 
speak for her family, but the usual term for the dumplings she refers to 
is "varnitshkes," and that is the title of the song published by Y.-L. 
Cahan and Moyshe Beregovski (see the Mloteks' "Songs of Generations," pp. 
122-3). As for the expression "kashe varnishkes," I proposed an etymology 
in Mendele 3.132 (November 15, 1993).

about ordering a CD of "Budowitz: Wedding Without a Bride" with Majer 
Bogdanski as badkhen, visit:

Subject: Heavenly footstools

Another instance of heavenly footstools might be of interest.  Isaiah
66:1 reads, "Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth 
is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is 
the place of my rest?" (KJV)  Here the meaning of "footstool" (Heb. "hadom 
ruglai") is positive, too.

Subject:  Opatoshu's name

A hunch, and only a hunch, re Yosef Opatovski's adopting the pseudonym 
"Yosef Opatoshu":

"Opatovski" indicates his people were originally from the Polish town 
Opato'w (Yiddish:  Apt; cf. the other toponymic family name, Apter, such 
as that of the Yiddish novelist Shimshn Apter).

The Polish suffix -owski indicates the name bearer is 'of those people, 
from that place.'  The suffix -shu may be the Yiddish rendition (i.e. 
Yiddish speakers' pronunciation and Yiddish transliteration) of the Polish 
suffix of endearment -siu (cf. Polish:  mamusiu 'mommy', tatusiu 'daddy'). 
(In modern Yiddish among speakers of the so-called "Polish" dialect, this 
is the suffix -shi in "mameshi, tateshi, khaneshi" 'mommy, daddy, little 
Khane/Hannah.')

Dan Opatoshu, Yosef's grandson whose name this now is (and not a 
pseudoname!) -- do you know anything further?

Subject:  Opatoshu's name

In response to Yakira Frank's query, Joseph Opatovsky had an older brother 
who aspired to be a writer.  When Joseph later first began to write, he 
adopted the pen name Opatoshu so as not to step on his brother's toes. 
Unfortunately, his older brother's literary output consisted of only a few 
pieces of journalism in Poland.  As far as I know, there was no 
significance to the choice of shin-vov as suffix other than that he liked 
the sound of the name.  Of course, to a Yiddish reader the pronunciation 
of Opatoshu is clear and phonetic, and not as confounding as it seems to 
be in English transliteration.  My grandfather, grandmother, father and 
mother had the family surname legally changed to Opatoshu in New York 
shortly before my birth in 1947, so that my birth certificate would read 
Opatoshu, which had long been used in all but "official state" matters 
(i.e. my
father served in WW2 as "David Opatovsky," although he had used Opatoshu 
in his acting career from the age of sixteen, and Opatoshu was the name on 
all mail boxes and stationary).

Hope this helps,
Dan Opatoshu
