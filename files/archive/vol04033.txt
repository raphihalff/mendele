Dear Khaver Noyekh,

        Please explain how your proposed biographical dictionary of the
world of Yiddish letters would differ from the multivolume "Leksikon fun
der yidisher literatur"?

Subject: Yiddish and German(s)

I was very gratified to see Mark Devlin's thoughtful posting on Yiddish
and German. The linguistic points especially interested me.

My readings on the origin of standard Hochdeutsch and also of Yiddish
place them, coinidentally, both in Middle East Franconia. This was a
"colonial" area in the early days of German and Jewish eastward
migration. It drew from many dialects in the mixed bag of German
dialects, as Mark pointed out. The fact that Yiddish and German seem so
close has to do with their "origin" in the same area. You go South and
Yiddish clearly seems closer to Standard German. Both, also, include a
heavy overlay of Bavarian. I called my brother in Germany this weekend,
who boards with a peasant couple in Bavaria. I tried desperately to
communicate with them, then suddenly realized that it might be easier if
I treated the speech as a dialect of Yiddish (I issued that instruction
into my brain). I was amazed and delighted to hear that my brother was
not "heimgekimen" (should be "nach Hause gekommen". There it was, the
German version of "er iz nit gekumen aheym".

The only area, as I understand what I've read,that contributed to German
but not to Yiddish is the Low German area. German is full of doublets:
Waffen = weapons; Wappen = coat of arms.

The attitudes that I've surveyed among both German Jews and non-Jews is
that "Yiddish is not a language". That comes partly from the
psychological stuff Mark talked about. There's one other possibility, and
that is that Mayrev Yiddish went through a profound change during the
19th century. The German component of the Yiddish dialects was superseded
by local Gentile patois. What was left is what some writers call
"Juedisch-Deutsch", i.e. German with many Romance and loshn-koydesh
elements used in Jewish contexts, or in certain heavily Jewish
occupations such as cattle- and horse-trading. However, once you get out
of Germany proper and go, let's say to Switzerland, the full, original
dialect still obtains. It resembles standard German much more than the
local Schwyzerduutsch patois (from which it has borrowed almost nothing).
So, to come back to Juedisch-Deutsch; Germans view this as a set of
colorful expressions, but they recognize that these alone do not
constitute a language. So there's a real confusion about Yiddish,
Juedisch-Deutsch, and Jewish speech. Hearing Jews speaking
Juedisch-Deutsch confuses the listener, who calls it "Yiddish" and
concludes that these peppered phrases are an in-group slang and
definitely not a language. Even Heinrich Heine was confused, since he
deplored the "condition of the Polish Jews' German".

Matt Dailey:

I hope  that in your research on Tsene-rene you have come across my
article in Vol 51 93-94 of JBA pp.96-111 which offers a different
perception of the Mazorah translation.

Subject: Asch; Glatshteyn

[to Noyekh Miller:]

Regarding your most interesting comment that you were witness to the
change in Sholem Asch, you indicated that the details of that change
might come at some other time.

It is now another time.

I am most curious about Asch because I so enjoyed reading him in the late
40s and throughout the 50s.  And it broke my heart when he disappeared.

A separate point.  You mentioned Glatshteyn.  I have only one of his
poems and I had to have it read to me because I do not read Yiddish.  But
I got it because the title was "Mozart" (a favorite subject of mine) and
I went crazy when I heard it because it displayed such a love of the
composer's music.  Do you know anything about Glatshteyn?  I have tried
to find out if he wrote other poems about Mozart but I can barely find
out anything about him, and thus do not know what his background was, and
from where grew his appreciation of Mozart.

Subject: German Jewish Names

A question for fellow-Mendelniks:

Some time ago, a friend told me that the family name Arlook has a rather
unpleasant origin, namely the German word Arschloch.  Any Mendelniks care
to comment?  Also, I want to thank all those who were kind enough to
follow up on my recent posting re the Yiddish/German connection.
