Subject: Address of Y.L.Peretz Farlag

I am trying to obtain a book published in 1982 by Y.L. Peretz Farlag (in
Tel-Aviv), and am having difficulties finding the address of that
publishing company.  I would be very grateful for suggestions regarding
the finding of their address (and electronic address, if such exists).
Thank you very much.

Subject: Pi, pa, po

I'm struck  by the similarity of "pi, pa, po" to "Fi, Fie, Fo, Fum," the
refrain used in Jack and the Beanstalk and other children's stories and
rhymes. Does anyone care to speculate on this?

Subject: The impact of Lithuanian on Yiddish

Could some subscriber possibly help me find a book by Hackelis
Lemchenas?  It was published in Lithuania in 1970 (in Lithuanian) and
it's about 'the influence of the Lithuanian language on the local
dialect of Yiddish'.  The Lithuanian title of the book translates as the
bit in inverted commas.  I won't bother spelling it out in Lithuanian
just now.  I would be most grateful if someone could tell me where I
could get a second-hand copy of this book, or a photocopy.

Subject: Boston Herald Article: Can Yiddish Survive?

Mendele and its shames were prominently featured today at the front of
the Arts and Lifestyle section of the Boston Herald.  Yes, our own
shames, Noyekh Miller, was most prominently featured with a towering 1/2
page tall by 3 columns wide photo, sitting next to his computer screen
displaying "der yiddisher tam-tam", the web page, in Netscape. Below
this photo was the headline: "Can Yiddish survive?  Experts kibbitz
about uncertain future of the ancient language".

Aaron Lansky and Samuel D. Kassow were quoted as well as shown on the
continuation page in file photos, and Mordkhe Schaechter was also
quoted. The article also referred to Ruth Wisse's "Shule Daze" article,
and quoted from it, but did not offer any new quotation from her.
YiddishNet and Virtual Shtetl got mentions, as did Mendele's "more than
1,000 subscribers in 24 countries".

It was all in all a fairly well done piece.  And balanced: not a wildly
enthusiastic Yiddish-is-blooming kind of thing, but not a yizker service
kind of thing either.

I'm glad to see our shames gain some deserved recognition.  Mendele is
among the world's finest publication about Yiddish Language and
Literature, on paper, in cyberspace, or otherwise, and Noyekh is the
main reason for its great success.
