Subject: Edelstat's "Mayn Tsavoe"

In response to a query re Dovid Edelstat's "Mayn Tsavoe," a good
translation (rousing, rhymed, and rhythmic) is by Aaron Kramer, in his
volume, _A Century of Yiddish Poetry_ [cornwall books, 1989, pp. 60-61].
l'shana tova!

Subject: Dovid Edelshtat

Per Diane Rabson's inquiry, here is Aaron Kramer's translation of _mayn
tsevoe_, as published in "A Century of Yiddish Poetry," selected,
translated and edited by Aaron Kramer, Cornwall Books, Cranbury, NJ,
1989. Kramer's brief biography of dovid edelshtat may also be useful for
her newsletter. I'll be glad to supply Kramer's address for permission
to reproduce his copyrighted work.

My Testament

Oh comrades mine, when I am dead
carry our banner to my grave:
the freedom-banner, flaming red
with all the blood that workers gave.

And there, the while our banner flutters,
sing me my freedom-song again,
my "Battle Song"--that rings like fetters
around the feet of workingmen.

And even in my grave that song,
that stormy song, will reach my ears,
and for my friends enslaved so long
there, too, shall I be shedding tears.

And when I hear a cannon sound
the final siege of want and pain,
my song shall trumpet from the ground
and set the people's heart aflame!

Subject: Umbashri'en, another verbal superstiton

In her recent introduction (6.058,1) Sandi Wisenberg mentioned the
expressions  "umbeshrin/imbishrin" that she heard as a child.  Her
undertstanding that it meant "keynanhore" is correct.   (Keynan(h)ore is
a reference to the evil eye of the _sheydim_, the beyze rukhes [the bad
spirits]).

In standard Yiddish it is spelled and pronounced  _umbashrien_ and is a
superstitious expression of negation.  "Bashri'en" comes from the verb
"shrayen" [talking very loud, yell].   One uses the expression
"umbashri'en" after having spoken, for instance, complimentarily about
an infant, young child , or adult -- about  their beauty, health,
intelligence, or good luck in life -- and then, promptly thereafter,
asserts the hope that one did not speak too loud and that the laudatory
comments did not reach the ears of the evil spirits.  Therefore, not
having heard the good things just uttered about the person, the evil
spirits will not know and will not come after him to "reverse" the
conditions.

The prefix "um-" means _not_.  For example:  Umgeduldik [impatient];
umgliklekh [unhappy];  umbakant [unknown], umbaholfn [helpless],
umshteyns gezogt [belittlement -  "What does he know, umsteyns gezogt;"
also, "mishteyns gezogt" as a verbal warding-off superstition. (See my
post in Mendele "The Compression of an Expression"  (4.213).

In nouns it means the opposite of the original meaning.  For example:
umglik [misfortune];  umkoved [disrespect];  umru [unrest,
apprehension];  ummentsh [brute, barbarian];  umkum [holocaust].

The _um-_ came into Yiddish from German "un-."   Occasionally it can be
replaced with _nit_., for example:   "umfarshtendlekh"
[incomprehensible] --  "nit farshtendlekh."

The expression "umbarufn," found in some dialectal regions of Yiddish,
carries exactly the same superstitious function as "umbashri'en." It
apparently comes from the verb "rufn" -- to  call, to  call  upon.

"Umbarufn" serves the superstitious function of hopefully undoing and
denying what good and complimentary one has just said about a child's or
adult's appearance, good health, and fate in life, and that,
disregarding such mention, one did not "call upon," and thus, khas
vesholem, unintentionally invited the evil spirits to come and harm
them.

For a more comprehensive discussion about superstitious expressions in
Yiddish please see my two posts in Mendele (5.090 and 5.101).
