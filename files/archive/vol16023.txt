Subject: Itche Goldberg's "Eseyen"

John Matthies asks where one can buy a copy of Itche Goldberg's "Eseyen,"
band tsvey. He is also interested to know where one can buy copies of
recently published (i.e., new) books in Yiddish.

CYCO Publishing and Yiddish Book Center sells the above title plus many new
Yiddish Titles and over 40,000 other Yiddish Books.

Subject: kunst/kunts

In Mendele, Vol.16.021, Moshe Taube writes

1. kleinkunst is of course a daytshmerizm, since in Yiddish proper the
first element is kunts, not kunst. In German, Kleinkunstbuehne is the term
for an intimate theater or a cabaret.

In fact, kunst and kunts are both Yiddish words with different meanings.
Kunst is art, and kunts a trick.

Subject: last Yiddish film in Poland

In Mendele, Vol. 16, Feb. 23, it is stated that the last Yiddish movie made
in Poland before the war was "Yidl mitn fidl."  However, the last Yiddish
film made before the war in Poland was based on a 1907 play by Jacob
Gordin, "On a heym", and was adapted into a film called "Without a Home" or
"Homeless."  It was made in 1939, directed by Alexander Martin, and starred
Ida Kaminska.

My book about my great-grandfather's life and times, "Finding the Jewish
Shakespeare: the Life and Legacy of Jacob Gordin," published by Syracuse
University Press, will be launched in early April.  I will be speaking
about the man and the book later in the year at the National Yiddish Book
Center.

Many thanks,
Beth Kaplan

Subject: Last Yiddish film in Poland

"Yidl mitn fidl" was by no means the last film made in Poland before the
war.  In fact, it was the watershed hit that encouraged more Polish-Yiddish
film production for the rest of the 1930s until the Nazi invasion.
Producer/director Joseph Green had been a distributor and saw the potential
for Yiddish film popularity. "Yidl" was his first movie, and he made
several more on location in Poland, including another Molly Picon picture
("Mamele") in 1938 -- which included her theme song, "Abi Gezunt." His last
Polish-location production was "A Brivele der Mamen" in 1939.

J. Hoberman's book "Bridge of Light:  Yiddish Film between Two Worlds" is a
great resource. I worked at the Yiddish film series at MoMA which was tied
to the launch of that wonderful research volume, published in 1991. Many
misconceptions are constantly repeated: "The Dybbuk" was the last Yiddish
film made in Poland is another canard. This was in fact made in 1937, and
has some of the same character actors in supporting roles who also appear
in both Joseph Green films mentioned above. Unlike the Green pictures, "The
Dybbuk" was a solely Polish Yiddish production rather than a Polish-Yiddish
co-production. Dzigan and Schumacher also made (lower-budget) movies during
this post-"Yidl" period: "Freylekhe kaptsonim" comes to mind. Another Green
motion picture was "Der purimshpiler."

Subject: Yiddish film in the USA

In "A Cantor's Son," Moyshe Oysher returns from the Big Apple to Belz,
where he was born, to honor his parents 50th wedding anniversary; the blurb
tells us that all scenes in Belz were filmed in Stroudsberg, in the
Poconos, U.S.A

Peretz Hirshbein's "Grine Felder," which won an Academy Award for Best
Foreign film in 1945, tells of a Warsaw big city yeshiva student who makes
an intense search of the Polish countryside to find a true Jew. The rolling
hills and scenes of greenery, where he discovers true Judaism and his
wife-to-be, were filmed in Pennsylvania, U.S.A.

We didn't do too badly in the States.

Mir dakht zikh (farvos bin ikh nit zikher) az akht un akhtsik iz a
kortnshpil; ven der geviner dergraykht dem tsil, "na dir akht un akhtsik"
iz a sof tsu der shpil.

I believe (not sure why) akht un akhtsik is a card game; when the winner
reaches that goal, "na dir akht un akhtsik." The game or hand is over.

Subject: akht un akhtsik

I have heard this expression. To me it means also something similar to
"a-ha, my cards trump yours!!!" I think its origins are in card game rules
or domino game rules.
