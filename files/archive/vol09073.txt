Subject: Holocaust children's poetry

Tayere Mendelyaners,
I am looking for the Yiddish for the following Holocaust poem, to add
more Yiddish to our annual commemoration of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in
April.  It is called Natasha.  Who is the author? Where and when was it
written? Who is the English translator? What was the fate of the author?

Any information on this poem from the learned readers of Mendele
would be greatly appreciated.

It is twilight. I sit with my dolls by the stove and dream.
I dream that my father came back and will no longer go away.
He comes home from work; he takes me on his knee.
He will tell me stories. He will play with me.

Mamma, mamma, how good it is to have a father.
I don't even know where my father is. Does he remember me?
If only a letter came from him.
Suddenly - there is a knock at the door...
I think - perhaps my father has come back.
I run to the door; I dance; I throw down my dolls!
My heart beats so - I think I hear my father...
A beggar-man is standing at the door!

Any suggestions to include other children's poems of the Holocaust in
Yiddish would also be appreciated (We have Motele, Children's Names, and The
Butterfly).

A sheynem dank un zayt mir ale gezunt un shtark!

Libe Gritz
