Subject: Tsipoyrek

[re: Judith Binder's questions]

Here are my takes: you really should give context to resolve these questions.

1. Tzipyorek

Tsipoyre is a name from Hebrew, I believe, meaning roughly Birdy -a
female name.  -Ek is I believe a Polish name ending.

2. A roite Mogn-Doved fun a lamter - Could anyone tell me what a lantern
like this was ? or what it was used for?

A magn dovid fun a lamtern: a lamp (maybe hanging) in the shape of a star
of david, holding several candles?

3. Elef Hashishi - Where does this term come from?

Elef ha-shishi sounds like Hebrew for the sixth millenium.

4. Lange Einfar-Hoise

Lange einfar-hoise sounds like daytshmerish: see whether there exists a
Grerman word: Einfahrhause.

Good chance I'm completely wrong.

Subject: Tsugetschepet

Tsugetschepet, ongetschepet, tschepest zich tzu, and other variations on
the theme.

In mein mishpoche hot men a sach geredt vegen tschepen zich, and the
theme was negative, in the sense of bothering, hanging on, not leaving
alone, plaguing, etc. I find a possible Russian source in tzepeetsa, to
cling or to hang on. On the other hand, I find no such word in Weinreich.
Surely my family was not alone in this usage. Are there experiences with
such expressions among other Mendelniks?  It could also be used to
express distaste for heterosexual (and unwanted) attentions or even for
picking at one's facial pimples or scabs or for tastelessly decorated
interiors or exteriors. A dank far die velche entferen und a gliklichen
yomtov alemen!

Subject: A better press for Yiddish

Louis Fridhandler (known on the streets as 74064.1661@compuserve.com),
writes:

"Mendele is newsworthy in my opinion, and Yiddish needs better press and
public relations.  IMHO that ought to be an overt goal of a Mendele
convention, or at least a subtext of a Mendele convention."

I am a freelance reporter for National Public Radio as well as a big
Yiddish enthusiast. I agree that mame loshn deserves more intelligent
media coverage.... I planned to make it to the Toronto conference, both
as a reporter and as a private Mendelnik, but, alas, 'twas no go. But I
am going to Boston in February and plan to pitch a story to NPR about the
various Yiddish Radio programs. I was also thinking of doing something on
Mendele itself, if that hasn't already been done and if the listening
audience can stand yet another "oh-those-nutty-folks-on-the-internet"
story. Anyway, if anyone would like to participate in any of these
stories, or if anyone has any Menele of general Yiddish news items, they
should feel free to zap me in my furnished, charming, private AOL
mailbox, or they can always post-it, too.

Subject: Mishteyns gezogt

"(im/mi/m)shtejns" even "nishtejns gezogt

A propos of Zellig Bach's reference to this expression:
"(im/mi/m)shtejns" even "nishtejns" gezogt, (with Central Yiddish [ay]
and Western Yiddish [a:]), is one of several Yiddish expressions that can
drive husband and wife in a dialectally mixed marriage up the wall. It
has two distinct meanings, (their distribution soon to be plotted).
Wherever the two meanings co-occur, they're probably best distinguished
by intonation. Test your native speaking informants with the following
(and, if you like, report their responses and place of birth).

1. It functions as an expression of pity, "er iz krank, mishteyns
gezogt" much like "nitO(p)gedakht" or "nisht af mir/dir gezogt".
This is surely its historical function, a warding-off expression;
i.e., "may it not be said of/happen to me/you, may it be said
of/happen to the stone".

2. It functions as an expression of contempt: "a krankheit, mishteyns
gezogt" = "oykh mir a krankheit" 'You call that a sickness?'

Subject: Western Yiddish folksongs

To supplement Dovid Braun's recent posting, I have

a) a tape of the late Florence Guggenheim-Gruenberg of Zurich singing
"kumt der liber shpeysignakht" (= shabeysenakht)

b) a copy of a tape made by FG-G of someone singing a well-known Western
Yiddish lovesong "Sheynele".

Both may also be available in the sound archives of the Swiss
Phonogramarchiv.

The words to "Sheynele" are included in a work on "Alsatian Yiddish" by
Arnold Zivy.

c) a recording, which I made myself, of Arnold Zivy singing part of a
comic operetta about "shatshen Joule" (= shadkhn Yoel), a recurring
figure in Western Yiddish, which he performed at the 1st Zionist Congress
in Basle in 1897! I made the recording in 1961, in NY when Zivy visited,
at age 80, on the occasion of his granson's Bar Mitsva. I don't know
whether this was ever recorded anywhere else.

Subject: Mendele's biographical note

[A paragraph of Zellig's earlier post was missing.  Here is the complete
text.]

Maurice Samuel wrote (_In Praise of Yiddish_, p. 117):

"In his boyhood [Mendele] was shanghaied by a master-beggar, who
exhibited him as an _ilui_ (a scholar-prodigy.)"

Mendele was reputed to know by age 10 the entire _tanakh_ by  heart.

I was intrigued by the term "shanghaied" and checked this particular
detail in the _lexikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur_, published by
the alveltlekher yidisher kultur kongres, N.Y. (vol. VI, 1965).

The 17-tear-old Mendele was fascinated by the stories of a local beggar
who traveled in his horse-drawn wagon from one Jewish community to
another.  In these stories Jewish life in Lithuania, Podolye, and other
parts of South Russia was attractive enough to catch Mendele's fancy, and
he joined him on his next trip.  It was apparently also a means of
breaking away from a highly impoverished home with six siblings and a
widowed mother.

The name of the beggar was "avreml der hinkediker" who later became the
prototype and main character of Mendele's famous work _Fishke der
Krumer_.

Mendele partook in the food that the beggar managed to scrounge together,
and they slept in synagogues, naturally free of charge.

In one town the beggar tried to marry Mendele off to a daughter of a rich
man who was a "balebos" in the literal meaning of the words "ba'al
ha'bayis" because he was, indeed, the owner of a house.  The beggar hoped
to receive a pretty penny as marriage broker.

Mendele's refusal to go through with this plan immensely angered the
beggar, and he started to pressure him into paying for "transportation
and upkeep" going back to the start of the trip.

The beggar's demands and pressures for Mendele's "room and board," a
misnomer if there ever was one considering the conditions in which the
boy lived, grew louder and harsher.  The sensitive youngster experienced
them as soul-searing, and one day he left his so-called "benefactor" and
walked many miles to the town of Kamenyets where he hoped to get help
from a relative. Unfortunately, the relative was out of town: he was a
member of a choir with the khazn of Kamenyets and happened to be away on
a cantorial tour.  Hopeless and despaired, he returned to the beggar as
his only support in the whole world.  Finally --

Fate smiled upon Mendele.  Several weeks later he managed, during one of
the trips, to come across a distant relative who, when heard of the young
man's plight, met the beggar's demand and thus paid "ransom" for
Mendele's freedom.
