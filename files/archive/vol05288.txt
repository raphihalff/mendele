Shleyme,

I think that your speculation at the end [5.284] is right.

The sof at the end of the word is, of course, the standard spelling in Hebrew.
Thus the Ashkenazic Hebrew model that went into Yiddish was surely _bes_ or
_beys_. ( In Sephardic Hebrew and thus in Modern Israeli Hebrew it is _bet_.)
The pronunciation [bejz] mmust have arisen through assimilation of the final
fricative to the voicing of the following initial voiced [g], a phenomenon
that is attested for at least some varieties of Yiddish. (Indeed, I have heard
it in the Yiddish-accented English of some people who voie the final voiceless
consonant of an English word before a following voiced consonant. It might
happen in something like "washboard." Through a kind of back formation, then,
Yddish speakers may have lexicalized the name of the second letter as [bejz]
as a result of frequent repetition of the alphabet, perhaps in teaching
children.

That is, I would guess that speakers got so used to this recitation that they
put it into their mental lexical store as _beyz_, but knowing the spelling of
it and the "standard" pronunciation of it in their Ashkenazic Hebrew, they
might vacillate between the two pronunciations.

Uriel Weinreich, whom I knew well, was certainly well versed not only in his
native Yiddish but also in Ashkenazic Hebrew.

Mikhl Herzog may have a better explanation of Uriel's inconsistent spelling in
addition to a better explanation of the phenomenon.

Subject: beys oder beyz?

The discrepancy in U. Weinreich's names for 'beyz', which Shleyme Axelrod has
brought to general attention, touches on one of the puzzles of voicing
consonantism among the names of the Yiddish letters. Alongside 'beyz' where
the Hebrew spelling would lead us to expect 'beys', we also find (not
surprisingly) 'veyz'. There is also 'daled', where Hebrew spelling points to
'dales', or at least 'dalet' and 'tof'(& 'sof'), rather than the 'tov' which
spelling indicates. These peculiarities are pretty widespread in Northeastern
and Southeastern Yiddish. The form 'reyz' (which in the standard spelling
would be reyzh) is also found in Northeastern Yiddish.

Subject: "Fishke the Lame" and Abramovitsh's Yiddish

Mark Shechner asked [5.287] if _Fishke the Lame_ has ever been translated into
English before the forthcoming translation in the "Library of Yiddish
Classics", to be published by Schocken Books this Summer. This is indeed the
case. The translation by Gerald Stillman was published in 1960 by Thomas
Yoseloff, New York and reprinted in _Selected Works of Mendele
Moykher-Sforim_, Ed. Marvin Zuckerman, Gerald Stillman, Marion Herbst (Malibu,
Calif.: Joseph Simon/Pangloss Press, 1991).

For secondary material on Abramovitsh's literary Yiddish, you could consult
Dan Miron's _A Traveler Disguised_ which has just been reprinted by Syracuse
University Press, and Ken Frieden's _Classic Yiddish Fiction_ (Albany, State
University of New York Press, 1995). Both books contain the information you
are looking for and much more.

In addition, they have extensive bibliographies for further reading (Frieden's
book has a listing of all English translations of works by Abramovitsh, Sholem
Aleichem and Peretz). I believe Miron and Frieden are the editors of the new
translation; because of their knowledge of Mendele's work, one would presume
that they have chosen a translation which does Mendele's style justice.

Subject: De Lange and Fishke der Krumer

Mark Shechner asked [5.287] about a booklet written by Nicholas De Lange. A
plausible option:

AUTHOR:  De Lange, N. R. M. (Nicholas Robert Michael), 1944-
TITLE:   Reflections of a translator
IMPRINT: Cincinnati : Judaic Studies Program, University of Cincinnati, 1993
FORMAT:  24 p. ; 23 cm.
SERIES:  The Sixteenth Annual Rabbi Louis Feinberg memorial lecture
[The closest to Buffalo owners are Cornell and Touro College libraries].

Mendele's Fishke Der Krumer was published in English at least once: Fishke the
lame, London : S.Paul, 1928, 224p. [In NY a copy is owned by Queens Coll Lib].

One of the works on language in Fishke is Sol Feinman's thesis "Mendele's
Fishke der krumer in Yiddish and in Hebrew", 1977, 135p., [available from
University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, Mich.]
