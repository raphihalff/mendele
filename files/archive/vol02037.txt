And then there is the question:

What comes between fear and sex?

The answer, of course, is ......... funf.

just in the last few months, i've inadvertently caused a
misunderstanding with yinglish 'shtup'. on the LINGUIST
electronic net, i joined a discussion about closing down
linguistics depts and i said that one reason might be that,
since linguists tend to have more interdepartmental ties
than the average academic, they are easier to shtup into
other departments. all i meant was 'shove/cram, esp.
shove/cram into a place where there is some resistance,
where the fit isn't perfect'. well, i got three replies
indicating i was understood as using shtup in a
(metaphoric) sexual sense! they read it as 'fucked over'
*by* the other departments! don't ask me how...

for the record, it was used in my house in both senses. the
'shove/cram' sense required a directional locative, whereas
the sexual sense simply took a direct object--'he shtupped
her' vs. 'he shtupped her into the bus'. the nominalization
'a shtup' was almost always sexual and usually preceded by
'good', e.g. 'what she needs is a good shtup.' in the rare
instances that it wasn't sexual, it was usually preceded by
'little', as in 'give it a little shtup', for example when
two people are fixing something together and one wants the
other to ease some part of the object into some other part.

as long as we're on misunderstandings and 'dirty words',
i've recently discovered that 'shmuck' seems to have
changed meanings, at least from the one that i knew. for
me, a schmuck is a fool. for many americans, esp gentiles
and young jews, a schmuck is a bastard, a nasty person. i
discovered this in the course of an e-mail correspondence
with a friend (female, gentile, late 40s). at one point, i
wrote that i'd just paid full price for a floor sample
couch and added 'what a schmuck i am!' she wrote back,
'*you*'re not the schmuck--the salesman is!' i got all
excited, thinking she discovered something clever about my
act, and wrote back asking her what it was. total breakdown
in communication. finally, we figured out that we had
different senses of 'schmuck'. i then did an informal
e-mail survey and discovered the two senses are alive and
well--'fool' being the sense most used by older jews, esp
from ny, and 'bastard' being the sense most used by
gentiles, jews from the midwest/west, and younger jews from
all over. i imagine there have been *many*
misunderstandings because of this that have never been
caught (adding, no doubt, to the image of jews as
'abrasive'!).

That's all we use it for.  Of course, the Yiddish spoken in
our family is not yet at the level where the alternative
meaning would be understood; but I don't expect our use of
shtupn (shtipn, in our dialect) to change.

We also use "boykh" (two syllables) for stomach, and "opl"
(pronounced "upl" bay uns) for navel.

(We speak only Yiddish to our kids -- now aged 8, 6, 3 and
1.5 -- and we don't permit them to speak English to each
other or to us; but my wife and I use only English with
each other.  It's an interesting home environment -- I know
instantly, when Simone speaks, whether she's addressing me
or the kids, depending on which language she uses.  Ditto
her with me.

According to my father,"In Rige flegt men zogen 'seksuele
ferkehr'" for sexual intercourse. Even as I type, I hear
some otherwise intelligent and decent people muttering
"Daitshmerish!"

The discussion of Yiddish words for sexual intercourse
reminded me of a story of a nine-year-old student who came
upon the term "biyah" in a Mishnaic discussion and asked
its meaning. His m'lamed, not wishing to explain the "birds
and bees" to such a youth defined it as, "vus ich hab; vus
dan tutte hut; und vus di, az di vet gevein genug elter; di
vet hab'n oichet." "Ah!" the young fellow exclaimed," a
killeh!!" P.S. I would be most pleased if any experienced
Yidishists would translate my little musings into real
Yiddish.
