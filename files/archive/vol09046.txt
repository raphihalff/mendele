Subject: Additions to Mendele's home page

Not long ago readers were promised that the texts on The Mendele Review's
web page would be speedily "restored" from their romanized form into
alef-beys.  While the conversion took longer than expected, almost all of
them are now ready.  For your convenience they're available for browsing at
http://www2.trincoll.edu/~mendele/read.htm.  (This page is still being built
and I hope that readers will overlook its crude appearance.) 

Most of the PDF files are "first generation" and they're huge. Matt Fisher,
a man of many talents, taught me how to achieve both a neater appearance and
much smaller file-size.  Some of these second generation files have replaced
the older ones.  See for instance Rokhl Korn's "fun yenem zayt lid" or Alter
Kacyzne's "der shidekh in partsev". 

More recently, Yannis Haralambous, a friend of Mendele and a professional
typesetter, has volunteered to convert our Yiddish texts using book-quality
fonts.  Some of these, (Mendele Moykher Sforim's "der baybak"; Sholem
Aleykhem's "dos porfolk" and two chapters from Motl-Peyse) are already
available. In time we hope all of Mendele's Yiddish texts will be of that
quality. [Technical note: you're likely to get the best results after
installing a free copy of Adobe Acrobat Reader 4.0.]

The original transcriptions were done by Leonard Prager, Leah Krikun, Lucas
Bruyn, Craig Abernethy and Itsik Goldenberg.  Without their hard work there
would be nothing. We're especially lucky that someone like Leonard Prager,
with his encyclopedic knowledge of Yiddish literature, headed up the
project.  The texts he found are not only gems but forgotten gems. 

Refoyl Finkel's magic device, the yidishe shraybmashinke, was the second
indispensable ingredient; it would otherwise have been necessary to key in
the Yiddish texts.  But since most Hebrew words get pronounced quite
differently once they've become naturalized, the Niborski/Neuberg
_verterbuch fun loshn-koydersh-shtamike verter in yidish_ was used often;
tattered and reglued it remains a great pleasure to read and use. 

   ***

What's ahead?  One project involves annotating the TMR Yiddish texts to make
reading easier for those Mendelists who are serious about Yiddish but could
use a little help. A major project, Project Onkelos, is still in the
planning phase but will be announced soon. 

Needless to say, more hands will get the job done a lot faster.  If you
would like to help, please get in touch with me at
mailto:nmiller@trincoll.edu. 

Stay tuned.  Things are looking up for the Yiddish word!

From: "Mikhl Herzog" <mherzog@bestweb.net>
Subject: Gender in Lodzher Yiddish 

Feygl Glezer was quite right to point out my error. _puter_ is, indeed, a
feminine not a neuter noun. I was simply hypercorrecting: since substance
names and mass nouns (e.g. _broyt_, _vaser_ ) are usually neuter in Standard
Yiddish. Still, Feygl is wrong to write what she calls "DE" (= di) and "DE"
(= der, where "r" is dropped) as equivalents. For a native of the Lodzh
area, and others who bother to listen, the two unstressed vowels in question
are quite distinct, and should be represented differently, say as "de=der"
and "d@=di". 

Furthermore, no native Lodzher would say _mit de(r) piter arup_ (again, 
except in Standard Yiddish). In Lodzher Yiddish, there is no case 
distinction in the feminine article:  it is nominative/accusative _d@ 
pite_ and  dative _mit d@ pite arup. And note that the final unstressed 
vowels of "d@" and "pite" are quite different.

Af dem darf zikh afile a Lodzher efsher oykh geyn lernen.

Mikhl Herzog


P.S.  A TRUE Litvak would, of course, be expected to say _di puter_ BUT
_mitn puter arop_, NOT _mit di puter arop_ or _mit der puter arop_.
Similarly, almost all inanimate nouns which have nominative _di_; e.g. _di
hant/mitn hant_, _di fus/mitn fus_. Since Litvish Yiddish has NO neuter
gender, most traditionally neuter nouns also fall into this category which
has been designated the "intermediate gender". Thus, _di bet_ BUT _untern
bet_. 

For more on this subject, see:
Meyer Wolf: "Yiddish case & gender variation," in The Field of Yiddish 
III, 102-215. Mouton & Co. 1969.
Uriel Weinreich. The seven genders of yiddish." Read before the LSA, 
Chicago, 1961.
Marvin Herzog. The Yiddish Language in Northern Poland: Its Geography & 
History. Bloomington, 1965.

Mikhl Herzog

P.P.S.  Actually, the _di_ nouns in Litvish Yiddish fall into 3 (perhaps
subregionally varying) gender categories: 

True Feminine:  Nom/Accus: di mame/di bobe; Dative: tsu der 
mame(n)/bobe(n)
Mass:               Nom/Accus/Dative:  di vaser
Intermediate:     Nom/Accus: di hant/di vant/di tir; Dative (post 
prepositional): i) with prepositional contraction: mitn hant/afn 
vant/tsum tir; ii) without prepositional contraction: mit der hant/af 
der vant/tsu der tir.

Note: Prepositions with True Feminine and Mass nouns do not permit
contraction.  Intermediate Nouns are, historically, inanimate feminine or
neuter nouns. 

No more, I promise.

Subject: Abraham Shulman  manuscripts         

Three years ago I was doing research on the Singer family (Esther, I.J., and
Bashevis)' and Dr. Dovid Katz told me that Abraham Shulman had written an
English book about the family.  I wrote to Shulman, and he said his
manuscript was as yet unpublished.  The text of his handwritten note to me
of June 11, 1996, follows:  "Khoshover Fraynd Katz-Handler, Ikh dank aykh
far ayer brivl, vos kh"hob derhaltn durkhn FORVERTS.  Layder kon ikh aykh
nit shikn vos ir hot gevolt.  Kh"hob farshidene manuskriptn vegn der familie
Zinger -- ober layder zaynen zey nisht geven gedrukt.  Efsher amol in der

From: David Mazower <dmazower@yahoo.com>
Subject: Yosl Cotler

Marti Krow-Lucal asks for information about the life of the artist and
puppeteer Yosl Cotler [Kotler]. According to J Hoberman's book on Yiddish
film, "Bridge of Light" (New York, 1991, pp 351-3), Kotler was born in a
shtetl in Volhynia in 1896, emigrated to the USA aged fifteen and began
selling shoelaces from a pushcart in Hester Street. After some time earning
his living as a sign painter, he began working as a cartoonist for the Morgn
Frayhayt newspaper. In the mid 1920s, he joined forces with fellow artist
Zuni Maud (another intriguing figure and a prolific illustrator of American
Yiddish books) and the painter Jack Tworkov to present Yiddish puppet plays
in a loft on the East Side.  He died in a car crash in 1935, while heading
for California to raise money for a Yiddish puppet film based on Ansky's
play "The Dybbuk".  According to Hoberman, his funeral was attended by some
10,000 people.

For more information on Kotler's work in the Yiddish theatre, see David
Lifson's book, "The Yiddish Theatre in America", (New York, 1965).  Lifson
quotes the eminent theatre designer Boris Aronson recalling that Kotler's
puppet company was the finest Yiddish theatre he had ever seen - nisht kayn
kleynikeyt!

There is also an entry for Kotler's MADJAKOT theatre in Zylbertsvayg's
Leksikon (fun yidisn teater), vol 2, p 1210. This lists a number of reviews
of the company in the Yiddish press. 

I agree completely with Marti Krow-Lucal's assessment:  Kotler was a
brilliantly gifted artist and political cartoonist (as well as a writer,
poet, puppeteer and designer).  Both he and fellow-bohemian Zuni Maud did
some of their best work as illustrators for American Yiddish books. In
Kotler's case, I am aware of the following Yiddish books illustrated by him: 

1. Moshe Leib Halpern, "Di goldene pave", Cleveland, 1924
2. Noyekh Steinberg, "Kritik", New York, 1926 
3. Herman Gold, "Mayselekh", New York, 1928
4. A.M.Katz, "Dos telerl fun himl", New York, 1934
5. Yosl Kotler, "Muntergang", New York, 1934

Yosl Kotler's work surely deserves to be better-known (and if anyone knows
of a decent biography of him, I too would love to hear of it). But his
neglect is not an isolated case - the whole area of 20th-century American
Yiddish graphic work and book illustration seems to me to have received
remarkably little attention from scholars - with the possible exception of
William Gropper.  Apart from anything else, a comprehensive illustrated
guide to the subject would make a stunning glossy volume for an enterprising
publisher.

Subject: Yosl Cotler

The YIVO Institute for Jewish Research has artwork by Yosl Cotler (referred
to in YIVO materials as Cutler) in its art collection (RG 101). They may
also have other material related to the artist in other collections,
particularly those to do with the Morgn Frayhayt, the newspaper for which
Cotler did cartoons. 

See also the Appendix in J. Hoberman's Bridge of Light: Yiddish Film Between
Two Worlds for an account of Kutlers Marionetn, a 1935 Yiddish short
featuring Cotler's puppets. Page 351 has some biographical info about the
artist..
