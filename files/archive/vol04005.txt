Subject: Fonye ganef

In Mendele 4.003 Aren Portnoy asks about the origin of fonye and fonye
ganef as terms for the tsar.  I believe it was an opprobrious term for
any Russian who was automatically considered a hater of Jews.  Ganef -->
thief is obvious.  Fonye is not.  A polyglot friend of mine, a Jewish
psychiatrist who was born and trained in Hungary, survived service in a
Rumanian labor battalion in World War II by the skin of his teeth (with
the indirect help of Raoul Wallenberg and a rare, compassionate German
soldier) was quick to suggest the origin of fonye.  I pass on this purely
anecdotal offering.  Ivan is a typical Russian name.  From that is
derived the nickname Vanya.  Vanya in Yiddish became Fonye, a general
term for a Russian.  To that was often added ganef to indicate contempt.
Any other suggestions?

Louis Fridhandler.

Subject: fonye

My teacher Moyshe Altbauer, who's turning ninety (90!) this year and is
still going strong suggested once that fonye derives from the Russian
theme afon- 'Athenian' i.e. 'Greek'., i.e. 'Russian' (cf. Yovn, literally
'Greek' for 'Russian').

Subject: Fonye (ganev)

Fonye is/was the general word used by Yiddish-speaking Jews to refer to
Russians (non-Jews). The origin of the reference to the Tsar as "Fonye
Ganef" is very upsetting. It wasn't that long ago that the tsar had boys
of eight years stolen and forced to serve in the Russian armed forces 25
years.  This was, among other things, an attempt at Russification.
Families throughout the Pale of Settlement lived in perpetual insecurity.
On a lighter note, Ize Kremer, the great Yiddish singer from Bessarabia,
has a song where she throws every epithet she can at some miserable jerk,
"Your yikhes is that they took you in priut" That last word is the word,
if I'm right, for the custom of taking the children from their families.
Anyway, hence Fonye Ganef, I think.

Khaim Vaytsman's associates were all excited because Lenin wanted the two
of them to "talk",since there was common ground doing *something* about
the state of affairs of tsarist Russia. After the meeting, they asked
Vaytsman how it went. He answered, "Fe! Fe! Fonyak!" (I don't know where
I read that).

Subject: Raysn

In re: etymology of "Raysn."

Aren Portnoy's question about the origin of "Fonye" = Russian reminded me
of a question that has long intrigued me: the origin of the term "Raysn"
for Belorussia. The word looks to me suspiciously non-Slavic and appears
to have (?) some connection with the same root as in "Russia, Ruthenia,
Rus." Do any Mendelniks have insight into the origin of this term? Thanks

Subject: preglen

Mikhl Herzog. Of course a "mitteldeutch" bregeln doesn't rule out a
Slavic source. I remember asking Uriel Weinreich about gepregelt many
years ago, I think it was before his dictionary appeared. He said he had
no idea of its origin, and I'm sure he knew a good deal about Slavic. On
braten etc and self-inflicted hair loss: my wife has long been convinced
that dictionaries are produced by males with no knowledge of cookery and
the arts there practiced, and thus produce sloppy glosses in that
semantic area.

Subject: Origin of Zishe

I am posting this for someone else on the Internet.  Does anyone know the
etymology of the Yiddish name, "Zishe"?  Is it related to "Zisl"?

Subject: subject pro-drop in yiddish

does anyone know of any mention by the yiddishists of missing subjects in
yiddish sentences, e.g. bist gerekht, herst a mayse? a dank.
