Subject: Translation help

Dear Mendelniks,

I'm trying to translate a short piece published in _ZUKUNFT_ written by
my father (who died only five weeks ago). He was a native of Vilne (as am
I) and his Yiddish is idiomatic. Occasionally I need help with fine
points of meaning. I'd like to get it just right. It's my father's memory
of his last breakfast with his father, before leaving to join the
guerrilas the day before the Vilne Ghetto was liquidated.

If there's anyone out there who could stand an occasional query please
let me know

Sam Kowarski

Subject: Translation meditations

If a rank amateur may contribute to the discussion on translation:

In addition to Messrs Poe and Friedhandler's thoughtful insights on the
problems they raise, I wonder if there's any consensus on how to handle
multi-lingual passages in Yiddish texts. I'm currently working on my
grandfather's memoir of the Shmini Atseres holiday in Keidan, and besides
the numerous Hebrew liturgical phrases, there are a number of places
where Russian and even French show up, typically in the context of the
traditional holiday banquets, where members of the Khevre Kedisha and
other honored societis drank and sang themselves into holy bliss.

An example:

"...Reb Leyzer Mendels, a kleyninker, velkher vert shiker fun a halbe
glezel, iz oykh rusish geshtimt, un zingt: 'Akh ti reboyne-shel-oylem!
Zatshem ti ne smotrish, zatshem ti ne vidish, mar goleseynu!' Un der
oylem khapt unter: 'Mar goleseynu perebudem, laretzeynu fort poidiom!'

Now I've managed to figure out more or less how that could be rendered in
coherent English, but in this context, should it be? In other words, I
presume the "foreign" sounding Russian words intermixed with Hebrew and
Yiddish ones connoted something essential to the original readers, who
were almost certainly themselves fluent in all three. But how do you
convey that to a generally monolingual English audience? And beyond this
perhaps somewhat atypical passage, where is the point along the spectrum
of Hebrew-derived words, from those that seem thoroughly ingrained in
Yiddish vernacular to those clearly conoting religiosity or formality,
where one should do something other than simply translate into English --
perhaps stick with the original Hebrew, perhaps in quotes, perhaps with
footnotes? I hear the answer as I ask the question -- this is why
translation is an art. But I'd appreciate some additional discussion and
perhaps some tips for a real novice at the game ...

(By the way, I think a straight translation of the above would read:

"... Leyzer Mendels, such a little guy that a half a shot makes him
drunk, also falls into Russian, and sings: Oh, Lord of the Universe! Why
don't you look at, why don't you see, our bitter exile! And the crowd
sings along: Our bitter exile let us throw off, to our own land let us go
off!")

But I'm open to correction and/or criticism. I'll take all the help I can
get with this....

Subject: Found: An Irishman in Yiddishland

I did not exactly look for him, but when I found him It made me feel very
good.  It is not unlike when one is in a foreign country and accidentally
stumbles upon one who speaks your native tongue.

The book _A Century of Yiddish in America: Yiddish and English_by Sol
Steimetz is out of print, and I called the Workman's Circle (the arbeter
ring) Book Center in New York to inquire if it carried the book.  A
gentleman answered.  No, they do not have it, and he gave me the name and
telephone No. of another bookstore that may have it.  I called, same
results.

Whenever I telephone a Jewish organization, I am in the habit of asking
the party that answers in English, if he or she speaks Yiddish.

So I asked the man of the Book Center if he spoke Yiddish.  His reply:
"Avade, farvos nit?"  (I made a mental note that he answered my question
with a question.)  His name is Stephen Dowling.  "Dowling?" I repeated
his last name with a question mark, "this is not a Jewish last name, is
it?"  No, he said, I am not Jewish,  I am an Irishman.

My curiosity piqued, and I proceeded to inquire some more.  Mr. Dowling,
who is 30 years old, speaks, writes, and reads Yiddish.  He took some
Yiddish courses at the Workman's Circle.  His teacher was the well-known
Yiddish pedagogue Peysakh Fishman.

Several years ago Mr. Dowling was stage manager of the Workman's Circle
theater group _di folksbine_.  Currently he is the manager of the Book
Center.  He is also secretary of the _hemshekh_Arbeter Ring Branch No.
105 in New York's Manhattan.  This is a youth group of Yiddish-speaking
members

I then asked him if he knew some other non-Jews who speak Yiddish. He
rattled off several names:  Michael Spudic  (he believes is Polish); Nina
Warnke who speaks, writes, and reads Yiddish (some time ago she was a
sound technician on a number of Folksbine performances);  and Katsue
Kishimoto, a former member of the above-mentioned hemshekh group (now in
Japan).  She, too, writes and reads Yiddish, but lacks fluency in
speaking because she has no opportunity to practice it.

Mr. Dowling then mentioned, with some glee in his voice, that the famous
movie actor James Cagney, in a 1932 movie called _Taxi_ in which he
played a a cab driver, gave at one point a 5-minute rapid-fire monologue
in Yiddish.  (This fact is mentioned in J. Hoberman's book on Jewish
movies called _Bridge of Light_, published by Shocken Books.)

This instance by itself is not necessarily evidence that Cagney knew a
fluent Yiddish.  As an actor he may have learned and well rehearsed this
part in the movie, although having grown up on Manhattan's Lower East
Side he may have picked-up some Yiddish.

Dowling then mentioned another non-Jewish person well versed in
Yiddish-Prof. Thomas E. Bird from Queens College (where he teaches
Russian literature).  Him I happen to know.  We both serve on the
Executive Board of the League for Yiddish in New York, with the only
difference that he never misses a Board meeting, while I, for reasons of
distance and health, am more often than not absent.  Prof. Bird is an
emeser yidishist.  He subscribes to Yiddish journals, and goes to general
cultural gatherings where Yiddish is spoken on and off the stage.  In our
khavruse we often call him Tevye.

Jocularly I asked Mr. Dowling if he happens to have (or has selected) a
Jewish first name.  He laughed and said that some of his friends call him
occasionally and good-naturedly "Shloyme."  This started when he went
several years ago to a Klezmer kamp organized by Yivo.  Every guest
received a lapel identification card with his or her name.  His card read
"Stephen," and everybody asked him what was his Jewish name. When he said
that he had none, they called him for some reason Shloyme.

P.S.:  Miss Kishimoto would like to develop a pen-palship in Yiddish.  In
case some Mendele member is interested, here is her address:

                    Daii 475
                   Seto-Cho Okaiwa
                    Okayama 709-08
                    Japan

Abe Igelfeld wrote (4.093,8):

It is a matter of degree.

A chronic and habitual kibetzer is often considered a pest.

When one kibitzes oneself incessantly, it may suggest a not-so-hidden
sign of extreme low self-esteem.

And it may even occasionally border on a deep-seated sense of
inferiority.

When you call your group _shnorers_ and your newsletter _shmate_, you
open the door to constant abuse and invite a stream of ridicule plain and
simple.

Subject: ``Jewish self-hatred''

I don't want to start a polemic war, but I'd like to protest Jay Lee's
use of the term "Jewish self-hatred" without quotes; rather than a
value-neutral or scholarly term, it is an artifact of the polemic lexicon
of a world-view which characterizes the radical departure of certain
third parties from the beliefs and values the holder expects them to hold
as maladjustment, i.e., mental illness, an old Stalinist technique.  The
unqualified use of this term renders a disservice to Asch and the other
quite worldly writers whose work is being discussed.

Subject: Re: Mystery:lamed-sof=tzadik

I  had planned  to write  shortly  on the  topic brought  up by  Leybl
Botwinik in 4.072 (and once before) on the "Mystery:lamed-sof=tzadik", as
the way  a certain  write  signed some  of his  works.  Leybl  had
checked  in "Otzar  Rashey Teyvot",  for another  reason when  he came
across that  unusual lamed-sof=tzadiq combinations.  If  one wishes to be
pedantic about  it, it  should not  have been  there as  after all
"*Rashey*  Teyvot" means  the *beginnings*  of words  (like in  *Rosh*
HaShana, the beginning of the year).   As said that would be pedantic.

Leyble rightly rejected  some examples like u:m and  Tanakh which have
end letters (mem  and khaf respectively) but these are  *not* the last
letters of the last word as in his example.

I was reminded  of the matter when in 4.093  Reuven Frankenstein gives
the example Dalet Resh for Doctor like in European languages.  Here at
least  he has  the final  resh of  the word.   I had  planned to  give
another example namely yod final  mem used frequently for YerushalayiM
(with a hyphen  between the two letters).  In my  example one also has
only one word (as in doctor).

There may be another related issue and that was the custom of having a
verse of the  Tanakh for one's name.  The verse  was usually chosen so
that it  starts with the  first letter of the  name and ends  with the
last letter of  the name.  I still remember Michael's  verse being Mah
tovu ohaleikha  ya'aqov, mishkanoteikha yisraeL.  In  many siddurim of my
youth, the  list was usually after the shmone  esre of shaharit.  I have
not seen it recently in siddurim.

May I  wish at that  occasion all Mendeleniks  Shana Tova, a  guten un
zisen yohr (sp?),
