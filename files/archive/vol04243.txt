Subject: Yiddish on Short Wave

In response to Allan Astro's Dec. 5 query about shortwave broadcasts from
Israel in Yiddish (Mendele 4.217), Kol Israel--Israel Radio--transmits
one 25-minute program and one 30-minute program in Yiddish daily.  I
tuned in last Saturday and it was barely audible on 11603 kHz. at 1 p.m.
EST.  The schedule is: 1700-1725 GMT/UTC (12 noon Eastern Standard Time,
11 a.m. Central Time) and 1800-1830 GMT (1 p.m. EST, 12 noon CT) on the
frequencies 11603 kHz, 9435 kHz, and 7465 kHz (I've listed the
frequencies I've had the best luck with).

To tune them in, you need a shortwave radio (preferably one with a
digital frequency display, which can run $100-$300) and it helps to live
on the East coast so the Yiddish signals don't have to _matern zikh_
through too many cities and mountains (though Texas sounds like a good
chance--a mostly water path from Israel).  Reception is irregular,
depending on atmospheric conditions. Programming is not bad:
well-produced newscasts, mainly dealing with Israeli news, commentary
from a predictable ideological viewpoint (how modern Israeli _bitakho'n_
beats out old-fashioned, _goles_-style [pardon me, _galu't_] _bito'khn_),
music (one transmission a day is almost all songs), and coverage of
Yiddish cultural events in Israel.  Some highlights of my occasional
monitoring over the last two years: a long interview in Yiddish with
former Prime Minister Itzhak Shamir and a reading of a story by Avrom
Sutzkever.

It would be nice if the programs could be re-transmitted on local AM or
FM stations or on cable TV (as Kol Israel's broadcasts in English are on
WUST AM 1120 on radio or on SCOLA on cable TV in the Washington, D.C.
area), however this would only be practical if the Yiddish programs were
transmitted over satellite like the others.  That, in turn, would require
money and political will.

Program schedules (in English) are available from: Israel Broadcast
Authority--Kol Israel, External Service, P.O. Box 1082, Jerusalem 91010,
Israel.

Subject: Vilna Tribute on Yiddish Voice Radio

			Yiddish Voice Presents
		     Vilna - Yerushalayim D'Lite
	    A Tribute, on Weds., Dec. 28, 1994, 7:30 p.m.

(Brookline, MA) The Yiddish Voice, a brand new Yiddish-language weekly
radio show in Boston, will present a tribute to "Vilna - Yerushalayim
D'Lite", on Wednesday, Dec. 28, 1994, 7:30 p.m. on WUNR 1600 AM.  The
narrators are Dovid Braun and Hasia Segal.

The text of the program was written exclusively for the Yiddish Voice by
renowned Israeli journalist Chaya Lazar to memorialize her native city
Vilna (Vilnius, Lithuania), which became known among many Jews as
Yerushalayim D'Lite (The Jerusalem of Lithuania) due to the vibrant
Jewish life that flourished there until its destruction by the Nazis 50
years ago.

Chaya Lazar is a well-known Hebrew-language journalist, who writes
frequently for Israeli newspapers. She survived the Vilna Ghetto, and
fought as a partisan against the Nazis. She gave an account of this
period on film for the documentary "Partisans of Vilna".  She is
translator for the Israeli periodical Ghetto Fighters and Partisans, and
she has translated several books from Yiddish and English into Hebrew.

Hasia Segal is both the producer of this program and co-narrator. A
native of Lithuania, and a retired Hebrew and Yiddish language educator
in Boston, she has written, produced, and hosted numerous programs for
the Yiddish Voice as well as other Yiddish radio shows.

This program marks the debut appearance of Dovid Braun on the Yiddish
Voice. Braun is a PhD candidate in Linguistics at MIT.  He is the former
editor of the international Yiddish-language journal Yugntruf. He has
lectured in and taught Yiddish at such institutions as Gratz College,
University of Pennsylvania, and Columbia University.

Special musical accompaniment for the program includes the voice of
Cantor Simon Kandler of Temple Emeth in Chestnut Hill. Kandler, a native
of Latvia, has served the Boston Jewish community for over 60 years.

The Yiddish Voice, which began broadcasting here last July, features
music, poetry, comedy, interviews, news, commentary, and announcements of
current events, all of it in the Yiddish language. For further
information, call (617) 738-1870, send email to yv@world.std.com, or

Washington St., Boston, MA 02113.

Subject: zhe

Anno Siegel:

Zhe, of Slavic derivation, is equivalent to denn and mal in German:

Vuzhe gezugt?: Vos-zhe hostu gezogt?: Was hastu du denn gesagt?

"...koyft zhe, koyft zhe papirosn,
    trukene fun regn nit fargosn
    koyft zhe bilik benemones
    koyft un hot af mir rakhmones
    ratevet fun hunger mikh atsind!"

"Kauft mal, kauft mal Zigaretten!"

Note that vos/vus and zhe elide: vozhe/vuzhe. also /koyftshe/ from koyft-zhe

Subject: nu zhe?

Zhe is a russian article which denotes emphasis. But in the process it
gives a sense of coloquiality which tends to soften the phrase. E.g.:

Nu? = well?     Nu zhe? = Well, then?

Wer kumt? =Who is coming?  Wer zhe kumt? = So who is coming?

Arre Komar
