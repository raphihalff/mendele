Subject: Bokser

My apologies to everyone, who like Hugh Denman, did not recognize the nowadays
little-used word 'hartshorn'. It is one of the salts in smelling salts (which
are also little-used nowadays).

Subject: Talmudic bokser

In Mendele  Vol. 5.254,  Hugh Denman  states while  discussing boksers
(carobs)  that: "the  topos of  the carob  as suitable  comestible for hermits
residing in  deserts is not confined  to Christian literature. I  believe
there  are midrashic  counterparts".   I know  of one  such reference in the
Talmud, Brakhot 17b,  where it says that although the whole world  is
nourished  because of  Hanina ben Dosa, he  himself is satisfied by a "qav"
(about two quarts) of carobs for a whole week.

Subject: Bokser

Many thanks to Meyer-Leyb Wolf for his explanation of the derivation of
bokser.

My question about the reason for the adoption of (now I know) a New High
German term was not stated clearly enough. Let me try again:

Bokser was eaten in Eastern Europe in a semi-ritual manner; i.e., specifically
in observance of khamishe oser b'shvat (Shevat 15, "New Year for Trees")
specifically because it grew in erets yisroyl, the Land of Israel. Given such
connections, it is curious at least to me that its name in (I assume) biblical
Hebrew would have been abandoned.

Subject: The Yiddish canon

My apologies to those who took offense the absence of works by women in the
working list for the Yiddish canon. I would be very surprised indeed if a real
draft of the canon did have works by Kadie Molodowsky and Rokhl Korn (about
Yente Serdatski I'm not so sure). In any case, the idea is to canonize works
of literature, not writers.

Additional apologies are also in order. Yankev Lewis' mention [5.255] of Glikl
sent me to check the list -- I know that Glikl made it into the computer. I
then realized that I have a copy of the Old List, rather than the New List
which included Glikl and others. I will try to prepare a more useful version
in the near future.

Finally, the opening verses of 'Dos yikhes-brivl' by miryem ulinover perhaps
hint at what the point of putting togther a Yiddish canon is.

        ven kh'hob fun libn shtetele
        fartroyert zikh gesheydt,
        hot mir der zeyde biz tsum taykh
        gegebn dos bagleyt;

        di frilingzun hot ufgeshaynt,
        der himl - zikh tsebloyt,
        der zeyde hot baym sheydveg mir
        a brivl ongetroyt.

        farloyrn hob ikh im, dem briv,
        un gey arum farklemt:
        a shpas - on yikhes-brivele
        tsu blaybn in der fremd!

Subject: Composite tenses/moods

Thank you Khayem Bochner for the "zol geven" examples. Sholem Aleichem is
indeed a frequent user, as was our totemic ancestor Mendele; I have these
examples from 'Di Klyatshe':

        a shteyger, er zol geven araynkumen tsu mir un gebetn epes a zakh...

        es zol geven meglekh zayn, volt ikh ale gehaldzt, gekusht un veynendik
        zey mekhile gebetn!

        itst farshteystu, far vos iz bay mir aza besure; kholile-vekhas, di
        takse zol geven botl vern, vi etlekhe hobn es farlangt, volt ir -
        nisht derlebn zolt ir dos! - mit a mol poter gevorn fun a sakh tsores.

It seems to me that this use of 'zol geven' was not as common in the
literature of the twentieth century as it was in the nineteenth.

By the way, what struck me as unusual was "ven ikh zol geven gevust" with the
participle gevust rather than the infinitive geven.
