Subject: Moyd un meydl

     I have e-mail from Dovid-Noyekh Miller about the
Ludmirer Moyd, the  Maid of Ludomir, regarding a query
on another list. I remember fondly a song  from an
album called _Love Songs of Many Lands_, by Theo Bikel.
The song is " Ikh bin a meydl in di yoren." Granted
that --l is diminutive, and that Hebrew,  for example,
has known several words for unmarried woman, is there a
true  difference between "moyd" and "meydl," or is it a
phonetic shift to accomodate  attaching the diminutive?
Or perhaps differences in dialect?

~~~~~~~~~~
     Noyekh shames,
     Some of my interest in Yiddish is related to the
sense that knowing the  language will provide me with
access to women's religious experiences recorded  in
Yiddish. I am a psychologist, and psychologists made
the difficult  transition to gender-neutral language
about fifteen years ago. And, above, I am  asking about
the word "moyd." It's no wonder that you place me in
the feminist  camp from those clues. It is not, howev-
er, a label I wear comfortably,  especially when my
daughter is fighting for English courses that will
teach her  T. S. Eliot and Wallace Stevens, and the
Department is only offering Gender and  Representation
in Twentieth Century American Fiction. As a label, it
also  represents knowledge I do not have. However, I
suppose it isn't bad as a way of  indicating my gender,
which is not always apparent, except to Eva-Maria 
Jansson.
     Thank you for the work you are doing in putting
out MENDELE. It has  leaped from a standing start right
up to the caliber of IOUDAIOS, which is no  small feat.

a sheynem dank,
Sigrid Peterson

Subject: RE: Z. Segalovitch

Regarding Harry Katz's interest in the writer,
Segalovitch, I am not certain that this is the same
person, but I know a folk ballad, "Sheyn iz Reyzele dem
sheykhets (the pronunciation bias being Byelorussian,
the way my grandmother sang it) by a Z. Segalovitch
born Feb 26, 1884 in Bialystok,  Poland--died Feb 19,
1949 in New York.  There is a chapter on him with this
and several other song texts by him in Perl fun der
Yiddisher Poeziya by Yosef and Chana Mlotek,  YIVO
1974.  I refer to the song as a "folk ballad" because
it had become popular enough in my grandmother's neck
of the woods in the early part of the century for it to
have been committed to memory and even resung with
variants.
