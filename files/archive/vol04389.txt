Subject: Hotzmekh?

Has anyone familiarity with, or a clear definition or etymology for this
term? My mother (b. 1921) uses it, "You look like a _hotzmekh_!",
(qometz-aleph in the first syllable) implying unkempt, ragged looking, or
the like, but neither she, Weinreich, Harkavy, or several people she
considers expert were able to define it adequately. Perhaps it denotes a
dealer in rags, a beggar, or something on that order?  Anyone?

Subject: Tundele

[Regarding Vulvush Lazer Gershgorn's question (Vol.4.385):]

My great aunt (on my mother's side) and my grandmother (on my father's
side) used to do something similar. First she'd pretend-spit (tuh, tuh,
tuh) on the palm, then, gently poking/stroking the palm with her
forefinger she would sing something like this (as near as I can
remember):

	Sorinke, borinke
	Tema katchke, nevarile

	(then, wiggling each finger):

	Temeh daleh, temeh daleh, temeh daleh, temeh daleh

	(then going from the thumb up and wiggling fingers up the arm):

	Ooootch ootch ootch ootch ootch ootch

The "temeh daleh" part sounds like it could be a little like your
"tundele."

I also vaguely remember seeing something that was surprising like this
fingerplay in a book (maybe a book of fingerplays) in the children's
section of the library where I used to work, but I believe the book
indicated it was from some slavic country. It didn't say anything about
it being in Yiddish. I'll see if I can dig it up somewhere.

Subject: A string game, "ettel-bettel"

The game of "cat's cradle" played for hours with a piece of string,
looped and tied, is as I remember called "ettel bettel" in Yiddish.  Does
anyone know the origin of this name for the game in question?  It sounds
almost as if it is made up of nonsense syllables but I say that out of
ignorance more than anything.

Subject: Sanctification of Yiddish

I have been following the ongoing discussion on the subject of "the
Sanctification of Yiddish"  and have seen several good suggestions, but
no one has mentioned tkhines.  Tkhines are Yiddish prayers composed by
men and women mainly for the use of women.  These prayers cover all
aspects of life, and are pure spiritual gold.  A recent work, "Bizkes
Emoes, The Merit of Our Mothers", by Tracy Guren Klirs, Hebrew Union
College Press, Cincinnati, 1992; is a bilingual anthology of Jewish
women's prayers, in Yiddish and in English. Anyone interested in the
sanctification of Yiddish should find this book.  It would be an
important addition to any Shul, or to anyone's personal devotions. If
anyone is interested in more information on tkhines they can contact me
personally.

Subject: Yiddish in Word 6

I am trying to use Word to type Yiddish. I am trying out WGreek version
1.9, that contains some macros for reverse typing and overstrike of
characters. However in Word 6 for Windows, I have always a space at the
right of the overstroke character and part of that field, and I can't
get rid of it unless editing the field. I have built some macros (had
to learn some of it now) to clean this space, and at the same time made
special Yiddish macros in Word, but it is not very elegant (One sees
the equation used to build it and written in hebrew...).

I tested the same macros in word 2., and surprise, surprise, I had no
problem there of additional space.

Did someone else encounter the same problem and found a solution to get
rid of that anoying space character in Word 6? I am willing to share
what I did to solve it in my case, as well as all the special yiddish
macros.

Is there another system than Wgreek, that allows to type in Yiddish in
word 6 ( and also constructing correctly the Fey and Peyz
characters!!!)?

Does someone know how to address the end-of-line and next-line problem
in right to left typing? I think that it is possible to solve with
another macro, but none of the programs I have seen (R2L or Wgreek 1.9)
solve it correctly (the begin of the yiddish line already typed in,
goes to the next line, what is wrong and needs manual correction and
attention at each line).
