Reyz; K-W mentions a "Slobodjanskyj scandal" apparently in
connection with Paul Wexler's argument abaout the history of Yiddish
and the Jews of Eastern Europe. Am I the only one who doesn't know
what this is? Could Reyzl, my respected teacher, explain this
without being guilty--perish the thought--of scandal?

as i read the recent notes on mendele, a question keeps popping into
my mind. why does the language columnist of the forward hide behind
a pseudonym, a custom usually reserved for advice-to-the-lovelorn
columnists? perhaps, since he seems to be a reader of mendele, he
can share his reasons with us. inquiring minds want to know, vi men
zogt.

re: wexler's theory

I am perplexed at the attacks on wexler's theory of a slavic origin
for yiddish.  Not that I support this theory.  What perpelexes me is
the postings that we have seen from reyzl, ellen and khaim bochner
that 1) acknowledge not having read wexler's article and 2) reject
his theory.  Now if this theory were some kind of private meshugas
that wexler mutters to himself and to everyone in his presence, that
may be one thing.  But this article was published in the
International Journal of the Sociology of Language.  Is this not a
respected journal?  Does this not make it a subject of discussion in
the public domain?  Must one not,. then, acquaint oneself with the
theory first-hand, and then, only then refute it?

I have myself made several attempts to read Wexler's piece, and the
comments on it.  Wexler has presented a lot of evidence, and has
attempted to build what seems to be an internally consistent theory,
taking into account and responding to expected criticisms.  A lot of
the attack on him is either on methodological grounds (i.e. what
constitutes a theory), which seems wrong to me in that they
essentially refute Wexler's theory as being inconsistent with
currently accepted theory, or they produce evidence that is
inconsistent with Wexler's theory.  The latter kind of refutation is
what is necessary in order to reject Wexler's theory; the more the
better, not the first kind.  And even then, there is still the
question as to whether the kind of renewed investigation into the
Slavic origins of Yiddish will lead to an ultimately better theory
than is currently available today, (even if that is not going to be
Wexler's theory).

This is the sort of response to Wexler that I would like to see in
Mendele, something that will enlighten non-linguists, rather than
proclamations ex-cathedra.

Meylekh.  (I hope there will be at least as many informed responses
to Wexler as attacks on my post, as a result of my request here.)

Subject: Korten

I remember my grandparents, a"h, playing a lot of cards with their
lantslayt while I was growing up.  The term they used for "queen"
was "meydl." I have no idea if it was a form of euphemism, or if
that was the proper term in their part of Poland (Bendin/Bedzin). I
recall their Yiddish as containing a fair number of English
borrowings (they were in the US over 40 years by the time I was
growing up), but I don't remember ever hearing anything like "kvin."

Dear friends:

Mendele is about to make a change which will be entirely invisible
to you, which is why it's unimportant: on or about July 4 Mendele
will be edited from Brookline, MA instead of West Hartford, CT.  At
the present time, copy is sent from one of the Trinity Suns to Yale
and from Yale to you.  After the move copy will proceed from
Brandeis to Trinity etc.

This move will affect you in no way whatever.  Please continue to
address your posts as you have in the past.  And archives will
still be stored at Trinity.

But the shames does have a problem.  The Brandeis machine is very
busy, which means that editing--even when it's done via Telnet at
Trinity--gets to be a bit sluggish.  So, would you please help to
reduce editorial time by remembering these two basic requests:
1) provide a usable subject line, and 2) edit your copy to
eliminate all the stuff that Mendele doesn't print anyway--such as
multi-line signatures, extensive quotes from previous posts, etc.

A hartsikn dank aykh.

Noyekh
