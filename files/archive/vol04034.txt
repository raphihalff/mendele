Subject: Introduction

Sholem Aleykhem, Ikh bin Leybl Botvinik ...

Born in 1959, Montreal Canada. My father, David born and brought up in
Polish pre-war Vilno was (and still is) my major influence in my love for
Yiddish.  He is a musician, and Yiddish and Hebrew music were my first
introduction to my Jewishness; Classical music, to my secularity. I might
say, Music is my first language. Italian is my second language (my mother
is from ROME) and Yiddish my third language (the food is great ...).

I graduated the Jewish day school system in Montreal, learning English
and French, Yiddish and Hebrew daily, from Kindergarden through grade 11.
My father had always taught us kids (My older sister Rivl, and my two
younger brothers Sender and Yankl) that it is not enough to speak Yiddish
with/to the older generation, but more importantly amongst ourselves.
This is an important lesson. Now we speak Yiddish freely with anyone
younger or older, naturally, without being embarassed ... Thus, I
naturally speak Yiddish to my three little Sabra-kids.

I learned Yiddish at home, and in the "YIDDISHE PERETZ SHUL" which joined
with the "YIDDISHE FOLKS SHUL" to form the "BIALIK MITL SHUL" (all
day-schools). I started writing in Yiddish in my elementary school days,
and continue to this day.

I write primarily Science fiction, but also poetry and satire and about
the Holocaust (my parents are survivors, making me and my children
survivors too).

I have published a Yiddish magazine for young and old: "DER NAYER DOR"
(issue#1 1978, #2 1979, #3 1980, #4 1982); a science-fiction/mystery
novel "DI GEHEIME SHLIHES" (1980) and various short stories and poems
articles, essays etc. in many newspapers and journals around the world. I
have produced a short 1.5 min. animated Yiddish film based on Leib
Naidus's "A ZUN MIT A REGN".  I produced and hosted several 15 min. TV
programs on Cable TV in Montreal. I have acted with Dora Wasserman's
Yiddish Theatre.

After my elementary and high school education I went on to graduate
Vanier College (Sciences) and Concordia University (Bach. Computer Sci)
in Montreal.  I am a computer software engineer specializing in CASE,
Graphics, Knowledge Engineering, and dabble somewhat in Multimedia and
Edu-tainment.

I am presently living and married (plus three) and working in Israel
since 1989.  I am active in the DOR HAHEMSHEKH OHAVEI YIDDISH, and
organize many activities in Netanya where I reside.  The next program
coming up is the annual Open-air Summer Festival of Yiddish songs on the
31st of July, 1994, in Netanya.

I'm also trying to find financial sponsors and business investors for a
Yiddish Pedagogical & Resource Centre.  The main idea, is to gather and
concentrate existing material, as well as to create new material for
education  & for cultural entertainment (music cassettes, videos,
computer edu-tainment software, etc...) --- More in a seperate letter.

I will be the Hemshekh Dor's Internet correspondent.  Anyone with
questions to the Hemshekh Dor Ohavei Yiddish can contact me.  I will also
be updating mendele subscribers about our activities.

Zayt Gezunt un shtark.  (--- We've got to do something about getting
a Hebrew alphabet on Mendele ... does anyone know anything ?)

Subject: Introduction; shlimazl

Introduction first. I've been lurking for about a month, too shamed by
the level of erudition here to reveal myself. But I finally have
something to contribute, so here goes. I joined the list hoping to
reestablish a dim connection to the language, and start learning more. I
have, thank you all very much, and hope to continue doing so.

My mother's first language was Yiddish, and I had the additional
advantage of growing up, Yiddishly speaking, in South Africa, long ago
enough that many of the "alters" were still around. The South African
language, Afrikaans, is quite similar to Litvish Yiddish, grammatically,
in vocabulary, and in pronunciation, and as I grew up speaking Afrikaans,
this worked out well for me.

On the Schlimazl discussion:

My Hebrew's a lot better than my Yiddish, but surely this is purely
Hebrew -> Yiddish, with no German at all. "Sh' lo mazel" means,
Hebrew->English grammatical convolutions aside, "that one has no luck".

Meyshe-Yankl Sweet talks about Yiddish in Dutch. I've heard, in Amsterdam
street slang "Ek geeft jou een *klep in ponim*", and other more
scatological expressions. I found this one especially interesting because
it keeps the Yiddish grammar intact.

Subject: Schlemiel, Schlamassel

Well, here I am on vacation, having left my _Joy of Yiddish_ on the shelf
at home under the mistaken impression I wouldn't need it....  And now
Yitzhak asks me to show that G got the two words in question from Y and
not vice-versa. I must admit, Yitzhak, you've stumped me.  I haven't got
any suitable reference materials with me.  I seem to remember, however,
reading in a German book, published by dtv and called something like "dtv
Atlas der deutschen Sprache" (a historical and geographic survey of
German and other western germanic languages), both "Schlemiel" and
"Schlamassel" cited as examples of Y>G.  That's not to say, of course,
that both words aren't of germanic (as opposed to semitic, slavic,
romance etc) origin; merely that, according to the dtv Sprachatlas,
modern German borrowed them from Yiddish. --

Subject: Shlimazl

I'm not a linguist, but my limited knowledge of German (High School and
College) leads me to wonder if "Shlimazl" (or "Schlemazel") might be a
contraction. "Schlecht" is a common enough German word, while it's been
pointed out often in this thread that "mazel" is definitely of Hebrew
origin. So, "schlemazel" would literally be "Bad luck."

Does German have contractions? I've forgotten.

Also, is the word order (adjective-noun) correct for either Hebrew or
German?

If this theory has any validity, can "schlemiel" be parsed in a similar
way?

Subject: Family name ARLOOK

I don't recall who asked about the family name Arlook, suggesting a
rather crude Germanic source etymology.  FYI, Alexander Beider's
Dictionary of Jewish Surnames From the Russian Empire (pp. 108-109)
suggests that the name is a derivative of Aaron:  Aron>Arele>Arlyuk with
a Slavic diminutive suffix like that in, le-havdil, Demjanjuk. He notes
that it was particularly common in the gubernias of Vilna, Slonim,
Grodno, and Oshmyany.  Thus, if your Arlooks are of Slavic territorial
origins, you needn't live with the unpleasant German etymological
possibilities....

Subject: Harshav on Chagall and Yiddish

Mendelniks may be interested in Benjamin Harshav's "The Role of Language
in Modern Art:  On Texts and Subtexts in Chagall's Paintings," in the new
journal MODERNISM/modernity, v.1, no.2 (1994), pp.51-87.  With 19
illustrations, Harshav discusses the origin of many of Chagall's most
distinctive images in Yiddish idioms (e.g., er geyt iber di hayzer, a ku
is gefloygn ibern dakh) as well as his use of Yiddish, Hebrew and Russian
texts and letters in Hebrew and Cyrillic in his paintings.
