Please excuse my sloppy typing in my note on nasality. To
Mikhl Herzog: I recall now that Uriel Weinreich assigned us
an article by someone else on this nasal feature in Yiddish
in association with, I think, Polish.

As for Mikhl's question to me about "gutturals," I must say
that this is a term we phoneticians don't use nowadays.
Semitic philologists and the like have used it
traditionally to mean certain (consonant) sounds made "deep
in the throat." In some scholars' reconstruction of
biblical Hebrew, just as Mikhl suggests, 'ayin is said to
represent a voiced pharyngeal fricative and Het, its
counterpart, a voiceless pharyngeal fricative, as found to
this day in some varieties of modern Arabic and in Hebrew
spoken by Oriental Jews who have long lived in Arab
societies. Thus, they are described as pharyngeal
fricatives or, if you will, gutturals. There has been a
fair amount of instrumental phonetic investigation of them.
See, e.g., Laufer & Condax, or El Halees.

Could thistle be the flax seed, which in India is used to
ease bowel movements for those with hemorrhoids. I know
about it because my brother used to get pack ages from his
Indian buddy in Delhi. Thistle seeds would have to have the
filam ents removed, wouldnt they? The silk parachutes.

In Hungaria, East, it is kolatch, not spelled that way.
Rather more like a roun d coffeecake, withor without
raisins. Tea/sh kolatch, or kalacs(?) is the coffe ecake my
motherinlaw used to make, and I asked for the raisins when
I became he r soninlaw, because otherwise it was too dry,
needing butter and/or jam to make it palatable, though it
was always better than what passes for "Danish" in the USA,
which one doesnt eat after 40, I would say, anyway. Just
back from Vienna and Budapest: Strudl or strudel still
reigns delightfully there. Sour cherry i n Hungary,
meggyes, or morellos, that is strudl! But it has to be 0 C
to use up the calories.
