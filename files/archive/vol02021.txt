Subject: piece in June 26 NY Times with 26 (count them) Yiddish words

The piece is about the tzimis started by a lawyer's brief
using the word "dreck". A counter-brief used a number of
Yiddish words, and the article used a few more; all were
given in correct YIVO transliteration and provided with
footnotes giving the English translation.

The judge was not amused.

To Bob Hoberman: re meshine rather than the expected
meshune in the West: It MAY be eastern influence, as you
suggest, but it may also be an "indigenous" feature which
we encounter in several words of Hebrew and Aramaic origin.
WY "sigge" (suke) is one;  etc;

I'm sure you're waiting for this question; so let me ask
it. Why does suke become 'sigge', with the k->g alteration?

Meylekh.

Subject: enquiry

Can anyone suggest some useful (and, hopefully, readily
accessible) titles on Western Yiddish grammar? Suggested
titles can be in English, French, German and, of course,
Yiddish.

Thanks,
Hinda

Subject: mise meshine & farbissin  (e or er)

In my imperfect memory, "mise meshine" was used by
relatives and their friends to refer to a dangerous woman.
Although I didn't know what the word literally meant, the
person so referred to was somebody to avoid.  Why it was
always a woman, I don't know.  A distant second in order of
nastiness was the epithet "farbissen" ending with gender
ending e or er.  More frequently this term too r referred
to someone who didn't too often look bitten up, but was a
biter!

The shames suggested to me that my family used "mise
meshine" to refer to a witch -- shades of Bashevis Singer!
That's certainly possible, considering the variety of ptuis
and knocks on wood that seemed to accompany such
exclamations. Does any one else have an experience similar
to mine?  It also seems to me that among the first and
following generations of Jews in America who speak Yiddish
in some form, the farbissen epithet, or its equivalent, is
more commonly invoked than mise meshine.  We have fewer
witches among us, perhaps, and more people with
"ressentiment."
