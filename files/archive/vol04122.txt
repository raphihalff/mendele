Subject: Az der bubbe vot gehat..

For Bob Poe:

Sorry, the Pinker quote simply cannot be from the Southeast, regardless
of how we read his "baytzim", whether as [ey] or as [ay]. There are two
features that simply preclude Southeastern provenance. Their coocurrence
point unmistakably to Poland.

i) vot, vost, etc. is the result of the frequent vocalization of "l" in
Poland, NOT in the Southeast. It finds its various regional expressions:

Largely in Western Poland, it appears consonantally as "w" and
vocalically as "u": "wefu" 'lefl', "tepu", 'tepl'. The town, Polish
"Kalisz" is "Ku:wish" in local speech. In words like "volt, volst" and
"zolst" the "l" disappears altogether "vot, vost, zost".

In Northeastern Poland (and in some towns in northern Belorus, "l" is
also vocalized: the town Lomze is "Womzi" in Yiddish, Glubokoje (?) is
"Gwubok". Here, the vVocalization of "l" is more likely to yield a
diphthong in "vout"and "mou" ('mouth') but not "vot". But, the clincher
is the cooccurence of "l" vocalization and "bube" which precludes these
locations as a source for the citation. Surprisingly, perhaps, the
occurence of "bube" also precludes a Southeastern Yiddish origin.

ii) The word for 'grandmother' is one of several in which the o/u
variation is NOT realized in the expected manner--in each case for
different reasons. (A few of?) the others words are "borves", "tishebov",
"tnoyim" ('marriage vows').

ONLY Central Yiddish and a part of North-Central Yiddish have the
expected "bube". In Galicia and the Northern Ukraine, we find "babe" and,
in the rest of the Ukraine (Podolia, Bessarabia), we find the seemingly
anomalous "bobe" (sic!). Not really anomalous because it derives from a
Slavic "babe-like" form just as, say, Southeastern Yiddish "hont, vont,
voser", derive from "hant, vant, vaser". The most likely conclusion is
that the cooccurence of "bube" and "vot", designates a speaker of Central
Yiddish and that Pinker's "baytsim" is really meant to convey phonetic
[ay].

Subject: A get

For Howard Kaplan:

"What I say" is this: Mendele is the result of an earlier schism
prompted, several years ago, by precisely the concerns that seem to
trouble you now. The split then was a much friendlier one than the tone
of your message suggests the next one might be. Be that as it may, we
might all be gratified if you were now to take the initiative to effect
the divorce you suggest. I'd consider it a mitsve and would promise to
contribute some good jokes.

Subject: Rav Ktav

I spoke to the representative of MicroMacro in Tel Aviv. He led me to
believe that there is no representative of ravktav in the USA, but it
wouldn't hurt to contact DAVKA in chicago and find out anyway. Innocent
inquiries sometimes bring interesting results.

It might be interesting to also ask them if they have any 'yiddish'
software.  I sent them a letter a few months ago, asking if they have
Yiddish software, and if they would be interested in (re)developing
jointly (with my Centre for Yiddish and Techno-Newware). No answer...
Maybe, if more people started showing an interest, they might see the
light, that there is a need for yiddish games, educational materials,
etc. on computer.  They could adapt/translate existing materials.

Steve Jacobson, the MicroMacro address is: Micro-Macro, Bet Hillel 20,
Tel Aviv, 67017. Write attention to Avi Tirosh. He said that if it is
just an update, he could send you a disk by mail. Phone number is:
3-5625661. Tell him 'leybl' sent you.

Subject: Davka Corp.

Sheldon Benjamin mentioned Davka but did not have the address and telephone
number. Here they are:

          Davka Corporation
          7074 N. Western Ave.
          Chicago, IL 60645
          (312) 465-4070

I believe the company has an 800 number too, but I can't find it.
