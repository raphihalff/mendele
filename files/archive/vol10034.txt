Subject: Project Onkelos

Project Onkelos, which aims at providing readers with modern and
highly-readable Yiddish texts, announces the addition of Sholem Aleykhem's
"Hodl", one of the stories in the Howe-Greenberg _A Treasury of Yiddish
Stories_.

It can be found at http://www2.trincoll.edu/~mendele/onkelos/hodl.pdf

The next entry will be Dovid Bergelson's "Yoysef Shur".

Our work could not go on without the devoted and expert help of Mirl
Schonhaut-Hirshan and the technical wizardry of Refoyl Finkel.  Belated
thanks are also due Khayem Bochner whose bibliographic sleuthing enabled us
to lay hands on the Yiddish originals of the stories that appear in the
_Treasury_.

Finally, we wish to acknowledge a generous gift from the International
Association of Yiddish Clubs toward the purchase of high-quality OCR
software.

Report on the Samuel A. Klurman Yiddish Seminar, 
 Kiev, July 25--August 15, 2000

The summer Seminar on Yiddish and Yiddishkeit in Eastern Europe, under the
auspices of the World Council for Yiddish Culture, was held in Kiev Ukraine,
the third for the city in more than a decade of annual seminars. It was made
possible by a grant and logistic assistance from the Joint in Israel and
matching funds by the Samuel A. Klurman Foundation of Florida

Of over 86 students enrolled, 75 completed a 21 day seminar of intensive
studies and meaningful experiences in Yiddish and Yiddishkeit. They came
from 48 cities and villages, mostly from Ukraine and others from Russia,
Moldova and Belarus. The faculty was made up of eleven professors, rabbis,
lecturers, music and drama directors from Israel, U.S. and of local origin

The mandatory six and one half hour daily classroom schedule, Sunday through
Friday, consisted of courses in Yiddish language, Soviet Yiddish writers,
Holocaust literature, Jerusalem in Yiddish literature, selected texts from
the Bible, Jewish tradition, Israel, folklore, folk and art songs. During
the evenings and Sabbath afternoons, there were voluntary study groups in
Kabbalah, Life in Israel, Synagogue skills, Psychodrama, Yiddish theater,
folk dancing, methods of teaching Yiddish. In keeping with the goal of the
seminar, Yiddish was the medium of instruction and communication. We
installed a kosher kitchen (dairy), conducted Sabbath and Tisha B'av
services, Oneg Shabbat and Havdala exercises, staged two major productions
of the Yiddish theater repertoire -- "Shulamis" by Goldfaden, and Itzik
Manger's "Megilah Lieder", -- three Yiddish concerts by soloists from among
our students (all of the highest artistic quality), held an academic
conference in commemoration of the August 12, 1952 massacre of the Yiddish
writers, and toured Jewish sites in Kiev and environs including Babi Yar.

The seminar was located in a sanitorium in Puscha Vodizha, the woods and
lake resort area outside of Kiev, the spacious setting both indoors and
rustic outdoors, offering conditions conducive to the learning and Jewish
living experience we sought to maintain.  Faculty and students were housed
in the same building, shared the same dining room and intermixed in a total
Yiddish environment.  For half of the student body, it was the first
exposure to Yiddish. The personal interviews revealed that the memory of a
"zaide" or a "bobe", no longer alive, was an important factor in sparking
the desire to learn Yiddish, even when one or even both of the parents were
not Jewish. The level of Jewish knowledge -- except for the upper grade --
was among the lowest in years, but the motivation and intensity of interest,
the highest in the history of the seminar. One could frequently see students
studying their lessons while strolling on the campus, or returning to their
classrooms in the evenings for individual study. Another indication of high
motivation is the large attendance in the voluntary interest groups after
hours, far beyond our expectations. The faculty responded in kind.
Professors whose usual teaching assignment at home would be no more than six
hours a week, readily adhered to a schedule three times as long in our
seminar, in addition to leading the optional interest groups 3 or 4 evenings
a week.Throughout the years, our teaching staff was imbued with a sense of
mission rather than mere professional performance, as evidenced by their
serving gratis or, as in the last three years, at a salary which is a mere
fraction of what Jewish Agency "shlichim" or lecturers from abroad in other
programs in Russia receive.

The report should be understood in the light of the role of Yiddish in the
countries of the former Soviet empire. It is different from anywhere in the
world, by serving as the link with the Jewish people, religion and Israel.
There are two reasons for it. During the first two decades of communism,
Yiddish was the only form of Jewishnes permitted and even encouraged by
generous government support, while Hebrew, Jewish religion and Zionism were
ruthlessly suppressed as counter-revolutionary. In the following years, a
radical change of policy toward Yiddish conferred on it the same fate,
culminating in the execution of Yiddish writers, educators and artists, many
of them on August 12, 1952. As a result, Yiddish language and culture became
identified in the minds of Jew and non-Jew alike, both in its short day of
flourishing and long night of destruction, as the major and often sole
expression of being Jewish. The number of Yiddish speakers in Eastern Europe
today may be far less than in America or Israel, but its appeal to the
grandchildren generation is unmatched. Yiddish retains its symbolic meaning
despite the persistent and heavily subsidized efforts by the Zionist
establishment, to have it replaced by Hebrew. (Hebrew does have its place in
our Yiddish seminar, in Sabbath prayers, Z'mirot, Israel songs and the
vocabulary of over 150 terms and concepts in the course on Jewish Holidays).

The program, instituted on the initiative of Moscow Jewish students who
turned to us in 1989 to lead the first such seminar in 50 years, remains the
only channel for many a young person seeking his\her Jewish roots, in
far-flung and remotely isolated Jewish communities in Eastern Europe today.
In contrast to the plethora of Jewish educational programs sponsored by
American and Israeli agencies, ours is independent of any particular
denominational or political ties, retaining a Klal Israel commitment to the
"trinity"  of Yiddish, Jewish tradition and Israel, in all of their creative
and pluralistic forms of expression. And again in contrast, for good or
otherwise, our students seek us out, not we them.

The seminar is conducted by a small group of volunteers registered in Israel
and US as The Foundation for the Advancement of Yiddish Studies, supported
by contributions, chief among them being the Samuel A. Klurman Foundation in
Florida.

Among the cherished personal recollections of of the highly stimulating and
even inspirational encounter this summer, I have selected to record the
following: 1) Many students having no Hebrew names, we set up a "naming
committee". In some instances, the personal interview disclosed deep
sentiments harbored for a no longer living relative, particularly a
grandparent, whose memory was now to be perpetuated in the name adopted by
the descendent.This was further given religious sanction at the following
Sabbath services and recorded in the end season diploma. One student's
emotional reaction -- for the first time, I now feel I am a Jew -- gave
expression to many others. 2) In the course of a late evening stroll, my ear
caught the words and melody of a Yiddish song emanating from a group of
students gathered in one of the dormitory rooms. This was repeated on many a
night, and there were students who were accomplished singers and musicians.
3) The Oneg Shabbat spirited Z'mirot and Yiddish singing, led by students,
which would continue unceasingly beyond the dinner table into the night. 4)
The 19 year old Moscow University student who in the class on Yiddish
literature, gave me deeper insight into a poem of Itzik Manger by pointing
out the total identification of the poet with the soil of Israel, to a
degree I had not previously discerned, 5) The unannounced recitation by
heart, of the Russian rendition of Yehudah Halevi's Ode to Zion, at the
Tisha B'av service, after having it previously read in Yiddish. 6) The light
in the eyes of the woman student at the Sabbath service when her husband
recited the Torah blessings for the first time in his life, after having
received instruction at the voluntary evening study group.  7) The moving
unforgettable rendition of "Gott foon Avrohem" by a student from a dorf deep
in the heart of Russia where she was the only Jewess, having lost her mother
during the past year.

Subject: Yiddish Dance

I am new to the Mendele list.  I joined because over the past year or so I
have become very interested in Eastern European Jewish dance and have been
collecting information about the dances.  All that I have found is on my web
page (http://www.angelfire.com/ns/helenwinkler). Through searching Mendele
archives, I have found that dance/klezmer music comes up in your discussions
every so often and this information is valuble to me. I am interested in any
dance related information--everything from memories of certain dances, to
anecdotes to research articles.

An ongoing project right now is a volunteer effort to translate Isaac
Rivind's book "Klezmorim" which is a social history of klezmer published in
1960.  The book is mostly in Hebrew but also contains some Yiddish sprinkled
through the text.  I am happy to share our progress to date on this with
anyone who would like to read it.  I can e-mail it out.

Richler zogt in roman: "you're a _pusherke_. A little Jew-boy on the
make. Guys like you make me sick and ashamed" (DK, Toronto 1974, p.
284). khotsh dos iz nisht keyn ekhte definitsye, nemen ale (englishe)

I am currently working on a thesis on two novels by Mordecai Richler,
The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz and St. Urbain's Horseman. What I am
most interested in is Richler's depiction of Montreal Yiddish
communities. Thus, every now and then, I might encounter a problem which
mendele could help me to solve. And _pusherke_ is the first one.
Richler gives a definition of _pusherke_ in the text: "you're a
_pusherke_. A little Jew-boy on the make. Guys like you make me sick and
ashamed" (DK, Toronto 1974, p. 284). This is not really a satisfactory
definition. However, all the criticism that I have had access to so far
simply adopts it. I would be very grateful for a more precise definition
of _pusherke_. Is it based on English 'to push'?

a sheynem dank.

Zayd gezunt!

Subject: raysn kvorim

In translating an article from a book titled "Yidn in Ukraine" about the era
of the cantonists I came across a phrase whose meaning I can easily guess
but I would like to hear its meaning explained by someone who knows for
sure. It is in reference to Jewish communities being in such anguish &
terror at having to give up their young men & even children for the
obligatory 25 year military service by the tsar's orders that the prayer
houses were packed with people wailing & praying for help & that among other
things they "hobn gerisn kvorim". I am guessing they were pleading at the
graves of their deceased loved ones for God's intervention but I would like
to be sure.

Thanks.
