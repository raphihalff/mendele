re the use of foreign accents in (american) movies: i
really don't think you can invoke any anti-yiddish
sentiment here. what they did with enemies, a love story
and yentl is what is GENERALLY done in (american?)
movies--characters who would, if it were real-life, be
speaking a foreign lg typically speak in the accent that
speakers of that lg would have in english. just think back
to any ww2 movie at how the germans and japanese speak
(among themselves) in the movies. or zorba the greek. or
the king and i. or dr. zhivago. or cleopatra. or just about
any movie not set in middle america... (one big exception
was the recent dances with wolves, where the lakhotas speak
their own language, with subtitles. you cannot imagine how
the linguistic society of america was khalishing from sheer
joy...) (of course, this reminds me of another counter-
example--blazing saddles, where mel brooks and the other
indians speak...yiddish!)

1) _jew_ is a dirty word in many languages, indeed.  but
the point is:  when it is _not_ a dirty word (i.e., for
those to whom it should be OK, and at times and places in
society and history when it _is_ OK) it still is marked, as
(perhaps) evidenced by Jews' discomfort with it even in
contexts where nobody's shouting it in a derogatory manner.

2) bimkhile, kh'bet iber ayer koved, ir zolt mir moykhl
zayn di reyd, ir zolt mikh antshuldikn.  these are some of
the equivalents for 'excuse the expression', 'pardon my
'French"'.  when we quit the computer tonight, let's look
in Stutshkov's _oytser_ under _grobkayt_ or something of
that nature. under the column "frazeologye" he'll probably
have some answers.

3) _klafte_ has a "light" l [klyafte] in the speech of one
tshernovitser i know (whose family comes from podolye).  in
those parts:  also [a klyal] 'a klal', [klyopn]
'klopn/klapn'.  this doesn't address the question of why
the vowel, tho'.

[David Sherman says:]
...
And, to digress somwehat, where does the interpolation of
"excuse me" *before* a reference to a "dirty" subject come from?
I've heard it in English, from Yiddish speakers, but not in Yiddish.
What's the Yiddish form?"
 
It seems to me quite standard, in the form 'zayt mir
 moykhl' (hope transcription is ok!!!) or 'a mekhile'
 
[Yude-Layb Proger says:]
 
 but where does
/klafte/ come from? the /f/ before /t/ is no problem, but
where is the pasach from.
 
in 1910 Golumb (p. 188) suggested the word is from H.
_kalba_ (which is 'bitch' in the straight and figurative
senses) or _kalvito_ which I don't know. "
 
The 'real' form of 'kelev' is 'kalb' with a pata`h; you can
 see it eg in the possessive forms: 'kalbi', etc. This is
 standard in Hebrew.

1)  Nothing in the Atlas about klafte; my guess would have
been that it was somehow derived from the plural "klavim".
Is that too simple?
 
2) "You should excuse me" is very much the Yiddish "zayt
mir moykhl/ir zolt mir moykhl zayn/ikh bet iber ayer
koved" at the point of saying something off- color. You
should read James Matisoff's wonderful study "Blessings,
curses, hopes, and fears:psycho-ostensives in Yiddisdh".
Published by ISHI, Phil.1979. 3) Is it "to welsh on a bet
or to welch"? I never thought to look, BUT, look up the
strange history of "Welsh" as it enters into German as
Rotwelsch 'thieves' cant', I think, also "Kauderwelsch"
(exact meaning escapes me). Welsh, cognate with Gaul, (cf.
"walnut"--Yiddish "velishe nis", etc.) in one form or
another occurs in European languages, originally as a
reference to the Romance and! the Celtic languages and
generally meaning"strange", "unintelligible" (cf. It's
Greek to me" and the like). Did I say all that? So early in
the morning?

Mikhl.

Subject: excuse me

In Sholem Aleykhem's work, you often find the interposed
'hot keyn faribl nit' where in yinglish we would say 'you
should excuse my saying it'. For example, 'er iz gegangn,
hot keyn faribl nit, mitn pupik in droysn'.

I have never seen 'faribl' in a positive sentence.  Does it
exist in that form?
