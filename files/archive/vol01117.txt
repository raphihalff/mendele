Subject: Cotton-maker

The members of our Yiddish reading group at the University
of Connecticut would like to know the origin or the
folklore underlying the use of vatenmakher 'cotton-maker'
in a curse. We came across it today in our read- ing of
Sholem Aleichem's story hayntige kinder. Tevye the dairyman
says to his horse, "khapt dikh der vatenmakher," after the
horse has raced downhill and turned the wagon over. What is
so dire about being taken away by the cotton- maker?

The   nasalization question gets more and more interesting.
Does anyone have access to the Israeli research project
(the name escapes me) which recorded (is recording) the
reading traditions of the many eydoth? Shlomo Morag (HU
Jerusalem) should be able to help with comparative
evidence.

Noyekh: Mendele needs a secretary to collate all this
material under topical headings (or do you have a computer
program that does it). Great stuff!

Mikhl.

robert hoberman's notes on negative concord in modern
hebrew are really interesting! one of my main interests is
how languages influence each other and i didn't know about
this at all. yes, if biblical hebrew didn't have negative
concord, then a yiddish provenance for negative concord in
modern hebrew seems very possible. do you happen to know if
(uneducated) yemenites have negative concord in their
hebrew too?

one little difference between yiddish and the hebrew 
system you describe is in:

>(Note that /shum yeled/ is really negative: Who ate latkes?
>Shum yeled.  'No child.')  

i think in yiddish it would be 'keyn kind nisht', not just
'keyn kind'. here yiddish differs from french and, i think,
the slavic languages, which don't have the 'not' when it's
just a noun phrase, not a whole clause. i'm not sure about
bavarian german on this.

but:

>Further: /SHUM yeled AF paam LO
>akhal levivot be-SHUM mesiba/ 'No child ever ate latkes at
>any party.'  Or, Have you every been to Eilat?  Af paam lo.
>'Never, keyn mol nisht.'  

i take it 'af' is a negative word? if so, then af paam lo
would be like the yiddish, with both the negative
quantifier/determiner (af?/keyn) and the negation word
(lo/nisht), different from, say, french, which just uses
'jamais', not '*jamais pas', when that's the whole
utterance.

you've certainly inspired a very nice term paper topic for
some lucky student next term! a dank.
