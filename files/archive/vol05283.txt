Subject: Vayomer-dovid-glitshn

While translating a memoir written in the '40s, I found in a passage about
winter sports in Keidan, the term "vayomer dovid glitshn". Surprisingly (to me)
Harkavy translates this as "skating while covering one's eyes with an arm."

The phrase apparently derives from the psalm, "vayomer dovid" ("And David
declared...") traditionally said while covering the eyes. It seems to make
sense linguistically, but athletically I can't figure it out. Has anyone ever
heard of such a game?

Subject: Prezhnitse

Stutchkoff (p. 227, left column) includes 'prezhenitse' in the
omelet/scrambled eggs subgroup. Curiously, among the many food groups under
his number 258 he has none for "fried matza". 'matse-bray' is found only among
the pap-foods (p. 225, col. right), in agreement with Harkavy. The term in my
family 'gefrishte matse' is nowhere found, though Weinreich has 'gefrisht
broyt' = french toast. Why does this maykhl have so many makeshift names? Is
fried matza as American as chow mein?

Subject: U's and i's and i's and ii's

Jonathan Bellman [5.282] misunderstands:

Where 'son' is _zun_ and 'sons' is _zin_, _zun_ and _zin_ are _never_
homonyms--by definition. However, in a relatively small area, along the
Polish-Lithuanian border, the Yiddish words for 'son', 'sun', and 'sons' (and
'mind') _are_ homonyms. All are realized with /i/, as either [zin] or [ziin], in
an area in which i) all historical _u_'s and _i_'s have merged in _i(i)_ and
ii)  the difference between long and short _i_ is not distinctive.

Elsewhere, in the so-called _i_ area (where all Litvish _u_ vowels are
realized as _i_), short /i/ in such words as _zin_ 'sun' is distinctively
different from long /ii/ in such words _ziin_ 'son(s)'. Along the
Belorussian-Ukrainian border (in Volhynia) the word for 'to see', normally
_zen_ or _zeyn_, may also enter the picture either as _zin_ or _ziin_.

In parallel fashion, Litvish _i_ vowels, are differentially realized in the
Polish-Ukrainian so-called _i_ area, as short /i/ in such words as _din_
'thin', 'law',  _bin_ 'am', _shif_ 'ship', _shpin_ 'spider', _shtil_ 'quiet',
as against long /ii/ in _diinim_ 'laws', _biin_ 'bee', _griin_ 'green', _tiif_
'deep', _shtiil_ 'shaft (of a knife)'.

Get it?

Subject: Der ruakh

In 5.280,2 Arre Komar writes of the "common Yiddish expletive  'der roykh zol
zey nemen'," [roykh meaning smoke]. Sorry, there was never such a _klole_
[curse]. He either misheard it, or misconstrued it.  The expression was always
"der _ruakh_ zol zey nemen," ruakh (Hebrew) meaning wind, and served as an
elliptical saying, in which the adjective _beyzer_ (ill, evil) was left
unspoken for superstitious reasons, as if the very mention of the ill, evil
wind would be considered a call, an invitation to show up "in person"...

Subject: Roykh and ruakh

I would like to add to the general confusion concerning the origin of these
words. i've always understood roykh to be the yiddish equivalent of german
'rauch'.

the word 'ruach' also exists in at least one german dialect (bavarian), and it
is used to refer in a very negative way to a person who will always try to get
more than his/her fair share of something. the adjectival form is 'ruachet' or
'ruachat' (i'm unsure of the spelling, since i've never seen it written).

could this have something to do with the yiddish/hebrew meaning of ruakh as
'bad spirit'? a sheynem dank.

Subject: Dina Abramowicz (zol zi gezunt zayn!)

I would like to direct the attention of Mendelyaners to the new issue of the
National Yiddish Book Center's "Der Pakn-Treger/ The Book Peddler."  The cover
story is devoted to Dina Abramowicz, reference librarian, and previously head
librarian (1962-1987), of YIVO.  The article, entitled "Keeper of a
Civilization," is by The Book Peddler's editor, Jeff Sharlet, and is based on
extensive interviews with Dina and on the writer's observations of a legendary
librarian at work.  From the contents page:

"'As a librarian,' says Dina Abramowicz, 'I have an irrational attraction to
the *past*.'  Still working at age 86, Dina Abramowicz reflects on her life in
the stacks, from tending Vilna's War-time ghetto library to presiding over the
collection of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, where she has been
saving the past -- and looking to the future -- for more than four decades."

See pages 9-21 of "The Book Peddler," no. 21 (Spring 1996).

Subject: A poeme vegn eyfelekh

The Yiddish class I take at the University of Toronto read Moyshe Nadir's
poems "Yidn un Tshvekes" (Jews and Nails) and several poems entitled "Dos
Lebn".  Our homework was to write a poem in the style of Nadir. Mendelyaner
parents, especially, might find this result amusing.

A Lebn un an Eyfele ("a life and a baby") --
stil un sentimentn loyt Moyshe Nadir

Vos iz der shaykhes tsvishn a lebn un an eyfele?
Vos iz a lebn un vos iz an eyfele?

An eyfele iz geferlekh kleyn.
Dos lebn oykh.

An eyfele hot nisht keyn tseyn
un ken fort baysn.
Dos lebn oykh.

An eyfele shtinkt amol.
A lebn iz amol farshtunken.

Ale hobn lib an eyfele
un yene vos hobn faynt eyfelekh shemen zikh
un redn nisht derfun.
Di zelbe zakh mitn lebn.

An eyfele redt nisht.
Me veys nisht, vos es vil.
An eyfele iz nisht tsu farshteyn.
Dos lebn oykh nisht.

Ale eyefelekh hobn eyn ponim,
nor yederer meynt
az zayn eyfele iz andersh fun ale andere.
Yederer meynt oykh
az zayn lebn iz andersh fun ale andere.

Az me halt an eyfele un me tantst a bisl
vert es gliklekh.
Di zelbe zakh mitn lebn.

Subject: a libe iz dos an umglik af der velt

[5.282]

I believe that this is from an old yiddish/russian folk song that can be found
in the book "Old Jewish Folk Music: The Collections and Writings of Moshe
Beregovski", edited and translated by Mark Slobin, University of Pennsylvania
Press, 1982

The name of the song appears to be "Ver se zogt, az a libe iz a grojs glik"
and can be found on page 333.

Subject: Music to a libe iz an umglik af der velt

There was a wonderful version of "a libe iz an umglik..." which I sang in a
mitlshul chorus with Moyshe Rauch in the 50s. If there are records out there
from the Jewish Music Alliance (of the JPFO/IWO), or anyone who is in touch
with the Jewish Peoples Philharmonic Chorus (Peter Schlosser in the CCNY music
department may still be the conductor), they may remember the version we sang.
My section kept up a kind of hurdy-gurdy sound (un nat nat, un nat nat, unat
unat unat unat unat unat) through the whole song.
