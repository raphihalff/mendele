Subject: Weinreich's phrasebook 

I am hesitant to wade into this fray, but the recent assertion by Mr. Mordkhe 
Shaechter [7.025] that "the author of that article has already apologized to
B. Weinreich" compels me to step in. I have been following the recent
exchanges over my article in Civilization ever since an interested party
began forwarding them to me last week. They can, as far as I can tell, be
divided among those who got it, those who most decidely did not, and those,
like Mr. Turkel [7.024], who feel qualified to comment without having read the
article at all.  Since I can neither speak nor read Yiddish in any but the
most rudimentary fashion, I don't know what Mr. Adam Whiteman had to say. 

People who get the piece recognize, first of all, that a book which
explicitly advertises itself, on the cover, in capital letters, as a
PHRASEBOOK FOR TRAVELLERS, naturally, logically, and commercially implies
the existence of a country to be travelled to.  A country.  An entire
nation.  Not a neighborhood like Crown Heights.  Not the annual meeting of a
Yiddish language society or a Folksbeine.  No one takes a Chinese phrasebook
for travellers to Chinatown or a Chinese New Year's Parade.  Even if someone
might, such certainly would not be the imagined market for a series of
traveller's phrasebooks.

This inherent implication is the central pillar of my ruminative essay (not
a book review, not an analysis of the current state of Yiddish). There is a
phrase given in the book, with Yiddish translation:  Where can I get the
boat/ferry to --------?   My essay simply tries to imagine different ways to
fill in that blank (that is, to imagine a place where one takes a ferry
either to or from a country whose principal language is Yiddish).  _Now._ 
Post 1958, when the book was published.  Not in the twenties during some
shortlived Soviet republic.  Not in Israel shortly after its founding.  But
now, when the book, with its series of useful phrases for visits to auto
mechanics and airline ticket offices, is still apparently very much in
print. Where, in 1997, could you go that it would behoove you to know how to
say, in Yiddish, "Which way to the casino?"  

The second thing people who get the piece recognize, I think, is that
however many people are still reading, speaking, and enjoying Yiddish, and
however many young people are taking up the study of the language--however
vital is the spirit of Yiddish revival--something has been lost. Something
immense and profound. I don't know anything about Mendele and its ways. 
Perhaps this statement will bring the wrath of the entire subscribership
down upon me.   But I believe it.  If this causes some of you to pity me, or
shake your heads, or even wish, with Mr. Turkel, to excoriate me, so be it. 
There is no nation to take the Weinreichs' little phrasebook to; for every
other language in the series, such a country exists.  That difference
saddens me.  

In the course of a recent, and personally frustrating correspondence with
Ms. Beatrice Weinreich, I did express my apologies to her--but not, as Mr.
Schaechter seems to imply, for what I wrote. I stand foursquare behind every
single word of that essay, without apology. What I regret is the hurt
feelings and grief that my words evidently brought to a woman whose work I
respect. It was a harsh blow to her to discover that someone thought her
phrasebook was, among many other things, and in the saddest way, funny. (I
gather from this list that I am not entirely alone in thinking so.)  I have
tried to explain to Ms. Weinreich that she, like some members of this list,
had misinterpreted both the spirit and the letter of my essay.  I love
Yiddish. I love being Jewish. I love language and humor.  All of these
inspired my writing.  The desire to hurt, offend, or insult Yiddish scholars
and lovers of Yiddish did not make up even one atom of my motivation.  My
only desire was to report faithfully how the book made me feel, and the
fancies it conjured in my imagination.

In her initial letter, and in her subsequent, generally unmollified reply to
my reply, Ms. Weinreich argued, as have some members of this list, first of
all, that the book could be useful for trips to Crown Heights or
Williamsburg, for example; and second, that it might come in handy in
Israel, or perhaps would have come in handy in Israel at an earlier time in
the book's life.  My principal rejoinder to these arguments has already been
made: a phrasebook for travellers implies a country whose principal language
is that of the phrasebook.  Sure, there are, or could be, exceptions to
this.  There could be a phrasebook for travellers in Romany, say, that might
be useful under certain conditions, or one in Latin that might at some time
have come in handy in the Vatican.   With regard to Israel, and the argument
that there were or are many Yiddish speakers there who, as Ms. Weinreich
attempted to convince me, felt or feel at sea in a land of Hebrew, I fail to
understand how they would have benefited from an English-Yiddish phrasebook.
Yiddish-Hebrew,  perhaps.  As for the English speaking traveller, if I had
been going to Israel in 1959, say, I doubt I would have chosen an
English-Yiddish phrasebook to be my companion.  

AIl this is, however, completely beside my point.  I wasn't interested in
writing about whether this book was, or could be, useful; it is evident to
anyone not blinded by sentiment or passion that such a book is, in a practical 
sense, all but useless. What interested me was imagining another world in 
which a Yiddish phrasebook for travellers would have an obvious referent, one 
with the official passports, customs agents, airlines, and ferry companies 
that play such a prominent (and, to me, poignant) role in the phrase book.  
The more I thought about, and imagined this country, the sadder I felt at its 
absence, a sadness which --for me, the only person I ever claimed to be 
speaking for--no amount of extinct Soviet republics, Chasidic neighborhoods, 
and Yiddish preservation and renewal societies will ever completely abate. 

I'm sorry if this angers, hurts or irritates some people, or everyone who
reads this post.  I'm sorrier still for anyone who can't see the humor--the
heartbreaking, wistful, uproarious humor--in the book.  But I don't regret a
word of what I wrote.  On the contrary, Mr. Schaechter.

Subject: Yiddish accordeon on WWW in realaudio

Societe Radio Canada (our French radio d'etat) broadcasts in realaudio on a 
permanent basis. If you have access this technology (unfortunately I don't) 
and have been waiting for an excuse to try it, "la boite a frissons", this 
coming Sunday, July 6, at 17:05 EDT, will feature yiddish accordeon (a 
25-minute program).

URL: http://www.src-mtl.com/index.htm : click on "ecoutez la radio en direct!", 
then, for the above program, click on FM. Programs (daily, weekly template) 
are also available on the Web site.

Sunday afternoons (on FM) feature music from everywhere in the world and, of 
course, from time to time, Yiddish (eg. recently, a concert by Jacinta, my 
favorite singer). If there's interest and this works out (technically), I 
could certainly keep this list posted whenever I see more good stuff 
(nothing else before September I'm afraid).

P.S. for those living near the province of Quebec, the following FM
frequencies might be usable: Quebec: 95,3; Moncton: 98,3; Montreal:
100,7; Rimouski: 101,5; Ottawa-Hull: 102,5; Trois-Rivieres: 104,3.
