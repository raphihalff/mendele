Subject: Re: The State of Yiddish

Khaver Gillig's causerie fails to move me. I return to the findings of
Professors Gonshor and Shaffir, reinforced by my own experience.

Haredim choose to cloister themselves in 'enclaves' and use the Yiddish
language as one of the tools to isolate themselves from what they see as a
hostile, and threatening outside secular world. For all the difference it
makes, the Yiddish could be replaced with a customized pig-Latin, so long
as it serves the purpose of isolating them from the outside world.

The Haredim are not re-creating a "cultural matrix." They have a very
rigorously controlled homogeneity, which is very unlike the seething,
boiling world of I. L. Peretz, and his contemporaries, where traditional
religion collided with Enlightenment, Zionism, socialism and atheism. None
of this is tolerated within the Eruv of the currently Yiddish-speaking
ultra-orthodox.

Without that ferment, what he wants to happen cannot -- and will not --
happen.

Thank you, Leizer Gillig. That was the most intelligent Mendele post ever.
Might as well close the shop down now.

Subject: Re: The state of Yiddish

For those Mendelyaner who get a deja vue feeling following the present
discussion about the state of Yiddish: Have a second look at

http://shakti.trincoll.edu/~mendele/vol09/vol09006.txt and
http://shakti.trincoll.edu/~mendele/vol09/vol09009.txt

These reactions were written following the publication of Janet Hadda's
article, "Yiddish in Contemporary American Culture" and Iosif Vaisman's
response. The "is Yiddish dead or alive" question pops up regularly on
the list, but 1999 was a paricularly good year.

Subject: the future of Yiddish

Very interesting, all this recent discusssion!

A few crotchets, more or less at random:

1) Omen v 'omen to whoever praised the stories of Yonia Fayn.

2) People interested in possible synergies between Yiddishists and Hasidim
might want to look at Brukhe Lang's thoughtful piece on the subject in the
most recent issue of _Afn shvel_.

3) About such synergies - look, as has been stated, Yiddish is in fact a
living language among Hasidim.  So in one sense we don't have to worry
about the future of Yiddish.  What we have to worry about is whether the
future of Yiddish will have any continuity with its great literary past,
and with the Yiddishist community of the present.  And my own view about
that is pessimistic, partly on the basis of the aforementioned article.
For one thing, while Yiddishists might seek such a result, might seek to
ally with Hasidim in search of a common love for Yiddish, I'm not sure
Hasidim would have any interest in such a result;  what's in it, after
all, for them?   (A few years ago, a guy from the local Lubavitch center,
named I think Hirsh Zarhki (I could be misremembering) walked half a block
to the Arbeter-Ring in Brookline, near Boston, to give a Yiddish lecture
on some aspects of Hasidism.   Attendance was better than usual, and lots
of people in the audience had real curiosity, and real knowledge, about
the Hasidic world.  But I'm not sure the speaker had a comparable
curiosity about the Yiddishist world he'd ventured into.  (I could be
wrong, but he surely didn't manifest any that afternoon - except, of
course, that he was there in the first place.)   Moreover, at some point,
aren't Yiddishists on their side going to hold back from a full synergy
with Hasidism, simply because they - some of them, at any rate - are so
uneasy about Hasidic practice and so full of dissent from Hasidic doctrine?

Subject: Yiddish and the Past Conditional

I have a Yiddish grammar question.  It is hard to believe that this
question has not been answered long ago in a grammar book or linguistics
article.  Those of you who teach Yiddish may have heard it from your
beginning Yiddish students and may have a ready answer.

Every beginner learns that the present tense of the Yiddish conditional is
formed by using the auxiliary verb "voltn" plus the infinitive (e.g. "ikh
volt nemen"), and that the past conditional is formed by using the same
auxiliary plus the past participle (e.g. "ikh volt genumen").

My question is:  Why does Yiddish seem to have a prejudice in favor of the
past conditional, using it even in contexts where the present conditional
would serve well and would seem to be more logical?

Here are just a few examples where the context suggests that the speaker is
speaking about the present, yet he/she uses the past conditional (in
brackets I indicate what might strike a beginner as more logical):

1. Oyb es volt geven [zayn] in shtub a bisl bronfn, volt ikh genumen
[nemen].  (Immanuel Olsvanger, Royte Pomerantsn, page 106)  [A beginner
might also expect:  "Oyb es iz do in shtub a bisl bronfn, volt ikh nemen."]

2. Volt ikh geven [zayn] a rov, ken ikh nit keyn toyre; volt ikh geven
[zayn] a soykher, hob ikh nit keyn skhoyre.  (Yudl Mark, Gramatik fun der
yidisher klal-shprakh, p. 290)

3. Ven s'volt nit geven [zayn] mayn nar, volt ikh oykh gelakht [lakhn].
(Ibid)

4. ....Ven men derzet mikh, a bakantn yidn, Mendele Moykher-Sforim, vi ikh
for do in a baydl mit a por oksn, volt men zikh mistome tsunoyfgelofn
[tsunoyfloyfn] kind un keyt, men volt gemakht [makhn] a vare.... (Mendele
Moykher Sforim, Der Khilef,
http://yiddish.haifa.ac.il/PDF%20Stories/Der_khilef.pdf)

5. -- Tomer volt dos a mol gehat [hobn] an ek? -- misht zikh arayn di mame,
lebn zol zi.  (Sholem Aleykhem, Kidalto Vekidashto,
http://yiddish.haifa.ac.il/PDF%20Stories/Kidalto%20vekidashto.pdf)

6. In Bontshen tseveynt zikh dos harts....Er volt shoyn atsind di oygn
geefnt [efenen], nor zey zenen farfintstert fun trern.... (Y. L. Perets,
Bontshe Shvayg, http://yiddish.haifa.ac.il/PDF%20Stories/Bontshe.pdf)

I am puzzled by this preference for the past conditional even when the
present conditional would seem to be more logical.  Can anybody throw light
on this phenomenon?

Subject: Re: grine bleter

The Freedman Catalogue contains records about two versions:

1) shpil tsigayner, mir a lidl, "grine bleter" oyf dayn fidl...

and

2) ikh zing, vayl ikh hob lib twu zingen...

with track comment: Is beginning of song "Manger's" or added by
"Oysher"?

Another Freedman's source, apparently, is an article in the Forverts,
April 16, 2003", but, unfortunately, I have no access to Forverts
archives.

Here is a list of records that refers to Moyshe Oysher
as the "grine bleter" author.

1) Mimi Sloan Sings Moishe Oysher Melodies (Tikva Records T102)
Side 2. Track No.4 Grine Bleter. (Author - M.Oysher)

2) Marry Soriano (Gal-Ron L-5791)
Side 2. Track No.3 Grine bletter. (Folk - M.Oysher)
Unbelievable, but comment in Yiddish refers to I.Manger - M.Oysher!

3) Many years ago I had a cassette named "Moyshe Oysher sings Moyshe
Oysher".

Subject: alt-yidish

Mendelistn will find two particularly interesting articles in the September
23 issue of the Forverts.  Both are to be found on line
(http://yiddish.forward.com/) but the reader will have to hunt through the
menu.

The first is an interview with Shloyme Berger of the University of
Amsterdam, "di tsukunft fun yidish iz in di hent fun der inteligents".  The
second, by Jerold C. Fraikes of the University of Southern California is
"di forshung fun alt-yidish haynt tsu tog".

A third article, unfortunately not archived, is "di eltere literatur", by
Nokhem Shtif, originally published in 1919 and well worth reading today.

The editors of the Forverts deserve our thanks for publishing such
articles.  And (finally!) for providing proper bibliographic details of
books discussed.
