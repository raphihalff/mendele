Subject: News from Onkelos

The initial phase of the Onkelos project is drawing to a close, with
all but one of the stories we could find from _A Treasury of Yiddish
Stories_, edited by Irving Howe and Eliezer Greenberg, now available in
modern Yiddish.  The final story is the magnificent "mayn krig mit
Hersh Raseyner"  by Chaim Grade and will soon be ready.
http://shakti.trincoll.edu/~mendele/hgyid.htm
Leonard Prager and I served as co-editors.

Onkelos goes on however.  A second book of stories, _Found Treasures_,
edited by Frieda Forman, Ethel Raicus, Sarah Silberstein Swartz and
Margie Wolfe.  The Yiddish originals are being edited by Shoshke-Rayzl
Juni.

A third Onkelos series now under way will deal with biography and
memoirs of such figures as Sholem Aleikhem, the brothers Singer, Sholem
Asch, and many more.

Finally, thanks to Leonard Prager some of the Howe-Greenberg stories
have been recorded by Sara Blacher-Retter for di velt fun yidish
http://haifa.yidish.ac.il.  Links to these are also to be found on
http://shakti.trincoll.edu/~mendele/hgyid.htm.  Choose a story with the
speaker image next to it, then click on the RealAudio icon.  I hope and
expect that many more will be on tap a year from this date.

It goes without saying that nothing described above would have been
remotely possible without the devoted work of those who performed the
tedious task of transcribing the original texts, not to mention the
error-checking and proof-reading.  Their names apppear at the end of
each story in small letters, but that should not be taken as a gauge of
their importance to the enterprise.

Subject: YIVO Summer Program 2002

THE YIDDISH SUMMER PROGRAM -- JUNE 24-AUGUST 2, 2002

The Uriel Weinreich Program, located on Columbia University's
Morningside Heights campus, offers peerless instruction in Yiddish
language, and an in-depth exploration of the literature and culture of
East European/American Jewry. The core of the program is an intensive
3-credit language course (9am-12:30pm, Monday through Friday) at one of
four levels, designed to develop proficiency in speaking, reading and
writing, as well as cultural literacy, in a concentrated period of
time. As an essential complement to the morning course, students are
required to attend Yiddish conversation classes and can choose from
among several workshops and lecture series (1:30-6pm, Monday through
Thursday). In addition, there are related excursions and social events
on some evenings and Sundays. The intensive nature of the program
precludes employment or enrollment in other courses, and allows only
limited time for tourism.

Because the program is offered in conjunction with the Max Weinreich
Center for Advanced Jewish Studies of the YIVO Institute for Jewish
Research, students have the opportunity to visit YIVO at its new home
in the Center for Jewish History, and to become acquainted with YIVO's
Library and Archives, one of the world's major collections of materials
for the study of East European and American Yiddish culture.

vibrant facets of the Yiddish cultural legacy.

REFRESHER COURSE
Tuesday, June 11 through Friday, June 21
Students applying for the intermediate or advanced courses are strongly

Subject: Nominations for National Jewish Book Award, Yiddish Category

Dear Mendelists,

I have been asked to help solicit nominations for the National Jewish
Book Award; the Yiddish category covers anything in Yiddish or about
Yiddish culture.  The book may have been published anywhere (from
January 2001 until April 2002), but it must have U.S. distribution and
the publisher must be willing to send 4 copies--for the judges--and $36
to the National Jewish Book Council.  New editions (but not reprints)
also qualify.

Please let me know of any appropriate books for nomination by sending a
message to <kfrieden@mailbox.syr.edu>.

Thanks,

Ken Frieden

Subject: new book: Juedische Musiktraditionen/Jewish Musical Traditions

We are pleased to announce the publication of:

Rita Ottens/Joel Rubin
Juedische Musiktraditionen (Jewish Musical Traditions)
Musikpraxis in der Schule, Band 4 (Music in the Schools, vol. 4)
ISBN 3-7649-2694-5
BE 2684, ca. 144 Seiten/pages
mit/with CD DM 49,80
12 December, 2001
Gustav Bosse Verlag , Kassel, Germany

Juedische Musiktraditionen (in German) is intended for use by school
teachers and other interested readers. It provides an introduction to
the spectrum of Jewish music -- religious and secular, Ashkenazic and
Sephardic -- via case studies of selected traditions (with accompanying
CD). It includes a discussion of time-honored questions such as "what
is Jewish music?" and "is there such a thing as Jewish music?," at the
same time deconstructing many of the myths surrounding the subject. The
book begins with a critical essay by Rita Ottens on the problematics
related to the performance, study and reception of Jewish musical
traditions in contemporary Germany.
