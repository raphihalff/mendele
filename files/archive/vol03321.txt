Subject: Petcha

Thank you Bob Rothstein for the scholarly review of petcha theory and
practice.  Personally, I could never appreciate this particular dish.
When we were in Russia in 1992, our hosts referred to petcha as
"cholodnaya."  Fortuantely I was able to cop a plea of "kosher, sorry"
and was spared.  I did note that for some of our family in Ukraine who
were at that time experiencing severe food shortages, petcha with more
gelatin than marrow or eggs was helping them stretch the food they did
have.  The whole subject makes one want a sip of shchav.

Subject: Miami in fiction

To Henry Breitrose:

I am in my office and don't have the volume in hand, but Cynthia Ozick's
harrowing "The Shawl" has a sequel set in Miami which was originally
published in the New Yorker.  Perhaps other Mendelenikes will recall the
story. It was about the nature of memory-- Holocaust memories "vs"
Jewish-American.

Louis, a hartsikn dank for the wonderful Sholem Aleichem letters.

Subject: The Yidishe Gauchos---a documentary

I'm the director of a 1/2 hour video about Jews who emigrate from the
Pale at the turn of the century and came to the Argentine pampas.  There
they became ranchers and farmers and as the saying goes "We palnted wheat
and grew doctors."

The program is narrated by Eli Wallach, screened at MOMA and at the
Smithsonian and won awards at festivals here and abroad.  It's now
available from the National Center for Jewish Film.  Lown Building 102;
Brandeis University; Waltham, MA; 02254-9110; 617 899-7044; FAX 617
736-2070

As many of you know Yiddish culture in Argentina flourished with
newspapers, theater, poetry, novels etc.  All of this was a part of the
rich life and history of the Jewish agricultural colonies there.

Can anyone help us locate list electronic or snail of Argentines and/or
Yiddishists who might be intrested in our "little known story of Jewish
cowboys?   Thanks for your help.   Questions?

Mfreeman@pitzer.claremont.edu or call me here at Pitzer College

Subject: Telser yeshiva location

In reply to Auslin, The Telser yeshiva was located in Telzhe, Lithuania--
NOT in Poland.  When I was in Lithuania in 1991, my regional Jewish
antiquities guide informed me that the site of the famous yeshiva, like
many other sites, had just been (this was shortly after independence) or
was about to be commemmorated with a plaque.  As with the plaques I saw
in Vilna, Kovno, etc., I assume it will be in Yiddish, Hebrew, and
Lithuanian.  Telzhe at that time was I believe in the top 5 of "Jewish"
towns in population, after Vilnius, Kaunas, etc.  That would probably
mean about 50 Jews left, but THEY would doubtless know Yiddish! The
Yeshiva, by the way, was transferred to Ohio somewhere, and sends me
candles for Chanuka and dried kharoses mix for Pesach, soliciting
donations.

Subject: Ton/tin

First, let me introduce myself.  My name is Jeremy Eckhause(Yankel
Ekhoyz).  Although I am not fluent in Yiddish, I do understand the spoken
language.  I also have a more extensive knowledge of Modern Standard
German(Hochdeutsch).  My knowledge of Yiddish is only from the German and
a few Yiddish expression, as I am only 19 and live in southern Virginia.

Although I have limited knowledge of Yiddish, and I am not quite fluent
in German, I am unclear about Ralf Arnemann's translation of the Yiddish.
Although I am not entirely sure, the Yiddish verb "lernen" means the
English verb to teach and the German "lehren".  I have read the verse
from "Afn Pripetshik": "Un der Rebbe lernt kleine Kinderlach dem allef
beis." This cannot mean that the rabbi learns from the children, rather
he teaches them.

I believe oysgelernt means learned, as opposed to taught.  Would this not
be translated into German as gelernt, not ausgelernt?  I have never come
across the word "ausgelernt" in German prose.

The Yiddish "kuken" is translated, to my knowledge, "gucken", which means
to look or look at.  Rather than "kochen" which means solely to cook.  A
Yiddish speaker informs me that the German "kochen" translates as the
Yiddish "kuchen", not "kuken".  To make matters more complicated, the
German "Kuchen" means cake, which in Yiddish is "Lekach".

Of course, then there is kacken, which ya'll remember from "alterkacker".
In summary, Mr. Gildemeister makes an important point. There cant be just
superficial translations, in many cases, between Yiddish and German.
Indeed studying both these languages, I can recognize how similar, but
often quite different, these languages are.

PS  Also, I am not clear on the translation, "Ich tu kochen"  In
Hochdeutch, tun, means to make or do. One does not "make cook".
