Subject: Re: oy veh

Tayere Khaverim,

In Mendele 10.0004, Paul Ilie asks about the etymology of 'oy veh'. Here
is the etymology which I have always had in mind:

Yiddish 'oy weh' derives from German 'oweh!' (which is also suggested by
the present transliteration 'weh' instead of the probably more common
'vey' or 'vay'). 'oweh' is as an interjection a contraction of "o! +
weh", "o" being roughly the Yiddish 'oy' and "weh" (derived from the
noun 'Weh' - woe, pain, grief), being roughly the English "alas!".

An etymological relationship between 'oy vey' and 'oweh' is also
strongly suggested by the Yiddish phrase '(oy,) vey iz mir', where 'vey'
exactly parallels the High German 'weh' in 'es ist mir weh ums Herz'
(more or less literally: "there is WEH around my heart",  "my heart is
aching/grieving for/about something or someone").

Although I could not find an etymology for 'oy' or even the whole
phrase, here is at least what I have got on my shelves about 'veh/vey':

Wolf gives: 'wei' =3D int. wehe (> middle high German 'we' =3D woe, pain,=
grief) (Siegmund A. Wolf. Jiddisches W=F6rterbuch. Wortschatz des
deutschen Grundbestandes der jiddischen (j=FCdischdeutschen) Sprache.
Hamburg: Buske, 2, 1991 (1st ed: Mannheim: Bibliographisches Institut
1962).

DUDEN has: "wej!' =3D Interj. 'wehe!"; 'wej is mir!" =3D 'o weh!".
(Jiddisches W=F6rterbuch. Mannheim: Duden, 2, 1992).

Subject: Sholem Aleichem's funeral

Sholem Aleichem's burial. On  the occassion of Sholem Aleichem's tenth
yahrzeit, (1926), Ernestine Berkovitz compiled "Dos Sholem Aleichem Buch".
In this book are photos from the funeral and of the grave of Sholem
Aleichem. It indicates that Sholem Aleichem was buried in the Har Carmel
Cemetary in the Arbeter Ring Section in Brooklyn, N.Y..  One side of the
matzevah is in Yiddish and one side is in Hebrew.

Subject: The state of Yiddish

I found Leonard Prager's message on "Original and Translated Texts" [TMR
4.009] very sad, coming on the heels of Ben Fogel's message [Mendele 10.006]
on "Translating a Yizkor Book." I wonder if khaver Prager would have written
it the same way, had he read khaver Fogel's message (which I think he could
not have had the time to do).

Several issues are interwoven in this message, and each is of sufficient
importance that they be allowed to stand alone for serious examination. I
will try to separate them out, and offer at least one man's opinion on them.

1. Access to our collective Eastern European history and literature in
Yiddish.

I am sure that there is no dispute concerning the need to make the rich and
precious body of writing in Yiddish, created during the last couple of
centuries, accessible and tractable to future generations. While I am an
unqualified supporter of education in the Yiddish language, I am not an
optimist in terms of seeing this as a solution to the access problem. I
believe that what khaver Fogel has portrayed is the stark reality that we
face.  Khaver Prager articulates this very well, but he also clings to what
I believe is an illusion: that we have the capacity to 'prevent this as much
as possible.'

I don't think we can prevent this. For example, where is the replacement for
the late Dina Abramowicz?  The brutal fact is that the entire Eastern
European Jewish cultural and linguistic matrix was uprooted and cauterized.
There simply is neither a critical mass, continuity, nor the same need for a
lingua franca such as mameloshn, as we move into the new millennium. Khaver
Prager himself recognizes this when he casts totally justifiable doubt on
the efficacy of the Russian Onkelos program in its purported attempt to
train Yiddish translators in a matter of two years. He is more than right
when he speaks of 'years, perhaps a lifetime,' to bring the right skills to
fruition.

2. The 'Uniqueness' of Yiddish

I believe that khaver Prager's remarks are generally, but not absolutely,
true for literary works in the language they were originally written. In
this regard, I don't see Yiddish as 'unique.' From a purely _personal_ point
of view, I find that Yiddish possesses certain terms of both endearment and
of emotional anguish that are ‘very special' to me, and possibly to other
Yiddish speakers. But surely the same must be true of certain turns of
speech in most languages of the world that have given rise to a literature.

I can remember how moved I was listening to Yevgeny Yevtushenko recite his
poem 'Babi Yar' in the original Russian. No translation of Yehuda Halevy's
"Yerushalayim" can ever sound as good as the original Hebrew. And, yes, many
pieces in Yiddish qualify as well, but _linguistically_ it doesn't make
Yiddish 'unique.'

But language is so complex a phenomenon, that even this thesis may not be
generally true. Having just completed the Shavuot holiday, I am struck by
the difference in quality I attribute to Ruth's entreaty to Naomi. The
Hebrew is terse and pithy, but the English 'Whither thou goest...' has a
haunting poetic quality that puts it in a different class of listening
experience. I have also found, over a lifetime, that the English
translations of Sholem Asch's works, and the works of I.B. Singer
represented profoundly satisfying reading. In part, that is because in
mid-20th century America, you could get the English works with relative
ease. Just recently, I came across a Yiddish edition of I.B. Singer's 'Der
Knekht.' I intend to read it, precisely for the experience of reading the
Yiddish.

Accordingly, I find the effort to search for some 'uniqueness' in Yiddish as
not helpful.

3. Writing About the Holocaust in Different Languages

One only has to listen to Elie Wiesel speak in English to realize that
neither Yiddish, nor any other language, holds any special cachet for trying
to communicate about this calamitous event.

In fact, when Wiesel is asked about how to articulate one's feelings about
the Holocaust, he will pause and say: "with silence."

4. Simultaneous access to Yiddish and other languages (i.e. English)

I prefer to see this issue in terms of convenience of information delivery.
In this respect, there is a profound difference between an internet website
and a conventional hard copy library.

When a website is available, storage capacity is really not an issue. Thus
the idea of co-locating the original Yiddish text with the translation is
probably a good thing to do. However, in creating hard copy, one must keep
in mind the need to keep the physical volume from becoming unwieldy. In the
case of hard copy, I believe that separate volumes are probably a better
solution. This, in fact, is the practice I have adopted with my own
initiatives.

	                 ****************

I am a member of a diminishing minority. There is little we can do to
reverse an historical tide we would have preferred never was set in motion.
Look at the character of the (Jewish Daily) Forward as a periodical, and one
can see why khaver Fogel wrote the way he did.

But I also agree that we need to foster an interest in Yiddish, promote its
study and assure that it maintains a position of respect and affection
within the ambit of our traditions. If in two thousand years, Yiddish
obtains a place similar to that enjoyed by Aramaic today, I think that will
be a good outcome. Not the one I would have liked, but a good outcome.

Regards
Jack Berger

From: Gevaryahu@aol.com
Subject: gevir

Sidney Bloch (v9n10) asks for the etymology of 'gevir.'

'Gevir' is a Biblical Hebrew word (Gen 27:29; 27:37) and it means master,
governor, commander. The meaning of a (very) wealthy individual developed
later according to Gur dictionary. According to Even Shoshan in Eben Ezra's
time it was the title of an important person, and so it was in the time of
Yehuda Halevi. In the time of the (Shmuel) HaNagid it is already ref. of a
rich person, and so it is being used by Mendele and Bialik. (1983 edition,
p. 155 ).

Subject: gevir

Sidney Bloch [10.010] raises many questions about the origin and use of
"gevir".  I can answer just one aspect.

The word gevir is found in the Tora in Breshit (Gen) 27,29 and there
it means master or ruler.

From: Ronald Florence <ron@18james.com>
Subject: Words for "pistol"

Paul Glasser writes regarding the use of shpayer, pistoyl & nagan:

  It seems much more likely to me that Glik, like any good writer, used the
  three synonyms for variety [...] Sometimes the simplest explanation is the
  correct one.

Perhaps.  But an author in English who uses royal, regal, and kingly may be
quite deliberate in his choice of the subtle nuances that synonyms of
French, Latin, and Anglo-Saxon origin convey.  Glik may have had reasons
beyond `variety' in his use of three different Yiddish terms for
pistol/revolver.  Occam's Rule isn't always right in analyzing a text.
