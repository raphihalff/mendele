Subject: Food in song

In reply to Marvin Engel's reminiscence, I can donate the following
transcription of the song as recorded in the 1940s by Sarah Gorby (Melotone
293). In my notes I have the writer/composer as Zaslavsky/Gelbart & Goykhberg
-- but I have no idea how accurate that is or who did what. I also have no
idea how traditional these lyrics were -- Gorby was not above changing lyrics
to suit her purposes.

        DRAY YINGELEKH 

di mame hot dray yingelekh,
dray yingelekh gehat.
mit beyde royte bekelekh,
di tsarte [?].
hot eyns geheysn berele,
dos tsveyte khayim shmerele,
dos drite hot geheysn 
'men zol im koyfn shikh'.

ikh hob aykh opgenart,
ikh hob gevust ir vart,
dos drite kleyne yingele,
dos drite, dos bin ikh, bin ikh.
dos drite kleyne yingele,
dos drite, dos bin ikh, bin ikh.

di mame hot dray niselekh,
fun dem yarid gebrakht.
dray gute fete niselekh,
dray niselekh, a trakht.

iz eyns geven far berele,
un eyns far khayim shmerele,
un gor dos beste nisele,
hot zi gelozt far zikh.

ir vundert zikh a bisl
far vos nit mir a nisl,
vayl nisl, nisl, nisele,
dos drite, dos bin ikh, bin ikh.
vayl nisl, nisl, nisele,
dos drite, dos bin ikh, bin ikh.

di mame hot aheymgebrakht
tsvey niselekh [...] mikh,
tsvey nislekh far di briderlekh,
un mir tsvey naye shikh.

Subject: Food in Song

I can't resist mentioning an Argentine Yiddish tango sent to me on a tape
by Abraham Lichtenbaum of Buenos Aires, called "Mano a Mano" in Spanish
and "My Love" in English, by Max Perelman, who according to Abraham 
was a famous Jewish actor who wrote a lot of parodies of popular tangos.
This is the only song I know that mentions both papas fritas and mameliges. 
My transcription is awful as I don't speak Yiddish and am far from fluent in
Spanish, but here's how I hear the last stanza:

Ir gelibter oter de Rodriguez
Kor metsi mit mameliges
In fartsit ir di pastriges
Shik tsu ir zayn amigos
In farshidn er religyes
In mir platst mayn corazon

Would anyone venture a translation of this into English?

Subject: maydeney-meylekh

The line from The Mendele Review Vol. 01.020:
"vilde mentshn, gehodevet a khoydesh nokhanand mit maydeney-meylekh, un a"

It took me a while to figure this out. Does anyone really *say* 
maydeney-meylekh. I would say; madAny mylekh; ignoring my pronunciation
I've never heard the stress on the first syllable.

Henny Lewin
National Yiddish Book Center

"I understand there has been some discussion in recent months of the need for
on-line ordering of out-of-print Yiddish books.  The answer is ot ot -- the
Yiddish Book Center is hard at work on a comprehensive web site that will not
only place our entire catalog on-line, but also provide the possibility for
direct, on-line ordering.  Eventually the catalog will include entries in the
original Yiddish (Hebrew) alphabet as well as romanization.  And within a
year we hope to be able to provide acid-free reprints on demand of every
title in our collection. So in short, we may have been a bit slow in making
our cyber debut, but we're definitely working on the challenge and intend to
make a real difference to Yiddish readers everywhere once we get there.  In
the meantime, if you're looking for specific Yiddish titles, feel free to  
contact us by e-mail (BIKHER.ORG), or to phone us the old fashioned way at
1-888-4BIKHER."

Subject: Stalin's applied linguistics and Bund

I humbly stand corrected by Iosif Vaisman's scholarly posting "Stalin's
applied linguistics and Bund," having relied on my ever more failable memory
to date Stalin's early work on the National Question.  My main point was that
it had been written long before Stalin's rise to power and the establishment
of the Birobidjan colony.  Iosif is of course correct in pointing out that
Stalin wrote this as part of the ideological struggle by the Bolsheviks
against the Mensheviks and the Bund, a context which has to be kept in mind in
interpreting its meaning.  I might add one other point, Stalin wrote this
under Lenin's close supervision and the ideas here represent Lenin's thinking
at the time--with Stalin acting more as amanuensis than as theoretician.
