Sten Vikner asks about:

>  1  Zet  der yid plutsling den shokhn    kumen (?)
>     Sees the man suddenly  the neighbour come
>
>  2  Lozt der yid plutsling den tsigar faln (?)
>     Lets the man suddenly  the cigar  fall
>
>  3  Vet der tsigar plutsling faln gelozn (?)
>     Is  the cigar suddenly   fall let

3 sounds weird to me, but 1 and 2 are quite normal for me.
Of course, my Yiddish is not native and may have been
corrupted in this respect by English.  But my wife, who
grew up in Toronto with Yiddish as her mother tongue, uses
the same constructs.

I'm assuming what's at issue here is the use of the
infinitive. Of course, to begin the sentence with a verb
presumes that it's being used in narrative, taking on the
sense of "Therefore" or "And the next thing to happen
was...".  Or is the use of plutsling here supposed to have
an effect?

What is the etymology of the personal name "Anschel"?  I
can't find it in any of my name books.

Subject: In Defense of Schlock

Maybe I'm warped by having grown up playing Allan Sherman
(no relation) records at home.  I'm sure Noyekh would put
Allan Sherman in the same category, though he used
virtually no Yiddish.  (If he had, I wouldn't have
understood it as a kid, and presumably never would have
gotten corrupted.:-)

I happen to like the Rechnitzer Rejects and Country Yossi
and the Shteeblehoppers, not to mention Schlock Rock. So do
my kids.  Some of it is very witty.  Agreed, it's mostly
takeoffs on popular songs; why is that so awful? Not all of
it is comic; many of the lyrics are serious and/or
thought-provoking.

Pardon me for not being cultured enough.  (If it's any
consolation, we also have several dozen tapes & records of
"real" Yiddish music, and we listen to those too.)  But
remember that MENDELE owes its genesis to this kind of
schlock: it was in reaction to the junk I was including in
mail.yiddish that Noyekh first proposed setting up an
alternate, "high-kless", mailing list.  I'm thankful he
did; aside from the great discussions we have, it's allowed
me to let mail.yiddish more-or-less lapse without feeling
bad.

Noyekh wonders whether Yiddish schlock is unusual in
copying so much from the surrounding culture.  Is that any
different from the language itself, as actually spoken in
Toronto, or Boro Park, or Skokie?  (As distinguished from
YIVO Yiddish.) One reason I get a kick out of Country Yossi
is that it's drawn from the same songs I listen to quite
regularly on AM radio, yet is converted to Yiddishkeit (in
the religious & cultural sense) and Yiddish, because that's
the natural environment of the singer.

To me, listening to Country Yossi sing "Me darf visn ven
tsu koyfn / visn ven tsu loyfn" is certainly no worse than
listening to Kenny Rogers sing "You gotta know when to hold
up / know when to fold up", and is a lot more fun because
(a) it's culturally closer to me, and (b) it's Yiddish, and
anything in Yiddish is appealing.  If this were the ONLY
Yiddish I heard or used, then maybe Noyekh and Ellen would
have a point.  But I'm in a home that (as least as far as
the kids go) lives in Yiddish. Sure, we listen to "real"
Yiddish songs as well -- lots of them. And we even read
stories in Yiddish, when we work up the energy. But why is
Yiddish schlock so bad?  Or will you also despise me for
listening to 60's and 70's "pop" stuff (they call it
"oldies" now; I guess I'm getting old) on AM radio?

Subject: RE: Yiddish films

I recently discovered that Toronto's Board of Jewish
Education runs something called the Toronto Jewish Media
Centre, which is a resource centre chock-full of films,
videotapes and audio tapes. They have quite a respectable
collection of Yiddish movies on VHS videotape (about 30 or
40).  For a modest ($18) annual membership, anyone can
borrow tapes for a two-week lending period.

Since I discovered the Media Centre, I've been borrowing
handfuls of Yiddish videos and we've watched a good number
of them with our kids.  Yidl mitn Fidl; A Brivele der
Mamen; Tevye der Milchiker (this one we watched without the
kids -- boy was it different from FotR!); Mamele; and
others. All of them are subtitled, but the subtitling
quality varies (white subtitles on a white background are
often unreadable). The sound and picture quality vary, but
are generally intelligible.

Would anyone care to comment on the four films I mentioned
above? I'm interested in other people's reviews of them.
(Maybe I'll discover that Yidl mitn Fidl is actually junk
and schlock, which is why I like it.  Please enlighten me.)

One thing I find unfortunate is that the credits list the
actors but don't say who was who.  In Mamele, for example,
I know Molly Picon was Mamele, but I don't know who the
others were.  Who played her father?  Who played the fellow
she was in love with?  Are there complete lists anywhere?
