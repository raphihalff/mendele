Subject: Introduction to us and Birobidzhan

Hello! We are Lori Padzensky and Joffre Champagne (soon to be Joffre and
Lori Champagne), the co-directors of Project Hashivanu. Our organization
was established two years ago during a visit to Birobidzhan, capital of
Russia's Jewish Autonomous Region. We lived in Birobidzhan for four
months, against the recommendations of many Jewish leaders in America and
Israel who said there were no Jews left there. We found a population of
10,000 Jews in a city of 100,000 people. It has been a joy to watch this
community grow from being "Jewish" because it was stamped in their
passports to being "Jewish" because they embrace the traditions and
beliefs.

Although Yiddish is still the official language of the region, and a
daily Yiddish-Russian newspaper exists, less than half of the people
actually speak Yiddish, though it is seeing a revival and is offered to
any students who wish to learn, whether they are Jewish or not. Some
store, as well as street signs still exist in Yiddish, and a Yiddish
theatre in the city continues to perform.

An offshoot of Project Hashivanu is Operation to Reunify Yiddish,
directed by Michael Ben-Levi in Los Angeles. He is working to
"de-Sovietize" the Yiddish used and taught in Birobidzhan and throughout
the former Soviet Union. Many of the Hebrew words have been taken out and
sofim are not used. This applies to text in the Birobidzhaner Shtern,
their newspaper, as well as in the textbooks they create to teach Yiddish
to the young.

We could go on and on about our project, the work we have done, the rabbi
we have sent, etc., but for now, we will stay brief.

Subject: Mendele as A Big Tent

As an employee of Yivo -- and as one whose Yiddish was acquired in large
measure thanks to "College Yiddish" and the Uriel Weinreich Summer
Yiddish Program (in addition to the tutoring of my grandfather, Reverend
Samuel A. Baker) -- I ought to line up on the side of the "purists" among
our Mendelnikes, with respect to the linguist-libhober debate.  But it is
one of Memdele's great virtues that it is A Big Tent -- we don't all have
to be "tsadikim" to enter into it.  I truly hope that there will be no
schism, and that those who have much to learn, linguistically, will in
turn continue to educate those of us who approach mame-loshn in a more
formal(istic) manner.

Subject: Yiddish software

The recent discussion of word processing software prompts me to put in a
plug for the Word Perfect Hebrew Language Module.  It is especially
suitable for people who already use Word Perfect for DOS as their word
processor in English, since you already know all the commands.

It supports several Hebrew fonts (even Rashi) for laser printers (and
24-pin dot matrix too, I think), including scalable fonts in several
faces using True Type for Word Perfect.  The character set includes all
of the characters needed for Yivo standard spelling, including paskh
tsvey yudn, pe, khirik yud, khubuk vov, and fe and beys with shtriklakh.
The screen display shows the Hebrew characters at VGA resolution, and
full word wrap is provided in the Hebrew right-to-left mode.

All of the rich feature set of standard Word Perfect is available,
including columns, tables, footnotes, macros, fine control of placement,
etc.

The main drawback is limited support of nikud.  And, of course, as a
character-based program, you can't edit in a WYSIWYG display.

I have been using it for several years to do the Yiddish section of the
Yiddish of Greater Washington newsletter.

Cost is about $150.  Available from Kabbalah Software, direct from Word
Perfect, and elsewhere.
