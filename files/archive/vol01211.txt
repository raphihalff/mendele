Subject: YIVO transcription

Let me reinforce the request that was posted earlier this
week (or last week?) for information on the YIVO
transcription system of Yiddish into the Roman alphabet.
Is there a standard place to find out what the system is:
a handbook? an article? Can it just be posted relatively
easily on Mendele?
 
On another matter, I have a very fond memory of Molly Picon
in the Broadway musical "Milk and Honey" some time in the
1960s - playing a middle aged American lady (and I use lady
advisedly) on a group trip to Israel.  What I remember best
was her incredible energy!

Subject: Another Jewish hero dies, Sammy Reshevsky

In addition to the sad death of Molly Picon [can you
imagine, she entertained at my bar mitzva celebration!],
there is also the death on the same day of 81 year old
Samuel Rashevsky, the child prodigy chess player of 75
years ago who astounded the world with his brilliant
playing.  He toured Europe from his home in Poland,
eventually landing in the States where he finally settled.
His continuous and reiterating rivalry with Reuben Fine -
another Jewish chess master - was a noteworthy feature of
my childhood.  Which would be first this year?  Fine,
finishing a doctorate in clinical psychology, finally left
the field to Rashevsky who continued to compete until close
to the end.

BTW, Vergalis, Yiddishist that he may be, was a front for
Stalin, Kruschev, Breznev and the others, accepted by Beria
and who not.  Yiddish is important but the survival of Jews
in the late unlamented USSR was not less important.  I feel
uncomfortable offering this unrepentant tool of the
Comintern a voice in our net.

Subject: More on Molly Picon

My friend, Jerry Phillips of Penn State, has allowed me to
forward this to Mendele:

Molly Picon, however Yiddish she may have been, was a jewel
in the crown of American comedy.  Her role in CAR 54, WHERE
ARE YOU? is regarded as the ultimate of American situation
comedy. The fact that she portrayed a Yiddishe mamele was
irrelevant. The fact that she could polarize and sustain a
comedic mood for a full half hour on her personality alone,
mainly by using "oif a pribichik" as adhesive to the
development of humor, and furthermore, put that humor in a
political backdrop, is still regarded as a goal for any
comedian of any gender and any ethnic group.

As boy, I saw Molly Picon entertain at the old Manhattan
Theater in Cleveland. I did not understand her universal
appeal. As an adult and a modest specialist in comedy
(having performed rather unsuccessfully myself), I came to
understand the marvelous blend of sadness and hilarity she
was able to sustain.

Subject: Mendele Vol 1.209

For those with young children, I highly recommend
purchasing the videos Yidl Mitn Fidl and Mamele from Ergo
Media -- available through the Workman's circle I believe.
My zunele of two years old has been watching them both
quite regularly for the past sixth months.  His is the
first generation that can enjoy Yiddish movies on video,
and he certainly does.

Both films are big favorites of his, but especially Yidl
Mitn Fidl. He quite often adamantly cries out "Fidl?
Fidl?!" -- this is his request to see that video.  'Fidl'
is his name for the movie Yidl Mitn Fidl and also for Molly
Picon herself, whether in the film Mamele or Yidl Mitn
Fidl.  Whenever he sees her, he delightfully cries out
"Fidl!".  He loves to hear her sing, and he dances to the
music in the Khasene scene.  It thrills him when the people
"varf gelt arop" from the windows onto the street for Yidl
and her fellow Klezmorim.  He gets excited when the
klezmorim ride into town on their horse-drawn wagons for
the khasene, and when they run away on foot with the Kale.
He gets pouty when Molly cries in one of her sad scenes,
like at the end when she's reduced to tears by people
laughing at her explaining her woes.

I was sad yesterday to show him Molly's picture in the
NYTimes Obituaries.  In fact, it's a picture of her in the
role of Yidl.  I asked him who that was, and he answered
"Fidl!".  Other than seeming a little less upbeat than
usual about seeing her face, I don't think he understood
when I told him, sadly, "zi's avek af ebik".
