Subject: ICOR

Yes, YIVO has information on ICOR. I've collected some of it. I also went
to Birobidzhan in 1993 to find my cousins who had gone to live in ICOR in
the 1930's. I have interviews with two people who lived there as adults,
information from the museum in Birobidzhan and I even went to where ICOR
once was. I would love to discuss ICOR with anyone interested. I had
hoped to write the great ICORisher screen play by now, but alas...

I came across advice from Daniel Soyer about finding ICOR info but as yet
I haven't had time to find more in my stack of Mendele e-mail.The Magnes
Museum in Berkeley has an exhibit on Birobidzhan about to go on the road
soon.

Subject: Yiddish classes

Morrie Feller writes that "synagogues and Jewish community centers have
to be convinced that Yiddish should be part of their curriculums".

In my experience, the appropriate target market is not the administative
officers, but parents and children.

I approached the principal of the omly Jewish Day School in town about
teaching Yiddish as an elective subject to children 9-13 yrs of age (I
also opened it to their parents). The school has 400 students and only
goes through 10th grade, and they don't learn alephbeth till age 9.
Because the school's orientation is heavily secular and the principal is
Israeli, I was suprised at how supportive she was. Unfortunately, no one
signed up! The Principal attributed this to the soccer season, and
encouraged me to try again in January.

Below is the verbiage I included in the flyer. The major selling points
are: personal connection, heritage, easy to learn, entertaining and
multi-media learning. These did not work. Any suggestions?


Yiddish Language/
 Ashkenazi Culture and History

If you are like most Jews in America, your parents, grandparents, or
ancestors came from Europe. In this course, students will learn about the
world of those ancestors. We will study the language they spoke, Yiddish,
the Ashkenazi culture they created, and their history.

Language
Students will learn to read, write, and speak Yiddish. They will build on
their ability to read the Hebrew aleph-beth, and their knowledge of
English to discover that they already know a lot of Yiddish. We will use
readers, flash cards, conversion tricks, stories, and songs in a
multi-media approach to Yiddish. They will learn lots of proverbs, and
colorful expressions.

Culture
Music will be used to give the student a sense of Yiddish culture. We
will learn lots of Yiddish songs that their great-great-grandparents
might have sung, as well as some new renditions that have made the
rock-charts in parts of the country. Because the songs so accurately
reflected the cultural institutions, and the concerns of everyday life,
they will be useful in giving the student a sense of how it felt to live
there. We will also watch segments of some Yiddish film classics to
provide visual reinforcement for discussions of the major influences on
Ashkenazi culture.

History
Ashkenazi history unfolded over a thousand years and as many miles.
Students will learn how it all got started, and the major events that
shaped us. We will use maps to locate cities that their ancestors lived
in, and we will discuss how they probably came to settle there.

Subject: Yiddish for all Jews?

Ellen Prince has suggested (Mendele 5.152) that if all Jewish children
should be taught Yiddish, they should also be taught Ladino and
Judeo-Italian and Judeo-Persian and ...others.  I would hope that the
smile at the end of that sentence means that she is being a little
facetious.  There is no way that any of the other Judeo languages can
compare with Yiddish in terms of geographical distribution, wealth of
literature, and importance in Jewish history.

I would not say that other Judeo languages are not of interest.  In 1981
I was an original subscriber to the premier issue of the "Jewish Language
Review".  This was edited by David L. Gold and Leonard Prager, and it
came out of the University of Haifa.  On the cover, in Hebrew font, were
listed the following languages:  Yiddish, Modern Karaitic, Modern Ebri,
Modern Morrocan Yahudic, New Aramic, Talmudic Aramic, Modern Bukharic,
Hebrew, Biblical Aramic and Modern Judezmo.  I continued to subscribe to
this journal until it apparently ceased p[ublication in 1987.
Subsequently, in 1989, "Jewish Linguistic Studies" by David L. Gold was
published by the Association for the Study of Jewish Languages which I
again supported.  I think it is definitely worth while for all Jews to be
aware of the various Judeo languages and their place in Jewish history.
An important, and extensive, paper relative to this subject is by Paul
Wexler (Tel Aviv University) in Language, Vol.57, Number1 (1981),
pp.99-149. It is entitled: "Jewish Interlinguistics: Facts and Conceptual
Framework". I would like to quote from the summary at the head of the
paper: "Since the 6th century B.C., Jews have created unique variants of
many coterritorial non-Jewish languages with which they came in contact;
Aramaic, Greek, Arabic, Spanish, Persian, and German are just a few
examples. Widespread shifts to non-Jewish languages throughout the world
and to revived Hebrew in Israel are now resulting in the obsolescence of
contemporary Jewish languages and putting an end to 2600 years of Jewish
language creation."

Let's hope that we can reverse this trend with respect to Yiddish!
