Subject: Yiddish in the hospital

My stay in the hospital is, thank G-d, over.  I am coming along well and
I thank all the Mendelayners for their kind wishes. The following
experience in Kaiser Permanente Hospital, Santa Clara, CA may be of some
interest; i.e., Yiddish to help heal.

After a few days and I was permitted to walk the corridors, I saw a
young and very beautiful woman standing by one of the patient rooms and
she was crying.  So I went to her and asked what was causing her such
grief.  She told me that her mother, a  76 year old lady named Mrs.
Cohen, had just been admitted to the hospital with great difficulty in
breathing and she was afraid for her.

We spoke for perhaps half an hour and I got some background on Mrs.
Cohen including the fact that she spoke excellent Yiddish but rarely had
occasion to do so what with living in Milpetas, CA.  The daughter went
home and waited until around 9:30 pm before going to see Mrs. Cohen.

She was in awful shape, barely breathing, using a steam machine, and
having a tough time of it.  I pulled up a seat and began to speak to her
in Yiddish.  I asked her where she was born and what her mother's name
was and what it was like growing up, etc., etc.,  Very calm.  Nothing
too personal.  Within 5 minutes of speaking to her and her responding,
her breathing began to become much more normal.

We continued.  She told me of her husband from whom she was now
divorced, how she had lost track of her many brothers and sisters
because her mother had deserted the entire family when she was a child
because the father beat her constantly.  It was getting a little too
personal now but she seemed willing to speak of her life and it was
definitely calming her.

Within 10 minutes, she was speaking and breathing normally.  She enjoyed
talking to me and she spoke a rich and fluid Yiddish.

30 minutes later the specialist in respiration came in and found us in
deep conversation.  He wanted to know how come Mrs. Cohen had suddenly
become very normal in her breathing.

It was a wonderful event.  After a while I stopped talking and just
listened.  She told me how to make cholent.  I knew already but if the
topic interested her that was OK with me.

I shall go to see her over the next few days to assure her Yiddish RX.

Yiddish hath charms to soothe the savage respiratory tract!!

Subject: Shyster

According to Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary [1976], shyster
probably stems from an American attorney named Scheuster who was
"frequently rebuked in a New York court for pettifoggery."  The American
Heritage Dictionary of the English Language [1970] says the term is
"[P]ossibly after Scheuster, an unscrupulous 19th-century New York
lawyer." The Concise Oxford Dictionary [1952] modestly forbears to cite
any derivation of the word. Thanks to Geralyn Flood for sending some of
us to our dictionaries. I had thought the term came from an impolite
German word for coprous material.

Subject: Al tiro avdi yakov

Bernard S. Greenberg asked about the macaronic song "Al tiro avdi
Yaakov," in particular about the mysterious line "Otsokh niere tsugi
zogt" (6.017, 6.028).  His text seems to be a slightly corrupted version
of one published by Menakhem Kipnis (_80 folkslider..._, p. 158).  The
Kipnis version (Hebrew/Yiddish/Russian-- no Ukrainian), which is the
beginning of an alphabetic acrostic, is as follows:

	Omar adonoy leyakov.
	Yo, tate, yo!
	Host dokh mir tsugezogt:
	Al tiro avdi yakov.
	Nye boyus nikovo!		[I fear no-one!]
	Nye vyeru nikomu		[I believe no-one
	tolko bohu odnomu.		  but God alone]

	Bokhar adonoy beyakov.
	Yo, tate, yo!
		etc.

	Goal adonoy es yakov.
	Yo, tate, yo!
		etc.

Another variant, contributed by the grandfather of our Mendele colleague
Andrew Cassel, and published in the Ginzburg- Marek collection (#19), is
more clearly a dialogue between Jacob and God.  Two other variants were
published by Prilutski in his _Yidishe folkslider_ (1:48-50).  In a
footnote he points out that "al tiro avdi yakov" is "a very popular
motif in Yiddish folk poetry."  He mentions a version consisting of ten
eight-line stanzas published in Warsaw in 1900 by a badkhen, Yisroel-
Yitskhok Tsifershteyn, but unfortunately doesn't include it since he is
not sure whether it is a folk song or was composed by the badkhen.

Subject: Al Tire Avdi Yaakov

I might guess that the first few words are Ukrainian/Russian and the
last two Yiddish. The tsugi might be sugie, a topic of discussion which
would fit in a context like:

Yes, my little father [young man]
What do you have to say about this--
"Al tiro avdi Yaakov"?
I fear not ...

Look for more clues in the (White?-) Russian song "Nyet Nyet Nyikavo".
This is a Lubavitcher nigun, but a man in the Worcester Mass Jewish Home
for the Aged told me he remembers the melody from his Red Army days!
