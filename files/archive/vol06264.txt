Subject: Tsholnt

Robert Shapiro [6.263] suggests the origin of cholent as possibly
being French. He may very well be right.  I would not know.  But I
heard that the origin was German; i.e., "shul ende" which leads
quickly to cholent.

There is also an argument that Boston baked beans are a variant of
cholent made by New England whaling men whose boats stopped at Russian
ports and who ate real cholent while on land.  Then on board, they
tried to duplicate the delicious flavor but had only beans, fatback,
and molasses.

Who knows?

Subject: Klezmorim in literature

Redoubtable klezmer scholar Henik Sapoznik [6.263] inquires about the
publishing date of Sholem Aleichem's _Afn fidl_, which he describes as
a serial novella.  I always took the date given in the Folksfond
edition at face value:  geshribn in yor 1902.  That doesn't tell when
it was published, but I would bet it wasn't languishing on his desk
too long before it saw the light of day,  particularly if it was
serialized.  (Why, after all, would a professional writer continue
generating episodes to a serial not being published?)  I am not a
little surprised, however, to learn that it was in fact published
serially, because it certainly reads as a seamless short story.  Could
Henik be thinking, rather, of the author's brief treatment of some of
the same material in his serial memoir _Fun'm yarid_, notably in the
chapter _Tsvishn khazonim un klezmorim_?  An extensive (and
fascinating) textual history of that work can be found in David G.
Roskies, "Unfinished Business:  Sholem Aleichem's _From the Fair_," in
_Prooftexts_ 6, No. 1 (January 1986):  65-78.  See especially footnote
5 (pp. 76-7).

I must mention another klezmer-depiction source I just stumbled upon
on the Library of Congress web site, to which we were recently
directed by our own shames, Reb Noyekh [6.234].  From there, the
typescript of Yosef Tsherniavsky's _Moyshe der fidler_ (1919) can be
downloaded in facsimile, and one can clearly see that the handwritten
title was an afterthought, the typewritten one having been crossed
out.  Noyekh and Henik can look for themselves:  it was originally
called _A shames un a klezmer_.

But now a question for Henik.  Which Odessa stories of Isaac Babel
depict klezmorim?  I can only recall "The Awakening," about violin
lessons for would-be concert-hall prodigies; but I would be very
interested in his treatment of klezmorim.

Subject: Klezmorim in literature

In response to Henry Sapoznik's question: There's a wonderful, funny,
lyric-grotesque (i.e., not literal) description of klezmorim in M.
Kulbak's Moshiekh ben Efrayim (see mendelyanier Joachim N.'s
translation). Perets's Gilgul fun a nign describes describes a klez
moment (the tune Perets follows through various musical and
socio-economic permutations is played at one point by a klezmer), but
I don't recall if the musicians are described. There's also a
description of an ad hoc town band in Linetski's Polylishe yingl
(leading up to the wedding scene), but Linetski's point is the
rudeness and crudeness of the music and the musicians, so his
description is distorted beyond ethnographic value without a large
shake of salt.

Subject: Publication date of Afn Fidl

Henik Sapoznik asks (6.263) about the publication date of Afn
Fidl by Sholem Aleichem.  According to Dos Sholem-Aleykhem Bukh page
364, it was first published in the monthly _Der Yidisher Familie_ in
1902.  Since the data was compiled by his son-in-law, it's probably
accurate.

During that year Sholem Aleichem was quite productive contributing as
well to _Der Yid_ and _Der Folkstsaytung_.

Subject: "The Star-spangled Banner" oyf yidish

[see 6.263]

It looks like "The Star-spangled Banner" in Yiddish was published in
Adolph Mann's "Songs for my people" (Lake Elsinore, Calif.: A. Mann,
1948. 52 p.) There are copies in the NY Public Library and Gratz
College Library.

The song is also printed in "Oneg Shabbat: the new Jewish community
songster" (New York: Transcontinental Music Corp., 1942. 17 p.), but
from the bibliographic record it is not clear in what language.

Subject: "Sold to Shame"

I am looking for information on a Yiddish play "Sold to Shame" written
by Dr. Waltzman & Jacob Silbert. Do you have any suggestions on how to
proceed?

Subject: Fis oyf di pleytses

Mendy Fliegler writes (6.261) that "men shtelt di fis oyf di playtses'
means "you can't get there from here," and indicates an impossibility.
Es heybt zikh nisht on!  Firstly, the correct form of the expression
is "nemen di fis oyf di pleytses" and the meaning is to suggest going
somewhere or doing something with great energy and verve, doing it
speedily. It does not have the sense of an impossibility. "Vi kumt di
katz ibern vaser" means "how do you get from point A to point B?  In
other words, how does one overcome obstacles in accomplishing
something that one wants to accomplish?  Humbly,

Subject: Shmir zikh oys di shikh

Kh'hob gehat a tante vos fleg entfern, "Shmir zikh oys di shikh," ven
mir flegn ir opdanken (far ire gute maykholim un vunderlekhe mayselekh)
un ir vintshn a gute nakht (azoy vi di mame hot undz gelernt).

Kindvays, hob ikh ir oysdruk oysgetaytsht als, "get outa here, burn
shoe leather, start walking" -  to indicate that a thank you was
unnecessary. (In normal families, they said, "Nishto far vos.")

My Vinkl members think it must have a different meaning, and that if
it meant what I describe, she would have said, "Shmir zikh oys di
padeshves."

Does the expression live in anyone's memory?

How else would you say, "You're welcome."
