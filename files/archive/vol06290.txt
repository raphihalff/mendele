Subject: Ashkenaz

[see 6.285 and later comments]

Zachary M. Baker suggested on this issue in Mendele 6.288 that:

     perhaps knowledge of the coterritorial languages of the countries
     and regions where Ashkenazic Jews have resided over the centuries
     should also be a prerequisite for a scholarly research on topics
     subsumed under "Ashkenaz."

While I'm hardly a professional in this area, I have to concur with
khaver Baker's suggestion.  As a Slavic linguist, I can't imagine how
it's possible to deal with Yiddish etymology without at least a
passing acquaintance with Polish and either Russian or Ukrainian, not
to mention some of the other local languages of central and eastern
Europe (depending on the specific area of study).

Subject: Stempeniu in English

In regard to English and other translations of Stempeniu, I would like
to add some information to what has already been posted in Mendele.
There is an excellent Russian version that is true to the original in
both tone and detail (I found it years ago in the Columbia University
stacks, but unfortunately I can't recall the name of the wonderful
translator. The German version by Samuel Meisels, which Hugh Denman
finds inaccurate, is altogether clumsy and silly:  the translator
renders the dialogue into the most disgusting and supercilious
yiddling imaginable--thereby managing to insult two of the major
languages and literatures in Europe:  German and Yiddish.

My own translation, which renders the klezmer slang into slightly
delapidated rock 'n roll lingo, is still available in my collection
"The Shtetl" which is still in print.

Readers might also be interested  in Robert Rothstein's very
informative and analytical paper on the Klezmer slang in _Stempeniu_.

Subject: Yiddish books translated into Finnish

A Finnish correspondent of mine is interested in reading Finnish
translations of Yiddish books (novels, poetry), does anybody know some
good references about it (or where I could find some)?

A sheynem dank in advance,

Subject: Tsvey kashes

These past sedorim I had the occasion to locate and use my late
father's 1923 Hebrew Publishing edition of the Hagada with it's
charming illustrations by the Jewish artist Lola. Over the years I
have seen many of his drawing in the pages of Yiddish newspapers and
magazines (like "Groyser Kundes") and on posters for Yiddish theater
productions. Does anyone know anything about him? I was also wondering
if anyone knew where I could obtain a copy of Shike Driz's poem "Dem
Zeydn's Nign".

Subject: Feldafing

With reference to Goldie Morgentaler's query concerning Feldafing
[6.289:7], no less an authority than the motoring atlas in the
glove-compartment of my car tells me that it is situated on the
western shore of the Starnberger See. That's the one in which Ludwig
II of Bavaria drowned himself, you remember.

Subject: Yiddish chad gadya

A version of "Shikt der har" is included on the record "Chad Gadya
[One Kid] issued by Folkways in 1982. The record includes 25 versions
of Chad Gadya in Aramaic, German, Yiddish, Greek, Lad{no,
Judeo-Provencal, Italian, Arabic, Russian, Kurdistan [sic], and Yemen
[sic]. Its a great record. Unfortuantely I have it on LP and no longer
have the equipment to play it.
