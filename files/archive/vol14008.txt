Subject: Yiddish in Transcription

Lynda Cohen [Mendele 14.004] asked for transliterated
yiddish material.  The
International Association of Yiddish Clubs (IAYC) has mailed
its 80 member
clubs 2 such books published by the organization:  _simkhe_
by Troim Katz
Handler; and _mayn shtetele bronzvil_ by Sylvia Schildt. Its
next mailing
will be 5 stories from Onkelos.  Miriam Hoffman's _in IN der
velt fun
baley-khay_ (In the World of Living Creatures) will be
published in Der Bay
(fishl@derbay.org) in 3 upcoming issues. If your club is
interested in IAYC,
write to Seymour Graiver at symour.graiver@worldnet.att.net.

Subject: Abraham Goldfaden translations

Many of the works of Abraham Goldfaden were translated to
Hebrew,  some of
them more than once. Shulamit was translated to Hebrew,
inter alia, by
Yacov Lerner in Warsaw 1921, and by Yigal Mosinson in the
1950s in Israel.
See  also Abraham Goldfaden, Shirim u-Mahazot, hehedir
Reuven Goldberg,
Jerusalem  1970 217 p.

Subject: Re: zhaleven

In discussing the meaning of _zhaleven_ references have been
made [Mendele
14.007] to two Slavic verbs: Polish _ZaLowaC_ and Russian
_zhalovac'_ with
the implication that both might have had an equal impact on
the Yiddish
loanword. It should be pointed out, however, that these
languages influenced
Yiddish very differently, Polish having been the first
Slavic language to
affect it, whereas its contact with Russian began only in
the late 18th
century after a large part of Poland was annexed to the
tsarist empire. The
verb _zhaleven_ is clearly a borrowing from Polish retaining
the meaning _to
stint_ and has nothing to do with Russian _zhalovac'_
meaning _to grant_.

Incidentally, the impact of Ukrainian and Belarusian on
Yiddish, though
noticeably weaker than that of Polish and geographically
restricted, was
deeper and stronger than that of Russian. Care should
therefore betaken not
to overestimate the Russian influence on Yiddish, which is
limited to
vocabulary items mostly referring to the sphere of officialdom.

Subject: Help with translation

I have been trying to figure this out and have asked many
Yiddish speaking
friends, but to no avail. Would appreciate  help.  It is a
description of
the ceiling in an old shul in a shtetl.  Der sofit
adurchgeflokhtn mit dike
fir-knotike bolkes [Mod: baliekes?].

A shaynem dank,

Subject: shier nisht

I would like to post a question about the expression "shier
nisht".
Not the Hebrew "shiur" meaning lesson; not the same Hebrew
word in
the expression "ohn a shiur" meaning without an end; but the
expression
"shier nisht" meaning "all but...". My question: is this a
Hebrew or a
German root? I can find many instances of the expression
"schier nicht"
used with its regular meaning in German writing on the
internet; but the
expression does not appear in my Pocket Langenscheidt's.
Have the Germans
borrowed it from us? If not, I find it a little odd that
Weinreich spells
it with the extra ayin (but not of course the vav of
"shiur"), as a two-
syllable word. Is this how it would really be spoken?

Do we have the meyvinim on board who can clarify this
etymological question?

Subject: zhargon

Does anyone know when 'zhargon' came to be applied to
Yiddish.  My hunch is
that it's post-haskole but I'll be just as happy to have
that proved wrong.
