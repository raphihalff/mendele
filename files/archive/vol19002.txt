Subject: oyberland, unterland

With reference to Fraynd Mett's query concerning the significance of the 
terms "oyberland" and "unterland" in terms of Hungarian regional geography 
[19.001:6], he should see Uriel Weinreich, "Western Traits in 
Transcarpathian Yiddish" in "For Max Weinreich on His Seventieth Birthday: 
Studies in Jewish Languages, Literature, and Society," The Hague, 1964, 
245-64, where there is a map clarifying just this point on p. 246. Very 
approximately, "oyberland" corresponds with Slovakia and "unterland" with 
Transylvania, Maramures and the Transcarpatian Ukraine. Of course, we are 
dealing here with Hungary as it existed before the First World War. Very 
little of the relevant territory lies within the current Hungarian 
frontier. I might add that the territory labeled oyberland in Weinreich's 
map coincides fairly exactly with what is still referred to as the 
Felvidek (acute on 2nd e) in not particularly politically-correct 
Hungarian oral usage even today.

In response to Perets Mett's inquiry, here's what I found on Wikipedia 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oberlander_Jews):

Oberlander Jews (also Oberlandish or simply Oberland Jews) are Ashkenazi, 
Yiddish- and German-speaking Jews originating in the Oberland or higher 
land western region of Hungary and the district surrounding Bratislava in 
Slovakia. This is as opposed to Unterlander Jews, who resided in the 
eastern lower lands on the opposite side of the Danube River and were 
influenced more by the Hasidic movement.

Subject: song lyrics sought

Thank you to all who helped with both songs [Mendele 19.001].  You have 
made two survivors very happy!
I have another song fragment for which I am seeking the full text. Here is 
the
transliterated fragment:

"Eyle toldoys noekh,
  fun bronfn hot men koyekh"

Many thanks,

Joseph Toltz

Subject: Turek Peace Movement

I am translating a letter from Vilna 1940 that references a pre-war "Turek 
Peace Movement" in Novi Dvor and a possible meeting with a Doctor 
Tartakover in the United States, in an attempt to get a visa out of Vilna. 
Any information to help put this in context would be appreciated.
