Subject: Introduction

My name is Dan Leeson and I live in northern California.  It has
been years and years since I spoke Yiddish and I am afraid that I
have forgotten much of it.  Like most children, I lived in a
bilingual Yiddish/English household but when my grandparents died,
little need for bilinguality existed.  Years later in Paris, while
shopping for a challah on the Rue de Rosiers, I began speaking
Yiddish to the shopkeeper and she laughed, saying "You speak Yiddish
like a child" which was true because I had not spoken it since the
time I was a child.

I miss mamaloschen.  It is comfortable like an old shoe.  And,
heartbreakingly, I never learned to read or write Yiddish so I
cannot console myself with Peretz or Sforim or even Gimpel the fool.

I am a retired businessman who plays clarinet with the San Jose
Symphony orchestra and does historical research.

Subject: Jewish diseases, Khazars

	Although having them certainly can not be interpreted as
evidence that one is Jewish there are a large number of diseases,
especially neurodegenerative diseases, that occur so much more
frequently in Ashkenazim than in the general community that
neurologists and medical geneticists typically ask patients if they
are Ashkenazi as part of the screening history.  I believe Bill
Kavesh once wrote an article detailing what was known of these
conditions in The Jewish Almanac.  I donUt have his article handy
but I suppose I could ask him to verify the reference if anyone is
interested.

	Regarding genetics and the Khazars...I once had an
interesting brush with the genealogy of disease.  About 20 years
ago, my grandmother developed a rare type of cancer of the eye. I
was a medical student at the time and was running to the library
when anyone I knew became ill so that I could sound like I knew
something about something.  I learned that this type of tumor had
been reported in Mongolians, Siberian natives, and occasionally in
certain Native Americans (presumably from the trans-Aleutian
migration).  Ultimately she lost her eye and finally succumbed to
the disease, but not before mentioning that a similar condition had
occurred in her father at about the same age.  Only when I took a
close look at the old photo of him in Russia did I see what she
confirmed, that he, too, had a false eye, apparently from the same
problem.  In his photo he obviously had a mixture of oriental and
European features when one looked closely and my grandmother could
not explain this, except to say that others of the older relatives
in his family had those features.  I have traced his family back to
the early 18th century in Belarus but the coincidence of oriental
features and a tumor only found in individuals from the Russian far
East and Mongolia have always made me wonder whether, in fact, there
were Khazarian genes in the pool.

Sander Gilman:

	Are you the same Sander Gilman that wrote a wonderful volume
called, "Seeing the Insane?"  If so, I have enjoyed reading it
immensely--it's an incredible collection of material.

I wonder what the "tourist" market is for such a book.  Reminds me
of the answer I sometimes give to the interminable questions, "Why
do you speak Yiddish to your kids?" ... it'll be useful if we ever
visit pre-war Poland.  :-)

(I actually have a range of answers to the question, depending on
how offensively it's asked, whether the asker really cares and how
snarky I feel at the moment.  The tamest is, "It's the only way
they'll learn it.")

Subject: Yiddish theater

The discussion re Yiddish theater brings up a memory from 1941 or
so.

It was the year of my parent's silver anniversary and the five
children decided to give a big surprise party.  I was assigned the
task of getting them out of the house while the party preparations
were done.  So I bought them an anniversary 'givt', a matinee
performance at the Yiddish theater on the East side, Manhattan.  We
saw the play "Duvid und Esther".  I remember little about the play,
but the theme song "Duvid und Esther" keeps reverberating through my
mind after more than 50 years.  Does anyone know of the play or the
words of the song?

sholem aleikhem!

I am excited to have joined you all on "mendele" I am a lecturer in
Yiddish at the University of Michigan.  I have my MA from here in
Near Eastern Studies, specializing in modern Hebrew (having focused
on literature and comp. lit. more than language).  I am currently
browsing through PhD options for myself, not yet totally decided on
the specific field...my interests being both in literature and
language education.  I'm not quite sure what else to tell you about
myself in this e-mail intro. format...so if anyone would like to
know more, please ask! zayt ir ale gezunt,

Daniella HarPaz
