The following is the YIVO system for transcription, as
presented in Weinreich's "College Yiddish" (ignoring the
use of brackets to enclose the transcription, and the use
of capitals), where it is used to explain the sounds of
Yiddish to the American student. I add additional Yiddish
examples after **  at my own risk.

b,d,g: ** Yidd. examples: bakn, dank, gey avek ("bake,
thanks, go away")

p,t,k as in Yiddish post, teler, ken ("mail, plate, can")

f,v,s,z as in Eng. "far, very, seem, gaze" **finf, vos,
beser, zingn

when -t or -st is added to a word ending in b,d,g,v,z, the
consonant changes in sound but not spelling:  lebt, redst,
zogst, ...

sh as in Eng. **shadkhen
zh as g in rouge, s in measure  **kum-zhe

h,y as in Eng. "have, yes"  **hob, yor

kh like German ch in "lachen"  **khapn, makh, ikh, gikh,
rekht, khaver

ts: tsu, tsi, alts, zetser
tsh: mentsh, tshepen, petsh

l: two varieties are distinguished, with italics used for
the "softer" one. (but this is not renderable on e-mail):
ful, mol, vs. biLik, Libe.

m, n, ng: mame, **nudnik, yung notice also "syllabic" n
(vowel n): lipn, hobn, shraybn, zokn, zogn

r: rekhn, lerer, shener, merer, firer

VOWELS:

a,e,i,o,u [as in MAMA JET SKI NO GURU]: mame, vaser; beser,
kenen, himl, 

yidish; lomir, nokh; kumen, muzn

(e is thus also used for the shorter, unstressed vowel in
beser, etc.)

ay as in Eng. "fine": tsayt, vayt
ey as in Eng. "vein": veynen, sheyn, meydl
oy: groys

Hope this helps anyone interested.

Subject: transcription

As a new participant, I don't know whether requests for
transcription standards are so frequent that they are
traditionally answered by directly mailing a canned
response to the requestor, or whether the silence to recent
requests is due to everbody holding back in expectation
that somebody will proffer The Official YIVO Standard
Reference.  I don't have the latter (but would appreciate
any bibliographic references), and if the former situation
holds, I invite the moderator to suppress my posting.

The YIVO standard is not a transliteration scheme, but a
system for transcribing Yiddish sounds in the Roman
alphabet: the crucial distinction is that words of
Hebrew/Aramaic extraction are transcribed phonetically,
without reference to their Hebrew/Aramiac/Yiddish spelling.

And yet, the following is also true:

-- The granularity of the transcription is exactly the same
as that of the Yiddish orthography.  For example, no notice
is taken of stress, of syllabicity in /l/ and /n/, of
palatalization in /l/, or of the distinction between yud as
a true consonant and yud as a marker of palatalization.

-- Indeed, if you were to spell the Hebrew and Aramaic
words according to the rules of the phonemic orthography
(as they used to do in Russia), the transcription could be
implemented as a completely automatic element-by-element
transliteration of the standard orthography.

-- The Roman letters chosen to represent the sounds of
Yiddish happen to match up with no particular dialect, but
rather with the pronunciation that the Hebrew letter is
most directly evocative of. Thus 'gut', not 'git', as
suggested by vov; 'groys', not 'greys', as suggested by vov
yud; 'vayn', not 'vaan', since no one would think of using
yudn to represent an /a/ sound.  [This is a moderately
contentious way of looking at things.  One could argue,
*almost* as convincingly, that the sounds are the more
conservative pronunciations, or that the scheme blatantly
favours Vilne.]

So the idea is to write down your Yiddish in the standard
orthography, but treating Semitic elements as if they were
Germanic/Slavic elements that you had to write out
phonemically.  (I'm ignoring the question as to what the
standard orthography is, since it's rather a longer point
to answer.  I hope most people already know it.)  Then
apply the following conversions, ignoring shtumn alef:

a	pasekh-alef
o	komets-alef
b	beys
g	giml
d	dalet
h	hey
u	vov
v	tsvey vovn
oy	vov yud
z	zayen
zh	zayen shin
t	tes
y	yud konsonant (or sign of palatalization)
i	yud vokal
ey	tsvey yudn
ay	pasekh tsvey yudn
kh	khof
l	lamed
m	mem
n	nun
s	samekh
e	ayen
p	pey
f	fey
ts	tsadek
k	kuf
r	reysh
sh	shin


It is understandable that German spelling conventions are
not followed; somewhat more surprising that Eastern
European conventions aren't followed either.  In fact, the
system seems downright Anglic. The only apparent exceptions
are the vowels, but I would claim that European vocalism is
already incorporated as a subscheme in English: note for
example how many people mispronounce "Punjab", because they
can't believe that "u" would be sounded as in "pun" in a
word of foreign origin.  So was this scheme adopted only
after Yivo moved to America?  If so, was the scheme
promulgated for the use of English speakers, or was it
intended from the start to be a system for all users of the
Roman alphabet?

Disclaimer: this is mostly from memory, based largely on
long exposure to the Library of Congress standard (a
slightly elaborated version of the Yivo standard) and books
published by Yivo.  I apologize for any misstatements and
invite corrections.
