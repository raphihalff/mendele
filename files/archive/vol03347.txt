Subject: Ladino/Spanish :: Yiddish/German

Recent comments by Marion and Rick on the mutual perceptions of German
and Yiddish speakers reminds me of an anecdote about Ladino (Judezmo).  I
don't remember the source, though I might be able to dig it up if
anyone's interested.

There was a large Ladino-speaking community in Salonika, Greece, and they
were unaware of the existence of a whole non-Jewish Spanish world.  This
must have been some generations ago.  Apparently there were many Jewish
longshoremen in Salonika.  One time a ship from Spain docked there, and
the word flew out among the Jews of Salonika that there was a whole ship
manned entirely by Jews in town!

First of all, ever or ayver or eyver or oyver, is an organ in Hebrew and
frequently a limb.

Next, there are two [at least] meanings to botel, bateyl, botl, in
Hebrew, one is unemployed, inactive or a wastrel; the other is void, in
legal cases, as a document is batel.

Finally, MASH [my colleague from Weizmann] is quite correct in
identifying the expression as taken from Ethics of the Fathers [Pirke
Avot] where i provides a description of an hundred year old. "A 100 year
old is as if he were dead and _over and batel_ from this world." [5:24]

I thought that his identification would be recognized and accepted but I
overestimated the readers who continue to belabor this point, as well as
heirat and other old stories.

The bet tet lamed word is not always pejorative; its derivative batlan,
unemployed, is used in the Talmudic definition of a city, where 10 such
men are needed to attend a synagogue and by some accounts 120 such to
define a city.  These unemployed men were considered free to study, a
higher occupation than work.

Subject: Oyver botl

With all of the exchanges concerning this very common expression during
the last week or two, I'm surprised that no one (at least not so far as I
recall) has sent in the dictionary spelling and definition:

'ayin-vov-veyz-resh - beyz-tes-lamed Defined by Uriel Weinreich,
adjectivally, as "senile," and as a noun, "dotard."

The Hebrew root 'ayin-bet-resh = to pass (over).  (Yiddish oyver zayn =
to transgress, trespass, violate.) Botl, in Yiddish, among other things,
means "void." Alcalay's Hebrew-English dictionary lists the expression
'over u-batel = senile, good for nothing, in a state of mental decay, non
compos (L[atin]), superannuated.

In standard Yiddish, oyver ('ayin-vov-veyz-resh) has NO connection with
eyver (alef-veyz-resh; "limb [of a body]").

i'm pretty sure this is just Hebrew "over batel" -- /over/ = "he passes",
/baTel/ "non-functioning, cancelled, unemployed".

/ever/ "limb" wouldn't give Yiddish /oy/.

Mikl Herzog asks about "gedemft". My mother used the term "gedemft
flaysh" to mean pot roasted beef.

My mother was a Lodzer.

"gedempt" in my home referred to meat that was cooked in a stew like
manner. The cooked meat [usually brisket or chuck] was called "gedempte
fleisch" and was absolutely delicious - a zoy vee piter in der mol arein!

Can a Slavist provide a Slavic etymon for Yiddish "preglen" along with
whatever Slavic meaning variants occur? Again, thanks in advance.
