Subject: Destruction in Argentina

Since the disaster in Buenos Aires took place, there have been various
reports coming my way about the nature of the explosion and the losses
suffered.  The JTA Daily News Bulletin for July 19, 1994 has a front page
dispatch about the bombing of 633 Pasteur, and reactions (local and
elsewhere) to it.  Here is a very brief excerpt:

"The blast sent ripples of fear throughout the Argentine Jewish community
of 220,000, the largest in South America, which had barely recovered from
the 1992 attack on the [Israeli] embassy. "Observers noted the
similarities between the two attacks, including the apparent use of car
bombs in both incidents and the fact that each building was undergoing
construction work when the blast occurred, with workers freely coming and
going. "This time, the bomb struck one of the community's most important
addresses.  The building housed the DAIA, the umbrella organization of
Argentine Jewry; the AMIA, the community's 100-year-old main social
service agency for the poor and aged; a library of YIVO, the Jewish
Research Institute, where the archives of Jewish life in Argentina are
stored; and the Jewish Community Council, among other organizations."

Research on Nazi war criminals in Argentina was also taking place at 633
Pasteur, with documents supplied by the Argentine government.

One account that I have read contradicts the above description of the
explosion as having been the result of a car bomb.  "Microsemanario,"
edicion urgente for July 19, 1994 states [my translation]:

"First indications are that the explosives were located inside the
building.  Images of the remains of the building and the descriptions
of survivors point in this direction.  AMIA [i.e., the entire building]
was reduced to a mountain of stones on the same spot where it once stood,
in the same way as with buildings that are being demolished with
explosive charges."

Turning to the question of reconstituting the collections of the Buenos
Aires YIVO, a number of individuals and organizations with whom (or
which) I have been in contact have expressed their willingness to offer
books or expertise, in the event that the Argentine YIVO decides to
rebuild and finds a new location. These include the National Yiddish Book
Center (which has pledged 10,000 volumes), the New York YIVO, and others.
I am sure that the international library and research community
(including the Israeli academic establishment) will also be enlisted in
this effort, should it be requested by our Argentine colleagues.  This
will help to redress the void left by this heinous act of destruction.
The archives that were lost, however, are irreplaceable.  I do not
believe that microfilms exist, either.

Meanwhile, though, priority is being given to the excavation of the site
and the recovery of bodies.  Today's New York Times noted that there were
still 70 individuals listed as missing, and many of these may be presumed
dead.

and HASAFRAN (electronic newsletter of the Association of Jewish
Libraries).

Susan Hauser:

Try WEVD 1050 am radio. You might even want to call the station for the
schedule of their Yiddish broadcasts. There is also a musical  program
called Art Raymond's Simcha which is on Mon-Fri from noonish to later in
the afternoon (different schedule each day and hard to keep up with).
Also on Sunday from 8am to noonish.

Also there is Jewish, Hebrew, Israeli music Mon-Fri 91.1 FM WFMU Nachem
Segal with news and commentary etc. and again Nachem Segal on 1430 AM
from 5pm to 7pm Mon-Thurs.

Hope this keeps you busy.

To: Susan Hauser

I am aware of one New York City radio station, WEVD at 1050 on the AM
dial, that broadcasts programs in Yiddish several times a week. Sunday
afternons and I think Wednesday afternoons, there are lectures and
interviews with writers and scholars. Friday afternoon, a few hours
before Shabes, there is a talk (droshe) on the Pentateuchal portion of
the week by Rabbi Tsvi Zinger. After that, another man reads the news in
Yiddish. I'm sorry I can't be more exact. The signal is fairly powerful,
reaching as far as the nearer portions of eastern Connecticut.

Dear Susan,

New York City has one station which has Yiddish programming. It is WEVD,
AM 1050. I believe there is a daily news broadcast in the afternoon at
about 4:00 or 4:30, I'm not sure. There is also some Yiddish programming
on Sunday: 10:00 AM is the Forward Hour. There may be other times, but I
do not have that information at hand. Hope this is helpful.

To Susan Hauser:

Yes! there is certainly still Yiddish programming in the NYC area every
day of the week save the Sabbath.  Yiiddish radio may be heard on WEVD,
1050 on the AM dial. During the weekdays a newsbroadcast and religious
program may be heard in succession around noon or thereafter.  Sunday is
the bonanza day: Art Raymond's musical simkhe featuring a hearty load of
advertisements as well as some excellent Jewish music from around the
world is followed by strictly Yiddish language broadcasts, including a
weekly News round-up with the former actress Miryam Kressin, news from
the Bund: organizational matters as well as music and history, and Der
Forverts Sho, featuring a full hour of cultural programming under the
auspices of the Yiddish Forward.  For more precise scheduling information
I suggest that you give WEVD a call, their number can be found in the
phonebook.

To HLORBACH:

The song that you are recalling is "Lomir ale zingn a zemerl..."  I do
not recall all of the words either although I can tell you that there is
a full rendering of the song on an old record by Theodore Bikel, in which
he sings many Yiddish folksongs.  YIVO Institute for Jewish Research
located on 86th and 5th Ave in Manhattan has song books filled with
melodies and lyrics: perhaps you might visit YIVO, or request a photocopy
of their materials on the song by mail.
