Subject: boksa=carob=bokser

Jules Levin:

Your recent note about the word boksa for carob jarred something
in my memory:

When I went to day school we would get carob as a treat for  the holiday
Tu-Bishvat we called it "kharuv" in Hebrew or "bokser" in English..... Do
you (or anyone else out there) know if that is connected to "boksa"?  I'm
curious...I never knew why the school called it bokser, and as a child I
tried to figure out connections I remember some obscure convoluted idea I
had about the dog "boxer"....ha!

Subject: Tale of One City/Gershon Bacon lecture

I would like to locate an article which I understand was written upon the
death of Yakov Berliner, a Bund activist and member of the City Council
of the city of Piotrkow-Trybunalski, in the Jewish Daily Forward after
his death in April, 1941.  He and fellow Bund members were deported to
Auschwitz after a written list of resistance members was discovered by
the Gestapo.

There is a brief article on Berliner in the volume "A Tale of One City"
edited by Ben Giladi in cooperation with the Piotrkow Trybunalski Relief
Association in New York.  It was published by Shengold Publishers in
1991.

I have been unsuccessful in my efforts--admittedly modest--to confirm the
article and locate a copy.  I am asking for any suggestions on how to do
it.

Secondly, an announcement for anyone in the area of Metropolitan Toronto
about a lecture which might be of interest:

Dr. Gershon Bacon, Professor, Bar-Ilan University, Historian, Lecturer,
Fellow, Inst. of Advanced Studies, Hebrew University will speak at a
Shabbat Study Luncheon following Shabbat services at the Beth Tzedec
Congregation, 1700 Bathurst Street.

The title of the lecture is "A Traveller Disguised:  The Birth of Modern
Yiddish Literature".

There is no charge for the lecture.  There is for the luncheon.

Subject: yiddish operettas

I have a question for mevinim in Yiddish theater and music. I am
cataloguing a small collection of librettos of Yiddish operettas from the
early part of the century. The authors are Yosef Latayner (Hurbn
Yerusholayim), Avrom Goldfaden, (Akeydes Yitskhok, Bar-Kokhva), Boris
Thomashefky (Pintele Yud), Avrom-Mikhl Sharkanski (Kol Nidre). Can I
safely assume that if no credit is given for the music that these authors
were also responsible for the music?

Subject: German Jewry

For all questions concerning German Jewry I reccommend that David Brenner
turn to the Leo Baeck Institute in New York City.  It is worthwhile to
investigate the recveption of Yiddish theater in Prague, where Kafka is
known to have been impacted by it.  You might also want to interview some
of the old time European actors at the Folksbine Yiddish theater in NYC,
such as Tzipora Speisman.  The YIVO is of course also a necesary resource
in this matter.

Subject: "To like" in Litvish

Mikhl Herzog mentioned ikh hob lib as a potentially northern form.  As I
understand it, the quintessentially Litvish form iz Iakh hob holt.  What
does the atlas say on their distribution?

Subject: Rogelekh

In Cambridge, Massachusetts in the late sixties there was a wonderful
Polish bakery owned (nomen omen) by Mr. Rogal, whose name, spelled with a
small letter, means 'crescent-shaped roll'. The diminutive _rogalik_
(plural _rogaliki_) refers to a crescent-shaped pastry.  One Polish
cookbook that I looked includes recipes for eight different varieties
(made of puff pastry or with yeast; filled with nuts or poppy-seed or
jam). Similarly, Ukrainians bake _rohalyky_ and Slovaks, _rozky_ (that's
_z_ with a _hachek_).

There is a virus on America Online being sent by E-Mail. If you get anything
called "Good Times", DON'T read it or download it.  It is a virus that will
erase your hard drive.  Forward this to all your friends.  It may help
them a lot.

Subject: Parev

I am curious about the etymology of "parev"/"pareve".  Whatever use it
has in Hebrew seems imported from Yiddish, not vice versa, and it doesn't
seem to have a Teutonic cognate.  The closest I can find in Russian or
Polish are words that relate to steam, and that seems far-fetched (or
perhaps far-blonzhet)  ;-).
