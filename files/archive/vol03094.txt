Subject: Fishl Kutner, Yiddish schools, etc.

     As a brief postscript to what I wrote the other day about Fishl
Kutner, I would like to briefly mention something that he discovered
in his research.

     Did you know that Mexico, Canada, Australia and Argentina all
have Yiddish Day Schools? I knew that three of the above did. I had
a hazy sense that Mexico did. Unfortunately, I was unsuccessful in
contacting anyone there. Fishl succeeded in making numerous contacts
there. If he has time, it would be wonderful if he could provide a
description of what is going on there. If reports can be believed,
they have a large Shule movement there.

     I have a reason for bringing it up. I feel that Yiddish Day
Schools are the best way to teach children short of having Yiddish
speaking parents that attend Yugntruf's Pripetchik. I have noticed
that where you have them you find young people in their 20's, 30's
and 40's that speak Yiddish. Australia's Sholem Aleichem School
(founded 1974) has helped to revitalize the Kadimah (the local Bund
group). They may not speak it every day. Importantly, they can speak
Yiddish if they want to. In the United States, that is far from
true.*

     The Workmen's Circle publishes a series of Yiddish children's
books. I sell very few in the United States. The bulk of them are
sold to the Sholem Aleichem School in Australia and the I.L. Peretz
School in Montreal. Both schools purchase large quantities of the
more advanced books in the series. As far as I know, the Peretz
Schools teaches both Hebrew and Yiddish and gives instruction in
French and English. I hope someone from Montreal will correct me if
I am wrong.

     I am not sure if such schools would work in the United States.
In all of the above, the Jewish communities are much smaller and
there is a large enough concentration of parents interested in
giving their children such an education. I know that many of the
Workmen's Circle Shules closed in the 1960's due to a lack of
students. It may be that the only places that can support such
schools are large metropolitan areas. It is possible that Yiddish
schools can only thrive when the Jewish community is smaller and
feels a need to rally around the institutions they have. I have
always felt that the farther you get away from New York, the more
involved people get in the events and organizations in their area.

     This is my feeling. Failing the above, I feel we should attempt
to get more Hebrew schools to adopt Yiddish as part of their
curriculum. I'm certain that other people have different opinions
and look forward to hearing them.

 A sad note...

    A few weeks ago, Frieda Wiener, Houston area Yiddish activist,
passed away at the age 103. I will reproduce the Forward obituary
shortly.

Subject: Horrors

	As a linguist interested in Yiddish I'm embarrassed at the
following item, which was posted on the LINGUIST e-mail discussion
list.  (I haven't asked permission to circulate it.)  It's an object
lesson: not only is the transcription about as awful as you can get,
there's no sense that it's worth even trying to get the Yiddish
correct.  Looks more like the Katzenjammer Kids.  Talk about the
ludic use of Yiddish.  Standard shmandard; -- let it at least be
Yiddish.

Subject: RE: 4.594 Just for Fun: Yiddish/Hebrew Pun

I guess it is time to tell an old Yiddish/French pun joke:

A Yiddish-speaking couple send their son to a French Lycee to get
"kultur."

The son comes home the first day and Papa frakt (asks)(and please
pardon my Yiddish errors but this is how I remember the joke): (NB
ch = [x])

New? Vas hapsdu gelehrnt diese tog [So, what did you learn today?].

OOy, Papa, the son replies, Ich bin gelehrnt dat an aksent agu gait
a hint (makes the appropiate upper gesture) oon an aksent grav gait
a hir (makes the appropriate downward gesture) [ Oh, Dad,I learned
that an accent ague goes that way, and an accent grave goes this way
NB: the gestures are reminiscent of bird's wing flapping)].

And papa says: Is goot; vas noch hapsdu gelehrnt mayn zoohne?
[that's good; what else did you learn, m'boy?].

And the son says: Ich bin gelehrnt dat a palatz is a chato; unt a
sheine palatz is a bo chato [I learned that a house is a chateau;
and a beautiful house is a beau chateau NB. which of course sounds
like the opening line of all prayers in Hebrew [baroch ato. . .]

Now the papa cannot believe his ears re: this learning of Hebrew
prayers in a French school so he says, a bit incredulously: Azoi?
[Is that the truth/is that really so?]

And the son says proudly: Yah, Papa, unt azoi in Fransozish is azoi!
[Yup, Pop, that's right. And "indeed" in French is [wazo] oiseau!]

It probably is better in its nonsense form in the Yiddish telling,
but for what it is worth. . .

Subject: Rivkele di shabetke

In response to Pierre Lewis(Hilf gevinsht Wed Aug 25) - I leave the
grammatical questions to more fluent speakers of the language.  My
understanding of the wartime song "Rivkele di shabetke" is that it
means she was a sabbath woman. Her husband Hershele was taken by the
Nazis on sabbath and she mourned for him. I don't know about
mitgebrengt za fidele - perhaps it was their(zayer) fiddle or maybe
the word has been imported from Russian.  I'd be interested to know
what others think.
