Subject: MOLLY PICON

My Dad took me to see Molly Picon at a father-son night at
Temple Emanuel in Buflo.  This was in the middle of WWII
and I was about 14.  The first thing I noticed about her
was her clear, strong, lilting soprano voice which drew us
immediately to her.  Of all her skits, I remember only one
which was somewhat risque for the time.  She played the
part of a mother writing a letter to the sergeant of her
son's company.  "And sergeant," she said, "give mine
Eedeleh only the breast of the chicken -- he always liked
the breast."  Corny now, but I recall the combination of
modesty, motherly concern and womanly/motherly pride in her
endowments that she conveyed.  She was sensational, a
treasure. I can imagine her tanzing and singing as a child
--her parents certainly must have loved her!  I don't know
of anybody who saw her who didn't.

What is the origin of eppes?  And the difference between

Subject: Aron Vergelis

I would like to echo Bob Werman's comments about Vergelis
and add that during the Brezhnev years one of the many
antisemitic publications distributed by the Soviet Novosti
Press Agency was Vergelis's scandalous book, "On the Jewish
Street," an antisemitic diatribe against American Jewry
written by a Jew, no less.

Admittedly Vergelis was involved in "keeping Yiddish alive"
in the USSR, but it was a Yiddish completely stripped of
any traces of Yiddishkeit, sanitized carefully to pass
inspection.  One could argue that he simply did what he had
to do to survive and publish under each regime, but what
survived was simply the letters...  I cannot excuse his
capitulation to the regime because he allowed himself to be
used by the government as a propaganda tool apparently with
full knowledge (or he wouldn't have written the books he
did).

When we would protest to the Soviets about the lack of
Jewish publications in the USSR or the persecution of Jews
attempting to start their own Hebrew courses they would
always point to Sovyetish Heimland to show us that we were
mistaken and that Jewish publications were alive and well
and there was no need for competition.

If there truly is to be any resurgence of Yiddish in the
CIS, then perhaps Vergelis should move aside and let a Jew
more worthy of our trust take the lead.  Vergelis is a sad
case indeed.......

Subject:  YIVO transcription of Yiddish

There are three handy tables for the YIVO transcription of
Yiddish:  (1) College Yiddish, by Uriel Weinreich (p. 26);
(2) Modern English-Yiddish Yiddish-English Dictionary, also
by Uriel Weinreich (English preface, p. xxi); and (3)
Encyclopaedia Judaica, vol. 1 (Index vol.), p. 91.  In the
latter source, please ignore "ch" as an alternative trans-
cription for "tes-shin."  "Ch" should NEVER be used in ANY
transcription or transliteration scheme aimed at English
speakers.  As an example of the confusion that this causes,
see p. 15 of Chester G. Cohen's "Shtetl Finder" (Los
Angeles: Perivale, 1980), where there are the following
adjacent entries:

     Chmiliv (Chmielow, SW of Lublin) [pronounced KHMILIV];
     Chmilov, Chemilov (Cmielow, SW of Lublin) [prounounced
     TSHMILOV or TSHMILEV]

There is one other YIVO-based transcription/transliteration
scheme for Yiddish, called ALA/LC (American Library
Association/Library of Congress), which is used in
virtually all card and online library catalogs in the U.S.
The most visible difference between the YIVO and ALA/LC
schemes is in their respective handling of "zayin-shin" =
"zh" according to YIVO, and "zsh" according to ALA/LC.
Thus, ALA/LC is closer than YIVO to a pure transliteration
system.  On the other hand, both systems transcribe, rather
than trans- literate loshn-koydesh elements in Yiddish,
although here, too, there are differences between YIVO and
ALA/LC.  For more information on ALA/LC romanization, see
"Hebraica Cataloging:  A Guide to ALA/LC Romanization and
Descriptive Cataloging," prepared by Paul Maher
(Washington, DC:  Library of Congress, Cataloging
Distribution Service, 1987).
