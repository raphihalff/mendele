My colleague, Hal Brodsky has asked about where he might locate

Subject: Kibosh

As Ellen Prince writes (7.120), the word isn't found in Yiddish, though
at
least two British etymologists (Weekley and Partridge) think it might
be. The
latter writes: "perhaps ex Yiddish which has kyebosh or kibosh,
eighteen
pence: a sense that has got into [the] East End of London".

In the Supplement he offers: "from Yiddish, but ex Yiddish kabas,
kabbasten,
to suppress" (and cites the 1889 Barrere and Leland _Dictionary of
Slang,
Jargon and Cant_). 

Finally P. cites Julian Franklyn who "proposes a quite different origin:
the
heraldic caboshed (or caboched or cabossed or cabaged or ...)--see
the
O.E.D.--and Scotshunting caboche or cabage or cabbage, to cut off a
deer's
head close behind the horns". 

The term "put the kibosh on", by the way, shows up as early as 1838
(Dickens). 

But if it's not a(n attested) Yiddish word maybe the question is for
some
other forum.

Subject: Dropping or adding a g in Yiddish

Besides baleytn-bagleytn (discussed a few weeks ago), there is at
least one
other case where a Yiddish word has either dropped or added the g
sound
somewhere along the way.  The past participle of shrayen (to shout)
is either
geshrien or geshrign.  Now, the linguistics experts may be able to
tell us if
the histories of these two examples are parallel or in any way
related.

Subject: In Odes

I am trying to get the words to a Yiddish theater tune called "In
Odes."  A
friend is trying to use it in a performance she's doing and needs to
get
the exact words.  I couldn't make them all out from the cassette.
Any help
would be most appreciated.

Subject: Sotsialistn in kongres 

Dem 13tn detsember 1997 hot geshribn Harold L Orbach (07.120):
"And while
Ellyet Hersh Gertl (07.117) correctly notes that Bernard Sanders of
Vermont is
Jewish and a socialist personally, he has been elected to Congress (as
he was
as Mayor of Burlington earlier) as an independent and not as
representing a
socialist party as were Victor Berger and Meyer London." 

A dank Khaver Orbachn far dem vos er hot nor itst klor gemakht di
frierdike

nisht
dertseylt az Victor Berger un Meyer London zenen geven "Sotsialistn"

Congress."  In

I appreciate Mr. Orbach's belated clarification of his original
statement,
however, in that initial post (07.112), he does not say that Victor
Berger and
Meyer London were "Socialists" with a capital "S" rather than with a
small "s"
as he now claims.  Mr. Orbach said in his first message: 

"It is perhaps not an accident either that the only two socialists ever
elected to the U.S. Congress, Victor Berger of Milwaukee and Meyer
London of
Manhattan, New York were Jews." 

Nowhere in the declaration above is there anything that indicates
specifically
that Berger and Meyer were elected as members of a particular
socialist party
or parties, merely that they were "the only two socialists ever elected
to the
U.S. Congress."  I stand by my original response.  In the context of
Harold
Orbach's statement above, they were not the only socialists ever
elected as he
claims.  There is at least one more, Bernard Sanders, who, it is true,
has
been elected as an "independent" with a small "i" (not a member of
some party
called "Independent") and as such is the member of no party.  He is,
however,
an avowed socialist.  Had Mr. Orbach stated _initially_ that Berger
and Meyers
were the only members of Socialist parties with a capital "S" ever
elected to
the Congress, he might have some merit to his argument now but by
the way he
put it in his first statement, what I said is still right on the mark. 
Sanders is certainly a socialist and he is an elected Member of
Congress.

I'm interested in finding additional verses to an old  yiddish love
song:

Subject: Tempers on Mendele

The recent expressions of feeling on Mendele indicate to me a
sociology of
closeness within the group. Angers and deep emotions are not
expended upon
strangers, or people we do not value. Also the adrenalin moves us to
action,
often positive and creative. 

We know each other for years, by our words. I find it wonderful how
the
personna behind the posting glitters through.  When I see some
names now, I
think, "Oy! ot kumt der nudnik, azoy vi mayn feter Yidl" so
sometimes I close
the door by deleting. 

Other names, like Ellen Prince or Noyekh's or Zellig Bach or the
Mloteks bring
joy even before reading their ideas.

So, like family, let's just keep deleting and reading, letting the
sunshine
in; in any form it takes, it still glows like gold. Un men ken azoy
farflekhtn
a keyt, a goldenem.

Subject: Hard stuff

First of all, apologies to Robert Goldenberg for libeling the
pronunciation of
"kibosh."  (And to anyone else who was ticked off by my error.)  No
disrespect
intended to Americans or Canadians. 

Secondly, I'm curious about etymological distinctions in liquor.  Viski,
konyak, vishnik, and shnaps all have obvious, often non-Yiddish,
origins as
specific liquors.  But what about mashke, bronfn, and yayen-soref?
Moreover,
I'm guessing that even the words of obvious derivation no longer
necessarily
have their original meanings.  Does Yiddish maintain a definite liquor
cabinet, or are they all more or less synonyms?  And while we're at it,
why
can I not find "vodka" in Yiddish?  (My only source at this time is
Weinreich's dictionary.)  It seems odd that Yiddish should have such a
long
history in Russia and the Ukraine -- where did vodka originate,
anyway? -- and
yet there is no Yiddish word for the liquor most closely associated
with the
region.  Please enlighten me.

Subject: history of Mendele; various words

1. HISTORY OF MENDELE. Some may recall that Mendele was first
launched to
provide a forum for the "academics"--the linguists and literary
scholars,
historians (and others who are not intimidated by them)  to do their
thing
without distressing the other subscribers to "mail.Yiddish"(??) which
was then
emanating from Toronto. As it turned out, "mail.Yiddish" soon gave
up the
ghost and, left to fend for themselves, "the others" who seem to have
sought
refuge in Mendele, are now moved to renew the "brou-ha-ha" (look
that one up
in Mendele!!)  Not fair, not fair. 

2. _fonye_: From the mouth of a native speaker relating the story of
her
brother's early 20th century trip from Poland to America. Threatened
with
conscription, he decided to leave the country:  "Vus? Gayn dinen dem
Fonye? 
Fe!"  Clearly the Czar, no? 

3. _bronfn_ (Northeastern Yiddish _branfn_), surely cognate with, and
of
similar significance as German _Branntwein_ 'brandy', 'spirits',
'hooch'. 
I've tried, without much success to find a meaningful distinction
between
Yiddish _bronfn_ and _shnaps_. Are there meaningful distinction in
English
between, liquor and whiskey? 

4. _hegdesh_, spelled _hekdesh_ (< Hebrew _hekdeysh_, ranging in
meaning from
'consecration' to 'poor house'!) is, in Yiddish the designation for the
institution for warehousing the "sick poor". _an ort far kranke
oremelayt_! It
has much the same connotations as English _bedlam_ (which
originally
designated an institution for the mentally ill).
