Subject: Introduction

Thanks to Morrie Feller, I have found my way into Mendele and you are all
stirring up wonderful memories of growing up in a large family in New
York and Connecticut.  While my Yiddish is limited to a few words and
phrases, reading the Mendele mail is pushing me to learn more.

As a further incentive for me to join this active group, I had an Aunt
Yetta Zwerling who co-starred with Menasha Skolnick (pardon the spelling)
in the Yiddish theatre.  She would have loved this.

Thanks for keeping Yiddish alive,

Dennis Skigen

Subject: Shirtsleeves to shirtsleeves in three generations

Is there a Yiddish expression for the English idiom `From shirtsleeves to
shirtsleeves in three generations'?  I recall my grandfather using an
expression that seemed close, back in the 1950s, but I didn't know enough
Yiddish to remember exactly what he said.  Thanks.

Thought this piece culled from the AP newswire may be of some interest.

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Attorneys in the O.J. Simpson case, battling again
over how things are done on opposite coasts, skirmished playfully Monday
over the Yiddish word for crazy.

"I just thought, you know, these guys are meshuge and (I) didn't know --
didn't know what they were up to," Deputy District Attorney Hank Goldberg
commented to the judge. Goldberg, born and raised in Los Angeles, was
describing defense experts' conduct as they looked for blood evidence
left behind in Simpson's white Ford Bronco.

Defense attorney Barry Scheck, a proud Jewish son of New York, popped up
to correct him.

"Meshugener," Scheck said.

"Well, this is Los Angeles, it's an L.A. pronunciation," Goldberg said to
chuckles in the courtroom. Goldberg was right -- sort of.

According to The Modern English-Yiddish, Yiddish-English Dictionary
published in 1968 by YIVO, the Institute for Jewish Research in New York,
meshuge is the adjective for crazy or mad -- no matter what city you're
from. Meshugener is the noun for madman or lunatic. Even if Scheck
thought the noun form was called for, crazy men would properly be called
meshugoyim.

Subject: Chicken-footed demons

Baba Yaga is a witch (all right, a senior-citizen female Wiccan
practicioner) of Russian folk-lore who is reputed to live in a hut on
chicken-legs. Mussourgsky's "Pictures at an exhibition" includes a
depiction of a painting of this by Hartmann.

Subject: Chicken-footed demons

The Russian witch who lived in a house on chicken legs was named Baba
Yaga. She invited children in, and then roasted and ate them.
Presumably, she was related to the Hansel & Gretel witch, who must have
been more successful, since ginger bread is probably a better lure than
chicken legs.

Sholom aleichem, yidn.  The witch who lives in the hut on chicken legs in
the forest in Russian folk tales is Baba Yaga.

I'm new to the list.  Where does she turn up in Yiddish?  (since this was
already discussed, feel free to reply via e-mail, not through the list.

Subject: Pocket book

For my wife's aunts in the Bronx, the Yiddish word for purse is
"pakebuk".  For her mother and her aunt who live in Toronto (total four
sisters, all camp survivors originally from Staszow), the word is "baytl"
(pronounced "baatl").  We've always understood "pocket book" to be a
NYC-ism.

Subject: Yiddish in translation - once more

I think Morrie Feller and I are essentially in agreement about the
importance of availability of Yiddish and English texts.  What he
appeared to infer was that I think English translations of Yiddish are
more important and useful than Yiddish originals.  This is not the case;
as a person who has spent her adult life teaching Spanish literature in
the original, I am keenly aware of what is lost in translation.  What
Iwas trying to say was that for me and for many other non-fluent students
of Yiddish at this time, translations allow us to enter the world of
Yiddish, however imperfectly, and encourage us to learn more.  Yiddish,
like peninsular Spanish literature, should be translated into English;
the translations enrich everyone.  This does not mean that the originals
should be abandoned.  My teacher Joseph Silverman (olevhasholem), a
speaker of Yiddish and a brilliant scholar and collector of Sephardic
ballads, suggested, in a 1974 article on (and I translate) the Art of
Renouncing Nothing, that the best way to understand Cervantes was to cite
Wallace Stevens:  _[They] had to choose.  But it was not a choice/Between
excluding things.  It was not a choice/Between, but of._     Given a
choice between Yiddish originals and translations, I would choose both.
I cannot speak for anyone else.

Subject: A Bintl Brif

I have seen English translations of these letters, but never any in the
original Yiddish.  As a teaching device, I think the original versions
alongside the translations would be very useful.  Has anyone ever seen
the original Yiddish versions collected in one place?
