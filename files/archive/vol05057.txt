Subject: Nursery rhyme

My bobe (who was from Vilna) told us this nursery rhyme:

Itzke Pitzke nodl tessel
Geyt in krom und gamvet a flesl
Geyt in shul un gamvet a siddur
Geyt af'n gas und falt anider.

Has anyone else heard this?  Does anybody else know any other Yiddish
nursery rhymes?  Rhyming children's taunts don't count.

By the way, where I come from (South Africa) where most Yiddish is
Litvak, I believe the phrase "klaybn nakhes" is used.  I do not
believe that I ever heard of the other varieties (shepn/shlepn).

Subject: Mitsvevaser - thank you!

Thanks to all Mendelniks who replied to my question about mitsvevaser.
Nice guesses! Here are some of them:

-negl vaser
-mayim akharonim
-something that has to do with mikveyes
-holy water (Catholic)
-the Chinese water-throwing holiday
-a reference to the ancient custom in the Temple in Jerusalem called
"simkes beys ha-shoeve"
-matsevaser
-the water used for washing one's hands before entering a shul
-mits ve-vaser (mits=zaft af loshn koydesh, thus "zaft mit vaser")

In my question I did not provide a context because I was curious if
anyone has ever heard the word. I asked several elderly Hungarian Yiddish
speakers but they didn't know either, gave the same guesses.

Here is the context where I have the word from and my guess: I found the
proverb

"Az oszer isz ka svue, miczvevaszer ka refue" , which translates into
YIVO transcription
"Az oser keyn shvue, mitsvevaser keyn refue"

in a collection of Hungarian Yiddish proverbs. Since in Hungarian there
are several proverbs about the lack of the healing effect of the holy
water, I thought the Yiddish may be a parallel of it, so it means "Just
like 'forbidden' does not mean 'promised', the holy water does not heal".

Does that make any sense?

Subject: Mitsvevaser, matsevaser, mikvevaser

In vol. 5.053, Vera Szabo asked about the word 'mitsvevaser'.  I'd never
heard it before, but my first reaction was that it might refer to water
brought to the table to sprinkle on the hands before bentshen, also known
as 'mayimakhroynim vaser'.

[A semi-related anecdote:  the Minkatcher Rebbe (pre-WWII) used to say
that one shouldn't say 'mayimakhroynim vaser', 'gityontif', or 'ingerishe
naar', because they're all redundant.  (He was a Galitsyaner in an
ingerishe shtele.)  He would therefore greet congregants on holidays with
a blessing of "yontif".]

Then I asked my grandfather (a poylisher fin Kozhnits).  His immediate
reaction was that it refers to mayim shelonu.  (When baking matses for
Peysakh, one must use water which was drawn the day before and stored in
sealed containers overnight.  This water is known as 'mayim shelonu', or
'inzer vaser'.)  When I asked my father (a native speaker fin
Vilyamzburg, Minkatsher/Galitsyaner parents), he said it might be a
corruption of 'matse vaser';  he once heard 'matse vaser' used, and
wasn't sure what the speaker was referring to, but had speculated that he
meant mayim shelonu.

I think that my grandfather's response may have been speculation, because
his next comment was that it might be a corruption of 'mikvevaser' (water
from the mikve).  He then recalled that one would say, in reference to a
tasteless drink, 's'iz azoy vi mikvevaser'--it's like water from the
mikve.  [Khsidim go to the mikve often (preferably every day), and even
after the introduction of modern chemicals, they're still not very clean,
especially on a Friday afternoon.]

Subject: Gebn a mishebeyrakh / an aliye

In vol. 5.054, Reb Mikhl Herzog wrote that at a recent conference, some
linguists "gave [him] a _mishebeyrakh_ [he] won't easily forget."  I
couldn't tell whether this mishebeyrakh was a good thing or not, but it
reminded me of an expression my (poylisher) grandfather uses:  by him, to
tell someone off, giving a long, detailed account of all their faults and
misdeeds, is "ts'gebn an aliye".  Are any other mendelyaner familiar with
the expression?  Is it similar to, the same as, or entirely different
from "gebn a mishebeyrakh"?
