Subject: Goldfadn play

The complete title of the Goldfadn play Andrew Cassell refers to (that
was being staged in an amateur production in Keidan [6.064]) is
doubtless "Di kaprizne kale-moyd oder Kabtsnzon et Hungerman." The
earliest known printed version is from 1887. In Zilbertsvayg's theater
lexicon, there's a reproduction of the frontispiece in v. 1, col. 291.
Should you want to play with the proper names, you might translate the
whole thing as: "The Capricious Bride, or Pauperson and Hungerman."

Subject: Pi, pa, po

Several people have commented on "tsvey geyen".  Let me take a shot at
"pi pa po--shoyn nishto".  My Sprachgefuehl says that it means: in as
much time as it takes to say "pi pa po", it's gone.

Subject: Yiddish word processing

A. Joseph Ross asks about a Yiddish word processing program based on
Word Perfect.  Word Perfect used to market a Hebrew Language Module, but
it is apparently no longer being sold.  The Hebrew character set was
relatively Yiddish friendly: it included pey and yud-yud, vov-vov and
vov-yud as single characters.  I added keyboard macros for kometz-alef,
pasakh-alef, and pasah-tsvey-yudn.  The only ones missing were
khirik-yud and rafe, which I frankly don't miss.  I still use it for the
Yiddish portion of the Yiddish of Greater Washington newsletter.

The program was a modification of WP 5.1 for DOS.  There have been
rumors of a version for WP for Windows, but with the corporate ups and
downs of WP, nothing has appeared.  This is a little surprising, since
the same programming would produce an Arabic version, which should have
a considerable market.

A g'mar khasime toyve to all.

Subject: Bookshops in Israel

Thank you to everyone who wrote to me with bookshop recommendations.

Here is a list of the bookshops.

Peretz Farlag
Rechov Brener 14
Tel Aviv
Tel. 03-528 1751

Comments: Recommended by Tsuguya Sasaki, Leybl Botvink and Barbara Mann.
Barbara adds that thay have a good selection "and even lovelier
company". They are only open till 12:30. There is a small cafe besides
the bookshop which was lit by candles when I was there. The atmosphere
felt like one of the cafes in Singer's Warsaw while the character I met
could have walked straight out of La Boheme.

Beis Sholem Aleichem
Beis Dov 30 (Nr. Rechov Gordon)
Tel Aviv

Franz Kurski Library
Rechov Kalisher 48 (Nr. Rechov Alnby)
Tel Aviv

The last two were recommended by Leybl Botvinik who added that while the
Perets Farlag is a 'Shop' the latter two are merely places where one can
find books.

Robinson Books
Rechov Nachlat Binyamin (below the shuk)
Tel Aviv
Tel. 03-560 1626

Recommended by Barbara as a wonderful place for finding rare, out of
print items. 'Not cheap, but very professional.'

J(?) Twersky
Rechov Sheinkin 20
Tel Aviv

Gaston L. Schmir mentioned this one though he (she?) is not sure if it
is still open nor if this is the correct address.

Unfortunately the replies came too late and I only managed the Perets
Farlag which was closed. Once again thank you to all for sending in
their recommendations.

Subject: A contemptuous title

With reference to Leah Zazulyer's recent query (6.062,4) about the book
_Dictionary-Shmictionary_:

It is supposed to be a "hilariously" humorous book, but in my opinion
has no merits whatsoever for one who is serious about Yiddish.

The very title suggests the authors' belittlement and contempt of the
subject, as indicated by the imitative "Shmictionary."

All English words when reduplicated with the additional Yiddish initial
morpheme "shm-'  -- for instance, "espert-shmexpert,"  "poet-shmoet,"
"banquet-shmanket" -- are designed to _devalue_ the subject and to
diminish its importance.

The book's only saving grace is its use of numerous quotations using
Yiddish-origin words -- quotations from William Styron's _Sophie's
Choice_ , for instance, and from Lana Turner's autobiography.

Sol Steinmetz, in his _A Century of Yiddish in America:  Yiddish and
English_ (1986) discusses the nature of the Yiddish "shm-" accretion to
English words when doubled with their original, and makes  the following
interesting observation (p. 65):

    "_Shm- is often used with a jocular follow-up clause, as in
    Oedipus-Shmoedipus -- as long as he loves his mother..."
