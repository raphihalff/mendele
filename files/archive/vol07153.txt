Subject: Mendele's elitism

di khevre hobn mir gekhapt baym vort un gemakht fun mir a tsimes.

So let me try and make my point but without rhetoric.

The problem, as I see it, is twofold. A) The arrogant dismissiveness of some
contributors towards those who don't share their knowledge in the given
subject or wish to bring in a traditional explanation, and b) the tendency of
posts to drag on and on and on, in many instances simply repeating what has
already been said. 

Regarding supposedly wrong explanations I cannot add a word to that which has
already been said by Ron Robboy (vol. 07.123): 

"As for the issues of folk etymologies, amateur linguistics, dictionaries, and
Morality, they have all but merged with the particulars of the _davenen_
debate and seem to me they should be treated of a piece.  While I agree with
the position that informed, methodologically disciplined inquiry is essential
if we are to develop anything approaching reliable explanations for some of
these mysteries, I don't share the view that uninformed, methodologically
undisciplined observation has no place on Mendele.  What ought to be clear is
that uninformed, methodologically undisciplined observation is traditional! It
is a part of Yiddish culture, no less than the parallel tradition of great
learning.  As such, it is the mere fact of this stuff's existence, this
half-baked oral pseudo-learning, and of the passionate concern for it, that is
so interesting. To exclude it because it cannot be supported by linguistic
science or because it is not in a dictionary distorts the reality of the
culture." 

Even if one were to disagree with the above sentiments or if one wanted to
clearly distinguish between proper etymology and folk stuff there are still
plenty of ways of doing it respectfully. The recently deceased critic Chaim
Bermant, who was anything but populist, once when writing about yidishistn
added as an aside that there is nothing that they don't seem to know about.
Now if this stereotype has no truth to it then there is no better place than
this to dispel this notion. However, if, as I suspect, there is more than a
bit of truth to it then mendele should be anything but the place to reinforce
these damaging stereotypes. 

On the other point that subjects drag on for what seems like eternity, I fully
accept that there are those who are interested in the subject but even they
would agree that repetition does nothing to the argument.  Should there not be
a point where the editor calls for a moratorium on a subject because this time
round the arguments have been exhausted? 

A respected regular contributor to mendele writing to me privately commented
about an 'ivory tower of Yiddish for the perfect intelligensia'. I myself have
felt deterred to bring up a subject for the fear that I will still be reading
about it in six weeks time. Is this what most subscribers want? Methinks not. 

So vos is di eytse? Split up mendele in two so that like true jews we'll all
have one list _not_ to subscribe to? khas vesholem, men zol zikh nisht
farzindigen mit reyd. Set up a Ne'eman comittee over who is a yidishist? toyg
oykh nisht.  a poshete eytse, treat one another politely and respectfully
(after all it would be inconsistent to reject folk etymology but adopt folk
civility) and know when to put an end to exhausted subjects. 

And how about adding to the masthead the word 'culture' to complement
'literature and language'?

Iz es derloybt (s'farshteyt zikh nor fun tsayt tsu tsayt) a gute vort in
Mendele arayn tsushmuglen? 

Noyekh Miller's five, succinct, wisely crafted paragraphs define the highest
standards that Mendele might hope to achieve, and occasionally does achieve. 
Would that they could be fastened to virtual doorposts for the benefit of
newcomers! 

Kol hakavod!

Subject: The nature of Mendele?

I am not aware that I was part of a "current dust-up over language".  Well, so
be it.  I _am_ aware of suggesting that accuracy and care in any discussion
advances the discussion while inaccuracy and misquotation makes the discussion
spin out of control and sends it into chaos.  That makes people upset.  For
example, contrary to Ellen Prince (7151, 2) I (7.150, 2) did not point out
"the obvious that this is 'not a scholar's list'."  I agree that this is not a
scholar's list.  I did not say it, but I agree with the implication that this
should not lead to indulgence of unscholarly, nit geshtoygn nit gefloygn
statements as fact. To Ellen Prince, I seem "shocked".  Nit geshtoygn nit
gefloygn. 

Further, implying that sincerely proposed but unresearched, folk impressions
about Yiddish etymology are analogous to stating that "fire is produced by the
movement of phlogiston" seems to be an attempt at reductio ad absurdum.  It
doesn't work.  There is no equivalence.  After all, though some linguistic
insights may be established facts by now, most are still tentative, awaiting
research work, some in progress.  Phlogiston as a theory is not a work in
progress.  That's why linguistic research is supported in scholarly
institutions, while research by phlogiston theorists is not. 

My suggestion to the "specialists":  Contributing a carefully researched,
educational insight (even if a work in progress) to Mendele prevents gagging,
privately or publicaly. 

I return to my theme that the spirit of Yiddish needs protection.  We must
teach in humility and accurately, and we should learn with humility and
accurately.  Attempted mutual humiliation may sometimes be popular among so-
called scholars but is downright unscholarly.  Teaching and learning at the
same time (can't have one without the other) fits perfectly both the Yiddish
and the academic scholarly spirit.

Subject: lomir zikh iberbeten

Concerning pro/am battles, can't we sit nice and maybe have a piece of fruit?
I have this fantasy of a group of people who simply love the sound and the
haymishe memories of Yiddish--scholarls, groyse makhers, elitists, competent
speakers, newbies, whoever.

I like having my questions answered and my errors corrected. But as much as I
have enjoyed and learned from Ellen Prince's prior postings, I have a problem
with her latest response. She wrote: 

"I don't recall anyone ever criticizing anyone's *question* on Mendele -- it's
the *assertions* that have induced the gagging.  (And know that those who've
gagged publicly are but a small percentage of those of us gagging privately.)

The Internet is 'a free country' and anyone can post whatever s/he likes to an
open list -- but those who are motivated by a desire for warm and fuzzy
feelings and who are guided by Herskovic's sentiment that 'Ignorance is bliss'
should not be surprised when some of the response is disgust." 

Gagging and disgust,....really? Well, gag if you must, but it has
consequences. When you show disgust publicly (i.e., online), you repel from
the wonderful world of mama loshen not only those whom you target, but also
others who have a very tenuous hold on Yiddish and would like it associated
with pleasant experiences. Is disgust an aid to learning? Was your most
effective teacher one who threw up on you or your classmates when you were
wrong? Why not respond kindly and simply correct someone who, being mistaken,
might not mind being educated?

Is this so hard to understand? Is it so much to ask? What am I missing? 

Listen, I can't be angry at anyone today. I just discovered, in a musty
closet, a record--that I thought I'd lost--of Jan Peerce singing "a din toyre
mit got".

Subject: Mendele's elitism

Thank you to Reb Noyekh!  Gently, kindly, but without pulling any punches --
sounds impossible, but you did it.  In fact I think linguistics has an even
harder time "getting any respect" than pants pressing or physics or history,
because everyone thinks s/he's an expert on language.  Everyone knows pants,
quarks, and events are out there in the world to be examined objectively, but
language is inside the head, and the community. Seems more like morals or a
yerushe, than like germs or revolutions.  That this turns out to be systematic
is what makes linguistic research so fascinating. 

By the way, anyone interested in language will have a lot of fun (but maybe
raise their blood pressure a few points) reading Steven Pinker's beautifully
written book THE LANGUAGE INSTINCT.

Subject: The nature of Mendele

I'm relatively new to Mendele and must say I enjoy it very much.  I'm not a
linguist but am considered as speaking a pretty decent "mama loshen" learned
from a remarkable bubbe who enjoyed showing off my yiddish ability to her
friends whose reaction was, "er is take an Amerikannisher geborene ?"  One
thing has impressed me about Mendele, however. That is that if you have two
self styled yiddishists it's not long before you get a polemic.  It would all
be a lot more educational for the rest of us if it came with a little less
vitriol, sarcasm, inuendo and disparagement.  I am under the impression that
our participation stems from a love of this language.  Let's lower the
intimidation index.  Hutz mich und zeits mich...

Subject: Khala khalelyas?

A request has come in to Arbeter Ring Los Angeles from someone writing a
family memoir. He swears his mother uses an expression that sounds like "khala
khalelyas," by which she means "out in the sticks" or "in the boondocks." I
have run this expression by a number of Yiddish speakers at Arbeter Ring,
including our teacher, but no one has heard it. His mother comes from the town
of Anikst in Kovno gubernia; maybe it's a regionalism, although to my ear it
sounds like it has a Hebrew tam. Can anyone help? If so, please post on
Mendele, where I will see it (he doesn't subscribe), or contact him directly: 
His name is Lewis Chilton and he can be reached azoy: 
Chiltonl@dislink.jcte.jcs.mil The character before the @ is an L as in Lewis. 

A sheynem dank!
