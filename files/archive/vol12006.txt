Subject: Sheva Zucker's textbook, volume 2

The Jewish Book Center of The Workmen's Circle is pleased to announce
the publication of the second volume of Yiddish: An Introduction to the
Language, Literature and Culture by Sheva Zucker.

The first volume of Yiddish: An Introduction is a treasure for all
beginning students of Yiddish.  Simply put, no one serious about
learning the Yiddish language can do without Sheva Zucker's textbooks.  
Yiddish: An Introduction one of the finest textbooks available for
learning Yiddish, either in a classroom setting or through self study.  
Using literature, poems and songs, the student quickly moves along from
lesson to lesson to learn vocabulary and grammar.

The thousands of students, past and present, who began their studies
with Volume One, will now be able to continue their education with the
publication of the second volume for intermediate students.  Volume Two
of Yiddish: An Introduction fills a much needed gap for students
looking to further their knowledge of the Yiddish language.  The Jewish
Book Center of The Workmen's Circle is thrilled to be able to meet this
need.  Yiddish: An Introduction to the Language, Literature and
Culture, Volume Two is dedicated to the memory of Yosl Mlotek.

Subject: lekakh, nokh amol

Although "lekakh" came up for discussion about three years ago, I have
an etymological question directed to the linguists on the list.

Harkavy defined "lekakh" as "ginger-bread, ginger-cake." Of course, the
discussants three years ago unanimously described "lekakh" as "honey
cake," which would be my default definition as well. Lekakh does, of
course, contain spices (it is, after all, a spiced honey cake, though
not all versions contain ginger). I doubt, however, that too many of us
who are familiar with lekakh from childhood would instinctively call it
a spice cake, probably due to the connection of lekakh being served
with the apples and honey eaten on Rosh Hashonoh.

On a recent visit to Basel, I discovered a dessert cookie called
"laeckerli," which shares many similarities to lekakh. Laeckerli, like
lekakh, are made from honey that is brought to a boil, to which are
added nuts, spices and flour. The amount of flour added to laeckerli,
however, is proportionally less than that used in lekakh, and no eggs
are mixed in. Laeckerli batter is spread onto a cookie sheet, baked, a
sugar glaze is added, and the result is cut into small rectangles or
squares. Lekakh, of course, is a cake, often baked in a loaf pan.

The similarities in ingredients, production and name suggest that both
delicacies share a common origin and etymology. Yiddish "leken"  
(German "lecken") means "to lick," and German has an adjective "lecker"
meaning "tasty." But perhaps the linguists on the list have a better
idea of the etymology of "lekakh" and connections with Basler
"laeckerli."

Subject: Stuck on a word (lobbes).

Hello!  I pride myself on my Yiddish-language skills, but am stuck on a
word used by John Gross, former editor of the (London) Times Literary
Supplement) in his new book, A Double Thread: Growing Up English and
Jewish in London (Ivan R. Dee, Chicago, 2002, ISBN 1-56663-424-5).  
The Library of Congress CIP data: LC 2001047577.  The word he uses on
p.3, and throughout, is lobbes, which, he writes "means something like
'rascal' ."  A cousin says to him "You're such a lobbes!"

Can you help?  My dictionaries won't work.  Nor was a good friend with
a wonderful grasp of Yiddish able to find it.

Standing by.

With all thanks and good wishes

Subject: Term 'Peruvian' in Harkavy's dictionary

The term 'Peruvian' was current in South African English literature
between approximately 1890 and 1910. It was used by gentiles and by
anglicised Jews to describe the rude or uncouth behaviour of recent
Eastern European immigrants who had not yet acquired acceptable
standards of western cutural refinement. Yiddish speakers would refer
to the term as 'Peruvnik'.

The etymology of the term is somewhat obscure. The most common
explanationion in S.A. English is that it is an acronym for Polish and
Russian Union, a Jewish club founded in Kimberley, the diamonond mining
centre, in the 1870's. However all sorts of other fairly way out
suggestions have been made, such as connecting it to Baron de Hirsch's
colonisation scheme (which was in Argentina rather than Peru), and a
suggestion that it might have had some connection with the Yiddish verb
'pruvn' meaning 'to try'. And there are various others.

However what I am trying to ascertain, on behalf of Prof Milton Shain,
Director of the Kaplan Centre for Jewish Studies, who discusses the
term in his book 'The roots of antisemitism in South Africa', is
whether it was commonly used on the Lower East Side, or ever appeared
in early American Jewish literature. The reason that I am asking is
because the term is listed in Harkavy's dictionary 1928 edition,
although only on the English side and without any explanation. It is
simply translated as 'Peruvyanish', with the secondary definition:
'Peruvyanishe kore', translated as 'Peruvian bark'. I subsequently
found out that 'Peruvian bark' was the household name for 'quinine',
which was made out of the bark of a tree most readily available in Peru
in those days. It was a word that would have been known by the early
immigrants, as malaria was common in Eastern Europe and I believe
quinine was also used as a more general analgesic.

'Peruvian' is the only South American country term which made it into
Harkavy's dictionary, which includes the European terms:  French,
Dutch, German, Spanish and Italian. On the other hand Harkavy does not
include Russian or American. In the case of German, Spanish, Italian,
and English, the personal noun, i.e. 'a Daytsh' or 'an Italyener', is
also given and in all cases, other than Dutch, the adjectival phrase,
i.e. 'di Fransoyzishe shprakh' is also provided. In the case of Spanish
it also includes the term for 'Spanish fly' - 'Shpanishe flig'.

On the basis of the above comparisons I am trying to figure out how and
why 'Peruvian' came to be listed.

Was it just because of the country? Was the term, in its South African
meaning, known on the Lower East Side? If it was not used there, could
Harkavy have been familiar with the term 'Peruvian' in its South
African context? Or is it just included because the word was needed as
a qualifier to translate the then commonplace medicine 'Peruvian bark'-
quinine. And finally could the term 'Peruvian bark', a bitter medicine,
tie up with its meaning in a South African context?

Any comments, suggestions or explanations would be appreciated.

Subject: klore diburim

Leonard Prager's observations on Yiddish in Israel and coincidentally
on the status of Yiddish in general [TMR v6, no 7] are outstanding.  
While Tsanin -- with all due respect -- is choleric, swseeping, and
remarkably unsubtle (his articles appear regularly in the Yiddish
Forward, in Yidishe Kultur (which in fact is more a mirage than a
journal), and Undzer Tsayt, and while others conribute to the
existence of Yiddish by attacking -- without any serious arguments or
evidence -- those who dare say that Yiddish is slowly expiring as a
spoken language, and others cultivate small publications that feature
scarcely any contributions by people under the age of 80, and which
boast titles that are little more than pathetic exercises in
self-delusion (On the Threshold, The Beginning, the Future, Exelcior) ,
Leonard Praeger -- im tsu lange yor -- tells it like it is.  I find
this utterly refreshing.  As nearly) always, solid facts are preferable
to extravagant pretensions.  Indeed, if Yiddish is to survive in any
form whatsoeverl -- such as a subject of serious scholarship -- it will
come about only by speaking the truth rather than by engaging in
meretricious rhetoric.

And so -- thank you, Leonard Praeger.

Subject: pupik

There is an interesting discussion going on in some linguistics circles
about the meaning of 'pupik, pipik, pupek'.  By now, most people know
it's 'navel'. Where there is disagreement is which part of the chicken
it really refers to. Considering we know chickens don't have a need for
navels, there are different organs people say have that name.

Does any of you have the last word? At home, it used to be the stomach,
one of the things you find in the gizzards. Other people claim it's the
tail.

Help!!!
