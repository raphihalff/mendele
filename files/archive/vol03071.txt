Subject: Jerusalem1 and Philologus

I wrote to Jerusalem1 protesting the proposed new list when it was
announced and hope that my protest helped its subsequent quiet
demise.

I am either very angry or greatly chagrined that my fine detective
word in identifying Philologus without ever reading any of his
columns long before others CONFIRMED my sighting has been so quickly
forgotten.  From remarks made by others I homed in on the style of
H. Halkin which I do recognize.

Ah well, I am not a linguist and do not desrve to have identified
him.

To Reyzl Kalifowicz-Waletzky:

sholem aleykhem - i just finished reading your posting to mendele
where, inter alia, you wonder if your postings should be shorter.
let me just say that, as far as i'm concerned, zolstu lebn un gezunt
zayn [as my grandmother used to say] and continue to post whatever
is on your mind. i have enjoyed reading what you have chosen to
convey to the mendele audience and especially appreciate that you
discuss folklore, which has been rather ignored til now in that
medium.

Subject: Sukkos and Christmas

The discussions by Reyzl Kalifowicz-Waletzky (3.068) and Meylekh
Viswanath (3.070) on Christmas decorations in the sukka remind me of
a reverse situation I learned about at a symposium on Yugoslav Folk
Arts in 1976 at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh.  A Croatian
presenter was discussing a custom called 'cimer' (<Ger. Zimmer) from
Hrvatska Zagorje, north of Zagreb, where people do not erect a tree.
Rather, they suspend a lattice of wooden slats just below the
ceiling of their dining room, on which they place evergreens
decorated with flowers and fruit.  Sound familiar?  While the goyim
in the audience were saying, "Oh, how quaint," the Yidn were
exchanging knowing glances, having recognized this as a sukka
brought indoors due to the colder temperatures because they're doing
this three months late.  I went up to the lecturer after her
presentation to discuss this with her.  She was fascinated, since
she had never heard of a sukka.

I am forwarding (with permission) two personal responses I received last
week in reference to my posting about wreaths:

Dear Reyzl: I just read your message on Mendele regarding the
Christmas/ Succah decorations and found it very interesting.  I am a
silent sub- scriber to Mendele; frankly, electronic communication
still terrifies me - but - I have also thought about some of the
lovely wreath decorations (and even received a hand-made decorated
grape-vine wreath as a gift). However, I was unable to bring myself
to display it because I have always felt that wreaths were symbolic
of the "crown of thorns" that JC wore at his crucifixion, and
therefore, more of a religious symbol than an xmas tree or easter
egg.  So, even though a grapevine is a wonderful symbol for most of
the Jewish holidays; in the shape of a wreath I find it too potently
Christian.  On the Sukkah decorations side, this year at our
communal sukkah building one of the locals brought along some mylar
cut out fruits that were given to him by a visiting Israeli
professor as a Sukkot gift - they are apparently very popular as
Sukkah decorations in Israel.  And, a few years back another
visiting Israeli prof. was surprised to see some of the wooden toy
xmas tree decorations in the stores in December; he thought they
were Sukkah decorations this being the only context that he had ever
seen them in.  Perhaps what all of this goes to prove is that
somewhere there is a very wise marketing person  out there - finding
goods markets where none used to exist! Lorinda Weinstock

Reyzl --  Two comments about your latest postings in MENDELE:

(1) Whew! (He wipes his brow...)

(2) If those mylar Christmas decorations are indeed made in the
Orient, then would it not be more accurate (assuming they're _not_
made in the Philippines) to say that they're "produced by Buddhists
and Confucianists for Christians and haredi Jews"? Zay gezunt --
