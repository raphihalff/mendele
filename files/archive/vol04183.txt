Subject: A Shmu'es about "Yiddish is not hefker"

"Hefker" has no single equivalent word in English (4.160,1).  It connotes
property that does not belong to anyone and is terefore outside the
protection of the law.

It occurred to me that the two English words "public domain" convey _in
part_ the legal meaning of "hefker" under the following two conditions:

One:  When something never belonged to anyone and as such was in public
domain.  There is naturally one important restriction:  if a crop is in
public domain, for example, one cannot cut or garner it in a way to
damage an adjacent crop that has a known or even unknown owner.

Two:  When patents and copyrights granted by the government Patent Office
for inventions, manufacturing processes, literary works, lyrics, musical
compositions, etc., conferring exclusive rights of ownership, and said
patents and copyrights  expired after a specified number of years, all of
these guaranteed ownership rights become public domain.

Here, too, a significant restriction applies:  one may freely publish a
book that bore the symbol c (for copyright) when the copyright terms
expired, but cannot at will change the contents, let's say, the sequence
of chapters, or any other unauthorized emendations.  Heirs, or the
writer's estate, may still sue protecting the integrity of the work.

And now I come to the expression "Yiddish is not hefker."  Yiddish, as
any language, is in the public domain in the sense that it belongs to no
one in particular and in fact and truth _belongs_ to all, to the entire
people born and raised in its culture!  So how can it be said contradic-
torily that it is in the public domain and at the same time is not
hefker?

Fregt di velt an alte kashe.

The basic and only function of Yiddish, as of any other language, is to
facilitate communications in as plain, simple, direct, and clear way as
possible.  Any  communication, written or spoken, that does not meet
these self-evident conditions, fails the basic test of ready comprehen-
sion and does not live up to the basic and obvious purposes of language.

This definition may not necessarily apply to poetry or philosophical
treatises, which are on different levels of emotional and thinking
processes, but we are talking here about the most essential and basic
components of communications.

There are therefore centuries-old rules (laws) of grammar, syntax, and
usage that obligate the speaker or writer to adhere to for the sake of
the commonality of language.  And thus, not withstanding the fact that a
language is in the public domain, it is still _protected_ by the
established rules, or laws, that any self-respecting person is expected
to follow.

It is in this sense that I say Yiddish is not hefker.  It was given to us
_in trust_, and it behooves us all to treasure it.

Subject: Zamenhof and Yiddish

Dr. Ludwig Zamenhof, the famous inventor of Esperanto, which he
especially designed as an auxiliary universal language for better
international communications and understanding.  (It is  based on only
900 root words and has a simplified grammar of only sixteen rules.)

He was a serious and devoted "khoyveyv yidish" (lover of Yiddish), and
composed  _a yidishe gramatic_ (a Yiddish grammar) that was, however,
never published.

In an article about Yiddish he wrote, in 1909:  "Yiddish should not be
written at will, as it pleases one, but eynhaytlekh un rikhtik (uniform
and correct).  As the languages of even  Hottentots or the wild tribal
ihabitants of Australia have their strict and formulated grammatical
rules, so naturally has Yiddish.  Without these rules one Jew could not
possibly understand another Jew."

I found it curious that Zamenhof's advice concerning spelling is in some
degree similar to the correctives in my first posting on romanization
(4.102, Section g).  He suggested, among other stipulations, to  spell
"batsoln, zakhn"  (no silent /e's/), hant (not hand), got (no double
/t/).

Subject: Zellig Bach queries mashinke

In response to my intro, Sept. 20, Dr. Zellig Bach asked about my
Mishpokhe Yiddish classes in the Washington, D.C. area and if the 1st or
2nd syllable of my name was accented.  I answered him directly and he
said I should share my answer with the Mendele members.  I've updated it.

1. Thank you, Zeyde Zellig for your kind words about Mishpokhe Yiddish.
Our intention was to involve "di gantse mishpokhe," in passing Yiddish on
to young children.  And we generally do just that.  I had been a CO-OP
Nursery School Director/Teacher and thought I would just facilitate the
learning experience as "Zeyde/bobe" (the real teachers) passed their
"tayere yirushe" on to their "eyniklekh."  This has become the exception
rather than the rule. The capable Zeydes and Bobes are busy going on
Elderhostels and cruises.  Consequently I am learning Yiddish and
constantly searching for and making up appropriate material for "di zise
kinderlekh."

2. Why am I called "Ma'-shin-ke"? It is the diminutive form of Masha.

"Di libe Bobe Sore, Tate Menakhem Mendl,(fun Kovne), Mame Bella Leye, un
Tante Maynie, (a likhtikn gan eydem zoln zey hobn), hobn mir gerufn
Ma'-shin-ke," (accent on the first syllable).

Your first thought was correct. If my father were alive, he would,
however now call me Ma-shin'-ke with the stress on the 2nd syllable
because I'm strugling with and am finally using this wonderful machine.
How he would have loved the computer and Mendele!  "Ma'shinke iz itzt a
mashin'ke."  (diminutive of machine, as Dr Zellig Bach pointed out.) It
was a pleasure hearing from you.     "Zay gezunt," Mashinke

P.S.  Sunday, November 20, Mishpokhe Yiddish, sponsored by Yiddish of
Greater Washington and the Jewish Educational Workshop will be holding
another "Zoo-ish Jewish."  We'll meet with Miriam Isaacs, Yiddish
speaking neighbor of the Zoo, for an Intergenerational Yiddish tour at
the National Zoo, Connecticut Avenue in Washington, DC.  We will gather
in front of the elephant house (benches) at 11:30am. No charge for the
Yiddish tour; the park charges $4 per car for non FONZ members.  Call
"Bobe" Marcia at 301-933-3520 if you can join us and/or for information.

Subject: Hebraisms in Yiddish/Blondheim

I'm having some trouble locating an article about the frequency of
Hebraisms in Yiddish (women speakers).  The article is by D.S. Blondheim
and is, I think, in French.  If anyone knows the citation for this
article or can refer me to other articles about the same subject, I'd be
very grateful. a sheynem dank,
