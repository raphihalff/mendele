Subject: Curious example of word borrowing

In our house, Simone (my wife) and I use almost exclu-
sively English between ourselves.  (Periodically we
tell each other that we "should" use Yiddish, but it's
too easy to lapse into English.)

However, we use 100% Yiddish to the kids (aged 7, 5, 2
and 4 months). Because it's a 100% rule, there's no
lapsing into English. The result is that certain words
that we most often use with or relative to the kids
have migrated into our vocabulary between ourselves, to
the point where we rarely or never use the English
equivalent.  Examples:   We have to buy vindlekh.
     Put that on the balaygntish.
     Can you go get me a shpilke from the drawer,
please?

("Balaygn" is Simone's parents' [Stashiv, Poland] word
for change (a baby), so the balaygntish is the change-
table.  We use shpilke and gumme solely to mean things
that go in/on the kids' hair.  Though shpilke is,
technically, a pin, we use it to describe a plastic
hairclip.)

There are other words that are more or less half-and-
half -- when speaking English between ourselves, we'll
use "family room" and "mishpokhe-shtib" interchange-
ably.

I presume that it's simply that the more we use a word
with the kids, the more the Yiddish version of the word
becomes ingrained in our minds and thus comes to mind
when we're speaking English.

Comments from the linguists?

Just what is the difference in meaning between the
terms 'shviger/shviger mutter' and 'machetayneste'?
Although my Yiddish is very weak, it was inly spoken
when we were not to know what was going on, it was
always my understanding that 'shviger' for which I
don't know the masculine form was used for one's mother
in law, while 'machetayneste/machutin/machetunim' all
meant virtually any relative by marriage.  Would appre-
ciate some clarification.

In addition -- any suggestions for really good self-
study Yiddish programs?
