Subject: Bund Conference Announcement. 

Who was Vladimir Medem and what was his sanatorium?

Can you name the SKIF (children's Bund group) ten commandments?

Why did poet and activist Abraham Liessin get kicked out of the Volozhin
yeshiva and join the Bund?

What strategies did the Bund develop to counter unjust tenant eviction?

What role did the Bund play in the development of secular Jewish culture?

How can we move beyond the binarism of "death/dying" and "revival" of
socialism and Yiddish into a framework that highlights ongoing engagement
and interaction?

On March 1, 1998, Jews for Racial and Economic Justice, the YIVO Institute for
Jewish Research, and the Jewish Labor Bund will present a one-day conference,
In Gerangl: Activist Legacies of the Bund, exploring these and other questions
regarding the history of the Bund and its meanings for contemporary activists. 
The Bund was a mass organization most active in tsarist Russia and interwar
Poland that sought to transform the lives of the Jewish poor through socialist
organizing and secular Jewish culture.  The event will take place in the Great
Hall at Cooper Union, 7 East 7th Street (at Third Avenue) from noon-5pm. 

Preeminent activists, scholars, and writers on Bundist, Jewish and progressive
culture and politics will present at the conference. These speakers include
historians Paul Buhle, Gail Malmgreen, Jack Jacobs, and Daniel Soyer;
journalists Abraham Brumberg and Alisa Solomon; writers and activists Irena
Klepfisz and Melanie Kaye/Kantrowitz; and artists Gregg Bordowitz and Jenny
Romaine. 

The program will also include a performance directed by Obie-award winning
downtown theater artist Jenny Romaine, "Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Mitzvah,
or What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Show Like This?"  This documentary
spectacle which includes dance and live music asks what 100 years of
revolutionary struggle means to Jewish youth coming of age in the late
20th-century.  The piece features performances by members of the
KlezKamp/Living Traditions Youth Theater Workshop. 

A 10am tour of "The Story of the Jewish Labor Bund, 1897-1997," a YIVO
Archives-curated exhibition of photographs, documents, and posters on display
at the Bronfman Center for Jewish Student Life at New York University (7 East
10th Street) will kick off the conference.  YIVO Chief Archivist and exhibit
curator Marek Web will lead the tour.  Admission to both the exhibition,which
runs through March 1, 1998 and the conference is free of charge. 

The conference is the final in a series of local events, fun dor tsu dor/From
Generation to Generation: A Celebration of the 100th Anniversary of the Jewish
Labor Bund, which included the exhibition at the Bronfman Center and a concert
of Yiddish labor songs.  Held on January 25, 1998 before an audience of more
than 750 people, the concert, "In Love and in Struggle: the Musical Legacy of
the Bund," featured the leading interpreter of Yiddish song Adrienne Cooper,
composer Zalmen Mlotek, and 65 members of two Yiddish chorales.

Subject: "God Hid His Face", a book of poems translated from Yiddish

A new book of poems translated from Yiddish - "God Hid His Face" by Rajzel
Zychlinsky, has recently been published. It consists of English translations
of this writer's Yiddish poems which appeared in previous books and in Yiddish
newspapers such as the Forward. 

Many of the poems have a Holocaust theme. Other poems concern daily life in a
transcendent fashion:  "associations and images that take intellectual leaps
and lead us from reality to illusion, and from illusion to a higher, more
essential reality" - Yitzhok Yanosovitch. 

The translators are Dr. Barnett Zumoff, Aaron Kramer, and myself, her son. 
The introductory essay is by Dr. Emanuel Goldsmith, Professor of Yiddish
Language and Literature at Queens College in New York. The title poem (in
Yiddish and English versions) and a short review can be found in the back page
of DER BAY, the February 98 issue. (This is a review of events of interest to
the Yiddish community published in San Mateo, California by Philip "Fishl" 
Kutner, e-mail fishl@well.com.) 

The celebrated poet Itzik Manger used to think very highly Zychlinsky's work
and she received the Itzik Manger prize in Israel in 1975. 

The book is published by Word&Quill Press (707-538-9259). ISBN 0-96-58640-0-6.

details contact the YIVO librarian, Zachary Baker, who will return from
vacation in a week.

English:
Mixing German into Yiddish, or writing Germanized Yiddish won't do.  It sounds
clumsy and weak.  However, the problem is not with the German language itself.
Evidence:

On page 6, Jonathan Kaufman in his book, A Hole in the Heart of the World (New
York: Viking, 1997), writes as follows:
        In reunited Germany scholars held conferences on "Why Germany Lacks a Sense
of Humor," which droned on for days before acknowledging that a main reason
was that most of Germany's great satirists and comedians before World War II
were Jews.

Surely, Jewish writers in Germany wrote their satires, jokes and material for
comedians in German with great success.  The German language is very well
suited for such work.  However, for such works arrogance won't do.  What are
needed are respect for people and sympathy for human feelings.  Arrogance
drives out humane sensitivity.  The best Yiddish writers wrote a Yiddish
permeated with Jewish sensitivity.  German triggers memories of arrogant
people for me.  Perhaps, here lies a reason why Germanized Yiddish won't do.

I can't resist indulging in a speculation.  What a great sketch Mel Brooks
could write on the premise of a conference entitled: "Why Germany Lacks a
Sense of Humor."  In fact, I suspect Gilbert and Sullivan could have had fun
with it.

Subject: Dos Koshmar-Lid in the Yiddish _Forverts_

The current edition of the Yiddish _Forverts_ (Friday, Feb. 6, 1998) has an
almost complete text of my Yiddish version of the Nightmare Song from Gilbert
& Sullivan's "Iolanthe."  Its Yiddish title is _Dos Koshmar-Lid_ and it
appears on page 15 under the headline _Gilbert un Solivan oyf yidish_.  I say
"an almost complete text" because the _Forverts_ didn't have room for my
Yiddish rendition of these rapid-fire final lines of W.S.Gilbert's tour de
force: 

You're a regular wreck, with a crick in your neck, and no wonder you snore,
for your head's on the floor, and you've needles and pins from your soles to
your shins, and your flesh is a-creep, for your left leg's asleep, and you've
cramp in your toes, and a fly on your nose, and some fluff in your lung, and a
feverish tongue, and a thirst that's intense, and a general sense that you
haven't been sleeping in clover;  But the darkness has passed, and it's
daylight at last, and the night has been long--ditto ditto my song--and thank
goodness they're both of them over! 

These are the missing lines:

 Oy der kop tut mir vey, un ikh gib a geshrey, di hent zaynen mir kalt, un der
kop mayner shpalt! s'iz mir trukn dos moyl, un ikh shray "Shma Yisroyl!" ikh
bin nas mit a shveys, un mayn kerper iz heys, in di oygn, oy! brent, un es
tsitern di hent, bald a flig flit arum, un di kishn iz krum, un ikh zog "Oy a
klog!"  vayl s'iz klor vi di tog az ikh hob nit gants ruig geshlofn. - Shoyn
di nakht iz farbay, fun mayn shlof bin ikh fray, oy di nakht iz tsu lang --
shoyn genug mayn gezang -- danken Got az di oygn zaynen ofn!

But all is not lost - for just last week (Jan. 30) the English edition of the
_Forward_ published that very section of the Nightmare Song both in English
and in Yiddish in their weekly column called _Der Yiddish-Vinkl_ on page 4.
(Incidentally, shouldn't that be _Der yidish-vinkl_ ?)  Anyway - putting both
columns together brings the Nightmare Song to completion.

One final note:  The Yiddish _Forverts_ neglected to include a by-line giving
credit to Chana Mlotek for the informative introduction which she wrote for
_Dos Koshmar-Lid_.

Subject: Self-introduction and Yiddish braille

My name is Vivian Aldridge (one of those instances where Vivian is a boys'
name). I am a non-Jew from Britain but I now live in Switzerland. Although I
am very interested in Yiddish and read a lot - literature and newspapers - and
listen to tapes and CDs I have almost no practice in writing and speaking it
as I have no teacher and no conversation partners. 

I work with visually-impaired people and have a great interest in braille
which stretches back into my childhood For me it is natural that I should want
to know exactly how Yiddish is written in braille. I have Hebrew alphabets and
have managed to find answers to some of my questions regarding them (for
instance, that in braille pey and fey are always differentiated even if they
aren't in the original print), but I have never seen anything for Yiddish.
Does anyone know if there is anywhere that produces Yiddish in braille or can
anyone supply me with any other information?
