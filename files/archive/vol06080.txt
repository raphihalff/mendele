Subject: Introduction

Shalom - I am an "old" graduate of the Peretz School in Winnipeg,
Manitoba and a recent subscriber to Mendele (which I greatly enjoy). I
would love to hear from other Peretz School graduates, and to get some
general feedback, and perhaps some optimistic predictions, as to what
the fate is and may be of Jewish Schools on an elementary level across
America and Canada. I was pleased to read about the program in Boston
(Family Yiddish Class); but - Ikh vunder oyb in nit-zeyer-vaytn tsukumft
veln shoyn nit zayn shuln velkhe lernen yidish. Ich voyn in Israel
iber 30 yor, ober ikh bin gebliben mit mayn yidish, und mayn yidish
iz gebliben mit mir. Ikh bin gor tsufriden mit di Mendelniks, alt und
yung, und ich leyen vegn yungere grupes velkhe lernen haynt yidish.
Ober merstentayl zey ikh az yidish lernt men in universitetn; oder
makh ich a to'es? Halevay! Als eyne vos lebt lange yor in Israel,
vemens kinder und eyniklekh redn nit yidish, ken ikh nisht hobn
taynes vegn lage fun yidish lernen in "Chutz Learetz". Ikh vays az
men lernt ivrit, und ikh bin derbay tsufridn; ober mame loshn, hof ikh,
vet nit farloren vern. Zogt mir, iz mayn hofenung a kholem tzi iz es
virklikhe meglekhkeit? Di "eltere" yidish-redner fun haynt darfn dokh
hobn a yungern dor, andersh fun vanen vet der hemshekh kumen? A dank
tzu Noyekh, und tzu alle Mendel leyner und shrayber.

Subject: Af and oyf

Commenting on my post " 'Af' the correct romanization" (6.074,4), a
friend from Australia writes: "The standard pronunciation in Melbourne
is in fact "oyf".

According to David L. Gold, famous Yiddish linguist, the current
dialectal pronunciations of "oyf" are /af/, /of/, /auf/, and -- only in
a few varieties of Eastern Yiddish -- /oyf/.  "Of these [several]
pronunciation forms /_af_/ has been selected for standardization in
today's Eastern Yiddish"  (_Jewish Language Review_, Vol. 3, 1983, p.
371).

The "oyf" pronunciation, while not necessarily standard in klal Yiddish,
is still standard in some areas, and is by no means substandard. This
spelling pronunciation (that is, pronounced as spelled) is quite
widespread among non-native speakers, students of Yiddish, and people
who aim to speak "correctly."

My suggestion was _not_ that speakers of Yiddish change the way they
pronounce the preposition "oyf," but that, when _romanizing_ it, it
should be spelled /"af"/, as it has been selected for standardization of
today's Eastern Yiddish.

Subject: zamenhof's 'dream' language

the following was posted on the linguist list. i repeat it here for
general interest and also ask if anyone has ever heard of this anecdote
and, if so, knows what language zamenhof was dreaming in. yiddish,
perchance?

also, i've always heard that zamenhof was a native yiddish speaker. does
anyone have a reference for this? thanks.

      Subject:  language in dreams

      I thought that the recent postings on the topic of language in dreams
      had pretty much covered the range of phenomena in existence on this
      topic, but it appears that I was wrong.  I was recently browsing
      through a biography of Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, called
      "L'homme qui a de'fie' Babel"(the man who defied Babel) by Rene'
      Centassi and Henri Masson, when i came across an account of a dream
      which Zamenhof had, apparently at the age of about 16.  That would
      have been more than 10 years before 1887, usually considered the
      birthyear of the language, when his first grammar of Esperanto was
      published.  He at that time was concerned with the question of whether
      his language should have a definite article, having noticed that his
      own Polish, and also Russian (presumably the prestige language of that
      time and place, since Zamenhof lived in Bialystok, then part of the
      Russian Empire), did not.  In the dream he was pondering this question
      near a forest with his uncle Jozef and his Greek teacher, whose name
      was Billevitch.  Zamenhof suggested that they might find someone in
      the forest who could help them. Billevitch, on the contrary, warned
      against going into the forest on the grounds that there were three
      girls in red who wanted to harm them.  Zamenhof then looked toward the
      forest, saw the girls in question, and cried out, "there are
      - -the-(author's emphasis) three girls in red."  Zamenhof then woke up
      in a sweat, but decided that his problem had been solved.  The
      definite article had in his view proved its usefulness.  And, as every
      Esperantist knows, there is a definite article, namely the invariable
      "la".

      I can't remember having or hearing about a dream with this degree of
      linguistic specificity.  It is also not clear what language the dream
      occurred in.  Probably not Polish or Russian, since these lack the
      article which played such a prominent role. Zamenhof knew several
      other languages, most of them with definite articles, so these appear
      to be better candidates.  In any case, postings from others suggest
      that people can dream in languages that they don't know very well.
      The last possibility is that the language was some embryonic form of
      Esperanto itself, since Zamenhof was so intensely concerned with this
      topic.

Subject: "Computer virus" of yidish

(Re: R. Zellig Bach's post in Mendele vol. 6.078)

Strictly speaking, a shed is spirit "out there," more in the business of
damaging and hurting than taking possession;  I propose that we instead
call a computer virus a "dibbik"--it takes over a computer, much as a
dibbik takes over a person's body.
