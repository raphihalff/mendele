Subject: YIVO/Columbia Summer Yiddish Program

Applications are now being accepted for the Uriel Weinreich Program in
Yiddish Language, Literature and Culture, which will take place on the
Columbia University campus from June 26 to August 4, 2000.  The program,
jointly sponsored by the Max Weinreich Center of the YIVO Institute for
Jewish Research and Columbia University, is a six-week, non-matriculating,
three-credit college course offered on four levels: elementary, intermediate
I, intermediate II and advanced.  The program proper will be preceded by an
optional two-week review session for intermediate and advanced students
beginning on June 13.  Elementary students with no reading or writing
knowledge of the Yiddish alphabet are required to attend a one-day reading
and writing workshop on Sunday, June 25.
        
People worldwide have discovered the importance of Yiddish as a key to
understanding a significant component of the Jewish heritage.  Every summer
since 1968, several dozen people from diverse backgrounds, professional
pursuits and places as far-ranging as Argentina, Australia, Chile, China,
Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Lithuania, Poland, Russia and
Slovakia make their way to New York City to study Yiddish in the world's
first and most acclaimed, college-level Yiddish-language program.
        
Many summer program students have gone on to become fellows of the Max
Weinreich Center, an accredited institute for advanced study of East
European and American Jewish history and culture.  Others have entered
graduate programs in Jewish studies offered by major universities throughout
North America, Europe and Israel.  The program has thus served as an
essential stepping stone in the careers of such prominent scholars in the
field of Yiddish as Janet Hadda, Irena Klepfisz, Jack Kugelmass and Michael
Stanislawski.
        
Participants in the program not only learn the fundamentals of Yiddish
grammar and read Yiddish literary classics, but also explore the riches of
East European and American Jewish culture through lectures in Yiddish and
English, Yiddish films, Yiddish conversation groups and a variety of
workshops in translation, theater, folksong and traditional dance.
        
As a means of expanding the opportunities for verbal practice and creating a
feeling of camaraderie, out-of-towners are given the option of staying in
single rooms in Yidish-hoyz, a Yiddish dormitory suite on campus. Excursions
to Jewish points of interest in and outside of New York City add depth and
immediacy to subjects covered in the classroom. Dr. Rheins, YIVO's Executive
Director, has called the program "an intensive, intellectually stimulating
experience, whose rewards remain throughout one's lifetime."
        
For an application including information on housing and partial
scholarships, call, fax or write to Yankl Salant, Director of Yiddish
Language Programs, YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, 15 West 16th Street,
New York, NY 10011, (212) 294-6138, fax (212) 292-1892, e-mail

Annual Symposium for Yiddish Studies in Germany
28-30 August 2000

The third Annual Symposium for Yiddish Studies in Germany will take place
from 28 to 30 August 2000 at the Heinrich Heine University in Duesseldorf.
With this symposium both programs in Yiddish Studies in Germany continue
their combined effort to offer a forum for scholars and students of Yiddish
where they can present their research and exchange ideas. Scholars and
students from Germany and abroad are invited to attend and take part. Those
who would like to present a paper (in Yiddish or German) should send an
abstract to the organizers.

We will post more detailed and regularly updated information on the internet
(http://www.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/jiddisch/). We will also be happy to
answer questions by fax (0211-81-12027) or e-mail
(jiddisch@phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de). Participants can register at the
addresses below. There is no conference fee.

Subject: Stencl and Manger 

In response to Ross Bradshaw's request for details of AN Stencl's poetry in
English translation and information about Itsik Manger's years in London:

First, just in case modesty overcomes him, let me point the way to Leonard
Prager's wonderful " Yiddish Culture in Britain - a Guide"  (Frankfurt am
Main, 1990), with detailed entries on both writers.  On Manger in London, I
particularly recommend one book mentioned there: Dan Davin's "Closing Times"
(London 1975).  In addition:

Stencl was famously/notoriously a militant Yiddishist, and I suspect was
little concerned with seeing his poems in English translation.  However the
critic and translator Joseph Leftwich was a strong admirer of his work and
included a number of Stencl's poems in his anthology of Yiddish verse in
translation entitled "The Golden Peacock" (London 1939).

Decades later, Leftwich compiled "An Anthology of Modern Yiddish Literature"
(The Hague, 1974) which contains a small selection of poems by both Stencl
and Manger, again in Leftwich's own translations.

Leftwich also knew Manger well during his years in London from 1940 until
1951. See his article "Margaret Waterhouse's role in the Mangeriade" (Jewish
Quarterly, Summer 1980), where he pays tribute to the woman who befriended
Manger in London.  According to Leftwich:

"It was in Margaret's bookshop in Swiss Cottage that Manger first met Arthur
Waley and Dylan Thomas.  "He can drink" Manger said to me about Dylan
Thomas.  "But I am the better poet".  "

There is also a generous selection of Manger's verse in the bilingual
anthology "The Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse" edited by Howe, Wisse
and Shmeruk.

Finally, Mendele readers might be interested in a remarkable (and
unpublished) letter in my possession, written by Manger in London to my
great-grandfather Sholem Asch in the United States on 11 March 1950.  
(Manger wrote in English, presumably because of continuing censorship
regulations).  The full letter is as follows:

"My Dear Master,

I remember our short meeting in London, and remember your proposal that you
are ready to edit a selection of my poems on your account, because, as you
told me "That is that" I understood that you mean real poetry.

Now, I don't want your personal money for the publishing of a book of mine,
but next year in May I am 50 years old; looking round me there is an
emptyness for which even Edgar Allen Poe would really get mad, not drunk.

I am afraid of that emptyness, and because of my fear I decided to celebrate
the 50 years, shall they come, the great, the heavyweights, the small, the
tiny, the beauties, and the ugly, the Madonnas, and the prostitutes, and
tell me, on the 28th of May....

'You are 50, what have you done in your life, apart of being a parasite, did
you build a house? Did you build a home? Did you build up a business? A
butchery, a solicitor's business? A synagogue? A Church? A Brothel?'

All essentials of life, but I have not done any of these things; with my
coming 50 years, I stand barren for myself, for my people and for the world.  
Apart from my dreams, and these are the hieroglypths of my poems, so simple,
they are that everybody understands them, even in that accursed language in
which I wrote them, they are so clear that I do not understand myself.

My dear Master, in starting my letter to you I feel that I run away from the
essentials, but it does not matter.  Would you like to take part in that
masquerade and that tomfoolery that next year will be called 'The Jubilee of
Itzik Mangers 50 years'? If you like to do it you are invited for a Foxtrot
between New York and London, or maybe, between New York and Jerusalem, and I
am ready to dance with you that Foxtrot, cross my heart.

Please inform me as to your attitude to this proposal, as soon as possible,
to the address on the other side.

Yours sincerely, Itzik Manger " 

(I've no idea whether Asch accepted Manger's invitation, or whether there
was any sort of public celebration of Manger's 50th birthday along the lines
of the largescale festivities marking Asch's own 50th jubilee.  Certainly,
Asch and Manger knew each other well in London, and later in the US and
Israel).
 
David Mazower    

[Moderator's note: Jacob Sonntag's translations of three Stencl's poems
("Below in the shadow of the deep-dark valley...", On My 80th Birthday, and
To Josef Herman) were published in Jewish Perspectives, London: Secker &
Warburg, 1980.                                                 - i.v.]

Subject: 'bomtziktzak' and 'klappteler'

Yale Strom wonders about 'bomtziktzak'  and 'klappteler.'  I would venture a 
guess that 'klappteler' is a tambourine; the other probably is a drum. At 
least the word is onomatopoeic and mimics drum-beats.

Subject: zhivitse-boym??

Dear Mendelistn,

I'm trying to identify a tree mentioned in a poem written in Palestine --
all I have to go on is this line, "der zhivitse-boym shmekt."  I've found a
"zhibyets" plant in a Russian dictionary, but the information on this plant
doesn't fit the context of the poem.  Any suggestions?

A hartsign dank foroys,

Yael Chaver

Subject: Latinization of Yiddish

Dear readers,

I'm working on a dissertation chapter on Soviet Yiddish language reform and
am writing a section on Latinization attempts.  In some of my research, one
Soviet linguist mentions two single-issue Yiddish journals that had come
out in Latin letters, "Unser Shrift (NY, 1912)" and "Unhojb (Vilna, 1923"
Does anyone have any information on these journals?  My research, thus far,
has not turned up much useful information.

Thank you,
David Shneer

From: "mikhl herzog" <mherzog@bestweb.net>
Subject: 1) khoyzek 2) 'currants'

Leslie Reich (9:062) asks about the derivation of 'Choizek' (khoyzek).  At
best, it is NOT of Hebrew origin, although it is spelled as if it were. It
is among the words we might designate as "Hebreoid". I can't confirm my
source for this, although I've tried. I believe the word has a North German
origin and may be attested somewhere in Max Weinreich's _Geshikhte fun der
yidisher shprakh_. My copy of the English translation (the version with an
Index) has mysteriously disappeared. If anyone can find the source, I'd be
grateful.

Shaya Mitelman (9:062) is quite right: _porets(h)kes_ (also, variously
stressed _po'zhetskes_ and _pozhe'tskes_) are 'currants', NOT 'peaches'!  
(Not to be confused with _po'zhemkes_ 'wild strawberries'.)

Mikhl Herzog

p.s. Since my earlier message, my copy of Weinreich's _Geshikhte_ has turned
up, complete with 3 references to _khoyzek_, but NONE to its origin.

I should say, of my own suggestion that the word is of North German origin,
that its initial consonant [kh-] would preclude a German etymon.  However,
my still vague recollection is of an etymon in itial [h]. Can anyone help?

M. H.
