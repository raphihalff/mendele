[Version of _shoyshanes-yankev_ as sung in my family.  The
song is very popular, but most people don't know the second
Yiddish verse.  To my knowledge, sung in Polish as well
("Hop mojej ricieniki" <spelling?>) and Ukrainian but not
referring specifically to homen-tashn.  (Non-Yiddish
versions sung only by Jews?  Only on Purim?)]

The following ad appeared in the yawningly staid publicity
put out in last Sept .-October's edition of the
Harrassowitz Book Digest.

 Paul Wexler The Schizoid Nature of Modern Hebrew: A Slavic
 Language in Search of a Semitic Past


(Mediterranean Language and Culture Monograph Series 4.)

(ISBN 3-447-03063-1). DM 64,-


Modern Hebrew is not a direct continuation of monolingual
Semitic Hebrew, but a dialect of Yiddish. Contrary to
popular conception, Yiddish is a Slavic language (derived
from Sorbian); thus Modern Hebrew is a Slavic language.

Agreed.

What I find interesting is that, in telling a story in
Yiddish, references to "a yid" are commonplace.  They don't
always even emphasize the Jewishness of the person referred
to; it's just another way of saying what in English would
be "a guy". But to tell the same story in English and say
"a Jew" comes across as awkward or even offensive.

I agree with this in general, and with some of the points
made in subsequent articles.   I think I would take issue
with this, however:

To Noyekh and Dovid, I say:

Do you two think this flew past the true Mendele crew,
without giving to them their due, too?  You do rue that
claim.  Chew on that.  Nu?

'Nuff said.

I'd like to get more information about these
dual-vocabulary situations.  I don't understand many of the
distinctions above (i.e., exactly what the difference is
between shtarbn and peygern, for, for that matter, niftr
zayn).  Can someone start a list (based on the above), with
English translations and explanations as necessary, that we
might collectively expand on?  This is a fascinating topic.

I can think of a couple of others: shmadn/mgayer zayn
(convert from/to Judaism); and bukh/sefer (the latter
referring to a religious book; are the terms mutually
exclusive, or is sefer a subset of bukh?).
