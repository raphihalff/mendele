Subject: Arbeter Ring in London during 1938-1946

I am researching the reactions of the Yiddish speaking community in London's
East End to the persecutions of the Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe during the
years 1938-1946.

Part of my work invvolves the Arber Ring with its HQ at 22 Alie Street, E1.
I know it also ran a Weltliche Schule on Sunday afternoons.  Would any of
your readers know where I can find records of this (aprt from in the Arber
Ring Minutes which I have).  Isaac Nathani was one of the teachers.

Also, does anyone know about Solomon Joseph, a member who committed suicide
in 1940 - he had been involved with the Leeds Hostel for Jewish refugees.

Also Baruch (Barnett) Weinberg who ran a printing business in Brick Lane. -
indeed any of the other members of the Ring.  So far, I have only managed to
find the descendants of one member, Isaac Goluchovsky (surname changed later
to Gollow).

Many thanks in anticipation!

Subject: introduction

Dear Mendelyaner,

I am new on the list (or actually subscribed again after some time of
absence). I would briefly like to introduce myself. I studied History and
Yiddish Studies and I am currently doing my PhD at the European University
Institute in Florence. I am in the very early stages of the project and
started in september 2003. My PhD project is entitled "Jews and communism: a
case study of Jewish volunteers in the Spanish Civil War and the formation
of the Jewish Botwin company". The project aims to study the question how
Jewish communists in the 30s dealt with issues of identity by using the
particapation of volunteers of Jewish descent in the SCW as a case study.
The project aims to be comparative: I will focus on the way the Yiddish
newspaper of the French communist party, Naye Prese, reported on Spain and
the Jewish volunteers that fought there. By contrast I will also analyze a
Yiddish Bundist newspaper.

Regarding the latter I would like to pose a question. I am currently in the
process of choosing a Bundist newspaper that would be suitable to use in the
comparison. I have thought of taking Naye Folkstsaytung, but to keep the
units of comparison somewhat more equal, a Bundist newspaper from Paris
would be ideal. I have tried to investigate the existence of such a
newspaper but have not found one yet. I would sincerely appreciate any
suggestion people might have on this or more in general. I should point out
that I have previously written an MA thesis on the topic of Jewish
volunteers in Spain. I am, however, relatively new in the field of 'Yiddish
press studies'.

With kind regards,
Gerben Zaagsma

Subject: Rekude Potash

I am writing in reference to a photograph of a Jewish writer named Rekude
Potash that I found on your website. My name is Benjamin Potash and the
woman in the picture bears an uncanny resemblence to several members of my
family. I was wondering if you had any information about this woman or knew
of any sources where I could find information.

Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you.

Subject: Looking for a story

Tayere Mendelyaners,

Ikh zukh a mayse, "Der yid vos hot khorev gemakht dem temple." Ikh gedenk
nisht ver hot zi geshribn un in vosere bukh me ken zi gefinen. Di mayse iz
vegn a yid, an imigrant, vos kumt in a kleyn shtetl in di ketskils. Er ken
nisht zitsn shtil in dem temple vi di asimilirte amerikanishe yidn, un
daven't in a hoykhn kol. Di amerikaners ken nisht zikh haltn fun davenen
azoy vi er, un,  oys temple,  s'iz gevoren a shul.

Oyb ir veyst, zayt azoy gut un shraybt mir tsurik.

I'm searching for a story, "The Jew who Destroyed the Temple."  I don't
remember who wrote it or in which book it can be found.  The story is about
an immigrant Jew who comes to a small town in the Catskills.  He is not used
to the decorum of an American Jewish Temple and starts davening in the old
country style.  Soon the other congregants, who've been trying to be
assimilated into American ways, cannot resist following his example.  No
more "Temple," it's been transformed into a "shul."

If you know, please write to me.

Zayt gezunt,

Yosl (Joe) Kurland

Subject: vos heyst 'a mentsh'?

'Mentsh' is getting a lot of play these days. A non-Jewish friend asked me
to comment on his young Jewish colleague's definition.  A mentsh, he said,
was 'a cool guy'.  I told him what I thought. But the question kicked off a
couple of new questions in my own mind.

1.  vos heyst take 'a mentsh'? 2.  fun vanet nemt zikh der bagrif un vi alt
iz es?

As for the first, my answer is that of my generation: a mentsh is someone
who acts justly and is compassionate and kind toward everyone without
further distinction.  To be a mentsh is to possess a degree of moral
integrity that most of us aren't blessed with, and mentshn therefore are
considerably less numerous than cool guys.

On the face of it, a mentsh sounds something like the 19th C. English
gentleman.  And I confess that I began with the speculation that the very
notion of mentsh owes much to the literature of the Enlightenment (of which
Lessing's "Nathan der Weise" is a prominent example), to the Jewish Haskole,
to growing awareness of codes of civility and manners as practiced by
various European elites.

Plausible enough. ober mit yidn iz keyedue a zakh zeltn poshet, un do oykh
iz der emes punkt farkert. Who, for instance, is the best-known mentsh in
Yiddish literature?  None other than our beloved Tevye.   And maybe the
Nemirover rebe in Peretz's "oyb nisht nokh hekher".  What have these men in
common, class aside, with such a gentleman as Jane Austen's Mr. Knightley?
Where the latter acts at all times in accordance with a rigid code of
behavior appropriate to his station, Tevye and the Nemirover act in
accordance with the dictates of their characters.  The mentsh, on this
reading, is an instance of David Riesman's famous "inner-directed" man who
follows his equally famous internal gyroscope.  The Baal Shem Tov  was
clearly such a mentsh.  So unquestionably was Levi Yitzkhok Berditchever.
But not, interestingly enough, their contemporary the Vilner Gaon, nor for
that matter the great scholars of that time, and for a simple reason: the
Jewish mandarin class was recruited at an early age and so cossetted, nursed
and shielded throughout their lives that most were barely adult, let alone
in touch with the real world.   The mentsh acts in the real world.

Beskhakl, I learn from this that the notion of mentsh is not derivative,
that it is Jewish to the core.  I think of the prophet Nathan who faced down
the ignoble king David; I think of Boaz. Finally, I learn that beyond Jewish
it is human to the core, for proof of which I give you the biblical Noyekh
(no relation) as well as Mark Twain's Jim and his friend Huckleberry Finn.
You might even add Rumpole of the Bailey.

It may not be surprising, having brought up our children in various suburban
shmaltsgriber, that they share the pallid suburban notion that a mentsh is a
cool guy; but it's sad.

Noyekh Miller
