Subject: Lezn/Yiddish tish

Harkavy says that the past participle of lezn is gelezn.

In the useful posting about Yiddish cultural activities everywhere,
the Yiddish tish of the Center for Judaic Studies at The University
of Connecticut was said to meet Wednesday noon. We do not meet EVERY
week but rather twice a month. The next meeting is to be Wednesday
Dec. 8th.

Subject: spelling

Problem is, we are not just speaking of spelling.  We are really
talking about transliteration.  Thus the funny English spelling
doesn't really apply as an example of what happens when you do not
adhere to the standard.  I have had a fair amount of discussion with
one of our fellow Mendelniks (who is no doubt smirking at his
terminal) about the "spelling" of a rude Yiddish word which starts
with shin.

Because of my German academic background, I transliterate shin as
"sch."  Our colleague (he knows who he is) is a native speaker of
German, but he takes me to task for using "sch" instead of "sh."  So
what's the big deal?  If we were using Hebrew characters then we
could argue about spelling.  As it is, we are trying to approximate
the pronunciation of the Hebrew/Yiddish alphabet.  What is written
in transliteration is not the real language.  So why argue?

I wonder if this sort of discussion happens involving Russian or
Chinese.

Subject: No female equivalent for "reb"

First let me just say that I've been reading Mendele for almost a
year now and I enjoy seeing Yiddish in use.

My grandfather, originally from Kalish, Poland, says that there is
no female equivalent to the word "reb".  In Europe, men would be
called to the Torah as "Reb Yaakov ben Reb Moshe" rather than the
general American custom, "Yaakov ben Moshe" as a matter of respect.

"Rebetzin" might be considered the feminine for "Reb," except that
we understand that to mean the wife of a rabbi.  In Poland,
"Rebetzin" meant the wife of a Rav, not any ordinary rabbi.

Subject: Leyenen un lezn

_leyenen_ (or rather: _layen_) and _lezn_ can also be found in
Western Yiddish in the 16th and 17th century and beyond (and
probably earlier). The usage is very much the same as in modern
Eastern Yiddish: _lezn_ for books and _leyenen_ either exclusively
for the reading of the law in shul or that and the reading of
religious texts. I think that _leyenen_ was most often reserved for
the balkoyre, but in future I will pay more attention to its use.
Nowadays, Dutch Jews use _layenen_ exclusively for the reading aloud
of Torah in synagogue.

In these older texts, the past participle of _lezn_ is often
_gelezt_, but one also finds _gelezn_.

Subject: Starting with a verb

Zogt Hershl Berman:

        You cannot start off with the verb on its own.  It's all in
        Weinreich.

Years ago at a meeting of professional philosophers someone declared
that while there are double negatives in English (no no) there were
no double positives.  Upon which Sidney Morgenbesser from the back
of the room sang out: yeah yeah.

Since I'm not a linguist, what follows is probably irresponsible in
the extreme and I expect (gently?) chiding notes from my linguist
friends for this caper.  Nevertheless, here are the lines of two
popular Yiddish songs:

        1. Gey ikh mir shpatsirn, tralalalalala..
        2. Geyt a Id in beys-medresh arayn.

Not to mention the familiar opening line of the Yiddish writer we
honor: "Omar Mendele Moykher Sforim (Zogt Mendele..)".

Or for that matter the opening line of this message.

So what am I missing?
