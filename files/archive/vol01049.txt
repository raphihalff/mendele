(via dave sherman)

1.  Is _yenta_ truly from Latin _gentilis_?  If so, how
did it become feminine, why does it mean what it does
(rather than 'Gentile woman'), and how come people
don't use it instead of _shiksa_, which I consider
offensive?
 
reply:
shiksa is definitely offensive, though perhaps not as
much as masc. sheygets; both of them derive from
shekets (heb.) which I believe means (loosely) creepy-
crawly creatures.  In one of my gemore shiurim we use
goyeh instead.  I am not quite sure if this exists in
yiddish or in modern hebrew but it certainly does in
gemore loshn.

Subject: RE: Europe and Jews

        My comments are far afield from the original
discussion on the difficulty of doing research on
Yiddish among xasidim in Amsterdam or Brussels. Howev-
er, Florian Brody's comments on when does one say one
is a Jew reminded me of the affecting video-tape by
Pier Marton, "Say I Am A Jew," where he, originally
from France and the child of a Holocaust survivor,
interviews other such young people now in the United
States about the difficulty or ease with which they can
say "I am a Jew." His videotape elicits some of the
difference experienced between Europe and the U.S. I
have the information on availability of the videotape,
to anyone who makes an e-mail query.         The one
book by Peter Sichrovsky that is listed in the on-line
Library catalog here is _Schuldig geboren_. English.
_Born Guilty: Children of Nazi Families_. New York:
Basic Books, 1988. Since we have at least one course on
the Holocaust, I will ask the library to order the
other of Sichrovsky's books.

with all due respect, i would rethink the hypothesis
that your mother was 'as nonracist as you can possibly
be' (at least following the current usage of 'racist'
as a synonym of 'bigoted').

this is getting further and further from yiddish, but i
feel obliged to  clarify my last msg. the anecdote i
recounted concerning the use of 'juif' vs. 'israelite'
in france had NOTHING to do with whether or not to
disclose one's judaism. this was in bordeaux in 1962
and there was simply no issue.  i was the tenth ameri-
can student this (non-jewish) family had hosted and the
sixth jew. the closest thing to a problem arose when
they announced to me the first friday morning i was
there that synagogue services begin at such-and-such
time and they would take me--and i had to explain that
i was not a synagogue-goer! since then i have made over
20 trips to france, as  well as assorted trips to most
of the rest of western europe, and have never experi-
enced even the anti-semitism i knew as a child growing
up in brooklyn. and my one trip to germany was paid for
by the research center in bielefeld (zif, i think it's
called), where i gave a lecture on some discourse
properties of yiddish. so maybe things ain't so terri-
ble...

yes, of course, i'm aware of anti-semitic right-wing
groups in europe and desecrations of jewish sites, etc.
but synagogues have been defaced in philadelphia in the
past three years and the cemetery in new york where my
father-in-law is buried was vandalized and desecrated
two years ago. my main point is that i don't really
think there's a justification for making a big distinc-
tion between the u.s. and europe in this domain.
