Subject: Yiddish at Historical Linguistics Conference

Those readers of Mendele who are engaged in research in historical linguistics
may be interested in the 13th International Conference of Historical
Linguistics which will be held at the Heinrich Heine University in
Duesseldorf, Germany, 10 - 17 August 1997.

One of the special topic areas will be *The development of Yiddish as a
contact language*. Professor Marvin (Mikhl) Herzog of Columbia University will
be among the plenary speakers.

One page abstracts may be submitted either by mail (one hard copy accompanied
by an ASCII-file on a diskette) or, preferably, by email (ASCII-file only) so
as to arrive no later than October 1, 1996.

Subject: Roykh

I have been puzzled by the etymology of the Yiddish word "roykh" (smoke). Is
it from the German "rauch" or from the Hebrew "ruakh"? Can there be a
connection between the German and the Hebrew, say via the Yiddish, or perhaps
even further back?

Subject: Bokser

Theodor Gaster in "Festivals of the Jewish Year" devotes several pages to
Tu-Beshvat and its customs. He quotes a poem from a Dzhudezmo "manual" for the
holiday, which mentions the carob. The word used is 'alharuba', the Arabic
name which is the etymon of carob. Looks like Sephardim didnt use the
loshn-koydesh name either.

They may well have been the bokser pipeline to the Ashkenazim.

Subject: Unofficial Cracow's Yiddish page

I'm writing to let you know of the Unofficial Cracow's Yiddish Page accessible
by WWW. This is a very modest project, however, I think that it might be of
interest to some people subscribed to your list. Should you find it so, please
repost the information about it on your list.

Subject: Glaykhn

Az s'kumt shoyn tsu reyd "glaykhn" ...

The following passage, from a discussion of loan words in immigrant speech in
Bloomfield's _Language_ (1933), is relevant:

Soon after the German gets here, we find him using in his German speech, a
host of English forms, ... He makes loan-translations, such as "ich gleich'
das nicht" "I don't like that," where, on the model of English "like", a verb
with the meaning 'be fond of' is derived from the adjective "gleich" 'equal,
resemblant.' Some of these locutions, like this last, have become
convetionally established in American immigrant German. (Quoted from the 1984
reprint, page 462)

Since German Jews were important in the American Jewish community before large
numbers of immigrants came from Eastern Europe, it seems plausible that
"glaykhn" in Yiddish may have originated as "gleichen" in immigrant German. Is
this plausible for England & Australia as well?

By the way, for those who don't know, Leonard Bloomfield was one of the most
important American linguists of this century.

Subject: _Found Treasures_

Shirley Kumove's recent posting [5.264] prompts a reminder from me that anyone
who has not taken a look at _Found Treasures: Stories by Forgotten Women
Yiddish Writers_, owes it to themselves to do so -- a wondeful book!

Subject: Syllable onsets in Yiddish

Neil Jacobs [5.269] has raised an interesting phonological point, which I
suspect is made more difficult to get at by the apparently inconsistent
romanizations in UW's dictionary. I emphasize 'apparent', since there may well
be other, non-phonological reasons for particular romanizations. For instance,
the pronunciation 'khezhbm' is so widespread that he selected it for the
klal-shprakh, whereas in other cases there may have been no widespread form
with phonemic merger.

I wonder if Neil would clarify some details of Yiddish phonetics to enable
others to help his investigation.

It seems to me that in Eastern Yiddish, two obstruents in word initial
position are both either voiced or unvoiced at the phonetic level and that any
distinction between underlying voiced/voiceless pairs is due to the usually
redundant fortis/lenis feature. For many (some?)speakers then, 'psak' and
'bsule' do not have the same initial consonant, though both are unvoiced. Is
this impression borne out by your work?

For some of the words cited, e.g. 'kdushe', 'sdorim', many speakers to not
have an initial consonant cluster, but rather k'dushe, s'dorim. Is this
correct?

What do those who have zgule have in the initial clusters produced by enclitic
s as in s'gayes, s'gopele, etc.?

My apologies to Neil for answering a question with so many questions.
