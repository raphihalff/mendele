Subject: _Chulyot_ ('Links') No. 3 (1996)

Mendelyaner will be interested to know that the third number of the
Hebrew-language Israeli journal _Chulyot_ will be appearing shortly after
Passover and can now be ordered.  Devoted exclusively to the study of Yiddish
language, literature and folklore, the journal also includes stories, essays
and poems in Yiddish as well as in Hebrew translation.  The special prize of
No. 3 is the original Yiddish poem "Evigingo" by the Vilna poet Leyzer Volf,
accompanied by a remarkable Hebrew translation by the editor Shalom Luria.

The journal can be ordered from _Chulyot_, Department of Hebrew and
Comparative Literature, University of Haifa, Haifa 31 999, Israel. There are
still copies of No. 2 availabe.  No. 1 is now out-of-print (and eagerly sought
after if you happen to have a copy you don't mind selling).  Each issue costs
twelve US dollars.  Checks can be made out to _Chulyot_.

Here is the Table of Contents of No. 3:
