Subject: What's the Yiddish for Bessie?

Howard Sage asks about the possibility that his grandmother Bessie might
be known as Elsa in documents from Vienna.  This doesn't seem probable to
me.  I rather think that the Yiddish would be Basyah/Batyah for Bessie.

Subject: Tevye

Surely, Bob Werman _meant_to write (Vol 5.030) tevye der _milkhiker_, not
"milkhedicher."

As to the pronunciation of tevye's name, Dzigan's reported comfort with
toyva (toyve?) flies in the face of sholem aleykhem's own indication: der
milkhiker is addressed as "Tevel" (not "Toyvel") by Russian speakers
(e.g., in "lekh-lekha," p. 205 _et. seq._. sholem aleykhem folksfond
oysgabe, 1925).

Oh, and both tevye and sholem aleykhem would spell the former's name:
tes-veyz-yud-hey, not "tet-bet-yod-heh."

Subject: Zellig Back and the 'rationality" issue

I was pleased to note Zellig Bach's support [Vol 5.030] of the
rationality of Harvey Spiro's feelings. He need not apologize for being
offended.  He was offended and I share his feelings.  As a native Yiddish
speaker I am weary of having people think of the language I grew up in,
the language in which my world view is shaped, in which all important
values were transmitted, treated as if it were a "quaint" joke or an
esoteric oddity. We are not just talking about the language, but the
people. This patronizing attitude to the language was also directed at
its speakers, the ordinary immigrants whose lives were anything but a
joke.  Perhaps it might be better to be despised. Then at least someone
respects you. Yes the language lends itself to humor. It can be earthy or
folksy but all of us here on Mendele already know it is so much more.

I recently made myself unpopular with a woman teaching Shabbes songs. The
one Yiddish song she used, Chiri Bim, when she had been taught it, (by
anti-Yiddishists), was made into a mockery with heavy "oys" inserted
strategically.  For her generation this is how the song is set now. But
this rendition of it was deeply offensive to me. It speaks of juvenile
embarrassment with one's immigrant parents, and embarrassment and
rejection of their religious beliefs. It is time to mature out of this
narrow perspective. I stopped the class then and there, spoke of my
feelings and why I felt as I did. She was gracious but embarrassed. I
said that if we are going to be sensitive multiculturally, they should
start with my culture.

How to educate people out of this mentality is a problem. But let's try
and occasionally speak up  for Yiddish as a language and culture. It will
get through to intelligent people. Thank you Mr. Bach.

Subject: Translating of Yiddish

In Mendele 5.028 there was a post by Fishl about translators of Yiddish
which seemed to indicate that there is a rather widespread need for such
translators.  Inasmuch as there are computer programs which enable one to
translate from Spanish, French, German, Hebrew to English, and vice
versa, why can't we also have a Yiddish to English program to help
satisfy the need for translating from Yiddish to English?  Surely some
Mendelnik meyvn should be able to create such a program.  I probably am
not the first to think of this, and someone may well be working on it
right now.

Subject: "Pik-holts" revisited  (with a digression on "bote")

A while ago I inquired in Mendele as to the meaning of the word
"pik-holts" (as well as the origin of the idiom in which I came across
it, "shoyte ben pikholts").  Suggestions included a type of wood or tree,
a woodpecker, or a toothpick.

During my just-completed trip to Israel, I asked various cousins of mine
who are native Yiddish speakers about it.  One of them had come across
the word before in a tshuve (halakhic responsum), where "pikholts" was
used to refer to a forshpil (the traditional party in the house of a
bride on the shabbes before her wedding).  He further said that the
literal meaning of "pikholts" is a huge, round, flat, wooden utensil,
sort of like an oversize cutting board, and that at one point it was
customary to place a pikholts over or near the door of the house where a
forshpil would be taking place, to identify the location to guests, and
the party acquired the name of the object used to identify its location.

In this context, I guess referring to a person as a pikholts is similar
to calling someone a blockhead in English.

(I think this account of the etymology was either explicit in or inferred
from the responsum;  I don't think my cousin had come across the use of
"pikholts" in contemporary speech.  Given that the responsum is a couple
of hundred years old, I suspect that "pikholts" has not been used this
way for a very long time, and this usage has only survived as part of the
idiom.)

[This sort of association giving new meaning to a word may seem a bit
far-fetched, but I know of a similar case:  the word "bote."  Among
Rumanian and Hungarian khsidim, when the rebbe is out of town, unwell, or
on vacation, a senior member of his family (usually the heir apparent)
conducts a mini-tish, which is called a "bote."  In some courts, even if
no one from the rebbe's family is around, the khsidim gather on Friday
night for a bote, conducted by senior member(s) of the group.

The origin of the word has been explained to me as follows: "bote"
originally meant a stick or pole (I'm not sure in what language).  Many a
Rumanian rebistive was made up a collection of towns and villages (as
opposed to being based in a single location).  The rebbe would spend a
part of the year travelling around these villages, occasionally staying
for shabbes and conducting a tish.  When the rebbe wasn't around, the
khsidim would gather on Friday night after the shabbes meal to eat and
sing together.  Every week they would pick one balebos who was given the
dubious honour of hosting everyone at his house.  (If he didn't put out
enough of a spread, what little he had in his pantry would often be
liberated for the common good.)  A stake--a "bote"--would be planted in
the ground outside the door of the "lucky" balebos, so that everyone
would know where the gathering was taking place.  Anyone looking for the
gathering would look for the bote, and eventually the event came to be
called a bote as well. "Bote" is now used to refer to any gathering of
khsidim on Friday night at which the rebbe is not present;  it is not
used to refer to sticks, although this etymology is pretty widely known.]

Subject: "Yiddish Forever Young"

In its recent double issue (6/26 -- 7/3/95) _The New Yorker_magazine
published an article by Ian Frazier called "In the Stacks" (p. 188) about
the great Butler Library of Columbia University -- twelve floors of
library stacks, most aboveground, some partly below.  (While doing
research for my doctorate, I spent many hours in the cavernous rooms of
that library.)

Mr. Frazier describes the atmosphere in the library, as well as the
"inscriptions" he uncovered, miniature graffiti made with hard ballpoint
pens in the wooden individual study tables.

Notwithstanding energetic efforts of the library maintenance people to
erase and cover up with cleaning fluids and furniture polish the
scribblings from the tables, Mr. Frazier managed to capture some of the
messages from the groove marks left in the wood.

Some of these scribblings are personal and  "thematically" clear
("Tomorrow is a physics exam.  Help!").  Other messages are of a general,
non-specific nature -- about existential problems, sex, the philosophy of
life.  One of the messages in this last group reads:

"YIDDISH FOREVER YOUNG" -- all in capitals, no initials of the "engraver,"
no date (unlike a love message carved in the bark of a tree for the whole
world to see).

On the same table, nearby, another message, in German:  "Das ist nicht
Richtig" [this is not correct].  A direct rebuttal of the message about
Yiddish?  By an ignorant hatelerite (no, not a misspelling) who does not
even know his German (the word "richtig" is not capitalized).  Who knows?

The idea "Yiddish forever young" appeals to me.  Regardless of her age (a
thousand years?) our mame-loshn retains the creative capacity to adapt
itself to new circumstances and purposes, to new tasks and innovative
expressive demands, and, especially, its wondrous phoenix-like capacity
to rejuvenate and renew itself, and--identifying itself with its people--
rise from its ashes young again.
