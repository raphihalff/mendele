"Their Game Is Basketball, Their Playbook's in Yiddish"

To the Editor:

The use of a button to illustrate the article concerning a conference
about women and Yiddish (Yiddish: the Seminar," Nov. 5) leaves the
impression that the button was the seminar's logo.  Actually the button -
which bears the message "Speak to me in Yiddish" - is produced and sold
by Yugntruf/Youth for Yiddish, an international organization of young
Yiddish speakers.

The basketball game mentioned in the article is a Yugntruf activity.
Anyone interested in joining us for a merciless game in Yiddish will find
us Wednesday mornings at 8 o'clock in Tompkins Square Park.

Subject: Yiddish and Judendeutsch

Forgive this comment from a *real* ignoramus.  As far as I can tell,
there was a substantial group of people who sought to distinguish between
the various Yiddishes of Eastern Europe and the Western dialect of
Yiddish, which became known as Judendeutsch.  For example, the article
for "dialect" in the *New Standard Jewish Encyclopedia* takes great pains
to delineate two classes of Jewish dialects, home-grown and the sort Jews
brought with them from one place to another.  Needless to say, Yiddish
and Judendeutsch are thus able to be listed separately, one in each
category.

This distinction enabled those (Western European Jews and non-Jews alike)
profoundly uncomfortable with the accents, poverty, mores, religiosity,
Communist-atheism, or what-have-you of *Ostjuden* to make virtually a
different species of them, and utterly different languages of two highly
similar dialects of Judeo-German.  There is a substantial Yiddish strain
of satire of such up-gebuttoned (so to speak) German Jews; one hilarious
example being something I saw in the *Forverts* in the late 1980s, a
satirical supposed-speech by Bruno Bettleheim.  (This followed a supposed
song by Broos Springshteyn, which had a chorus of "Lomir redn Yiddish;
Die Kinder zoln nit fershteyn.")  "Bettleheim"'s speech began with
something very close to: "Meyn Damen unt Herren: van ikh gedenk meyn
mutti unt putti..."

Incidentally, let me thank Mendele: it enables me to at least maintain my
kindishe bukh-gelernt Yiddish, practice it with the Yiddish posts, and
see what the Yiddish-minded are thinking about.  I wish I had the
background, knowledge, and ability to participate on the level that some
of you do (recent posts dealing with words in different dialects of
Yiddish I found to be dizzyingly virtuosic), but I'm enjoying what I can.

Subject: Belz or Belts

Is the title of the song "Belz, mayn shteytele Belz" 'Belz' or 'Belts'?

I have heard from Belzer khsidim that the song was composed by one of
theirs who left the fold and the title is Belz. But an aunt of mine tells
me it should be Belts after a town in Rumania that was the Broadway of
Yiddish Theatre in that region.

The few cassette sleeve covers I have seen have it as Belz.
