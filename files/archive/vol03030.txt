Subject: Non-electronic horses and electronic water

Athought for ellen prince: "...doesn't/won't have an e-mail
account...". Talking to people who do not want any part of
electronic resources -helft vi a toytn bankas - if I may be allowed
L'ARBEV SIMHA B'SIMHA (mix one pleasure with another, as they say in
Hebrew). How others have tried/succeeded in overcoming this is
something I would be very interested in hearing about. For several
years I have been teaching courses on online and other electronic
resources at a small local institution. Attempts to get
professors/students interested in several-hour-workshops I created
to teach electronic resources for either Russia/E.Europe  or the
Middle East, do not get very far;the few who do come are very happy
to have learned all this and want more such. I was rather surprised
when at your shop & my alma mater, U of PA, when I proposed to send
in for consideration an article surveying these resources to the
SLAVIC REVIEW, now based at Penn, I never got any answer at all -
and as you probably know, your Russ/E.Eur. center is very
computerized.

        So, why don't people want e-mail or electronic resources ??

On a related note - I just received e-mail on another LIST that
there is now apparently serious talk of restricting use of Internet
severely and charging fees to many present users. That letter
includes what purport to be new E-mail addresses for Clinton and
Gore and asks readers to send in E-mail opposing the proposed
change.

Subject: Here and there

Moshe Waldoks (vos voynt in Newton) writes:

"...in this country..."  "...in these United States..."

which makes me feel as if I am a usurper.

The Boulder Yiddish Club, mir zoln lebn un zayn gezunt, will have

Anyone have his address?

Subject: vi heysn mir?

In a recent posting, ellen prince states that a female colleague
"should ... be a mendelnik."  My immediate reaction was that ellen
should have said "mendelnitse", but if "man" embraces "woman" [as I
once heard it argued], then no doubt "-nik" embraces "-nitse", and
the plural "-nikes" would embrace "-nitses".  But what about the
first element?  Mendl-/Mendel- or Mendel_e_-? Both have been used
here.  Mendlnik/Mendelnik seems somehow more likely than Mendelenik,
but lacks the diminutive of the klasiker we honor.  (More than a
year ago, someone used the term "Mendelayt" for the plural, which
struck me as delightful, but would imply a singular of Mendelman,
which has problems of its own, in addition to the loss of the
diminutive.)  Was this issue dealt with early in MENDELE's first
year?

(So that this posting shouldn't be a total waste, here's an idiom
for Elye's collection:

"ale montik un donershtik" = unusually or unnecessarily frequently.
Of a hypochondriac it might be said "ale montik un donershtik loyft
er tsum dokter."  No doubt the expression comes from the custom of
some especially pious Jews to fast (or do something else
supererogatory?) on Mondays and Thursdays.)
