i thank dan leeson for pointing out the _most_ hilarious thing i've ever
seen on the web! for those of you who missed it, check out:

http://www.islandnet.com/~edonon/homepage.html

and, dan, no, he presents _no_ evidence of a relationship between yiddish
and basque. in fact, given what we know about sound change in each of
those languages, he winds up providing stellar evidence for _no_
relationship (as tho we needed new evidence...).

Subject: Basque and Yiddish

In Mendele 6.054, Dan Leeson writes that the author is not a nutcase,
and (Dan) confesses his own ignorance of Basque.

It took me about 40 seconds to appreciate this page, which is obviously
an ingenious joke.  Assuming, as I do, that the author's knowledge of
Basque is legitimate, he has gone through great pain to find Basque
phrases that sound like Yiddish ones and bear some hint of the Yiddish
phrase's meaning.

This is a favorite game of logophiles, as when I once described a former
financial aide of mine as "Ba'al oni" "Master of my strength/wealth" ...

Unless, of course, Dan's post is tongue-in-cheek, too...

Subject: Spinoza and Yiddish

Further to David Goldberg's reference to Khayim Sloves' play _Borekh fun
amsterdam_, (Baruch [Spinoza] of Amsterdam), it should be noted that the
1960s NY performances he mentions were staged by the _nayer yidisher
teyater_ (New Yiddish Theatre), successor to the legendary Artef
(arbeter teyater farband--Worker's Theatre Alliance) and the _yidisher
teyater ansambl_ (Yiddish Theatre Ensemble). (See Zilbertsvayg, Zalmen,
_leksikon fun yidishn teyater_ Vol. 6, 5891-5895.)

Subject: Yiddish women's "work songs"

Hello!  A local women's chorus here in Urbana, Illinois, is looking for
women's "work songs" in Yiddish--meaning more or less any song about or
by women doing work, in the house or out of it (I count as examples "Der
Fodem", where the speaker is a seamstress, and "Di Trayengl-Fayer," a
dirge written after the famous sweatshop fire that killed so many young
girls). I have been through a few Yiddish song books in search of such
songs, and have found very many beautiful lullabies and wedding songs
and lots of humorous betrothal and courtship songs, but not as many
"working" songs as I was hoping.  Can anyone point me to some of these
songs, suggest a collection, or give me ideas about composers, etc.?
Thank you very much in advance...
