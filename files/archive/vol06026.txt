     Thank you for your e-mail regarding Yiddish and the World Zionist
     Organization. The WZO has, for many years been a tremendous
     supporter, both morally and financially, of the World Council for
     Yiddish by providing them with office space, electricity and
     services at absolutely no charge. This is a significant point that
     has been omitted from most "open letters" and other publications
     relating to the subject.

     The World Council for Yiddish was given ample notice in order to
     find alternative office space and to make their arrangements.
     Regarding the allocation to the Council-the Council will no longer
     be receiving an automatic allocation, but it is certainly welcome
     to apply for WZO funding just like any other public body.

     Sincerely,

     Avraham Burg
     Chairman of the Executive
     Office of the Chairman

A hartsikn yasher-koyekh di aroysgebers fun Tam-Tam!!  U, va, s'iz sheyn!

Since there have been a couple of complaints about their use of pdf
format, let me comment briefly. Adobe Acrobat (the program that reads
and displays pdf format) is available for free on all major platforms.
(Yes, unix too, if you're using X windows. And if you aren't using X,
how are you going to display Hebrew characters?) And using this format
we get to see an exact duplicate of the beautifully laid-out printed
version. If there's another platform independent, freely available
format that can duplicate these results, I'd like to hear about it.

Now that I've seen it, my problem is figuring out how to send a
money-order in francs so I can subscribe. Even if it's available for
free on the Net, I want to subscribe to give them the financial support.

A couple of technical tips: it's laid out for paper that's larger than
American 8.5x11, probably A4 size. So if you just print it, you lose the
bottom lines of each page. In Acrobat it's easy to tell it to scale it
down to 90% when printing, and that way it prints nicely on American
paper.

And be careful if you're using a Mac, _and_ you have the Hebrew Language
Kit installed. Unfortunately the HLK interferes with the way that
Acrobat tries to display the Hebrew characters, producing garbled output
(and running very slowly besides). If you disable WorldScript using the
Extension Manager, and restart your Mac, Acrobat should be able to
display the file nicely. (If there's a way to deal with this without
rebooting the Mac, I'd like to hear about it.)

Finally, the first of the three issues currently on-line doesn't seem to
down-load correctly, at least on Unix. Maybe they'll be able to fix
this, but in the meantime, start with the second and third issues.

Excepting Mendele of course, this has got to be one of the most
interesting Yiddish I've seen on the net so far. And on the Web to boot.

They chose PDF which some have questioned. PDF is available for Windows,
for MACs, and for four Unices (Sun, HP, SGI, AIX). That certainly still
leaves some folks out, but is not quite as bad as Windows only...

PDF is huge, granted, but the files are quite a bit more compact than
the other alternatives I know of (postscript, and, for the same quality,
GIFs).

Once HTML really supports R2L scripts and non latin characters, and once
browsers than can do same are widespread, and once fonts are available
without much trouble, then HTML should be a *much* better medium. I
don't see that happening for some time yet.

With PDF, I didn't have to load any fonts from anywhere, it just worked
first time (I had previously installed acroread of course, but hadn't
used it for anything but English so far). It works because PDF carries
the fonts within itself (which explains the file size). It also
obviously deals with R2L, but I know not how. And the print quality is
just great.

With respect to using transliteration instead, well, I can certainly
read transliteration with much less effort, but how could I object to
using Yiddish letters (on Mendele or elsewhere)? After all, proficiency
in reading Yiddish the way it has been printed for 1000 years is
certainly valuable and worth a bit of effort. It's the one thing I
really miss on Mendele: real oysyes.

And could a Yiddish periodical get away ("politically") with publishing
in Latin letters? That's fine for us Mendelyaner, given all the
technical problems, but for a publication?
