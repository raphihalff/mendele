Subject: Did Sholem Aleichem have Attention Defecit?

The more I read Sholem Aleichem, the more I feel that he may have
suffered from what is currently called Attention Deficit and
Hyperactivity Disorder (or ADHD).  ADHD is a label now in vogue among
child psychiatrists for what used to be called "hyperactivity" or
"impulsivity" in kids.  (ADHD was featured on the cover of Time magazine
this summer.)

Such people, adults and children (predominantly males), are characterized
as having: limited attention spans, trouble with decisions, and jump
(verbally, physically and in their thought processes) from one topic to
another.  As the parent of such a child, I see aspects of similar
behavior in several of Sholem Aleichem's characters, and wonder whether
he was reflecting his own (?) ADHD in those characters.

Tevye is a classic attention deficit adult.  His conversations ramble and
diverge wildly from their original objectives, and he keeps having to
remind himself of his original theme and intentions.  Whole sections of
dialogue start off paragraph after paragraph with "b'kitsur," then
continue deviating from the main topic.  He daydreams of riches on his
wagon, and runs into a tree.  He listens to Menakhm Mendl's schemes all
night, understands nothing, impulsively hands over all his "groyse
gevins," then later asks his Golde what it was that he invested in.  He
jumps from disapproval to approval of Layzer Volf's bid for marriage,
then reverses himself when his daughter appeals to him.  All of course
sprinkled with Tevye's unique medreshim.

Motl, Peysi dem Khazn's would certainly be diagnosed today as
"hyperactive," jumping from thought to thought, can't seem to keep his
body still.  As I read the stories, I imagine him prancing and dancing
around New York, London and his home shtetl. (Motl's "khaver" Pinni is
also probably ADHD.)  Life as a poor orphan and immigrant was hard, but I
bet a prescription of Ritalin would have made him a more manageable kid
-- although possibly unworthy of literary fame.

In two short stories, "An eytse" and "Fun'm priziv," the protagonists
keep jabbering and jumping around verbally, have difficulty sticking to
their topic, don't hear what others say to them, and keep losing their
listener's attention.  In the former, the young husband (whose wealthy
wife has fallen for her doctor) is constantly reminded by Sholem Aleichem
to get to the point. In the latter, the father of the youth who is called
several times for army physicals tells such a convoluted story that he
creates his own undoing.  As he goes from lawyer to lawyer without making
his case understood, he ends up crying rhetorically: "Er zogt az ikh bin
a nudnik. IKH bin a NUDNIK?!" Which of course he is.

Any thoughts or comments appreciated.

Subject: A nut or berry called "afn"?

A friend recalls that her late father, a Yiddish speaker from
Czechoslovakia (or maybe Romania), used to talk of a berry (?) or nut (?)
called an "afn" or "afen".  The word is not in Weinreich or Harkavy, or
in Mordkhe Schaechter's _Mit a gutn apetit!: a reshime gastronomishe
terminen_.  Can some Mendelenik identify it?  A sheynem dank.

Subject: Events at Stanford

On behalf of the Stanford Jewish Studies program, I want to extend
an invitation to all Yiddish enthusiasts to the following events:

Dan Miron, the well known Israeli literary scholar and critic,
professor of Jewish Literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Columbia
University, and the YIVO Institute, is delivering two lectures at Stanford
University in November.

  	November 2, 8:00 p.m., Professor Miron will deliver a lecture
in English entitled:   "The Literary Image of the East European Shtetl:
  An Aesthetic Construct, A Historical Comment"  in Stanford's Tressider
 Union, Oak West Lounge.

	November 3, 4:00 p.m., Professor Miron will deliver a lecture
in Yiddish entitled, "Tsi iz take faran ein moderne clal-isroel literatur?"
(Is there a unified modern Jewish literature?" in Stanford's Tressider
 Union, Cypress South Lounge.

Both lectures are free and open to the public.  A reception will follow
each lecture;  dietary restrictions obeserved.

For more information, please call (415)723-7589.

Subject: Yiddish Music Class

For anyone in the San Francisco Bay Area:

A six week class (started October 17th) on Monday mornings from 10-11:30
a.m. is being offered at the Contra Costa JCC, 2071 Tice Valley Blvd.,
Walnut Creek : a history of Yiddish music in the new world.  Meyer
Halpern, who teaches courses on Yiddish culture and life in America, is
the instructor.

First class this Monday was fabulous.  Individual lecture attendance is
permitted at $10 each.  Highly recommended.
