Subject: Plural -im

A few other examples which come to mind are kabtsonim, dalfonim, and
klezmorim.

And speaking of klezmorim, I have a question for the linguists. This word
(klezmer, klezmorim) is an example of the name of an object being
transferred to the person who does something with the object, in this
case, a musician being called an instrument. Does this phenomenon have a
name? Are there other examples?

Subject: Mertsol fun tokhes

Harkavy appears also to give _te'kheser_ (he doesn't provide
pronunciations) as the plural of _tokhes_.  In the bilingual 1898
dictionary, he has (Yid.-Eng. p. 343)

tof-khes-sof [m.] (pl. tof-khes-sof-ayen-reysh) 'arse'.

In the 1928 trilingual version (p. 521) he translates the singular as
'hind quarters, arse', with the same plural as in '98.

Harkavy's Yiddish, English, Hebraish Verterbukh of 1928 includes tokhes
(tof, khes, sof) as does also Harkavy's English-Yiddish, Yiddish-English
dictionary of 1898.

Subject: The modern Hebrew kabtsn and tokhes

There have been several contributions about two Yiddish words and their
possible connection with Hebrew: _kabtsn_ and _tokhes_.   There is no
doubt that in present day Hebrew the equivalents of these words, and with
the same respective meanings, are qabtzan (qof, bet, tzadi, nun) and
tahat (tav, het, tav).  I have looked for these rather common Hebrew
words in my Even Shoshan dictionary, and from the example given for
qabtzan it seems to me that it is a relatively new word (the root is old
as is well known, just its use for a shnorer seems to be new).  Tahat,
the proper Even Shoshan does not bring at all in the tokhes sense.

Would it be correct to deduce from that the two words words were
introduced into modern Hebrew from the Yiddish, which in turn made up
these words from Hebrew *roots* but not words?
