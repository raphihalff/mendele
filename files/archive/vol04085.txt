Subject: "Papirosn" lyrics

I am looking for the lyrics and composer for the Yiddish song "Papirosn"
("Cigarettes"). I have two recorded versions, a Barry Sisters'
arrangement and a Klezmer Conservatory Band arrangement. They do not
agree on many of the words, and neither provides printed lyrics or
composer. Does any Mendelnik have this information, or can lead me to a
book with this information? Through careful listening I have deciphered
about 75% of the Barry Sisters' version, but it's that last 25% I cannot
understand. I sing in two Jewish choirs (LaShir of Princeton, NJ; Arbel
of Philadelphia) and would like to offer it to them for performance.

Shlomo-Khayem Cohen

Subject: bibliography of Yiddish in English translation?

Often when I look at a good Yiddish story or essay I'm inclined to
translate it - but given how much Yiddish literature there is, and how
little has been translated, I don't particularly want to retranslate what
has been translated already.  Is there a bibliography of Yiddish in
English translation, or if not are there other ways of finding out
whether a given text has been translated?  Thanks,

Larry Rosenwald

Subject: Recording Review - Voices of the Ghetto

April 19, 1943.  Warsaw.  An insurrection against the Nazis by the Jews
in the Ghetto.  April, 1993.  Paris.  Jacques  Grober and Fania Perez,
along with a talented group including 7 singers and 3 instrumentalists,
publish a CD called Voix du Ghetto, commemorating the insurrection. A
collection of 20 Yiddish songs, accompanied simply by an accordion or a
piano, a violin and a contrabass.  This emotional collection spans the
range from profound grief of shattered lives to the strength of
resistance and the power of hope.  This recording was conceived, in the
words of Grober and Perez, to pay collective homage to the victims  of
the Nazis as well as the brave fighters of the Ghetto This is not a
collection of the sentimental old songs one usually associates wi Yiddish
recordings.  On the contrary; the songs are deeply disturbing.  When one
considers that some were originally performed in the Ghetto, they become
a haunting reminder of a time when civilization was catastrophically
derailed.  A song about a street vendor named Yisrolke has stayed with me
in a particularly poignant way.  In this song, a boy sings of his lost
parents, his grief, his po and his attempt to greet his customers with a
whistle and a song.  It seems to take on the voice of all of the children
of the Ghetto.

The songs are old.  The recording, however, is modern and of a very high
quality.  I am amazed at the influence of the tango on many of the songs.
In f one song is called a Yiddish Tango.  The accordionist, Eddy
Schaff-Szafirowicz, draws wonderfully on Astor Piazzolla for some
inspiration.  I am curious about this influence, however.  Perhaps it
reflects the popularity of the tango in 19 Europe.

Voices of the Ghetto, Warszawa, 1943 is published by 7 Productions, Item
number 242066.  It has a total duration of 55:49.  The jacket notes
includ English transliterations of the Yiddish as well as French and
English translations.  A chronology of the Warsaw Ghetto is also
included. Congratulations and thank you to the group that produced this
outstanding recording.

Subject: Bai mir bist du sheyn

Does anyone know the Yiddish lyrics of "Bay mir bist du sheyn"? I presume
that there was a Yiddish song before the Andrew Sisters. Any information
would be welcome.

Subject: Kitchen Yiddish

To add  a few more comments to this nostalgic topic... I grew up in a
small non-Jewish town in N.J. On our block lived mostly German and Polish
families, and at the end of the block (naturally) there was a small
apartment house, where the 6 Jewish families lived.

I was fortunate to have my maternal grandmother living with us. She made
no effort to learn English, so I learned my "kitchen yiddish" from her.
She experienced no problems in not speaking English. In fact, one of my
oldest memories is of her, and the Italian speaking iceman, working out
the size and price of the ice block he had hauled up the stairs, to our
kitchen.

My young parents however, immediately went to night school to learn
English, and become Americanized. It might have been easier for me if
they hadn't, because I copied their way of speaking, and they invariably
put the accent on the wrong "syl-LAB-le, so I provided much unwanted
merriment to my "yankee" classmates when I spoke of vegah-TABELS, and
FAN-atics.

And since I understood quite a bit of Yiddish, my parents would have to
speak in Russian, when they didn't want me to know what was being said.

I've only been on Mendele a short while, but I find all the dialects and
language usage fascinating, and am learning quite a bit, so a shanem dank
tzu allemen.

Subject: Zawel Kwartin, redux

Will the person who got in touch with me before, who was part of the
Kwartin/Quartin family, prompting my post about the late Cantor, please
email me again?  The Cantor's son and daughter-in-law have gotten in
touch with me, and are looking for you.
