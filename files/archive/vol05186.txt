Subject: Another loshen-koydesh dictionary

I may have missed someone else mentioning it, but just in case:  for
those interested in a source on Hebraisms especially rooted in Torah and
Rabbinical literature, there is the rare:

_Yidish Verterbukh_ fun Yehoash un Dr. Khaym Spivak (Farlag "Veker," New
York: 1926).

I managed to get a copy at the National Yiddish Book Center this summer,
but they would only sell me one of the copies that was coming
apart...They're sending the intact copies to libraries.  But if I recall
correctly it was very inexpensive for such a rare volume.

Still, for copies not literally coming apart at the seams, one might try
the local university library...

Subject: Loshn-koydesh: dictionaries and questions

Briefly on various matters that have arisen with respect to the
loshn-koydesh (L-K) component of Yiddish, including Bob Rothstein's most
recent query. (Note: The term "loshn-Koydesh" is useful because it
subsumes elements of both Hebrew and Aramaic origin.)

1. Dictionaries

The most comprehensive are:

Yehoyosh, aand Kh. Spivak: _Yidish verterbukh, anthalt ale hebreishe (un
khaldeishe) verter . . ._, New York 1911.

Pereferkovich, N.: _Hebreizmen in yidish_, Riga, 1929.

Shteynberg, Y.: _Hebreizmen in der yidisher shprakh_, Wroclaw,
1949.

I'm sure that all of these are hard to come by. It is worth photocopying
any one or all of them in full.

2. The theoretical questions:

a) Can we determine the boundaries between L-K, per se, and Yiddish
which, by definition, encompasses a L_K component? In other words, can we
distinguish

     i) Yiddish from
     ii) Yiddish with citations from L-K, and
     iii) Yiddish "mixed" with L-K?

b) Is a Yiddish speaker's ability to comprehend L-K or to cite from L-K
sources a function of his/her scholarship/learnedness?

c) Is the extent of/the nature of the L-K component in the Yiddish of a
given speaker a function of his/her scholarship/learnedness?

d) Is the extent of/the nature of the L-K component in the Yiddish of a
given speaker a function of geography?

My answers, without elaboration are
a) Yes, b) Yes, c) No, d) Yes.

There are separate issues involved in assessing the use of L-K in the
Western Yiddish area, where the language underwent serious dissolution
under pressure from standard German and simultaneous "jargonization";
i.e., L-K elements (that were probably never part of "normal" speech)
were deliberately exploited for particular, largely cryptic/trade
purposes, in a German language environment.

There are two articles that are central to some of these issues, both by
Uriel Weinreich and both _in Hebrew_:

"The mixed Yiddish-Hebrew scribal style of the 16th-18th century".
_Leshonenu_ XXII (1957/58), 54-66.

"Ashkenazic Hebrew and the Hebrew Component in Yiddish: Their geographic
aspect". _Leshoneynu_ XXIV (1959/60), 242-252; XXV (1960/61), 57-80,
180-196.

Shloyme-Khayim 'Steve' Cohen and I (Benyomin 'Ken' Moss) have been
speaking about the possibility of starting a Yiddish conversation group
here at Rutgers. If there are Mendeleyners out there who live in Central
Jersey and have an interest in a shmues-krayz (and/or a reading group),
or who have friends with such an interest, send me a letter here, or at
kmoss@eden.rutgers.edu or call me at 214-1318 or 549-5843 (908 area
code). I'm afraid you'll have to use my English name with my roomates.

Subject: Judeo Alsatian

As long as the discussion of the relationship between Judeo German and
Yiddish is under discussion, let me add to the matter with a related
topic, Judeo Alsatian.

From what I have been able to learn about this language, it is a variant
on Romansch and has little to do with either German or Yiddish. It is a
specialized language all of its own.

I first became knowledgeable of the existence of the language (dialect??)
when I attempted translation of some Jewish marriage contracts from the
late 1700s and I was stopped dead in my tracks.  To begin with the
handwriting was indecipherable, and some number of Hebrew words were not
only unknown to me but did not even sound as if they were Hebrew. That is
to say, I would find some traditional boiler plate about this one
marrying that one, and then all of a sudden I would read a word whose
pronunciation made me suspect that it could just as well have been
Iclandic or Serbo-croatian.

Finally, I was able to find a specialist in translating marriage
contracts and bethrothal agreements from that period and he provided me
with a splendid translation.

However, from what I have discerned thus far, there is not the slightest
relationship between Yiddish and Judeo Alsatian, though the Alsatian Jews
may have also spoken Yiddish in addition to the several languages of the
region.

My wife and I spent some time in Alsace last summer and I watched an
Alsatian language TV program every day for a week to see if I could
capture so much as a word or two.  Though my French and German are
passable, I could not understand a single word said over the time.  No
wonder I had such problems with Judeo Alsatian!  It is as if some Bantu
language were written in Hebrew characters!!
