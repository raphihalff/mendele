                    NATIONWIDE ORAL HISTORY OF THE SECULAR
                        YIDDISH SCHOOLS IN AMERICA

A nationwide oral history project of the Yiddish
Secular Schools in America (of all orientations) - by
interviewing former active members (farvalters) of
Yiddish school boards, teachers, and students - is
being conducted by Gella Schweid Fishman, who is
herself a former student, teacher, and active member of
school boards in the Sholem Aleichem Folkshuln in New
York. She presently acts as co-chairperson of the
Sholem Aleichem Shul 21 Cultural Center in the Bronx,
New York.

All those interested in being interviewed about their
memories and experiences in connection with the secular
Yiddish schools are asked to contact:

for blossom kirschenbaum:

sorry. i thought i sent out transcripts to all who
requested them. but your address is incomplete--perhaps
that was the problem. it has to end with something,
typically '.edu' or '.bitnet' in the u.s. i'll try
bitnet (since it's my experience that it's usually
bitnetniks that omit their net extension). let me know
if it's not among your next few msgs. sorry.

p.s. didn't we meet once? your name is very familiar to
me, epes.

Does anyone know the Yiddish word for 'sesame'?  It's not in
Weinreich, nor have I been able to locate it (by working back
ward) either in Harkavy or the oytser.

Subject: kadish

this may be a bit removed from the central theme of the
list - but i suspect there are a few subscribers who can
help me.
 
i would like to know if the mourner's kadish has been
translated into ladino and if so, where it might be found.
apparently rutgers' library has no such document. any
replies, including appropriate people to contact about
this, will be appreciated.

A dear friend of the shames had a Norwegian grandmother, a
devout Lutheran who nevertheless understood that lightning
came from Thor.  Nu, Thor made a surgical strike at the
shames' machine and fried practically everything in it.
He was quite unnerved by this until Ellen Prince explained
to him as to a child that such things are covered by
insurance.

An additional theory holds that all Mendelniks are
in analysis and follow their shrinks to Wellfleet or
Truro for the month of August.  This has not yet been
confirmed.

At any rate, the time of freedom from idleness is at hand
and we can get back to some serious shmoozing.

Tsu der arbet!
