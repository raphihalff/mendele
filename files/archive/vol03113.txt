Subject: pinkes

to dvora biasca, re _pinkes_

i think the word in the book is _pinkes_ (pe-yod-nun-kof-samekh),
which means 'register'. _pinkhes_ is a man's name, so far as i know
unrelated to _pinkes_.

Subject: The Yiddish Dictionary; Plural of "tales"; yarmlke

1. Paul Ritterband speaks  of  the  Yiddish  dictionary  project  as
having  be _abandoned_. It was, rather, halted in its tracks, and it
might be better to spe of it as _dormant_, although if it`s not
revived  in  some  fashion  reasonably soon, this will be a
distinction without a difference. Of late, there has a stir of
interest in the possible renewal of the project. Actually, FOUR
volumes have been published, through _aleph_.

2. Robert Goldberg ask if modern Hebrew changed the plural of
_talis_  for some reason. Not likely. The Yiddish plural _taleysim_
is probably a _Hebreizati of an early regular Yiddish n/plural
_tAlesn_. Yiddish _shabOsim_ from _shAbesn_ (cf. Heb. shabatot) is a
similar case in point. Parallel instances occur when German origin
n/plurals are Hebreized> poyerim, naronim, doktoyrim are probab~ ly
all reinterpretations of poyern, narn, doktern.

3. Dan Slobin is right, of course. Turkish phonology would require
_yagmurlUk_ not _yagmurlAk_. I copied it incorrectly from my own
1964 discussion of the subject. I don`t know now what my source was
then, but I do think that I`ve confirmed the existence of a Turkish
word of similar meaning with a Rumanian// born native speaker of
Turkish. I`ll pursue the question.

I know nothing about the regional origins of the word in Yiddish but
it`s distribution (in the process of being plotted) appears to be
largely on Eastern Slavic territory, as distinct from Poland where
_kapl_ and _kapele_ prevail.

The Yiddish Atlas materials do not specify Turkish elements as such.
They do specify both Rumanian and Ukrainian ones in Yiddish, among
which, I suspect, are a number of words of ultimately Turkish origin
(e.g., _patlezhanes&baklezhan in their various `egg/plant` and
`tomato` meanings < _prakes_, etc.).

The person who probably knows a good deal on the subject is  the
much maligned Paul Wexler.

According to Even-Shoshan, "talis" ("talit" in the Sephardic
pronunciation) is a feminine  noun of Talmudic origin, meaning
a toga-like  garment, without any specific religious function.
Its plural form was  usually "taliot" or "talitot", but the
masculine-sounding variant "talitim" also appears occasionally.
The latter is no-doubt where the Yiddish form comes from.
The  Rabbis of  that period were pretty lax about grammar -
gender  in particular, whereas modern Hebrew  retains the
standard feminine plural form, "taliot" (or "talios").

In modern Hebrew, "pinkas" - spelled with a "kof" (it should be
"qof"  to avoid the temptation to pronounce it with a gutteral "ch")
- simply means "notebook" or "ledger". According to Even-Shoshan, it
original had this general sense in the Talmud, but in medieval times
it took on the more specific meaning of "pinkas ha'kehilah", or
"community  record", as noted above.

I find the *iz* construction strange. I would not say "er *iz*
goyzer geven" but "er *hot* goyzer geven" and likewise for
=mashpie=. To my way of thinking, the past form of =iz ...= is quite
naturally  = ...geven=. This past form then takes *hobn* as
auxiliary in common with the majority of verbs.

A much more common example of nasalization arising from Hebrew ayin
is =yankl= (I guess this should be transcribed =yaynkl= as in fact
some (all?) litvaks pronounce it.) But are there really no others?
