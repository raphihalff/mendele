Subject: Lodzher Ganif

Al Rasof asks about the phrase Lodzher Ganif or Zlodzhe Ganif [09.005]:

In Polish, the word "zlodziej" means thief. To Yiddish speaking Jews, it
sounded like the phrase "z Lodzi" meaning from Lodz, thus Lodzher Ganif. But
native Polish speakers avoided saying "z Lodzi" because it sounds like the
word zlodziej, so that if one said "Jestem z Lodzi", meaning "I'm from
Lodz", it sounds like the phrase "Jestem zlodziej", meaning "I'm a thief".
So your father was a Lodzher.

Subject: "Lodzer" or "Zlodjeh" Gonniff

Al Rasof asked about this phrase, which I find fascinating because of its
punning nature.  The Polish word "zlo," which is also seen in several other
Slavic languages, means "evil," so Al's father was likely punning with
Lodz/zlo.

Subject: "Zlodjeh" Goniff

I like Al Rasof would like some information on Zlodjeh. My wife remembers her 
father using the phrase "Zlodjeh" Goniff meaning an especially cunning theif. 
He was not from Lodz but Rubleh in Russia. Thanks,

Subject: "Lodzer" or "Zlodjeh" Gonniff

In a previous posting (Mendele Vol 09.005), Al Rasof requested further
information regarding the phrase "Lodzer Gonniff" or "Zlodjeh Gonniff."  For
a Lodz native, a response in Polish to the question "where are you from?" is
"z Lodzi," which in Polish means "from Lodz," which sorry to say sounds like
"zlodziej" i.e. "a thief."  In fact, "I am from Lodz" sounds like "I am a
thief" and that response almost never fails to elicit a wise-crack from
someone present.  You will still frequently hear people engage in this
topical exchange, thus we native Lodzer are adept at introducing subtle
verbal strategems to avoid accusations of this kind.

Subject: Lodzer or Zlodjeh Goniff

A play or pun on the Polish for thief=3D"zlodziej", which sounds identical
to "z Lodzi" meaning "from Lodz". For Jews, an irresistible temptation to a
bit of fun at the expense of Lodzhers. 

The pun seems to have affected Polish usage differently. My father tells me
that whenever you speak of coming from a place you say "from + town name",
i.e."z + town name (in appropriate declension), but Lodz is an exception. If
you are from Lodz you say "z miasta Lodzi", ("from the town of Lodz"),
presumably to avoid this unsavoury pun which Jews clearly relished.

From: ROBERT A ROTHSTEIN <rar@slavic.umass.edu>
Subject: "Lodzer gonniff"

Al Rosof (9.005) asked about the expression "lodzer goniff" or "zlodjeh
gonniff."  The Yiddish expression is probably connected with the fact that
Polish-speakers native to Lodz say

        Jestem z miasta Lodz.  (I am from the city of Lodz.)

rather than
        
        Jestem z Lodzi.  (I am from Lodz.)

because the latter sounds like

        Jestem zlodziej.  (I am a thief.)

particulary in those dialects of Polish where an /e/ that was historically
a long vowel fell together with /i/.

Subject: Lodzer Gonif un khrain

In Mendele, Vol 09.005 Morris Fish asks about the origin of "khrain".  It
comes from the Russian "Khren" - horseradish. 
  
Al Rasof asks about the Yiddish expression"Lodzer Gonniff" and "Zlodjeh
Gonniff".  There was (and is) a Polish play of words involving the name of
the industrial city Lodz'.  If somwebody said in Polish "Yestem z Lodzi" 
i.e., I am from Lodz' it could sound like "Yestem zlodzei".  "Zlodzei" in
Polish stands for a thief, and joksters would add to the "Lodz" two letters
"ej" to make it the Polish "zlodziej" (read zlodzei), hence the Yiddish
"Lodzer Ganev" if you listen to a Litvak or "Lodzer Gonniff" if you speak
Centrral-Polish Yiddish.

Subject: Yiddish theater

I have been trying to find an English translation of a popular Yiddish
theater variation of the Merchant of Venice, which I believe went by the
title of either "The Tragedy of Shylock" or "Shylock and His Daughters."  I
am trying to get one of our local small Dallas theaters interested in
producing it rather than its annual Shakespeare production for the 2000-2001
season, and think that they might do it.  Can you tell me where I might get
a translation? 

Thanking you in advance,

Tom Timmons

Subject: Nitl (yet again)

A slight correction to Bob Rothstein's very interesting contribution on
Nitl (Mendele Vol 09.004)

        Simen 271:  Vorum mir lernen nit in di nakht fun "tkufes-
        teyves" velkhe mir rufn di nakht "nitl"?

Hot Bob fartaytsht:

        Why we don't study [Torah] on the winter night that we call
        "nitl" [Christmas]?

"tkufes-teyves" is of course  the very specific night preceding the winter
solstice. (Calculated as 25 December by the Catholics and 6 January by the
Orthodox church)
