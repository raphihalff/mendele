Monday, Jan. 22, the Yiddish world lost an important activist and teacher.  
Marion (Miriamke) Herbst of Los Angeles passed away after a two year battle 
with the Angel of Death.  Marion was a long time Yiddish teacher, wrote a 
popular textbook for Yiddish, Learning Yiddish in Easy Stages, with Marvin 
Zuckerman, and with Prof. Zuckerman, translated and published three large 
volumes of the Yiddish classics of Mendele, Peretz, and Sholem Aleichem.   We 
will greatly miss Marion's joyfulness, enthusiasm and optimiistic view of the 
world.

Subject: Mendl Hoffman

Mendele deeply mourns the passing of Mendl Hoffman, a devoted lifelong
supporter of Yiddish culture. For more than 50 years he was connected to
YIVO, first as a volunteer librarian, then a Board member.  Mendl Hoffman
was an enthusiast of Yiddish computing and internet and provided important
moral support for early Yiddish web projects. We extend heartfelt
condolences to his wife Miriam and son Avi, both active Yiddishists and
Mendele subscribers.

Subject: Shpandungen

I am translating a Yiskor book from Kremenets , Ukraine and have not been
able to find the translation for this word on the web nor in 2 Yiddish, 2
Hebrew and one German dictionary. Can any scholar out there help?

The word is: shpandungen  
Shin, pe, ayen, nun, daled, vuv, nun, gimel, ayen, nun sofit.

It occurs in this sentence: "shpandungen fun oysland".

(How I  wish we all could use the Yiddish fonts. I really dislike these
transliterations.)

Subject: "shifke shiva shifkes"

As a yiddishist and an active english-french-hebrew translator, I have
often wondered if I could get translations from or into Yiddish. I would
be delighted to be entrusted with relevant tasks.

A relative of mine in France, who doesn't have the slightest idea of
Yiddish, naively sent me a few Yiddish poems, hand-written by an unknown
poet who was presumably murdered. The question was whether I could
translate them into French. Someone had discovered the poems in a
concentration camp. The handwriting per se was already difficult to read
and time had blurred many words and phrases. Nevertheless, I decided to
take up the challenge, benevolently for my relative, as a personal homage
to the lost Yiddish culture during the Shoah. So far, I have managed to
reconstitute and translate one poem.

In the second one that I am working on, there is an expression which I
never heard before and I am trying to see if others have. It is: "shifke
shiva shifkes", most probably something like an ironic appreciation of a
sheiner yid, dressed up like a gvir. It says exactly: "... a sheiner yid,
shifke shiva shifkes, dos beichel zeins...".  Please, have you an answer
to suggest?

Subject: words in early Yiddish

I am attempting to translate a very early letter in Yiddish, probably
written before 1460 in Austria. There are three words whose meaning I
can't even guess at.

bet,vav,resh,bet,shin.
quf,resh,yod,tet,lamed,yod,nun.
alef,yod,quf,lamed,yod,khaf,resh,nun.

If I have named the letters incorrectly in Yiddish, forgive me.
If anyone has any ideas as to the meaning of those words I would really 
appreciate them letting me know.

Thanks,
Cheryl Tallan

Subject: rafael un sheyndele

I assume that the 'Rafael un Sheyndele' referred to in Jenny Levison's query 
are the Yiddish counterparts to Romeo and Juliet in Nokhem Rakov's _Di shvue 
baym seyfer-toyre, oder di yidishe romeo un yulie_.  Rakov cleverly turns 
Romeo into the son of a Hasidic rebbe, while Sheyndele's father is a staunch 
misnagid. The balcony scene takes place in the Hasidic shul after services 
on Hoshana Rabbah, with Sheyndele standing upstairs in the women's section 
as Rafael woos her from below.

Al-dos guts,

Subject: Zhitlowsky vs. American Yiddish?

Dear Mendelyaner,
        
A question:  in H. L. Mencken's _The American Language_, he writes that
""though Dr. Zhitlowsky and his fellow Yiddishists may rail against [the]
potato-chicken-kitchen language . . . it is the Yiddish of the
overwhelming majority of American Jews" (634).  Mencken is basing his
position here on that of Abraham Cahan, who was also an advocate of
accepting the anglicisms in American Yiddish.  My question concerns
Zhitlowsky.  I assume this is the famous Chaim Zhitlowsky.  But does
anyone have any idea where Zhitlowski expresses a position _against_ the
sort of American Yiddish Cahan and Mencken defend?
        
A dank, 
Larry Rosenwald

Subject: references on the history of Jewish publishing

Tayere kolegie,

I'm working on a study of Soviet Yiddish publishing, and have been trying 
to find material that charts the history of Yiddish language publishing in 
Eastern Europe in general.  I'm particularly interested if anyone has done 
work on the development of a Yiddish publishing industry in 19th century 
Warsaw, Vilna, and other Eastern European cities (less interested in 
American Yiddish publishing, although those references would be useful as 
well).

Any suggestions on where to begin?

Subject: On the need for Yiddish braille

RE: Vivian Aldridge's recent post about Yiddish braille, and his/her 
search for a Yiddish braille code, let me note that the Jewish Braille 
Institute in New York City -- I don't have the address handy, but from 
memory it is 110 East 30th Street, New York, NY  10016 -- would be a 
good agency to contact.  The JBI - where I worked as Assistant to the 
Library Director and then Manager of Library Services in the mid 1980s - 
 was instrumental in the solidification of Hebrew Braille years ago.  
When I had at one time inquired about Yiddish Braille, it was explained 
to me that Hebrew Braille was being developed at about the same time as 
the Yiddish-reading and speaking communities of Europe were being 
decimated during the Holocaust, and the declining numbers of blind and 
visually-impaired Yiddish readers and speakers made it a relatively low 
priority to develop Yiddish braille as distinct from Hebrew braille.

I'd strongly recommend any efforts to develop a distinctive Yiddish 
braille be done in consultation with the Jewish Braille Institute as 
well as the Central Library for the Blind, Visually Impaired and 
Handicapped in Israel, as the JBI has more than a little insight into 
the complexities of braille in general, Hebrew in specific. 

The Jewish Braille Institute is one of the world's largest repository of 
material in Braille, large-type and on cassette, including a very 
wide/diverse collection of material in Yiddish on tape/cassette.  
Material from the JBI is available free-of-charge to any blind, 
visually-impaired or learning-disabled individual, regardless of 
ethnicity or religion, and regardless of location anywhere in the world. 
 As people "here" may know, through international agreement, mail to and 
from blind individuals anywhere in the world is free-of-charge. 

As to the specific questions, the JBI should know if there is any 
established Yiddish braille alphabet, of producers of Yiddish braille or 
individual publications or documents in Yiddish braille. Frankly, I 
think not.  In any event, it's clear that there's no point in 
re-inventing something that's up and going.

More to the point, it is not clear that at this point in time there is 
significant need for a distinctive Yiddish braille.  The only 
communities and individuals who, on first consideration, might need or 
make use of Yiddish braille would be hasidic individuals in communities 
in the U.S., Israel and elsewhere where Yiddish is their first language. 
 Further, if the majority of the potential "users" of Yiddish braille 
are older or elderly individuals, with a low possibility of learning 
braille of any kind, it would be an exercise in futility or, rather an 
academic exercise, to try and develop a new - or further develop and old 
-  Yiddish braille code. 

I would strongly recommend against anyone who by their own admission 
states their "knowledge of Yiddish is limited and  knowledge of Hebrew 
extremely rudimentary (hardly more than word recognition)" attempting to 
devise a new or distinctive braille code.  At best, it would make sense 
to try and share information between the agencies in the U.S, such as 
the Jewish Braille Institute, and their colleague agencies in Israel, 
Europe and elsewhere -- assuming for a moment that the need exists. 

As to the formulation of "ten points for discussion," again, someone who 
is not fluent in Yiddish - and I would say Hebrew as well - probably 
should reconsider being in the vanguard of the development of Yiddish 
braille.

The Jewish Braille Institute in New York, and the agencies in Israel 
that try to serve the needs of blind and visually impaired in that 
country, as well as other agencies around the world, but those two come 
to mind first, certainly can use the assistance of volunteers in their 
ongoing work to record books and other material in Yiddish, so that 
people can have access to the riches in Yiddish - finction and 
non-fiction, religious and political and other material.  Mendele people 
can provide a true mitzvah were those interested in serving the needs of 
blind, visually impaired and learning disabled individuals who want to 
have access to Yiddish material help to add to trhe master tapesalready 
on shelves in New York and Israel, and publicize their availability to 
potential users in their local communities.
