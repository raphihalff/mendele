Subject: Jews of Marienbad

Sholem Aleichem did indeed write a novel, an epistolary novel, about
Marienbad.  It is a fascinating work.  Strangely enough, I find some
interesting parallels between it and the eighteenth-century novel
Humphrey Clinker by Tobias Smollett, which has a great deal to do with
goings on at the Marienbad-like resort of Bath.

Subject: SA's Marienbad

To Pavel M-C:

Marienbad was one of the spas frequented by wealthy Jews and endowed
Hassidic`tsadikim. SA's novel "Marienbad" was translated by Aliza Shevrin
into English a few years ago. It depictswith customary irony the foibles
and "romantic" complications of bourgeoise provincial Jews in a classy
resort. Jane Austen and Bath is not so far-fetched an analogy.

Subject: 'jewess'

To: Dan Leeson

i am certainly not defending philologus, but i do think one might react
differently from the way you did to the forward's use of 'jewess'. i
personally am quite confident that there was no anti-semitic intent on
the part of the newspaper! and there is nothing INHERENTLY anti-semitic
in the term, or even anything intentionally or inherently anti-female. as
i see it, the term is simply out of style (not p.c., as it's called by
some), along with a host of other female-suffix terms, and to know that
and still use it conveys that one doesn't give a hoot and therefore that
one is quite happy to be thought of as a sexist. i suspect strongly that
this was not the intention of the newspaper and that they simply did not
know. (the english, especially in headlines, is often distinctly
non-native, if not to say ill-formed.) perhaps it would have been more
effective to simply write to the editor and tell him how this term is
received by many people today. a similar case, to my mind, that crops up
in other english-language newspapers is 'wailing wall'--if i think the
writer (christian or jew) doesn't know that this is a christian point of
view of what jews look like when they're praying, i try to point it out
to them and suggest they adopt 'western wall'; if i think they DO know
but still use it, i scream and/or stop reading their stuff.

From: MASH@WEIZMANN.WEIZMANN.AC.IL
Subject: Jewess

Both my knowledge of English and alas also of Yiddish was not acquired as
a  first language.  I  am thus at  complete loss to  understand the
terrible crime of the Forward for  using the word Jewess as complained
about  so bitterly  by Dan  Leeson.  For  me, in  spite of  Sir Walter
Scott, I see  nothing so terrible in  that word, nor am  I offended by
the use of Jew and this in spite of Shakespeare.

In German  Jude and Juedin  are normally  used, and using  "Germans of
Mosaic religion" is something much more offensive to my ears.  Also in
Hebrew  both Yehudi  and Yehudiya  are quite  respectable.  I  am well
aware  that  the  term  Jew  in  either gender  was  and  is  used  by
antisemites in a derogatory way, but  we can not live by their vicious
criteria.

I have intention in the above  to express an opinion about Philologos, as
I know nothing about him but what I read in Mendele.

Subject: Kurve; Jewess

[Ongekomen an ander briv fun philologn. nm]

Before Edward Stankiewicz criticizes any more columns of mine in the
Forward for journalistic irresponsibility, he might take a course in
reading comprehension. He writes to complain that in my June 24th column
on the word *kurve*, I (1) give a fanciful Yiddish/Hebrew etymology for
it; (2) ignore the fact that the the word is widespread in Slavic lang-
uages. In fact, I explicity pointed out in the column that the suggested
derivation of *kurve* from Hebrew *kurvah* is highly doubtful, and that
the word is found not only in Yiddish, but in Polish, Ukrainian, and Rus-
sian. As for my statement in the column that *kurve* has no clear Slavic
etymology - since Prof. Stankiewicz makes do with telling us that the
Slavic etymon is a word denoting the sexual prowess of birds without in-
forming us what this word is or how and when it came to mean a
prostitute, I will for the time being have to stand by what I said. I
leave it to the readers of Mendele to judge which of us has been
irresponsible.

Concerning Dan Leeson's posting about "Jewess" I'd like to point out to
him that I wrote an entire column on the subject, occasioned by an
earlier use of the word in the Forward, which appeared several months
before I received his letter. And it might please him to know that,
although I am generally very politically incorrect in my opinions, in
this particular case I explained why I thought "Jewess" was an
unfortunate word and one to avoid in contemporary usage. I am sorry for
my negligence in not answering Mr. Leeson's letters.

Subject: lamed-fe-kuf

the tayerer shames must be having conniptions because this ain't about
yiddish either, but...can someone tell me what lamed-fe-kuf means/stands
for? someone told me it was an abbreviation for l'kudat 'by the command
of', but couldn't explain the fe. can anybody help? a dank aykh.

Subject: the dual form

I was surprised to learn here in Mendele that in some Yiddish dialects a
dual form continues to exist. I therefore made inquiries among the older
Yiddish speaking congregants in Shul this morning. An elderly scholarly
lady formerly from Lodz, a graduate from a prominant Lodzer Yiddish
gymnazium, who survived the holocaust with a partisan unit in the forests
surrounding the city, informed me that she knew the dual form "enk" but
that in her local dialect they used a variant dual form "oon" which she
spelled for me:  aleph vov lange nun. She thought that this usage was
rather widespread in an area extending over to neighboring regions of
Russia and Lithuania.  She was quite explicit in distinguishing the
subjective dual "oon" from the objective plural "unz".

As this is all very new to me I would be most interested if others are
familiar with this word and the extent of its usuage. Also how would
verbs conjugate with the dual form? (I neglected to pursue this point
with my informant.)

Subject: translation

  I agree with Wolitz, Zazulyer, and Rosenwald that the going
translations from Yiddish need to be looked at more closely. With regard
to the Penguin anthology, it seems odd that the standard format of the
Penguin anthologies (of French, Spanish, Russian, Hebrew, Latin, etc)
give the original with (at the bottom of the page) 'literal prose
translations', whereas the Yiddish anthology ('of modern Yiddish verse')
has featured on facing pages (what they call in India) 'transcreations' -
I am not using the term as a compliment -  in large part.
