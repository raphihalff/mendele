Subject: Di mame dertseylt

The ballad sought by Josh Backon is "Di mame dertseylt" by Jacob Adler
(pen-name, B. Kovner), which is included in Chane and Yosl Mlotek's
collection "Pearls of Yiddish Song," pp. 96-97. It begins

       Es hot mir mayn mame dertseylt, az a mol
       Geshtanen a shtibl iz tif in a tol,
       A gortn baym shtibl geven iz tseblit,
       Gevoynt hot in shtibl an erlekher yid.

The last stanza is

       Oyf morgn geven iz der himl fartsogt,
       Dos vintl baym taykhl hot kadish gezogt.
       Dos vintl tsum ershtn - ir tate tsu letst,
       Es hot zikh der tate bald shive gezetst.

Subject:  Same name for mother-in-law and daughter-in-law

I remember hearing the song a long time ago and I asked my mother why a
girl could not marry a man if his mother had the same name as she did. In
the Ashkenazi tradition one does not name a child after a living person.
Thus, if mother-in-law and daughter-in-law had the same name, it would not
be possible to name a grand-daughter after the mother-in-law.  My mother
told me that her sister had this problem. But the young couple were in love
and they got married anyway.

Very interesting.  How far back does it go?  Is it restricted to modern
Times or does it go back to antiquity?  Where might one get a copy?

Subject: shvarkes

An eastern Polish friend of mine recalls his father mentioning, perhaps
humorously, "gebrotene tayblekh mit shvarkes" as a delicious course of a
meal. Roasted squab I know, but what are shvarkes? My informant is sure it
wasn't shvomen/shvemlekh, etc. Can someone please enlighten us as to the
meaning? And does anyone have a recipe for it?

Subject: Nasal spray

[Moderator:  the following postings were submitted over two consecutive
days.]

Today, I went to have a physical examination, and my doctor, held up a vial
of Afrin Nasal Spray and asked me what this meant in Yiddish. It appears
that his father is soon to have an 80th birthday party and, as a person who
worked in pharmaceutical distribution, he knew the inventor of the Afrin
formula.  That inventor was a Yiddish-speaking Jew, and had told the
doctor's father that he derived this name from Yiddish.

For a while this was a puzzlement, but in tossing the sounds over in my
mind, it finally came clear: the inventor took the name for this nasal
decongestant from the phrase "auf rinnen," which appears to be a straight
lift from the German.

A simple translation would be "to facilitate flow." This seems to be a very
appropriate mitl for an ongeshtoptn noz.

Folks,

It amazes me how sometimes obvious things just elude the mind when the
focus is misdirected.  I woke up this morning bolt upright, struck by a
flash of recognition that made me say to myself, "Why the hell didn't I
think of this in the first place?"

My physician was groping along with me for something that had to do with
"the nose." I took his information about the Yiddish-speaking inventor a
bit too literally, and was also led away by his own probing of the "rin"
suffix as a possible variant on the prefix "rhin," which is from the Latin,
meaning nose.  What hit me was simply this: As a Yiddish-speaker, the
inventor most surely had a basic facility with Hebrew, especially if he was
born in the Old World (I do not know this for sure). Accordingly, an
equally valid view of his construct would be Af - rinne, in which "Af" is
the Hebrew word for nose.  In this case, an interpretation my be "Nose -
channel," or "Nose-flow," the latter being a very close alignment with
"Nasal Spray."

I cannot vouch for either of the two interpretations here, since I lack
certain facts. However, if my physician's reference to the word "Nose" is
indicative, it is this latter construct that seems the more likely.

Subject:  Yiddish food terms sought

My friend and colleague Monika Adamczyk-Garbowska of Marie Curie-Sklodowska
University in Lublin, who is spending this year doing research at the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum, has translated two Bilgoraj yizker-bikher. Three
apparent references to food have stumped her and the various knowledgeable
people whom she has consulted. They are (with her indications of context)

       1. valakhes (berries - perhaps blueberries or wild cranberries) 2.
       nant (an item in the basket next to chickpeas and pumpkin seeds) 3.
       poplinkes (children taking freshly baked ones to kheyder).

I've checked various Yiddish and Slavic dictionaries and other sources, but
the only thing I could come up with was the use of "valakhi" in some East
Slavic dialect(s) to refer to marigolds (the flower). Can anyone help?

Subject: teytl

One of Itzik Manger's "Khumesh-lider," the one about the three angels who
come to visit Avrom avinu, begins as follows:  "Avrom avinu zitst af der
shvel, / un shnitst zikh a teytl fun beyn."   My dictionaries (Weinreich,
Niborski) identify "teytl" as a pointer, and Niborski goes as far as
specifying, "baguette servant  guider la lecture."  What I'm wondering is,
is Avrom avinu getting ready to leyn Torah (certainly possible in the world
of Manger's poems)?  Or were there secular uses for such pointers as well?
Did eastern European Jews read Gorky, say, or Sholem Aleichem with a teytl?

Best, and thanks,

Larry Rosenwald
