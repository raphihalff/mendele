Subject: Transliterating dialect

I'm not sure I agree with Sol Jaffe, who suggests writing "Vays ikh
vues!" to convey a non-YIVO dialect. I would prefer to retain the YIVO
spelling, and simply understand that (for me) it's pronounced
differently. Thus, I write "veys ikh vos" and pronounce it much as Sol's
example.

In other words, "ey" is not necessarily pronounced as in "they". For a
southern Yiddish dialect, "ey" is pronounced as in "thy". And "ay" is
pronounced approximately "aa".

This is no different than an Australian writing the name of his country
as "Australia", even though he pronounces it "Austrilia".

[In WWII, an injured American soldier is evacuated to an Australian
medical barracks. He wakes up after a long period and says to the nurse,
"I supposed I've been brought here to die." She replies, "No, mite.
Yesterdie."]

Subject: Skotsl kumt: a correction

In my posting "skotsl kumt" I made an error: it was the royter *momzer*
(don't know correct transliteration for vowel-less words) not the royter
gonif.  When my mother was a small child she was caught helping herself
to baked apples stashed on a high shelf by a baby-sitting relative who
called her "du reyte (litvak style pronunciation) gonif" -- my mother
could never understand why "reyte" since she was a blonde.  Is it a stock
expression, perhaps related to being caught "red-handed"?

I should have mentioned that the date on the Forward that mentions
"skatsl kumt" was 1897.

Whew!, that's better!

This etymology you may find in Immanuel Olsvanger`s "Rosinkes mit
Mandlen". I copied it just for the benefit of all Mendelniks who do not
have this wonderful book.

Subject: Literary translation project

I introduced myself a few weeks back as a Doctoral Candidate in
Comparative Studies at SUNY Stony Brook.  I will be giving a short paper
at this year's MLA Conference on problems of translating multilingual
immigrant source texts, and I would greatly appreciate your knowledge and
experience in helping me to select an appropriate translating project.  I
am particularly interested in two possible projects:

I would very much like to work on Morris Rosenfeld's play, "Rent Strayk,"
a two-scene one-act in volume 2 of the 1912 Forverts edition of
Rosenfeld's works. My second choice is Jacob Gordin's satire, "Iezus
Kristus un Karl Marx tzu gast in New York," in volume 2 of the Hebrew
Publishing Co.'s 1910 edition of the complete works.

There are many other possibilities, however, does anyone know of a
substantial reason why I shouldn't choose one of these works? (e.g.,
someone out there is already translating them, the rights have been sold
until the year 3000, etc.) Please let me know, because with so many
authors worthy of translation into English, and so few translators, it
doesn't make any sense for two people to be translating the same work, or
to produce an unpublishable translation.

Thank you.

Subject: The Golem and municipal bonds

The July 24th edition of the Bond Buyer newspaper, a trade newspaper for
the US municipal bond industry, had a wonderful headline that caught my
eye:

NatCity Hires McDonald's Golem as Inquiry Continues

Knowing the author of the article I can vouch that the double meaning of
this headline was purely unintentional.  It has neither to do with
McDonalds hamburgers nor the Golem.  NatCity is an investment banking and
brokerage firm that highered a Mr. Dennis Golem as a managing director.

What is the history of the word golem - or geylem as we litvaks pronounce
it - in both Hebrew and Yiddish?

Subject: Indexing Mendele

Full text searches and searches of the Table of Contents are wonderful
things, but they're not the same as an index.  I do a lot of indexing in
my field (Canadian tax law -- I index the Income Tax Act and numerous
other publications), and a good index should be far better than any
full-text search.

The problem with electronic searching is that you don't know exactly what
to search for. This problem is magnified many times over on Mendele
because of all the different ways you can find things spelled.  Imagine
searching for Sholem Aleykhem and missing the posts that spelled it
(albeit "wrongly") Aleichem.  Not to mention hitting all the posts that
referred to the name in some peripheral context.

A good index can be scanned rather than just searched.  There are only so
many top-level entries, after all.

A good index to Mendele will group all the discussion of a given topic
together, and will also provide information as to the content of those
posts -- where possible, a 1-3 word summary showing which way the post is
headed. It will also group all the discussion of a topic under one
heading, and provide many multiple cross-references from all the synonyms
under which someone might look, whether or not those synonyms were used
in the actual posts. And, of course, if a synonym was used, it will still
cross-reference to the main entry even though that main entry term didn't
appear in the post.

It's not a trivial job, with four years of posts (how many megabytes is
that, Noyekh?).  [about 9]  But I bet it could be a masters' thesis
project for a grad student somewhere.

Subject: Nit(e)l

I liked Mikhl Herzog`s attempt to derive "nitel" from the hebrew root TLH
and I would be tempted to accept it but I am afraid I cannot, it is much
too flimsy and the comparison with the absurd etymology of the german
"Heirat" from the hebrew "harey at (mekudeshet li etc.) goes back to him
as a boomerang.

While it is correct that "nitle" (p. nitla) is the hebrew for "hanged",
it is the dynamic passive form in the meaning: "is being (resp. has been)
hanged", it is just the static "pa`ul" form which was used in jewish
medieval literature instead of the name of Jesus - "ha-tsaluv" (the
crossed one) or "ha-taluyi" (the hanged one).

From "ha-taluyi" till "Nitl", in earlier Yiddish "nitel" it is quite a
long way. Moreover, the root TLH has the "tav" and "nitl" the "tet".
There is quite often a shifting of vowels in jewish languages but seldom
between consonants like "tet" and "tav".

Siegmund Wolf traces "nitel" already in the writings of Moses Isserles
(1520-1572) and with most authorities sustains the etimology from the
spanish and porttugese "natal" resp. provencal "nadal",  latin "natalis".
Note the word came also into the hebrew: Even Shoshan Dictionary, citing
Agnon.

Samuel Rappaport, Vienna gives (in "Juedisches Lexikon") another popular
etymology for "nitl", being an abbreviation of "nit jiden toren lernen" -
Jews are not allowed to learn or study on this day (Christmas). It is an
old Minhag (custom) not to study (the Tora) on this day because of the
popular christian belief, Jesus may have rest if the Jews study.
