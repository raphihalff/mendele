Subject: video of Hadassah Kestin reciting "In varshaver geto iz itst khoydesh nisn"

Khaverim,

As we experience these weeks between Pesakh and the Memorial of the Warsaw Ghetto
Uprising, there couldn't be a better way to experience both their meaning and their
message than watching this video of Hadassah Kestin performing, in Los Angeles 1990,
her husband Binem Heller's famous poem:

"In Varshaver geto iz itst khoydesh nisn" af yidish  (Pesakh has come to the Warsaw
Ghetto)

http://youtu.be/lFuLHM8QT_0

The Los Angeles Yiddish Culture Club on YouTube is still in it's infancy, but thanks to
Henry Slucki videotaping this performance of Hadassah while on her one-woman tour,
we have an amazing document of a performance that is literally jumping out of my
computer.

I can't wait to do any fine-tuning to make this announcement.

Electrifying. Painful. Uplifting. Brutal.

There are no words.

Hadassah Kestin, lost to us in her prime, was a graduate of both the Yiddish Theatre in
Warsaw and the Ohel Theatre in Tel Aviv. She spent over 20 years performing her one-
woman shows to the delight of audiences in North America, Europe, Israel, and
Australia.

"(she had) the remarkable ability to paint a picture and bring it to life through her
dramatic interpretation of Yiddish prose and poetry...."

You will never hear a more authentic, poignant interpretation of this brutal poem.

We have 5 full performances of Hadassah in Los Angeles, as well as 150 precious
meetings of the "Los Angeles Yiddish Culture Club" shot by the dedicated videographer
Miki Safadi, which I have digitized and am preparing to make available online, and from
which we will post as many as possible as soon as possible.
This is an incredible treasure.

Mendelyaner who know Russian may like to explore the very lengthy list of films and
film clips on Jewish subjects, many of Yiddish interest, and all available to watch at the

Subject: Ahava Raba recording

I am trying to find a recording of a cantor singing the Ahava Raba prayer using the scale
that klezmer musicians call freygish: C, D-flat, E, F, G, A-flat, B-flat, C.

Thank you.

Subject: On Line Translation of (Most of) Hillel Zeitlin's Book on R. Nachman of
Breslov

Hello,

I am pleased to announce an on-line translation from Yiddish to English of 2/3 of Hillel
Zeitlin's book on Rebbe Nachman of Breslov.  You may find it at
http://www.shulman-writer.com/rabbi-nachman--hillel-zeitlin.html .
(The original is at http://archive.org/details/nybc200230 ).

As you may know, Hillel Zeitlin was a famed journalist and baal teshuvah in Warsaw,
Poland, before World War II (he was murdered in the war).

I made this translation a few years ago. Reading about Paulist Press's issuing of an
anthology of the writings of Hillel Zeitlin gave me the impetus to make my translation
freely available.

If you know of any publisher who would like to put this book out in paper or of any
backer who would like to help sponsor my completion of this work, kindly let me know.

Subject: Dr. K-EL

Responding to Eli Rosenblatt's query concerning the identity of one D. K-EL:

According to Otsar biduye ha-shem [Pseudonymen-Lexikon der hebr√§ischen und
jiddischen Literatur], by Saul Chajes (Vienna, 1933), this is the Yiddish author Dovid
Kasel [cited in some library catalogs as Kassel, David, 1881-1935].
