ikh nit fun di groyse trinkers un efsher derfar oykh nit fun di groyse
toasters un khuts "lekhayim" ken ikh nit di "toast terminologie." Efsher
zaynen do tsvishn aykh gresere mumkhim af dem gebit vos kenen mir zogn vi
azoy, mit vos far a verter, makht men a "toast" af Yidish? A sheynem dank.
Oyb ir hot an eytse, zayt azoy gut un lozt bald visn.

I find myself in the position of having to make a toast in Yiddish to
celebrate our rabb's 25th anniversary as rabbi at our shul. I seem to be
toast challenged and only know "Lechayim." Can anyone suggest other toasting
terms? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please write me at
sczucker@aol.com.

Subject: Re: shnorer, betler, yovn

Perhaps a primary distinction twixt shnorer and betler is that the shnorer
manages, whereas the betler cannot manage.  Another distinction is how one
interacts with a shnorer versus a betler.  Men ret mit a shnorer, ober tsu a
betler.

Mechl Asheri mentions the shnorer who comes to his door regularly. Contrast
that with streetcorner beggars, who are helpless, clueless, choiceless, and
but for their expressions of need, voiceless.  A shnorer has self-assurance,
a bettler lacks even that much. A shnorer hot kuntsn un kvod, ober a bettler
iz nebekh bekhol. To the list of possible English equivalents, let me add
mooch, moocher, and finagler.

Vulf Plotkin's contention that yovn was an appelation for soldiers actually
also lends credence to the theory that the word derives from Ivan.  In many
European tongues, John is a term for any Tom, Dick, and Harry, eg: John Bull
and John Company, Jan Alleman and Jan Soldaat (Dutch: everyman and the
common soldier respectively), Les Jeans et le Jacquerie (French: the peasant
rabble), and also, remarkably, in American English the word Ivan for the
average Russian or the Russian everyman.

[Note also Yankee, from Jan Kaas or Jan Kaes (John Cheese), the term for the
Dutch settlers in New York, and a snarky referent for Hollanders in general
(which still survives in Flemish as 'Kaaskop' - cheesehead).]

Nevertheless, I believe that yovn probably did originally mean Greek.
Compare Sanskritic Yuvanna / Yavanna and derivatives thereof in Indian and
Indonesian languages (Yuwana, Yawan, Yuon barbarian, outsider, invading
Greek soldiers during Alexander's time), and the word Yunani in several
Muslim languages - all meaning Greek, Ionian, foreign.   Note also
correspondence of stress and meanings.  I also suspect that Ivan would've
been pronounced 'ivn' in yiddish.

A couple years ago there was a Paris klezmer band called the Orient Express
Moving Shnorers. They finally changed their name because they decided it had
unfortunate implications.

Subject: Re: shnor/shnoder

There is an interesting combination of the words shnorn and nadern. In many
synagogues the honors of being called to the Torah were auctioned off and
people "nadert", that is promised to donate sums of money. Sometimes the
auctioning off of the honors was so crass, that when someone promised to
nader it was said that he "shnodert", that is, he had been cajoled into
making the donation.

Mechl Asheri
Re: _meshulakh_, see the classic Yiddish film _Der Dibbuk_. The _meshulakh_
in question is central to the plot and can hardly be described as a
_shnorer_.

M. Abrams
Re: _ferd-ganovim_. It was quite customary to designate the inhabitants of
cities and _shtetlekh_ by (often) disparaging nicknames-- _Adeser zhulikes_
(Odessa), and numerous others.

The archives of the Yiddish Atlas at Columbia University, in New York, lists
several hundred. If I get the chance, some day, I'll check the files and
post the list om Mendele.

Meyer Zaremba
Re: _yovn_. Applies to a Russian (i.e. specifically, Greek Orthodox)
soldier.

Martin Green
The word seems to be related to _t'aam_ 'taste'.

Re: the lowly meshulekh as shnorer: compare to the meshulekh in the
Dybbuk..that's the term there, no?   Perhaps an irony, that meshulekh is
just about in the league of elyenove.

Subject: matem zayn

The word that Martin Green (Mendele 13.022) found in Peretz's "Monish",
spelled mem-tes-ayin-yud (and pronounced "matem") is no misprint.  "Matem
zayn", though not in Weinreich,  can be found in Yitzkhok Niborski's
Yiddish-French dictionary and in his indispensable Verterbukh fun
loshn-koydesh-shtamike verter in yidish.  In the latter it is defined as
"batonen, aktsentirn"--i.e. "stress, accentuate".

Subject: Re: matem

Regarding Martin Green's query about a word in "Monish", "metayim", mem tes
ayin yud mem, is probably _not_ a typo but refers to chanting musically. Cf.
"teamim", the Hebrew word for what we know more commonly as "trop".

Subject: Re: matem

mat'im zayn means to stress, to pronounce carefully (to put the ta'am) . It
appears in Niborsky's excellent Yiddish-French dictionary, but neither in
Weinreich nor Harkavy.
