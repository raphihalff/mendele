Subject: "Yoshke pandre"

It may be but folk etymology, but in my family "pandre" (or
something like that) was explained as derived from French "pendu,"
i.e. hanged, which is to say, approximately, crucified.

Subject: another folk saying fin mayne meshpokhe

Es vet helfn azoy vee a toytn baynks

that is to say: It won't help at all.

"baynks" are a folk remedy in which a vacuum is created in small
thick glasses using an alcohol flame an then placed directly on the
skin of the sufferer. The vacuum causes the flesh to rise inside the
glass.

I've had this remedy performed on me as a child with bronchitis.

Subject: Jerusalem Network One

I would contribute volumes and volumes to the discussion, and loads
and loads of encouragement, but I don't have a clear picture of what
Jerusalem Network One is, nor of what the Knesset is interested in
doing with/for Yiddish.  Mr. Lando, kindly provide us with more
information as this sounds to be of great importance.

Subject: Yiddish on Jerusalem One

I've had luck introducing young people to 50 Yiddish words they
can't live without. This rudimentary list will hopefully prevent the
embarassment of young Jews everyehere thinking that "nachas" is a
corn chip.

I'd like the network to supply to all of its subscribers "access" to
keeping essential Yiddish words and concepts alive. It would also be
helpful if such a network will let subscribers know of events and
teachers in their respective areas to further attachments to
yiddish. The promise of the communications revolution is providing
access to the countless individuals who have not found "community"
easily. No computer network, however, will ever substitute for a
flesh and blood teacher.

Moshe Waldoks

P.S. Ignatz Bernshtayn published an addendum to his collection of
"yidishe shprichverter". It was a collection of "Oysgelassene
shprichverter" that explodes the notion that Jewish and Yiddish
earthiness is a result of the Yiddish encounter with America at the
turn of the century.

Subject: labazan

My father z"l used to use the word labazan to refer to an large,
oafish person ("he's just a labazan who can't get a suit to fit
him").  I'm unable to find this word in the dictionary.  Does anyone
know anything about it?  Many thanks.
