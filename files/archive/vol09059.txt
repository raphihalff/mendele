Subject: Introduction

Dear Mendele,

my name is Maurizio (Maurice), I am an Italian statistician working at
University of Bologna, Italy.  I am really fascinated by Yiddish culture,
and I am very glad to have found this mailing list. I was born in 1961 in
Bologna, but my mother came from Fiume (now Rijeka, Croatia), a town
which
changed Country 5 times during the XX Century (Hungary, Free State,
Italy,
Yugoslavia, Croatia). My mother always spoke about her multi-cultural
environment, and I always loved such "diversity". I know that Yiddish world
and language contain one of the richest mixes of cultures ever existed. I
have a working knowledge of German, so I can understand a certain
number of
Yiddish expressions. But I would like to improve my contact with this
charming world. First of all, can someone write me the Yiddish translation
of my name, if exists?

Shalom aleichem,
Maurizio Brizzi

Subject: Introduction

My name is Dora Rytman.  I earned my PhD from Brown Univ. in the Dept.
of
Slavic Languages I was born in Poland. During W.W.II I was exiled in the
Soviet Union.  When the war ended I was in D.P. camps in Germany. I
arrived
in the U.S. in 1949 with my husband and eldest child. We moved to our
current Home in Preston, CT shortly after our arrival. A native of Poland I
was raised in Volozhyn (home of the famous Yeshiva)  near Vilna where we
frequently visited. My Yiddish is native and as an adherent of Yivo and the
Max Weinreich tradition, fairly intellectual. I have taught Russian at Brown
Univ., Connecticut College and the Univ. of CT. Presently, I am on the
faculty of the Greenberg Center Judaic Studies at the Univ. of Hartford. As
well as Yiddish of all levels I teach, in rotation, Yiddish Lit. in
translation, The American Jewish Novel and east European writers of Jewish
origin. Included are: Pasternak, Mandelstam, Babel, Kafka, Celan, Nellie
Saks and Appelfeld.

Subject: litvish feminine 

Both Mikhl Herzog's posting and Dovid Braun's response on the tsu DER
mamen/tsu DI mamen in "Litvish" idealize "Litvish" a bit too much
(09.053).
In so far as the Litvish case system is concerned, "Litvish" included not
only the Baltic states and Belarus but the Ukraine as well (at one time this
inclusive area is what _Lite_ meant). By the the beginning of the First
World War, "Real" Litvish was found only in the area to the north of Vilna
-- Yes, even Vilna was no longer "Real" Litvish. The rest of the "Litvish"
area shows the almost complete loss of Litvish case features in the
southern
Ukraine with increasing retention northward.

The "Real" Litvish in the north has _tsu DI mamen_, as Mikhl Herzog noted.
To the south, Litvish has _tsu DER mamen_, as Dovid Braun tells us. But
this
latter usage is pretty inconsistent north of the Ukraine. And it is often
found among speakers who also have "ikh ze der mame(n)", that is, _der
mame_
is both accusative and dative.

I am looking for articles about Esther Kreitman. I would particularly be
interested in items with a feminist perspective. If you respond to me
off-list I'll post a summary of responses.

Thank you,

Subject: "The Gentleman from Buenos Aires"

I am doing research on bertha pappenheim and her struggles against
Jewish
prostitution. Sholem Aleikhem wrote a story, published long after his death
(in 1937), called "The Gentleman from Buenos Aires" (Tsugenumen: A
Mentsh
fun Buenos Aires) published in Dortn, 1937, 36 pages. Does anyone have a
copy, or its availability or familiar with its plot?  Mit hofenung.

Subject: jabberwocky

Does anyone happen to have yiddish words for Lewis Carroll's poem
"Jabberwocky,"  from Alice in Wonderland (or is it Through the Looking
Glass)?  I have them in German and Latin, but they would be delightful in
yiddish!

Subject: The vanished shtetl

Dear friends

I thought some of Mendele's readers may be interested in a new book
published by Five Leaves. It is The Vanished Shtetl: the Paintings of
Stanislaw Brunstein. Brunstein worked as a stage designer with the Scala,
Nowosci and Ida Kaminska Yiddish theatres, and was a scenic artist with
the
Dzigan and Schumacher review. He fled to Russia to escape the German
invasion, but was arrested and imprisoned in the Vorkuta slave labour
camps.
Brunstein was released to join the Polish (Anders) army, coming to Britain
after the war. He worked with the New Yiddish Theatre in London, but could
not make enough of a living as a scenic artist and became a designer of
children's clothes. From 1962 until his death in 1994 he painted many
pictures of "The Vanished Shtetl". Brunstein's shtetl was not romanticised -
the prayer houses and homes were poorly furnished. His shtetl was peoples
by
rabbis, farmers, street traders, workers, water carriers, klezmorim,
shokhtim, shnorrers - a reminder not that six million died, but that these
people lived. As well as the paintings, there is a biographical note, a
further essay on Brunstein as a Jew and a Pole by Dow Marmur and an
essay on
pre-war Poland by Rafael Scharf.

Order details: The Vanished Shtetl is available from Five Leaves
Publications, PO Box 81, Nottingham NG5 4ER, Britain for #10.99/$18 or
from
bookshops (0 907123 87 2).

Thanks

Subject: Yiddish program in Vilnius?

Dear Mendele list:

Last year I heard about a Yiddish immersion program that took place in
Vilnius, Lithuania, headed by Dovid Katz (formerely of Oxford). Does
anyone
know if the program is going forward for the summer of 2000? And how to
enroll, if the program is taking place?

Thanks so much,
Seth Brown

Subject: pukankes 

Jeffrey Shandler asked about pukankes (09.050).  My ex-Moldavian wife
translates "pukankes" as popcorn.
