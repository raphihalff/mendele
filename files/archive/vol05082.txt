Subject: Yidishistn and I.B. Singer

David Herskovic asks (Vol. 5.078) about the non-reverent attitude toward
Isaac Bashevis Singer among "yidishisten"--which could be broadened to
include many Yiddish readers. The reasons for this attitude were very
well described and analyzed by Prof. Eli Katz (a Mendelyaner) in an
essay, "Isaac Bashevis Singer and the Classical Yiddish Tradition," in
_The_ Achievement_of_Isaac_Bashevis_Singer_ed. Marcia Allentuck, So.
Illinois University Press, 1968(?)

Singer's apikorses (heresy) is the very least of any possible reasons for
the attitudes that David Herskovic accurately perceives.

Subject: Mock-Yiddish dialect pop songs

I mention to Joel Rosen that the creation of mock-Yiddish dialect songs
was also accompanied by the creation of mock-Yiddish dialect poems.  When
I was a kid there were books of them and I still remember the words to a
mock-Yiddish version of "The Shooting of Dan McGrew."  Interestingly,
the poem is almost completely in English.  Only occasionally were Yiddish
words or phrases inserted.  The original poem dates from the late 1800s
and, although dated and excessively romanticized, it is a serious poem.
The mock-Yiddish dialect versions were invariably silly or comical or
even stupid.

I also mention that Mickey Katz made many recordings of Yiddishized
versions of popular tunes in the 50s.  These, like the poems mentioned,
were not translations into Yiddish of popular tunes, but were simply sung
in English with a mock Yiddish accent and an occasional word of Yiddish
here and there.  Frankly, I always found them demeaning and insulting,
never amusing or witty.

For example, there was a pop tune called "Ghost Riders In The Sky" that
Frankie Lane made popular.  It had mock whip cracks and a great deal of
pseudo-western cattle-drive sounds.  Well, Katz did a mock-Yiddishized
version of that almost completely in English.  And the reason why it was
done in English was to maximize the marketplace.  If it were done in
Yiddish, he reduced his market.  I remember seeing these recordings of
his on juke boxes.  I became so furious as his popularizations and
bastardizations of these then pop tunes, that I actually tried to
organize a boycott of both him and his products.  It never got off the
ground.

Subject: Korn's _A nay kleyd_

Mikhl Herzog (5.080) is quite right to point out that Rokhl Korn must
have used the noun _leyd_ 'suffering, sorrow' (and not the first-person
verb _layd_ 'suffer') to rhyme with _kleyd_.  It's a rhyme to the ear as
well as to the eye; and anyway, the syntax demands the noun.  A careless
romanization on my part (5.078), which I hope hasn't spoiled the effect
of the delicate lyric for those who've just experienced it for the first
time.

Also in 5.080 Bernard Katz wonders about the translation of _un s'iz a
yeder vays-glezerner knop,/vi a trer ..._  I think the problem is with
the _a_ in _a yeder_.  I don't know what expressions like this are
called, but I take it to mean that the _yeder_ is intensified, so that a
limping translation of lines three and four would be 'and each and every
white-glass button is like a tear...'  (Does this sound right to others?)
_faldn_ must indeed mean 'folds', though as Bernard notes, Weinreich
(like Harkavy) knows only _falb_ for the noun 'fold'.

Here's the poem correctly romanized, together with Ruth Whitman's
non-limping translation:

A nay kleyd                                 A new dress

Ikh hob zikh ongetun haynt,                 Today for the first time
tsum ershtn mol                             after seven long years
nokh zibn lange yor                         I put on
a nay kleyd.                                a new dress.

Nor s'iz tsu kurts far mayn troyer          But it's too short for my grief,
un tsu eng far mayn leyd,                   too narrow for my sorrow,
un s'iz a yeder vays-glezerner knop,        and each white-glass button
vi a trer,                                  like a tear
vos flist fun di faldn arop                 flows down the folds
farshteynert un shver.                      heavy as a stone.

                                            (Stockholm, 1947)

Subject: Yiddish fonts

WordPerfect Hebrew (a supplement to the WordPerfect program) has a
standard keyboard of Hebrew characters, with _all_ Yiddish characters as
selectable alternatives (e.g., double-Yod (with/without patach);
double-Vov; vov-yod).  You can also "force" a kometz-aleph and similar
characters, although they don't show up on the screen as such (perhaps
they do in windows--I'm in DOS).  The only way I was able to get this
program was to call WordPerfect in Utah (there's an 800 number)--no
retailer around here had ever heard of it.

There's also a product called MegaWriter put out by a company in Texas
which includes Latin, Hebrew, Yiddish, Arabic, and Russian keyboards, all
of which may be used at any time in a document by hitting a function key.
I was never able to get it to print on my non-laser printer, and so
returned it to the vendor.  I still have the information about purchasing
it, if you're interested. (The company also advertised that it had the
entire Chumash input in searchable Hebrew text, with nikudos.)
