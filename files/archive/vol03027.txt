Subject:   Taking Stock

In my attempt to observe all Jewish holidays in Sivan, it is time to
admit my sin. Out of ignorance I wasn't aware of Yossi Galron's
bibliography of Sadan's writings. Being somewhat familiar with Yossi's
other works, I have no doubts that this one is also very useful and
thorough. And because many of Sadan's articles appeared in widely
unknown Israeli journals and newspapers, such a bibliography is
extremely important.

But when I dream, I don't like to be limited. What I had in mind is a
complete index to all Sadan's works. Just the two books that are most
important for my interest (Ka'arat egozim and K. tsimukim) contain about
2000 items, and I would estimate, about 500 footnotes. That means 500
topics, hundreds of quotes, references to other books, people,
expressions, words, etc., an incredible wealth of information. From the
technical aspect, with the help of a computer, this wouldn't be too
complicated. One wouldn't even need a highly paid programmer (right,
Khaim? ;-)

I agree with Zachary's miser (sorry, musar 3.17) that it is up to US to
make mendele more diversified. Let me point out, though, that it is more
interesting to read about literature, rather than complaints about the
lack of such postings. It is somewhat peculiar that Zachary did not post
similar encouragement on the now defunct Jewish Librarian network
(Hasafran), or perhaps we will have to wait until he becomes the
president of the association, so that he could use the power of his
office to get people (sorry, librarians) motivated?

Subject: Shprechvertlech

A small contribution to the treasury from the (ever-dimming) memory of
my youth.

1.	My mother was fond of saying to a dinner guest who was not
pulling his weight in consuming sufficient food: es, es, m'vet saiy vi
saiy zogen az d'ost gegesen.  (eat, eat, we'll say that you ate whether
you do or not)

2.	My father was a playful apikoris.  There is a whole literature
of willful mistranslations from the Tanach and the liturgy.  His
favorite was: b'li rayshees, b'li tachlees, dos heyst: es fangt zich nit
awn un es lozt zich nit oys. The hebrew: "b'li rayshees, b'li tachlees"
( without beginning, withoutend) is from Adon Olom (if I recall
correctly) and refers to the infinitude of the almighty.  The Yiddish
"translation" reads "it doesn't begin and it doesn't end", meaning it is
completely invalid.

re _es vet helfn vi A TOYTN BANKES_ being 'frozen', i agree that
syntactically it's alive and kicking--the syntactic form is gapping (cp.
english 'john ate fish and mary meat'), plus the very common yiddish
subject-postposing:

es vet helfn vi bankes helfn a toytn ->
es vet helfn vi bankes       a toytn ->
es vet helfn vi              a toytn bankes

Subject: Translation costs

Translation prices: $15 a page is not too much. That's what I paid three
years ago to graduate students for translating my lectures into French.
$15/hour was what graduate students in computer sciences were being paid
for programming, students in psychology for testing. "Kissing through a
handkerchief," as I.B. Singer called translating, is a task of
comparable difficulty.

Subject: Nekhtiker tog

In Mendele 3.020, Hershel Bershady lists the well-known phrase

> 2) nekhtiger tog (tuhg) -- literally, yesterday's day, meaning,
> impossible.

I have always wondered about the literal explanation "yesterday's day".
Why should this mean anything bad? Yesterday was no worse or better than
any other day.

I'd like to propose, for your reactions, an alternative: that "nekhtik"
is derived from "nakht" (night), so the meaning is "a day like night", a
dark day, not really a day at all.

Aside from making more sense, it is grammatically preferable. The suffix
"-ik" usually brings an umlaut in the preceeding vowel, as in
makht/mekhtik, rekht/rikhtik, etc., when it transforms a noun into an
adjective.  (Does anyone know of any exceptions?) An adjective derived
from nekhtn using -ik would be *nikhtik.  (Actually, I guess it would be
nekhtndik.)
