Subject: Introduction

Hello, my name is Moish Mlotek and I am a new subscriber on this network.
I would love to receive Mendele messages so that I can keep up with the
Yiddish electronic world.  If anyone wants to reach me or Zalemen, my
brother, Chane, my mother or Yosl my father please leave a message and I
will get the messages to them.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Subject: Introduction

My name is Glenn Levine.  I've been a subscriber to Mendele for a few
months now, but have been hesitant about introducing myself because I
wasn't quite sure if I was going to remain a subscriber.  You see, as a
devoted Yiddishist and a serious linguist, I am disconcerted and even
saddened by the pointless, and I'm afraid to say, petty debate going on
in Mendele over "romanization" etc.  I really don't believe it matters
how you transcribe Yiddish, as long as the message comes across.  The
important thing is that we DO Yiddish, that we don't give it up.

I hope I haven't offended those involved in the ongoing debate over
transcription: it's just that I feel there are so many substantive issues
of Yiddish literature, culture and linguistics that are more worthwhile,
and in the long run, more fruitful.

I am a graduate student in the Department of Germanic Languages in
Austin, Texas.  I am currently working on dissertation research with Dr.
Robert King and Dr. Itzik Gottesman.  I'm investigating the Yiddish
spoken by the first generation US-born children of Yiddish-speaking
immigrants.  Anyone who knows Yiddish speakers in the central Texas area,
whether American-born or not, should please let me know, as I am always
on the lookout for new people I can interview for my study!

I suppose by the presence of my introduction here you can see that I've
decided not to quit Mendele, though I'm sure the discussion of
transcription will drag on.  I find Mendele a valuable source of
information; being in a place like Texas it's nice to know one isn't
alone.

In closing I will throw out a question that has been occupying my mind
for some time:

What is the nature of the knowledge of Yiddish of a person who learned it
from her or his parents as a child, but then ceased using it at about
school age.  60 or 70 years have now gone by, little thought has even
been given to Yiddish over the years, yet when asked to produce sentences
in Yiddish, most can do it relatively easily.  What is the nature of this
knowledge, and to what extent can this person be said to 'know' Yiddish.

Subject: "Simkhes toyre" Song

For Andrew Cassel:

I'm not sure whether the actual "Simkhes toyre" song you mention is
published anywhere (this sounds like a job for "the Bobs" - Freedman
and/or Rothstein), but for an interesting variant, check out "Adir
Eloiheinu" in Chaim Kotylansky's "Folks-gezangen" (YKUF, Los Angeles,
1944), an excellent small collection of East European Jewish songs,
including quite a few of Hasidic provenance (likely the case with the one
you mention as well).

Interestingly, the song is actually associated with the holiday of Shvues
rather than Simkhes Toyre, since Shvues also commemorates the giving of
the Ten Commandments at Mt Sinai and is sometimes known as "Simkhes toyre
habo" (actually ' habo'o ' in loshn keydesh, for the mefunokim among us).

Cantor Sam Weiss of Baltimore recently pointed out to me that these
"Adir.... , Borukh.... Godoyl..." songs associated with Shvues are  - as
may be obvious to many - derived from (or at least follow the same
formula as) the Peysakh song "Adir hu," found in the Haggadah.

As for the genre of the song,  it's what is known in the (Jewish)
ethnomusicology biz as a "para-liturgical song," i.e. a song that has a
religious theme but is not part of the actual liturgy.  Such songs are
most frequently heard outside the context of synagogal worship, e.g. the
zmires for the Shabes table at home or for shaleshudes, or the (by no
means always wordless) nigunim sung at a Rebe's tish or other Hasidic
gathering.  Much of the Hasidic repertoire is thus considered para-
liturgical.

Hope this sheds at least some light,

Michael Alpert

Subject: Things are moving along at YIVO

I thought this might be a good juncture to update you all regarding
YIVO's move.  By and large, things are going smoothly, and I now see the
light at the end of the tunnel.  Still, it will be early- mid-November
before we can set up shop and open to the public. Because much of our
collections will be in storage (albeit on shelves, in a building not too
far from the interim office), there will be some restrictions on access.
For example, if an item is available in microform the original will not
be paged.  There will be limits to the number of other items that will be
paged, in cases when they are housed in storage (this holds true for the
entire periodicals collection and for a couple of special collections).
Interlibrary loans will be restricted to microforms and photocopies.
These are the sort of housekeeping issues that we'll be dealing with for
the next couple of years, until we move again.

It now looks quite probable that YIVO will be joined at 15 West 16th
Street by the American Jewish Historical Society, the Leo Baeck
Institute, and the Yeshiva University Museum.  The synergy could be quite
exciting.  Regarding the YIVO/LBI alliance, I hope that it will result in
a combination of Germanic efficiency and Eastern European neshome,
rather than the other way around.  (That is "off-the-record.")

The things we're finding in crevices and nooks!  Last week, in a locked
closet that hadn't been opened in years I found a parchment scroll
containing a story by Joseph Opatoshu, "Der mishpet," in megillah-style
calligraphy, with modernistic illustrations by V. Vayntroyb.  I was
familiar with the published version of that story -- including the
Vayntroyb illustrations -- but to come across the original was quite an
experience.  My long-time co-worker Dina Abramowicz remembered the
scroll, though she hadn't laid eyes on it in decades, and told me that it
belonged (logically enough) to YIVO's Opatoshu Collection, donated after
the author's death. My counterpart in the YIVO Archives, Marek Web, then
immediately claimed the scroll on the grounds that being an original
artwork it belonged in his department (the Archives include all
manuscripts and artworks), and not mine.  It was painful, but I parted
with it only a few days after having rediscovered it.
