Subject: Introduction

I am a first-year grad. student in the Curriculum of Comparative
Literature at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The main
language that I work in is German, so an interest in all things Yiddish
may seem appropriate.  I also work in French and American Lit.

I suppose that working in German lit., especially that of the early 20th
century, has made me wonder about Yiddish; I hope that my lack of
knowledge and desire to learn from this group will be welcomed by its
members.  I hope to find new opportunities through your group.

I only heard a Leo Fuld recording once, and I had the impression that the
inconsistencies in his dialect were caused by the fact that he took the
pronunciation of the songs from different recordings and subsequently
changed it. The accent, however, struck me as being pure Rotterdam. This
is most obvious in the pronunciation of the _r_, but it is also clear in
the quality of the vowels. The devoicing of final vowels (e.g., "vayp")
of course fits into the pattern.

Subject: Bargoens

Here is a small list of Dutch words of Yiddish/Hebrew origin, compiled
from personal recollection, with the assistance of a Dutch-English
dictionary.  I think all would be considered colloquialisms.

Perhaps others more expert in this field, such as Marion Aptroot, could
add to (or correct) this list, or provide some standard references.

[Pronunciation:  Dutch 'j'  = Eng. 'y'.
                   "   'g'  = Yid. 'kh'
                   "   'sj' = Eng. 'sh'
                   "   'oe' = Eng. 'oo' ]

    bajes (= jail) < Heb. word for house
    gein (= fun) < Heb. word for grace
    lef  (= courage, nerve) < Heb. word for heart
    mazzel (= luck)
    mesjogge (= crazy)
    smeris (= cop) < Heb. 'shmerus': watch, guard
    smoesje (= made-up story, fib) < Du. dimin. of 'shmues'
    tof (= fine [fellow]) < Heb. word for good
    Mokum (= Amsterdam)  < Heb. word for place
    Medina (= the rest of the Netherlands) < Heb. word for state or
        province [The idea here, presumably, is that Amsterdam is the
        place to be, and everywhere else is, well, the provinces.]

I have heard that the Dutch drinking formula 'Daar ga je' (= 'there you
go') came about as an imitation of 'lekhaim'.

Two notes:

(1) This vocabulary is supposed to have come into Dutch via a thieves'
cant, known as 'bargoens'.  This origin is obvious at least in the cases
of 'bajes' and 'smeris'. Whether it applies to all the words above, I
don't know.

(2) There has been some discussion on Mendele recently about the high
proportion of loshn-koydesh (as compared to Germanic) Yiddish words in
such vocabularies (100% in the above list). One explanation advanced
concerns the importance of cryptic language for a criminal underground. I
would like to suggest (tentatively) another possible explanation, at
least in the case of Dutch:  Yiddish words of Germanic origin would
generally have to compete for acceptance (so to speak) with
similar-sounding Dutch cognates, whereas words of Heb./Aram. origin would
have no such competition, and might be more readily felt to fill a need.
For example, 'mazl/mazzel' won out against 'glik' because (according to
this theory) the latter had to compete against the Dutch 'geluk'.
(Another explanation, in this case, could be the absence of a hard [g] in
Dutch.)

Subject: Daytshmerish

Could somebody please give me some information about the term
"daytshmerish"? I always hesitate when I pronounce it, probably because I
don't know the etymology.  The problem is the middle syllable.  Is the
"mer" completely unstressed, like the third syllable, and therefore
pronounced with a schwa?  Or does it have its own "secondary" stress, so
that it sounds more like German "mehr"?  I suppose if I knew where the
"mer" came from, I'd be able to guess.  Unfortunately, however, I don't
know of any other Yiddish words that have it.  Are there any?

Zellig Bach from whom we have all learned so much now informs us:

Nu, that explains it!
