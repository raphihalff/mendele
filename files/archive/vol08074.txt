Subject: Yiddish on Israeli television

This week has been dedicated to Yiddish on Israeli television channel 8
(Educational channel). Saturday night it screened Grine Felder. I ran for
Eric Goldman's book, Visions Images and Dreams, and got all the details. It
was fun to see Hershl Bernardi as the young boy, Avrum Yankev. I wish I knew
where in New Jersey it was filmed. My husband, who was born in Hungary and
lived there in a small town until the age of 6, said that the houses looked
like the peasant houses he remembered. 

Sunday night we saw an adult Hershl Bernardi in The Golden Age of Second
Avenue (from the early seventies?). He showed a bit of Yankel der Shmid, in
which he plays the young Yankel. That was the first movie I ever saw, at the
Capitol Theater on Saratoga and Pacific in Brownsville, and I still remember
Moyshe Oysher striking the iron on the anvil. The people who did the Hebrew
translation named him Moyshe Oyshel. The same people Video Spot mangled a
name last night, in Yiddish Blues, about Yiddish in Paris. There is a scene
in a library where a man asks for a book by Sholem Asch and it is translated
as Sholem Aleichem! Tonight channel 8 is featuring Yiddish folksingers and
the last klezmer in Poland. I won't be home so I shall miss this.

Subject: early-bird, etc.

Re Pessel Semmel-Stern's request for a translation of "early-bird," I offer: 
Frierdikn foygl. 

For Craig Abernathy's collection of Yiddish poetry in America, I hope he
does not forget my translation of I. J. Schwartz's KENTUCKY. 

Thank you for all the wonderful postings.

Subject: Seeking a Kreplach song!!

40 years ago, as a child , my father had a Yiddish comic record (actually,
Yiddish and English)  entitled "Kreplach". I have no idea who sang it (it
was a male) but lines from it stick in my memory and I would love to track
it down --"Kreplach, Oh I I love Kreplach, I like 'em hot I like 'em cold I
like 'em new I like 'em old---- those kreplach they are driving me
i-n-n-n-n-sane " ---
                        
Can anyone help me???

Many thanks,
Rodney Falk

Subject: What does "kasa" mean?

I found the term "kasa"  used in the following way:

"When I was a boy [in Karpata-Rus] we used to arrange for ourselves a "kasa"
for Shabbat. We kids used to "steal" fresh apples and other fruits specially
for the Shabbat "kasa". (From an article which appeared in 1939).

What does "kasa" mean? Sometimes it appeared in plural form in Hebrew "kasot".
This word is not a Hebrew word, and I could not find it in my Yiddish
dictionaries either.  The big city near where that story took place was Khust.

Subject: Ikh Zing

One place the Yiddish lyrics (along with the sheet music) can be found is the
New York Times "Great Songs of the Yiddish Theater" (1975).  Lyrics by Molly
Picon, Music by Abraham Ellstein, from the film "Mamele."  The version with
which I am familiar is on "Jan Peerce on 2nd Avenue."

Subject: Ikh zing

Re: Allan Blair's request on Mendele 08.073 (8),
Here are the lyrics for "Ikh Zing,"  by Molly Picon, from the film MAMELE.
The music to this song is by Abraham Ellstein:

        Shloyme hamelekh hot tsu zayn Shulamis
        Gezingen a libes shir,
        Un punkt vi Shloyme dan, gelibte mayne,
        Breng ikh mayn lid tsu dir.
        Ikh zing far dir mayn shir hashirim
        Mit libe ikh batsir im,
        Far dir nor neshome mayn.
        Ikh zing far dir mayne khaloymes.
        Mayn libe vi a troym iz
        Fun dir nor nekhome mayn.
        Ven ikh gey oys fun benken nokh dir, gelibte mayn.
        Un ven ikh halt in eyn denken
        Az du vest nokh amol mayne zayn.
        Ikh zing fun hartsn mayne lider,
        Mayn shir hashirim vider,
        Gelibte,  far dir ikh zing.

Subject: Yiddish poetry in America

With regard to the Yiddish poetry in America-page mentioned on Mendele, it
may interest Mendelyaner to know that since l970 my husband Yosl/Joseph
Mlotek and I have been editing two pages in the Yiddish Forverts, devoted to
Yiddish poetry and song - they first appeared weekly, then bi-weekly in the
column Perl fun der yidisher poezye This column formed the basis for four
anthologies, Mir trogn a gezang, Perl fun yidishn lid, Songs of Generations/
Lider fun dor tsu dor, and in Yiddish - Perl fun der yidisher poezye.  We
have written about Avrom/Abraham Reisen many times.  I prepared a
bibliography of Reisen's poems that were set to music in Zalmen
Zylbercweig's Teater leksikon, vol. 6.  In the "Perl" we sometimes comment
on poems and songs that appear on Mendele. I also respond to queries about
Yiddish music and songs in my capacity as Music Archivist of YIVO...  That
is regrettably why I lack the time to reply directly on Mendele.  But We
invite Mendelyaner to join us at the other venues..  A groysn dank
Mendele-fraynd far di interesante briv, un ayere shayles un tshuves.
