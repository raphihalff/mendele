Subject: Introduction

I am a new member.  I have written books on American Jewish History
(popularization) and scholarly books on the Puritan and Indians and also on
Abraham Lincoln.  In addition, my studies have been published in the
Publications of the American Jewish Historical Society and the Journal  of
the Illinois State Historical Society.  I have been a news reporter,  UN
correspondent and foreign correspondent, spent more than twenty years  in
public relations for national Zionist and Yiddish organizatoons and
subsequently have been in New York State and federal government.  I assume
this would indicate that I am somewhat over twenty-one.

I am a native of Montreal, raised in a Yiddishist famimly.  My father,
Chaim, was an actor who appeared with J.P. Adler, Maurice Schwartz and
the Hollanders/  He played in the Dybbuk with Menashe Skulnik when
Skulnik played dramatic roles.  My Great Uncle was I.J. Segal.  So much
by way of introducing myself.

Why am I writing.  At present I am in the midst of writing my  memoirs--my
life in Montreal growing up Jewish and my experiences in the  Unityed
States.  I am anxious to get as much information as possible  about my
father's shtetl:  SHAROVKA in the Ukraine.  While there are a  few facts
about Sharovka on the internet, they do not contain the  information I
hope--with your help--to secure. My father used to tell me about Sharovka
from time to time but my  interest then was not what it is today.  And, of
course my parents are  gone and so are other members of their and my own
generation.  I am  interested in descriptive matter on the houses Jews
lived in, and what  it was like to be a Jew in that shtetl.  The period
I'm talkling about  is from 1898 (when my father was born) to 1913 when he
and his father  came to Montreal.

Any information that Mendele members may have and wish to share will be
greatly appreciated.

A sheynem dank.

prezhenitse is the word used by Sholem Aleikhem in one of his stories. My
family said 'yayshnitse'.

Subject: Re: prezhinitse

My father used to use the word in the sense of mish-mash or many things
thrown together as in an omelet with many ingredients: "Oy, iz dos geven a
prezhinitse".

Subject: Re: Words of Fire

I for one believe that Yiddish and East European Yiddish culture will
survive in some form or another. But I do take exception to those who
believe the hasidim will be the conveyors of the Yiddish language. Yes
they do speak Yiddish as their daily lingua franca but have you walked
around  Wlliamsburg, Crown Heights or Boro Park, Brooklyn recently and
listened  carefully? The Yiddish many (if not most of those under 50) speak
is mixed  with many Yinglinsh-isms. Their daily vocabulary is very limited.
(Just as the Yiddish spoken in Antwerp and in Bnai Brak is mixed  with
French and Hebrew)  Of course I realize much of their daily  lives are
involved with religion and not a wide variety of secular subjects  so the
Yiddish spoken has no need for most of the words in Weinrich's  dictionary.
Basically procreation comes down to the heart of the matter I think  these
days. Secular and non-secular Jews do not have large familes the  Khasidim
do. Thankfully they will preserve some kind of spoken Yiddish, but one  my
bobe from Stolin, Belarus would have had a difficult time in understanding.

Subject: Re: kuni-leml

You will find a kuna, a pillory, a lockable iron collar on a chain,
cemented into a niche in the outside wall of the synagogue in Przysucha
(Yiddish: Pshiskhah) in southern Poland to this day.

Subject: Re: kuni-leml

In Vol 14.038 Hershl Hartman raised the question: "what is the
meaning/derivation of `kuni' in the term for innocent fool/dope/dupe,
kuni-leml, as found in the 1928 edition of Harkavy"

The word is found in the supplement of the second edition of the
Yiddish-English- Hebrew dictionary. On page 576 the dictionary gives
kuni-leml: dunce, fool. The word kune is found in the same dictionary in
the main body on p. 452: kune: pillory, prison. (info. Received from Mr.
Hartman).

Harkavy's Engl. - Yid. / Yid. Engl. Dictionary, 22nd edition of 1953, does
not give kuni-leml, but on p. 302 it gives kune (f.) (pl. es): pillory,
halson (halson obviously a misprint for prison). In Vol. 14.045 I quoted
Niborsky's dictionary (info. Received from Mr. Jan Jonk). This dictionary
informs us that kuni = kune and gives a clear definition of the word. In
vol. 14.047 I added the definition for `kune' found in Bernstein. It gives
us similar information as Niborski, but also the additional information
that in Bernstein's days (his book was published in 1908), the kune was an
institution of the past. It also explains that it is a Polish word and
gives the expression `postawic w kunie'.

In Stutchkoff's `oytser' kune-leml is found under 340 narishkeyt, p. 305,
amidst a huge collection of other assorted naronim. Under 604 bashtrafung
we find: shteln (tsubindn) tsum shandklots (tsum shondshlup, tsum
shondstoyp); shteln in kune (in vinkel). Under 470 frayheytbagrentsung we
find kune as one of the many words for prison.

The question not answered yet is how the lamb got to the kune. Must have
been a foolish lamb, and, as Mr. Hartman's original question suggests,
probably an innocent lamb as well.

The Dutch translation of `potawic w kunie' is: `aan de kaak stellen. The
`kaak' (pillory) was abolished as a form of punishment in the Netherlands
in 1854, but the expression survives with the meaning: to expose
something/someone in public (i.e. to write about a scandal in the papers).
The `kuni-leml' probably went through a similar development: the meaning of
kune is forgotten, but it survives in the expression.
