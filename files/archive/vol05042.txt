Subject: Teaching children to read Yiddish via the Hebrew alphabet

Morrie Feller inquires about this tactic. I experienced it as a 10 year
old in the Bronx 57 years ago. Our teacher at Kheder was a young woman
who quite on her own decided to include Yiddish in the curriculum. She
explained clearly about how Yiddish treated vowels and taught us to write
as well. Alas, I still read only very haltingly, but that's my fault not
hers.

Subject:Teaching Yiddish to Hebrew Literate Children

Last year I guest taught for one day at Hillel Day School of Metropolitan
Detroit (a conservative Hebrew Day School in which Yiddish is not
taught). I was a guest of the 5th grade, of the 3rd grade and of the 5th
grade. In each class I did an introduction about Yiddish language...what
it is and from where it comes, etc.  I then made some connections for the
kids using words they know in Hebrew that exist in Yiddish....Later I
passed out a chart of the Yiddish alphabet with equivalent sounds from
Hebrew, totally bypassing English transliteration.  Next, using a couple
of simple songs that are full of loshn koydesh words (ie., "az der rebi
zingt) and English cognates, we read through the songs and learned to
sing them.  I was excited by the possibilities I saw at the school. Too
bad that I could only have a day, with no real possibilities for an
ongoing program....I think it's a terrific idea though.  I once pitched
the idea of offering Yiddish as an elective class at such a
school...money was the inevitable problem....
