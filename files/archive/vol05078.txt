Subject: Korn's _A nay kleyd_

The poem Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan is looking for is _A nay kleyd_, by
Rokhl Korn.  It is included by Ruth Whitman, together with her
translation, in her excellent _An anthology of modern Yiddish poetry_,
New York:  October House, 1966.

A nay kleyd

Ikh hob zikh ongetun haynt,
tsum ershtn mol
nokh zibn lange yor
a nay kleyd.

Nor s'iz tsu kurts far mayn troyer
un tsu eng far mayn layd,
un s'iz a yeder vays-glezerner knop,
vi a trer,
vos flist fun di faldn arop
farshteynert un shver.

Subject: Feldsher

I know that the term "feldsher" describes a person who had some medical
duties but I would like to know exactly what it was a person with such a
descriptive name was trained to do.  I have several family members who
are identified only as "Ephraim der feldsher" and I am attempting to
understand what it was that they did both in training and in practice to
earn this title.  Was it professional or casual?

One final item regarding this name: I have never heard the term used as
describing anyone not from Lithuania.  That is, my Polish ancestors not
only never described someone this way, they looked at me strangely when I
asked, almost as if the term were foreign to them.  Was this a
geographically distinctive name?

Subject: Yiddish in translation

In regard to Morrie Feller's request (Vol 5.077) for evidence that access
to the riches of Yiddish culture stimulates interest in the language, I'd
suggest that many of the participants in Mendele who have a limited
language knowledge  were originally attracted by one or another aspect of
Yiddish culture.

It would be interesting to have a (decidedly unscientific) survey on the
question among Mendelyaner whose Yiddish knowledge stems largely from
courses or self-study. What first attracted them to Yiddish?

My own personal experience as a secular Jewish educator for over three
decades led to my assertion. Countless adults with whom I've worked have
been delighted with/inspired by a translated Yiddish poem, a Yiddish song
or story and have (a) bemoaned the fact that so little of our culture was
available to them as they grew up and (b) taken steps to learn
Yiddish--or, at least, more than they knew to begin with.

A single example: the Sholem Community Organization in Los Angeles
established a Yiddish Chorus some years ago because the Yiddish songs in
translation sung as part of our holiday observances attracted some
community members. Only two of the chorus members knew any Yiddish. Its
performances are a model of clear, accurate Yiddish diction that has
delighted audiences, including those of its debut on local public
television. (Their singing, itself, is tam ganeydn--nor nit dos bin ikh
oysn.)

As the folk wisdom puts it: a bisl un a bisl makht a fule shisl. (A
tittle and a jot fills up the pot.)

Subject: Yiddish tapes and in translation

Regarding Morrie Feller's question about the relationship between
accessibility to oral/aural literature - on tape- as a possible inhibitor
to learning to read a language,  research in second language acquisition
really does substantiate that developing a love for oral language will
increase the likelihood of acquiring literacy in a language. It will not
be a guarantee of reading, but preventing the taped literature out is
negative and there are enough barriers, practical and social weighing
against Yiddish. The hard line will only create another barrier.  There
are so many reasons for people not to learn to read Yiddish that unless
there are strong motivating factors like appreciation, love, curiosity,
they will not make the effort. So I, myself, am eager to hear these tapes
and use them for teaching oral comprehension. Yiddish has been known to
be a spoken language as well and Sholem Aleichem's tales are told as if
they were to be spoken anyhow.

Subject: _The Messiah Text_

I am looking for _The Messiah Text_ by Raphael Patai. I have no further
info on the publisher or date. During the summer Yiddish course at
Columbia/YIVO where I was a student, we read the first act of Peretz' "Di
Goldene Kayt". I found my lack of information on folklore and references
to the Messiah frustrating. Dr Avrom Novershtern suggested this book as a
source of information. I am having difficulty locating a copy. I would
greatly appreciate any advice.

Thanks in advance

Subject: Isaac Bashevis Singer

I address the following question out of ignorance of the positive rather
than intelligence of the negative.

Why is it that I get the impression that Issac Bashevis Singer is not as
revered among yidishisten as he is in the wider world? As I mentioned in
my opening I have heard nothing disparaging or adverse about him or his
writing to confirm my suspicions. However, I nevertheless get a feeling
that apart from him not being considered as one of the Greats he is not
even awarded his due place as a leading contemporary yidishist.

Is it perhaps that he is considered tzu a groyse apikoyres even for those
brought up on Peretz and the like (nisht mistaber!) or is there a
different reason behind it. Or maybe I have simply got it wrong!

Subject: Makh a fayg - repeat

I'm trying to find the source and story about a little child who is
advised by a parent to "makh a fayg" whenever he is frightened by a bad
person or circumstance.

A dank aykh ale.
