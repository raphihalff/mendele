Yowkh in my family, from Bessarabia, was congealed or
jellied soup, such as the jelly of gefilte fish, or even
cold chicken soup if jellied, or consomme. fis hyukh, then.

Subject: hayratn

For the sake of sholem bayis, let me add to the matter of
the word for 'marry.' The Yiddish word and its cognates in
modern Germanic languages, e.g., die Heirat 'marriage' in
Standard German, are reconstructed as coming from two
proto-Germanic roots: hiw (the i is long) 'household' and
rad (long a) 'rule, advise.' These roots in turn come from
proto-Indo-European. This would seem to rule out a Semitic
origin. If I may say so, Mikhl Herzog's cautionary
statement about hypotheses of genetic relations between
languages is well taken. Folk etymologies can be fun, but
they commonly rest on no supporting data. Aren

Subject: leaves turning?

We were out for a drive in southern Ontario yesterday, and
wanted to point out the leaves turning (changing colour) to
the kids.  What's the right verb?  Somehow "dreyen zikh"
and "endern zikh" don't seem right, though Simone likes
"endern zikh". I came up with "bafarbn zikh", which Simone
doesn't like. "Vern royt un gel"?

Help! (before they all fall off and it doesn't matter:-)

Regarding "nunt"-------

        My Byelorussian Bubbe (who called petsha "petshA"
by the way) used to make what sounds like a version of nunt
that she called "ingberlakh" because while the nuts were in
the boiling honey-molasses mixture, copious quantities of
ginger were added to the honey.  After cooling the
ingberlakh were pressed into flattened sheets, perhaps 1/4
inch thick and cut into rectangles.  Ooh...do I miss those
ingerlakh!

        By the way, with Rosh HaShanah just having come and
gone, the varieties of Teyglakh experience may still be on
our minds--ingberlakh naturally bring teyglakh to mind.  My
wife and I differ on our teyglakh preferences.... she
favors large single teyglakh with dried fruit hidden
inside, the whole mess in a soup of honey.  I favor smaller
teyglakh that are pressed together with nuts and coconut
into a mass that can be picked up and consumed without
permanently gluing one's beard together.

        And finally, what about exploring the many
varieties of holiday challot?  The same Byelorussian
grandmother would prepare a kitke with praying hands to eat
before the fast, a kitke with a bird's head for tthe break
fast and a challah shaped like a ladder for the break fast
on some occasions.  The bird was to fly our prayers to
heaven and the ladder for the angels to ascend (again with
our prayers).  I'd be interested in hearing the types of
challot that were found in other areas of Europe.

        This whole discussion makes me hungry--it's off to
the kitchen for me.....
