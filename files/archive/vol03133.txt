Subject: _ufruf_

   My original question was, why did Orthodox Jews take up "uf". I
   cannot think of another instance of wide-spread Orthodox usage of a
   NE Yiddish form.

(1) what do you mean by "Orthodox Jews".  Is this supposed to be a
group that does not include Litvaks?  Vos heyst?!

(2) Oyf is not originally Yiddish.  It was a hack by language
planners to have one spelling for both the preposition [AF] with the
adverbial [UF]/[ARUF].  It's caused no end of confusion, in my
opinion.

(3) However, well-meaning native Yiddish speakers and teachers of
Yiddish have cultivated the use of the "proper" [OYF] for so long,
that it actually has become an authentic Yiddish form.

[Well, that ought to inspire at least a bit of dialog....]

In reply to Ellen Prince's query:

666 = Tav-Resh-Samekh-Vav, or TaRS"U.
Tav=400; Resh=200; Samekh=60, Vav=6

Nisht tzu bedanken.

Subject: Jewish Years and Dovid Katz

Ellen's question reminds me of a problem I had when I read Katz's
Grammar. In order to illustrate the principle of forming the Jewish
years and vocalizing them, he chose the example of 5748, or 1987/8.
However, whereas most Jews pronounced that year "tismakh," Katz had
it "tashmakh." It is common to deviate from the standard
vocalization, especially to avoid a ominous word or to change to a
hopeful one.  In a similar vein, the year 5744 was changed to
"tisdam" to avoid tashmad."  Does anyone remember if Israeli papers
followed the changed form, because I know that the Orthodox world
did so?

Subject:  Route 666

"How would 666 be represented in Hebrew alphabetic numerals?" --
asks Ellen Prince (MENDELE 3.132).  I'm sure there will be a flood
of responses, so let me weigh in with the answer and a
bibliographical observation.

666:  Tav - resh - samekh - vov.
      400 + 200  +   60   +  6   = 666

Alef > yod = 1 > 10;
Kaf > tsade = 20 > 90;
Resh > tav = 100 > 400.

Hebrew dates make copious use of alphabetic numerals.  The present
year, 5754, would properly be represented by the following letters:
He' (+apostrophe) - tav - shin - nun - dalet.

  5,000           + 400 +  300 +  50 +  4    = 5,754

Usually, however, the "5,000" designator (he' + apostrophe) is
omitted, and the date is written, e.g.:

Tav - shin - nun - dalet  l[i]f[rat]"k[atan] ("according to the
abbreviated way of writing the date").

Scholars and bibliographers use sleight of hand to figure out the
civil equivalent of an abbreviated Hebrew date, which I will now
reveal (at pain of kheyrem):  Add 1,240 to the abbreviated date, and
you get the equivalent C.E. year, e.g.:  754 + 1,240 = 1,994. But
it's only 1993, you say?  Remember that Rosh Hashanah comes in
September or thereabouts, so the first few months of 5754 actually
fall in the year 1993, but most of the current Hebrew year will
indeed occur in 1994.

If 666 were an abbreviated Hebrew date, its equivalent civil year
would be 1905/06.  The Library of Congress, in its wisdom, no longer
uses Hebrew letters to represent Hebrew dates; instead, it
"translates" them into Arabic numerals and then provides a civil
year equivalent (if none is supplied in the work being described).
One encounters absurdities such as the following, on a Library of
Congress cataloging record:  Warsaw : B. Shimin, 666 [1905 or 1906].
