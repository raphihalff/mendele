Subject: A poem by Yaakev Glashteyn

When I first joined Mendele about 734 years ago, I posted a poem about my
number 1, favorite, absolute special composer, "Mozart." Indeed that is
the title of a  poem  by  Yaakev Glashteyn.  Since that time, there have
been so many new joiners to Mendele (with so many of these expressing
interests in music) that I am going to post it again, if I can get it
through the shames.

I don't know much about Glatshteyn except for the fact that his is the
only Yiddish poetry I know about Mozart and that, furthermore, he wrote
many such poems about what appears to have been his favorite musical
topic, too.  The English translation of this poem is by Richard Fein of
the State University of NY at New Paltz.  The spelling and choice of
Yiddish words in transliteration are mine.   When this poem was reprinted
about 15 years ago in an English language journal that dealt with Jewish
topics world-wide, there were criticisms offered that the text was
anti-Christian.  I never felt that but perhaps my affection for the topic
blinded me to a broader perspective.

===================================================
MOZART: YAAKEV GLATSHTEYN
0
Es hot zich mir gecholomot:
goyim hoben Mozarten gekreitzikt
und ihm begroben in an aizel-keber.
Nur yidn hobon ihm gemacht far Gotes mentsch
un zain gedechenish gebenscht.

[I had this dream:
Gentiles had crucified Mozart
and buried him in a potter's field.
Jews alone revered him as a holy man
and blessed his memory.]

Sein apostol bin ich iber der velt gelofen
un fakert yeder ainem vos k'hav getrofen.
Umentum voz k'hav gechapt a krist,
chob ich ihm geschmat oif a Mozarist.

[I was his apostle.  I ran through the world
converting everyone I met.
Whenever I caught a Christian
I turned him into a Mozartian.]

Vi vunderlech iz fun gettlechen mentsch
zein musikalischer testament,
vi durchgenogelt mit gezang
zainen zaine lichtigeh hent.
In zein grester noit,
hoben beim gekreitziten zinger
gelacht ale finger.
In zain veinendiksten troier,
hot er noch mehr vi zich alein
lieb gehat dem schaines oier.

[How marevellous the musical testament
of a God-filled man,
how nail-pierced with song
are his glowing hands.
In his bitterest need
laughter lit up the fingers
of the crucified singer.
In his most painful weeping
he loved, more than himself,
the ear of his neighbor.]

Vi orem und vi karg,
antkegen Motzartem farblaib,
iz di droshe oifen barg.

[How poor and how meager,
compared with what Mozart left us,
is the Sermon on the Mount.]


Can some kind soul enlighten me on who Yaakev Glatshteyn was?

Subject: The Yiddish of Hasidim

For the benefit of those who do not have access to the Sunday New York
Times I am providing below an excerpt from an article which appears in
today's Sunday New York Times, Page 15 of the City Section, dated January
15th 1995. It is headed _A World of Yiddish, Lost_ and is subtitled with
the rhyme /Williamsburg Today Echoes Eras Past, but the Difference is
Vast/. The article seems rather provocative to me, implying strongly that
the Hasidim have little use for the Yiddish language other than to
protect their young from the temptations of the modern world. They
totally ignore the secular aspects of the language, according to the
article.

Is this really the case? Are there any Hasidim on the Mendele list who
feel they could contest the thrust of the article?  Here is his
concluding paragraph:

        There are Hasidic textbooks for the classroom, story books for
        children, religious newspapers -- all of them in Yiddish. The
        language lives on in the community, which is vast. But the
        Yiddish world that I loved, that was aboil with artistic and
        social ferment, that world is truly gone. And I, for one, feel
        the poorer because of it.

The New York Times adds that Isidore Hailblum is a novelist whose books
have been translated into six languages, but not Yiddish.

Subject: The Yiddish of Hasidim

The version of the Sunday NY Times sold in New York City itself contains
a section called _the city_. Today (1/15) there is in that section a
piece entitled "A World of Yiddish Lost" by Isidore Haiblum. It is
nostalgic about the author's Brooklyn childhood immersion in Yiddish
langauage and culture and regrets that the remaining Yiddish speakers are
the Chasidm (Khasidm ? - the Times spells it "Hasidm") who reject the
secular side of Yiddish culture. "It is as if the Amish were the sole
surviving English speakers."

I'd send a Xerox copy to any who email me their address (at least if
there aren't too many :-) ).

Subject: Umbeshrign

Jack Feldman:

Modern German "unbeschrieen" may fill the bill.  It can be translated as
"not to shout about it" and is used much like knocking on wood.

Subject: Bashrigen/bashrien

Jack Feldman has asked about a Yiddish word that he, or someone else,
recalls as _umbeshrigen_. The meaning suggested by him reminded me of a
word, _umbashrien_, often uttered by my late mother long years ago when
saying something good about someone.

I failed to find the word  in either Weinreich or Harkavy, but I did find
it in Vol. 2 of the _Groyser Verterbukh fun der Yidisher Shprakh_ (New
York, 1966). It has an entry for _umbashrigen_, which tells you to see
_umbashrien_, although examples are given under each of them. The second
has the definition: "Vos me zol dem (der) keyn eyn-hore nit geben." That
is, you say this to avert casting the evil eye upon the one that you are
praising.

Under the first entry we find this example: "Zi iz umbashrigen sheyn, un
hot groysn kheyn..." (from a 1798 book by Arn Wolfszon). Apparently, this
expression, in one form or the other, is interchangeable    with _keyn
e(y)n hore_ 'no evil eye.' Weinreich gives two past participles for the
verb _shrayen_ 'to shout': geshrigen, geshrien. This must be the
grammatical underpinning of the alternate forms of our expression.

Also _umbashriyen_ and _umbarufn_ all mean more or less the same
as _keyn ayn(e) hOre_/_kinihOre_, etc.

Subject: Lamed-vovnik

Diane Robson has asked about the "lamed-vovniks," a topic from Jewish
folklore. The Yiddish expression is from the names of the sequence of
Hebrew letters, /lamed vav/, which stands for the numeral 36.The
following is quoted from Unterman, A. (1991). _Dictionary of Jewish lore
and legend_. London and New York: Thames and Hudson.  See pp. 116-117.

    There is a belief in Jewish folklore that in each generation there
    are thirty- six hidden righteous men (see tzaddik) on whose meritsd
    the world depends. This belief is based on a Talmudic statement that
    there are not less than thirty-six righteous people who stand in the
    presence of the shekhina every day. One of these humble and unnoticed
    lamed-vovniks is destined to be the Messiah, if the generation is
    worthy. They wander in exile with their felow Jews, working as
    artisans, and only assert themselves when there is danger to the
    community. After they have acted to save the Jews from danger, they
    revert back to their anonymity. They are forbidden to reveal
    themselves to others, for if they did so, they would die.  [There is
    more in the entry.]

Subject: Mefunak

Berel Leiser uses the word _mefunak_, surely the Hebrew
_mefnAk_ rather than the Yiddish _mefUnik_.  Does it matter?  Yes,
because the Yiddish word yields a feminine form _mefUnitse_ as if
from a Slavic suffix _-nik_; the Hebrew feminine, on the
contrary, is _mefunEket_.

By the way, Berel, who are the Montrealers you're looking for,
the ones you refer to as "they"?
