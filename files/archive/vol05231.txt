Subject: Gevest

Ellen Prince:

There are Litvaks and there are Litvaks. There were certainly some areas of
Northeastern Yiddish where the only past auxiliary was 'hobn', but it is just
as certain that other areas had both 'hobn' and 'zayn'. What is important for
a theory of the unexpected pluperfect is that the single auxiliary area
borders on the area where the unexpected pluperfect prevails. Unfortunately,
the only decent data on the distribution of the single auxiliary covers only a
limited area, see Herzog's "The Yiddish Language in Northern Poland", maps
4:76 - 4:79.

In his Tora translation, Yehoash uses 'gevest' only as the pluperfect
particle; in fact, his use of it is found only in the section beginning with
Yeshaye and ending with the first book of Tilim. The pluperfect with 'gehat'
is found everywhere, including this section. In all, there are only a couple
dozen instances of the pluperfect.

Subject: Skatine/skotine

Louis Fridhandler:

The Talmudic saying has it that whoever attributes a citation to its author
brings 'geule' into the world. When citing an author, one can bring a little
more 'geule' by saying where. Sholem Aleichem used 'skatine' in at least two
places: the first in 'Motl Peysye dem khazns', p. 23 in my edition -- part 1,
chapter 1, section zayen; the second in 'Funem Yarid', p. 96 in my edition --
chapter 18 'pinele shimeles fort keyn odes'.

Subject: "Tum Balalaika"; Jewish balalaika

Can anyone tell me about the origin of the song "Tum balalaika"?  I'm working
on a book on the balalaika and am looking for Jewish connections.  Does anyone
know if there were Jewish balalaika groups or individual players in the former
Russian Empire?

I am also preparing an article on balalaika in New York City.  There were a
number of Jews who played in Russian balalaika orchestras, but did anyone play
the balalaika or domra (a related Russian instrument) in the Yiddish theater
or in orchestras that catered to predominantly Jewish audiences?

Any information on Jewish connections to the balalaika would be much
appreciated.

Subject: Satmer and St. Mary?

Hasidic sects are often known after the towns where their rebes started to
"reign."  So we have the Bobover khsidim, Gerer, Lubavitsher, Satmer (or
Satmar), Skverer, and so on.

In the Indianapolis, IN, weekly _Nat'l Jewish Post & Opinion_  (Jan. 3, 1996,
p.  10), in the column "Digest of the Yiddish Press" the ludicrous statement
resurfaced that the name of the Satmer khsidim derives from the Rumanian town
St. Mary.

Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter, in response to a question submitted to the _Jewish
Language Review_ (Haifa) wrote:  "It is high time that this myth, concocted by
Rumanianless English-speakers in the United States, be exploded:  Satmer (not
"satmar" as one sometimes sees) is the Yiddish name of Satur Mare, a city in
Rumania whose literal meaning is 'big town.'  It has absolutely nothing  to do
with  St.  Mary"  (J.L.R., Vol. 2, 1982, p. 302, R909/1).

This "digester" (a rabbi) knows little Yiddish, as I indicated in these pp.
some time ago, as when he referred, for example, to "Aleykhem's  House" as if
Aleykhem were Sholem Aleylhem's last name, and constantly keeps referring to
Yiddish by the schizographic name "mame lashon," instead of mame-loshn.

As one who writes a weekly digest of the Yiddish press it would behoove the
rabbi to check some evidently etymological nonsense before "digesting" it,
and, occasionally, consult an expert in Yiddish, in this case indeed Dr.
Schaechter, the famous Yiddish philologist, editor of the YIVO publication
_Yidishe Shprakh_, author of several Yiddish textbooks for students, and
recipient of the Itsik Manger Prize.

Subject: Dona, Dona

On the subject of "Dona, Dona" let's not overlook the wonderful English
translation of the song penned by the New York Yiddish singer Teddi Schwartz.
