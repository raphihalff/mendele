dervaksene, un hobn aza verter frier gehert. Ir hot afile dos

Wonder if this ditty was orginally about the horrible and extremely
antisemitic Tsar Alexander III, and later applied to Nicholas?

Reb Bach dertseylt a mayse fun Maurice Samuelsn:

> "...My Uncle Berl was profoundly shocked by the use [of Yiddish in the
> service of training soldiers].   He was also puzzled:  Where did I get

> Jews had never fought in that language...

Subject: Oyf di Idishe Felder fun Ukraine

A woman recently gave a Yiddish reading group I am in photocopies of a
book which has been in her family's possession for decades.  Entitled,
_Oyf di Idishe Felder fun Uukraine_," it is from a limited, numbered
edition of 50 copies published in Paris by "A. Simon & Cie" in 1926.  The
book has a short text about the salutory effects that moving from stetls
to new collective farms on the steppes had on Ukrainian Jews.  The text
is followed by pages of prints, some of them apparently hand-colored.  Oh
yes, the author's name is I.B. Ribak (he is also apparently responsible
for the art).  This particular  copy of the book is #1 of the edition.

The owner of this book, who does not know Yiddish, is trying to figure
out exactly what it is, how much it is worth, etc.  Our modest reading
group can do a fine job translating the text, but none of us have any
real insight into who Ribak was or what this book is.  Anyone out there
know anything about _Oyf di Idishe Felder_?

Subject: A Sholem-Aleykhem series: One

This should be the first of three posts.  First: an introduction.
Second: a Yiddish article by Sholem-Aleykhem in transcription.  Third: a
translation.

Introduction:

Yiddish literature flowered and won its place against great odds.  The
big picture is generally understood, but the niggling details are not
although they comprised obstacles as difficult.  These posts focus on
aggravations, conflicts, antipathies that afflicted not only
Sholem-Aleykhem but other Yiddish authors at times critical to Yiddish
social and cultural development.

In 1892 (age 33) Sholem-Aleykhem was living in Odessa, still trying to
recover from his 1890 Kiev bankruptcy, still hoping to issue a third
volume of his successful, ground-breaking Yiddish anthologies, Di Yidishe
Folks-Bibliotek (The Jewish People's Library) of 1888 and 1889.  He
scraped enough money together to issue a pamphlet claiming to announce
that third volume: Kol Mevaser tsu der Yidisher Folks-Bibliotek (Voice
Heralding the Jewish People's Library).  Sholem-Aleykhem wrote every bit
of it, partly unsigned, partly over various pseudonyms.  There were ads
in it, too, such as for Equitable Insurance, to help pay for the
pamphlet.

There never was a third volume, but Sholem-Aleykhem took the opportunity
in this 1892 pamphlet to vent anger toward Peretz.  My focus now,
however, is on an item entitled _Nekrolog_ (Obituary).  In it,
Sholem-Aleykhem revealed with bitter humor (gelakht mit yashtsherkes)
debilitating aggravations he had suffered in the past at the hands of the
second publisher of Dos Yidishe Folks-Blat, the paper in which his first
publications appeared over the pseudonym, Sholem-Aleykhem.  By the late
1880s, a new publisher had maneuvered to take the paper over from aging
Alexander Zederbaum who had started it in 1881.  Sholem-Aleykhem does not
name that new publisher, but it was Israel Levy.  As publisher (and de
facto editor) Levy drove contributors to distraction with his eccentric,
autocratic ways.  He would arbitrarily alter contributed items based on
hostility to Yiddish and fatuous notions about the language.  Imagine,
Levy ran a Yiddish paper, but was an enemy of Yiddish (then generally
called Zhargon).  The paper closed in 1891, hence the obituary.  I don't
know whether it was stopped by the tsarist government.  It was probably
bound to be driven into the ground, anyhow, by Levy.  [Yiddish
publication was indeed stopped in Russia for much of the 1890s.]

What resilience, persistence, leadership, vision, etc. possessed by
Sholem-Aleykhem.  Those qualities were as important as his ear for the
music of Yiddish.
