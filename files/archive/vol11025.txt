Subject: kumt tsum tish - Sarah Traister Moskovitz

A new book of Yiddish poems abounding with profound thoughts and
metaphors, lyrical use of language, and translations and transcribings,
all so deeply moving, that I share one with you to sample for your
pleasure.

Sarah's translation:

First Love

My mother went into labor
   in Yiddish.
In Yiddish her prayers,
in Yiddish her screams.
>From her mouth and breast
   Yiddish flowed deep into me.
I was bathed, fed
licked and prettied
   with her warm Yiddish tongue.

My father took me walking
    in Yiddish,
to see the peacocks.
I held on to his Torah pointing finger.
And from the sky
    raisins and almonds fell on me
while I sat on his lap to see
the letters of the golden peacock's rainbow.
We held each letter
in our hands with joy
as if it were a new born little chick.

I envy those
who in their youth had lovers
caressing, teasing, and kissing them
   in Yiddish,
language of first love.

Dear Mendelyaners,
    
Greetings.  I wonder whether any of our learned Mendelyaners can help
me with a couple of my (non-professional) research projects.  I have
two questions.  First, where does a person go -- physically or
"virtually" -- in order to look for rare Jewish books in Yiddish or
Hebrew?  In particular I'm looking for a book called, "Ohel Yitzhak,"
by Moshe Menakhem Walden, published in Piotrkow in 1914.  The title
seems to indicate that the book is written in Hebrew, but I don't know
this for sure.  Nor do I know if it's a strictly religious or a secular
and historical book.  In fact, I saw it cited repeatedly in another
book I was reading, which described the conflict between Hasidim and
"Maskilim" in nineteenth century Poland. These citations (and my
interests as well) have to do in particular with the closely related
Hasidic schools of Kotsk, Ger, and Vurka around the middle of the
century. Any suggestions would be much appreciated.

Secondly, my "Bube" once wrote a short essay for our family in which
she described growing up in the "shtetl" of Ostrolenka, Poland, in the
first years of the twentieth century, the daughter of a "Vurker" Hasid
there.  In particular she said that her mother was a kind of healer
among the poor and religious people in the town, and that she
remembered her mother and even the children sometimes staying up all
night in order to take care of the sick.  My question is, what kinds of
healing might a Hasidic woman in a mid-size "shtetl" in pre-WWI Poland
have practiced?  Is this a subject that has been much studied in the
academic world?  Unfortunately I don't know Russian or Polish, and I'm
guessing there might be books on the subject in those languages, but I
do know Yiddish, Hebrew, and French.  Once again, I would very much
appreciate any suggestions.

Thank you all very much for making your way through this lengthy post.
You can e-mail me directly.  Finally, my apologies for my less than
fluent Yiddish.  Sincerely,

Jon Levitow, 
Los Angeles, CA

Subject: Rokhl Korn

In an anthology of poems I was struck by a marvellous poem: "Keep
hidden from me", written by Rokhl Korn. Now I am trying to get some
more poems form her.. I ordered a volume called Paper Roses and a
volume called Generations.

As I am searching on the web I notice that information about Rokhl
Korns life as well as bibliographical information is very hard to find.

I wonder if you could help me to get some direction in my search. I
cannot read Hebrew; Yiddish is difficult, but I read and speak German
fairly well, so, with some puzzling and much dedication, I should be
able to get some hold of the text. Do you have any information that
could be useful to me? I would be extremely gratefull if you would take
the trouble of answering my question.

Sincerely Yours
