(1)  After Henry Kissinger married his second wife, a
gentile, I remember that she introduced herself as Henry's
"shikseh"  (2) If you read  Shalom Alekhem or even look in
the dictionaries, you will see that a shegets is a boy who
act s   like gentile and not a boy who looks like one.

Subject: shiksas, shaygets and other nice th[D[Dings

My first year in college I bought a tweed jacket and chino
pants. Also, of course, blue button down shirt.  I was then
taller than anyone in my family (5'10"), had blondish hair,
hazel eyes and an athletic build. (Rememberance of things
past) When I came home dressed this way my aunt said I
looked like a shaygets.  I remember being definitely
pleased (I didn't say thank you, as I recall) but the
thought that went through my mind was that now I'd be able
to fulfill the command in one of my uncle's ditties, which
went:  In di Torah shteht geschrieben/ af a shiksa mus min
liegen/yum-ti-di-tum-tum, yum...etc.  So shiksas were
certainly desirable.  Incidentally, Italian boys were never
called shaygets by us. Lokshn, or Tilainisher is what we
called them.  I don't know what Italian girls were called
-- not shiksas (although when I thought of certain of them
several Gottenues would go through my mind).  I also am not
sure whether Germans were called Doytch or whether this was
reserved for German Jews. Same with Poles.  Polakim?
(plural) but did this refer to Polish JEWS or Poles? I
don't find anything pejorative in a LOT of the usage of the
terms, but of course sometimes there is.  There were also
several gentiles identified by my grandparents and parents
as "guhtter goyim," bolibutishi, as opposed to the shkutsim
or chilairlyas or shikerers of which there also many.
Ellen's account squares with my own experience.

Subject: Tsatske/chatchke

Discussing a number of the topics being discussed on
Mendele with friends the other evening a few comments --

Everyone agreed that the term "a goyishe kup" was
pejorative.  Always meant someone not very bright,
particularly when it was used in relation to a Jew.

Re tsatske & Chatchke, I was told that I remembered wrong
(which wouldn't be the first time and certainly won't be
the last).  And now that I think about it, they were right
-- chatchke was not used in my family and it sounds now
like an American term meaning toy or little something or
other.  One would never either devotedly or sarcastically
refer to a young girl or woman as a 'chatchkele' but
certainly would say "Oi is she a tsastkele' meaning either
someone wonderful or awful depending on the paralinguistic
intonation.

greeting!"  Nu, s'iz dokh nisht geven keyn vunder az mir

Tshatshke iz poshet a bilike nishtl, a "knickknack."  Elen

ikh nokh nisht araynshpringen.  Bay uns hot es shlekhte, (a
mol) gute un oykh neytrale taytshn.

A quick recap: Ellen Prince's "tsatske/le" explanation
rings true with the slight slant that in our family you
could also indicate a male as being a "tsatske/le" but it
usually meant a scoundrel or conniver of some sort whether
male or female.  Also the powerful pinch on the cheek that
our rabbi at Talmud- Torah used to give us kids as a
(usually) affectionate (!) greeting was called a "tsatske"
or "tsatskele"  Maybe because he would often call us
"tsatskele" when he did it (if my memory serves me well and
I may be a little off on what he called us (what term of
endearment he used) when he applied the pinch?

Ellen's description of "tshatshke" was right on.

I'll stay out of the goy/shikse/sheygets etc. fray for the
moment except to say that the term has negative, neutral,
and positive connotations in my meshpokhe depending on how
it's used.  An old friend of my mother's (also from the
Galician shtetl of Brody) once said (I guess she meant it
as a compliment; I was 17 at the time & my blond locks of
childhood had long since gone dark brown) "Oy zey nor, er
zet oys a gantsn sheygets; r'hot afile di noz fun a
sheygets.  I think I thanked her especially since I was
sure trying to blend in (to the hippy scene anyway) at the
time.  Then about twenty years later at a Hebrew class at
Oxford a young Jewish woman from South Africa in an
exercise in which we were supposed to describe each other
in Hebrew said of me, "Yesh lo af yehudi!"  Well, for some
reason or other, (by then I had developed my theory that
there's no such thing as "looking Jewish" certainly not
when it comes to biological features) I did anything but
thank her!  As a matter of fact, I called her a racist
(maybe not the right epithet...).  I suppose at my age I
should have been more charitable or explained calmly (which
is what I set out to do) why such a remark is so offensive.
Anyway I think my point is proved by my somehow having both
"di noz fun a sheygets" and an "af yehudi!"  Nor ikh farfor
in Boyberik...  Zayt gezunt un hot a shtarke noz!

In the light of the above discussion, here without comment
a fragment from a piece in the latest issue of Der Bay,
Vol 2 No 10, edited by Fishl Kutner.

The piece is entitled "Farvos Got Hot Khava [Eve]
Gemakht: A Komishe Biblishe Stsene".  The author is
Edvard M. Goldman, a composer of biblical and liturgical
music.

Got: Odom, vakht zikh oyf.  Haynt veln mir shisn tsvey hozn
     mit eyn shos.  Ikh vel ale khayes bafeln, zet zoln
     forbaygeyn far undz, du zolst zey banomenen.  Un, as
