Subject: Tsholnt/Shalet

I'm really glad that A. Manaster Ramer and Hershl Glasser put their feet down
:-) about amateur etymology of "tsholent" when a scholarly interpretation or
explanation already exists. Periodically we get a situation on Mendele, where
this happens, because this is primarily a scholarly list but there are Yiddish
"newbies" also. 

Having said that, I have to say that I was surprised that no one mentioned the
Western Yiddish form which, correct me please A. Manaster Ramer or Hershl,
is either Shalet or Sholet. I know enough to know that MHG ^a became o in most
places with Yiddish, but I believe Heinrich Heine called it Schalet. OK, now
we're going from tsholnt to a groyser tsimes! Es vet zikh alts oyspresn!

Subject: Beser Oystrakhtn ober Oysgefinen?

Beser heyst men mayn bruder an oystrakhter eyder an oysgefiner? My brother is
an inventor of commercial products. We are trying to ascertain his Yiddish
professional title. Is oystrakhter or oysgefiner more appropriate?  Tsi hot
men gekent a beser vort? 

A dank.

Subject: Samoa

Here at the University of Sydney we are embarking on an inaugural second year
Yiddish course in which we will spend 1-2 hours per week reading literature.
Since we are a relatively small class (5-6 students), I am endeavouring to
find pieces to cater to the interests and backgrounds of those presently
enrolled. I have no problem finding literature to suit most of my students
(South Africa, Australia, Israel and Biala Podlosk). However, I do not know of
(m)any Yiddish writers from Samoa! Can anyone on the Mendele list refer me to
any works which discuss/mention Samoa or even Polynesia in general? It would
be greatly appreciated, and quite interesting. 

A sheynem dank faroys,
Yasminke Dowling

Subject: Ikh hob dikh tzufil lib

In answer to Rokhel Bernard's query in 7.144, the words for "Ikh hob dikh
tzufil lib" are by Chaim Tauber, and the music is by Alexander Olshanetsky.

Subject: napoleon

Regarding the recent query on "napoleon", my bobe (who left Warsaw as a
teenager in 1920 or thereabouts) used to say (and please correct the spelling) 
"fun den artzn fransez" to mean "old and obsolete."  My mother always
translated this as "from the time of the first Napoleonic war."  Weinreb's
dictionary gives a different word for "war," though.

I have a chapter on (and recipe for)  tsholnt or tshulnt or cholent (as my
editors insisted it be spelled for an English audience) or tsolnt in MIRIAM'S
KITCHEN: A Memoir (Viking, 1997). Have gotten a certain amount of dogmatic
criticism because Miriam prepares it for Friday night instead of for Saturday
after shul. She's too frugal to leave her oven on for 24 hours, so Saturday
lunch is a cold meal. 

Regards,
Elizabeth Ehrlich

Subject: Swiss Yiddish

Vivian Aldridge writes [07.147] (about a Swiss Yiddish dialect documented by
Florence Guggenheim-Gru"nberg): "The Yiddish dealt with in that work is a
Western Yiddish dialect that - from the very little that I have seen of it -
seems to my untutored eye closer to a Swiss German with a great many Semitic
loan words than to the Eastern dialects which I mostly read and read about."

I am really saddened to have to point out that once again "untutored" 
impressions are misleading.  The whole issue has been discussed numerous
times, esp. by Florence Guggenheim-Gru"nberg herself in various articles, and
it is actually striking how UNconnected to Swiss German Swiss Yiddish actually
is: Swiss Yiddish shares any number of developments common to all of Yiddish
(e.g., diphthongs in words like hoyz 'house', where Swiss German has the old
monophthongs) or at least to large subgroups of Yiddish that extend far
outside of Switzreland (e.g., the split of 'kh' into two differnt sounds,
which we find as far as north as Holland and as far east as Western Poland). 
In fact, modern Swiss Yiddish appears to be a rather recent arrival in
Switzerland from somewhere in Southern Germany, and the influence of Swiss
german on it is entirely superficial, comparable to the influence of English
on U.S. Yiddish.

Subject: Pro-Am matters

I love Mendele. May it publish forever.

I retain a smattering of childhood memories of Yiddish, reinforced
occasionally by Theordore Bikel, Mickey Katz and The Barton Brothers. Thus
qualifying as the rankest of amateurs, I have one request of certain
"professional" contributors. 

In offering your wisdom concerning the origin of words or phrases, please do
it without having to diminish or embarrass someone's "amateur" efforts.
Amateur Yiddish-lovers are few and need nurturing, not punishing. Educate us
gently or you'll drive us away, like that teacher in kheder.. I realize that
this is not an easy thing to do.There's a cultural element in the combative
stance. After all, what kind of argument among Jews could it be if it weren't
highly adversarial? 

I'll even suggest a format, if you're having trouble:
"__________stated that "mir a zorg" derives from an Ethiopian curse. 
While this is an interesting interpretation, I believe ______________." 
See? No harm, no foul.
 
There was a recent request that we amateurs ask the professionals respectfully
rather than offer uninformed opinions. Another difficult assignment for Jews.
It is my baseless opinions that I offer most freely. But your request is fair
enough. Please tell me, what's Yiddish for "Lighten up."? 

zay mir gezint (or should it be gezunt?),

Subject: Ongetuen oyf terkish

In Mendele Vol 07.147 Ruchl Pudlowski Eissenstat asks, "Vos genoy maynt es, un
fun van un ven shtamt "Ongetuen oyf terkish". Oyf mir kan ze zich nish
farlozen vagin "fun van un ven".  However, to us it meant that what was
expected to be done was to help, assist, protect, etc. turned out to be the
opposite of what was expected.  The do'er was a turncoat to the do'ee.
