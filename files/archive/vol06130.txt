Subject: Computer terminology: povitinya

As for an appropriate translation for the world wide web, (WWW),
perhaps, something could be done with the word for web, as in spider
web.  I remember that my mother and aunt both used a word for cobweb, or
spider web, but I don't know if it is Yiddish, Romanian, German
(Austrian), or some slang from one of these.  Anyway, the word is,
"povitinya".  Has anyone else heard of this?

Subject: Language of Sholem Aleichem's letters

Louis Fridhandler [6.126,3] noted that according to Dos Sholem-Aleykhem
Bukh Sholem Aleichem's letters to family members were written in
Russian. In all three editions of Sholem Aleichem's Collected Works in
Russian (Moscow, 1959- 1961, 1971-1974, and 1988-1990) letters to family
members are translated from Yiddish. It is unlikely that the editors of
the Russian editions did not have access to the original letters and
used the reverse translations instead. They communicated with
I.D.Berkovich (his letter to the publisher of Jan 22, 1967 is quoted in
the book) and they used materials from Beit Sholem Aleichem in Tel Aviv
and from YIVO (Avrom Lis of Beit Sholem Aleichem and Bel Kaufman are
acknowledged for the help with the archive materials). Also letters are
sorted into sections according to the language of the original. Yet
another mistery?

Only small fraction of Sholem Aleichem's letters were ever published.
166 letters were published in Der Tog (New York, 1925) and 253 in Dos
Sholem-Aleykhem Bukh (New York, 1926 and 1958). About 100 letters were
published in Tsaitshrift (v.1, Minsk, 1926), Visnshaftlikhe Yorbikher
(v.1, Moscow, 1929), Shtern (No.3-4, Minsk, 1939), and in the book
"Sholem-Aleykhem: zamlung fun kritishe artiklen un materyaln" (Kiev,
Melukhe-farlag, 1940, 297 pp.). 210 letters were compiled in a book in
Yiddish by I.Mitelman and Kh.Nadel (Moscow, 1941). 227 letters were
published in the Collected Works in Russian (v.6, Moscow, 1990).

Subject: Bakhaynte shafung

Following in reb zelig Bach's footsteps [6.125] of finding a reymez in
an e-mail address I think it is difficult to beat Sylvia Schildt's.

After reading her lovely bakhaynte lines what better address could she
have had than creativ(a)[e]@charm. Could I say more?
