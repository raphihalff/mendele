Subject: Origin of Yiddish _nitl_ for Christmas

Ruben Frankenstein suggests that Yiddish _nitl_ derives from Latin
_natale_. The suggestion, which has some support in the literature, would
be strengthened by a demonstration of just how _natale_ "became" _nitl_.
The words are similar, yes, but it's not enough to point to similarities
to demonstrate a suggested etymology. German _Heirat_ and Hebrew _harey
at_ are NOT related. English _British_ and Hebrew _brit ish_ are NOT
related. We require detailed word history: By what process did the vowel
"a" in Latin _natale_ change to "i" in Yiddish? What other Latin
"a"-words changed are realized with "i"?

In the case of _nitl_, I favor the suggestion that it's derived from the
Hebrew root "tav-lamed-hey" 'to hang'; cf. _nitla_ 'to be hung'. The
related forms in Yiddish are _tlIye_ 'gallows' and, in Western Yiddish,
_tOle_ 'image of Jesus' (a crucifixion scene, I imagine).

Subject: Makhn a fayg

It's a bit difficult to demonstrate this familiar gesture on e-mail.
Surely it's no less rude than in Yiddish than showing someone the _fig-
in English, _Feige_ in German, or _fico_ in Italian. Any good dictionary
will describe it.

Subject: Translation of Yiddish teaching materials

This posting is directed to Yosl Mlotek, but perhaps other Mendeleniks
will want to comment.

First, on a personal note, I am currently involved in the Sino-Judaic
Institute, which in addition to its basic interest in the ancient Jews of
Kaifeng, also collects and publishes information of interest to the Jews
who lived in Shanghai and other Chinese cities from about 1900 to 1945.
Yosl Mlotek was one of the refugees from Poland (?) who came to Shanghai
via Japan during WWII. I was very interested to see the interviews he
provided in the film "Escape to the Rising Sun".

More to the subject in hand, I visited the Workman's Circle Education
Department and Library about 25 years ago and met Mr. Mlotek at that
time. I was on a search for appropriate curriculum materials for a
secular Sunday school that I and my wife were in the process of
developing. Yosl (and a lovely young lady) forced me to use Yiddish in
our discussions -- it was painful, but fun. I was somewhat aware of the
Yiddish teaching materials they had, but had no idea of the tremendous
breadth and depth of their library. It must be even better today!

They were not receptive to my suggestion that this Yiddish treasure, if
translated into English, could fill a need that was not being met for
Jewish secular schools that were then popping up all over the country. I
believe that the need is even greater today, and again suggest that
consideration be given to such translations.

The parents of school age children are now even further from their
"roots" than we were, and are finding it increasingly difficult to put
together a meaningful curriculum. The philosophy of the ArbeteRing is
just what the secular schools are looking for, and the "tam" of Yiddish
has the potential for providing a unifying glue to the school structure.
The available teaching materials and texts are still, as they were then,
too religious in content and insufficiently grounded in historical,
cultural, and sociological elements.

There are increasing opportunities for the teaching and learning of
Yiddish and I applaud what appears to be a resurgence in the life of the
language that we all love so dearly. But do we have to "vergien" our
younger people the chance to connect with their people through the beauty
of Yiddishkeit just because the venue is English?

Comments? Suggestions?
