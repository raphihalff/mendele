Subject: "Daytshmerizmen" un andere inyonim

In regard to D. Herskovic's attack on my previous posting, I must
politely ask him to reread my letters.  I never once objected to foreign
imports in Yiddish, I merely wondered about introducing the word
"please" if Yiddish already has a half dozen ways of expressing that
concept.  I can't find any statement in my postings or my published
writings implying that I in any way object to bringing neologisms in
from other languages--quite the opposite.  and I also wondered why
people who wish to "improve" Yiddish write in English.

as for my typing...well, it's obvious that I'm heavily influenced by
e.e.cummings.

benegye D. Herskovics onfal af mayn frierdik blitsbrivl muz ikh im

Subject: Who discovered the Beregovski archive and when?

Two years ago _Mendele_ readers were treated to an especially full,
informative and interesting introduction by the Russian folklorist and
musicologist Izaly Zemtsovsky.  I looked up the issue of 4 December
1994, Volume 4:214, where we read:

"You know, of course, the name of Moshe Beregovsky (1892-1961). It was I
who twice have saved his musical archives -- from Kiev to St.Petersburg
in 1966 and from St.Petersburg to the USA two years ago (thanks to the
support of the YIVO)."

"In 1992, October, on Chanukah, in St.Petersburg I organized the First
International Conference on Jewish Music. Now I am working on the
unpublished materials of Moshe Beregovsky, David Maggid, Michael Gnessin
and Zusman Kisselgof from Russian Archives."

Today I picked up _Ha-Arets_ and read the following notice by Noam Ben
Ze'ev (28/11/96), which I here translate freely:

Pres. of Ukraine Gives Ezer Weizmann Disk of Rare Jewish Music

"A disk with recordings of 18 rare selections from the musical riches of
Eastern European Jewry was presented a day before yesterday to Pres.
Ezer Weizmann by Pres. of Ukraine Leonid Koczma (sp?) who is currently
visiting Israel.  These recordings, which include cantorial items (among
them "the Kaddish of the Berditshever Rebe") and Sholem Aleykhem
speaking in his own voice, are from the collection of Moshe Beregovski,
a valuable treasure of recordings and transcriptions uncovered two years
ago in the Kiev National Library by Prof. Israel Adler of the Center for
Research in Jewish Music of the Hebrew University."

/Hebrew: "osef moshe beregovski... shehitgale... lifney shenatayim al
yedey haprof' yisrael adler...."/

"Among the thousands of items in the collection are Yiddish folk songs,
klezmer tunes, chasidic melodies, and vocal recordings of Habima actor
Chana Rovina and personalities like the philospher Hermann Cohen and the
composer Michael Gnessin.  This magnificent archive, which preserves the
musical traditions of Eastern European Jewry from the end of the
nineteenth century to the Shoa, had been thought lost since 1949, the
year collecting and classifying ceased upon the banishment to Siberia of
Moshe Beregovski, head of the project."

"Discovery of the archive, which in addition to recordings includes
manuscripts of thousands of melodies and 17,000 microfilms, aroused
great excitement in the ethnomusicological world, resulting in an
agreement between the Ukrainian library and the National Library in
Jerusalem, with the cooperation of the Hebrew University and
international bodies such as the Musical Council of Unesco.  The archive
was to be copied and catalogued in Israel but the Kiev library was slow
to implement the agreement.  It is hoped in Israel that the gift of the
disk to the President augurs well for the fulfillment of the agreement
in the near future."

Would some knowledgeable Mendele reader please comment.
