Subject: Sign in a Health Food Store

For some reason this struck me as funny (more odd then humorous) enough
to share:

I saw a sign in a health food store that carried the message, "No
Smoking," in many different languages.  Naturally, the Hebrew lettering
on the sign jumped out at me, so I took a closer look. The message was
identified as Hebrew, but it read, "Biteh Nit Tzu Raykherin."  Not only
did they get the language wrong, they started with a daytchmerism --
biteh (bet yod tet ayin).

Subject: Duits/deutsch

To: Marion Aptroot

One problem I have with Mendele (MY problem) is that I remember fragments
to base my anecdotes, and I often wonder whether I'm remembering clearly.
Your posting on High/Low German was so wonderful for me because you were
able to flesh out the half-remembered fragments that proved *accurate*.
I've been studying languages for years but darn if I can remember where I
saw something.

On a personal level, my family is VERY Platt. I have relatives named
Sellschopp, LaMotte, all very typical from Bremen. Even Martini is not
necessarily Italian, it's very German, too. My father "snakt Plat" pretty
well, and I love the dialect speech in T. Mann's Buddenbrooks, which my
father considers mandatory reading for anyone in our large extended clan
that migrated to Peru 150 years ago. "These are your roots" he always
said.

When I read Die Reste des Juedischdeutschen I was quite surprised to see
the word schoufel, which I knew as a Dutch word sjofel (yes, I did have
to study Dutch to understand it. Our family gave up Platt about 3 gene-
rations ago). In Berlin, whose dialect has many Platt features,my father
heard a lot of Yiddish, which I judged inaccurate, but since reading the
above-mentioned book, I recognize as Mayrev.

Coming back to old perceptions about Low/High Duits, Heinrich Heine once
made a remark about the corrupt state of German among Polish Jews. Here
again historical perceptions at that time were different than they are
now. To what extent the Eastern Jews thought of *themselves* as "German"
outside of Germany would be a fascinating thing to know.  Heine and
others seemed to feel that Yiddish was a peculiar form of German. Even
*in* Germany, people would say "he talks like a Jew" rather than saying,
"He speaks Yiddish".

Subject: Help with Culinary terms

Can anyone help with the following? I'm concerned with a number of
culinary terms, of varying regional distributions in Yiddish, with
correspondents in German. Some appear to be near-synonyms, at least
partially overlapping in meaning and, in the style of many dictionaries,
often impossibly defined in terms of one another.

I don't need any more dictionary definitions. Can anyone who knows more
than one of these words in Yiddish or in German tell me what they mean in
their own "idiolect"? Are they the same or different in their own (active
ao passive) culinary repertoire? What distinguishes them? Do they apply
to the preparation of meat only, or to other foods, as well? In each
case, "How do you do it?"

i) German "daempfen", Western Yiddish "geduempft (fla:sh)", Eastern
Yiddish "gedemft/gedempt";

ii) G. "schmoren", WY "geshmort (fla:sh)", "geshmouert" in western Poland
and "geshmort" at a few locations in Latvia; otherwise, unknown in the
East;

iii) G."duensten", WY "geduenstet (fla:sh)", EY in southern Poland and
the Carpathians "gedintst"; otherwise unknown in the East;

iv) Yiddish in Northeastern Poland and 4 or 5 locations in WY:
"geshmerglt (flaysh/fla:sh); in Lithuania and Latvia, something
derogatory. Unknown elsewhere in Yiddish. I find no obvious German
correspondent.

Do any of the words overlap with G. "braten", Y. "brotn/bru:tn" 'to
roast'.

The English glosses that appear to be implicated in this are primarily:
'stewed' and 'braised'.

My thanks in advance.

Subject: The Yiddish Atlas--An opportunity

The Yiddish Dialect Atlas (Yidisher shprakh- un kultur-atlas) is being
published by the Max Niemeyer Verlag in Tuebingen, Germany. It is being
copublished by YIVO, New York. Volume II will appear in the Fall.

As you may know, YIVO is in the throes of preparing to move to new
quarters. The building at 5th Ave and 86th St. has been sold. By
August-September YIVO will have moved into temporary quarters. All it
holdings will have to be moved twice, first to temporary quarters or
storage facilities, and after about 18 months to new permanent quarters.

In order to minimize the trauma of the double move, YIVO is prepared to
sell its remaining copies of Volume I of the Atlas, to YIVO members, at a
deep discount. If you are a member of YIVO and would like to acquire a
copy, reply to me directly, and I will provide you with additional
details. My address: zogur@cuvmb.cc.columbia.edu

Subject: Heirat and harey at, again! Again?

We've danced to this one before. There is NO discernible relationship
although the negative is hard to demonstrate. German Heirat is, if I
recall correctly, also related to English "hired" as in "hired man".
There should be a rather comprehensive statement on the subject that Arn
Abramson posted a 2 or three years go. Is it retrievable through the
index

Subject: Yiddish word for marry

German "heiraten" = "to marry." I don't know the origin of the word, but
it's quite common in German, and it's the only German word I can think of
with that meaning.

Subject: Yiddish word for marry

Well, the modern German word for "marry" is indeed "heiraten" and a
glance in an etymological dictionary shows that it has been around in
Middle High German as well.  So chances are that it is the origin of the
Yiddish word and the similarity to the wedding formula is just
coincidental.

Subject: Oyver butl/eyver botl

Not having grown up in a Jewish home, I can't say that I know the
contexts of this expression. I remember in the movie Hester Street,
during the main characters' divorce, that the rabbi, played by Tsvi
Scooler, says that their marriage is "botl", which I took to mean "empty"
or "void". Oyver/eyver means "limb" as far as I know, and the expression
Oyver botl can carry the meaning of "useless thing" "worthless
thing/person". I remember a record album of Dr. Murray Banks, who did
Yiddish comedy routines, talked at length about expressions of
discomfort. Es tsit mir in hintn; es zhavet mir in linken *eyver*. Could
it be that the meaning is something like a limb, which is designed to be
a functioning part becomes a "drag" when it's "botl"? Useless appendage
might be a translation; albatross around one's neck. Someone please
correct me; this is only what I've inferred from my experience with the
expression.
