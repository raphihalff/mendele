Question: Do most Mendele readers understand the above, or should
one only/also write in English?

Subject: Vegn zikh

I just subscribed to MENDELE yesterday, so let me present myself and
describe my interest in Yiddish.

Originally from Scarsdale, NY, I am now a freshman at Princeton
University pursuing an AB (what Princeton calls a BA).

I began studying Yiddish at YIVO during January of my sophomore year
of high school.  It was a weekly night class that met around 15
times per semester.  I continued until the spring of my senior year,
progressing through the levels.  I was taught by Jeff Shandler and
Peysek Fiszman, respectively.

This past summer, I attended the Oxford Programme in Yiddish, where
I studied early-modern Yiddish literature under Dov-Ber Kerler and
the writers and poets of the Soviet period under Gennadi Estraikh. I
can read Yiddish perfectly, understand it nearly completely, and
speak it just about as well.

I am interested in participating in discussions about all-things
Yiddish, from literature to language to the culture in general.

Presently, I'm looking for untranslated Yiddish poetry for
translation and publication in an English-language literary journal.
I would appreciate suggestions and advice about the legal aspects of
printing translated works. Finally, although I guess I will figure
this question out, what transcription are we using--YIVO?  Should I
spell Sholem Aleichem thus, or Sholem Aleykhem.  Should I indicate
stress with capital letters?  Please respond.

Subject: Chaim Weizmann & Mottele

To Moshe Waldoks, a late thanks for pointing out that my
grandmother- in-law was a neighbor of Chaim Weizmann in Mottele (in
what is now Belorus). My grandmother-in-law (Zeyta) had this to say
about Mottele & Chaim Weizmann (she mixed Eng. & Yiddish freely):

      Mottele was very small; in ganz Mottele is ein store haut
      farkeft salt near our house there haut givaynt Chaim Weizmann;
      his father's business was something like my father's: choppin
      the holtz & taking it all over he went out when he was 14 or
      15, & I was maybe 2: er iz aveck in England, and ich a couple
      of years later aveck in America

      When they started unterwaffen (Nickolaien), then they went
      zuchen, and they went to Chaim Weizmann's house; his mother
      wouldn't tell them nothing, she flecht azay machen that she
      did not know, then wenen zay gehen in the andere heiser

Zeyta's whole story is excellent, I wanted to contribute it.

Subject: Re: "Pinchas"

Can anyone tell me what "Pinchas" means in Yiddish?  (Perhaps the
nayer mitglider vos heys Pinchas. . .)

A friend recently showed me a booklet she had obtained through
inter-library loan which was a "memory book" for a town in the
Ukraine called (I believe) "Kovel" or something like that.  It had
photos and information about the people who had lived there, members
of the Kahile (maybe)and biographical information, although I didn't
have time to read it then.  It was rather lengthy and all in
Yiddish.  My friend said this was called a "Pinchas" and that word
was in the title.

A dank.
