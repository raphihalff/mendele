Subject: Sholem-Aleykhem's Mazepevke and Mazeppa

Louis Fridhandler (6.215) asks:

  Could anyone in this khevre, expert in English literature, throw light
  on whom Byron's Mazeppa was modeled?  Was it simply Byron's
  imagination?

It was not.

  Perhaps his Mazeppa was a relative of the successor to Khmielnitski?

Hardly relative in blood or social stratum - I have Mazepa as a Polish
and magnat, not an Ukrainian nor kosack - but surely in feeling
(Chmielnicki was a paragon of cruelty, too) and in rebellous mind. Even
if Chmielnicki revolted Ukraina against Poland, then surrendered it to
Russia, and Mazepa, some sixty years later, revolted it against Russia.

The question should be redirected to experts in Polish-Ukrainian history
_and_ in Polish literature. `Mazepa' is the title of a extremely
well-known Polish classic piece of XIX century. The protagonist, a
rather ill-behaved personage, was modelled on a historical person with
the same name.

The Polish `Mazepa' is a work of the Polish Romanticism period which,
later than the German Romanticism, stretch well into the second half of
XIX century, but began earlier; the links to Byron exists.

This `Mazepa', a spectacular crime and horror story, could have been
translated or at least reviewed in West languages. Maybe there were
earlier Polish works about him; I feel there were some musical works on
Mazepa theme and it could have been the way Mazepa libretto became known
internationally, why not to Byron.

There is an - I believe, French - color movie `Mazepa', with good Polish
actors. I recall it was as done by a Polish movie-maker who became
France-resident. A respectable, well reviewed movie and renomed maker,
so it should be find in film-dictionaries. Check for the story in some.

I have no Polish literature sources at hand and only some memories of
childhood lectures (the famous scene of barbaric sadism behind
description). As I have not read the Byron's work, I will return with
relevant details later.

*

The old 'Little Encyclopedy' of Polish Scientific Editions, the only I
have here (Warsaw 1958; in Polish; a reputedly bad source!), mentions
the historical Mazepa as follows:

  Mazepa. Jan Mazepa (Jan Kolodynski, 1644-1709, known as Mazepa.
  1687 M. becomes the hetman*> of Ukraina (left-side Ukraina).
  1708 - linked to the King of Sweden Carl XII - M. starts on
  Ukraina an uprising against Russia. Dies in exil in Turkey.

---
*> 'Hetman' is a Polish (maybe Ukrainian too) term I would translate as
   'warlord'. A Polish legal and very honorific term for army-leaders;
   whether hetmans were appointed by kings, or elected by szlachta on
   sejms, I am unsure. Plain szlachta was eligible for the hetman
   dignity I gather there existed even at least one nominated/elected
   Polish hetman born a peasan.

   But the 'hetman' title happened to be assumed by self-appointed
   leaders of an uprising, as by Bohdan Chmielnicki himself.

    The text I am translating here gives no clue whichever - possibly both
    - kind of hetman Mazepa was.
---

That the Little Encyclopedy does not mentions the sadistic issue does
not mean it was unexistent. The PC of Polish/Ukrainian/USSR 50-ies would
be, as known, to freely - or rather following the political direction of
the historical personage in question - play such triffles as cruelty up
or down.

I will try to return to the historic issue when I dig up something more
substantial. But as the traditional Polish ones can be biased when
Ukraina is in question, the Ukrainian sources to whom I have no links
should be asked, too.

Subject: Sholem-Aleykhem's Mazepevke and Mazeppa

Louis Fridhandler's query about the origins of Sholem Aleichem's
Mazepevke: When I reach far back into childhood the word "mazepa" starts
to resonate, but not with any of the scary associations of the
historical Mazeppa, the Cossack scourge, but with one of the many names
with which my Polish-speaking mother used to address me, i.e., "You
mazepa." This doesn't exclude the link to the historical figure, but
certainly tempers it a bit, and, assuming that this use was not just
unique to my mother, makes its association with a Jewish hicksville a
bit more understandable. The associations are: mock-heroic, shlemiel-
like, the mouse that roared, etc.

Nu khaveyrim, tsi efsher zenen andere mendelyaner oykh amol geven kleyne
mazepes?

I've been asked to participate in our little reform congregation's
upcoming Purim celebration. Can anyone suggest something -- a Yiddish
poem or short story, perhaps, that would be appropriate for the
occasion?

Subject: Bet hemder

I would like to re-post a query I sent to the list last week on behalf
of someone else, with some clarifications provided by the researcher.

In the Kaufman edition of Gluckel von Hameln (Frankfort am Main, 1896),
on p. 36, there is the following sentence:

"das bet hemder das mein grosmutter nebbich in mein mutter geben hat das
zelbig hat ihr mein mutter als weider geben..."

The phrase in question is "bet hemder."  Please excuse any faults in the
Yiddish, as I am only a beginner in it and took down the information
over the phone. There may be some mispellings in the sentence.

Thanks for any help list members can give on this.
