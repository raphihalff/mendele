Subject: Re Etymology of "baleboste"

Jonathan Jacobson asks (v14n34) about the Etymology of "baleboste"

Both your explanation of the current meaning, that is <<1. Boss  (female),
owner, master, proprietor, hostess and 2. A capable, efficient  housewife,
esp. a traditional Jewish one, devoted to maintaining a well-run  home.>> are
correct, but the etymology (i.e. the study of the word's  origin) is from the
Hebrew ba'al bayit, that is the owner of the house, and  idiomatically the
owner. Owners takes care of their property better than  outsiders, and so
efficiency is assumed. So for male is "balabos" or  "balebos" and for female
it became "balaboste" or "baleboste".

Harkavy's Dictionary brings along these line the definition of "baleboste"
"female owner of a house, land lady, mistress" and Weinreich for "bal'bos"
simply brings the Hebrew Ba'al bayit.

Subject: Geographic variations in New World Yiddish

North American Yiddish differs from European Yiddish by the inclusion of some
English words but it also has different word meanings. Perhaps the best known
example of the latter is the word shtetl, which means town in European Yiddish
but tiny village, what would be dorf or dorfele in Old World Yiddish, in New
World Yiddish.

New World Yiddish also has slang terms that were unknown in Europe. For
example, the Yiddish speakers of the Canadian Prairie Provinces of Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta used the slang term Gimelah for their Ukrainian
neighbors. This was because (Western Canadian) Ukrainians were from the
Austro-Hungarian province of Galicia and the letter g in the Hebrew alphabet
is gimel.

I first became aware of possible geographic variations in New World Yiddish
when I asked a fluent Yiddish speaker, originally from Toronto, the president
of our local Peretz Society no less, about Gimelah and he had never heard the
term. While New World Yiddish slang for Ukrainians had an origin that was
geographic and alphabetic, the origin of New World Yiddish slang for Italians
was gastronomic. Lokshen, literaly noodles in Yiddish, was Yiddish slang for
Italians in both Alberta and New York City. So I assume it was universal in
North America.  Gimelah for Ukrainians and Lokshen for Italians were unknown
in Old World Yiddish. Quoting directly my father, "When the family was in
Russia, we never (even) heard of Italians.".

So here are the questions. Is anyone not from the Canadian Prairies familiar
with Gimelah = Ukrainians? Are there any other geographic variations in North
American Yiddish?  What about Australian Yiddish or South African Yiddish?  Or
South American Yiddish?

Subject: Re: keyn shum hant

"arbetloz iz keyn shum hant" is very easy. It means "No hand is without work
(unemployed)." Nisht/nit is left out often in poetry, a kind of daytshmerizm
that is vaguely acceptable. Also, the "zikh" in "mir zingen zikh a lid"
doesn't mean "ourselves," we are not singing a song to ourselves. It is simply
a dative of interest, intensifyiing. We're belting out a song. May I be so
bold to say that there are people out there who are translating Yiddish who
have no business doing that. I'm glad Aaron Lansky thinks he has
singlehandedly saved a vanishing culture... If this is the Yiddish world saved
by Aaron Lansky, I'd hate to think what the Yiddish world would look like had
Aaron Lansky not saved it. Without going to Gellerian excesses, I would ask
that people who have arrived at the stage of deciphering some Yiddish not
believe they are experts yet!

Subject: Re: Tsoyzmer

Regarding Nathan Weinstock's question as to whether  there is a Polish town
named "Tsoyzmer," YIVO News No. 197, Winter 2003 suggests that this is another
name for Sandomierz.  The issue, available at
http://www.yivoinstitute.org/pdf/yedies197.pdf in an item entitled "New
Accessions to the YIVO Archives," has the following sentence: "Dr. Seymour
Bortner donated a Polish account of the Jews of Kamien, near Sandomierz
(Tsoyzmer), Poland."

There is a town in Poland called in Yiddish: Tsuzmir. (In Polish: Sandomierz)
Tsuzmir, in the area of Kielce, is one of the oldest medieval shtetlakh in
Poland. Most of the Jews of Tsuzmir perished in Treblinka and in
Skarzysko-Kamienna Concentration Camps. Fro more information about Tsuzmir,
see: page:1132- Sandomierz. (Volume 2, "The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life,

Subject: Re: hakn a tshaynik

It is my impression is that it was a slang term among itinerant klezmorim. In
their private language, much as we know American jazz musicians have their own
language, a trombone was known as a tshaynik, a samovar, both being made of
shiny brass. To hak a tshaynik was to play the trombone.

Subject: Re: hakn a tshaynik

The idea of spinning any piece of headgear on a finger is an obvious
metaphor for killing time unproductively. However, I think 'hakn a tshaynik'
is most simply 'banging on a teapont' as a metaphor for creating a
disturbing noise as a distraction.
