Subject: Seminar in Shefayim

We have just returned from a Shorashim sponsored seminar at the Guest House
in Shefayim, "Who's afraid of Yiddish?" It last from April 23-24 and
included excellent lectures by Professor Khavah Turniawsky, Dr.  Avraham
Novershtern, and Dr. Hayah Fridberg. A lecture on Yiddish film by Nahman
Ingber was less satisfactory because the videos he projected onto a giant
screen became fleeting shadows. A talk on the Bund by journalist Yitshak
Loden left much to be desired.  Entertainment included Yossl Birstein and
his stories; Aviv and Arik Livnat and their jazzy klezmer band, and Natan
Yonatan talking about Itzik Manger accompanied by Ruti Levin's magnificent
renditions of Manger songs. There was also a surprise appearance by Nehama
Lifshitz.  The most disappointing aspect of an otherwise very successful
seminar was the fact that almost all of the talks were in Hebrew!

                        LETTER FROM STRASBOURG

I dream in Yiddish.  My grammar isn't so good, but my grandma would have
been pleased.  Last summer, I participated in "Yiddish in Alsace," a three-
week seminar that increased my facility in Yiddish and introduced me to
Strasbourg's flourishing Ashkenazi Jewish community, secure in its identity,
welcoming Jews in the tradition of Abraham. 

Strasbourg hosted the program because Paris flashed a Save Our Seminar when
the World Cup runneth over, making accommodations and airline tickets hard
to get. A group of creative Jewish Alsacians, Le Theatre en L'Air, organized
the program, arranging for top-notch faculty and accommodations at the ORT
school, and personally conducting interest groups in singing, drama,
Alsacian Yiddish and Alsacian Jewish cooking. 

Our group was small, twenty-eight people, western Europeans except for six
Americans and a seventeen-year-old Warsaw Jew from Krochmalna Street. 
Publicity was primarily on the Internet. Next year's seminar in Belgium will
be promoted more extensively. 
        
A city of 256,000, Strasbourg has a Jewish deputy mayor who speaks Yiddish. 
With flowers, canals, and bridges Strasbourg exceeds its sobriquet of Little
Venice. The Jewish community is unique and united. A directory lists five
kosher restaurants and four kosher butchers.  Jewish education? Ten schools,
from gan to ORT vocational. There's a Jewish radio program, a Jewish
library, and a Jewish travel bureau.  In the central synagogue, services are
in Ashkenazi Hebrew, and the gabbai wears a Napoleonic bicorn hat.  A
leaflet wishes worshippers "Chabbat Chalom,"  announces life-cycle events,
and lists nine different synagogues, including Sephardic and "Loubavitch." 
        
But behind this bright picture of Jewish life are pentimenti, visible traces
of a dark past: notice of a National Day commemorating "persecutions
racistes et antisemites"; an announcement of a memorial voyage to
Auschwitz-Birkenau.  The beautiful ORT building with its courtyard in which
we dined alfresco was used by the Nazis for holding facilities. 
        
The Strasbourg Jewish community was intensely involved in "Yiddish in
Alsace." They were our mishpoche. At Shabbat dinners, families sang with us
and regaled us in Yiddish. Our schedule was circulated; local people of all
ages attended our classes. Reporters covered the cooking class and debutante
(beginning) Yiddish class for the TV evening news. 
        
Le Theatre en L'Air presented outstanding programs. Rafael Goldwaser, an
Argentinean actor/director from Habimah, translates plays from Hebrew to
Yiddish with the balletic ease of his on-stage agility.  Pre-performance
explanations are in French and English. A solo evening of three unusual
Sholem Aleychem stories was as light and delicious as a challah with a
professional sheen. Another evening, a different mood:  Rafael's second
play, "Tonton Arthur," was about a Shoah survivor.  Goldwaser, different in
style, equals Maurice Schwartz and Menashe Skulnik in talent.  A spark
rather than a star, he ignites and illuminates the soul. 
        
"The Yiddishe Mamas and Papas" were the musical offshoot of Le Theatre en
L'Air. The Mamas, Isabel Marx-Roos and Astrid Ruff, helped facilitate
"Yiddish in Alsace." Astrid taught Yiddish songs of the shtetl, the Shoah,
and surprisingly, American immigrants: "Belz" and "Di Grine Kuzine."
Hmm... Had I come all the way to Strasbourg to sing the songs of the Lower
East Side? Was this a courtesy to us Americans? 
         
Understanding dawned when we saw The Yiddishe Mamas and Papas perform
outdoors in Molsheim to a sellout crowd, almost all non-Jews. The sun set,
the stage lit up, and out came the Yiddishe Mamas, Isabel and Astrid, in
tight black dresses. Sinuous arms unfolded, hips kept time to the music and
voices spiraled and harmonized. Acknowledging their debt to the Barry
Sisters, they were shopgirls on a day off or dutiful daughters telling their
mothers they were in love. They were the vocal equivalent of the klezmer
revival. The Papas were three expert jazz musicians. The beat varied from
doo-wop to rock but was primarily klezmerized jazz.  Good thing it was an
outdoor concert because the applause would have brought the house down.  CDs
sold like latkes. 
        
Suddenly, the antiques in the basement of my mind had acquired value. I
thought of my mother, who put stones in her pockets so she would weigh
enough to get her work permit and give her unopened paycheck to her Mama
and
Papa, of my grandmother, who kept a bowl of cold water to wash her eyes so
she could stay awake sewing piecework. I understood that Europeans value
American Jewish history.  Our European classmates became subscribers to the
Yiddish Forward. For the Alsacians all things Jewish were precious, saved
from destruction. 
        
"Yiddish in Alsace" became part of a program of 130 events and 13 days of
"open house" for many of 200 Alsacian Jewish sites described in a
community-written historical brochure circulated by the tourist bureau. 

Jews came to the Rhine valley with the Roman legions.  In 1349 the Jews of
Strasbourg were expelled, accused of fostering the Black Plague by poisoning
the wells. Many were killed; the rest fled to villages. At the eve of the
French Revolution there were with 20,000 Jews in 180 Alsacian communities,
more than half the Jewish population of France. Napoleon granted them
citizenship in 1791 so they could serve in his army.  The Alsacian Jewish
community prospered until the Nazi occupation in 1940. More than a quarter
of the Jews were killed in the Shoah. 
        
Our group toured village synagogues, deciphering inscriptions on old
buildings and, in old cemeteries, reciting the Hebrew names of those long
gone.  Outside the Colmar synagogue, the French government had placed a
plaque apologizing for the wartime conduct of the "soi-disant" (Vichy) 
government.  Still active, the synagogue is empty of pews in the center, a
reminder of Jews killed by the Nazis.  Pierre Levy, a volunteer, opened the
ark, revealing many torahs: memorials, I noted, to lost communities. "The
torahs were saved by the town firemen," he said. "Not Jews. When the Nazis
entered a town the firemen took the torahs and hid them in the firehouse. I
want to put up a plaque to honor the firemen." 
        
Colmar's Bartholdi museum, home of the designer of the Statue of Liberty,
housed a collection of Judaica including a coffin-shaped drinking vessel
inscribed with the names of Colmar's chevra kadisha.  A member of the
society told us that they drank from that cup at their annual meeting.  I
did not ask whether they drank l'chaim. 
        
The spires of the synagogues and town halls of Alsace looked like
traditional Ashkenazi b'somim boxes. The fragrant vineyards and haystacks
were my b'somim. I was part of a braided havdalah candle, intertwined with
the Jews of Europe, kindled by love of Yiddish. 
        
The Jewish community joined us for our last dinner in Strasbourg.  The
choral group sang, the drama group told a folk tale. The kosher Bordeaux was
consumed and replenished.  Then my classmate Avrom rose to speak.  He's a
round silver-fringed-bald Belgian with an easy laugh. His hand trembling
with emotion, he read his speech in Yiddish.  (I use his English version.) 

        "I remember today the words of my Yiddish teacher: 'For an
         Ashkenazi Jew, to find one's complete and true identity, one must
         turn to Yiddish.'

        "I couldn't for one instant imagine to what extent this return
         would provoke such deep emotions.  From the very depths of my
         subconscious, from a source pure and clean, the Yiddish language
         surged. It's like a forgotten melody that rocked me in my tender
         childhood.  And each day of intensive study is a joy for me.

        "I have the feeling of rediscovering the memory of my parents, my
         grandparents and my ancestors.  It's as if I'm finally reciting
         kaddish for them... Thank you [God] for having given me my soul
         back."
        
He then recited the Modeh Ani, the prayer of thanks to God upon awakening.
He "signed" his speech Avrom ben David Itzhok from Brussels. 
        
When Avrom returned to my table, I kissed him on both cheeks. It's a French
custom I think I'll adopt.  Avrom found the world of his fathers.  I,
however, intensified my study of mame loshn, the Yiddish of my mothers.  I
am...

Elanor Reiter from Chicago

p.s. The next seminar will take place in Brussels, in the Martin Buber
Institute, on July 5-16, 1999. More details in Mendele personal notices
