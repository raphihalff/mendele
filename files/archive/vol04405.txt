I'm a new "member" of Mendele and want to introduce myself. My name is
Barbara Rosen (blrosen@umich.edu) and I'm the Judaica cataloguer at the
University of Michigan. I'm really enjoying Mendele a lot so, a sheynem

Subject: Introduction

I am a professor of mathematics at the Univ. of Massachusetts in Boston
and  I grew up in Brighton Beach,  the first child of an immigrant family
(Bessarabia & Minsk). Yiddish was my primary language until kindergarten.

After coming to Brookline from Hyde Park, Chicago, where we lived for 14
years and raised two  children, I began attending  Rabbi Ben Zion Gold's
Yiddish class at Harvard-Radcliffe Hillel.  In the summers of '85 and '86
I studied Yiddish in the Oxford Yiddish Summer Program, under  two superb
teachers: Dovid Katz and Itzak Niborski .  I published an article in the
June 1986 Packentrager describing and reflecting on the experience.
Thereafter, two times I was fortunate to be able to attend Niborski's
Sunday seminar in Paris, which  starts at 10 in the morning and ends at
five. Something like the Boston Marathon.

Through the Albert E. Marks Charitable Trust, a family foundation, my
wife Judith and I have been supporting a  series of talks in Yiddish at
the Boston Workmen's Circle  (1782 Beacon Street). The seventh and last
speaker this year is Rakhmiel Peltz, Director of Yiddish Studies at
Columbia University. The date is Sunday, June 18 at 2.30. The title is:
"Yiddish and Jewish Nationalism in the Early 20th Century: The Case of
Ber Boroknov".  All are welcome.

Subject: Introduction

My name is Jack Sklansky.  I grew up in the Williamsburg section of
Brooklyn during the thirties.  At that time and place, at least four
Yiddish newspapers were published.  My father read one of them, chosen
somewhat arbitrarily, each day. He taught me to read them.  Until the age
of 6, Yiddish was my primary tongue. But, sorry to say, I lost most of my
fluency in it as I grew older.

I am a semi-retired Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering
living in Newport Beach, California -- which is a great cultural distance
from the Yiddishkeit of my youth. So it is with great pleasure and
gratitude that I sense a wonderful renewal of the Yiddish language and
culture of my parents and their ancestors in Belarus and Ukraine.

A hartziken dank zu mendele.

Jack ("Yankel") Sklansky

Subject: Yiddish on cd-rom

I have recently been pondering this very same question.  In fact, I have
been pondering for a long time the question of digitizing Yiddish for
computer access.  A related problem is adapting current scanner
technology to recognize and correctly scan Yiddish text into the
computer.  I believe there is such equipment available for Hebrew from
the Davka Corporation.

Besides the purely computer-related technical questions, there are
business and legal questions to consider.  Copyright works cannot be
published on cd-rom without express permission of the copyright holders.
To put out a cd-rom, one would need to track down the copyright owners
and work out contracts with them.

If there is anyone on Mendele who would be interested in pursuing this
further, I would be glad to hear from them.  If we can round up the
necessary technical expertise to actually proceed with such a project, I
would be glad to act as a coordinator or project leader.  I suggest that
interested parties contact me directly at <hkatz@earth.usa.net> rather
than clutter up Mendele.  Naturally, anyone wishing to discuss the topic
further, rather than volunteering, should reply to Mendele.
