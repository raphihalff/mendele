Subject: "Vot ken you makh? Es iz amerike!"

On the CD Dave Tarras Yiddish-American Music, this satirical song by Secunda and 
Lebedeff expresses the shock of an immigrant at the world turned upside-down that he 
finds here. He exclaims in Yinglish, "Vot ken you makh?" instead of "Vot ken you tu?" 
which would be a closer approximation of the Yiddish, "Vos ken men tun?" Can 
someone explain that choice of verb?

Subject: "Vi halt men bay zey"

A few remarks:
1. The *shoyn *is essential to the meaning of the structure, which expresses a wish.
2. The fact [that] it begins with the interrogative *vi *"how," does not necessarily make it 
a question, any more than English "How I wish you were here!"
3. The intonation of the sequence is not of a question, but of an exclamative, with the 
peak being on the verb *halt.*

Subject: vakans

Sholem aleykhem,

I apologize first for not knowing so well the right orthography for transliterating Yiddish.  
I have a family letter written in Yiddish by a relative from France in 1949.  She was a 
Holocaust survivor from the Bialystock region of Poland.  In the letter she writes "Mir 
hobn gevolt forn af vakans keyn yisroel, leyder hot undz es nisht gelungen, veyl undzere 
poylishe peser zaynen oysgegangen, un der poylisher konsulat hat zey nisht gevolt 
benayen."

My question is about the use of "vakans."  I am assuming it means vacation as in the 
French word "vacance."  I have only seen "vakatsye" for vacation.
Is using vakans this way common or accepted Yiddish?  Is it a dark humor way to 
highlight that the Polish authorities are getting in the way of her husband and her making 
it to Israel?  Does it mean something else altogether?

In June, YIVO launched a new blog, YEDIES: News from YIVO,

The new YEDIES features: 
 
*Interviews with authors and book excerpts. Recent interviewees have included Antony 
Polonsky about his 3-volume series, The Jews in Poland and Russia; Jay Berkovitz on 
Yiddish and sex in the 18th-century Pinkas of Metz; and Katka Reszke on the resurgence 
of Jewish identity in Poland. 
 
*Yiddish content by Itsik Gottesman, including an article on how the music and texts of 
the songs of a 19th century badkhn, wedding entertainer, have been "reunited" in the 
YIVO archives (sound recording included). 
 
*Di nyu-yorkerin, a monthly column by Sarah Ponichtera on what's hot and Yiddish in 
New York and beyond. 
 
*From the Pages of Yedies: a look back at YIVO and Jewish history through the pages of 
Yedies, which has been publishing since 1925. 
 
*Podcasts of YIVO's radio show on WEVD from the 1960s-70s. 
 
New posts are added to YEDIES every week.

Subject: Bintl Briv

Does anyone have copies of any of the letters in the original Yiddish of  "A Bintl Briv"? 
The archivist at the Forverts says they have none of the original letters in their archives is 
unaware of any published collection of the letters in Yiddish.

Thank you,
