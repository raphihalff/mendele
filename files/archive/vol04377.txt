Subject: Vos makhst du?

My father, who was born in Kamionka-Strumilova and grew up in
Zamarstynow, a suburb of Lwow, (both shtetls in Galicia) used to answer
to "Vos makhst du" with "Ich makh in di hosen," which roughly translated
means "I make in my pants."  But that seems to be more an answer to "Vi
makhst du?" or "How are you doing?" and maybe that was the question.

A belated thanks to those who gave me information about Zamartynow.

Subject: Vos makhst du?

My father-in-law's standard answer to "Vos makhst du?" is
"Ikh makh zikh nisht visn".  I've heard this from other
people as well.

Subject: _poem for a mendelnik, janet hadda_

i won't get into the can of worms over whether we should sit shiva for
yiddish but i do want to comment on something else suggested/insinuated
by the poem posted by marjorie schonhaut hirshan in the following lines:

            Only lonely professors
            carrying the burden
            of millions of silent graves
            as single alien guest
            in Departments of German.

i infer from these lines that it is considered sad or bad or something
else negative that yiddish is taught in 'departments of german'. to this
i respond:

1. any 'department of german' that teaches yiddish is in _fact_,
   if not in _name_, a 'dept of _germanic_'.
2. yiddish is a germanic language--where _else_ should it be taught??
   (the only germanic language typically taught outside of german(ic)
   depts is english, for obvious social, political, economic, and
   cultural reasons. and it is certainly not grouped with any _other_
   languages.)
3. i do not know the composition of the ucla dept, but most germanic
   depts also teach dutch and some or all of the scandinavian languages,
   and perhaps old high german, gothic, old icelandic... if people who
   are specialists in languages other than new high german are 'alien
   guests', the yiddishist is certainly not alone... (i might also point
   out that the dutch and the danes have a much longer history of
   conflict with the germans than the jews do... their respective
   languages are still germanic, however.)
4. once upon a time in my university's germanic dept (and probably in
   some others as well), yiddish was _not_ welcome. _that_ was a sad/bad/...
   situation, to my mind. we should _rejoice_ that yiddish has taken its
   place today in its appropriate dept in so many universities and stop
   this silliness of seeing it as some sort of p.o.w. behind enemy lines.
   es past nisht...

sorry for ranting like this but i think it's a serious issue (as you may
have guessed by now!).

Subject: Are shtrayml and sheytl diminutives?

The words "sheytl" & "shtrayml" both start with a shin, not a samekh.
Both are in Weinreich, page 389/404 and 390/403, respectively. Please
pardon any errors in my transliteration.

Subject: Are shtrayml and sheytl diminutives?

"Sheytl" must be related to German "der Scheitel", meaning both summit
and the parting of the hair.  It is not a diminutive.
