According to Wahrig dictionary, "Narr" comes from old
high German "narro", so I guess it predates Yiddish.
Origin beyond that is unclear they say.

Subject: Saturday Night Live

Have any of you caught the Linda Richman "Coffee Talk"
skits on Saturday Night Live.  Two questions.  1) Is
the Yiddish double talk, particularly "konnektekezoink"
and "verklemt?"   2) Do you think this is anti-semitic
or just good fun?

Subject: I) nar-narOnim ii) Yiddish spelling

Meylekh: : I will reply to your query about Yiddish
spelling conventions soon.

In the meantime, Bob, Ellen et al: re "hebrewoid" noun
plurals:

1) The plural of "nar" (fool) can be understood in the
context of a number of "hebrewoid" plurals in STANDARD
Yiddish:

a) nar--narOnim; shAbes--shabOsim (shabes + im DO NOT
cooccur in Hebrew) These examples form the plural
through "shift of stress + suffix im"

b) pOYer--pOYerim (by suffix "im" alone)

c) dOkter--doktOYrim "shift of stress + vowel change +
im"

I'm not sure I can account for the differences among
the three groups.

Let's now examine several nouns with Hebrew-origin
singular and plural forms in STANDARD Yiddish:

kAtsev--katsOvim 'butcher(s)', gAnef--ganOvim
'thieve(s)', yOntef--yontOYvim

I stress STANDARD Yiddish because the key to the
problem is to be found in the VERY widespread regional
difference. Thus:

kAtsev/f--katsO/Uvn [vm] (i.e. with labiodental nasal
release). Similarly, gAnef--ganO/Uvn [vm] and
yOntef--yontOY/EYvn [vm].

Similarly, the regional variants of the "hebrewoid"
nouns: very widespread "pOYer--pOYern" (with velar
nasal release "ng" after "r"], and "nar--nArn" as well.

As it happens, the "historical" German-origin plurals
of these two take "n", and the the Yiddish "im" forms
are thus simply analogical reinterpretations on the
model of "ganovim-ganovn".

I haven't looked at the data for plural variants of
"dOkter" or "shAbes" but,I would expect to find some
occurrences of both "dOktern" (cf. German
"DOktor--DoktO:ren") and "shAbesn". I would suggest the
following historical sequence: i)Yiddish "shabes" from
Hebrew singular, with indigenous Yiddish plural
"shabesn"; ii) Yiddish plural "shabOsim" on the analogy
of the above described model.

Any taker?

Subject: Opatoshu

I cannot answer the question asked, but I want to
refute the imputation that not answering it means
ignorance of Opatoshu, or at least, not having read
him.

His Polish stories are moving and represent a modernist
view of tradition.  I have had occasion to write on
Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Kotzk as reflected in modern
thinkers such as Buber, Heschel and Wiesel and
naturally included Opatoshu in my research.

So, while I am not an expert and cannot answer the
specific question raised, that silence should not be
taken as reflecting against either the importance or
interest people have in Opatushu.

Subject: Opatoshu

Rosa Lehmann asked about works by Joseph Opatoshu.  The
library of the University of California shows a few
books, including the following:

---------------
Author:        Opatoshu, Joseph, 1886-1954.
Title:         A day in Regensburg; short stories.
                 Translated from the Yiddish by Jacob
                 Sloan. [1st ed.] Philadelphia, Jewish
                 Publication Society of America, 1968.
                 Description:   xiv, 238 p. 22 cm.

Notes:         Contents:  Continuity; a memory of my
                 father.--A day in
                 Regensburg.--Ciechanow melody.--A
                 Bratzlaver Chasid. --A
                 rabbi.--Rationalists.--Simchat
                 Torah.--Meyer Balaban. --Four hundred
                 years.--Miracles.--The mute
                 Hungarian.--Pedigree.--The Chumash
                 lad.--The eternal wedding dress.--In
                 the Jewish district of Vienna. --A
                 Sabbath afternoon.--Almost there.--Ben
                 Sira's grandson.--Father, father.--In
                 a slaughterhouse.--Midnight
                 vigil.--Lampshade king.
                 ---------------

My wild guess is that the story she asked about _might_
be "Ciechanow melody"; Ciechanow is a small town not
far from Warsaw and used to have a large Jewish
community.

[The shames packed up the rest of his books just two
days ago.  Otherwise, Margaret's inspired guess could
have been tested afn ort.]
