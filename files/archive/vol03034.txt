Subject: Yoshke Pandre

     Having returned from two weeks spent in Slovakia, I offer the
following first installment of some catch-up comments.

     In his book _Jesus of Nazareth, His Life, Times, and
Teaching_, Joseph Klausner writes regarding the name "Ben
Pandera" or "Ben Pantere" (I quote from Herbert Danby's 1925
translation of Klausner's Hebrew text, omitting footnotes):
"This pseudonym is certainly very old, for we learn from Origen
that the heathen Celsus, about the year 178, heard from a Jew a
statement to the effect that Miriam was divorced from her
husband, a carpenter by trade, after it had been proved that she
was an adulteress.  Discarded by her husband and wandering about
in shame, she bore Jesus in secret, whose father was a certain
soldier, Pantheras.  And Origen himself says that James, the
father of Jesus' father, Joseph, was called by the name
"Panther."  Origen apparently wished in this way to explain why
Jesus the son of Joseph was called "Ben Pandera" or "Ben Pantere"
by the Jews; according to Origen, Jesus was so called after the
name of his grandfather.

     At all events, the name "Ben Pandera" is very early.  It
is impossible for us to assume that there really was a Roman
soldier of the name Pandera or Pantheras, who had relations
with the mother of Jesus, since the entire story of the birth
of Jesus by a Roman soldier is only a legend owing its origin
to the conviction of the Christians, from the time of Paul, that
Jesus was born without a natural father; therefore we must seek
elsewhere for the source of this curious name.  Of all the
explanations so far offered, that of Nietsch and Bleek appears
preferable--that "Pantere" is a corrupt travesty of _Parthenos_,
virgin.  The Jews constantly heard that the Christians (the
majority of whom spoke Greek from the earliest times) called
Jesus by the name "Son of the Virgin," _uios tes Parthenou_;
and so, in mockery, they called him "Ben ha-Panterea," i.e. son
of the leopard.  It was gradually forgotten that Jesus was so
called after his mother, and the name "Pantere" or "Pantori," or
"Pandera" was thought to be that of his father, and since this is
not a Jewish name, there arose the legend that the natural father
was a foreigner; and ... it was concluded that Miriam, the mother
of Jesus, committed adultery with a soldier, and, of course, with
a Roman soldier, since there were Roman legions in Judaea at the
time.

Subject: Rebbe/rebbetzin

To say rebets or whatever for the husband of a rabbi is to beg the
question. if we are going to call her by the masculine term "rabbi"
and not the fem.  "rabbasi" we have to call him  by the feminine
rebbetzin. fair is fair.

Subject: Yiddish -- The Fifteenth Slavic Language?

The last couple of weeks, the pseudonymous Philologos has run
columns in the (English) Forward, summarizing the views of Paul
Wexler, professor of linguistics at Tel Aviv University.  If I
understand him correctly, his thesis is that Yiddish originated not
in "Loter" (northeastern France/northwestern Germany), as Max
Weinreich would have it, but further east, in an area where the
predominant language was Sorbian.  As that region became Germanized
during the Middle Ages, speakers of what Wexler refers to as
Judeo-Sorbian also adopted a form of German -- or, as Prof. Neil
Jacobs put it to me, their Slavic language became "relexified" --
while retaining underlying features of their earlier language. These
views, summarized by Philologos and further abstracted here, were
given their most extensive treatment in a special issue of the
International Journal of the Sociology of Language (1991). (I have
not yet seen that issue.)

According to Philologos, Wexler is about to publish a book on the
origins of Eastern European Jewry, which he apparently regards (in
terms of their ethnic composition) as a Slavic and Turkic group that
became Judaized during the Middle Ages.

Needless to say, such views -- expressed by a highly regarded
linguist -- are very controversial.  I am surprised that none of the
professional linguists who contribute to this forum have not
commented on it.  (Hint, hint...)
