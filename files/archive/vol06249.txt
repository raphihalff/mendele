Subject: Place names

Alluding in 6.237 to the change of names from Stanislav (in Tsarist
Russia) to Stanislawow (diacritics omitted, in pre-1939 Poland) to
Ivanofrankivs'k (in post-1939 Ukraine), David Herskovic asks
rhetorically, "Ver volt zikh meshadekh geveyn mit an Ivano Frankever
aynikl?"

While I'm sure that friend Herskovic meant no offense to the memory of
the great Ukrainian writer (poet, novelist, playwright, publicist)
Ivan Franko (1856-1916), I hasten to point out that Franko was a
friend and supporter of Yiddish literature who, for example,
translated Velvl Zbarzher into Ukrainian.  In a recent book (_Poshuky,
rozdumy i spohady..._, Drohoybych:  Vidrodzhen- nia, 1994) Marten
Feller quotes Franko on one of his earliest memories of his Jewish
neighbors in a Ukrainian village:

     My mother once came back from the village and brought several
     Jewish matzos that she had gotten from the innkeeper's wife.

     "Children," my mother called to me and my brothers and sisters,
     "look at what Sura gave me for you."

     She broke up the dry wafers and divided them up among us.

     "Eat them, this is Jewish "paska."  To be sure, people say that
     they contain the blood of Christian children, but that's
     nonsense."

     This was the first impression of Jews that remained with me from
     my childhood.  At the same time, it was the first time I heard
     the fairy tale about blood.  My mother expressed her thoughts
     about that so calmly and decisively that we merely opened our
     eyes wide in amazement, without the usual horror that much older
     and more educated people evince in discussions on the subject. At
     the same time my mother gave the best proof that she didn't
     believe in the fairy tale about blood by eating together with us
     the pieces of bread that she had brought.

Subject: "Yiddish" music in a Race Film

The "one reeler" Ellen Prince saw/heard (6.245) was titled _The Black
Network_ with sub-title of _1945-1946_ but it was not a true "race
film" as it was made by the Vitaphone company (with a copyright of
'mcmxxxvi').  The star was the estimable Nina Mae McKinney who made
many such shorts with Vitaphone (a "Jewish" firm by the way).  The
particular number Ellen refers to was by a group called "The Washboard
Serenaders" -- a jazz combo with the addition of a "washboard" player
and a "kazoo" played into a glass for reverberation effects.  The song
was "Dark Eyes" [Ochi Chornia] all the way and it was introduced by
the leader saying that he was going to play "my own nationality
song...a Russian number... would you pardon my Yiddish accent..." and,
after a standard tempo kazoo-led playing of the tune, he then did a
pseudo-Yiddish take on "Dark Eyes" [schane maiden...schane oygen...
etc.] while the band played it in a semi-slow version and then
"jazzed" it up to a "hot jazz" tempo. It also was sung in English with
lots of "re-writing" of the words and some "scatting" ...but no
Russian words were tossed in.

The fact that a New York black jazz combo in the mid-1930s would toss
some "Yiddish" into a number like "Dark Eyes" is no surprise
considering the mix of Jews and blacks in Harlem in the early 20th
Century.  Central Harlem below 125th/135th street was Jewish before it
became black.  It was in Harlem (116th Street) that Sholem Aleichem
lived and died. The Hebrew Orphan Asylum was on 136-137th Street and
Amsterdam Avenue, across the street from CCNY's Lewisohn Stadium and
only a few blocks from "Sugar Hill" where the black "upper class"
lived.

Subject: Tsadik, tsadi

The discussions about ende/shlekhte tsadik by both Joachim Neugroschel
(6.242) and David Herskovic(6.244) are quite interesting, but I am
curious to know when and where the term tsadik (as it is used in the
Yiddish) became dominant over the original (Hebrew) term tsadi, which
is still used in Hebrew today.

You've probably either read the news in the New York Times or heard it
from someone: they're cloning sheep.  Thinking about the matter I
bumped into a Russian Jew last night on the street.  Depressed and
woebegone, he sang me this song which I decided to transcribe for you.
(Unfortunately, I don't know how to transcribe the melody with
e-mail.)
