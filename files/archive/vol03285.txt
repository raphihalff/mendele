Subject: Plays on words

I am a great fan of the David Letterman show and was, especially during
my University days, an avid watcher.

At the beginning of each show, Dave engages in some semi-humourous, semi
spontaneous, reparte with his co-host Paul Schaffer (who happens to be a
Jew from Thunder Bay Ontario).

During one particular show, Dave was bemoaning the difficulty he had in
obtaining some product (I don't recall what) from his local convenience
store. He told Paul how he had sent one of his staff to try to obtain
this item without success. The conversation went something like this:

Dave: So Paul, I needed some (whatever) and there was none in the office
so I sent a minion to the seven eleven to get me some.

Paul: Dave, you sent ten men to the seven eleven just to get some
(whatever)?

Dave: What are you talking about Paul? I said I sent a minion to the
seven eleven....

and Dave proceeded to tell some convenience store related joke.

There was no further mention of the word minion and I sometimes wonder if
I was the only viewer who realised that a cross-linguistic joke had been
made.

Subject: Erotica, etc.

In reply to A. Beck's query, there is a lot of material in -Yudishe
shprikhverter un redensarten- (=Yidishe ... rednsartn) "gezamelt un
derklert" fun Ignats Bernshteyn(oysgelasene un grobe shprikhverter),
1908. The German title page reads -Juedische Sprichwoerter und
Redensarten gesammelt und derklert von Ignaz Bernstein (Erotica un
Rustica) (Als Manuscript Gedruckt), 1908.   This was issued separately
from his larger opus.  It is included in the ALthaus reprint of a number
of yearsago to the best of my memory.  There is enough material in these
227 expressions to keep -Mendele- buzzing for months.  There is a lot of
verbal humor here, playing on Hebrew and Polish words, much that is gross
too.  Re recent discussion of homosexuality in Yiddish, note proverb no.
1: "A bokher mit a zokher shayt zikh," where the author's gloss begins
"Men meynt di tayve fun mishkev-zokher."  Is it true that most sexual
terms in Yiddish derive from the H-A component, esp. the sexual
euphemisms?  But were these H-A. terms not too learned for many?

Subject: Introduction

Dear Mendelniks,

after more than two months of reading Mendele, I think I owe you an
introduction, just to say "Ahem, I'm with you".

I am a fifty year old mathematician, currently (and probably for good)
working as a sysadmin for the computing center of TU (Technical
University) Berlin.  In spite of my last name I'm as gentile as they
come.

My connection with Yiddish...  Well, it's rather superficial, at least by
Mendele standards.  When I try to remember, I think I became aware of the
existence of Yiddish when I was about fifteen years old when I read a
German dime novel which had a Jewish background.  To add some color, the
author had thrown in -- well, not Yiddish phrases, but some double
negatives and some characteristic inversions, and for some reason I was
charmed.

My interest was revived some ten years later when I heard my first
Yiddish song.  It was "Yokh, mayn libe tokhter" by the Barry Sisters, of
all things.  I was a part-time amateur folk singer then and soon made
this, and some more Yiddish music part of my repertory.  Soon I became
aware that, in order to know what I was doing, I had to learn more about
the language.  So I got myself some books, most notably Birnbaum's
_Grammatik der Jiddischen Sprache_, and tried to learn what I needed for
the purpose.  I have given up folk singing since then (it was never much
to write home about), but my interest for Yiddish has remained.

So I was delighted to learn about the existence of Mendele in the
beginning of 1994 and subscribed immediately.  I have been lurking ever
since, only occasionally replying by direct email to a question when I
thought that my knowledge of modern German might be useful.

Sometime between now and Pesakh, could somebody zayt azoy gut as to post
the correct Yiddishe Fier Kashes? I'd like to introduce it at our seder
this year. A dank.

Subject: schoolyard Yiddishisms

Re the recent discussion of simolians and the like:

Did Americans begin saying "hotsy totsy" as a corruption of "hot zi
tzatzkes?"

Did we call those obnoxious beatings on the head or shoulders of our
buddies "nugies" because they were supposed to make you say "genug!"?

Subject: Rosenfield's Eliot parodies

Could anyone provide me with Isaac Rosenfeld's Yiddish parody of Eliot's
Prufrock , -and any others of Rosenfeld's ? Various memoirs (Howe,
Bellow, Kazin, Solotaroff ??) talk about them. I see (in Shechner's After
the Revolution) a reference to his (Rosenfeld's) Yiddish Fables
(translations ? the original ? both ?) in Prooftexts (May l982). I don't
think - I don't know - that the parodies are included.
