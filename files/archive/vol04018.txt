Subject: Introduction

Allow me to introduce myself.  I'm a 49 year old lawyer living on the
Upper West Side of Manhattan, where Yiddish can hardly be heard on the
street anymore.  Since I can claim only the slightest familiarity with
only a portion of the Yiddish vocabulary, I'm afraid my contribution to
this newsgroup will mostly be by way of questions--usually etymological
and historical ones.  My special interest is Jewish onomastics,
recovering the Jewish history that lies hidden in family names like lost
text in a palimpsest. I'm looking forward to learning from all of you.

Subject: nakht etc.

to mikhl herzog:

maybe this helps. days of the week and some parts of the day in german
can take a final -s to show that a habitual action occurs at this time,
e.g., mittwochs = every wednesday, nachts = every night.

i'm not 100% on the grammatical term for this phenomenon, i think
adverbial expression of time (as opposed to am Mittwoch, in der Nacht
which use nouns). In case it is of use or interest, 'auf der nacht' is
used (in the south of germany anyway) to mean evening.

My father worked nights when I was a kid, and I alway assumed that
"nights" was plural.  That is, he worked on all the nights and never
during the days.  This still matches my Sprachgefuel as a native speaker
of English.

Subject: New Polish book on Yiddish

The Yiddish linguists in our midst might be interested to learn about a
new book that has just come out in Poland:

Jidisz:  jezyk Zydow polskich [Yiddish:  the language of Polish Jews], by
Ewa Geller.  Warszawa:  Polish Scientific Publishers PWN, Ltd., 1994.
264 p.  ISBN 83-01-11267-0.  $3 (yes, $3) Publisher's address:  Polish
Scientific Publishers PWN, Sales Dept., ul. Miodowa 10, 00-251 Warszawa,
POLAND.

There's an added Yiddish title:  Yidish:  di shprakh fun poylishe yidn.
The publisher's flyer describes the book as "a synthesis of the Slavic
linguistic components in Polish Yiddish based on J. [sic] B. Singer's
work."  A glossary of Slavisms appearing in Singer's writings runs from
pp. 144-210.  It appears to be a VERY interesting book.  I believe that
the author is a professionally trained linguist who lives in Warsaw.

Does anyone know of an English translation of Tz'eena U'Reena for us
Mendelniks who aren't so fluent in Yiddish?  Thanks in advance,

Subject: stress in [yivo]

No, this posting has nothing to do with the emotional burden of the move
YIVO is about to make.  :-)

M. Schaechter has told me that [yivo'], with stress on final syllable, is
along the pattern of the acronym reysh-mem-alef, pronounced in Yiddish
[remo'].  (Coincidentally, here too the final alef is actually a shtumer
alef which preceeds the sound [i], for Reb Moyshe Iserlis.)  I contended
that [yivo'] got its stress by analogy with [nivo'], an already existing
word with an established stress.  Any (dis)agreements or other theories?

Subject: political culture and frumkeit of New York Jews

I am working on the evolution of the New York Jewish population over the
last century. All the evidence that I have gathered points to greater
orthodoxy of Brooklyn Jews and greater secularity cum socialist
orientation among the Jews of the Bronx. How would I find historical
records on the Yiddish newspapers sold in each of the boroughs/counties
of New York? E.g, if the Forvertz or even Freiehit, papers of the left,
were sold in greater proportion, per 1,000 Jewish population, then was
for example, The Morgen Journal, this would be important evidence. Do any
Mendelinks have other indicators of secularity or piety or traditionalism
in different parts of New York City among the Jewish population. I have
strong reason to believe that the the current frumkeit of Brooklyn [e.g.
Williamsburg, Borough Park, Crown Heights] builds upn an old foundation.
Comments, suggestions, contradictions would all be welcome.

Subject: List of largest Jewish Communities in 1750

I am trying to assemble a list of the (say) 150 or 200 largest Jewish
European communities around 1750. Alternatively, it would also be useful
to obtain a list of all the cities with Jewish communities with a
population exeeding 2000 or 3000.  Would you please suggest any source
that might actually have a list of these cities with their corresponding
populations around 1750?  I would appreciate if you can answer to my
e-mail address directly:  andes@husc9.harvard.edu

Thanks very much.
