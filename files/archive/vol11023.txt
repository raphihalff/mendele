Subject: The Proletpen Revisited

I must take issue with Leonard Prager's discussion of Proletpen in his
recent posting challenging the wording of my request for assistance on
the development of a volume of Proletpen poetry. The Dora Teitelboim
Center for Yiddish Culture is determined to put a considerable number
of unjustly ignored New York poets of the interwar years back on the
map of Yiddish Literature, both in the original Yiddish and in English
translation. We feel certain that the forthcoming volume will be the
first of a number that will explore the magnificent creativity of so
many Yiddish poets of America who continue to remain unknown to new
generations of Yiddish students and enthusiasts, while ever more books
and articles appear about the same few writers who now dominate the
canon.

This is not meant to be a comprehensive refutation of Dr. Prager's
diatribe. The book itself will stand on its own to put back into
Yiddish literary history what has been long excised for a variety of
reasons.  However it must be said at once that politics has always been
a driving force in Yiddish culture.  Sometimes this is expressed
through commission and other times through omission.  I am not
challenging Howe and Greenberg's editorial motivations, nor for that
matter, Ruth Wisse for hers.  However the fact is that glaringly absent
from all of their anthologies were some of the greatest poets of the
20th century, all of whom were, in one time or another, active
participants in the Proletpen including Sarah Barkan, Louis Miller,
Aaron Kurtz, Zishe Weinper, Yosl Kotler, Ber Green, Martin Birnbaum,
Yuri Suhl, Menke Katz, not to mention Dora Teitelboim . . . (to name a
few). Yiddishists will forgive me for using the popular English
spellings of some poets names, where these are established.

In fact, so striking was their absence that the great Yiddish
translator, Aaron Kramer edited and published an entire book, A Century
of Yiddish Poetry, dedicated to putting back into Yiddish literary
history, in his words, "those who were utterly ignored or dismissed in
a half-sentence."

In the early 20th century there were two major worlds of Yiddish
thought generally represented by the Forverts (Jewish Daily Forward),
and the Morgn Frayhayt (Freiheit), whose readers rarely agreed on much
until the Holocaust when left, right and center united for survival. It
is indeed rather strange to dismiss nearly all who contributed to the
Morgn Frayhayt as being "political" poets whose writings were dogmatic
and lacked art or whose nign was "straitjacketed" to the Communist
party.  Its very much like saying that the editorial board and
contributors to the Forverts were all police agents and therefore
should be dismissed as real writers because the Forward's leadership
turned over names to the government during the witch hunts of the 50s
(a documented fact).

The volume Proletpen will have as its foremost goal the revelation to
today's readers of a whole universe of poetry that has been ignored.
Much of that poetry had absolutely nothing to do with party politics!
It will also become obvious that one common denominator in the quiet
conspiracy to exclude them is the year in which they left (if they ever
left!) the Left (no pun intended). Those who joined the ranks of the
Yiddish right "in time" were forgiven and often became the first
anthologists themselves to create the one-sided canon that then became
"God's Honest Truth" for a new generation of professors. Professor
Prager is certainly right to allude to the years of departure from the
left as a relevant factor in how writers perceived others and were
themselves perceived through political prisms.

In the 21st century it is hoped that rather than reviving the
sectarianism that too often has divided Yiddish culture by "revising
history" through false notions of quality control and outdated
political litmus tests, thereby throwing out a significant part of
Yiddish cultural history, that we knock down the walls that have
divided us to work for the revival of our beloved culture and the study
of its many internal diversities.

This is why a volume (the first of a number) of Proletpen poetry is so
important.  And that's why I cannot condone categorization through
generalization and marginalization as seems to be the case here once
again. It is time to finally learn the wisdom gained from the Holocaust
and set aside our life-long political biases so that we can share
another thousand years of Yiddish culture.

Subject: komets alef "oy"?

In a discussion about the pronunciation of the word which in YIVO
transliteration is "sholem" (and in Israeli Hebrew, "shalom") I have
been assured that many Yiddish speakers (possibly especially Yiddish
speakers from Russia) pronounce it "shoylem".  Is this true in
Mendelyaners' experience?  Does it carry over to other words with a
komets?  (I find that hard to imagine -- "boyrukh atoy Hashem..."?)
Or is it an anomaly?

Puzzled,

Yankev Lewis

Subject: Seeking "farfel" etymology

Does anyone here know the derivation of the word "farfel"?

I've heard the word used to describe crumbled matzo flakes, flake-like
noodles, and noodles in general.

It is my understanding (though I'm no scholar of Yiddish)  that
"farfoylt" means "destroyed", and "farfalen" means "thwarted";  I was
wondering if this could have anything to do with the crumbling of the
matzos into little flakes.

Another possibility I was pondering has to do with the Italian word
"farfalle" ("butterflies") for another kind of noodle (i.e.-"bow ties"
or "varnishkes"). Could it be that "farfalle"  crossed over from
Italian into Yiddish as a catch-all term for any kind of noodle? Or
perhaps, only the type of short noodle one might mix with another solid
food (as in kasha varnishkes/farfalle)?

This is all speculation on my part. However, I would appreciate any
information on the true derivation.

Thanks,
Eli Langner

Subject: yiddish flash cards

Hey all,

I was wondering if any of you have explored yiddish flash cards. I'm
talking about serious words, though, not the silly stuff you tend to
see.

I particular, I'm reading these stories by Bergelson and for every word
that I don't know, I'm putting it in yiddish on one side and english on
the other. It struck me that if I happened to put them into an Access
database, then I could print them out onto flash cards later. Further,
if I did that, they'd be sharable.

So, I guess I'm wondering if any of you have ever considered the notion
of an email group creatable set of flash cards.

If it were possible to buy a serious set (like with the contents of
Weinreich's College yiddish, etc), then there might not be any need.

Grateful for any information or suggestions.

Eric Edelstein

Subject: song

I think that Motl Fisher confuses the Hebrew poet Tshernichowsky with
Adam Cherniakow of the Lodzh Ghetto. The poem (and song) in question,
(by Tshernichowsky), is:

sakhki, sakhki al hakhalomot,
zu ani hakholem sakh,
sakhki ki beadam aamin,
ki odeni maamin bakh,
sakhki ki beadam aamin,
ki odeni maamin bakh.

As I recall (imperfectly), from early memories, this is usually
rendered in English as:

Laugh at all my dreams my dearest,
Laugh and I recall anew,
That I still believe in mankind (=adam),
That I still be in you,
That I still believe in mankind,
That I still be in you.

If you were nearby, I could still sing it for you.

Subject: Vayizoso's seykhl

Vayizoso's seykhl is accurately defined (the commonly heard
explanations seem, to me at least, debatable) by Mendelistn Mett,
Beinfeld and Jacobs and it is assumed that Mendele's laudable anti-nibl
pe policy precludes mention of a widely disseminated anatomical usage
of the the name of Homon's mezinnik. There is, in addition a sheyne
vort regarding Vayizoso's seykhl to be found in Yud Ches Rawnitski's
"Yidishe Vitsn". It is short and worth quoting in its entirety.

Dalfon un Vayizoso

Di aseres bney Homon, Homon's tsen bonim, zeynen oifgehangen gevorn, vi
in a medresh vert dertseylt, derfar vos zey hobn es dem foter zeyern
gegebn di eytse, eyntsutsoln dem kenig Ahashverois tsen toiznt shtik
zilber kdey di yidn umtsubrengn, un zey aleyn take hobn es tsugeshtelt,
yeder fun zey tsu toiznt. Fregt zikh ober a shayle: fun vanen a
shteyger, hot Vayizoso, der gevisser tipesh, plutsim bakumen khokhme

Subject: Vayzose

Vayzose iz nar un oykh dos menershe glid, azoy vi pots un shmok. (Putz
and schmuck in the popular Germanizing orthography, leading to all
kinds of faux savant etymologies. What would the posthistorical world
of Yiddish be without deutsche Besserwisserei and other such
misprisions?)

Subject: Info on Daniel Kempin

In his note of November 16 Martin Jacobs writes that Daniel Kempin
(cited as a source for information about "vayzoso") is unknown to him.
Mr. Kempin is a performer and scholar of Yiddish music who lives near
Wiesbaden, Germany.  Although not well known to audiences in the US, he
does have several CDs in distribution, including an album of Gebirtig
songs recorded at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC.
