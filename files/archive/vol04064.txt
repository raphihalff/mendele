Toronto:  Second International Yiddish Club Conference Update

Erev Shabes starts with a unique Friday night Yiddish Service and kosher
dinner. Aron Fainer, V.P. of The Committee For Yiddish of The Jewish
Federation of Greater Toronto will speak on "Why A Conference of Yiddish
Clubs", followed by a Yiddish sing-a-long

Sat. A.M's Yiddish study session will be led by Prof. Eugene Orenstein,
Chairman of Yiddish Studies at McGill Univ., Montreal. There will also be
services.

Chava Rosenfarb will give The Harry V. Lerner Memorial Lecture, entitled
"J. I. Segal: His Life and Works". Chava's latest book "Tree of Life" has
been translated into English and Hebrew. She is a dynamic Yiddish
lecturer.

Saturday night's gala concert feature's The Flying Bulgars Klezmer Band.
Guest star is Claire Klien Osipov of Vancouver--interpreter of Yiddish
folksongs. Also there will be Di Yidish Shpiler, with Michael Lebovic and
Allen Farkas doing a comic skit. Finally, we'll hear the beautiful voice
of Gloria Valentine.

Sunday A.M. we begin the dozen workshops. Sunday afternoon has a bus tour
with a visit to Beth Tzedec Synagogue Museum and a Yiddish exhibit. Next
is a trip to Koffler Gallery at the JCC North with an exhibit "100 Years
of Yiddish Toronto". Then a reception hosted by the Federation.
Entertainment stars The Shpeeler Klezmer Band under the leadership of
Gurian Hyman.

Sunday evening Liba Augenfeld speaks on the poetry of Peretz Miransky.
Liba was a close friend of Miransky. He was 1 of the 2 last of the "Yung
Vilna". Sutskiver in Israel is the last living survivor. Many of
Miransky's poems were put to music. Then Beth Tikvah Choir performs in a
concert led by Saul Glick, director and composer, doing several of
Miransky's works. The evening finishes with singing by Cantor Louis
Danto.

Monday morning continues with key workshops.

Monday afternoon's activity has the wrap-up and evaluation. There will be
a meeting of the Conference Committee to start plans for the Third
International Yiddish Club Conference. For a list of workshops call Bess
Shockett, the Coordinator (416) 787-0526, or send a SASE to Fishl Kutner,

Subject: Final letters in roshe-teyves

According to my Hebrew teacher, in modern Hebrew, final letters are used
in roshe-teyves when it is pronounced like a word.  The example that
comes to mind is aleph-vav-mem-sofit, pronounced [u:m], which stands for
umot meukhadot, "United Nations".

On the other hand, mem-vav-mem (not mem-sofit) stands for masa umatan,
"negotiation", which is never pronounced [mum] as written.

BTW, what does lamed-tsadi-sofit stand for?  It's not in Alcalay.

Subject: Zawel Kwartin

To: Bernard Greenberg

My original note re: this topic was sent about a week ago, and tonight I
received one other reply from  Zackary Baker, re: Zawel writing an
autobiography.

I have only one of his records, which my father gave me a long time ago.
Can you give my any further information about him?

To: Dovid Braun

Thank you for your advising me on Zavel having written a book.  I assume
this was in Yiddish, or Hebrew, since he emigrated to Israel in his later
years.  Would you have any idea as to how I might find out where to locate
this book.

Subject: Sliakhchitz

Thanks to all who helped define der szlachcic Stavitzki ... and perhaps
give life to the old saw "drunk as a lord." (shiker vi a szlachcic?)

Iz do an andere, oykh fun zeyde's zikhroines:

"M'hot mit kuntzen oyfgebrokhen dem shlos fun Reuvn Madeksher's hoyf,
velkher hot gehondelt mit jegekhts, un m'hot aroysgekaykelt a dray-fir
laydige jegekhts tunen. Di madekshekhe hot zikh afile gepruft nit derlozn
tzu nemen di tunen ...."

Is "madekshekhe" a variant of the proper name, or does it have its own
meaning?

(apologizing for my own poorly romanized and phrased Yiddish, the product
of two 8-week night courses thus far....)

Subject: Oyber-Unterland/Shalet

To: Meyshe Alpert --

Thanks for filling in the gaps. Unfortunately for me I only know what I
put in my posting, and it's wonderful that you've filled in the gaps.
Over the years I've gleaned a lot of esoterica; when you've spanned these
interesting subjects over time, you remember only the most striking
details. My main point was to bring out that there is such an area, which
is delight- ful in itself to read about. After all, how did Western
Yiddish make it to the Carpathians? I don't know all the geographical
areas you mentioned, just that I read about it in a short article
somewhere (where, I wish I remembered).

Also, there had been some discussion on the list of "tsholent", and I
couldn't resist hypothesizing that "solent" sounds like a
sabesdiker-Mayrevdiker compromise.

I first got interested in the area because a close friend of mine's
grand- parents were from there (and very obviously Unterland -- pass the
"piter" please). They were from Munkacs/Mukacevo/Minkatshov (the latter
an early Yiddish name.
