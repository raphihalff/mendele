Subject: Re: A mushl kabak

to Bob Poe:

Kabak is a pumpkin in Ukranian and some Southern Russian dialects
(cf. _kabachok_[squash] in Russian). "A mushl kabak" was a common
expression at least in western Ukraine and Besarabia. Your
explanation is correct, it refers to something irrelevant or
unimportant.

(1) Just to clarify matters (this comment is intended for Meyshe-
Yankl Sweet, in MENDELE 3.256), I was merely passing along Philo-
logos's comments concerning various Yiddish pronunciations -- the
views expressed were not my own, but rather were intended to elicit
the sort of discussion that our pseudonymous columnist was asking
for.  And, at least regarding "manseh," it seems to have done so.
Knowing the ways of the grapevine, he will doubtless learn about
whatever answers MENDELnikes provide to his queries.  I personally
have heard the sort of nasalized pronunciation of "mayse" that Arn
Abramson describes (same issue), but cannot attest to the other
pronunciations that Philologos found in Henry Roth's new novel
(which I have not yet read):  "Takken" (for "take[h]") and "ikh
khom" (for "ikh hob") -- or the etymology of "shmulyares"
(="dollars").

(2) I believe the original question was, What is the term for "gay"
in Yiddish?  In recent years I have heard the term "freylekh" (e.g.
"freylekhe yidn") which I believe is a new coinage, modeled on the
corresponding English term.  That does not necessarily mean that the
term has become universally (or even widely) accepted, merely that
it has entered into Yiddish usage.  As for the word "feygele," my
sister has a male acquaintance who goes by the name Feygele ben
Miriam.  (Feygl is of course a very common women's name among
Yiddish-speakers.)

Subject: Lamed Shapiro, not I.L. Peretz

Zeyt mir moykhl! Several kind Mendele readers have pointed out my
error in citing I.L. Peretz as the author of "White Challah," when
it was in fact Lamed Shapiro. The management regrets the error.

Subject: Vos is a "Moishe Kopoye"?

When I was a kid, the term used for someone who was all turned
upside and around and backwards and sideways was "Moishe Kepoye"
(pronounced "keh-POY-eh").  I thought it was a Yiddish expression
for being in a state of total confsion but then someone said that
the term was named after a Yiddish actor who used that name.
Perhaps it was his real name or perhaps it was his stage name.
Furthermore, the stage Moishe Kepoye specialized in doing strange
things, but I never found out what they were.

Is there anyone out there who can fill me in on precisely what a
"Moishe Kopoye" is or was (or might be or even might have been?

Subject: A play on English/Yiddish words joke

There was a single joke that was an interesting play on words
between English and Yiddish and I don't know many that had that
characteristic.  It goes as follows:

Were you aware of what Mrs. Horowitz's name was in the old country?

No.  What was it?

Mrs. Nafkowitz!

The play is, of course, on the fact that a "nafka" and a "whore" are
the same words in Yiddish and English.  Are there many such play-on-words
jokes that cross from one language to another?  I cannot think of
any     and I don't believe I ever heard another.

Subject: "lesbiankes"

Meyshe-Yankl Sweet writes:

"And what of the truly invisible Lesbian in Yiddish?...I've heard
"Lesbiankes", but that's probably a fairly recent coinage."

My own contribution, picked up by way of, as I recall, my rebbe
Yehoshua Rothenberg, z"l, is "dos meydl iz nisht keyn meydl" (Radom
and Varshe, 1920's and 30's) which of course takes us right to the
heart of invisibility.

Anyone else?

There is, of course, a world of body-centered, zaftikn, lebedikn
Yiddish, of mark, gas, ganovim, teater (as Meyshe-Yankl points out
too) fast vanishing beyond our tattered dictionaries. This larger
question also requires our attention -- and now.  In twenty years
we'll have nothing left but the dictionaries.
