Subject: Tevye's name

In Mendele Vol. 5.023 Harvey Spiro  replies to the question of Bernard
Greenberg in Mendele 5.022 on the  origin of the name Tevye.  Harvey's
contribution led us  to the name Tovyah  which is to be  found in many
ancient sources.   He also mentioned  Tobias of  the Book of  Tobit or
Tobias of the Apocrypha.

Later Rick Turkel writes in response to Harvey that the correct Hebrew
vocalization of  that name  is Tuvia,  that had been  my view  as well
*before I  checked*.  Bob  Werman than correctly  points out  that the
Biblical form  is Tovya,  and adds  that the name  Tuvya is  common in
modern Hebrew.

I have just  a minor addition and  a question.  In the  Tanakh we find
both Toviya  as the name of  three different people and  also the name
Toviyahu  as the  name of  someone else.   Please note  that there  is
always the "O" vocalization, and  there is the added "i" vocalization.
Indeed  Tuvya (without  the  "i") is  a not  uncommon  modern name  in
Israel.   Many years  ago when  Habima had  the play  of Tevye  it was
called indeed Tuvya (with the "U") haHolev.  I wonder if someone knows
when  the name  Tuvya with  the  "U" became  a Jewish  name, de  facto
replacing the other forms.

Subject: Tzvey kashes

I was in a class recently where they were teaching German. The teacher
asked the students to translate a phrase where the critical word to be
used was supposed to be _viel_. Instead the student (who turned out to be
Yiddish speaking) said: _a sach_, which the teacher didn't understand. I
was wondering where the expression originates?

While on the subject, when I was a kid and living in England I was often
called a _lobbus_ by my family members. It clearly meant a mischievous
boy, much like the word _shovov_ in Hebrew. However, whenever I have used
the word _lobbus_ here in the United States people have looked at me
strangely and have not understood the word. Is this a Yiddish word
confined to the British Isles?

I thank you in advance for your comments.

Lagniappe or Hinter di Kolisn and Toronto's Ashkenaz Festival

Lagniappe, the personal E-Mail, on Mendele is what makes the cup runneth
over. Behind the scenes, hinter di kolisn, whole dramas are enacted. Dear
new friends are born who exchange poems (oh what discoveries!), send
endorsements or sharp criticisms of ideas you have posted, or who reach out
to get to know you better. Every letter has been enriching, rewarding, or
fun, as only Mendelniks can be.

But to top everything, through Mendele's networking comes the fourteen
page bulletin (yours for the asking from brosen@io.org) describing the
events of the Ashkenaz Festival to celebrate Yiddish and Yiddishkayt in
Toronto at the Harbourfront Center from July 4th through 9th. Most events
are free. Just reading the catalogue is a celebration of the seven lively
arts that thrive in Yiddish today. If your first love is music, drama,
literature, poetry, dance, opera, the visual arts, storytelling, or all
of them, it's all there, a Yiddish-loving dilletante's dream.

Thank you, Bruce Rosensweet, (Mendele Vol 4.386) for informing us of the
celebration, and for sending the lush details.

We'll be looking for your Mendele nametags at the festival to get to meet
you. Anyone who is interested in obtaining free nametags, just send an
SASE to our summer address (for quick service): Marj and Bob Hirshan 521
Blueberry Lane North Conway, NH 03860

Subject: Yiddish in Halifax?

I will be starting graduate school at St. Mary's University in Halifax,
Nova Scotia this fall.  Does anyone know of any Yiddish activity in that
lovely city?  I would like to be able to continue taking classes, if
there are any available there, or just to get a chance to speak Yiddish
whenever possible. I also plan to spend a lot of time in Cape Breton, so
if anyone is familiar with the yidishkayt of the Sydney-Glace Bay area,
I'd love to hear from you also.

A sheynem dank,

Subject: Oyfn Pripetshik

A friend of mine dug out a (reduced) version of the song 'Oyfn
Pripetshik', decided to use it in the chorus he sings in, gave me a copy
and appointed me (oy vey!) as the official translator. I tried my best,
but it was only through Rosalie Gerut and her music cassette 'Sleep my
child' (Tzusamen Productions/Blue Hill Recordings) that I found the
complete text and an (authorized) English translation.

Nonetheless, I still have some doubts. Let us take the first set:

Oyfn pripetshik brent a fayerl
Un in shtub iz heys
Un der rebe lernt kleyne kinderlekh
Dem alef-beyz.

It is translated like that:

On the little hearth burns a little fire
And in house it is warm
And the rabbi teaches little children
The alphabet.

As you see, 'pripetshik' is translated as 'little hearth'. May be it
corresponds to a Slavic word that has that meaning; but I do not
understand the connection with the context: to me, it seems the
definition of a location rather than the expression of a sentiment. There
is also a river called Pripet. Does any Mendelnick have a convincing
explanation of this first verse?

My second question is more general. The refrain goes like that:

Zet zhe kinderlekh, gedenkt zhe tayere,
Vos ir lernt do
Zog zhe nokh amol, un take nokh amol:
Komets-alef-o.

And here is the translation:

Remember children
What you are learning here
Recite and repeat it again
Komets alef is pronounced "o".

My problem is the 'zhe'. By the sound of it, it is not Yiddish. I know it
is right to use it with the imperative tense: but what does it mean, what
is its function, where does it come from?

Thanks in advance.
