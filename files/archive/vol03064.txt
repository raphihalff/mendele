Subject: matse-vaser/bukh or bikhl?

1.  Another idiom for Elye's collection:

"farkoyfn zikh vi matse-vaser" = "to sell like hotcakes" [U.
Weinreich].  An advertisement for the second (1993) edition of
Mordkhe Schaechter's *Yidish Tsvey* says that the first edition
(1986) "iz tsekhapt gevorn vi matse-vaser." Perhaps someone who is
familiar with matse-baking can explain the literal meaning.

2.  Bukh oder bikhl?  The first edition of *Yidish Tsvey" was
subtitled "a lernbikhl far mitndike kursn."  The subtitle of the new
edition is "a lernbukh far mitndike un vaythalters."  Somewhere
(maybe in the first edition, maybe in *Afn Shvel*?) Schaechter notes
that the ordinary word for "book" is "bikhl", not "bukh".  Sounds
curious to non-native-speaking me.  Apparently it's not a matter of
size:  The second edition [the lernbukh] has 586 pages; but the
first [the lernbikhl] has 497+--not at all a small book.)  Fregt
zikh di frage in any case, Why the change from lernbikhl to
lernbukh?  Melekh Viswanath, can you help us here?

Subject: Yiddish question

My wife wants some tapes to help her improve her familiarity so she
can talk to her parents in that language. (She feels some topics
will be easier disccussed, and that she has enough yiddish in her
that just some listening will get her to a conversational level.)

The commercial tapes cover the same ground a intro traveler tape
does, not all that useful for family discussions.

Has sources for learning been discussed on this list previously? If
not could this be forwarded to the list for "net knowledge"?

Thanks

Subject: Goyish knowledge of Yiddish

Golda Werman, my wife, has a chapter on J.Saubert, a German Lutheran
minister who translated the first part (Bereshit) of the Tze'ena
Re'ena from Yiddish to Latin in the 17th century, in her forthcoming
book on _Milton and the Midrash_ Catholic University Press.
Washington, D.C.  Saubert gives as he motivation the exposure of the
silly beliefs of the Jews, to make them more amenable to conversion.

Subject: Introduction

My name is Dagmar Lorenz.  I recently signed on to Mendele with the
help of my colleagues, David Neal Miller and Neil Jacobs who
informed me that it was proper to write a few words of introduction.
Voila:  I am a Professor of German at the Ohio State University and
a member of the Yiddish leynen kreis. I am interested in German and
Austrian Jewish literature and culture as well as in German and
Yiddish literature in contact.

In this context I have a question.

One of my colleagues is presently working on a book about Paul Celan
and would like to know about folklore pertaining to the magical
powers of miracle rabbis. I am aware of songs which talk about a
rebbe flying to heaven (in eyn minut), or another one in which it
says that the rebbe dances and his sonim are dropping dead.  Does
anyone know about other such stories or critical studies? Are there
anthologies of Yiddish folksongs which are easily accessible?

Thanks!

Dagmar Lorenz
