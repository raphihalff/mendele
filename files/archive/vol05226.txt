Subject: alsatian yiddish vs. judeo-alsatian

to dan leeson: i hope rick or others more knowledgeable than i will respond,
but let me point out one simple relevant fact. what we typically think of a
'yiddish' is more specifically *eastern* yiddish. there's also *western*
yiddish, the yiddish evolved from the yiddish of those original old-yiddish
speakers who never moved east. they remain (in tiny numbers, to be sure) in
belgium, switzerland, maybe a few other places, and in *alsace*. and the
particular variety of western yiddish spoken in alsace would be *alsatian
yiddish*, just as the particular variety of eastern yiddish spoken in poland
would be *polish yiddish*.

now, re 'judeo-alsatian', i'm not familiar with it, but the usual practice is
to call the jewish dialect of x language 'judeo-x'. for example, judeo-marathi
would be the dialect of marathi that the jews of bombay would speak.
therefore, i infer that 'judeo-alsatian' is the dialect of alsatian (which is
a germanic language/dialect totally distinct from yiddish) that (some)
alsatian jews speak, perhaps in addition to speaking alsatian yiddish.

hope this helps.

Subject: Alsatian Yiddish/Judeo-Alsatian

How about checking with Yale Professor of History Paula Hyman?  Her social
history of Alsatian Jewry between 1770s and late 19th century uses many
materials in Yiddish or a Yiddish dialect..  The other dominant historian of
Alsatian Jewry is Vicki Caron, but unfortunately I do not know where she works
now.

Subject: Alsatian Yiddish/Judeo-Alsatian

"Yiddish Manuscripts in the British Library," by Leonard Prager and Brad Sabin
Hill, contains an interesting aside -- and a very helpful bibliographical
footnote on Alsatian Yiddish vs. Judeo-Alsatian. The brief textual comment
will be followed by the footnote.

      .. MS. 12333 (Gaster no. 1223) contains a pot-pourri of materials from
      the early eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth centuries, mainly documents
      and letters from the Jewish community of Haguenau in Alsace...  This
      community takes on a certain importance in the Gaster Collection owing
      to another manuscript, Or. MS 10755 (Gaster no. 1200)... with autograph
      reports of a delegate from Haguenau to the Sanhedrin in Paris.  The
      Yiddish dialect of Alsace, sometimes referred to as Judaeo-Alsatian, has
      been the subject of considerable linguistic and even literary attention
      for over a century.  These two Gaster manuscripts must be added to the
      bibliography of documentation on this longest-surviving dialect of
      Western Yiddish.  (pp. 90-91)

      [Footnote no. 57:]
      For the literature on Alsatian Yiddish, see B. Blumenkranz and M. Levy,
      Bibliographie des Juifs en France (Toulouse, 1974), pp. 255-6 (under
      'Yiddish'); Astrid Starck, 'Bibliographie du yidich alsacien', in her Le
      Yiddisch occidental (Aarau, 1994), pp. 173-84; and the summary
      bibliography appended to Les Cahiers du CREDYO [Centre de Recherche
      d'etudes et de documentation du yidich occidental], no. 1 (Mulhouse,
      1995), pp. 101-3.  See also the dissertation by Johannes Brosi,

      Yiddish]', in Oksforder yidish [Oxford Yiddish:  Studies in Yiddish
      Language, Literature and Folklore], iii (Oxford, 1995), cols. 369-88

Subject: Meaning of skatine or rather skotina

For Steve Jacobson,

I think you'd have better luck looking for skotina, not skatine in a
Russian-English dictionary.  Skotina (naturally in the Cyrillic alphabet), a
feminine noun, is defined in my puny Russian-English dictionary as cattle,
brute, dolt, boor.  Skot is masculine and also means cattle, livestock, but no
elaboration into pejorative attributes of a person.  But that's only my
dictionary.

BTW in what Sholem Aleichem story did you find it?  I vaguely recall the
word, but I can't place it.

Subject: The meaning of "skatine"

Steve Jacobson asked for the meaning of "skatine".  I don't know the context
in Sholem Aleichem's story to which he is referring, but the word is most
probably  from the Russian word "skotina" ( pronounced  "skatinuh" ) which
means "cattle, livestock; (fig) swine, beast."  "Beheyme", I suppose. Does
that work?

Carl Goldberg

P.S. Thank you, Steve, for your dictionary of Hebraisms in Yiddish.
It is a tremendous help for an amorets like me who does not know
Hebrew.

Subject: skatine

'skatine' is found in the Oytser, but it's spelled 'skotine'. The word is
related to the more familiar 'skot' meaning cattle. Presumably the stress on
the second syllable reduces o > a. 'skatine' also means cattle, but also
(singular & plural) brute, beast, dumb ox.
