Subject: What's in a name?

Does anyone have an explanation as to why so many first names of 2nd
generation Jewish boys are also the last names of British families, such as
Morton, Morris, Murray, Irving, Herbert, Seymour, Sidney, Stanley . . .  ? 
Is there a connection?

Subject: Fogel

Ben Fogel chooses to take the prerogative of translating his name "Fogel"
as "Bird".  But surely his ancestors were smarter.  "Violet" in hebrew is
"sagol" from the root s-g-l which is also the root for "chosen".  It isn't
very far from s-g-l to f-g-l.

Subject: Feygl and Fogel.

It looks that derivation of Feyge is controversial. Boris Feldblyum
(Russian-Jewish Given Names, Avotaynu, 1998) suggests that it "may be derived
from the German Voglein", with this view apparently having been drawn from
the works of Osip A.Rabinovich ("O sobstvennykh imenakh evreyev",
St.Petersburg, 1880-1888; "O Moshkakh i Yos'kakh", St.Petersburg, 1858) and
Iser I.Kulisher ("Sbornik dlya soglasovaniya raznovidnostey imyon -
bibleyskikh, natsional'nykh, talmudicheskikh, zaimstvovannykh i drugikh,
upotre blyaemykh evreyami v Rossii", Zhitomir, 1911).  Feldblyum adds that it
may "also be kinnui from Tzipora" (p.59). In another place he lists Feyge
among "European names adopted by Jews 1492-1781" (p.27). And it turns out to
be typical of Lithuania, the Nort hwest (Vilna, Kovno, Grodno and Minsk
provinces), and the Baltic provinces (Estland, Courland and Lyfland),
pp.39-41. This book,however, is very controversial in its own right
(8.006.7).

As to Fogel, a brilliant Parisian onomastician Sasha Beider (A Dictionary of
Jewish Surnames from Russian Empire, Avotaynu, 1993) states: "Fogel
(Courland) - Vogel [German] bird; see also Fojgel. Fojgel' (Odessa) -
{Fojgel'man (Fugel'man, Fukel'man), Fojgl'} from the given name Fojgel'
("foygl" in Yiddish, meaning "bird") {Fojgelis, Fajgel'son};  This given name
is a calque of Zipporah (also see Tsiporin), as the latter is derived from
"tsipoyr" [Hebrew] bird; Variant of this given name: Fogel' ("fogl" i n
Yiddish, from the German Vogel, meaning "bird") {Fogel, Fogel', Fogel'son,
Fogelevich (Pogelevich), Fogelovich}; Hypocoristic forms: Fojga ("fojge" in
Yiddish) {Fojg}, Foglya ("fogle" in Yiddish) {Foglin}, Fajgel' ("fajgl" in
Yiddish) {Fajgel', (Fajdel' , Fagel' (Fadel'), Fajgel'son)}, Fajga ("Fajge"
in Yiddish) from Fajgel' {Fajgenzon, Fajgman, Pajgin}, Fajgush and Fajgusha
("fajgush" and "fajgushe" in Yiddish) from Fajgel' {Fajgush, Vajgushin
(Vigushin, Viguchin)}, Fejgel' ("fejgl" in Yiddish) {Fejgel',
Fejgel'man (Fejngel'man, Figel'man), Fejgel's, Fejgel'son (Fegel'son,
Figel'son, Pigel'son), Fejgelev, Fejgelevich, Fejgeliovich,Fejgulevich,
Fejgelovich, Fejgelis}, Fejglya ("fejglya" in Yiddish) from Fejgel' {Fejglin
(Figlin, Viglin)}, Fejga ("fejge" in Yiddish) {Fejga, Fejgenson, Fejgenzon,
Fejginson, Fejginzon, Fejgezon, Fejgson, Fejgin (Fejgen, Fegen, Fel'gin
(Fil'gin), Pejgin, Vejgin), Fejginov (Fejgenov), Fejges, Fejgis, Fejgus
(Fejgush, Fil'gus), Fejgman (Figman, Vejgman, Vigman), Fejgush ("fejgush" in
Yiddish) {Fejgush (Fejgus)}, Fejgasya ("fejgasye" in Yiddish) {Vigasin
(Vigsin), Vygasin}; foygl [Yiddish] clever fellow (figuratively)". The
variants like "Fogel'nest" (Vogelnest [German] bird's nest) clearly suggest
bird over violet. 

Antshuldikt mir - for so many names, but they do illustrate the point.

Subject: Fogel, bird or flower?

In Vol. 08.046 Ben Fogel Re the feygele discussion asks:"Admittedly some
Fogels changed to "Peleg".  I don't know why.  Probably somebody can explain
it to me." 

I can only guess.  Many Israelis (me included) chose to change their names to
Israeli ones.  There are several ways people do it.  Some try to have a
Hebrew name which sounds somewhat like the former one.  Others simply like
the meaning of new name while others try to translate their old name into
Hebrew, e.g Friedman (freedman) to Ben Horin etc.  Also calling oneself after
some ancestor is quite common. 

In the Peleg case another method may have been used, that of essentially
keeping the letters of the old name or most of them and forming an anagram
which gives a Hebrew word they like.  Fogel would be written in Hebrew fe vav
gimel lamed.  Dropping the vav and interchanging the order of the last two
letters gives pe lamed gimel which is Peleg.  The fe becomes a pe by Hebrew
grammar. 

Anyhow, this is my guess.

Subject: Yiddish, Present and Past

I was very struck by David Herskovic's comment on the "one vital ingredient
which is missing in modern secular yiddish: yiddishkayt, the lifeblood of
yiddish".  I've a strong positive response to this point of view, as I
believe would anyone who has read I.B. Singer's old-country stories in the
original Yiddish (or better still has heard him *read* stories such as "Groys
un kleyn"!).  The Yiddish is so rich and infused with metaphors and similes
that relate to Yiddishkeyt - religious and secular.  I haven't read any of
his new-world stories in the original, but I wouldn't be surprised if the
same could be said of them. Of course the great "golden age" writers exhibit
the same characteristics, but as a modern writer Singer continues to
demonstrate the deep importance of Yiddishkeyt that makes Yiddish such a
vital wonderful language.  One of the things that my youngest daughter,
Reena, is doing to help her learn Yiddish is to study the parshat ha'shavuah
in Yiddish each week. This has helped make more accessible to her allusions
and biblical references.  b'shalom,

Re David Herskovic Aug 30 obversation: he is SO right. 

Yiddish today is great, but without the heimishe background of jewish life in
America up to and including the '30s, it has an entirely different tam. We
struggled, our parents did marvelous things to keep traditions, without the
budget to do so.  We all pitched in and helped. I remember coming home from
school on a Friday, and while mama made the gefilte fish and an individual
small challeh for each kid, I would get down on my knees and scrub the
floors, then cover them with pages from the "Forverts." Thank G-d for having
allowed us to perpetuate yiddish, but it sure "ain't the same".

Subject: Nokhamol gezindikt

Oops!  I apologize to all Mendelistn for the free-standing post regarding
Lingomail.  I'd meant it for inclusion in Mendele but for arcane reasons that
will interest no one it came to you in the form you saw. 

While I'm up, I may as well say first that I have no financial interest in
Dvir (or in any other company whatsoever). And, second, that it was meant as
a suggestion for use in _private_ correspondence, not as a way of
communicating with Mendele.  der meshiekh iz nokh nisht ongekumen. (veyst ir

Noyekh Miller writes: "This is a Multilingual RichText mail produced by
LingoMAIL..."
  
As admirable as the goal of sending email in yiddish characters might be,
mailing lists, including Mendele, are meant to be platform indpendent.  Some
subscribers use PCs; others use Unix workstations, Macs, VMS terminals, and
who-knows-what to read their email from the list.  For that reason, it is an
Internet convention that contributions to mailing lists are in portable ascii
characters, or at least in platform-independent Internet mail formats, like
PDF (Acrobat) or Postscript that can be read on all machines. 

However useful PC proprietary formats like LingoMAIL might be for private
email, those formats are out of place on an Internet mailing list that
reaches subscribers with all sorts of machine architectures.
