Subject: aramaic source

For "our fathers" in Aramaic, go no further than the beginning of the seder
shel pesah.Early in the text is "Ha lakhma anya d'akhlu avhatanna b'ara
d'mitsrayim." I am citing from memory so I might be off a bit but there it is,
I think.

Subject: Yiddish in the news 

     Ruth R. Wisse, Yiddish: Past, Present, Imperfect. 
     Commentary, Nov 1997, v 104, n 5, p 32-39.

Commentary published Ruth Wisse's exercise in the fine art of building
bridges, this time from the generation of her teachers to that of her
students, personified respectively by Khone Shmeruk and Aaron Lansky. Such
bridges, a _dor tsu dor_ continuity in Yiddish tradition is a subject that
definitely deserves intent attention. It is continuity, that as Ruth Wisse
pointedly notes "American Jews so badly need".

Describing the life and career of Khone Shmeruk Ruth Wisse masterly avoids
panegyrical notes. The author and her subject must have been close allies on a
number of ideological and linguistic issues, yet they apparently disagreed on
some others: another illustration of the complexity of the Yiddish scholarly
landscape. This does not prevent Ruth Wisse from using a very respectful tone.
The same is true for the description of Aaron Lansky and his Book Center - not
everything there pleases the writer, however her conclusions are very upbeat
and optimistic. 

Things change when the author attempts to define who does and who does not
have the rights to identify themselves with Yiddish.  Whenever the party line
prevails upon common sense, it is very difficult to avoid serious internal
contradictions. Hence, Ruth Wisse disassociates Yiddish from the "lost causes"
of secular Yiddishkayt, arguing that "Yiddish could have come into being
_only_ as the language of a religious civilization". And on the very next page
we read that the Yiddish-speaking subsets of the modern Jewish religious
civilization "have no interest in the secular Yiddish tradition ... or in the
books generated by that tradition". Of course, the author knows, perhaps much
better that many others, that regardless of its sources and origins, the
Yiddish of its peak period is inseparable from the great social movements and
great societal changes within and outside of the Jewish communities in Europe
and America. As it happened, by the second half of the 19th century the
Ashkenazic civilization and the world at large engaged in a very complex
two-way relationship, that played a critical role in shaping the identities of
both partners. The great Yiddish culture as we know it, the Yiddish culture
that became a field of Ruth Wisse's own scholarly excellence is undoubtedly a
product of this relationship.

Amid the usual author's dislike for the "nostalgists", leftists, feminists,
and other illegitimate appropriators of Yiddishkayt and Yiddish culture, a
careful reader might sense somewhat changed overtones of the discourse,
compared to some other polemic articles. The specter of "language separatism" 
has faded away from the picture of Yiddish revival, and the revival itself
seems to be less malignant (cf. "the imagined Yiddish revival only seems so
benign because it ignores both the requirements and the consequences of
linguistic separatism" - Ruth Wisse, The New Republic, May 27, 1996). One and
a half years ago as a condition of Yiddish revival "sentiment would have to
yield to programs of formal and serious study, and serious study of any
culture usually challenges the rosy images on which much of the sentiment is
based" (ibid.)  The need "to harness some of the sentiment" is reiterated
again, but now Ruth Wisse hesitantly admits that the path to the preservation
of Yiddish legacy "may even begin with a visit to the Jewish cemetery on
Okapowa [this spelling is used twice in the article, should be Okopowa --i.v.]
Street in Warsaw" - the sentiment is given at least some place in the process. 
Hopefully, these subtle changes reflect the evolution in the writer's views
rather than merely different approaches to the audiences of The New Republic
and Commentary. 

Ironically as it may sound, I find at least one healthy aspect in the "Whose
Yiddish?" arguments. If there is a fight for a share of or an exclusive right
to something, then there must be something to share. Of course, fights over
dead bodies are not unheard of, but it is not the case with Yiddish, not yet
for sure. In the last paragraph of her article Ruth Wisse approvingly quotes
Aaron Lansky's answer to his own query, "How do we revive Jewish literature?"
- "Only by reviving Jewish life." The recipe is very good, although not new: 
almost 90 years ago I.L.Peretz wrote in one of his program articles, "To have
Jewish art, you need Jewish artists". And then he continued, "No single place,
no minute in time, no class in our nation has an exclusive right to Yiddish. 
Every thing, everywhere belongs to it." Too bad that the latter part seems to
be often forgotten.

Subject: Der spinozist 

Dr. Adamczyk-Garbowska's memory serves her well. "Der spinozist:  Dertseylung"
[The Spinozan: A Story] was first published in the Tsukunft, 49, No. 7 (July
1944), 419-26, and signed Yitskhok Bashevis. See my Bibliography at B366. 

Singer, writing as Yitskhok Varshavski, returns to Spinoza in two essays
published on consecutive Wednesdays, viz. "Di filozofye fun Borekh Spinoza" 
[Spinoza's Philosophy], Forverts, 26 April 1947, pp. 2, 9; and "Spinozas lere
vegn mentshlekher moral" [Spinoza's Ethical Teachings], Forverts, 3 May 1947,
pp. 2, 8; B677, B679, resp.

Subject: A vaybele a tsnie

In reply to Marvin Engel's request for Isidor Lillian's lyrics to A VAYBELE A
TSNIE, here they are, transliterated from the sheet music. The music, by the
way, was composed by Joseph Rumshinsky: 

S'iz git mit dir tsu reydn,
S'iz git af dir tsu kikn,
Vi ken zi mikh derfreyen?
Vi ken zi mikh derkvikn?
Makht zi tsu mir a khey'dl,
Nemt mikh baym hartsn presn,
Ikh krig an apetit azsh -
Ikh volt zi oyfgegesn.
Vus vil a yeyder mansbil?
Vus iz zayn bager?
Vus iz zayn tsil in leybn?
Vus zukht er, vus er vil?

A vaybele a tsnie, a kushere metsie,
Git iz dem nar vus hot du gefinen
A klige un a sheyne, a tsikhtige, a reyne,
Ver s'farmogt es, dem hot Got in zinen,
Shtil, basheyden, vi a tayvl, a neshume a getraye,
Mit aza min tayer vaybl ken a man zikh zayn mekhaye.
Iz vi an oytser, vi a tsiring in hoyz,
Ir shmeykhl, ir mine,
Iz vi zi shteyt dort ruet di shekhine bloyz

Subject: Wolf on Manaster Ramer on Weinreich

This is getting a bit out of hand, but I did point out that Max Weinreich,
while citing the spurious Aramaic etymology, in fact rejected it.  And
although I should perhaps be flattered by Meyer's comparison of him and me,
the difference is very simple:  I did not publish a major (or even a minor)
work of scholarship citing a non-existent form without pointing out that it
was non- existent, while he did.  Of course, since the problem was caught by
Bob Hoberman before I had a chance to publish anything, now we will never know
whether I would have checked.  I wonder myself. 

In any case, the situation is a bit more complex. Since I am ill, I only could
check books I have at home and I actually did check in Gesenius, not to see if
teh form is genuine (which I took for granted) but to see which nikud was used
for the first vowel (that's because if the vowel was other than hataf-patakh,
then Yiddish would not have the vowel it has and so I would have had another
argument against Warshawsky's etymology!).  Not finding the form there, I
assumed that that was just because it was not attested in Biblical Aramaic but
based on other forms I took it that the vowel was a khataf-patakh, so I left
it there. 

And of course the reason I had no suspicions about the validity of the form
(as noted I know very little Aramaic) is precisely that I assumed that
Weinreich would never have allowed such a slip.  But anyway I really do not
think that Weinreich needs to be defended on such points.  His reputation is
solid anyway, for many well-known reasons.  To be sure, I do continually call
for people in this field to pay more attention to Beranek, Birnbaum, Bin-Nun,
Sapir, Prilutski, and other non-Weinreichs, that does not mean I do not pay
attention to Weinreich.  And anyway his exaggerated reputation among some
Yiddishists is not his fault, so no criticism of him is implied on that score.

Subject: Shmuesn yapanish-english-yidish

Zachary Baker describes (in Mendele 7.101) a Japanese-English phrasebook
published in 1996 by Prof Kazuo Ueda mit der hilf fun Troim Katz Handler, with
an accompanying cassette.  The person whose voice is heard on the cassette
that Zachary described as a "native speaker" is Troim Katz Handler. 

Prof Ueda and Troim are starting work on a second book for another Japanese
publisher, which will be part of a "Foreign Language Series", a Japanese-
Yiddish introduction to Yiddish. Troim says she can't give the name of the new
publisher because she doesn't read Japanese.
