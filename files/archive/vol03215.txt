Subject: Schindler's List

	I've been waiting, but no one on this list has decided to
address the movie and how it relates to Yiddish. So I think   I'll
start the ball rolling.

	First off, I thought that the movie was very good on the
whole, with a few items that I might change were it my movie.

	The things I'd like to discuss here are the Yiddish ones.
First of all, why did the polish Jews speak Sephardic Hebrew? In
fact, why were they speaking hebrew at all.  As far as I know,
Yiddish was the language of choice among religious and traditional
Jews, and Polish was spoken by many who were assimilated.

	Second, of all the Yiddish songs that could have been used
why did Spielberg use Oifn Pripetchik? He could have used a number
of Yiddish songs that were more appropriate, and dealt with the
holocaust.  I suppose that we are expected to be gratefull that any
Yiddish was used at all.

	Third, why  "Jerusalem of gold?" The Partisan Hymn, in
Yiddish, which is a true song of hope with no political over/or
under - tones, would have fit a lot better.  With apologies to all
those of you who are ardent Zionists, I really think that Israel has
nothing to do with the movie except that Schindler was declared a
righteous person by people living there.

	As I said before, there are other comments about the movie
that I could make, and as a whole I wanted to confine myself to the
topic at hand -- Yiddish.  But I would be happy to discuss the whole
movie (which I very much approve of) with anyone over the private
E-waves.

Subject: Ladino--& Kol Israel schedules

About a week ago, Marnen Laibow-Koser said, "I've never heard Ladino
called Judeo-Espagnol..." I have--every day on Israel Radio. Their
Ladino program on shortwave is on from 17:45-18:00 UTC (=GMT);
that's 12:45-1:00 EST. Frequencies are 11587 for western Europe &
the east coast of North America, 11675 for eastern Europe & the west
coast of North America. The Ladino broadcast follows an "Easy
Hebrew" broadcast from 12:25-12:45 p.m EST on the same frequencies.

Yiddish broadcasts are all aimed at Eastern Europe, but can be heard
in the U.S. There are two each day:

17:00-17:25 UTC (12:00-12:25 p.m. EST) on 11675, 11603, 11587, 9435,
7465. 18:00-18:30 UTC (1:00-1:30 p.m. EST) on 11603 and 9435.

For the east coast of North America, 11675 is probably not useful,
and 7465 may be too low to be heard at that time of day over that
distance. The other frequencies--11603, 11587, and 9435, are
sometimes pretty good.

This schedule is good for about another month--until March 6. I have
the rest of the schedule, and will be glad to post times and
frequencies for English, French, and the Hebrew home service if
anyone is interested.

Subject: European Jewry

I think Ellen Prince has successfully filled in many parts of the
picture of the racial composition of European Jewry, but she
certainly underestimates the role of rape.  The ongoing horrors in
Bosnia should have made it clear that a woman doesn't have to be a
slave or concubine in order to be raped. And, in Yiddish territory,
West and East, pogroms were certainly not a rarity through the
centuries of Jewish settlement.

In my own family, from southern Ukraine, there are quite evident
Tatar features.  My grandmother, who was admired for her rather
Oriental beauty, always seemed to be slightly embarrassed by it,
because she assumed it had entered the family gene pool through
rape.  There is no reason to minimize this historical means of
introducing European genes into the Yiddish gene pool as well.

From: RABINRL@SNYBUFVA.CS.SNYBUF.EDU
Subject: European Jewry

Ellen Prince, in responding to a question about the composition of
European Jewry, ends "...perhaps someday genetic studies will give
us some answers..."

Turns out they have.  In the November issue of Natural History
magazine, the article "Who Are The Jews" (which I cannot locate to
cite properly) deals with the basic questions and issues: why do
European Jews look like the gentiles they live(d) with; are European
Jews thoroughtly intermarried/gene-mixed; did the Khazars make their
Turkish presence felt in the gene pool; etc.

The answer is, in brief, the Jews of Europe are distinct from the
gentiles with whom they lived.  Some genetic based traits are
subject to environmental pressure/selection and these manifest as
changes in hair color, skin color and characteristics, etc.  But
there are genetic "markers," if you will, that are not subject to
selection pressures and they are secure:  for these markers European
Jews genetically resemble Semites generally and do not resemble the
gentile populations with whom they lived.

BTW, in the midst of her response, Ellen Prince is obviously
incredulous that maids should have an impact on their masters'
language.  But given the right mix of circumstances, that's just the
situation that happened in the southern slave-owning United States:
slave children and slave owners' children were raised together by
slaves; slave owners, vastly outnumbered by slaves, spent lots of
time in their company and communicating with them. Some linguists
are busy now tracing features of slave English (a presumed
pidginization product) to some unique characteristics of southern US
English.  So, nu?
