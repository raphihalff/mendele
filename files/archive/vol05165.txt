Subject: Standards and written Yiddish

Khayim Bochner's defense (V 5.160) of "standard Yiddish" was very
welcome; however, he may have overlooked one aspect of the objections to
it. In none of the attacks have I found _any_ references to the printed
word: neither in newspapers nor in the vast reaches of Yiddish
literature.

It seems to me that those who object to standards in Yiddish conceive of
the language basically if not entirely as a _spoken_ language, devoid of
the written word. They object to the absence of "their" dialects when
Yiddish is rendered in Latin characters.

It is as if (switching shoes and feet) some New Yorkers were to object to
the Hebrew-character rendering of English words ending in yud-nun-giml
because _they_ don't pronounce the final consonant. Of course, that
wouldn't apply to New Yorkers who were well educated in English. Which is
precisely the point. ; > )

Subject: The Russian Forward

The editor of the Russian Forward, Vladimir Yedidovich (via my co- worker
Nikolai Borodulin), has asked me to convey the following information:

The Russian Forward will begin to come out during the second half of
November.  It will pay particular attention to developments in the
Yiddish world, and (with the permission of the Shames) would like to
share with his readers some of the postings that appear in Mendele.

If you are interested in the Russian Forward you may write to Mr.
Yedidovich (who speaks and reads Yiddish) at the following address:

Russian Forward, 45 E. 33rd St., New York, NY 10016.
Tel. (212) 889-8200, ext. 451 or 452; fax (212) 684-3949.

Subject: Yidish in dem _Times_

Tayere leyeners!

S'iz haynt dershinen nokh an artikl vegn Yidish in dem zuntikn _New York
Times_!  S'iz an artikl vegn der konferents, "Di Froyen: Women and
Yiddish." Ikh leyg es bay:

        Yiddish: The Seminar

        Mama-loshen [sic] lebt! Yiddish lives!

        Yiddish is a language whose death has been forecast for a half
        century, a victim of Nazi extermination and linguistic
        assimilation.  But, like the rising inflections that often serve
        as coda to its sentences, Yiddish refuses to die.

        Witness last weekend's "Di Froyen: Women and Yiddish," a seminar
        sponsored by the National Council of Jewish Women New York
        Section.  More than 400 people came to Hunter College on
        Saturday, and the Jewish Theological Seminary on Sunday, for
        panels, readings and performances. Borough President Ruth W.
        Messinger even proclaimed it "Women and Yiddish Weekend."

        Eve Jochnowitz lectured on "Yiddish Vegetarian Cookbooks as
        Women's Literature."  Shulamis Berger spoke on "The Making of the
        American Baleboosteh[sic]/Housewife." Mina Bern, a diva of the
        Yiddish stage, reminisced.

        In the lobby, people drank coffee and shmoozed.  A recording, "A
        Legacy of Lullabies," sold briskly.  "Found Treasures: Stories by
        Yiddish Women Writers" was a best seller.  And a note on a
        bulletin board sought Yiddish-speaking basketball players.

        To one participant, Paula Teitelbaum, 41, Yiddish is a way of
        life.  The singer and Yiddish teacher has a Yiddish-speaking
        household.  But there are exceptions, as when her daughters play.
        "Barbies," observed Ms. Teitelbaum, "don't speak Yiddish.

Subject: Poem about Yiddish

The poem about which Anno Siegel inquired (5.161) is Morris
Rosenfeld's "Yiddish," which begins:

	Ir fregt, oyb yidish iz a shprakh,
	gramatish un negidish --
	ikh ken aykh zogn nor eyn zakh:
	dem yidns shprakh iz yidish.

Since the poem is longish (40 lines), I've sent a photocopy
directly to Anno rather than posting it on Mendele.

Subject: Yiddish language schools

I'm looking for summer Yiddish language schools/courses, preferably
outside the U.S.  Given the revival in things Jewish in Poland, perhaps
there is something offered at the universities in Lodz, Cracow or Warsaw.
And certainly there must be something in Israel.  Any information I can
get, will be most helpful.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: November 6

On November 3 (5.162) your shames wrote:

   Mendele will be mostly silent for the next ten days or so.

A number of Mendele's readers were understandably upset when on November
6, the day that Yitzhak Rabin was buried, an issue of Mendele arrived as
though it were business-as-usual for Yiddishists.  Not so.

Eliyahu Juni had written a lengthy post.  At the shames's request the
single post was reformatted as three posts.  Since the shames planned to
be away, 5.163 and 5.164 were programmed in advance to appear on the
following Monday and Thursday.  Hence the "_mostly_ silent".  Eliyahu is
blameless in the matter; the shames apologizes for the contretemps.
