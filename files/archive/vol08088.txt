Subject: viability of Yiddish

One more opinion regarding the viability of Yiddish.  Prost un poshet, for
Yiddish to continue to survive as a language outside the hasidic
communities, there must be sufficient numbers of such less religious
Yiddish
speakers. That means Jews must marry Jews (&/or Yiddish
liebhobers?), have
more than 1 or 2 kids (in spite of politically correct qualms about
overpopulation and feminist strivings for careers at the expense of
becoming
mothers), consistently use Yiddish as the home language, and give their
kids
a compelling reason to continue doing so in their adulthood. This is what
our religious are doing.  Dear Mendelianers who love Yiddish, how many
of
you have contributed thusly to the survival of Yiddish and Yiddish culture
with your life choices, your daily actions and your childrearing? 

Personally, I think it is impossible to separate Yiddish from Yiddishkayt. I
have 5 children and our home language is Mameloshen although
certainly not up
to the lofty standards of a Harvard profesorke. I am managing to give my
children songs, stories and hopefully literacy in Yiddish in the Yiddishly
desert of Milwaukee. But I do not think they will want to cleave to Yiddish
as
adults unless they also have strong Jewish beliefs and knowledge, that
is, are
raised frum, truly & deeply feeling that this is what Hashem wants us to
do.

Sincerely, 

Rukhl Eissenstat

P.S.Lest anyone out there complain that I am advocating removing our
women
from the equality of the workplace to the self-sacrifice of stay-at-home
motherhood, I am also a full-time physician. Feminists have sold too
many
women the false concept that they are sacrificing their "self
actualization",
careers, etc. if they become mothers, let alone of a larger family.

Subject: Death and Yiddish

It used to be Death and Taxes that were inextricably linked.  Now it is
Death and Yiddish.  However, when I was studying the art of painting in
the
late '70's with Norman Raeben (Numa), Sholom Aleichem's son, it was
said
that "painting is dead."  More recently in Buenos Aires, on a Tango
dance
journey, I met with Abraham Lichtenbaum of IWO and he stated the
common bond
between Tango aficionados and Yiddishists - their struggle for survival. 
(There is a mentality in the Tango community that proclaims that Tango
is
dead.) 

When did Yiddish, Painting and Tango die?

Certainly all the adherents to the "death" point of view can back up what
they say with strong arguments that would be hard to refute.  Yet there
are
Yiddishist's, painters and Tango dancers who go about their business,
living
a life that includes the spirit of the activity and feel that they are more
alive because of what is in the language of Yiddish, the material of paint
and the music of Tango.  Some of us are called to all three.

Subject: Language wars

As someone who is only a student of Yiddish for scholarly purposes and
out
of a sense of duty to the past, I can make no sociological observations
about the "death" of Yiddish, but would like to describe a phenomenon
taking
place in my household and university that has no statistical significance.
My husband, a classicist and Jewish Studies scholar thinks it is pointless
to learn to speak Yiddish, and argues that learning to read it is enough. 
He wants us to speak Hebrew, not Yiddish. (I don't agree). So we have
household conversations in a mixture of both. I am currently teaching a
tiny
group of students Yiddish, using Sheva Zucker's textbook.  The
university
does not fund this course. Two out of the three students are not Jewish.
A
course on Yiddish literature in translation attracts more than 20 students,
a third of whom are not Jewish.  Upon my request, the university library
acquired its first holdings in Yiddish.  There are still a great many gaps
in the collection, but it is a beginning. 

By the way, the short paragraphs in Yiddish followed by translation are a
great help.

Subject: Academic and Hassidic Yiddish 

I have been following with some sadness the pro and con arguments
about
whether Yiddish is dead or alive, and was inspired by Hershl Goodman's
and
Iosif Vaisman's postings (08.085) to add an observation to the thread. 

I recently took a walk with my granddaughter in the Brooklyn Botanical
garden, where live Yiddish can be frequently heard, and overheard the
instructions in Yiddish given by some young kindergarten-teachers to
their
Hassidic pupils.  I was heartened to hear the kids speaking Yiddish, but
was
appalled by the terrible grammar and syntax (and anglicisms) used by
the
teachers, which no doubt will propagate to the next generations. 
 
Maybe those of us who have connections to the Hassidic communities
should
attempt to propagate some "Laytish Mameloshn" to these teachers.
Instead of
engaging in useless polemics, it might be worthwhile to bridge the gap
between those who want to preserve "Yiddish culture" and those who
are
actually preserving the language as a living and developing organism!

Subject: Loshn-hore

In reference to the current mind-blowingly repetitious and loshn-horedik
discussion (8.085, 8.084, and leoylem vead nauseum):

I think it's obvious that one can

(a) recognize that there exists a Yiddish-speaking community among the
charedim; 

(b) admit that Yiddish as a natural (i.e. unselfconsciously transmitted)
spoken language among secular Jews has no future given current
trends; 

(c) show all due respect to Ruth Wisse as a scholar with an admirable
intellect and far-reaching influence; and yet 

(d) take issue with her sociolinguistic assessment and believe that
practical arrangements on the ground -- arranged communities of
secular
Yiddish speakers -- can go some way towards counteracting point (b), at
least in very limited ways.  

This is my opinion.  However, any and all of these points can be
supported
or countered without making snide little comments at the expense of
others.
Loshn-hore's a nasty habit, especially on a list with a couple of
thousand subscribers -- even if it's a long-accepted custom of academia.

Subject: death of yiddish

I have been trying to stay out of this discussion which already has so
many
eager and clairvoyant volunteers. But I am finally provoked by Joshua
Kleinman's remarks in Mendele 08.085. He concludes: "The conditions
allowing
Yiddish to flourish were not admirable and I pray that they may never
occur
again." This, in an argument that Yiddish should and/or will go quietly
and
deservedly into oblivion and that those who try to learn the language
today
are "ludicrous". 

Admirable conditions? How about Spanish (Inquisition, conquistadors),
Japanese (rape of Nanking), English (native Americans, all the sins of
the
British empire), German (fill in your own blank)- Latin, Russian, French,
etc. Dare I mention the corkscrew history of Hebrew?  What should we
say of
those misbegotten miscreants with the chutzpah to decipher Egyptian
hieroglyphics and Mayan texts? We will be bereft of all language by such
phantasmic yardsticks as "admirable conditions." 

Whether Yiddish lives or dies will not, in the end, be determined by the
subscribers to Mendele or any other participants in this debate. The
death
of Yiddish or of any language, in my view, would be a net loss to
humanity.
The zest of some of the volunteer corps of grave diggers is to be
deplored
and, for anyone who doesn't burn books for fun and profit, to be resisted
mightily. (I anticipate protests that I misstate the case. N.B.: the subject
of the last sentence preceding this parenthetical remark is the word
"zest.")

Subject: dead language?

I am not a scholar of Yiddish. I am, however, a very proud Jew. The
Yiddish
language of my parents and grandparents is alive and well. It is taught to
senior citizens who wish to re-aquaint themselves with their heritage. 
Hebrew was the language of the Torah Scholars. It became the
language of
Israel in 1948. Yiddish was the language used for several hundreds of
years
before that date. Those who have declared the Yiddish language dead
are
robbing the generations yet to come of a vast heritage of writings,
literature, poetry fo the Jewish people. To destroy Yiddish, by declaring
it
a dead language, seems to me to be aiding and abetting the antisemites
of
the world. Jews do not speak Hebrew in the rest of the diaspora. They
speak
the language of the land in which they live. Yet at home or amongst their
friends and relatives, what do they speak, Hebrew? I think not. I was in
an
elevator with my wife in the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, goin down to
dinner.  Several couples were in it with us speaking in various
languages,
Spanish, German, etc. At one floor a little old lady entered. She asked,
"Vifil iz der zaiger?" Everyone looked at his/her watch and said, "Halb
noch
acht!" 

Dead? The hell it is!

Subject: Yiddish in the Jewish Day School of Washington

It may be of some interest to our Mendlyaners, that our Charles E. Smith
Jewish Day School of Washington, DC, largest one in the country, has,
with a
grant from Yiddish of Greater Washington, instituted a _Yiddish_ course
for
its upper grades, and feels that that there may be an oversubscription of
this course next year!!  The course consists of two parts: elementary
Yiddish, and Music & Culture...

This came about when the school found out that when they took their
kids on
a tour of Eastern European cities, and found Jews there, ... hobn zey
geredt
epes a modne shprakh!!! and they couldn't understand why they could
not
speak English ... 

Nu, efsher Yiddish?? Avade ...

Yasher Koyakh to the administration of C.E. Smith Jewish Day School.
The
kids walk through the halls speaking to each other as follows: "Vu voynst
du? Ikh voyn in Rockville..." 

Ruth Wisse notwithstanding...

Subject: The Groves of Yiddish Academe

Despite clear evidence to the contrary some prestigious academics in
the
study of Yiddish insist on declaring Yiddish dead .  I suspect it is simply
the academic fashion these days, probably temporarily. 

Now retired, I come from many years in the academic world.
Generalizations
are usually not reliable, and fashions may have changed, therefore, the
inferences I draw (below) may derive from out-of-date experience.  But I
suspect 'tis now as 'twas.  Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose.
En
Anglais: "the more things change, the more they are the same." 

Why should that sheepish academic pursuit of fashion become the rule?
After
all, research requires a strong individualistic approach, otherwise
creativity dies.  But the sheep follow the fashion (sometimes like
lemmings
off a cliff).  The motive for the obedient sheep is always money, the
means
of survival.  In scientific laboratory research, it is essential to obtain
grant money from private and public granting agencies.  Committees
(generally consisting of mutual back-scratchers) determine allocations.
One
MUST pay attention to what is fashionable.  In the humanities,
departmental
and sub-departmental funding are decided or decisively influence by
all-powerful head professor(s).  Stepping out of line is risky.  As a
result, the academic cultural milieu degenerates, more often than not,
into
a something rather brutal.  The pretext for the brutality is always
something like: "Must get rid of the deadwood.  Resources are limited."
In
fact, sometimes that is justified, but often it is not.  Often it is a
matter of punishing a colleague for not toeing a line drawn by a
self-aggrandizing person in a position of shaky power.

Yiddish research is mostly a step-child in the academic world.  Yiddish
research rarely (maybe never) knows a stable home in academe.
Faculty must
always look over their shoulder to see who is chasing.  My heart aches
for
those who must toe an anti-creative line under unstable conditions.  I am
not kidding.

Those who manage to come up with good work are heroes.  Still, other
important projects remain neglected until fashions change.  If not now,
when?
