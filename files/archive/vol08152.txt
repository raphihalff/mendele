Subject: Rothschild letters

Harold L Orbach asked (Vol. 08.150) in which language the Rothschilds wrote
their letters. In 1988-89, the Rothschild Archives looked for someone to
translate those parts of the Rothschild correspondence which were written in
Hebrew characters. Applicants for the position were sent copies of one
letter from each of the Rothschild brothers and their mother.  Since I was
among the applicants, I had a chance to read these letters.  They were all
in German. Of course the sample wasn't very large and I am neither a
Germanist nor a native speaker of German, but I could not detect any
specific characteristics of Western Yiddish in these texts. That was a
disappointment, but it was a pleasure to see the handwriting: the mother's
letter had been carefully printed, but her sons wrote in very distinctive
Ashkenazic hands.

Subject: Yiddish communities

Sholem aleykhem ale,

I am currently devising a proposal for a Watson Fellowship that would take
place after May 2000 (beginning anywhere from June to September 2000).  I
want to do field work in Yiddish-speaking communities and with smaller, more
individualized pockets of native Yiddish-speakers, gathering oral folk
culture.  The fellowship would last for a year, and would require that I
remain outside the United States for the duration.  In addition, there can
be no connection to any other institution -- no universities, language
institutes, etc.  Since many fellow Mendeleyaner might live in such
communities, I wanted to put the question to all of you: what locales should
I specify for study?  I want to get a feel for communities in Europe,
Israel, Canada, South Africa, and South America; what are the exact cities
(or regions, or neighborhoods) that I should name in my proposal, and where
can I find reliable statistics on Yiddish culture in all of them?  Any and
all information would be much appreciated. 

A groysn dank,

Dan Gilman

Subject: Khsidishe mayses

Yankev Lewis hot an interes in khsidishe mayses.  The Bobover Yeshiva
(Brooklyn) publishes a luakh (religious calendar) every year.  Every week is
on a separate page, and on the back of each page is a mayse--in Yiddish, of
course--related to the Bobover dynasty.

Subject: Old/Middle Yiddish in Transliteration

I think there are three entirely distinct issues.  One is of convenience. 
There are people who find Yiddish, esp. Old/Middle Yiddish, easy to follow
in transliteration but not in the original, and many of these people will
find a German-based transliteration particularly appealing.  The second is
one of academic/editorial politics.  Some scholars may be expected to use a
transliteration and esp. a German-based one esp. if they publish in
German-language or Germanistic outlets.  The third is the substantive
question of the proper analysis of the linguistic facts, i.e., of the
relation of the language of any given "OY/MY" text to German on the one hand
and to modern Yiddish on the other.  I believe some would argue that the
people who use German-based transliterations also tend to be those who want
to treat OY/MY as a mere variety of German, but this is not true in general. 
Erika Timm clearly treats the language of OY/MY texts as Yiddish, and yet
uses German-based transliterations. I myself am perhaps the strongest
advocate of the idea that almost all "OY/MY"  texts were composed in the
same language which we now know as Yiddish (and that all of Yiddish comes
from a single source), yet I have no objection to using German- based
transliterations (though, since I do not live in a German-speaking country,
publish in German-lg journals (actually I do, but not on Yiddish!), or teach
in a Germanic department, I have never used them myself). 

On the other hand, one can make a stronger case that those who transliterate
"OY/MY" into the modern YIVO system for Yiddish or any other system for
modern Yiddish have tended to be people who beg the question of the relation
of the older texts to modern Yiddish, by simply making it a matter of
definition that any sort of German-like language used by Jews before the
19th century has to be called "Yiddish", even if it is indistinguishable
from German.  But again tehre are exceptions.  I have used the Yivo system,
and in fact I even use it for Modern Israeli Hebrew, because it is very
convenient, and yet I do not believe that every pre-19th century kind of
German-based speech used by Jews was Yiddish (though most were). 

So, in short, transliteration practices CAN be a sign of ideological or
theoretical commitments, but thet NEED NOT be.

Subject: Boris Tomaszewski and Natan Gross

In response to some of Gilles Rozier's queries:

Boris Tomaszewski's dates are 1866-1939 (Nayer Leksikon, 4:17). The
birthdate 1886 given in Zilbercwaig's Leksikon (2:804) is a typo, as can be
seen from the rest of the text. 

Natan Gross in "Toledot ha-kolnoa ha-yehudi be-Polin" (History of Yiddish
Film in Poland), p. 56, gives the following dates for the celebrated comedy
team of Dzhigan and Shumakher: Shimen Dzhigan (1905-80), Yisroel Shumakher
(1908-61). 

Mit di beste grusn,

Subject: Zikh, Mikh etc.

In reply to Sam Kweskin's question, he asks whether mikh is used as well as
zikh for the first person reflexive. The answer is yes. and "dikh" etc. "Ikh
vash mikh op", I wash me up- " spil dikh nisht mit im"- Don't play with him-
are what I grew up saying. 

Teaching is much easier the standard way where sikh covers all. I don't
really know how that was decided though.

Congrats, zakh you can say, zikh you must write. You nailed it. There are
other examples of misunderstandings but -- however much you may love mame
loshn, one has to learn a little yiddish.

Subject: Feet and legs

Inspired by Liebe Denner's post on "lernen", I must ask a question that
has been puzzling my 3-year-old son and myself for a long time: how can
one distinguish between "feet" and "legs" when speaking Yiddish?  The
dictionaries only list "fis" for both.  Thanks,  

Yankev Lewis
