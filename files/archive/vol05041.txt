Subject: Af tselokhes

The Yiddish expression "af tselokhes" is equivalent to the English
"for spite". Er hot es im geton oif tselokhes = He did it to him
for spite.

I also recall my folks calling a spiteful person a tselokhesnik.

Subject: Af tselokhes

I read with interest the responses to Michael's inquiry.  I had found an
explanation by Fred Kogos ("Yiddish Slang & Expressions") which was
similar, but not quite the same.  Here it is.  What do you folks think?

      In spite of everything you do, it still comes out wrong.

Subject: Af tselokhes

Thanks to all for the etymology of "Af tselokhes!"  My father used the
phrase quite often, and although I knew it meant "for spite," for some
reason I always thought it was derived from the Yiddish "lakhen" -- to
laugh.  That would have made Af tselokhes mean "for a laugh," which
always made sense to me.  Just another case of totally unrelated words
happening to sound alike.  I am glad to be corrected.

My parents used "davka" (I would have written "dafka") in the 1930s. I
would have translated it: "for spite".

Subject: Hebrew/Yiddish prayerbook

There are similar siddurim today with Hebrew and English; the Metzuda
Siddur is quite widely used, particularly in Orthodox shuls that
encourage beginners and baalei tshuva (Aish HaTorah and the like). The
purpose is to let you learn the davening in Hebrew and yet understand
what you're saying, by seeing the English equivalent to each few words. I
presume the Hebrew/Yiddish siddur described had the same function.

Subject: Linear prayer book

Larry Rosenwald posted recently regarding a Hebrew-Yiddish "Linear Prayer
Book", published by Joseph Magil in Washington in 1905 (I think he said).
He asked how common such a book was.  I have a Hebrew-ENGLISH "Linear
Prayer Book" by this same Magil, copyright in Washington the same year,
though published in Philadelphia.  I also have a Hebrew-English "Linear
School Bible" by Magil, copyright in Washington in 1899 and published in
New York and Philadelphia in 1910.  I have always assumed my father used
these in kheder as a boy (since my father tells me he spent most of his
kheder hours playing hooky under the boardwalk because of the rebbe's
baytsh, maybe that explains why these books are in such good condition!).
Both books have advertising on the inside back cover, completely in
Yiddish, extolling the virtues of "Magilnitsky's Linyen-Siddur" in
various incarnations, and of the "Yiddishes Tageblat" (sic)--"a tsaytung
fir alle Iden".

My mother--a grine in the late twenties--brought with her from Slutsk a
learn-to-read-Hebrew book, called "Eyden ha-Yiladim", published in Warsaw
in 1902, has vocabulary lists from Hebrew to Yiddish and Russian, and to
French and English (in lesser type).  The frontispiece tells us it is a
"chrestomathy for the use of children with translation of the vocables in
Russian, _German_, French and English" [my emphasis].  This frontispiece
tells us this IN the four named languages, to wit for example: "nebst
uebersetzung der Vocabeln..." etc.  This is the only German that occurs
in the entire book.  Had they such contempt for "zhargon" that they had
to disguise it as German?  Or was this a ploy related to the official
censor?

Subject: Vinkl

Does "vinkl" ever mean a shop/store in Yiddish?  I know that in Dutch a
"winkel" is a store.  (Perhaps this meaning evolved from corner
stores....)
