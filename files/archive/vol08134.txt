Subject: Snowball

On page 176 of my 1947 edition of Immanuel Olsvanger's _Royte Pomerantsen_ ,
in his last folk tale (_Got un Motke_), a large crowd of thirsty revelers
are gathered in a tavern.  Nine lines from the top of the page is a line
which reads "_Un glezlakh mit mashke zanen gefloygn fun eyn hant in di
andere azoy vi alkes shney_."  The word _alkes_ is defined in a footnote as
"snowball."  I'm unable to find _alkes_ in the Yiddish to English section of
Weinreich and in the English to Yiddish section he has _shneykoyl_.  My
Hebrew dictionary lists "snowball" quite literally as _kadur sheleg_.  My
ancient Russian dictionary has _snyezhOK_ [my emphasis].  And the German
word is simply _Schneeball_.  I'd therefore be grateful if anyone can give
me a brief gloss on _alkes_ in regard to its etymology.

Subject: "Kumt Zu Gein"

The phrase "Kumt Zu Gein", which usually means "come and visit" but
literally translates "come to go". I would appreciate some explanation of
this phrase and its origin.  a sheinem dank.

Subject: a fishl, a vontzik, oyf shabes

I find difficulty in translating the following expression (the description
is of shopping for the Sabbath) 'a fishl, a vontzik, oyf shabes' Harkavy
says a vontze is a moustache which in this case is of no help at all. 
anyone with ideas ? 

thanks

Subject: "khoyfen" (Hebrew) and "hoyfn" (Yiddish)

Epes mit a shaykhes tsu der frierdiker parshe:

Is there any etymologic connection between Loshn-koydesh "khoyfen" handful
and Yiddish "hoyfn" handful?  I know, I know: Thou Shalt Not Assume Anything
>From Phonetic Similarities, but the untutored mind still wonders (e.g. does
"kh" ever become "h"?)...

Subject: translation of menedzsher

I have a question.  In Zylbercweig's Leksikon fun Yidishn Teater, he
describes, l'moshl , Max R. Wilner as the "menedzsher fun Irving Place
Theater."  Would the correct translation of this be Producing Director or
Executive Director?  A theater manager, in the current sense of the word, as
someone who deals with the daily operation of a theater, does not accurately
describe Max R. Wilner.  Or perhaps, we should attempt to reclaim the word
manager (in English) as someone who runs the theater, books the space,
brings in actors, fundraises, calls the shots and watches over the overall
production. I noticed looking through old programs that Seymour Rexite
called himself the manager (after the Yiddish term, I imagine) of Hard to be
a Jew at the Eden Theater, a show that he organized.  What do you think? 

Thanks -

Subject: Henryk Lew

A colleague is urgently seeking information about Heryk Lew, a Jewish
ethnographer. He was also known as Henry Lew, and as Henry (Henryk)
Lew-Landowski. Henryk Lew collected materials in Yiddish around the time of
Y.L. Peretz and published in the periodical Wisla and Israelita ca.
1880-1890. 

I would be grateful for any information about him, or leads to information
about him. 

Thank you,
Dana Keren

Subject: SELF LEARNING COMPUTER SOFTWARE FOR YIDDISH

Does anyone know of any "teach yourself"  language software for Yiddish.  I
know of quite a few on the market for Hebrew, but I have never seen or heard
of anything for Yiddish.

Subject: Nozum/nozem, Amsterdam

The following question has been passed on to me by a colleague, in the hope
of finding an interested Amsterdamer Mendelyaner: 

"I'm writing something which includes the Amsterdamse term nozum. Amsterdam
slang is full of Yiddish - mazzel, majem, gannef (gonif), ponem, jajem are
all in daily use, and doubtless others. But in the fifties a class of
pre-punks arose which were called nozems, and in the old (hardcover) Bob
Evers from 1956 this is spelled nozum, which led me to think it just might
be Yiddish. Anyone know?"

Subject: Death of a legendary figure

In 1911, within a day or two of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire, the Yiddish
press was, as you would expect, full of stories and pictures of the event. 
One of the most important and tragic photos, was that of a young girl, named
Bessie Cohen, who was swooning into the arms of her friends on seeing the
bodies of some of her fellow workers.  The photo has appeared in many
anthologies dealing with labor issues, early Jewish sweatshops in NY,
exploitation of female labor, etc. 

Yesterday, in Los Angeles and at the age of 107, Bessie Cohen passed away,
until very recently still in good mental and physical health.  There is
still one survivor of that terrible event and she is now over 100.
