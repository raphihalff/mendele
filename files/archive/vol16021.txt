Subject: "Yidl mitn fidl"

"Yidl mitn Fidl" is from a 1936 movie of the same name starring the
adorable Molly Picon, and as far as I know, was the last Yiddish movie made
in Poland before the war, giving us a rare view of shtetl life of pre-war
Poland.  The exteriors were filmed in Kazimierz Dolny, a town on the
Wistula River, and the interiors in a Warsaw studio.  The majority of the
cast are locals and, aside from Molly, Polish-born.

The story features Molly Picon as Yidl, a young fiddle player, and Simkce
Fostel as her father Arye, a bass player, as in the refrain from the song
"Tsen brider" on which it appears to be based.  As they travel, trying to
make some kind of living, Yidl pretends to be a boy, as her father says she
will be safer that way (and, historically speaking, a not uncommon way for
females to travel).

They successfully join up with two competing musicians, clarinetist Isaac
(Max Bozyk), and the handsome young Froim (Leon Liebgold), another fiddle
player.  Yidl, of course, falls in love with him (I suppose there have
always been groupies). The plot takes all kinds of Shakespearean twists due
to misunderstandings.  It all ends happily, naturally.

In her autobiography "Molly!", Picon said about the town:

"I had never seen such poverty---outdoor plumbing, rickety wooden houses
bent into fantastic shapes, and the people unbelievably threadbare. The
skeletal children, with their long peyes and little yarmulkes, wore
trousers that were in shreds and shoes tied on their feet with rope. My
heart went out to every one of them. We gave them coins (they wouldn't
accept food--it wasn't kosher), and with the coins they bought grapes and
came back to share them with me."

Describing the wedding scene in the movie she said: "The food had to be
truly kosher, because we hired the Orthodox Jewish men, women and children
of Kazimierz to be the guests. As we filmed, they ate, and for the
successive shots of the table, the food had to be replenished, over and
over again. Our poverty-stricken guests couldn't figure out what was
happening. They thought they had been invited to a real wedding, and when
one of the woman asked why so much food, we explained to her it wasn't a
real wedding, we were just making a film. I don't think she had ever seen a
film, but she said, "Why didn't you tell me that before? With so much food,
I could have brought my daughter to get married for real. She has a khosn,
but we have no money for a dowry to make a proper wedding."

It is sad to think of what must have happened just a few years later to
most of the people appearing in the film, but it is an invaluable resource
to be able to view this slice of Yiddishland.

(The original sheet music has the word tsop, rather than tsig, as is
commonly sung).

Subject: polish

I have seen the word frequently in the Holocaust Memorial Books I
translate, and I bet on Slavic [origins for the word], based on the
following entries in my Polish slownik:

pulap -- a ceiling

pulapka -- a trap

That's not a "l," but a Polish "l" with a line through it, making it
soundlike a "w."

It strikes me that this "pulish" or "polish" was a somewhat tight space,
which leads me to suspect this root as the origin. Lacking hubris, I am
also copying two fluent Polish speakers of my acquaintance for a further
view.

Subject: na dir akht un akhtsik

A possible clue toward explaining the phrase:  almost every modern piano
has 88 keys (seven octaves plus a minor third, from A0 to C8).

Subject:  kleynkunst-teater

Kleynkunst-teater is something between "caf-teatre" and "cabaret" (sorry I
don't know the English equivalents), a small place where artists of several
specialties (actors, singers, musicians, dancers) play short artistic
forms. The most famous Yiddish "kleynkunst-teaters" were Azazel, created in
Warsaw in 1926 by director Dovid Herman, painter Henrik Berlevi, and
actress Tea Artshishevska; and Ararat, created in Lodz by Moyshe Broderzon,
who became famous in all of Europe and remained active until WWII. The
comedians Shimen Dzigan and Yisroel Szumacher became famous thanks to
Ararat. Their famous sketches are typical of the Yiddish kleynkunst-teater,
but more serious or "artistic" works were also played, such as works from
famous Yiddish writers (Y. L. Peretz, Moyshe-Leyb Halpern or Moyshe
Kulbak).

Subject: kleynkunst-teater

At their zenith, the Artef, the Vilna Troupe, the Moscow Yiddish State
Theater, and the Yiddish Art Theater of New York were among the finest
drama groups in the world. Kleynkunst-teater featured a Shwartz, Ben-ami,
Turkov, Gersten... The production would have been a classic such as "The
Dybbuk," "Yankl der shmid," "Grine felder." Kleykunst is "beser teater in a
kleyn form." It is also in some circles called revi teater (with music). A
full, high quality show yet a smaller format, not a full blown production
of a classic (from world literature). Dzigan & Szumacher, The Boyziks, and
many others played kleynkunst-teater. (On a personal note, it is something
that I strive to do with my programs as an actor, singer and  director.)

The Niborski-Vaisbrot dictionary defines "kleynkunst" as "varits," which
means popular music.  In German "Kleinkunst" means cabaret (in other words,
popular music and theatrical or comedic sketches performed in clubs).  In
the years between the two World Wars there was a thriving Yiddish cabaret
scene in Warsaw.  Dzigan and Szumacher were part of this scene.

Subject:  kleynkunst-teater

Kleynkunst usually means a genre of music or theater, which is performed by
a small number of performers with limited props etc - small forms. In terms
of theater, it can include pantomime, comedy, cabaret, puppet theater, and
recitals. Regarding the Yiddish theater, this term can be found in
reference to the end of 19th/beginning of 20th century Yiddish
kleinkunst-teaters, which developed alongside with serious classical and
avant-garde theaters in Easter Europe.

Nahma Sandrow describes kleynkunst revues on page 323-328 in her book,
"Vagabond Stars: A World History of Yiddish Theater" (New York: Harper and
Row, 1977).  Here is a quote from pages 323-324:

"Beginning in the 1920s, kleynkunst became a voguish genre among Polish
Yiddish sophisticates. Kleynkunst was a sort of cabaret revuew, witty, gay
and irreverent, rapidly winging from music to dance to monologue to
sketch...The cabaret revue had been part of Yiddish theater since the
Broder Singers, who combined songs, skits, personal comments, and topical
jokes. Concerts made up of readings and monologues together with musical
interludes had been an established genre of Yiddish theater ever since."

Subject: kleynkunst, mir/wir, polish

1. kleinkunst is of course a daytshmerizm, since in Yiddish proper the
first element is kunts, not kunst. In German, kleinkunstbhne is the term
for an intimate theater or a cabaret.

2. mir is not a Yiddish invention, It is found in many German dialects,
mainly southern, instead of the standard wir. One of the accounts of mir
sees it as a phonetic development due to assimilation of w- to preceding
nasal -n in frequently used sequences of the type sagen wir, kommen wir,
etc.

3. Indeed, all the proposals to explain the etymology of polish made so far
remain unsatisfactory, and unless someone makes an unexpected discovery in
an unknown text, things will remain as they are. But, then, this is also
the situation regarding davenen. So don't be too optimistic.
