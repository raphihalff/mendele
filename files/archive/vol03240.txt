Subject: Schindler's List.

	When I originally posted my letter about Schindler's list, I
meant for it to be a discussion about the role of Yiddish in the
movie. I know that a lot of us have seen the movie and from the
comments I have read there is a lot of discussion.  Several times I
have felt a desire to write a response to comments I've read.  But I
haven't.

	A discussion of the merits of the movie and its criticism is
not appropriate to this network.  I have debated the movie on two
other listservers and it is interesting to see what comes out.  I
would be happy to direct anyone who askes me to the appropriate
Holocaust network, however I am really more interested in seeing
this group as a forum for discussions about Yiddish.  Others I have
"spoken" to in private conversation share this view.

Subject: Yiddish Writers and Non-Jews

For a graduate history seminar, I am writing a paper on Yiddish
writers and their attitude toward non-Jews.  I'm looking especially
at Yiddish writers in interwar Poland.  My interest in this issue
stems from a general interest in relations between Poles and Jews,
but, more specifically, from an article by Chone Shmeruk, "Jews and
Poles in Yiddish Literature in Interwar Poland." (Title approximate,
Polin, v. 1, 1986)

Shmeruk identifies portrayals of Poles by Yiddish writers as a
marginal phenomenon.  Nonetheless, he also says that much more needs
to be known about this topic.  I'm particularly interested in
contacts the Yiddish-speaking intelligentsia had with Polish culture
and how this affected, or didn't affect, their work.  The writers I
have looked at so far include Zusman Segalovitch, Meylekh Ravitch,
I. J. Singer, I. B. Singer, Yisroel Rabon, and Sholem Asch. I'm also
relying heavily on the Trunk and Tsaytlin anthology of Yiddish prose
in Poland between the wars.  I'd really like suggestions on memoirs
by Yiddish writers from this time period as well as works which
depict Poles or non-Jews, whether they take place in the interwar
period or not.

In reviewing some of this material, I've noticed several works in
which the Polish character appears as some kind of domestic help
(Asch's "Koyler gesl," Bashevis' "Di Veshin" and Shosha, and I. J.
Singer's "Altshtot").  Should I attach any importance to this
observation?

Any comments or suggestions are very much appreciated.  A sheynem
dank.

Subject: Introduction + Music Hearsay

Bret Werb tapping in..  Born Los Angeles, aged thirties,
musicologist.  Recently married.  Working as a consultant to US
Holocaust Memorial Museum, Washington DC.  Both parents are native
Yiddish speakers; myself I don't speak at all (feels too clumsy) but
can cope with written text, esp if there's lots of time.

The workplace only recently signed on to Internet and
reception/transmission is still spotty.  But when I find time and
the file (via columbia.edu), I read through Mendele's archives.
Thank you for creating this service!

I recall seeing in the archives a request for information about a
Yiddish tune sung in Vietnamese.  2-3 years ago, in LA's Chinatown,
I too heard a Vietnamese rendition of a familiar hit from the
Yiddish theater.  The song was "Dona Dona Dona."  When I asked the
lady in the booth the song's title, she said: "Dona Dona Dona."

The song is an international hit, so a Vietnamese version didn't
surprise me enough to make me want to buy the cassette.  It's
possible that the Vietnamese artists learned it from the French, as
your correspondent supposes, or (my guess) from a Japanese
commercial recording.  Anyway, this ends my first transmission.

Thanks again for Mendele.

Bret Werb
