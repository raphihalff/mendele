[shmarovoz--3.006]

Ukrainian _shmarovoz_ or _smaroviz_ = a) 'wheel-greaser' and hence
'someone involved with wagons and therefore constantly covered with
grease' and b) 'someone dressed in dirty clothing'. Yiddish also has
_shmarovoz_ and _smarovoz_ in both meanings. Ukrainian
_shmaruvaty_/_smaruvaty_ and Russian _shmarovat_ 'to grease,
lubricate' are presumably from Polish  _smarovac'_ 'idem', which is
in turn from MHG _smir(w)en_ or MLG _smeren_. Cf. modern standard
German _schmieren_.

But there is also a Russian dialect and argot (thieves' slang) word
_shmara_ = 'thief's lover or prostitute,' of uncertain etymology.
Combined with the root of the Russian verb _vozit'sia_ 'busy oneself
with' it gives another meaning to the word _shmarovoz_, namely,
'pimp.'

I don't know whether that meaning exists in Yiddish; it would make
sense as a possible reading of the line from the song "Dem ganefs
yikhes" (or "Vos bistu, ketsele [or:  kotinke] baroygez?"),
especially in its context:

     Mayn tate iz a shmarevoznik [a variant form?],
     Di mame ganvet fish in mark,
     Un der bruder iz a kartozhnik,
     Un di shvester...ti di di di di di di di dom...

(This is Kipnis' version; Cahan has a similar text, for which he
glosses _shmarovoznik_ as 'proster yung.')

In my book, that doesn't prove a thing. a nekhtiger tog (= a yesterday)
will never happen again, so is an unlikely proposition.

Just in case you were interested.

Subject: Hybrid idioms; playing-card terms

In view of the weightier matters recently put on the table here (the
startling proposals from Wexler that Yiddish is a Slavic language
and that modern Hebrew is Yiddish, and the revitalization of Yiddish
contemplated in Boro Park), I'm almost embarrassed to raise the
following--but not so embarrassed as to refrain.

(1) To Elye Katz:  are bilingual (E-Y) expressions includable in
your collection of idioms?  A very common (and useful) one from my
childhood:

"pleyn un poshet" =  straightforward(ly), without embellishment;`Period!'
"Lomir zogn dem emes:  er'z a ganef, pleyn un poshet."

Also:  "iz dos a sistem [what makes it hybrid is that the emphasis
is on the first syllable:  SIStem]?" = `what kind of way is that to
run a railroad?'; where's the fairness/sense in that?  Milt Gross,
who wrote and illustrated brief comic pieces (English, with very
exaggerated Yiddish accents) about apartment-dwelling immigrant Jews
in New York City in the 1930's-40's [Nize Baby; Looey, Dot Dope],
made frequent use of this.

(2) I'd be interested in knowing how others refer[red] to
playing-card suits and values.  Weinreich gives

club = der shpog
diamond = der lekekh
heart = dos royts, dos eykhl
spade = der pik, dos shvarts
ace = di toyz
jack = der poyer
(no separate entry for king or queen in cards)

Maybe these were the standard terms in der alter heym.  But when my
father played pinochle, poker and klabyatsh with his landslayt and
other friends (all native speakers of Yiddish, but long after their
immigration to the US) in Brooklyn, the English words were generally
used, except that a spade (or spades) were often called "shipe"
(Slavic?).  The cards from two through 10 were numbered in Yiddish,
sometimes in diminutive:  a tsveytl harts, for example. The picture
cards and ace were English:  dzhek, kvin, kin[i]g, eys.  Trump was
"tromf"; I never heard Weinreich's "kozer".
