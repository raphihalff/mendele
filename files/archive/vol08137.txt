[Moderator's note: to avoid accusations of being an armchair shames I
am
undertaking a field trip to the countries with the high density of Mendele
subscribers, where I will personally check the situation around timely
distribution of Mendele digests. As a result there might be an
interruption 
in the delivery of new issues until my return on April 15th.

Subject: Israel Zangwill

I don't know anything about his Yiddish writings, but Israel Zangwill
wrote
some translations of the High Holiday piyyutim, published in the
"Service of
the Synagogue" (British) machzor set. The most remarkable is his
translation
of "amnam keyn", in the Kol Nidre service, where he followed the
Hebrew
acrostic and metre: 

Ay, 'tis thus    evil us        hath in bond
By Thy grace     guilt efface   and respond
                                     "Forgiven!"
Cast scorn o'er  and abhor      th'informer's word
Dear G-d, deign  this refrain   to make heard
                                     "Forgiven!"

[etc.]

Subject: bawdy yidish folksong

I believe that "embarrassing" yidish folksongs are part of our heritage
and
should be regarded as such. 
        
The following ditty was sung to me over 70 years ago by a friend. I can
recall only a short segment. I would appreciate more verses if anyone
recalls them. 

        Tsar Nikolay

Tsar Nikolay, Tsar Nikolay,zog mir mit vemen host du khasene gehat.
A kurve, a shmate, an oysgtrente late,
Zog mir mit vemen host du khasene gehat.

Dort in gas shteyt zi,
Und mit dem toches dreyt zi,
Zog mir mit vemen host du khasene gehat.

Weinreich doesn't include toches (such a good yidish vort), but Harkavy
does.

Subject: What to say to a sneeze?

Because of the flu bugs raging around here we need information on
what to
say in Yiddish when someone sneezes, once, twice, three times, etc.
(the
Pregnancy and Childhood Dictionary suggests "tsu gezunt" for the first
sneeze and "tsum lebn" for the second sneeze.  In our family we tend to
sneeze six or seven times in a row.)

Subject: nozem                                            

In answer to Charles Jones I would like to say that the Dutch word
nozem/nozum is not Yiddish.

Amsterdam slang and even not-slang is full of Yiddish, but most of these
words came into the Dutch language not directly from Yiddish but via a
thieves'slang, which is called 'Bargoens' (German 'Rotwelsch').  This is
also the case with the word nozem. 

In Dutch we have the word penoze, which means underworld. So, from
Yiddish
via Bargoens the word parnose came into the language as penoze.  And
probably nozem (we do not spell nozum) is derived from penoze. The
final -m
is on the analogy of majem, mokem, ponem etc.

Subject: nozem

In his book 'Resten van een taal', a little dictionary of Dutch Jiddisch, H.
Beem says that nozem isn't a Yiddish word, but has probably been
derived
from the word penoze, a dutch slang word that comes from the Yiddish
word
parnose. 

In the Official List of Dutch Words the word is spelled nozem.  It is still
a common Dutch word.

Subject: nozem/nozum, Amsterdam

In answer to a question posted by Charles Jones:

The term "nozem" is well-known in dutch slang.  Before it became, in
the
fifties, the designation for an anti-bourgeois youth movement ("the
pre-punks class"), a nozem refered to a silly, ignorant boy. The origin of
the word is uncertain; according to the "Dikke van Dale" (dutch
dictionnary)
it could have been derived from the english word: "nothing". 

Since nozem is also written as nozum, and since the Amsterdam
vernacular is
full of yiddish idiom, Mr. Jones suggested the word might have a yiddish
origin and/or a hebrew root. Therefore I consulted "Jerosche", a dutch
dictionairy of "Yiddish proverbs and expressions in the dutch speaking
regions"" (author H. Beem, first ed. 1959). But without any succes.
Finally,
consulting a hebrew dictionary, I found "nezem" meaning "nose-ring". 

So "nozem" might be a suitable yiddish designation for the modern
pearcing-generation. But for the pre-punks of the fifties I found
"nothing".
