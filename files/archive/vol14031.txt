Subject: Yiddish with Palm OS 5

Could anyone help me find a program to read and write Yiddish on my Zire 72
running Palm OS 5.

I am studying Yiddish and would like to use a flash card program on the Zire
to help me memorize Yiddish words.

Also what Hebrew text entry system will allow me to enter the pasakh aleph,
komets aleph , pasakh zvey yuden , etc. correctly?

A sheynem dank,

Ben Teller

Subject: Chovetz Chaim

I've run across reference to a character, person or type of person in Philip
Roth's "Operation Sylock"  that is strange to me, which is perhaps not so
strange.  This character goes by the name of Chovetz Chaim.   The Chofetz
Chaim wrote the definitive work on Jewish gossip, or loose talk (loshon hora).
He died at age 95, "after having devoted his long life," says Roth, to trying
to get Jews to shut up."  (I add: thank goodness he didn't succeed). This is
on page 333 of the book..  Does anyone know what "Chovetz"  means? Was there a
real historical character, or someone in Yiddish literature or folklore whose
name was Chovetz Chaim (Roth's spelling)?  Of course, this may be purely
Roth's fabrication, but maybe not.  I'd be most appreciative for any
information on this.

Subject: Laihke fun Lakewood

About 70 years ago I remember listening to an old record on my bobe's
Victrola.  The song was about "Laihke fun Lakewood" and I'd be
interested if a) anyone remembers this song, b) if anyone has the
record.

Subject: zi geyt in spodek

Harkavy's Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary (p. 842) s.v. "spodek" has the
expression "geyn in spodek" as something said about a woman who dominates her
husband, similar to the English "she wears the pants".   A similar expression
occurs in a story I am working on and I would be interested in hearing from
Mendelyaner who know of this expression or similar ones involving the spodek
or shtrayml and can comment on the usage and connotations of such expressions.

A groysn dank,

Justin Jaron Lewis

Subject: Sephardim and Yiddish

I have been working on a lecture devoted to the Yiddish language history and
customs of the Ashkenazi Jews.

I know that the Sephardic Jews spoke Ladino, a mixture of Spanish or
Portuguese with Hebrew mixed in.

I'd like to know about those Sephardic Jews who learned to speak Yiddish --
perhaps after the inquisition period or the flight to Canada and the U.S. in
order to do business or trade with their Ashkenazi cousins. Can anyone lead
me in the right path on this? Thank you,

Alan B. Berkowitz
