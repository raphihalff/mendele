Subject: RE: Mendele Vol 1.217

In response to Bob Werman's thoughts on Modern Hebrew "bis"
for bite:  it most assuredly was borrowed from the Yiddish
"bisl" meaning "a small amount."  Any attempt to involve
Arabic smacks of folk etymology - why look for a
complicated etymology when a simple one will do quite
nicely.  Does Arabic really have an analogous word "bis?"
I'd be really surprised if it did. However, Yiddish "bis"
and English "piece" may, in fact, be cognates; Webster's
gives an etymology involving Old French, and I don't have
my OED here at work.

Subject: Swiss German

This is just to counter Knud Lambrecht's charming tale of
the bobe who got by in Zurich relying on the hypothesis
that Schweitzer-Deutsch is a form of Yiddish.

My wife and I were at a resort in Corsica a few years ago
where there were no English speakers. We were placed at the
Swiss table. I did alright with the Hoch Deutsch and my
wife managed with French, but when the Swiss lapsed into
Swiss German, I was quite lost. After a week, I was just
beginning to catch a few words. (My Yiddish is not great,
but I have no problems at the Yiddish theatre.)

In this connection, I can mention that my mother, who
really knew no German, never hesitated to speak it; her
"German" was Yiddish with the consonants (especially the
"l") pronounced in something like the German manner.

Subject: correction
To: mendele@Vax1.Trincoll.Edu

Last week I committed the grave error of not signing my
article in Mendele 1,216 (item 2.) Subsequently, it was
assigned to Evelyn Ehrlich, and that got some people
confused. Fortunately, I was able to prove that I had no
intention to harm her reputation, and she accepted my
apologies. I also wish to apologize to anybody else, whom I
may have confused by this mistake. In order to clarify
matters, let me repeat my introductory statement (without
the boos)

Name: Yitzhak Kertesz
Country of origin: Hungary
Occupation: Technical services librarian
Affiliation: Leo Baeck Institute, N.Y.
Current interest: origins of the words "schlemiel" and
          "shlimmazal".

I stand by my note about the origin of the word "eppes".

Subject: yiddish word order

I have a short question on the acceptability of a Yiddish
sentence. In History of the Yiddish Language, Weinreich
gives a sentence: Nokhn bentshen hot der zeyde gekoyft a
seyfer Is the following variant acceptable? Nokhn bentshen
der zeyde hot gekoyft a seyfer Sorry to ask such an
elementary question, but I don't know any any informants in
the area to get acceptability judgements from.

Thank you,

Gus Grannan
