Subject: Introduction

I am a Ph D linguistics student planning to write my
dissertation (in a couple more years) on a topic related to
Yiddish.  I attended di zumer programm at Comunbia this
summer (where I did NOT) learn to edit e-mail.  ) (excuse
my mistakes--I'll learn soon)

There are very few Yiddishists or Yiddish enthusiasts in
Colorado!

Subject: RE: "Germans"

Tayerer Yitskhok/Yitskhek/Itskik Kertesh:

"Germans" -- note the quotation marks in my note -- are of
course _daytshn_ af yidish (not, please "deytschen"). There
are things about this "joke" I don't quite get either.
Presumably, Yiddish speakers would associate Dutch _van_,
like the more familiar German _von_, with nobility. My main
purpose was to record this item.  I am not altogether
satisfied with my first effort to explain it.

Subject: RE: Tsukunft

For Dan Breslauer, Of course you should subscribe to the
Tsukumft. It's been publishing since 1892. It's affiliated
with tsiko and the  Jewish culture Congress. Dina
Abramovitsh, among others has articles in it. Besides, it's
a mitsve to support a Yiddish literary journal that carried
Niger, Minkoff, and other important critics.

Subject: "Bloyz" and "Nor"

Is there a difference in usage and meaning between "bloyz"
and "nor"?

Thanks,

Subject: Answer Book for Weinreich?

Is there an answer book for the exercises in Weinreich? If
there is not, perhaps such a book would help a great many
people learn Yiddish. I am trying to systematically go
through Weinreich, and it would be nice to be able to check
my own work rather than bother my teacher about every
exercise I complete. My teacher should hear from me only
when I do *not* understand the exercises!

If others feel such an effort would be important, I would
happily coordinate the following effort (and accept help
from others):

  - We divide up "College Yiddish", with individuals
    volunteering to complete the exercises for a given
    chapter.

  - We copyright the answers, but grant anyone permission
    to copy and distribute them for free as long as the
    copyright notice is intact, and with the understanding
    that corrections/emendations come back to us.
    Periodically, we could publish revisions, both on-line
    and off.

  - The compilation work (that is, the exchange of answers)
    would be done on-line via email. Obviously, there are
    some technical difficulties with the Yiddish alphabet,
    but these can be overcome fairly easily --- the
    problems are not that bad.

Any thoughts from Mendele?
