Subject: Query

A phrase from I.J.Singer has raised a question, about
which more in a moment.  The phrase goes: '[eyner] vos
es geyt im nisht in lebn'. The phrase was read to the
group of elderly Yiddish-speakers with whom I have been
meeting for the last 2 years at the local Hebrew Home
for the Aged.  They are mostly women, American born. 
Some speak Yiddish quite well.

Most of us thought we understood the phrase but there
was sharp disagreement whether this was the negative
form of 'es geyt im in lebn'.

A second question was whether any or all of these is
correct:

1. Es geyt mir in lebn.
2. Es geyt mir nisht in lebn arayn.
3. Es geyt aykh in lebn.
4. Vos geyt es aykh in lebn?
5. Vos geyt es aykh on?

In short, clarification is urgently needed.

And now things get more interesting.  I mentioned to my
friends that I wasn't sure of the answers but that I
had about 40 friends who knew everything and that I'd
be glad to ask them.  How? they asked.  I told them
about Mendele.  Great curiosity.  B'kitser, I promised
to bring along a portable computer to our next session
and would play back to them all of the answers received
by June 27.  Great excitement.

Khavertes un khaverim!  Zayt zikh matriekh un shikt vos
gikher ayere tshuves.  Idish, English, es makht nisht
oys, abi geentfert.

A shaynem dank.

Noyekh
