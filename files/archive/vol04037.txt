Subject: Introduction

I am new to Internet and have been lurking in Mendele's halls for some
weeks. There is not much to tell except that I heard and understood my
grandparents' and other's Yiddish as a child, but had never heard a child
speak Yiddish -- so I didn't either.  Because of that, I suffer some lack
of confidence.  I call myself a perpetual student of Yiddish, an amateur,
without credentials but with great curiosity.

I come forward to write because of recent mention by some mendeleniks
that they have heard some people say that Yiddish is not a real language.
Why would it not be as real as French, Spanish and Italian, all
derivatives of Latin? Vos iz der untersheyd?

Subject: Introduction

As a newly joined member of _Mendele_ I should like to introduce myself
to you all, with the hope that we shall be in correspondence for a long
time to come.

My name is Joseph Sherman, and I live in Johannesburg, South Africa where
I teach English Literature in the University of the Witwatersrand,
although my major research interest is Yiddish literature. My special
areas of specialisation in Yiddish are South African Yiddish writing, the
brothers I.J. and I.B. Singer, Ayzik-Meir Dik and Sholem Asch.

I wonder how many of _Mendele's_ readers abroad know that there is a
considerable body of Yiddish literature entirely indigenous to South
Africa? I have published, in English translation, a volume of Yiddish
stories about South Africa entitled _From A Land Far Off_, as well as
several critical articles on Yiddish topics in journals both here in
South Africa and in the States.

Yiddish was a home language for me; my parents and grandparents both
spoke it all the time, and I studied Hebrew to Matriculation level in a
Jewish Day School here. The Yiddishists lost the battle hopelssly to the
Zionists here in South Africa, and during my childhood and adolescence,
many parents (not mine, borukh hashem) were actually ashamed that their
children should know or speak Yiddish.

I should be particularly interested to hear from other readers about the
potential level of interest there might be in America and elsewhere in
the world about South African Yiddish literature. If I were to translate,
edit and annotate a major Yiddish South African novel, would there be
readers (and buyers) of the book out there? I should mention that the
novel I have in mind was written by my late uncle, Jacob Mordecai
Sherman, who was for over fifty years the leading figure and guiding
spirit of Yiddish literature and belles-lettres here. The reason I ask
about this novel, in possible English translation, is that I am trying to
persuade my university's press to publish it, and they are (I suppose
understandably) reluctant to do so without knowing what kind of market
there might be both here and abroad.

Lost visn, khevre.

Subject: Shoym

Bibliographical query: When was I.B.Singer's "Shoym" (published in
English in 1991 as "Scum") first published in Yiddish?  Was it serialized
in the "Forverts"? If so, when?

Electronic query: Does anyone have Avrom Novershtern's e-mail address in
Israel?  (Oder efsher bist du take do in Mendele?  Oyb azoy, gib a
rir...)

Subject: bintel briv letters

i share dan leeson's wish that the original letters to the bintel briv
column be found and made accessible. however, i should think that making
the names of the writers public would be highly actionable and not
something any newspaper is about to do.

Subject: Touring Deutschland with Yiddish/Then & Now

One is glad to hear that it is possible to tour Germany today with some
Yiddish remnants. We thought we might get driven from a camera shop in
Munich in 1952, July, when my wife, who has no Deutsch, broke in with a
question, starting with Efsher...?  The saleswoman, middleaged, to our
young 20s glared at us.

If household Yiddish can get one around, perhaps some things are
improved.

As for a Dictionary of Yiddish literati, perhaps one might turn to Gale
Research, which has a lot of bibliographical projects always coming
along, and might be willing to support such an endeavor, who knows?  They
are in Detroit, the Penobscot Building. Yours,

Jascha Kessler

Subject: Ganef in Charles Dickens and a South African Jewish Periodical

Having just introduced myself, I feel no shame in writing immediately
again in regard to the correspondence about ganef which I have been
following since I joined _Mendele_ a week ago.

Perhaps those who do not already know might be interested to learn that
the word ganef, spelt 'gonoph' is listed in the Oxford English Dictionary
as 'slang, 1852', and its etymology is of course given quite correctly as
from Yiddish via Hebrew. Of further significance is the fact that the
word is used by Charles Dickens in _Bleak House_ (published 1853). In
Chapter 19, the policeman who has come to arrest the little vagrant
orphan Jo, who lives at Tom-all-Alone's, tells Mr Snagsby (who has taken
pity on the child), "He's as obstinate a young gonoph as I know. He WON'T
move on.' Now Dickens's extensive knowledge of criminal and underworld
slang, and his intimate familiarity with the workings of the London
police force of his day is well known; in the novel, the policeman who
uses this word clearly has his beat in London's East End, and from the
context in the chapter just cited,it is evident that the word is as
commonly known to and used by the policeman as those he addresses.

So there you have a piece of information which raises, for me at least,
another side issue, for which I hope others will provide an answer. Why
did Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants always seemm to settle on the
_East_ End/Side of great cities  -- compare London with Manhattan. A
bitterly ironic inversion of the mizrekhvant, perhaps? Any ideas?

I would like to let you all know that here in South Africa I am the
editor of a quarterly journal devoted to Jewish Studies entitled _Jewish
Affairs_. I would welcome essays of between 3000 and 6000 words on any
subjects relating to Yiddish Language or Literature. Unfortunately, we
cannot afford to pay for contributions, but we offer lots of yikhes.

Contributions can be sent to me at above e-mail address and I will have
them (mayne mitarbeter, nebekh, gebensht zoln zey zayn) reyped from the
mashenke. Alternatively, they can be posted to an address I will supply,
if potential contributors so prefer. I must warn, however, that the mail
system in South Africa has recently collapsed, and were it not for e-mail
I would be even more cut off from colleagues overseas than I am already.

Lost hern fun zikh vi gikh meglekh.

I well remember as a child my father's intense anger at Asch's choice
of subjects.

Subject: Shabse Tsvi

Maybe this has already been discussed, but in Yiddish the "s" from Shabse
occurs as a "sof", (I think), a tof minus dot in the middle. Then there
is the leveling of the final vowels, which is a feature of Yiddish,
usually has ay level out to e. Example: Mordkhay = Mordkhe. I imagine the
Ashkenazi whole Hebrew would be Shabsay, unless there is another vowel
between the b and the s; the Yiddish name is Shabse Tsvi. Hope this came
out clear.

Subject: translation

	To add to what Kathryn Hellerstein, Seth Wolitz, and Leah
Zazulyer have said:

	My own sense is that there's been very, very little critical
discussion of translations done from Yiddish.  As an example:  everyone
seems to love Hillel Halkin's translations of the Tevye stories, and I
too admire them a lot, but I'd like to see a less syncophantic discussion
of what Halkin has done to the original text - lots of shortenings and
clarifyings of Tevye's interminable but wonderful repetitions and nested
clauses, lots of cultural adaptation of figures of speech.  I don't
object, necessarily, to Halkin's having made these choices, but I'd like
to see them assessed more rigorously.  Another example:  the discussions
I've seen of the Harshavs' American Yiddish Poetry and of the Penguin
Anthology of Modern Yiddish Verse don't look very closely at the quality
of the particular translations.  There's a difference, I think, between,
say, John Hollander's astonishing mimicry of Moshe-Leyb Halpern and
Cynthia Ozick's radical compression of Yankev Glatshteyn, and between
both of them and Marcia Falk's sometimes brilliant, sometimes (in my
judgment) misleading and aggressively colloquial adaptations of Anna
Margolin.  And it's not that I hold dogmatically to any of these
assessments - just that I wish that the reviews I've seen of these
important translations had undertaken the job of assessment more
seriously.

Best,

Larry Rosenwald
