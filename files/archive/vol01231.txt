>Joke about ham? Here is true story....

great story. and here's another, tho it's not about food.

a few years ago, the university of pennsylvania dept of
romance languages held its first Cultural Diversity
Sensitivity Training Session, complete with a professional
Cultural Diversity Sensitivity Training Session
Facilitator. and they held it on yom kippur... (of course
the jews on the faculty were too Sensitive to Cultural
Diversity to point it out.)

Subject: Bubelekh

Re: Khaim Bochner's request for a recipe for "bubelekh."
The following is my mother's. The quantities are for a
single serving.

1 egg
2 teaspoons matzo mehl (kemakh matza)
1 teaspoon of cognac or a sweet liqueur
powdered or regular sugar

Beat the egg-white till firm. Add yolk. Mix with flour and
cognac. Heat oil in a small skillet. Fry (covered) over a
very low heat on both sides. (It is supposed to come out
fluffy.) Sprinkle with sugar. Serve hot.

As with many childhood memories, "bubelekh" are also
overrated. I also remembered a taste of "gan eden." The
result is no more than OK.

Best wishes,

Mina Graur

Subject: review

In Mendele 1.222 someone (Noyekh ?) suggested we submit
reviews of recemt works on Yiddish.  Harshav's MEANING OF
YIDDISH was mentioned.  I have just submitted a review of
that book to MODERN PHILOLOGY (Chicago). If the editors of
MENDELE are interested, I will try to send it along.

To Vicki Fromkin: Great story about your father. If you
don't mind, I'm going to pass it on to a friend who's doing
a piece on Chagall for the Guggenheim in connection with a
show of his newly discovered murals for the Moscow Yiddish
Art Theater (in September).

Seymour Axelrod: Here goes

"Shteyt oyf/uf ir ale, ver vi shklafn
in hunger lebn muz, un noyt
der gayst, er ruft un vekt tsum vafn
in shlakht undz firn iz er greyt.
Di velt fun gvaldtatn un laydn
tseshterrn veln mir un dan
fun frayhayt, glaykhayt a gan-eydn
bashafn vet der arbetsman;
un dos vet zayn shoyn der letster
un antshjetydener shtrayt; mit dem internatsyonal

Subject: Introduction/bobelekh

I was born in NYC in 1956 and heard some Yiddish at home
and some in Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim on the West Side of
Manhattan. My Yiddish is idiomatic but grammatically
shvach, very Poilish, and heavy on Gemorrah Lashon. I'm a
mathematician at Bar-Ilan University currently on
sabbatical at Cornell.

Several mendelers expressed interest in bobelekh. As a
first offering I give you my mother's recipe for bobelekh:

1.separate 6 eggs
2.beat whites until stiff
3.mix yolks with pinch salt + 2 TBP sugar + 4TBP ground walnut or
almond (can also be done using matza meal;khasidim dont cook with
matza meal on pesach but litvaks do)
4.FOLD yolks into whites (my mother says it is critical to fold, not
mix; i certaintly don't know the difference)
5.heat oil in frying pan (oil should be approx. 1/2 inch deep)
6.pour in mixture and fry on very low flame
7.when bottom is firm, flip

Ess gezunteheit!
