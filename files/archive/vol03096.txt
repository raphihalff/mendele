Subject: Boiberik and Anatevka

As a follow-up to my posting concerning Yehupets, I would like to
bring to the attention of fellow MENDELnikes an article that appears
in the Aug. 27th issue of the (Yiddish, for a change) "Forverts":
"Keyn Boyberik un Anatevka vo s'hot gevoynt Tuvye der milkhiker..."
[To Boiberik and Anatevka, where Tuvye (i.e. Tevye) der milkhiker
lived]  (n.b.  Boyberik is the translitera- tion a la YIVO, and
Boiberik is how one often sees it spelled in English).

It's a travelogue written by Dr. Khariton Berman of Bilatserkiv
(Belaya Tserkov = Sadeh Lavan), who recently visited the Ukrainian
dacha resort of Boyarka and the nearby village of Antonovka, where
the prototype for Sholem Aleichem's character Tevye is supposed to
have plied his trade and resided (respectively) together with his
wife Golda and their seven daughters.

In Antonovka, Dr. Berman, accompanied by his son, daughter-in-law
and his two grandsons, met some elderly peasants who claimed to
remember Tevel (other accounts confirm the existence of a milkman in
Boyarka by that name) and his family.  It appears that the Bermans
were not the first to undertake such a pilgrimage, because the
locals in Boyarka the memory of Sholem Aleichem has been preserved,
and they continue to collect memorabilia relating to him and to his
literary protagonists.

At one point in their travels, their guide, a Ukrainian named Andrei
Ivanovich Melnichuk, declares, "You've been talking the entire time
about Tevel and his daughters -- and you've even looked for his
cow's stall.  Why don't you ask about Golda, Tevel's wife?  My
mother told me that she was a 'golden woman.'  The entire village
used to go to her for advice.  She would help everyone and she also
was a healer.  She was our best doctor, with her herbal remedies,
which she collected in the forest..."

Even as one wonders about the reliability of these secondhand
reminiscences, it is fascinating, 100 years later, to read about the
impact that a literary persona has had on a couple of small
villages.  Note, too, the correspondence between Boyarka and
Boiberik (notwithstanding the existence of the Galician toponym
Bobrka -- Boyberke in Yiddish) and between Antonovka and Anatevka.

Subject: Wolcza Dulna or Dulna Wolcza

To Zev Kesselman:

   I cannot find Wolcza Dulna (or the reverse) in the book Shetl
Finder by Chester G. Cohen (Bowie, MD: Heritage Books, 1989). A
better book, which I do not have, is Where Once We Walked: A Guide
to the Jewish Communities Destroyed in the Holocaust by Gary
Mokatoff and Sallyann Amdur Sack (Teaneck, NJ,Avotaynu,Inc., 1991).A
local Jewish genealogical society should have a copy.

   The 1992 edition of the Times Atlas of the World does not list
the town for any country today.

   I am posting the information here, as well as in a private
message to you, because these books may be of interest to other
people on Mendele.

yiddish. a couple of people translated some of it for me, but there
is one word they don't know which is the title of the poem and used
as a refrain. this is 'sluschei'. the poem was written in chust,
chekoslovakia in 1932. does anyone know what this word means?
thanks.
