Subject: Af tselOkhes

Michael Shimshoni asks about _af tselOkhes_:

Try it this way: _af tsu_ 'in order to' _lehakhIs_ 'to anger' from
Hebrew, based on the same root as _kA-as_.

Michael Shimshoni asks (Mendele 5.038) for the origin and usage
of "af tselokhes," an extremely versatile Yiddish phrase.

By spelling it out (af tsu lehakhis),  the origins of the three-word
phrase are clear.  The first two words are germanic, "af tsu," or "in
order to." The zinger word is from Hebrew: "lehakh'is" is the infinitive
of the "hif'il" (usually causative) conjugation of the root
kaf-ayin-samekh, meaning "to anger," or "to make angry."  (The three root
letters also make up the shared Hebrew/Yiddish noun "kas," meaning anger
or wrath.) Thus, the phrase means literally: "in order to anger
[someone]."  Its use is similar to the English expression "just for
spite," or "just to be contrary."

If you tell your teenager that his hair is too long, he may shave it all
off, af tselokhes.  When I was young, many non-observant Jews I knew made
a point of playing basketball, or eating out in a restaurant, on Yom
Kippur, af tselokhes, i.e., to show their disregard for both the fast and
the fasters.  A Yiddish song (don't know the name, origin or author)
defiantly cries out: "af tselokhes ale sonim, am yisroyel khay" -- i.e.,
Jews should live and enjoy life, to hell with those who want to destroy
us.

I believe that at the first graduating ceremony of the Reform Rabbinical
Seminary in the US, in the early part of this century (?),  they
symbolically served shrimp at their luncheon, af tselokhes, to show their
contempt (indifference is too gentle a term here) for the traditional
dietary laws. (I don't mean to reignite ancient wars here; the Reform
movement has come a long way since then, in my opinion, toward reaching
out to other Jewish movements -- but this is not the place for that
discussion.)

Although af tselohkes is somewhat used in modern Hebrew today, it also
has a fully-Hebrew first cousin which I believe I have heard creeping
into Yiddish spoken in Israel, namely "davka."  "Davka" is less negative
than af tselokhes, and is generally considered untranslatable, but
roughly means: "just because," "just my luck," or "because I wanted to."
There is a tinge of orneriness in davka, but never as deliberately
spiteful as af tselokhes.  "I arrived on time for the train, which always
comes late, but davka today the train left early."

Subject: Af tzelokhes

I'm a little surprised that Michael, as our resident expert on Hebrew,
was the one to ask this question.

'lokhes' is the Hebrew 'lehakh`is', to make angry.  To do something 'af
ts'lokhes' is to do it for spite, in the full knowledge that it will make
the other person angry.  The interesting question, for which I do not
have an answer is "Why 'af tsu'?"

B'sholem,

Subject: af tzelokhes

I think "af tzelokhes" might mean "for spite" or even something like
"just for the hell of it."  My uncle used to sing this little ditty
(among others that I'll feed to Mendele slowly lest I get stoned):

Ikhl, pikhl af tzelokhes
mi nemt der tzalem
und shtekt im in tukhes
ya ba ba ba, boi, boi, etc.

There's not quite enough context to get the meaning clearly, but it's a
start.

Subject: Af tselokhes

Michael Shimshoni of Israel asks about the meaning and origin of
"aftsulokhes".  He may be surprised to learn that the Yiddish expression
comes straight from Hebrew.  *L'hakh'is* (lamed-hey-khof-ayin-yud-samekh)
means "out of spite" in Hebrew (literally, "to enrage"), and this is
exactly what it means in Yiddish, with a couple of redundant
prepositions--*af* and *tsu--jammed onto the front of the word just to
press the point home.

The Yiddish expression "af tzelokhes" is equivalent to the English "for
spite". Er hot es im geton oif tzelokhes = He did it to him for spite.

I also recall my folks calling a spiteful person a tzelokhesnik.

Subject: Af tsu lehakhes

When spoken, or spelled phonetically -- af (or af tsu) tselokhes -- the
embedded etymon of lehakhes (or lehokhes) remains invisible.  However, in
writing, when the word is spelled lamed, hey, khof, ayen, yud, samekh, it
becomes evident that the root word is the Hebrew ka'as (anger), spelled
kof, ayen, samekh.

Lehakhes (or lehokhes) is thus a Hebrew component of Yiddish, a verb
meaning in both H & Y to cause someone to become angry, to arouse his
anger, to "anger" him in a transitive sense.

As a rule the expression refers to _two_ parties.  For instance, "af tsu
lehakhes mayne so'nim" (in spite of, or to spite, my enemies) the
lehakhes refers to one's opponents, to those who wish the speaker ill,
but there is also an unarticulated reference to oneself.  Thus, while the
literal meaning of "lehakhes" is negative,  as Shimshoni stated, the
entirety of the expression, its construction, carries as well a positive
message, since it also conveys, while unuttered, hope and bito'khn
(confidence) that the speaker will succeed no matter what obstacles lie
ahead or will be placed in his path.

I imagine, for instance, that at the moment of the foundation of the
State of Israel someone might have said with the deepest of hopes,
heart-throbbing pride, and unshakable providential bito'khn that Israel
will grow and prosper "af tsu lehakhes its many enemies," as indeed it
did.

Subject: Af tselokhes

Michael Shimshoni, in Israel, asks about the meaning of "af tzelokhes".
Isn't it wonderful how a Hebrew word can become so unrecognizable in
Yiddish that an Israeli knowledgeable in Yiddish can't figure it out?
Here's my understanding of the expression...

L'hach'is, in Hebrew, is the hiph'il form of ka'as, "anger".

The hiph'il form of a verb means "to cause to...", so tzelokhes is
something done in spite, or as a deliberate attempt to make someone else
angry. A tzelokhesdiker is someone who is always stirring up trouble. In
some contexts, af tzelokhes can mean "on purpose", as opposed to "by
accident", but only when the purpose involves deliberately
annoying/upsetting someone else.
