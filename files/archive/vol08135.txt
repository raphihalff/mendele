Subject: Stempenju

Dear Mendelyaner,

a short question for a French friend who has no email: does anyone know of a
French translation of Aleichem's novel Stempenju? 

Thanks,

Subject: indefinite article

My family is from about 15 miles SE of Bobruysk, Belarus (formerly in
Minsker gubernye, now I understand within the Mogilev area). The indefinite
articles "a" & "an" were used in their Yiddish but they sometimes in certain
cases would also say "ayn" like the German word 'ein' (I am not talking
about the verbal particle "ayn" as in the verbs "aynpakn", "aynshparn zikh",
etc.). My uncle wrote me in a letter "Du host dokh AYN altn feter" & this is
not just 'shraybloshn' because I remember him speaking this way. My great
grandmother is on tape singing "... mir shikn im ale AYN geris" ("ayn geris"
instead of "a grus"). 
  
Does anyone else know of this & know when "ayn" would be used instead of
"an"? Is this a local dialecticalism or is it typical of Raysish or more
broadly Litvish Jews? 
  
aykh alemen a dank,
Mikhoyel Basherives

Subject: Israel Zangwill

My name is Linda Conti: I am an italian student and as the day of my degree
is getting nearer, I decided to look for the subject of my thesis. 

The main subject should be british literature, but my interests have
recently shifted to yiddish and hebrew, so my aim is to try and put the
three things together. 
 
Unfortunately, I'm not able to find british authors who have been writing in
both languages. The only name I could find is Israel Zangwill (London, 1864
- Midhurst, 1927). 

I am looking, therefor, for his books in english, what seems to be a really
difficult search (at list here in italy): is there anyone who can give me
advices on how to find informations and books about I. Zangwill, or any
other british-born yiddish writer? 

I am looking forward to any advice

Thanks in advance
Linda Conti

Subject: Norman Salsitz's "Against All Odds"

Tayere mendelyaner

I was fascinated to read about the film made in Poland in 1929 - How
possible is it that this film could be made available for showing in
England?  Who is the publisher of Norman Salsitz's book, how much is it, and
is it available in England? Is Norman Salsitz coming to England, in fact, to
launch his book?

Subject: raising children before 19th century

I am looking for information about the way in which Jewish children were
raised in the premodern (before 19th century) period.  In particular, I
would both like to know about contemporary documents (in Hebrew, Yiddish,
Ladino, or one of the many goyish languages), and about modern studies or
reports on some of the following points:

1. Birthing methods.
2. Use of midwives.
3. Breast feeding by mothers or wet nurses.
4. Where babies slept-in the same room or bed with parents?
5. Time of weaning.
6. Swaddling methods.
7. Hygiene routines.
8. Gender difference in feeding, clothing, and care up to 3 or 4 years old.
9. Post-brit care.
10.Toilet training.
11.Punishment and discipline of toddlers.
12.Feeding habits.

Thanks for your help.

Subject: poem for a Bar Mitzva

Can you help me? I'm looking for a Yiddish poem to read at my son's Bar
Mitzvah? The topic could be prayer, study, God, faith, holiness, Shabbat,
community, nature, childen, family, peace, Israel, exodus, life cycle,
Torah.  Any ideas? Maybe a Yiddish song.  If you can send me some things,
great. If not, just some direction. Thanks.

Subject: Yiddish poetry on the radio

Tayere Mendelyaner,
I have some  truly odd radio broadcasts from 1940 of modern Yiddish poetry
read by Victor Packer. The titles are "Banen", "Subway" and a translation of
Rudyard Kipling's "Boots" ("Shikh"). Does anyone know who might have
translated these and where, if anywhere, they might have been published?

Subject: Mrs. Harrison's problems have only just begun

Iosif Vaisman comments (08.131):

"A trip to the library or a note to Mendele could have saved years and years
of agony." 

Being called _batamt_ by her father and now understanding the word may yet
cause Mrs. Harrison many many years of agony.
