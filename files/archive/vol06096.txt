Subject: Vi zogt men Yidisn in Velsh?

First, they should be aware of the fact that there's a variety of Middle
High German that was spoken by Jews in the Middle Ages and that many
consider distinct from Old Yiddish and that this variety is called
'Judeo-German'.

Second, why don't they do the simple (not to mention p.c.) thing and ask
some Welsh Jews what they call it? In case they don't know of any, my
handy-dandy Jewish Travel Guide (Jewish Chronicle - London) lists a
number of synagogues and other institutions. No listing for Aberystwyth,
but here are some likely prospects in Cardiff:

	Cardiff United Synagogue (Orthodox), Brandreth Rd.,
	Penylan, CF2 5XX. Sec.: Mrs. S.C. Glavin.
	Tel. 0222 473728.

	Mikva, Wales Empire Pool Bldg, Wood St., CF1 1PP.
	Tel. 0222 382296.

	Cardiff Jewish Representative Council. Sec. Mrs. M. Cantor,
	6 Hollybush Rd., Cyncoed CF2 6TA. Tel. 0222 756217.

	Home for the Aged. Penylan House. Penlyan Rd., CF2 5YG.
	Tel. 0222 485327.

	Jewish Board of Guardians. Hon. Sec.: Mrs. A. Schwartz,
	5 Woodvale Av., Cyncoed, CF2 6SP. Tel. 0222 753361.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Vi zogt men Yidish in Velsh?

In the languages of countries where the majority of Yiddish speakers
once lived Yiddish is known as Jewish language (_evreiskii iazyk_ in
Russian, _evreis'ka mova_ in Ukrainian, _jezyk zydowski_ in Polish).
Word "Yiddish" exists in these languages (idish, idysh, and jidysz) but
is used sparingly. So, Welsh may do well with its current _iddeweg_.

For the discussion on name for Yiddish in other languages and on use of
"Jewish language" in English see Mendele 3.245:3, 3.247:4, 3.249:1-2,
3.250:3, 3.251:1-2, 3.254:1.

Subject: Dem tatn's rufnomen

With reference to Bernard S. Greenberg's comment (6.095,4) about his
father's rufnomen (first name) that was, for a long time, Boomie (from
Vroomie, Avrohom):

My speculation is that "Boomie" very likely came about when a younger
child in the family, referring to the older one called "Vroomie," could
not pronounce the conjoined consonants /Vr/ and, instead, used the much
easier and  developmentally earlier /B/, thus Boomie.

It is also possibe that, for the same reasons stated above, the child
_himself_, in his pre-egocentric "I" stage when he refers to himself in
the third person by name -- as he is called in the family -- spoke of
himself as Boomie.  ["Boomie wants milk."]

I remember a family in old Vilne, with six children.  The oldest
daughter was called Freydke, diminutive of Freyde.  When the youngest
child, in the initial phases of her speech, could not pronounce Freydke,
due to her inability to "bridge" the consonantal /Fr-/ sound, she called
the oldest one "Kheytke" instead.  Note also the shift from /d/ in
Freydke to /t/ in Kheytke

Everyone in the family found it cute, and, in turn, all the family
members also started to use the name Kheytke, instead of Freydke.

The mispronounced name thus became enshrined, so to speak, in the
family's nomenclature, as a kind of unexpected "deference" to the
mizinke's [youngest] baby talk.

Thus, a _rufnomen_ is not infrequently changed in strange ways that only
phoneticians can explain.

Subject: The song "Arayn un Aroys"

The Jewish Film Festival in Melbourne tonight showed a French/Yiddish
Film called Madame Jaques sur La Croisette, which contained a wonderful,
slightly risque song "Arayn un Aroys" sung by Dave Cash and I think
released by "Osi Disque". No one that I have spoken to here knows the
song, singer or record company and they are probably not available here.
Could anyone provide me with the words and/or the music? By the way,
the film is sensationally realistic and funny and should be seen!

Subject: Thanks

On the part of all the people in our Bialik Yiddish class, I would like
to thank all the members of the mendele group that have responded to our
letter. We have gotten more than enough responces, and are very happy
about the results.

Thank you again.

Subject: Book-review and recommendations

To those good friends who expressed interest in  life in the Warsaw
ghetto, I would recommend _In the Days of Destruction and Revolt_ by Zivia
Lubetkin who survived the destruction of the ghetto and incredible as it
seems  actually was able to reach Israel where she lectured and wrote
her book .  Many episodes will be familiar but it is a book you will not
want to put down until you have completed it.

From the Central Conference of American Rabbis (192 Lexington Ave,New
York, N.Y. 10016-6823)  you can receive a small catalog of wonderful
children's books, send for them today....chanukah is coming.   And
finally, several mendelayers have asked about favorite or interesting
curses and my best source is _In Praise of Yiddish_ by Maurice
Samuel.  I refer to this gem of a book frequestly, and so will you!

Mit gezundt un guten leyenen,

Subject: Viazoy shraybt men "khanuke"?

Gevald! Ratevet! It's that time of year again. M'harget zikh shoyn nokh
amol in mayn vinkl un oykh ikh mit mayn vegn dem oysleg fun khanuke.

Freg ikh:

1. If YIVO distributed a khanuke card, how would it be spelled?
2. Would the spelling be the same for an all English word card (I wish
you a happy khanuke {Webster has it Chanukah, also Hanukkah}) and for a
Yiddish transliterated card (Ikh vintsh aykh a freylekhn...).
3. Other than the sound equivalents listed on p xxi in Weinreich, where
do I find the YIVO rules for transliteration?

Are names transliterated? For example: I see Sholem Aleichem, not Sholem
Aleykhem in scholarly works. Mikhl Herzog on Mendele wrote Hasid, not
khosid. Chana Mlotek does not write her name as Khana.
