Subject: toplpunkt 

A short note in 10.043 about new Yiddish journal generated significant
interest: I received more than 20 requests on how to subscribe, more than
150 mendelyaner looked up the page with the contents of the first issue
(http://www.ibiblio.org/yiddish/Toplpunkt)

About the subscription: Toplpunkt extends a special offer to Mendele
subscribers, 26 US dollars for 5 issues (all four 2001 issues, plus one
2000 issue). Checks should be made to the "Instants far yidishe kultur"
and mailed to Toplpunkt, Brener 14, Tel Aviv 63826, Israel. This
subscription price is the same for Europe and Americas, but I don't know
if they accept currencies, other than USD.  Single copies are available
for $10, regular annual subscription price in Israel is NIS120.

Subject: On-line Yiddish course

The Dora Teitelbaum Institute in collaboration with the Florida
International University is offering for the first time ever a distance
learning course for Yiddish.  The course began on Jan.8, and at present
has 43 students registered, over half of whom are taking it on-line.  The
other 19 students are taking it on campus.  For further information about
registering for the course, contact Liz Weintraub at
Liz@yiddishculture.org.

This is a very important breakthrough in the ability to get Yiddish
language education to the many students who do not live near a school
which offers Yiddish courses.

Subject: ver veys eyns?

I turn to all the resource people we have on our Mendele list for help. I
need dates and numbers (the new math accepts and recognizes approximations
or educated guesses) for a lecture on the blossoming health and recovery
of Yiddish today. An answer or an educated guess to any question, or part
of one also will be appreciated.

Nokh a bisl, nokh a bisl makht a fule shisl.

 1. When was the YIVO standardized transliteration/romanization system
 created and how was it publicized?

 2. How many Yiddish speakers do we claim in the United States? in the
 world?

 3. How many colleges are teaching Yiddish? have a Yiddish chair?

 4. How many Yiddish periodicals exist world-wide? Name the ones you know
 (to compile a list [i.e. Grine Medine (Holland); Tam Tam (France) Oyfn
 Shvel(U.S.A)).

 5. How many organizations working for Yiddish expansion (i.e. Arbeter
 Ring) exist?

 6. How many Yiddish Theatres exist? Where?

 7. What music (beyond klezmer) is being created?

Subject: Proposed Yiddish and Hebrew lit. AJS panel

Reposted from H-Judaic

  From: Dara Horn Schulman <horn@fas.harvard.edu>
  Subject: Yiddish and Hebrew lit. AJS panel

 I would like to propose a panel for next year's AJS conference (December
 16-18, 2001 in Washington, DC) on the topic of authors who wrote in both
 Hebrew and Yiddish, focusing on a comparison of their Hebrew and Yiddish
 literary works. Many authors of the 19th and early 20th centuries wrote 
 in both languages, and while some (like Abramovitsh) are well-known for 
 their work in both languages, most are better-known for one or the 
 other, and I think it would be interesting to examine changes in their 
 work from one language to the next. (I have examined this issue with 
 some of Agnon's Yiddish work.)

 This topic was raised at the (sparsely attended) Yiddish section meeting
 at the last AJS conference and met with no objections. Proposals are not
 due until March 19th, but I would like to find out if others have 
 researched this topic and would be willing to present on it, or to 
 otherwise help in organizing such a panel. Please contact me off-list at
 horn@fas.harvard.edu.

Sheva Tsuker

I.B. Singer mentions in his memoirs that as a teenager he used to read 
detective stories of Max Shpitskop in the Yiddish press. Does anyone know in 
which newspaper these were published, and when? Were they also published in 
book form? Who is the author? Were these stories originally written in 
Yiddish or are theyn translated from German (or some other language)? Are you 
familiar with any other Yiddish detective stories for children/teenagers? Any 
information will be appreciate. Yours, 

Sheva Zucker

Subject: Yiddish publishing in Eastern Europe

If you were in NYC, I'd suggest you visit the YIVO library. Perhaps the UC
library on the West coast, can be of some help. If not, there are Mendele
subscribers in the LA and SF areas whose private libraries may contain
materials that would help:

 1. Something on the Vilna publisher (and family Rom).
 2. Max Weinreich's _Di shvarste pintelekh_, published by YIVO in Vilna,
 1939, pp. 196ff., under the heading _men heybt on drukn yidish_. 
 3. I don't have the precise sources at hand, but I seem to recall that
 the late Chone Shmeruk (Jerusalem), and Chava Turnianski of Jerusalem
 have both published on the subject.

Subject: Yiddish publishing in Eastern Europe

David Shneer asked about references on history of Yiddish publishing in
Eastern Europe [10.044]. For several years I have been collecting data on
number of Yiddish books that were ever published (surprisingly there are
very few works on the topic in the literature, especially concerning the
second half of the last century. I was not able to find answer to a
seemingly simple question: how many books in Yiddish were published?
Estimates range from 30,000 to 50,000). Since it is unlikely that my study
will be finished before I'll retire from my day job (which according to
the US Social Security Administration will not happen until 2029), I
decided to post some raw data. Mendelyaner with allergy to numbers need
not read further. Others will find in these simple tables a fairly precise
snapshot of Yiddish cultural history. All the peaks and valleys in the
number of published books reflect well known historical events. Often very
sad ones.

Ironically, the best statistics on Yiddish publishing comes from the
Soviet Union. With centralized planned economy and pervasive control over
every single printed word, all the books were accounted for. Altogether,
more than 30 million copies of 7,348 titles in Yiddish were printed in the
USSR in 1917-1991 (these are only books, i.e. according to the
classification used for the most of the period "non-serial publications
with more than 45 pages". For example, monthly literary supplements to
"Sovetish Heymland" that were published in 1970ies and 80ies, and would
have been considered books by most bibliographers, are not counted here).

The first column is the number of books in Yiddish (including translations
from other languages), second column - total print run, third - number of
books in other languages, translated from Yiddish, fourth - total print
run of translations. All data for the books published within the then
current borders of the USSR (1922 USSR borders for the years 1917-1921).

End of story... I am not aware of any Yiddish books published in Russia
after 1992 (several books published by the Moscow Jewish University and
few other publishers contain some transliterated Yiddish). Several books
in Yiddish were also published after 1992 in other post-Soviet states:
Ukraine, Moldova, Lithuania.

*) conservative estimate

**) almost all of these books were published in 1946-1949, very few in
1950-1956. L.Hirszowicz lists 112 titles in 1947, and 117 in 1948, those
probably include non-book materials.

The total number of Yiddish titles for 75 years (7,349) does not seem
large if compared with the number of Yiddish and Hebrew titles combined
published in Russia in eight years before the World War I (6,300). On the
other hand, the latter number included production from Poland and
Lithuania, and Hebrew books were totally banned for the most part of
Soviet history. Some other parts of the Soviet record in promoting Yiddish
culture are more impressive, for example the number and popularity of
translations from Yiddish into other languages. For the years 1918-1949,
the champions were: Sholem Aleikhem in number of editions (486, 5.3 mln
copies, 15 languages) and Leyb Kvitko in number of copies (149 editions,
8.9 mln copies, 34 languages).

The circulation of Sovetish Heymland during its existence (1961-1991) was
a monotonously decreasing function:

1961    25,000
1966    16,000
1971    10,000
1977     9,000
1978     7,000
1985     5,000

For the comparison, several numbers from seven important centers of
Yiddish publishing in Eastern Europe for 1901-1940.  While the tables
above are fairly reliable, the following numbers are rough conservative
estimates, and might be far off in some cases. But again, they give an
idea about dynamics of the process.

                Varsha  Vilna   Kiev    Minsk   Kharkov Berlin  Lemberg
1901-1910        600     300              30              10      50
1911-1920        700     400     60               10      50      20
1921-1930       1500    1000    300      150     150     300      20
1931-1940        800     600    400      300     300      20      10

Of these seven cities, only Warsaw had regular Yiddish publishing after
the hurbn. In the years 1945-1961, 265 Yiddish books (total run 1.3 mln)
were printed in Poland.

The latest Yiddish book that came from Eastern Europe is quite symbolic:

Imre Madach, Di tragedye funem mentshn. Balassagyarmat : Madach Irodalmi
Tarsasag, 2000. ISBN 9638599111 (fun ungerish ibergezetst Yosef Holder,
1893-1944).

It is a Yiddish translation of one of the masterpieces of classical
Hungarian literature, "The Tragedy of Man" ("Az ember tragediaja"),
written in 1861. The poetic drama in 15 acts follows the main characters'
(Adam and Eve) destiny from creation through the known history into a
communist future, and ultimately to the extinction of human race. However,
the protagonists are redeemed in their struggle with the forces of
darkness, by the fact that they did all they could to achieve a different
outcome...
