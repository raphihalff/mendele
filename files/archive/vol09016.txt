Subject: Sholem-Aleykhem un Tsharli Tshaplin

In 9.013, 2, Larry Rosenwald asks about Sholem-Aleykhem and Charlie Chaplin,
and Sholem-Aleykhem's appreciation of silent films.  I may be able to add
some relevant information. 

They are my two favorite geniuses because they were both so sensitive to the
tragic ironies of the human condition, and yet, no matter how deep the sad
possibilities, they each often found the humor, even joyous laughter, that
trumped the pain.  Sholem-Aleykhem seems to have understood the unique
Chaplin gift although he never saw Chaplin's greatest masterpieces.
Sholem-Aleykhem came to New York at the end of 1914 and died May 13, 1916. 
He had the opportunity to see all of Chaplin's knockabout films for Keystone
(1914) and Essanay (1915).  Chaplin's "The Tramp" was released in April
1915, and is acknowledged as the first blending by Chaplin of sadness and
laughter.  Sholem-Aleykhem died the day before the first of Chaplin's Mutual
Films (1916-17) was released. 

There is an interesting book in Yiddish about Charlie Chaplin (Di Velt fun
Tsharli Tshaplin, fun David Matis, New York: Yidisher Kultur Farband [YKUF],
1959.  Kapitl zayen is entitled "Sholem-Aleykhem un Tsharli Tshaplin."  The
first two subheadings are 1) Sholem-Aleykhem redt zikh arop fun hartsn vegn
Tshaplinen; and 2) Menakhem-Mendl, Tevye, Motl un Tshaplins Kleyn Mentshele. 

In one of my 1996 Sholem-Aleykhem articles for Fishl Kutner's "Der Bay" I
wrote:

The striking visual imagination of the master is readily apparent.  Scenes
leap from page to the mind's eye.  He must have found writing scenarios very
much his cup of tea.  In Baym Kenig Akhashveres the boy narrator must sit at
the Purim feast, not with his playmates, but with his Reb Itsi, his tutor. 
Or as the boy calls him, his governess, his Angel of Death.  When Reb Itsi
yanks his kerchief from his vest pocket, bits of tobacco fly all over, and
into the boy's soup.  Or this: Tevye stops to pray in the woods [Dos Groyse
Gevins], heart heavy, no food to bring home.  It's time for minkhe and he
wants to stand for shimenesre in silence, but his horse bolts.  His search
for relief from gloomy thoughts in silent, fervent prayer is abruptly
suspended.  Holding on to the reins for dear life, Tevye yells prayers, not
standing, as is proper, but running.  Only in movies could that be rendered,
impossible on a stage.  Further, language was no barrier in silent movies. 
Chaplin, for example, was immediately understood everywhere. 

Sholem Aleichem seems to have perceived in Chaplin a human touch analogous
to his own.  This was during Chaplin's early knockabout slapstick period. 
An anecdote related by a young admirer has Sholem Aleichem defending Chaplin
against the kind of condescending pedantry adopted by self-important critics
of the day.  [Der Tog, NewYork, Apr. 2, 1939. See also allusions to
attending Chaplin movies in Dos Sholem-Aleykhem Bukh, p. 360; and Motl Peysi
dem Khazns, Tsveyter Teyl, chapter XVI.]

Some letters by Sholem Aleichem add important details about film plans.  On
Dec. 19, 1913 [New Style], Sholem Aleichem wrote from Lausanne to a Mr. 
Vorkl, apparently a go-between.  It was a progress report about his
scenarios. "....The first [of two] is entitled 'Tevye.' It goes without
saying that I include only the first of the Tevye stories, 'Dos Groyse
Gevins.' However, it is rich in new, quite new, very comical scenes [50
scenes].  And there are also fantastic scenes of which there is no trace in
my original yarn. Everything is cinematographically organized. You and the
whole world will enjoy.  The second is entitled: 'Khave, Tevye's Daughter.'
This also contains many new imaginative scenes and settings.  The first
scenario is mainly in a humorous vein, the second touches the deepest of
feelings.  Let your 'German' [presumably the financier] choose one.  Maybe
both?  Does your 'German' understand that he is buying things that have a
ready-made public, many tens, hundreds of thousands of devotees among you
and in America?  I'm still awaiting your answer to earlier letters.  Perhaps
you will send an accounting of these matters by telegram.  Naturally, if we
get to do business, you will also make money.  You are not obligated to work
for me for nothing.  Time is money [Hebrew characters, taym iz moni], says
Yankl ganef in Ameritshke.  Write, write, and don't sleep through the
slikhes [Prayers for forgiveness]!  Your Sholem Aleichem." 

On Dec. 21, 1913, he wrote Vorkl about scripting scenarios of Motl Peysi dem
Khazns, Der Farkishefter Shnayder, and Stempenyu.  Eight months later the
outbreak of World War I destroyed all such plans.  Sholem Aleichem died May
13, 1916, before such promising seeds could be sown in the new,
cinematically fertile American ground. 

If only Chaplin could have read Yiddish!

IN LOVE AND IN STRUGGLE:  THE MUSICAL LEGACY OF THE JEWISH LABOR BUND

The YIVO Institute for Jewish Research announces the release of a new
recording entitled "In Love and In Struggle:  The Musical Legacy of the
Jewish Labor Bund", featuring new performances (in Yiddish and English) by
The New Yiddish Chorale and the Workmen's Circle Chorus, both conducted by
Zalmen Mlotek, a leading figure in Yiddish folk, theatre, and choral music.
The recording also features solo performances by Adrienne Cooper and Dan
Rous.

"In Love and In Struggle" celebrates the vast Jewish labor song repertoire
that developed in Yiddish from 1880-1945 in Eastern Europe and the United
States.  Available in CD and cassette, the recording features over sixty
voices of all ages and backgrounds (including a children's chorus) singing
about working people, strikes, freedom and justice, in selections ranging
from rousing protest songs to lyrical songs of hope. 

The recording was inspired by a sold-out concert in January, 1998 at the
Cooper Union in New York City, in honor of the 100th anniversary of the
Jewish Labor Bund, the socialist party and cultural organization founded in
Vilna (Eastern Europe) in 1897 and still functioning today.  The songs on
the CD come from the Bundist repertoire and from other branches of the
Jewish labor movement. 

The New Yiddish Chorale was founded in 1995 by Zalmen Mlotek to perform and
record musically rich arrangments of traditional Yiddish songs, major works
of the past written for chorus in Yiddish by major composers, and works of
Yiddish poets as texts for new choral compositions.  The Workmen's Circle
Chorus was founded in 1915 and been under the direction of Zalmen Mlotek
since 1980.  Since its inception it has sung music which reflects the lives
of Eastern European immigrants fighting for better working conditions,
social justice, and a better quality of life.  

"In Love and In Struggle" is available for sale through YIVO. The CD and
cassette are each accompanied by a beautifully designed and illustrated 32
page booklet with lyrics in Yiddish and English translation, notes, and
reflections on radical Jewish politics.  CD:  $18, Cassette:  $12. 

For order forms or more information, contact YIVO at (212) 246-6080.

Subject: Doctor Tsemakh Shabad (book by Yulian I. Rafes)

At the request of the author, I would like to bring to subscribers'
attention the following newly published book:

*Doctor Tsemakh Shabad:  A Great Citizen of the Jewish Diaspora*, by
Yulian I. Rafes; edited by Lisa Epstein & Steven Sedlis.  Baltimore:  VIA
Press, Vestnik Information Agency, 1999.  228 p., illus.  In English. 
ISBN 1-885563-17-5

Available from the publisher for $19 (+$3 postage) -- address:  6100 Park
Heights Ave., Baltimore, MD 21215; tel. 1-410-358-0900.

Here is a bit of background on the book, in the words of Lisa Epstein,
Research Director of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research:

"Dr. Rafes' book places Dr. Shabad's medical activities in the context of
medical science of the day.  With a wealth of information hitherto
unavailable in English, it provides a detailed description of the scope of
public health efforts initiated or inspired by Dr. Shabad.

"This work is a glowing tribute to Dr. Shabad, who was so greatly revered
by the Jewish population of Eastern Europe during his lifetime.  Dr. Rafes
has poured his own passion for Jewish public health care, Jewish medical
history, and the memory of Dr. Shabad into this project.

"The name of Dr. Shabad has always been a highly revered one at YIVO.  Not
only was he one of the founders of the institution, but his daughter
Regina married the brilliant scholar Dr. Max Weinreich, who shaped YIVO's
intellectual direction for four decades, first in Vilna, then in New York.
His elder son, Uriel, Dr. Shabad's grandson, was a brilliant linguist,
also bringing scholarly leadership to YIVO.  The history of the Shabad
family and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, then, are inseparably
intertwined."

Throughout his long and distinguished career as a medical doctor and as a
cultural and political figure, Dr. Shabad personified the integrity and
intellectual distinction of his native city of Vilna, the fabled
"Jerusalem of Lithuania."

Dr. Yulian I. Rafes is the author two other recent books, also published
by VIA Press:  *The Way We Were before Our Destruction* (memoir of and
documents about the author's gymnasium classmates in Vilna; in English)
and *Paths of My Destiny* (memoir about Dr. Rafes' education and medical
career in the former Soviet Union; in Russian).

Subject: Di Mishpokhe Karnovski on stage

In his comments about I.J. Singer, Leonard Prager refers to dramatizations of 
Di Brider Ashkenazi and Yoshe Kalb, but passes over Di Mishpokhe Karnovski as 
though this was never presented on stage.  Actually, I clearly recall that it 
was presented by Maurice Schwartz in the 1940's in an "uptown" theatre in 
N.Y.  (By uptown, I mean that it wasn't downtown on 2nd Avenue, but rather in 
a theatre in the Times Square area.)   My cousin was one of a group of 
children who appeared in the play, and he used to do a teriffic imitation of 
Maurice Schwartz ( but never where Mr. Schwartz could hear him).

Subject: I. J. Singer's "A Fremder"

I was glad to see _The Mendele Review_ offering its readers I. J.  Singer's
story, "A Fremder."  I had some interesting experiences with that story,
which I thought some Mendelyaner might like to hear about. 
        
 1. I read it first about fifteen years ago, and was drawn enough to it to
translate it.  I submitted my translation to _Response_, which accepted it;
then, in doing some research for a prefatory note, I found that the story
had been translated previously by Maurice Samuel, in a collection of IJS's
stories published in 1938.  I went to look at the Samuel translation, and
found that clearly he'd translated a somewhat different text.  I gathered
that IJS had revised the story -- considerably to its advantage, in my
judgment -- between its original publication in the _Forverts_ and the book
publication in 1949. I thought that the differences between the versions,
plus some differences in manner of translation, justified a new publication;
so I wrote all this up in the prefatory note, and my translation was
published in 1986.  ("An Outsider," I. J. Singer, translated by Lawrence
Rosenwald; _Response_ XV:2 (Summer-Fall 1986), pp.  43-52).
        
 2. I'd originally shown the story to the poet and translator Reginald
Gibbons, who was then the editor of _TriQuarterly_.  His response was very
striking.  I'd told him about the story, and he'd asked to see it, but what
he said when he saw it was, "You had me expecting something like Tolstoy,
but the story just isn't that good -- it's thin and schematic."  Which led
me to wonder.  For the reasons Leonard Prager suggests in his excellent
introduction, I do think it's a fascinating story.  But I wasn't sure then,
and am not sure now, just how good it is.

Best, 
Larry Rosenwald

Subject: pedeshka?

In The Family Markowitz by Allegra Goodman, a character says: "**I** was
grouchy? I beg your pedeshka. Your father-in-law -- fine, future father-in
law -- was the grouchy one."

Is pedeshka Yiddish?  I can't find it in Weinreich. It doesn't seem to be
Russian. Polish perhaps?

From: Gevaryahu@aol.com
Subject: Hamanataschen

I have been asked to post the following question about the etymology of 
"hamanataschen" and its relationship to "Oznei Haman."

What we found so far is that the general opinion is that the German word 
"Mohn" for poppy seeds was combined with "Tasch" for pouch-pocket to form 
Mohntasch, for poppy pastry filled pocket. The similarity of sound of Mohn 
and Haman made it into hamantaschen. [e.g, Sefer Hamoadim on Purim in an 
article by Yom Tov Lewinsky (pp.153-154)]. I think that the explanation could 
be that the Hebrew definite article "Ha" was simply added to the old German 
"Mohntaschen" to create the Hamohntaschen.

In Hebrew this pastry is called "Oznei Haman" pl. or "Ozen Haman" s. Again,
it suggests that every one understood it to be some kind of pastry
symbolizing the victory over Haman. How did "tasch" became "ozen" or the
reverse? [I don't know if "Ozen Haman" came to Hebrew from Yiddish "tasch"
or the reverse] Since "ozen" is not only ear but also a utensil handle
traditionally with a hole in the middle, and since a regular punishment for
a misbehaving kid was to pull his ear ["talash ozeno"-Pesikta Rabbati 115b],
somehow these got mixed up-symbolism of punishing Haman by eating his ears.
I know that this is not a strong explanation. Even Shoshan traces the age of
the Hebrew "Ozen Haman" expression of Yemei Habenayim! (Middle ages) 

Neither Uriel Weinreich nor Alexander Harkavy deal with the etymology of the 
word.

Did the Hebrew copied it from the Yiddish or was it the reverse?

Subject: Query: Di Toyte Hasidim

I am about to publish an annotated multi-lingual bibliography on Braslav
Hasidism (including about 1,100 entries). The bibliography will be published
by Merkaz Shazar (Jerusalem) toward the end of 1999.

For this purpose I'm trying to find out the earliest printed appearance of
the term "Di Toyte Hasidim", which was definitely used by the opponents of
Braslav as a term of disgrace and as a curse. Although I have the sense that
the roots of this term trace back to the 1860s, the first printed example
known to me is in an article published in the Warsaw newspaper "Der Moment" 
from September 1928. I would appreciate any information readers may have of
earlier reference
