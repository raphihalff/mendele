Subject: Shteebl

A question is raised in Mendele 07.116 as to whether "shteebl" refers to
synagogues in general and is derived from the relative simplicity of
synagogues as compared to cathedrals, lehavdil. 

No one would ever dream of referring, for example, to New York's Temple Emanu-
el or to the Park Avenue Synagogue as a shteebl. Stained glass windows,
magnificent organs, high domes, and gorgeous furnishings are not the marks of
a shteebl. 

The word, a diminutive form of the German "Stube," is generally applied quite
literally to relatively small rooms which most often have been set aside in
someone's dwelling as a place in which folks can daven.  (You should excuse me
for using that word which has been the subject of so many megawatts of
electricity being zapped around the world.  Khaval, we can no longer talk
about gallons of ink being spilled).  There are hundreds, perhaps even
thousands of shteeblekh in the New York area.  Each shteebl usually has a
small ark with a sefer Torah or two, folding chairs or wooden benches, notices
tacked or taped to the walls, a shtender (lectern) for the shliakh tzibbur
(the one who leads the tfilos), shelves of books, and a table or two for study
and refreshments. 

A shteebl need not remain a shteebl forever.  When the Bobover Rebbe, shlita,
arrived in America after the war, he started a shteebl on West 85th Street in
Manhattan.  It perfectly fit the description I have given above.  The Rebbe,
his wife and children lived on the third floor of a brownstone building--a
house.  On the second floor were the kitchen and a dining room where the Rebbe
had his tisch and where, following dinner on Shabbes and Yom Tov, the men
danced and sang--often to the consternation of the neighbors, whose Philco TVs
bounced up and down in time with the rhythmic dancing of the khsidim.  On the
first floor was the Rebbe's shteebl, the original living room of the house,
converted into a small shul capable of holding 60 or 70 people or maybe a
hundred if they all jammed together.  Furnishings were spartan and simple. 

Today, the Bobover Yeshiva has grown into an enormous institution.  Its main
building (there are several) has a shul in which thousands of people daven and
study every day.  It has a soaring ceiling, is illuminated by arc lights and
(by day) by stained glass windows.  The furnishings, though, are still rather
simple--wooden tables and benches.  All of the walls are lined with shelves
that are filled with well-organized sforim, constituting a splendid library. 
By no stretch of the imagination can this be called a shteebl, even though it
is a thoroughly khasidik shul. 

Every American city that has any Jewish population has a shul or a temple. 
Most of these are monuments to the edifice complex which gave rise to so many
complaints in the 50s and 60s among critics of American Jewish life.  Few of
them would qualify as shteeblekh. 

There's a difference, too, between a shul and a temple, but that's a subject
for another day.

Subject: Apikorus, bronfn, widrig, shteeble

Many thanks to all of you who gave me the meaning of apikorus (or however it
is spelled). It cleared up something that was bugging me for a long time. It
encourages me to asks another question:  Many, many years ago, I read a story
by Salcia Landmann, in which she used the term "bronfn" (in a collection
called Jiddische Anekdoten). She translated it with Branntwein (brandy). Does
anybody know this word and its origin? is it in any way related to Bronfman?
or is my memory playing tricks on me? maybe it is spelled brontn? I don't have
any decent dictionary to look it up myself. 

Widrig: Joachin Neugroschel writes that "widrig" in German can mean
repulsive. This is true, of course, but I would not use in this connection.
Where I grew up (eastern Switzerland), it was commonly used to mean
opinionated, stubborn, contrary, ornery. When my mother called me widrig, I
don't think she meant that I was repulsive. It's also common to speak about
'widriger wind', 'widrige umstaende', meaning unfavourable winds or
circumstances. or widrigenfalls: in the opposite case. For repulsive, I
would use widerlich or widerwaertig. But Johannes Neugroschel is correct:
many Germans use widrig to mean repulsive; in addition, the meaning might
have changed in Yiddish. It illustrates how difficult translations can be,
even if one has a perfect knowledge of two languages.

Shteeble: could it be that this is related to Stube? My dictionary tells me
that is derived from the OHG stuba (related to stove), which originally
referred to a heated room where baths were taken (generally separated from the
house). Later (MHG), it was used to describe any heatable room (generally
within a house). Today, it simply means living room/dining room.  It can be a
room used for special occasions (e.g., special meals, to host family or
company, celebrations, etc.).  Shteeble could be the diminutive, like in
shtuebele, shtoebele, shtuebli, etc. It does have a flavour of cozyness and
warmth. But this is just a guess, I'm no linguist or etymologist.

Subject: "fonye" and dictionaries

Various subscribers have offered imaginative definitions of "fonye"--none of
which jibe even slightly with the information provided in Yiddish dictionaries
or with my experiences in reading and hearing Yiddish.  Both Harkavy and
Vainraikh define "fonye" as a (humorous) term for "Russian".  Beyond that,
I've found "fonye"  to mean a "Russian soldier--the possible meaning it has in
a macaronic Yiddish pun-jingle created during the Russo-Japanese War:  "Ya
Fonye/Yaponye."  I've never found the word "fonye" to refer to all Gentile
males or just to the tsar, as was posited respectively by two Mendelyaners,
who didn't back up their suggestion with any references.  But anything is
possible in Yiddishland, and perhaps the word had a general meaning very
locally--the way "Goy"  means "Ukrainian" in Ukrainian Yiddish. 

The eternal existential questions:  Why are so many contributors to Mendele so
obstinately unwilling to check things that could easily be checked in any
number of solid dictionaries?  Why do some Jews hate reference works?  Is it
because some English dictionaries list "jew" as a verb meaning to cheat?  i.e.
to jew someone out of money?  Why can't a person who's heard a bizarre
etymology of, say, "shtibl" look it up in the appropriate reference work?

Re Fonye: It derives from the pejorative, contemptuous distortion of the
typical Slavic peasant name Ivan.

Subject: Yiddish in the news

According to unofficial information from the well placed sources The Jewish
Agency (Sokhnut) is planning to sponsor Yiddish classes in all of their
learning centers (ulpanim) in Ukraine starting next year. If it is true, in a
few months Ukraine may have the largest Yiddish students population in the
world, with thousands of children and adults studying mameloshn. If it is
true, it means a dramatic change in Sokhnut's policy with regard to Yiddish,
and whatever is the political motivation behind this step, it is undoubtedly a
very positive development. (Sokhnut already sponsored a conference on Yiddish
education in Kiev earlier this year). 

Hopefully the Mendelistn who know more about these projects would share the
information with the rest of us.

Subject: Schildt's and Vaisman's comments

(1) Sylvia Schildt seems to be saying that the relationship of davenen to
diviner is parallel to that between bentshn and benedicere. Nothing could be
further from the truth:  the former relationship is not accepted by anyone
with competence in Yiddish linguistics (and was specifically dealt with by
Birnbaum), while the latter is undoubtedly correct and is universally accepted
by the specialists. 

(2) Dr. Schildt also refers to somebody's rule that Slavic verb stems in
Yiddish take the -e suffix, and since Standard Yiddish has davn not *davne,
argues that this shows that davenen cannot be Slavic.  There are much better
reasons for sayingt hat davenen is not Slavic (did anyone say that it is?),
but this is not one of them.  Khapn and goln zikh are two Slavic-orighin verbs
which do not take the -e suffix either. 

(3) Dr. Vaisman notes that we have not explicitly discussed the recent paper
by Herbert Guy Zeiden "Davenen: A Turkic Etymology".  I hope some day to write
a brief rebuttal, and I have alluded to it here w/o naming it.  This paper
argues that davenen comes from Qypchaq (that's one kind of Turkic) tapynmak
'to pray' (-mak is the infinitive ending).  But this is not entirely a new
idea, and Birnbaum already took care of it, pointing out that there is no
reason why the t- should become d- or -p- should become -v- AND that there is
no precedent for borrowing from Turkic into Yiddish.  I might add, having
done some work on Turkci myself, that I was a bit puzzled that a scholarly
journal would publish or that a scholar would write a paper about a Turkic
etymology w/o having any real knowledge of Turkic.  This is shown above all by
Zeiden's claim that the t- to d- problem can be solved by assuming that
Qypchaq had a form with d- as well, even though there is no evidence for this. 
Now, the reason he says this is that some OTHER words in this, and other
Turkic, languages have d- varying with t-.  But anynone who knows his Turkic
knows that there are two sets of words, those which vary like this and those
which do not. And unfortunately for Zeiden tapymak, which occurs in many
Turkic languages, always has t-.  End of story.

Subject: Y. Dobrushin and Sefardic names

1)In answer to Diane Rabson's query, in a forthcoming issue of the Tsukunft
there will be an article about Yekheskl Dobrushin, by Khayem Beyder. He
(Beyder) now lives in Brooklyn, so you might want to get in touch with him
about Dobrushin. The Tsukunft office (25 E 21 St, New York NY 10010;
212-505-8040) could probably help you with that. 

2) Sylvia Schildt shraybt agev-urkhedik, az "me gefint sefardishe nemen vi
basson, peretz un andere tzvishn ashkinazim [sic]". Khotsh Y.-L. Perets hot
take gemeynt, az er shtamt fun sfardim (un efsher iz er geven gerekht, ver

Subject: A Yiddish Radio Jingle

It would certainly be nostalgic for those of us old enough to remember the old
"Yiddishe Shtunde" on WEVD (for Eugene V. Debs) in New York to have brought
back to mind the many jingles and theme songs we heard so often. I recall only
the last lines of a ditty Molly Picon used to sing regularly when she signed
off at the end of her program: 

Horowitz Margaraten matzos 
Are the reason why,
I sing to you each Saturday night,
So Mazel Tov, good bye.

Can anybody add to this collection?
