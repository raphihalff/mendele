Re: kibitz, I know nothing about etymology, but I do know
the card playing culture of big cities and it was clear
that the kibitzer was the person who sat in the fourth
chair of every pinochle game and gave advice to the
players. There was a difference between a kibitzer and an
ordinary spectator.  The advice had to wrong.  The guy who
gave good advice was a mayvin (or consultant in Anglo
terms).  Where the word came from I do not know, but it had
a very specific meaning. To pin it down even more, the
kibitzer never took a hand. He was always "just a little
short this week."

Subject: careful! the soup is hot!

I have to admit that I have a special talent for not making
myself clear. In part the reason is that I haven't finished
my paper yet, and even when it's done, this is not the
proper format to publish it (I mean various tidbits in
brief notes). In the meantime let me try once more, this
time in all seriousness.

I am relying on two sources: a. Hirshel Revel (The
Universal Jewish Encyclopedia. v. 11, p. 511) "Though the
two terms Shlemiel and Shlimmazel are to a certain extent
similar in idea, they differ in the fact that the Shlemiel
falls victim to his own stupidity or simplemindedness,
while Shlimmazel may be purely accidental and may happen to
anyone." --- b. Dov Noy (Enc.Jud. v. 6, c. 1381) "A witty
folk-saying distinguishes between the two characters: 'A
schlemiel is a man who spills a bowl of hot soup on a
schlimazel.'"

I have no doubts, that both terms, shlemiel and
shlimmazal(nik), were used for an unlucky loser. Shlimmazal
was also used in certain areas to describe a difficult
situation, trouble. What I do not find any reference to or
source for, is the above mentioned distinction between the
two characters. Additionally, the above mentioned
folk-saying doesn't make sense to me, as I described in my
previous note (2.06) The question about the role of the
receiver of the soup refers back to the "chance" issue. Is
he just anybody, and the soup could have gone in any
direction, but this time it happened to go that way, in
which case there is nothing unique about him, or, is there
something in his personality (some metaphysical force
called luck, or lack of) that causes the soup to end up on
his suit every time. If this is the case, then it is not
anybody who happens to be there, but his personality is
causing it, therefore he has a special name.

I hope this attempt made it somewhat clearer.

What I had in mind by referring to muzzeltof, yontiff,
maymahronim vasser--  is that expressions tend to congeal
and then come into yiddish in congealed form. Already in
the Book of Esther then in Mishna we find "yom-tov" as an
expression for a festival day . But my guess is that in
Esther it means "day of fortune" --  "happy days" as the
fonz was have it. It solidifies into a fixed notion
independent of but related to its original sense
"good-day". Indeed, yom tov is then originally a day of
good portent and tov has the sense of "blessed". The Talmud
counsels that ayn mazzel b'yisrooel-- which is taken to
mean thta God and not lady luck rules Israel or that ayn--
is the name of Israel's guardian star, or that Jews have no
luck. anyways to come to end, achron achron haviv-- Mayim
acharonim-- last waters-- congeals as a concept "the
washing at the end of the meal"-- thus mayim achronim could
define vasser-- we're not asking for drinking water but
water "for end of meal washing". Likewise mazzeltof-- lucky
stars congeals to "I wish you joy and good fortune". I'm
not sure why these words and not others but it seems to me,
as I said, that latin felix -- joy or luck is the parallel.
the derivation of bronfin from brantwein rings true-- to
this day the Hebrew translation of it is yain saruf
(ya"sh)-- burned wine.--  what a bonus you ask one and two
gets answered. Anyways no use crying over spilled milk or
whining over burned wine.
