Subject: YIVO Karski Prize for 1997

1997 Karski-Nirenska Prize Awarded to Dr. Ruta Sakowska

Dr. Ruta Sakowska of the Jewish Historical Institute in Poland has been
awarded the Jan Karski and Pola Nirenska Prize for 1997. Established by
Professor Karski at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in 1992, the prize
is awarded annually to authors of published works documenting or interpreting
the contributions to Polish culture and science by Poles of Jewish origin and
Polish Jews. It bears a stipend of $5000. 
        
Dr. Sakowska is the pre-eminent historian of the Warsaw Ghetto and director of
the Ringelblum Archives of the Jewish Historical Institute, considered the
most important Holocaust archives in the world. The archives were established
by the historian Emmanuel Ringelblum and his clandestine organization Oneg
Shabat in the Warsaw Ghetto; they document every aspect of the life and death
of the ghetto as well as the fate of scores of other Polish Jewish
communities. The first volume of a planned complete academic edition of the
archives has just appeared in Poland under Dr. Sakowska's editorship. Dr.
Sakowska is also the author of "Ludzie z dzielnicy zamknietej"  (2nd rev. ed.,
Warsaw, 1993), a social history of the Warsaw Ghetto, as well as numerous
other studies. 
        
Professor Jan Karski, who endowed the prize, was the envoy of the Polish
government-in-exile during World War II who brought first-hand testimony to
the West of conditions in the Warsaw Ghetto and in German concentration camps.
The prize is also named in memory of Professor Karski's late wife, Pola
Nirenska, a well-known choreographer who lost 75 members of her family during
the Holocaust. 
        
Previous laureates have been Dr. Eugenia Prokop-Janiec for her work on
Polish-Jewish writers in interwar Poland (1993); Jerzy Ficowski, a Polish poet
and literary critic who has focused on Jewish themes, and Dr.  Michal Frydman,
translator of Yiddish literature into Polish (1994); Dr.  Marek Rostworowski
for his work on Jewish subjects in Polish painting (1995); and the Polish poet
and novelist Henryk Grynberg, whose work chronicles his own life as a child
survivor of the Holocaust (1996). 
        
The jury awarding the prize was chaired by Dr. Michael Steinlauf, senior
research fellow at YIVO, who succeeded as chairman the late Professor Lucjan
Dobroszycki. The other members of the jury were Dr. Jozef Gierowski, director
of the Research Center for Jewish History and Culture at the Jagiellonian
University in Krakow; Professor Czeslaw Milosz, 1980 Nobel laureate in
literature; Dr. Allan Nadler, director of research at YIVO; Mr. Jerzy
Turowicz, editor-in-chief of Tygodnik Powszechny, member of the Polish
Bishops' Conference Committee for Dialogue with Judaism, and vice-president of
the Society for Polish-Israeli Friendship; and Professor Feliks Tych, director
of the Jewish Historical Institute in Poland. 
        
The letter to Dr. Sakowska announcing her selection for the prize reads in
part: "Our decision reflects your lifelong dedication...to preserving and
transmitting the legacy of the Warsaw Ghetto to future generations in Poland
and throughout the world. Through the most difficult moments of postwar Polish
history, you steadfastly persevered in this commitment, defending the
archives, organizing them, and publishing numerous studies based upon
them...Now, as the multi-volume edition of the Ringelblum Archives, under your
editorship, finally appears in print, your life's work attains fulfillment.
The Karski-Nirenska Award is our way of honoring your achievement, which
amounts, after all, to the snatching of memory from oblivion." 
        
Dr. Sakowska will be presented with the award at a ceremony in her honor at
the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw on June 1.

Subject: vayomer-dovid glitshn

Long ago, in Vol. 5.283, Andrew Cassel asked about a skating game called 
something like "vayomer-dovid glitshn". 'Yidishe folklor', Vol. I, #3, 
March 1962 (published by the Y.L. Cahan Folklore Club of YIVO), in its 
'tsvishn yidishe kinder' section, has a number readers letters which 
describe skating games: not only "vayoymer-dovid-glish", but "kedushe-
glitsh", oyse-sholem-glitsh", boyi-besholem-glitsh and others.

"vayoymer-dovid-glitsh" is described as:

"men glitsht zikh zitsndik, onshparndik beshas-mayse dem kop af der hant."

Meyer-Leyb Wolf

[Moderator's note: Mendele old-timers know that usually questions to Mendele
don't remain unanswered. Even if it takes some time - like in this case.
At 9:35 p.m. EST on March 13, 1996 Andrew Cassel sent a question to Mendele,
and at 11:38 a.m. PST on March 13, 1998, almost seven hours before the
question's second anniversary, Meyer-Leyb Wolf submitted an answer, setting a
new record in our informal competition. Message to the recent posters who did
not see answers to their queries: never give up hope.  -i.v.]

Subject: Help for learners

I am trying to learn Yiddish by reading Mendele, but it hasn't been easy. 
Could Mendelyaners do us learners a favor?  Translate your favorite
expressions into literal or idiomatic English so we can learn them.  I am
referring to the recent commentary on responses to "Vus makhstu?" and "Vus
hert zich?"  I wish I could understand all of the expressions that were given. 
Thanks.

Subject: Hershele Ostropolyer

Hershele Ostropolyer was a "vitz" (wit) in Eastern Europe. He has been
protrayed as a beggar who always matched wits with the rich and mighty and,
invariably, came away a winner. (No one can explain, if this is the case, why
he was not also rich.) 

It is even uncertain whether or not such a person really existed or whether he
was a figment of the imagination of the millions of oppressed and starving
Jews of Poland --- much in the tradition of the dybbik--- who were desperately
seeking some escape from their daily hell. 

Does anyone know some Hershele Ostropolyer stories he can relate or can
someone point me in the right direction to read about his exploits (in English
or Yiddish)? 

Thanks in advance.

Subject: kurve

If I may respond to Hugh Denman's and Meyer Wolf's excellent questions/
suggestions,

(1) All my Yiddish informants happen to come from the area where Yiddish /u/
changes to /i/, and there is no question that the word in question has /u/
anyway, which means that this is NOT an old word in Yiddish but a recent
borrowing, most likely from Polish (or perhaps some other Slavic language). 

(2) The match between Polish (or Slavic) kurva (spelled with 'w' in Polish of
course but that is justspelling and has no deeper significance) and Yd kurve
is so perfect that any other etymology is higly unlikely anyway. 

(3) The absence of attestation for kurve outside of Eastern European Yiddish
(there I go again, of course, but the fact is that often the simplest way to
cut through the Gordian knots of Yd linguistics is to look at Yiddish, not at
Eastern European Yd only) again would support the idea that this is a strictly
local, Slavic- origin, form.  Recall that non-Eastern European Yiddish has
only a handful of Slavic forms, koyletsh, khapn, khotshe, and maybe one or two
more, and that is IT. 

(4) There is no way that I can see (but may be someone can help me) that
Hebrew could give a Yd form like kurve anyway.  First of all, the Hebrew 'u'
vowel before 'r' in a closed syllable (i.e., when the 'r' is followed by
another consonant) gives Yiddish /o/ or /e/.  Hebrew Hurba: (by a: I mean a
long a vowel) gives khorbe, not khurbe.  This rule was known to Yd linguists
and philologists at least as far back as the 1930's.  Another point is that,
as shown again by khorbe, Hebrew can only have beyz, not veyz in this
situation (and I dont see where we could get a vov from), so would have to
expect Yd *korbe, rather than kurve (* means that the form is hypothetical). 
Since the form IS kurve and not korbe, a Hebrew etymology is not possible, QED
(assuming all the premises are correct, which I am PRETTY sure they are). 

Hugh Denman writes:

"However, I still believe that a 'proto-Slavic' origin is unlikely. If the
derivation were Slav, Preobrazhensky would not have to posit a tentative Old
High German source that he himself regards as dubious". 

I think, w/o having access to Preobrazhensky, that there is a misunderstanding
here.  Unless I am mistaken, the issue is not whether the word is of Slavic
origin but whether it came into Slavic from German(ic)  or whether it is
native to Slavic (inherited from Indo-European directly). 

This may be a good place to make a more general point.  I have been urging
Mendelyaner to pay more attention to the results of Yiddish and general
linguistics (I should have added philology, since there have really been few
Yiddish historical LINGUISTS per se, as opposed to philologists, the line
being of course somewhat fuzzy but not entirely imaginary).  Of course,
linguists and philologists do not always (or even all that often!) agree, but
I think there are some things I think we DO have a handle on and DO agree
about.  I dont think any linguist would doubt that Yd and Hungarian forms of
kurve are borrowed from Slavic, even though as we have seen there is (or at
least once was) some dispute as to the ultimate origin within Slavic. 

I think it might be instructive to make a little list of some of the basic
facts of Yiddish linguistic history which all experts do agree on (many of
which I think will be surprising to some readers) and those which are still
controversial (which may be no less surprising). 

I myself, as a general linguist who stumbled into Yiddish by accident, tend to
view a certain amount of the lore of Yiddish linguistics and philology as
itself not up to contemporary standards in linguistics, and the dividing line
I tried to draw between experts and amateurs is also somewhat fuzzy, but
nevertheless I feel we must start to draw SOME lines and try to make it clear
that not EVERY suggestion regarding Yiddish that occurs to someone is equally
tenable given what has been learned in the last 100 or so years. 

For example, the idea that nebekh comes from German nicht bei euch (or the
like), although it was supported by some leading Yiddish philologists who were
by no means innocent of linguistics is, I would say, no more tenable today
than the idea of kurve being of Hebrew origin (which I don't think any
specialist has ever proposed). 

Of course, this does not mean that we should not discuss ideas which may turn
out to be incorrect.  On the contrary, it is only by discussion that we can
decide just what IS correct.

Subject: Why does Russian use G and not H?

A.M. Ramer and E. Prince replied [07.169] to L. Fridhandler's question
[07.167] with explanations for why Russian replaces /h/ with /g/ in words
which Russian has borrowed/acquired from other languages.  Although the title
of L. Fridhandler's post implied that this was his question, its content asked
why Yiddish has /h/ in _place-names_ where Russian has /g/.  In most cases,
Yiddish got its place-names from Russian (and other dominant languages), and
not the other way around;  the explanation required is for why Yiddish
replaces /g/ with /h/ in words borrowed/acquired from Russian. 

The regular sound change involved, I think, is as follows:  (Some) Slavic
languages have (or had) a voiced H, while Yiddish has a voiceless H, but no
voiced H.  Yiddish speakers "heard" the voiced H (which is a guttural sound)
as /g/ (which is a voiced sound made at the back of the mouth:  same voicing,
similar place of articulation), and thus used /g/ in place-names (and other
words?) whose Slavic parallels had a voiced H.  They could have just as well
substituted a voiceless /h/ for the voiced H (same place of articulation,
different voicing)--and sometimes did, resulting in double Yiddish place-names
(e.g. Horodne/Grodne). 

(I originally looked into this informally regarding the Horodne/Grodne
variation in Yiddish;  I imagine it would work similarly with a voiced
guttural fricative ['gh'].  The Ukrainian-speaking linguist who I asked
thought this might imply that Yiddish-speakers prioritized voicing over place
of articulation when identifying foreign sounds.  He made a similar comment
contrasting English and Yiddish regarding the priority of place of
articulation vs. rounding, using "Minkhn" vs. "Munich" as supporting
evidence.)
