Subject: book of Yiddish proverbs

The other day i was in Barnes and Noble in the Judaica section and found a
fantastic book.  It's called Yiddishe Chochma and, as the title suggests, it
contains wonderful Yiddish proverbs and expressions that my grandmother used
to say.  I don't believe that an author took credit for compiling it, but
the illustrator was named.  There were beautiful Chagall- like paintings
scattered within.  I highly recommend this book as a family treasure.

Subject: Yiddish Arthur Conan Doyle

Isaac Bashevis Singer said that as a young boy he had been given Yiddish
books by Dostoevsky and Arthur Conan Doyle. He said they wrote so
beautifully in Yiddish that it motivated him to become a Yiddish writer. 

I am trying to locate and get originals or copies of all of the works of
Arthur Conan Doyle that have been translated into Yiddish (including, but
not limited to the Sherlock Holmes stories, of which I already have a
number). I have searched most North American and Western European sources.
If anybody has any knowledge of such works, or would like to have a list of
what I have found so far, please contact me off list.

Subject: G. Winer's discussion of Grade

In Gershon Winer's discussion of Grade's "My Quarrel with Hersh Rasseyner
[Vol 08.129], I must add a side light. While I was working on my translation
of Kentucky, I had the good fortune to visit with I. J.Schwartz and to talk
about his relationship with his contemporaries. At the end, he suffered from
extreme loneliness. I asked if he ever saw Chaim Grade, one of the few of
his contemporaries then alive. He looked very sad, and said he had had a big
argument with Grade years before and never spoke to him since. The subject
of the argument was Grade's abandonment of his poetic gifts. Schwartz
respected Grade's talents as a poet. According to Schwartz, Grade was only
writing poetry when he first came to America, but was not able to earn
anything with his poetry. The Forward promised to publish stories if he had
them, but they had no need for more poets. Grade then began writing stories
(according to Schwartz's testimony). Schwartz reported that he told him, "Go
ahead. Write stories because that is what you can sell." To me, he compared
Grade to a mercenary. 

Winer's discussion of the Hirsh Resseyner story prompted this memory. I
wonder if it is another layer in the story. I haven't read it in years, but
shall do so promptly. At any rate, I thank Gershon Winer for a provacative
entry in Mendele On Line. 

Shalom,

From: SHirshan@aol.com
Subject: Shneour's Noah Pandre

Although the term Pandre is not originally a Yiddish one, no lesser a
Yiddish writer than Zalman Shneour (whom some have rated artistically with
Sholem Asch and I.J. Singer) starts his riveting novel, _Song of the
Dnieper_ with the following opening lines to flesh out his forceful, main
character, Noah Pandre: 

_It is hard to say now whether Pandre was a real family name, or a nickname,
or a hint at his non-Jewish appearance. His generation has died out-the
generation of butchers who reeked with the smell of raw meat and brute
strength._

Whatever its origin or exact translation, the term pandre appears to have
had meaning and enjoyed usage in Yiddish.

Subject: a ditty from Minsker Gubernye

Also for scholarly purposes, I add to Hershl Bershady's uncle's [Vol 08.129]
ditty, one my mother repeated to me about fifty years ago.  Although
offensive today, one need only consider the highly-pogromized area of
Minsker Gubernye from which she came. 

Vakhlakhlakis
Yidn brokhes
Goyim kadokhes.

Nem a holts.
Makh a tsaylem.
Farshtek in tokhes.

Subject: poor judgment, or worse!

I am sure that I am not the only reader of Mendele who was shocked, if not
outraged, to see the totally inappropriate ditty in Mendele 08.129(9). To
foist it upon us "for scholarly purposes" is simply a hypocritical ruse. I
am surprised that our moderator did not catch this before releasing it. I
feel that an apology is called for, for this regrettable lapse in judgment.
Even were there no Christian subscribers to Mendele, I would be embarrassed
to see this sort of thing. If such a "poem" denigrating a Jewish religious
symbol were to appear in the media, it would justifiably be branded as
anti-semitic.  Shame! A kharpe un a shande!

Itsik Goldenberg

[Moderator's note: I am sorry that Itsik Goldenberg was offended by a
posting to Mendele. However I think that there are legitimate scholarly
purposes in collecting and studying folklore, even if it does not comply
with our current ethical and other standards. Jokes in general are "often
terribly insulting to members of ethnic, racial, sexual, religious, and
other groups" (A.A.Berger, "The Genius of the Jewish Joke", Jason Aronson,
1998). This particular kind, obscene and blasphemeous, or "anti-behavioral" 
according to B.A.Uspensky ("Ot mifa k literature", Rossiskii Universitet,
1993) is well known in many cultures (see e.g. M.M.Bakhtin, "Rabelais and
his world", MIT Press, 1968). Fortunately, many examples of the irreverent
Yiddish folklore were recorded by I.Bernstein, N.Stutchkoff and others
without any censoring. Whether Mendele as media is appropriate for such
postings is a different issue that may be discussed.     -Iosif Vaisman]

Subject: ferd's fus 

Dear Mendele,
 
i want to add my mother's use of relationship terms to the response of
E.Palevsky [Vol 08.129]. My mom, born in Yashenovke nearly 99 years ago (she
just died a day ago at 98) used to remark sarcastically that two people were
related "vi a ferd's fus poskevis aynikl" (a horse's hoofs grandbabe... or
something as vaguely irrelevant as this relationship would be!).

Subject: Song Lyrics

Greetings!

I'm looking for additional lyrics, published, recorded or otherwise, for a
song I found on an lp set called "The Generations of Israel" (CBS Legacy 32
B5 0012, ca. 1968). It is performed there by Naomi Levy. Perhaps it is only
a fragment of a longer recording. Here's what I have so far: 

Oygn kukn vayt avek,
Vayt in mitn yam.
Zeglen vayse piramidn,
Vayt in mitn yam.
Tsu zey geyn, tsu zey shteyn,
Vayt in mitn yam.
Beyze vintn eybik veyen,
Vayt in mitn yam.

Opgeshvimen iz der tog,
Vayt in mitn yam.
Regn likhtik in der himl,
Vayt in mitn yam.
Keyner kumt nit shpet bay nakht,
Vayt in mitn yam.
Sha, shvimt aroys mayn laykhte shifl,
Vayt in mitn yam.

Thanks in advance for your help!

Sincerely,

Lorin Sklamberg
