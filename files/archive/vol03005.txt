Subject: Additional Idioms

        A Yiddish idiom that I am quit fond of is: "Er
kukt vi a hon in B'nai Odam."  The literal translation,
"He looks as a rooster does in B'nai Odam," is not very
helpful.  The reference is to the ritual of kaporos on
eruv Yom Kippur: a man, picking up a rooster (a woman,
picking up a hen), recites a prayer (in Hebrew) that
begins with the phrase: "B'nai adam yoshvei choshech
v'tsalmavet" (= Children of man who sit in darkness and
the shadow of death). The point of the idiom, I take
it, is that the object of the lampoon has as much
comprehension of some item that he is examining as the
hapless rooster in the kaporos ritual has of the Hebrew
text at which he is staring.

Subject: Transcription and transliteration

i agree heartily with arn/arthur that we should be
consistent in orthography. the one real problem i had
for a while was with 'mazel/mazl tov'--'mazl tov' just
looked so wrong to me in an (otherwise) english note!
finally, i've made peace with myself by deciding that,
in the context of english, the term is actually a
borrowing and, in ENGLISH, is spelled _mazel tov_. in
the context of yiddish, of course, it should be spelled
rendered as _mazl tov_. any other opinions on this one?

after two years, could someone please please tell me
one thing: why do we use only 2/3 of the screen on
mendele? is there anyone out there in mendeleland for
whom this is an advantage? a dank.

[When Mendele was being planned, someone with
experience in typesetting and layout advised setting
the right margin at about 55, presumably to increase
legibility.  There is no other reason.  If readers
prefer a wider margin, like this one, that can easily be arranged.

Perhaps I misunderstand Arn, but I have absolutely no
idea as to what aspect of my original posting he is
responding to.  I certainly don't have any disagreement
with him on any of the above.  The only suggestion was
that it may be preferable to trade greater intelligi-
bility for consistency, in some cases. Whereas for a
word like khanuke, there are many variant translitera-
tions used popularly, this is not so for the word
'Yiddish'. Hence retention of the spelling 'Yiddish'
may be useful (in preference to Yidish).

As I pointed out in my previous posting, this tradeoff
of wider intelligibility for consistency is not uncommon
with other languages.

My only fear was that perhaps Yiddish was not part of a
small subset of words (although it seems to me that it
is so), so that adopting the suggestion of retaining
the popular spelling would wreck havoc with the use of
the YIVO orthography. Or perhaps there are other nafke
mines that I have not considered.

Subject: yid(d)ish

Meylekh Viswanath argues that Yugntruf's "yidish vokh"
can be publicized as "yiddish vokh" (2 d's), because
the word "yiddish" is commonly so spelled. It's true
that the names of many well-known Yiddish writers are
commonly (though not always) transliterated in ways not
in keeping with YIVO conventions (Sholem Aleichem,
Sholem Asch, I.L. Peretz, H. Leivick, for example).
But surely that's no reason to write a phrase half in
English (yiddish), half in Yiddish (vokh)?  Either
"yiddish (or Yiddish) week" OR "yidish vokh", it seems
to me.

Subject: More on alef/ayin

Mikhl, thanks for your (re)explanation of alef/ayin/yud
in the beginning of a word in Yiddish.  I found it very
interesting especially the historical information about
the use of hes and vov, where we now use khof and fe in
the beginning of a word.  However, I am not entirely
convinced about that theory to explain 'aleph, yud,
daled' for 'yid/id', rather than 'yud,yud,daled.'  (But
I am still thinking on that.)

Meanwhile, I figured out your additional comments on my
parenthetical remark.  You said:

>Meylekh, I just noticed the parenthetic remark in your
>message of May 3--the one I was ostensibly replying to.
>I think you may be confusing the issue when you say
>that "ayin" is not always a vowel in Yiddish. It is,
>except in the traditional spelling of words of Hebrew
>origin, where it's simply an artifact of a totally
>different system. As for "alef", it too, it, too, is
>either a vowel (as in the case of [a] and [o]) or
>strictly an orthographic symbol, either as a "dummy"
>consonant in non-Hebrew words, or as whatever, in the
>traditional spellings of Hebrew words. Yes? No?

My original parenthetical remark was:

>I understand that in Yiddish, 'yud' is not always a
>vowel, but then neither are alef and ayin.

What I meant, however, was:

I understand that in Yiddish, 'yud' is not always a
_consonant_, but then neither are alef and ayin.

Since your explanation for the initial occurrence of
aleph in 'aleph, yud, daled' was that a consonant was
needed, and alef was a consonant, the query (contained
in my parenthetical remark) was:

  alef a consonant?!  yud is more of a consonant (in
  yiddish) than alef; at least yud is sometimes a
  consonant in yiddish; alef and ayin never are!

Unfortunately, I mistyped 'vowel' for 'consonant'
leading to the confusion.

Meylekh.
