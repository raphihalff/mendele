Subject: Chava Alberstein Film - "Too Early To Be Quiet, Too Late To Sing"

We have had occasion to view the film produced by Chava Alberstein dealing 
with Yiddish poets and Yiddish poetry in Israel. It is professionally 
produced (what less should we expect from one of Israel's top performing 
artists), and a joy to Yiddish libhobers.

Appropriate for vinkln and leynkreyzn at any level (English subtitles are a 
great help) and a significant resource for any teacher or professor involved 
in teaching Yiddish or researching contemporary Yiddish literature.

We have yet to learn how the video will be distributed or when it will be 
available for sale.

Subject: a rebishn tish

Vera Szabo [Mendele Vol 7.021] asks "How would you translate 'gefirt a 
tish' into English, by the way?"

Good question. How indeed? I can hardly see myself using the expression in
English. (The esrog question all over again.)  The  Jewish Tribune (London)
reports on tishn from time to time but I can't remember how they phrase it.
Maybe "..held a tish.."

The yidish idiom frequently allows the pun, when someone (a chosid in a
shtibl perhaps) is carrying a table... az er firt tish!

Di yidish-lige

[A special offer from the Yiddish Forverts]

The editors of the Forverts have on two occasions announced their intention 
to institute in the very near future the YIVO system of standard Yiddish 
spelling.  

In honor of this historic event, the Yiddish-League is undertaking a campaign 
to create 100 new Forverts subscribers and pay for their subscription. The 
effort is made possible by a generous contribution from an anonymous donor.

Those interested should send their name and address to the League for Yiddish,
above, or electronically to bergez01@popmail.med.nyu.edu.

Subject: Weinreich's phrase book

I should like to alert the readers of this list to a delightfully humorous
essay regarding Uriel and Beatrice Weinreich's little paperback phrase book
"Say It in Yiddish" in the current (June - July 1997) issue of _Civilization_
[The Magazine of The Library of Congress].  The essay is entitled "Guidebook
to a Land of Ghosts" and is subtitled "A Yiddish phrase book is an absurd,
poignant artifact of a country that never was."  The writer, Michael Chabon,
finds, in the pages of the phrase book, detailed directions - buying plane
tickets, visiting the dentist, getting a finger wave from a Yiddish-speaking
hairdresser or a shoeshine from a Yiddish-speaking shineboy - in a country
that never existed.  The charming illustrations by Ben Katchor of city life
in this imaginary land wherein all street signs, billboards, directional
markers and public notices are all in Yiddish _oysyes_ is alone worth the
price of the magazine.
