Subject: Introduction

Sholem aleykhem.  I'm Frayde.  I live in Western MA.  I teach English to
aliens now, but for years, I was a student of Yiddish literature and
Jewish history (and still am).  I also translate Yiddish and have been
singing in a Yiddish band in the area.  Ikh gris alemen gor frayndlekh!

Subject: Only in my family: scrotum

Far "scrotum" in mayn litvakisher mispokhe mit a zekhtsik yor tsurik in
Bruklin hot men gezogt /meki/ oder /mekele/--at least, in referring to a
young boy's scrotum. Is this term known to anyone else?  Mordkhe
Schaechter's _Pregnancy, Childbirth and Early Childhood:  An
English-Yiddish Dictionary_ gives only /der kis/ (with a kof), as does U.
Weinreich; and /dos kisele/.

Subject: Psychoanalytical readings of Yiddish literature and authors

I recommend Janet Hadda's book, Passionate Women, Passive Men:  Suicide
in Yiddish Literature (not the exact title, but close enought).  Pub. in
1990 or 1991 by SUNY Press.  Also, her article on Celia Dropkin's poetry
in a biographical/ psychoanalytical context, in Gender and Text in Modern
Jewish Literature (ed. Naomi Sokoloff, et al.)  1992.

Subject: Yidish teatr

Undzer Vinkl volt makhn a shpil--I recently was fortunate enough to see
the Am. Theatre of the Deaf's production of An Italian Straw Hat, which
was artfully performed in simultaneous English and American Sign Language
(don't miss the opportunity to see them if it comes your way!).  I was
wondering if any group has performed simultaneous Yiddish/English drama
and, if so, how it worked out.

A groysn dank.  (You can respond to me personally if you wish).

Subject: A convention

Regarding  Zellig Bach's call for a convention. My granddaughter  Ariella
and I think it's a terrific  idea. However, you assume that N.Y. City is
automatically the chosen place!!! We on the west coast of Los Angeles
would prefer a more central location if possible.

Subject: A convention

Zelig Bach's commentary re a mendele convention sounds great. However
after he mentioned the location (city) it seems as though he takes it for
granted that the location would be NYC. He spoke of visits to the
Forward, YIVO, Brooklyn, etc.  I just had the privilege of going to the
conference in Toronto and would love to see another Yiddish convention on
the west coast. I live in Los Angeles and believe it or not, we do have
quite a bit of history in the southwest.  I certainly have no objection
to NYC.  It just gets a bit expensive to go east anytime anything of
value takes place.  I'd like to hear what other mendelniks think.  A gutn
ovent.

Hmm.  We use "risiven" for scribble (such as in a colouring book). Anyone
else use that?

For Yiddish traced back to Europe, that may be true.  But we definitely
have some oysgetrakhte verter in our family.  After a while they become
normal parts of our family vocabulary and we don't notice them, until an
outside Yiddish speaker hears us and bursts out laughing.

E.g., salat-ontuekhts for salad dressing.  (That's been standardized; we
pronounce it salat-utiyekhts.)

(A bit of background for those relatively new on the list: we live in
Toronto and have 4 young kids, to whom we speak only Yiddish and who we
don't allow to speak English to us or each other.  I spoke no Yiddish as
a child; my wife Simone grew up with it, and we still use it with her
parents, who are Holocaust survivors in their 70's who also live in
Toronto.  Our kids are now 10, 8, 5 and 3 and all totally fluent in
Yiddish.  Since their circle of Yiddish-speaking acquaintances is
perforce limited, their version of Yiddish is basically what they get
from us, and to some extent from their bubby & zaidy.)
