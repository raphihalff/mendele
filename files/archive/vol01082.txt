Subject: Kholodets etc.

1) The term _kholodEts_ is used in three different meanings
in the East Slavic linguistic area.  In the southern and
south-eastern part of the Russian-speaking area,
_kholodets_ designates what other Russian speakers call
_stUden'_, i.e. a cold dish prepared from veal, beef or
pork (using the head and feet) by lengthy cooking followed
by maximal thickening of the stock. In northern and central
regions Russian speakers use the term _kholodets- (or
_kholOdnoe_) to refer to a cold dish of fish in its own
thickened stock. Ukrainian and Belorussian speakers
sometimes use the term to refer to cold berry soup.

        Polish _galarEta- (from MHG _galhart_; contemporary
German _Gallerte_) can refer to jellied meat, fish or
fruit.  _Galantine_ (perhaps from Old French _galine_
'chicken') is described in the _Larousse gastronomique_ as
"a dish made from boned poultry or meat, stuffed and
pressed into a symmetrical shape [and] cooked in a gelatine
stock."  In Russian this is called -zalivnOe-, a dish of
fish, meat or poultry over which thickened stock has been
poured and allowed to cool.

        2) In her book _From My Mother's Kitchen_ Mimi
Sheraton has a recipe for what she calls "noant" and
describes as a "Passover honey nut candy."  The ingredients
are 1 cup honey, 2 cups sugar, 1 tablespoon lemon juice,
1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger, grated rind of 1/2 medium
orange, and 1-1/2 cups coarsely chopped walnuts.
