Subject: Pishe-Peyshe

Well, while we're on the subject of pishe-peyshe, I thought i'd
through in my two cents -- one is about the meaning of
"pishe-peyshe," and the other is about counting rhymes.

First of all, i agree that we certainly never associated the name
"pishe-peyshe" with anything slang or vulgar -- in fact, i always
thought it meant "back-and-forth," because my family has always used
it to mean that, both in yiddish _and_ in english.  you can run
pishe-peyshe, argue pishe-peyshe, or even talk pishe-peyshe.  it
never occurred to me that we were using the name of the card game as
a word and not the other way round! has anyone else ever encountered
this use of the phrase, or is it unique to my family?

Second, there was a starting rhyme that went with the game (as with
most other games), used to count off the time when each person would
flip over a card to see who went first; it went _something_ like:

pishe-peyshe, pishe-peyshe, pishe-peyshe, boo!
gib die ershte kertl zu!

i don't think i've ever seen an adult play the game, and i can't
even remember who taught it to us -- probably older cousins or
someone...  i figured it was just too mindless or boring for adults
-- but over thanksgiving break i did get to play it with my younger
cousins (college-age is still young enough to be considered a "kid"
i guess  :)  ). they don't speak yiddish, but my uncle must have
taught them the english equivalent of the rhyme:

pishe-peyshe, pishe-peyshe, pishe-peyshe, boo!
put a card in, starting with you!

Similar rhymes existed, of course, for other games, even non-card
games. our favorite, with a virtually identical rhyme, was 'haga
baga' (haga baga, haga baga, haga baga bir!  heybt di mayseh on mit
dir!, or haga baga, haga baga, haga baga, boo! tell a story,
starting with you!)

We even had yiddish, english, or mixed rhymes for starting out such
american favorites as 'go fish':

beyrelech, heyrelech, bim bam bim
mish 'em up, fishele shvim shvam shvim!

But the existence of rhymes even for games i frequently played with
my friends leads me to think that they probably are less traditional,
and more made up by my family...  anyone else have similar rhymes?

nu, genug

Subject: English language discussions of daytshmerizms

Although Yiddish was my first language, sixty-five years later I
have scant fluency.  I do have a rooting interest and a
semi-professinal knowledge of linguistic principles.  Bringing these
two things together I've been fascinated by the discussions of
daytshmerizm (what I could understand of it).

To the point:  Can anyone suggest English language discussions of
the issue?  I can handle something more advanced than introductory
but it's been a long time since I dealt with technical linguistic
theory. Something in-between would be about right.

Subject: Vayter ibber alte Yiddish

I want to thank Reyzl Kalifowicz-Waletzky for her thoughtful and
informative critique of my earlier comments on Century Old Yiddish.
I can better appreciate and sympathize with her position. Basicly it
is very much like that of the French Acadamy which seeks to
stabilize and preserve the French language. A fragile language like
Yiddish needs something like that even more so if it is to survive.

However to conserve is not the same as to revert. For example the
French Acadamy does not seek to return to the language of Francois
Villon, as beautiful and powerful as his poetry may be. Yiddish had
a short period of flowering before its brutal distruction and
linguists are properly concerned with the nature and evolution of
its development. But it seems to me that if academicians wish to
stabilize the language it would be more appropriate to do so at the
point of its most recent development rather than cavil about which
form is the oldest. My point in refering to Harkavy's dictionary was
merely to indicate that he thought the his audience (i.e. his
customers) would better understand the meaning of the English word
"read" if he told them that it meant "lezn". Remember that he was
trying to explain English to native Yiddish speakers, not the
converse. What that tells me is that at least in his opinion, "lezn"
was the most commonly used or understood word for "read" in that
community of speakers. Of course I agree that he also should have
included "leyenen" but he apparantly found it unnecessary. The issue
is not whether "leyenen" is incorrect, but rather whether "lezn" is
also fully acceptible as "proper" Yiddish, and I think that this
makes it evident that it is, regardless of ancient history.

More to the point, if one accepts the need to standardize and codify
Yiddish as a means of preserving it, it would seem to me more
appropriate to look to the practice of the few surviving communities
for whom Yiddish reamains a living native language, the khasidim of
Brooklyn and Mea Shearim. I am not familiar with their dialects and
or idiosyncratic usages and would be most interested in learning of
them. If the issue is the survival of Yiddish, in the end that can
only happen in such communities which require the language for their
quotidien life. It would therefore make sense to attempt the
standardization of the language about THEIR current practice rather
than about some hypothetical academic and, it seems to me, quite
unnatural ideal. It is unfortunately too late in the day to continue
to fight the battles of pre-holocost academia.

And so,dear khavere Reyzl, I truly welcome your comments and value
your opinion, tin ear and all.
