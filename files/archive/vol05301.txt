Subject: 'Di Shvue'

Is anyone aware of any recordings of 'Di Shvue' that are still available?
'Di Shvue' was the anthem of the Bund (Union of workers in Russia,
Lithunania and Poland), written by S Anski in 1905.

Thanks

Subject: Some translation queries

[re: Joseph Sherman post in5.300]

1. _krigelekh_. Rashi on Genesis XXXII:24 notes "he had forgotten some small
jars".

2. _Rabi Reb Tsots_. Proverbial yakhsn & great Rabbi. Often mentioned by
Bahevis, e.g in 'Mayse Tishevits':

        kegn ale dray [nief, gelt, gayve] iz keyner nisht gevornt, meg er
        zayn der rebbe R' Tsots.

Also known as R' Ots.

Subject: Peter O'Toole and the Yiddish Hamlet

Mort Sahl tells this one:

Peter O'Toole came to New York to appear in Hamlet. His Jewish cab driver
struck up a conversation. "So, Mr. O'Toole, what are you doing in New York?"

"I'm appearing in Hamlet. Have you seen it?" replied O'Toole.

"Years ago, in the Yiddish Art Theater on Second Avenue" answered the cabbie.

After a pause the driver mused "Do you think it will work in English?"

Subject: "Yok"

In a story in last week's New Yorker "Mother with Child" by Jonathan Wilson,
the narrator's mother uses the word "yok" as a pejorative to describe the
narrators gentile girl friend.  The author explains:"*Yok* is Anglo-Jewish
for Gentile. It's worse than "goy" or "shiksa."  It connotes viciousness,
brutality, and deep, irredemiable stupidity."  Any of the Brit-ish
Mendelyaner familiar with this word or its origins?  It looks like "goy"
backwards, with the unvoiced "k" replacing the "g".  But that's a wild guess.
Related to "yeke?"

Subject: The daytshmerism "als"

In his reprint of Y. L. Perets's essay _Hebreyish un Yiddish_  (5.298,1, April
7, 1996), Leonard Prager corrected the old Yiddish spelling prevailing at that
time [1909], specifically the unnecessary ayens /e's/ and the "puste" (empty,
soundless) /hey's/, thus "blaybEn" to _blaybn_, and "oystsufiHrEn to
_oystsufirn_, to conform with the YIVO romanization.

Prager also corrected "heyligkeyt" to heilikkeyt, but today's literary Yiddish
does not take double consonants, and the correction should therefore be
"heilikeyt."  As I had occasion to state in a previous post, the double /tes/
in _glatt_ kosher does not make it kosherer.

Double letters occur only when a prefix ends with a consonant and the
conjoined verb starts with the self-same consonant,  examples: farruf
[reference, allusion], oyssortirn [sort out]. tsunoyfflekhtn [intertwine].

Prager also singled out four (4) daytsmerisms in Perets's essay, and wonders
which one might be considered "good, kosher Yiddish words."  They are:  1)
Gegenvart; 2) hantirn;  3) Tsershrayung; and 4) ufrikhtik.  But he overlooked
one daytshmerism (see below).

With reference to No. 1, the word carries in Uriel Weinreich's MEYYED a clin
(wedge), a typographical warning sign used to indicate in this dictionary that
it is not admissible in standard Yiddish;  No. 4 carries a heavy dot, here to
indicate that it is doubtful whether admissible in literary Yiddish,

No such warning signs about inadmissibility are found in Harkavy's YEH
dictionary (YIVO's 1988 reprint of his second, expanded 1928 edition).  Not
only was Harkavy not proscriptive, but to the contrary he was totally
permissive:  In his judgment every spoken word in Yiddish, including a flood
of Americanisms, was fit to be included in his dictionary.

Proscriptive warning signs such as clins are to be found only in both UW's
MEYYED and in Stutshkov's _Oytser_ that was edited by Max Weinreich.

In terms of Prager's use of the term "kosher" for good Yiddish words, one
might say that when a word is marked by the Weinreichs with a clin, it means
that in their judgement it is "unclean" for modern literary Yiddish...

The daytshmerism that Prager overlooked:  In Perets's following sentence "Di
yidishe iberzetsung [fun khumesh] volt geven fil nenter tsum original als
[sic] ale iberzetsungen in andere shprakhn."  _Als_ is definitely a
daytshmerism, and so glossed, after archaic, in the _Groyser Verterbukh fun
der Yidisher Shprakh (vol. III).  Max Weinreich and Zalmen Reyzn, among
others, were very outspoken against the use of "als" in Yiddish and suggested
'vi,' 'far,' or certain adverbial forms as substitutions.  In the sentence
cited above, "vi" would have been very appropriate in place of "als" and
convey in full the intended meaning.

Subject: Singer's 'lost' novel

"Der zindiker meshiekh: historisher roman," by Isaac Bashevis Singer, appeared
in the "Forverts" from Oct. 5, 1935 to Feb. 22, 1936.  The novel appeared
under the name Yitskhok Bashevis.  The source for this information is David
Neal Miller's "Bibliography of Isaac Bashevis Singer, 1924-1949" (New York -
Berne - Frankfurt: Peter Lang, 1983), pp. 58-60.

David Miller supplemented this bibliography with "A Bibliography of Isaac
Bashevis Singer, January 1950-June 1952," which was issued as no. 34 of the
YIVO series of Working Papers in Yiddish and East European Jewish Studies
(1979).  Awhile back, Roberta Saltzman of the New York Public Library's Jewish
Division reported that she was working on an update to Miller's two
bibliographies.

Subject: Apple Hebrew/Yiddish software

I'm just catching up with the all the Mendele I missed while away on vacation,
and have just noticed Morrie Feller's complaints about Apple's Hebrew Language
Kit in 5.285.

While it isn't everything we could wish for, the HLK is better for our
purposes than it may have seemed at first to khaver Feller.

It's true, as khaver Feller points out, that of the combinations that we need
to write Yiddish properly, only pasekh tsvey yudn is available in the HLK as a
single key-stroke. But all the other combinations can be produced by using two
key-strokes: fey mit a dekhele, pasekh alef, komets alef, even khirik yud.

(By the way, Yasminke Dowling's comments in 5.292 sound like they're based on
the old version of the HLK, which you could get with Nisus if you bought their
language key. The new (as of December 95) version, which as I understand it is
_not_ available through Nisus Corp, is considerably better. All but one of the
fonts supplied has the dekhele for the fey (and that font's ugly anyway ;-).
One of the fonts (peninim khadashim) is even quite attractive; I though the
fonts in the old version were awful.)

I agree that it's tiresome to have to type two keys for something we think of
as a single letter. I keep typing 'a', and forgetting to add the pasekh ;-)

(Mac gurus: are there any ways to work around this? I know how to change a
KCHR resource in Resedit, but I don't see any way to make one keystroke
produce two characters ... If you have ideas, send me private e-mail, and I'll
send a summary to Mendele.)

And much as I like Nisus, it does have its problems. But after all the
makeshift schemes I've cooked up over the years, I'm delighted to have a real
word-processor that can handle Yiddish. Automatic line breaks and everything!
a mekhaye ;-)
