Subject: VEE ZAGT MIN, "iKH GEH 'BIRD WATCHING'
 
Who knows whether Jews went bird-watching in Eastern Europe
-- other than keep- ing an eye on the various ages and
stages of chickens!  At any rate, this seems very much an
American sport, certainly for the present generations, and
I think should get an American-Yiddish phrase.  (The
shames's suggestion a. Ikh gey zikh arumvolgern mit di
feygl -- sounds like something one's parent would have said
to one of us).  I suggest feygl-kihken as the name for the
activity.  It's short, to the point and certainly expresses
the activity.  As to the variety of feyglach -- this takeh
takes a lot of thought.

Hershel

[The shames, back from his flutter with the birds, has had
a few more ideas on the subject and will probably air them
when the backlog is cleared.]

	Moishe   Nusn: Listen more carefully to the native speakers
	of Alsatian Yiddish.
 
	Don't they pronounce, e.g., initial t
	and d the same way, as something more or less in
	between--so that talis (prayer shawl) and dalis 'poverty'
	'sound' the same? What city are you in? Are you interested
	in Alsatian Yiddish?
 
Dunno about alsatian Yiddish, seems to exist no more. As
 for alsatian Alsatian, you are right, although I hear 'd'
 more as a 't' (and a linguist colleague, himself a native
 speaker of alsatian confirmed it for me). Same with 'b'and
 'p' (again the phoneme sonore is prominent).
 
	How about trying your hand, now, at the etymology of
	gra(y)zn and an the origin of the expression noyekh mit
	zibn gra(y)zn
 
Am trying to, but have no idea; shall have to ask around
 me. But see the item 2) in the referenced issue.

Subject: Negative concord

Parallel to kenaho're/ken ayenho're/kana'yneho're (without
negative concord) is ken aho're ni(sh)t and only ken ahore
zol dir nit shatn.  But yes, neg concord does not hold 100%
-- exceptions are usually in poetry (poetic license!,
influence of literary [MH] German) or formulaic expressions
(such as ken ahore, or in proverbs [for rhythm, e.g.]).
Formulaic material is usually old (it is preserved and
undergoes less linguistic change than other items _because
of_ rhyme, rhythmic devices, etc.) which perhaps points
back to the origin of these expressions in Old Yiddish,
when it was (linguistically and physically) closer to
German, (the standard dialect of which) has no negative
concord.

I know of the 'ober/oder-"confusion"' from poylishe yidn
(Lodzh, e.g.). Doesn't Prilutski have a short article on
this in Yidishe filologye or Yidish far ale?  Somebody
does, I just don't have the volumes at hand.

Subject: tsh

Eftsher veys reb Mikhl, oder emetsher andersh:

From poylishe yidn I hear eftsher for StY 'efsher' (I've
never yet seen this discussed in print); eymetsher
[eymetsha], also from poylishe, has been mentioned in
print.  Schaechter has written about khtshuf 'shtshav'.
From Zypora Spaisman (Lubliner Yiddish, if I'm not
mistaken), actress in NYC's Folksbine Playhouse, I heard
khtshives 'khshives'!  There is stg to be said for this,
but what is it?!  (eymetsher may be a remnant of sabesdiker
losn, as those parts also have smate 'shmate', etc., but
the others seem to follow some other phonological pattern.)
