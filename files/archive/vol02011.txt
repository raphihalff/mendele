Subject: The Yiddish-Vokh

Are you young(ish), seek a Yiddish-speaking environment and
need a vacation? Or are you priorities in slightly
different order:  do you need a vacation and want to spend
it in a Yiddish-speaking environment?  Then the following
is for you (copied from a circular of Yugntruf - Youth for
Yiddish).  Tell family members, friends, and your students
(if you aren't one yourself).

The Yiddish-Vokh [annual retreat of Yugntruf] this year
will be held from Wednesday, September 2, through Tuesday,
September 8.  We had a wonderful turn-out last summer, with
participants coming from as far away as Toronto, Chicago,
Louisiana and North Carolina.  Again, we will be at Camp
Emanuel in Copake, New York, on the scenoc border of the
Berkshire Mountains.

As every year, there will be a variety of activities, all
conducted in Yiddish: lectures, volleyball, swimming,
boating, hiking, Dvar Torah, Game Show Night and campfire
sing-alongs.  This summer will feature a week-long Yiddish
calligraphy workshop.  The food at camp is kosher, and
there is a synagogue on the premises.  A few hours of
babysitting each day will be available, at no extra cost,
so parents can participate in the recreational activities
while their young children are being cared for.

*The cost for the entire week is $180 per person, including
gratuities. [Ridiculous price, no?  (This comment wasn't in
the original letter -- DB)] The full amount must be paid
before June 15, in order to ensure your reservation.*

We are presently organizing the schedule for the
Yidish-Vokh.  If there is a subject that you can speak on
in Yiddish (for example, lecture on modern Yiddish poetry)
or an activity that you can lead (for example, dvar Torah
or stargazing), please let us know on the application form,
and send it together with your check (payable to Yugntruf),
to Yugntruf, 200 West 72 St. Suite 40, New York, NY
10023-2805

Subject: RE: Mendele Vol 2.10

As someone who is pre The Joys of Yiddish but coeval with
H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N, I can assure David Sherman that the
soup spilling separation of shlemeel from shlemazal
antedates The Joys.

By the way, you Canadians ought to know that this topic was
part of the subject of your [soon to be Cambridge, Mass's]
Ruth Wisse's doctoral thesis.

Hinda Feldman offers Wahrig's derivation of shlemeel from
the Hebrew shin-lamed-vav mem-vav-eyin-yod-lamed, she-lo
mo'eel - very clever indeed, even if fanciful, I think.

sounds to me like shelo mo'il as a derivation was concocted
by some shlemeel. while "I have not seen" is no proof--
(and i have seen quite a bit of talmudic and medieval
Hebrew) such a phrase as shelo moil is suited for
situations, acts, attempts at correction-- but not people-
es klapt nisht.

Subject: Beben un bebitsn

Dovid Braun is very likely right that 'bebitsn' is an
Americanism; at any rate it isn't in Stutchkoff.

However, it shouldn't be a total loss, I have a little
story.  A friend of mine was on pretty close terms with
Isaac Bashevis.  Once Bashevis told him that he'd been
to some sort of reception and that he'd met one of the
most leonine of literary lions of that time (out of res-
pect for his memory no names).

"You met A.D.?" cried my friend (he was in publishing).

"Yeh," said I.B.

"So what did he say, what did he talk about?"

(For this you have to remember I.B.'s voice) "Bebede bebe,
vot does a shikker say?"
