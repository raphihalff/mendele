Subject: Yiddish text of Manger's purimshpil?

Hi - wrong holiday, I know, but I was wondering whether anyone could
tell me where to buy or find the Yiddish text of Manger's purimshpil -
I've been listening to the wonderful Burshteyn recording and would like
to have a look at the text they're starting from.  A dank,

Larry Rosenwald

Subject: Dreyfus in Kasrilevke

Dear friends,

Many thanks for the romanized version of Sholem-Aleykhem's "Dreyfus in
Kasrilevke".  The unidentified "Lambori" should be the lawyer Fernand
Labori (1860-1917), who raised to world fame during the Dreyfus affair
as Emil Zola's defense counsel. A matter of transcription?

My very best wishes,
Ingemar Johansson

Subject: Dreyfus in Kasrilevke

A few comments on the endnotes to the text of "Dreyfus in Kasrilevke":

Endnote 17:  "vetshni poselenye", while it may work in Polish as well,
is nontheless Russian for "perpetual deportation".  The Jews of
Kasrilevke undoubtedly knew all too well the Russian terms for
imprisonment in Czarist Russia. Polish was not an important language in
that part of the Ukraine.

Endnote 18:  "frantsehoyzn" is indeed a pun, but I doubt if Sholem
Aleykhem--not a writer much given to sexual imagery-- had syphilis in
mind.  More likely the "frants" hints at "frandzn" (fringes) or "frant"
(fop), both suggesting dandyism, something like "fancypants".

Endnote 20: "tut ne zhidivska shkola...." (Ukrainian, by the way) uses
Jewish terms in a kind of pseudo-translation.  Hence "shkola" here means

not "school" but "shul" i.e. "synagogue" in the antisemitic sense of a
noisy, undignified place.  "Kahal" likewise is not a mere "meeting
place" but the conventional antisemitic word for surreptitious gathering

place for evil purposes (there was rumored to be a super-"Kahal" or
secret Jewish world-parliament even before the publication of the
Protocols of the Elders of Zion.)

Endnote 23:  "Peli" is surely General Georges de Pellieux, head of the
Paris Military Police, who conducted an investigation designed to
whitewash Esterhazy and confirm Drefyus's guilt.

Endnote 29:  "Lambori" is of course Fernand Labori, Zola's defense
counsel and then one of Dreyfus's lawyers at the Rennes court-martial.
He was shot and wounded in the street during the trial, but returned
eight days later.  His absence is regarded as having hurt Dreyfus's
chances for a reversal.

Subject: Dreyfus in kasrilevke

Leonard Prager's endnote 29 about a "lambori". The correct spelling is
LABORI. Lawyer Fernand Labori defended both Emile Zola and Alfred
Dreyfus. In 1899, Alfred Dreyfus was retried, Labori was requested by
Dreyfus's defense not to plead, in order to prevent any confrontation
with the army. Dreyfus was condemned again for high treason, sentenced
to a reduced ten year sentence and pardoned a few days later by the
president of the Republique Emile Loubet.

In endnote 4, Zola's famous front-page in L'Aurore was titled
"J'Accuse".

As of endnote 23 about a "peli", it may well be Charles Peguy, the
Catholic philosopher and writer who became a leading Dreyfusard,
bringing many fellow socialists to share his views of Dreyfus's
innocence.

Subject: Yiddish terms for an "apology" and a "deep apology."

President Bush and Colin Powell are "very sorry" over the apparent
death of a Chinese pilot missing since the mid-air collision.  The
U. S. is also "very sorry" that the "severely crippled" American
plane entred China's airspace without "verbal clearance."  Our country
did not express a "DEEP APOLOGY".

Question: In Yiddish, how do we express the word apology?  Do we
differentiate between terms like "very sorry", "sorry" and a DEEP
APOLOGY?  How important is an apology for a wrongdoing?

I look forward to hearing from you.
Marjorie Wolfe

"Don't assume you are fulfilling your obligation by working for the
greater entity, for so-called 'humanity-at-large'.  Humanity-at-large is

an abstraction.  On the world stage today are individual groups,
distinct peoples, differing cultures... We too hope for a common
humanity, but we shall never achieve it by destroying unique languages,
or by annihilating separate peoples, or by cutting down cultures...  We
have not endured these thousands of years in order now to forget our own

way of life.  We wish to continue it, so that we may unite later with
the company of humankind as equal partners"

Subject: "Great is the God of my disbelief"

Does anyone know the source of this quote? I think it's the first line
of
a poem, I'm almost certain it's by a Jewish/Yiddish writer, but haven't
been able to find it. Here it is: "Great is the God of my disbelief."

A shaynem dank,
