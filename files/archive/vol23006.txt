Regarding Avrom Karpinovitch's Vilna stories, one of them, "The Red Flag," was translated recently into English by Helen Chava Mintz and published in Jewish Fiction.net. It can be read online at http://bit.ly/12KZJEx.

Subject: Vi halt men shoyn bay zey?

In response to Stanley F. Levine's further question about this line, one could interpret "haltn" in many ways and the way Mr. Levine understands it might use "vus halt zikh bay zey" or something like that, but the whole expression "Vi halt men shoyn" means just one thing: I wish the day were here already ("shoyn") or in other words, "Oh, that the day were already here for them (the younger daughters)."  I hope this is clear, but I would be happy to parse it further, though I don't know if it will become clearer.

Yugntruf Youth for Yiddish is offering scholarships for students and young Yiddish speakers from Eastern Europe, Latin America and North America to attend Yidish Vokh, our annual all-Yiddish retreat.  Yidish-Vokh will take place from August 13th-19th at the Pearlstone Retreat Center in Reisterstown, Maryland.  Information about the scholarships can be found in English here
http://yugntruf.org/yiddish-vokh/scholarships/?lang3Den and in Yiddish here: http://yugntruf.org/yvokh/stipendyes/.
The application deadline is July 15th. 20

About Yidish Vokh:
Yidish Vokh is the only annual week-long Yiddish-language retreat. Every August for over thirty years, up to 180 Yiddish speakers from all backgrounds come together to create a community in the truest sense of the word. A diverse program of discussions and activities from tango to politics to baseball is led by Yidish Vokh's talented and knowledgeable group of activists, scholars, and artists. We are also proud to provide 
our many new and young families with a robust children's program, organized and available every day for kids of all ages.

As an initiative of Yugntruf Youth for Yiddish, we invite the participation of the young as well as the young at heart; of students, families, couples, singles, professionals, and seniors. For more information please see: http://yugntruf.org/yiddish-vokh/?lang3Den20

This year we are happy to be able to offer discounts to those who attend both Yidish-Vokh and Klezkanada. 
Contact us at yvokh@yugntruf.org for more information.

Please direct any additional comments or inquiries to yvokh@yugntruf.org

Tayere khaveyrim, Ver veyst? vos meynt dos vort MOGIZM?
    
I have translated the memoirs of David Shub "Fun amolike yorn" a two volume 1000 page opus published in 1970 by CYCO.
In an early Chapter he discusses a lecture series by Dr. Chaim Zhitlovski in 1904 in Russian [as a student at the Workmens Circle Mitl shul in the 30's I had the privilege to hear Chaim Zhitlovski and indeed he was one of the greatest orators I have ever heard. He was an old man by then but I can still see him, standing straight, a beautiful white beard, sparkling eyes and his Yiddish diction so gorgeous.]

"He was the most brilliant lecturer I ever heard," wrote Shub.

"The series was entitled 'Materializm and Synthetic Mogizm'"[sic] series of ten lectures in Russian by Dr. Chaim Zhitlovski on the theme: Materialism and Synthetic Mogizm." Although very few understood the meaning of the words synthetic mogizm, nevertheless these lectures which took place in the large Clinton Hall were very well attended." Shub never explains further.

[Moderator's note: The term in question is possibly "monism."]
