Subject: Alexander Meilijson

i have the sorrow to inform you that alexander meilijson of tel aviv,
formerly of santiago (chile), and originally from romania, died today in
the meir hospital in kfar saba. he was an active member of leivick house
and of the israeli assn of yiddish writers and journalists, and he wrote
often for _letste nayes_. he was a vibrant man, dedicated to the
fostering and recognition of yiddish arts and letters, and he carried
out his many undertakings with a powerful enthusiasm and a 'full heart'.
he was a very special guy and i for one feel very fortunate to have
known him. my profound sympathy to his wife nankale, his children, and
his grandchildren, and to his associates and friends in leivick house
and around the world.

Subject: tsi s'iz do a _do_ in _nishto_  :-)

zellig bach claims [6.142] that the adverbial _do_ 'here' is unrelated
to _nishto_ 'there is no'. I find this quite puzzling given that he
surely knows that the affirmative of _nishto_ is indeed _do_.

derfar iz yo do a _do_ in _nishto_ -- although conventional orthography
apparently camouflages it for some people.

Subject: "Do" iz take yo do in "nishto"

I beg to differ. My understanding, is that "nishto farvos" is
essentially a contraction of "es iz nisht do kayn sibe farvos ir zolt
mir danken" [there is no reason here (i.e. in these circumstances) for
you to thank me].

Subject: Who wrote "tsion tsion"?

I have been trying to find additional verses to a song known to my
family since the 1930's.  The text was in a songbook, of which only
fragments are left, and those do not include the song i knew as tsion,
tsion.  i still remember a few verses, but know there were at least
three more which i have forgotten.  in looking for this song, i came
across one entitled "tsion", with words and music by m. warshawski in
the four-volume anthology of yiddish folksong issued by the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem, in Israel.  Although the melody differs from
the one I know, the words of this song can be sung to the tune I know.
If anyone can identify these verses as to the one I know, the words of
this song can be sung to the tune I know. If anyone can identify these
verses as to authorship or has the musical notation available, I would
very much appreciate hearing from them. Here are the words that I
remember, perhaps with some I substituted because of faulty remembrance:

tsion, tsion, land fun yidn, akh vi tsit tsu dir mayn herts,
ven ikh derman zikh in dayn shaynhayt, nemt mir on a tifer shmerts.
yetst ot zaynen mir in golis, fun der heymhayt zeyer vayt,
un der tseykhn fun farfolgung hot geleygt oyf unz di tsayt.

heybt dem bekher, brider hekher, trinkt dem gutn carmel vayn,
mir veln nokh in tsion, tsion, mir veln nokh in tsion zayn.

ikh hof az yene tzayt vet kumen, az der kol fun shvakhn yid,
vet zikh heren oykh in tsion, in a sheyner yubel lid.
un fun shvern, langn golis vet er endlikh vern fray....

(I don't remember the last line, if indeed this is the correct
order).

Subject: Yiddish in pre-expulsion England

I have just finished reading Scott's Ivanhoe. The Jewish characters in
the novel are from time to time described as speaking to each other in
Hebrew. The highly accomplished Rebecca (one of the heroes of the book)
is at one point shown to be capable of reading and writing Hebrew and at
another of being able to converse in Latin. Such a talented young Jewish
woman would presumably have been able to speak Hebrew at least as well
as she spoke Latin, but even so I doubt that Hebrew would have been in
use in everyday conversation among the Jews of 12th-century England.

Could it be Yiddish (rather than Hebrew) which is being spoken in the
half-fantasy world of Scott's novel? Do the participants of Mendele have
any information as to whether there were any speakers of Yiddish in the
England of this period (about two hundred years after the birth of the
language) or during the pre-expulsion period in England in general?

And, out of curiosity, have any of Sir Walter Scott's novels been
translated into Yiddish?

Mendelistn lucky enough to be able to receive BBC Radio 4 may be
interested in a program titled 'The Joys of Yiddish'.

It is a four part series based on Leo Rosten's book of the same name.
The first part goes out tommorrow night (Wed, 18 Dec) at 11.45 pm GMT
