Subject: Chone Shmeruk (1921-1997)

I have just received the sad news that the great Yiddish literary historian 
and bibliographer, Chone Shmeruk, died in Warsaw on Saturday. He is to be 
buried in the Okopowa cemetery, in Warsaw, on Tuesday afternoon, July 8th, 
at 1:00.

Prof. Shmeruk was born in Warsaw on January 5, 1921.  He was the author of
numerous book-length studies and scholarly articles on early Yiddish
literature, Soviet Yiddish writers, modern Yiddish literature, and Yiddish
bibliography, and possessed skills and a range that can scarcely be matched, 
let alone replaced.  Prof. Shmeruk headed the Yiddish department at the 
Hebrew University, in Jerusalem, starting in 1971, and during the 1980s he 
participated in the renewal of ties between Judaic scholars in Israel and the 
West and their counterparts in the nascent Jewish (and Yiddish) studies field 
in Poland.  During his later years he divided his time between Jerusalem 
and Warsaw.
