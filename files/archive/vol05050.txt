Subject: Kroyvits

Max Weinreich discusses 'kroyvits' on pages 80-81 of Shtaplen (Berlin
1923) where [Elye Bokher is cited regarding] the acronym explanation for
the word given by Paul Pascal is a popular misconception, and supports
instead the other explanation Pascal refers to: that the word is a
"corruption" of 'kroyves.'

The altered pronunciation, Weinreich explains, stems from the fact that
French speakers, among whom Yiddish speakers in Germany originate, do not
distinguish between tsadik and sof. Weinreich translates Elye Bokher's
words as follows: "Es iz bavust, az mir daytshe yidn kumen funem shtam
fun di frantsoyzishe, vorem beys men hot unz fartribn fun frankraykh, in
yor [1395], zaynen mir tseshpreyt gevorn iber daytshland. zaynen
ibergeblibn in unzer moyl a sakh verter fun zeyer shprakh, un a zakh fun

Subject: Yiddish speaking jewish day schools

I'm from Melbourne, Australia.  We have a full range of Jewish day
schools here offering all levels of religious education but also an
option of a full Yiddish education where I believe the children do a
large part of their curriculum in Yiddish. This results in there being a
full spectrum of ages in the audience at any live Yiddish theatre that
there may be. I wouldn't suggest that the numbers are huge but we still
have a core of Yiddish speakers here. What concerns me is that from the
various comments I have read, it seems like our community is unusual - Is
there elementary school education in yiddish elsewhere in the world?

Subject: Teaching Yiddish to children

To Morrie Feller:

A blessing on your head for thinking in terms of di kinderlekh, of
hemshekh.

I don't know the Kinderbukh you talk of, but Yosl Mlotek wrote a text for
beginning children called "Yidishe Kinder - Aleph" which we used in the
Arbeter Ring. Lesson 1 begins "Motele geyt in shul. Gitele geyt in
shul...." and I always loved Mlotek for creating a first chapter for
kinderlekh emphasizing learning and a shul, for what is more precious to
us?

I remember the first lesson for beginners in French, the shallow: Le
crayon est sur la table. Le crayon est rouge. And the beginning La Casa
routine of mesa, etc. to starters in Spanish.

The Workmen's Circle number in New York is 1-800-922-2558. The Education
Department is very helpful and may suggest other newer teaching aids. You
might also ask for the Book Center which would bring you Steve Dowling,
meshpokhe, who is on Mendele.

Subject: Shepn un shlepn nakhes

At the urging of our shames, I wish to raise an issue regarding the verb
'shep' and the verb 'shlep.'  This came up in connection with the term
'sh(l)ep' nakhes.  When I was answering a response on Mendele, I defined
nakhes partly in terms of the phrase 'shlep nakhes.'  Noyekh said that it
was wrong and should be 'shep,' and he fixed it.

Well, as I've mentioned before, I don't hear very well (a great hindrance
in understanding and learning any foreign language, Yiddish included).  I
thought that maybe I had always heard 'shep' but thought I heard 'shlep.'
Then Noyekh thought that, no, maybe lots of people say 'shlep.'

So that's the question of the day: is it 'shep nakhes' or 'shlep nakhes?'

Whichever, it's still a wonderful term especially when you have kids who
are the type that you can do it!  Even if my daughter (age 20) thinks I
overdo it a bit!

Patty Becker

p.s. You could also transliterate shlep as 'schlep.'  What are the
preferences on this?
