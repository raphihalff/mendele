Condolences to Mendele colleague Victor Bers on the death of his
father, whom yesterday's New York Times characterized as both a
distinguished mathematician and an outspoken defender of human
rights.  Zol er nit visn mer fun keyn tsar.

Subject: Lipman Bers

I'd like to draw the attention of all our correspondents to the
death of Dr. Lipman Bers, father of one of our subscribers, Victor
Bers. Lipman Bers was scholar of high esteem and a man of unusual
quality and and admirable personal qualities. I`d like to express my
personal condolences to Victor and to his mother, Dr. Mary Bers. An
obituary appeared in this morning`s New York Times.

Mikhl Herzog.

Subject: Fencing and turtlenecks

Dear Mendelniks,

	I have the great honor of teaching one section of Yiddish
101 here at Ohio State University this quarter, and I have been
delighted by the curiosity of my students.  This translates to "They
are asking me questions I can't answer."  Perhaps some of you can...

	I have one student who is on the fencing team and would like
to use some Yiddish exclamation when he scores a point.  Kind of the
opposite of "oy vey."  Any other fencing terms you might know in
Yiddish will also be of help.

	Modern Clothing:  When teaching basic words for clothing, I
noticed that my students were wearing things that didn't fit these
basic categories. I need words for "turtleneck," "leggings,"
"sweatshirt," "sweatpants," and "sneakers."

	Gender for professions:  Do we have a consensus about how to
designate a female doctor, lawyer, teacher, secretary, et cetera?
In today's climate are we moving away from the suffixes (ke, in, and
she)?  If so, can I say di student as well as der student?  Di lerer
as well as der lerer?

	Both I and my students thank you in advance for your help.
If you prefer, send replies to me personally at

	ljenschk@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu

zayt gezunt!

Leah

I've noticed this type of pronunciation on the part of people in the
Yeshiva University milieu.  The komets seems to be longer than
_but_, however. An interesting point is that Y.U.niks pray using an
English "r" for "resh."

One question I have is why Orthodox people generally call the
pre-marriage calling to the Torah an "ufruf".  I would have expected
the more common "oyf" prefix (more common in America).  By the way,
Yekkified Jews do say "Aufruf."

Another observation.  There is a tendency in modern Orthodox
communities to prefer the Ashkenazic pronunciation in more formal
instances, such as in Bar-Mitzvah invitations, announcements in the
synagogue, all the while using Ashkenazic pronunciation in common
speech.  For example, a modern orthodox Jew would "Go to shul on
shabes," but would write "Shabbat Parah" in the synagogue.  As one
moves more to the religious right, even printed materials show the
Ashkenazic version, though Chabad is a little more ambivalent about
this.
