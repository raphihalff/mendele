Ach und weh! is (I believe) standard German.

Subject: RE: Mendele Vol 1.149

Re Yude-Leyb Proger's suggestion for transcription of my
name, I agree with him.  I never (consciously) write it
Melech, but I did usually write it Melekh, as a concession
to most of the people in my shul and elsewhere who wouldn't
know what Meylekh was (believe it or not). However, I agree
with Yude-Leyb that Meylekh is better (especially since I
always insist on Meylekh even in shul (but not to the point
of correcting people who say Melekh); so henceforth at
least in Mendele, Meylekh I shall be.

I would also like to second Yude-Leyb's suggestion re
adoption of SYR.
 
However, I hope he will forgive the occasional use of
nonSYRisms, since I usually hear what I have been told is
dorem? Yiddish and if the word is not one that I know from
print, I tend to store it in dorem Yiddish orthography in
my memory.
 
Meylekh.

Subject: Introduction

My name is Martin Davis. I'm a mathematician/computer
scientist at NYU. My parents were Polish Jewish immigrants
in the 1920s. (I was born in 1928.)

My parents spoke Yiddish to each other, but English to me.
Thus, my Yiddish hearing is much better than my speech. I
used to go to the Yiddish theatre on Second Avenue when I
was a boy. My favorite was Maurice Schwartz in "Shylock's
Daughter." I learned a little written Yiddish in a somewhat
progressive Chedar, but really have no formal knowledge of
the grammar. I read quite slowly, still not comfortable
with the alphabet, and am totally thwarted by vowel-less
Hebrew words.

I studied German in high school and college, and my spoken
Yiddish is inevitably corrupted by this exposure. (Yiddish
speakers easily detect the German influence.)

My Judaism is strictly sentimental. I'm a totally
non-observant atheist, and have been happily married to a
gentile woman for 40 years.

The level of scholarship of MENDELE is well over my head,
but I do find it interesting and fun, and I hope I will be
tolerated.

This is probably more about me than you wanted to know.

[conventional spelling and translation for the rest:

mon cher monsieur,
pouvez-vous lire ce que j'ecris? ca vous plait? sinon,
peut-etre que vous comprendrez nos problemes avec votre
orthographe. merci.

'dear sir, 
can you read what i'm writing? do you like it? if not,
perhaps you will understand our problems with your
spelling. thanks.']

p.s. and this silly little illustration was in *standard*
french! imagine our tsuris with your farkakte spelling of a
*nonstandard* dialect!

for yude-leyb prager:

you mention that the jokes you sent to mendele had to be
translated from 'ludic' yiddish into yiddish-yiddish. do
you still have the original ludic versions? if so, i'd be
very grateful if you could send them to me, since one of my
research areas is 'yinglish', the dialect of english spoken
by certain jews of a yiddish background and which i think
is the same as 'ludic yiddish'.

a dank aykh.

Two items: recent contributors may have noticed that their
names have been tacked on at the end of their messages.
This may make things a bit easier in the case of long
messages.  I mention this so that those who may have a
special preference as to signature will do their own
signing.

The second has to do with mail that doesn't go through
for one reason or another.  This appears to happen more
with Internet than Bitnet subscribers and a common reason
given is that the receiver's disk is full.  The shames
tries to resubmit whenever possible, but there are by now a
fair number of subscribers who've missed numbers.

If you're one of those and life is less than full for the
lack of every last pearl, just let the shames know.
