Subject: nadegele fayer

[Reply to inquiry in Vol. 25.007]

Candles and needles are often seen as  implements in combating demons and casting spells; so  I would suggest that nadegele is a unique diminutive for nadel, a needle or  a typo of nadele. the common diminutive.

Subject: "getting away with something"

Does anyone have a suggestion or perhaps even a source for how to say the expression "getting away with something" in Yiddish? An example for this expression-this kid gets away with all his trouble. Or-the robber got away with his crime.
Thank you!

Subject: kneydl un alke

As a child Mama made alkes for our Passover Seder chicken soup.  When we four boys were married, all the shnir called them kneydlekh.

It seems that Weinreich didn't acknowledge these "dumplings" with Mama's terminology.

Is there anyone out there who called these "lead balls" alkes? Mama didn't like floaters. She said the more shmalts, the denser it is. Of course she didn't use the word dense. She said gedikht.

Hello, 

I hope someone can help with dating four Mani Leib poems. 
They are from Lider un baladn (1955), where they are grouped by decades. The first three are from 1920-1930 and the last one fro 1930-1940. I would like to have a (more) precise date. 

"Du, mayn har"
"Di mashin"
"Ikh bin der riter"
"Zing shtiller"

Thank you very much,
sasha hoffman.
