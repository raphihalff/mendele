Subject: Yiddish books in London, England

In Mendele vol.5.230, Alan King wrote: A question:  Could anyone please tell
me where (if anywhere) one can buy Yiddish books in London?

I maintain a list of Judaica and Hebraica booksellers in the United Kingdom.
It is available at the following sites:

  ftp       shamash.nysernet.org/israel/ejin/brijnet/books/list.txt
  gopher    shamash.nysernet.org/ejin/brijnet/books/list
  www url   http://shamash.nysernet.org/ejin/brijnet/books/

It is hard to know what stock is being held at any time by any particular
bookseller so you may have to do some browsing or telephoning. Book dealers in
the Stamford Hill area (postcode/zipcode = N16 ___) are likely to have Yiddish
books in stock and to speak Yiddish too.

If you are planning to visit London in March then please see the entry for
Jewish Book Week which will be held during 10-17 March 1996.

The Friends of Yiddish meet every Saturday afternoon at the Toynbee Hall, 28
Commercial Street, London E1, at 3.00 pm. The nearest Underground railway
station is only a few steps away: Aldgate East (Metropolitan and District
Lines). Contact: Majer Bogdanski, +44 (0)171-488 3092.

The Spiro Institute is planning a Yiddish seminar to be held in London during
the second half of August 1996. I shall post details when they are available.

Please e-mail me if you need any further information.

Subject: Soviet Yiddish songs

Michael Shimshoni (5.233) adds a verse to the Soviet Yiddish song cited by
Iosif Vaisman (5.219).  I assume that the following, a fragment recalled from
my 1930's childhood in Brooklyn, is from the same song, though the _ay_s were
_day_s in my version.

Khaver Stalin iz gekumen,                  Comrade Stalin came,
(Day-day-day, day-day-day!)
Hot er undz tsunoyfgenumen.                And he gathered us up.
(Day-day-day, day-day-day!)

(Bob Rothstein:  Can you provide any more verses?)

Subject: Yiddish dictionaries

Is there a Yiddish dictionary--etymological or otherwise--that lists the first
appearance of a word in Yiddish, as the OED does for English?  As I mentioned
in a previous thread, I am researching Jewish connections to the balalaika for
a book that I am writing.  I would like to know if "balalaika" is listed in
any Yiddish dictionaries.  Can anyone remember if Sholem Aleichem used the
word in any of his works?  Thanks for the attention.

Subject: Pluperfect and other particles

On Ellen Prince's point about the pluperfect marker being a particle rather
than a verb:

In the spoken American English of many people, there appears to be a
irrealis-subjunctive particle * -a * , which derives from the verb *have*:

For example:   "You shoulda ran faster, man..."  "You shoulda went to the
store earlier, before it closed"  "I coulda ate the whole pizza if you didn't
ask for some".  For speakers who have this construction, they use -a +  2nd
form of the verb (e.g., ran, went, ate).  Note that when these same speakers
are producing straightforward "have" constructions, they use the 3rd form of
the verb, even when have is reduced:  "I've run faster before; You've gone to
the store too late; I've eaten the whole pizza--would you like an apple?"

Subject: Pluperfect

To Ellen Prince: Sorry, I got the impression that you were suprised that some
Litvaks werent auxiliary challenged.

I've forgotten how long it took Yehoash to carry out his translation; I know
it was a long and not very easy time. I suspect that when he was translating
the section where he used 'gevest' he may have been under the influence of
older translations. Most Tora translators, from Mendl Satanover on, have tried
to reproduce the sonority of the old translations and experimented with using
some of their special vocabulary as well.

Your question on the 'pluperfect _particle_' is a good one -- meaning I dont
have a real answer. I was glossing the yiddish grammatical term 'invaryant',
but I dont recall when I first took to considering the pluperfect 'gehat' an
'invaryant'. I cant find any mention in the literature. I believe the notion
originated with Uriel Weinreich and I heard it in one of his classes on
Yiddish grammar. In any case, in his dictionary, under 'gevezt', he calls the
form "a particle used in forming the pluperfect".

Subject: Comparison of rebirth of Hebrew with revival of Yiddish

Bob Hoberman in 5.232 gave a summary history of the Hebrew language and its
rebirth in Palestine. He ends his story with the statement: "So Hebrew was
revived because there was a need for it, people wanted to talk with each other
and had no other language in common". I have just finished re-reading "Tongue
of the Prophets" by Robert St.John which tells the story of how Eliezer ben
Yehudah struggled to revive the Hebrew language. And, "mirabile dictu", I got
a completely different picture of what ben Yehudah was faced with. There was
no obvious need for it, and the people were not interested in making Hebrew
their common language. Ben Yehudah had an up-hill battle all the way to force
the Jews of Palestine to learn and speak Hebrew. For further corroboration of
the difficulties which the rebirth of Hebrew faced, these will be found in
"Hebrew the Eternal Language" by William Chomsky.

Recognizing that efforts which are being made, and will be made, to ensure the
survival and growth of Yiddish also face difficulties, albeit of a different
nature than those which Eliezer ben Yehudah faced, there are reasons enough to
feel that in the long run we will succeed. One of these reasons is the fact
that Yiddish is not nearly as close to being dead as Hebrew was. If we will
it, it will be no dream.

Subject: Badkhn vs. marshelik

Sara Benor [5.234] asks about the distinction between badkhn and marshelik in
Fefers poem "A khasene in birobidjan".

If Weinreich and Harkavy treat the two as having the same meaning, we can
probably say that in the period their dictionaries describe there was no
distinction between the terms.  Another source for the idea that the 19th
(considering the literary sources Harkavy used) and 20th century Yiddish world
did not distinguish between the two is Petrushka's Yidishe folks
entsiklopedya, which mentions that the two words are synonyms,and also notes
that the first use of the word badkhn can be found in Rashi (!), and documents
previous appearances of the aramaic root *beyz-daled-khes* (freyen) in
talmudic literature.  Possibly there was an earlier time in which the terms
had distinct meanings, say for instance if the pompous figure of the German
Hofmarschall (Lord Chamberlain, according to my Cassell's) was mocked in some
sort of carnival/purim upsidedownday, and later that mocking role or material
or costume from it was added to the badkhonish repertoire, or both roles were
played by the same individual.  But that is not, I would guess, a distinction
that Fefer could make.

I suggest, instead, that Fefer is inventing a distinction supported by the
source languages of the two words: badkhn being a loshn-koydesh word, and
marshelik being of European (French?) origin.  Fefer is caught, as every
Soviet Yiddish writer was, in the impossible situation of having to reject and
denigrate a tradition while writing from within it, and not without some
measure (notoriously small in Fefer) of affection for it. Fefer here (my
supposition continues) seizes on the clearly traditional, loshn-koydesh word
and the figure it names as a target for his rejection of the traditional
world: certainly there would be no old fashioned badkhn figure in birobidjan.
But he is describing a Jewish wedding and it does have a traditional flavor
(and, by God, he likes it) and so he resurrects the word marshelik to identify
the non religious jester who entertained at the wedding: taking the
traditional role (but not back to its ancient, biblical roots implied by the
semitic name) and transforming it into something new.  Badkhns are identified
as part of the trappings of traditional clericalism and despicable religiosity
elsewhere in Yiddish Soviet literature at this time: an example is found in
the children's play from this period by Itsik Kipnis: "Di farshterte khasene".
Fefer knew the basic outlines of Jewish history, by the way, but his eye for
Jewish detail was not always particularly on target: in _Shotns fun der
varshever geto_, I believe, he describes a beutifully set seder table that
includes a *koylitsh* !
