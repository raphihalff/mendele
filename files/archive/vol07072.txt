Subject: The whole poem: Sutzkever's "Mayn Mame"

At Louis Fridhankler's suggestion, I am posting Abraham Sutzkever's entire
poem, "Mayn Mame."  This is my transcription the poem as published in
Sutzkever's _Poetishe Verk_, band ayns, Tel Aviv, 1963, pp. 265-269.

Khaver Friedlander has given me permission to post these following comments,
which he wrote to me, by way of an introduction to the poem: 
  
"Sutzkever's poem is a stunning, heroic piece of work.  To endure such
pain, suffering, loss, loneliness and horror beyond description, and yet
survive with mind, body and soul so much alive and strong is a wonder of
wonders.  Incredibly, he composed the poem in the very midst of and a
target of those unspeakable crimes.  He still could go on to create a
triumphant body of work.  I would guess his triumph was possible not only
because he is so gifted but because he had the strength and courage to face
all of that head on.  None of us who was not there can blame those
survivors who want only to forget.  How lucky we are, though, to have those
like Sutzkever who can teach
us the truth.

It hurts, but we'll handle it, and that's the way it is."

Mayn Mame
Abraham Sutzkever

Subject: khremslekh

While I never have seen knaydlekh made with raisins, as described in David
Herskovic's posting [7.070], it sounds like something I'd like to try.  But
khremslekh...that I know about.  My mother always prepared them..lightly
fried thick pancakes made of mashed potatoes, eggs and cinnamon...as the
nosh for us all to eat while we gathered and waited for the seder to begin.
 It was the perfect "neutral" choice because it contained no khametz (of
course!) and yet it did not include any matzo or matzo meal which we didn't
use until the seder actually began;  we didn't eat matzo from Purim to
Pesakh.  Their yearly arrival on the kitchen table (not to mess up the
seder table in the dining room) tasted to us as manna must have tasted! 
Thanks for the memory.  G'mar Khasima Tova to all.

Subject: Maurice Ravel's chants populaires and milodies hebraiques

I found on a new Cecilia Bartoli CD (Decca 452 667-2), at long last, a
new recording of some of Ravel's songs.

>From his chants populaires - the chanson hebraique, sung in Yiddish (Mejerke
mein zuhn), and his deux melodies hebraiques: Kaddish (original text) and
L'Enigme Eternelle.  These songs were recording years ago by Madeleine Grey,
but Bartoli's recordings are luscious, her kaddish haunting.  I would just be
interested in knowing, as I am not a native speaker, any remarks about her
pronounciation.

Subject: Food in song

To all who helped with fisnoge, many thanks.  I have managed to write an entry
for the Oxford Companion to Food, and also a small article on the matter for
Petits Propos Culinaires, a scholarly food journal.

The new subject which addles my brain is that of food in song.  Having
listened many times to 'Rumania' (and recently to Di Goyyim's wonderful 
version), I wonder if one can find any logic in the food items mentioned in
songs (almonds and raisons, mamelige, patlezhane etc) either individually or
as prepared dishes.

Thus requested are responses with name of food item and the title of the song.
Please translate any obscure Yiddish words into the englishe loshen.

Subject: Shlomo Katz

To my pleasant surprise, I saw a name mentioned in several posts on the 
Mendele List that I haven't seen or heard mentioned in above twenty 
years--Shlomo Katz.  Shlomo used to occasionally write to my late 
husband, who sent him one of my short stories.  Even though I was only 
in my twenties at the time, Shlomo considered that my literary style was 
reminiscent of the old Yiddish writers.  Indeed, many of my stories took 
place in pre-WW I Poland--mainly because I could not bear for this 
wonderful culture, so abruptly ended with WWII, to truly die out.  I'm 
not quite sure why, but Shlomo Katz, a fine writer, himself, in addition 
to being a translator from Yiddish and Hebrew, became the most faithful
of correspondents with me for several years until his death in the late 
70's and his witty, sagacious letters saw me through a dark period in my 
life.  Although there was an age gap of about 40 years between us and we 
only met briefly twice, I consider Shlomo one of the kindest and closest 
friends I ever had.  Such is the power of the written word, even from a 
distance (Shlomo in New York, me in Minnesota)to forge a bond between 
individuals who are different in many evident ways.

Subject: Yiddish in the news

Moment, October 1997, v22 n5 p34
Change in Yiddish?

Greater New York Savings Bank ATM machines use Yiddish for the transactions in
the 14 Borough Park locations. Who said that the phrasebook with "Git mir an
oystsug fun mayn konte" and "Vifl batreft mayn balans?" is useless?

Harvard Magazine, July-August 1997, v99 n6
Mame-loshn at Harvard, by Janet Tassel

Probably for the first time in its history Harvard Magazine features an
article title in Yiddish. A full-length profile of Harvard's first chair
of Yiddish literature Ruth Wisse provides interesting insights into her
scholarship and political views. The article with accompaning insets "What
is Yiddish?" and "A Revival of Yiddish?" is available online at
http://www.harvard-magazine.com/ja97/yiddish.html

Forward, October 3, 1997 v101
Der Yiddish Vinkl

Der Yiddish Vinkl in the last Forward claims adherence to the standard
transliteration. Alevay other Forward's departments join Der Vinkl and
avoid things like "tie'erer ainekel" on the first page of the same issue.

Subject: language and dialect

Alexander Maxwell writes:

Manaster Ramer's observation that Weinreich was "at least part of the time" a
linguist is absolutely correct, but he wasn't being a linguist when he claimed
that mideaval Yiddish was a language not a dialect, he was propagating his
conception of Yiddish nationalism based on a language.

My response: I dont think that is true.  Perhaps he was being a nationalist
AND a linguist. Solomon A. Birnbaum, who I dont think you could consider a
nationalist, took the same view re Yiddish.  And I am quite sure that I have
read any number of linguists who accept the idea of language and dialect as
social and not linguistic facts.  But I cant recall the references. This is
relevant to the following as well.

Alexander Maxwell further writes:

Anyway, Linguists as such aren't interested in this status debate over
languages and dialects. If you tell a linguist that Yiddish has a strong
'verb-goes-in-the-second-place" word order rule, just like German, the
similarity is interesting to him. If you tell him that Yiddish reflexives
don't decline by subject, but German ones do, that's interesting too. But
if you use such factoids to argue that Yiddish obviously therefore is a
dialect of German/is it's own language distinct from German, the pure lingust
shrugs his shoulders, whatever you say, buddy.

My response: Linguists like Ellen Prince and I--probably yes. But there
are loads of linguists who make their livelihood not by studying the
sturtcure and history of languages (or of Language) as we do, but rather
percisely by studying social attitudes to languages.  I dont think
they would shrug at all.  There are just a lot of different kinds of
linguists, you know.

Subject: languages and dialects

In reply to Manaster Ramer's and Slomanson's nit-picking with the criterion of
mutual intelligibility for distinguishing dialects from languages, I think
they missed my point. It was not that this provides a neat algorithm for
deciding -- and I thought I would avoid the tedious discussions by
acknowledging that from the beginning. My point was simply that Glasser's
claim that linguists consider the dialect/language issue to be purely
political was mistaken. If linguists consider the distinction to be
theoretically relevant at all, it is on the basis of a linguistic criterion,
not a political one.

As for counting Birnbaum and M. Weinreich among this set of linguists, please
note that I have been using the present tense. I have been talking about
linguists in 1997, individuals working today in a field called 'linguistics'
and who consider themselves linguists and who are considered linguists by
other linguists.  Sorry for not having made this little usage quirk of mine
explicit...

Subject: davenen

Sema Chaimovitz Menora asked about the etimology of "davanen". Here
is my entry in this respect given in the last H-Judaic Digest:

Larry Laufman asks for the etymology of the yiddish verb "DAVENEN".
1) Salcia Landmann proposes the hebrew word "Da`avon" (=sorrow)
2) Ignaz Bernstein proposes the english word "dawn" since the main prayer
   is at this time of the day;
3) Immanuel Olsvanger proposes the middle-low-german verb "daven" or
   "doven" (=to make a noise, twittering, warbling)
4) the best etymology seems to me the one also given by Olsvanger:
   from the hebrew word "daf" (= leaf, page) and the double ending
   suits the hebrew verb "le-dafdef" - to leaf, to turn the pages,
   here in the meaning of turning the pages of the prayer-book.
