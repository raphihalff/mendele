The gemore refers to yeshua ben panthera; I seem to remember that
this panthera was supposed to be a roman soldier (this last bit may
not be from the gemore).

Subject:  Bintel Brief

Although I am not at my desk (even YIVO librarians take a weekend
off, every now and again), I can answer Jesse C. Rabinowitz's
question regarding the Bintel Brief (in MENDELE 3.016) with a fair
degree of confidence:  Unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge
there has never been a compilation _in Yiddish_ of selected Bintel
Brief letters.  Readers interested in the original must peruse the
microfilms of the "Forverts," perhaps sampling them on a decade-by-
decade basis.  I do not know if there is a set of the "Forverts" in
the Bay Area, although I suspect there must be, since Prof. Moses
Rischin (San Francisco State University) has been working on a
biography of Abe Cahan, the long-time editor of that Yiddish
newspaper, and I imagine that he would have access to the microfilm
through one or another library nearby (try SF State, UC-Berkeley,
Stanford).

By the way, in addition to the compilations (two of which I am
aware) by Isaac Metzker, the YIVO Library has an interesting M.S.W.
thesis on the Bintel Brief, dating from circa 1930, by one George
Wolfe.  Also, as a kind of appendix to his thesis, Mr. Wolfe
prepared sample translations of Bintel Brief columns, taking two
six-month (as I recollect) segments, originally published in the
"Forverts" about two decades apart from each other (circa 1906 and
1926).  This was presumably done for comparison's sake, given the
different conditions faced by immigrants and their families at the
peak of immigration (after the 1905 Revolution) and after the
imposition of quotas on immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe
(1921, 1924).  The physical bulk of these two volumes is substantial;
I wonder if thesis requirements for a master's degree in social work
have changed since Mr. Wolfe's days at Columbia.

On another note, and seconding the thoughts of some subscribers to
MENDELE, I too would appreciate seeing the contents of this forum
diversified beyond purely linguistic concerns.  But readers must
recognize that it is in the very nature of the medium for an
electronic publication such as MENDELE to be driven by the interests
of those of its subscribers who contribute to it.  So it is really
up to _us_ -- and not some hypothetical "you" -- to bring literary,
bibliographical, informational, etc., topics to the attention of
subscribers.

On that note, I wish to report that a memorial gathering for the
late bibliographer Berl Kagan will be held at the YIVO Institute for
Jewish Research (1048 Fifth Avenue, New York) at 11 a.m., Sunday
June 6th.  There will be eulogies by representatives of YIVO, the
Jewish Theological Seminary of America, the Federation of Lithuanian
Jews, and other organizations.

Subject: Yiddish from Israel

Shalom:

I have some information that may be quite exciting and important
to you and your list members, and I would like to hear your
comments on it.

The Ministry of Education under the order of Shulamit Aloni,
in Israel has decided to put a big stress on the Yiddish
Language and culture in Israel.

In accordance with this, we hope, at Jerusalem One, to have at
our hands, a lot of information and resources. There is also
talk of setting up a newspaper in Yiddish from Israel on our
network.

Since this is news that has just been brought to my attention,
the facts are a bit sketchy. Even so, I would like to know if
you have any ideas on how we can take the opportunity in giving
Yiddish a push through our network. Please send out any and all
ideas.

Thanks
