Subject: YIVO archives

I would like to respond to Gaston Schmir regarding the motives of the
Lithuanians for wanting to retain possession of the YIVO archives, and to
perhaps clarify some other issues raised by the discussions in Mendele as
well as in the Forward.

As a Balto-Slavic specialist, I lived in Vilna for 4 months in 1981 as a
Fulbright lecturer at Vilnius State University.  I also went to shul
every shabbos.  I returned in 1991, just after the failed putsch and
Lithuanian independence.  I was able to witness with my own eyes the
revival of organized Jewish life.  I spoke to Emanuel Zingeris, and other
prominent Jews there, as well as renewing my contacts with Lithuanian
scholars. More importantly, I attended a meeting of the Society of Jewish
Professionals, at which the dramatic announcement was made of the
discovery of the YIVO archives.  In fact, since I had my video camera
with me, I may have the announcement on video.  The man who made the
announcement was a Jew who worked as a librarian in the Lithuanian state
archives.  He mentioned the need to sort and catalogue the material, and
the treasures that must be there.  He said he had found a letter from
Einstein to Dubnow.  He asked for volunteers from the Jewish community to
help with the job.  At this meeting fear was expressed that this material
would be lost to the Lithuanian Jewish community, transferred to Western
Jewish communities.

Americans tend to think that there is literally nothing left in Eastern
Europe, including Jews, and that whatever Jewish that does turn up should
be rescued and brought to America, where it will be "safe".  Of course,
compared to what was before 1940, there is precious little.  But there
are Jews remaining in Lithuania, including *young* Yiddish-speaking Jews,
and they are entitled to what is left of the Jewish heritage.  Consider
the following:

The Lithuanians are not interested in suppressing knowledge of a Jewish
presence.  I have seen many signs that, unlike with the Russians of the
Soviet period, a Jewish past is part of the "official" historical record.
Vilnius State University was the first former Soviet university to add a
department of Jewish studies.  Most of their students, some of whom have
already gone to Israel for further study, are *not* Jewish.  The YIVO
records would be valuable to this institution.  There is a Jewish Museum
in Vilnius.  It is in or will be in a building owned by the Jewish
Community in 1940.  Like all museums in the country, it is part of a
government agency or ministry that subsidizes and regulates museums.  The
YIVO records would also be precious to this museum.  Although the Jewish
community is tiny (5000 souls?), it is the last trace of authentic Litvak
Jewry; it is tending the graves of our ancestors.  If even 10 souls of
this community wish to retain the YIVO files in Lithuania as part of
their heritage, Lithuania, whose citizens they are, has an obligation to
act on their behalf.

Incidently, there are also c. 500 Karaites left in Lithuania, and there
is a Karaite shul (called 'knesse) in Trakai, as well as a museum exhibit
with a Karaite sefer torah, etc.  These are also regarded as Lithuanian
national treasures.  Would you ship them to New York also?

Finally, regarding the safety problem.  Living in Los Angeles, I am
familiar with the maximum security that the Jewish Federation building
requires, and the more modest security my own synagogue uses (inadequate,
in my opinion). When I was in Vilna (Vilnius, as the natives call it) the
Synagogue, the museum, and the JCC were open, unlocked, and unguarded
(and ungraffiti'ed). Given the world situation, who knows where precious
documents of our heritage will be safest?

Subject: A query about an inscription on a Russian medal

A colleague of mine has a medal; on one side are Cyrillic characters and
the date 1883, on the other an inscription in Hebrew letters, in four
lines.  The first two lines are, transliterated

H
Liberman [Lieberman is my colleague's name, and this medal belonged to an
ancestor of hers].

But then it gets a little puzzling, to me at any rate.

The next line reads,from right to left,

nun-vav-lamed-reysh, then a vav with an accent mark over it like a French
accent aigu, then hey-shin-vav-vav-langer nun (I'd guess this is
Heshvan/Khezhvn, so probably the hey is a khes).

The next line reads, again from right to left,

sof-reysh-khof-zayin (all with the accents aforementioned), then
samekh-lamed-vav-tsadek-kuf.

I'm aware that with the exception of the name, this isn't Yiddish, and I
beg the shames's indulgence to ask for help, on my colleague, in making
sense of this;  Mendele is so rich in diverse expertise that I sometimes
am tempted to treat it as an omnipurpose oracle.  Anyway, if anyone can
help elucidate any of this, I'd be very grateful.

Subject: Mentsh and psychoanalysis

For those who wish to pursue the question of mentsh(lekhkeyt), I would
like to bring to your attention the following articles in the December
1994 issue of The American Journal of Psychoanalysis (vol. 54, no. 4):

"Discourse and Self-Formation:  The Concept of *Mentsh* in Modern Yiddish
Culture," by Marc Kaminsky (pp. 293-316); and

"Commentary on 'Discourse and Self-Formation'," by Michelle Price (pp.
317-322).

Marc Kaminsky is Director of the Myerhoff Center, Brooklyn (affiliated
with YIVO), and Michelle Price is Director of the Treatment Center for
Incest and Abuse of the Karen Horney Clinic, and a faculty member of the
Mt. Sinai School of Medicine.

>From the editor's [Douglas H. Ingram] introduction:

"The self, increasingly subjected to penetrating analysis of the kind we
find in Kaminsky's essay, is earning its quotation marks: the 'self' is
inspected in Kaminsky's keyword analysis of the word *mentsh*.
Contextualizing and historicizing *mentsh* may render the word forever
changed for many readers.  More broadly, Kaminsky is inviting our
consideration of how a single word, *mentsh*, serving as a prototypic
example, can mediate explosive antipathies within a culture and within a
person.... Price is concerned with the implications for psychoanalysis of
Kaminsky's appreciation of multiculturalism, discourse, and narrative
theories.  She delights in the happy synergy achieved by postmodernism
and psychoanalysis."
