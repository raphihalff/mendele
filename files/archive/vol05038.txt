Subject: Af tzelokhes?

Could someone  please explain  the meaning and  origin of  the Yiddish
expression  "af tzelokhes"  (sp?).  I  know  that it  has a  negative
meaning but do not  know when it is used, what is  meant by it exactly
and what its origin is.

A dank,

Michael Shimshoni

Subject: Yugntruf: me farbrengt af Yidish

Calling all bipeds: You are all welcome to attend Yugntruf's second
annual guided Yiddish tour of the American Museum of Natural History -
starting with the newly-renovated dinosaur exhibit - followed by a
Yiddish picnic in Jurassic Park, er, we mean Central Park immediately
following.  We'll meet for this double activity on Sun., July 16, at
1:45pm at the museum's main entrance on Central Park West between 77 and
81st Streets.  (This will allow plenty of time for those touring the
Lower East Side with the Uriel Weinreich Summer Program to buy some Gus's
pickles and head uptown for the cool interiors of the Museum.  Just take
the "F" train uptown to "West 4th St."; transfer for the "C" train uptown
to "81st St.") We'll enter the Museum promptly at 2:00.  Brind your
Mesozoic "pay- what-you-wish" for the museum, and frisbees, food and good
Yiddish conversation for the picnic, and we'll see you there......hey how
do you say pterodactyl in Yiddish?

Shraybkrayz...Yugntruf's Yiddish Writer's Circle is for veteran and
aspiring writers of Yiddish, whether your genre be short story, haiku,
whatever.  The next meeting will be Sun., July 23, at 2:00pm at the
home/garden of the renowned Yiddish poet Beyle Schaechter- Gottesman,
3338 Bainbridge Ave., Bronx, phone # 718-231-1416 (#4 train to Mosholu
Pkway., or the D train to 205 St.; walk to Bainbridge Ave., 208 St.). The
August meetin of the Shraybkrayz will be Thurs., Aug. 24, at 6pm at the
Yugntruf office, 200 West 72nd Street, Suite 40, in NYC.

Calling all yiddish-song-loving-beach-bums!!!!  We will be enjoying a
Sunday summer sunset (roze shkie) at Brighton Beach, a late
afternoon/early evening of frisbees, eating, Yiddish singing and
"hanging" on the beach, including a Boardwalk walk to Coney Island. We
will meet Sun., Aug. 6, at 4:30pm at the Brighton 6th St. entrance to the
Boardwalk.  Take the "Q" train (not the "D"), which, due to Manhattan
Bridge construction, will be running on the "N" and "R" line, to the
Brighton Beach stop in Brooklyn (where else?).  For those who want to
meet in Manhattan and be beach-bound together...simply RSVP, call
Binyumen at (212) 989-0212 before Fri., Aug. 4.....remember to leave your
phone number!!

Yiddish Vokh...don't forget Yugntruf's all Yiddish retreat near the
Berkshire Mountains (NY) from Wed., Aug. 30 - Wed., Sept. 6 or any part
thereof (Rokhl just said she'll be there, why not you?).  Your chance to
spend one fun week in Yiddish-land!!!!  Call the office for details or
email myself, ruvn@aol.com.

Subject: Yiddish in Boyle Heights

Boyle Heights was for many years a Jewish neighborhood in eastern Los
Angeles where Yiddish was the major language of daily use and culture.  I
would like to know if any Mendelniks have knowledge or recollections of
those good old days in Boyle Heights and of their experiences with
Yiddish.  There were Hebrew schools, chederim, and also folkshules where
all was in Yiddish.  There was political activity, of all kinds, as well
as school clubs and social clubs.  Etc.  I'm working on a historical
study of this area and would appreciate your contributions and ideas.  A
sheinem dank allemen.

Subject: Feyder-Fraynt

Tayer Mendelniks un Feder-Fraynt:

Feyder-Fraynt is coming along reasonably well, but I have no way of
knowing whether assigned Feder-Fraynt actually made contact, or whether
anyone "fell through the cracks."  Please let me know how you are doing
out there.

I would also like to know if any other Mendelniks would like to have a
Feder-Fraynt.  Beginners and young people especially welcome.  Don't
worry about your fluency - I'll match you up with someone compatible.

putkevas eynikl".  Efsher hob ich nit rikhtig geshribn ire verter, ober
ich vil visn oyb efsher dos iz geven a Yiddish expression oder epes an
invention of mayne mama.  I believe it means that two people are related
like the rear foot bone of a horse...but I would love some clarification
from Mendele mavens of the origin and meaning of this expression.  A
shaynem dank!.
