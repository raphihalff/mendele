Subject: Pro-drop as mentioned in Yiddish grammars

Ellen,

Thumbing through Dovid Katz's grammar I noticed the following (you might
find other references in the book -- I wasn't looking specifically for
pro-drop):

p. 196

"Questions may be formed by inversion of subject and predicate.  The
predicate consists of the inflected verb.  Thus, "du kumst morgn" 'You
are coming tomorrow?' --> kumstu morgn? 'Are you coming tomorrow?'
When inversion results in the sequence of second person familiar verb
ending -st + pronoun du, the two are obligatorily conflated to ending
-stu (or, less formally, to -st) which is suffixed to the verb."

p. 166

"Imperative use of zoln frequently has a softer tone than the grammatical
imperative, implying friendly advice rather than a command.  Familiar
second person pronoun du is usually omitted and zolst used on its own.
When du is retained the resulting mood is one of scolding or warning (as
harsh or harsher than the grammatical imperative)."

Subject: Kibosh per Leo Rosten

Sheldon Benjamin asks (4.015) what evidence Leo Rosten brings for a
Yiddish etymology for "Kibosh."  The answer is virtually none, leaving
him stumped.  He cites entry after entry from various dictionaries, all
of them (with one bizarre exception) either NOT suggesting Yiddish
etymology or suggesting it without corroboration.  the exception is an
assertion by Alfred H. Holt in _Phrase and Word Origins_ citing a "Mr.
Loewe" as claiming the word is an acronym of four consonants
"representing eighteen pence."  Rosten, puzzled, guesses at an acronym of
"khai 18 britishe shekolim," but complains that he'd expect "kibRosh"
in that case.

His only other (unsubstantiated) association is with a Hungarian\Romanian
card game called kalabriasz "mispronounced Klabiotch by Jews."  That's all
he writes.

Regards, Sheldon, to Idie.

Subject: Tax farmer

Howard Kaplan asks (4.017) that I explain "in English" what a tax farmer
is.  The American Heritage Dictionary explains as follows:

"2.  _Archaic_.  One who has paid for and holds a concession on the
rights of collecting and retaining taxes."

This was a common Jewish occupation in Eastern Europe.  I guess the use
of farmer is in the sense of one who "reaps" the rewards or benefits.

As a student of East European Jewish history, the term was so familiar to
me that I forgot to "translate" it for the general public.  Sorry. In any
event, I was just quoting Beider, who makes the statement without
"perush" (commentary).

Subject: reply on "(to work) nights"

sorry- i was unforgivably shorthanded in my explanation of "(to work)
nights".

obviously "work nights" is a plural in modern english -- but it is
apparently a reanalysis of an older from of different status.  that is,
the historical linguists have traced (presumably in texts) that it comes
from an old genitive form -- much as in gm. where "nachts" is an obvious
genitive, the plural being something else altogether, perhaps "Nachten".
(the genitive may be special too, but that's a still nother question.)

Subject: On both Yiddish writers, the Singer brothers

Zachary Baker in giving us the benefit of information about a new Polish
book about Yiddish quotes a sentence in which the writer, J. B. Singer's
work is referenced.  Zachary's quote is like this:

"...J. [sic] B. Singer ..."  the "[sic]" having been put in by him and is
not in the original text.

Perhaps I misunderstand, but was there not a brother of the late Isaac B.
Singer whose name was J. B. Singer?  And if I am correct, then Zachary
may not know of this man and thus the "[sic]."

Now it is not that I am making a tzimmis over the use or misuse of "sic."
That is not the point.  But if I remember correctly, J. B. Singer's few
books (he died young) were considered by Isaac B. Singer as far superior
to anything he did.

I remember reading (in English) a remarkable book by J. B. Singer about a
Yeshiva student who comes to the home of his new rabbi-teacher and
procedes to seduce the rebbitzen.  Frankly, the chutzpadik of the plot
overwhelmed me and the writing style (even in translation) was hot as a
poker.  This was a major Yiddish tragedy with both parties coming to no
good end as a result of the seduction.  But the title eludes me and if I
could read Yiddish, I would go out and read it in the original now that
Zachary reminds me of it.

And while I am woolgathering on the subject of Yiddish fiction, I
remember having had The Agunah read to me in Yiddish and that damn near
killed me it was so remarkable.  It is also available in English and is,
I believe by Chaim Grade.  It is no pussy foot Tevye the Milkman story
about happy, happy Jews in good old Russia.  It is a killer tragedy
somewhere around the level of happiness of King Lear and Titus
Andronicus.

What is the name of the J. B. Singer book about the seduction of the
rebbitzin?

And what ever happened to Sholem Asch who was so very popular in the 50s?
