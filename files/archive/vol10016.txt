Subject: Getsl Kakaruze

Regarding 'Itsik Shpitsik's query (10.006):

Kukuridzhes are ears of corn. take.  eyner iz a kukuridzhe. And to add to
the confusion, many names we remember from the old country like Getsl, etc.,
are nicknames, like Moyshe der Royter, Brane di shtinkern, Motl der
shnayder, u.a.v...

Subject: Yiddish children's ditty?

I am a liguistics student at MIT.  There is a ditty in my family, that
mothers have told to children at least as far back as my grandmother's
grandmother, back in Milejczyce (pronounced Mileychich), Russia, a shtetl
near Bialystok.  I was wondering if any of you know of the ditty, and
perhaps know what language it is in (it may be garbled Yiddish that children
misheard and repeated, or perhaps something else entirely).  The ditty is
said almost in a singing fashion, and is accompanied by a certain way of
tickling the child's hand.  If anyone can help me identify the
language/history, I would appreciate it greatly.

Saku navu ranu
Kachkih navu drilla
Dimetele (x5 or so). (Generally followed by the Yiddish "kitzl kitzl")

Thanks,

Dawn Ash

Subject: lovitch

Jack Berger answers (10.013) Ann Szedlecki's queries:

     A 'lovitch' is some kind of an animal trap, and I suspect that this has
     the same general connotation as 'Ich hob dich in bod,' where 'bod' is a
     'bath,' but the sense is exactly the same.

The phrase is "Ikh hob dikh in LOYVITSH". Loyvitsh, Polish Lowicz, is a town
west of Warsaw. Every part of Eastern Europe appears to have an phrase
meaning "Get lost, go to hell," and in addition to the well-known "Ikh hob
dikh in dr'erd/in bod," there is often an equivalent with the name of a
(presumably not well thought-of) place. In the Warsaw region, if I'm not
mistaken, usage is "Ikh hob dikh in Loyvitsh."

Subject: amol

Jan Jonk (10.013) writes:

     The word 'almol'(almolt) comes from mhd 'alle mal' means always.

Is this meant to mean "ale mol" 'always'?

     The word 'amol' comes from 'ein mal' and means: formerly, once, once
     upon a time. The word 'ein' has changed to 'a', what is not unusual in
     german dialects p.e. ein tish/a tish, ein bisl/abisl, ein mal/amol.

"Ein" has not changed to "a" - it is derived from a dialect that always had
"a". Dialects do not derive from the standard language. On the contrary, the
standard language derives from dialects. It just happens that standard
German derives its indefinite article from a dialect with the form "ein" and
standard Yiddish - from a dialect with the form "a". Incidentally, another
standard language that derives from a dialect with "a" is English.

Subject: Weather forecast

Re:  Leybl Botwinik's post (10.013) about writing a Yiddish weather
forecast:  _Der Yid_, an excellent and thick weekly Yiddish newspaper
published under Satmar auspices, has recently begun running a weather
forecast, mostly in Yiddish, usually on page 4.  The title is "veter-oyskuk
oyf di kumendige teg"; in the body of the text a different term for forecast
is used: "7 tog veter barikht far Bruklin, Nyu York".  (I'm obviously using
the YIVO transliteration system which does not reflect Satmar
pronunciation...)

If a weather person is a veter novi then the forecast would be a
veter-nevue(s).
