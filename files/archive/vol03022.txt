Of course, the more interesting question is: what is the moker
(source, justification) for being misasek beinyanei peysakh (being
involved in things belonging to Passover) in mitl sivn (Sivan)!

Meylekh

Subject: Introduction

I've just begun my subscription to Mendele and thought I should
introduce myself to the chevrah.

I'm Avraham Frydman (Mendelenicks can call me "Avrom") and I
presently live in Baltimore with my wife and six children (kin ein
hora).  I was born in Deutchland nuch de milchomah.  My parents were
Poilishe (Galitzianer) survivors.  We came to the USA in 1950 and
moved to Milwaukee.  I spoke yiddish until I entered school and
subsequently only spoke "American"...ober eich ken farshtiyn alles.
My parents had to speak in Polish to keep secrets.

I went to grad school in Massaschusetts and lived in the Boston area
for 18 years before moving to Maryland three years ago. My
conversational Yiddish is very rusty; however, give me a few days in
Israel or visiting my Aunt in Brusselles and I become
understandable!

In the two issues of Mendele that I've already received, I have been
reminded of some of the idioms that were used in my home.  The
"toyte bankes" one is finally understandable!!! A shienim dank!!!

BTW- Are there some conventions re: transliteration?

Zeye Gezunt,

Avrom

if you're still reading this, please give my best regards to
yitskhok niborski at the medem bibliotheque! and tell him to try to
get e-mail--he's also at the bibliotheque nationale, where they
probably have it--and get on mendele! he's a mine of information.
bon voyage et bon retour!

one anecdote about the medem: the first time i was there was on a
saturday. I saw dirty ashtrays all around and asked yitskhok tsi men
meg roykhn. he thought i was asking because it was a library and
said 'yo, in medem bibliotek meg men roykhn.' i then stupidly asked,
'afile shabes?,' to which he replied, 'avade! shabes iz a mitsve!'

long live the bund!

Two bibliographies of Dov Sadan's writings were compiled and
published till now (1981 by the late G. Kressel and in 1986 by
myself). A third bibliography was compiled by me and will be
published by the Tel Aviv University by the end of this year. My
1986 bibliography has an index to phrases and idioms (Hebrew and
Yiddish) that were subject to Sadan's articles.

Subject: CPR for a dead man

I love Yitzhak Kertesz's paraphrase of "...vi a toytn bankes" as
"CPR for a dead man"!  The alternative saying he quotes from
Bernstein is also beautiful: "es helft vi a toytn an el mole
rakhamim", because, of course "el mole rakhamim" is davke a prayer
for the dead, recited at funerals and in shul as part of Yizkor on
certain holidays.  This is a parody of the "... vi a toytn bankes"
saying, while simultaneously disparaging the imagined efficacy of
praying for the well-being of the dead.  If an el mole rakhamim vet
gor nisht helfn a toytn, vemen vet es yo helfn?

Reminds me of a little joke of my great-grandfather's.  I have a
diary he kept (in charming Yiddish) while he traveled to Palestine
to settle there, in 1929. He describes the life boat drill they had
on the first day out of port, how they put on life jackets, went to
their assigned boats, then returned the jackets to storage,
concluding with the words that end the El Mole Rakhamim (but changed
to the plural), "veyonukhu besholoym al mishkavom, venoymar omen",
'may they [the life jackets] rest in peace where they lie, and let
us say Amen'.
