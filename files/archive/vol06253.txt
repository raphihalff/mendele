I fully share Al Grand's strictures about Rosten's _Joy of Yiddish_.
It is little more than a Borsht  Belt  travesty, in  line wih the
cheap Second Avenue Yiddish Theatre productions (of course excepting
Maurice Schwartz's), which used to send me into paroxysms of anger
whenever I was exposed to them and which I to this day  recollect with
something close to revulsion .  I once interiewed Rosten, I think for
Yugntruf, and I recall the venerable writer struck me as an impostor.

_The Education of etc._  had some good lines, of the  Bob Hope
variety--all not to be taken seriously, that is, not to be taken as genuine
humor.  As for the _Joy_, it  can bring joy only to those too lazy to
read a good book on the subject, such as Maurice Samuel's, an above
all that of   Benjamin Harshav, with a somewhat similar title I cannot
remember [_The Meaning of Yiddish_, U. of Cal., 1990].  Leyent es,
mayne tayere fraynd, un hot hanoe.

Subject: Cruel parents

Parents who are cruel to their children or do not care for them as
they should, are called in German "Rabenvater" or "Rabenmutter"
respectively. Is there a saying like that in Yiddish?  What is given
as an explanation?

Subject: Homentashn

Borukh hashem svet bald zayn roysh khoydesh adar habo oleynu letoyv,
un m'darf gedenken undzer heilige rabonim fun alle doyros, zal, un
iber al di vus men hot kimat fargessen, loy oleyni.

Thank God, Rosh Khodesh Adar will soon be upon us, and it is fitting
that we remember our holy rabbis from generations past, may their
memory be a blessing, and most especially those who--it should not
happen to us--have been almost completely forgotten.

In this connection, I think especially of the great R. Pythagoras, who
studied homentashn at the renowned yeshiva of Alexandria, the center
of Torah and mitzvos in his day, at least in khutz lo-oretz--and there
devised the famous theorem concerning right-angled homentashn which
every schoolchild knows without realizing its connection with Purim
and Torah.  He fell into obscurity because of a dispute that broke out
between beys Pythagoras and beys Hillel on a major point of kashrus.
Beys Hillel insisted on putting a U-O sign of kashrus on baked beans,
while Beys Pythagoras claimed--erroneously, as it turns out, that
beans of any kind are not kosher.  The other major controversy, which
led beys Pythagoras into complete obscurity (for a kherem was put on
anyone who followed their Shulkhen Orekh) was its claim that anyone
who revealed the secret that the square root of two is not a rational
number should be drowned.  Drowning, of course, was not an official
form of execution in the Torah, at least since the days of Noyekh.

R. Socrates, who had studied under R. Pythagoras, carried the wisdom
of the master a step further by concluding that the only true
homentashn are purely spiritual forms or ideas, while physical
homentashn are mere representations of the divine homentash, though
they taste better.

Coming to more recent periods, we should, of course, remember Hayyim
Wasserstein, who became known to history as George Washington after
his father landed at Ellis Island, and being able to write only in
Yiddish, was misunderstood by the illiterate immigration officer.
Borukh hashem, it was Hayyim who saved our nation and won the war
against Mad George III, a descendant of Haman Harosho on his father's
side, as we know from the great battle that became known as the War of
the Roshes.

Finally, Tom Jefferson, a brokh of zein kop, was named after his
mother Khane's zeyde, Reb Mordechai ben Yosef Hakohen, who was known
in English as Josephson.  Khane reported in her diary that Mordechai's
nurse (Mordechai was of course called "Moti" for short) was dyslexic.
She could never get "Moti" straight, and constantly called him
"Tommy," which stuck.  As a result of Tom's devotion to the principles
of the ADL, the AJC, and the other Jewish organizations he helped to
found, he was instrumental in incorporating into the Constitution such
important Jewish principles as free speech, freedom of the press, and
freedom of religion--especially after he and the other fathers of our
country had defeated George III, y'mach shmoy v'zikhroy.

Nu, zol zein a freylichen Purim un alle yidn zoln zein gebentsht durkh
di dozige zikhroynous fun unzer heilige gedoylim, omeyn.

Subject: A Japanese who teaches Yiddish in Israel

In response to Mehl Asheri's request in 6.248, I can name one Japanese
who has taught Yiddish to Israelis.  His name is Tsuguya Sasaki, and
he has been the associate editor of "Der Yapanisher Yid" which is
published in Tokyo by Yankl Halpern.  Tsuguya is working on his Ph.D
in Hebrew at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and I am reasonably
sure that he did teach Yiddish to Israelis while in Jerusalem.
Whether it was Polish Yiddish (which I doubt), or how many students he
had, I do not know.
