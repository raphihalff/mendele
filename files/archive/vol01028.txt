Subject: Introduction

My name is Harry Katz. I am a member of the National
Yiddish Book Center and an amateur translator of Yid-
dish literature. I learned to speak Yiddish from my
parents and grandparents, but have not had to use it
much since leaving home. As I never had any formal
training in Yiddish, and had to teach myself how to
read Yiddish, my knowledge of Yiddish is more or less
elementary. I find that I do not know any adult vocabu-
lary, but only the simple words that children use.
However I am trying to correct that.

I have been to a Yiddish Translation Workshop in
Amherst, sponsored, of course, by the NYBC, and I have
translated several Yiddish short stories by Afraim 
Koganovski and Zusman Segalovich. These are Polish
writers, whose work I found in an anthology called,
"Yiddish Shrayben in Poyln Tsivishn Di Velte
Milkhomes." I would like to circulate some of these
translations, but I am not sure what copyright restric-
tions apply. I need to contact the original publisher,
CYCO, to try to obtain permission to publish these
translations. If anyone has had any experience getting
such permissions, I would be glad to hear from them.

I am also trying to locate a book of short stories by
Zusman Segalovich called, "Goldene Pahves." The anthol-
ogy I cited above names this book as the source for the
Segalovich stories that I have translated. My only
source of Yiddish books currently is the NYBC, and they
have not run across a copy.

I am also trying to set up a newsletter for exchanging
information among Yiddish translators. This is a hard
copy print venture, not an electronic mail venture,
because I suspect many of us do not have access to a
computer or the e-mail network.

Received the copy of your dissertation, for which many
thanks. I'm reading, albeit slowly. (MENDELE is threat-
ening to become a full-time job.) I may encounter the
answer as I read on but, I wonder if you deal with the
verb-second, "dummy" IZ sentences, discussed by
Zaretski ("Praktishe yidishe gramatik", Moscow, 1926)
and by Zelda Kahan Newman (University of Michigan
dissertation, 1982, "An Annotation of Zaretski's
'Praktishe yidishe gramatik').

E.g., "bay di kinder ober IZ di natur nit zi shtarbt,
nit zi shteyt tkhies-hameysim uf"; "in frankraykh IZ,
di heldn matrosn, velkhe . . . ., matern zikh nokh alts
in tfise".
 
Would you send examples (in "real" language) of the
types of sentences you're now researching.
 
To: Melekh (Yiddish Meylekh) Viswanath
 
1. I'm a bit hung up on names. Please enlighten me
about yours.

2. Thanks for the comparative evidence from the lan-
guages of India. It's quite to the point.

3. In Western Yiddish, the distinction between leyenen
and le(y)zn is probably as you say. In the East,
leyenen serves for both reading the Torah and reading a
newspaper; le(y)zn, when it's used, is "daytshmerish".
 
To: Agi Segal.
A big "HELLO".
 
To: Noyekh Miller
 
Your earlier query about Hebrew and Aramaic words in
Yiddish merits a response. Soon!
 
Best wishes. M.
