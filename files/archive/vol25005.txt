Subject: Turkish nuts

I've been using eydes.de for many searches recently, and I've found that when the natives from Europe were asked what kind of nuts were found in their area, one of the nuts many mentioned were "terkishe nis". Does anybody know what kind of nut that is? Thanks.

Subject: kelmishn

Dear Mendele readers,

Can anyone perhaps help with the translation of the word â€˜kelmishn' as it appears in Dovid Fram's poem 'Reb Yoshe un zayn gortn':

"Dan kvelt er on fun freyd, vos shpart fun ale zaytn
Fun hartsn un fun dr'erd, fun kelmishn un tsvaygn."

Thank you,
Hazel Frankel

Subject: Yiddish translation of the misheberach

[In reply to http://mailman.yale.edu/pipermail/mendele/2015-August/000960.html]

A Yiddish translation of the misheberach for the congregation is in Siddur Beit Yisrael Ivri-Taitsh (New York: Hebrew Publishing Company). In the nusach Ashkenaz version it's on p. 238. It's probably in the nusach Sfard edition too, but I don't know the page number. I *think* it was reprinted every few years in the early 1950s, and it's probably long out of print. You should be able to get a copy of the book or a scan of the page from interlibrary loan.
