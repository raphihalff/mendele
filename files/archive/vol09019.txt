Subject: brief introduction

First off all I have to inform you that I am not a scholar. 10 years ago I
took a University Degree in English Literature and Language but, at the
moment and in the future too, my job has nothing to do with literature. I am
a subscriber with very passive intentions. I mean that I will hardly have
anything interesting to write to the mail list. 

My interest in Yiddish culture started when, much more than 10 years ago, I
attended a course about Bernard Malamud's works, held by Prof Guido Fink,
then teaching Anglo-American Literature at Bologna University (Italy). 
Until few years ago, I had few occasions to know more about Jewish
communities in east Europe - I red works by Joseph Roth, Isaak Singer, Elie
Wiesel, Sholem An-Ski, Salomon Maimon. Later I attended many Klezmer music
concerts and I have "fallen in love" with it.  I also loved the Yiddish
theatre performances I could attend until now (i.e.  "Yiddish dream" by the
Israeli Yiddish Theatre, and plays by Moni Ovadia - a Bulgarian-Italian
author/script-writer/singer/actor/musician). 

Best regards,

Silvia Paveggio

Subject: New Israeli Education Minister

Der nayer minister fun hinukh in yisroyl is yossi sarid, forzitz fun meretz
partey. 

The new minister of education in Israel is Yossi Sarid, Chairman of the
Meretz Party. 

Er iz a Khaver HaKnesset aykh itz. He is currently a member of Knesset as
well. 

Me ken im oysforshn un dergreykhn afn internetz. He can be researched and
reached on the internet (cf sarid@knesset.gov.il. ) 

Efsher iz kiday az mir mendelyaner zoln im shraybn un makhn eyfmerkzam afn
greys umyoysher vos yidish hot sheyn durkhgemakht un vos er ken ton. 
Parhaps it would be worthwhile for us mendelyaner to make him aware of the
great injustice that yiddish has already endured and what he can do. 

Ikh hob im sheyn geshribn un bet az andere zoln tzuleygn a hant in dem
inyen.  I have already written him and ask that others should roll up their
sleeves in this matter.

Subject: Bof'l

When my mother (aleva sholem) used to go to the fish market, she would often
purchase "bof'l".  I believe it is a generic term for any edible fish.  Am I
correct in my assumption and what is its origin? 

A shaynem dank un a zissn Shabbes.

Subject: The phrase "trowing a hate"

My mother, who came to the United States at the age of three, and grew up in
a Yiddish speaking household on the lower east side at the turn of the
century, was fluent in Yiddish, although she considered English her first
language, used the phrase "Throwing a hate" on someone, to indicate an
irrational dislike of someone that was usually irreversible.  I have always
thought that it is a loose translation of a Yiddish idiom. 
        
Does any one have thoughts about this?

Subject: The name Stambler

Recently I met a man with a rather unusual Jewish name, and I wonder whether
that name, Stambler, means "person from Istambul". I know that the name
Rimlander means "person from Rumelia"; is this name Stambler also a Yiddish
name of Balkano-Turkic origin? Any help on this would be much appreciated.

Subject: Yiddish printing type

I am searching for printing type in Yiddish or Hebrew. This type will be
used to print in these languages on a letterpress. I am arranging to have
wooden type created in these languages and, eventually, hope to have a
Yiddish letterpress shop available for doing quality letterpress printing.

Subject: Agadaic literature

The National Yiddish Book Centre has two collections of Agadaic literature:
one by Bialik and Rawnitzki and one by Zevin. 

Could someone familiar with both please advise me which one is better
written and which is more suitable for younger children. 

Also did Bialik write his collection in Yiddish or is it a translation of
his famous Hebrew work? 

a shaynem dank,

David Herskovic

Subject: Di Toyte Hasidim

David Assaf asked about the term "Di Toyte Hasidim", "which was definitely
used by the opponents of Braslav as a term of disgrace and as a curse". 

I can't answer David Assaf's query about the first occurrence of the phrase
di toyte khsidem

But I have never understood it as a curse! khas vesholem. 

The phrase refers of course to the fact that there were only two Braslaver
Rebbes (Reb Nakhmen and Reb Nosen) after which time the khsidem had to make
do with a toytn rebn - hence toyte khsidim.
