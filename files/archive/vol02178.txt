Subject: Introduction

I am new to the Internet and was browsing through some
listservs and chose to s ign up to yours because of
personal interest.

I work for New York State's Board of Cooperative
Educational Services, Regional Information Center.  We
support 67 school districts in Westchester, Rockland a
nd Putnam Counties in computer/educational technology.
We set up networks, pro vide teacher training in
software applications and create educational programs
using the latest in educational technology including
multi-media and telecommun ications.  Internet is one
of our new projects.

I look forward to hearing more from your group and hope
to be able to contribute.  My Yiddish education is
informal.  Yiddish was my first language.  It was
spokent in my home when I was growing up.

Subject: Etymological Dictionary Study

Further info on current research in a project to
produce an

Etymological Dictionary of the Yiddish Language

By Gurion J. Hyman, Ph.M.B., M.A., A.B.D.

        Using multiple resources to 'best estimate'
   origin of word (Germanic, Se mitic, Slavic, other),
   an intensive study of the 'word' in original
   language is made. After compiling 'all' information
   available, the material is separated into three
   sections (a) Dictionary Entry with evolutionary path
   (b) Cross-referenced to Dictionary of Indo-European
   Roots and cognates, where applicable (in planning is
   a similar section for Proto-Semitic roots) (c) A
   definitional section of Yiddish-English
   correspondence.

        Presently completed are words starting with
   'aleph-bais', also prelimina ry work on words
   starting with 'aleph-yod', as well as some with
   'shin-aleph'.

        Any information on Yiddish etymological studies
   would be appreciated.  A t present, the works of
   Weinreich, Wexler, Herzog, Katz, Hill, etc.are
   proving most useful.

G.J. Hyman is a retired linguist and former lecturer of
Yiddish at the University of Toronto

Subject: Re: "Ti nash"

Manger's sonnet. The words "Ti Nash" are indeed Slavic.
The meaning is "You are ours, or in Unzere Loshen, Du
bist eAIL: Unzererer. With respect to the second
question raised by mein alter chaver, the word *tsart*,
the word as my parents used it and as I believe most
literate Yiddish redendige used it was an adjective
"tender" or something like movingly vulnerable. However
I defer to my learned colleague az es kumpt tzu

Subject: dos vort "tsart" bay mangern

Many thanks to Reuven Rachlin, Alan Rutkowski, and Bob
Rothstein for clarifying "... gotenyu ti nash..." in
Manger's sonnet.  Can I now get help on the "tsart"?  I
still don't know what part of speech that is.
Weinreich gives "grief, sorrow" for tsadek-ayin-reysh
(TSAR).  Has Manger here made up an adjective meaning
something like "grief-stricken"?  Or could "tsart" be a
verb, "grieves"?  The punctuation suggests the former.

	R'meyerl fun premishlan oyf zayn altn shtekn
        ongeshpart Shteyt un vart, fiberndik un
        *tsart*: "Raboysay, lomir zogn ale oyf a kol:

	Bashefer fun di veltn ...
	... mir di galitsianer mekn dikh oyf eybik oys
	Fun der eyde emese `oyeve yisroel'."

Vider a dank.

Subject: Text for "The Adventures of Menakhem Mendel"

In June, the Montreal Yiddish Theater will present a
play called (in English) "The Adventures of Menakhem
Mendel" (approx.) by Sholem Aleykhem.  Would anyone
know where I can find (buy) the Yiddish text for the
play (not the correspondence).  I think if I read it
beforehand I'll get much more out of the play when I
attend.

A groysn dank,
Pierre
