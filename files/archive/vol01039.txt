I scribbled kapoyre, because I hear my father's radio
(NY WNEW) diction, with the oyre, the r in the throat,
not trilled. the thing fashlugt is the scapegoat too,
not so? the beast killed in lieu of...jk

Yes indeedy! I just received zeroxes of the manifest of
the SS Oropesa for 1922 , from my new mahktaynetse, a
DAR lady who dabbles in geneology. What did she f ind
in her Ellis Island search but the arrival of my fa-
ther, his mother, and th ree sisters, all from Bucha-
rest, where they laid low for a couple of years pend
ing emigration, after the Reds had proven themselves as
full of slaughter-lust as the Whites, on that East bank
of the Dniester. My father was kept from comin g in
1919 by his father, who went over first, sent for by
his elder son and eld est daughter, because as the man
said, You, Haim,will chase skirts and drink an d never
make enough money to get me out. He was right, my
father admitted, with  a shrug late in life, and a
smile to me. In Bucharest he worked nights making
cigarettes in an illegal tabac factory, and so learned
to smoke, idly in the lo ng nights. History!? So, these
xeroxes actually show a full typewritten manifes t of
all the souls in steerage and so forth. Most interest-
ing to see the ocular  proof, as itwere. JK

Noyekh, You're still dropping your aiches but, of
course, you're right about the "chicken-rooster". I
never performed the act (though I do remember witness-
ing it in my grandmother's house) but I should have
known it because the phrase you cite is the subject of
one of many splendid puns attributed to Bialik that I
cherish: watching khosn-kale under the khupe, Bialik is
said to have said (in "proper" sfaradit): "hatarnigol
haze holekh lamita".
 
As for "a sheyne reyne kapore" which some "lets" called
down upon the head of his bullying, uncomprehending
neighbor; challenged to explain what he'd just said, he
replied: "I wished you beauty, purity, and sacrifice".
 
"kapoyre" is a new one on me.
