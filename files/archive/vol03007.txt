Subject: Transcription and transliteration

koydem kol, I want to clarify that I was asking for reactions, not
_arguing_/asserting that 'yidish' should be spelt 'yiddish.'  After
reading the various responses, I realize that there are two different
questions.  First, in transliteration of a completely yiddish text,
should concessions to popular transliteration be made (as e.g. mazel for
mazl), and the answer, I think, is no.

Second, in transliteration of yiddish words/phrases in an otherwise
English sentence, should popular transliterations be preferred for
certain words?  This was the context of my original question, and ellen
suggests that the answer to this is yes.  Thus, we all write 'yidish' as
'yiddish' in an english sentence.  Perhaps the background argument there
is the one that ellen gave, i.e. for such popular words, what we have is
no longer a yiddish word, but rather a borrowing into english, and as
such, we should not be limited by yiddish (YIVO) transliteration rules.

The only question that is left is whether this 'rule' of using the
english spelling (e.g. 'yiddish' or 'mazel') in an english sentence
would apply even in a phrase that consisted of one word that could be
considered a 'borrowing' and another not (the case in point being
'yid(d)ish vokh').  Although Seymour clearly comes out in favor of
'yidish vokh,' I could see it going either way.

Subject: Yiddish lullabies

I am doing research on Yiddish lullabies, with emphasis on those of the
Holocaust.  Need sources for songs, papers, theses, interested people,
and other infor mation.  Orientation is psychological, but interested in
all aspects of history , personal recollections etc.  Need all help we
(my wife Lisa is prime researcher on this) can get.  Thanks.

From: "Arthur S. Abramson" <ABRAMSON%UCONNVM.bitnet@YaleVM.YCC.Yale.Edu>
Subject: Transcription

In my message of a little while ago  [see Vol 3.006], I failed to answer
part of Meylekh's question. My discussion of transcription vs.
transliteration, which made up the bulk of my message, thus possibly
obscuring the final punch, was prompted by his use of the term
"transliteration," which is not what the Yivo orthography is.

Subject: Avraham Sutzkever evening, Heb.Univ, 18.May

Of the three or four reasons for the Sutzkever evening, these were
named:

   a- the poet's "gvura" 80th birthday;
   b- his new book, the univ's publication of

Sutzkever's latest book, a collection of articles and essays (see
below);

   c- the poet's gift of his archive to the library, the Jewish National
and University Library

   d- recalling Dov Sadan's good name

Among other reasons, I might add:

   e- display and sale of other Yiddish books by the Magnes Press

   f- celebration of Univ's Yiddish Department and the National Library
and of Yiddish and Jerusalem...

   g- the aliyah of our Tel Aviv poet

At the dais sat the speakers:

  1. Prof. Avraham Novershtern, chairman of the Yiddish Dept.

  2. Avraham Karfanovitz, a Vilna childhood friend

  3. Yossl Birstein, the writer and chief Yiddish archivist at the JNUL
Library

  4. Prof. Dan Miron, (introduced as "the realization of Sadan's dream"
as the first native Israeli Yiddish lit. researcher; and who spoke
brilliantly though in Hebrew);

  5. Prof. Chone Shmeruk, former chair of Dept.

  6. Avraham Sutzkever

A reception began at 5:00; the talks began at 6:00; and the reading
ended at 8:45.  Yiddish academia and artists as well as students and
fans made up the standing-room only audience. (From as far away as Haifa
came Leonard Prager, a veteran mendele newsman.)

The two new Yiddish books published by the Hebrew Univ. Dept of Yiddish
and the Magnes Press:

  --(notes from their publisher's brochure, copying from the English
side of brochure; with minimal transcription from the more detailed
Yiddish side.

   (hefting these, their new print smell and the wift of Hebrew Book
Week, upon us soon, early June,

   (besides these two, on the desk, for sale, were about ten other
Yiddish books by the Univ. Dept., for example, from 1983, the Catalog of
the Library's Bio-Bibliographic Exhibition on Sutzkever's 70th
birthday... ten years ago!

   (a copy of the list on the brochure, the Dept's Yiddish publications
list, perhaps another day, but their address on order form is:

    The Magnes Press
    POB 7695
    Jerusalem 91076, ISRAEL
    FAX: 972-2-633370),

-- now as to the two new Yiddish books, they are:
1.  Chava Turniansky, ed., Di Yiddishe literatur in neintzen
yarhundert...> <Yiddish Literature in the Nineteenth Century. An
Anthology of Yiddish Literary Research and Criticism in the Soviet
Union.> Selection and foreword by Chone Shmeruk. (HU-Magnes, 1993), 595
pp.  ISBN 965-223-828-7, $29.

  >"This comprehensive collection brings together the most important
articles by Soviet Jewish critics on 19th century Yiddish literature.
Despite the ideological constraints, thse works constitute part of the
core of Yiddish literary criticism and research and excel in their
analysis of the linguistic, cultural and literary background of the
period."

2.  Abraham Sutzkever, <Beim Leynen pnimer...> <Face Reading: Stories,
Recollections, Essays>. Edited by Avraham Noversthern. (HU-Yiddish
Dept.-Magnes, 1993), 301 p., $15.

  >"This collection of articles and essays by Abraham Sutzkever provides
a view into his rich and dramatic life. It includes pieces on his
literary beginnings in the vibrant Jewish cultural center in Vilna
before the war, memories of his years in the ghetto and the forests,
impressions of Soviet Jewish life after his liberation and recollections
of his meetings and life-long friendships with Yiddish writers and
Jewish artists, like Sh. Mikhoels, I. Ehrenburg, and Marc Chagall."

I won't attempt to review the speakers, what they said and how each
kissed the poet.

Thanks to our Yiddish radio journalists (Anka Shamir and Mikhael
Ben-Avraham) and their tape technician, perhaps some of what was said
and what Sutzkever read can be heard on radio (for you, abroad by
short-wave)...

(and the Kol Yisrael Yiddish shortwave schedule, for another time).
