Subject: Introduction

I just subscribed to Mendele and, at Noyekh Miller's
request, am providing an introductory statement.  I'm a
second-year graduate student in Yiddish and history at
Ohio State; I'm working with Professors David Neal
Miller and Neil Jacobs.  I look forward to reading the
list.

Subject: idiomatic expressions

One that we use fairly often at home is:

"Vos shteystu vi a leymine goylem?"  (Standing around
like a (clay?) Golem [presumably when it had not been
awakened by the Maharal.)  Rather like "Don't just
stand there!".

Despite his much greater knowledge of early Yiddish
spelling than mine (non-existent), I find this argument
unconvincing.

First, if you want to say that the Hebrew initial alef
and ayin were consonants, you could with as much
justification say that an initial vav is a consonant
even when pronounced [u].  There is a clear grammatical
rule determining when an initial vav is [ve] and when
it's [u].  Why say that [adaber] begins with a
consonant and [udvar] with a vowel?

Second, even in the Biblical period, the consonental
value of alef, ayin, vav, and yud were beginning to
weaken and they were beginning to be used
(inconsistently) as vowel signs, for example, in the
'-im' plural ending.  By the Middle Ages, with very
unsophisticated knowledge of Hebrew grammar, I doubt
people had much sense of any of this.

Third, in Hebrew, ayin often takes patach where alef
takes tsere, for example, yoydea ('he knows') vs. qoyre
('he reads').  This would tend to associate alef with
[e] and ayin with [a].

I suspect the reason for the shtumer alef was much
simpler.  In Hebrew, grammar tells you when an initial
vav or yud is a vowel or a consonant.  (Actually,
initial yud can't be a vowel.)  In a Germanic language,
this did not work -- an initial vav could be [u] or [v]
(or perhaps [f]); an initial yud could be [y] or [i].
The shtumer alef distinguished between them.  It was
also used in the middle of words to resolve
ambiguities, even where Yivo found it unnecessary
centuries later.

I have no idea why alef was chosen, rather than ayin.
Perhaps further discussion could shed some light on
this.

In any case, it appears that the answer to my original
question: why write alef-yud-daled for [yid], is that
it was in fact pronounced by many as [id].

Subject: Re: Opatoshu

I am really sorry. I didn't mean to offend anyone by
suggesting that no reaction is equal to showing no
interest in, or worse, ignorance of Opatoshu. I know
that the stories by Joseph Opatoshu are worth reading
and writing about (and I see most of you do). That is
why I asked for your help in the first place. It really
suprised me that no one answered my first query. Maybe
it wasn't wise, but I tried the provocative method.
And, it worked. I am sorry that some of you felt
offended.

Thanks a lot for the suggestions (incl. Margaret's
private mail)!

Subject: Nar/Naronim

I wonder if the plural of nar, which is, after all, a
fairly expressive noun, might not be influenced more
directly by expressive forms of Hebrew origin which
have the derivational suffixal -n, e.g.,kabtsn/
kabtsonim, batlen/batlonim, perhaps shdkhn/shadkhonim,
etc. It further seems that perhaps with the exception
of dokter/doktoyrim, the use of the -im plural with
non-Hebrew-Aramaic stems is expressive: tayvl/tayvolim,
poyer/poyerim. Whether fakter/faktoyrim 'agent' is
expressive or not, I have no idea.
