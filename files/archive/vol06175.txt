Subject: Prokofiev's Jewish connection

Dan Leeson, in Vol 6. l7l, questions my source for Bellison's connection
with Prokofiev.  My information is based on Nakhmen Meisil's "Yidishe
tematik un yidishe melodyes bay barimte muziker," Yiddisher Kultur
Farband, NY, l952. Meisil writes: "Der bavuster muziker, der klarnetist
Shimen Belison (Geb. l88l-), oyf mayn onfreg, hot mir in zayn briv funem

Subject: Yehoash Bible translation

Al Grand [6.170] has responded to Lisa Tomlinson's request for
information of the translation of the Tanakh into Yiddish by Yehoash. In
the meantime, I had told her of an earlier edition than his, although I
have only Vol. 1 of it.

In 1941 the newspaper Der Morgen Jhurnal put out an edition of it. The
copyright is assigned to Yehoash Farlag Gezelshat. Vol. 1 goes from
Bereyshis through Melokhim beys.

Al's description fits miy copy, so it may have been printed from the
same plates. In that case, I suggest that he look at the back of the
book. He should find a section of rabbinical commentaries in Hebrew.

Subject: Grine verem

The phrase in which this expression was cited [by Mechl Asheri (6.171)],
es kumt on mit grine verem, reminds me of the expression familiar to
many of us, es kumt on mit grine gal. Anyone cares to carry it further??

Subject: Interrogative intonation

Re Arn Abramson's point (6.172) about interrogative intonation in
English and Yiddish, I'm not totally convinced that it's the same in
(American) English as in German.

I should admit right off that I haven't worked with informants and that
I'm probably more heavily influenced than I realize by New York
intonations (although I do say "a TEN-dollar-BIll" rather than New
Yorkish "a ten-DOLLar-bill).  My feeling is, however, that when the
voice goes down at the end of an English question, the feeling is a bit
harsher and more peremptory than in German or when the voice rises in
English.  If a store salesman asks "May I help you" with a downward
pitch, I feel like a shoplifter.  But if his pitch rises, I feel more
welcome. If an American asks me "Do you speak Russian" with a downward
pitch, I feel as if I'm being interviewed for a job.  If his voice goes
up at the end of sentence, then he's simply asking a friendly question.
In German, however, the voice goes down either way, whether it's a
policeman or the head of my local fan club:  "Sprechen Sie denn
russisch?"  As for Yiddish,  I really shouldn't generalize.  But I do
have the impression that there's a lot more singsong and a more emphatic
rising inflection in "Galician" Yiddish than in standard Yiddish.

Ultimately, however, there is such a wide gammut of nuances in the
inflections of all three languages, that it might take a whole textbook
to sort them out.

My point was that when discussing any linguistic element, such as
syntax, one has to see it connection with the lexicon and the intonation
(as well as myriad other elements such as gestures and facial
expressions, etc.).
