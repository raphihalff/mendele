Subject: Introduction

I am a professor emeritus at the University of California, Hastings
College of the Law in San Francisco, having "retired" from active law
teaching four years ago (although I am still active as a labor
arbitrator).  During my 30 years of teaching, I was also on the law
faculties of Saint Louis University (1 year) and the University of New
Mexico (8 years).  As a visiting professor, I taught at the following
university law schools:  Harvard, Michigan, North Carolina, Texas,
Washington U. in Saint Louis, Grenoble and Nantes.  I've also lectured on
American labor law in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Switzerland and various
French-speaking countries in Africa:  Benin, Togo, Gabon and Cameroon.
Among my 12 published books are:  Women and the Law:  The Unfinished
Revolution (1969), which sold 55,000 copies; Alternative Dispute
Resolution (1985); and a translation from the Japanese of a labor law
treatise by Kazuo Sugeno of the University of Tokyo Law Faculty, entitled
"Japanese Labor Law" (1992).

Although I am proficient in several languages, (French, Japanese, German,
etc.), my Yiddish needs much work.  Before entering the U.S. Army during
WWII, I was taught by my father to read and write Yiddish so that we
could correspond while I was away.  Yiddish was also our language at home
in the Bronx.  That was over 50 years ago, and I have rarely used it
since.  Having discovered Mendele only recently, I look forward to
relearning Yiddish.  Because my Yiddish has grown rusty, I suspect that
my "contribution" to the discussion will be rather limited for a while,
and will consist more of questions -- I am submitting one as a separate
message today -- than of answers.

Subject: A sakh zakhn

I was surprised to learn of the Yiddish word sakh being derived from the
Hebrew. I too always "sensed" that is was related to the German sakh
(thing), since it occured so frequently in combination with it; as in "Oy
hob ikh a sakh zakhn tsu ton!"

On a related point, I sensed that my mother's Yiddish made a distinction
in usage between a continuous set and a discrete set of things, much as
is done in English; e.g. "I have much milk" ; but, "I have many cookies".
Or: "I have less milk" but, "I have fewer cookies." I similarly recall
"Ikh hob fihl tsu ton", but "Ikh hob a sakh sakhn tsu ton"; and
eventually by elipsis "Ikh hob a sakh tsu ton" with _zakhn_ implied. Is
this idiosyncratic or do others sense this distinction? (Incidently, the
more coloquial translation of "a sakh", "a lot of", does not respect the
distinction so carefully adhered to formal English.)

Subject: A sakh

I would take issue with Mr. Helfgott's derivation of "a sakh" from the
German Sache.  I believe the origin is from the Hebrew "sakh"
(samekh-khof) meaning total, or number.  When the expression "a sakh" is
written in Yiddish, it is always spelled as in Hebrew -- samekh-khof.

By any count, "long" or "short", _khes_ is 8, not 9.  [See 5.029]
I erred. I apologize. Forgive me.

Subject: Ribe

Who would have thought that Afn Pripetchik would have generated
such a strong response?  For what it's worth my father used to
speak about a shelf over the oven.  He called that shelf a "ribe."
I can still hear him saying, "Vi geshmak s'fleyg zayn tsu shlofn
af der ribe."

Subject: More on Tevye

Sholem Aleichem writes Tevye in the ambiguous ktav Haser [contracted
form] tet-bet-yod-heh, leaving the vowel sounding between the tet and the
bet up for grabs, ah, e, ey, oh, u.

I reviewed my video tapes of Tevye scenes.  Maurice Schwartz, in his 1937
movie _Tevye der Milkhedicher_ clearly uses Tevye throughout.

On the other hand, Shimon Dzigan, in Israel after the second war is
uncomfortable with this pronounciation and uses Toyva.

More confusion.

Subject: Yiddish and German

Many years ago I read or heard somewhere that Yiddish and German were
both variants of an earlier Germanic language; that Yiddish "stabilized"
earlier than German; and that modern-day Yiddish can, therefore, be
traced back further to its roots than modern-day German.  By "stabilize,"
I take it, was meant that the changes which followed were of a
_relatively_ minor character.  I assume this applied only to the
proto-Germanic elements of Yiddish, and not to words of Slavic or
Hebrew-Aramaic origin.  Is there any merit to this description of the
history of the two languages?

Subject: Our feelings for Yiddish are not irrational

a)  I join with Harvey Spiro (5.025,1) in his protest against the local
(Vienna, Georgia) United Jewish Appeal Committee for its reckless
disparaging of Yiddish.

In its recent Newsletter the Committee profiled two U.J.A. activists of
the area, and gave their "favorite Yiddish expressions" and Jewish
culinary preferences, as if these two aspects were the essential
ingredients of Jewishness. In my recent "Genghis Cohn" post (5.019,4) I
pointed out the grotesque side of such a minimalized, watered-down,
diluted view of Jewishness. Harvey supposes that neither of the two
activists are native speakers, and he is particularly outraged at the
mangled, shamelessly misspelled "favorite" expression of one of them,
namely: "Svayir suit sain i yid" (sic) [shver tsu zayn a yid]. I hope
Harvey sent his protest to the local U.J.A. Committee, as well as to the
U.J.A. Headquarters in New York.

b) In the same post Harvey wrote:

> Although I have strong (admittedly irrational) feelings about Yiddish...>

Why irrational?

I am positive that many members of the Mendele khavruse have similar
strong feelings about Yiddish, but do not consider them irrational.

While both emotion and reason, its evolutionary descendant, lent survival
advantages to cerebral man, the fact that an emotional overlay is
laminated, so to speak, to a well-reasoned, logical rationale for the
love of Yiddish, does not _ipso facto_ make it irrational.

We have a wealth of weighty _reasons_ to be deeply concerned about
Yiddish, and at the very same time feel a strong _emotional_ bond to it.
One does not necessarily nullify, or even neutralize, the other.  They
can and do coexist in a strong alliance, one enhancing the other and
reciprocally strengthening each other.
