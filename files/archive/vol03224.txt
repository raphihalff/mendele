Subject: Marija Gimbutas

I wanted to share with mendeleans some thoughts on the passing of
Marija Gimbutas, a close personal friend, who passed away last Wed
night in Los Angeles.  By this time some of you may have read her
obituary in the New York Times or elsewhere.  The LA Times ran an
editorial-obit as well as a regular obit.  But I'd like to put on
the record some small things that won't be in the public record
otherwise.

Marija Gimbutas, one of the two or three most eminent Lithuanian
emigre scholars, was my first Lithuanian teacher, when she came to
UCLA in 1963. I was the only non-ethnic Lithuanian in the class, and
quickly established myself as the best student, which of course,
endeared me to her.  My continuing to study Lithuanian and Baltic
linguistics on my own as part of my grad studies served to cement a
close friendship.  She always asked about my work in Baltic, and
clearly got naches from my acceptance as a Balticist in Lithuania.
I also got lots of koved in Lithuania from her being my teacher and
friend.

Marija was born in Vilna, into one of the rare Lithuanian
intelligentsia families.  Her father was a doctor.  Lithuanians then
were a tiny minority in Vilna, which  was politically Polish and
ethnographically Yiddish.  Many of her father's patients were Jews,
who brought food as payment.  Like many Lithuanians, she was
nostalgic about Jewish cooking (yes I know, its hard to believe:
when people ask me about Lithuanian cuisine I remark that one can
judge it from the fact that the Lithuanians seem to be the only East
Europeans who have borrowed dishes from the Jews.  "Kugelis" was a
mainstay of the University cafeteria back in 1981...)  When I
would visit her I would always bring shmaltz herring and Jewish rye.
She always kept a box of matzos; when I was in Vilna in '81, half
the 5000 pesach matzoh orders sold by the synagogue were sold to
Lithuanians, many of them from villages where during that season the
Jewish crackers were the only bread available.

We were a strange friendship perhaps, especially after she became
prominent as the creator of the "Goddess" cult/movement.  Cf her
books "Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe", "The Goddess", etc.  She
actually was an Indo-European archeologist who developed her theory
as a scientific hypothesis, not intending to feed a cult movement.
But in the last few years she came to be so hailed and adored in
these circles that some of it perhaps got to her.  But she herself
was definitely a Lithuanian culture and tradition person, and that
is certainly Indo-European in character.  Anyway, I, a more or less
observant Jew, found myself sometimes in what was an exclusively
woman's circle of her closest friends, but she always greeted and
hugged me like a son when I came over. In 1981 the local Soviet
Lithuanian authorities turned down my oft-repeated request to visit
my grandparents' home village, since Lithuanian American visiters
were being given escorted tours of THEIR ancestral villages.  The
loud but futile protests I made must have gotten around in that
small country.  Around 1990 I met a visitor from Lithuania at
Marija's house in LA.  She knew who I was, and told me "the problem
you had is gone; come back and you can go where you want..."  And so
it was.

Subject: European Jewry

I wish my Turkic-looking grandmother had lived to learn of the
possibile Khazarian traces in her part of Ukraine:  It may have
relieved her embarrassment about a Tatar rapist in the family tree!

I hadn't heard of disabetes being particularly a "Jewish" disease. 
Is this statistically true?
