Subject: Zalman Schneour

I'm editing a book called Jewish Writers of the Twentieth Century to be
published in May by Fitzroy Dearborn . At the last moment, I've been let

down, and have a fine writer in search of a contributor.

Could you perhaps find someone who could write a 1000 word essay on
Zalman
Shneyer (Shneour). The essay should focus on his work, you can quote
from
it, and make comments, but the essay should not be biographical because
it
will be preceded in the book by a brief bio, list of reading and
suggestions for further reading (prepared by me).  Payment is a token I
know (copy of the book selling at #65 or #35)  but I would be very
grateful to you. The only problem is time...The essay would be due as
soon
as you could do it...in a week or so maximum...as we go to press in May.

Please let me know if you can help,
Best wishes,

Sorrel Kerbel

Subject: the Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry; Yiddish
course

Dear fellow Mendelyaners,

We are happy to report to you that a small portion of interviews from
the Yiddish Atlas collections (=Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic

Jewry, housed at the Rare Book Collections of The Columbia University
Libraries, New York City) is available now for study over the Internet.
The materials are the core piece of a self teaching Yiddish course
geared to speakers of German. The course is the result of a research
project, co-funded by the European Union, and was initiated and carried
out by the Duesseldorf-based Association for the Promotion of Yiddish
Language and Culture (=Foerderverein fuer Jiddische Sprache und Kultur
e.V.).
The course is equipped with a discussion board. Please feel free to
enter any questions and comments about the materials, the course in
general, individual sections, methods etc. Please don't feel impeded by
German, you may of course write in Yiddish, English, or any other
language you feel most comfortable in.

The Yiddish course is accessible via:
www.jiddischkurs.org <http://www.jiddischkurs.org>.

Subject: Yiddish in Berlin

In response to Ingedore Ruedlin's query [10.046] about Yiddish
literature
based on experiences in Berlin, Moyshe Kulbak published some important
work when he lived there in the early 1920s. Later, in Minsk in the
1930s,
he wrote a long poem, "Disner tshayld harold," explicitly about those
years.

From: "Levitsky, Gennady" <GLEVITSKY@LROC.HARVARD.EDU>
Subject: Origins of some Yiddish words

Some Yiddish words do not come from Hebrew, German or Slavic languages.
Few
examples (that I can think of) are: "a bisl", "a sach", "chvalie",
"parnose"
(I guess), "opru" ...(although "opru" could be from Czech word "opira").

Does anybody know how these words originated? Where they are coming
from?

From: David Gil <gil@eva.mpg.de>
Subject: tsk tsk: a query

Happy Passover everybody.

I have a question about the speech sound which in English is written
either "tsk tsk" or "tut tut" (phoneticians call it a "dental click").
In English and other European languages, it is used to express various
negative feelings of impatience, disapproval, disgust, prohibition, and
so forth.  However, I have heard that in Yiddish it has an opposite
positive meaning.  Is this true?  If so, how would you use it?

Also, somebody mentioned to me a "famous anecdote of the man who is a
'tsitser' by profession. Whenever the Rabbi does a miracle in public he
will stand by and do the 'tsk-tsk'..."  Can anybody corroborate this
story, and perhaps provide references?

Thanks,

David Gil

PS For the linguists:  I am doing a cross-linguistic survey of click
sounds and their usages.  So far, the only instances of "tsk tsk" with
positive affective meaning that I've come across have been from
southeast Asia and Melanesia -- which is why I found this reference to
Yiddish so intriguing.

Subject: Prufrock

Ezra Mendelsohn asked for a source for the text of the Saul Bellow/Isaac

Rosenfeld Yiddish version of Eliot's Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.
It
appears in a paper by Ruth R. Wisse entitled "Language as Fate:
Reflections on Jewish Literature in America", a paper published in the
1996 Studies in Contemporary Jewry (Vol. 12), pages 129-147, Oxford
University Press.  The volume is subtitled Literary Strategies: Jewish
Texts and Contexts.  As this volume is not easily accessible, and
because
I thought other Mendelyaners might be interested in it, here it is:

Der shir hashirim fun Mendl Pumshtok

Nu-zhe, kum-zhe, ikh un du,

Ruth Wisse (b'sheim omro) says that she got these lines from Lucy
Dawidowicz, who got them from Chaim Raphael, who got them from Daniel
Bell.
Alas, I could not find the original in any of Saul Bellow's papers on
deposit at the University of Chicago library.  Bellow assisted Isaac
Rosenfeld in its composition, and I could not find the original in any
of
Rosenfeld's books.  Thus this is, as Ruth Wisse says, an oral tradition
that she finally recorded on paper.
