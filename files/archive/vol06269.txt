Subject: "Frumele" un "Bald vet geyn a regn"

We are looking for a source for the music and lyrics for two Yiddish
songs: Frumele, and bald vet geyn a regn.  Alternatively, if anyone
has the music and lyrics for these two songs and is willing to
photocopy and mail that to me, I'll e-mail my mail address.  Thanks
for any help.

Subject: Second Commandment

[see 6.268]

In Sholem Aleichem's Motl Peyse dem Khazn's (Motl the Cantor's Son),
Motl is chastised for drawing. In his article "Bouncing Back," Dan
Miron explains this chastisement as probably stemming from the
prohibition against graven images.

[Other explanations are possible -- artistic painting is associated in
Motl with housepainting and the shame, for the son of a cantor, of
physical labor. Motl also generates rebuke by using his talents to
satire his family. But these could work in concert with Miron's
explanation.]

Subject: Did Sholem Aleichem play the violin?

In (6.266, 7) Chana Mlotek quotes from her article in "Di Goldene
Keyt" in which she writes that Sholem Aleichem learned to play the
violin.  I wrote in 6.268 that he never learned to play though he
longed to be able to play.  My bases were 1) that I can't recall
anything in Fun'm Yarid (up to age 21) to indicate that he had
instruction; 2) I can recall nothing from the memoirs of I.D.
Berkowitz (Undzere Rishoynim, mainly about the last eleven years of
his life) that indicate that Sholem Aleichem played the violin; and 3)
the following passage from Sholem Aleichem's daughter's biography.

_He relaxed best by sitting down at the piano to improvise, though he
had no formal musical training._   (from My Father, Sholem Aleichem,
by Marie Waife-Goldberg, New York: Simon and Shuster, 1968, p. 141.)

Some people learn without formal training, but this is the first I
heard of Sholem Aleichem actually playing the violin.   A plea to
Chana Mlotek.  What have I missed?  What is the source of that
statement?

Subject: Did Sholem Aleichem play the violin?

I've found a couple of passages in the literature bearing on this
question.

While still a student in the Pereyaslav District Russian school (age
15 or 16) Sholem Aleichem took advantage of association with those who
could play the violin.  He did learn to play a little.  His brother
relates this episode.  To quote:

A fidele - fleg mir Sholem zogn - farmogt a harts.  A fidl badarf men
nemen nit azoy mit di hent, vi mitn hartsn, un nit nor mitn smitshik
aroystsien fun di strunes a nign, nor mitn gantsn hartsn.  Azoy fleg
Sholem shpiln afn fidl. Di tekhnik fun shpiln hot er gekont shvakh
(Mayn Bruder, Sholem-Aleykhem, fun Vevik Rabinovitsh, Kiev: Melukhe
Farlag Far di Natsionale Minderhaytn in USSR, 1939, p. 26).

[My translation]
Sholem used to assure me that a violin possesses a heart.  A violin
must be taken not so much with hands as with the heart, and draw out a
melody from the strings not only with a bow but with the whole heart.
That's how Sholem played the violin.  His technique was weak.

Allowing for the generosity of a brother, that opinion of Sholem
Aleichem's technique is telling.  This was a brief encounter partly
because of incessant demands by these associates on Sholem for money.

Later, at age 17, after graduating, he went to Rzhishtshev (a town
close to Pereyaslav) and earned a little money as a tutor.  Again, he
associated with musicians, notably Avrom der Klezmer.

Der maestro aleyn hot im gelernt fidl shpiln (Fun'm Yarid, Driter
Tayl, kapitl 5, A Halb Yor Navenad, New York: Folksfond Oysgabe, Vol.
XXVII, 1923, p. 146).

[Translation] The maestro himself taught him how to play the violin.

That, too, was a brief encounter because conditions in that town were
simply too difficult to bear.  Shortly thereafter, he moved back to
Pereyaslav.

As far as I can tell, there seems little to indicate that playing the
violin was anything more than a casual part of his life.  When was
there time?  At about eighteen-and-a-half he was hired as a tutor to
Olga Loyev (future wife) at a farming estate in Sofievka.  Later, he
published a few Hebrew pieces, then was a rabiner in Loubny about
three years, then came marriage and a busy career as a prolific
Yiddish author, also a prolific writer of letters.

His sensitive ear for music (including the music of mame-loshn), and
great energy probably would have served him well as a violinist had he
had more extensive opportunities.
