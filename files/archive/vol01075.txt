Subject: Is the mail getting through?

This question is (I think) primarily directed to
subscribers who get their issues of Mendele via an Internet
address.  From time to time Internet mail bounces or fails
to arrive.  If you have reason to believe that such has
happened to you, please let me know.

I'm trying to get a better distribution system at this end.
If you happen to have a Bitnet address, that would probably
help matters.  Please send it to me at your convenience.

A dank.

Subject: gey in drerd

In a separate exchange, Bob Werman and I talked about his
pronunciation of the expression above as /gey in dred/
rather than /...drerd/.I wonder whether this comes from
English-speakers' suffering interference from English
phonetics and not picking up on the Yiddish postvocalic
/r/, probably a uvular trill, at least in some dialects.
Does it also occur in the speech of native speakers of
Yiddish? If so, the phenomenon here, perhaps for the
English-speakers as well, could be dissimilation. That is,
the two occurrences of /r/ flanking the vowel may be "too
much," as it were, for some speakers, leading to the
dropping of one of them. For those in the group unfamiliar
with such things in language history, let me mention
widespread pronunciations of "February" without, in this
case, the first /r/. (The English /r/, of course, is
phonetically different from the Yiddish /r/.) Thus it could
be, if all this is plausible, that some Yiddish speakers
would say /in dred/ but otherwise /erd/. I would Mikhl
Herzog's reaction, as would Bob.    Aren

Subject: Yiddish transliteration

Few Yiddophiles (how's that for a mixture of languages?)
that I've run into seem to be aware that there is a
standard for transliteration from Yiddish into the English
alphabet. Weinreich's Yiddish dictionary describes it.  I'm
fairly certain that it comes from YIVO.

I find it difficult enough to translate non-standard
Yiddish transliterations that I find myself skipping them,
which seems to defeat the idea of this mailing list.

I'd like to suggest that the editors publish the YIVO
rules, as this might encourage readers to use it, and thus
become contributors. ... Bob

[A good idea.  Any volunteers?  NM]
