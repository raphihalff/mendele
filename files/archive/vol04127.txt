Subject:  Mystery of lamed-sof=tzadik finally solved

First, I'd like to thank everyone who participated in the search for
clues on the mystery, of why Yitzkhak Leybush Peretz was listed under the
abbreviation "lamed-sof=tzadik" which refers to the first letter of
Leybush, and the last letter of Peretz.

I managed to track down Mr. Shmuel Ashkenazi (=S.A.) the co-author of the
book "Otzar Rashey Tevot" (Treasury of Abbreviations).  The two-letter
combination was how Y.L.Peretz often signed (or initialized) his works.
In fact, the combination spells out "letz" which is 'clown', in yiddish,
and according to S.A. in Zalmen Reisen's Lexicon Fun Yiddishe Shray-
bers(?) it is mentioned that Peretz refered to himself as the "letz fun
der redaktzie" ('clown of the editorial staff/room').

Well, several generations later, that same clown got the better of me,
and didn't let me rest until I tracked down the mystery's source and
explanation.

By the way, Michael Shimshoni in V4.096 solved the mystery, but I didn't
catch it, because of the way it was worded: "... as the way a certain
writer signed some of his works". In fact, the rest of his response
dealing with verses tied to personal names was very informative and
interesting. a shaynem dank.

Subject: Simchas Torah song

In my grandfather's memoirs I find the following passage, which I've
translated except for some of the Hebrew. The scene is Simchas Torah in
Keidan, about 1890 ...

... Since it was already beginning to get dark and afternoon prayers were
more or less over, they all set off, singing, bringing their gabais to
the shul.

Henekh the candlemaker walked up front. He wore only the right sleeve of
his coat, carrying the left side tucked under his left arm. A top hat,
not his own and much bigger than his head, was pushed down over his eyes,
so barely the tip of his long nose could be seen....

Henekh led the crowd in singing as they marched:

Henekh:         Yo Adir, yo adir,
                [God is great, God is great]

The crowd:      Adirey amkho yisroel, adirey amkho yisroel.
                 [The greatness of the nation of Israel]

Henekh:         Adir boneh beysekh, beysekh ibonah.
                Adir boneh beysekh, beysekh ibonah.
                [We will build your mighty house]
                v'shem neshemakh koleynu, koleynu.

The crowd:      Godolim v'katnim yokhed oteynu [great and small ...
                Godolim v'katnim yokhed oteynu
                Yeyru oneynu, v'yeyshemakh lebeynu, v'tagol nafsheynu
                bimheyro biyomeynu, bimheyro biyomeynu, haleluya.
                Yo Borakh ... and so forth through the alphabet.

I wonder, first, if I've transliterated this correctly, and second,
whether anyone can identify this as a liturgical, folk or other type of
chant? Since my grandfather was something of a folklorist (he collected
about  40 percent of the songs in the 1901 Ginzburg-Marek book) I suspect
this might be documented somewhere. But I don't know where.

A dank

Subject: Oranges and pomegranates

I might add another confusing similarity with Italian. Perhaps some of
you have experienced, too, turning the tap in an Italian hotel with the
marking CALDO on it and expecting cold water.

Now the Yiddish word for pomegranate, milgroym, is also of romance
origin, and can be reconstructed on the basis of Latin malum (with along
a) `apple' and granatum `full of seeds'. Thus, no Slavic provenance,
although in one 15th century West Russian translation of the Song of
Songs made from the Hebrew by Jews, pomegranates are "margramy".

Subject: Technical Yiddish "Verterbukh"

Having seen various words used for modern technological terms, especially
the recent "i-post (elektre-post)" and "krikh-post" for English "e-mail"
and "snail-mail", I am wondering if there is a comprehensive modern
Yiddish dictionary for technological terms. Weinreich's dictionary is now
over 25 years old, and, while there are the words for television and
radio incorporated into it, we need a more modern update. "Yugntruf"
journal carried a computer column for several years, with vocabulary
lists, a few years ago. I have about 2/3 of Feinstone's introductory
chemistry book (on photocopies), but that was printed in 1920, and I have
a biology text in Yiddish from the 1930s. Several years ago there was a
note in the journal of the American Chemical Society (C&E News) about an
old Yiddish translation of Oswald's chemistry textbook, and through
mid-century the Soviets published scientific books in Yiddish.

My point is, there ought to a be comprehensive collection of these terms,
especially with the rise of computer and engineering technology among the
"masses". If there is none as yet, I would be willing to start an
"addendum" or "addition" (or whatever it may be called) to Weinreich's
dictionary, or, perhaps, put out a  separate "Yiddish technical
dictionary", if I had lexicological help. I am not a Yiddish scholar (nor
tsvey yor in universitet fun pensilveynie) but I have a Ph.D. in Physical
Chemistry. If there are any menshn interested in such a project, shikt
mir i-post (smc5@lehigh.edu), zayt azoy gut.
