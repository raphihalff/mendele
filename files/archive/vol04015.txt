Subject: Kibosh

Dan Kirshner doesn't ask lightly about the likes of kibosh.  We spent
much of our Shabbat dinner together last week researching this question.
That night we came up with the Turkish bos (bosh).  Now I see the OED has
cabosh or caboche from the French referring to removing the head.  This
is apparently related to cabbage, too.  What was Leo Rosten's evidence in
favor of a Yiddish origin? (we were told he presented evidence both pro
and con).  I can't see what Yiddish word it is related to.

Subject: Shpilkes

Shpilkes are pins.  Zetsn af shpilkes is more or less being unable to sit
still.  Shpilkes are, of course, one of the elements in the psychiatric
diagnosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Our poor shames
will be up to his pipik in responses to these queeries.

Subject: YIVO, Shpilkes & Baltaxe

YIVO (Kinkley):  Acronym for yidisher visnshaftlikher institut, Jewish
Scientific Institute.  Last alef read as kometz-alef for mellifluous
77onunciation, perhaps?

Shpilkes (Kinkley):  "Pins," as in Polish szpilki, "pins."  To be "af
shpilkes is to be "on pins and needles," i.e. nervous or impatient.

Baltaxe (Mullish):  Alexander Beider's Dict. of Jewish Surnames shows
Baltaxe as an Odessa region name meaning "tax farmer" < Heb. ba'al +
"tax".  Court- related names usually contain the particle "bad," for
bet-din, as in Shabad, shaliakh bet-din, court messenger, or Babad, ben
av bet din, son of the chief rabbinic judge, etc.

to: delphine bechtel

thanks for the warning about _der nister_ but i'm looking for what people
have said about prodrop, not for facts about prodrop itself. so please
don't anyone be reluctant to give me a reference just because you think
what it says is wrong. thanks.

Subject: Der Nister

Does anyone know if anything by Der Nister can be found in English trans-
lation? I teach a Yiddish culture class here in the January term and
would love to include something by him in the syllabus. I have found him
perhaps the most fascinating of Yiddish writers, but I have only read him
in Yiddish, and for this course, nebekh, I must use English materials.

A sheynem dank,

From: ZOGUR@CUVMB.CC.COLUMBIA.EDU
Subject: Saturday night

A question to Germanists:

Yiddish renders the expressions "Sunday night", "Monday night" (through
"Thursday") as "zuntik af/of der nakht", etc. Not so "Friday/Saturday
night" which are either "erev shabes" and "moytse shabes", respectively,
or "fraytik tse (=tsu) nakht" and "shabes tse (= tsu) nakht" and, far
more frequently, a variant of "shabEYsenakht" for the latter.

The problem: Each of the three, "fraytik tse (=tsu) nakht", "shabes tse
(= tsu) nakht", and "shabEYsenakht" has a widespread variant, with
"nakhtS" rather than "nakht". Thus "shabEYsenakhtS".

Question: Is there any apparent basis for the "nakhtS" form in German?
Any reason to think that this construction may have required a genitive?

Subject: Farewell

To all Mendeleniks and Mendelenitses

Although I have only really been a lurker and a learner on this list,
only submitting an introduction when I began, I feel it is my duty to bid
you farewell.  I am in the process of changing jobs, where chances are, I
wont have access to e-mail.  I have taken printouts of every single
posting for Mendele that has come my way since I discovered you, and
through this have widened my knowledge and understanding of the culture
from which I originate, quite considerably.  In my new vocation, which is
in the private sector, I aim to continue with my Masters degree which
will focus on questions of Diasporism, and still hope to learn Yiddish to
the best of my ability.

All I can do it reiterate how much pleasure this mailing list has given
me, and as a parting shot, give you a new subscriber, whom I believe you
all know - Joseph Sherman.  I was quite astonished to learn that he
doesn't yet have access to Mendele.

A grose dank..

Robyn Sassen

Subject: Yiddish/Jewish comics II

Though it's come awfully close, it doesn't seem like there were Yiddish
comics in the same way we now know the comic.

There was plenty of editorial, satirical and humorous single panel art
such as that found in Der Groyser Kundes or on the pages of the Yiddish
dailies, but no strips ( the dailies DID carry multi-panel cartoon
advertisments but they were simply translations from the English.)

The presence of Jews in the comic industry goes back to before its
beginnings. For all intents and purposes the modern comic was invented in
1933 by Max Gaines by anthologizing Sunday color comics under one cover.
Later, Gaines' son William along with the late Harvey Kurtzman went on to
found Mad magazine whose use of Yiddish ("farshlugener", etc.) made it
all the more a unique humor magazine.

In 1939, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, sons of immigrants created the
ultimate super-immigrant: Superman.  In fact, the Superman story  (escape
from danger in a small craft, being found by benevolent passerby, etc.)
is simply an ingeniously updated story of moyshe rabeynu!

There is no evidence that Shuster and Siegel ever employed Superman in
the fight against the Nazis though other comics did, such as Captain
America, the Boy Commandos, Captain Marvel, etc.)

After the war Jews begin to show up in mainstream comics. The premier
issue of the short-lived comic "Impact" (1955) published by William
Gaines featured the B. Kreigsman story "Master Race" about a Jewish
concentration camp survivor who meets the former camp komandant on the
subway and exacts his revenge.

Later, a Marvel comics W.W. II series did address the issue of the Jews
where "The Avengers" introduced the character of "The Golem" in 1986.
Conveniently transplanted from Prague's ghetto in the Middle Ages to
Warsaw's during the war, this Golem -- called to life by a yeshive bukher
mit payes -- fights Nazis for several issues.

Last, and certainly least, are the crudely drawn and poorly written comic
strips on Jewish history and famous rabonim that appear in New York's
"The Jewish Press" ("Tales of the Gaonoim", etc.) along with the new
generation of Orthodox comics like "Mendy and the Golem".
