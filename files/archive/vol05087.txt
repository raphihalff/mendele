Yiddish Family Festival-September 16-17

Yiddish language and culture, undergoing a welcome revival, will be
celebrated at "Yiddishkayt: A Family Festival in English & Yiddish," the
weekend of September 16-17 at the Valley Cities Jewish Community Center,
13164 Burbank Boulevard, Sherman Oaks.  Highlighting stories, crafts,
film, history and music inspired by the Yiddish language, the Festival
offers a window into this vibrant culture for non-Yiddish speakers, Jews
from other backgrounds, and for the entire Los Angeles community.  "Los
Angeles is long overdue for a celebration of this great language and
culture" says festival producer Aaron Paley.  "Yiddish has become more
relevant than ever in the 1990's as it continues to inspire artists of
all kinds around the world."

The Festival kicks-off Saturday, September 16, at 8:00 PM, with an
evening concert of theater, music and song, featuring special guest
Leonard Nimoy, the Ellis Island Klezmer Band, singer Lisa Wanamaker,
actor Jack Lewin, and musician-raconteur Archie Barkan.  Tickets for the
Saturday evening concert, $12 ($10 for center members, students and
seniors), are available through Theatix (213) 466-1767.  Advance ticket
purchases should be made as seating is limited.

The FREE festival for families begins Sunday, September 17, at 10 AM and
continues all day until 5:00 PM.  The Sunday community extravaganza
features continuous programming for children and their families including
storytelling (in English) with Uncle Ruthie, We Tell Stories, and Karen
Golden; sing-alongs with Cindy Paley, Risa Igelfeld, and Best Friends;
hands-on craft workshops including:

Yiddish Family Festival

Yiddish kite-making with My Jewish Discovery Place Children's Museum,
tsdoke pushkes with Edmon Rodman, calligraphy, and paper cutting.

Bring your instruments and learn how to play a song with a klezmer band
at the music workshop led by Yale Strom's klezmer group, Zmiros.
Community booths will offer Yiddish and English books, information on
Yiddish classes, camps and programs, artisans, and other yiddishkayt
products.  Videos of classic Yiddish films, curated by L.A. Times critic,
Kenneth Turan, will be shown, and Yale Strom will introduce his
documentary "The Last Klezmer" and offer a sneak preview of his
forthcoming film, "The Ice Cream Vendor from Carpati."  At 4:30 PM, a
concert of the best in Klezmer music and Yiddish song will be featured in
the Center's auditorium.  Other offerings include conversational Yiddish,
a genealogy workshop, seminars on Yiddish theater, humor, and proverbs,
and cooking demonstrations with The Seasonal Table.  And of course, there
will be delicious food to nosh on, inspired by Yiddish cooking.  Ample
free parking is available at Valley College, across the street from the
Jewish Community Center.

Yiddishkayt: A Family Festival in English & Yiddish is presented by the
Valley Cities Jewish Community Center and produced by Community Arts
Resources (CARS).  Yiddishkayt is sponsored by the Dora and Charles
Mesnick Cultural Fund of the Jewish Community Centers Association of Los
Angeles, honoring the retired director of that organization and his wife,
and supported by a grant from the Misha and Sonia Yablon Cultural Fund.

Supporters of Yiddishkayt  include, among others, the Los Angeles Yiddish
Culture Club, Sholem Community Organization and Educational Institute,
National Yiddish Book Center, Workmen's Circle.
