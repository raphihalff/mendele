Subject: Diminutives and Plurals

This pattern occurs also with the word for 'child':
kind / kinder, but kinderlekh. It is -regular- with
most nouns taking -im (with stress shift??) in the
plural:  khazn: khazndl/khazonimlekh; dokter /
doktorimlekh, etc.

For what it's worth, a similar phenomenon occurs in
Bulgarian masculine diminutives in -ec, e.g., grad
'city,' plural grad-ov-e';  grad-e'c 'little city,' but
plural grad-ov-c-e'. (Note that in the plural form the
suffix -ec loses the vowel 'e' regularly.) I suspect
that the same pattern is found also in Macedonian. I am
not aware of it in other Slavic languages.

Subject: introduction

*Gikher* a brief introductory statement, says he.  OK.
I'm a non-Jewish linguist with, as they said in _The
Book Peddler_, a Yiddish obsession.  Unlike Ellen
Prince, Moshe Taube, Len Talmy and the other linguists
I recognize among the subscribers, I don't know enough
about Y. to claim it as a speciality (my specialty is
Amerindian).  I just think it's a very interesting
language.

I think this calls for more explanation.  Is a 'yud'
not considered a consonant for these purposes?  In
Hebrew, it certainly is.  If so, then what is the
problem with 'yud,yud,daled' for 'yid'?

(I understand that in Yiddish, 'yud' is not always a
vowel, but then neither is alef or ayin.)

Subject: Id/Yid: alef or yud

The practice of starting words like "id" with an alef
rather than yud may not be simply an arbitrary spelling
convention.  At least some of my grandparents (from the
Lithuania-Belarus-Poland border area, Litvaks all) said
/an id/, NOT /a yid/, proving that in their
pronunciation these words started with a vowel (hence
alef, as Mikhl pointed out), not the consonant /y/.  I
don't know whether this use of /an/ was before all
words which in the standardized spelling have
yud-khirekyud, though.  Do other people actually say
/yid/ with a distinct y-i sequence?

Subject: Shtoch

Question:

I've heard the term "shtoch."  I'm curious about its origins.
I have two guesses:
* Germanic cognate for "stick" as in "stick it to them"
* From the Hebrew "shtk" meaning to "shut them up" as in
  what one should do to a heretic.

  (i.e. mesechta megilla, 3rd perek I think)
