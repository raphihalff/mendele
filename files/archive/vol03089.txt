Well, I don't have old copies of the Forverts on hand, but in the
old orthography as I'm familiar with it (as in the usual edition of
Sholem Aleykhem's collected works, for instance), this just isn't
true. Would that it were!

I don't recall _ever_ seeing "lehbn" or "gehbn", even though these
words have long "e:" or "ey" in most dialects. Why weren't they
written that way? Because they aren't written with an "h" in German.

Similarly, Nissen points out that spelling "ihr" with a "h" supplies
a hint that this word has a long vowel, unlike the short vowel of
"mit". True. But "ihm" was also written with a "h", even though no
Yiddish dialect I've heard uses the same vowel in "ihr" and "ihm".
(My dialect has "eym" as a variant, but that's another matter.)

And again, this same long vowel was spelled yud+ayin in "liebe".
Another hint. But "zieben" was written the same way, and it
certainly doesn't have that long vowel.

Examples are endless.  The point is that the old orthography, as it
was practised, didn't attempt to reflect the sounds of spoken
Yiddish of _any_ dialect. It was designed, by maskilim who hated
Yiddish, to resemble standard German as closely as could be done
with Hebrew letters.

Nissen is right that you could, in theory, design a system that
reflected a broad base of dialects. But it wouldn't be the old
system, it would have to be a completely new creation. Good luck
getting anyone to use it!

The current orthography takes a lowest common denominator approach,
discarding the vowel distinctions that not every one makes. I'd love
it if we had a richer system, but look at how hard it is just to get
everyone to write the pasekh to distinguish "ay" from "ey". I'm
afraid that if they had held out for a richer system, we'd still be
stuck with the old chaos !! :-(

Subject:  Yehupets

Speaking of supposedly fictitious place names, I have often wondered
about the etymology of Yehupets, the Kiev stand-in portrayed in
Sholem Aleichem's works that has been transmogrified into (or was
this its original connotation?) the equivalent of "the sticks."

Anyway, Ivan/John/Yohanan Petrovsky, of Kiev, hypothesizes that the
name Yehupets derives from Ukrainian "[Y]Ehipet," meaning "Egypt" --
with Kiev perhaps signifying the fleshpots thereof. I am no
Slavicist, so I leave it to the likes of Robert Rothstein to shoot
down this theory.

Incidentally, in my "Responsa" column for the 1986-87 issue of
"Judaica Librarianship" (vol. 3, no. 1/2; pp. 133-134), I discussed
the following question that had come my way:  "Where are Kasrilevke,
Boiberik, and Yehupetz [sic] located?"  This is NOT the definitive
discussion of the issue, however, as Prof. Avraham Nowersztern
tactfully pointed out to me a few weeks ago.

Subject: Re: pronouncing songs

We have the same problem at home, though it's unrelated to
transliteration or orthography.

When teaching songs to our kids, I put them into our dialect.  Since
my in-laws are from Staszow (Poland), the vowels are what's commonly
referred to as "southern" pronunciation.

[This next part gets a little difficult to describe; I'm using YIVO
transcription below to show pronunciations.]

So we teach the kids "Ofn pripetchik brent a fayerl, un in shtib iz
HAYS" (not "heys").  And so on, rhyming with alef-BAYS.  Fine.

... gedenkt zhe tayere, vus ir larnt [sic] DU, Zug zhe nokh a mol,
un take nokh a mol, kometz alef ... what? U?  That rhymes, but we
don't say kometz-alef U, we say kometz-alef O.  Even though we read
many (not all) words that contain kometz-alef as "u".

So we seem to be stuck with saying kometz-alef O and not rhyming.
Comments?
