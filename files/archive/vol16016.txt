What is the derivation of "trefn" and of "bagegenen"?

Thank you.

Subject: Wiesel's "Night" in Yiddish

Dena Mandel asks about the original Yiddish version of Elie Wiesel's
"Night."  As far as I know, "Night" was written in French.  An earlier
book, "Un di velt hot geshvign," was published in Yiddish in 1956 and is
sometimes considered a predecessor of "Night."

Subject: "Varnitshkes"

Beth Goldstein is seeking a song (Mendele 16.012) which mentions "fefer un
zalts" and a "khosn." Several people suggested "Kh'vil Nisht Aza Khosn,"
but that song doesn't mention any fefer or zalts. Perhaps what she heard
was the song "Varnitshkes," which begins "Gevalt! Vu nemt men?" The refrain
relates the ingredients sought to make this dish: fefer, zalts, heyvn,
shmalts (pepper, salt, yeast, fat) and concludes that what is really needed
is a bokher to eat the varnitshkes. Using the Freedman database at the
University of Pennsylvania (http://digital.library.upenn.edu/freedman/), I
was able to identify sheet music as well as several recorded versions of
this song, also known as "Dos lid fun altn bokher."

Subject: Kotsker rebbe

Dear Mendele

Does anyone know the background of the Yiddish song "Kotsk," sung by Sol
Zim and perhaps others.  The song talks about the great simkhe of davke
traveling by foot, and not by transportation, to visit Kotsk. Going to
Kotsk, the song says, is comparable to the great simkhe of being a biblical
"oyle reygl," when the Jews went only by foot to the Beys hamikdesh. What
puzzles me is that the Kotsker rebbe was known as a harsh, demanding
Hasidic leader whose requirements of his followers were rigid and rigorous.
The Kotsker rebbe's reign did not engender the joy-inducing environment
that other Hasidic rebbes produced, and his followers were limited in
number because of that.   So what made going to Kotsk such a simkhe?

Subject: Leonard Landes

Does anyone have any biographic information on Yiddish doctor/writer
Leonard Landes?  In the early part of the 20th century, he wrote a series
of short books focusing on the topics of sexual relations, sexual health,
men and women, and other related issues.  I have a bunch of his texts for a
project I'm working on, but know very little about Landes himself.  Where
was he born?  Where did he train?  Any insights?

Thanks,
Warren Hoffman

Regarding Jack Berger's posting about yizker-bikher translations:

I don't know how many Mendele subscribers know about the wonderful
JewishGen Yizkor Book Project headed by Joyce Field located at
www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/.

We don't have to reinvent the wheel. The JewishGen Yizkor Book Project is
already the clearing house that Jack Berger seeks. The JewishGen Yizkor
Book Project accepts donations of Yizkor Book translations, as well as
contributions to fund additional translations. In addition, it provides an
easily accessible home for the Yizkor Book translations on its website.

Subject:  yizker-bikher

Khaver Jack Berger draws our attention to the importance of having yizkor
books translated, and for the sake of the sadly increasing numbers of
Yiddishly-impaired I say omeyn to that.  With regard to the example of the
two Bilgoraj yizkor books translated by Monika Adamczyk-Garbowska, he
wonders "how to propagate this experience into a more broadly based
initiative...It also strikes me that we need a clearing house for such
undertakings."  Khaver Jack need wonder no longer.  There already exists a
robust and systematic long-term project which has been coordinating the
translation of these precious books under the leadership of Joyce Field and
the aegis of /Jewishgen /(the unique internet website portal to vast
networks of Jewish genealogical resources, and an affiliate of the Museum
of Jewish Heritage).  This project has been on-going for some years now,
and has accomplished much.  Almost all of the translation is done by
volunteer efforts--a chapter here, an essay there, a book or two if you
have time.  The quality of the rendering varies, but mostly it goes from
nishkoshe to pretty good, sometimes exceptionally good.  (Mendelnikes who
care to explore the translations to date, and/or even contribute with their
linguistic talents (a mitzve! a mitzve!), can find the project at
http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/translations.html.)
