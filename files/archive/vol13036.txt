Subject: Re: gogl mogl

To Itzik Goldenberg's query about "gogl mogl" I propose two possibilties for
the origin of the term, which is also known in hebrew and is found in the
Even-Shoshan Dictionary (with unspecified origin: Yiddish, German), or a
spoonerism (Verbalhornung) of both:

a) the German term for "Gogl mogl" - "Hoppelpoppel", which means besides the
eggnog also a farmers-breakfast made of scrambled egg with ham and fried
potatoes.

b) Gog and Magog (Ezekiel 28-29) in the English version of the legend
(pictured in the Guildhall in London). Both explanations are mentioned in
Alexander Harkavy's Yiddish English-Hebrew Dictionary (1928).

I am sure others remember the _huge_ discussion here in 1998.

Subject: Re: mayofes-tants

Nokhem Reinharz asks about the meaning of mayofes-tants or mayofes-lid. The
term refers originally to a shabos evening zemer, a Friday night Sabbath
tablesong, deriving from a 13th-century Provence Hebrew poem and sung widely
in Eastern Europe down to modern times, particularly in Polish lands. The
words "mah yafit" in Hebrew mean "how beautiful", the opening words of of
the song's text. At some point in the 18th century, non-Jewish Poles began
to fixate on the melody of the song and Hasidic singing style as a source of
bizarre amusement and symbol of the strangeness of Jewish musical practice.
There are even accounts of landowners requiring Jewish tenants to appear and
dance a caricatured, exagerated Hasidic dance while singing this song. You
will find exhaustive and fascinating discussions of the song's history and
meaning in the following two excellent articles:

1) Chone Shmeruk, "Mayufes: A Window on Polish-Jewish Relations" Polin 10
(1997)

2) Bret Web, "Majufes: A Vestige of Jewish Traditional Song in Polish
Popular Entertainments" Polish Music Journal 6:1 (Summer 2003)

On this subject, see the important article by the late Prof. Chone Shmeruk,
"Mayufes: A Window on Polish-Jewish Relations," in vol. 10 (I believe the
year is 1997) of the annual Polin.

Subject: Re: nebbish and nebekh

One has always heard 'nebekh' added to a sentence, a sort of sad expletive.
So what happened to Tsirl?  She had a miscarriage, nebekh.  Well, Tsirl was
always a nebbish.  So who told her to wash the kitchen floor in her 6th
month on her hands and knees?

Interesting.  I was taught that it came from the Old Czech "ne Boh,"
literally "no God," i.e., one who lacks the common blessings of God.  I
don't know any Hungarian, so I have no clue as how reasonable Jeffrey's
suggestion might be.  Anyone?

Subject: RE: nebbish and nebekh

The best authorities have it that Yiddish "nebekh" is derived from Old Czech
"neboh(y)," which once meant 'poor thing' and now means 'deceased'. (Czech
"h" iz pronounced /kh/ in final position.)

Subject: RE: nebbish and nebekh

In my dialect ( Litvak), a nebbish is a person for whom one feels pity. I
would agree with JJ in his defuinition.

nebekh is what one says when one hears a pitiful story, or wishes to
extend sympathy. A person isn't a nebekh -- it's a condoling remark.Again, JJ
seems to be on track.

But I don't think the two words are related. Note that I use a different
vowel - and the X throaty consonant at the end.
