Subject: Introduction

My parents are Holocaust survivors from Poland, whose Yiddish, while
good, could not match the level of the language that I have noticed
among participants.

As the child of Yiddish-speaking immigrants who grew up in an
English-speaking environment (Toronto), even though I went to the local
Peretz school, I could not hope to speak Yiddish as well as those other
subscribers to your list.

It warms my heart to see that mameloshn has not died (as I expected that
it would, with the death of the last generations of East-European Jews),
but that it has undergone a kind of renaissance and is flourishing, at
least on the Internet.

I am particularly happy to have found the Mendele list.  From the
contributions to it, I have learned a number of Yiddish words that I
would have otherwise never known, so, on a personal level too, I have
found Mendele very enriching.

Words that I have recently learned, that I never heard my parents use:
beletristik (fiction); tantyemes (royalties); nishtoymemdik
(astounding); umgelumpert (awkward); ubifrat (especially).

Of course I have my Weinreich dictionary to help me too.

Just to give you some background: I am 38 years old...live in Toronto
Canada...am a lawyer..married...two children...love literature and
classical music..speak many languages (Yiddish, included, ober nisht
azoy gut) and am, as I said, the child of Holocaust survivors (Lodzer
Yiden).

Es iz oykh a hartsderkhapenish tsu derzen di farshidene mentshn vos hobn
zikh farlibt in yidish, afile nisht yidishe...

Ikh hof az ikh hob mikh bashtayert mit epes tsu dem mendele-list.

Subject: Minim un nusakh litvak

Benugeye minim [zeyt 6.131]-- muz men eykh nemen in ombatrakht dem
nusakh litvak, vu der "dos" iz kmaat in gantzn nit faran. litvakn,
gelernte af yidish (vos zey zogn afile idish, nebekh) mamesh geoynim vi
es firt zikh bay undz litvakn, baytn oys di minim gantz fray un
freylakh.

nokh a zakh. undzer shprakh bayt zikh tomid - dos iz a simen fun a
lebedik loshn - un fun a toes vert a minheg, fun a minheg, a nusakh, fun
a nusakh, epes a nay gramatik. ikh meyn az mame loshn vet hobn gantz an
andern ponim in etlekhe yorhunderter arum. in teyln fun belorusie, hob
ikh gehert nokh an interesanter zakh -- a dopl reflexiv (mit a zikh un a
zakh).  l'moshl: "Ikh hob zikh genumen vashn zakh." A lokalizm, zikher
-- ober iz dos a toes???

ober raboysay, mit geherike minim, tzi on geherike minim, mit toesn, on
toesn, klingt yidish vi yidish un nit vi daytch oder latayn oder rusish
oder hebraish. un nit undzere balibte gdoylim vi vaynraykh, shekhter un
dovid katz, un nit undzere balibte mendelyaner vos zitzn vi shoymrim
iber undzere blitzpostn, hobn borekh hashem, farkhasmet dem sefer fun
yidishn gramatik.

un tzum farendikn, hob ikh nokh a bakoshe far undzere shoymrim. mir
yidishistn shrayen un betn bay di mendelyaner zey zoln shraybn af
yidish. zikher meynen mir a laytishn yidish. ober der iker iz shraybn.
fun shraybn lernt men. shraybn, leyenen, zikh tzuhern tzu yidishe
shrayber, redner, poetn, zinger - azey geyt men tzu besers.

it's better to try to write yiddish, albeit in transliteration, (even if
you make errors) than to waste the opportunity mendele gives us. with
writing, and reading and listening to the yiddish word in all its
variations, your yiddish will improve and pick up that unmistakable
ta'am.

Subject: Tautologies, pleonastic expressions

Mechl Asheri lists a number of interesting forms [6.132] which I would
rather consider pleonastic than tautologous. In any event, here are
several more to add to the collection:

Involving Hebrew origin words:

      bay zey beyneyhem 'among gentiles'
      undzere oves oveseynu
      mayn okhi

Involving Slavic origin words:

      baldzares (Polish zaraz 'right away')

In Litvish Yiddish only:

      fisnoge "feet" (Polish noga)
      fisribe "fish" ((Polish ryba) to disambiguate Litvish Yiddish "fis"

Subject: More on tautologies

In re Mechl Asheri's "tautologies", the very word that has come up in
another context, "bimkem", functions as one in the following expression:
"er hot gelozt a bimkem af zayn ort"

Gloss: He left a bimkem (=an in place of) i.e. substitute
in his place.

I'll buy the designation "tautology" although I still prefer "pleonasm"

Subject: Tautologies

"a guter seiver-ponim-yofis", which means a kindly, pleasant countenance,
is another tautology. I can't remember where I saw it (probably in
Yugntruf dzhurnAl).

Subject: Young readers of Peretz

This is a response to Michael Steinlauf's post on Mendele 6.129.  By
coincidence, I have just started to read "I.L. Peretz and the Making of
Modern Jewish Culture" by Ruth R. Wisse (U. of Washington Press, 1991),
and I came across the same comment about young readers of Peretz.  The
full comment is given in note 27, p.114:

      Isaac Bashevis Singer writes that in his childhood it was common
      to see young men and women reading Peretz with a dictionary: '
      Often the son would ask his father for an explanation of this or
      other expression. The father considered Peretz a heretic, but he
      was pleased that the son had to appeal to him for the explanation
      of a talmudic saying.'  Yizkhak Varshavski (Singer), "A naye
      oysgabe fun peretzes verk" ("A New Edition of Peretz's Works"), in
      Forverts, July 5, 1947, p.2.

It may be that this book addresses some of Michael's concerns, and
therefore would be worth while for him, as well as others, to read.

Subject: A kleyn yidish lidl

Last week during a phone conversation with my elderly parents living in
Florida, my father told me how well my mother was doing - she was
gaining weight and exercising regularly. At that point I chimed in with
an "ot azoy!".  At which point my mother responded by singing this
delightful little song remembered from her childhood in Gombin, Poland.

	ot azoy neyt a shnayder
	ot azoy fardint er gelt
	er neyt, er neyt a gantse vokh
	es kumt oyf shabes hot der keshen a lokh

	This is how a tailor sews,
	This is how he earns his money
	he sews, he sews the entire week
	but when the sabbath comes his pocket has a hole
