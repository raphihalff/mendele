Subject: H.L. Mencken, Jews, & diabetes

Would someone please give the exact statement and citation for the
remark on Jews and diabetes?  Despite Mencken's anti-semitic remarks
[found in his personal diaries, not published by him] and his later
political strangeness, he was a persistent critic of cultural
hypocrisy in the US (especially anti-intellectual fundamentalism].
As printed in Mendele, his remark on Jews and diabetes is not
clearly anti-semitic. If derived from the dialogue in Caesar and
Cleopatra, where Shaw has Caesar twit his English servant, named
Brittanicus, about his society's barbarism compared to the Egyptians
about whom Britannicus has made nasty remarks, then Mencken may in
fact be saying that Jews were civilized long before whomever the
remark is addressed to.  After all, it has long been known that
diabetes is not "purely" hereditary, if that word has any meaning in
the world of microbiology's paradigm of gene expression.  Many
Native American Indian peoples have become very severely afflicted
with diabetes (and obesity) and this has been traced to the
introduction of European-style diets that replaced their normal
foods to which they were biologically adapted.  Thus, diabetes is
very much a disease that comes with civilization and dietary
changes.  So let's not condemn Mencken without a clear reference and
context for his remark.  Mencken devoted a few pages to Yiddish in
his The American Language in 1919, with credit to Abraham Cahan as
the source of his information, even if this was to illustrate the
flexibility of American Yiddish in borrowing from its new
environment.

Subject: Mooz?

As one  who was brought  up in a  Yekkish, thus not  Yiddish
speaking, family, I had to learn the little I know of Yiddish
indirectly.  I had thought that unlike in German one says in
Yiddish  "darf" for "must", which took some time  to get used to
as there  are the  German words "muss" for must  and "darf" for may.
When I thought that I  got it I found now in a recent article by
Ruth Minden the line:

>concluded by saying "A yid mooz vissn zayn shprakh", I found myself
                            ====

This "mooz" looks  suspiciously close to the German  muss.  Please
can some Mendelniks clarify what the proper Yiddish usage is.

Subject: manseh and shmoolyaris

The yiddish I heard in Brooklyn included 'manseh ' but not 'mayseh'.
I was discouraged from believing in 'bobbeh manses' (or 'maynses').
I also hear 'shmoolyaris' for dollars, especially in discourse of a
less than serious nature.  All this in a 'galitsyaner' context.

Re: 'feygele' as gay or homosexual, I find an entry in Fred Kogos'
1966 A Dictionary of Yiddish Slang and Idioms, Citadel Press (or
Castle Books) on p. 35 "faigeleh..little bird, also a pervert,
fairy, homosexual, fag.
