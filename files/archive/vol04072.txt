Subject: National Yiddish Book Center liaison?

Is there anyone who works at the National Yiddish Book Center who is
on Mendele (or, more generally, who is on e-mail)?  Please write me
at dovid@mit.edu

Subject: Etymology of the name Shapiro

No one ever refuted my hypothesis that the last name Shapiro and its
variants stem from Aramaic _shapir_ + _o_ ('beautiful' + 'the' = 'the
beautiful one'). Nu, refute this please!

Subject: Got fun Avrom

If I am not mistaken, the prayer Got fun Avrom may be found in the
standard prayerbook of the Conservative movement: Siddur Sim Shalom.  It
is the only yiddish text in the prayerbook.  The version that I remember
from Sim Shalom, is shorter and considerably less jam-packed with
loshn-koydesh phrases than the version which was recently transliterated
on Mendele.

Subject: On 'belaaz'

Bob Werman  had mentioned  that in Rashi's  commentary he  uses belaaz
before foreign  words, with  "laaz" being an  acronym for  bilshon 'am
zar.  Mikhl Herzog is doubtful and wrote:

>Bob, does Rashi actually introduce Yiddish glosses with the designation
>"belaaz", or does your reference to such glosses as "laazim" follow from
>the assumption that "laaz" is an acronym (for "leshon am zar[a]")? I know
>that the acronym explanation is part of our "received wisdom" but, what
>if it's not true?

I think that Mikhl is correct,  and although Bob's view is repeated by
many, laaz  is not  acronym but  an actual word.   In Tehilim  (and it
forms  also from  there  a  part of  Hallel)  we  have betzet  yisrael
mimitzrayim, bet  ya'aqov me'am  LOEZ.  This is  the root  lamed 'ayin
zayin as of laaz.

As to the  other important issues raised by Bob  and Mikhl, qatonti, I do
not know enough about them.

Subject: Shtetl Kautabag

     I am seeking the geographical location of a shtetl with a name
SOMETHING LIKE Kautabag, Katabag, Katabaug, ....   I never saw the name
of this place written; I only heard it spoken.  I suspect that it MAY
have been in the Ukraine, but again I am not certain.  My paternal
grandfather and his father (who owned an inn) lived there before
immigrating to the United States ca. 1901.

     Can anyone help me to locate Kautabag?

Subject: Apology

A deep apology to Mikhl Herzog and anyone who may have misunderstood my
use of "undzere khokhomim".  I had always been taught that to seek the
advice of a wiser person was, in Yiddish:  "betn an eytse bay a khokhem"
and that our (ancient) wise men were the "khaza'l" (khokhomim zikhroynom
levrokho).  Of course the khelemer sages are also 'khokhomim', but I had
no intention of comparing them.

ikh bet antshuldikung fun ale vos hobn nit farshtanen, as mayn banutzn
zikh mit dem oysdruk "undzere khokhomim" iz geven a loib, un nit khas ve
sholem a baleydikung oder gringshetzung.

Subject: Mystery:lamed-sof=tzadik

un itzt vegn nokh a misfarshtendenish:

I'll try to re-explain what the "lamed-sof=tzadik" mystery is about: When
I looked up the abbreviation lamed-feh-kuf in the book "Otzar Rashey
Teyvot", I found a strange entry several lines after, for another
abbreviation: lamed-sof=tzadik.  This has two interesting problems
associated with it:

1) in a response to my request of similar abbreviations with a sof-letter
   ending the abbreviation, I was given an example: aleph-vav-sof=mem
   (u:m) which is umot meukhadot (United Nations).  This is not a member
   of my newly discovered species.

   Let's take a better known sample: tana'kh (tof-nun-sof=khof) This is
   also not a member of my mysterious species. Why? Because in order for
   the "tanakh" abbreviation to meet the criteria of the
   "lamed-sof=tzadik" abbreviation-species it would have to be (Please
   note carefully!): "lamed-sof=mem" !

   The abbeviation I discovered takes the LAST letter of the last word:
   i.e. sof=mem of '(toyre-neviim)-ktuvim' if this were the case.
   However, the actual abbreviated word was 'leybush peritz', and the
   sof=tzadik is refering to the last letter in 'peritz'.

   Permit ne to rephrase my question: Are there other words where the
   LAST letter (of the last word) becomes part of the abbreviation?

2) Mystery item #2 I have never heard of Yitzhok Leybush Peretz being
   referred to by the abbreviation "lamed-sof=tzadik". Any thoughts on
   this one? Was there some other famous 'leybush peritz'?

By the way, I'm trying to track down the two Israeli compilers of the
book "Otzar Rashey Teyvot" where I found the strange entry. If I can get
hold of either, it might help clear up the mystery.

[Just found out: Dr. Dov Yarden, one of the authors passed away several
years ago.  I'll try reaching the other author, Shmuel Ashkenazi, if I
can].

Subject: Introductory Yiddish books

Howard Gershen asked for opinions on two books: "Mame Loshn" by Geipel,
and "Words like arrows" by Kumove.

A. There are numerous sources for Yiddish proverbs, ranging from the
relatively inaccessible to pure "shund."

There are many softcover books with "cutesy" pictures and associated
Yiddish proverbs; they're amusing and harmless.  See your local Jewish
book store or synagogue gift shop.

Leo Rosten's books on Yiddish (primarily "The Joys of Yiddish," but also
"In Praise of Yinglish" and "Hooray for Yiddish") can also be a source
for proverbs.  The first book is quite entertaining and a decent (if
unscholarly) source for etymologies; the latter two are IMO of lesser
quality.

Several books are available with titles like "How to curse in Yiddish."
While the study of Yiddish slang and curses is useful and fun, as a lover
of Yiddish I find such books depressing. Although IMO some appreciation
of Yiddish is better than none, I suspect that the bulk of these books
are bought by people whose memory of Yiddish is "limited to 25 words, all
of them curses, most of them mispronounced," to paraphrase Alexander
Portnoy (or is that Philip Roth?).  They typify the Jackie Mason school
of Yiddish, namely, that Yiddish is a funny little outdated jargon,
useful only to curse or to avoid having others understand.  [End of
polemic.]  (For a fascinating but scholarly book on the subject, I
recommend a book titled "Maledictions and Benedictions..." - I've
forgotten the remainder of the title or the author's name; I believe he's
an anthropologist or sociologist at U. California.)

Kumove's book of proverbs is IMO a nice collection. I own three books
with transliterations and English translations of Yiddish proverbs: one
by Ayalti, one by Fred Kogos, and the one you mention by Kumove.  Of the
three, only Kumove's presents the texts categorized by subject, and in
the Yiddish alphabet as well (I believe using YIVO transliteration).  (An
all-Latin-alphabet book by Galvin, "Yiddish Dictionary Sourcebook," also
has numerous sayings and proverbs in transliteration.)

Other valuable sources are less accessible to those lacking rudimentary
knowledge of Yiddish.  Immanuel Olsvanger wrote several rich books of
transliterated Yiddish stories/jokes ("Royte Pomerantzen," and "L'Chaim,"
Shocken Books).  He transcribed dialects as he heard them.  Many books of
proverbs use him as their source.  Ignaz Bernstein wrote a superb book of
"Yidish Shprikhvorter un ??" that was reprinted in 1980s or so in
hardback; it's available either at CYCO or NYBC.  Shtutchkoff's "Oytzer
fun der Yidishe Shprakh" is literally an oytzer (treasure).  Both of the
latter are available in Yiddish only.  I recall finding other
Israeli-printed collections of Yiddish proverbs in a search long ago at
the Library of Congress.  Dov Noy, distinguished Israeli Yiddish
folklorist, has lectured in the US on Yiddish folk sayings; I've never
seen any of his work available in English, but I assume that he's
published in Hebrew.

B. John Geipel's book is IMO a readable, respectable and sympathetic
introduction to the history of the Yiddish language by a non-scholar.  My
memory is that Geipel is essentially a journalist, and not Jewish; he
nevertheless has done much research into the history of Yiddish.  He
lists an impressive bibliography; my guess is that he probably based his
book on half a dozen of the texts he mentions (zayt mir moykhel if I
underestimate his research).  Although certainly not a scholar's text,
Geipel's book is more serious reading than another excellent book about
Yiddish, Maurice Samuel's "In praise of Yiddish."  Samuel's book spends
more time than Geipel's does on Yiddish literature rather than just
language.  Samuel's book is filled with nostalgia for the culture
eradicated by the Nazis and Communists, and gives a wonderful (if
idealized) feel of the ta'am of the shtetl and Yiddish literature
(although some of his Anglo-English translations are a bit dated and
harsh on my American ears).  Both books are worth reading.
