Subject: Introduction

Hi, all.  I'm new to this list, so I thought I'd introduce myself.  I'm
Victoria, I am seventeen years old, and I live in Hawaii.  I know no Yiddish
whatsoever, except for "shlemiel" and "shlemazl" from the television show,
Laverne and Shirley. =)  I decided to join this mailing list to hopefully
pick up a few more words of Yiddish.  Well, that's about it.  Bye!

Subject: "eyf"

I beg to differ with David Braun's observations regarding the Libavitcher
Rebbe.  Anyone can purchase videos or cassette tapes of the Libavitcher
Rebbe's sikhes and clearly hear him say "af" and not "eyf."  In addition, I
know many White Russian Jews (from deep White Russia) and none that I know has
ever said "eyf," except sometimes in reading printed text or singing a Yiddish
song. The converb used by such White Russians is "uf." 

Yours Truly, 
Michoel Ronn

Subject: oyf, gloyb, etc.

In the light of the recent postings about regional pronunciations, I am trying
to classify my mother's dialectal affiliations.  Perhaps it would be easier to
do this geographically, but I am unable to locate her native village on any
map of Ukraine, partly because the village no longer exists!  (It was called
Olaskov and was destroyed in WW II.)  She also lived for a while in Golta,
which (I am told) does still exist, but has been incorporated into a larger
city, whose name I don't know.  I believe these villages were about halfway
between Kiev and Odessa, but I don't really know.  She also lived briefly in
Odessa before her family emigrated (i.e., escaped). 

At any rate, she pronounced the preposition "oyf" as _af_.  Well, my memory
may not be perfect here:  she also said _tote_, _mome_, so maybe she said
_of_.  (I tended to filter out the distinction between _o_ and _a_.)  Anyway,
I believe this is consistent with southern Ukraine.  ("U" was pronounced _i_,
"ey" was _ey_, "ay" was _a:_, "o:" was _u:_, etc.) 

I dimly recall that the verb complement was pronounced _if_, which according
to Mikhl Herzog, would put her in Volhynia.  But that seems too far north.  By
the way, would compounds like "aroyf", "tsunoyf", etc., follow the same
pattern? 

I also remember her pronunciation of "gloyb" as _glob_.  Perhaps that's even
more geographically restricted.  She also sometimes pronounced "oykh" as _ekh_
(not _eykh_), which I haven't seen mentioned as a possible variant. 

Another oddity was that she seemed to know the pronoun "men" only in the
abbreviated form "me" and only as the subject of a verb. 

Does this provide enough data to triangulate her birthplace?  I don't have
ready access to linguistic maps.

Nu, and if "AFN SHVEL" was founded by litvakes, do we have to continue writing
in transliteration "afn" (masculine gender) and force that pronunciation and
FARGRAYZTN YIDDISH on the young speakers? 
        
OYF, OYFN and OYF DER is found in several dialects and in learned Yiddish. 
Max Weinreich was a linguist, but also a "litvak".  Neither he, nor his son
Uriel were G-ds and Uriel admitted that he was struggling with the gender (As
did all northeastern Jews).  Since they both contributed a lot to the Yiddish

Subject: 'oyf' or 'af'

In Defense of "Oyf" in Transliteration

The controversy over "oyf" and "af" in transliteration has come up again, and
I'd like to lend support for the use of the former by citing positions of some
leading scholars.  

First - about Yiddish speakers in this country:  "Oyf' was not only used in
the secular schools, like the Sholem Aleichem and Workmen's Circle schools
that I attended, but Jean Jofen, the author of"Yiddish for Beginners" (l960)
who was of  orthodox denomination also used 'oyf'.  Yiddish printed music
almost always used transliterated texts beneath the notes:and there we find
that theater sheet music used 'oif' [oyf] as did Ruth Rubin, Sendrey,
Idelsohn.  The great Yiddish linguist Max Weinreich edited Y. L. Cahan's song
collections with 'oyf'.   Uriel Weinreich in his "Field of Yiddish" (I refer
to the first two collections that I have in my home) uses only "oyf'.in dozens
of examples.  (in Vol .1 -  Hrushovski, p. 222 'oyf di fayern', p. 228: 'oyf
lebn un toyt", p. 238: 'oyf der grozbank', p. 245: 'oyf mentsh un khaye", p.
249: 'oyfn yam', 255: 'oyf di kletser', p. 260: 'oyf der erd', p. 260: 'oyfn
shvel'),  Uriel Weinreich's own bibliographies of translations of Sholem
Aleichem and Peretz in this volume are likewise written in this form.  In Vol.
2:  Altbauer, p. 183: 'oyf dem hoykhn barg', Shmeruk, p. 283: 'oyfn mark').
In his Dictionary Uriel bracketed the word 'af' next to the word in Yiddish;
however in his College Yiddish, p. 30, he wrote that the word is "usually
pronounced AF."  (which I interpret as not always,  perhaps recommended).  In
the Max Weinreich History of the Yiddish Language, edited by Shlomo Noble and
Shikl Fishman, the 'oyf' form is used.   David Roskies used mostly 'oyf' in
his last book "A Bridge pf Longing"..

In Mordkhe Schaechter's  edition of Tsunzer's songs 'oyf'  however was changed
to 'af'.  And Shikl Fishman used 'af' exclusively in his "Never Say Die".

It was stated on Mendele that 'af' predominated in Eastern Europe -  certainly
in Soviet Russia where the Yiddish spelling was changed to "alef fey" as in
"Afn sprakhfront".  While it is true that Beregovsky used 'af'  (he also has
'oyf' in his earlier collection),  Ginzburg and Marek (St. Petersburg) have
both forms, Goldin, St. Petersburg: only 'oyf'.  Romania (Sekulets): 'oyf',
Poland - Mir Zingen: 'oyf'.  (My husband, Yosl Mlotek, who comes from Poland
also pronounces the word 'oyf' not 'af'.), Israel - Vinkovetsky-Leichter-
Kovner Anthology: "oyf'.  And I have consistently used 'oyf' in our song
anthologies and papers,  which I feel justified in doing, in conformity with
the precedents set by such leading authorities, scholars, teachers and
mentors.  I feel that American usage is as valid as Soviet pronunciation.

Subject: Afn shvel, kurve.

Olef.  Afn shvel.  Threshold is clearly of feminine gender in spoken Southern
Yiddish. The situation in Standard Yiddish is as follows:  in Mordkhe Tsanin's
"Fuler Yidish - Hebreisher verterbukh" (H.Leyvik-farlag, 1982), Rusish -
yidisher verterbukh unter der redaktsiye fun Moyshe Shapiro, Elye Spivak un
Moyshe Shulman (Moskve, Russkiy Yazyk, 1984) and based on the latter Kurtser
yidish - rusisher verterbukh (tsunoyfshteler - Gennady Estraykh, tsveyte
uflage, Moskve, farlag "Sovetskiy pisatel", 1990 - baylage tsu "Sovetish
heymland", num.8, 1990) shvel is feminine: DI SHVEL, AF DER SHVEL. However,
Modern eynglish - idish, idish - eynglish verterbukh fun Uriel Vaynraykh
(YIVO, NY, 1990), - in general somewhat skewed towards the Northern Yiddish
dialect, - gives both DI/DER SHVEL. 

Afn shvel, therefore, may be not simply a dialectal variant ("litvish"), as
Kalman Weiser (07.177.6) suggests, but quite a norm in the past. After all,
Froim Auerbakh (1892, Belts, Besaraber guberniye - 1973, Petach-Tiqva) named
his poetical debut in 1915 - "Oyfn Shvel". 

Beys.  Moshe Taube (07.181.9) noted a conspicuous absence of anything
resembling kurva (or kurova) in the Old Church Slavonic lexical corpus. I'd
like to add something to that effect. If proto-Slavic or (even more so) Old
Church Slavonic origin of the word kurva to be accepted, one can expect to
find it in any modern Slavic language (especially considering how little, if
at all, the invective lexicon has changed in those languages over ages). This
is not the case with Russian, though.  Kurva is distinctly of Southern Russian
origin (Malorossiya), with a shade of "foreignness" (Ukrainian?)  elsewhere in
Russia, whereas literary language more or less reflects the Northern dialect. 
It may be interesting to know what non-Slavic (Romanian and Hungarian)
linguists think of its etymology.

Subject: transliterated dictionary

Freydl Cielak (07.180) asks for recommendations for a Yiddish-English/English-
Yiddish transliterated dictionary. I have one called "The Yiddish Dictionary
Sourcebook: A Transliterated Guide to the Yiddish Language" by Herman Galvin
and Stan Tamarkin (Ktav Publishing, Hoboken, 1986). It is less comprehensive
than an unabridged dictionary, but it does have more than 8,000
entries--words, popular expressions, idioms, and proverbs. In the User's Note,
the authors say, "Our work is unique, for nowhere can one find such an
extensive listing of *transliterated* Yiddish. We have compiled a list of
common words and expressions that includes (1) the English transliterations of
the Yiddish; (2) the English equivalents of the Yiddish entries; (3) the
phonetic renderings of the Yiddish pronunciation; and (4) the spelling of each
entry in Yiddish using the appropriate Hebrew characters."  Yiddish
translations of English words are spelled in the Roman alphabet, and you can
look up the meaning of Yiddish words in their transliterated form.

Not bad. And much more comprehensive than Gross' "English-Yiddish/Yiddish-
English Dictionary," which has only 4,000 entries.

Having said this, let me add that I tend to agree with Sylvia Schildt, who
writes (07.182) that if you're learning Yiddish, you ought to learn the
Yiddish alphabet, which is, after all, not the impossible dream. But for those
who don't agree, the Galvin-Tamarkin transliterated dictionary is a good one.

And regardless of what you think about transliterated dictionaries, a zisn
pesakh to all.

Subject: "fowlup"

Concerning my posting in Vol 07.182:

1. In paragraph 1, the intention was "the Belorus-Northern Ukraine BORDER AREA
and the Polish-Lithuanian border area _oder_/_brider_". 

2. At the end of paragraph 2, the words "emerged before SY _hi:n_ 'hen'" 
should have been deleted.

Sorry for the fowl-up.
