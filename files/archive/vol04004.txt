Subject: Introduction

Glad to join you. I'm Moshe Maszlanka, Jewish History student, last year
B.A. in Tel Aviv University. Beside this I learn Jewish Culture and
Language studies. My background in Yidish is first of all from home, and
from the "idishe shule" Scholem Aleijem in Montevideo. (Many years ago).
I suppose that I'll be with you for a few years.

Moshe

Subject: Introduction

My name is Bernard S. Greenberg, you can call me Bernie.  I'm 44,n a
free-lance software consultant in the Boston area.  I grew up in an
unknowledgeable but ethnically paradaisical vanished-land called 50's
Brooklyn, and was raised as a Jew, and strongly exposed to a certain
brand of Ashkenazic Jewish culture.  Today I am an ardent atheist, a
secularist, and =deeply= involved in "non-Jewish" art forms (read, "Bach
sacred music").  Nonetheless, I retain an avid interest Jewish issues,
although often by way of comparison to "non-Jewish" ones. Language being
a particular area of my intrigue, -vor-allem- German, Yiddish holds a
particular charm for me (I can squeeze out the meaning of a Yiddish
newspaper with a bit of sweat).  I read the history of Jewry out of the
multilingual tapestry of the Yiddish lexicon and grammar.

I am deeply affected and moved by the tragedy of the Holocaust and the
murder of a civilization; no historical event has more formed my outlook
or affected my thinking, although the secularist message I read from it
disturbs many.  I am awed by the Vanished World, its imagery, its ways,
its modalities -- even if they are not the ones I would choose for myself
today (and its music -- I collect and cherish classic Cantorial
recordings.)

So I'll see what we have here....thank you for your welcome.

Bernie

Subject: Vos makht men in der Shtot fun Malokhim?

	In one weeks time I will be travelling to Los Angeles.  Please
tell me, anyone who might know, where are some good Jewish bookstores?
As a student of Yiddish, I want to get some books, maps and records, and
I would greatly appreciate any help you might be able to give me.

Subject: "Kushik"

Re: Mendele Vol 3.341 and Vol. 3.342 query/response  "Kushik"

Attn: Meyshe Yankl Sweet and Pavel Miladinovic-Cernoch, et al.

We are Lithuanian Yiddish speakers.  My mother was born and raised there
pre-WWII.  I asked her about "kushik" which the litvishe pronounce
"koshik."  We use the same Czech/Slovak word "koshik" to mean "basket"
which can connotatively be applied to any basket-like carrying device
such as a shopping bag.  A lot of Yiddish speakers in different regions
pronounce words differently than the litvishe do so regionally "koshik"
could likely be "kushik."

Another query (from my mother, the litvake, who isn't on email):

Does anyone other than the litvaken use the synonym "kontse" to mean
"basket?" For those who can read Yiddish in the vernacular, it is
written: kuf-alef-nun-tsadik-aiyin.

Thank you for any answers in advance.

Subject: oyver botl--can you spare a dime?

"Oyver botl" seems to be as persistent a topic this year on MENDELE as
"Judeo-Sorbian" was last year.  Here's another contribution.  In the May
13 issue of the _Forverts_, the Mloteks present the words to a Yiddish
theater song, set to the tune of the Depression-era "Brother, can you
spare a dime?" (lyric by E.Y. [Yip] Harburg).  The Yiddish lyric is
credited to Herman Yablokov.

Unlike Harburg's narrator, the speaker hadn't built a railroad, and
hadn't been the kid with the drum slogging through hell in WW I; he's an
aging actor whose great popularity has faded away.  The song ends:

men hot mikh aplodirt, blumen mir gebrakht,
kritiker bahandlt azoy fayn,
yedn oyf der nakht banketn mir gemakht--
itst derkent mikh keyner mer.
a tsveyter shpilt mayn role, trogt mayn kroyn
men anerkent nisht mer mayn talant,
men zogt az ikh bin oyver v'botl shoyn
efsher hot ir finf sent?

Subject: "Fornal"

In course of today's class in Yidish Literature, we found in Rikuda
Potash's poem: "balade fun main toitn zeide" the word "fornal" that
nobody could explain. If some of you could propose an explanation, a
whole class in Holy-Land will be gratefull. Thanks a Lot.
