Subject: B'rit Chadash/Lederer

I own one too; among Testaments, the Qur'an, the Urantia Book, and the
Book of Mormon, it is one of my most prized scriptures/translations...

The Lederer Foundation is a "Messianic Judaism" organization, who believe
that Jesus was/is the Messiah and the logical completion/Completion of
Judaism. They proselytize exclusively to Jews, and heavily emphasize
Jewish symbols, holidays, tradition, etc., and try to recast them all in a
Christian light. Although they meticulously avoid traditional Christian
terminology, names, imagery, and the like, their theology is 100%
straight-out-of-the-book Pauline Christology. I (an atheist with a
particularly avid interest in the conflict between Jewish and Christian
theologies) have engaged Barry Rubin, their director and in-house
theologian, at extensive length in written correspondence, and remain
unconvinced that anyone not wholly ignorant of history could find their
arguments compelling, or be inspired to any reaction other than laughter
laced with weeping for the millions of victims of the Judaeo-Christian
Tragedy (perhaps the only noun for which that adjective is valid).

The Einspruch translation is their piece-de-resistance; Einspruch's own
tale is available from the Lederer Foundation; in short, he, born Jewish,
found Christianity, or Christianity found him. I am astounded by the
obvious discrepancy between his substantial knowledge of Yiddish and
deeply flawed knowledge of its speakers that led him to produce a work
whose total _Affekt_, again, is tragic comedy.

Hoping not to veer too far off topic, Franz Delitzsch's early 19th century
casting of the New Testament into first-rate literary/poetic Biblical
Hebrew is, by contrast, a work of perverse genius far more worthy of
respect...

Subject: Yiddish Bibles

Roger Harris (6.153) wrote about a copy of the New Testament he found in
Yiddish.  Leonard Greenspoon, who holds the Chair in Jewish Civilization
at Creighton University, Omaha, Nebraska, delivered a very interesting
paper on Yiddish Bibles at the recent Klutznick Symposium held in Omaha.
I don't have his e-mail or 'krikht-post' addresses handy, but I can send
them to you privately (or post to the list if there is interest).

in answer to roger harris' query about that yiddish translation of the
new testament, i have a copy and got it quite a few years ago from the
messianic jews center in philadelphia. yes, it's done by missionaries,
of the 'jews for jesus' persuasion. i've been told there is at least one
other yiddish translation but this is the only one i've seen.

Subject: Bris khadoshe

I am reasonably certain that the Einspruch translation of the New
Testament (6.153) has been discussed before, on Mendele.  According to
the Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur (vol. 1, cols. 77-78),
Chaim (Henry) Einspruch -- who in his earlier career as a Yiddish author
wrote for the Poale Zion organ Der yidisher arbeter -- started writing
for missionary journals in 1915.  He took up residence in Baltimore in
1920, where the first edition of his New Testament translation appeared
in 1941, "in a correct, modern Yiddish," as the anonymous author of the
Leksikon article puts it.

There should really be no mystery surrounding its attractive design
features (it includes reproductions of famous illustrations by the
graphic artist E. M. Lilien).  It was most likely Einspruch's aim to
present the Bris khadoshe as a quintessentially "yidishlekh" book, one
that would appeal to its Eastern European-born, Yiddish-speaking
readership -- ideally causing them to be attracted by the message as
well as the medium. I don't know to what extent Einspruch succeeded in
that attempt.

Subject: The New Testament in Yiddish

I have also seen a copy of the New Testament in Yiddish.  This was in a
used book store in Boston in the late 1970s.  My eye was attracted to a
book in Hebrew letters in the foreign language section.  The title was
"Dem Nayem Testament."  I didn't buy it, and I don't remember anything
about who prepared the book or published it.  I assumed at the time that
it was published by some group intent on converting Jews, but so far as
I can remember, that was just my assumption, not backed by anything
specific in the book.
