A Little Exercise in Seeing and Hearing: The Case of Lifshe
Shekhter-Vidman's "Oy vey, mame" (with an apology
beforehand for not discussing what is most important,
namely the song)
 
                 by Yude-Leyb Proger (Leonard Prager)
 
Lifshe Schaechter-Widman {Lifshe Shekhter-Vidman} _Az di
furst avek_ {Az du forst avek}, A Yiddish Folksinger from
the Bukovina. New York: Gloval Village Music, 1987, 1990,
40 pp.  The pamphlet which accompanies the cassette (Global
Village Music, 1986) of these Yiddish folk songs prints the
words of twenty-one songs, ten on one side and eleven on
the other side of the recording.

Three texts accompany each song: a Yiddish text, a
romanized one and a translation.  Of the first we are told
that it "follows standard orthography"; of the second we
read that "LSW's dialect is more accurately reflected in
the English transliteration."  The reference is to the
_transcription_, which does not follow the rules of the
Standard Yiddish Romanization, which is based on Standard
Yiddish, but is a compromise between the morphophonemic SYR
and a partially phonetic rendition of the Bukovina dialect
(the singer was from Tshernovits). Were it a _translitera-
tion_ we would have letter-for-letter substitution.  It
would have been possible to indicate dialectal variants in
the Yiddish version, e.g. by writing -- as in the English
title -- daled yud _di_, but we find daled vov, which is
StY _du_, pronounced /di/ in Southeastern Yiddish.

The publishers are faithful to the principle of a standard
orthography, but they also wish to preserve the
phonological specificity of the dialect.  The pamphlet is
an aid to the English reader who may not know Yiddish -- it
gives him a translation and with some practice he can
follow the Yiddish with the help of the transcription.
Unlike the Yiddish reader he is left without a StY text --
which use of the SYR would provide. The solution of the
editors in theory has the practical advantage of serving as
a text for learning the marked features of the Bukovina
dialect.

Let me note that the authors do not give the singer's last
name in transcription -- it should be Shekhter-Vidman, as
is immediately clear from the Yiddish title.  In this
particular at least -- names are a thorny matter -- the
Anglicized name is given. In such instances I believe it
vastly simplifies matters to give the romanized Yiddish
name first, followed by the "common form" in brackets, e.g.
Lifshe Shekhter-Vidman {Lifshe Schaechter-Widman}.  This
formula gleans all the information present in the Yiddish
form of the name, and satisfies the linguists and the
librarians, two groups whose bibliographic demands often
differ.
 
Before going any further, let me say that this is an
excellent collection of folk songs, and if you do not yet
own it, order it from League for Yiddish, Inc., 200 West
72nd Street, Suite 40, New York, N.Y. 10023, USA, while it
is still available.
 
Thus far I have listened only to the first song with the
transcription in front of me. Here is that song in SYR and
in the transcription which purportedly renders Bukovina
dialect, one line above the other for comparison.  I print
in capital letters the supposed dialectal forms which I DO
NOT HEAR as such.

4.
(first stanza is repeated)
SYR -Oy vey, mame, der kop tut mikh vey            tut, mikh
Buk -Oy vey, mame, der kop tit mekh vey            tit, mekh

SYR  Vos toyg dir a dokter eynem oder tsvey?       Vos
Buk  Vus toyg dir a dokter eynem oder tsvey?       Vus
 
The dialectal features implied by the editors' transcription are:

Vowel substitutions: /i/ for /u/; /e/ for /i/; /u/ for /o/;
/o/ for /u/ in _uf_.

Diphthong for vowel: /ey/ for /e/.

Vowel for diphthong: /a/ fir /ay/; /o/ {spelled ou} for
/oy/.

Altogether we find here seven individual sound differences.

To sum up, I hear dialectal /zug/ twice as /zog/ (in the
first and fourth stanzas/, dialectal /mekh/ once as /mikh/
(in the first line), dialectal /nukh/ as /nokh/, dialectal
/os/ (spelled _ous_) as /oys/, dialectal /tsat/ as /tsaat/
and _mamen_ as /mame/.  I wonder, too, why the transcrip-
tion gives us _ekh_ on l. 7, but _Ikh_ on l. 8. This is
correct as far as what one hears, but does this variation
occur normally in the Bukovina dialect?  Is the word in
initial position always /iX/, but after all or certain
consonants /eX/?

I appreciate the fact that singers may take certain
liberties as regards vowel quantity and quality and even
with stress.  Was the singer distracted from her native
pronunciation by the Standard Yiddish text?  Had living in
America with speakers of many dialects contaminated her
own?  These are mere speculations based on the slim
evidence of a single song. My own suggestion would have
been to print the song in SYR with the dialectal variants
indicated in the margins.  This would also have brought
them to the listener's or reader's attention.  In its
present form the transcription is slightly misleading --
which does not, of course, make the song itself or its
delivery any less authentic. By alway using the SYR when we
write Yiddish in Latin letters we strengthen the use of
standard orthography in Yiddish and in transcription, and
we counter the impression held by many that one can write
Yiddish any way that suits one -- the way the English
spelled in Shakespeare's day.  This little exercise also
reminds me that hearing too is subjective.  What do you
hear in this song?
 
 
*There are a few frequently-used words in Yiddish which are
not pronounced as they are traditionally spelled, and thus,
as with words of the Hebrew-Aramaic component, the
non-native speaker must learn how to say them and how to
transcribe them.  Dovid Katz, in his highly innovative
_Grammar of the Yiddish Language_ (London: Duckworth,
1987), recommends the following pronunciations (p. 28):
af|,  afn|,  uf| (often mispronumced /oyf/, /oyfn/, /oyf-/,
em| (mispronounced /im/),  ba|,  bam| (mispronounced
/bay(m)/,  kam| (mispronounced /koym/,  kin| (mispronounced
/keyn/).  I would accept all of Katz's suggested
pronunciations as spellings in SYR except that I would
write _im_ while pronouncing /em/ and I would accept either
_kin_ or _ka_.  The Weinreichs and Mortkhe Shekhter have
done a good deal to safeguard _af_ against the inroads of
inauthentic _oyf_ (though it may be authentic in some
varieties of Yiddish). _ba_ and _tog_/_nakht_ are written
separately in StY; the dialectal transcription reflects the
actual running-together of the two words.
 
**The editors give the note: "_ou_ = 'O' as in _close_."
In the song I only hear /oy/.
