Subject: National Yiddish Book Center

Tayre Mendelers, as I proceed to fill our van with my zamler activated
book collections, a few thoughts pass through my little grey cells which
I would be happy to share with you.

The National Yiddish Book Center is not only concerned with rescuing
yiddish books from dumpsters....books continue to flow in through the
zamlers collections not only from the United States and Canada but from
all over the world.  These books are made available to all major
colleges and universities, many now have their own yiddish libraries, and
are recirculated to individuals and groups of people with an interest in
developing  and reclaiming their yiddish speech and reading knowledge.
Yiddish vinkles are forming vu mir kukt. A catalog is available upon
request with available books, sheet music, in yiddish, transliteration
or translated current material as well as the Jewish classics, als vus
mir veln.  My partner in zamlering in Phoenix would agree, I'm sure,
with the knowledge and pleasure that a little bit of yiddish continues
to bring to those around us.  Red yiddish yedn tog....es iz azoy voyl.
Mit gezunt,

Subject: _Tam-tam_

It is well worth the journey to France to spend a true happy hour (sans
liquer) with Tam Tam, if just to see di oysyelekh on a computer screen.
But there is more, so much more.

Charming you with graphics, and presenting literary selections pivoting
upon the unlikely topic,"Vegn Meshugene Ki un Andere Beheymes", they
hold your interest as they entertain and educate  until you've read
every word.

I found myself wondering about the editor (undeniably an intense
Frenchman) who views Mendele's "Dos Kelbl" as an "emese Romeo and Juliet
libe" and then maintains our interest in the "Ku Bukh" published in
Verona in 1595, extoling the cow over the fox, the lion and the donkey.
He continues with related proverbs, a touch of religion (the golden
calf), and  a poem by Bialostotsky I remembered from my youth (in the
olden days). I recalled that as a child I had dismissed it as an Edward
Lear nonsense rhyme. A ku in dorf U-hu un ir mu. Upon rereading this
morning, I saw his tribute to our stiffnecked, wonderful people who
would always have a voice (in Yiddish?) and would continue on, as in
"Ikh heyb zikh oyf vider un shpan avek vayter."

An added bonus:  footnotes in French to define Yiddish word demons or
Hebrew expressions used in Yiddish. Example - Oylem Habe = le monde a
venir, which adds a touch of spice to Yenevelt, and renews the joyous
concept of our presence in every land of this spinning globe.

Tam Tam is a spurt of Tam Gan-eden.

Subject: U va!

Khaym Bokhner used the expression, "U va!" in Volume 6.026 on July
2,1996.

My zeyde used this expression often (as he was a bearded, dynamic
"Yeah-to-life!" khosid.) I had always thought it his personal way of
saying "wow"!

Many times he added, "A teater!"

Any information about its use, derivation, meaning, etc. ?

I'm looking for biographical information about the Yiddish poet Eliezar
Shteynbarg, (d. 1932) who wrote "The Spear and the Needle."  I could not
find his name in Encyclopedia Judaica.  Does anyone know if his work is
still under copyright and if so, from whom to ask permission to use it?

I appreciate any help you can give me.

(I've enjoyed reading mendele during the last 6 months, and I wanted to
introduce myself to you, but I haven't had any time as I'm working on
two new recordings at the same time.  I hope I can better introduce
myself when the recordings are out.)

Subject: Nokh a mol "mishteyns gezogt"

In the July 5 issue of the English _Forward_ Philologos responds to a
query about the expression _mishteyns gezogt_, citing (via Zachary
Baker) a bit of dialogue between Noyekh Miller and Mikhl Herzog from the
early days of Mendele (1.42).  (The discussion in Mendele was later
renewed in 4.202, 4.208 and 4.213.)

Mikhl's explanation of _mishteyns gezogt_ as originating in a
"warding-off formula" (what James Matisoff called "malo-fugition") was
supported by the late Yudel Mark, who cited an example from an early
17th-century Prague letter: "den shteyn in der erdn gezogt," i.e., "it
should happen to the stone in the ground [and not to you/me/us...]"
(_Yidishe shprakh_ 3 [1943], 78).

In a later response to a reader's question about the expression
(_Yidishe shprakh_ 21 [1961], 64) Mark simply said that it came "from a
Middle High German formula."   As for its meaning, Mark explained that
it has various nuances (_kneytshn_):  "oykh mir a..., vos iz nor
kloymersht un nit oyf an emes, vos iz in a nideriker (shlekhter) mos
oder madreyge; vos iz do tsu zogn (reydn), vos ken men zikh do helfn;
nebekh, tsum shlimazl." He pointed out further that it can be
syntactically related to the preceding or following word.

Subject: Yiddish films

This message is part of a three-way communication. Ruth Segal, an
esteemed member of the Jewish community here in the North Country (I'm
in Vermont, Ruth's in NH, in the Dartmouth area) is getting Mendele
printouts from the Jewish Center office. Knowing I'm also a Mendele
subscriber, she's asked me to respond to a query and enter one of her
own.

She recalls that someone asked about Jewish films. Ruth cites the
National Center for Jewish Films in Waltham, MA, phone: (617) 899-7044.
She also refers to a catalog of Yiddish and other Jewish videos that she
sent for. The company is Ergo Media, Inc., 668 American Legion Drive,
P.O. Box 2037, Teaneck, NJ 07666-1437. The number is 1-800-695-3746. The
catalog lists a number of "oldies and goodies."

With reference to the discussion of Yiddish as a "dead" language: Ruth
recalls that in I.B. Singer's acceptance speech (1978), he made a
reference to this. Does anyone have the text or know how we can locate
it?
