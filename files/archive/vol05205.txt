We have just received sad news from Israel:  The well-known Yiddish
writer Elye Shekhtman passed away on January 1, 1996.  Shekhtman was best
known for his epic novel "Erev," first published in a condensed
(censored) edition in Moscow, 1965, and subsequently in Tel Aviv, 1974 (4
vols. in 2), 1979 (vols. 5-6) and 1983. "Erev" "encompasses the life of
Jews in Russia from the beginning of the 20th century until the 1970s"
(Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur, vol. 8, col. 768).

Elye Shekhtman was born in Vaskovichi (Polesie) on September 8, 1908.  He
studied in the literary faculty of the Jewish Pedagogical Institute
(Odessa), and after that resided in Kharkov and Kiev until the outbreak
of the German-Soviet War, when he became an officer in the Red Army.  He
was arrested shortly before Stalin's death and after his release he lived
in Kiev until he went on aliyah in 1972.  Aside from "Erev," he was also
the author of the books "Afn sheydveg" (Kharkov, 1930), "Farakerte
mezhes" (Kharkov - Kiev, 1932-1936), "Polyeser velder" (Kharkov - Kiev,
1940), "Ringen oyf der neshome" (Tel Aviv, 1981), and "Baym shkie-aker"
(New York, 1994).

According to information provided by our fellow Mendelyaner, Shoshana
Balaban Wolkowicz, Elye Shekhtman received numerous literary awards,
including the Itsik Manger Prize, the Chaim Zhitlowsky Prize, the
Fernando Jeno award (Mexico -- for "Baym shkie-aker"), Pras
Rosh-Ha-Memshalah (Israel), and the Congress for Jewish Culture award.

Subject: Dialects and standards

Regarding this matter, here is  a story first :
"Tzvei fraind bagegenen zich noch a zerlange tzait. Meh  tzekisht-tzech, meh
veint a bissl ,meh dermontzeh fun di amulikeh gite fraind.

"Iz vuzhe tit Yankl?"
"Oi a broch! er iz nifter gevoren"
Freigt vider der ershter parshoin :
"Nifter-pifter, parnuse hot er?"

Clearly,  the first  fellow was not familiar with the verb "nifter" a
euphemism  for passed away. This anecdote is frequently used to describe the
"balegules, am-hu-uretz" persons, whose Yiddish is not up to par.

Another, but true story :

In the immediate post W.W.II era  the Jewish communities in Eastern
Europe were flooded with free handouts of  Soviet Union published Yiddish
literature.  Even as a very young teenager I could realize immediately
that the Yiddish of these publications was different compared to books
published elsewhere. The spelling of the Soviet Yiddish  was grotesquely
phonetic : words appeared much longer than in "standard" Yiddish" It
appeared as if the Yevsektia - the Jewish Section of the communist
party, responsible for these publications, has decided to eradicate all
traces of the Hebrew roots from the written Yiddish  and hopefully quench
the Zionistic aspirations for a "solution of the Jewish problem". The
formal justification for the extreme phoneticism was to facilitate
reading by the "illiterate, suppressed masses of the Jewish proletariat",
lacking  the appropriate Hebrew background. Thus "kheyder" became
"chaf-ayin-iud -dalet-ayin-reish,"  rather than "khet-dalet-resh", and
"Khayim" became "khaf-alef-yod-ayin-mem" instead of "khet-yod-mem"

Since there is little hope that Yiddish will again become a language of
a vast segment of the Jewish population, with the exception of the
Orthodox, there appears to be no choice but to accept the dialects and
expressions as they are currently represented in the literature and hope
that future generation scholars will be able to understand and translate
the texts..
