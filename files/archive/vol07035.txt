Subject: Poetry in newspapers

In Mendele 7.030(4), Alvin Greenberg laments the days "when newspapers
published poetry." In every other issue of Der Forverts, Chana and Yosl
Mlotek write a 2-page column in the centrefold called PERL FUN DER YIDISHER
POEZYE. Besides selections from the classic Yiddish poets, past and
present, they provide interesting historical and biographical material
about the poets. This column has been a regular feature of Der Forverts for
well over 20 years. For this column alone it is worth subscribing to Der
Forverts ( which all Mendelyaner who can read Yiddish should do in any
case). From time to time, poetry appears on other pages of Der Forverts as
well. So, we need not lament the passing of those times. We still have
them, if we read the right newspapers.

Subject: a query about two possibly Yiddish phrases

I'm trying to figure out both the Yiddish equivalents of these two phrases, 
and also whether they're stock phrases.

The first was told to me by a friend in New York, about 30 years ago.  He had 
grown up speaking or at any rate hearing Yiddish, and he said, "well, as they 
say in Yiddish, where does it say in the Torah that what it says in the Torah 
is true?"  Is that a proverbial phrase, or was he making it up to shock me?

The second turns up a lot in Anzia Yezierska's _Bread-Givers_;  the heroine, 
Sara Smolinsky, is always saying, "I want to be a person among people."  
Again, is that proverbial?

Thanks in advance - 
Larry Rosenwald

Subject: Yiddish translation of Thoreau's 'Civil Disobedience'

I'm writing an essay about Thoreau's famous essay "Civil Disobedience," and 
wondered whether that essay had been translated into Yiddish, and if so 
whether someone could help me to find a copy.  This is not an altogether 
casual request, though I don't think you should drop pressing work to help me;  
the essay I'm writing is partly about the influence of the essay, and a 
translation into Yiddish would say something about that influence.  
Furthermore, I've often found that reading a work you know well in one 
language in a translation into another language gives you a fresh look at the 
text, and I'd be interested in seeing how a Yiddish translator rendered 
Thoreau's sentences and terms.  Thanks so much, 

Larry Rosenwald

Subject: Weinreichs' phrasebook

Coincidently, shortly before the brouhaha regarding this phrasebook started
(with Al Grand's posting about Michael Chabon's review of same), I had spent 
an hour or so casually rereading parts of that same book (nevermind why). It
struck me then that the book is a nice source of some reasonably idiomatic
Yiddish phrases (with English translations, of course) and also a small
repository of useful day-to-day words, such as various kinds of foods, (and 
`ferry' notwithstanding). I think someone wishing to improve their Yiddish 
could do worse than take a look at this book.
