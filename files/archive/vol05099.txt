Subject: Introduction

I am a translator and writer living near the small town of Kungalv, just
north of Gothenburg, Sweden. My interest in Yiddish was aroused in the
beginning of the seventies, when I happened to listen to a radio program
about writers in New York. Among the authors mentioned was a Yiddish
writer by the name of Isaac B. Singer. This was before the Prize. Somehow
this radio program fueled my imagination and made me want to know more
about Singer and about Yiddish. I went to the municipal library and found
ca. 20 Yiddish books. But I hadn't realized that Yiddish is written with
Hebrew characters! I couldn't even begin to read them. So I went looking
for a textbook, and found Salcia Landsmann's "Jiddisch: Die Abenteuer
einer Sprache". When I started perusing this rather nice book, I soon
came upon the next hurdle: many words were of Hebrew and Aramaic origin
and followed a quite different system of spelling than those of Germanic
or Slavonic origin. It was deeply unsatisfactory not to be able to make
out a words pronunciation from its spelling. I had to learn Hebrew!  So I
did that. :-)

When I became "wired" to the Internet I checked out for Hebrew and
Yiddish newsgroups and mailgroups, and I was very happy when I discovered
Mendele. So far I have been kind of lurking in the doorway, listening in
on the conversation, not knowing if I dare step in and introduce myself.
Now I have.

Mendele is a pure delight. I have downloaded a lot of the back issues and
started reading them. Thank you Noyekh Miller and all of you other
mendelyaner! You have already taught me a lot.

Subject: Genesis of Yiddish interest

In Mendele 5.078 Hershl Hartman continues the discussion of whether
Yiddish in translation, and Yiddish culture in general engenders interest
in Yiddish itself.

I am a novice Yiddishist recently come to the list, and I have had four
influences which have led to my interest.

1. Reading the Joys of Yiddish as a child.

2. My grandmother telling stories in which Yiddish words played a part. I
remember one (true) story about a thoroughbred race horse named
visgemirgedakh (please don't yell at me for the spelling.  I am completely
ignorant of YIVO standards. (What is Yiddish for mea culpa, mea culpa, mea
mea culpa?)).

3. Reading the stories of Aleykhem and Singer (esp. Satan in Goray, Gimpel
the Fool, and In My Father's Court) in translation, and being trained to
believe that translation improves almost nothing (the Rubaiyat being a
notable exception.)

4. Finally, I needed to hear the lovely Yiddish songs that are part of every
recording made by the Klezmer Conservatory Band.

I hope that this is a useful contribution to the discussion.

Subject: "Cease fire!" & Lithuanian yidish

In Mendele 5.098, Sam Abrash asks for the meaning of the punch line in
the joke submitted by Rick Gildmeister in Mendele 5.077.  In that joke, a
Litvak fires a rifle after a sergeant shouts "Cease fire!" explaining
that he did so precisely because of the sergeant's command.  As I
understand it, the joke is based on the litvish-yiddish pronunciation of
the "sh" sound which is a simple "s".  Thus the Litvak misunderstood the
word "Cease" to mean "Shies" (i.e., "shoot" or "fire") and thought he'd
heard the sergeant order him to "Shoot, fire!"  Have I got it right,
Rick?

Subject: Gesosn

To Sam Abrash:

From one novice to another, I believe I can explain the punch line of the
joke. It seems that many Litvaks were constitutionally incapable of
pronouncing the sound /sh/. Ths /shabbes/ would come out /sabes/. The
joke (a translingual one) follows from this Litvak peculiarity. When the
officer shouted /cease fire/, our innocent Litvak interpreted the command
as /shies fire/, or, in other words, as /fire! fire!/ since [shiesen=fire
or shoot]. Nu, hot er gesosn [=geshosen].

Subject: Yiddish for beginners

For those of us who are still novices and beginners, it would be
wonderful if those who write complete messages in yiddish would  also
supply a translation so that we, too, can better understand the language.
Thank you.
