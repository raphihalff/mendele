Subject: Jewess etc...

The discussion on the term 'Jewess' has led to interesting views and some
"presumed" rules.  In fact, as the discussion has shown, there is no
consistency in English and the addition of "ess" [or "ress"] has no
inherent "meaning" and may depend entirely on historical and, thus,
changing circumstances of usage.  Different times, different tam.

The animal argument falls when we note that even among the felines, we
have lioness and tigress but no panthress, lynxess, ocelotess, jaguaress
... And the "lesser" human argument also fails if we ask where are such
as Indianess, savagess, barbarianess, Mooress, Africaness, blackess ...
This is a matter for sociolinguistics, detailed historical analysis of
the history and context of development of a usage.  In Shakespeare's or
Scott's time, in England, the 'ess' is hardly demeaning, else why would
we find it in mistress, countess, duchess, baroness, princess, ... Of
course we need the expert advice of historical linguists and literary
analysts to tell us whether this use may have been a form of snide and
ironic contrast.

Ellen Prince's [close to but no pun intended] comment about contemporary
so-called P.C. policing is on the mark in this respect: but note that
here we run into political swamps: I find no problems with priestess and
of course Godess among certain feminists who might gulp at actress,
poetess or sculptress.  As I have never heard of an ess form of artist
(artistress?) it would appear that the formation of any such feminine is
partly/largely a function of sound tam in the language.  Any native or
near-native English speaker can find problems in the sound of various
forms, but we realize this is a matter of social learning.  Look at the
repetitive discussion of Yiddish sounds in Mendele!  That said, I will
add that FOR ME, in MY TIME, the use of "Jewess" always carried a tone of
condescension -- and the same for "Negress."  I assume it still does for
many if for no other reason than the absence of equivalent forms for
other ethnic/racial/national groups.  Fascinating, isn't it, that here we
find another example of blacks and Jews sharing something to the
exclusion of others.

Subject: "Frimzelish": romance elements in Mayrev yidish

Some of the old Mayrev dialects are fascinating because they seem to have
retained much more of the Loez component than the language found farther
east. Proximity to France may have something to do with it, or maybe some
sort of Judeo-Romance long dead now might have buttressed the words so
they would remain. The simple phenomenon of eastward migration couldn't
have caused it (Hey folks, we're moving east; let's stop saying
plankhenen), as the Yiddish is a "whole" and the "folk" do not
necessarily remember the derivation of a particular word.

Anyway, I just wanted to share my delight with the word "frimzelish"; the
"lish" is the equivalent of lekh/lakh diminutive plural. Let's line up
some consonants:

              F r m z l sh
              Ver micell i

The folk spirit remembers that vermicelli is diminutive and adds lish,
and gib a kik -- the carry over of c to z (Wazo, formerly Wazels) in
French gives you: Oiseaux Avicelli

Nu, this is amateur linguistics, of course, but to get around to the
point: Frimzelish are extra thin and fine noodles for soup, an authentic
Western Ashkenazi delicacy (kneydlekh? kreplekh? Neyn, frimzelish).

And I know this business of the "folk" is very 19th century and romantic,
but have rakhmones on a poor anecdotist. I like to think Lord Byron would
have liked it.

Subject: Echad mi yodeah

Chana, I'm not familiar with this Yiddish version of Echad mi yodeah, but
I know the one that starts out:

Mu Asapru Mu Adabru, oy, oy yam tarareeya
Ver ken zogen, ver ken reden
Vos di eyns bedayt, vos di eyns bedayt
Eyner iz Gott un Gott iz eyner, un vayter keyner

If you want the rest of it I can oblige.

Subject: ekhad mi yodeya

Chana Luntz asked about a variant of ekhad mi yodeya in Yidish.
I only know of the version sung by Theodore Bikel in his long
out-of-print, circa-1960 record "Theodore Bikel sings Jewish folk
songs" (Elektra EKL-141).  Words to it can be found in a Bikel
hardcover songbook that is also long out-of-print.  The first
verse is:

Mu asapru, mu adabru, oyskha, oyskha, yom da da day dum.  Ver ken
reden, ver ken zogn, vos der eyns bedayt, vos der eyns bedayt.
Eyner is got, un got is eyner, un vayter keyner.

You also might want to check the Yidish hagode printed by the
Workman's Circle.  I've got a copy but can't locate it easily.

Subject: Ekhod Mi Yodaya

Chana: A beautiful rendition of Ekhod Mi Yodaya can be found in an album
recorded by an Israeli chantuese (sp?), Yaffa Yarkoni. The album (tape)
is called "Rumania, Rumania" and is all in Yiddish.  She is a delightful
lady, and the album is likewise delightful.

It is a CBS Stereo Cassette (#40-62420) distributed by NMC Music, ltd POB
