Subject: Introduction

I am a linguist by training, and have a fascination for all "minority"
languages -- and their preservation. I would very much like to learn to
communicate in Yiddish. I'm fluent in both Standard German and in
Rhine-Palatinate dialect, so I have little trouble understanding most of
transliterated Yiddish. I need to learn the Hebrew orthography, move from
passive understanding of the Middle-German-derived parts of Yiddish to
active competence, and complete my vocabulary with respect to the Hebrew
lexis (I'm not Jewish, so I don't have the benefit of any more knowledge
of Hebrew than what I learned in one semester as an undergraduate many
years ago).

I hope I haven't broken into a list that is not for interested
beginners ...

Subject: Gib a kuk/a kuk geton: Slavic influence

Ikh tsitir fun der englisher iberzetsung, "The History of the Yiddish
Language," by Max Weinreich (University of Chicago Press, 1980; section
7.49, p. 528):

    Yiddish possesses forms that are strongly reminiscent of the Slavic
    aspects.  They are not identical to the Slavic forms; therefore, it
    is preferable not even to use the term *aspect*; but they are
    *aspectoid* forms at any rate.  One can say not only *ikh shrayb* (I
    write), but also *ikh gib a shrayb* or *ikh tu a shrayb* (I hurriedly
    write)...  How do these patterns get into Yiddish? Surely not from
    the first three determinants [i.e., loshn-koydesh, loez, Germanic].
    This type of systematically organized grammatical category is unknown
    there...  The tendency to have such forms is Slavic, and... they have
    developed only in those areas where Yiddish is coterritorial with
    Slavic.  The appropriate historical explana- tion, then, is that
    Yiddish constructed the aspectoid forms in the manner of Slavic from
    German-component material.

Thought this might shed some light on the Slavic-derived "ton."  I look
forward to reading more about the older "ton" which seems to express aspect.

I'd say those examples can easily paralleled:

English: "I have learned; .I cook; I do cook (cooking)"
German: "Ich habe gelernt; Ich habe ausgelernt. Ich koche; Ich tu kochen"

The last example, with do/tun - tun/tin, could mean more emphasis (in
English) or might be considered jargon (in German), but is correct to
construct ..

Yiddish.

Subject: Sholem Aleichem's letters re: Tevye

Dear Louis Fridhandler:  Your translation of those letters has
coincidentally given me sought-after information about my grandmother. My
grandmother, who died in 1967 at the age of 80, had said she was from a
resort town outside of Kiev.  She also said that her family milkman was
named Tevye, and that Sholem Aleichem had visited her town when she was a
child.  But, until I read your translation today, I didn't know the name
of that town.  My grandmother's three facts coincide with three facts in
the September 21, 1894 letter: Sholem Aleichem was staying in a country
home in a town in which Tevye was a milkman.  So, I've finally found out
the name of the town in which my grandmother was born and grew up:
Boyarka!   Thank you!

Subject: Men darft a lerer

Philadelphia's Gratz College is looking for a Yiddish teacher. Actually,
the group of us who took two evening sections of Yiddish at Gratz this
past fall and winter are looking to continue (we only got to page 40 of
Der Yiddisher Lerer!) and Gratz would like to accomodate us, but is
having trouble finding Yiddish teachers; Dr. Jerry Kutnick, who runs the
evening/continuing education division, asks anyone interested, qualified
and available to give courses at the Melrose Park campus to contact him
at 215-635-7300. Ikh ken tzuzogn shoin finf dankvare talmidim ....
