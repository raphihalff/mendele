Subject: Introduction

I teach psychology at Dawson College, a CEGEP, CEGEP which is unique to
Quebec.  I have spent a year learning to speak Yiddish.  I am not quite
flisig as yet, but am very hopeful. By the bye, if anyone has a copy of
any of Doyle's sherlock Holmes stories translated into Yiddish, I would
greatly appreciate hearing about it.

Subject: Introduction

I am an attorney working for the Department of Justice in Washington,
D.C.  I began studying Yiddish last fall at the D.C. JCC, in a class
taught by Mendele subscriber (and contributor) Leybl Goldberg.  I started
slowly, and began seriously studying the language only in January, 1995.
By now, I can work my way through a good deal of the Forverts each week,
and I can speak and under- stand the spoken language more than a bisl.  I
like to play my tapes of Yiddish children's songs for my 7- and 4-year
old children.

My parents are from Philadelphia.  My grandfathers both died before I was
born.  My father's mother (who came from near Kiev) spoke Yiddish, which
I heard on my frequent visits to Philadelphia as a child.  (My mother's
mother, who was from a well-to-do family in Budapest, frowned on Yiddish
and, as far as I know, never learned to speak or understand it.)  I also
occasionally heard Yiddish spoken when I was growing up in Washington, by
elderly relatives of friends, etc.  I remembered very little of the
language, however.

I have always been very interested in history.  Yiddish is for me a
natural entry point to begin to understand my own past, and the
(Ashkenazic) Jewish past.  Besides, it is a beautiful and expressive
language.  And, perversely, the decline of the number of Yiddish speakers
over my own lifetime (I was born in 1950) has made it seem to me more
worthwhile learning.

Subject: Introduction

I studied Yiddish in New York back in the 30's, attending the Yankev
Levine elementare shule and later at the JPFO mittltshule.  My father, an
immigrant tailor,  made many sacrifices to pay the tuition.  He loved
Yiddish  and wanted his children to learn and love the language as he
did.

As a young man, I dabbled a little in the Yiddish Theater - as an extra
(for a short while) with Maurice Schwartz's Yiddish Art Theater on Second
Ave.; and then bit parts with the Yiddish Theater Ensemble (an outgrowth
of the Artef) under the direction of Benjamin Zemach of the Habima.
Being unpaid, I maintained my amateur standing.

Although I can read and write, my  overall knowledge of Yiddish is very
weak, but with Mendele, it is slowly becoming stronger - despite  being
intimidated, and confused, by the etymologists and linguists.  But, I do
enjoy reading all the posts especially from the younger set all over the
world.

Subject: Genghis Cohn

Some time ago the Arts and Endowment Network on cable TV showed the dark
comedy "Gengis Cohn," a 1993 movie made for British TV.  It was based on
the novel _The Dance of Gengis Cohn_ by Romain Gary.

The premise of the book and movie is that the ghost of a Jewish comedian
who was killed in a concentration camp is out to get his revenge on the
SS officer who shot him.  And what could this "ghostly" revenge be?

By gradually turning the former murderer but now prosperous and respected
police commandant of a large town in Central Germany into a Jew!

The ghost's means of accomplishing this imposed "conversion" is by having
the commandant gradually, but inexplicably, sprinkle his high, polished
German with Yiddish words and expressions, and by suddenly developing a
craving -- and ordering in public! -- Jewish deli dishes.  It is as if a
dybbuk possessed the commandant, to his own and everybody else's
undecipherable puzzlement.

In one scene in a synagogue the ghost of the martyred Jew shows the
former Nazi how to say ka'dish over him.

I know, of course, the old Yiddish saying "af a mayse fregt men nit kayn
kashes" (don't ask questions about a story):  When it is, by design, a
dark comedy, allow for illogicalities, or implausible events, even if it
based on such a tragic background.

It is quite likely that the Jewishness of the comedian, prior to his
tragic demise, did not extend beyond some borsht belt (Catskill, N.Y.)
Yiddish words and expression for the sake of their supposed humorous
effect, and certain popular Jewish dishes. Thus, the character of the
supposed "judaized" postwar SS officer, in the fantasy of the revenger,
is but a mirror-image of his own former self.

Still, the implications are troubling.  Yiddish expressions and cravings
for Jewish cuisine do not make a Jew.  And one can not become a
bal-tshuve [penitent] by the force of a ghost without an inner voice from
one's own heart.  A ka'dish imposed by the ghost as revenge will
certainly not bring any comfort to the soul of the departed.

The concept of being Jewish without Jewish concerns, beliefs, and
teachings is meaningless.
