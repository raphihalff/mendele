Subject: Maurice Schwartz
 
Several years ago the Ohio State University (OSU) 
purchased a collection of manuscript notebooks, 
handwritten and typescript, relating to the Jewish Art
Theater of New York. There are 17 notebooks comprising 
over 1200 pages of manuscript in Schwartz's hand, 7 type-
script notebooks and various photographs and clippings. 

I believe a bibliographic and otherwise description of the
material will make for a very interesting article. Unfor-
tunately my knowledge of Yiddish is not enough to complete 
this task. I would like to notify the community of Yiddish 
scholars about the availability of this material at OSU
and invite interested parties to either cooperate with me 
in producing the description and some background material 
for an article or to do it themselves.  We will extend 
assistance to those interested.

               Bibliographer in Jewish Studies.
