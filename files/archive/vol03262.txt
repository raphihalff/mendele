Dvosye Bilik:

If you're asking what goes where the dashes are in the Purim song
you posted, I'm almost certain it's something like "Haynt iz Purim,
morgn iz oys".

Shalom,
Marnen Laibow-Koser

Subject: "Klezmer"

I would like to put on my musicological hat and respond to the
suggestion that the term "klezmer" is only an excuse to avoid using
the J-word. Klezmer music is only one kind of Jewish music--to me,
"klezmer" is a legitimate term indicating both a kind of repertory
and a style of playing it. There are many kinds of Jewish music, and
only some of them appear in the klezmer repertory. My response to a
mention of a concert of "Jewish music" would be "What kind of Jewish
music?" Without more information, I wouldn't have any idea what to
expect!

The area of "Jewish music" is extremely broad. Even if one confines
the topic to folk music, excluding both "classical" compositions
from Salamone to Bernstein and synagogue music, there are still many
repertories wwhich aren't really "Klezmer" music, even if a piece or
two should find its way into the performances of a Klezmer band. The
best-known of the other folk musics are probably the Ladino
repertory (known in the early music world as "Sephardic music") and
the Yemenite.  (Ofra Haza has popularized elements of Yemenite
Jewish music.) But there are many others, from groups all over the
world--Iranian, Bukharan, Ethiopian, Indian, etc.. In addition,
there are many kinds of Israeli music--the songs of the pioneers
(which seem to be melodically influenced by Russian folk music),
contemporary Hebrew popular song (i.e., the songs of Naomi Shemer),
and even Israeli rock, which sometimes sounds melodically "Jewish"
in the manner of Yiddish folk music.

The Klezmer repertory is an outgrowth of the Jewish experience in
eastern Europe. In its European incarnation, it included both Jewish
(Synagogue modes and hassidic compositions) and non-Jewish (local
folk music) influences, which were blended in traditional Yiddish
folk music. These were joined in the late 19th century by music from
the earkt Yiddish theater. Once Yiddish theater had become
established, its music became a permanent part of the Klezmer
repertory. There is also a specifically American component--the
stylistic influence of jazz, ragtime, and other popular music of the
1920's and 1930's. In the Yiddish theater composers of the 1920's
through the 1940's, all sorts of ecelctic influences appear. For
instance, Shalom Secunda's song "Mein Yiddishe Meydele" is actually
a tango!

The suggestion that as a general rule, the term "Klezmer" was only a
way to avoid the J-word seems odd to me, given that the word seems
to have had negative connotations in some cases. In some areas of
eastern Europe, klezmer musicians seems to have been peripatetic
players traveling from one ill-paid gig to another, much like
gypsies. It would appear that some people viewed a "klezmer" as
barely better than a beggar. For instance, it is said that Leonard
Bernstein's father didn't want his son to become a "klezmer." I
don't suppose that he would have applied that term to the conductor
of the New York Philharmonic!

I don't think I have ever met anyone, Jew or gentile, who thought
that the Klezmer repertory was anything but Jewish. "Some of my best
friends" are WASPS who play Klezmer music!

Subject: feygele

I would just like to further comment, that the bird/flying term for
homosexual also pertains to Spanish..the most common I have heard is
mariposa (butterfly) but in thPuerto Rican community, pato (duck) is
very common. This extends to sneezing (in an obvious fake way) when
someone who appears effeminate is around, and I have even seen
people giggle over eating duck...

I think it is intriguing to see what items seem to get lots of
responses on this list (as Harold Ohrbach wonders)..could we all be
wanting to be distracted from the world's horrific news (in general,
and from Israel in particular)...

Subject: "eklet"

Has any mendelniks heard of the yiddishism "eklet", rhyming with
(Sir John) Eccles.  As used by my mother, an immigrant at age 3 and
brought up in a yiddish-speaking home, the term was used to describe
her reaction to walking into a restaurant that did not meet her
minimum sanitation needs - i.e., there might have been a fly in the
kitchen, or a cat lurking around the back door leading to the
kitchen.  Usually, when saying that the premises "eklet" her, she
put on a face of disgust, and turned on her heels, refusing to eat
at the establishment.  I have asked my mother many times what the
yiddish word actually was, and my father alovhashalom (also a native
yiddish speaker) always laughed at her use of it, but neither could
or would say what the word meant.  Any leads would be much
appreciated.
