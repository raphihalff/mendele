THE ACADEMIC COMPONENT Participants enrol1 in one of four levels offered.
These intensive language courses occupy weekday mornings from 9:30 AM to 1
PM. Each level is taught by two professors (one and a half hours each), both
of whom are specialist in addressing that level's needs.

 Yiddish I: elementary (complete beginners)
 Yiddish II: intermediate
 Yiddish III: higher intermediate
 Yiddish IV: advanced

Students may be able to transfer Vilnius University credits to their own
transcripts. Please check beforehand with authorities at your home
institution.

The three higher level courses are conducted entirely in Yiddish. All four
courses aim at increasing mastery of Yiddish, as well the intricate complex
of cultural nuances and historical phenomena that are embedded in the
language.

The choice of reading materials is designed to elucidate the history of
Yiddish literature and culture, and to provide insight into a variety of
inclinations ranging from the traditionally religious to avant garde.

Upon completion of the appropriate level course, students are awarded a
Certificate of Vilnius University.

A variant of the last line:
"a gezunt in [moysheles/soreles] bekelekh"

Subject: Patche,Patche kichelach

In answer to Inna Barmash inquiry about the song Patche Patche Kichelach.  
That is the refrain in a song written by Moishe Korman and Music by Michel
Gelbart,called "In An Orim Shtibele".  It can be found in the collection
called "Pearls of Yiddish Song " compiled by Eleanor and Joseph Mlotek,
published by Workmen's Circle, N.Y.

From: rturkel@cas.org
Subject: ts/tsh

OK, I'll bite.  This is a feature characteristic of the Polish of the
Mazuria region of northeastern Poland, and is called "mazurzenie" by Slavic
linguists.  It also affects the Yiddish of that area as well as a
tongue-shaped area that extends up through Lithuania into Latvia. The
Biblical Shir Hashirim is called by people from there "Sir Hasirim," which
in Modern Hebrew means "The Pot of (all) Pots" and was the name of a book on
toilet training published during the 1960's in Israel.  :-)

Subject: "mershkuts gevorn"

Another interpretation in response to Diane Rabson's request for the
translation of "mershkuts gevorn" (09.056):  This is indeed a fusion of a
few words: " 'siz mir nisht guts gevorn", literally: "it got no good for
me", figuratively "I got sick", usually said when encountering bad news or
an unpleasant situation; comparable to our colloquial "I almost died...."  
I heard this often in our "Poylishe Yidishe Shtib".

Slivki: a geshmak vort.  Geshmak far di vos hobbn geentfert alts angemakhts,
marmeladeh, floymen compot, smeteneh.  Un takeh ver hot gevunnen dos
meynungs kontest?  Moshe Kijak shraybt az er hot dos vort nisht gekent
gefinnen in Stutchkoff's Oytser fun der Yiddisher Sprakh. Hot er nisht
shtark genug gekukt.  Slivkeh is tsitirt af zayt 227 alts a sisser smeteneh.

As much as I like "aygemakhts" and remember my bobbeh putting it into
tea...slivkeh for her had only one meaning ..."cream." This is confirmed on
Page 227, left hand column, 2nd line down of Stutchkoff's Treasure of the
Yiddish language.  Enjoy.

From: Serge Mitelman <simitelman@pol.net>
Subject: Porechkes

I've always thought that "porechke" is synonymous with "vamperlekh"  
(currants), but in the glossary to the story "Angemakhts" (Forverts from
Jan. 28, p.14) porechkes are said to be fereshkes (spelled as ferzhkes;
peaches). All other peyres in the sentence are in fact yagedes: molines
(raspberries), agresn (gooseberries), vanshl (sour cherries). What is
porechke?
