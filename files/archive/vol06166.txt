Subject: Black English and Yiddish

Does the current brouhaha regarding the the Oakland California school
board's decision to declare black English a language sound at all
familiar to Mendelyaner interested in attitudes toward Yiddish? For
those unfamiliar, the school board in Oakland, California, a heavily
black district, declared what they called "Ebonics," or, what is more
commonly known as black English, a second language, ostensibly to
procure federal funding to use it for teaching purposes. Black leaders
such as Jesse Jackson and the NAACP have declared that "it is _not_ a
language." Jackson went so far to call the decision a "disgrace."

From what I understand about black English, in addition to containing
unique appropriations of standard English vocabulary, it also employs
grammatical structures indigenous to West African languages.

I don't know enough about it to determine whether or not it constitutes
a "language," however, hearing the news report sure brought to mind
attitudes toward Yiddish.

Subject: Mikhnosaim/mikhnatayim

[This thread has been discussed under another rubric, the most recent
being 6.162. nm]

The reference to the question as to the correct or incorrect way of
pronoucing "michnatayim" (the modern Israeli version in popular use), or
"michnosayim", (the European version), is _no_ indication of one being,
or not being, a "yiddishist". This is a hebrew word brought into the
language of yiddish. A true Yiddish linguist would say, "hoyzn", for
pants. Right?? Hot mir a guten tog!

Subject: Mikhnosaim/mikhnatayim

This is to let Rick Turkel (vol.6.162) know that  he's not the only
modern Hebrew speaker out there among the mendleyeners. I too was taken
aback by Iosif Vaisman's reference to Sholem Aleikhem's  mentioning
"mikhnatayim" as the modern Hebraist's pronounciation for pants (which
is, correctly, mikhnasayim with a samech, not a tof) as opposed to the
Yiddishist's use of "mikhnosaim." I tend to agree with Arnie Kuzmack
(also vol 6.162) that S.A., in a humorous vein, was mocking  modern
Hebraic pronounciation of Yiddish words (of Hebraic origins), or even
more so, deriding those not so knowledgable Hebrew speakers who might
conceivably confuse the samech with the tof(sof).

Subject: Joseph Achron's music with a Yiddish flavor

Ron Robboy [6.162] comments on discovering some violin music of Joseph
Achron with Yiddish printed within the performance parts.  I also had
the same experience with Achron, though in a different work.

I was once asked to take part in a music festival at which music with a
Yiddish flavor was to be the centerpiece.  And I chose three works to
play.  One was Prokoffiev's "Overture on Yiddish Themes" (and that is
the correct title, not the often used "Overture on Hebrew Themes") for
clarinet, string quartet, and piano.  Wonderful piece.  I had played it
many times but never in the context of a music festival devoted to
Yiddish. The tunes sound very Yiddish but are not.  They are all
composed pieces.

And since we had this strange combination of instruments available, I
took out a work that I had had for a long time, Joseph Achron's
"Kindersuite," a work with a number of short movements with titles in
Yiddish.  Lovely work.

Finally, we decided to use some of the Yiddish songs of Simeon Bellison,
one of which ("Bobe mayses") was a perfect encore.

But the hit of the evening was, without question, the Achron.  It
is so rarely played and so very interesting.

I thank Ron Robboy for reminding me of that special event.

Subject: How many colleges teach yiddish

I don't have a definitive answer [see Stanley Werbow's query (6.163)]
for exactly which and how many colleges teach yiddish. I can only offer
that U.C. Berkeley does. Or at least it did 10 years ago. Through the
Department of German Language and Literature, no less. Hope this helps.
