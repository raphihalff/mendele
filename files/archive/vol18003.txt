Subject: sof-oyses

Does anyone know why the Soviet Union omitted the use of sof-oyses when
they wrote Yiddish.  I have seen a few examples of this.

Subject: visn fun tsores

Irwin Mortman writes: "If one is asked a difficult question the response
can be, 'Visn fun mayne tsores.' I know what each word means but I haven't
been able to translate it into colloquial English phrase".  I believe the
response is more like "Zol ikh azoy visn fun tsores," which means something
like "May I thusly know of troubles as I know the answer to that question."

Subject: visn fun tsores

For Irwin Mortman and the meaning of the answer "visn fun tsores": When a
difficult question is asked, the answer is, "ikh zol azoy visn fun tsores,"
which means it is something (tsores) that I wish I never knew, like I don't
know the answer to this mind-boggling question.

Subject: tshudak


I'm not sure if this is the term you are speaking of, but when I was an
intern at the National Yiddish Book Center, a favorite Yiddish term for
such a person was a "tshudak" - which I believe comes from Slavic.

Subject: Buzi

Ellen Cassedy's inquiry (Vol 18.002) about the name Buzi was clearly
answered - when used as a feminine name - by Sholom Aleichem in his
four-part story cycle, "Shir hashirim," The Song of Songs. Each section
repeats his explanation of the name of the hero Shimen's beloved, Buzi. In
Curt Leviant's translation:

"I once had a brother named Bennie (Benye). He drowned in the river. He
left an orphaned daughter. She was called Buzie. Short for Esther
(ester)-Libe. Libuzie-Buzie.  And she was as beautiful as the Shulamite of
the Song of Songs..."

Subject: s'glign tuenish

I forwarded this to a friend whose parents were from Gombin.  The "tuenish"
part was quite familiar to him, meaning "You shouldn't" (maybe an
abbreviation for "tu es nisht"?).  So, if "glign" is a mistranscription of
"lign", it could mean "you shouldn't lie."

He is posting the question to a Gombin group.

Bob Poe

[Moderator's note:  "glign" sounds like it could be a local pronunciation
of "gelungen," i.e. successful]

Subject: s'glign tuenish

I would like to suggest that the Gombiner expression simply means to talk
to you about something that happened... a "tuenish" is happening...a
something done.

Subject: oyf kest

The answer to the question in item 4 [of vol. 18.002] is "kest" or "oyf
kest. This is a transliterated spelling; if the word is Hebrew, I don't
know how it is spelled.
