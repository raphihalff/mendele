Subject: Yiddishland

Dear friends:

There exists in Swedish a fine book "Jiddischland" ("Yiddishland", Bokforlaget
Nya Doxa, 1996) by Salomon Schulman (b. 1947), a son of surviving Polish Jews,
nowadays a children's doctor, writer and translator (he has a o translated I.L
Peretz into Swedish). Below is a translation, a bit rude perhaps, but it
should be interesting, from the introduction.  Schulman presents Yiddish
culture as a coherent unity. He writes about everyday life in the shtetl,
literature, music, film, Bund, Jews in Bolshevist Russia, Holocaust, the story
of Jews in Sweden, Hasidic strains etc.  Through all this runs a desperate
longing for his unseen brother Zwi, murdered by the Nazis four years old. "Too
young to live but old enough to die", as Schulman writes. 

I hope you'll enjoy this little tidbit.

Salomon Schulman: From the introduction to "Jiddischland"

In Yiddishland

"Way up in my teens when people asked which languages I could speak I replied
with an enumeration that excluded Yiddish, as I only spoke that language with
a selected few. When these few individuals in their turn had to state what
language they spoke, they almost always replied: "German".  With my own school
German as a reference I could hardly believe that anyone would swallow this
white lie. And when more and more _gojim_ self-centredly stated that in that
case it had to be Swiss German I was on the edge of bursting with laughter. 

These repeated scenes were of course rooted in Jewish tragicomedy. Yiddish was
their caste mark and the language of their sufferings. For them it was a
question of hiding their stain, having been the chosen Untermenschen, mocked
by all and everyone. 

They mediated their idiom to us with an extreme hesitation, if at all. Many of
them wouldn't like to see us as the next doomed generation, worn in these
fragile linguistical clothes. In our homes there was a constant, almost
desperate, mixture of Polish, Yiddish and Swedish. 

In a paradoxical way the situation reminded of the 50's in the Soviet Union.
The son of a Russian Yiddish poet once tried to explain to me why he didn't
speak Yiddish. Nobody at all _spoke_ Yiddish, he said, it was _whispered_

I had the good luck myself of being fed with Yiddish rather constantly. The
rest was an unbelievably confused mix of Polish and Schwedish ("Schwenska"  in
the original, alluding to the German "Schwedisch" and the Swedish "svenska" -
IJ). I must admit, however, that it was a relief for me to begin going to
school, being able to escape from this cacophony of words and at last polish
that so often criticized accent of mine. 

You may imagine my astonishment when I, about 15 years old, picked a Hebrew
book out of my dad's bookcase to contemplate the boring prayers. They looked
just like the ones I had gone on with in _cheder_. To my surprise the book was
written in a totally incomprehensible Hebrew. I had heard about Armenian, but
it would have been very much unlike my dad to keep the knowledge of such an
ancient language for himself. 

Then as a bolt out of the blue the first word appeared from this blurred mass
of a text: Brezezin. Brezezin, hell that was my parents' hometown! 

Then I continued, as a matter of course, to spell my way through this
presumptive Hebrew publication that showed up to be printed in pure Yiddish!
Within the course of some minutes I was delivered of my illiteracy. A whole
world opened up for my enthusiastic eyes. 

Now, when I have become a cultivated person, goodness gracious me, and people
ask me which languages I speak I always first of all, and with pride, reply:
Yiddish."

Subject: Yiddishland

Yes, Gitl, there is a Yiddishland. No mere metaphor, it was not only my
country, it was the land of my birth.

I think Harshav was talking of palpable fayer un vaser un himl un erd in his
wonderful anthology,  _American Yiddish Poetry_ University of California Press
1986 ISBN 0-520-04842-3. I quote from page 22.

"It is important to realize that when a Yiddish poet wrote poetry, that poetry
was not part of a normal nation-state with a stratified society. The Yiddish
poet did not have Yiddish schools, universities, philosophers, sociologists,
research institutes, police stations, bus drivers and such all around him.
Literature was "everything." It was a substiture for religion and for
statehood, it was a state in itself, "Yiddishland"; to abandon it was to
abandon the whole culture. Hence the enormous importance of literature in the
eyes of its adherents......"

To try to chronicle Yiddishland, the Secular Jewish home in its heyday, its
vigor was about  political activism that was geknipt un gebindn to a burning
love, akin to religious fervor, for 'enormously important'  literature. I
remember there was always a 'minyan' in our crowded, unspacious living-room,
and much heated literary pilpul about Asch or Yoshe Kalb or Avrom Reisen or
fe, Bashevis or Peretz or Dovid Edelshtadt,,,,, but, Gitl, not about religious
literature -  no Hillel or Shamai and whether you could eat an egg if the hen
laid it on a holiday.

Gitl, if you had been at this round table and had seen the reverent faces of
my relatives in debate, or of the ingenious Arbeter Ring teachers whose energy
filled us with their idealism, you too would have believed in the religion and
patriotism of Yiddishland, in the statehood of thisYiddish Camelot.

My memories, so sweet and deep, sweep me a step beyond Harshav; literature was
not a substitute for, it was, religion and statehood for them.

It seems that the word Yiddishland became better rooted in French, where I was
able to find it in five titles (as oppose to zero in English). Why?

Subject: Yakhne

A friend of mine was telling a story in which the word "Yakhne" had a
prominent part. I have heard a word that has a similar sound, specifically
"Yakhtsn," which, according to Weinreich means "a privileged person." There
are all sorts of possibilities of using that word with heavy sarcasm. But
"Yakhne," which Leo Rosten defines as a gossip or a shrew, is not to be found
in either Weinreich or Harkavy. I am assured that in the Bronx, it was used a
great deal. Not having lived in the Bronx, I cannot vouch for this. Can anyone
enlighten me.  Thank you in advance.

Subject: Zvi Kolitz and Yidishe Tsaytung

Marion Troia asked about "Di Jidishe Zaytung" [07.194]

I believe the New York Public Library has Di Jidishe Zaytung (El Diario
Israelita) on Microfilm from 1923-1973 complete.  It can probably be borrowed
via interlibrary loan.

A big "yasher koah" to Manaster Ramer. It's just this mishmash of his
scholasticism and our armchair linguistics that makes Mendele so exciting.
