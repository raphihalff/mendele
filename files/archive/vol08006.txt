Subject: Swiss Yiddish vs. Swiss German

Velvl Winocur asked about Yiddish and Swiss.

There is unfortunately not a simple answer, but a two-part one.

(1) Swiss Yiddish and Swiss German sound somewhat alike because Swiss Yiddish
is spoken with a Swiss German "accent".  This means that the precise way
various sounds are made is like in Swiss German.  This is a recent
development. 

(2) Deeper down, Swiss Yiddish and Swiss German are no more related than
Lithuanian Yiddish is to Swiss German or Swiss Yiddish to Berlin German. Like
all Yiddish dialects, Swiss German can only be related to early medieval
German and although there is a controversy as to which dialect of medieval
German Yiddish is related to, Swiss is not a candidate.  This is proven by
such facts as Swiss Yiddish having the diphthongs in words like hoyz, moyz
where Swiss German has monophthongs and a host of other facts about consonants
and vowels as well as about the endings of words (morphology), the vocabulary
itself, and so on.  These characteristics unlike the accent mentioned above
are centuries-old. 

At some point we might want to talk about how we know that the accent is
recent and the other things old--if people are interested. 

NB. In fact, we know from historical sources, that the Jews who speak Swiss
Yiddish are recent arrivals in Switzeland from S. Germany.  I dont think
anybody knows what happened to the presumably quite different form of Yididsh
which was spoken in Switzerland in the Middle Ages.  I am not a historian and
may be wrong, but I THINK the medieval Swiss Yiddish was spoken in the cities,
whilst the modern Swiss Yiddish is only attested in a few villages.  But again
even the medieval Siwss Yiddish, of which only a little is known, was an
import from somewhere else in Germany and not directly related to Swiss
German.

Subject: We've come a long way, kinderlekh or some words of cheer

While searching for some information previously dispensed on Mendele, I came
across the following:

"Mendele: Yiddish literature and language
"Contents of Vol.1 No. 1
"May 15, 1991

"Oyfn rekhtn fus (Noyekh Miller)

"At last Mendele is ready to go public. We have as of today a total of 22
subscribers (list on demand) and a very good roster it is. And while we're
neither in Czernowitz or Vilna we may be in the start of something that none
of us might have thought possible 10 years ago. Let us hope so.

"A word about my role. I'm the shammes. That means that everybody can (and
should) offer advice, criticism, help. The only thing I ask is that you
contribute regularly and often....."

The postings that first day were from Mikhl Herzog (answering some questions
for N. Eshelman about deciphering Yiddish documents) and Ellen Prince asking
for translations from native speakers). We are fortunate that both Mikhl and
Ellen are still stars in our firmament.

And to Noyekh, our renewed gratitude and deep respect. Zolst lebn un zayn

Subject: Polymer particle called "knedel"

Yesterday I logged on to the Science Daily and read the following headline:
"Polish Dumpling-Like Particls Has Potential in Drug Delivery," and when I
read the article below it, I felt that I had to share it with my Mendelyaner
friends. Following are the first two sentences of the article: "Chemists at
Washington University in St. Louis have created synthetic polymer particles
that are as cute a dumplings.  They're call knedels (k-ned-l), after a popular
Polish dumpling filled either with meat or sweets." 

Yiddish has entered the world of chemistry, and am I delighted!  The article
was of particular interest to me and I had hoped I would learned who it was in
the laboratory working with these new particles that had the good sense to
give give them a yiddish title. That information was not disclosed.  The
particles are described as follows:  "They're like golf ball molecules..." and
"This advance moves us along in our goal of making knedels potential drug and
gene-carrying systems.  It makes the particle a lot more versatle and the
rubbery core should allow a higher loading capacity.  We've gotten lots of
interest in the knedels, for their potential, they're novelty and their name."

Isn't that a "kick," Mendleyaners?  I love it!

Sylvia Schleimer

[Moderator's note: Knedels were created by Bruce Thurmond, Tomasz Kowalewski,
and Karen Wooley and described in several papers in 1996 and 1997. Tomasz
Kowalewski, who apparently suggested the name, perhaps referred to Polish
knedels and may have not been aware of the Yiddish "link". For true Yiddish in
chemistry see paper by Henryk Eisenberg of the Weizmann Institute published in
the European Journal of Biochemistry in 1990 (vol. 187, pp. 7-22). The title
of the paper: "Thermodynamics and the structure of biological macromolecules. 
Rozhinkes mit mandeln."  - i.v.]

Subject: Yakhne

Dear Mendele

My Booba and Mother also used Yakhne pejoratively- it often seemed to mean a
woman who gossiped about other people.  They would say ' zee iz a greisse
yakhne', and it would be a warning to avoid the woman.  My Booba came from
Minske Gebernye ( the Minsk district of Russia], in 1898 to the East End of
London, and lived in London and Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex all the rest of her
life. So it would be a word that came from 'der heim'. Bronx users would have
also brought it there from their shtetlach.

Subject: Yente, Yakhne

I read somewhere, long ago, that Yente and Yakhne are both Yiddish corruptions
of beautiful Spanish names: Juanita and Johanna, respectively. 

Whether this is correct I have no idea, but it seems not altogether
impossible.

Subject: 1. Feygl; 2. Again Yakhne and Yentl; 3. ikh

1. Joachim Neugroschel (8.005) asks for more about the Yiddish name _Feygl_. 
I'm quite certain that it's derived from the German _Voeglein_, a regional
variant of _Veilchen_ 'violet'. In Yiddish, it has been mistakenly assumed to
have something to do with a _foygl_ 'bird', but note that Yiddish _feygl_ is a
plural form and as such is not a likely candidate for a girl's name.

_Feygele_, in addition to being the regular diminutive of the l-stem _foygl_,
obviously has other connotations as well--a male homosexual. It was the
subject of some discussion on Mendele several years ago. One of our
subscribers, Meyshe Yaynkl Sweet, has written an interesting article on the
subject and may be willing to say more about it. 

2. Since the subject of the names _Yakhne_ and _Yentl_ (and its derivative
_Yente_) keeps coming up, Iet me repeat the following: 

_Yakhne_ is a woman's name, unfortunately stereotyped, pejoratively and, like
the pedigreed name _Yentl_ (< _gentile_ 'high born'), rarely bestowed in
modern times. Harkavi, in his Appendix of Names, suggests a connection between
_Yakhne_ and _Yokheved_. Perhaps, but more to the point is its probable
derivation from Middle High German _jachant_ 'hyacinth', 'jacinth' (< Latin
_jacintus_ < Greek _huakinthos_). The derivation of Yiddish feminine names
from the names of flowers is common. To wit:  See above, _Feygl_. 

3. Sorry, David Sherman, even though you're from Toronto, I have to say that
Yakhne has nothing to do with _yakh_, the stereotypically Polish Yiddish
variant of _ikh_ 'I' (Warsaw and elsewhere--I don't have the map at hand).

From: Serge Mitelman <simitelman@pol.net>
Subject: B.Feldblyum's Russian-Jewish Given Names: A Recension.

By way of confirmation of Mikhl Herzog's posting about the derivation of
Yakhne, the newly published book "Russian-Jewish Given Names (Their Origin and
Variants)" by Boris Feldblyum (Avotaynu, 1998) lists Yakhne (and Yakhe) among
the kinnuim of the root name Iojkheved (Russian Iokhaved), {Exodus 6:20}. It
also hesitantly derives Fejge from the German Voglein. 

The long awaited book brought (at least to me) a great deal of disappointment,
especially on the backdrop of the brilliant series of Alexander Beider's
dictionaries of Jewish surnames by the same publisher. It is based on the
older Russian text with an abstruse and untranslatable title - "Sbornik dlya
soglasovaniya raznovidnostey imyon: bibleyskikh, natsional'nykh,
talmudicheskikh i drugikh, upotreblyaemykh evreyami v Rossii" (Collection to
reconcile variations of names: Biblical, ethnic, talmudic, adopted and others
- as used by the Jews of Russia), Zhitomir, 1911, compiled by Iser I.Kulisher
- Uchyonnyy Evrey pri Volynskom Gubernatore (Learned Jew in the Office of the
Volhynian Gubernator). 

In the introduction the author states that "it (the book) is limited in its
discussion of Yiddish onomastics" and implies that its interest to ordinary
people may be in "choosing a newborn baby's name or making a genealogical
connection with an ancestor". It may indeed be helpful for genealogical
research, but other claims are hard to substantiate:  1)more names are missed,
than listed - although an advertising annonce boasted it to contain some 6,000
names, and this may very well be true, but the vast majority of them are
variants of the same Yiddish names as used in a phonetically distorted form by
all varieties of surrounding gentiles, to the 2) exclusion of the original
Yiddish name and dialectal variants. Basically, it provides all examples of
bureaucratic distortions and misspellings, found in numerous documents in
Russian. This may interest a genealogist, but obviously not the parent
"choosing a newborn baby's name". Some examples: 

One can find the name Aba (as is usually written in Russian), but not Abe or
Obe; Shaya, but not Shaye; Brajndel' and Brajndlya, but no Brajndl; Rakhil',
Rukhlya, and Rokhl, but no Rukhl; Ruvim, Ruven, Ruvin, and Ruven', but no Ruvn
or Rivn; Zlata, but no Zlate or Zlote; Fajvel', but no Fajvl or Favl; Avraam
and Abrumchik (!), but not Avreml' or Avreyml; of course, there is no Shike,
Shikl, Izya, Olter, Bume, Sunye, Tsolik, Shopse, Kolmen, Khane, Khontse,
Shunye, Lyusik (masculine), Nyome, Zolmen, Monye, El'yuhi, El'yui, Dushe
(masculine), Molke, Nokhmen, Mekhl, etc., etc. But there are Burakh, Burukh,
Movsha, Moshka, Itska, Itsko, Mordko, even Gleb and Vasiliy (!). Feminine name
Khona is ascribed to the "Baltic area, present day Latvia", Berl - limited to
Volhynia, Nakhmen is said to represent a local variant of Nakhmon in
Lithuania. Nyuma is given as a kinnui of Veniamin (Benyomin, Benyumin), when
it seems to be more often Naum (Nokhem, Nukhem). In the glossary section there
is the following sentence to exemplify the word "vernacular": "In the context
of Russia - Jewish name Zelik - instead of AVRAAM, SOLOMON, RUVIM - is a
vernacular name". 

Hence, in the conclusion, the book records whoever attempts at articulating
Jewish names, but the Jews proper. The author could gather more names (and
correctly spelled ones) if he consulted his own grandma, rather than the
enumerated archives. The theoretical part is quite interesting, but can be
found elsewhere.

Subject: Yiddish culture, Jewish state, and Dana International

It was hard to fail to notice two materials published side by side in the
recent Forward (May 15, 1998, p.3). One article tells us that the Israeli
pop-star Dana International won the Eurovision song contest. Now Israel is
invited to host the competition in 1999. Despite some strong protests from
various quarters, the Israeli government is looking favorably into staging the
event, that will cost $10,000,000 (that is ten million dollars). Tourism
Minister Moshe Katsav is quoted saying: "I think it's very necessary to have
the Eurovision here".  For his good attitude Mr. Katsav earned few kisses from
Dana International at the reception in the Knesset in her honor.

The story from another article is a bit different. The Forward Association
contributed $10,000 (that's three zeros short of the number in the previous
paragraph) to support the International Conference of Yiddish Culture in
Israel this summer, because the Israeli government refused to allocate the
money it had promised for the conference earlier.

No, I am not that naive. I fully recognize the difference in the relative
significance of the Yiddish culture on the one hand and the art of Mr/Ms Dana
International and her coleagues on the other. I also realize that $10 million
is a large sum, and the Israeli government should tighten the belt to save
enough for next year. $10 thousand taken from the Yiddish conference would not
of course solve all the problems, but perhaps can help a lot. Maybe there is
some other simple explanation, e.g. that support of Yiddish is handled by the
Education and Culture Ministry which happened to be more stingy than the
Tourism Ministry.

I have been taught that non-constructive criticism is worthless, so I suggest
a very practical idea. If Mr. Katsav agrees to divert just 10% of the
Eurovision budget (which would not hurt Dana International too much) to
support Yiddish culture in Israel, I would personally lead a brigade of
Mendele volunteers to kiss Mr. Katsav (and other cabinet members if necessary)
on both cheeks. True, I am no pop-star, but a kiss from a computational
biologist is also worth something. Isn't it?
