Subject: Introduction

My name is Etan Cohen and I am a sophomore in college. My major is
Yiddish with a special interest in Yiddish liturature. As I spoke no
Yiddish at all before this year, I began learning it as part of my
studies. I'm enjoying it a great deal and am very excited about becoming
a part of Mendele.

Subject: Petrushke; Yiddish after 50 years

My mother uses the word "petrushke" (which she pronounces *petritshke*)
to refer to parsnip, not parsley. She also uses the word "arbes" to refer
only to chickpeas, not green peas (which seemed to confound Dr.
Schaechter).

A while back Glen Levine, I believe, asked about the level of Yiddish
among people who had not used the language for several decades. My father
grew up speaking Yiddish in the home, but did not use it as an adult.
When I began to study Yiddish and would ask him questions, it was the
first time he had used Yiddish in many years. Now, he can understand
spoken Yiddish and remembers individual words if I ask him, but he has
difficulty producing complete Yiddish sentences.

Subject: "Only in MY family..."

I will respond to [Dovid Braun's] challenge.  In my family a child who
fooled around, acted silly, etc., could be called "a silly gazinkas..."
After Yiddish speakers assured me there was no such word in Yiddish (and
it certainly isnt in English), I decided it was a family word made up in
the following way:  On the pattern of English "silly goose", the Yiddish
word gants (well known in the family in the expression 'gants gut, kachke
besser'-- we tried to be funny in Yiddish even with minimal language
skills) was given the *Lithuanian* suffix -inkas, actually an agent
suffix like English -er in pisher (:-)).  My zeyde certainly knew
Lithuanian, and even moderate contact with the language would familiarize
one with this very common suffix.  (The Lith word for goose is 'zha:sis,
so the whole word 'gazinkas' isnt Lith.)   The combining of a Yiddish
word with a Lith suffix would contribute to the humorous effect in the
whole context. My mother's generation, with much less linguistic
sophistication than my zeyde, dropped the first 'n', and *ganzinkas
became gazinkas. Anyway, I'd really be surprised and delighted if this
turned out to NOT be a family word!

Subject: Un vos bin ikh -- a hunt?!

The Yiddish for "What am I, chopped liver?!" is "un vos bin ikh -- a
hunt?" (This is assuming I know what the English expression means. I've
heard it only in the past 5 years.  All the times (but once) the idiom
was used in such a way as to mean that _chopped liver_ is something
lowly, disgusting, worthless.  In one instance, I heard it with the
opposite meaning -- actually extracted from the full idiom:  "Why does
everyone think she's chopped liver?!" i.e., 'hot stuff'.  Chopped liver
has very positive asociations in Yiddish foodlore, so if the "canonical"
use of the idiom treats chopped liver as something yucky (in technical
terms), it probably doesn't come from Yiddish.  But maybe I've
misunderstood the English idiom.

Subject: Chopped liver

The query in Mendele 4.155 about "chopped liver" as a metaphor reminded
me of a line often used by my Litvak bubbe, aleha ha-shalom.   When she
was feeling left out, she used to say:  "Vos, mayn neshome 's a
rozhinke?!" (What, is my soul a raisin, some kind of dried-up thing?  I'm
also a person worthy of respect and dignity!)

Curious if this phrase is widely known....

Subject: Pasternak/posternak

Any explanations for the pronunciation [posternak] 'parsnips',
specifically with [o], in NON-tote-mome-Yiddish?  I'm aware of it from
Northern Poland and other perhaps some areas.

Subject: Nukhem Stutchkoff

Well known for his magnificent Yiddish thesaurus, Nukhem Stutchkoff was a
prolific and high quality author of both radio drama and commercial
copywriting. (In fact his commercial advertising prose--mostly for
Manishewitz matzos--was so well written that numerous listeners said that
they never tuned to other stations during his commercials because they
would always want to hear him find a new way to describe a matzo...). In
addition to writing the plays he was a very skilled actor on-air (a GREAT
dialectician...vu den?) in addition to directing the programs and reading
all his ad copy. The only thing he didn't do was play the organ intro to
the show.

Given his full-time non-stop radio career from 1932 (on Brooklyn's WLTH)
to the late 40s (for WEVD) it is sobering to consider that, for all
intents and purposes, Stuchkoff's "der oytser fun der yidisher sprakh"
was compiled in his spare time! (In addition to his dramas he even
produced a short lived show about etymology and folklore called  "vi di
mame fleg zogn".) Excerpts from some of these broadcasts will be part of
a documentary being co-produced by Living Traditions and National Public
Radio called "The Stations That Spoke Your Language: Jewish-American
Radio 1925-1955" set to air in December of 1995.
