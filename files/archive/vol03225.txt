Subject: Jewish diseases

Those who would like to read more about the myth-making surrounding
'Jewish diseases' such as diabetes should look at my The Case of
Sigmund Freud (Hopkins, 1993).

Subject: Yerushalayim shel Zahav

I can only conclude that this is a Zionist message, transmitted with
some literary anachronism.  Since the song wasn't written until
1967, perhaps the implication is that the dream of finding a land
wasn't really fulfilled until then.  Do you think this  was intended
by Spielberg?

I have had in my possession for some 55 years a 4 volume Di Yudishe
[sic] Folks-Geshikhte by Ben-Zvi which claims to be "nohkh der
Folkstimlikher Geshikhte der Yuden fun H. Gretz" and to be
"ferbessert" and brought up to date. There's no date of publication
I can find and the history seems to end at 1900. The publisher is
Hebrew Publishing Company on Canal Street in New York. (The English
words in the publisher's name are spelled in Hebrew characters using
Yiddish orthography.)

The relevance is that ALL vowels are shown explicitly in the text.
However not under the Yiddish carrier of the vowel, but instead
under the preceding consonant. Thus "Ven" is spelled with the three
dots under the pair of vuvs followed by the ayen-nun. In particular
this convention is followed for pairs of yuden, the vowel sign being
either the two dots or the horizontal line. (I've never learned the
correct names for these.)

Subject: Kleynkunst, shund

On how to translate "kamershpil" and "kleynkunst-teater," a question
first brought up by, I think, Shleyme Axelrod --

For the latter I would suggest (following Nahma Sandrow) "Yiddish
literary cabaret," a genre whose pioneer was Moyshe Broderzon in
Lodz in the 1920's, and whose history remains to be written
(although there are stirrings of interest in Poland by historians of
the Polish equivalent (prominent in which was the Jewish
joke-skit-shtik known as (linguists take note and help) "szmonces,"
i.e., shmontses...)). On the general European genre there's a good
book by Harold Segal.

A good English equivalent for "kamershpil" is tougher; I'll defer to
the bine-artistn, who, I hope, are out there somewhere...To entice
them, and any other mevinim of Yiddish theater out into sayber-rom,
I'll use this opportunity to ask derbay for help with descriptions
of pre-war shund teater, a subject very difficult to come by, since
what was there ever to "say" about it, in the old days, except that
"shund" was..."shund"?  Yet today if instead we say "Yiddish popular
theater," there could be a lot to say, but for the moment, tsum
badoyrn, mainly teoretish.  References to articles, reviews,
fiction, memoirs would be greatly appreciated, and above all, oyb

Subject:  Wetnurses and the old Russ litlang

The wetnurse story as I recall it from previous mendeles is
doubtless a bobbemaise.  There is no problem in explaining either
the pronunciation of the old aristocracy, with St Pete norms or Old
Moscow norms, or the post-1917 literary pronunciation, in terms of
territorial dialects and dialect develop- ment in Russian.  Vowel
reduction is found in the dialects of a large majority of Russian
speakers, and the secondary reduction found in the narrow band of
central dialects, includes the territory of Moscow.  Aristocrats and
rulers everywhere often speak more like peasants than like the urban
gentry, because they spend so much time in the country, doing
country things like hunting. Read Tolstoy or Turgenev and you will
see that they aristocracy didnt need wetnurses to come in contact
with provincial dialect speech.  Besides, children do NOT pick up
regional and social speech norms from the women who nurse them
(unless they are lucky enough to get nursed from 10 years on up),
but rather from the peer groups in which they are socialized AFTER
they leave that initial maternal nest...) Shalom,

Jules Levin
