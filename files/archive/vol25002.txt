Subject: brengen unter di hent

Assuming Martin Jacobs [25.001] is the victim of a typographical error (not uncommon in published Yiddish texts), the quoted sentence should have read "…di arbet hot bay zey GEBRENT under di hent." That is, the men worked so furiously that their work "burned beneath their hands." The phrase is quite common.

Subject: bavayzn zikh

The infinitive "bavayzn zikh" is defined in the new Comprehensive Yiddish-English Dictionary as "appear, show up." Martin Jacobs' quoted use [25.001] is in the past tense, "bavizn zikh." "zikh bavizn" would be a similar usage in the quoted context.

Barry Goldstein offers: "...The goyim then got quieter, 'showing themselves' [odd way of saying 'staying as they were'] without the noisy confusion..."

[Similar response received from Paula Teitelbaum.]

Subject: tsunoyfgenumen vi a nikl

"vi a nikl" [25.001] should be written in Standard Yiddish "vu a nikl" and it means: "he scraped up wherever (he could find) a nickle". In the shtetl it would have been: er hot tsunoyfgenumen vu a groshn.

Subject: "On the head of a thief"

Dear Mendelyaners,

A colleague asked me whether I knew the Yiddish translation and perhaps transliteration of the following, which his mother used to say: "On the head of a thief, the hat turns twice as fast."

Alas, I could not help him with either, but perhaps many of you who are more knowledgeable can. Although I’m far from clear as to its meaning,  It is quite an interesting expression.

A sheynem dank,

Date: May 21
Subject: toykhekhe

Many years ago I read the translation of a Yiddish short story about a man whose sole job in his shtetl was to take the aliyah in which the list of curses (the toykhekhe) is read.  Then the  man left town and the townspeople didn't know what to do.

My memory fails me and I have not been able to identify the name of the story or its author. Can anyone help?

Subject: af tselokhes

Joyce Tamara [25.001] asks about a Bikel recording. Here's a reference to it:

Subject: hooleila / kholere

[See 24.012 and 25.001]

My Litvish mom (from Dabeik) didn't swear much, but when she did, this was one she used a lot; she pronounced it "Kholeriya!" It was a very potent curse, especially for those who survived the epidemics of flu, typhus and cholera following WWI.
