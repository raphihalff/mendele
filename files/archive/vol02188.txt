Subject: various

Malke Winters, David Perlmutter has an article that is
right up the alley of your friend interested in
khsidimlekh (the morphology of the word, that is).
Punkt itst I can't find the paper.  Ellen, would you
please inform if you have it handy (since you were the
one to introduce me to it)?

Skirt is:  rok, spudnitse, (halbe) kleydl -- depending
on dialect.  _rok_ for ot other Yiddish speakers is a
coat/jacket (whence _rekl_ 'jacket').  Also shlofrok
'bathrobe'.

_lehavdl_ IS in fact of Turkish origin.  Perhaps I will
share the etymology at a a later date.

First, some bibliography:

  Bochner, Harry(84), "Inflection within Derivation",
The Linguistic Review, 3: 411-421.

  Perlmutter, David(88), "The Split Morphology
Hypothesis: Evidence from Yiddish", in _Theoretical
Morphology: Approaches in Modern Linguistics_, ed. by
M. Hammond & M. Noonan, pages 79-100. San Diego:
Academic Press.

(My old friend (and mentor) David Perlmutter and I draw
opposite theoretical conclusions, but we mostly agree
on the facts ;-)

There are brief discussions in:

  Birnbaum, S.(1922), _Das hebraishe un aramaische
Element in der jiddischen Sprache_, Gustav Engel,
Leipzig.

  Mark, Yudel(78), _Gramatik fun der Yidisher
Klal-Shprakh__, Congress for Jewish Culture, New York,
page 165.

  Spivak & Blumgarten(1911), _Yidish Verterbukh_,
Farlag Yehoyesh, New York, page xv.

and the facts are also referenced in:

  Stump, Gregory(91), "A Paradigm-Based Theory of
Morphosyntactic Mismatches", Language 67: 675-725.

Ok, now the facts in brief:

Words whose plurals are formed with -im regularly have
plural diminutives in -imlekh: khasanimlekh,
sforimlekh, khatoimlekh, khaveyrimlekh.  Note also:
poyerimlekh, naronimlekh (from germanic roots). The
only quirk is that this doesn't happen if the meaning
has shifted too far: e.g. khosidl can mean "Hassid
(dim.)", in which case the plural is khasidimlekh; but
it can also mean "a Hassidic dance", in which case the
plural is khosidlekh.

The corresponding thing happens, at least sometimes,
with Hebrew (or Aramaic?)  nouns ending in a consonant
that take the ending -es. nisyoyneslekh "temptations",
khesroyneslekh "defects". Spivak & Blumgarten say this
happens regularly, but the other discussions don't
mention it. I've encountered both oysyeslekh &
oysyelekh (sic!) as plural diminutives of os "letter".

Note that this doesn't happen with nouns that add -s to
a stem ending in -e: *menoyreslekh.

That's probably more than Malkah bargained for, so I
guess it's more than enough ;-)

The origin of the pattern is an interesting question;
I'd like to see anything that Carol Chapman writes up
on this.

Subject: Slippers

Some of the Yiddish terms for "slippers" have a Slavic
connection. Polish has _papucie_ (sing. _papuc'_) for a
kind of soft slipper, which apparently comes from
Turkish _papuch_ 'shoe'.  In Old Russian _papuchi_
referred to some kind of Turkish footwear. There's also
a dialectal Russian form _babusha_ for a kind of
slipper, said to be borrowed from German _Babuschen_ or
from French _babouche_, which comes from Arabic
_babush_, which may or may not be related to the
Turkish word.

_Podeszwa_ is Polish for 'sole' (of a shoe or a
foot)--from the prefix meaning 'under' and the root of
the verb 'sew'.  The same elements are in the Ukrainian
word _pidshivka_ 'thread used by shoemakers to sew
soles'--which Harkavy suggests as the source for the
Yiddish expression  _mit ale pitshevkes_ 'with all the
details'.

Subject: Yud-Yud

Arnold Kuzmack writes in a reply:

I think  that Arnold  is correct,  I am not  aware of
any ban  on any yud-yud, also not in Hebrew.  One
example may be enough. yayin, wine, is spelled  yud yud
nun.   Some other  combinations are banned  by the very
Orthodox like yud  heh (also not always, I think  it
*is* used in words like  Yehudi, only at  the end of
the  word some drop  the heh). Also yud  vav is
verboten by  some.  In using  the letters  for their
numerical values, it  is well known that  15 and 16 are
*not* yud heh and yud vav, but tet vav and tet zayin
respectively.
