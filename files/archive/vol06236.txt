Re: Joachim Neugroschel's post (6.234):

nisht Kalinograd.

Munich in Italian is "Monaco di Bavaria" [not "di Germania"].

Czernowitz (german) was pronounced phonetically "Chernevits or
Chernovits" in Yiddish.  The Romanian name Cernauti (with a hat on top
of the a, and a cedilla under the t) reminds me of the black years of
Romanian antisemitism, ghetto and deportation; it lasted only from
1919-1940 (and 1942-1944).

An importand suburb was "Sadegere" (Sadagura, or Sadagora), known for
its "rebbe" and from Celan's "Gauner und Ganovenweise" (which Joachim
probably translated into english). Other names that come to mind:
Keshenev = Chisinau, Kishinev (the capital of Moldova), Odes=Odesa,
Balshvets= Bolszowce (my father's bithplace in Galicia), etc.

And Kant's Koenigsberg is Kaliningrad (if it still has that name,
after Kalinin, president of the Supreme Soviet during the Stalin era)
not Kalinograd.

In 6.234 Joachim Neugroschel gave  a fascinating account about the way
place names were  used in Yiddish and much other  related material.  I
have just a couple of minor comments.  He wrote:

   While Yiddish and Ladino use the Hebrew forms for Israeli cities, e.g.
   Yerushalayim, the latter has been truncated to Salem in America. just
   as well: or would you rather talk about the witches of Jerusalem?

There is no need  for that  as the Khumesh in  Breshis (Genesis) 14,18
speaks about  Malki-Tzedeq the king of  Shalem.  Now, as so  often the
Hebrew letter "shin"  becomes "S" in Latin  transliterations.  Are all
goyim Litvaks? I  am aware that there are midrashim  which equate that
Shalem (Salem) with Yerushalayim (Jerusalem) and they even tell us who
Malki-Tzedeq *really* was.   Anyhow if there was a  "truncation" it is
an ancient one.

   Yiddish often uses some form of the German name for a Slavic place:
   e.g. "Varshe" (from German "Warschau" as opposed to Polish
   "WarszAwa".

Well, in  Israeli Hebrew we  use Varsha, OTOH  we use Moskva  which is
closer to  the Russian than the  German or English name.   Like almost
all but the French we call  their capital Paris, pronouncing the final
"s".   For American  cities almost  all Israelis  use a  pronunciation
close to that  of the Americans, thus the capital  is called something
like voshington.  Only the great Abba Eban is "consistent" and when he
      =
speaks Hebrew he calls it vashington.  But he is a purist.
                           =

Gut Shabbes,

Subject: Place names

In response to my recent listing on place names, several subscribers
have emailed me about "Vilnius" for "Vilne" etc.

"Vilnius" is the Lithuanian term, "Wilno" the Polish and sometimes
German name.  Wilne (from Polish) is the normal Yiddish term.
However, in Soviet Yiddish publications, writers had to use "Vilnius"
rather than "Wilne" to emphasize the myth that this was a Lithuanian
rather than a Polish or Jewish city.  I say "myth" because whatever
language was spoken there it was until very recently a Soviet city
politically--and historically a multicultural/multilingual city.

Etruscans and American Indians have a great advantage over Jews.
Although the Romans pretty much genocided the Etruscans, they
nevertheless kept many Etruscan place names in Italy--just as the
Germans have kept Slavic place names in Germany (including "Berlin",
"Luebeck" etc.) even though they finished off most of the Wends during
the Fascist Era.. And although white Europeans ravaged Indian culture
and population, Americans have nevertheless retained huge numbers of
Indian place names--including my very own Manhattan. However, none of
the nations that have killed off Jews have kept any Jewish place
names, and certainly no Yiddish ones.

Lots of American place names come from the Jewish Bible:  Goshen,
Salem, Eden....  I propose that we try to introduce a few Yiddish
names:  e.g. "Vilneburg" instead of Williamsburg.  According to The
New York Times, there will be only 30,000 Jews left in the United
States by the Tricentennial.  So perhaps a few Yiddish place names
will give America something to remember them by.

A small addendum about the Polish pronunciation of Lodz. Until World
War II, the dark "l" in Polish was pronounced either like the dark
Russian "l" or like English "w" depending on the area.  In fact the
"w" pronunciation even affected certain Yiddish dialects, which say
"weyenen" instead of "leyenen" etc. At the end of World War II, the
Soviet Union annexed the Eastern third of Poland, which pronounced the
dark "l" as in Russian.  The Polish population was forced westward,
partly into annexed German areas that now became Polish, including
Gdansk/Danzig.  So the dark "l" lost out to the "w" pronunciation, and
Lodz is now pronounced exclusively "woodzh" in Polish.  Ironically,
the "l" in the Yiddish pronunciation memorializes the dark Polish "l".
So, oddly enough, in this case it's Yiddish that preserves the Polish
past.
