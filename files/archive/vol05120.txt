Subject: IFshteyn AF der nakht

I can confirm Noyekh's Ukrainian Yiddish pronunciation of what the
standardized spelling represents as the preposition "oyf" (on) as AF and
the verbal prefix "oyf" ([stand/get] up) as IF.  My family's Yiddish
stems from Kiev and Dymer (Kiev District).  I also say "AFn pripetshik,"
"AF a shpatsir," etc. but "IFshteyn-IFgeshtanen" (not "geshtOnen," since
I don't speak "tOte-mOme loshn"), IFefenen-IFgeefnt, and so on.

As I understand it, in Litvish it's AF-UF (UFshteyn AF der nakht), in
Poylish it's OF-OF (or is that OUF-OF?): "OFshtayn OF deyr nakht", and in
our Ukrainer Mameloshn-Vi-Se-Badarf-Tsu-Zayn ;) it's "IFshteyn AF de(y)r
nakht".

(Dem emes gezogt, it seems like a big chunk of the Ukraine also says "OF"
for both.  For instance, the Barry Sisters [who I find very precise and
consistent in their accent] sing "Vus ken veynen in nit OFhern?" and "OF
a gasnbank".)

In writing transliteration, I write "AF-UF".  This way, speakers of
Litvish (Lithuanian & Byelorussian Yiddish, for the uninitiated) have it
all in front of them, and Noyekh's and my rusishe landslayt and students
trying to learn the Southern accent can follow the rule "a 'U' is
pronounced 'I' unless told otherwise".

By the way, OYF-OYF in speech marks a person as bookish or worse (even
Uriel Weinreich recommended AF-UF or AF-UF in "College Yiddish" and his
brother Gavriel pronounced AF-UF like a bona fide Litvak at the Max
Weinreich conference last winter).  I would propose to my fellow
Mendelyaner that we follow the AF-UF model in transliteration (I would
also argue for BA instead of BAY and a few other compromises with the
orthography, but _dos iz shen [sic] an ander mayse_).

Dear friends,

For some months I have been preparing a vocabulary list of chemistry
terms in Yiddish. I am a chemist and know a little Yiddish; now I am a
postdoctoral fellow in physical chemistry at Rutgers University. I have
based the list on Yiddish words found in Weinreich, and also have drawn
on two Yiddish books: "Chemistry: To Read and to Learn" by Sol Feinstone
(Workmen's Circle, New York, 1920), and Chemistry" by Sh. Brokhes
(Central People's Publisher of the USSR, Moscow, 1931).

I have also received much help from Leybl Botwinik, a computer scientist
and Yiddish writer. He did study chemistry and physics a while ago. But
this is not enough. I have put together a list of 2000(?) words. Some
words have several possible translations, and it is hard to decide which
is best. For some words we have no answer at all.

We hope that among our mendele-friends there are Yiddish speakers and
Yiddish-understanding scientists (engineers, chemists, physicists, etc.)
who can help with this important task. Please contact me, giving details
about your knowledge and how you can help.

Here [above] are some examples (W = Weinreich, B = Brokhes, F =
Feinstone; L = Leybl, * = my choice):

[see above]

A sheynem dank/ Many thanks,

Shloyme-Khaim Cohen
