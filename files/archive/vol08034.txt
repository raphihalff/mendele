Subject: yekum-purk(o)n-zup

In Mendele 08.031, Lucas Bruyn wrote about yekum-purk(o)n.

The only problems with his interpretation are that (1) the prayer
"yekum-purkn" is in Aramaic, not Hebrew, and (2) "yekum" in this context is
an imperative singular verb, not a noun.  In fact, "yekum-purkn" is "yequm
purqan" in Aramaic, and means "Let the redemption/salvation come...."  As
regards the meaning in Yiddish, I'm not sure, but I suspect that whatever the
meaning, it derives from the fact that these paragraphs are an expression of
good wishes for a long list of those who labor in all possible ways for the
welfare of the community.  Perhaps "mishmash" isn't such a bad translation
after all. 

Later in the same issue of Mendele, Lucas Bruyn wrote:  "Even if someone
knows the answer to a particular question, he might have to check
dictionaries or biographies or spent much time finding back a place in
literature where he last saw a word or expression."

In general I concur, although a dictionary is only as good as the person
using it - see above.  A large part of finding answers is knowing where to
look; in this case, a decent translation in a sidur would have been more
reliable.

Subject: y'kum purkon

The two y'kum purkon prayers were composed in the Babylonian exile in the 3rd
Century CE and are in the Judaeo-Aramaic language used by our forefathers.
Several other important prayers (e.g., kaddish) are also in this language.
The word y'kum in Aramaic corresponds to yakum in Hebrew (i.e., third person
singular, "future" tense, root qof vav mem).  Coincidentally, the Hebrew NOUN
"y'kum" (derived from the same root)  refers to "all that exists = the
universe". The word "purkon" indeed refers to salvation, etc. In the prayers
in question, y'kum purkon means literally "may salvation arise" or more
freely and correctly "may salvation be granted". The importance of these
prayers is attested by the use of Aramaic to assure that all would understand
and by their central position in the Shabbat service right after the reading
of the Tora and Haftara, while the Tora scroll is out, at a time when even
the latest of latecomers would be in attendance. (Note the similarity to the
positioning of shofar blowing or recitation of Yizkor in modern times.) 

Now for the soup. Two speculations by a crass amateur: 1. The strange sound
of the words in a strange language brings to mind a mishmash. 2.  The text of
the prayer is a long list of blessings "hina v'hisda v'rahame v'haye-arikhe
umzone-r'vihe v'si'ata-dishmaya uvaryut-gufa unhora-ma'alya zar'a haya
v'kayama ...." suggestive of a long list of ingredients.

Subject: nyunya

Just a word from Russian prospective. In Russian "nyunya" means a person who
used to belly-ache. This is a sniveller and sometimes a cry-baby, and nothing
else. There is also a verb "nyunit'" (and "nyunit'sia,"  "raznyunit'sia") --
it's clear that they have nothing in common with "nose"  or/and "nyukh" (as
'scent'). 

Best,

Subject: a lidele 

Please help with this song - sung by my mother, who was from Hungarian
borderlands. 

Shrayb mir on a brivele,
Shtel es af der post
Ti zhe dikh dermanen vi di host mir gelost
Hostu mikh gelost afn yam shvimen
Hostu nokh a kler amol tsu mir tsi kimen
Ven di zolst visn vizoy es tit mir layt
Volsti gekimen fin say vi vayt.

This is a fragment of a song that my mother used to sing and I would like to
find out more about it, if anyone else knows it, or where it came from, the
rest of it.  There is a theme of letters in Yiddish culture, apparently
because families were torn apart before the days of cell phones.

Subject: zyavet

Mendy Fliegler asks for the meaning of 'zyavet' [08.031]. My Polish
dictionary gives: 'zjawa' - fantom, apparition and'zjawic sie' (plus some
diacritic marks) - appear. So it would appear that his understanding of the
word was correct.  Again, in general, a Polish-English dictionary is a handy
item!

Subject: a finstern sawf

Mel Poretz's father was certainly a feisty and fascinating person. In the
spirit of"gib ehm a finstern sawf" my contribution is a phrase that has
appeared recently in Mendele -- Ehr zoll hoben a missa mshine. He should
suffer a strange (or ugly) death.

Mel Poretz raises a real question and issue when he asks,"Did he merely want
me to tell them off, but good? Where did upbraiding end and violence begin?"
Verbal hostility is part of Jewish culture. In too many countries it was the
only hostility Jews would allow themselves to express. Among Jews when
discussion and differences of opinion verged on violence vox populi would
admonish -- nisht mit di hent! -- Hands off! Verbal hostility is a great
outlet One of the literary gems of Yiddish are the clever, sharp and often
very earthy curses Things have gotten out of hand, not just among Jews but
everywhere. Verbal violence has been upstaged by physical violence

On the Lower East Side of New York we witnessed what could have become a
civil war among Jews.In a free and generally open society Eastern European
Jews take their ideologies seriously. The Bund permeated by a secular non, if
not anti-religious reading of Jewish literary sources (Bible,Talmud and
Midrash) seeks to dissamenate a humanist non-religious view of Judaism.to the
unenlightened believing religious Jews Unfortunately for all sides the debate
becomes vituperative and never a free exchange of ideas. The secularists
which according to the Orthodox include Reform and Conservative religious
Jews are both an abomination and a dire threat to Torah true Judaism.. To the
secularists the Orthodox are an anacronism and a source for religious
coercion.Then there began a relatively brief but unfortunate confrontation..
Mel Poretz describes his father "... riding shotgun over the Yom Kippur
outdoor feasts on the Lower East Side, acting as doorman/sergeant-at-arms for
the various balls sponsored by the Bund..."(My father told me about Yom
Kippur Balls scheduled in dance halls near synagogues about to begin the Kol
Nidre service.To many Jews this was an unnecessary and divisive provocation) 

In the '30s and '40s when I attended cheder, talmud Torah and Hebrew high
school Yom Kippur balls were a thing of the past..There was a lively debate
among all Jewish groups committed to Jewish survival ( Not like today the
issue was What is A Jew?and not Who is A Jew?) And education was the answer
and the solution

The Arbeiterring, Farband and Sholem Aleichem Shules presented the Jewish
public opportunities for an elementary and high school Yiddish and Jewish
education The teachers like their counterparts in the Hebrew schools were
dedicated educators. 
 
And there were Jewish education maximalists who were Orthodox. They believed
that ten hours a week of after noon Hebrew schools following five hours of
public school education was not enough time to pass on the religious
intellectual sources of Judaism and in general like American Roman Catholics
were for parochial school education in an Orthodox milieu.Then began a mass
movement for yeshivos ketanos (Jewish day schools) to prepare future students
for mesivtos (high school level yeshivos) and the classical yeshiva. 

The late '30s, '40s and '50s was an exciting period in American Jewish life.
There was a healthy competition between different approaches to Jewish
living. A Jewish elementary education was available for every Jewish child at
a nominal cost. (In recent decades the cost of Jewish education in day
schools and yeshivot ketanot is forbidding to families with modest incomes) 

What's in a name? In the '30s and '40s to the average American Jew the Bund
was the German American Bund. an American organization openly identified with
the Nazis with its main headquarters in the Yorkville section of New York
City.In response to the German American Bund activities and anti-Semitic
rallies an informal alliance of Jewish War Veterans and stam Jews violated
the Bund's democratic right to public assembly and broke up many Bund
rallies. I would not be surprized if despite his age Mel Poretz's father
broke up a few Bund rallies. and "hat zey gegeben a finstern sawf"  For this
"kimt ihm a harzigen yasher koach" (He deserves hearty conratulations! More
power to him!) 

Whenever I get the feeling that S'iz shver tzu zein a Yid it is tough to be a
Jew with so many definitions and approaches to being Jewish I am reminded of
the line from a popular folk song "Vass mir zenen zenen mir, ober Yiden zenen
mir" -- What we are ,we are, but, never the less, we are Jews!

Un affileh shabbes, akert er die erd.
S'geht arohp a regn, vehren felder grin

My second question is re the expression "lachen mit yashtsherkes", "laughing
with lizards".  I know that it translates as "grin and bear it" ... but where
does it come from"?
