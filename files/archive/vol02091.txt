Subject: Noble's translation of Weinreich's Geshikhte

In response to an inquiry, Zachary Baker of YIVO (a dank
aykh, R'Moyshe-Zekharye) informs me that the Shlomo Noble
translation (U. of Chi., 1980) of Max Weinreich's *History
of the Yiddish Language* is out of print, though
preparations are being made for a new edition to be
published by Yale U.P. in a year or more.  Does anyone on
MENDELE know of a copy for sale of the 1980 edition?  With
thanks,

Seymour (Shleyme) Axelrod

Subject: anywhere

        Ellen Prince asks:
        "could those of you who have native fluency in Yiddish
        please tell me how you would translate the following
        sentences into Yiddish? if you can think of more than
        one translation, please give them all. thanks a mil-
        lion!

        1. You can go anywhere.

        2. If you go anywhere without me, I'll be lost.

        3. Did you see him anywhere?

        4. She didn't find him here, so she will look some-
        where in
        the South."

        I'm not quite a native speaker, but I'll take a crack
        at it nevertheless:

        1. Du kenst geyn vu du vilst.

        2. Oyb du'st geyn ergetzvu on mir, vel ikh zayn far-
        faln. (I'm not quite sure what to do with 'be lost').

        3. Tsi hostu im (ergetz)vu gezen?

        4. Zi hot im do nit gefunen, vet zi im zukhn ergetzvu
        in die dorem kantn.  (I can't think of an idiomatic
        non-periphrastic Yiddish equivalent for 'the South').

Subject: Anywhere

This is a tricky one, Ellen. Number 1 more than the others?
(Why?). Here are a few suggestions:
 
1. You can go anywhere (presumably meaning "wherever you
like" or "everywhere")

Vu du vilst (nor) kenstu geyn
Kenst geyn vu du zolst nor nit veln
Kenst geyn umetum/iberal
 
2. If you go anywhere without me, I'll be lost.

Ven du zolst ergetsvu geyn on mir, bin ikh a farlo(y)rener
 
3. Did you see him anywhere?

Host(u) im ergetsvu gezen?
Host(u) im vu es iz gezen?
Host(u) im vu nit iz gezen?
Host(u) im vu s'nit iz gezen?
 
4. She didn't find him here, so she will look somewhere in
the South.

Zi hot im do nit gefunen, vet zi im zukhn ergetsvu in
dorem/vu nit iz in dorem
 
Please send me an offprint.

Subject: It was the Jews that elected Clinton

(this one works better orally)

"You know, it was the Jews that got Clinton elected."
"Yeah?  How so?"
"It says it right here in the paper: 'Clinton elected by
landsleit'."
