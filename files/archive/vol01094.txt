Subject: binde

In our family, as learned from Simone's parents (who
originate from Stashiv, Poland, and came to Toronto after
the war), we use "binde" for a necktie.  The origin appears
to me to be a mistranslation of "tie", much as "gleikhn"
has come into general North American usage for the verb "to
like".

I don't find "binde" in the dictionary.  Is it simply a
personal or local mistranslation, or have others heard it
as well?  (If it's as widely used as gleikhn, I'm happy to
continue using it, regardless of what the purists may
say:-)

Subject: autumn colors

I wonder whether there are any words in Yiddish that have
been used idiomati- cally to refer to the changes in color
of the autumnal season.  My Bubbeh used to speak of
oysgetrikineh blatter -- but that doesn't exactly describe
colors. Isaac Babel says somewhere that when he was
beginning to write a Russian liter- ary maven told him it
was vital to describe nature.  He didn't do that much, in
fact hardly at all, but he sure described people!  My old
Tante, in a visit to us, remarked on how much my wife and I
liked to look at and be in, as she put it, scenery.  Parks
and grass are nice, she said, but she enhjoyed looking at
people more.  She was born in the town of Sokolofke in the
Ukraine (Kievska gib erni) -- a rustic village filled with
"scenery" -- and came to the US when she was a teen ager.
So maybe it's time for us urban remnants to make up
"scenery" words where none may exist.

Subject: Bostoner Yiddish

I've known Boston, in a Leacockian sense, for a long time.
In 1946 I heard a young woman in Brookline ask for a
tchayl. And left town before I might hear worse.  Now I
visit again and discover that the bakers make bagels with
"sissel".  Vos iz sissel?  Veyst men nisht.  Someone shows
me.  Caraway.

Follows a fruitless hour with dictionaries.  

Would someone be good enough to straighten out this matter?
And, since there's a strong likelihood that Mendele will
move there one of these days, are there any other
soul-shattering experiences that one should be ready for?
