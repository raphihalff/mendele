Subject: Bet hemden

[See Joy Kingsolver's query (6.210-211)].

As in the Hebrew root kh-m-d delight, as in (at least sometimes) sexual
delight? as in the word Sarah used in asking Will I at my age know
hemdah with my husband? would it mean brothel, then?

Subject: Finding copies of the Forward

Thanks to everyone who responded to my "how do I find something in an
old Forward" query. Several of you requested a summary of the replies.

                                  * * *

      Brandeis....has the Forvrerts on microfilm.  I suggest you contact
      the Judaica librarian at whatever university is closest to you.

                                  * * *

      A long time ago...I ordered paper copies of the Forverts through
      InterLibrary Loan. I believe we got them from Hebrew Union College
      in Cincinnati. You can also ask YIVO if they send copies out
      through ILL.

                                  * * *

      I do know that there are copies of the Forverts on microfilm. Of
      course, the more specific your date of the letter the more likely
      you are to get someone to help you look/copy. Write to both places
      and ask if they can help you.

                                  * * *

      I ordered the Forwards' micofilm (from the 1920s) on the
      interlibrary loan system and it worked well.

                                  * * *

      My city's public library was able to borrow microfilms of the
      Forverts for me through a standard inter-library loan.  I had to
      specify the issues I wanted; I can't remember the numbers now, but
      I requested everything from a six- or even twelve-month period in
      the late 20s.  The microfilm they received (maybe six or eight
      weeks after my request) was from Hebrew Union College, Cincinatti,
      but there are other copies in other collections, and which one
      your library gets depends on which institution is contacted and
      agrees to lend it...I have also viewed Forverts microfilms at the
      Los Angeles campus of HUC.  Depending on where you are living, you
      may be able to find copies in an institution near you.  A good
      research library ought to be able to tell you who has some.


Again, thanks.

Subject: YIVO, Yizkor books, and English translations of Yizkor books

My thanks to the people who responded to my questions about YIVO and
Yizkor books (specifically, Ostrog) and possible English translations
thereof. Several of you wanted me to post the results.

                                  * * *

YIVO's web site: http://spanky.osc.cuny.edu/~rich/yivo/index.html

                                  * * *

Try a library that has them on microfilm.  Brandeis and Harvard in Boston.
YIVO and Columbia and other in NYC.  UCLA maybe.

                                  * * *

YIVO does not yet have an on-line catalogue, but you can contact the head
librarian, Zachary Baker (agev a mendelyaner) at <yivo1@metgate.metro.org>.

                                  * * *

I don't know about _Ostrog_, but Widener Library does have Grines' _Ven dos
lebn hot geblit_, which seems to be about Ostrog. [SK: It is.]

                                  * * *

Try to get into the databases WorldCat or OCLC (the latter may be only
in Ohio universities however). WorldCat will give you answers to any
nummber of queries, not only books. Look up (under word, not title) the
name of the shtetl/shtot or the title of the yizkher bukh. That catalog
will not only be able to tell you if it has been translated, but under the
command LIB it will tell you who has a copy and who is willing to lend it
out!

Again, thanks.
