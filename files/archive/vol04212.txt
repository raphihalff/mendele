Subject: Nishdogedakht; Chicago Yiddish Resources

Regarding Mikhl Herzog's remark on "Nitogedakht"--this may be the
standard pronounciation, but my mother and her family (from Ukraine)
always said "nishdogedakht", with a clearly voiced "d", supporting the
"do" connection. This was a word I heard *very* frequently, punctuating a
constant litany of tragic events, or so it seemed.

Hate to tshepe people again, but I never got an answer to my question
about Chicago YIVO.  Surely someone is out there who knows if there is a
YIVO organization there (nothing in phone book), and if they (or anywhere
else in the area) has holdings of YIVO Bleter and other publications that
I could consult.  Zayt azoy gut Mendele-layt, un shikt mir an entfer.

Subject: nit do gedakht

mikhl, i definitely vote for dovid's _do_ instead of _op_ since, in my
(cy) family, /nishtugedakht/ was in complementary distribution with
_nisht bay mir/dir/aykh gedakht_ and never *_nisht bay mir/...
opgedakht_. btw, my father, who was a diamond cutter with the soul of a
linguist, insisted that _nebekh_ was an acronym of _nisht bay aykh
gedakht_. yeah, i know, it's from polish. but i like his story better.
:-)

re rogelekh, i never thought i'd be giving anyone baking lessons :), but
the dough wasn't 'bent' into triangles--it was rolled into a flat circle
(the word _volgerholts_ or something like that just woke up in my mental
lexicon after a 40-yr nap!) and cut into sections, like a pizza,
whereupon poof!, instant triangles! each one was then rolled into a
crescent. proto-croissants...

Subject: "sheygets"

J. Rosof:

Contrary to the morphological spelling principle which prevails in the
case of Yiddish words of German origin (and the phonetic principle in the
case of Slavic-origin words), the etymological principle prevails with
respect to Yiddish words of Hebrew and Aramaic origin.

There are exceptions: some words, like "mekn" 'to erase', girls' names
"Rive", "Sime", may lose lose their Hebrew identity (usually for
explainable reasons, in these cases because of the fate of the old "khes"
sound), and are consequently spelled "phonetically"; other words may be
reinterpreted as being of Hebrew origin and are then given "Hebreoid"
spellings: men's names "Zalmen" and "Kalmen", "khoyzek" 'mockery'.

I know of _no_ instance in which Yiddish retains the Hebrew-like spelling
implied by the absence of vowel letters, while "presuming" to alter the
traditional spelling of the Hebrew consonants. Do you?

If, as you claim with such certainty and, to be fair to you, our
dictionaries imply, Yiddish "sheygets" (shin-giml-tsadik) is derived from
Hebrew "shekets" (shin-kuf-tsadik), you might feel obliged to explain the
spelling deviation.

You could also strengthen your argument if you could adduce any other
instance in which an intervocalic [-k-] in the source language yields
Yiddish [-g-]? In other words, do you know any other case in which
Yiddish [-g-] corresponds to (German, Slavic, Hebrew) [-k-]? Is the
change _lautgezaetslich_?

As you may gather, I'm not happy with the standard theory. I have nothing
to substitute for it, but I'm prepared to say "I don't know".

Subject: Re: Sheygets

There have  been several contributions  about the  development  of the
use of sheygets and shiktse in various forms of spelling.  While it is
clear that  these words are in  some way derived from  the Hebrew word
sheqetz, the  use of these Yiddish  words for male or  female (young?)
gentiles is AFAIK  absent from older Hebrew sources.   These words are to
some  extend used in  modern Hebrew, but it  seems to me  that this usage
stems from Yiddish.  Some kind of ping pong linguistic.

Subject: A Necessary but not Sufficient Condition

To Ellen Prince:

Commenting on my posting "An Interesting Dispute" (4.207,5), you ask:

"Who should be the experts [about Yiddish] if not native speakers?"

Being a native speaker is a necessary but not a _sufficient_ condition.

This is exactly why I put "certification" in quotation marks, since some
native speakers issue _themselves_ "Diplomas" as "experts" in Yiddish.

My very example of the described "dispute" abundantly illustrates this
point.

Subject: New Yiddish Childrens Book

Melbourne schoolgirl Rebecca White, 14 is the author of a new children's
book in Yiddish "Dancing Dinosaurs" released last week in time for
Chanukah. The book tells of a little girl, Malkele, who can't get to
sleep because she imagines dinosaurs are coming out of her doll box.
Malkele's fears are overcome when her father promises he will eat up any
dinosaurs he finds in her bedroom - with horseradish !

The 20 page book is illustrated by Dinah Butt. Dancing Dinosaurs is the
fifth publication from Koala Farlag, a non-profit group established eight
years ago out of concern at the paucity of new reading material in
Yiddish for young children. The book can be ordered from the Workmens
Circle bookshop in New York.

PS Does anyone out there have a Yiddish translation of Maoz Tzur?
