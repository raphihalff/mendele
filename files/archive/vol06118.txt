Subject: Rochl Boymvol

It's a charming little book ("Antkegen Dem Vos Eer Zogt") of nearly
seventy pages in small format, arranged in short essay form. There are
some inaccuracies in Hebraic terms. It can be acquired directly from the
author.

I suggest you send $10 dollars which should cover mailing costs as well.
The address is:

29 Costa Rica Street, Jerusalem Israel

I recommend highly her poetry collections as well.

Her husband Zyama Telesin who recently passed away was a poet in his own
right. His books are available at J.L.Peretz Farlag, I4 Brenner St, Tel Aviv.

Subject: Beregovski archive

According to information released by Norman Ross, the sheet music that
is available through his publishing firm was collected during the 1920s
and 1930s by the ill-fated Institute for Jewish Proletarian Culture, in
Kiev, and in 1936 was transferred to its similarly unfortunate
successor, the Office of Jewish Culture.  After the Office of Jewish
Culture was closed by Soviet authorities its collections eventually
devolved to the library of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian
S.S.R.  -- now known as the V. I.  Vernadsky Central Scientific Library
-- in Kiev.  Circa 1991 the Vernadsky Library established a Jewish
section, which now includes books, newspapers and the Jewish music
collections -- published, manuscript, recorded -- that are the legacy of
the former Institute and Office, as well as materials acquired at a
later date.

The An-ski and Beregovski collections are also housed in the Jewish
section of the Vernadsky Library.  The An-ski materials presumably were
part of the Institute for Jewish Proletarian Culture's collections; the
Beregovski collection would have been a later acquisition.  It is
conceivable that some of the sheet music released by Norman Ross
belonged to the Beregovski collection.

Subject: Saying "please" in Yiddish

Regarding the concept of "please" in Yiddish:  it's wrong to say that
"zay azoy gut" can't be used with notions like "give me," "I want,"
etc.:

zayt azoy gut, ikh darf mit aykh redn
zayt azoy gut, git mir dokh a glezl vaser.
zayt azoy gut, ikh vil arumredn a viktikn inyen.....
etc.

"zayt azoy gut" is merely a formulaic idiom, and in these and many other
instances it can be readily replaced by :  "tut mir a toyve" or "ikh bet
aykh."  All these idioms can easily be found in ordinary yiddish
conversation as well as throughout yiddish literature.  but, of course,
if someone finds such formulas too difficult, then they should please
use please--zayt azoy gut und zogt "pliz"....  and how about
"tank-salat" instead of "a dank"? in fact, why bother using yiddish at
all?

Subject: Inyonay khanike

David Herskovic in Vol 6-117 asks for the origin of the name "hanukkiyah" for
the menorah of hanukkah.

This is relatively a new word (20th century) and I read about it in, I
believe, "Leshonenu La'Am". It was coined by Devorah Ben-Yehudah, the
wife of Eliezer Ben-Yehudah, who used it to describe the menorah.
Eliezer did not like it and accordingly did not include it in his Hebrew
dictionary. The haredim in Jerusalem did not like it because it came
from the circles of Ben-Yehudah, who was under herem of the haredim of
Jerusalem. Accordingly most haredim, even today, use the term "menorah",
but are unaware of the history behind their use. The Jewish people liked
the term and use hanukkiyah extensivley.

Subject: Inyonay khanike

The Hebrew word was coined to distinguish the 9-candle chanukah menorah
from the 7-candle menorah of the Temple.

A minor point: "menorah" means "lamp, candelabrum" and not "lantern,"
which is "panas" in Hebrew; the latter is also used for "flashlight."

The difference between likht and lekht is one of dialect the word is
invariable in singular and plural. Olsvanger has a story on this but I
can't find it at the moment.
