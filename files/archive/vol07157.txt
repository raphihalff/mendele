Subject: Americanisms in Yiddish

In a recent issue of Mendele [07.151], David Justman writes,

"One frequently sees in Mendele attacks on anglicisms and americanisms in
Yiddish.  All languages, as far as I know, take from other languages, and
considering the history of the Jews, it is easy to understand why Yiddish has
taken more than most.  Why are Americanisms caused by let's say, 20th century
migrations to America somehow worse than slavicisms caused by late medieval
migrations to Eastern Europe?" 

This reminded me of a passage in Benjamin Harshav's _The Meaning of Yiddish_:

A notorious case was VINDE, adopted in America from the English "window"
instead of the German-stock FENTSTER.  VINDE became a symbol of barbarism to
the purists but there is no objective reason why the European Yiddish VINDE
for "lift" (which came to Yiddish from Russian) should be more legitimate than
its homonym derived from the English "window."  By the twentieth century,
however, Yiddish was established in Europe as a dignified and prestigious
language, and the writers fought against its vulgarization in the American
Yiddish "yellow press."  In contrast, Abraham Cahan, the editor of the popular
_Forverts_ . . ., promoted this influx of Americanisms, absorbed into the
unifying Yiddish alphabet, as the language of the masses for whom he worked. 
In a profound sense, Cahan was not just an opportunist:  he understood the
open nature of the Yiddish language, as did his readers. . . . The purist
critics cannot be right because the whole conception of uncontaminated Yiddish
- and the sometimes whimsical norms imposed onit - are a very recent
development indeed and vary from one writer to another (65-66). 

Best, 
Larry Rosenwald

Subject: buflfish 

The Yiddish "buflfish" might be the equivalent of German "Bueffelfisch"  and
English "buffalo fish."

Subject: Buffalofish

I'm responding to Pinchos Melnick un zayn froy Khane regarding the English
equivalent of a fish called _bofl_ which was commonly chopped up by hand in
the preparation of _gefilte fish_.  I believe it is the buffalofish, a large
fish in the carp family.  It must always be eaten _mit a bisl khreyn_.  Which
brings to mind a parody of a song from "My Fair Lady" which goes thusly: THE
PAIN OF KHREYN IS MAINLY INHUMANE.

Interestingly, this word - manse - also belongs to the Russian underground
argot ("enchke-lushn"), in the se nse of "piste manses", though. Since it was
likely introduced in there in Odessa (as were most other Yiddish words), it is
pronounced in Russian as "mansa" (sing.) and "mansy" (pl.).  It was used once
quite extensively in the Russian criminal lore and son gs ("blatnaya pesnya",
see/listen to A.Rozenbaum, A. Severny, et al.), but has made its way into the
contemporary belles-lettres as well. See, for instance, Sergei Dovlatov - one
of the most prominent modern Russian authors: "Zona (Zapiski nadziratelya)"/
"The Prison Camp (Notes of a Warder)", written in early 1960s (Collection of
Prose in 3 Volumes, Limbus Press, St. Petersburg, 1995 - v.1, p.83).  The
idiom ( "Don't throw your manses around") is omitted in the English transla! 
tion. As a footnote: S.Dovlatov was born in Ufa, Bashkir Republik, and lived
in Leningrad when the book was being written, - to be sure of the word's
geography. Anshuldikt, az di transliteratsie yz ba mir tsi fonetish. Ikh bin

Subject: Spelling, pronunciation, dialects

As a linguist (and I won't apologize for being one!), I have to point out that
we take the spoken language to be the REAL language and the written language
(which after all only a minority of the world's languages have ever developed)
to be an interesting but strictly secondary development.  And above all, since
people normally learn to speak long before they learn to read or write, it
makes no sense whatever to ask why people do not speak the way the spelling
is. Rather the question must always be the reverse: why do so many languages
write words differently from the way they are spoken.  And the answer is
usually one and the same: spelling often reflects the way the language USED TO
BE pronounced.  The ayin in mayse is no different from the k- and the -gh- in
the English knight.  A long time mayse was pronouced with a real phonetic ayin
and no nasal, much as a long time ago English knight was pronounced "knikht".

That spoken language is NOT a reflection of the written but the other way
around and that most if not all oddities and irregularities of any language
(including but not restricted to those of the spelling) are almost always in
essence anachronisms, relics of the past, living dinosaurs, if you will, are
two of the basic discoveries of 19th cent linguistics.  But for some reason
unlike other basic scientific discoveries of that time, these are not normally
taught in our educational system (except in linguistics and anthro depts of
our universities)  and in fact what IS taught (if anything) is the EARLIER,
ahistorical and writing-oriented views that date back to the Greeks. 

The same applies to almost everything else to do with language.  The language
lore of our grammars and dictionaries and schools (again with the exception of
technical work by linguists and anthropologists) is hardly different from what
was taught by the Greeks.  The ideas of etymology which the general public is
exposed to and which I have been fighting here on Mendele, for example, are
exactly those found in Plato's dialogue Cratylus (as are the popular ideas of
how languages change and how they come to resemble each other).  Of course, in
physics and biology we no longer teach the theories of Plato's student
Aristotle, and I do not know how this connect between modern science and
popular knowledge occurred in the case of language, but I do regard it as the
duty of every linguist to do his/her best to fight the good fight to remedy
this situation. 

Yiddishists are probably as good an audience as we can hope for precisely
because Standrd Yiddish has such a tenuous hold (compared to that of most
standard European languages)  and because so many Yiddishists are so
unabashedly fond of their native dialects--and hence should be more receptive
than most other Westerners to the teachings of a science that gives dialects
their rightful place.

Subject: shayle

In Mendele Vol 07.155, Hugh Denman asks where Yehoyesh-Spivak's pointing of
shayle comes from. I cannot point to an attestation of the spelling with
pasekh and khatef-pasekh in a Loshn-Koydesh text, but a pointing with shwa
under the shin and komets under the alef is registered in Jastrow. This puts
the word in the same class as dayge, whose classical pointing is the same and
which similarly failed to end up in Yiddish as *doge or the like. raye also
should have wound up as *roye, but the yud hides the development of /ay/. 

In a reversal (if that's what it really is), what should have been *balebayes
shows up as balebos, while *taynes shows up as tones.

Subject: a shayle

Hugh Denman asks about the pointing of 'shayle' in the Hebrew text of
Yehoyesh.  I checked my CD-ROM of the Tanakh text for every occurrence of
shin-alef-lamed-heh and did not see the pointing that Hugh refers to (pasakh
under the shin and khataf-pasakh under the alef) at all. 

Where did this occur?  Is it only a typo, perhaps?

Subject: Sutzkever's "Di blayene platn fun roms drukeray"

The historicity of this poem is discussed in my book AGAINST THE APOCALYPSE:
RESPONSES TO CATASTROPHE IN MODERN JEWISH CULTURE (Harvard, 1984), pp. 251-52. 
For those who prefer to have everything at their fingertips: it never
happened.  My source is the late Abba Kovner who wrote to me on August 22,
1983 that in the Vilna ghetto one could scarcely find an oven in which to warm
up one's tsholnt, let alone a blast furnace in which to melt down lead for
bullets.  In my analysis of the poem, I argue that the truth of Sutzkever's
poem transcends its facticity.
