Subject: Bashevis' funeral

The following appeared in Shalom Rosenfeld's column in Ma'ariv of
August 9, 1991.


      According to a generous estimate [Bet Hillel] there were
200 people present at the memorial service in honor of the writer
Isaac Bashevis Singer in the funeral home in Manhattan.  A more
conservative report [Bet Shammai] counts only 150.

      It is not clear whether this funeral service was carried
out according to our religious practices or whether it was
improvised.  It is clear, however, that the usual eulogies
[hespedim] were not delivered.  Only two people spoke at the
ceremony - actually they related some stories and anecdotes
about Bashevis and others that he himself had told - Rabbi
William Berkowitz and the author's son, also an author and
journalist in his own right, Israel Zamir, of Kibbutz Bet
Alpha.  What was absent at the ceremony to honor one of the
great writers of Yiddish in our generation, a Nobel Laureate?
Yiddish was absent.

      And, had Rabbi Berkowitz not quoted a part of Bashevis'
famous speech in Stockholm in which the author defined the
language he created in as "a loshon fun galus, on a land un on
grenize" [a diaspora language, without a country and without
borders] - we might have been witnesses to an amusing episode in
the history of literature: a memorial service for an author in
which almost no word in the language he wrote in was spoken.
Following the funeral car to the cemetery in some God forsaken
place in New Jersey, following the coffin of of one of our most
famous authors, were about a dozen people of his family, in 3
[THREE!] cars.

      Such is New York.  The New York of millions of Jews,
among whom tens of thousands read his works in their original
language, over a period of decades, particularly on the pages of
the FORWARDS.

       I recall a sad meeting that I once had with the [Yiddish
- RW] poet Itzik Manger, who lived many years in the shadow of
death [he was an alcoholic - RW].

      He begged me to promise him that, if his luck turned bad
and he were to die in America, I would do everything to arrange
for his corpse to be brought to Israel for a Jewish burial here.
"If I die in New York," he said, "not even a dog would come to
my funeral."

      Itzik Manger died in Gadera.  His funeral was held in
Tel Aviv and many thousands followed his coffin.
