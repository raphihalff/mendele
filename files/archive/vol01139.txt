I am happy to learn that David Hirsch of UCLA personally
knew members of the Yiddish-speaking community of Cairo,
professional actors included. In an article entitled
"Yiddish Theater in Cairo" (to appear shortly in
:HP1.Bulletin of the Israeli Academic Center in Cairo:EHP1.
No 15 {1992}), I sketch the history and communal functions
of the Yidishe kunst fareyn, the amateur Yiddish theatrical
group which led a vigorous existence for four decades. It
is highly probable that, as early as the 1890s, Cairo (as
well as Alexandria and Port Said) was visited by wandering
troupes and individual artists from Eastern Europe and from
Palestine. A number of sporadic efforts preceded the
establishment of a stable amateur theater group in Cairo.
Thus a "Groupe d'Amateurs" staged Gordin's :HP1.Le
Sauvage:EHP1. {Der vilder mentsh} on 9 May 1909. :HP1.Der
yudisher literarisher un dramatisher tsirkl fun
kayro:ehp1., also widely known under its French name,
:HP1.Le cercle litteraire et dramatique du Caire:EHP1.
('The Jewish Literary and Dramatic Circle of Cairo') was
founded on 3 September 1912 (in 1919 it was located at Rue
Hassan el-Akbar N.1). It later changed its name to
:HP1.Yidishe kunst fareyn:EHP1., but was widely known in
Cairo under its French name, Groupement Artistique Juif de
Caire. Although I believe there was Yiddish theatrical
activity in Egypt prior to 1909 -- mainly wandering troupes
from Russia -- I lack proof. I am not aware of any
"Keniglikher yidisher teater" in Cairo, although the group
mentioned above did often hold its annual gala performances
(under the patronage of the local notables) in the Theatre
Royal de l'Opera.  I would be happy to hear from anyone who
has knowledge of Yiddish-language cultural life in Egypt
(mainly Cairo, but also Alexandria and Port Said).  In
separate communications to :HP1.Mendele:EHP1. I will spell
out some of the things we know and a good many we need to
know -- and which some of you may know. Yours, Yude-Leyb
Proger {Leonard Prager}.

Subject: Yiddish Actors in Cairo

For the sake of brevity, I merely list the names of all
those of whom I know who at one time or other played on the
Yiddish stage in Cairo.  I mark with asterisks the names of
those about whom I have some information.  Most of those on
this list were enthusiastic amateurs who year after year
learned new roles in new plays for charity perfomances,
enjoying themselves immensely and giving pleasure to
countless others as well.  A number of families had two or
more of its members in the group.  In "Yiddish Theater in
Cairo" (:HP1.Bulletin of the Israel Academy in Cairo:EHP1.
No. 15 {1992}), I discuss the players rather genenerally.
In a more detailed work in progress (tentatively entitled
"Vaytere yedies vegn dem yidishn teater in kair"), I give a
fuller account of the actors and their repertory.  I would
appreciate 1) the names of actors not on my list; 2)
information identifying those whose names are not
asterisked; 3) information of any kind about the persons
whose names are asterisked; 4) any general information
about Yiddish theater and radio in Egypt.  The names below
are given first of all in the Standard Yiddish Romanization
and then in the spelling used in Latin-letter languages by
the person himself -- a form I sometimes have to
reconstruct by instinct and so may get wrong.  I do not
attempt to give all the years in which the individual actor
appeared on the Yiddish stage in Cairo (and Alexandria and
Port Said as well).

Subject: Yiddish Imprints in Egypt

When we think of Yiddish in Egypt in connection with the
written word, our first association, rightly enough, is the
Geniza, where invaluable Yiddish manuscripts and early
printed materials have been found.  These items migrated to
Egypt but did not originate there.  Many hundreds of items,
however, were printed in Egypt in Yiddish during the late
nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth centuries as
part and parcel of the cultural life of a very small yet
vital Ashkenazic community which, in addition to having its
own synagogue, had a Yiddish theater group of its own, its
own Yiddish radio programs, and in the years 1907-1908, a
Yiddish weekly, :HP1.Der tsayt:EHP1..  The theater group
maintained a large archive in the building where the
Ashkenazic synagogue was located.  It was a repository for
playbills, programs, manuscripts of plays, correspondence
-- a rich assortment of handwritten and printed materials.
This collection was destroyed on Balfour Day, 2 November
1945, when a Muslim Brotherhood mob burnt down the
synagogue building. Printed Cairo Yiddish theater materials
and Egyptian Yiddish imprints, including bilingual and
trilingual ones are today scarce. Fortunately, the YIVO has
a small but valuable collection of such items. It should be
possible today to find out if anything has been saved in
Egypt. I would appreciate hearing of Egyptian Yiddish
imprints of any and every kind.  Yiddish letters written
from Egypt also interest me.  All of this searching and
recording is part of the larger business of mapping the
Yiddish contours of Ashkenaz Three -- all the countries to
which Eastern European Jews migrated in the past few
centuries. .sk There were Jewish printers in Cairo who
printed materials in Hebrew, Yiddish, Arabic, French and
English and perhaps in some other languages as well.  In
1895 Herman and Maurice Grunberg migrated to Cairo from
Galatz, Romania and started a printing press, later taken
over by Maurice's son, Lazare.  At least in the early years
they may have printed Hebrew and Yiddish.  The
:HP1.Encyclopaedia Judaica:EHP1. (Jerualem: Keter, 1971,
vol. 5, p. 31) tells us there were five Hebrew printing
presses in Cairo after 1905 -- a few of these also printed
Yiddish items. In the 1920s there are posters printed in
the "Druk fun Yankev Liskovits" ('Printing Shop of Jacob
Liskowitz'). Some of the multilingual programmes were
printed by "Defus Chayim Vayzl, Kahir" ('Printing Shop of
Haim Weisel, Cairo'). Often there was only one two-page
inner spread for the Yiddish version of theater programs,
almost everything else being in roman letters (mainly
French, but also English).  In the early thirties the
programmes are half French and half Yiddish.  There were
also flyers in both languages advertising the same play.
Original Yiddish plays were written in Cairo, but were they
printed there?  Were any Yiddish books or booklets, as
distinct from periodicals, published in Egypt? Perhaps
:HP1.Mendele:EHP1. members can help answer some of these
questions.
