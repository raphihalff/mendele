Subject: Chernohuz

Stork appears to be one of the most diverse Yiddish birds! Lucas Bruyn
(Vol.10.005.6) is right that chernohuz is stork in Ukrainian and local
(Sholem-Aleykhem's) Yiddish. Vladimir Dal's Russian Dictionary reads:
"Chernoguz - aist, busel". And perhaps every region in our Yiddishland has
its own word for this bird. Here's what I found: shtorkh (shterkh), bochan
(buchan, botsyan), bushl (bushlik), chernohuz (chernoguz), and finally in my
own homeland it was called kukastyrke.

Subject: tshernohuz

with reference to Lucas Bruyn's query [10.005:6] re 'tshernohuz', there can
be little doubt, but that in the context cited the meaning is 'stork', the
bird's long beak parodying Mendl's "spitseke noz". Mendele has just
0slightly Russified the Ukrainian term 'chornohuz', not surprising given the
relative status of the two languages at the time.

Subject: Sholem Aleichem's funeral

I read the following sentence in an introduction about Sholem Aleichem at
http://www.mottel.com/intro.html.

"His funeral in New York was the largest ever seen up until that time, over
200,000 people walked with their Folkwriter from the Bronx, down Broadway in
Manhattan, to his internment in Brooklyn. His will is considered one of the
great ethical wills in History, and was read into the Congressional Record."

Can any maven or mumkhe give me or refer me to further information on Sholem
Aleichem's ethical will & epitaph on his stone??

BTW -- where is he buried -- in which cemetery ??

Subject: Bontche Shveig

Allow me to enter the "Bontche Shveig" fray. I believe I was the first to
have a translation into English published .....a very long time ago.

The discussants have what I believe is a misunderstanding both of the story
and of its author. Peretz was definitely not anti-religious. True, he was a
leading light among the burgeoning secular, socialist-oriented Jewish
movement; but he observed traditional Jewish customs and respected the right
of the religious to their beliefs.

Early on Peretz demonstrated his respect for tradition in a spectacular way.
Having set up a brewery, he found himself with a large inventory of beer in
process at Pesach. Rather than be part of ongoing fermentation, he poured
his entire inventory down the drain and went bankrupt.

Much of Peretz's writing concerned the Jewish way of compensating for their
harried existence through believing in redemption in the next world. Bontche
was Peretz's allegory for the downtrodden Ashkenazim so acceptive of their
destiny that even their dreams of redemption in the next world had little
scope.

One more facet on Peretz. He was probably the first male writer in any
European language to defend womankind. His "Sholem Bayiss"(domestic peace)
is usually considered his version of the Romeo and Juliet story. I disagree.
It is a story of a hardworking, poverty-stricken illiterate man rebelling
against the fate of Jewish women in both this world and the next.

Subject: Spelling and neshome

Noyekh Miller poses a deeply neshomedike question: Should a Yiddish book,
upon reissue, conform to the author's spelling, or should YIVO spelling be
invoked?

Azoy vi tsugeshikt fun himl, the day after the question was posed, iz
ongekumen a bikhl in post, a matone fun Lanskyn, Harkavy's _amerikanisher
briefen-shteler_, digitized. Iz dos bikhl geshribn altmodish, daytshmerish,
un ven ikh hob es bakukt, iz take gekumen tsu mir forleyenen mayn bobe in ir
fatsheyle mit di bloye blimelekh. Just as Noyekh indicated, its old style
spelling adds an enriching dimension to its reading. Proof positiv, on the
one hand, that all art is timebound, and those boundaries must be respected.

But as Tevye would say - on the other hand, if not for standardizations, we
would still be reading when that Aprille with its shoures soote (or a
reasonable facsimile)..... I must voice my hope that standardization is what
happens after centuries of developmental changes in speech and/or spelling,
and that these standardizations are based upon the words that prevail in the
neshomes of the people in the marketplace of the day. These rules create a
base for academics and for 'right' and 'wrong' in fine-tuning language
through time.

Only a gazlen would veto or give up copies (Shakespeare, Browning...) with
the wouldsts and shouldsts and thees and thous. But only a gazlen would let
choice of word become a free for all between both stages.

Subject: The etymology of 'grenets'

With reference to Al Grand's query [10.005:7] re the etymology of 'grenets',
there is no doubt that this etymon is of Old Slav origin and that the German
(modern 'Grenze') was borrowed first of all in the Prussian marches around
the middle of the thirteenth century. It is also clear for reasons that have
been aired in "these columns" by me and others many times before that the
origin cannot be Russian. Ukrainian and Czech are, of course, excluded by
the initial 'g'. The present form of the Yiddish word appears to be equally
compatible with a borrowing from the MHG 'greniz(e)' or from an Old Polish
(initially stressed) 'granica'. It would be hard to prove, I think, from
which of these two it derived and it is probably unnecessary to do so, since
it is not uncommon for Yiddish words to have mutually reinforcing multiple
origins. Paul Wexler would, no doubt, wish to appeal to a putative Old
Sorbian origin and might just be right in doing so.

Subject: Translating a Yizkor Book

Ben Fogel's commentary concerning the Brzezin Yizkor Book are all too true.

I am the Chronicler of the Freidin Family of Zelva (Belarus). Beginning in
1985, I addressed this problem, when I received a then recently published
'Sefer Zikaron Zelva,' from Israel. I successfully translated this from
Hebrew into English and published it in 1992.

In 1998, landsleit from the shtetl of Dereczin, adjacent to Zelva, provided
me with the largely Yiddish (some Hebrew) Yizkor book for their shtetl. I
successfully translated this into English, and published it this past March,
2000.

This is not difficult work, but suffers from being extremely tedious. I am
not done: I am just launching a translation of a trilogy of Yizkor Books for
the town of Volkovysk. After that, members of my father's family have
requested that I tackle the Zamosc Yizkor Book.

My plate is full for the forseeable future.

In my translator's forward to the Dereczin Memorial Book, I make mention of
the great irony attached to the decision by our forbears to record their
memories in mameloshn. A formidable wall has descended between the
generation who set down their memories, and their progeny, who were often
denied the requisite language facility, in the rush to assimilate into the
mainstream of their newly found homeland.

Time inexorably is running out for those with adequate linguistic skills to
tear down that wall, because our ranks are not -- repeat-- not being
replenished in a sufficiently meaningful way to overcome this problem in the
large.

Subject: gevir

1. Does anyone know the etymology of the Yiddish, "gevir" wealthy man,
patron and by implication boss of the shtetl? Is it related to the
Hebrew/Yiddish gevura power, mastery, which is in turn related to
"gever"male, gibor hero, etc?

2. If that is the correct derivation, how does it impact on the meaning of
the word? Does the derivation imply that Yiddish speakers always had a
realistic grasp of the relationship beween power and wealth, or more
concretely, the power and control assumed by wealthy individuals in shtetl
affairs?

3. This question arose for me with regard to the role of Australian mining
entrepreneur Joseph Gutnick, a controversial powerbroker in Israeli
politics, who bankrolled the election publicity which won Netanyahu the last
but one election.(He financed the controversial "Bibi is good for the Jews"
slogan.) In a recent biography, Diamonds and Demons: the Joseph Gutnick
story, by David Bernstein, Gutnick, a passionate adherent of the late
Lubavitcher Rebbe, justifies his role in politics and religion as that of
the traditional "gevir".  He repeats over and over that this role was
designated for him by the Lubavitcher Rebbe. He was chosen to be the Rebbe's
"gevir", or wealthy patron.

Gutnick is clearly proud of the title, which has no negative associations
for him. But, my own feeling is that in colloquial Yiddish , the concept of
"gevir", is an ambiguous one. When Jews were an impoverished and oppressed
minority,  leadership of the shtetl was vested in the gevir who had the
skills and means to protect their community from hostile authorities. Would
I be correct in sensing that the word has gradually acquired negative or
ironic "godfather"overtones, i.e. implying aspirations for political control
by oligarchic elites, which still remains a problem for modern Jewish
communities?

4. This question is political. On the strength of a personal appointment by
the Rebbe, his gevir, Joseph Gutnick uses his wealth to influence politics
in Israel. Does this mean that Lubavitch and other ultra-orthodox movements
are stuck in a time warp, trying to revive the power structures and
relationships of the shtetl where Jews were an oppressed minority, on the
modern state of Israel?

5. Is one justified in pursuing such an argument based on the semantics of a
single word?

Let me mix into the debate over "amolik" (Mendele Vol.10,No. 2). Why no one
has thrown in   the word "ehemals": (from the German), which means
"formerly, of a time" is something I can't understand. It's just a short
adverbial step into '"ehemalik>ehemolik>amolik"

Greetings to all
