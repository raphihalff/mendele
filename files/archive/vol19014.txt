Subject: farker-mitlen

farker-mitel - or mitlen, in plural - means mode, or means of 
transportation -i.e. cars, trucks, etc. The sentence you reproduce means: 
There were means of transportation but they were not available because all 
of them had been requisitioned by the Polish military.

Mit a grus,
Dina Levias

[Moderator's Note: similar responses were sent by Leybl Goldberg, Martin 
Jacobs,Mirjam Gutschow, Norman Buder, Peter Gutmann, Rukhl Schaechter, and 
Zachary M.Baker, most of whom indicated the contemporary German cognates 
(Verkehr, Mittel) for these words.]

Subject: cancer

Joshua Kutz recently asked about the Yiddish for "cancer" and mentioned 
the word "kreps." "Krebs" is the standard German word for cancer, and, 
given the normal sound of "b" here, would be "kreps" in Yiddish. Weinreich 
translates it as "crab," which is of course the other meaning (the 
Zodiacal sign "Cancer" is "the Crab," and the way crabs consume flesh is 
doubtless the referent for the current medical use of "cancer")l

Subject: "Mayn Kindheyt"

A friend asked me about a poem by Yitskhak Viner in the Ringelblum Archive 
of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, translated into English by Dr. 
Moskovitz.

http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/presentations/features/details/2=
004-07-09/

The text is handwritten and not well-reproduced on the site, so there are 
ambiguities in the transliteration. This is what I reconstruct, aided by 
the translation:

Yorn fun kindhayt in Balutisher hoyfn
Mayn mame, mayn tate in oremer heym
Kh'gedenk nokh mayn hunger, ven kh'hob mit khaveyrim
Broytn gebakn fun blotikn leym

Broytn gebakn -- opshpiln dem hunger
Dem noentstn un shlekhtstn fun undzere gest
Farbay iz der zumer, in hits bay rinshtokn *** ??? ***
Gekumen iz vinter mit shney un [not there, but meter suggests "mit"] frest

[lots of letters indecipherable here -- my best guess]
Groy iz der droysn, in shney [oykh ??] gezunken
Di dekher**, di moyer, farzilbert, farvayst
Ikh lig oyf geleger, in shmates farviklt
Kuk mir durkh shoybn, fardekt mit ayz

Geyt fri mayn tate -- zikh fregn oyf arbet
Blayb ikh mit mamen, in tunkeler heym
Kalt iz ... m[e]'hungert, nito vos tsu esn
Glust [reconstructed] mikh khotsh bakn, a broytl fun leym

** "dekher"  roofs.  I think the translator misread d (daled) as b (beys),
and got "bekher" =beaker(s), translated as "wine glass," which makes no 
sense to
me.

*** ??? *** Farbay iz der zumer, in hits bay rinshtokn
Moskovitz translates "rinshtokn" as gutters (as does Weinreich).
My first question is, "What kind of gutters??" -- drains along the roof 
edges, drains in the
streets, or what.
My second question is this:  what is the image?
My third question is:  Is this a misreading for "binshtokn" (could they 
have had beehives in courtyards in pre-war Baluty/Lodz, and is "heat 
rising from beehives" a reasonable image)?
The spacing is a bit odd in the script, and the reysh is squarer/flatter 
on the top than in most cases, although it is written that way in "farbay" 
at the beginning of the same line.
The beys also has many forms, fairly clear in that same "farbay," but 
sometimes odd, for example, in both "broytn" and "gebakn" at the start of 
the fourth line  of the first stanza.
Hoping that some experts will help me out.

Subject: The origins of Ashkenaz in Fourth Century Crimea

The major objection to the hypothesis that the Germanic component of 
Yiddish is underlyingly Gothic is that Gothic was spoken in eastern 
Europe, Spain and Italy, mostly before 600 while Yiddish appears later in 
Germany. A new post at
www.gothicyiddish.blogspot.com
traces the origins of the Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazim to the Gothic-ruled 
Crimean Bosporus ca. 262. Jews from this Crimean community subsequently 
participated in the Ostrogothic invasion of Italy and then migrated to the 
German-speaking lands.

Subject: ayngeshtelt in firlekh/pirlekh

This expression occurs in a description of Jews being forced to run for a 
train that would take them to a concentration camp. Because of the nature 
of the orthography I do not know if the last word is "firlekh" or 
"pirlekh"; I am inclined towards the former, which I presume means "little 
carts," but I do not know what is happening here. The context:

m'hot gemuzt loyfn, ayngeshtelt in firlekh, un ver es hot nisht gekent 
nokhloyfn, oder iz aroys fun di reyen, hot men glaykh dershosn.

Subject: Max Perlman's "Benzin"

I haven't heard the recording, so my slight emendations to Cedric's 
transcription are based primarily on spelling corrections.  However, the 
first line made no sense to me ("petroleum iz a tsoyber klang, un akht vi 
flisik gold"), so I changed it to something with roughly the same phonemes 
but more sense.  I also re-punctuated a bit.

---

petroleum iz a tsoyber, tog un nakht, vi flisik gold
di velt bakumen hot a nayem zin.
es hot der mentsh gevolt azoy, un di tsayt hot es gevolt
az alts zol dreyen zikh arum benzin.

     ay vil men forn, ay vil men forn,
 	nor tsum forn darf men ongisn benzin.
     un az men gist nit keyn benzin,

Subject:  "Unter dayne vayse shtern"

Dear Colleagues,

Being new on this list, I'd like to profit from the cumulated expertise 
represented by the fellow list members. In the famous song "Unter dayne 
vayse shtern," two words occur that are opaque to me (probably due to my 
ignorance): The verse goes like this:

*nemen* yogn mikh meshune
trep un hoyfn - mit *gevoy*.

My simple question is: How to translate "nemen" and "gevoy"? Any helping 
hand?

Best wishes,
Wolfgang Schulze
