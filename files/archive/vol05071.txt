Subject: Yiddish nowadays

I have done some study of Yiddish among the haredim in Israel, which
inspired me to pay attention to the use of Yiddish in Boro Park and
Williamsburg. The use of the language and the user's proficiency is quite
variable, from what I have heard and in Williamsburg there is a
tremendous amount of mixing of Yiddish and English, with errors. But as
others have commented, errors are offset by the fact that the speakers
are actively using the language. In the study of language acquisition-
and language deterioration, error analysis is an important indicator of
what it happening to a language. What I found in Israel among the Yiddish
using haredim is a pattern in which parents have chosen to go back to
Yiddish and consciously speak a flawed Yiddish, Hebrew being the language
they are most comfortable in, for ideological reasons.  Perhaps this is
happening in New York too. This bodes well for the revival of the
language. the other kind of flawed Yiddish is the variety where it is
fading into disuse and that is mainly in the secular Yiddish world, as we
all know. To counter this it is necessary to promote "real" use of the
language. Even on this network I find myself writing more comfortably in
English, even though I am bilingual, because I imagine that more readers
will understand and because I am not comfortable with the conventions of
the phonetic transcriptions, though I will make an effort. My Yiddish is
galitzianish, and I like it that way. I find it awkward, in latin
letters, to sound litvish, but I can try. In terms of error correction,
the best way is to model the correct forms back to the speaker
unobtrusively, but to remember that dialect differences are not errors.
True errors are rules of English or some other language that are
superimposed onto Yiddish.

Subject: An index for Mendele

Ever since I have been a Mendelnik (almost a year), I have been telling
my friends what a wonderful source for Yiddish related topics it is.  I
have pointed out the fact that much of the information on Mendele is not
available in books or journals because it is based on personal
experiences and remembrances.  Now, our shames has done an outstanding
job of making all this information available in archives which can be
accessed in several ways as indicated at the end of some of the Mendele
numbers. However, if one were interested in pursuing a single topic such
as the origin of Yiddish, the various aspects of Sholem Aleikhem's
writings, the meanings and usage of a particualar Yiddish word or idiom,
the varieties of Yiddish as a function of geography, etc., it seems to me
that an index, like the ones found at the end of textbooks, would be a
most useful tool to accomplish this purpose.  I realize that it is easier
to suggest an idea than it is to carry it out.  But if this could be done
for the past five plus years, and then continued on an on-going basis,
what an even more wonderful treasure Mendele would be!  It would be like
the Syntopicon which Mortimer Adler created to follow any theme through
the entire Great Books series.

Subject: An index for Mendele

This is a partial answer to Morrie Feller's request, partial because the
ultra-high technicalities are beyond the abilities of a shames.  Iosif
Vaisman and other experts are urgently invited to provide additional
comments

First of all, the functional equivalent of an index exists.  It is
available on the Wide World Web to all users of Netscape.

    http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/mewais.html

It is part of Iosif Vaisman's wonderful Virtual Shtetl, the address of
which is:

    http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/shtetl.html

At the first-mentioned address the user can initiate a search (be sure it
is a _whole_ word) and get back very quickly a list of the first 40
occasions in the which the word is found.  An additional click brings up
the file itself.  Not bad.  Even Windows-haters can come to like it.

Second, it is possible _in principle_ to do the same search without
Netscape, as long as the service provider offers Lynx.  The trouble is
that Lynx (at least the version available to the shames on two separate
hosts) cheerfully announces that you've discovered a bug un az es kumt
mazeltov.  Maybe they'll fix it.

Third, the Contents files that are available via the Mendele archive
can be downloaded to the user's machine, then searched by means of
a utility program such as grep.  There are many available in the public
domain.  The Contents files list all of the Subject: lines since the
first issue and were devised by Bob Rothstein, one of Mendele's prime
benefactors.

Finally, those with a large hard drive can simply store all of Mendele
and search the files at will.  At this time, this remains the best option
for those who have the space.  It is fast and the search procedure more
flexible than what is currently available on the Web.

As an alternative it's been suggested that Mendele on a compact disk
would be a useful and cheap storage medium.  Same ease of search.

Now let the experts speak.
