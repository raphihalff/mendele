Subject: Klal-yidish tsvishn di frume

Yasher koyekh to Raphael Finkel on the list of differences between frum
Yiddish today and the YIVO standard.  I have similar impressions from
reading the Satmar-oriented weekly "Der Yid" (recommended in a recent
Mendele; I second the recommendation.)  That is, lots of modern
German
influence, some modern Hebrew influence (in spite of Der Yid's strong
ideological stance against modern Hebrew), a frequent use of English for
modern things (truck, bus driver, various technological items) and a
weakening of gender and case distinctions.  I think there is in particular a
disappearance of Slavic vocabulary.  E.g. Weinreich gives only words of
Slavic origin as equivalents to "lake" but Der Yid uses the English word. 
Similarly a Bobov Hasid in Boro Park told me that the Yiddish word for
"supper" is now "supper" ("soper" in YIVO transliteration) -- and, he said,
after all in the old country people also didn't use "nakhtmol", they used
the Polish word, "vyetshere".  I.e. he didn't see the Slavic word as rooted
in Yiddish. 

However, Der Yid does _not_ have a discernable standard.  The same
words may
appear with different spellings and seemingly different genders on the
same
page, even in the same article.  I expect this reflects a situation of
cheerful linguistic anarchy in the frum communities. 

The blurring of gender and case distinctions is especially interesting
since
it has the potential to make Yiddish much easier to learn.  In various
children's tapes and books from Brooklyn communities, "der" "di"  and
"dos"
all tend to be replaced by "di" or "de", at least in the nominative.  It
doesn't matter if the subject is clearly masculine.  A tape which my 2 1/2
year old son loves, "Velvl Vi Azoy", features "Eli di Elefant", "Kalman di
Keml", and other male animal characters all referred to with a clearly
pronounced "di".  A different but parallel development is a use of "der" for
a masculine noun in all cases, e.g. "fun der Rebe".  (I'm assuming these
are
new developments in response to the English linguistic environment, but
perhaps they reflect earlier dialect differences?) 

Meanwhile the ongoing penetration of English into these bastions of
Yiddish
is very noticeable in the advertising, which is often in English, and
especially the classifieds, many of which are in English and many others
in
extremely anglicized Yiddish:  "Tsvey rumige beysment apartment tsu
farrentn.  Redi arayntsumufn.  Speshl prays far kesh dil..."  Something I
wonder greatly is how the writers of the articles in the same paper
maintain
their rather high standard of non-anglicized Yiddish.  Are there even
such
resources as dictionaries or grammars in the frum communities? 

I hope that the day will come before too long when contemporary frum
Yiddish
is studied and taught in the wider world; i.e. when Yiddish is considered
like any other language, to be studied accordingly to how it is usually
written and spoken by the majority of its contemporary users.

Subject: The "People's Yiddish"

Hershl Goodman has presented a sensible and honest rebuttal to recent
unfavorable characterization of Yiddish as it is spoken in Boro Park and
here in Lotusland where I live.  The use of everyday, common,
ungrammatical Yiddish should need no defense; it is what  it is because
it is a living spoken language.  In another recent posting there is
reference to "laxness in gender usage" and the "dative of feminine nouns
and adjectives".  These terms are meaningful to classical Yiddish and
serious students of the language.  I don't believe these terms are
uppermost in the minds of people who simply want to speak to each
other
and be understood.  Why don't we welcome the diversity among our own
people instead of setting standards that inhibit and demean?

I also would like to agree with Miriam Halkin concerning English
translations, they would be most welcome.  I am renewing my
acquaintance
with Yiddish and the English makes my attempt at pronunciation and
comprehension less arduous.

Subject: Translations in Mendele

I liked Hershl Goodman's essay on various types of Yiddish, especially
as
spoken by the orthodox. It was great help to me to have an English
translation of the Yiddish transliteration. Even though I am a native born
Yiddish speaker it is most difficult for me to read Yiddish quickly,
effortlessly, and enjoyably. So an English translation is most
appreciated.
I wish everyone else would do the same when they transliterate to
Mendele.
Also I couldn't agree more with Itsik Goldenberg. When I learned Yiddish
as
a child and it was my first language, my ignorant family spoke it as
mamalochen. So now when educated people write to Mendele in
educated correct
Yiddish I need a translation in English.

Again I think all transliterations should be translated unless certain
writers wish to only reach a certain audience. It is much too difficult for
me to bother reading a transliteration with many words that I would
recognize if I heard them but am too lazy to dope out slowly. After all
reading Mendele for me is fun and since I am retired I refuse to work any
more. So, with all due respect, for duffers like me, please translate if you
wish to reach as many people as you can. If you wish to keep it elitist
and
snobbish you also know how to do that.

Subject: bilingual messages

Just wanted to add my voice to those who have already urged people to
write
messages in both Yiddish and English when possible.  After having
taken some
very basic Yiddish classes, Mendele is my primary source for
maintaining
what I have learned and expanding upon it.  I do this by attempting to
translate messages written in Yiddish.  My dictionary is not good enough
to
enable me to do it all on my own (nor do I have enough time), so I rarely
attempt to read messages that do not have an English translation
attached. 
Please think our your bilingual messages as a teaching device for those
of
us who want to learn Yiddish.  Thanks.

Subject: Mendele University; Ein Kleinekeit!

It seems as though I have been a subscriber to Mendele for the past two
years or more. My yiddish is that of a New York Eastside Jew of the
"fifties" who learned Yiddish by listening to my grandmother talking to my
tante. They were both illiterate and so theirs was a learned-by-hearing
language and the only one they spoke. Their English was worse than my
Yiddish. 

I cannot tell you how much I enjoy reading the comments both in Yiddish
and
in English. I didn't ever feel (until now) that my limited language
knowledge would keep me from learning whatever I can grasp from the
language
of my forebearers. 

You professors can argue all you want about the correct transliteration
and
YIVO rules. I am just a non-matriculating student at Mendele University. 

As for me, if the going gets rough, there is always the delete key.  Ahbei
Gezunt... Oh you know what I mean.

[In English]

When somebody says that Yiddish is dead, it really seems like crazy talk.
We look around and we hear and see and read Yiddish.  Living people
discuss
matters in Yiddish; write to each other; send each other Yiddish letters. 
As long as living people use Yiddish, no one can say that Yiddish is
dead. 
In plain talk, it is a wild absurdity.  It is easily dismissed with a wave
of the hand. 

However, Yiddish faces a greater danger.  Against Yiddish is posed a
horrible danger when an academician with influence in our community
shouts
that Yiddish is "irrelevant;" bears no relevance to our life.  Who says? 
The great accomplishments of Khone Shmeruk, Avrom Sutzkever,
Sholem
Aleichem, Peretz, Mendele, and on, and on, are of no relevance to us? 
That'll be the day! 

Such words from academicians can indeed rob young and old of resolve
and
enthusiasm for Yiddish.  Such words give encouragement, support the
zeal of
right-wingers like David Klinghoffer and his allies and their clumsy,
blundering, hostile notions about Yiddish and about Jews.  If
academicians
with influence place Yiddish in such danger, should we remain silent? 

Silence is good for nothing.
