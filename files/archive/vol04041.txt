Subject: Introduction

My name is Peter Kluehs and I live with my wife Lore (Tajbele) in
Wehrheim, a small town in the Taunus mountains near Frankfurt am Main. I
was accepted today to your list and I look forward to many interesting
contacts. I am 62 and as far as I know I have no jewish ancestors.
However, a grand-grand-grandfather of mine was called Nuernberger!?!?
Anyway, one of my many hobbies is studying languages. When I got hold of
Salcia Landmann's book JIDDISH, I wanted to learn as much as possible
about this language. There is practically no literature in Jiddish
available here, but I am listening every day to the Jiddish edizie of kol
israel from Jerusalem on short wave.

I started only a month ago on the Internet and I still have much to learn
about the intricacies of the net. So please have patience with me.

Schalom mit aich

Subject: Festival of Yiddish Music and Theater

This is to inform all those who might be interested that the annual
Yiddish Culture Festival will be held this year on Wednesday, July 6th,
at 6pm at the Damrosch Park, which is located at Lincoln Center. The
concert is sponsored by the Culture and Education Department of the
Workmen's Circle and admission is free. If the concert is only half as
good as the one they gave last year, you are in for a very special treat.

Unfortunately, I shall not be able to attend this year. I shall be in
Israel where I fully intend to attend the Yiddish concert on July 31st,
as described by Leybl Botwinick's recent posting to this list.
Incidentally, the Damrosch Park concert has a rain-date of July 27th.

Enjoy,

Henry Mullish

Subject: Name origins

A friend whose last name is Scott, has recently discovered the Yiddish
name was Zgutt.  (Zgoot?, Sgoot?)  Other than the obvious contractions
possible, does anyone have any light to shed on this name.  I don't know
her region of origin.

While I'm at it, interested in any feed back ( other than very helpful
comments originally received from M. Herzog a while ago) on my family
name: " Zazulyer." " Zazulya" is old fashioned word for cuckoo in Polish,
Ukranian, Latvian.  Family legend has it that an ancestor/woodsman could
imitate the bird in the forest preserve near Brest.  (vicinity
Shershev/Pruzany).  I also understand that the old French verb for
twittering like a bird is something like " gazoolier". This is another
saga of an original name grossly distorted by emigration
authorities...and rediscovered and used now by me.

Thanks,

Leah Zazulyer

Subject: Re: A proposal

Four questions about the proposal for the "Centre for YIDDISH and
Technologic Newware":

1. Who are the "many individuals and institutions around the world" who
   have been sent your missive, and have any of them agreed to be on a
   Board of Directors?

2. What is your proposed operating budget?

3. Have you obtained tax-exempt status?

4. Have you contacted the ISO committee(s) concerned with
   "internationalization" of software to put in your 2 shekels and make
   sure that Yiddish characters are included in the list of alphabets to
   form the basis of the new standard character coding that will replace
   ASCII? Because before you can even think about efficient storage of
   Yiddish media (especially print media) on electronic storage devices,
   you'll need an internationally-accepted "mapping" of characters to
   their representations in zeros and ones. The alternative is
   transliteration or very-large scanned images of text, and the former
   will defeat your purpose while the latter will defeat your budget.
