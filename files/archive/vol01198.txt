Your second sentence doesn't answer the question.  Of
course a secular book isn't a sefer.  I asked whether sefer
is a subset of bukh.  In other words, if you see a chumash
or gemora on the table, may you refer to it as a bukh as an
alternative to calling it a sefer.  So far we have one
answer (from Dovid Braun, I believe), saying the answer is
no.

Subject: Ben Ami - Mendele, no. 197

I am not sure if Ben Ami that Dan Breslauer is reffering to
is the same Hayim-Mordekhai Ben-Ami that I found in the
Leksikon fun der nayer Yidisher literatur, vol. 1 (1956),
col. 349-350.

Hayim-Mordekhai Ben-Ami, born Aug. 3, 1854, died March 11,
1932. Pseud. of Hayim-Mordekhai Rabinovich. Son of a
Hasidic family. Lived in Paris and Geneva and immigrated to
Erets Yisrael in 1923. Died in Tel-Aviv.

Published several books in Yiddish and Hebrew.

Subject: Introduction

Zev Bar-Lev, linguist, mostly engaged now in a
multi-language project.  My main teaching language is
Hebrew (I designed and teach/administer an 8-course program
at San Diego State U.), but I also have designed and teach
multi-language courses, offering inter alia Arabic,
Japanese, Chinese, Greek, Russian, Italian, and a bunch of
other languages -- including of course Yiddish. When I have
room in my schedule, I also teach Jewish heritage at SDSU.

Subject: nokh entfers

To Dan Breslauer: I think Ben-Ami is Yankev Ben-Ami,
Yiddish director and playwright.  Check the _leksikon fun
der nayer yidisher literatur_ or the Yiddish theater
lexicon for more info.  (Is the latter called:  _leksikon
funem yidishn teater_?  Don't have reference on hand.)

My grandfather tells me of a WWII army-mate of his, a
native Yiddish-speaker, who was a polyglot of the type "I
know seven languages and Henglish the best." (This joke my
father tells.)  Not to expose himself as (but a lowly)
Yiddish-speaker, he would tell people "ikh shprekh dautsh".
Dautsh!

Subject:  "Philologus" column in the English FORWARD

Who IS this guy, anyway?  Is his identity known?  Does it
matter?  Anyone with conclusive evidence, please step
forward (sorry, couldn't resist).

Subject: brief introductory statement

I, David Brenner, am currently completing my Ph.D. in
Germanic Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. (cut
here if necessary) My doctoral dissertation is a study of
Jewish identity and assimilation in the German-language
Jewish cultural journal, Ost und West.  The journal
published many contributions from Eastern Jewish writers
and on Eastern Jewish topics as well as many translations
from Yiddish.  I welcome comments from anyone who knows
anything regarding the specific journal and its
producers/contributors as well as regarding journal and
periodical history in general.
