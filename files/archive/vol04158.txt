Subject: Translation

[re: Ausubel's translation (Vol 4.146)]

I find this translation astonishing, or I am utterly stupid?  One
grandfather is not a scholar, but a lush; the other is a crook.  So to
name the child after either of these grandfathers, makes for great
laughter, since they both have the same name.  They are both, the
grandfathers, useless.  What gives here?

Subject: Only in my family..

In response to Dovid Braun's request:

My mother used to (and still sometimes does) call me "bunshkie" (or
"boonshke") as an endearing term.  She has no idea why she started saying
it -- she thinks she might have just made it up.  But it certainly has
that Yiddish sound.  (It could be spelled "beis" "vov" "nun" "shin" "kuf"
"ayin.")  Has anyone heard this word before?  And does anyone have ideas
about its etymology?

Subject: Rote brik, this time clearly

I was quite unclear in my original posting on the matter of "Rote brik"
so no wonder no one could figure out what I meant.  Oi.  Guilt.

What I meant was this: When used as the name of a place, is there
anything humorous about calling it Rote brik?  That is to say, it is the
Yiddish equivalent of Podunk, or some other tiny, insignificant village
that has no activity of any kind?

Thus, to say that someone is from Rote brik is to say that they are a
hayseed or a hick.  Is such a subtlety attached to that expression?

That is how I should have expressed my question the first time around.
The fact that I did not has left me with such guilt that I have, as my
mother used to say in Yiddish, been in bed with the doctor for two weeks!
(An exaggeration of course, but a way to transfer guilt to the listener
who therefore must assume that my illness is due to his or her non-respon-
siveness.  It's an art for, the movement of guilt around the universe.)

Subject: Yiddish Software

Stanley Werbow referred to an old program called Mouse-Write, which came
out of the Hillel at Harvard.  If the Harvard Hillel had such a program,
then they probably have an even better one now.  Maybe they have even
collaborated with Harvard's Yiddish Studies Program.  That would be a
real mechayah (sp?), because programs concocted at universities are
usually made available through anonymous ftp at no charge once the
originators perceive that there is a global need for their program.

Surely we must have Harvardians on this list.  Why don't y'all look into
this, and see if you can get something going?

I have been yearning for a word-processing program for Yiddish;  I have
access to Macintosh,  IBM PC, and NeXT computers.  Software for any and
all platforms would be welcome, but I can't spend much.
