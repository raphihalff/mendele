that's remarkable...SO remarkable in fact that i'd wonder
if it wasn't added later. note: '...based on a talk...' you
might want to see if there's a text of the original talk
around before you draw too many conclusions. (with all due
respect, it's not that unusual for yivo to be a few years
behind in publication, even in peacetime!)

Subject:  Khurbm

In MENDELE vol. 2.29 David Neal/Dovid Noyekh Miller asks:

"Has anyone an earlier cite for the use khurbm = Holocaust"
than a 1941 reference to the "Hitler-khurbm," by Max
Weinreich.

This is a potentially deep question, semantically speaking,
because what we know and understand by the term "Holocaust"
is unlikely to have been understood as such, even by Max
Weinreich, in the year 1941 -- when the systematic
annihilation of European Jewry was only beginning (mobile
killing operations in the western Soviet Union, starting in
July; gas chambers at Chelmno, starting in December).

The early years of the war were horrific, with
ghettoization and mass starvation in Warsaw and other
Polish cities, but the consequences had not yet reached the
point, I suggest, that "khurbm" = "Holocaust," according to
our present understanding, or indeed, that which one might
attribute to Weinreich only a year or two later.

Khurbm (Heb.: Hurban) is the term applied to the
destruction of the two Temples in Jerusalem, of course.  In
the early twentieth century it was also applied to such
traumatic periods as the First World War (see S. Ansky's 3
volumes, "Der yidisher khurbm fun Poyln, Galitsye un
Bukovine," published as part of his "Gezamlte shriftn" in
1921-22) and the post- war pogroms in the Ukraine ("Khurbm
Proskurov," published in 1924 -- the prototypical
yisker-bukh, or community memorial volume).  My thesis is
that, in 1941 at least, Weinreich was applying a commonly
used (alas) term to a situation whose ultimate magnitude
was still as yet unrevealed.

Subject: various

1)  Re 2:84 no. 2:  not Itskhik, but Itsik (rimes with
_shpitsik)
 
2)  For Zachary Baker, but might interest others:

      a) Where can one find a copy of Khaym Grades's "Mayn
krig mit Hersh Raseyner"?  I mean the Yiddish original.  b)
What are the bibliographical details for that excellent
Polish geographical work on one of the desks at Yivo, where
the article on Siemiatycze begins on p. 280?  I lost the
reference.
 
3)  I would appreciate the help of _Mendele_ readers in
locating references to drink, drinkers (=shikoyrim),
distilling and innkeepers in Yiddish works.  The amount of
material is immense yet specific references elude one.

Subject: RE: bloyz and nor

Just a little clarification: "bloyz" as an adverb is very
rare in textbook Yiddish, and also in the usage of the
authors I've read. So it tends to be downplayed in
dictionaries. But it's very common in some dialects,
including my parents'. I agree with Ellen that there's no
obvious difference in meaning between "nor" and the adverb
"bloyz".

Interesting point, Ellen, that "bloyz" can't be used as a
conjunction, the way "nor" can be. On the other hand,
"bloyz" is also an adjective (meaning 'bare') and a noun
(meaning 'gap').
