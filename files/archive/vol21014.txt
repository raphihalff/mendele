"Der toyt hot zayn vinkl dortn
tsu vemen kumen hob ikh shoyn nit."

Ba mir heyst der tsveyter ferz:

to whom I have not yet come

Ikh veys nit tsi s'iz der toyt tsi epes andersh vos iz der "whom"...
kh'meyn az s'iz efsher der toyt, vayl der ershter ferz perzonifitsirt im,
ober s'iz a bisl
modne tsu zogn:

Death has his claim staked there
(Death,) to whom I have not yet come

Ikh ken nisht di poeme, bin ikh nisht zikher az ot di iberzetsung leygt
zikh afn saykhl. Nu, s'iz an idee.

If that is so, I will venture a wild hypothetical guess---

"Death has its staked out its plot there,
But there is no one there whom
  I can visit anymore"
i.e.:  my dear ones had no burial, they were victims of the death camps"

Dina Levias

Subject: Fefekuchen-Zilbert poem

"Der toyt hot zayn vinkl dortn
tsu vemen kumen hob ikh shoyn nit."

It seems to me from the tense of the second line, "hob ikh shoyn nisht,"
the more straightforward translation would be:

Death has his little corner there
To which I have not yet come.

Elie Train is apparently confused by the Yiddish syntax which, in this
case, places the objective phrase before the verb. The accurate
translation of the two lines is:

Death has its corner there;
I no longer have anyone to visit.

Hershl Hartman

Death has staked out his corner there;
I no longer have anyone to turn to.

Khane-Faygl Turtletaub

Subject: lise/ Fefekuchen-Zilbert poem

The word "lise" or "lysy" in Yiddish comes from same word for bald is
Russian (probably  Slavic origin, not just Polish)

And Elie Train's question is so sad and moving:

Death has his corner there (i.e. Death has staked out his place there)

the last line translates as So I have no one to come back to, or home to

Subject: Jabberwocky - a protest letter
Date: February 9

I was shocked to read your posting of [Leybl Talmy's Yiddish rendering of
the] Jabberwocky yesterday. The author may be Jewish but if he weren't, I
would have called this anti-Semitic literature.

He could easily have portrayed the antagonist as a goylem or a pipernoter.
By choosing a rabbi, and mocking his beard and peyes, the author reveals
his true colors.

But even more disturbing is: why did Mendele not only permit this posting
but encourage its members to read it?

Rukhl Schaechter

 ..............................................................

The untershames replies:

I take full responsibility for running Talmy's "Jabberwocky." I believe
that even if one takes the selection of a rabbi as at all significant,
this sort of badinage has a secure place in Yiddish folklore and
literature: think Peretz's "Bontshe shvayg," think  even of "az der rebbe
elimelech. "

Moreover, Mendelyaner with a far better knowledge of Yiddish than I have,
have written in praise of Talmy's version.
