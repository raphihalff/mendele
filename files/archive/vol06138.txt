Subject: Introduction

Although I've been on-line with your list a few weeks now, i'm just
getting around to introducing myself to your members.  I live in
Chicago and, while I grew up in an English-speaking environment, used
to hear yiddish spoken by my parents to my grandparents and other
family members.  For twenty years, until my recent retirement, I worked
in the Jewish Community Centers senior adult dept., as well as the
Kagan(Jewish) Home for the Blind, where I  often used Yiddish to
communicate with members.  I am 57 years old, have  3 married children
(2 live in Israel) and 14 eyneklach.  I am presently taking Yiddish
classes with a marvelous teacher, Khane-Feygle Turtletaub, to improve my
grammar and polish up my ability to talk.  Keep up your great work!

Subject: s'katzel kumt

There is  Yiddish expression "s'katzel kumt" which comes from "katzel
kumt". The 's' is for the definitive article. According to Harkavy's
Yiddish dictionary, p.297, s.v. "katzil-kumt" it means: welcome halloo!
how do you do? With the following explanation "This interjection is
usually addressed to women, and it is supposed that 'katzil' is a
contraction of 'God'd will' - an allusion to the fact that in the
Morning Benedictions the Jewish women humbley bless their Creator for
having made them according to "His will," while the Jewish males proudly
thank God for not having made them females". The real Yiddishists at
Mendele might shed more light on this question.

Subject: Language comparisons

in regard to frayedl cielak's query [6.137] about citing german in
discussing elements of yiddish usage--why not?  various postings home in
on borrowings from and differences with other languages--especially the
component tongues of yiddish:  german, hebrew, polish, etc.  I find it
interesting to see how various languages affect one another--and also
how they differ from one another in grammar, usage, imagery, idiom, etc.
i think it's a shame that people living in spanish-speaking countries
dont contribute information on mutual impacts between spanish and
yiddish....

p.s. someone might wish to point out the overwhelming and probably
unwitting impact of english on the yiddish used in mendele--especially the
donnybrook of cases and genders.....

Subject: Yiddish, not "af daytsh"

german is the sister language of yiddish and, since the two diverged
within the last millenium, still very similar to it. for those of us
interested in the linguistic aspects of yiddish (as opposed to, e.g.,
cultural, affective, literary), it is of great interest to know where it
diverges from german and where the two are similar.

hope this helps.

Subject: Bimkom, b'mukoym

When "onshtot" isn't used, I have always (as far as I can remember) have
heard bimkem or bimkom and that includes Israel, where I live. But I can
cite one exception. The word "b'mukoym, bimkem, bimkom" means "in (the)
place of": that one exception was an instance where mamesh a physical
place was meant. A Bobover khosid once informed me that "Shabes" is in
reality a roshei teyves: "shtraymel b'mukoym t'filin". Of course only
half the equation is resolved, but give a khosid a break! As for Tevye's
quotation from Pirke Ovoys, if you're reading it from the text that's
how you'd have to read it and it doesn't mean "in the place of", as it
does in Yiddish, but "In _a_ place" (where there are no men...). S'iz do
tsu mayn meynung, kayn shaykhes nit.
