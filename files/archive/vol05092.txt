Subject: CAJE20 Mendele session

Yiddish is at CAJE20 [Coalition for the Advancement of Jewish Education /
Conference for Alternatives in Jewish Education].  We're having a
wonderful time.  Mendelyaner Bob Rothstein, a professor at the University
of Massachusetts, has joined us. This message is being created as a
demonstration of how to use Mendele. Also here is Yosl Kurland who is
very excited about the possibilities of furthering his Yiddish
activities, including music of which he is a "meyvn." He wishes to
announce that "The Wholesale Klezmer Band" will be performing at Yugntruf
week, Thursday, August 31 in Copake, New York. (Ruvn, <Ruvn@aol.com> is
there room for non-campers to attend the concert?) Yosl plans to
subscribe to Mendele when he gets his modem.

Mendelyaner Henia Lewin is busy with her added session, showing her
slides of Vilnius, Steve Dowling has been busy selling books and Naomi
Kadar after a workshop of showing the latest resources available from the
Workmen's Circle, (34 East 44th street) left the conference early.
Several prospective Mendelyaners have taken down the address for
subscribing to Mendele and we're looking forward to 'seeing' all of you
on Mendele.

Subject: Chicken-footed demons

[Regarding 5.090] Is not that famous Russian witch someone in the form of
a house on chicken legs?  Very famous in South Russia.  Her name escapes
me, though a wonderful satirica novel was written with that name, as I
recall during the Cold War years, in the 70s.

Subject: Willows and chicken-footed demons

Regarding two recent queries on Mendele. The words to "Di verbe,"
[see 5.089] originally written in Hebrew by Bialik and translated into
Yiddish by I. Ma Yofis, can be found in Eleanor Gordon Mlotek and Joseph
Mlotek's _Pearls of Yiddish Song_ (NY: Workmen's Circle, 1988). It
concerns at young woman who decides to ask the willow who her husband
will be: "A gevirete, a groyse/ Iz di verbe, altsding veyst zi. /Bay der
verbe vel ikh vegn/ Mayn bashertn take fregn."

About demons with chicken feet, I can't give any exact citations. But I
have heard of this, and I believe that they show up in the writings of
I.B. Singer.

Subject: Willow song

The song that David Neal Miller asked about (5.089) is "Di verbe" ("Nit
bay tog un nit bay nakht..."), the text of which is a translation by
Yisroel-Avrom Ma-Yofis of a Bialik poem.  The Yiddish words (and the
music) can be found in the Mloteks' col- lection, _Perl fun yidishn lid_.

There is also a Slavic tradition of consulting trees, but at the moment I
can't provide any documentation except for a Russian popular song (in
folk style) of 1954, in which the heroine asks a mountain ash (or rowan
tree, Russian _riabina_) to help her choose between a lathe-operator and
a smith.  The song is called "Ural'skaia riabina."

Subject: Willows

David Neal Miller's shayles stir memories from decades ago. Don't know if
the following is the Chava Albershteyn song he seeks, but my dad used
to sing a song, "Di Verbe", to us.

"Nisht baytog un nisht baynakht
Gey ikh arum fartrakht
Nisht oif barg un nisht oif tol
Shteyt a verbe fun amol.

"A gevirte a groise
Iz di verbe altsding veyst zi
Bay der verbe vel ikh vegn
Mayn bashertn take fregn.

"Un zi vet mir alts dertseyln
Tzi mayn gelibter kumt fun Poyln
Tzi fun Lite tzi fun ...
......................

"Iz er a blonder, a bruneter,
A bokher, tzi a gegeter,
Tzi efsher gor an altn yidn
Bin ikh, tate, nisht tzufridn.

"Vel ikh zogn tate, toyt mikh
Un nisht tzum shidakh greyt mikh
Oy ikh vel dos nisht oyshaltn
Ikh vil, tate, nisht kayn altn."

Oy!

Subject: Pocket book

My mother called her purse a "pocket book." My father who made his living
embroidering these items was said to work "by pocket books."

There was some idle discussion of this term the other day in which it was
suggested that the term was confined to the East Coast and that it is no
longer used. I wondered whether just possibly it was a literal
translation from Yiddish: tashen bukh. Information would be appreciated.
