If the definition of Forverts readers is generally non-religious
Jews, then of course the answer is very few.  I found nothing at
all unusual about the examples given -- they were all sentences
I might have spoken myself.  Note that the majority of the Yiddish
words that are used in English are words relating to the religion.
Note also that in many cases there is no English word that *really*
has the same meaning, and carries the same connotations, as the
Yiddish word that's used.

Can you really translate simcha and shidduch?  Note that even
where these words do have English translations, the use of the
Yiddish word restricts the meaning to "a Jewish X".  One might
refer to a "celebration" or "festivity", but these have a much
wider meaning.  A simcha is specifically a Jewish event that is
celebrated within the Jewish traditions.

There's also some question as to whether these usages are Yiddish
brought into English, or Hebrew brought into English.  Some are
clearly Yiddish.  But, as a test, consider how many of the words
might be used by an Israeli living in the U.S. (with a different
accent on a word like "simcha", of course).

What's unusual here?  To leyn has a specific meaning (to read
from the Torah during services).  What other word could you
possibly use?  "Read" would *not* have the same meaning.
The same goes for Sefer Torah, which is a specific object
for which there is no other convenient term.

I would agree that these are all examples of Judaeo-English.
Whether the words migrated into Judaeo-English through Yiddish
or through Hebrew is probably irrelevant.

Again, perfectly normal speech, if you live in the Orthodox world.
Ahavoh and Sinoh have arrived in the language directly from Hebrew
rather than through Yiddish, I would venture to say.  Again, all the
words given are simply the most convenient and appropriate words to
use; the parallel English words pale in expressiveness, and would
not convey the right connotations.

Next time you're in an Orthodox shul listening to a drosha
(here, I'm doing it myself without realizing it!), pretend you're
not Jewish and don't understand a word of Hebrew, Aramaic or Yiddish.
Then see if you can follow the drosha in the slightest.

Ah.  I see what you mean.  Feel free to add your own commentary

Done.  Dave Sherman and I are obviously maskim one the other.
