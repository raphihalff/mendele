Subject: etymology of nebekh

This question is probably quite simple to answer, but as I have no Harkavy
or Weinreich available, I can't answer it myself: What is the etymology of
nebekh, which is also used in German as nebbich?

Thanks in advance,
Felicitas Payk

Subject: kest

Eager to experience the thrills of the new all-singing, all-dancing Mendele
Mark 2, I hasten to find a pretext: there has recently been some
speculation not only as to the correct designation of this well- known
custom in traditional Ashkenazic life, but also as to the etymology of the
term itself. In 18.003:8 fraynd Garfinkel writes that, if the word is
Hebrew, she doesn't know the spelling. Actually, we need not look so far.
The origin is clearly to be sought in the Germanic component. In NHG we
still encounter the somewhat antiquated expression 'jemanden in Kost
nehmen' in the sense of being responsible for someone's board. Perish the
thought, of course, that the term should derive from NHG! If we consider
MHG for a moment, we quickly come across 'kestigen' [modern 'bekoestigen']
with the meaning 'to feed'. The problem is essentially that of providing an
explanation for the vowel. That any substantival form of this MHG etymon
should ever have had an umlauted plural which could have resulted in 'e' by
a process of derounding seems highly unlikely. More probable therefore is
some deverbal derivative in which an "entrundet" Umlaut resulted in "e."
But whatever the precise mechanics, the Germanic origin is clear. Where the
Germanic form came from is another story.

Subject:  Buzi and sof-oyses

I believe there has been some discussion lately about the origin of the
name Buzi and a query about the lack of a final letter in Soviet
orthography. (Sorry, my relevant email has been erased, and I am relying on
a possibly faulty memory)

When googling "BUZI BIBLE," I found many leads essentially saying the same
thing.  The name, Buzi, appears in Ezekiel 1:3 with the usual English
translation:  "The word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest,
the son of Buzi ..."   Another source mentions that it became a relatively
common name in the Jewish past, sometimes appearing as a feminine one.

With regard to the lack of a final letter:  This was part of the Soviet
policy followed in the printing of Yiddish books.  This practice is
summarized in my Introduction, A Garment Worker's Legacy: the Joe Fishstein
Collection of Yiddish Poetry (Montreal: McGill University Libraries, 1998),
p. xxi.  It can also be seen in the web site by the same name.
[http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/fishstein]  (Press "Catalogue," then
"Introduction," then "Soviet Orthography"):

"Shortly after the revolution in the former Soviet Union, publications in
the Hebrew language were banned, as Hebrew was identified with religion,
Zionism, and 'bourgeois exploitation.'  An official Yiddish Soviet
orthography was adopted, in which all Yiddish words were to be spelled
phonetically, obscuring their Hebrew derivation.  Certain Hebrew letters,
like hes and sof, were eliminated, and often special forms for some final
consonants were abandoned, in so-called conformity with the linguistic
practice of other languages.  Since the arrival of glasnost, standard
Yiddish is being reintroduced into new Russian imprints by the addition of
the phonetic spelling after Hebraisms."(This process is probably now being
done electronically.)

Subject: sof-oyses

The Soviets tried to eliminate the Hebrew connection in Yiddish by changing
loshn-koydesh words to phonetic spelling.  According to this Wikipedia
entry http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish_orthography the elimination of
sof-oysyes was a follow-up part of the same set of "reforms":

"The first action formally undertaken by a government was in the Soviet
Union in 1920, with the abolition of the separate etymological orthography
for words of Semitic origin. This was extended twelve years later with the
elimination of the five separate final-form consonants (as indicated in the
table below) which were, however, widely reintroduced in 1961. The changes
are both illustrated in the way the name of the author Sholem Aleichem is
written..."

Subject: scholtechteah?

I can't find the word "scholtechteah" in Weinreich or Harkavy. It must be
that I am spelling the word incorrectly.  I would appreciate the correct
spelling.  According to the second law of thermodynamics everything becomes
a scholtechteah eventually.

Thank you.

Subject: query about film about Jewish life in Lemberg

Some months ago there was a posting in Mendele that mentioned a film about
Jewish life in Lemberg between the wars.  When I posted a query asking for
more information, there was no reply.  Any ideas?

Subject: tatele

When I was very young, my mother used the affectionate diminutive "tatele"
as a substitute for my name. I've found others who also remember this and
are also puzzled. The word means little father. Why would a parent call her
child that? There must be a reason.

Thanks,
Rubin Feldstein

Subject: copyrights to "Yidishe kultur"

I am interested in reprinting Berl Mark's article on yizker books that was
included in the 1964 issue of the journal "Yidishe kultur." Does anyone
know who owns the copyrights to the journal?

Thanks for your help.

Subject: tshudak

I must have missed the original query, but yes tshudak (accent on the last
syllable) is a Russian word for an eccentric person. I don't know whether
it appears in other Slavic languages as well. Coincidentally(?), the word
tshudo means miracle.
