Subject: Poem for a Mendelnik, Janet Hadda

         For Yiddish it's December

I came upon this moving poem in the Jewish Women's Literary Annual (1994)
published by National Council of Jewish Women, New York Chapter.

December
by Sarah Traister-Moskovitz

For Yiddish it's December
There's no more oven hearth
The small fire sinks
and flames only in dreams
The rebbe who taught little children there
died with them together
on the other side Atlantic
in the great fires of hate

And here, our Yiddish drowned
in roaring waves and crash and flood
of mass culture

There is no cemetery for a language
only for each speaker
And every mouth becoming silent
takes with it a piece of world;
a client of the Yiddish street
a teacher's effort, a mother's song, a sister's comfort
a brother's help, and hundreds of untold stories, gifts ungiven
carved from thousand years of Yiddish history

When Latin died
she was sanctified in holy churches
There are no holy walls
to honor my Yiddish

Only lonely professors
carrying the burden
of millions of silent graves
as single alien guest
in Departments of German.

This poem is dedicated to Professor Janet Hadda who teaches Yiddish in
the German Dept. at U.C.L.A.

Subject: Warm invitation from Sholem-Aleykhem

Both Sholem-Aleykhem and J.H. Ravnitski were born in 1859.  Their
personalities were quite different.  Sholem-Aleykhem seems to have been
generally rather affable, even daring, brash and mischievously playful
while Ravnitski was known as a _shvayger_, a reserved, quiet, thoughtful
one.  His literary taste and judgment gained the deep respect of his
colleagues.  In 1892 these two began a brief collaboration, writing
critical essays in Hebrew under the rubric, Kevurat Soferim (Burying
Writers).  They used as pseudonyms the names of two obscure prophets
(Numbers 11:26-29), Eldad (Sholem-Aleykhem) and Medad (Ravnitski).  The
warmth of Sholem-Aleykhem's friendly feeling toward Ravnitski is
expressed in a letter published in Der Tog (New York) on October 28,
1923, page 8.  The latter is dated July 4, 1895, when he wrote in Yiddish
from his summer place in Boyarka (near Kiev) inviting Ravnitski to be his
guest there.

[my translation]

Why do you ask who told me you were going to Skvira?  After all, Paya and
Boni [mutual friends] were with us, visiting.  And about your claim that
it's difficult: the only obstacle is your agreement to get yourself to
just do it.  These days, the trip itself costs a pinch of snuff: four or
five rubles.  At our place you'd live like God in France.  Listen to
this: a separate little furnished room for you, a basin for morning
washing in fresh water from the Dnieper piped in from Kiev and a little
marble tub with a little pool for swimming; a garden with all kinds of
fruit: sour cherries, raspberries, sweet cherries; later in the season,
apples and pears; bergamot; magnificent, fragrant flowers; a stream with
fish and colored boats; music every evening in the woods at twilight;
free theater and concerts; all manner of newspapers and books; spring
chickens and roast ducklings; dairy goods (mainly from Tevye); dumplings,
blintzes.  The only thing missing: maskilim.  When clever sages of Kiev
ever do take a trip out here, they keep out of sight and soon rush home.
They can't stand this air.  All in all, I tell you, our place is a taste
of paradise.  You would be worse than an apostate if you don't snatch at
least a few days to drop in this summer.  It would be a sign of your
unworthiness.  Karasik [a maskil], assistant to the Jewish censor in
Kiev, has already, thank God, returned from Kharkov, but he remains the
same Karasik as ever.  I haven't received a single book from him.  This
coming Sunday, he and his whole household is coming to visit us for the
day.  If you're smart, you'll come, too.  All kinds of guests are
gathering at our place next Sunday: from Kiev, Berdichev, Vasilkov, and
from Warsaw. [End of translation]

The letter ended on an even more seductive note.  Ravnitski was a
36-year-old widower, and Sholem-Aleykhem mentioned an approaching visit
by an attractive woman who was then looking for a husband.  I can't help
wondering if this did not make Ravnitski, a rather independent type, a
bit anxious.  After all was said and done, he did not accept this fine
invitation at that time.  Summer life in Boyarka of the 1890s sounds
wonderful.

Note the mention of Tevye, a real milkman in Boyarka.  This letter was
written a couple of months before he wrote (or corresponded with editor
Mordecai Spector about) his very first Tevye story, Tevye der Milkhiker
(original title, later changed to Dos Groyse Gevins in 1903).
