April 1996

The Yiddish Discussion Group invites you to the second meeting in the series

         the older generation reminisces

The speaker will be actor and YIVO co-worker David Rogow. Last year, Mr. Rogow
performed in the Ivye Project, a mass spectacle in memory the Jews murdered in
the shtetl Ivye (White Russia).   He will show some video scenes of the
spectacle in the woods near Ivye where the monument stands.  There will follow
an opportunity to ask questions both about the Ivye Project and about Mr.
Rogow's reminiscences.

Thursday, April 25, 6:00 pm at YIVO, 555 West 57th Street, 11th floor (between
Amsterdam and West End Avenue), Manhattan.  (Take the #1/#9 train to 59th
Street or the M11 bus to 57th Street.)

           Refreshments will be served.

RSVP by April 24: Brukhe Lang (212) 280-1168.

We thank the YIVO staff for its help with the technical aspects  of this
Discussion, and for its permission to meet in the YIVO building.

Subject: New Israeli bill

First of all mazel tov to Leybl Botvinik and the many others who worked for
the Israeli bill that aims to preserve and promote yiddish. Anything of this
kind for yiddish can only be a good thing.

Now that the bill is passed could leybl perhaps give us an idea of the hurdles
he to jump before getting this far. How many doors were closed in his face and
how many calls were just hung up. After all the European Union has recognised
yiddish as being worthy of support and special recognition long before the
'Yiddishe' state believed it to be necessary.

I hope I do not sound overly cynical by assuming or even taking for granted
that somewhere in the bill, tucked away in an obscure clause in klayn oysiyes
are words, not explicitly, but to the effect that the bill is intended only
where the committee feels yiddish is in need in preservation. Where, however,
yiddish is found to be flourishing, spoken by big and small, rich and poor,
old and young, it would be deemed that preservation is inapropriate and thus
these communities would not be entitled to any of benefits of the bill.

Or am I just afflicted by a bout of pre-Paysekh pessimism?

Subject: Rav pninim

The discussion of the book of thkines, Rav pninim, moved me to look at my
copy, the Hebrew Publishing Company, 1916 edition.  The language is *very*
daitshmerish.  In addition to exta heh's and ayin's, it's got a lot of
very German vocabulary:  on the title page, 'mit fiele perushim', on the
table of contents 'inhalts-fertseikhnis', etc.  But it also has a lot of
purely Yiddish phonology, morphology and syntax, e.g., 'un ven ikh volt
shoyn gelebt toiz(e)nt yo(h)r' ), p. 163.  I think one could make an
interesting study of the ivri-taitsh language of this and other sforim.

Incidentally, in a surprisingly modern touch, the phrase 'eloyhey avoyseynu'
is translated in a gender-free form as 'got fun mayne elter(e)n.'

Subject: Du/ir

I think there are two things going on here.  One is that the US is a very
informal society, at least in terms of address.  Our president is Bill and his
oppenent is Bob.  In daily interaction, we frequently address someone we have
just met with his/her first name.  If we use du with people with whom we are
on a first-name basis, we would use du a lot more than, say, Yiddish speakers
in the UK.  The original question was whether that is in fact the case.

Second, English speakers who are learning Yiddish tend to be taught du first,
and it tends to stick even after they learn ir.  I have noticed the same
pattern with students learning French (including myself many years ago).
Having used vous for you, they have trouble using tu when it is appropriate.
Thus, there was a popular song years ago with the title, voulez-vous coucher
avec moi?  :-)

Ikh vuntsh ale mendelnikes a zisn un koshern pesakh.
