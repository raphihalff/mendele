Subject: Achron's "Stempenyu"

I was just last week leafing through the November issue of The Strad, a
British monthly devoted to violin connoisseurship and the culture of
fine string instruments, and was startled to see an advertisement for a
new CD by Israeli violinist Hagai Shaham entitled "Stempenyu:  The
violin music of Joseph Achron"; and then in Yiddish (NOT romanized),
_Stempenyu:  der fidl muzik fun Yosef Akhron_.  The inter-war-period
stylized Yiddish script stands out conspicuously in this magazine,
believe me.

The price given for the CD is eight pounds sterling, or twelve dollars
U.S., from:

Biddulph Recordings
34 - St George Street, Hanover Square,
London W1R OND, England.

The ad closes with the note, "This special offer for Strad readers which
includes p & p expires 31 December 1996."

As one looks closely at the Yiddish letters in the layout, one can see the
telltale serration of digital graphics -- absent from the English-language
typeface -- and one assumes that this was scanned from the 1932 sheet music
edition of Achron's "Stempenyu Suite."  I myself, the reader correctly
infers, have never seen this music, but that is the date of publication
given in Sendrey's still indispensable "Bibliography of Jewish Music."
Achron, a composer and violinist, was yet one more virtuoso to emerge from
the class of the legendary Leopold Auer at the St. Petersburg Conservatory.
Unlike many of his colleagues, however, he became involved early in the
St. Petersburg Society for Jewish Folk Music, and his "Hebrew Melody"
(1911), as it was widely known in the West, became immensely influential in
the "Modern Renaissance of Jewish Music," or so Albert Weisser calls the
early twentieth-century movement among Russian-born Jewish composers in his
book of the same name (1954; reprinted 1983).  Weisser says that Achron
originally wrote his incidental music to "Stempenyu" for a 1918 Petrograd
production by Alexander Granovsky -- presumably based on the adaptation
Sholem Aleichem had made a decade earlier of his seminal 1880s novel.
("Stempenyu," the book, tells of a klezmer fiddler of the same name; of his
kapelye whose members speak in lexicographically footnoted authentic
klezmer loshn; and of di yidishe tokhter Rokhele di sheyne, who resisted
seduction by the notorious fiddler.  The author famously dedicated his
"yidisher roman" to Mendele Moykher Sforim.)  Director Granovsky soon
thereafter founded the revolutionary Moscow State Yiddish Theater, where he
was eventually succeeded by the great Solomon Mikhoels.  Joseph Achron
settled in America in 1925, and died in Los Angeles in the 1940s.
(Granovsky and Sendrey both spent their final years in Hollywood as well,
for those Mendelistn who appreciate symmetry in their historical
narratives.)

Having said all this, I haven't received a copy of the CD yet, so I don't
know for sure what's on it, whether the Stempenyu music is from the
published version, or what other work by Achron is represented.  In short,
I don't know what I'm talking about, but hope to soon!  I have no
connection with The Strad or Biddulph Recordings.

Subject: When is one considered a Yiddishist?

In Mendele 6.152, Iosif Vaisman <iiv@mmlds1.pha.unc.edu> wrote:

     But, on a serious note, the classical definition of an Yiddishist
     was offered by Sholem Aleichem in "Kasrilevke progres" (chapter
     XII, "Idishistn un hebreistn"). There we learn that if one
     pronounces _mikhnosaim_ he (or she) is clearly an Yiddishist. But,
     if _mikhnataim_ is your choice, then sorry. The club is closed.

Since then I have received seven more issues of Mendele (not counting
Personals) containing not one reference to "_mikhnataim_." This
surprises me greatly because I can't believe Sholem Aleichem really
wrote this as posted.  By this definition there are _no_ Hebraists,
since there is no such word in Hebrew - the word for "pants" in Hebrew
is spelled with a samekh, not a tav.  Am I missing something here, or am
I the only one who posts to Mendele who knows any Modern Hebrew?

Re Sholem Aleykhem's use of miknosayim/mikhnatayim to distinguish
Yiddishits from Hebraists, it sounds like he was poking fun at the
pretentiousness of Hebraists using the "new" Sephardic pronunciation.
In reality, of course, the Hebrew word uses samekh, which is pronounced
[s] by members of all political parties.
