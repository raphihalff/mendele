Subject: Ishkabibel Domanickel

A patron at the Ohio State University Library asked at the Refernce desk
the source of the term "Ishkabibel Domanickel". A search at the OED
(Oxford English Dictionary) did not produce any result.

In a story by Haim Chertok, in the Jerusalem Post of April 2, 1993 "The
Six Questions", a Pessach story from the Bronx, it says:

	"All I need to break her up is to whisper 'Ishkabibel' under
	my breath."

Can someone on Mendele help us to find the source of the term? Is it
Yiddish? Are there any bibliographic refernces for this term?

A sheinem dank,

Subject: On another use of khaver

Recently there was some discussion on the uses of Reb and Khaver as an
address.  Some  have mentioned that Khaver  was used by the  left like
Comrade.  In  Israel it was  very common  among the socialists  to use
khaver as  the address preceding  the name (usually the  family name).
But  in Hebrew  the  word has  lots  of meanings  (e.g.  member of  an
organization) so that it has also non socialist uses.

I wish  to draw  attention to a  use of khaver  in Germany.   In shuls
sometime a person had  the title khaver given to him as  a sign of his
standing in  the community, especially  perhaps to his  frum behaviour
and ability to "learn".   From then one such a person  be called up to
the Torah: ya'amod hakhaver etc.  This is not really surprising as the
word  khaver was  sometimes used  in  our ancient  sources as  someone
trustworthy as  opposed to  the am  ha'aretz who  was not  reliable on
kashrut  matters.   Also in  the  Kusari  of  Yehuda Halevy,  the  man
representing the Jewish view is called hakhaver.

Subject: "Khaver" as an appellation

As a kid at Yiddish day school (I.L. Peretz Folk School in Winnipeg
during the fifties) we called all our teachers "khaver" and "khaverte".
It wasn't until years later that I realized this was a remnant of the
socialist leanings of the school and had political resonances
(khaver=tovarishch=comrade). Peretz School was founded three years before
the Russian Revolution and was originally called the Jewish Radical
School.  Over the years its ideology slowly faded (no doubt Stalin's
purges had something to do with it), though its rival in Winnipeg, the
Sholem Aleichem Shul, stayed doggedly pro-Moscow.

Only now in the nineties am I realizing that the men teachers were Khaver
+ Surname (Khaver Bronshteyn, Khaver Zolf) while the women teachers were
Khaverte + Given Name (Khaverte Pnina, etc.).  So much for ushering in
the egalitarian society.

Subject: Jewish folk art in Galicia

There is a fabulous exhibition  at Beth Hatefusoth (the Diaspora Museum)
on the campus of Tel Aviv University.

It is called "Rediscovered Treasures -- Judaica Collections foro Galicia,
from the Lvov Museum of Ethnography and Crafts" -- and has beautiful and
to me previously unknown samples of Jewish objects ranging from copper
bowls, tubs, and urns to shtern-tikhlekh and other religiously- and
ritually-associated fabric items , some manufactured only in Lvov before
the war.  Someone should bring this exhibition to the US!!!

This is of direct interest to Mendele readers, I hope -- because the
objects in this exhibition  make concrete and tangible many Yiddish words
that the dictionaries define but cannot evoke.

Subject: Learning YIddish as political act

In reply (belatedly) to Djulia Schere's  query re. learning Yiddish as a
political act -- have you read Irena Klepfisz's excellent article in
Bridges (Spring, 1994), "Di mames, dos loshn:  The Mothers, the Language;
Yiddish and the Politics of Memory" (This may not be the exact title).

Subject: Romanized Yiddish-English dictionary

In response to Yankle Gerger, there has been an excellent dictionary
available for a long time.  It is: The Yiddish Dictionary Sourcebook: A
Transliterated Guide to the Yiddish Language.  Authors are: Herman Galvin
and Stan Tamarkin (Ktav Publishing House, 1986)

Subject: Yiddish and the  North American Indian

Sheen Daixel wrote a book called _Indianishe Dertsaylungen_ (1959: New
York). In it he talks of his travels amongst the Apache, Sioux, Hopi, and
Navajo. If you are interested in such things - including actual Hopi
dialog transliterated into Yiddish, I recommend that you located a copy
of this fine book. He also wrote stories of his travels in Asia called,
as you might expect _Asiatishe Dertsaylungen_ (1924).
