Subject: Lith/Yiddish

Regarding the 'gloksne-beymer', Lith gluosnis 'willow' is probably right,
but curiously the multivolume Lith dictionary which loves to include all
variants, does NOT attest a variant with the 'k'.  BUT, sporadic 'k'
insertion before /s/ or /sh/ +

Cons IS a typical Baltic sound feature with many dialect and regional
varieties. Did the Jews in this village pick up an unattested
*gluoksnis/gloksnis from their Lithuanian neighbors, or is it a Yiddish
hyper-correction based on the frequency of the suffix?

Regarding saltes noses etc. Based on the form 'saltinosis', it looks
indeed like the source is Lithuanian shalta nosis, pl. shaltos nosys,
'cold nose', which would produce a compound shaltinosis.  I suspect the
sh > s is the local Yiddish sabslosn.  I wasn't able to check to see if
the compound is attested in Lith, and my Lith cookbook is packed away
somewhere in my book boxes, which I'm reluctant to unpack till the
aftershocks stop.

This discussion is interesting to me because it provides evidence that
many Lithuanian Jews really DID know at least some Lithuanian.  My
grandpa from Shakiai I always thought was unusual because it seems he did
know Lithuanian. The Lithuanians themselves who came from and remember
those villages often claim that THEY spoke Yiddish with the Jews, not
Lithuanian!

By the way, in the 70's a Jewish linguist published in Lithuanian in
Litva a book on the Lithuanian language influence in Lithuanian Yiddish.
I have a photocoppy, but still have not read it.

Subject: Tren

My ex-wife's family commonly used the word "tren" to mean sexual
intercourse. Since I had never heard the word in my family, I assumed it
was just a made-up word peculiar to my in-laws.

Years later, my thesis advisor, Dr. Arthur Shapiro, of dream research
fame, recounted to me that an instrument salesman trying to sell him a
5-digit voltmeter, explained variation in the fifth digit as being
"trend" information. I guess when I heard this I muttered under my
breath, "You were getting 'trenned' alright." When he laughed, I realized
that the word must have been more common than I thought.

Years later again, while sitting on the subway studying scientific
Russian for my qualifying exam, I came across the Russian for "friction",
"tren'eeyeh". I presume all the others in the subway car never figured
out why this fellow reading a scientific Russian text, suddenly burst
into uncontrollable laughter.

Subject: Re: Turkish Words in Yiddish

Don't forget "Pastrami", which comes from the Turkish "Pastirma" (must've
been a dyslexic Jew somewhere in the history of Jewish gastronomy).

Subject: Speak English!

Our former Dean of admissions, who was a practicing pediatrician in the
40's, related this story which he swears happened to him.

He was called to an apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn to attend to a
5-year old child with a fever. He characterized the "child" as a bulvan
who was desperately afraid of getting the shot of penicillin in his
tuchess. He said four family members held the kid down spread- eagle
while he administered the shot. After it was over, the kid jumped up,
flushed with anger, shook a finger at the doctor and shouted "Du shtick
drek!" The mother immediately gave the child a frask in punim and yelled
"Speak English!"

Subject: Brooklyn in Yiddish popular culture

As long as we're talking about Brooklyn in Yiddish literature, how about
Brooklyn in Yiddish popular culture?

Music-wise1924 saw Jacob Wasilkowsky's "Brownsville" (with it's immortal
line: "Chester Street is der bester street"!),  "Oyf un unter der
Boardwalk" by the prolific songwriting team of Peretz Sandler and Louis
Gilrod for the Aaron Lebedeff vehicle "Mendel in Yapon", and Morris
Karlinsky's "Brownsviller Bulgar" (which my band Kapelye is now recording
on our new CD). In 1932 Lipa Feingold wrote "Pitkin Avenue" an ode to
Brownsville's popular main drag.

Brooklyn was also represented on Yiddish radio. "Der Brownsviller Zeyde"
was one of the first Yiddish soap operas and aired in 1929 on WLTH. This
serial was written and directed by and starred Borukh Lumet, co-starring
his family including his youngest son, billed as "Sidnelle"!
