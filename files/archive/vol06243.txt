Subject: Ende oysiyes

am i the only one who is finding it hilarious that people seem to
think that the spelling reform in the early days of the ussr was
ordered from above? does anyone really think that there were non-jews
in the kremlin who (a) could read the hebrew alphabet and (b) gave a
damn how yiddish words were spelled?

or is it so upsetting that the reform came from jews, and from jews
who were among the most highly literate in yiddish nokh?

(btw, i have a copy of _kind on keyt_, a children's book by moyshe
nadir, published in ny in 1936 by the iwo, that follows the
fully-reformed orthography and that is a delight, both in form and
content.)

i for one think the full reform was a fine idea -- in fact, i'd say it
needs no explanation whatsoever, no more than the orthographic reform
that took place around the same time across much of europe (russia,
germany, spain, catalonia...). on the contrary, it's the convention
that the *right wing* adopted (and that survives today, at least
outside the ex-ussr) that needs explaining -- how religious fanaticism
intruding on a purely secular issue results in the failure to achieve
the desired logical spelling reform.

in case anyone is missing the illogic of the system, try this for an
analogy: imagine (predominantly roman catholic) austria spelling all
latin borrowings in german as if they were still latin words,
regardless of the fact that their sound, conjugation/declension, and
meaning were pure german...

Andrej Bredstein's thoughts are as always well expressed. I'll never
be able to stand the Soviet orthography, though, for the simple reason
of its exclusivity: if you already know how to read Loshn-Koydesh,
it's a pain to slog one's way through fun-with-Soviet-phonics.  If I
wanted to crack codes I would have applied to work for the CIA. On the
other hand, if one learns the Soviet system one has a really hard time
with the spellings used by 85% of the Yiddish-speaking world.  There
are, it's true, competing systems of Yiddish orthography elsewhere in
the world, but they're all mutually understandable, more or less.
Soviet spelling would work if everyone were to use it, but otherwise
it's a spanner in the works; spelling is not a matter of individual
choice, pace Mr. Bredstein, but a matter of utilitarianism--is the
spelling you're using good for everyone?

Subject: Soviet Yiddish books

The Bergelson I recently mentioned [6.238-40] was published in Moscow,
1961 by the melikhe farlag fin kinstlerisher literatur.

There was also a book of works by Sholem Aleichem (spelled vi noyekh
mit finef* grazen) in the same orthography, published in Moscow in
1936. Another book, was an illustrated 'Masoes Binyomin' by Mendele,
again in the Russian spelling system, published in Moscow in the 60's.
I am almost sure that I saw a Soviet edition of a Russian work but in
the regular spelling.

All this leaves one wondering of the involvement of Yiddishists in the
persecution of their own brethren when implementing these obscure
rules.

*nikhtev betsidoy: Pedantic mendelistn, of whom there are,
fortunately, not one too many, ready to fire off an epistle
complaining that the phrase should be 'noyekh mit zibn grazn', zoln
moykhl zan in osvartn a minit.

Two of the zibn grazn for noyekh are: Substituting the fist nin with
an ende nin and placing a regular khof to replace the erroneous last
khof. Ober az men hot avekgenimn ale ende oysiyes zenen farshvindn
gevorn tsvay grazn.

Tu, is ayner a baln optsivendn deym pshetl?

Subject: Spelling of Hebrew words in Yiddish

Regarding this discussion I would only like to mention that I have
found the spelling of Hebrew words, with vowels omitted, a real
obstacle in my halting efforts to read Yiddish.
