Subject: Fuks Yiddish Library in the Netherlands
 
I'd like to draw your attention to the existence of the Fuks Library in the
Provincial Library of Friesland in the city of Leeuwarden (Northern part of
the Netherlands). The Fuks Library contains many books on Yiddish language,
history and literature.

Here are some more details about the Fuks Library and its founder. Dr. Leo
(Lajb) Fuks was born in 1908 in Kalisz (Poland). From 1949 to 1973 he was 
conservator of the Bibliotheca Rosenthaliana in Amsterdam. He published 
various old Yiddish texts. From 1964 to 1971 he taught Modern Hebrew and
Yiddish at the University of Amsterdam. In 1969 Dr. Fuks founded the Jewish
Scientific Magazine Studia Rosenthaliana. Dr. Fuks died in 1990 in Harfsen
(Netherlands). 

Before he died he donated his own library to the Provincial Library of 
Friesland because of the the existence of the Franeker Library there. The 
Franeker Library contains many Hebrew books of Protestant theologists. By
doing so he also wanted to show his gratitude to the Frisian population for 
helping the Jews during the Second World War.

The Fuks Library contains more than 4000 titles (from 1485 to 1997) about the 
Hebrew and Yiddish language and literature; Jewish Religion, History and 
Philosophy. Besides, there are manuscripts (mostly in Hebrew and from the 
18th century) and Yiddish magazines like Di Goldene Kayt, Yedies fun Yivo, Di
Yidishe Gas, Afn Shvel, Yidishe Kultur YKUF, Bleter far Geshikhre, Parizer
Tsaytshrift, Sovyetish Heymland and more.

The Fuks Library has an online catalogue. But the books may not leave the 
Library. 

Few details about myself: I studied Semitic Languages and Culture at the 
University of Amsterdam. Since 1993 I work part time as the conservartor of
the Fuks Library and teach Hebrew and Jewish Culture at different institutes
in the Netherlands.   

Hope to see you at the Fuks Library!

Subject: Drimpln

I fear I cannot help Heynkeh Sapoznik very much, but for what it's worth...
My mother, a native Yiddish speaker whose parents were from Gomel/Homye
(now in Belarus), used "drimpln" for the piano when someone was playing
around idly, not really practicing or playing anything seriously.

Obviously his "drimpln" was more than that and has borne much fruit, judging
by his rendition of such Yiddish songs as "Shprayt zikh mir."

Subject: Joseph Green's movies

For a start, I'd suggest Raisins and Almonds, an excellent documentary on
Yiddish movies, originally produced for Britain's Channel 4 Television and
available on video through Ergo Media.  If I'm not mistaken, several actors
who appeared in Joseph Greene's movies are interviewed, as well as Joseph
Greene himself!

Subject: UYIP Draft Hebrew-Yiddish Keyboard

As many of you know, the UYIP mailing list was set up last year for discussion
of Yiddish Information Processing. In response to the need of several vendors,
especially Microsoft, to provide extensions to the modern Hebrew keyboard to
support Yiddish, I and others have been designing and discussing a proposed
new design for the Microsoft Hebrew keyboard.  

We would now like to invite Mendele list participants to comment on the
proposal.  To view the proposal, please use a web browser to visit the
following web page:
  http://world.std.com/~yv/uyip/keyboards.html

Your comments to me privately, on the UYIP list, or on Mendele are welcome.

For more information on the UYIP mailing list, please visit its web site:

Subject: drimplin
 
My parents from Skalat in then-Austria (near Lvov, nee Lemberg) used to say
rimplin in the same context Heynekh's tate-mame said drimplin. I remember a
wooden-fingered duo (pianist and fiddler) who performed at a "shul banket"
and mama whispered, "Oy, er rimplt un zi skripet. Lomir shoyn geyn aheym."
 
Rimplt is not in Weinreich either.
 
Could rimplin or drimplin be regional usages, or does memory dim
pronunciation?

Subject: _Lider fun dor tsu dor_ & the Arbeter-ring

If Chana and Yosl Mlotek's _Lider fun dor tsu dor_ is even half as good as
their previous Yiddish song books, then I'm sure it is truly wonderful and I
would consider myself fortunate indeed to own a copy. However, I think I
should warn Mendelyaner that, contrary to Chana & Yosl's assertion [7.041:4]
reiterated by Itsik Goldenberg [7.041:5] that the book may be obtained from
The Workman's Circle Book Center, the sad truth is that trying to get books
and tapes from the Arbeter-ring is like trying to get blood out of a stone,
if you try ordering by e-mail or fax, that is. I must concede that I don't
live in the United States, but where is it written that a US address is a
sine qua non for such transactions? Mendelyaner will remember that the
Workman's Circle organised a "Mendele sale" back in January. The books I
ordered and paid for by credit card eventually arrived, but my attempts to
order other items from their catalogue, notably _Lider fun dor tsu dor_ and
_YIVO-bleter_ (both ordered mid-March) have been completely abortive. All
subsequent attempts to contact the Arbeter-ring whether to enquire what is
happening or to place additional orders meet with stony silence, even though
I copy my e-mails by fax just in case something is wrong with their server
or whatever. They might just as well have gone out of business for all I can
tell. I have sent them a total of five e-mails since March, but have not had
a peep out of them since February.

Subject: Drimblen
 
_Drimblen_ seems to be an interesting word. Obviously cognate to Slavic
onomatopoeic _brenchat'_ (Russ), _bren'katy_ (Ukr), _brin^ceti_ (Czech), 
etc., it goes all the way to ancient Indian _bhrnga_ - "big black bee".
First "d" in the Yiddish word might be explained by analogy with Russian
regional variation _tren'kat'_. Interestingly, in older dictionaries
_tren'kat'_ was traced to Middle High German _drohnen_, but that relation 
was dismissed by later authorities (e.g. M.Vasmer, Russisches etymologisches
Worterbuch, 1953). Looks like a good material for Paul Wexler.
