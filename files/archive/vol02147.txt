Alas, even this isn't right. "emes" is feminine in
Hebrew, masculine in Yiddish. "rege" is masculine in
Hebrew, feminine in Y. And the abstract nouns that end
in -ut in H. tend to be neuter in Y. (but maybe that
depends on dialect?)

One factor is this: there's a strong tendency for
nouns ending in -e to be feminine in Y. This accounts
for a lot of the cases where Y & H agree (H has -ah, Y
has -e): menoyre, mishpokhe, etc.

But the -e doesn't have to be an ending: "rege" ends
in -e just because the final ayin has become silent,
but still the -e is probably the reason that the word
is feminine in Yiddish.

Subject: Gender of nouns; word meanings

David Sherman: The donor language DOES NOT determine
the gender of borrowed nouns in Yiddish; NOT even
Hebrew! To wit:: Yiddish "der shabes", "dos ponim!".
Actually, many Hebrew nouns were originally classified
as neuters: dos mes, dos seyfer. The determining
factors are, probably often, Formal and/or semantic".
There is a bibliography on the subject.
 
Dvosye: In working with early Yiddish texts, a good
German dictionary is useful (in the absence of a
historical Yiddish one). So, go directly to a good
German dictionary, do not pass "Go" or collect $200
and look up "ko(umlaut)stlich". And, zay gezunt.

Subject: Gender of borrowed words

dave sherman asks whether yiddish words borrowed from
other languages keep their original gender and vice
versa--

i don't know of any systematic study but i'd guess that
the answer is: sometimes. given that even native yiddish
words sometimes have different genders in different dialects
of yiddish and that northeastern yiddish has no neuter, it
would be extraordinary if all borrowed words always kept
their original gender. one example that i know of that
clearly doesn't keep its gender is shap 'workshop', masculine
in yiddish but neuter in its original language, english.
perhaps there are phonological and/or semantic reasons for
the genders they wind up with, when it differs from the
original one.

as for yiddish words borrowed into other languages,
clearly it depends on the other language's gender system.
english, for example, has natural gender, while yiddish
has grammatical gender. therefore a word like meydl will
be feminine in english (neuter in non-NEY yiddish), yingl
will be masculine (neuter in non-NEY yiddish), shmate
will be neuter (feminine in yiddish), and pupik will be
neuter (masculine in yiddish).

this sort of gender variation is not at all unusual, by
the way. (english opera is neuter singular, french opera
is feminine singular, latin opera is neuter plural--the
plural of opus, which went its own way in languages that
borrowed it, for example.)

Oh, please don't attribute anything to the way I spell
my name. I don't have a Yiddish name, you see, since
my parents never spoke Yiddish.  I have the Hebrew
name I was given at my bris, which I always spelled
Daniel Moshe.  I guess I'm slowly yiddishizing the
spelling.  To his credit, Melekh Viswanath immediately
switched to meylekh when someone pointed out the
inconsistency in his orthography.  Maybe I'll do the
same someday, but somehow doniyel looks awfully weird. 
Names are such subjective things, after all.

Subject: Here's the problem

	"Po kavur hakelev" is a Hebrew phrase which
translates to "the dog is buried here," but means
"this is the source of the problem".  The phrase was
made popular in Israel by a Hebrew song about twenty
years ago, but the Even-Shoshan Hebrew dictionary
lists the source as a folk-'mashal', in Yiddish.

	Does anyone in Mendel-velt know of this?  Is
there a story involved? Or a known zaftig translation?
