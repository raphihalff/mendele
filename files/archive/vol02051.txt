 I believe that Loshn Koydesh refers to Biblical
Hebrew/Aramaic, not to spoken Hebrew, nor to Yiddish.  In
my home, loshn koydesh was also used to indicate "the
official word."

Subject: Lachoudisch

I finally located the reference to the book on Jewish
expressions in German that I mentioned at first.  It is
MASSEMATTE: DAS LEBEN UND DIE SPRACHE DER MENSCHEN IN
MUENSTERS VERGESSENEN VIERTELN, by Margret Strunge and Karl
Kassenbrock (Muenster, published by the authors, 1980).  As
far as I remember, it is a fairly serious description of
the language as it's used nowadays by non-Jews in Muenster,
and respectful of its Jewish origin.  "Massematte" is what
the Muensterites call their slang -- and I think (i.e.
guess) it is from Hebrew "massa u-mattan" 'take and give',
i.e. 'negotiations' or 'business'. That's probably what
gave me my idea that the word "Lachoudisch" had a similar
meaning.  Anyway, the derivation of the word Lachoudisch
from loshen hakodesh (maybe with a bit of "lakhn" misched
in?), suggested by Yitzhak Kertesz and Mikhl Herzog, sounds
plausible to me.

Apparently I knew the word Lachoudisch not from that book
but from an article in the New York Times, Feb. 10, 1984,
p. A2, "Dialect of Lost Jews Lingers in a Bavarian Town",
one of the journalistic "discoveries" Mikhl Herzog
mentioned.

Boo to you Zachary Taylor and yaasher koach to the shames.
The wonderful piece about Montreal put me in such a good
mood until I encountered the hurtful "(ugh) ptsha".  All
the more painful as, despite my every effort, it is
esentially impossible to acquire the essential ingredient
for that great treat of my childhood. At least in the State
of Illinois it is illegal to sell the appropriate portion
of a steer. It is a great tribute to the level of culture
of Canada that it is still possible to prepare ptsha. Maybe
someone can send me a care package?

Subject: Galitsyaner
 
Bob Werman, are you sure that Dzhigan and Shumakher were
Galitsyaner? I thought they were from Lodz--tif poylish,
for sure. Part of the stereo among Litvakes has been that
anyone who says "gayn" and "shtayn" (rather "geyn" and
"shteyn") is a Galitsyaner. 'I just didn't know about
D & S.

Subject: 1. Dybbuk video;  2. Gender of *kop*

1.  A couple of weeks ago (2.33), I solicited information
on the quality of the videos of the Yiddish film of *The
Dybbuk* (Warsaw, 1937) offered by Ergo Home Video, the
Workmen's Circle, and the Brandeis National Center for
Jewish Film. I have now had the opportunity to compare
Ergo's ($44 including shipping & handling) with NCJF's
($93).  No contest:  the latter is a first-rate
restoration, whereas the former (better than nothing, to be
sure) appears to have been made from a poor print.  I have
not viewed the WC product (ca $55).

2.  Can *kop* (head) have any gender except masculine?  I
once wrote to Michael Lerner, taking him to task for
quoting (NOT using) the expression *goyishe kop* in a piece
in Tikkun.  Because I thought I had never seen the noun
used as anything but masculine, I argued that he should
have written *goyisher kop*.  But I notice that #10 in
Olsvanger's *Royte Pomerantsn" (cited by Ellen Prince
recently) has "Goyishe kop!"  No dictionary I have
consulted (Weinreich, Harkavy, Harduf) has anything but
masculine for *kop*, but I know that there are occasional
regional variants in gender for some nouns.  So ...  Do I
owe Lerner an apology?  Can the Olsvanger story have a
misprint?  Have I fallen victim to my own pedantry?  Or
what?
