Does anyone know anything about (heh) the Mt. Holyoke
Yiddish Camp? Is it over already? Is there time to enroll?

Subject: A bakoshe and an introduction

Dear Ellen Prince, please send me your material on Menashe
Skulnick. I feel on the verge of making my brother Ira very
happy by sharing it with him.

I've been tuned in to MENDELE for some weeks but this is my
first note. I was born in Manhattan, grew up on West
Burnside Avenue in The Bronx, went to Hunter from 7th grade
through B.A.  My parents spoke Yiddish for privacy until
the kids caught on, then switched to Russian but froze that
in the Cold War--I still consider it my "lost language" and
delight in hearing it at work (in same building as Slavic
Department).  In 1986 through the Weinreich Summer Program
of YIVO I studied at Columbia and became literate in
Yiddish--what a thrill!  I went to elementary, inter-
mediate, and advanced classes, understood everything, a
velt fun yiddish. Leonard Wolf was teaching translation; I
actually published a translation of an A. M. Orzycer story
in Queens College journal YIDDISH.  (Most of my translation
though is of Italian fiction by women.)  MENDELE is like my
daily vitamin tablet now.

Greetings too to other friends whose names have crossed my
screen--and I blow a kiss to you, Dovid Braun!

Subject: Mickey Katz

As a Yiddish vocalist, klezmer musician, and host of
Portland's only Jewish radio program, I feel honor-bound to
reply to the reflections on Mickey Katz in vol. 2 no. 24.
First off, family details:  yes, he was the father of Joel
Grey.  Also, the grandfather of Jennifer Grey ("Dirty
Dancing").

More importantly, Mickey Katz was one of the more inventive
free spirits that the American Jewish community spawned
during the mid-20th century. Mickey Katz reflected the
spirit of his times perfectly; with one foot in the old
country and the other foot in the new, he echoed the
cultural ambivalence of many Yiddish-speaking Americans who
weren't "legitimate" (fully assimilated) Americans but
weren't Eastern European Jews anymore, either.

As a clarinetist, Mickey Katz may not have been a Dave
Tarras or Naftule Brandwein, but he was no slouch;  it's a
little-known footnote, but Mickey was with the Spike Jones
orchestra after the war.  I'm sure that his years with that
group pushed him closer to the edge as a lyricist (some
would say that they pushed him all the way over the edge),
but he also built a klezmer band that needs apologize to no
one.  While his group rarely displayed the kind of
virtuosity that impresses classical listeners, they always
played the tunes right, with feeling and with musicianship.
After 40-odd years, the records stand up extremely well
against the other Yiddish stuff recorded in that era.
Granted, many of the lyrics are dated, but not nearly as
badly as some of the 1960s Jewish humor that followed
("When You're In Love, the Whole World Is Jewish";
"2000-Year-Old Man"; etc.).  And a large part of the reason
that they seem dated is that so few of us understand the
Yiddish these days.

One other point worth mentioning.  As a Jewish humorist in
the years immediately following World War II, Mickey Katz
fulfilled an essential and extremely difficult role:  he
helped Jews learn to laugh again.  No small feat, and I
can't think of a format that would have done the job
better.

So, did Mickey Katz "measure up"?  The answer depends upon
what you're measuring him against.  He influenced an entire
generation of young musicians who resuscitated the dying
art of klezmer music in the late 70s and early 80s.  Judy
Bressler (Klezmer Conservatory Band), Wendy Marcus
(Mazeltones), and a number of other vocalists have recorded
his material. More significantly, the great clarinetist Don
Byron revived Mickey's repertoire in the jazz festival that
Henry Breitrose cites.  That concert received much
publicity a couple of years ago in the New York Times, on
National Public Radio, and elsewhere.  Some of the
publicity served as a retrospective on Mickey Katz.  Some
of it focused on the remarkable work that Don Byron has
done on his instrument, surging from klezmer to avant-
garde and back again.  All of it pointed out the magic of
Byron's collaboration with Joel Grey, Mickey Katz's son,
finally free to perform his father's musical numbers.

You might want to read Katz's autobiography, which
Professor Breitrose mentions.  It's not a terribly
well-written or engaging book, but it does provide a lot of
details, along with photographs of Mickey and his wife in
the 70s.  (Now, there's something I wish that I could
forget.) I had the good fortune to get Joel Grey to
autograph the book when he was in town with a revival of
"Cabaret" a couple of years ago.

In remembering Mickey Katz and taking stock of his
contribution, let's also recall that most Yiddish theater
in the first decades of this century was regarded as
"shund" (trash) and was rudely dismissed by the defenders
of high culture.  So what?  Much of the Yiddish vocal
repertoire that has survived to date stems from that
tradition of shund.

The next time you listen to a klezmer band at your friend's
wedding or at your granddaughter's bat mitzvah, say a quiet
thank you to Mickey Katz for having inspired us all to
rediscover this delightful music.

   We'll sing auld lang syne, and drink a glezele vayn,
   With a toyst "lekhayim" to Uncle Hoymen
   We'll sit cheek to cheek, while I steal epes a peek
   And take from you a bisl afikoymen!!
