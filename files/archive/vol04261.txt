Subject: Etiquette/ splitting the list

1.  Some of the entries on Mendele which are sent in as responses to
articles already "published" on Mendele are rude and insensitive to the
writer--at least as they read on my computer terminal--in a way that I
believe is inappropriate.  I believe that frank and open disagreement is
healthy and important in many relationships.  Clearly in an environment
such as Mendele which is geared towards encouraging dialogue and
interaction about academic "things- Yiddish"  disagreement is paramount.
However,  there is a certain etiquette, and frankly a respect for other
Mendelniks, which should, I think, be strived for. I think that we need
each be our own judge--I'm  not suggesting an editor's censorship, but,
could we not take some steps toward polite criticism?  We do not all
agree on issues and we have not all been part of Mendele since its
inception, and yet we can easily be respectful of one anothers ideas and
feelings.  (Imagine reading the responses you send as if they were sent
your way!)

2.  I was interested in Patty Becker's suggestion about splitting this
list.  I am not certain that it is an ideal idea, but I think it was
misread by some respondents and dismissed too quickly.  The "stuff"
behind the suggestion, the comment that often Mendele is "too" technical
and uninteresting to larger parts of the Mendele readership is important
to discuss.  I too have often read through Mendeles and quickly deleted
because they are only linguistics and questions of pronounciation or
transliteration; these are issues which I find interesting in moderation,
or when I have lots of free time.  Not all other issues, though, need be
relegated to a "Jewish list" as has been suggested. There are many
"technical" or academically intereting aspects to the field of "Yiddish
studies".  There are many cultural/literary/historical/political things
to discuss. On a couple of occassions I have spoken with other
Mendelniks who are largely onlookers and not participants because they
are not linguists and they don't care to read such "technical" linguistic
stuff.  The solution, though, is probably not to split the list.   There
is actually little to split!  How often, besides the introductions and
occasional entries, do we read other "non-linguistic" stuff.?  Not often.

I remember a time when I was in college and the student newspaper was
hideously written and remarkably biased politically. I complained to a
professor/mentor of mine.  Do you know what she said?  "Join the paper
and write!" I think her suggestion was wise. Consider this (too long)
entry then both a call to others out there in Mendele who could benefit
from some lit. or hist. or politics or culture and a pledge.   I think
what we need to do is write.  Get involved.  I promise to respond to what
I can and to write what I can. I am teaching a Yiddish lit. course in
translation (English) this coming semester.  I will use it as a stepping
stone for interesting entries.

Hey! That brings up another area we could deservedly discuss: the
teaching of Yiddish.

Daniella HarPaz

P.S.  Since I see a Mendele tendency toward sensitivity on certain issues
I want it clear that I believe linguistics to be a highly worthwhile and
important science.

Subject: Divide the list? Kholile!

Here's one vote for _not_ dividing up the list.  The world of Yiddish is
small enough as is.  How will those of us who have both plebeian and
esoteric interests know to which list to send our messages?  (Either-or?
Both?)  Dividing the list, in my opinion, is a recipe for both confusion
and entropy.

Mendele is an exemplary list.  The medium is by its very nature
participatory, which means that it is up to Mendelnikes to make it what
it is.  Too nit-picky grammatical?  Well, send in a message about
literature, or your local cultural scene, or some other topic.  But don't
sit back, waiting for the linguistic discussions to cease, because those
will always be there.

Frankly, I'm amazed at the sort of discussions one sees on Mendele. Where
else would a beginner be able to have a dialogue with the former editor
of a Lithuanian Yiddish daily?  I could go on, but I think that faithful
readers know that we've (thanks in large part to our Shames) got a good
thing going.  Why fritter it away?

Subject: No splitting

I get a great deal of pleasure from reading the linguistic stuff as I do
all the other anecdotal material. As far as mailing lists goes, mendele
is one of the best. Don't split!

Can we afford to waste solar energy?

Subject: A vote for _not_ splitting.

I agree with Patty Becker (4.256) that Mendele ought to be a vehicle for
Yiddish culture.  Where I _might_ disagree is the implication (if I
understand correctly) that academics is _not_ relevant.  The sciences of
linguistics and history are not digressions from Yiddish culture.  They
have contributed much to discovery and preservation of Yiddish culture
for us and future generations.  Tsu di hoykh geshetste akademikers:
yasher koyekh!  Zoln zey tsugebn visnshaft vos zey gefunen far neytik.
Mir veln leyenen un lernen.

Concentrated academic work in highly specialized circles isolated from
non-academic distraction is a powerful instrument for discoveries and
insights unreachable by ordinary means.  Unrelievedly narrow
specialization, however, may result eventually in sterile aridity.

Any academic Yiddish landscape needs as well the juices of Yiddish used
in kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, and in social and intellectual
interactions; the Yiddish of the streets, the shops, the marketplace,
newspapers, books, debates, humor.  Un ver ken zogn az di dozike zakhn un
inyonim af a nit-akademikn grunt zenen nit erntste un vikhtike?  We
cannot do without the immediacy of non-academic discussions, and we
cannot do without the mediation of scientists.

I suspect splitting would yield two deadened lists, whatever each would
turn out to be.  I appreciate the academic history of the list, but I'd
bet on the notion that lists, like species, evolve or die.  Variety makes
for cross-fertilization of ideas and liveliness.  On the other hand, who
knows what ill-advised stuff comes across the shames's computer screen
from time to time, giving pause, and probably making him act as judge and
gatekeeper?  That split, the wheat from the chaff, is healthy.
