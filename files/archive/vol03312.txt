Subject: Daytchmerism & "standard Yiddish"

Re migldik and the issue of "standard Yiddish" :  I can understand the
need to standardize if one wants to create a formal grammar and
literature. I also understand the aversion to Germanic forms when one
wants to create a more sophisticated vocabulary than what was available
in proste mameloshen. I mainly object to the artificiality of the
contortions that some people have gone through to avoid the readily
available mameloshen term merely because they perceive it to be too close
to German. But if you are too arbitrary and unrealistic what you will
create will be a useless quixotic Esperanto which only some obscure
academics might concern themselves with. It will not become a living
language.

It is true that at the beginning of this century Yiddish was threatened
to be swallowed up by the onslaght of daytchmerisms. But the real blow to
Yiddish that the Germans administered was done by gas chambers rather
than by daytchmerisms. The present threat to Yiddish I find to be the
growing influx of Hebrew based words. I believe that this can be
documented by observing the shift in vocabulary from a 1940 issue of
Forvets to a present one. If this is a natural evolution of the living
language,so be it. But let us not mount the wrong ramparts if our concern
is to preserve what's left of the language. Despite Meylekh's noble
efforts ikh gleyb az migldik blaybt ekldik.

Subject: Mountain Jews of the Caucasus

Does anyone on Mendele have any leads, ideas, knowledge or
bibliographical pointers on the language of the Mountain Jews of the
Caucasus - esp. from a [socio]linguistic perspective?

A sheynem dank,

Subject: Introduction

A lapsed Yiddishist, I would like to return to the fold. For the record,
Yiddish was my first tongue and, though I have had little opportunity to
use it in the last fifty years or so, I am still very committed to its
preservation and good health.

Subject: Writer from Khust

The last few days have been a real tumult, and in the fray I lost a piece
of mail directed to me about a Holocaust memoir written by a man from
Khust, which is in Transcarpathian Ruthenia (I never know what to call
that area). The author's name is "M.A. Stern" (verso of title page) and
on the title page it is given in Hebrew letters as Moyshe Ari' Shtern.
The book looks like it was privately printed, and there's no date. The
title is: Dos kol fun blut: a megile fun yomer un shoyder--

Subject: More on archives

Now that Bob Rothstein has done the hard work in putting together the
table of contents for the last 3 years, it would be a pity not to keep
said table up to date.  Accordingly I'll try to update it once a week.
It will be appended to CONTENTS.V3 and as already noted be available
via anonymous ftp.

I forgot to mention (because I had not yet tried it) that in addition to
anonymous ftp all back numbers are available via gopher.  Type "gopher
gopher.cic.net".  The menu choices for Mendele are: 2, 3, 13, 14.  A "/"
will bring up the number you're interested in.  Very neat.  Even those
who like your shames loathe menus can learn to live with this piece of
software.

My shutef Victor Bers is the one who discovered this gopher.  We are
grateful to the anonymous lamed-vovnik who made it possible.

A gutn Shabbes aykh.
