Subject: Reflexives/Dem milners trern

Yankel Lantz (Mendele 2:130):  Jan Bart's pronunciation of
*yorn/yurn* ("years") may have thrown you off.  In the song
*Dem milners trern*, the recurrent lines are

	Di reder dreyen zikh,
	Di yorn geyen zikh,
	Ikh bin shoyn alt un grayz un gro.

So it's not Jews who go, or pass, it's years.  The song is
by Mark M. Warshawsky (*Afn pripetshik* is also his), and
is included in *Mir trogn a gezang* ("The new book of
Yiddish songs"), edited by E.G. Mlotek and published by the
Workmen's Circle.

But the use of reflexives in Yiddish IS interesting, so
interesting that there is no doubt a scholarly literature
on the topic.  My own favorite: Nu, vos hert zikh?

First, listen again: I bet he's saying "yurn" (for
klal-shprakh "yorn", 'years').  At least that's the way it
goes in the versions of "Dem milners trern" that I've seen.

As for the "reflexive": it's a fairly common colloquial
construction. It isn't a normal reflexive, of course.  My
understanding is that in some cases it contributes a sense
of casualness: compare the line "Gey zikh nokh a por mol
iber" in "Reyzele".

But I don't really understand what it contributes in "di
yorn geyen zikh". It sounds funny to me without the "zikh",
but that might just be because of familiarity with the
song.

I'd appreciate other peoples opinion on this: does it sound
alright to say "di yorn geyen" instead of "di yorn geyen
zikh". Does it mean something different?

Beginnings
 
To mark the beginning of the/their new year, and in
response to the high earnestness of the conference season,
I'd like to propose a diversion of the sort some of us once
played as graduate students. Specifically, I'd like to
suggest that as many of us as find the idea appealing post
their favorite--or, alternatively, least
favorite--beginnings of Yiddish literary works, sans
attribution. Others could cite the sources, post
counter-candidates for canonization on MENDELE, or complain
about the waste of bandwith.

Subject: Re: emet/emes

To Sigrid Peterson:

    Perhaps a better Hebraist than I will answer your
question.  In the meantime let me try. In spite of its
superficial appearance with the Massoretic pointing, 'emet
is apparently not a segolate noun. The segol under the
'alef is a so-called khatef segol ("fleeting segol") that,
were 'alef not a letter representing one of the "guttural"
consonants,would be a schewa. This spelling, then, stands
for a normal noun with the stress on the last syllable,
and so we hear it even in modern Israeli Hebrew. As for
the stress on the first syllable in the haftara bnlessing
mentioned by Peterson, I wonder whether it is not
something dictated by the customary chant, at least in
some Jewish traditions. That is, it is governed by the
rhythm.
