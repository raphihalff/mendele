Subject: farkratet/a shit mit 'brokhes'

Can anyone tell me the meaning of farkratet (or, farkrotet - the aleph in
my text is lacking a vowel point)?  It occurs in a description of the jail
in the town of Goworowo in northeast Poland: "Dos iz geven aza min gebeyde
fun holts mit a farkratet fensterl, vos dort hot men arayngezetst a
fardekhtikn in a farbrekh, oder far epes a shtrof."

In the description of an elderly man in the Polish town of Goworowo who was
once energetic and who could still manage even now to dominate people,
there occurs the idiom "a 'shit' mit 'brokhes'." Can anyone explain what it
means?

Context:
er hot nokh gekont gebn a "shit" mit "brokhes", az men zol nisht visn vu a
tir efnt zikh.

Subject: Rosetta Stone in Yiddish?

A previous post suggested that Rosetta Stone, one of the wealthiest
provider of language courses, would only do a Yiddish language edition if
some organization sponsored the project and checked the translations.  This
expense is the responsibility of the publisher. If they suggested this,
they are asking you to cover the expenses for the book.

RS uses the identical template for all of its languages. The exact same
cookie-cutter form for French is used for Hebrew and Chinese. Ironically,
the Chinese edition never mentions tones without which one cannot be
understood in Chinese.

I wouldn't pick RS if I wanted to teach Yiddish.

Subject: bartyarn

The word about which Viola Hoell is inquiring [17.017.8] is simply a
Yiddishized adaptation of the Polish word 'batiar'/ 'baciar' meaning
'street-urchin.'

Subject: bartyarn

In 17.017 Viola Hoell asked about the term "bartyarn" that occurs in a
1939 film about Jewish life in Lwow. The term should probably be "batyarn,"
from Lwow Polish "batiar" - "street urchin," "gamin," often with a very
positive emotional coloring as "citizen of the streets." It could also be
used negatively in the sense of "wise-guy" or "hooligan."  It comes from
Hungarian "betyar" - "tramp," "vagabond," "vagrant."

Subject: Yiddish names for plants

According to Mordkhe Shekhter's book,

Horn poppy = ho'rnmon
Gold poppy = mo'nrendl
Poppy = mon
California poppy = kalifo'rnyer mo'nrendl
Asia poppy = reme'rye
Corn flower = bloko'rn-shve'sterl
Coltsfoot = po'dbyal
Box elder = amerika'ner klyon
Elder = boz, buzi'ne

Subject:  Yiddish names for plants

The best place to consult Yiddish terms for plants is the book written by
my father, Mordkhe Schaechter, called "Plant Names In Yiddish: A Handbook
of Botanical Terminology" (in paperback). You can order it from
www.leagueforyiddish.org/publications.

As for the "refue" for parkh, I know someone who knows a good deal about
Jewish folk remedies. You can email me at rukhls@gmail.com to get his
contact info.

Subject:  Spelling on gravestones

Yosl is a Yiddish name and that's why it's spelled in Yiddish, as are the
names Gitl and Feyge. But Avrum is a Hebrew name and needs to be spelled in
Hebrew, even though it has a Yiddish pronunciation.

Subject:  plant and remedy names/spelling on gravestone

1) According to Mordkhe Schaechter's "Di geviksn-velt in yidish" (YIVO,
2005), cornflower (Centaurea cyanus) is "(blo) korn-shvesterl" and
coltsfoot (Tussilago) is "podbyal"; common coltsfoot (Tussilago farfara) is
"muter-shtifmuter."

There is no listing for yellow poppies, but poppy (Papaver) is, of course,
"mon" and Asia poppy (Roemeria) is "remerye"; there is no listing for horse
elder, but elder (Sambucus) is "buzine" or "boz."

2) I'm sure the spelling of "Avrum" would have been loshn-koydesh, since
that spelling is pronounced /avrum/ in Yiddish - no need to transcribe it
phonetically. "Yosl," having a different morphological structure from its
loshn-koydesh, cannot be spelled the same way as "Yoysef," so the two
examples given are not quite analogous.

Subject: "Yidvokans"

The Soviet-period choral group "Evokans" (Jewish vocal ensemble) was known
in Yiddish as "Yidvokans."

But what was its full name in Yiddish? Was it "yidisher vokal-ansambl"?
"Yidisher vokalisher ansambl"? Something else? Can someone provide it?

Thanks! Private replies to <eisenbak@stthom.edu> will be fastest, I think.
