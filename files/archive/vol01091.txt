The   pair "fisnoge" = 'feet' vs "fisribe" = 'fish' is
definitely a Litvish dev ice for disambiguating the
homonyms that result from the merger of "s" & "sh". The
merger of "oy" and "ey" (i.e., "voynen" 'to live' =
"veynen" 'to cry') also yields a device to disambiguate the
resulting "veynen": Litvish "avu freyt ir zikh?" I.e.
"Where do you rejoice = live"? to avoid "Avu veynt ir?"
Such fun!

Subject: RE: Ingberlach, etc. (1.90)

Regarding Sheldon Benjamin's posting on ingberlach -- a
friend in Baltimore makes them as a Pesach treat, exactly
as he describes them.  They are seasoned with ginger (hence
the name), and require a dry environment to retain their
shape as discrete pieces -- high humidity causes them to
fuse together into an inseparable mass.  Unfortunately, my
dental work no longer allows me to partake -- just LOOKING
at them makes my fillings come loose!
 
My late wife also used to bake challa with a ladder on top,
as did her late mother, but I don't recall any correlation
with any particular holiday or occasion.

An afterword on hayratn.When I sent my message on this
little argument, I no longer had the original exchange in
front of me. I don't think Khaver Mikhl Herzog was replying
to any proposal that Germanic and Semitic are related.
Rather, the question was whether harey at in the Jewish
wedding ceremony could underlie the Yiddish word hayratn.
My intent was to furnish a couple of Germanic roots that
the boys and girls who work on Germanic languages and their
forebear, Indo-European, have reconstructed from extensive
comparative studies. I myself am not an authority in these
matters. Anyway, the suggested etymology with harey at is
sprobably no more thatn a folk etymology with no
substantive foundation.        Aren
