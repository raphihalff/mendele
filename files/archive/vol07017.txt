Subject: Yiddish Idiomatic Expressions

        Perets Mett (7.012,2) is correct in his critique of the recent post
in (romanized) Yiddish about the visit of the kalever rebe in Budapest.

        He specifically criticizes the poster's use of the verb "gegebn"
[gave] to special khasidic affairs such as "gegebn tish" [table] and "gegebn
droshe" [sermon].

        According to Mr. Mett these should properly be described in Yiddish
as _gefirt_ or _gepravet_ a tish, and _gehaltn_ or _gezogt_ a droshe, and in
neither case "gegebn."

        It is possible, that "gegebn", as used in the post, was a direct
translation into Yiddish from another language.  If, for instance, it was a
translation from English "he gave (gegebn) a speech."  But, I ask you, is
speech a droshe?...

        Certain idiomatic expressions, in Yiddish as well as certainly in
other languages, are fixed and unchangeable   The words go hand-in-hand, so
to speak, and are inseparable lest they lose their authentic message and
ta'am [flavor].

        Take, for instance the Yiddish expression _es vet im nemen a yor mit
a mitvokh_ [it will take him one year and a Wednesday], to exaggerate
someone's habitual slowness in accomplishing something or finishing finally a
job started quite some time ago.  Or even more biting  "... a yor mit a
smitshik [one year and a bow of a string instrument], as if a smitshik is,
timewise, even longer than a Wednesday... 

        One could not change the day in this expression, for example, to "a
yor mit a donershtik" [one year and a Thursday].   The special irony would be
lost and would make no sense whatsoever.

        Idiomatic expressions are essentially nontranslatable, and one must
learn and gain almost an intimate familiarity with their special meaning(s)
before using them.

Subject: Yiddish Education in Toronto

I am pleased to be able to report, on behalf of the Yiddish Education 
Committee of the Committee for Yiddish of the Jewish Federation of 
Greater Toronto, the receipt of a grant from the Endowment Fund of the 
United Jewish Appeal.
     
For a number of years we have been doggedly building (rebuilding?) the 
infrastructure of Yiddish education in Toronto.
     
Last year we suffered a setback when we had to suspend the Yiddish 
high school course which was offered in cooperation with the City of 
North York Board of Education.  Unfortunately, CHAT, the single Jewish 
community high school in Toronto flatly rejected our request to accept 
the course, part of the General Studies program, together with 
financial support for the teacher's salary that was being offered by 
the Board of Education into the school's program.  
     
Yiddish is not offered in the Jewish Studies Program at CHAT.
     
The financial support to continue the course had been offered due to 
the efforts of a Board trustee, Elsa Chandler, herself a survivor of 
the Holocaust, and someone who understood clearly the place of Yiddish 
in the Jewish cultural mosaic. It was also due to the efforts of the 
administration of the Board who had gone out of their way to 
facilitate Yiddish. Of particular help, had been Gloria Howard, the 
principal of the continuing education program at the high school where 
Yiddish had been taught.
     
However, CHAT did provide a room after school later in this school 
year where 5 students studied Yiddish, with a teacher we supplied, and 
on their own time, and without a credit at the end of it, because they 
thought that it was worth doing so.  
     
We hope to continue to address the unmet needs of the students at the 
Jewish community high school for Yiddish in their Jewish Studies 
Program as time goes on.
     
We are thrilled with the grant of $25,000 as it will go far to help 
stabilize work in providing a framework for the growing interest in 
Yiddish.  Furthermore, it reflects the confidence of the Jewish 
Community in our efforts to re-establish the  place of Yiddish as a 
vital part of our cultural heritage and cultural future.

Subject: Translation once again

Thanks to Louis Frihandler, who exemplifies the best learning/teaching 
spirit of Mendele.

Translation is a problem, as we all know, and it would be ideal if we could
all read everything ever written in the original.  But such is not the case.
 
We have two choices:  we can either resolve never to read anything unless we
are able to read and understand it fully in the original, or we can attempt
to understand other cultures and enjoy other works of literature, however
imperfectly, by reading translations.  As in all fallible (human) matters,
our guides to other literatures and cultures may or may not be adequate.  I
am not surprised to know that this is the case in Yiddish, since it certainly
is so in Spanish; pace S. Berger, there is a world of difference between
Agnes Moncy Gullon's splendid translation of the 1500-page masterpiece
"Fortunata y Jacinta" and Lester Clark's appallingly unintelligible one.  And
even so, Moncy Gullon's translation cannot convey all the flavor, complexity
and beauty of the original.  The best translation may give the illusion of
being "transformed through it into something Spanish," but it is no more than
an illusion.  I do not expect my English-only students who read Moncy
Gullon's translation to be experts in Spanish culture after their reading -
any more than I see myself as an expert on Yiddish culture because I have
read translations of various Yiddish writers.

But the real question is:  should translation be condemned because it is not
the original, and given up as impossible?  I hope to be able to read Sholem
Aleichem in the original someday.  Until I can open my grandmother's "ale
verk fun sholem aleykhem" and read them as effortlessly as I do Spanish and
English, should I refuse to read any translations of his work, no matter how
much I enjoy them?  Should I refuse to allow my children to read them?  My
answer as a teacher, a parent, and a child of Yiddish culture with a yerushe
to pass on to my grandmother's great-grandchildren, is no.

I believe in the accuracy of S. Berger's strictures concerning the quality of
many Yiddish translations.  For me the solution lies in better translations,
not in no translations at all.
