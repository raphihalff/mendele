Subject: Shney/shneyen

Mikhl Herzog asks (4.249)

>With respect to their stressed vowels, what other pairs of German
>words relate as do "Schnee" [e:] 'snow' and "schneien" [ay] 'to snow'?
>Yiddish has either "shney"/"shneyen" or "shnay"/"shnayen". What gives?

The dictionary says, "schneien" is the original form and "Schee" a later
abstraction inducing an ablaut.

There are a few German word pairs with a similar vowel shift.  "Weh"
(woe) and "weinen" (cry in tears) correspond to Yiddish "vey" and
"vaynen" (not sure if I'm mixing dialects here).  Another pair is "Fee"
(fairy) and "feien" (protect by magic), where the verb only exists in
modern German as a past participle (gefeit), used as an adjective.  In
this case however, "Fee" entered German twice in history.  The older form
is "Fei" (now extinct) so "feien" may well have survived from the older
form.

There is a whole family of etymologically related words which have either
[e:] or [ei], all going back to some Indo-European root meaning
"something sticky".  "Leim" (glue), "Lehm" (clay), "Klee" (clover) and
"Kleie" (bran) are examples.

Finally, the [ei] -> [e:] transition is quite a regular one, though not
universal, between High and Low German, the [ei] form belonging to High
German.  "Kleid/Kleed" (dress) "Bein/Been" (leg) and "Stein/Steen"
(stone) come to mind.

Subject: Davenen

In his version of the song _A khazen oyf shabes_, Theodore Bikel in one
place changes the pronunciation of "gedavent" to "gedabrt", whith a
trilled r.  The purpose is apparently to characterize the speaker as an
athletic, and perhaps somewhat primitive, type of person.  While the v to
b transition sounds plausible, I don't understand how the r enters the
game.  Is this a common alternate pronunciation?  A mispronunciation?

Subject: A heymishe khasene

Andrew Cassel asks:

> "Dobridzen"? "Piptishklekh"? "Rumfel"? "Net brat"? "Gefonfet"? Can
> anyone help with these?

"dobri-dzien" -- Harkavy says '"Good Morning," music played in honor of
the bride on the morning of the wedding-day.'

By context, I would guess that "piptishklekh" might be a variant of
"pitshevkes". "mit ale pitshevkes" is an expression, usually humorous,
meaning 'in great detail', 'with every last detail'.

Again by context, I think "rumfel" might be English, "roomful".

"fonfen", as some one has already pointed out, is to speak unclearly.
Weinreich say 'speak with a twang', but I think Harkavy does better with
'to snuffle, speak through the nose'. I've seen it used about some one
speaking at unnecessary length to a captive audience ;-)

Subject: To fonf, or not to fonf

In answer to Andrew Cassel's query in Mendele 4-247 about the word
"gefonfet," Abe Bloom (Mendele 4-248) answers that "Gefonfet is eqivalent
to the expression "muttered in his beard."

As one who frequently mutters in his beard, but tries not to fonfe, I beg
to differ.  My understanding was that fonfen meant to speak as if one's
nose was completely stuffed.  If you squeeze both your nostrils and
speak, the result is what I call fonfen. In my memory, its use was
invariably comic or critical, and also implied pomposity or stuffiness
;-) , and sometimes long-windedness.

Subject: Zamarstynov (shtetl)

If anyone knows anything about a place called Zamarstynov, I'd appreciate
hearing from you.  You can e-mail to me directly.  My father came from
there and I'm trying to get a picture of what and where it was.  The only
thing I know is that it was a section of Lvov (Lemberg) where very poor
folks lived, and I read somewhere it eventually became the Jewish ghetto
during the Nazi occupation.

A sheynem dank.

Subject: Az me klingt iz khoge

Abe Bloom asks about khoge. As far as I know, the word is used to mean
"gentile holiday". I'm assuming there's a connection to the Hebrew word
"khag" which means holiday.

There's a saying in Yiddish: Az me klingt iz khoge. The figurative
meaning, I have read, is "Where there is smoke there is fire". So when
the church bells ring, it's a gentile holiday, which brought with it all
sorts of danger.

Just as there are Yiddish atlases, I've seen maps of customs for handling
Christmas. Children either went or did not go to kheyder. Adults would
sit up all night playing cards. Those are examples of customs. For Jews
Christmas and Easter were days of peril and uncertainty. The poyerim
might work themselves up and kill people.

So, my message was facetious, since I was born a Christian and was
preparing to visit my relatives for Christmas. But the word "khoge" is
quite interesting, as is the proverb.
