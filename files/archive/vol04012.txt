Subject: Subject pro-drop

Ellen Prince asked (4.005) about references to the omission of subject
pronouns in Yiddish.  A. Zaretsky, in his 1929 _Yidishe gramatik_
mentions two types without any commentary.  In the first type a
second-person pronoun is omitted:

	Ligst bay mir in bushe do (Der Nister).
	Khanfest, yeger (Der Nister).
	Zest?

In the second type, which Zaretsky calls rare and suggests is limited to
verbs like _bin_, _hob_, _vel_ etc.), a first-person singular pronoun is
omitted:

	Bin, dakht zikh, a yid vi ale yidn (Sholem-Aleykhem).
	Dem tsveytn mol hob zikh mitn yeger azoy getrofn (Der Nister).

Another source is an article by Evgenii Kagarov, "Eynige akhtungen oyfn
gebit fun yidishn sintaksis," in the 3rd volume of _Filologishe shriftn
fun YIVO_ (1929, pp. 467-72), which contains a brief discussion of what
Kagarov calls "onsubyektive zatsn."  He list three types, the first of
which is frozen constructions with omission of _ikh_, as in _bite!_  The
second type involves emotional utterances expressing anger, in which a
third-person pronoun is omitted: Ligt un ligt! Zitst un tut gornisht nit!
Shrayt un shrayt a gantsn tog! Finally he includes "elliptical
utterances," in which the second-person singular pronoun is omitted: Bist
geven dortn? Host mikh gevis lib? Again there is no discussion.

Both authors contrast the above types (with missing subject pronoun) and
types with a dummy subject (_es_).

Subject: More re Fonye

I often spend a Friday shabbes meal with Russian friends from Odessa who
have become frum.  They include the native-Yiddish speaking bobbe who of
course also knows Russian, her son, primarily Russian speaking but
knowing Yiddish, and his wife, an echt Russian who is a convert and who
speaks beautiful literary Russian.  Russian is the language of
discussion, with Yiddish thrown in for humorous color.  Last Friday I
raised the question of Fonye.  The bobbe and her son were VERY familiar
with this term from Odessa.  It was used for ANY Russian, not only a
soldier.  They also supplied the form "Fonka".  They took this as a name,
a nickname [like Mick or Paddy for an Irishman], but rejected any
connection with Ivan or Vanya.  They suggested the typical peasant name
Afanasij.  Linguistically this rings true--in the literary form the
stress would be on the third syllable, but in forming the nickname the
stress retraction, the shift to a stressed 'o', and loss of initial
syllable[s] are all typical RUSSIAN processes--cf Alyosha for Aleksey,
Tolya for Anatoliy.

--Jules Levin (a typical 'Hymie')

Subject: Kibosh

"Kibosh" as defined in the dictionary, is something that serves as a
check or stop -- e.g., to put the kibosh on that.  Its origin in some
dictionaries is listed as "possibly Yiddish".  Its pronunciation is
either KYE-bosh or k'BOSH.  Any maven mendeleniks out there who can shed
some light on this one?

[The shames, in addition to congratulating Golda, would like to remind

Subject: Yiddish Music for Slovakia

Recently I have met a lady from KOSICE in eastern Slovakia. There is
a jewish community of approx. 1000 there, awakening after 40 years of
totalitarian rule. Among these people are also some yiddish speakers,
who would like to organize some cultural events in yiddish.
They want to start with some literary evenings with music and need
some sheets of music (notes) of classical and traditional yiddish
songs preferably for piano. Could you help?!?

The address is:
Mrs. Vera Vesela
Jewish Community Kosice (ZNO)
Zvonerska 5
SK-04001 KOSICE
Slovakia, Europe
Tel.: +42-91-21047

Shalom

Subject: Brother can you spare a dime?

Recently a Mendelnik, in response to the discussion on oyver v botl, sent
in a verse of a Yiddish version of "Brother, can you spare a dime?"  I
would be very grateful if he/she could send me a reference as to where I
could obtain the complete song.

Please direct to:

ASTROJ@ASTRO.WASHINGTON.EDU (please note the "J" on the first astro) or
to Mendele.

Many thanks,
Chaim Rosemarin
