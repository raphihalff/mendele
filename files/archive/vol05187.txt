I can't find the words with which to explain to you what sort of
experience we had at the National Yiddish Book Center conference last
weekend (12/1-3) in Los Angeles.  Professors Roskies (Jewish Theological
Seminary) and Kassow (Trinity College) took us back to the Warsay and
Lodz ghettos, where we saw and felt what the martyrs had lived through
through their writings.

Such writings!!  Emanuel Ringelblum understood how important it would be
to document all the experiences in the ghettos, and had encouraged many
people to write down their experiences and feelings.  Those experiences
were heartwrenching, but what wonderful writing!!

Congratulations to the writers (may they rest in peace) and to Professor
Roskies and Professor Kassow for bringing them to us in Yiddish and
English translation.  For me, the writings of the ghettos are precious,
both for their significance and for their literary quality.
Congratulations to Aaron Lansky and his personell for giving us the
opportunity to participate in such an extraordinary three days.

Subject: Long and short vowels

I want to thank Khayem Bochner for responding, in 5.172, to my question
about "shraabn dialektish", in particular with respect to the distinc-
tion between long and short vowels.  The demonstration is pretty con-
vincing and evokes my recollection of hearing the speech of Jews from
Poland some years ago.  There is a danger, with this kind of transcrip-
tion, that it may become something of a caricature, but I think that
tends to happen in any language when a novelist (say) tries to suggest
dialect pronunciations.

I am interested in learning more about the long-short distinction in
Yiddish vowels, which seems to have disappeared in NEY (litvish) and
standard (literary) Yiddish.  Apparently it was a determining factor in
some of the vowel shifts that have occurred.  Tell me if this scenario is
more or less correct:  At some place and time there was Proto-Yiddish.
(Perhaps 12th Century Rheinland Germanic dialects --at least that's what
I read at one time.)  What was, for instance, a long `a' in Proto-Yiddish
(and remains a long `a' in modern German) became rounded and backed over
time and gave rise to a (long) open `o' in Yiddish.  The short `a' was
unchanged.  Later, the long `o' was shortened in North East Yiddish,
while in Central and South East Yiddish it remained long and continued to
become more rounded and backed (more so in the former than in the latter)
until it gave rise to a long `u'.  Still later, perhaps, in parts of SEY
the short `a' started down the same path (tote-mome).

Thus, what may have started life as [alema:l] became [alemo:l] (where the
`:' indicates length).  This then branched into the modern [alemol],
[alemu:l], and [olemu:l].  (This last was my mother's pronunciation, from
Southern Ukraine; the `o' and `u' were fairly open, however, and I didn't
really hear much difference in length between her "long" and "short"
vowels.)

Now, I knew a woman from Romania who claimed that, in *her* dialect, the
word was pronounced [ilemul]!  Is that actually the case? What
evolutionary process could take `a' into `i', especially if it was by way
of `o'?
