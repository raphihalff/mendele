Subject: Golda et al.

Just a query so that we may get away from grammar questions for
awhile. What does Arre Komar mean when he refers to Golda Mayerson
et al. as having still been Jewish?

Subject: "sch" vs. "sh"

Those khokhim who claim that "sch" is always understood as "sk" in
English unfortunately are confusing English with American. As any
Englishman can tell you, the proper pronunciation of "schedule" is
"shedule". Of course they also say "skeem" and "skool" and some how
the language of Shakespere has managed to survive quite well this
inconsistency. Shen genug!

Subject: sch and sh

As someone said, sch introduces a "superfluous" letter where sh is
presumably unambiguous (given the absence of aspirated s, except
across word boundary, this side of Korea). Of course, sch could
induce some reader to render it as skh. And in fact there is the
story, with perhaps a basis in fact, that during the war and just
after Germans trying to pass as Dutch were tripped up by their
pronunciation of Scheveningen, a suburb of The Hague,which for them
was sh...

>Mennonite lady named Mrs. Elizabeth Schmuck.  Don't laugh.  I'm sure
>there is a perfectly reasonable etymological explanation.  If you

	On a recent visit I made to a major bank's central data
processing facility, we saw a high speed page printer (I don't
remember exactly how many pages per second, but the thing spits out
pages so fast, it needs to be fed by a gigantic roll of paper, with
conveyor belts to keep it moving).

	Anyway, this thing was imported from Germany, and had a
warning to keep hands, "schmuck", and other things out of the moving
parts.  A colleague (native German) who accompanied me informed me
that, in German, Schmuck = jewellry.

	Sure had me fooled.

Subject: Frayland, grammar and argot

I do not share Arre Komar's views  on our history, but have no wish
to enter any discussion with him on that.  He had written also:

>Yiddish by the same token never attained language status since there
>never existed a state sponsor for an official version. In 1946 an
>attempt was made to create a Yiddish speaking state for the people
>liberated from the camps. The Dutch government was prepared to offer
>the Jews Surinam for that purpose. However the Zionists feared that
>the presure would be off the world commuity to crate a Hebrew state
>in Palistine should that happen. Golda Mayerson, Moshe Shertok and
>Dovid Grunbaum (yes they used to be Jewish in those days) used their
>connections in the Socialist International to lobby heavily against
>it.

Life in Israel is not always easy, but I tremble to think what would
have happened if Surinam would have become a reality.  Besides this,
what was meant by "yes they used  to be Jewish in  those days".
What became of them later? And who is/was Dovid  Grunbaum?.  Our
first Minister of the interior was Yitzhaq Grinbaum (... boim?).  If
Ben Gurion was meant, his former name was David (Dovid) Grin, but he
changed it to Ben Gurion long before 1946.  If I am not mistaken the
change was made prior to WWI.
