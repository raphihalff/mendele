Mayn tayere Reyzl,

A gezunt dir in kop. Dayne geshmake entfers gefeln mir! Gris Joshn
un di kinderlekh. And what did you think of the PBS foray into
mameloshn? I could have done without Leo Rosten, but I surely
commend BBC for their effort.

Warmly,

Dvosye Bilik

Subject: Re: mume/tante

For the record, I've had several students comment to me over the
years that their families distinguished "mume" & "tante" in more or
less the way that Blumke Kirschenbaum describes. The distinction in
meaning that Reyzl mentions is new to me; perhaps that accounts for
the generation split in some families?

I never heard "mume" in my family, but then I didn't have any aunts
of the appropriate generation.

Subject: Yiddish grammatic rules

Reyzl Kalifowicz-Waletzky shraybt:

:         You can still see an example of the persistence of these
: effects in the  ridiculous, ignorant statements made even as late as
: yesterday about Yiddish from someone who not only reads Mendele but
: even posts here quite often, Marnen Laibow-Koser.  Where in God's
: name can someone come on here and say that the rules of Yiddish
: grammar are "loose" just because they are unlike Latin's rules?

I think you misunderstood me here. I did not say that Yiddish
grammatical rules are "loose" because they are unlike Latin
grammatical rules. I have had no formal study in Yiddish and come to
it from German, as I said in my introduction, so perhaps my view is
warped, but it seems to me that Yiddish grammatical rules have a
degree of flexibility that many other languages do not allow (and
I'd say this about any modern language if I believed it were the
case for that language-- call me arrogant if you need to! ;> ). I
was not intending to patronize Yiddish; I think it is one of the
most beautiful and expressive languages around. As Ellen Prince said
so beautifully, we must sing to keep the language alive: too much
rigidity will kill Yiddish. Lomir zingen un shraybn un *shprekhn*
Yidish!

Shalom,

Marnen Laibow-Koser
