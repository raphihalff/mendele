Subject: klezmer

In Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, there is a scene in which the
Jewish musicians entertain.  I'm curious to know the Russian term
for these players. (See Acts II and III).  Hope this enlightens our
discussion.

Subject: Biases

For the list and MH: I was not aware that that revealed any biases,
at least in advertently. I was merely supposing, given early
acquaintance with certain type s of prudery, Labor Zionist,
Workmen's Circle, and especially 'way,'way left, f rom the Coops, in
the Bronex, that is. "We had none among us," showed neither i rony
nor skepticism, per se.  Irony is hard without context,hard to
catch.  the re is no debate here, only chitchat, and I trust it is
taken as such.

We seem to live in an intellectual climate these days where people
are terrifie d to be accused of bias, etc, and thus allow themselves
to be terrified.  Examp le: one of my colleagues, a straight arrow
Boston Irishman, a distinguished pro fess of American Literature,
was attacked a little while back because he had li sted on his
Syllabus for the Graudate Course in AmLIt, 20th Cent, MR. SAMMLER'S
PLANET. Protests!  A racist book!  He was rather taken far far
aback.  We plum meted this low. A feygele is a feygele, nit a
shande.

I was mjust written a letter by a Chinese girl who wants to enroll
in my D H La wrence Seminar in the Spring, because she is a
Romantics major and had run acro ss talk of Wordsworth by DHL. When
she asked around the Department (and she wro te me this, and I have
not yet met the girl, I assume she is a girl, as Junior) , she was
told the absence of assignments or courses on DHL was because he is
a "racist," a "sexist," a "pornographer." Well, we'll have a lot of
work to do, because, yes, Racism is the 20th Century's greatest
achievement, out of the 18t h Century, and Sexism is ancillary, as
it were to that, since it concentrates o n the two races of mankind,
male and female (vide Aristophanes), and pornograph y is in the eye
of the beholder (cf. DHL's A PROPOS LADY CHATTERLEY). Biasses?
Yessir, all over the lot.  Portnoy, Alexander, had a lot to say
about that, tha t erstwhile Commissioner of Human Rights, etc. in
some Jewish novel about some Jews.  Enough.  Methusaleh awaits our
coming.

Subject: Der Yiddisher Mikado

Just came back from a performance of Der Yiddisher Mikado, put on by
the Gilbert & Sullivan Light Opera Company of Long Island, who have
come to Toronto for the weekend. It was excellent!  Some of the
singers (especially the female leads) didn't project as much as one
would have hoped, but we were sitting in the front row so it didn't
bother us. I grew up on G&S long before I learned any Yiddish (my
parents were active in the local G&S Society, and I heard it at home
all the time), so this was a real treat. Some of the
translations/adaptations of the songs were hysterical.  Murray
Nesbitt as Khay-Shpay was superb.

Yes, I'm sure this won't meet the standards of the academics on
MENDELE, but I enjoyed it all the same.  (Perhaps you (you know who
you are) will admit it's an improvement over Country Yossi?)

Does anyone know if the Yiddish lyrics are available? I understand
that they deliberately don't have a video or audio tape.

Subject: Kabak

"Kabak" may indeed be a Russian word meaning tavern.  But when one's
head is compared to a kabak, the source is more likely Turkish.  The
modern Turkish word for pumpkin is kabak (also used for eggplant and
sometimes for squash generally, e.g., kabakli kebap--kebab with
squash). If one hears this in the Ukraine, does one hear yet a faint
echo of the Khazars?  Or perhaps it walked over from the Balkans,
something the Ottomans left behind.

Subject: Re: Jews and numbers

Delphine Bechtel asks (mendele 3.265) about Jews not counting
people.  This minhag goes all the way back to the Torah, in the
portion read two weeks ago (Ki Tisa).  In Exodus, Chap. 30, Moshe is
commanded to take a census of Bnei Yisrael, not by a direct count
but by having each give half a shekel toward the building of the
sanctuary.  Another way of counting men for a minyan is to recite a
ten-word verse, counting one man for each word; the one usually used
is "Hoshiya et `amekha uvarekh et nakhalatekha ur'em venas'em ad
ha`olam."
