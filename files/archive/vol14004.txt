Subject: Re I B Singer

An anecdote:

Some decades ago, I was telephoned by someone at UCLA and asked if I would
not undertake to introduce the writer at UCLA to a rather unscheduled public
lecture in the big hall of the Students Union. Apparently, some people out
here at decided to sponsor him; they brought him out, and would receive him
for a private gathering that evening after the discussion group with
students following the talk.  I agreed, of course.

To my surprise the auditorium was filled to capacity, perhaps 1000 people.
Morever, they had paid $5 for tickets.  Probably because it wasnt on the
season's lecture schedule and the budget was all assigned already.  I waited
outside with some guides, since he was late from the airport.  When he
arrived, I told him I was Professor Kessler, and would escort him.  He said
he had better visit the Men's first.  I led him round, and while we were
both facing the wall, micturating, I said, to slow down his evident nerves
or anxiety, "Mr. Singer, there is no hurry.  Nothing can start until the
speaker is on the platform." To the which he replied testily, "Never mind! I
dont like to keep an audience waiting!" I thought to myself, this is a
serious man and modest.

I led him out, spoke my 5 minutes' overview of the novels and what I thought
of his importance; after which he went to the lectern and, pulling a folded
sheaf of paper from his breast pocket, gave his talk. In the meanwhile, I
nodded to the student guides in the wings to lead him off, and went down to
sit and see and hear him myself.  I had been sort of bemused by the look of
that talk, on faded, scribbled, well-worn and dog-eared sheets, in fact
papers gray with age. The talk itself took my rather by surprise: lots of
railings about modernist literature, against chic trends like Marx and Freud
and Existentialists, as if they were trends after the 1960s! and some
allusions here and there to Spinoza.  It was more an aimless gabble of
garble than a lecture on writing, and it avoided Literature and politics as
well, for the most part.  I was astonished at its datedness and incoherence;
outdated by many decades.  What sort of boiler-plate nonsense was that, and
when had he written it first?  Never mind - the audience was rapt and it
cheered and applauded, although it wasnt what is common nowadays, the
standing ovation for the dog-catcher who comes to the school to advise
owners to keep their animals on the lead and to pick up after them.

I picked him a short while after the lecture, when he had finished greeting
and signing some autographs, not books, because nothing was available on
short notice, and drove him to another place  on campus to meet interested
students.  En route, I told him I wrote too, when he asked, and then said,
most earnestly, "Mr. Singer, I was honored to have been asked to introduce
you, and really amazed that so many appeared on short notice without
advertising, and even more, paid $5 to hear your lecture."

He replied, "Frankly, sonny, I voodnt give ten cents to hear soch a lekshur
myself!"

We both laughed at that.  Gimpel the Fool?  Yes and no.

I was wondering if anyone could advise me whether Goldfaden's plays have
been translated into English?

Many thanks

Subject: zhaleven

Someone had asked me for the English equivalent for the Yiddish word
"zhaleven". I knew in my mind what it meant but could not think of an
appropriate word in English.  Weinreich translates it as "economizing". e.g.
If you are eating a piece of pie and someone asks you to share it.  You then
give them a "brekl".  My reply would be: Farvos zhalevest'u?

A dank -

Subject: Mendele mit yidishe oysyes

Alas, some of us are saddled with e-mail programs that still do not display
Yiddish.  It has something to do with which programs (and which versions of
these programs) our host institutions authorize us to use on our computers.

Subject: Re: yarmulke

To Lori Cahan-Simon's query cocerning the origins of the word YARMULKE
(Mendele Vol. 14.003 of July 1, 2004), this is a loan-word from the Polish -
"jarmulka" (the "l" crossed diagonally). Thus Ignatz Bernstein (Warsaw
1907), L.Beresniak (Paris 1939), and Even-Shoshan (Jerusalem 1983). Leo
Rosten in "The New Joys of Yiddish" (New York 2001) cites Sholem Alejchem's
etymology (Yidishes Folksbalt, 1884) of the Yarmelke from the hebrew -
"Yaray may-Elo'a" (fearing God) but that must be regarded as a joke.

Subject: Re: yarmulke

In response to Lori Cahan-Simon's query concerning the etymology of
'yarmulke' [14.003], I should like to remark that I don't believe there is
much that is obscure or controversial about the topic. The word is fairly
obviously cognate with the many slightly varying forms to be found in the
coterritorial Slav languages, e.g. Pol. 'jarmuLka/ jamuLka' (where L = Pol.
crossed l), Belorus. & Uk. 'yarmolka', Bulg. 'ya(g)murluk' all designating
some sort of 'head covering lacking a peak'. The ultimate origin is to be
found in the Turkish 'yagmurluk' meaning 'raincoat' and spelled with an
inverted circumflex accent over the g. The fluctuation of the g in the
Bulgarian form and the r in the Slav forms is a reflection of the fact that
the Turkish consonant spelled with the accented g is itself very indistinct.
The semasiological shift from 'raincoat' or 'cape' to 'hat' scarcely
represents a problem in view of the common factor of protection against the
elements. The Yiddish stress on the first syllable is an indication that we
should most readily seek the immediate progenitor of the Yiddish word in
Polish in which (as in modern Czech and Slovak) stress was consistently on
the first syllable till the sixteenth century. And let us not forget that
Poland and the Ottoman Empire had a common frontier from the fifteenth to
the eighteenth century.	The Aramaic hypothesis on the other hand is clearly
a case of Volksetymologie or plain fantasy, worthy perhaps of Tevye and the
witty confabulations of Aramaic and Ukrainian that he weaves into his
pseudo-Talmudic quotations. The existence of such a hypothesis - no rarity -
may tell us much about the Ashkenazic sense of identity, but has precious
little to do with linguistics.

In response to Ruth Rischall's query re 'Akht tog peysekh' 14.003, a glance
in Roberta Salzman's exemplary _Isaac Bashevis Singer: A Bibliography of His
Works in Yiddish and English, 1960-1991_ tells us (under item A1102) that
this work appeared in _Forverts_ from 8 Nov 1985 till 25 July 1986.
