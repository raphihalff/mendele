My ear agrees, and I happened to come across an example: Sholem Aleykhem
wrote a story called "Men iz zikh moykhl".

My understanding is that invariable part ("moyde", "moykhl", "lib",
"faynt") counts as the "uninflected part of the verb" in Weinreich's word
order charts (College Yiddish, page 110 or 330).

More precisely, my impression is that the syntactic possbilities for this
part of the verb phrase are the same as those for "separable prefixes"
("arayn", "aroys", etc). If there are cases where this isn't true, I'd be
interested in hearing about it.

Subject: Jewish Jokes

Henri Begleiter says that he is interested in Jewish jokes and asks about
some.  Since he is French (or born in France), I'll give him a French
Yiddish joke.

A woman goes into Galleries Lafayette, finds a tablecloth and says to
the salesperson, "Alors, combien ca fair pour cette tishtoch?"

"Madame," says the saleslady, "cette tishtoch est 40 francs."

"40 francs pour cette shmattah?!" says the buyer.

The saleslady replies, "Shmattah!! Quel chutzpah."

To make certain that everyone knows, this is the end of the joke.  I
always found it amusing to speak Yiddish when I lived in France.  In
America, all the words for which there was no Yiddish had the English
word substituted.  My grandmother, who spoke no English whatseover, used
"icebox" as a standard Yiddish word.  But in France, whenever there was
no Yiddish word, they used the French word.  I thought this to be
hilarious, though I don't know why.

There was also a popular joke at that time that had a Jew go to a
particular railroad station to buy "a billet tsu Warshovie."  When told
that the "billet" (pronounced "Bill it") was "100,000 anciens Francs" he
told the ticket clerk, "Bist du mishiggah?  C'est trop!"

To which the ticket seller said, "Monsieur, c'est pris unic.  Je regrette
que vous n'aimez pas le pris mais le billet coute 100,000 anciens
Francs." The purchaser offers 75,000 francs for the ticket and is
refused.

At this  point the purchaser threatens  "Ich gai tsu le Gard de Nord"
presumably to buy his ticket there at a cheaper price.

I do not remember the punchline of the joke but he wanders from station
to station trying to buy his ticket to Warsaw at a cheaper price than the
100,000 old Francs he was told it would cost at the first station.  He
keeps getting berated in Yiddish by the various ticket sellers he meets.

I would laugh myself into a stupor on hearing a line such as: "100,000
anciens Francs?  Du bist mishiggah!"  The juxtaposition of French and
Yiddish in the same sentence was hilarious to one who juxtaposed English
and Yiddish in the same sentence.  I often wondered if French Jews got as
much delight in hearing a Yiddish joke told in English as I did hearing a
Yiddish joke told in French.

A toute a l'heure zus kind!!

Subject: Lithuanian Yiddish translations

To: Andrew Cassel

Just a couple of (self-) educated guesses re the Lithuanian Yiddish terms
you ask about:

1) 'Gloksne-beymer' are likely willows, > Lithuanian 'gluosnis',
'willow'. Willow is commonly used throughout northern and central Europe
for making flutes, particularly in the spring, when the bark can be be
slid off trimmed lengths of branch to form a tube. That '-ksne' ending in
Lithuanian Yiddish is often a good tip-off of a Lithuanian loan word,
e.g. 'shalamuksne', some kind of white berry my father (from eastern
Lithuania) was always talking about (how's that for a "Mayn-bobe"
linguistic argument?).

2) 'Salte-noses' - I'm on shakier ground here. Fortunately, I'm a
Californian. I wonder, however, if 'salte' isn't the Lithuanian Yiddish
pronounciation of Lithuanian 'salta(s)' (here minus the "hachek," or
small 'v' diacritical mark over the first 's', which I can't insert in
email), pronounced 'shalta', meaning 'cold' OR a form of Lithuanian
'salda(s)', 'sweet' (seems more likely semantically and less likely
phonetically).

Then there's Lithuanian 'nuosis', 'bran', or even 'nosis', 'nose'. Any
idea of the shape of the 'salte-noses'?

I'm taking my own nose out of here before it gets bitten off. Hope this
helps point you in the right direction.
