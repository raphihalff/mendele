"Yiddish is going off the air!"

There is a strong suspicion that radio station, WEVD intends to eliminate all
of its Yiddish programming.  If this news affects you in any way and you
would like to make your voice heard, here is the contact information:

Manager of the Forward Association
Forward Association
45 East 33rd Street
NY NY 10016
telephone: 212-889-8200 or 800-266-0773 (ask for the general manager of the
Forward)
email: newsdesk@forward.com

***Calls directly to WEVD will not help. They must be addressed directly to
the Forward Association. They own and control WEVD and have the final say in
whether or not Yiddish programming remains on the air.

The decision in this matter is sure to be made in a timely fashion.  If this
concerns you, I recommend a fast response.

Subject: A hasty generalization

In my recent post _Umbashri'en, another Verbal Superstition_ (6.064,4) I
stated:  "In nouns it [the prefix "um-"] means the opposite of the
original meaning," and gave several examples.

This was a hasty generalization.  It is applicable only to possibly 50
to 60 percent of such substantives, but NOT to all.

One of my own examples following the above quoted statement was the word
"umkum" [holocaust].  This word has _no_ opposite of the original
meaning of the base word, as is the case with the other several examples
[umglik, umkoved, umru, ummentsh -- misfortune, disrespect, unrest,
brute, respectively], and the generalization therefore does not apply to
"umkum."

This noun derives from the verb  "umkumen, iz umgekumen" [died a violent
death].  Note especially the _iz_ construction in this expression,
meaning perished at the hands of others.

Thus, this noun has no opposite _within itself_, as each of the other
examples I enumerated has, and the generalization therefore does not
apply to "umkum."

Subject: Curriculum for children's Yiddish class

The Workmen's Circle in Boston has just started a Family Yiddish Class.
The focus is on the children but the parents are there to help as well
as learn. The children that are currently enrolled range in age from 4
to 8 years old, and they vary in their knowledge of Yiddish.  So it's a
bit of a one-room schoolhouse.

We're full of energy and enthusiasm but lacking in curriculum.  We have
some materials from The Workmen's Circle but not a lot that is
appropriate for our program. The Arele series from Mexico looks useful
for teaching writing the Alef-Beyz.

We're looking for creative ways of teaching the older children who want
to learn to read and write, and the younger ones who are more interested
in playing games.  Rather than re-invent the wheel, we thought there
might be some Mendelistn our there who have developed curricula for a
children's Yiddish class and who would be willing to share their efforts
in order to pass Yiddish on to the next generation.  Books, games (we
have Yiddish Lotto and we've created a Yiddish version of a Hebrew board
game called The Great Alef-Beyz Race; we're thinking of creating a
Yiddish Scrabble Junior), physical/musical activities, and other ideas
would be most welcome.

Subject: Yitskhok Goldkorn

I am trying to find out the year in which the Yiddish writer Yitskhok
Goldkorn passed away. As far as I know, he lived in Canada. His death
was relatively recent so the date is not in the standard reference
works. New York libraries have not been able to supply this piece of
information: can any reader of Mendele help?

Many thanks,

Beatrice (Brukhe) Lang
