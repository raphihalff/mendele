Subject: Chopped liver

I recently heard once again (this time on a T.V. commercial) the
complaint "what am I, chopped liver?", and am wondering whether any of
you can trace this back to the Yiddish or Yinglish remark from which it
must come.

Subject: Yeke

I think Ruben Frankenstein's third option is on the mark. "Yeke" is most
likely derived from German "Jeck" a regional variant of Standard German
"Geck" 'coxcomb','dandy'. The other, more fanciful "etymologies" are
probably the result of the general unawareness of the "g/j" regional
variants in German which yield "janz jut" where we would expect "ganz
gut".

There's another, widespread reflection of this variation in Yiddish:
Standard Yiddish "dayges" 'worries' (Eastern Yiddish variants include
"da(n)ges/da:(n)ges/(rarely) daynges"), is realized as "da:yes" (with "j"
not "g"!! and often with nasalized "a:) throughout much of Western
Yiddish.

Subject: The red and the yellow

Having become a member of the jet set "af der elter", I was compelled to
make a trip to far off places on very short notice, just a few days ago,
before I had a chance to supplement my earlier posting about "redheads".
A chance meeting abroad now compels me to take it all back.

I originally implied (or concurred [Vol4. 138]in Dan Leeson's assertion)
that the designation of a 'redhead' as a "geler" was specific to Litvish
Yiddish. I was going to supplement this with the suggestion that this
might have been an avoidance device. I'm told that "a reyter" in Litvish
Yiddish designates a "kaasn", a man quick to anger. Hence, call a redhead
"a geler". There are, after all, other examples of such "avoidance
devices" among Litvakes. The Litvak says "avu freystu zikh" ('where do
you rejoice?') instead of "vu veynstu?" ('where do you live = cry?'). He
says "fisnoge" and "fisribe" to distinguish the "fis" that he walks on
from the "fis" that he eats. Why not "a geler" to distinguish a redhead
from a man quick to anger?

Enter Shmuel Atzmon, director of the Tel Aviv Yiddish Theatre, who
assures me that his mother who knew Bashevis well in Bilgoraj, deep in
Poland, spoke of him as "Itsik der geyler". Where do we go from here?

Subject: Kasrilevke

Kayle Goodman. We sang it, and that's all there was to it:

Fun vanen ku-umt a yid? Fun Kasrilevke.
Fun vanen ku-umt a yid? Fun Kasrilevke.
Fun vanen ku-umt a yid? Fun Kasrilevke.
Fu-un Kasri-ilivke-ke-ke!

Was there more? Did ANYONE write it?

Subject: Toronto

Sheine Mankowsky. I'm shattered! Devastated! That ANYONE, particularly a
Torontonian, would say of Toronto that it's "not traditionally known in
the past for its Yiddish atmosphere" defies belief. I envy your youth,
and perhaps your relatively recent arrival in Toronto, which alone can
account for your not knowing that Toronto is, at least historically, the
MOST Yiddish of cities! I leave it to present day Torontonians to defend
the city's honor ("honour" that is).

As a graduate of and former teacher at Toronto's "Farband yidishe folk
shul un mitl shul" and as the very first administrator of your very own
Bialik school (better known in my day as the "Viewmount shule") which was
itself born of the "Farband folk shul", I implore you to look into the
history of the community you so glibly malign -:), please!

Subject: Yiddish life in Estonia

I'm an undergrad at Columbia University (ich lern zich a bisl Yiddish),
and I just found out that the College sponsors an annual fellowship for
several students to spend a summer in Estonia. I think this might be a
great opportunity for me to use my new Yiddish skills to search out and
work with any Jewish communities that remain in that area. But I'm not
sure if there even are any -- this is where Mendele comes in. Is anyone
familiar with current Yiddish life in Estonia?
