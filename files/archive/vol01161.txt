Subject: "Shoah", Yiddish in Film, etc.

I only saw the first video of the five in "Shoah", but I do
recall there being some Yiddish, though perhaps too little,
considering the subject matter and that the film .

The documentary "Partisans of Vilna" has many interviews
conducted in Yiddish.  There is no dubbing, only
subtitling.  This film is excellent, I think, in terms of
including Yiddish.  It has other languages, too.  Avi
Kovner for some reason talks in Hebrew, but that's because
he wanted to, I guess.

I found dumb the use of Yiddish accents in the film
"Enemies, A Love Story".  If you think about it, in "real
life" the characters were really speaking Yiddish much of
the time with no accent whatsoever among themselves, and
occasionally venturing out into accented, probably broken
English.  Instead they were portrayed as people who spoke
English all the time, all in the same phony,
Yiddish-accented English.

It would have been much more interesting and authentic to
just have the characters use whatever language they should
be using.  The film "The American Friend" does a good job
of this, I think, with English and German.  I think this is
one of the really great features of film/television that
you can't have with radio, theater, or the written word.

The films "Hester Street" and "Imported Bridegroom" do let
Yiddish speakers speak Yiddish when Yiddish is what they're
speaking.  The main problem is that when you see them, it's
not credible how little Yiddish is spoken.  It's as though
the filmmakers found it too much of a pain to have their
characters speak Yiddish, so they just wrote it into the
plot that they only spoke Yiddish a little bit.

If you can't have the characters speak Yiddish when they
ought to, they should have spoken English with no accent
when they were really supposed to be speaking Yiddish, and
speaking with more or less ability, and an accent, when
they were really speaking English.

If that cannot be done, the least that should be done would
be to have them speak standard, unaccented English
throughout the film.  That is, I believe, what what was
done with in the film -- sorry the name escapes me -- about
the man from Salonica who saved himself in Aushchwits by
being a boxer and never losing a match.  Presumably, he
spoke Ladino (or Greek?) most of the time; but, whatever
the reason, the audience was spared having to endure a
phony Ladino dialect for the entire movie.  Maybe dialog
coaches for Yiddish-accented English are easier to find?

Subject: Introduction

I am interested in seeing Yiddish culture and literature
preserved, and I have recently begun studying the
language. This group is of interest to me in order to
know what Yiddishists are discussing, but I suspect that
I have little to add myself (for now).

Subject: grayzn

shkotsl kumt:

        From the contexts where I have seen it used, skotsl
        kumt seems to mean "look who just came in!", or
        even "look whom the cat dragged in!"  It may even
        derive (pure guess) from 'dos kotsl kumt', where
        kotsl would be a variant of ketsl, but specifically
        tomcat (kotter).  There might be a connotation of
        'the tomcat, having been out all night, has finally
        come home'.

        Itsik Manger uses the expression in the Megilas
        Itsik.  He also uses 'a teyrets far di
        bentshlikht', which to date no one has suggested a
        meaning for.

noyekh mit finf grayzn

        I always heard this just as a spelling game: can
        you misspell noyekh in five different ways
        simultaneously?  An example is <lange nun>
        <vov-yud> <ayin> <khes> but I only count fir
        grayzn.
