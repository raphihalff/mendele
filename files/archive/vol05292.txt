Subject: Ikh hob gezen a barg

Leybl Botvinik [5.280] asks about an English translation of Moyshe
Shulshteyn's poem "Ikh hob gezen a barg".  If this is the poem I'm thinking of
("a barg fun shikh" etc.) then I think there is a translation in the Almonds
and Raisins anthology published pre-1965. I'm sorry I do not have a better
citation.

Subject: Apple Hebrew/Yiddish software

With regard to Morrie Feller`s questions (5.285):

If you are wondering about the fonts which come with the Nisus program,
*Eilat* has the best Yiddish support. In addition to the pasekh tsvey yudn,
you can put a line over your characters (I believe only fey and beys, but I am
not sure) by typing a back-slash after the character.

There is a new(ish) program out called *WorldWrite*, which I saw advertised
via CNN, and on the Internet. It also has Hebrew capabilites, but I have not
seen it yet and therefore do not know about the Yiddish support. As they have
been notoriously slow to ship out their new version, this may be the program
you were talking about.

Subject: "Ikh bin mir a meydl"

I have recalled two verses (the first and the final?) of the folk song "Ikh
bin mir a meydl" and would appreciate having the intervening verses, which I
have not been able to recall or locate.

Ikh bin mir a meydl in di yoren.
Vos host du mir dem kop fardreyt? (2X)
Ikh volt shoyn lang a kalle gevoren un efsher tahke khasine gehat. (2X)
...
Un efsher gey es ketsele in yikhes?
Meyn zeyde is gevezen a rov, (2X)
Meyn tahte is geven der shenste yid in shtetl, los shoyn nemen a sof! (2X)

A sheynem dank!

Subject: A libe iz an umglik af der velt

I first became familiar with the song through singning in a Yiddish chorus.
The song may have been introduced into the Yiddish choral repetoire by Jacob
Schaefer, one of the founders of The Jewish Music Alliance.  For those
interested, there is a 3 part choral arrangement of the song (STB), identified
as "folklid arr. J.Schaefer, in "Ich Her A Kol", 22 Selected Songs of Jacob
Schaefer, Jewish Music Alliance, 1952.
