Luba Kadisson on The Yiddish Hour as it Begins its 4th Year on WBRS

An interview with veteran Yiddish stage actress Luba Kadisson will
be heard on The Yiddish Hour on Sunday, February 13. Kadisson
discusses her recently published memoirs, _On Stage, Off Stage
(Harvard University Press, 1992), and looks back on her career in
the theater, including the many years of collaboration with her late
husband, the actor Joseph Buloff.  The Yiddish Hour is heard every
Sunday, from 6 to 7 P.M. on Waltham/Brandeis radio station WBRS
100.1 FM. Mark David is host and producer.

This exclusive interview, conducted by regular Yiddish Hour
contributor Hasia Segal, continues the celebration of The Yiddish
Hour's third year on the air. The Yiddish Hour features music, news,
humor, poetry, interviews, and commentary, much of it recorded
exclusively for WBRS, and all of it in Yiddish.  The previous
broadcast year featured exclusive interviews with persons well-known
in the Yiddish speaking community and beyond, including Ruth Wisse,
Vladka Meed, Shlomo Perel, Jeff Warshauer, Mordkhe Schaechter, and
Miriam Kressyn.

Subject: Re: European Jewry

I've been too busy to follow the discussion in detail, so forgive me
if this has come up already:

I haven't noticed any mention of mitochondrial DNA. Unlike the more
familiar genetic material, mitochondrial DNA is received only from
the mother, and so it gives a good measure of relatedness through
_maternal_ lines of descent.

I _thought_ I heard it reported once that some sampling of
mitochondrial DNA was done among a cross-section of Israelis, and
that a high proportion of the results were consistent with descent
from a common origin 3000 to 3500 years ago. But this is just a
vague recollection; I have no idea where I heard it, and I'm
certainly no biologist

Does anyone know more about it?

Subject: Mendelian genetics

The proper contemporary way one traces racial descent, at least
through the female line (which seems to be of most interest in the
recent discussions of rape vs. intermarriage) is through
mitocondrial DNA which is inherited only from the mother. This is
far more precise than the archaic blood typing refered to in some
recent letters. Such analysis has been done for Jewish populations
with comparison to other comunities. I have read such a report about
2 years ago by Dr. Karen Bacon , Dean of Stern College of Yeshiva
University. I don't have the precise reference at my fingertips but
can track it down if there is some interest.

The particulr problem that Dr. Bacon was interested was the issue of
whether the Falasha Jews were genetically  distinct from there
Ethiopian neighbors and whether they bore any closer genetic
relationship to European Jews. The Halakhic implications of this
question is quite evident and was the driving issue of the article.
As I recall (but you realize that I read this several years ago) was
that there are distinct genetic markers the distinguish European
Jews, both Ashkenazic and Sephardic from their neighbors. Some few
of these markers do seem to occur in the Falasha community, but by
and large they are much closer genetically to their African
neighbors. The article was not as concerned about the relationship
of the European Jews with their Gentile neighbors but I have the
impression that that information has also been fully catalogued,
analyzed and published elsewhere. The reference may even be in Dr.
Bacon's article.

AS for the red hair that is found in central European Jewish
populations, it seems rather eveident that it could not be from the
Khazars since they were a Turkic people who's hair is uniformly
black. Red hair is conspicuously found in Celtic populations. The
fountainhead of Celtic populations is the Southern region of Poland
appropriately known as Galicia. Indeed the classic ancient Celtic
site (circa 1500 BCE) is known to be the Austrian village of
Halstadt. The Celts were an Iron age people who did not arrive in
the British isle until about 500 BCE. Other groups of Celts migrated
to Spain wich also has a Gallego region and yet others went east to
setle the Anatolian province of Galicia. The point of this all is
that red hair is charecteric of Celtic central Europe, particulary
Galicia.  Thus it is hardly surprisng that it is found so frequently
among galitsianers.

As for the oriental features among many Russian Jews, In addition to
the Judaizing sects of Byelorussia the Kantonisten laws required the
constription of Jewish males (usually by khapers who swept through
the shtetles) for 10 year stints in the far east. They would
frequently return to their native shtetles when demobilzed with
wives and children acquired in the outposts of empire much as we
have Vietnamese brides brought home from our erstwhile Asian empire.

Subject: Yisrael Zamir's *My father IBS*

On Feb 8 at the Jerusalem Municipal Library there was a "literary
evening" in honor of the new book, "Avi, IBS [My Father, Yizhak
Bashevis Singer]" <Hebrew, 192p>, (Sifriat Hapoalim, 1994) by
Yisrael Zamir, who is an editor of *Al-Hamishmar* and a stalwart,
old kibbutznik (Beit Alfa).

Dr. Malka Shaked, the lecturer, and Ehud Ben-Ezer, the writer,
reviewed the book.  They also ventured debate on the various endings
of *Family Moshkat*, presenting Zionist and Hebrew literature
interpretations of Bashevis and Zamir.

Video excerpts were shown from "May-haben ba'manhattan" (From the
Son in Manhattan), a TV docudrama which intersperses the 1955
father-son meeting with IBS themes.

The program chairman, Hebrew poet Avraham Hus, asked Zamir to read
the book's ending. Zamir obliged, although he said he had thought to
read some other part and not the sentimental close.

The highlight was Zamir's stories. For example, from how his father
met Begin: Bashevis was coaxed to meet the premier when Begin was in
New York enroute to collect a Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo: they
shmooesed like two Polish Jews, but when TV cameras were turned on
Begin started to scoff at Yiddish (that Yiddish lacked military
terms, as opposed to Hebrew)... (Not on that TV clipping, Bashevis
explained of non-equivalent strengths of Yiddish and Hebrew. Begin,
What word did Yiddish have and Hebrew not?  Bashevis, For example
"tukhes". Begin, In Hebrew, "takhat". Bashevis, "Ober vos for a meen
ponim hot takhat?")  Later, in June 1982, at a press conference in
the north, Begin, euphoric about making Lebanon "a friendly
country", asked Zamir the journalist, when would his father visit
Israel? Zamir answered that his father says he won't visit, "not as
long as you are prime minister".

Whatever insights one might draw from Zamir's history and work, for
certain, his puckish and softspoken smile recalls his father. The
book's cover design has their intermeshed sihouettes in two simple
red and blue lines.
