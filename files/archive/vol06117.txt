Subject: Sholem Aleykhem's language(s)

to bernard katz, who's astounded that sholem aleichem's granddaughter
never learned yiddish at home, here's another astounding piece of
yiddish(ist) trivia:

one of the co-directors of the bund was a certain victor alter, at the
mention of whose name many yiddishists get downright misty-eyed. well,
his only son, jean, is a very good friend of mine -- and he doesn't know
a word of yiddish. his mother was a french-speaking belgian (gentile)
and the languages at home were french and polish. (they lived in warsaw
until 1938 when jean and his mother moved to brussels, for obvious
reasons. he never saw his father again and has only recently learned of
his father's last years, now that the russian archives are finally
open.)

jean says that yiddish to him was one of the languages spoken behind
closed doors when his father's business associates came over... he also
says that the only interest yiddish had for his father was as a means of
getting the bundist political message to the jewish proletariat -- to
which the alter family most definitely did not belong. (his grandfather
was in fact a railroad tycoon.)

i think it's very easy for us to forget that eastern european jewry was
very diverse in terms of social class, degree of 'worldliness',
urban/rural, etc, and that yiddish, at least by the beginning of the
20th century, was certainly not evenly distributed across all the
subgroups.

Subject: Yiddish, Bel Kaufman's 2nd language. Astonishment?

Bernard Katz reports that Bel Kaufman, Sholem Aleichem's granddaughter,
a best-selling author in her own right, had to learn Yiddish as a second
language. As to whether astonishment is appropriate, I can't say. As for
me, I'm over any wonder about it. Seems like an ordinary process, given
the circumstances. Let me try to set up what I believe are some
controlling aspects of those circumstances. They apply most specifically
to the people under discussion, but have some general significance.

As English replaced Yiddish in homes of American Jews over a couple of
generations, Russian similarly replaced Yiddish in homes of Russian Jews
although stricter social isolation of Jews in Russia may have slowed
that process there somewhat. No doubt there were exceptions in both
America and Russia, but the general rule probably holds. Isolation in
the shtetlekh no doubt helped retention of Yiddish there. What I think
is often overlooked is that Sholem Aleichem during his mature adult life
(mid-20s on) did not live in a shtetl. He was a Kiev businessman (for a
while) and author. Olga, his wife, became a Kiev dentist. They brought
up their children in metropolitan centers, Kiev and Geneva (and
elsewhere). The children (including Bel Kaufman's mother, Lyala) were
taught in Russian at their Kiev school. Surely, their parents must have
encouraged their children to learn Russian at an early opportunity.

Bel Kaufman knew her grandfather, Sholem Aleichem, for a precious, but
short time. Her mother, father and she did not join Sholem Aleichem in
his migration to New York in late 1914. She probably last saw him in
Albeck or Copenhagen at the outbreak (or shortly after) of World War I.
Her parents chose to move back to their Odessa home, and did not move to
New York until 1923, seven years after Sholem Aleichem died. Her father,
Mikhail,was a physician and therefore must have moved in circles where
Yiddish was understood, but not encouraged, especially in professional
life. In my experience, personal and home life often is shaped to
harmonize with professional status. Odessa was a city of high Jewish
culture, but not necessarily Yiddish culture. Russian was the respected
currency, even in Jewish cultural life.

Sholem Aleichem wrote in his will that his stories should be read at his
yortsayt in whatever language is best understood by those present. Did
he feel that Yiddish was hanging on in his family and in the world by
weakening strands? I don't know. Apropos, he notes in one of his letters
(I can't put my finger on it right away) that Israel Zangwill (a famous
Jewish writer at that time) can't understand Yiddish.

Subject: Beregovsky archives

The Vernadsky Library collection has all materials of the former cabinet
of Jewish Culture, including manuscripts, wax cylinders, and Jewish
sheet music as well. There is no other relation between the set of
microfilms etc., which Iosif Vaisman referred to [6.116], and the huge
unpublished collection discussed in the previous Mendele issues.

Subject: Inyonay khanike

Efsher vayst do eymitser di sibe farvos di hibreyistn hobn a nomen
gegeyben a menoyre a 'khanukiya'. Vibalt der nes iz gesheyn in bays
hamikdesh vi der lakhter hot gehaysen menoyre volt geveyn a poshete
svore az khanike zol es okhet haysen 'menoyre' vos iz tatch a lakhter.

likht tsi lekht? Iz der khilek tsvishen lekht in likht bloyz dialektish
tsi iz ayns loshen yokhid in di andere loshen rabim?

Why is the Chanukah candelabra known in Hebrew as a 'chanukiya' and not a
'menorah' as it is called in Yiddish? Since the miracle happened in the
Temple where it was called a menorah it would make sense that the
Chanukah one should also be known as a menorah which means a lantern.

'Likht' or 'lekht'? Is the difference between 'likht' and 'lekht' merely
dialectical or is one singular and the other plural?

Subject: Saying "please" in Yiddish

In response to David Sherman's note [6.114], while I accept that 'za
azoy git' is a substitute in many places it only works with sentences
beginning with 'give me'. A request especially by a child can begin with
'I want', 'can I have' and 'give me'. By insisting on 'za azoy git', you
are restricting requests to a single phrase.
