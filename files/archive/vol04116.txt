Subject: Rov vs. Rabay Redux

Actually, the Rov-Rabay story is more complex.

The Forverts will call any modern rabbi "Rabay." This would include just
about any rabbi outside of the Yeshiva world. So, a modern Orthodox rabbi
would also not be a "rov."

This distinction is itself problematic. What ultimately determines if you
are a "rov" is whether you can "paskn shayles," that is, render a
decision about Jewish law. At the same time, even in English, the term
"rov" has certain connotations, especially compared to rabbi. For
example, I could not call the rabbi of my synagogue (which is Orthodox)
"rov"--it would sound facetious. Yet if I wrote in loshn koydesh or
Yiddish about him, I would no doubt use "rov".

Would you call Rov Moshe Feinstein "Rabbi?" Or Rabbi Alexander Schindler
"rov"?

Subject: Rov vs. Rabay

In Vol. 4.114, Shloyme-Khayem Cohen brought up the distinction made in
Yiddish between Orthodox and non-Orthodox rabbis in their titles.  He
noted that in the Yiddish Forwards, Orthodox rabbis are titled Rov, eg.
Forwards contributor Harov Arn Ben-tsien Shurin. Rabbis of other
denominations on the other hand are labeled "Rabay so and so."  The
contributor called for end to the distinction, which he felt to be
anti-Orthodox.

I whole-heartedly agree with the need to dispense with such distinctions,
but it is a fallacy to view the current distinction as anti-Orthodox.
Leheypekh!  Quite the contrary!  The offended party here is non-Orthodox
Judaism.  The traditional Ashkenazic term for a rabbi is rov (Sephardim
call their rabbis H.akham (related to Yiddish khokhem)). My
great-grandfather olevasholem was Harov Yude.  When Judaism began to
develop in different directions in the period of the Enlightenment or
Haskole, Orthodox Jewry drew back first from Reform or Neolog Judaism,
and then later from its offspring, Conservative Judaism, and still later
Reconstructionist Judaism.  Just as the Orthodox learned to distinguish
in the realm of kashrus and conversion, so too they developed distinct
terminology lehavdl, to divide between their own clergy and the suspect
liberal rabbinate.  The Yiddish speaking world was a predominantly
Orthodox preserve, liberal Judaism being a mainly Central European and
North American phenomenon.  The Yiddish language came to reflect the
Orthodox distinctions, importing a German word, Rabiner, to title the
Reform and later Conservative rabbis.  Liberal Jews were in fact
sometimes called Daytshn (Germans), recalling the western source of their
Judaism.  It is not improbable that liberal Jews initially even liked the
newfangled language and the connection with the west.  Nonetheless, the
Orthodox ultimately sought to gain a monopoly over the traditional
Yiddish title of respect for a rabbi, rov.  Unfortunately our press
reflects this distinction until today.  It is dubious that liberal Jewish
rabbis ever stressed a distinction themselves.  I assume that
Conservative rabbis are buried under gravestones with their names
preceded by Harov. Nothing else would be fitting, as Conservative Judaism
is a halachically bound continuation of traditional judaism, although it
is more liberal in its inclination to interpret the law to meet new
realities than is Orthodoxy.  It is true that the Conservative laity is
less rigorous than the movement's principles would suggest, but this is a
different matter. I imagine that today's Reform rabbis also use ha-rav on
their gravestones.

The distinction would be very hard to obliterate.  Both Hebrew and
Yiddish insist on gender endings and female rabbis are hard to accomodate
linguistically.  A rebetsin is the WIFE of a rabbi, and a rabanit in
Hebrew is also the wife, and not the rabbi.  As far as I know, modern
Hebrew has no word for a female Rabbi.  Yiddish does have one such word,
rarely used: rabinershe.  As soon as we use this form, we must use its male
complement, rabiner.  The problem is, the Orthodox could never
countenance calling their clergy rabiner, when the good old word is rov.
Thus neither rov (applicable only to men) nor rabiner is acceptable to
all denominations.  In American Yiddish the only compromise would be to
use Rabay for all rabbis, as in English, but this is an English
expression. Yiddish ought to be able to furnish a native term for this
basic Jewish concept which would satisfy all parties both in the
English-speaking world and beyond.  In the mean time it's hard to see an
easy way out.

Subject: pomegranates

Dan Leeson (Vol. 4.114) noted that the Yiddish for orange is pomerants
and inquired what would then be pomegranate.  A little history: I believe
that the word pomerants enterd Yiddish via Polish.  In any case it seems
to me that the source of the word is the Italian pomme d'arancia, or
something close to that.  The latinate word means "orange fruit." Thus
pomerants means orange. Frequently marants is used instead of the source
word pomerants.  By way of contrast, the word in German is Orange or
Apfelsine.  The Yiddish for pomegranate is milgroym.  The German word is
Granatapfel.  I would like to know: is milgroym inherited from a Slavic
base?

Der milgroym.  I wonder if it's related to "groyp", "graypl" (granule,
grain of cereal, pellet), just like "-granate" in "pomegranate" comes
from the Latin "granatum" (full of seeds), "granus ("seed").
