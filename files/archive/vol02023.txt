Subject: ferbissene

According to most sources ferbissene is grim, morose,
bitter. But a suggestion: can "ferbissene" in our context
refer to a woman who has rabies? (i.e. bitten by a dog)
This would certainly explain the accompanying sympathetic
magic (knocking on wood, etc.) that HBERSHAD is reporting
(2.21 #4)

Miese meshune referring to a dangerous woman reminds me of
the Central (European) Yiddish pre-penicillin expression:
"shene krankheit", if you know what I mean.

A footnote regarding M. Viswanath's question (2.21 #2)
about sigge. k - g interchange is quite normal in older
texts, I just happened to bump into one last night in the
Melokim-buk "yunkfrau" instead of yung. Another - not too
nice - example would be shaygets vs. shikse.

Subject: Farbisn

     To whom it may concern; "farbisn" means 'stubborn',
'grim' (of "teeth clenching" character); cf. German
"verbissen " 'crabbed, sour(ed), dogged, savage (in
fighting). Harkavy also glosses it 'cunning'. Why? Slavic
calque?
 
Meylekh:
 
     Everything you ever wanted to know about "k" and "g"
 (among other things) in Western Yiddish.
 
     Largely in southwestern Western Yiddish, there is no
distinction between word-initial "p" and "b" or between
word- initial "t" and "d". The mergers favor the lenis
variants "b" and "d". Thus, for example, both "tales"
(prayer shawl) and "dales" (poverty) are indistinguishably
something like "dales".
 
     On the other hand, word-initial "k" and "g" are
phonemically distinct.  However, the distinction is often
neutralized before "r" (again, in favor of the lenis
variant); thus "xrejn" (horseradish) which is generally
"krejn" in WY is "grejn" in the sSW; "xrmzl" (type of
pancake), generally WY "krimzl" is "grimzl" (and in Alsace,
"frimzl"). A similar distinction occurs word-medially:
"jakres" (scarcity) is "jagres" and the distinctive WY word
"ho:lekra:sh" (a naming ceremony) is "ho:legra:sh".
 
     Finally, intervocalic "k" also shifts to "g" in parts
 of the West; thus, "suke" is realized as "sige" and
 "joker" (expensive) as "jo:gr". BUT intervocalic "k" and
 "g" DO NOT MERGE: there is a distinction-preserving shift;
 intervocalic, lenis stop "g" shifts to fricative "x"; both
 "brojgez" (angry) and "brokhes" (blessings) are realized
 as "bro:xes". There is a parallel development in the shift
 of intervocalic "b" to "v", thus, "shaves" and "reve",
 accompanied by a distinction-preserving shift of original
 "v" to "f": "xefre", "lefaje" and the like.
 
     More than enough, right?
 
     Mikhl

Subject: RE: Mendele Vol 2.22

I have been reading Mendele with great interest, for the
last few months and I was wondering if anyone amongst your
readers could give me some information about a man (a very
short one), called Mickey Katz who came to Melbourne,
Australia, in the late 40,s to give a concert. He played a
clarinet quite magnificently but also sang songs (paradies
of popular tunes) half in English and half in Yiddish. At
the time I thought the lyrics were rather clever and bought
a record of some of the songs. I have not heard anything
about him since then and I was wondering if there are any
books available, either about the man or giving some of
those very clever lyrics. I would appreciate any
information anyone might have about Mickey Katz - if he is
still alive - or about his work.

Subject: Zol er zogn

I wonder if anyone knows whether this expression is
basically of European origin or whether it has perhaps a
Talmudic past, as in the very common 'litney' (let him
teach, argue, say).
