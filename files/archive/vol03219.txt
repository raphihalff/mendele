Subject: Schindler's List

I want to thank Hal Berman for raising exactly the very same points
that I found a bit disturbing in the film. With those few really
minor changes an excellent film could have been made superb. Perhaps
the error reflects the dirth of Yiddishkayt in Hollywood in general
and among well meaning Jews like Spielberg in particular. Some one
ought to send him a subscription to Menedle.

Arre Komar.

Subject: Language and maids

Just a quick response to a minor point in ellen prince's long and
interesting post on the migrations of European Jewry . . . She
dismisses out of hand the suggestion (by Weinreich? . . . I don't
have the post in front of me) that contact with maids provided
slavic elements to Yiddish.  Although that account seems pretty
implausible to me, it is not the only example of historical
linguistics claiming that maids caused significant linguistic
changes.

If I remember correctly from my days studying Russian, the standard
dialect of Russian most resembles older dialects spoken NOT in the
major cities, but rather in a region somewhat removed from Moscow
from which the pre-Petrine court got its wet-nurses.  It seems that
the region (I forget its name or location) was famous for its dairy
production and, somewhat superstitiously, Tsars and Boyars hired
women from this region to nurse, and raise, their children.  Such
characteristics of Russian as "reduced" vowel sounds in unstressed
syllables were apparently original found only in this dialect. I
don't know if this account is accurate, but it at least plausibly
suggests that maids, or at least wet-nurses, can effect linguistic
development.

Subject: Korn translation/Turniansky anthology

1. Some issues ago, Richard Menkis noted that Mark Flumerfelt, who'd
posted a translation of Rokhl Korn's *A nay kleyd* ("A New Dress"),
had not identified the translator.  The translation, by Ruth
Whitman, appears in her bilingual "An anthology of modern Yiddish
poetry", New York, October House, 1966.

2. Would someone please provide some information on Chava
Turniansky's college anthology of Yid. lit., mentioned by a couple
of subscribers?  Is it all Yiddish, all translations, or bilingual?
How extensive is it?  Published by ...?  Thank you.

Subject: Pre-Ashkenazic Jewry in Eastern Europe

Regarding the interesting (and important) question about the origins
of European Jewry, I'd like to add some historical data I have come
across in my work on the origins of specifically Yiddish.

Basically, every reference work on Yiddish which addresses the
questions of origins and early development points out the fact that
German Jews migrating eastward beginning as early as the 12th
century  met up (and eventually merged) with autochthonous Jews whom
Max Weinreich (and others) collectively referred to as Knaanic Jews
(<Canaan(ite), cf. Slav ~ slave). These Jews apparently came from
four major sources: Yavanic (Judeo-Greek) colonies, Byzantium,
Caucasia (incl. Persia?), and the Khazar state.  The best
bibliography on this topic I know of is Paul Wexler's (*Explorations
in Judeo-Slavic Linguistics*, Brill 1987).

I'd like to mention one other thing.  Some folks have made some
disparaging remarks about Khazarian Jewry, referring to Koestler's
(rightly) controversial and speculative work on the subject.  The
fact of the matter is that within in the last 15 years or so, very
good work on Khazarian Jews has appeared which documents the fact
that Judaism was quite viable across major segments of that society
in the latter centuries of the first millenium.  I recommend to
everyone the excellent study of Norman Golb and Omeljan Pritsak
*Khazarian Hebrew Documents of the Tenth Century* (Cornell UP,
1982), which points out, among other things, that the earliest
documentary evidence of a Slavic place name, QYYWB' ('Kiev') appears
in a Hebrew (!) letter from the early 10th century.  There has been
other more recent work on Khazarian Jewry which is demonstrating
that the whole question is not nearly so 'farkakt' as many have been
led to believe by Koestler.
