Subject: Introduction

I am a sophomore at Brandeis University. Although I cannot write or speak
Yiddish yet, I can read it more or less well. I hope to improve my skills
in this newsgroup, as well as to learn more about my Ashkenazic heritage.
I regularly post a Yiddish page onto the Brandeis Hillel WWW home page.
It can be reached at:

Subject: Introduction

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Comparative Literature at SUNY Stony Brook.  As
the name of the field implies, I have many varied interests, but the
relevant one for Mendele subscribers is my work in translation (Yiddish
to English).  An article on the topic and my translation of Sholem
Aleichem's "Mister Boym in Klozet" is now in press at _AJS Review_.
Sometime within the next several weeks I will begin a new Yiddish
translation project, and I look forward to the advice, insight and
experience of the Mendele users to assist me.  Credit will of course be
given where appropriate.  You'll be hearing from me!

Subject: Vaser-treger

I received a short E-mail letter from Marcia Gruss-Levinsohn and Moyshe
Levinsohn (Silver Spring, MD).

In it MAshinke informed me that for the past Purim holiday she worked
with a group of very young children on a story called "Yentele Royt
Mentele."

In this kheynevdik (charming) story, Yentele Royt Mentele was bringing
shalakhmones to her grandmother.  On her way the wolf was about to eat
her up, but yankl the _vaser-troger_ (water carrier) saved her and her
grandmother.  "Here," he said to the wolf, "eat this," and he offered him
a homentash. [Shalakhmones -- gifts exchanged during Purim between
relatives and friends;  homentash -- the traditional triangular Purim
pastry stuffed with poppy seeds and honey].

I trust that Mashinke, who once referred to me in Mendele, sight unseen,
as zeyde (not having seen my gray hair and my cane-assisted walk), will
not hold it against me for making a slight grandfatherly correction:  In
Yiddish the term is not vaser-trOger but vaser-trEger.

The reason is that when some Yiddish nouns are formed from certain verbs,
there is no direct vowel transfer, and the vowel changes.  For example:
Bakn (to bake), bEker;  darn (to wither), dEr;  tantsn (to dance),
tEntser;  trogn (to carry), trEger.  Similarly with some nouns from
singular to plural, as well as to diminutives:  boykh (belly), bAYkher;
dakh (roof), dEkher;  harts (heart) hErtser; hon (rooster), hEner, hEndl;
hamer (hammer), hEmerl.

This correction, made in public for its instructive value, if any, is
offered from the "grandfather" with  genuine  affection for MAshinke and
her family, for her young students, and for the participants in her
"mishpokhe Yiddish" activities.

The vaser-treger was an important figure in the life of the shtetl.  Very
often there was only one central pump for the entire townlet where safe,
drinkable water could be obtained, and the water carrier, for a very
meager pay, brought this life-sustaining commodity into Jewish homes.

Note:  There is one portion of the Pentateuch assigned for reading during
the Sabbath morning services called Emor.  (These weekly reading sections
from the toyre are often called by the first word of the section.)   In
this case the first word is Emor, and means in Hebrew "speak."

In Ashkenazic Hebrew the accent is on the first syllable, E'mor, and
sounds like the Yiddish word *emer* (bucket).

According to Max Weinreich (_History of the Yiddish Language_, p. 5), in
a township near Rovne (Volhynia), water carriers used to celebrate the
Sabbath on which the portion E'mor was read, as if it were a biblical ode
to the essential appliance of their trade...

Another curious bit of evidence of the basic human need for approval and
recognition, for a sense of self-respect and self-worth.

Subject: What's `Tevye'?

What is Tevye the Dairyman's name? For what name is this a diminutive,
via what language?

Subject: Shvarts-kheynevdik

Peter Kluehs:

khes-nun, not hey-nun. kheyn is German Anmut. Together, 'dark and
comely', a decided compliment.

Subject: Shvarts-kheynevdik

Peter Klues may be missreading or may have come upon a typo: the
expression he refers to in Izi Kharik is shvarts-kheynevidik
(khes-nun-ayen-tsvey vovn dik) meaning -more or less- "darkly charming,"
a common Yiddish expression for an attractive woman (not likely to be
used to refer to the beauty of a blond, however).  The expression
probably is an echo of the words in the Song of Songs "I am dark but
comely...."

Subject: Denver shpitol

In a recent Mendele someone quoted a passage from a poem called (I
believe) Song of the Denver Hospital, by (I believe again) H. Leyvik.
Since my great-grandfather's treatment there led to much of my family's
eventual relocation to Denver, it caught my attention. Can anyone post
the full text, or mention where and when it was published?
