Subject: Satan in Goray

K. Hellerstein appauds the translation of Satan in Goray while noting my
own misgivings. She is correct. I too admire the swift flowing
translation but the translator left out in almost every sentence one or
two adjectives. He produced a wonderful text for American ears but this
is exactly the problem. The Bashevis Singer texts are translated this way
as well and so we think we have a translation from the Yiddish when we
have an adaptation.  Singer does not write in that swift Hemingwayesque
style but rather he shapes and carves and caresses his beautifully arched
sentences and especially those of his early works published in Poland.

Satan in Goray is indeed one of his stylistic tour de forces and perhaps
one of the finest pieces of stylistic performances in Yiddish
literature.  The translator did a valiant effort for his time but as I
explained in my study of it some years ago, a lot was lost and it wasn't
just nuance, it was rhythm, vocabulary and atmosphere and tone. It is
probably his finest novella or novel and represents a writer in all his
powers as a literary creator. The sacrifices Bashevis permitted, allowed
and even encouraged for his name and fame in America will mar a special
chapter in his biography on his esthetic integrity and in which many an
American critic who never read him in the Yiddish pontificated.

Ms. Hellerstein, who is one of our premiere poets of our generation and a
master translator from the Yiddish is acting too reticent on this topic.
Those of us who attended the London Conference on Bashevis were treated
to papers dealing with the deletions and mistranslations which abound in
the Bashevis canon in English. If I helped to open this fact, so much the
better but it was generally agreed that Irving Saposnik, head of the
Hillel Foundation at Madison today, who was the first in print to point
out how many paragraphs and chapters were left out of Singer novels in
translation and therefore falsifying their meaning in English!

And not Singer alone! Our translators function like Yiddish stage
managers who know best how to handle Shakespeare: Shakespeare's Hamlet,
ibergezetst und farbesert! How much of Sholem Aleykhem, Rabon, Perets and
Mendele have gone through the same treatment! At the moment, the best
translations of our writers are in Russian, Polish and French! There is a
good Italian Tevye and the Spanish rises at times to real folkloric
sensibility. The German Bergelson from the twenties is not bad either but
the nearest Bergelson in english that grazes the text is the unfinished
effort of Neugroschl.

Of course if you accept Singer's wishes and accept the last Englishing of
his texts as the definitive edition then you are safe, but I do not. I
see it as a self-serving ploy by a brilliant writer who saw the fate of
Yiddish and chose to hop onto a living literature than remain a monument
in the shade. And Khayim Grade was jealous as Cynthia Ozick fully
understood for Grade called me up some years before he died and ordered
me to translate him for he wanted an American audience too. When I told
him I was translating at the time Bergelson, He screamed into the phone,
"Bergelson is died. I am Grade, my texts are better. Translate me!" I
felt his pain and his pathos and his pride. He wanted to live in English
too! But Singer lives in english having shorn his peyes, let us not
forget this point. Were Ms. Hellerstein to go back and lend her time and
blessed skills of lyric translation to Satan in Goray we might yet taste
a richer and more authentic text in english and truly savour the
Bashevis as a Yiddish Singer.

Subject: Yiddish and Bavarian

It is not with small amusement that I have been reading these recent
postings on Bavarian and Yiddish.

the week after I graduated from high school, I headed off to Germany as
an exchange student, staying in the tiny mountain town of Siegsdorf (near
Chiemsee, Salzburg, etc), wondering if my German would be adequate to get
me through day-to-day life.  Everything was fine until I stepped off the
train in Traunstein, when suddenly NOBODY was speaking German and my
stilted radio-german brought everything from smiles to my host-parents'
faces to scowls from elderly neighbors.  Finally on day three i got over
those inhibitions i'd been brought up on ("never speak german to polish
relatives, never speak yiddish to german ones") and switched over to
yiddish-mode.  voila!  days four and five spent fine-tuning things,
switching 'ned' for 'nit' and 'oa' for 'ey' and day six learning to say
'orchkatzlschwuoch' and 'pfiadi' and i was speaking bavarian like those
30-day cassette course radio offers!

no funny vowel confusions like non-bavarians have, either ('oans, zwo,
_droa_...') :)

actually, i found that my knowledge of yiddish was always a point of
interest to people, either because it made me sound less american ('he,
da ami d'boarisch kann!') or from a genuine curiosity about jewish
culture (which they had to learn about in religion class but often had
very little real exposure to)  in stark contrast to previous comments
about germans not considering yiddish a real language, actually i found
that they thought of me as a somewhat different breed of american -- one
that spoke a cultural language and had an interest in heritage, contrary
to their common conception of the bloede amis.

and two side-notes: in the process, i also inadvertantly managed to teach
my host family a good number of hebrew and slavic words... :)

and being able to sound bavarian to the metropolitan muenchners came in
handy too, frequently getting me out of scrapes with train officials and
dianetics guys -- but that's another story  :)

Subject: Yiddish/German and dialects

The discussion about the relation of Yiddish to Germanic languages and
dialects as well as Yiddish dialects leads me to a few observations and
questions.

About a year ago, a number of postings concerned Mike Meyers' Saturday
Night Live "Coffee Talk" skit and various Yiddish expressions he used in
his persona.  Imagine my "shock" to hear him on Jay Leno's Tonight show
about a month ago, when it was in New York, state that he was not Jewish,
but a WASP from the Ontario hinterland who knew no Yiddish before he came
to New York.  I believe he credited Queens for his exposure.  Now, my
question to the linguists is: What kind of Yiddish does he speak?  Is he
a litvak, a galitsianer or what?  Reruns should provide suitable empirical
data.

The various discussions of the relation of Yiddish to hochdeutsch, to
plattdeutsch, to Bavarian... remind me of my first experience in
Switzerland in 1963.  Arriving in Zurich from Milan for an overnight stay
before going on to Prague, I needed a hotel room.  The efficient system
at the old Railroad Station found me one and I needed a taxi to get me
there.  I hailed one and gave instructions to the driver, a man c.40-50.
We got into a conversation, me with my tsebrokene Yiddish base for German
which I had never studied but "picked up" from my mother-in- law and
winging it.  I found I had no trouble understanding him, nor public
conversation on the street near my hotel, and noted that his rhythm
reminded me of the sing-song of Norwegian Americans that I had become
familiar with in grad school in Minneapolis.  But what amazed me was his
telling me -- in response to my apology for my poor German -- that I
spoke a fine hochdeutsch!  Later, in Warsaw, I spoke with a cousin in the
same way, but she was well aware of my tsebrokene Yiddish. Yet on the
street, with older Poles whom I came into contact with, and who spoke no
English or French, the conversation was in "German" -- they having picked
it up during the war.  They never thought I was speaking mostly Yiddish,
though any real German speaker would have known it.

In 1988, in Berne (and Zermatt) I found local Schweizerdeutsch basically
incomprehensible -- including that of a close friend I had known for 18
years.  We always spoke English, but now he was introducing me to an
audience before a lecture and I couldn't understand him at all!  It was
both the accent and the rhthym.  Yet I had no trouble when he spoke in
"German" in other places.  And in Munich where I was a visiting professor
(with my lectures in English) when students spoke German I had much
difficulty following those with Bavarian dialects.  And attending a
musical that used Bavarian was impossible except for the one actor who
had trained nationally and lost her local accent.  Reading the Bavarian
text was easier, but the sounds were far from anything I was used to.

Thus, I am puzzled when some postings suggest that Yiddish shares sounds
and other features with hochdeutsch while others point to its sharing
with Bavarian and other dialects that are not hochdeutsch.  Just where
geographically speaking does hochdeutsch refer to?  I understand that
it refers to the "highlands" as opposed to the "lowlands" or "nederlands"
but which "highlands?"  Why did my Nurenberg/Berlin-dwelling mother-in-
law refer to the language spoken at the local Swiss bakery near my old
home in Manhattan, NY, years ago as "plattdeustch?"  The owners were
from German-speaking Switzerland.
