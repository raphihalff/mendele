More verses to Bob Rothstein's "Oy Di Rebetzen" [07.077]:

Sha shtil. Mach nisht kein gevald.
Der Rebbe geit shoyn tantzen bald.
Sha shtil. Mach nisht kein gerider.
Der Rebbe geit shoyn tantzen vider.

Un az der Rebbe tantzt,
Tantzen mit di vent.
Lomir alle
Petchken mit di hent

Un oy di Rebetzen
Oy is dos a Rebbetzen Vi zie geit
Az zie shteit
Aza yor oif mir.

Chazidemlach, talmidemlach etc.

Subject: "Indianer"

In regard to Louis Fridhandler's discussion of the German word "Indianer"
[TMR 01.022] he overlooks the fact that in standard southern German and 
Austrian the noun "Indianer" also means "turkey"--I've been using it all my
life, and any German dictionary will confirm this meaning.  Whether that
meaning ever carried across to the Yiddish word "indyaner" is an issue for
further research. This meaning is not found in the "Indyaner" entry in the
Groyser Verterbukh, but anything is possible. I have, however found the
Yiddish word in contexts in which it clearly meant "East Indian"--i.e. someone
from India--and also "South American Indian," whereas the German word
"Indianer" can only refer to an Amerindian:  a person from India is called an
"Inder(in)" and a South American Indian tends to be called "Indio."  Given the
multiple meanings of the German word "Indian," one would first have to prove
that the "turkey" meaning passed into some sort of usage in Yiddish;  one
might then conclude that Sholem Aleychem deliberately puns by using
"indianer" to mean both "Indian" and "turkey."

Subject: finger in fist superstition

Mikhoyel Basherives' account of the non-Jewish German woman doing the 'finger
in the fist' is wonderful -- and an excellent illustration of why doing
'Jewish studies' without a concomitant study of the relevant other
cultures/languages is a very bad idea...

David Sherman's recollection of the stepping-over superstition matches my own
-- it was alive and well in my house. 

I think we've been thru these before but other superstitions I recall from
childhood are the following. Don't know how many are exclusively Jewish...

If you spill salt, you have to sprinkle some over your shoulder.

If you sew something that someone is wearing, the person has to hold a thread
in his/her teeth. (This was 'explained' to me as distinguishing the someone
from a corpse, on whom the shroud is sewn.)

If you drop a piece of silverware, someone is coming. Each type of silverware
(spoon, fork...) signaled a type of person but I forget the details.

If you mention a living person and a dead person in the same clause (sentence?
paragraph?), you have to add, for the living person, 'Im/Ir tsu lange yorn.'
(Or, in Yinglish, 'S/He should live and be well.')

Any clause carrying the future tense, in any languague, must be accompanied by
'alevay' or 'God willing', unless it denotes an undesirable state or event, in
which case it must be accompanied by 'got bahitn' or 'God forbid'.

Any discussion of someone's misfortune must be accompanied by 'Nisht do
gedakht' or 'Nisht bay dir/undz/... gedakht'. Yinglish version: 'You shouldn't
know from it.'

If someone sneezes while a dead person is being talked about, the sneezer has
to pull his/her earlobe.

A first sneeze would be greeted with 'Tsum gezunt!' A second with 'Lang lebn!'
And a third with 'Nis deroyf!' or something like that.

You don't open an umbrella in the house.

Only an orphan can walk in stocking feet. (Presumably because of  shiva
rituals where mourners don't wear shoes -- tho barefoot is ok.)

Only an orphan can wear black (esp for children).

A thread on one's clothing mean you're going to get a letter.

A palm itching means you're going to get money.

Ears burning means someone is talking about you.

The first time a girl menstruates, her face should be slapped.

If a woman is menstruating, flowers will wilt on her. (And, for my Sephardic
mother-in-law and sister-in-law, she won't be able to make mayonnaise.)

If you drop a prayerbook (anything with religious Hebrew writings), you have
to kiss it.

If a dairy-only piece of silverware touches a meat-only thing, you have to
stick it into the ground and remove it.

If you sing before breakfast, you'll cry before supper.

If two people begin to talk at the same time, they have to cross pinkies and
make a wish.

If a pregnant woman crosses trolley tracks, she'll have a difficult birth.
(This was my cousin's mother-in-law's belief -- MY family laughed at it. It
wasn't up to the scientific standards of all the above beliefs that THEY
held! ;) )

If a pregnant woman drops a comb, she shouldn't pick it up. (Same provenance
as the last one.)

And, of course, the huge ever-present one that I still seem to hold, long
after I've given up all other supernatural beliefs: The fear of the evil eye
(called a 'canary' in my native Yinglish) and the hope of an antidote in the
saying of 'kinehore' or one of its variants, accompanied by ritually spitting
three times (poo poo poo!) in extreme cases. Wearing something red (for me it
was a little ribbon pinned to my slip) was an additional preventive measure
(blue for my Sephardic mother-in-law, as for Arabs in Israel and perhaps
elsewhere).

And I'm sure I've forgotten a few hundred others... ;)

Subject: Yiddish music

Hello, I'm a french newbie on the Net, so I'll probably make many mistakes...
Please forgive my poor english ;-)

I'm looking for informations about Yiddish music, and particularly those songs:

"Belz" ("Meine Schtetele Belz"): I believe it's a theatre song from Alexander
Olshanetsky's play "The song of the ghetto". The text is signed Jacob Jacobs
(1892-1972). It talks about a town in Poland (Belz). Do you know something
about Jacobs, Olshanetsky, this town in Poland or the play ?

"Tum Balalaika"  ("Tum-Balalayke") : It talks about wedding, stone, heart and
love, but I don't understand why... I red that in Kaunas Ghetto, the police
became the target of the song (I still don't understand why nor how...). On
the other hand, I believe the Barry sisters sang this. I've never heard about
them, but a friend of mine told me that the Barry Sisters were the beginning
of a fashion : two sisters singing. But I've no others examples of "singing
sisters" in Yiddish music. I'm afraid my friend was wrong.

"Dona Dona" : Words by Aaron Zeitlin (1889-1974), music by Sholom Secunda
(1894-1974) : This song was written for Zeitlin's play "Esterke" and was named
"Dana, Dana, Dana". But some says that "Dona, Dona" was written in the  Warsaw
Ghetto to express Jews' longing for freedom. Joan Baez also sang it. It seems
that this song has a very long and mysterious history. Does anybody
(well-known) sang it after Joan Baez ?

"Paper is white" ("Papir iz dokh vays") : It's a very old song (1912 I 
believe). It's extract from a Elyokum Zunser (1836-1913) play : "Mekhiras
Yoysef". This play seems to be very popular, but unfortunately, I've never
heard about it. Is there something specail in this play ? Or in the song ?

"My green cousin" ("Di grine Kuzine") and "My Little Boy" ("Mayn Yingele") :
those songs are about immigrant life in America, isn't it ?

"The Philosopher" ("der Filosof") : It's a very very old song (later 19th
century). I think it's a parody of fanatic hassid rabbis in Eastern Europe.
But what kind of stories  did they preach ?

Thanks,

Loic Audrain

Subject: Salt to ward off the evil one

My mother (b"h) was very superstitious.  For everything there was a remedy or
prescribed act.  A favorite memory is when my sister had her first child
(Mom's first ainikel).  To praise this darling baby girl would produce a
shower of salt to ward off the evil one who might be lurking and listening for
signs of extreme satisfaction or perhaps a little too much pride.  Whenever
Mom was around, salt would fly.

One night baby Randi had a great deal of trouble going to sleep.  She fussed
and cried and nothing would console her.  My sister felt the mattress 
wondering if it was wet, and if the baby needed changing. Instead, she found a
large lump, and removed a bag of salt from beneath the mattress.  No doubt Mom
placed it there to protect the baby from unseemly compliments when she wasn't
around.  Pooh Pooh! (Which has nothing to do with Winnie)

Subject: Food in songs

Mendelyaner,
Taking a moment out of working on my klezmer book to pass along my favorite
Yiddish food song, "Chicken" written in 1922 by Yiddish theater composer
Rubin Doctor (1882-194?) with a new second verse by myself. It appears on the
Kapelye CD entitled, not surprisingly, "Chicken". 
A gitn apetit!

Ikh veys fin a giter zakh
Vus iz git far ale glakh
A chicken, oy, oy a chicken.
Geyt ir af a simkhe, a bris
Est nor nit kayn fleysh, kayn fish
est chicken, est nor a chicken.
Keyn mol vet ir zikh baklugn
Dreyn vet aykh nit der mugn
Un baym hartsn vet aykh keyn mul drikn.
Libe mentshn, folk mayn fraynt
Vilt ir zayn gezint un fayn
Est chicken, est nor a chicken.

REFREN

Chicken, oy est a chicken
S'iz a maykhl vus vet aykh derkvikn
A pulke, a fis a shtikl beylik
S'iz geshmak dos yeder kheylik
Chicken, oy est a chicken.

A chicken's lebn iz nit gring
Vest yetst lernen yedersding
Fin chickens, oy nebekh, chicken
Tsi der shoykhet in di fri
Vert es bald a fricasee
Fin chickens, a top mit chickens
Trakht itst fin di kinder zeyer
Yusemlakh, di pitsl eyer  
Di mame ligt shen ergets mit a meyer. 
Libe mentshn her zikh tsu,
Loz zey lebn, est tofu
Nit chickens, oy est nit chickens.

REFREN

Chickens, oy est nit chickens
Tsum oylem habo zolst di zey nit shikn.
Hot rakhmones af der feygl,
Loz es lebn, est a beygl.
Nit chicken, oy est nit chicken.

Subject: Food in Yiddish song

Leo Kanowitz gives an interesting variant of a children's song about a mother
thrusting food in a child's mouth.  We found a version (without the
lokhele/hole) in Cahan #393:

A mol iz gevezn a mayse:
A tsigele a vayse,
Epele ber,
Gildene sher.
Di sher iz gefloygn
Un hot zikh geboygn,
Iz es farfoygn in yatke,
Hot es gekhapt a shtik markh
Un hot bashmirt Moyshen dem parkh.

Also in the Mitteilungen z. jud. Volkskunde, 3,  there is a rhyme, which
appears as follows:
Mazerle kazerle
eperle ber
gildene ser (sher)
di ser (sher) is gefloygn
in hot zex cerboign. 

We haven't found the part with the lokhele/Rokhele rhyme yet..

Years ago, Barbara Kirshenblatt Gimblett  was preparing a recipe book for
Klezkamp and asked me to come up with Yiddish songs  about food.  We sent her
the texts of many such songs.  A list of about 200 songs was published in the
Perl fun der yidisher poezye.  At that time Mascha Benya Matz and Bob
Freedman  contributed many titles.   

The song "Di mame hot dray yingelekh"  was written by Y. Goichberg.  The more
popular melody was written by Michl Gelbart.  I believe the melody that Sarah
Garby sings (that Ellen Prince) refers to is by N. Zaslavsky.
