Subject: More housekeeping

Two items:

1. Recent mail says that a lot of Mendele's readers have
been shortchanged in recent weeks due to erratic
deliveries, etc.

When everything is in place you will have two options:
1) retrieve missing issues directly from Yale, or
2) get them from the shames in the usual way.

HOWEVER, the first option has not yet been installed.
So if you're missing back numbers, write to the shames.

2. I would like to suggest a departure from the standard
way of running Listserv lists.  In Mendele's case, messages
to the list aren't distributed directly to the readers;
first they get bounced back to the shames/editor and only
then distributed.  There's no good reason why time and
resources should be thus wasted when you could, as
heretore, send your material directly to Mendele.

So let's do it that way.  Details at the end of this issue.

Noyekh

Of course, if you _insist_ on using Yale, makhtese.

This is what we sing (Simone learned it from her parents,
but our kids know it now):

	homen hot gevolt di yidn umbrengn
	hot er zikh aleyn ofgehongn
	aleyn is er geven a kapore
	oy, iz dos a gesrukhe!

[gesrukhe = bad smell]

There is a bagel bakery here in Palo Alto that makes bialys
(and I'll bet there are many in Los Angeles).

I once heard Sam Norich telling the anectode of some Jews
in Russia who needed to communicate with the local
authority (police officer, whatever) about some crime that
had been committed.  But they didn't speak Russian, so they
found a Russian who spoke German.  Then one of the Jews
begins telling the story of what happened -- and (as Norich
told it) it came out with a wonderful collection of
Hebrew-based words that would make it totally
incomprehensible to a German-speaker.

I'm afraid I don't have the vocabulary to generate this
stuff. In the interests of improving our Yiddish (for some
of us, anyway), can someone come up with a couple of
examples?  (A paragraph or a short story, not just a phrase
or two -- I can manage that much.) I guess if you stretch
it, just about any Germanic-based word can be replaced with
a Hebrew-origin word.

I've learned to be wary of the assumption that the sounds
that make up a word convey any particular associations.
It's tempting, of course.  Consider the English expletive
f--k, which is (once you know what it means) the epitome of
a "hard-hitting" word; and the phonetics seem to back up
this perception.  But do the phonetics really lead to
certain connotations? Or does the meaning that we know the
word has *result* in our associating certain
characteristics with the sounds?

I've tried to watch my own reactions to this phenomenon,
and have an interesting data point.  I'm fluent in
Portuguese, having lived in Brazil from age 10 to age 12.
Since I returned (1970), I've used it on and off, but only
in casual conversation; so my vocabulary remained at the
level of a 12-year-old. (This may sound familiar to some
Yiddish speakers...)

A few months ago I began reading a Brazilian newsmagazine
(called VEJA -- quite similar to TIME magazine) fairly
regularly. In the process I've learned the word for "rape",
which is "estupro". (Having left Brazil at age 12, it never
entered by vocabulary.) My first reaction on running into
the word, when I realized what it meant, was "gee, that's a
relatively `calm' and `meandering' phonetic sequence for a
word like that". (I hope you understand what I mean here --
it's hard to put it into words.) After all, this is another
word where the English is a hard-hitting, single-syllable,
Anglo-Saxon word.

Over the months, however, I've now come to be influenced by
the meaning of the word, and "estupro" now comes across as
a "nasty" or "hard-hitting" word, even just in the
phonetics.

Reactions to the phonetics of words are certainly in the eye
(or ear) of the beholder.

Do the linguists on the list have any comments on this issue?
(Or are we straying too far from Yiddish?)

Yes, I was referring to 4 cassettes that had been copied a
number of times. Sorry for the confusion.

Could you let us know how to get the Arbeiter Ring's
catalog?

Many thanks,
