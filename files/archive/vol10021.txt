Subject: Leon Blank; Volhynian dialect

As to the query about Leon Blank. He was a renowned deklamirer, singer and
dramatic reader who was influenced by the staged readings of people like my
great uncle Elihu Tenenholtz. His repertoire included works by Jacob Gordon
and Sholom Aleichem. Interested Mendelyaner can hear some of his 78 rpm
recordings which are in the YIVO (his recording careeer included 8 discs made
for Victor and Columbia from 1917-1928.) The best known of these was his 1917
recording "Der Fuks un di Zayg b/w Der Yidisher May written by Morris
Rosenfeld.)

Also: when talking about the Volhynian dialect don;t forget some truly unique
variants used in my parent's shtut Rovne, such as "nivint" for "noyent".

Bob Poe asked, "Who is Leon Blank?"

I assume that Blank was the one-time famous singer/songwriter and
vaudeville actor who lived in Boston in the early 20th century.

I understand _libling_ as 'darling', 'beloved', 'famous and favored',
here in reference to a public figure, thus ...

der grester libling fun boston
The foremost darling of Boston

kumt tsu un[d]z oyf yontef
will be joining us for the holiday

der velt barimter kinstler, der grester
the world-famous artist/performer, the greatest

kharakter sh[u]shpiler oyf der yidishe bihne
character actor on the Yiddish stage

der alter - imer yunger leon blank
the old and always young Leon Blank

"You know Leon Blank, our beloved Leon Blank, one of the best? Did you
know that he currently lives forgotten, without occupation and without
fame, in a small club in Boston, a city of ill repute? ..." [my
translation from Russian (a Russian translation from English, I
assume)]

Subject: Leon Blank

Bob Poe asks about words in a flyer advertising a performance by a Leon
Blank(?) (10.019).

"libling" is "darling", in the sense of "everybody's darling" still in use
in modern German 'Liebling',  so der "grester libling fun boston" is
"Boston's most favourite / best loved ___"

the [u] in "sh[u]shpiler" should probably be an [oy] so that the word is
today "shoyshpiler" (actor, German: Schauspieler). Neither Lockwood
(Lehrbuch der modernen jiddischen Sprache, 1995) nor Weinreich (College
Yiddish, 5, 1971) account for a spelling of the diphthong /oy/ using only
one letter - they only list vov yud. However, Birnbaum (Grammatik der
jiddischen Sprache, 5, 1988) mentions a spelling of /oy/ using what he calls
a "choilem" (khoylem), a vov with a diacritical dot above. The first edition
of this Yiddish grammar appeared in Leipzig and Vienna in 1918; the flyer is
dated 1928 and appears in a daytshmerish spelling (<h> in 'bihne' to
indicate long /i/, etc.), so Birnbaum's description seems to me to be closer
to the author of the handbill than more the more recent ones. A "kharakter
shoyshpiler" would then be the Yiddish equivalent of the German
"Charakterschauspieler", i.e. an actor who is good at acting out the traits
of character of his/her part.

So I guess the event was either a reading or a theatrical performance of
more or less literary texts ('_kharakter_ shoyspiler' suggests poetic or
even tragic texts).

Subject: Leon Blank

What is the word I've written as "sh[u]shpiler"?

This has to be cognate with German "Schauspieler", i.e. "stage-player" or
actor.

> What would "libling" mean in this
> context?

My guess would be that the actor is being described as "Boston's favorite."

Subject: Leon Blank

In response to Bob Poe's query about Leon Blank (V. 10.019), Blank was a
prominent actor on the Yiddish  stage, in Rumania in the 1880s, and in
America into the 1920s and likely later. Born in 1867 in Kishinev, his
family soon moved to Rumania . He sang in synagogue choirs as a child, but
was attracted to Yiddish theatre. In 1886, he joined Mogulesco's travelling
troupe and emigrated to America. He started as a member of the chorus, but
soon became an actor. He was one of the founders of the Hebrew Actor's
Union in 1899.In the 1920s he starred in many of Gordin's plays at the
National Theatre, Liberty Theatre and Public Theatre in New York. For a
time he was a member of a Yiddish theatre company in Philadelphia, and was
often on the road performing across America (which perhaps accounts for the
1928 handbill from Boston). His memoirs were serialized in Der Forverts
(Oct 5/28 - Jan. 29/29).

(Most of the  above information was gleaned from Zilberzweig's Leksikon fun
Yidishn Teater. Nahma Sandrow  in "Vagabond Stars," relates interesting
anecdotes involving Blank.)

Subject: Yiddish in the camps

Miriam Weinstein (10.020) writes:

     I am assuming that Yiddish functioned as a common language among
     inmates, and that Nazis spoke German only. Is this correct?

While Yiddish functioned as a common language among many inmates, one should
keep in mind that the camps contained many non-Yiddish- speaking Jews (and
who didn't speak German either) -- those from North Africa, Greece, Corfu,
Italy, etc etc. Primo Levi discusses some of the language problems in
Auschwitz in his works (tho he spoke German, unlike most of his Italian
Jewish inmates). And there's a superb movie, Triumph of the Spirit, about a
young Greek Jewish boxer, also in Auschwitz.

Also, if you include the Slavic and Baltic camp personnel among 'the Nazis',
then I'm sure they spoke their Slavic or Baltic language (Polish, Latvian,
Lithuanian, Estonian...) and probably didn't speak much German at all.

Subject: Yiddish in the camps

To Miriam Weinstein's question,  yes, Yiddish was the Jewish lingua franca
and because German is so close there was a whole lingo and use of the
Semitic component so that the enemy would not understand. There is a lexicon
of these code words that was published. The Italian Jewish writer, survivor,
Primo Levi actually learned at least some Yiddish in the camps and later
studied it in Italy. Yiddish was also the lingua franca of the post war
refugeee DP camps with many publications in Yiddish that came out there.

Subject: orl v. goy

Unz hot men gelernt az ven der goy farshteyt vos 'goy' meynt (un ver
farshteyt es nisht? Martin Luther hot es gut farshtanen in zayne
antisemitishe shriftn in 16tn yorhundert), zogn kluge khevre 'orl', kdey der
orl zol nisht visn az eem meynt men.  Mayn tate fleg oykh zogn 'krist' un
'kristn' (far a froy).  'Der orl' badayt a spetsifisher mentch; 'der goy'
ken ondaytn dem klal nisht-yeedn.

Kimat dos enlekhe hob ikh gehert do (in Montreal): onshtot 'shvartser' -
ontsudaytn a neger - zogt men 'royter', er zol nisht farshteyn as vegn eem
redt men!

We were taught to use 'orl' out of politeness when the non-Jew present is
likely to know what 'goy' means (and 'goy' is widely known: see Martin
Luther's 16th c. antisemitic pamphlets).  My father would also use the
yiddish masculine or feminine for 'Christian'.  In usage an 'orl' is always
an individual; the 'goy' can denote the general category of non-Jews.

Similar in purpose is the use (heard here in Montreal) of 'royter' (red)
instead of 'shvartzer' (black).

Subject: shikt arayn a boyer

If fraynt Gusoff believes that reference is made to a peasant, is not the word
'poyer' rather than 'boyer?'

A 'boyer' sounds like someone who builds things. A 'poyer' is a peasant, for
sure.
