Subject: Introduction

     I am Sigrid Peterson, a doctoral student in
Hebrew/Jewish Studies, or  something, at the University
of Utah. I also have a doctorate in Counseling  Psy-
chology and am a licensed psychologist.-- <One of
THOSE!> as a fellow bi-doc  seeker once said.

     Yiddish I learned (Ikh hob Yidish gelernt?) while 
working in New York City for seven years, and living on
the upper West Side. Anything no one wanted the _Shiksa
_ to understand was expressed in Yiddish. Since I
understood German pretty well, I could catch everything
except the punch lines to jokes. I don't  know what the
rules are for the distinction, but there is Yiddish I
can under stand, and Yiddish where every word is over
my head. I can watch an episode of Heritage: Civiliza-
tion and the Jews, and understand every Yiddish word;
then watch _Avalon_ and all the Yiddish goes by me. I
am a fluent reader of German,  and I found the recently
posted 19th-century Yiddish letter readable and  inter-
esting to translate.

     My focus for study is the spiritual *experiences*
of Jewish women, for  which I will need as much knowl-
edge of Yiddish as I can gain. It will be at  least a
year and a half before there is faculty available to
teach Yiddish. I  am now and then working through
lessons in Uriel Weinreich's _College Yiddish_.  (The
faculty member, Harris Lenowitz, said he didn't know
Yiddish, when I asked  him something about "dutsn,
irtsn." Since his vita indicates that he has  consulted
on a Yiddish film (_di mensh ohne velt_) and recent
MENDELE issues have explored the ramifications of the
_dutsn, irtsn_ problem, I assume that was his answer
"on one foot.") In any case I will have to find someone
at the Synagogue or JCC who is willing to take Yiddish,
as courses with only one student do not fly. In the
meantime, I can be building my knowledge of biblio-
graphic resources in Yiddish. Thanks to the National
Yiddish Book Centre, our  University Library has a good
Yiddish collection, which will probably wind up  in
deep storage unless someone uses it soon.

     I appreciate both mail.yiddish and MENDELE, be-
cause they keep my  curiosity about the language going,
which sends me back to Weinreich on an  irregular
basis. By the way, I still don't get the punch lines of
most _vitzen_.

Subject: RE: Vol 1.22 

I found Mikhl's miscellaneous comments fascinating. The
discussion of "oylemObe" reminds me of a question I've
had for some time:

Are there dialect variants of "olovesholem" (olov
hasholom) when used to refer to a deceased woman?  The
correct Hebrew is "aleha hashalom", but I don't believe
I've ever heard a Yiddish version for a deceased woman
that is different from that for a man.

Subject: Some replies to some of Mikhl's questions

Mikhl Herzog writes [Vol 1.22]:

    b)Even in Eastern Yiddish, where both "b" and "v"   
    can occur in the same position, there are regional  
    b/v variants; thus, "gribn/grivn, gribenes/         
    grivenes, oybn/oyvn 'above', heyvn/heybam           
    'wetnurse';
 
    c) Also in the East, there are sporadic variants in 
    which b/v are substituted for one another: "borbes  
    'barefoot', shtibl 'boots'" and "arves 'beans',     
    ariver 'over'.

Nope.  Keyedue, we spoke only perfect Yiddish in
Shpikov.  However, I had an uncle who substituted an
'm' for a 'b' in blintzes.  I have the vague feeling
that he did so mockingly.  His wife was, I think, from
Bessarabia or Poland; was he perhaps teasing her?  

    (Try to remember whether your mother ever dropped   
    her "v" altogether in such words as "tsvishn,       
    tsvogn 'to was and comb the hair', keyver-ovex,     
    malekh-hamoves" (thus, "tsishn, tsugn, keyverOes,   
    malekhamUes".)

No.  The 'v' was always present.
    
    1. I didn't think I was writing about Canadian/US   
    differences.  What did I say to suggest that? My    
    point was that, as a child and as a youth (Vi kumt  
    aza yungerman tsu redn aza sheynem yidish?), I      
    spoke Yiddish only to adults. I addressed them ONLY 
    as "ir" (except for grandparents, parents & their   
    siblings) and everyone addressed me as "du". Nor    
    mal, no? Same as you describe, I think, or am I     
    missing something?

You didn't suggest Canadian-U.S. differences.  I, being
for my sins a sociologist, tried to account for what
you reported earlier, [Vol1.17] that you were predis-
posed to say 'du' before you came to the U.S.  I real-
ize from a more careful reading that the difference
between us does not lie in our boyhood experiences with
contempo-raries (something I'd entirely overlooked) but
in our _expectations_ of how we should be addressed by
contemporaries.  So most of what I wrote was wrong.

The riddle, however, remains.  Why should we have had
different expectations?  Why didn't you hear 'zey' as a
term of respect until you went to Israel?  On the face
of it, i.e. on the basis of what Toronto and Ontario
once looked like to this observer, (a more recently-
arrived Yiddish-speaking population, a compara-tively
formal Canadian culture, etc.) I would have predicted
the opposite.

    3. As for the other indirect reference, "vus zugt   
    der ruv?", I've had friends (in Toronto) who never  
    addressed their own parents directly: "Vus vil der  
    tate?", "Tsi vil di mameshi zix zetsn?"

They did this but never said 'zey' to other unfamiliar
adults?

    5. Deriving from this form of address, the Yiddish  
    euphemism for 'wife' is "tsi herstu?/tsi herste?"   
    Thus "mayn tsi herste" 'my do-you-hear?' or 'my     
    are-you-listening? Grist for the feminist mill.

That's a new one for me.  As for feminists (I hope
Sigrid Peterson, for one, is reading this) the list of
less-than-complimentary names that men use for their
wives must be very long.  And even to their faces; I.J.
Singer's memoirs tell of his favorite uncle who ad-
dressed his (uncomplaining) wife as 'Beyme', Volhynian
for beheyme.  I wish someone could either work up such
a list (and for other social relations as well) or, if
such lists exist, point us to them.
 
    6. I don't know the Portuguese-Romanian hypothesis  
    (even in its discredited version). Please enlight   
    en.

I still don't remember the proper name nor the source,
though I'm looking for it.  Briefly, it suggests
that language-communities that are furthest removed
from the center change more slowly.  Therefore Portu-
guese and Romanian not only have similar words that are
closer to Latin, but Italian has changed more than
Spanish.  This is the sort of thing non-linguists glom
onto and never let go, as I'm sure you know from a
lifetime of fending off home-made experts.  (Even so,
you don't have half the troubles that we have in a
world where every freshman, rakhmone-litzlan, is k'mat
b'yerishe a pop-sociologist.)
