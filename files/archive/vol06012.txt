Subject: Introduction

Koydem kol vil ikh bagrisn dem khoshevn oylem vos gefint zikh do af der
"internet".

As a new subscriber I wish to introduce myself.  For the past dozen
years I've been translating the operas of Gilbert & Sullivan into
Yiddish.   I must hasten to add that in doing these translations I
adhere faithfully to Gilbert's rhyme schemes and to his meters and
rhythms while, at the same time, aspiring to maintain unblemished
Yiddish.  I always aim for a perfect match of verbal to musical cadence
so that the lyric conforms to the accentuation and the rhythm of each
musical phrase. The shows have been performed throughout the U.S. and
Canada.

I would love to hear from anyone who shares my passion for both Yiddish
and Gilbert & Sullivan.

Mit frayndlekhe grusn,

Al Grand

Subject: Khog'pakt tsvay tsatskelekh. . .

Just returned from the Manhattan showing of "The Dybbuk", preceded by
Shol Goskind's 1938 short "A Day in Warsaw" (a shaynem dank to Joel
Maxman for sending a notice in to Mendele).  Two things I noticed which
were relevant to recent Mendele discussions:

a)  In "A Day in Warsaw," the verb "pakn" was used to mean 'catch' when
no culprit was involved;  specifically, a tinsmith who has found some
work for the day "hot g'pakt a bisl arbet."  This contradicts the
impression of some Mendelyaner, including myself, who said a while back
that "pakn" only involves catching a culprit of some sort, e.g. pakn a
ganef.  Also, "gepakt" here clearly has the meaning of 'caught,' and not
its other usage, 'espied,' but "loy ro'isi eynoy raye."

b) In "The Dybbuk," while praising a bukher to the high heavens, a
shadkhn refers to him as a "tsatske."  I don't remember the maskone of
the tsatskele discussion, but my impression is that it can be used for
anyone young, male or female, and has a connotation of precociousness,
and this would seem to support it.

Lastly, I want to wish a belated mazel tov and and a hartsige "keyn
yirbu" to Mendele on our recent birthday.

Does the shver of father-in-law have anything to do with the shver of
heavy, difficult?

Subject: Yiddish and Franz Kafka

Herewith an addition to "About Yiddish and Franz Kafka" [6.008]:

Below is addition (and a little reminding) with translation of the
German quote to English.

The poem called "Sand and Stars" by Simon Samuel Frug (1860-1916) "Samd
un schtern".  It is a bitter interpretation of biblical promise: we will
be as sand and the stars. Franz Kafka adds:  "Nun,  getreten wie der
Sand sind wir schon, wann wird das mit den Sternen wahr werden?". In
English:  "then, we are yet trodden down as sand,  but when will we be
like the stars?"

please feel free to send me your notices and also questions.

Subject: Jizchak Lowy the Yiddish actor

Jizchak Lowy was born in Warsaw on 10 September 1887. He left Warsaw in
1904 for Paris.  In 1907  he joined a travelling theater troupe and in
1911 came to Prague.  It was there that he came to know  Franz Kafka.
In 1920  Lowy returned to Warsaw, toured the Polish provinces and in
1924 he founded  a Hebrew theatre in Warsaw.  Later he was writing to
newspapers. Especially  to  Polish-Jewish paper  "Undzer Ekspres".  When
World War II began Lowy lived in the Warsaw Ghetto. In  1942  Jizchak
Lowy  was arrested by the Nazis and sent to Treblinka, where he was
killed.

You may come into contact with another spellings of the same person:
Jizchak Lowy (with two dots over "o" in Lowy)
Yitskhok Levi
Djak Levi

In the writing of Franz Kafka there is the first spelling of the name.

You can also see a photograph of Jizchak Lowy in:
Klaus Wagenbach, Franz Kafka, 1883-1924: Manuscripte, Erstdrucke,
Documente, Photographien, Berlin, 1966 (page 58).

Subject: Another Yiddish word crosses over

One more Yiddish word seems to have moved into dual citizenship: In a
political think piece about the loss of Congressional seniority by the
Kansas delegation, Guy Gugliotta tells us (Washington Post, 4 Jun 96)
that states that have majority leaders or committee chairs in their
delegations do well in moving their legislation along. But "States with
back-benchers carrying the mail can expect bupkes." We've become
accustomed to seeing this Yiddish word, along with many others, in show
business, but in political writing?
