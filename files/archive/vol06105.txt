Subject: Helfn vi a toytn bankes

Re: Walter Golman's query [6.102]: the original understanding is
correct; a banke is indeed a cup for cupping.  (I still have an old
cigar box containing the bankes my grandmother, a"h, brought with her
from Poland in 1913.)  See Weinreich for further verification.  To call
something "dead" implies that it once was alive.  Besides, the grammar
of the phrase is clear; "teytn/toytn" is objective, not nominative, and
cannot modify "bankes" in this phrase.

That said, I remember many years ago that a friend tried to tell me that
"bankes" were leeches, and that the espression refers to the fact that
dead leeches were ineffective for bloodletting.  However, the word
"bankes" comes from Polish/Ukrainian "ban'ki," which are, in fact, cups.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Helfn vi a toytn bankes

Re Walter Golman's query on bankes, in our family the phrase was always:
"helft vi _kalte_ bankes."

Since bankes are hot cups, obviously cold cups would be useless. Does
anyone else remember it this way?

Subject: Correction for "Interview with Mordkhe Tsanin"

Please note that due to a typographical error, my last post [6.103]
erroneously stated that Mordkhe Tsanin's most recent book was published
in 1986; in fact it was published in 1996 (this year).  Sorry about
that.

Subject: Yiddish e-mail

For those who are intrigued  by the possibility of communicating with
e-mail in real Yiddish, I would recommend that they open up Netscape, or
whatever browser they might have, and search for <Mikhtav>.  There you
will find instructions for downloading programs for either Macintosh or
IBM which allow you to send and receive Hebrew by e-mail.  I have
successfully used the program with my Macintosh.  Although one cannot
send standard Yiddish orthography with this program, this is certainly a
big step in the right direction.  If any Mendelyaners succeed in
accessing these programs, I would be interested in exchanging e-mail
messages with them.  The creators of these programs maintain that they
are "cross-platform" which, I assume, means that a Macintosh can
communicate with an IBM.  I plan to test this by having my 11-year old
grandson, Avi, download the program for the IBM.  I know he can do this
because he is the one who downloaded it for me on my Macintosh.

Subject: Saying "please" in Yiddish

The issue of how to say "please" in Yiddish [6.103] is fairly simple,
there are a number of ways, including:

zay(t) azoy gut
tu(t) mir a toyve
ikh bet dikh (aykh)
bite (from German "bitte"); it was already borrowed in Eastern Europe
during the 19th century and has nothing to do with Belgium's proximity
to Germany, as David Herskovic suggests [6.103].

Zay(t) (zhe) moykhl has more the meaning of "excuse me."

I also feel uncomfortable with David Herskovic's suggestion that Yiddish
should take over the English word "please" for being shorter.  If
Yiddish already has a few ways of expressing a concept, then an
additional borrowing would be gilding the lily.  Brevity is not
necessarily the soul of wit or efficiency:  I certainly wouldn't tell a
French speaker to replace "s'il te (vous) plait" or a Spanish speaker
"por favor" for the shorter "please."  Nor do I share the feeling that
"please" somehow sounds "Yiddish."  To my American ears it sounds like
what it is: English. whereas all the Yiddish versions, even "bitte,"
sound like Yiddish--because I've not only heard them constantly from
Yiddish speakers, but encountered them endlessly in Yiddish literature.

Also: I believe his model sentence should read: gib mir (not geb mikh).
Is there any Yiddish dialect in which "gebn" takes the accusative of
person rather than the dative?  By the same token, a Yiddish speaker
would say "oyszogn _dem_ (not "der") rebn, _dem_ tatn, _der_ mamn," etc.
The accusative case is used only for the subject of a verb, not for the
object.

Incidentally, another Mendelyaner used "veg" to translate "way" in the
sense of "manner."  The normal Yiddish word for that notion would be
"oyfen/ofanim": e.g. "af a sheynem oyfen," etc.

Subject: "Collar button" af yidish

I am an avid and loyal lurker, and a student of Yiddish for the last
few years.

My wife insists that when she was younger, she heard in the New York
area a Yiddish language expression which translated literally as "no
further than the collar button". This inferred that one shouldn't
internalize personal stress or unhappiness.

It is hoped that a Mendelyaner can tell me what was used as the Yiddish
word for "collar button", or perhaps even the expression itself.

Subject: To tell on

One expression for "telling on someone" is "tsushteln a benkl". Thus,
I'm gonna tell on you = Ikh'l dir tsushteln a benkl.
