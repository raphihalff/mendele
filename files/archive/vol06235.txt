Subject: "Tate" af yidish

Regarding pronouncing TAte as taTEY, etc. [6.231]:

As for the pronouncing of TAte as taTEY, I support Adrienne Maltz's
second explanation, that it was a result of "an un-coached actress"
attempting to do her best.

Subject: "Tate" af yidish

The word "tate"--mispronounced on the X-Files--is always stressed on
the first syllable in Yiddish, even when it's pronounced "tote" as in
"tote-mome-loshn" used in Bessarabia.  The X-Files episode in
question, neatly fusing the golem and the dybbuk, managed to
mispronounce every single Yiddish and Hebrew word that cropped up.

And contrary to what the X-Files Jews or others may claim, the words
"golem" and "dybbuk" were originally coined in Yiddish (presumably
from Hebrew roots).  But check out not only G. Scholem but also Paul
Wexler.

Subject: Rosten's _The Joys of Yiddish_

May I respectfully take issue with my friend Dan Leeson's
characterization of Leo Rosten's "The Joys of Yiddish" as "a joyous
book if there ever was one" [Vol. 6.234].

I also have more than a few objections to the way the book was
portrayed in the New York Times' obituary page.

To characterize Leo Rosten's The Joys of Yiddish as "..the de facto
standard reference work on the language" [Margalit Fox - Obituaries -
2-20-97] is tantamount to citing Jules Verne's 1873 fantasy From the
Earth to the Moon as the standard reference work on space travel.
Other than for some cheap laughs of the borscht circuit variety,
anyone concerned about Yiddish or about the larger issues of Jewish
culture in America would be well-advised to steer clear of Rosten's
book.  The inaccuracies, the misinformation and the quirky and often
misleading pronunciation clues (e.g., meshuge to rhyme with Paducah,
p. 237) which appear on every one of the 533 pages are enough to make
one weep.  Scores of superb Yiddish reference works have appeared in
the last quarter century that should appeal to friendly Gentiles as
well as to uninformed Jews.  Although The Education of H*Y*M*A*N
K*A*P*L*A*N is a very funny book, The Joys of Yiddish is anything but
a joy.

Subject: Websites for Yiddishists

To Reb Noyekh's list of useful websites, may I add JewishGen, the home
for Jewish Genealogy:

http://www.jewishgen.org

and (with all due modesty) the sub-section that I help coordinate,
known (with all due apologies) as ShtetLinks:

http://www.jewishgen.org/shtetlinks/directory.html

It's a bit of a mishmosh, but I think there are some interesting
contributions (and more are always welcome).

Subject: Gender in N.E. Yiddish

In answer to the query posted by Adrienne Maltz [6,231:3], one could
well describe NEY as having two genders, though it perhaps makes
better sense to regard it as having four (but in any case it has no
neuter). I forbear to say more, since the topic was long ago more than
adequately covered by the excellent Meyer Wolf in his 'Geography of
Yiddish Case and Gender Variation', in "Field of Yiddish" 3, 1969,
102-215. One might, however, ask oneself how it is that, if the number
of genders is set in stone, English has none.

Subject: Gender in Northeast Yiddish

The fact that modern  German has three genders doesn't mean that any
language that branched off from an older Germanic dialect must also
have three genders. Old English also had 3 genders; except in obvious
cases, these have coalesced into a common gender. I believe Dutch also
uses just 2 genders today. In another vein, Spanish, Italian and
French come from a 3-gendered Latin, but only have 2 genders.

Subject: Gender in N.E. Yiddish

in response to Ms. Maltz's expression of her friend's amazement that
pre-YIVO North-Eastern Yiddish lost the neuter gender that is still a
feature of modern German.   Well, Yiddish has been around for at least
seven centuries, so all sorts of changes are not only possible but
have become intricate realities.  Long before the birth/brith of
Yiddish, German (unlike, say, the Slavic languages) had lost all
gender distinctions in the plural.  And in both the German and Yiddish
singular, the masculine and the neuter are identical in both the
genitive and the dative (though not in the nominative or accusative
case).   So it's not surprising that this process of reduction might
lead to the disappearance of the neuter in NE Yiddish.

German is holding on to its own neuter gender even though several
languages bordering on German have each lost one gender. Dutch is down
to two (living things and non-living things), and French and Italian,
like the other Romance languages, neutered out their neuter long ago
(aside from a few traces like the pronoun "ce" in French).

The interesting difference between Romance and North-Eastern Yiddish
is that the Latin neuter passed almost wholesale into the masculine
gender of the Romance languages, while Yiddish neuter nouns were
reassigned by Litvaks either to the masculine or to the feminine
gender--and sometimes both (di kint/der kint).  In the resulting
confusion, certain feminine nouns became masculine in the dative:  "di
Hant" but "mit'n hant". As in the Romance languages, Litvak Yiddish
still a few traces of the neuter:  for instance, "es" and "dos".

In the Yiddish used by certain Hasidic groups in New York, the
speakers are down to a single gender (presumably under the impact of
English, which shows gender only in pronouns).

Much as I love turmoil, turbulence, and total chaos, I do regret the
loss of the neuter gender.  The Indo-European languages are the only
group in the world to have a three-gender system--a precious commodity
in a gender-flattening world.  The Semitic languages have two genders,
while certain Amerindian tongues have a few dozen (the categories are
based on whether an object is long, round, curly, etc.). And Swedish
actually added a fourth gender, the so-called "common gender" (despite
the daily presence of Finnish, which has no genders at all).

Conclusion:  we should preserve Yiddish if only to preserve the
three-gender system.

Subject: Yiddish in the liturgy

Mit a por khadoshim tsurik (6.174) Reb Mechl Asheri
wrote:  [apologies but I'm a slow reader:)]

   ..the leader notifies, not invites. "Gentlemen", he says in effect,
   "Pay attention: we are going to bentsh".

I like the 'pay attention' bit. In some circles this precisely what
the leader says:

her tsi, raboysa mir veln bentshn

i.e. pay attention etc. as reb mekhl says.

[Please excuse the nonstandard transcription - but I have never heard
the 'her tsu' introduction from a litvak.]
