Subject: Introduction/umbeshrin

I have been lurking for ever so on and now I am introducing myself at
last. I am a third-generation native American, grew up with a few
Yiddish phrases here and there, and have been taking Yiddish weekly for
the past year and a half.  I'm a writer and write a lot about 19th and
20th century Jewish history/life, including my own. I have a piece in
"Nice Jewish Girls," ed. Marlene Adler Marks (Penguin, 1996).  I am also
doing research on Bertha Pappenheim (Freud and Breuer's "Anna O."),
Herschel Grynzspan, Sara Schnier, founder of the Bais Jacob schools.  I
apologize if I'm misspelling the last two names--I have e-mail at
Northwestern U, where I teach, and not at home, where I do my research.
One of the few words I heard growing up was "umbeshrin," or "embishrin,"
when is the equivalent to "kenehore."  The word was in a family letter
my Yiddish teacher helped me translate, and was the only word I knew
that she didn't.  My mother says that she heard this word only from my
father's family--which came from Pusvatin in Kovno gubernye. I have
enjoyed lurking on Mendele very much. My friend Andy Cassel in Philly
told me about it. Yrs,

Sandi (Shulamis) Wisenberg

Subject: Lyrics to "Alts far gelt"

I'd be very grateful if anyone could help me get the lyrics to Aaron
Lebedeff's song, "Alts far gelt," which my Yiddish isn't good enough to
decipher from the recording.

A sheynem dank in advance.

Subject: Roza Gutman-Jashy

Asking for a friend:

     Does anyone here know where can i get any kind of information about
     a yidish song writer by the name Roza Gutman-Jashy?

     Any piece of information would be most helpful. Online network
     pointers or any other form of pointers to her songs/bibliography
     etc.

Answers in english/hebrew/yiddish would be transfered to my friend.

Thanks
Uzi Armon

Subject: Work songs

Jeri Fogel asks about women's work songs / working women's songs.  The
Bund has a record of Yiddish revolutionary songs which has several in
this category, as I recall: Di Neytorins, Arbeter-froyen...

Subject: Yiddish in Nottingham

The following message appeared on H-JUDAIC. Mendelistn (and Robinites?)
to the rescue?? (BTW, this message inspired another one of those tired
old "Yiddish is on its last legs; why bother?" responses. Can any mental
health workers out there explain the apparently urgently felt need to
bury Yiddish? Ruth Wisse, perhaps?)

      Subject: learning Yiddish

      Does anyone know how I may learn Yiddish properly? I live in
      Nottingham and would attend evening classes if any were available.
      I am also interested in self-teaching tools. Thank you.
