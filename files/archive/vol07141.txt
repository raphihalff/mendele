Subject: Petcha/Fisnoge

Every time I see the above mentioned words in Mendele, it brings to memory the
many time my grandmother prepared this dish. First of all, my grandfather
would purchase several calves feet and I still remember the smell of the
depilatory process in which he would singe the hair and scrape the feet clean.
Then my grandmother would cook the calves feet with onions and enough garlic
to smell up the house.  She would serve it hot although in many areas it would
be served as a cold gel. You would eat the dish by sucking on the bones and
absorbing the melted heated gelatinous mass on challah. Almost one challah to
a dish of petcha. It tasted so good.

Subject: Vider fisnoge

In the wake of Russell Harris's article on fisnoge, reprinted in 7.137, I've
written him a note, taking the liberty of thanking him on behalf of all
Mendelistn for the acknowledgments he carefully extended, and suggesting that
there remains room in his text for more linguistic accuracy.  The letter
follows. 

Dear Mr. Harris:

Your charming article from Petits Propos Culinaires on fisnoge was reproduced
recently on Mendele.  I was pleased to see credit extended to the Mendele list
and to its many contributors who offered you information, and am most
flattered to have ended up fronting as a spokesperson.  As I wrote you last
fall, I am hardly an expert on the topic (or any of its sub-topics), so I took
your choice to reprint my words strictly as a compliment to my abilities as
collator of what the many others had expressed.  Compliment accepted. 

Now, hold the presses!  Before the Oxford Companion to Food becomes a fait
accompli, please note that fisnoge does not mean "literally 'foot-foot,'"  as
you wrote in your article, but "feet-feet" -- PLURAL.  That may seem like a
small point, but since you say "literally," you might as well be literal. 
(Readers of Mendele may note that /fis/ can mean foot, singular, in other
dialects of Yiddish, but in those cases the final sibilant need not be
disambiguated as it is in the Litvish, and thus there is no need to
pleonastically borrow from the Slavic -- and here I must add an emphatic "as I
understand it.")  More importantly, since I sent information to you, more
material appeared on Mendele, including some critical corrections.  >From the
acknowledgments in your notes, it appears that you read Mikhl Herzog's post in
Volume 7.070, but did you also see Hugh Denman's essential correction to my
less than punctilious linguistics?  And following the appearance of your
article this month, more posts have appeared on the Turkish connection of
petcha.  Dan Slobin's, in particular, should be of interest to you, as it
directly reintroduces the culinary element into the etymological discussion. 
The posts of Denman and the others follow below. 

Again, all thanks and best regards,

Ron Robboy

[Here I appended posts by Mikhl Herzog and Hugh Denman (7.070); Dan Slobin
and Bill Phillips (7.138); and Louis Fridhandler ( 7.139).  --r.r.]

Subject: Avraham Lebensart

I'm doing a research on Avraham Lebensart (1880-1909), born in Stanislav
(Galicia). I am looking for his writings (poems, novels, essays, ect.) in
Yiddish. Most of his works were published in the Yiddish newspapers: Yidisher
veker, Yidishes vokhenblat, etc. 

If you know about Lebensart's biography or his works, or about locations of
newspapers with his works please send me any available information. I would
appreciate very much your response and assistance.

Subject: Kokhlefl

I have to trust my memory on this, but, years ago, when I heard Mary Tyler
Moore as Mary Richards refer to Rhoda Morgenstern's mother as a kokhlefl it
must have been burned into my memory.  I don't know which of that show's
writers knew some Yiddish, but one of them must have realized that the English
word _busybody_ doesn't quite fulfill the intended idea (and has no comic
possibilities).  I heard it as respect for the power of Yiddish.  Sometimes,
though, an oblique connection to Yiddish seems awkwardly offensive. 

For example, I agree with our editor about the implied transgression committed
against Yiddish by the ungainly use of the suffix -o in schmucko.  (I realize
he meant to be wryly satirical.)  It triggered a memory of President Bush's
use of Bozo.  Seems as though, in English, the -o suffix can emphasize
derogation in more than one arena. 

As far as I can tell, kokhlefl has not caught on in English as has _maven_,
_shlep_, or a Yiddishism such as _go figure_.

Subject: Kokhlefl 

While "kochlefl" literally means "ladle, dipper," its figurative meaning -- in
my experience -- is generally pejorative:  "busybody, meddler, meddlesome
person...."

Subject: Kokhlefl and tuleyne

I believe I can add some more light on these matters. The literal translation
of kockhlefl is "cooking (or cook) spoon. It was a large, usually wooden spoon
use for mixing in a large pot. The idiomatic meaning is that of a busybody or
one who mixes into others business. It could have pejorative meaning depending
upon how it is used.

In my families usage it was "italeyner or italeyna" depending on gender. 
Since a non Yiddish speaking Italian could perceive that he is being spoken
about (since italeyner does not sound so different from Italian) and if the
Yiddish speaker did not want the Italian to know he is being spoken about he
was sometimes referred to a "loksh".  Loksh being "noodle" in Yiddish the use
thereof was understood to mean "spaghetti". The reference to spaghetti and
Italian should be obvious.  It was not pejorative. Another example:
shvartz-tinkl was used for the same purpose.

Subject: Kokhlefl

Further to Norman Frumans's inquiry:

A kokhlefl is more of a pot stirrer than one who takes charge of something,
Denotes high energy in one who doesn't easily accept the status quo. Could be
pejorative or not...depending on whose pot is being stirred and what's in it.

and Arlene Lapoff]

Subject: On the origin of the bagel

Cyril Robinson of Carbondale, IL recently visted China and noticed a
similarity of certain breads he saw there with the bagel.  He asks about the
bagel's origins and brings up the myth of its invention based on a story of
Sobieski's defeat of the Turks. 

First, with respect to the origin of the bagel, the New York Times had several
days of speculation, history, myth, etc. on the origin of the bagel in several
occasionally testy articles, and a key word search of the Times on the word
"bagel" using the last 10 years as a search parameter should turn up this
treasure trove for you.  It was a keenly fought argument with views from every
corner of bageldom.  The discussions were heated!! 

Second, the story about the origin of the bagel vis-a-vis a Jewish Viennese
baker's thanks to Sobieski for saving Vienna from the Turks has long been
discredited.  (That does not mean it is not true.  Only that one historian has
said it is a lot of baloney and no one has been able to beat him back, so, for
the moment, it's discredited.)  However, I can find no variation of this story
in which the honor of the invention is given to a Jewish baker.  On the
contrary, the story is given as a demonstration that the bagel is not a Jewish
invention despite its apparent genealogy based more on memory than on fact.

The story mentions that the "Croissant" or crescent roll was shaped in this
form to copy the basic geometry of the Turkish sword, which was crescent
shaped.  When Pilsudski defeated the Turks and returned victorious to Vienna,
the citizenry hung on to the stirrup of his horse (in German: Steigbugel) in
gratitude and a baker took the crescent roll shape, adjusted its geometry to
look like the stirrup of a horse, and gave it the name Steigbugel which
shortly became bugel, and then bagel. 

The rules are these: don't yell at me.  I didn't make up the story, I'm simply
repeating it and stating that, currently, it is a discredited one.  Personally
I find it a bit of a stretch, but who knows?  Crazier things have happened. 

But no where in the story is there any Jewish involvement with the great
invention.  And in any case, simply taking croissant dough and changing the
shape doth not a bagel make.  The dough is all wrong and the technique of
cooking radically different. 

Maybe someone on Mendele will remember the New York Times hassle over the
bagel's origins more precisely than I do. 

Here in California I am offered "jalapeno pepper bagels" which must be an
invention of the American Oral Surgery Institute because eating one of them
destroys all tissue in the mouth and mandates reconstructive surgery than can
cost a fortune.  We also have "pumpkin bagels,"  "chocolate chip bagels," and
others too insane to mention.
