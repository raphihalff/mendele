Subject: Director of Archives, YIVO Institute for Jewish Research

The YIVO Institute for Jewish Research invites applications and
nominations for the position of Director of the Archives.

The YIVO Institute for Jewish Research was established as the Yidisher
visnshaftlekher institut (Yiddish Scientific Institute) in Vilna,
Poland in 1925. Relocated to New York City in 1940, YIVO co-founded the
Center for Jewish History in 1995, and in 1999, became the first of
five Jewish research and cultural organizations to move into the
Center's new complex at 15 West 16th Street in Manhattan.

Collecting materials documenting the life and creativity of East
European Jewry has been a major focus of YIVO's mission since the
Institute's inception. The approximately 1,400 record groups that make
up the YIVO Archives occupy over 10,000 linear feet of shelf space and
consist of over 22,000,000 documents. These collections consist
predominantly of organizational records, manuscripts, correspondence,
and printed materials. The Archives also holds photographs, films,
videotapes, sound recordings, art works, and artifacts, most of which
have been organized into the following special collections: Music
Collections, Sound Archive, Photographic Archive, Film Archive, and Art
and Artifacts Collection. The primary languages of the documents are
Yiddish, English, Hebrew, Russian, Polish, French, and German. The
collections, while covering a wide range of topics relating to Jewish
history and culture around the world, concentrate on four main areas:
East European Jewish history; history of the Jews in the United States;
Yiddish language, literature, and culture; and the Holocaust. In 1992,
YIVO acquired the Bund Archives, one of the foremost Jewish collections
specializing in the history of the socialist and labor movements.

The Director of the Archives is responsible for the leadership and
management of the department and is charged with overseeing
accessioning, processing, cataloging, preservation, and access to
materials; supervising collection development, automation, and
preservation projects, and other initiatives designed to safeguard and
provide improved access to collections; initiating grants related to
archival needs and supervising their realization; and administering the
departmental budget. The Archives Director will lead a staff of 10 in
developing a shared vision for reference services and collection
development; overseeing the ongoing implementation and assessment of
initiatives that support that vision; analyzing and reshaping the
Archives' services and policies in response to the needs of YIVO's
clientele; and playing a leading role in Center-wide projects and
committees. He/she will also be expected to develop strategies for
increasing scholarly use of the collections and boosting public
awareness of the Archives.

The successful candidate will have demonstrated abilities in leadership
and fiscal management, at least 5 years administrative experience in a
research archives, proficiency in Yiddish, a reading knowledge of
Hebrew and a Slavic language, a background in East European Jewish
studies, and experience in processing manuscripts and other archival
materials. Familiarity with digital archives trends and developments is
preferred.  Availability as of September 1, 2001 is desired, if
possible. Salary and benefits are highly competitive.

Send nominations and letters of application to: Search and Screen
Committee c/o Dr. Carl J. Rheins, Executive Director YIVO Institute for
Jewish Research 15 West 16th Street New York, NY 10011-6301 FAX: (212)
292-1892

Applications will be reviewed until the position is filled. YIVO is an
EOE.

Subject: yiddish capitalization

When writing the title of a song in Yiddish transliterated to Roman
characters, does one capitalize every word or just the intitial letter
and personal or geographical names, or not even names?

Subject: Yiddish and the Spanish Civil War

Dear list members,

I am currently working on an MA thesis about Jewish volunteers who
fought in the Spanish civil war, specifically based on Yiddish sources.
I have started collecting materials and compiling a bibliography some
time ago and up till now found a number of interesting Yiddish sources.
I wonder if some people would be able to help with some specific
questions I have:

- In the Polish International Brigade there was a Jewish company called
Botwin, named after the Jewish Polish communist Naftali Botwin. The
company published its own newspaper, of which 5 issues were published.
The first of these were handwritten and if my information is correct
the very first was called Freiheits Kemfer. YIVO holds the last two
printed issues but up till now I have not been able to find information
on the whereabouts of the other issues.

- there was a journalist called Gina Medem (Vladimir Medem's wife) who
reported for a number of Yiddish newspapers from the front. I would be
interested to find out if she has left a personal archive and, if so,
where it might be kept.

I know these questions are quite detailed. Apart from them I would be
grateful for any suggestions and information on this very interesting
topic.

Kind regards,

Gerben Zaagsma
London, UK

[Moderator's note: several answers can be found in my posting in
Mendele 7.067:2 (Sep 1997). "Frayhayts Kemfer" preceded "Botvin": the
former was published from August 1937, the first issue of "Botvin" was
published in December 1937. Three Gina Medem's books might be of
interest: Los Judios voluntarios de la libertad un ano de lucha en las
Brigadas Internacionales, Madrid : Ediciones del Comisariado de las
Brigadas Internacionales, 1937; A lebensveg : oytobiografishe notitsn,
Nyu-York, G. Medem Bukh-Komitet, 1950; Lender, felker, kamfn, Nyu-York,
G. Medem Bukh-Komitet, 1963.

Subject: erben? erven? A word in a Bergelson story

I'm in the midst of transcribing Dovid Bergelson's "in a fargrebter
shtot" ("In a Backwoods Town") for Noyekh Miller (a notorious slave
driver, but I need the work) and the Onkelos project.

Chapter VI, paragraph three is:

          loyt ot dem neyem psak hot alishes fus nit getort
        kumen in boine arayn, un rekhenen hobn zikh di katsovim
        badarft nit mit im nor mit zeyer eygenem nomen, far
        velkhn der rov hot zikh geervt.

          [In keeping with this decision Elisha would have to
        stay out of the abattoir, while the butchers were held
        accountable not to him but to a representative appointed
        by the orthodox rabbi.
                (translator: Bernard Guilbert Guerney)]

The last word is the problem. It's probably geervt with a veys, not
geerbt (beys and veys are not distinguished in what is otherwise very
close to modern orthography). Noyekh's Wostok edition has it

     giml - ayin - komets ayin(!) - reysh - veys (or beys) - tes.

Neither ervn nor erbn (nor erven, erben) are in Weinreich, Harkavy, or
Stutchkoff.

Weinreich does have "erv zayn (far)" (ayin, reysh, veys) -- vouch or
answer (for), guarantee, underwrite (as does Harkavy), which is close
in meaning: "for whom the rabbi vouched (pledged himself)".

Any information (not excluding folk etymologies made up on the spot) on
this would be welcome. Is Bergelson just coining a nonce-word or has
this appeared elsewhere? The footnotes to the story and a forthcoming
glossary project need to know.

a dank.

Subject: Israel Medres

Your May 30th newsletter included a press release from Bernard Katz
about the 2001 Canadian Jewish Book Awards wherein he very kindly
suggested that my translation from the Yiddish of Montreal of Yesterday
by Israel Medres would be of special interest to subscribers of
Mendele.

Correcting the inadvertent misspelling of the name of the author (the
name is Medres, pronounced "medrish" as in "beys medrish"), has given
me the opportunity to provide some additional information about
Montreal fun Nekhtn, originally published in Yiddish in 1947.

For over forty years, from 1922 until his death in 1964, my
grandfather, Israel Medres, was a full-time staff writer for the
Montreal Yiddish daily, the Keneder Adler, contributing in numerous
capacities including news editor, labour editor, court reporter,
political affairs columnist,and felletonist.

In 55 short chapters, his book, Montreal of Yesterday, deals with every
aspect of Eastern European Jewish immigrant life in the period from
1900 to 1920, including where people worked, what they were reading,
Yiddish theatre and vaudeville, religious Jews, socialists, anarchists,
Zionism, courtship and marriage, trade unions and strikes, and the
defense of the Talmud in the Quebec Court of Appeal the same year as
the Beilis case in Imperial Russia.

The English translation of Montreal of Yesterday is available through
its Montreal publisher, Vehicule Press, at vehiculepress.com.

I am presently completing the translation into English of Medres'
second book, Tsvishn Tsvey Velt Milkhomes.

Subject: Sitting before Traveling

My husband's family has a custom that I have not seen elsewhere. Before
he or any other family member leaves the house for a long journey, his
mother and grandmother make the person leaving the house sit down on a
couch or chair and recite the following: "Mazl, glik, brokhe,
hatslokhe; mazl, glik, brokhe, hatstlokhe; mazl, glik, brokhe,
hatslokhe; forn gezunt un kumen gezunt; forn gezunt un kumen gezunt,
forn gezunt un kumen gezunt." Only then is the person allowed to get up
and leave the house. They are very meticulous about this.

I know what all the words mean, but I was just wondering if anyone has
ever seen or heard of this custom before, or knows anything about its
origins. If it is any help, my husband's grandmother is originally from
Slonim in Poland (now part of Belarus) and seems to have brought this
with her from there. Any information would be of interest to me.

Thanks,
Dara Horn Schulman
