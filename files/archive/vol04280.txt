Subject: Introduction/Glatshteyn

My name is Janet Hadda and I already know many of you.  I am a professor
of Yiddish at UCLA, a practicing psychoanalyst--and, I confess, a
Mendele lurker.  But I am encouraged to write now because of Dan Leeson's
request to know more about Yankev Glatshteyn, one of my great loves.

Glatshteyn (1896- 1971) was a founding member and theorist of the
literary group In Zikh, which flourished in New York during the 1920's
and 1930's. A native of Lublin, Poland, Glatshteyn immigrated to New York
in 1914 and spent the rest of his life there.  In addition to his poetry,
Glatshteyn wrote novels and was a prolific literary journalist.  He is
often remembered for his riveting Holocaust poetry, but he deserves
recognition as well for his vibrant exper- imentation with the Yiddish
language, which started in his days with the In Zikhistn (or Introspec-
tive Poets) but went far beyond those tenets.  I've written a book about
him (Yankev Glatshteyn, G.K. Hall, 1980) which details his poetic
development. My current work is a biography of Isaac Bashevis Singer and
I would welcome any first-hand anecdotes about meetings with him, etc.

Subject: Yaakev Glatshteyn

For Dan Leeson:

The poem about Mozart is to be found in _The Penguin Book of Modern
Yiddish Verse_ (1987) Ed. Howe, Wisse, & Shmeruk.  Biography on P.425,
poem on P.438(English), P.439(Yiddish).

Subject: a query and a note, on reading Glatshteyn's essay on Richard Wright

One answer to Dan Leeson's query re Glatshteyn is:  Glatshteyn was among
the greatest American Yiddish poets, and a great critic also. (For
another translation of the "Mozart" poem, by the way - which I also love
- see Cynthia Ozick's translation in the Penguin Anthology).

In any case, though, I was reading G's essay on Richard Wright (from _In
Tokh Genumen_, 1945-47).  Right at the beginning of the essay he says
that he became acquainted with the Negro problem when he was ten or
eleven. He says that through reading a certain book he "gave to the Negro
race eyes full of childlike tears."  My problem is in figuring out what
the book is that he means.  Transcribed, it would be "Kizshina Diadi
Toma." Does anyone know what this might be?  Later in the same paragraph,
he speaks of reading Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin in Hebrew - is "Kizshina
etc." the same book in a different language?

That's my query.  My note concerns a remark he makes that I found
interesting, and thought others might too. G says that "Tom in Hebrew was
for me heymisher and closer;  the Hebrew meaning [and the Yiddish one
too, hence my posting here] of his name made him an ish tsadik tamim."
So Uncle Tom becomes an ancestor of Singer's Gimpl Tam, I guess.

Subject: Mendele un Gogol

Soon I will be writing my undergraduate thesis and I thought a good theme
would be to compare the degree of satirical bite in the works of Mendele
Moykher Sforim and Nikolai Gogol', and how each were received by the
public for whom they wrote.  I am now at the earliest stages of research,
and I would greatly appreciate any reference to articles or books anyone
might be able to give me.

A sheynem dank!

Subject: Kenen and konen

Yiddish doesn't seem to distinguish these words. Where they cooccur in
someone's speech, they are, possibly, chronological variants. Still to be
mapped but, my _khush_ tells me that _konen_, is most persistent in the
Northeast, although even there it may be/have been passing into
obsolescence.

In other words, both can serve to mean 'to be acquainted with' and 'to be
able'. As you might guess, a problem for Yiddish speakers learning German
(on a par with some of the other modals).

Subject: Kenen and konen

Peter Klues brought up the question of kenen and konen. If I were a pro-
fessional linguist I'd have the word for the phenomenon occurring here at
my finger tips, but I don't, so someone help me out and give the
linguistic term for this.

What's happened is that in German you have:

1) Ich kann        1) Wir koennen
2) Du kannst       2) Ihr koennt
3) Er kann         3) Sie koennen

In an attempt to regularize the conjugation, one speech group has
regularized the conjugation totally in favor of Konen, so you have Ikh
kon and Mir konen. In the standard taught in College Yiddish, the
conjugation has regularized itself toward kenen. There is also the German
kennen, which means "To know, to be acquainted with". The 3rd singular is
"er kennt". In Yiddish the verb is "kenen". The conjugations are
different, though, in the 3rd singular, where "er ken" means he can, and
"er kent" means he knows. So strong, though, is the attraction of the two
verbs, that one sometimes sees "er ken" meaning he knows.

Other examples are ton/tin, where the verbs have "migrated" toward
harmony and consistency not found in the older language.

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but I've always associated
"konen" with Polish Yiddish, and "kenen" with (at least) Northeastern
Yiddish, and that like nit/nisht, either is correct in the klal shprakh.

I hope this helps.

Rick Gildemeister

P.S. I'd like to interject that I'm not a linguist/scholar but I'm a
widely read lover of language, and I was able to answer the query, using
non-technical terms. If anything, I really *want* the scholars' input.
This is an academic language and literature list and I need to be careful
not to swim in shallow waters and steer people in the wrong direction. I
learn a lot from the khakhomim. I liked Ellen Prince's discussion of
"clitic" because it really tied the loose ends of the "zhe" frage
together very well.
