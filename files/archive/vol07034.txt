Subject: NYBC responds; Blimelekh

To their credit, I had a very nice e-mail note from the editor of the Pakn
Treger regarding my recent complaints about their non-responsiveness to
queries.  Perhaps e-mail is the only way to get results these days.  Anyway,
am glad they're trying and hope they get their act together---they may not
be a scholarly organization like YIVO, as their editor argues, but they
still have the obligation to be an information resource, esp. for their own
members, IMHO.  

An unrelated question. I friend of mine, a non-Jew who grew up in Chicago in
the '40s, reports hearing his native Yiddish speaking boss referring to gay
men as "blimelkh."  Does anyone recall having heard this locution?

[English summary of the above:]

For those who understand about Jewish life in Eastern Europe, -- and
especially for those who don't, -- I would like to recommend the
new book by Dr. Heszel Klepfisz "der kval far doyres == The Inexhaustible
Wellspring". [- Author's translation in the inner book cover. I would
have translated this as: "The Wellspring for Generations". All further
translations are mine. L.B.]

In the 600 pages of essays, he brings the past alive, and unites it to
the present as a guide for the future.

In the introduction, Dr. Klepfisz tells us why he returns again and again
to the same topic of Eastern European Jewish civilization: "... because it
is terrifyingly silent around this theme". We see this with respect to 
Yiddish language and culture, as well.

In the 61 essays, he presents us with all-encompassing themes including:
"Shmuel Ziglboym, The Son of Polish Jewry", "In the Footsteps of Reb
Nakhman of Bratslav", "Nisn, the Month of Anticipation in Jewish
Eastern European", "From Legend to Reality: Sore Bas-Toyvim", and others.
He includes an 8 page crossreference to all the personalities mentioned
in the essays.

Although I haven't read all the essays, each will surely satiate the
reader. Each will also tickle the palette and the reader will surely come
back for more. Such are the precious gems of Dr. Klepfisz, which I have
been reading for many years in the Yiddish press, and which I've also
clipped out and saved.

As an example, if we should look into the very first essay "Paper Bridges
Stronger than Steel and Iron", we see how life-sustainingly important
the Jewish book was for Ashkenazic Jewry. Heirs would often fight long
and bitterly to gain possession of a deceased parent's book collection.
We read this today, and watch as good Yiddish and Jewish books are
thrown out in the streets with the garbage...

Yes we may learn a lot from Dr. Klepfisz' essays written in Yiddish, in
the language of Eastern European Jewry. In fact, this is one more good
reason to learn Yiddish, for those who don't (yet) know. And for those
that do know, this book is truly a wellspring for the thirsty among us.

Subject: 'regional accent' 

Miriam Isaacs writes in [Vol 7.026]:

>tapes of Dzigan, the Yiddish comedian. He is funny and speaks with a
>wonderful regional accent that you need to listen to - balancing out the
>Standard, which often lacks some of the fun and musicality of Yiddish.

I can't believe I am reading this! How can you call the pronunciation of
Yiddish in the Polish/W Galician manner- the most popular pronuciation of
Yiddish both in the interwar years and nowadays- as 'regional' ?  You might
as well call my London pronunciation of English 'regional'.

It may not be the YIVO Standard, but it can hardly be called regional.

Subject: future of Yiddish

If in the l940s and l950s--and perhaps a decade earlier--any serious 
student of Yiddish had  the courage to consider the future of Yiddish, and to
draw the right conclusions, he or she would have had to close shop and turn to
other pursuits and avocations.  You need not have been endowed with prophetic
powers in the late l950s to know that whatever path Yiddish might take, it 
would not be back  to the vibrant world of  the late l9th and especially the 
first half of the twentieth century.   Cozy reassurances from various 
platforms such as the Congress of Jewish Culture or the regular Third 
Seders of the Workmen's Circle Schools or in the pages of DER TOG or 
FORVERTS , or at yearly concerts of various left-wing mandolin orchestras 
were de rigeur, but I suspect that even those who desperately cherished 
such beliefs  found it in  their hearts of hearts rather difficult to 
sustain them.  (On a personal note, I might  observe that during all 
those years of my own Yiddish activities--YUGNTRUF, "Boiberik," directing 
and participating in Yiddish plays, etc.--  I knew at most six young  
people born in the United States who spoke Yiddish altogether freely.)  
It's not that most of us succumbed to wishful thinking (though of course 
there was some of it around), but simply because we were willing to 
suspend our doubts and soldier on.   And also because we loved doing what 
we did.

The same goes for the Uriel and  Bea Weinreich "Say It in Yiddish" booklet.  
I doubt if they ever entertained the  hope that some itinerant American 
Jew, armed with the booklet and finding himself, say, in Rome or Stockholm or 
Kyoto would stop a passer-by and ask "zogt mir, reb id, vu ken ikh do 
koyfn a funt kartofl?," or, in the port, "vifl an erakh kost a shifskarte
keyn honolulu?'  They composed the booklet not as a guide to thousands of
travelers throughout the world, but simply to confirm the fact that Yiddish 
was a modern llanguage MIT  ANDERE TSUGLAYKH,  that it merits respect and 
not only Leo Rosten humoresques, and that it shoulkd remain a work  perhaps 
for other DOYRES to discover and remember.  All other speculations, anathemas` 
and pilpul can be safely put to rest.

From: Hugh Denman <h_denman@maier.vol.at>
Subject: Birnbaum's _Yiddish Phrase Book_

Our shames is, of course, quite right that more than enough has been said on
the topic of the Weinreich phrase-book recently. However, before the
discussion is definitively brought to a close, I think Mendelyaner should
know that, pace Dover and one of the contributors to the discussion, Uriel
and Beatrice Weinreich, _Say It in Yiddish_ was NOT "the first extensive
serious phrase book ever compiled for Yiddish". Sitting next to it on my
shelf is: Solomon A. Birnbaum, _Yiddish Phrase Book_, [London]: Linguaphone
Institute and The Jewish Committee for Relief Abroad, [1945], 87 pp.
Birnbaum's book has about half the number of pages of that by the
Weinreichs, but since the phrases are in transcription only he manages to
get about twice as much material onto the page, so that the book is just as
extensive and is most certainly serious. As one would expect from Birnbaum,
the transcription system (supposedly for the untutored layman) is
rebarbative in appearance and hard to use, but, once penetrated, accurate
and "interdialectal", i.e. capable of being read both in poylish and litvish
yidish. The immediate purpose of publication was to help relief workers
communicate with Holocaust survivors and the phraseology offered is sober
and practical in character without any casinos, airports or golf clubs.
Despite the involvement of Linguaphone there is no mention of there ever
having been an accompanying grammophone record. Transcribed back into
yidishe oysyes it could still be useful for learners today. I suspect it was
never very widely distributed and that not only Dover but also the
Weinreichs were unaware of its existence in 1958.
