Subject: re: "feygelekh"

If it makes any difference, I asked my grandmother, who shtams from
Poland (near the Russian border) and spent WWII in Siberia, came to
the US after the war....Anyway, she swears that she knew the word
feygle for homosexuals in Poland..but that's my grandmother.

Also, re. an earlier entry: In Hebrew there exits (EXISTS) a slang
word "parpar" for homosexuals, meaning butterfly.....

Subject: musz/darf

Michael Shimshoni posted a question a few days ago concerning the
use of "musz" as opposed to "darf" to mean "must."  I haven't seen
any response yet.

That's a question about which I have also wondered.  If I am not
mistaken, I have heard the song "Jome, Jome" use "Musz men gehen,
dem whatever sogn," as well as "darf men gehen, ... ."

My theory is that "musz" is, how you say in Englisch,
"Umgangssprache," that is, not exactly sng, but more everday usage.

What do you folks think?

Subject: Yiddish in _Bridges_

Hello to all Mendele subscribers!  I just joined this list and would
like to introduce myself and my work.  I am the Managing Editor of
*Bridges: A Journal for Jewish Feminists and Our Friends*

Bridges is unique in several ways: it is the only contemporary
feminist publication to publish Yiddish, and its in-depth articles
and serious literature on Jewish topics are interesting and
accessible to people immersed in Jewish study, and to non-academics
and non-Jews alike.  Bridges places equal emphasis on activism for
social justice, feminism and Jewish identity and continuity. Irena
Klepfisz is Bridges' Editorial Consultant on Yiddish Language and
Culture.  The Yiddish in Bridges is typeset by Lorin Sklamberg.

Below is a description of the Yiddish we have published to date (all
back issues are still available):

Volume 1 Number 2 (Fall 1990)

Yente Serdatsky's short story "Vide/Confession" The story, in
Yiddish, is nine pages, the translation by Irena Klepfisz, is five
pages. It originally appeared in Serdatsky's 1913 collection
Geklibene shriftn (Collected Writings).  Kelpfisz introduces the
story with biographical information and commentary on the text.

Volume 2 Number 1 (Spring 1991)

Kadya Molodowsky, 4 poems,(Dzshike Gas/Dzshike Street;
Khronik/Chronicle,1932; Mayn Papirene Brik/My Paper Bridge,1930; and
Briv fun Geto/Letters from the Ghetto, 1941).  These poems are
published in Yiddish *and* transliteration with English translations
by Kathryn Hellerstein.

Abraham Sutzkever's poem "Etele mayn shvester/My Sister Ethel"
English translation by Ruth Whitman

Volume 2 Number 2 (Fall 1991)

Irena Klepfisz' "Bread and Candy: Songs of the Holocaust," a drama
for five voices with 18 songs in Yiddish, English, transliteration
and notation.

Volume 3 Number 2 (Spring 1993)

Blume Lempel's "Scenes on a Bare Canvas" from her 1981 collection A
rege fun emes/A Moment of Truth.  The story in Yiddish is eight
pages, the translation by Sheva Zucker is five pages.

Volume 4 Number 1

"Di mames dos loshn/The Mothers, the Language: Feminism, Yiddishkayt
and the Politics of Memory"

In this essay, Klepfisz focuses on the memoirs, diaries, stories,
and essays of four Eastern European women who committed their lives
to Jewish continuity through the Yiddish language.  Sore Shenirer,
an Orthodox educator; Ane Heller Rozenthal, leader in the Jewish
Workers Bund; Gina Medem, Bundist and later Communist; and poet,
writer, editor Kadya Molodowsky each wrote, in Yiddish, about their
commitments, values, and experiences as Jewish women.  In "Di mames,
dos loshn," Klepfisz translates from their writings (excerpts are
published in Yiddish with translation) and relates their work and
commitments to contemporary Jewish issues. The article includes
several photos from YIVO archives.

Subject: Shprintsaleahs

I offer the follow solution to the term "shprintsaleahs" meaning "a
princess."

First, in our usage it was pejorative, something akin to the
recently discredited Jewish American Princess.

Second, I was informed that its origin is derived from the purported
superior behavior of Sephardic Jews.  (Please note that I said
"purported" since I am not in agreement that Sephardic Jews behaved
in this fashion.) But why Shprintsaleah?  Because, the name thought
to be Yiddish in origin (i.e., "shprintsa") was actually derived
from the Spanish, "Esperanza."  Thus the connection.  The "Leah"
attachment is unknown to me but may be related to the Southern
American habit of giving everyone two names: Jimmy Bob, and Ellie
Sue.

But the Esperanza/Shprintsa has an interesting background.
According to Ben Zion Kaganoff's Dictionary of Jewish Names, a
number of Yiddish names are so derived.  He says, "In the middle
ages, Jews coined new Hebrew names even for their daughters.  This
was truer of Italian Jews and in Sephardic communities than for
Ashkenasim...  A number of Italian and French names that Jews have
used are not immediately recognizable because they have been
filtered through Yiddish...  Who would ever guess that Schprinzel is
a Polish Jewish 'improvement' on Esperanza brought east by Italian
Jews?  It was a regular practice for the Jews of Italy to translate
the Hebrew 'tikvah' into Esperanza.  The name became 'Esperance'
among the French Jews and was transformed into Sprinze as it moved
through Germany and Poland."
