Many thanks to Mikhl Herzog for clarifying the difference
between "broygez" and "in ka(a)s."   Types of naronim were
wonderful.  Here is an addition to the trolley car in
"bukh": zol essen nickels und cocken trahnsfers.  I owe
this to my cousin Helen Schneyer.  A relative once shouted
to an asssimilated Jewish woman the following in English --
I'm sure it's a translation: "Nothing perso- nal,  but if
you lived out the rest of your life today, I wouldn't
mind."  Can anyone supply the Yiddish version?

I think Shames Noyekh is right about /kloks/ as a
mishearing of /klog/ in what may have been to begin with /a
klog tsu Kelombes/ 'Woe to Columbus." Perhaps this was the
process. My English-speaking friend, or maybe his
grandmother, devoiced the /g/ in /klog/ by assimilation to
the voiceless affricate in /tsu/. With a weak stress on
the latter,the vowel may have been so reduced that our
English speaker, not really knowing Yiddish, made the wrong
word-break, yielding /klokts/, which was then simplified by
the dropping of the /t/, yielding /kloks/ as an
idiosyncratic neologism. Having unknowingnly created this
distortion, he then chose another preposition, /af/ 'upon',
to put after it. If some such explanation is right, it
supports my memory of my childhood experience. I wonder
what a Yiddish linguist like Mikhl Herzog would say about
this. By the way, a quick look at home early this morning
showed /klog/ to be feminine in the Weinreich dictionary
but masculine in Harkavy! The latter gives a number of
examples of its use.    Aren
