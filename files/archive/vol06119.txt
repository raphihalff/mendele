Subject: A second language in the home

regarding a second language in the home:  it's very difficult to bring
up children in a language that differs from that of the local tongue and
the dominant culture.  nevertheless it can be done, and while my own
experience was obviously not typical, it does point out
possibilities....

being viennese, my parents always spoke german to one another and to me,
while we were living in rio de janeiro and then in the u.s.a.  it never
occurred to us to speak any other language to one another, and my
parents also had a small number of german-speaking friends, so that I
heard the language from others as well.

in addition, there were thousands of german books around the house (as
well as in other languages including yiddish) so that I learned how to
read german around the same time that I learned how to read english.

equally important were two attitude factors:  we took german for granted
as our language and never made a political issue of it--just as certain
chasidic groups take yiddish for granted, speak it as a matter of course
and don't bother with endless conferences on the survival of yiddish.
furthermore despite the horrors of the fascist era (including the period
of austro-fascism leading up to the nazi era) my parents had a profound
respect for german and for (at least liberal) german/austrian
culture--if for no other reason than the vast extent of jewish culture
that has been expressed in german.  in addition, they were highly
educated in german--my father was a district attorney in vienna's
juvenile court and my mother a poet and a french teacher (she also knew
polish and yiddish, but not fluently).  this love of language(s) and
their culture had a profound effect on me as I grew up in nyc, and it
would have been very hard for me _not_ to be bilingual.

i suspect that one of the myriad reasons that may prevent children from
learning their parents' "foreign language" is the lack of respect that
parents have for their own language--while they may love it, they view
it as an economic albatros.....

and then too, there is the flip side of bringing children up as
bilingual:  my parents always spoke a wretched english.  it was so
horrifyingly caricatural that i refused to speak anything but german to
them.....

this way i've never had to get a job, i just stay home, translate great
books, and watch movies....

Subject: Sholem Aleykhem's Language(s)

I am indebted to Ellen Prince and Louis Fridhandler [6.117], and
especially to the latter, for sharing their insight and understanding of
Sholem Aley- khem's situation and milieu.  I found my previous
astonishment fading rapidly away as I read their explanations.  The
logic is inescapable...

Ober, ikh hob nokh a kleynitchke shtokh of'n linkn oyer vos vundert zikh
az efsher hot Sholem nisht gehat zeyer a feynem eyndenkung fun di masen
vos hobn gelezen (un gekoyft) zayn shraybn.

Subject: Sholem Aleykhem's Language(s)

Ellen Prince's observations are (as usual) to the point. I can add to
her Yiddish(ist) "trivia" the fact that as prominent a Yiddish writer as
Zalman Shneour was in his time, neither of his children, whom I know
very well, speak a word of Yiddish.

With regard to Louis Fridhandler's valuable observations, I find it hard
to believe that Sholem Alaykhem could have said that Israel Zangwill
could not understand Yiddish, but if he did he must have been mistaken.
In discussing the "enormous literary and journalistic activity of
Yiddish" he cites names known to all of us and says, "But we scarcely
need their pictures of a highly differentiated existence to convince us
of the peculiar flavour of Jewish life. Yiddish is its own proof ...
Theirs was a life or rich differences from the environment, and if no
other evidence of this difference remained, the Yiddish vocabulary,
phrases, locutions, proverbs, bywords are sufficient proof of it". I see
no reason to quote him at at further length: what he had to say can be
found in The Voice of Jerusalem (New York, Macmillan, 1921) pg. 259.

Also, I seem to recall reading that Zangwill found the Yiddish
translations of the Shabbos zmiros used in siddurim designed for women
so abominable that he wrote new translations of his own which are (or
were) widely printed. Perhaps someone can comment on this.
