Subject: Influence of Yiddish on Modern Hebrew

I am a PhD student in the Linguistics Dept. at UPenn, working among other
things on the semantics of Modern Hebrew.

I am working on a phenomenon which was apparently borrowed into Hebrew from
Russian and/or Yiddish, and so I'd like to get the opinion of native
Yiddish speakers on this phenomenon in their language.

If you are a native speaker of Yiddish, I'd be very grateful if you could
translate into Yiddish the 4 Hebrew sentences below (which I provide a
gloss and English translation for) and answer the short questions following
the sentences. It's really very simple and shouldn't take more than a few
minutes of your time. You are obviously more then welcome to write me if
you have any questions or comments at eilamavi@babel.ling.upenn.edu

(1) dani yamshix lishon ad she-ha-mesiba lo tatxil
     danny will.continue to.sleep until that-the-party NEG will.start
     'Danny will continue sleeping until the party starts.'
     =>Is negation in the until-clause obligatory in this case?

(2) dani lo yishan ad she-ha-mesiba lo tatxil
     danny NEG will.sleep until that-the-party NEG will.start
     'Danny will not sleep until the party starts.'
     =>Is negation in the until-clause obligatory in this case?

(3) ma she-lo tixtov yikalel ba-sefer
     what that-NEG you.write will.be.included in.the-book
     'Whatever you write will be included in the book.'
     =>Is negation obligatory in this case?

(4) a. ma asiti etmol!
        what I.did yesterday
        'The thing I did yesterday!'
     b. ma lo  asiti etmol!
        what NEG I.did yesterday
        'The things I did yesterday!'
     =>Does Yiddish have counterparts for both (a) and (b)?
     =>If so, do you get the difference in meaning as in Hebrew, i.e., (a)
       expresses surprise at the identity of something while (b) surprise at
       the quantity?

Thanks in advance,
Aviad Eilam

Subject: petsha

Just to add what was already posted about petsha:

I am working on my late mother's book recipe writings from over 25 years in
Canada and here is the family recipe for petsha -- (Russian  origin).  I do
remember that my father, who was Rumanian, preferred it with vinegar so she
would make both.

1 calf's foot or feet from about 6 chickens
1 onion
whole head of garlic
1 bay leaf
1/2 tsp. peppercorns
salt to pepper to taste
2 Tbsp. lemon juice
2 hard boiled eggs

Chop the feet in several pieces and clean well.
Peel and slice onion. Chop garlic. Place foot, onion, garlic, bay leaf, and
peppercorns into a pan. Cover with cold water. Simmer for about 3 hours
until the meat drops off the bones. (In a pressure cooker it will take
about an hour).  Remove the meat and cut into small pieces. Strain the
liquid. Add the lemon juice and adjust the seasoning as required and mix
with the meat.   Pour into a shallow dish, add slices of eggs and when cool
place in refrigerator at least over night.

Happy eating,
Yehudit Permut

Subject:  petsha

My mother, who came to the US as a child of 7, made petsha once or twice,
and served it hot, as a soup, not chilled and jelled. In my home, as in
David Spodick?s, it was a one- syllable word. I liked it hot, but could
never stomach it cold, as it is usually served. In Israel one still sees it
for sale, with sliced hard-boiled eggs embedded in it. As a soup it had the
consistency of chicken soup, although greasier, with bits of meat and
vegetables in it. And definitely made from calves? feet, not cows?.

Subject: Etymologies and meanings

For what it's worth:

1) Amitai Halevi writes: "I recall a suggestion that "petsha" may be a
corruption of the French "pied chaud" (heated foot), just as "cholent" is
derived from "chaud lent" (slowly heated).

As it happens, "tsholnt" does not derive from "chaud lent"; a more likely
etymology is the one proposed by Max Weinreich in his History of the
Yiddish Language (a full English translation of which will be published
later this year by YIVO and Yale University Press): Latin "calentem"
'(approx.) being heated'. To prove that "petsha" derives from "pied chaud,"
you would have to explain, for example, why the final /o/ sound in French
yields /a/ in Yiddish. You cannot ascertain an etymology merely from a
chance phonetic resemblance.

2) Jack Berger writes in reference to idioms in a yizker-bukh: A) A 'yold'
is a lout, or rude, unmannered individual. This comment could be applied to
anyone who was acting in a manner deemed unruly by the speaker.

While "yold" may mean that, a more common meaning is the one given by Uriel
Weinreich in his dictionary: 'chump, sucker.' There is also the meaning
used by criminals: 'straight,' i.e., someone who is not a criminal.

B) "Khotsh nem im un shnayd im op fun shtrikl. Literal meaning is clear,
but I am unfamiliar with the idiomatic use."

"Khotsh" in this case means 'you might as well.' The example in the Uriel
Weinreich dictionary: "S'iz shlekht khotsh zets zikh un veyn" 'it is so bad
one might as well sit down and cry.'

C) "[nisht far keynem fun di mendelyaner gezogt!]. Bob [Rothstein] should
say gedakht instead of gezogt."

Bob may have mixed two expressions: "nisht far ... Gedakht" and "af mir
gezogt (gevorn)."

Subject: loksh

  From Philadelphia days, I recall the term "loksh," for an Italian
(possibly pejorative?). Pardon the folk etymology, but is it related to
"lokshn" (noodles), as in "lokshn kugel"? Also, the alternative [was]
"taleyne."  And yes, [we used] "gedule,? but a "big deal" was usually a
"gantse gedule."

Subject: jaundice

I need clarification of the Yiddish word for "jaundice."  I rely heavily on
Uriel Weinreich for such help but in this case there is a discrepancy:  In
the English section of Weinreich, "jaundice" is listed as a two-word
feminine noun gele zokh.  In the Yiddish section, on page 671, gele zokh is
not to be found but the one-word noun gelzukht is listed as "jaundice."  I
would be grateful to anyone who can offer an explanation of this
inconsistency.

If I may be allowed a follow-up inquiry - can anyone help me out with
"jaundiced?" That's the word I really need and it's neither in the English
nor Yiddish section of Weinreich.

Subject: Naylebn

I wonder if anyone on this list can answer this query: the pro-Soviet ICOR
magazine Naylebn (New Life) published two issues in 1941 prior to the
Nazi invasion of the USSR. They were Vol. 15, Nos. 1 and 2. Does anyone
have them and, if so, in what months were these two issues published?

Subject: The Forverts

Re:  Rachel Rojanski's "A Neon Sign Overlooking the Manhattan Bridge," a
few corrections:

Today the Yiddish Forverts weekly continues to be published.  It is _not_
"part of" the English-language Forward's internet edition.  [I should note
that the English-language Forward appears in print as well as online -
online at http://www.forward.com ]

On the left-side of the web version of the English edition _is_ a link [no
pun intended] to the web version of the Yiddish edition - which can be
found at http://yiddish.forward.com/

The online - not cybernetic - version of the English edition of this
century-plus-ten old periodical (see http://www.forward.com) is indeed
attractively designed.  And the print version is indeed well written and
intellectually in the tradition of its namesake.  The Yiddish edition
appears to be quite well-designed, much better in print form than on the
web.  Interested individuals should write for a sample print copy and
compare the two. [Yiddish Forvarts, 45 East 33rd Street, new York NY 10016]

The short-lived Russian edition of the Forward was sold in I believe 2004,
and not long thereafter ceased publication.
