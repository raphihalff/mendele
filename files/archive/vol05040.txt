Subject: A query about a Hebrew-Yiddish prayerbook

An acquaintance of mine gave me this interlinear Hebrew-Yiddish
prayer-book;  it's copyrighted "Washington, Feb., 1904, by Joseph Magil,"
but the full title is (please forgive or correct transliteration errors),
Yosef Magilnitskis ferlag lvatey sefer vlaam, Folshtendiger linien-sidur
. . . . ale tfilot [Hebrew spelling, with nekudot - in fact, everything,
even the straight Yiddish, has nekudot] kseder fir a gants yohr.  There's
an introduction in Yiddish (without nekudot, finally), and then the book
begins - phrase by phrase, so you get:

modeh ani	ikh dank
lfanekha        far dir
melekh		kenig
Hai		lebender

And so on.

So I was wondering - is this a common sort of book, and what tradition
does it come out of, and who would have used it, and so on? A sheynem
dank,

Larry Rosenwald

I don't know what the plural of yetser is, but I'm quite sure that it
isn't 'yoitsres'.  Yoitsres (sing. yoitser) are the piyutim inserted into
khazoras ha-sha"tz (the repetition of shmonesre by the khazn) on yontif
and other important days, such as shabes shire, shabes zokhor, purim, and
shabes hagodel.

These piyutim are usually about the special occasions on which they are
said, and most are written in a very difficult poetic style.  Since
almost noone understands them, they're usually mumbled quickly, or
skipped over altogether.  (The Vilna Gaon was a strong opponent of their
use, and actively campaigned to have them removed.  Outside the khsidishe
world, he was mostly successful;  the exceptions are Rosheshone, Yom
Kipur, the first musef of Pesach and musef of Shmini Atzeres, when almost
all Orthodox shuls say them, though many skip some parts.)

In those shuls where yoitsres are said, since the khazn usually doesn't
understand them, it's easy for him to make a mistake and say the wrong
one, embarassing himself publicly (if anybody notices :-);  hence the
phrase 'fardreyen di yoitsres'.  I have heard it used, but I can't
remember if denotes making a fool out of oneself in  public, or making an
understandable mistake, one that anyone could make.  The usage which
Mottel mentioned (in arguments, when one got fed up with the demands and
assertions of the other,) sounds strange to me.  Maybe this is another
one of those expressions which is used differently by different people;
anyone else familiar with it?

To go into etymology:  There are piyutim for birkhes kriyas shma [the
brokhes before and after the shma] for both mayriv and shakhris, as well
as for khazoras hasha"tz of shakhris and musef.  The piyutim for birkhes
kriyas shma are said in even fewer shuls than the piyutim for khazoras
ha-sha"tz, and can only be found in some makhzoyrim.

The first brokhe before kriyas shma in mayriv is called 'ha-ma'ariv
arovim'; the piyutim for mayriv are called "ma'aroviyoys" (which
technically means 'Western ones') after the brokhe.

The first brokhe before kriyas shma in shakhris is called 'yoytser
ha-m'oyroys'; the piyutim for shakhris, and by extension, for khazoras
ha-sha"tz, are called "yoitsres" after the brokhe.

The piyut for khazoras ha-sha"tz of Purim (the only piyut for a weekday)
is called "Kroyvets L'Purim".  "Kroyvtes" is spelled kuf-reish-
vov-beis-endetsadik, and is a corruption of the Hebrew word 'kroyvoys'
(close ones);  I was once told why Purim's piyut has a separate name, but
I have since forgotten the explanation.  Does anyone out there know?

(I don't know if "ma'aroviyoys" and "kroyvets" can be considered Yiddish
words;  they're used by Ashkenazim only, but unlike "yoitsres", they
haven't parts of Yiddish idioms.  Has anyone prescribed some way of
deciding?)

Subject: Lakhn mit yashtsherkes

For Norman Savitt:  In vol. 1, no. 208 (April 6, 1992) of Mendele I
posted a comment on the Yiddish expression _lakhn mit yashtsherkes_,
suggesting a possible connection with a Belorussian folktale about a
peasant and a lizard.  That issue should be retrievable from the Mendele
archive.

Subject: Vayte kroyvim

What Chane Honig remembers as "vi a ferd's fus putkevas eynikl" (5.038)
is given by Nahum Stutchkoff (in his _Oytser fun der yidisher shprakh_)
as "ferds fus podkeves eynikl," i.e., "horse's foot horseshoe's
grandchild" (cf. Russian _podkova_, Polish _podkowa_ 'horseshoe').
Stutchkoff lists several other expressions for distant relatives:

		1. ferds baytshs shtekele(s podkeve)
		   horse's whip's stick('s horseshoe)

		2. kus baytshs ferds shtekele
		   cow's whip's horse's stick

		3. ferds fus podkeves eynikls nogl/tshvekl
		   horse's foot horseshoe's grandchild's nail

		4. ferds fus podkeves tshvekls kepl
		   horse's foot horseshoe's nail's head

		5. Mayn zeydns hon hot in zayn bobns hoyf
	 	 arayngekrey(e)t.
		   My grandfather's rooster crowed into his
		 grandfather's yard.

		6. Mayn ferds baytshs shtekele iz geven bay zayn
		 zeydns vogn a flekele.
		   My horse's whip's stick was a peg in his grand-
		 father's wagon.

		7. Mayn bobe un zayn zeyde lign in dr'erd ale beyde.
		   My grandmother and his grandfather are both dead and
		 buried.

		8. Er meynt, az shmelke iz zayn feter, un ikh meyn,
		 az shmelke iz mayn feter.
		   He thinks that Shmelke is his uncle, and I think that
		 Shmelke is my uncle.

		9. Es blaybt in der mishpokhe.
		   It remains in the family.

Subject: The word "vinkl"

A student asked me about the usage of the word "vinkl" to connote a group
of people meeting together (ie., a club).  He is interested in
how/when/why this usage became acceptable, if it has been accepted for a
long time, if it is slang-ish, etc....I answered him as best I could but
am certain that many of you are more equiped to answer him well.  I would
appreciate any useful information. a dank in faroys,

Subject: Teaching Yiddish to children

Many long years ago when I was a pupil in the Hebrew school of our
synagogue, the handsome young man who was our teacher said: "Since you
already know how to read Hebrew, I will teach you how to read Yiddish."
And he did.  I recently experimented with teaching my 10-year old
grandson to read Yiddish, since he already could read Hebrew.  This
worked so well that I am considering the possibility of teaching a small
group of pupils in our temple's school to read Yiddish if they already
know how to read Hebrew.  Has anyone in Mendele-land had any experience
along this line? Also, I am looking for suitable reading materials.  I
believe there is a publisher by the name of "Kinderbukhs", or something
like that.  If anyone has an address for this publisher, I would like to
make contact. A sheynem dank in foroys.
