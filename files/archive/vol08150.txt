Subject: quasi Middle High German

I would like to thank Vulf Plotkin (Vol. 08.148) for his contribution to the
discussion, but the question of "quasi Middle High German" is not one of
language origins but one of editing practices. More specifically, it is a
question concerning the use of transcription. 

For the transcription of Modern Yiddish most of us use the YIVO system, even
though we know full well that the klal-aroysreyd is usually far removed from
the dialect in which a text was written. Nobody will be surprised to find
out that this standardized form of Eastern Yiddish is not suitable for Old
and Middle Yiddish texts. Of course one can decide to do without
transcription, and that is what we usually do since most texts are only
available in the form of manuscripts or period editions, usually via
microfiche. 

In the case of text editions without transcription, an introduction on the
phonology of the text in question would be helpful since texts are written
in different dialects and the orthography is full of variants and apparent
inconsistencies which are often hard to interpret. A transcription also
fulfills this purpose and can be used as an aide for reading a text in the
original, which is a great service to students and scholars of Yiddish. It
has the added advantage of making the text available to those who are
interested but don't have the opportunity to study Middle Yiddish language
and literature. 

I agree with Jerold Frakes that transcription of older Yiddish texts should
not adapt the text to the norms set for standardized Middle High German (or
to other external norms, including 20th century klal-yidish). I also believe
that the transcription of the text under discussion, _Pariz un Vyene_, only
interprets those elements open to interpretation (mainly the pronunciation
of vowels) and clearly indicates where this is the case. It does so based on
all the information which can be gleaned from the text itself and a thorough
knowledge of Yiddish phonology. This is a transcription which is adapted to
the text and not the other way round. Of course there are always fine points
of interpretation on which opinions will differ. 

Personally, I would not read a whole text in transcription, but I appreciate
and eagerly profit from the fact that someone else has put a lot of work in
tackling the puzzle that nearly every text is and lets me, the reader, share
the results. 

Since the transcription system for Older Yiddish texts was developed in
Germany, this system is closer to current German orthography than the YIVO
system, which was devised for speakers of English. I can't see what the
connection to Middle High German with relation to this text is, other than
that the text itself brings to mind words and expressions which also occur
in MHG, and some of the footnotes refer to it -- just like others refer to
Italian, Hebrew and modern Yiddish.

Subject: Judendeutsch -- Western Yiddish?

Apropos various recent postings regarding Yiddish and German, the April 12th
New Yorker has a story on the Oxford Scottish historian, Niall Ferguson -- a
Thatcher-type conservative who has published a new book blaming England in
large measure for WWI.  Earlier he did a history of the Rothschilds and of
it the article says: 

  "...much of the material was in Judendeutsch, an archaic form of 
   German written in Hebrew script, which the Rothschilds used to
   encode their missives."

Ferguson hired someone to translate this material rather than having to
learn the unknown (to him) alphabet. 
 
Is this a somewhat back-handed way of describing Western Yiddish?  And
denying Yiddish "status" as a language?  That is, did the Rothschilds use
Yiddish?

Subject: Strasbourg

To Elanor Reiter and her wonderful post on her visit to Strasbourg in the
Alsace: It did my heart good to read of the actions of the people,
especially of Colmar, in saving Torahs and their activities on behalf of
Jews.I was also overjoyed at the resurgence of Judaism and Yiddish in that
area. Fifty four years ago I fought to regain Colmar with the French First
Army, being attached to it in my 75th Division, 290th Regimental Combat
Team's many battles in Europe.. We fought to liberate the city and the
surrounding area. The beautifully written post brought back memories long
surpressed. Now I am pleased that the hard fought battles freed a city where
my people are respected. When I read the post to my wife, especially when
Avrom recited Modeh Ani, a prayer she has said every morning since her very
early childhood. It brought tears to her eyes. It was taught to her by her
beloved Grandfather who brought her up after the death of her father when
she was 8. She too considers it a sort of daily Kaddish for both of them. 

I am a member of the Association "Rhin & Danube" Anciens De La Premiere
Armee Francais, U.S. Section, commemorating the liberation of Colmar and
Alsace and honoring the men who fought and died there..

Thank you, Ms. Reiter, for your post and I wish you would report to us
again on your next visit overseas.

Subject: Letter from Strassbourg

I found the letter very interesting. I lived in Alsace just before the war
(1938). I stayed near Moulhouse.I did not find anyone who could speak
Yiddish. In the later part of th 19th century until the end of WWI Alsace
was part of Germany (Prussia). This was the result of of the Prussian Franco
war. German was spoken in may places but French was spoken by most. There is
also a local dialect a combination of Germna and French. Also many believe
that Yiddish had its start in Alsace or in the Rhineland. Like in most
German Jewish community the language of the ghetto (a form of Yiddish)
dispited by most was deminishing by the latter part of 19th century it had
disaapeared among German Jews. I was therefore not surprised when I found
thatno one spoke Yiddish in the part of Alsace where I lived. 

After WWII Eastern Eurpean Jews could not return to the places where they
had lived. They stayed in Western Europe and settled there. I am therefore
somewhat suspicious that the Strassbourg Jews speak Yiddish. I of course
cannot refute what Ida and Yosef Schwartz experienced.It would be
interesting to know what kind of Yiddish it was. This would give us a clue
to the origin of this Yiddish. 

It is indeed a pleasure to see Yiddish alive and well in Strassbourg.

Subject: Khsidishe mayses

I would like to be in touch with anyone on the list who is involved (or
interested) in the study of Hasidic tales, or in related areas:  Hasidism in
general, Yiddish folk tales or the like. 

I am a PhD student at the University of Toronto researching Hasidic stories. 
On May 15 I am scheduled to present a paper, "The Great Holy Woman Malka of
Belz:  Women as Protagonists and Narrators in Hasidic Tales", at the UCCB
Symposium on Storytelling in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.  This fall, I will be
giving a lecture on my research in New York City, as a research fellow of
the YIVO institute. 

In my research at YIVO I hope to learn something about differences between
Yiddish and Hebrew versions of published Hasidic tales, and about the
relationship between the oral versions of stories recorded by folklore
collectors and the versions found in print.  Although my main focus will
likely be on analyzing the content of Hasidic tales published before the
first world war, in the light of issues in halakhah and religion, I'm
interested in all facets of the field:  the publication and reception
history of books of tales, the historicity or lack of it of stories about
the Rebbes, the role of storytelling and books of stories in the Chassidishe
world today, etc. I'd be delighted to hear from anyone with a shared
interest, on the list or privately (jcjlewis@chass.utoronto.ca). 

Sh'koyekh,

Yankev Lewis

Subject: lekakh, arbes

Someone recently asked me about two seemingly Yiddish words, both used in
Kazin's _A Walker in the City_.  Both refer to food:  "a great brown nutcake
filled with almonds, the traditional _lekakh_," and "Arbes!  Heyse gute
arbes!" sold on the street.  What would be a good way to define these words? 

Thanks!

Subject: kalte schul

re: the inquiry last month about the meaning of "kalte schul" 

I recently translated a chapter in a Yizkor book on Rukashuk, Lithuania.  In
this town, strangely enough for Misnagdish Lithuania, was a vibrant
Khasidish community.  However, because the khasidim here sent their sons to
certain Yeshivas consistent with their philosophies, eg, Telz, and generally
condoned higher learning, they were called "kalte Khasidim", i.e, cool
heads, perhaps like the Talmudic Misnagdim.  I am wondering if references to
"kalte schulen" in the Ukraine and other parts of Russia don't refer to
Misnagdish schuls, vs. Khasidish ones.  Any authoritive voices on this???
