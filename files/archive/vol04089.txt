mitchell brown, bay mir bistu sheyn was written by sholem secunda, in
yiddish. i have heard a perhaps apocryphal story that he didn't make a
cent on it, but let's not deny him his authorship too! i don't have the
lyrics on hand but they start out something like:

bay mir bistu sheyn,
bay mir hostu kheyn,
bay mir bistu di shenste oyf der velt.

-------------
jay lee, wow, i never noticed 'der bingl' in 'rum and coca cola'! i just
dug out my old record and there it is, clear as day--now that you've told
me! but my recording has slightly different english lyrics from the ones
you wrote:

in old trinidad, i also fear, the situation is mighty queer.
like the yankee girl, the native swoon when she hear der bingl croon.

at first i thought 'der' was their 'dialect' version of 'their', but that
wouldn't explain 'bingl', so you're probably right on 'der' as well.

(this has to be one of the most racist and sexist popular songs i've ever
heard, btw. or a different kind of 'p.c.'...painful cringe.)

anyway, thanks for pointing it out.

Subj:  Bai mir bist du shein...

What I heard was that the song originated on the professional Yiddish
musical stage in America; maybe Sammy Cahn WAS the composer.  From there it
travelled all over the world, since the Yiddish stage circuit included
South America, Poland, Romania, etc.  At some point the English translation
was cut.  Although I can't prove the chronology, I can vouch for the travel.
At a UCLA Slavic dept party some time in the late 70's I believe, the great
Slavicist Isachenko (no Jew, but his father apparently had been one of the
lawyers who defended Beilis), played the song on a mandolin, singing it in
Russian!  (except of course for the title line, as in English).  When I asked
him where he learned it, he said it was a song from Odessa!  Apparently the
musical circuit included Odessa in the 30's.

Subject: Bei Mir Bistu Shein [sic]

The song in question, with Yiddish words by Jacob Jacobs and music by
Sholom Secunda, was first published as "Bei Mir Bistu Shein" on September
25, 1933 by the composer.  It was written for the show _I Would If I
Could_, where it was introduced by Aaron Lebedeff in 1932.  Secunda sold
the copyright for a pittance to the music publishers J. & J. Kammen.
They published it with English words by Sammy Cahn and Saul Chaplin under
the title "Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen."  (The story can be found in the book
of that title, a biography of Sholom Secunda written by his daughter.)

A Yiddish edition published by Kammen c. 1937 with the title "Bei Mir
Bistu Shain" on the outside and "Bei Mir Bistu Shein" on the inside has
the following text (transcribed here in YIVO orthography but reflecting
the stage pronunciation that makes the rhymes work:

--Ven di zolst zayn shvarts vi a tuter,
ven di host oygn vi bay a kuter
un ven di hinkst tsibislekh,
host hiltserne fislekh,
zug ikh, dus art mikh nit.
Un ven di host a narishn shmeykhl
un ven di host Vayzusyes seykhl,
ven di bist vild vi indianer,
bist afile a galitsyaner,
zug ikh, dus art mikh nit.

--Zug mikh, vi erklersti dus?
--Khvel dir zugn bald farvus:

Bay mir bisti sheyn.
Bay mir hosti kheyn.
Bist eyne bay mir oyf der velt.
Bay mir bisti git.
Bay mir hosti "it."
Bay mir bisti tayerer fin gelt.
Fil sheyne meydlekh hobn shoyn
gevolt nemen mikh
un fin zey ale oysgeklibn
hob ikh nor dikh.
Bay mir bisti sheyn.
Bay mir hosti kheyn.
Bist eyne bay mir oyf der velt.

	(Perhaps someone who knows the theater dialect better than I could
make any necessary corrections.)

Bay mir bistu sheyn was originally in Yiddish.  It was written by Sholem
Secunda for a show, probably at a Second Avenue theater.  My memory of
the words reaches no further than that of Martin Davis.

When Bob Rothstein says it's so, it's so.  But memory says that the line:

       Bist eyne bay mir oyf der velt

went:

       Bay mir bist di shenste in der velt.

So I'm in trouble not only with Bob but with Ellen and Johnny who say
'oyf'.

May I try a wild guess?  There were two versions.  Meyle, Lebedeff could
sing to his basherte that her charms were only of his beholding.  By the
time the song hit the Catskills and every khasene from New York to
Miami, something more conventional was needed.

***

Jay Lee and Ellen Prince: do you assume that the phrase "der Bingl" in
"Rum and Coca Cola" is Yiddish?  Maybe so, but not in my experience.  On
the other hand, Bing Crosby was _very_ popular in Germany and during the
war (indeed as Gau Westmark aka Alsace-Lorraine was the front) I heard a
piece by der Bingl on German radio.
