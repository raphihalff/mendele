Subject: Spelling and neshome

Marjorie Hirshan writes [10.010] on the issue of whether new publications of
Yiddish works should have the author's spelling or YIVO spelling. She
says:

     But as Tevye would say - on the other hand, if not for
     standardizations, we would still be reading when that Aprille with its
     shoures soote (or a reasonable facsimile)..... I must voice my hope
     that standardization is what happens after centuries of developmental
     changes in speech and/or spelling, and that these standardizations are
     based upon the words that prevail in the neshomes of the people in the
     marketplace of the day. These rules create a base for academics and for
     'right' and 'wrong' in fine-tuning language through time.

The problem with the analogy is that Chaucer was writing in Middle English
and we speak/read/write Modern English -- two different languages. We can
certainly still find recent publications of his Canterbury Tales in the
original (Whan that Aprille...), as well as *translations* into Modern
English. This is a *very* different thing from deciding that
twentieth-century Yiddish writers didn't/don't know how to spell their own
language. 'Correct spelling' is merely a convention -- Birnbaum had one,
Moyshe Nadir had one, and YIVO has one, among others. If the publisher is
YIVO, then I guess one would expect the spelling to be changed; if it isn't,
then it would just be chutzpah (aka khutspe), in my opinion.

All this notwithstanding, it would be nice to have SOME 'standardized'
spelling in an electronic edition, so one could do efficient searches. I
personally YIVO-ized Olsvanger's Royte Pomerantsn transliteration for my
online corpus, which is as chuzpahdik as one could get, but I wouldn't want
to see it published this way for a general audience. I would like those
'standardized' editions to be purely for this purpose and certainly not for
reading for pleasure or research or for teaching. Just my two cents.

Marjorie goes on:

     Only a gazlen would veto or give up copies (Shakespeare, Browning...)
     with the wouldsts and shouldsts and thees and thous. But only a gazlen
     would let choice of word become a free for all between both stages.

Not adhering to YIVO's fiats does not necessarily constitute a 'free for
all'. In other speech communities it is usually the (eminent) writers that
*become the model* for spelling! Poor Yiddish writers, they don't get no
respect. ;)

     [See identical quote in post above]

Just to further complicate issues, I should point out that we indeed DO
write (almost) Middle English.  The English spelling system was frozen about
three hundred years ago, before the Great Vowel Shift.  Thus everyone else
in the world pronounces the letter 'i' as 'ee', but WE pronounce it as a low
to high diphthong.  Similarly differences exist for the letters 'e' and 'a'.
In addition, we continue to write the long-lost velar fricative 'kh' all
over the place in words like 'cough', 'right' and 'through'.  In some
cultures (and the English-speaking one is the most so) spelling is very
conservative, and people get extremely loyal to the 'old ways'.  This
discussion of what to do with old books using the 'wrong' spelling is
fascinating--as a linguist I have no wisdom to offer, however.
Standardization is certainly a good thing for languages which are vital and
widely taught.  As to whether Yiddish counts in that category I'd rather not
get into...

Milt Koosman's unique suggestion (Vol. 10.012) begs for an interpretation of
_di kale iz kalye gevorn_.  Milt?

Subject: 'kale gevorn'

I may have missed some replies so please excuse me if this has already been
mentioned, but my understanding has always been that it's not 'kale gevorn'
but 'kalye gevorn', i.e. become spoiled (literally 'lame'). Was this a folk
etymology?

Subject: 'Kale gevorn'

Milt Koosman thinks that 'kale gevorn' describes a bride-to-be. Could
be....However if something, such as a 'makherayke', or some machinery, 'tsum
bayshpil',  needs repair, that is something that has become 'kal-ye', or kalye
gevorn. Note there is a difference in words...And if something is worn out, or
goes bad,  it also becomes: kalye.

"Tobias Burghardt was so kind to ask you for a translation of the poem
'An Anna Blume". You sent us your translation. Unfortunately, I have to
inform you that we could not consider this poem in the book. The book is
the official present of Lower Saxony for the guests of the state who
will visit the world exposition in Hannover. Therefore we had to
restrict the translations to the official languages of the diferent
countries. This is the reason why we could not take your translation in
Yiddish into consideration. I ask you for your understanding and
apologise for the misunderstanding. Yours sincerely Dr. Gerd Weiberg."

Subject: Re: Waiting for Mendele

Martin Green has called attention to recent delays in publication
of Mendele.  Some of that, undoubtedly, stems from the temporary
arrangements that have required one shames to substitute for
another.  Some of it may also be the result of the current practice
of holding various contributions back so that several on the same
subject can be published together, rather than simply distributing
them in the order of submission.

That said, it seems as though the delays are in the past and Mendele
has caught up with current submissions.  I suspect, however, that
some items may have been lost along the way.  For instance, I sent
in a contribution on May 15 that was not published, nor explicitly
rejected, nor even acknowledged, and the same may have happened to
Mr. Green and others.

Bob Poe

[The temporary untershames adds ruefully: Bob Poe is exactly right.  A
small number of posts between May 15 and May 23 have gone astray.  Posters
affected are cordially asked to resubmit. nm]

Subject: orl

Itzik Goldenberg [10.001] wrote:

     A question about Sholem Aleykhem's use of "orl" as a synonym for a
     non-Jew.  This term appears many times, in context, in the story "Oylem
     habe," which just appeared in The Mendele Review.  For those who
     might not know, "orl" is a foreskin, (though spelled without the "hey"
     at the end of the word when the actual foreskin is meant). The term
     seems to us now humourous at best, perhaps somewhat derogatory at
     worst.  I was wondering whether a native yiddish speaker, especially at
     the time Sholem Aleykhem was writing these stories, before 1916, would
     find this term amusing, or was it the matter-of-fact term used in a
     non-derogatory sense?

Just a couple of comments on "orl."  It's not a "foreskin," but
rather "an uncircumcized male."  It comes directly from the Hebrew
"`arel," and can be found in several contexts in Tana"kh, including the
description of Moyshe Rabeinu as "`aral sefatayim (sefosayim)" literally
"of uncircumcized lips," i.e., having some sort of speech impediment.
The Hebrew word for foreskin is "`orla," which explains the final "hey"
cited by Itzik above.

Given that background, I don't find this usage the least bit
humorous.  I wasn't around in 1916, but my guess is that this would have
been a more or less ordinary way for a Yiddish speaker of the time in
eastern Europe to refer to a non-Jew.  There's no doubt in my mind that
it's a pretty derogatory term, but don't forget that this would have
been some eighty-odd years closer to the time of frequent pogroms
against Jewish communities, well within living memory at the time, so
such derogation wasn't totally unwarranted.

Hope this helps.  zayt mir gezunt un shtark.

Subject: Re: Nagan and Hirsh Glik

Paul Glasser, substituting his own intuition for "overstating sources,"
(that Glik used "shpayer," "nagan" and "pistoyl" to symbolize international
anti-fascist unity) should be aware that the sources are Ruth Rubin, quoting
her informant Shmerke Katcherginsky. The latter was the leading collector of
ghetto and resistance songs and Hirsh Glik's mentor. It was to him that Glik
first sang "zog nit keynmol," according to Katcherginsky's letter to the
literary critic Nakhman Mayzel and quoted by him in the monograph "hirsh
glik un zayn lid 'zog nit keynmol'" (Hirsh Glik and his Song, "Never Say"
[The Partisan Hymn]) Ykuf, NY, 1949, pp. 14-15.

Sometimes, the "simplest explanation" flies in the face of fact.
