Subject: Hershele Ostropolyer and "katar"

About a "kalt in der noz" - there is a song "Shuldik in dem iz nor mayn noz"
about a "katar" that Molly Picon sang.  We have the music at YIVO.  The text
also appears in the Libreto, Warsaw, l9l9.

About Hershele Ostropolyer and his position as the jester of Reb Borekhl,
offhand I recall Simon Dubnow writes about it in his  History of Hasidism,
published by YIVO.

Subject: Hershele Ostropoler.

Some other writers have written about the adventures of Hershele from Ostropol
(besides those already mentioned elsewhere), among them - I.Trunk,
M.Hershenzon, I.Babel, and M.L.Lifshits.  Isaak Emmanuilovich Babel (1894,
Odessa - January 27, 1940, Lubyanka prison, Moscow): "Shabos-Nakhamu (Iz
tsikla _Gershele_)" - subtitle _From the cycle Gershele_, first published in
the newspaper "Vechernyaya Zvezda" (evening star), Petrograd, March 16, 1918. 
Moyshe Lifshits (1894, Belotserkev, Vasilkev uyezd, Kiev er guberniye - 1940,
Erets-Isroel): his comedy "Hershele Ostropoler" was staged in Vilna in the
early 1930s.  Moyshe (Yakovlevich) Gershenzon (1903, Chernigov, Volyner
guberniye - 1943, afn front, Mikhaylovskiy, Krasnodar gegnt): his first play
"Hershele Ostropoler" was staged at the Moscow GOSET (State Jewish Theater) by
Binyomin Zuskin in the 1930s, and then elsewhere around the country, making
the author one of the most popular playwrights . 

The legend has it that Ershele (there is no Hey in the Podoler Yiddish) 
Ostropoler (2nd half of the 18 century, near Balta, Podoler guberniye, - ?,
Medzhibozh (Mezhibezh), Podoler guberniye) was a shoykhet in the Volhynian
town of Ostropol , but was force d to leave it because of his causticity. He
became a batkhn and travelled throughout Podolia until he was invited to the
court of the famous tzaddik - reb Burekh of Medzhibozh.  However, he was
thrown down the stairs for his stinging tongue, and died soon thereafter. The
oral _Ershele_ folklore is still alive in the area ( I've heard several
stories, told by folks who could not read Yiddish, and in fact I learnt some
as a child from my father in the late 1970s).

Subject: Russian genetive
 
According to some theories, it is somehow linked with the fact that there are
many pairs of names that may have the suffix -ov just as the suffix -yi. Leo
Tolstoy's grandfather used the genetive "Tolstova".

Subject: Alsatian Yiddish redux

Fischl, the editor of "der bay," Northern California's Yiddish bulletin makes
reference to a 3-week course in Yiddish to be held in Strassbourg.  While most
of the material is traditional Eastern Yiddish, there will be a conference led
by Astrid Starck on "The links between Eastern and Western Yiddish."  Mrs.
Starck published a book on Western Yiddish that was the subject of some
discussion on this list about a year ago. 

I was mostly responsible for bringing up the subject because I was attemtping
to learn something about Judeo Alsatian and suggested that I was both curious
and confused about the subject of Western Yiddish and its character as
contrasted with the better known Eastern Yiddish. 

In addition to the conference, Mrs. Starck will give a workshop on
Judeo-Alsatian. 

The much more comprehensive program is being managed by the Theatre en l'Air,
46, rue Baldner, 67100 Strassbourg.  The email is ISADUV@aol.com and the FAX
33-388-623-869. 

I thank Fischl for having brought this exciting opportunity to my attention.

Subject: Mahler, Suhl--a yasher koyekh to Ron Robboy

Many thanks to Ron Robboy for his recent contributions to Mendele (07.173) 
regarding Diana Wilner's queries on Raphael Mahler and Yuri (M.A.) Suhl. As a
student of the former and a colleague of the latter, I am grateful for his
scholarship. Again. 

Mahler taught in NY at _di kursn far lerer un hekherer yidisher bildung_
("Courses for Teachers and Higher Jewish Education"), the college-level
institution of the shule movement sponsored by the left-wing Jewish Peoples
Fraternal Order (JPFO) of the International Workers Order (IWO). While some
classes of the kursn were given on Thursday and Friday evenings, Mahler taught
on Saturdays, along with such distinguished scholars as Menashe Unger, whose
classes on Tan'akh used Yehoyish's 2-volume Yiddish translation (the yellowed
pages of my copies still retain pencilled notes from his classes), and Itche
Goldberg, whose lectures on Yiddish literature inspired hundreds of students
with life-long appreciation of the richness of our culture. At its height, the
"kursn" had over 100 students. 

(Incidentally, Mahler's rich Polish-Yiddish accent took some getting used to
among his American-born students who'd been taught the Litvish-influenced
"standard" shule Yiddish. He constantly referred to this or that "tkife" in
modern Jewish history, with the _tes_ hardly audible: it was only after
several weeks that we understood he was referring to a period, or _tkufe_.) 

Yuri Suhl was a colleague when I joined the staff of the Morgn Frayhayt after
graduating from the _kursn_ with a degree in Yiddish journalism (a distinction
I shared with my late wife, May Stein). While our (May's and my) mentor was
Nathaniel Buchwald (author of the monumental work, _teyater_) who taught on
Thursday evenings, Yuri related that his journalistic career developed under
the tutelage of Moyshe (Moissaye) Olgin, the legendary first editor of the
Frayhayt.

Subject: Hare hunt in hagodes

Rick Turkel is right, of course (mendele 07.176) in his correction of my
sketchy (and obviously faulty) recollection of the mnemonic yud-kof-nun-hey-
zayin. I was sure there was another meaning for the "hey" but couldn't come up
with it during my usual (post midnight) perusal of important messages. 

Still, couldn't I get even a small cigar? Not to smoke, of course: just to
admire.

Subject: "Lobzik" the dog -- stories by "Chaver Paver"

A friend sometime ago sent me the following request for help.  Can anyone
provide any information on Yiddish stories about a dog named "Lobzik" by
someone who possibly used the pen-name "Chaver Paver" (both names are
transliterated from memory of the sound of the names): 
 
When I was a kid, I either read (or was read to) a story in Yiddish about a
dog called "Lobzik" who used to be sent by his owners to the candy store to
pick up (in his mouth) and bring back home the Daily Freiheit.  One day the
story owner was busy and "Lobzik" was too impatient to wait, so he picked up a
paper and brought it home.  It turned out to be the Daily News.  Well, did he
ever get hell from his owners... and I don't remember any more.  I think it
may have been written by a writer of stories for childen in Yiddish and who
might even have been writing for the Freiheit;  his pen name would have been
something like "Chaver Paver."
