Subject: Paul Robeson

In addition to the incident described on radio by Paul Robeson, Jr. which
also appeared in print in Jewish Currents magazine some years ago, it is
interesting to note that when Hirsh Glik's partisan hymn zog nit keynmol was
first sung in the US by Yiddish choruses immediately after the khurbn
(holocaust), it was sung slowly, as a dirge. To the best of my recollection,
it was Paul Robeson's magnificent bass-baritone voice that first sang it as
intended by the author, who had set his lyrics to a brisk march by the
brothers Pokras.  Robeson's profound feeling--as an African-American--of
soidarity with the Jewish resistance against nazism was awesomely expressed
in the vehemence with which he always sang the last lines, placing the
greatest stress on the word, naganes: "dos hot a folk tsvishn falndike vent
dos lid gezungen mit naganes in di hent!"

Not having yet heard the archival record referred to by Dvosye Bilik, I
can't be certain that the tumultuous response she refers to came at that
point but, if it did, it would have echoed the reaction at the many times
Robeson sang zog nit keynmol here, especially during the years when he
was held a virtual prisoner by the State Department's refusal to grant
him a passport for travel abroad. Incidentally, Robeson recorded a number
of songs in Yiddish and, according to his friend Israel (Srulik) Freed,
managing editor of the Yiddish daily newspaper morgn frayhayt (Morning
Freedom), had planned to make a record of an all-Yiddish repertoire
before his voice and his health began to fail him.

Subject: Yiddish on Florida PBS

Mendelniks in Florida:

I understand that Channel 2, Dade County Florida (Miami?) will be having
a special Yiddish night--Monday, March 13th from 8pm - Midnight.  They
will be broadcasting such memorable pieces as "The Shlemiel, the
Shlemazzle and the Doppes" and "Bobe Mayses--Grandmother Stories."  Since
it's 4 hours (including their fundraising shtik), there will be other
programs as well.

Subject: YIVO's loan from Lithuania

In response to Dan Leeson (Mendele 4.355), I should have made it clear
that YIVO's agreement with the Lithuanian authorities is indeed a *loan*
agreement, which stipulates that materials sent to New York are to be
preserved, arranged, microfilmed, and returned. The question of receiving
and returning it in installments is complicated; from the archival point
of view it makes the most sense to organize the whole body of material
into as coherent a whole as possible, rather than organize and return
chunks of it at a time.  Suffice it to say that the Lithuanians are aware
of the justifications that have been put to them by YIVO's archivists and
the matter is under discussion.

What proportion of the whole was received at YIVO?  Based on the 110 or
so boxes that YIVO representatives have been shown during visits to
Vilna, I'd say that approximately 25%-30% was sent to New York last
month.

Subject: Khasn-kale af Yidish

Early on in my reconnection with Yiddish, I noticed that the notion of
bride and groom seemed different from the English usage.  I recently ran
across an article by Aileen Pace Nilsen in Language Awareness (6th Ed, St
Martin's, 1994) in which she claims that words describing women and men
exhibit interesting (sexist, she argues) differences.  While most
expressions referring to males and females put the male reference first
(I just did it here, too), as in 'boys and girls' (but, 'ladies and
gentlemen' she fails to note) (which is M'sieurs-Dames' in French, BTW),
'his and hers', 'guys and dolls', 'kings and queens', 'brothers and
sisters'.  (I don't know about Yiddish, but it is a question to ask).
The exception to this pattern that she does note is 'bride and groom,'
claiming, in a Sapir-Whorfian way, that this means (along with some other
evidence she mentions) that weddings are more important to women than to
men.   (For non-linguists, the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis claims a strong
connection between language and thought) .

Excuse this long introduction, but I felt the context might be
interesting, as well as the question of gender bias in Yiddish, which we
might want to address some time.   Then again, we might not!

The point which caught my eye was that Nilsen then states:

      A woman cherishes the wedding and is considered a bride for
      a whole year,but a man is referred to as a groom only on the
      day of the wedding.

While I don't know if this is generally true for all speakers of English
(I think of 'bride' as being a relevant term only on the wedding day),
after which she is one of two 'newly-weds'.  Maybe the new husband can
refer to her as his 'bride' a little longer;  I'm not so sure about this.
I have the feeling that this isn't true of the Yiddish Khasn-Kale. It is
my impression that a bride and a groom begin to be referred to as such in
Yiddish (in the Shtetl, anyway) from the time of the engagement until the
wedding.  Am I right?    If so, this seems to open up an interesting
issue of language vs culture.   Did this concept in Yiddish affect the
speech of immigrants to the US?   Any lasting effects in areas where
Yiddish once predominated?

Comments, anyone?
