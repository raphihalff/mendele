Subject: takeh

Anatole Beck asks (3.272) about the etymology of Yid. "takeh,"
meaning "indeed." It is, in fact, from the Polish "takie," an adverb
meaning "thus, in this/that fashion, etc."  It is, however, NOT
cognate with Russian "da," meaning "yes," but rather with Russian
"tak," which has the same meaning as in Polish, and with Czech "tak"
and Serbocroatian "tako."

As for the nasalization (e.g., Yankev for Hebrew Yaakov) coming from
Polish, I don't buy it because there's no specific phonological
environment to condition their appearance in Hebrew-derived Yiddish
words.  Polish nasals didn't appear out of nowhere, but rather
developed from the earlier Common Slavic nasals which were lost as
independent phonemes in the other modern Slavic languages.  I seem
to recall reading somewhere a long time ago about a Proto-Indo-
European pharyngeal manifesting itself as an "n" in one or another
family of daughter languages.  I don't recall the details, but it
parallels what we see in Yiddish.

Subject: Re: Take

I know no Slavic languages, but I've always understood that the
Slavic (Polish/Russian?) "tak" means "thus", which isn't too far
from the Yiddish meaning.  I heard it used once by chessplayers,
speaking Polish, who were playing over a tournament game and
demonstrating to each other ("tak" = "if you move here/thus").

Subject: tako (fwd)

I have a rather scholarly message from my Polish colleague at the
London School of Economics, regarding  takeh.  It seems that it has
a use in the meaning of  "thus", which could be the source of its
use in Yiddish as  "indeed":

 Sender: A.J.OSTASZEWSKI@lse.ac.uk

 I looked up "tak" and discovered that in the 1500's the word was
 "tako" and got abbreviated. Its opposite is still "jako" (as) .
 THis is as in the pair talis qualis in Latin. Actually, the "t" is
 the indo-european demonststartive, and exists in other slav
 languages as plain "t" and in the duplicated "tet". It is clearly
 the same word as "the" and "dass", but they have specialised their
 usage in the other languages. As regards indeed, the owrd is very
 much used as in "Thus spake Zaratrustra" (Tak rzecze Zaratrustra;
 hey, I may have heard somewhere Tako rzecze Zaratrustra", no doubt
 an archaisation as in spake). Adam.

Subject: on takeh and maynseh

anatole beck's suggestions for takeh seem to need some fine-tuning.

tak is polish for yes, but its root meaning in slavic in "so, thus,
in this way".  (i'd have to check to see if russian /da/ "yes" is
supposed to be related -- i doubt it, since there is a particle /da/
in various slavic languages.)

russian in fact has /taki/ whose meaning (difficult to translate)
seems closer to yiddish /takeh/.

polish nasalization as in "Walesa" is not a spontaneous insertion;
on the contrary, it generally or always comes from an earlier /n/,
thus polish "pie,c'"  (i'm trying to fake the polish spelling),
pron. approx. /pyench/, comes ultimately from the same source as
greek /pente/ "5".

i haven't followed the discussion, and i'm sure it's been mentioned,
but just in case: one assumption i heard long ago is that the nasal
/maynse, yankev/ came (via sefardic pronunciation?) as an attempt to
represent the 'ayin.

Subject: muzn/darfn

i too was awaiting some scholarly replies, but, in the absence of
anything better, i'll put in my 2 cents.

i don't think either is artificial in yiddish--both seem very very
common in everyday speech. they're sort of synonyms, with some
exceptions:

both can be modals, taking an infinitival complement (ikh muz/darf
hobn gelt) but darfn can also be a simple transitive verb 'need'
(ikh darf gelt) while muzn cannot (*ikh muz gelt is impossible).

darfn, with an infinitive complement, can mean 'be due', as in (from
weinreich's dictionary) 'er darf do zayn montik' = he is due here on
monday; in contrast, i believe 'er muz do zayn montik' would mean
only 'he must/is required to be here on monday'.

question: is it true that a negative with both darfn and muzn always
has 'wide scope'? that is, is it true that 1 and 2 can mean only 3
and never the same as 4? (my sneaking suspicion is that 1 can
possibly mean 4 but 2 can never mean 4. is that right?)

1. men muz nit redn.
2. men darf nit redn.
3. one doesn't have to speak. (it's not the case that one must speak.)
4. men tor nit redn. (the negative always has narrow scope with torn,
   right? that is, 4 can ONLY mean 'one is obliged to not speak' and
   never 'one is not obliged to speak'.)

also, can both muzn and darfn have an epistemic as well as a root
sense? that is, can both 5 and 6 mean 8 as well as 7? (my hunch is
that 5 can possibly mean 8 but 6 cannot mean 8--is that right?)

5. er muz zayn do.
6. er darf zayn do.
7. he needs/is obliged to be there (perhaps in the future).
8. it must be the case that he's there (now).

a dank.
