From: "Prof. Moshe Taube" <taube@fas.harvard.edu>
Subject: Rashi and snow

This gloss was noticed a long time ago by linguists. Moshe Altbauer in 1928
wrote a notule in the Revue des Etudes Slaves where he spoke of the knaanic
(=Slavic, in this case Old Czech) snih and remarked the early testimony to
the proces g>h (reflected in Rashi's guttural r), and he was not the first
(there is another reference from the turn of the century which I do not
recall off-hand). Roman Jakobson, too, has a paper (reprinted in his
collected papers vol. 4 I think) on the early Knaanic = Slavic (Old Czech)
forms reflected in Rashi's glosses.

Subject: la"z in Rashi

Following on from Sholem Berger's query (vol.9.019), where Rashi gives
French translations is he using French or is is it a Jewish vernacular based
on French similar to the relationship of our Yiddish to German?

From: "Mikhl Herzog" <mherzog@bestweb.net>
Subject: Bravo! Three cheers for Lucas Bruyn

Lucas Bruyn (9:020) is right on the mark. Still, I hesitate to enter this
discussion lest I be considered guilty of bad-mouthing some of my good
friends and colleagues. Let me be brave (if somewhat bitter) and, if someone
at YIVO is listening, perhaps this will serve as a wake-up call.

Copyright concerns have, indeed, been among the obstacles to the relatively
simple but indispensible task of creating the comprehensive Yiddish Lexicon
from existing works that Lucas proposes. Can these concerns be overcome in
some fashion? 

Another obstacle has been, at best, sheer neglect. It's now some years since
a Mendele subscriber, Meyer Wolf (formerly of Jerusalem, now of California),
computerized the contents of Stutshkoff's _Oytser fun der yidisher shprakh_,
for YIVO. Can anyone ascertain where, in the bowels of YIVO's archives, this
treasure lies buried? (Incidentally, YIVO also houses computerized
concordances of numerous Yiddish literary works (prepared by Dr. Wolf) for
the now dormant _Groyser verterbukh fun der yidisher shprakh_). There's no
better person than Meyer Wolf to figure out how they, too, could be
integrated into such an effort. 

Finally, _The Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry_ (Volume III,
in press), will also yield a lexical treasure (with an added geographic
dimension) that can be incorporated into a comprehensive Yiddish lexicon;
and, it still defies the imagination that, only a few years ago, the powers
that be (or that were) at YIVO turned down the pro bono services, offered
its Library and Archives, by the person who is central to the ATLAS
effort--one of Europe's leading specialists in the computer manipulation of
masses of linguistic data--who has proposed the creation of precisely the
same tool as Lucas now proposes, with the addition of the easily available
vocabulary of the present-day Yiddish newspaper and periodical publications. 

Is YIVO now in a position to rectify the situation? Or, perhaps there is
another institution in the US, Europe, or Israel, that is prepared to
provide the aegis for such an undertaking.

Subject: Sholem Aleichem and Charlie Chaplin

Ester Vaisman (in 9.020, 2) provides welcome additional material about
Sholem Aleichem and Charlie Chaplin compiled and edited by Belen'kii. 
Belen'kii's remark, "A surprising coincidence: the beginning of Chaplin's
artistic career coincided with the date of Sholem Aleichem's second visit to
New York, 1914," deserves just a bit more additional detail: 

Chaplin's first movie, "Making a Living" was filmed toward the end of 1913,
but was released in early 1914.  Sholem Aleichem arrived in New York City in
December 1914, almost a year after Chaplin's Keystone Comedies became
popular.  Sholem Aleichem died 17 months after he arrived in New York the
second time. 

Chaplin rapidly attained worldwide fame and popularity so that Sholem
Aleichem may have seen Chaplin on the screen while still in Europe.  In any
case, Sholem Aleichem's keen, almost immediate, appreciation of Chaplin's
genius is fascinating. 

As noted in my previous post (9.016, 1), Sholem Aleichem himself wrote
scenarios adapting some of his work for the screen.  Seeing Chaplin work
must have stimulated further dreams of such scenarios, but nothing came of
them.
