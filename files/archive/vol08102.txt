Subject: bleyketsn

Dear Mendele:

I am seeking a translation of the word <bleyketsn>, a word, as I
understand
it, for Christian sacred music, carols and the like.

Does anyone know the definitions of the following Yiddish words:

Thanks,

Subject: farvarfn

Sholem Aleykhem writes about "farvarfn gendz".  The general
meaning of the
term is clear enough from its context (to lay in a flock of geese
for
fattening before slaughter), but this doesn't very closely match
any of the
definitions in Harkavy or Weinreich. 

A common enough occurrence, I guess.  Still, if anyone has an
idea as to how
this particular usage came about I'd like to read it.

Subject: Song

A song was heard today on a radio station on Long Island.
Unfortunately I
do not know the radio station call letters.  However, the song was
about a
Jewish grandmother who is telling her grandchild about various
Jewish foods. 
A later stanza tells that the grandmother has moved to California
and now
proposes that he eat health food.  Does anyone know about this
song, and
where I can obtain a tape or CD? 

Many thanks.
Bernard Gershen

Subject: Cole Porter on Yiddish melody

The Sunday, December 13 Chicago Tribune book section, in a
review of "It
Happened on Broadway:  An Oral Historyof the Great White Way"
by Myrna Katz
Frommer and Harvey Frommer, makes reference to a quote by
composer Maury
Yeston. 

Yeston said "I don't think Cole Porter was kidding when he said to
Richard
Rodgers, ' You know, I think I discovered the secret of great
songwriting in
America.'

"And Rodgers asked, 'what is it?'

" 'Yiddish Melody.' "

Subject: Maurice Evans and the Jewish stage

Regarding Mr. Berkowitz' letter, on the subject of Mendele as a
restrictive
club, I, for one, agree that anyone interested in Yiddish should be
welcome
in Mendele, whether or not he/she is fluent in the language, and
this,
notwithstanding the fact that I am , having been raised in a
Yiddish
speaking home so that Yiddish was my first language.  However,
I might
respectfully point out that Maurice Evans never performed on the
Jewish
stage, at least not to my knowledge.  I think he meant Maurice
Schwartz. 
Incidentally, if Mr.  Berkowitz went to the shows on Second
Avenue during
the early 1940's, he probably saw me perform as a child actor,
with Menashe
Skulnick, Molly Picon, et al.

Subject: bod

The question has arisen as to why the word bod occurs in the
phrase : hob im
in bod. It is clear that a bath is not exactly a horific or even
negative
place to be. It is my understanding that the confusion arises due
to the
fact that the Yidish word bod actually is a near homonym for two
distinct
germanic words: bad (bath) and boden (ground or earth) and it is
the latter
meaning that was originally intended. My suspicion is that the
original
expression was: hob im in bodn. But with the slurring or
swollowing of the
final n the intended meaning of: he can go to hell became
distorted or
confused. I certainly don't buy the proposed derivation based on
bawdy
house, since that is too far off from the clear intent of the
expression.
Siz epis a bisele farfetched.

Subject: Learning Yiddish in Tel Aviv

Some 110 employees of the Tel Aviv-Yafo municipality have
begun learning
Yiddish.  The course of study is being organized and partially
sponsored by
the Lerner Fund, whose goal it is to encourage the rejuvenation of
Yiddish. 
The Lerner Fund hopes to interest other places of employment in
organizing
Yiddish classes, as well.
