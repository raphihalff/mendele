Subject: Hebrew vs. Yiddish, 1930

The daily email blast, "Jewdayo," marking historical events every day (some reflecting 
pride in Jewish history, others shameful in various ways), recorded the following for 
yesterday, Sept. 26:

A mob of several thousand Jews protested outside the Mograbi Theater in Tel Aviv on 
this date in 1930 against the screening of one of the first feature-length Yiddish-language 
talkie movies, Mayn Yidishe Mame ("My Jewish Mother"), starring Seymour Rexite. 
The rioters included several members of the so-called "Army for the Defense of the 
Hebrew Language" who broke into the theater, threw ink at the screen and smoke bombs 
at the crowd. The police eventually broke through the mob and made arrests, but the 
protestors returned a second time and forced the screening to end, although many of the 
viewers refused to leave the theater until the lights were shut off. This was just one of 
numerous violent attacks on Yiddish culture in pre-statehood Palestine, where Hebraists 
were intent on repressing the language that they held in contempt.

"Yiddish was a force to be reckoned with in this period. It provided the name for and was 
an integral part of the Yiddishist movement that posed an alternative to Zionism. . . . The 
language issue became a convenient tool of political conflict within contemporary Jewish 
culture." --Yael Chaver, What Must Be Forgotten: The Survival of Yiddish in Zionist 
Palestine

Subject: "Es loyfn, es yogn shvartse volkns"

A version of this song can be found online sung by Aliza Azikri on a recording called 
Festival of Yiddish songs - 1973. I suspect it is not the original because it is credited: 
Composer: Rafi Gabai
Lyrics Source:	H D Nomberg.

Subject: Yoshke Pandre

When I was a little boy and my mother spanked me or threatened to spank me an uncle of 
mine used to tease me with this little verse:  Yoshke Pandre  ligt oyfn bank, az men 
shmayst em, zogt er a dank.  Even at the age of three  or four I understood that he was 
teasing me.  Years later I came to understand that Yoshke, a familiar form of Jehoshua, 
was a slightly disrespectful term for Jesus. Many years later, when we were already in 
Canada, I asked my uncle if he knew the meaning of Pandre.  He did not, nor did my 
father who was a graduate of a yeshive in our (so called) home town of Wilno.  I also 
asked a well known poet friend of the family about Pandre.  He was familiar with the 
verse but he also did not know the meaning origin of  Pandre. Sometimes in the l970s I 
came across a book "The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross" by a specialist in ancient  
semitic languages, John Allegro.  In this book he tries to prove that the Christian bible is 
nothing but a cover story for an ancient mushroom cult which dabbled with LSD.  
(Mishuge mayne sonim.)   This is where I again encountered our friend Yoshke Pandre 
on p.125.In the footnotes to this chapter he also claims that the rabbis referred to Jesus by 
that name in the Talmud.  Apparently, this was the name of the Roman who fathered 
Jesus.  The connection being that the mushroom amanita muscaria has a spotted head and 
the panther (pandera in Greek) has a spotted skin. So, it seems that we Jews have been 
despised for countless generations for  having crucified a sacred mushroom.

Subject: frande/fronde/prande/pronde

Due to the archaic orthography, the Yiddish word I am inquiring about could be any of 
these. It occurs in a handwritten letter, as follows: tayere frande madam bermann [body 
of letter]
ayer frande bibi
Can anyone tell me what it means? 

Thanks in advance,

Martin Jacobs
