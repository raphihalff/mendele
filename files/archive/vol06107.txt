Subject: Young Sholem Aleichem tries convoluted manipulations

A letter from 30-year-old Sholem Aleichem to his brother Elyohu reveals
something about social customs of 1889 in a state of rapid change.
Courting and marriage protocols were obviously in flux.

The letter was written in Hebrew and translated into Yiddish by Itskhak
Dov Berkovitsh, himself a Yiddish and Hebrew master. Tendency to flowery
style is a property of Hebrew melitse. The transliterated Yiddish is
given below (edited here and there). My translation (in my next post) is
from the Yiddish. (Traduttore, traditore?)

Sholem Aleichem was guardian of the niece who is the young woman
targeted for a marriage proposal. The convoluted maneuvers proposed to
manipulate a couple (especially the woman) not very much younger than
Sholem Aleichem testify to the aggravations imposed by resistance to
rapid social change. The phrase, hayntike tsaytn (modern times), was
later echoed in the Tevye story about Tsaytl, Hayntike Kinder (Modern
Children). The major part of Tevye's stories is concerned with Tevye's
anguish in dealing with changing marriage customs he cannot yet
accommodate easily. This letter was written six years before the first
Tevye story was published, and ten years before Hayntike Kinder was
published. The subject retained Sholem Aleichem's attention.

The P.S. is interesting. Sholem Aleichem wants his brother to write
Hebrew, not Yiddish. Although Sholem Aleichem was already a very famous
writer of Yiddish he was not yet a Yiddishist. Was he still oppressed
(as some of our contemporaries are) by the notion that Yiddish was not
fit for respectable discourse or literature?

[Dos Sholem-Aleykhem Bukh, p.35]

[English translation]

Kiev, September 6, 1889

My dear brother!

The match proposed by your wife, my sister-in-law Miriam, about Mr. * is much
to my liking because I've heard for a long time that these people are
cultivated, upright and honorable, and especially that Doctor * is a trusted
man well like by all who know him. He is crowned with charm and graciousness.
It is most certain of such people that their younger son is also good and
honorable and a fine person. However, there is an evil spirit on that path,
and he stands in the way, and his hand has drawn its sword. A Jewish daughter
_in these modern times_ would under no circumstances agree to make a
commitment through a marriage broker or even with the suitor himself if he
comes to see and be seen. God forbid! Moreover, if the matter appeals to H.
*, he must be, besides a prospective bridegroom with nice eyes, a person
greatly gifted as a diplomat. And so his visit here must be disguised
(incognito). His educated brother, Dr. *, lives here and has been my friend
for half a year; and so it would be quite natural for the young man to come
see his elder brother. Together, both will come to my house seeking an
introduction, as is the general custom. As all who enter the gates of my city
know, educated people find it of use to visit me because my house is a
gathering place for the wise and enlightened of Kiev. My advice, brother, is
to convey all of this to Mr. *. He and his son should write to the elder son,
the doctor. Then, if the way seems clear, the aforementioned suitor should
come to Kiev to visit his brother. While here, he will find a way to visit me
at home, and I will introduce him to my wife and to the daughter of my
brother-in-law; and if he pleases them, and if the matter is fated by God,
then this young man would be the happiest man on this earth, because without
flattery I can say this about the daughter of my brother-in-law: _how fine
for the one who would have such a person_. Know this, brother, that people
propose matches for her to me at the level of _one hundred thousand rubles_;
but the eyes of us all are directed not to money but to the essence. .... I
have _not_ forgotten the main point: all this must remain hidden and sealed.
.... and most important, the intended bride should not know nor understand
the slightest bit, or, heaven forbid, the evil spirit will stand before Got
to spoil the matter from beginning to end, nullifying everything. ....

Sholem

P.S. In every case, I ask you to write me in _Hebrew_ and not Yiddish.

Louis Fridhandler
