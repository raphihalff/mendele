Subject: Other Yiddish Internet groups

In the May 5 Forward, there was an article by Tom Teicholz on Jewish
information available through the Internet.  Among others, the article
refers to the Yiddish Voice of Brookline, Mass,  the Virtual Shtetl
(University of North Carolina) and YIVO on-line.

If anyone has the specific Internet addresses for these lists, and any
comments about any of them, I'd be interested.  Surprisingly, the article
did not mention Mendele.

Subject: Genendel

I poked around in the archives to find the beginning of the discussion of
Genendel. Since there are so many different spellings, I can't be sure
how far back the discussion goes, and whether what I heard as the
explanation has already been mentioned.

Gnendl, I read somewhere, comes from a Germanic word gnanne, which is
supposed to mean "grandmother". The logic behind naming a girl Gnendl is
the same as that of the male "Alter". You want to draw the evil eye away
from the child by fooling it that it is in fact old. Azoy iz geven di

     Came across this post in another capacity and couldn't resist
sharing it with the hevreh-leit on Mendele who may wish to pursue it.
Unfortunately I can neither vouch for its accuracy or offer additional
information.

                      TRANSLATIONS PROGRAM


The Division of Research Programs of the National Endowment for the
Humanities welcomes applications for translation projects. Translations
grants support individual or collaborative projects to translate into
English works that provide insight into the history, literature,
philosophy, and artistic achievements of other cultures.  The Endowment
welcomes print and electronic publications that make available to
scholars, students, teachers, and general readers the thought and
learning of both ancient and modern civilizations.

Translations supported by the Endowment provide introductions and
explanatory annotations that clearly establish the historical and
intellectual contexts of the work.

Awards in the Translations Program are made for up to three years and
usually range from $30,000 to $150,000, depending on the scope and
magnitude of the project.

The new deadline is JULY 1, 1995, for projects beginning no earlier than
May of the next year.

For application material and further information, write or call:

Subject: Yiddish in _The Economist_

A colleague brought to my attention an article which appeared in the May
6, 1995 edition of The Economist entitled "Jerusalem on the Amur" on
Birobidzhan.

The article refers to Yiddish as "the Eastern European Jewish
folk-language written in Hebrew characters".

What is a folk-language?  Is Yiddish a folk-language?

Thanks for any clarification which might be offered.

Subject: Yiddish theater

Herman Yablokoff's English version of his autobiography has just come off
the press. It is called, "Der Payatz." (The Clown). It chronicles his
early years in Grodno, his rise to fame in the Yiddish theater. He was
the author of the haunting song, "Papirosn." Another song of his, "Shveig
Mein Hartz," was plagiarized into the hit song, "Nature Boy."

He was the only performer to entertain in the displaced persons camp
after WWII. He details his travels there under the auspices of the
American Joint Distribution Committee.

A beautifully written book available from Bartleby Press; 11141 Georgia
Ave.; Silver Spring, MD 20902.
