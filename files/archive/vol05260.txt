For the last several months, I've been standing behind the door so to speak,
reading and taking pleasure from the various subjects under discussion on
Mendele. I've recently become aware that one should identify oneself, so I
offer the following details:

My name is Shirley Kumove (at home I was known as Soreh) Born in Toronto,
parents from Lodz, Poland; we generally spoke in Yiddish. As a girl, I was a
student at the Borochov School under the tutelage of the Menachovksys.

A late bloomer, I've become somewhat of a writer and translator. Wrote a book
called Words Like Arrows, A Collection of Yiddish Folk Sayings. The sequel
called, More Words, More Arrows, A Further Collection of Yiddish Folk Sayings,
is presently with an American publishing house. God willing, we should live
and be well, it will also see the light of day. Another manuscript, the
complete poems of Anna Margolin, translated into English under the title,
Drunk On The Bitter Truth, is now with a Canadian publisher and here too, we
hope to hear good news about publication. Last year, the book, Found
Treasures, Stories by Yiddish Women Writers, was published. Several stories I
translated are included in this collection. The initial print run was 5,000
copies  which was sold out the first year. A second edition of 5,000 copies is
now available. It seems the book is well received.

I think I've given you enough details. It's time to hustle back to work.
Regards to all and let's keep talking Yiddish!

Subject: Introductions and a query

After months of lurking, it's time to say hello (or as Mikhl would say, Good
Morning).  We are Mikhl Katz and Libe Gritz, active members of the Boston
Yiddish community.  We're among the founders of a lively branch of the
Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring in Boston, which sponsors many Yiddish and
Yiddish cultural events and activities, including a Sunday school with over
100 children.  If you're in town on the second Thursday of the month, come to
our Yiddish Vinkl to shmooze in Yiddish.  On the fourth Thursday of the month,
come sing Yiddish songs with us.

Libe attended a Workmen's Circle shule and Camp Kinder Ring, while Mikhl's
shule was a descendant of the IWO or "linke" shuln, and he and his family have
been active Camp Kinderlanders going on four generations.  Therefore some
consider us a mixed marriage (between the Yiddish left and the Yiddish far
left) .  We are pleased to report progress in thawing relations between these
two bastions of secular Yiddishkayt that parted company 70 years ago.

To paraphrase Yehudes Nisnholts from a recent issue of Yugntruf, Yiddish was
our mame's loshn but not our mame-loshn.  We are not fluent in Yiddish, but
thanks to a kick in the pants from our good friend Khayem Bochner, who said
"Beser a tsebrokhene Yidish vi nisht kayn Yidish," we are speaking a
tsebrokhene Yiddish with our 7- and 5-year old children, Perl Ester and
Benyomen Noyakh.  They understand Yiddish much better than they speak it, and
they delight in correcting our mistakes.  Perl simply cannot understand why
Bubbe-Zeyde and Bubbie-Zeydie did not speak Yiddish with us when we were
children!  It was a mekhaye to visit the National Yiddish Book Center and
surround our children with hundreds of thousands of Yiddish books, including
shelves upon shelves of their great-grandfather Moyshe Katz's literary and
political books and great-grandmother Esther Katz's book of poems for
children.

Which brings us to our query.  Mikhl's father Lyber Katz, in addition to
writing a monthly column for the magazine Jewish Currents, is translating some
of his father's autobiographical essays edited by Paul Novick in Di Moyshe
Katz Bukh.  Zeyde Moyshe writes that his earliest memory (at age 2, in 1887,
in the Byelorussian shtetl of Dokshits) is of a song, and we were wondering if
anyone is familiar with the words and music. Here are the Yiddish lyrics as
remembered by Moyshe Katz, followed by Lyber Katz's English translation.

Feygele, feygele,
Pi-pi-pi,
Vu iz der tate?
Geforn in ru.
Vos t'er brengen?
A fesele bir.
Vu t'men shteln?
Hintern tir.
Ver vet trinken?
Ikh mit dir.

Tiny bird, tiny bird,
Peep-peep-peep,
Where is your daddy?
Away on a trip.
What will he bring?
A mug of beer.
Where will we put it?
Behind the door in the rear.
Who will drink it?
Maybe you and I.

Any further information would be greatly appreciated.  It may not be a
wonderful song but, as Moyshe Katz writes elsewhere, "...di ershte ayndrukn
fun der kindhayt un yugnt, vikhtike nit far zikh aleyn, nor bloyz derfar, vayl
zey hobn pasirt, farblaybn in zikorn oyf eybik."  (...the first impressions of
childhood and youth, important not of themselves, but simply because they
happened, remain in memory forever)

A sheynem dank to our Shames who enables lovers of Yiddishkayt to find each
other and spread the word by blits-post!

Yidish lebt!

Subject: Khasidish or misnagdish

Another satirical reference to the khasidim's belief in the omnipotenet powers
of their Rebe are the lyrics to the song 'chiribiom'. I don't remeber all the
words but it goes something like:

zogt der rebe tsi di khmare
her oyf gisen vaser
ale khsidim zenen triken aroys
nor der rebe iz aroys a naser

By the way, is the term 'misnagdish' correct? While 'khsidish' is a commonly
used word I have never heard the term 'misnagdish'. For eg. one would say 'er
shtamt fin a khsidishe shtib' but for a misnaged it would be 'er kimt fin a
mishpokhe fin misnagdim'.

Subject: The Shamrock Prize

Iosif Vaisman [5.258] cites the Jerusalem Post's report on the award of the
Israel Prize to Professor "Hana Shamrock". The correct name is, of course,
Khone Shmeruk.

The problem obviously arise from an attempt to render an essentially vowelless
script into readable form in the latin alphabet.

Having sublet Shmeruk's apartment in Jerusalem many years ago, I was
frequently a party to telephone conversations of which the following will
serve as a model:

Telephone rings and I answer

"Shalom"
"Erev tov, efshar ledaber im Khana?"
(Good evening, may I speak to Khana? --female)
"Khone (male) eynenu" (Khone's not here)
"Eyfo hi?" (Where is she?)
"Hu beanglia akhshav" (He's in England now)
"Khana beanglia!?" (with surprise: Khana's in England?)
"Lo, lo, Khone beanglia. (No, no, Khone's in England)
"Khana Shmorak?" (khes-nun-hey  shin-mem-vov-reysh-kuf)
"Lo, Khone Shmeruk" (khes-nun-alef  shin-mem-reysh-vov-kuf
"Slakh li, ta-iti" (Sorry, I made a mistake.)

Subject: The Shamrock Prize

Hebrew spelling can mislead and the Jerusalem Post is easily misled,
especially about matters Yiddish.  Not "Shamrock" -- with its quaint Irish
associations, but Shmeruk.  The first name is Khone (sometimes spelled Chone),
a quite common Jewish name (cf. Khone Hamaagal).

Subject: Prof. Shamrock?

The winner of the Israel Prize, referred to by Iosif Vaisman, is of course not
Hana Shamrock, but Chone Shmeruk, a great scholar of Yiddish literature.
Someone at the Jerusalem Post, it would seem, did not do their homework.
