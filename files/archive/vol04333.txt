Subject: Introduction

I'm actually a snowbird from Toronto where many long years ago I
completed "mittle shule" at the Workmans circle Peretz Shule.  However
for the next 50-60 years I had little opportunity to put my knowledge to
use.  Can speak and write easily but when it comes to reading dos iz an
andere tsure.  Well this is a begining.  Alevay.

Subject: Tevye

Nokh epes on Tevye, in response to Danielle Harpaz and her class:

in calling Tevye's position on Chava's marriage a "dogma," I didn't mean
anything pejorative, and didn't mean anything that's at odds with your
calling it "faithfulness." Rather I meant to get at a certain quality in
that position, namely, that it's not subject to examination.  Tevye can
ask himself why the wealth of a prospective son-in-law should matter, or
why the politics of another prospective son-in-law should matter, but he
can't really ask himself why it should matter that a prospective
son-in-law should be a gentile.  That makes his position one of faith, or
one of dogma, and one that in that sense is not accessible to the sort of
questioning skepticism he addresses to other positions.

Subject: Rogelekh; Krupin's dictionary

1.  A reminder, though, that we discovered in our pursuit of the
etymology of _rogelekh_ that in fact it is not etymologically related to
_rog_ 'corner'. Yiddish _rogelekh_ is related to Polish _rogal_,
Ukrainian _rohal_ (and diminutive forms thereof).

2. H. Hartman mentioned that Krupin's  dictionary was republished. Could
you share the bibliographic reference with us?  Thanks in advance.

Subject: A Hebrew-Yiddish Puzzle for your amusement

A woman who speaks both Hebrew and Yiddish answers the telephone. The
call is for her husband who is resting and also speaks both languages. To
alert him and be sure that he understands, she calls him simultaneously
in both languages. Her message is understandable and appropriate in both
languages, but the words and their meanings are completely different.

What did she say?

Subject: Mazl

A friend sent me this:

What can you tell me of the concept of "mazel" in Yiddish life?
I'm reminded of that when I think of my good health which, with
conscious superstition, I attribute to luck; and along the same lines
sometimes worry and wonder that my " luck " is going to be used up,
run out. I consciously use "luck" in the Northern European (Germanic
people's) sense for whom "luck" is (was) a quantity with which people
are born; thus some with little luck, others with much luck. Luck can
be used up, so that people can run out of luck, or lose their luck.
While Americans today use the word luck in the above way all the
time they have little consciousness of its derivation or the total
concept.

The Yiddish/Hebrew "maz(a)l" is translated as "luck". and is today
certainly used by Americans Jews in the way the Germanic peoples used it.
But is it really the same? It is I suppose a good possibility that
European Jews picked up the concept of luck and gave it their own term,
although the word "glik\gluk" is in Yiddish in addition to "mazl."  Are
they simple alternatives or are they getting at different concepts.  Try
that on Mendele. I'm not on Mendele because I would have not much to
contribute and because, in all honesty, chatting about Yiddish is not a
high priority. Still it might be fun to lurk.
