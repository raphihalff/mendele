The word "kumer" is of German origin and means grief.

Subject: Az me lebt and terms of endearment 

Az me lebt: What we said in our Yinglish subculture back in Brooklyn in the
'40s-'50s was 'You live long enough, you see everything.' And I recall it
being used only for an unexpected GOOD turn of events. Thus, this was NOT an
equivalent of 'Live and learn' and certainly not 'You make your bed, you lie
in it' (both of which were also quite frequent in their own right).

Terms of endearment: my recollection is that the original query (don't still
have it, sorry) was for terms of endearment for a significant other, not for
children. One that hasn't been mentioned that I think has a nice yiddish
flavor is _basherte(r)_. And of course there's _gelibte(r)_, which I also
don't think has been mentioned. 

I'm beginning to think the problem may be that many Mendelniks are not
familiar with the term 'significant other'! It means 'SEXUAL partner' --
spouse, lover, POSSLQ, mate, partner, mistress, main man -- whoever one beds
down with on a regular basis, regardless of legal status or sexual
orientation.  I'm finding all these endearing names for children that are 
being suggested really quite kinky for Mendele... ;) (I can hear 
Freud saying 'I told you so!' ;) )

Subject: "Yoyl-lid" oder "Anniversary Song"

Mendele 3.134 contained my approximate transcription of Chaim Tauber's Yiddish
text of "Anniversary Song," as sung in a recording by Jan Peerce.  It was
similar to the text quoted in 7.050 by Elliot Gertel.  I can now cite sheet
music of "Der khasene valts," published by Metro Music and Hensley Music Co.
as "Der chasene waltz (The Wedding Waltz)" with a copyright date of 1963.  
(The original copyright was granted to the arranger, Henry Lefkowitch, in 
1947.)  Tauber's text (including an additional verse that may or may not be
his) is as follows:

	Akh, yene nakht, yene gliklikhe nakht
	hot freyd on a shir far undz beyde gebrakht.
	Tsum ershtn mol ven ikh hob dikh gezen [gezeyn],
	geshpilt hot dan di muzik azoy sheyn.

		Tsvey yunge hertser mir zenen geven [geveyn],
		libes gefiln umshuldik un reyn.
		Gedrikt hob ikh dir azoy tsertlikh tsu mir,
		zikh ayngelibt bald in dir.

		Koym zikh dervart, fun der shul nor aroys,
		gefayert a khasene, glik azoy groys.
		Gedenkstu di nakht, s'hot geshpilt di muzik,
		dem zelbn valts fun glik.

	Kum, tants mit mir undzer valts fun amol,
	Gehat nor mit dir hob ikh glik on a tsol.
	Biz in mayn toyt blaybt mir liber fun alts
	fun yener nakht undzer khasene valts.

Tsugegebener ferz:    

	Lebt nokh di nakht azoy frish vi amol,
	freyd un layd durkhgemakht hobn mir on a tsol.
	Khotsh zilber di hor un di fis oykh shoyn mid,
	In harts klingt gor klor fun dem tants undzer lid.	

In 3.134 I pointed out that the original music was from an instrumental piece
called "Valurile Dunari" ("Waves of the Danube") by the Romanian composer Ion
Ivanovici, first published in 1880 in Bucharest, and later popular throughout
Europe. According to James J. Fuld's _The Book of World-Famous Music: 
Classical, Popular and Folk_, the English text of "Anniversary Song" was 
written by Al Jolson and Saul Chaplin for "The Jolson Story" in 1943, but Ron
Robboy's citation of 1946 (7.050) and attribution to Chaplin alone may well be
more accurate.  Incidentally, the sheet music of "Der chasene waltz" also
contains an English reworking of Tauber's Yiddish text by Stanley Lionel.

From: "Stanley F. (Shimke) Levine" <Shimke@ibm.net>
Subject: Yoyvl-lid

Elliot Gertel asks for clarification of the text he transcribed from a 
recording of Yoyvl-lid.  Although I do not know this piece, I believe I can
help with one line:

> _libes_gefiln_ un _shildet_ (?) un _reyn_,

is doubtless "libes-gefiln, unshuldik [pron: --shildik] un reyn," 

i.e. "feelings of love, innocent and pure"

> _gedrikt_ hob ikh dir azoy tsertlekh tsu mir,

sounds like good Yiddish:  "I pressed you so tenderly to me" (i.e. I embraced
you so tenderly)

> zikh _eybelekh_faln_ in dir.

this line remains a mystery to me.

Subject: Verlaine in Yiddish

Al Grand writes that he would welcome  additional translations for the
Verlaine poem "II pleure dans mon coeur." My translations:

Al Grand shraybt az er volt geven dankbar far nokh iberzetsungen fun der
Verlaine poeme "Il pleure dans mon coeur." Mayne iberzetsungen:

Es khlipet in harts
Vi es dripet in shtot.
Vos iz  di shmakht 
Vos ikh fil in mayn harts?

un:

Es veynt in mayn harts
Vi es gist oyf der gas.
Vos iz di umru
Vos dergeyt mir tsum harts? 

"Di umru," the universal anxiety at  this period, [19th cent.] was called in
 French "mal du siecle" and in German "weltschmerz". However, Verlaine had
his own particular troubles. In a poem , from the collection "Sagesse" first
published in 1881, Verlaine is in jail for having shot and wounded his best
friend, for whom he had left his wife.  He looks out from the high window of
his little prison cell and sees a small patch of  sky--'so blue, so calm.'
The last stanza sums up his feeling. The poet asks himself:

"Di umru," di universale melankholie in der tsayt [19tn y.h.] hot men gerufn
in frantsoyzish "le mal du siecle,"  un in daytsh, "weltschmerz." Ober
Verlaine hot gehat zayne eygene tsores. In a poeme fun der zamlung "Sagesse,"
aroysgegebn in 1881, Verlaine iz in tfise vayl er hot geshosn un gevundet
zayn noentstn fraynd, far vemen er  hot ibergelozt zayn vayb. Er kukt aroys
fun'm hoykhn fentster in zayn tfise kemerl, un zet a kleyn shtikele  himl,
'azoy bloy, azoy ruik..' Der letster ferz sumirt zayn gefil. Der poet fregt
zikh aleyn:

Qu'as tu fait, o toi que voila
Pleurant sans cesse,
Dis, qu'as tu fait, toi que voila,
De ta jeunesse?

In Yidish:

Vos hostu geton, vos  bist do,
Veynendik on oyfher...
Zog, vos hostu geton, vos bist do ....
Mit dayne yunge yorn?

un

Vos hostu geton,az bist do,
Veynendik keseyder,
Zog, vos hostu gemakht, do tsu zayn
Fun dayne yunge yorn?

Subject: Anniversary waltz 

The Anniversary Waltz is printed in sheet music under the title "Khasene
valts" words by Chaim Tauber and music by Ivanovici. A copy can be obtained
by contacting Leo Greenbaum or Gunner at the YIVO Archives (RG 212-Sheetmusic 
Fl67) or Chana Mlotek, music archivist, upon her return from Klezkanada on
Monday.  I also went to Maud's Summer Ray with my parents when I was a child
and have very warm memories of it.  I remember the artist Zuni and his sister
Bessie Maud, the proprietress of the hotel, the dancers Katya Delakova and
Fred Berk who performed there. I know that the great folklorist Y. L. Cahan
and the eminent linguist and literary historian Zalmen Reisen were also guests
(Reisen was possibly a guest of Cahan's then). Cahan collected songs from the
Muldovan family, who lived down the road - their names occur among his
informants.  What was your [Goldberg's] father's name?
It's like hearing from a landsman.  Greetings!

Subject: Yiddish, litvish and poylish

The following is an excerpt of a letter in last Friday's edition of the UK's
Jewish Chronicle. I'm sure one of our learned friends will provide an answer.

"Greater Lithuania... absorbed large chunks of Russia and Poland until it went
into decline in the 16th century, and was itself absorbed by Poland in 1569.

"This raises an interesting point for Yiddish.

"There are recognised Lithuanian and Polish pronunciations in Yiddish but, as
far as I know, no Lithuanian words in Yiddish. There are, however, a number of
Polish words in Yiddish - shmutter (rag) from the Polish szmata; shpilkes
(nervy, tenterhooks) from the Polish szpilka.

"I write subject to correction, but why is it that there appear to be no
Lithuanian words in Yiddish?

David Herskovic
