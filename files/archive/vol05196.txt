Subject: Holy fool

I have been asked by an academic friend of mine in Social Studies of
Science at Deakin University, Australia, to ask the mendelyaners this
question:

"Is there a Jewish Trickster myth? A little hard to formulate concisely
especially when I guess the obvious answer in the Jewish Joke which is so
dependent on ironic deflation of authority.

Is there the equivalent of the fool or the trickster or the jester in
Jewish storytelling, mythology or vernacular whose role is jointly to
transgress boundaries and to deliniate them or as Kerenyi says 'to add
disorder to order and so make a whole, to render possible within the
fixed bounds of what is permitted, an experience of what is not
permitted.' "

If anyone has any references I can give him, or any ideas I'd be grateful
and he would too!

Subject: A home page for itinerant klezmer music?

While listening to some klezmer music on the radio today,  reading
something compiuterish - it suddenly hit me - for us klezmerphiles
a home page  including record/tape/CD titles, news of upcoming concerts,
articles/reviews, perhaps description of major library holdings of
music [any medium, including scores ..] would be - poshet, a m'khaye
nefushos!  But there may already exist such a thing, or on some
other Jewish site all this kind of info is already assembled.

Gut yontef,

Mark Pinson

Subject: You say tsures, I say tsores

The "Week in Review" section of today's (Dec. 17, 1995) "New York Times"
has an article by Nicholas D. Kristof (former Beijing correspondent)
entitled "Dung!  What an Unusual Name!"  The article deals with what the
author (confusingly) describes as "one of the foreign policy problems
that Americans face -- transliteration, the messy task of transcribing
foreign names and words into English." Examples include Roh (pronounced
"Noh") Tae Woo and Deng (pronounced "Dung") Xiao Ping.  In his article,
Kristof writes:

    The difficulties of transcription are particularly acute in Semitic
    languages.  Arabic, for example, has a letter called the ayn that is
    simply unpronounceable by Americans; it comes from the back of the
    throat and sounds like you're about to cough....

    Yiddish offers similar difficulties.  Leo Rosten, the author of 'The
    Joys of Yiddish,' offers tsuris, tsouris, tsoriss and tsuriss as
    spellings for the word that rhymes with 'juris' and translates as
    'troubles.'  When faced with those four choices, Sol Steinmetz, the
    author of 'Yiddish and English,' favors none of the above.  He
    prefers tsores or tsures.

Transliteration needs to be distinguished from transcription.
Transliteration refers to letter-for-letter matches between alpha- bets;
transcription deals with rendering the pronunciation of one language into
the writing system of another.  In any event, I would not wish tsures or
tsores on anyone!

Subject: Chanukah o Chanukah

A happy holiday to everyone.  My wife would really like to have the
Yiddish words to Chanukah O Chanukah, and I would be deeply appreciative
to anyone who could supply them.  Thanks.

Subject: The spell[ing] of "Khanike, O Khanike"

The various spellings, or rather misspellings, of the word "khanike"
probably rival in number the proverbial spelling of the name "Noyekh mit
zibn grayzn" (that is, spelled with seven errors).

The khanike card this year of the giant designing and printing concern of
the Hallmark greeting cards reads:

"It's Chanukah!  Time for People Everywhere to Repeat those Familiar
Words of the Season," and inside the card it shows several narrow
cartoon-like balloons with questions, supposedly asked by different
people:

"Is it one /K/ or two?"
"Well, is there an /H/ on the end?"
"Do I pronounce the /Ch/ like I'm clearing my throat?"
"How many /N's/ are there again?"

My answers, in the above order:  One /k/;  No /h/ at the end; /Ch/ like
throat-clearing , but _/Kh/_ instead;  and one /n/, thus "khanuke."

Phonetically it should be spelled "khanike," with an /i/ in place of the
/u,/ but "khanuke" would also be acceptable, reflecting the Hebrew
spelling from which the word derives.

Subject: Convergence-dialects developing in modern urban Yiddish among
         Chasidic communities

A request for research leads:

A fellow-Mendelyaner told me recently that there had been some discussion
a few months ago on Mendele of the newly-emerging convergence-dialects of
post-1945 modern urban Yiddish, notably among Chasidic communities -
specific to sizeable Chasidic centers such as New York, Montreal,
Toronto, Melbourne, Buenos Aires, Paris, in anglophone countries (US,
Canada, Australia) and elsewhere (Argentina, France).

To my knowledge no linguistic, dialectal or sociolinguistic
investigations have yet looked at this in detail. I'm especially
interested in the sociolinguistic mechanisms whereby these dialectally
distinguishing features would have arisen, and might be spreading,
between relatively self-contained individual Yiddish-speaking Khsidishe
communities in particular cities.

If any Mendelyaner have more information on this question, or better
still evidence, references, or sources for tracking this phenomenon, I'd
be very grateful if you could let me know.

If possible I'd also like to be able to look at the comparative impact of
Yiddish's principal bilingualism-partner languages - historically German,
East and West Slavic, and now, recently, English, Hebrew, Spanish,
French, etc. The new convergence-based dialectalism has important
additional linguistic and sociocultural implications for issues of the
emergence of standard dialects (as opposed to artificially-imposed
norms), which was the focus of some of the debate on Mendele a little
while ago, in relation to "standard" Yiddish in general.
