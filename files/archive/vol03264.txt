Subject: The name for 'Yidish'

The Yiddish word 'Yidish' developed in an environment which truly
was Eurocentric. Few Europeans in the middle ages had any concept of
the world more than a few kilometres from their homes, let alone the
modern-style 'sophistication' to worry about whether their
terminology was politically correct.

When English speakers finally began to speak in an academic or
scholarly fashion about the Yiddish language (many generations after
it had come into existence) the English language, being (among other
things) the language of the British Empire, already possessed a
global context. It may not have been a conscious effort to avoit
Eurocentricity which led to calling the language Yiddish, but one
cannot deny that the far-reaching nature of English at the time
would have had an influence. The English language, for example, had
long contained the word 'Hebrew' which was already known to be a
Jewish Language. So while in Yiddish, the name of the language tends
to reflect, in parts, the insular nature of its original speakers,
in English, this context is not a part of the Yiddish paradigm.
Additionally, as I mentioned in the past, the very nature of the
spoken Yiddish language (with it inherent subtleties and implied
meanings) makes it almost impossible to achieve ambiguity about the
word 'Yidish' while English, spoken and written, does not possess
these qualities.

Subject: Re: sports terms

We don't do "DE-fense" in our pickup volleyball games at Yugntruf's
yidish-vokh, but the organizers last year prepared a whole two-sided
sheet of sports terms.  I believe Binyomin Schaechter put it
together.  It's titled "Sports Terminology (Yugntruf Yiddish
retreat, September 1993)".

It shows "to save" (under General Terminology) as "rateven". No
surprise there.  Under Basketball, "to block" is "blokiern".  Feh.
I recall discussing this concept with Binyomin while I was going at
one of the hoops placed lower than 10 ft., and he said what I was
doing was slam-dunkiern.

Subject: (1) mansehs again and (2) shmoolyaris

Re Zachary Baker's remarks on Philologus on HENRY (not Philip)
   Roth's new book and responses to them:

Hasn't there been enough last year by those who grew up saying
'manses/ mansehs in some form to not need any reopening of this?  It
would seem that Lodzer/Galician Yiddish among others did more than
just nasalize and did put in an 'n' sound.

I do remember 'shmoolyaris' as being used in relation to
money/dollars, but my recollection here is hazy.  I suggest Zach
that you ask Mike Baker about this one.

I don't think there's any connection of 'shmoolyaris' to 'simoleon,'
the latter being an old American slang term whose origin the OED
(Vol. IV, Supplement, p.190) gives as "obscure" but perhaps modeled
on Napoleon.  OED gives 1896 as first print use by George Ade, but
he spelled it 'samoleon'.  I recall it from detective stories and
movies, and used on the streets of New York in relation to gambling.
OED also cites Alan Lomax's use of 'simoleons' in his (1952) Mister
Jelly Roll, referring to a much earlier time.

NB: 'fegelah' now appears as an English word in R.L. Chapman's
(1989) Thesaurus of American Slang (p.102), one of many nouns for a
gay male.
