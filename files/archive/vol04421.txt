Subject: A Yiddish itinerary

Travel Yiddish America (TYA) is an attempt to develop a trip which would
visit the major Yiddish institutions, and Yiddish clubs in the US and
Canada. Probably no one will do the entire trip, but selected segments
could make for an exciting vacation.

Imagine just the one leg from Boston to Miami. This would read like a
Who's Who in the Yiddish World. The trip across Canada is laden with
centers rivaling the best in the world. Wouldn't you truly enjoy the
scenery enroute from Phoenix through San Diego, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Portland, Seattle to Vancouver?

Our first task is to identify the Yiddish institutions and groups. The
AAA can then lay out the trip on a map, and that part would not take our
effort. Perhaps we could include events and meeting dates so that our
arrival would maximize our opportunity of getting the most out of our
journey.

At some distant time we could include recommended places to stay and
dine. Feedback would come from our travelers and local Yiddish clubs.
This information could be noted on Mendele and would be available to all.

Der bay will publish articles starting  this September on progress made
in developing the journey. If you are interested in writing an article on
a location or a particular portion of the trip, please contact Fishl
directly so as not to burden Mendele. Post online or write to him:

      Jewish Labor Committee Protests Use of Non-Union Labor
                 by National Yiddish Book Center
                              -----
                Calls on Community to Join Protest

MAY 12, 1995 -- NYC    The Jewish Labor Committee has issued a call to
the Jewish community to join in asking the National Yiddish Book Center
to reconsider its recent decision to continue its relationship with a
contractor which has no collective bargaining agreement with its workers.
The Book Center, the nation's largest agency collecting and distributing
Yiddish books, is expanding a new facility in South Hadley, MA.

The JLC intervened at the request of Mark Erlich, Business
Manager/Financial Secretary of Local 40 of the Carpenters and Joiners
Union, based in Cambridge, MA.  Erlich is also the grandson of Henryk
Erlich, a leader of the Jewish Labor Bund in Poland, who was arrested and
later executed by the Soviet Union in 1941.  Despite attempts by Erlich
and others to convince NYBC to drop the non-union contractor, and
discussions with members of the Center's board, the Center decided to
continue its relationship with its non-union contractor, rather than
utilize one of several unionized alternatives.

The National Yiddish Book Center was formed not only to collect and
redistribute Yiddish books, but also to preserve and share with younger
Jews Yiddish culture and tradition. That culture is intimately linked
with the history of the Jewish labor movement.

The JLC is asking interested individuals to contact the National Yiddish
Book Center, and ask them to switch their business to one of the union
bidders for the project.

       South Hadley, MA   01075

                 ABOUT THE JEWISH LABOR COMMITTEE

The JLC has represented the organized Jewish community on questions
relating to trade unionism and human rights since 1934, when it was
founded as a labor-based rescue operation in response to the rise of
Nazism in Europe.

Today, the JLC works to maintain and strengthen the historically strong
relationship between the American Jewish community and the trade union
movement, and to promote the shared social justice agenda of both
communities.

Information about our current activities is available upon request by
