Subject: Jews in France

In connection with the remarks of Harold L. Orbach on the use of the
terms Israelite vs. Juif in France, I woud like to add that I still
recall clearly that as a boy in France during the 1940s, I was not
infreqently apostrophized as "sale Juif" (dirty Jew) by some of my
classmates. Well-intentioned people (such as teachers) would invariably
refer to me as israelite. In several trips to France taken since 1990, I
have noted that the term juif appears to have largely lost its pejorative
undertones, and is used freely both by Jews and non-Jews. Only in
conversation with elderly French people (in their seventies or older) did
I encounter the use of the term israelite.

With regard to the remarks of Martin Davis concerning the two monuments
to the "deportees" in Paris, I would like to add the following:

[1] The best available estimates for the number of Jews deported from
France is a maximum of 76 000, so that it does not seem advisable to
state that most of the 200,000 deportees from France were Jews [see Serge
Klarsfeld, "Le Calendrier de la Persecution des Juifs en France
1940-1944", Paris, 1993, p 1125]

[2] While it is true that the Memorial du Martyr Juif Inconnu, located at
17, rue Geoffroy-l'Asnier, in the 4th arrondissement, was built solely
under Jewish auspices, the land on which it stands was donated by the
City of Paris

Subject: The "gram-mayster" of WEVD

Yiddish-lovers who lived in New York during the 1960s - 1980s period
surely remember Tzvi Schooler, the wonderful commentator and
"gram-mayster" of Yiddish radio station WEVD ("the station that speaks
your language").  His rhymed Yiddish commentaries on the world news were
often difficult for me to follow, but his Yiddish was eloquent and his
wit was sharp and well-aimed.

Does anyone know if collections of his commentaries -- or for that matter
any published works of his -- are available?

Subject: Re: Film "The Last Klezmer" and "Schwein"?

I also attended the screening of "The Last Klezmer" at the Boston Jewish
Film festival last weekend. I also noticed the use of the German word
Schwein by Kleinman/Kozlowski, the subject of the film.  However, I also
heard him use German in several other situations -- e.g., the use of the
German word "antworten" for answer (instead of "entfern"), so I saw it as
a case of this individual having some interference from German in his
Yiddish.

Weinreich doesn't list shvayn anywhere.  Personally, I've only heard the
word khazer used for "pig" as well.  However, Harkavy's dictionary does
give "shvayn" as perfectly good Yiddish word for pig, pork, and swine.

Now, Weinreich's dictionary gives shtekhl-khazer as the Yiddish word for
porcupine.  But Harkavy does not.  Harkavy gives shtekhl-tir instead....
