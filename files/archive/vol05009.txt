1.  A German general surrenders to a Yiddish-speaking G.I.:

The New York Times Magazine of Sunday, May 7, 1995. was a special WW II
issue in connection with the allied victory in Europe (V-E Day) 50 years
ago.  It contained riveting personal battle accounts of participants, and
a most telling collection of war photographs and the victory
celebrations.

The title of one of the war memoirs was "A Lesson in Yiddish" by Gardner
Botsford, a former editor of _The New Yorker_.

Normally this title would mean a lesson that one takes to learn Yiddish,
or a Yiddish lesson that one teaches.

In this particular instance, however, it had a figurative meaning:  A
lesson a  German general received in Yiddish from an American serviceman
named Max (the author gives no other details:  no rank, no last name, no
town where he came from, nor the exact wording of the Yiddish "lesson").

The German army, pressed by the Russians from one direction and by the
Americans from the other direction, was surrendering _en masse_ along the
entire front.

The writer of the article, with Max and another buddy, found themselves
in the city hall of a town in Czechoslovakia where the Burgomaster
(Mayor) advised them that he wishes to surrender the town to the American
Army, and that General Schwaben, the German commandant of the region, is
on his way here for this very same purpose.  Presently the General with
two aides-de-camp came into the hall, clicked his heels, and presented
himself.

"Are you empowered to speak for the American Army?" the Burgomaster
asked.

"We are the American Army," Max said grandly in Yiddish.

Schwaben "looked as though he had just stepped into something disgusting.
We were not only slovenly [from our day- and night long track to get
here], we were Jewish!   He started for the door, but then came back,
undid the flap of his holster, pulled out his Luger and presented it to
Max."   Max stuck the surrendered weapon into his pants belt...

2.  Yiddish in the American army (WW I):

The above story reminded me of another episode, this time about Yiddish
in the American Army during World War I, as described by Maurice Samuel
in his memoirs _Little Did I Know_ (1963, pp.16-17):

"... My regiment, the 307th Infantry, had a large contingent of New York
East-Siders, some of them recent arrivals in this country, with very
little knowledge of English.

My captain asked me whether I would not take over two squads of the
newcomers snd teach them the rudiments of close-order drill in Yiddish.
It was a request rather than a command, and in an evil hour I accepted.

"...My Uncle Berl was profoundly shocked by the use [of Yiddish in the
service of training soldiers].   He was also puzzled:  Where did I get
the military terminology?  He had never heard of such a thing in Yiddish.
Jews had never fought in that language...

"I told him that I gave the commands in English and explained their
execution in Yiddish.  'Ven  ikh  zog "Te-en-SHUN" you must stand up
straight _ot azoy_like this, feet together at an angle _ot azoy_,
shoulders drawn back...'

"... The men didn't take me seriously because of my Yiddish. [Was it on
account of his accent?  His parents came from Rumania. --Z.B.]

"... One of the soldiers said to me:  'You want to say "Attention," say
it, don't shout "Te-en-SHUN" and get red in the face...  You want to say
"Forward March"? Don't yell "Faw-wau-HARCH"  Say it plainly, reasonably,
like a human being...'

"..."Isn't he right?" said Uncle Berl, and went back to his lament:
"Vey, vey, you take a beautiful language like Yiddish, and with it you
want to teach them to kill...  Feh! "

3.  Yiddish between two world wars:

In the period between WW I and WW II Yiddish experienced the zenith in
its development -- a wondrous landscape of schools, newspapers,
magazines, libraries, a scientific research institute, a world-acclaimed
literature, poetry, dramaturgy, and so on and on, a pulsating and vibrant
language in the mouths of millions and millions, a language that
conquered the hearts and minds of Jews all over the world.

Now we reached the depth of despair with regards to Yiddish, and we talk
about its sanctification.

The problem isn't building with union labor, or building with non-union
labor, IMHO.

The problem is building, period!

If NYBC is really devoted to the preservation of Yiddish books and
culture, why patchke around, as mayne eltern used to say, with
constructing monuments and theme parks? Does the fragile Yiddish world
really need to be spending its meager financial resources on (yet
another) building fund? How many synagogues, Jewish centers, etc. have
built themselves into a position where all their time and energy goes
into maintenance of the edifice, rather than nourishment of the
membership ?

Why not honor the memory of our radical ancestors with something really
radical: forget all the donor plaques and architectural ego-trips, and
stick to collecting books ....
