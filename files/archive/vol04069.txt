Subject: Buenos Aires Update

I continue to receive information directly from Argentina, relating to
the explosion that demolished the AMIA building, which housed the
Argentine YIVO.  (I have not, however, had direct contact with YIVO
representatives in Buenos Aires.)

Readers of the NY Times have noted that in today's (7/21/94) issue there
is an article by James Brooke, in which the following statement is made:

"Also spared was the largest library of Jewish rare books in Argentina,
maintained by the Yivo Institute on the fifth floor of the building...
But the mutual aid society's archive of community records, dating to
1894, was destroyed."

Brooke also notes that war crimes documents were NOT located at 633
Pasteur, and hence were also untouched by the explosion. (Speculation
runs rampant, regarding those responsible for the massacre.  It runs the
gamut from Hizbollah cells operating out of Brazil and Paraguay, to
diehards opposed to the Arab-Israeli peace negotations, to Nazis in
Argentina.  Crews of Israeli rescuers are on site, along with
investigators from intelligence agencies.)

Not having visited 633 Pasteur, I do not know exactly where the 100,000
volumes of the YIVO library were shelved.  The YIVO offices, classrooms,
reading rooms and gallery were on the 3rd floor -- the equivalent, in
North American terms, to our 4th floor -- and it is possible that stack
areas were indeed located one flight up.  The Buenos Aires YIVO
maintained both a non-circulating research collection and a lending
library (a 1968 description reports that there were 50,000 volumes in the
former section, and 20,000 in the latter).  It was -- and one hopes still
is -- the largest collection of printed Judaica in Latin America.  Not
all, or even a majority of this library was (is?) in Yiddish.  Still, it
was (is?) certainly one of the world's great repositories in that
language.  Time will tell, exactly what has survived of that major
library.

In Friday's English and Yiddish "Forward," there are articles on the
bombing, as well as quotes from the nonagenarian former director of the
Buenos Aires YIVO, Shmuel Rozhanski (Samuel Rollansky).  In the English
"Forward," he is quoted as saying, "Tsu vos hob ikh gedarft dos
iberlebn?"  (Do I need to survive all this?)  In the "Forverts," he
plaintively comments, "Nishto keyn verter farn groysn farlust.  Kh'hob
'zoykhe' geven baytsuzayn mayn eygene levaye." (No words can describe
this great loss.  I have 'privileged' to witness my own funderal.)

Several lists of wounded, dead and missing persons have come my way. As
if it made the slightest bit of difference, I have heard insensitive
comments to the effect that "at least" most of the names on the lists of
wounded and dead were not Jewish.  Well, by way of "compensation," most
of those identified as missing ARE Jewish. There were 76 names of missing
persons in a list released yesterday by the DAIA.  Many, perhaps most of
those still unaccounted for are likely buried under the rubble of 633
Pasteur.

For those who are interested, a "Disaster Relief Fund for Argentina" has
been established by B'nai B'rith International.  Contributions may be
sent to the attention of Mr. Kent E. Schiner, International President,
B'nai B'rith International Headquarters, 1640 Rhode Island Ave., N.W.,
Washington, DC 20036.  Please note on checks that contributions are to be
earmarked for that Fund.

Once a clearer picture emerges, I have no doubt that there will be a
coordinated effort to reconstitute (to the extent possible) the library
of the Buenos Aires YIVO.  The Archives are gone forever, and the human
cost of course dwarfs the damage to the books and files that have been
destroyed.

Subject: Skverer Chassidim

To Peyrets Mett:

I stand corrected.  I didn't realize that the Skverer were a distinct
sect of Chassidim, but of course that makes sense.  Of course, the
Yiddish tapes they produce are widely sold in the seforim stores in Boro
Park, and so are accessible to the gamut of Chassidim and other
"black-hat" Yiddish speakers.

Are you allowed to divulge to the world at large what YIVO's new address
is/ will be?  When will the actual move take place?  Zol zayn mit mazl!

From:RWERMAN@vms.huji.ac.il
Subject: French, Yiddish and Rashi

Harold L. Orbach writes about the institutionalization of French in the
Sixteenth Century with late confirmation lasting into the Nineteenth
Century.  I am reminded that some Mendele readers may not know that
medieval French is a poorly documented language; little written material
remains in that language.  Latin was used by most clergy who represented
a majority of the alphabetic population in the middle ages.  What
material remains is frequently balladic, often based on translations from
the Latin, as the poem, the _Aenaus_.

The _le'azim_ [glosses, lamed - eyin - zayin; an abbreviation of lashon
am zar[a] or language of the goyim] used by Rashi [more than 700!] in his
commentary on the Tanach and even more in his commentary on the Talmud
and to a lesser extent in Rashbam, his grandson's commentary on the
Tanach, are a major source of medieval French, not infrequently appearing
two to four centuries before other manuscript evidence of the words in
question.

This custom of using local languages to explain difficult language in
Hebrew and Aramaic is not confined to that time or to French.  I am
currently amusing myself with Venetian comments in a sixteenth century
Hebrew manuscript.

I highly recommend:

*Foreign Words in the Bible Commentary of Rashi*, 360 pp. by the late
Joseph Greenberg, privately published and available from the widow at 41
Ussishkin Street, Jerusalem I-92463, Israel.

Closer to Yiddish, perhaps, Rashi, as Greenberg pointed out, used several
dozen non-French le'azim, including Middle High German le'azim [e.g.,
brimmen, bruederschaft, durchbrechen, entwerfen, funke, gebrueder,
greber, houf, merkatzen, negel, puken, schafreite, segel, sigel, spangen,
steinboc, stoeszel, vlos, wendelstein].  And Judaio-Provencal?  That too:
alhendra, budecas.  And a handful of other languages too, including
Ladino and Arabic.
