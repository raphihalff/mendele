Subject: "Afn Fidl" publishing date

Could someone tell me the publishing date of Sholem Aleichem's serial
novella "Afn Fidl"? And while we're on the subject: aside from his
"Stempenyu" and "M'hulyet" and the Odessa stories of Isaac Babel, what
other literary depictions of klezmorim are Mendelyaner aware of?

Subject: Tsholnt

[see 2.261]

Cholent is called hamim (hot [foods]) in Hebrew, designating a dish
that is slow-cooked and kept hot from before the arrival of
Shabbat/Shabes until the Saturday mid-day meal after kiddush. The
etymology of cholent may derive from the French words for hot (chaud)
or to heat (chaloir). It's pronounced like the YIVO transcription
tsholnt, but the spelling cholent would recall the French or Romance
origin of the term. Perhaps this word is one of the proofs to be cited
for the origins of Ashkenazic Jewry in western Europe.

Subject: Pareve

[see 6.261]

I understood that pareve came from Old Czech or Old Polish, and
ultimately from the latin parus - meaning equal, neither more to one
side than to another (latin par- and slavic ov-/ev- suffix). Thus,
pareve means neither here nor there; just as much milekhdik as
fleyshik.

Subject: Keseyder immer

Generally when there are synonyms in a language their meanings are not
quite identical. In Yidish we have the synonyms keseyder (from the
hebrew) and immer (from the german). Perhaps some can argue that immer
is a daytchmerism, but be that as it may, it is used widely in Yidish,
and I detect a subtle difference in meaning. I write to inquire
whether others detect the same shift that I sense.

Er iz keseyder do.:  He is "always" here in the sense of coming and
going very frequently.

Er iz immer do.:  The sense "always" now seems to be that the presence
is continuous rather than intermitant albeit very frequent.

It seems to me that the multiple roots to the yidish language is what
gives it its tam.....also the modalities contained in the voiced
inflections which the written language cannot capture. Witness the
current discusion of the meanings of "folg mir (mikh) a gang".  For
example the recent case of the little boy who survives from "folg mikh
a gang", in that context I would interpret it to mean "who the hell
knows" or "I should know?" (with a strongly rising inflection.)
