Subject: Introduction

Sholem Aleichem! I'm Sarah (or Soreh) Benor from Columbia University
(originally Washington, DC). Since my internship this summer at the
National Yiddish Book Center, I've gotten _very_ interested in Yiddish
and Yiddish culture. I just started a Klezmer band (I play violin), and
I'm planning a Columbia Yiddishkeit festival for December. I'm looking
forward to meeting other Yiddish-lovers over Mendele and learning more
about the state of Yiddishkeit!

Subject: Respect for Yiddish, continued

An example of how Yiddish is often treated shabbily by Jews may be found
in the recent tararum in Mendele (edition 4.118 et seq.) regarding a
Yiddish proverb cited by an MIT professor in a book on language
acquisition.  Several of our more knowledgeable Mendelniks have tried to
tease out of the proverb ("Az der bubbe vot gehat baytzim vot zie geven
mein zayde") clues to the author's Yiddish dialect.  My guess is that the
author, however neutral his intentions, presented a poorly-remembered or
simply ungrammatical Yiddish sentence, and did not deem Yiddish enough of
a "real" language to dignify with a verification of correctness.

I contend that, if the author had had a French speaking nanny, and he
wished to repeat one of her expressions, he would not have presented it
as "parlay voo fransay."  Indeed, if that nanny had spoken a language
with a non-Roman alphabet, like Chinese, with several dialects and
several "accepted" Romanizations, I would have expected a linguistics
professor to take the trouble to consult an expert to help him transcribe
the sentence properly.

Many people assume that the Yiddish they heard from parents and
grandparents was, by definition, acceptable and grammatically "correct."
As with any other language, native speakers of Yiddish do not
automatically speak grammatically correct sentences all the time.  Usages
that seem adequate in conversations among uneducated speakers of English
would be considered sloppy and substandard in the college classroom, or
among educated speakers; Yiddish is no different.  Although it may be
traumatic for some to acknowledge that their parents spoke substandard
Yiddish, it should not be surprising.

Yiddish has several dialects and a "standard language" imposed relatively
recently, and a substantial body of literature.  The same can be said of
Norwegian, Italian, Chinese and Arabic.  Some people, who would not think
to question the legitimacy of the latter languages, unthinkingly dismiss
Yiddish as a jargon or subset of German where "anything goes."  I can
ignore such comments if they are from the historical period of the
Kulturkampf between Yiddish and Hebrew, or when they come from sources
traditionally hostile to Jews.  It saddens me when I hear them echoed by
fellow Jews today.

Subject: Ravel's Chants Hebraiques

Daniella HarPaz [4:126] asks about Ravel's Chants Hebraiques.  I have a
copy of the reissued original recording (with Ravel at the piano) by
Madeleine Grey.  It is part of the Angel "Chants d'Auvergne" [Great
Recordings (1965/6)] the English version of a French repressing of the
1932 original.  Angel COLC-152: "Madeleine Grey -- Songs of Auvergne."
Grey's voice is quite exceptional and the style majestic.

The accompanying booklet -- Ah! days of large LP's with boxes, jackets...
-- gives the English and a transliteration in Daytsh/Yiddish:

        Mejer'ke

  Mejer'ke main Suhn,                     Mayerke, my son,
  Zi weiss du, var wenem du stehst?       do you know before whom you are
                                            standing?
  --Lifne Melech Malchei hambochim,       --Before the King of Kings my
     Tatunju,                                     father,


  Mejer'ke main Suhn,                     Mayerke, my son,
  Wos ze westu bai Ihm bet'n?             what are you asking of him?
  --Bonej, chajei M'sunei, Tatunju.       --Children, life and food, my
                                              father

[As sung, the first line is repeated twice (i.e., total of three times)
with an "Ay" (Oy?) before `Mejer'ke' the third time.  The second line is
repeated once and the Hebrew response (third line) repeated once also.
For the second stanza, the first two lines are repeated as in the first
but the final line is repeated twice.]


     L'Enigme eternelle                  (The Eternal Problem)

 Fraegt die Velt die alte Casche         The world asks the old question
 Tra la la la la la la                   Tra la  ...
 Entfert men Tra la la la la             One replies Tra la la la
 Un as men will kennen sagen             and if one cannot reply
 Tra la la la la la la                   Tra la ...
 Fraegt die Velt die alte Casche         the world asks the old question
 Tra la la la la la la                   Tra la ...

[As sung, "L'Enigme eternelle" has the second line repeated once, and
the `Tra la la la la' of the third line repeated once.  The final line
is repeated twice.  (my 'ae' for 'a' with umlaut in the text)]

Ravel's musical arrangment as he plays the piano is made for this form. I
don't find anything like the line in "Mejer'ke" mentioned.  Perhaps there
was a text change in another version?  Madeleine Grey was the favorite
singer of Ravel and all three of the Chants Hebraiques were originally
given by her and she alone had performance rights for many years, so I
take it the text of the original is definitive for Ravel's musical
setting.  The booklet with my record also adds the information that
"Mejer'ke" is taken from a Hebrew recitative whilst "L'enigma eternelle"
was a Yiddish poem which he added to his musical setting for the Kaddish,
the first and longest of the three "Chants Hebraiques." It also notes
that "Mejer'ke" was one of four contributions by Ravel to a 1910 contest
by the Moscow Maison du Lied that asked for "settings of songs taken from
the folklores of different countries."

Despite the daytsh/yiddish transliteration in the record booklet, the
Chants are definitely sung in Yiddish, but what dialect vays ich nit.
The Hebrew part is in Hebrew, but as I do not know Hebrew I would
guess the attempt is to use the Sephardic pronunication.  Others with
musical backgrounds may have more knowledge about these three unique
compositions of Ravel, and why and how he became interested in Jewish
themes.  The other music of his on the record are his Madagascan songs,
the Chansons Madecasses.  A quick perusal of a 1992 CD catalog finds
no listing for the Chansons Hebraiques or Madecasses, but there is an
Angel CD of Songs of Auvergne -- no information on performer; perhaps
this is the Madeleine Grey version with the Chansons Hebraiques?
