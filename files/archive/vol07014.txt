Subject: The Forward and YIVO transliteration

Es kumt undz a mazl tov. Oy vi sheyn es iz geven tzu zen the May 23 issue of
the Forward Classifieds suddenly boast the new YIVO spelling for _mentsh_. 

On May 11, I Emailed a letter to the Forward describing Mendele and its
subscribers. Who could not revere such a group! And then quoted some of
Leonard Prager's data about the word _mentsh_ . I requested that they respect
the YIVO transliteration and change the spelling.. A small request, so easy
to honor. Un azoy iz take gevorn.

Much energy has been expended on Mendele (add in the calories I too have
burned) to bemoan the lack of caring on the part of the young new
English-oriented Fast Forward editors. How can we motivate them to revere the
Yiddish and Yiddishkayt of the Forverts, we have asked ourselves. And
continued to bemoan our fate amongst ourselves.

Efsher zoln mir in der tzukunft ale shraybn undzere forshlagn, undzer Email
to the Forward anshtot shraybn eyner dem tzvaytn oder Mendelen.

Dear Mr. Andrey Bredstein,
Thank you for your very detailed answer  to my question about the 
etymology of the word  'Shemeritsi" (not 'Sheremitsi'), found in 
Sholem Aleikhem's "Motl, Peysi dem Khazn, chapter X, "a gas nist".

You indicate that my question gives rise to another one, concerning 
the nature of the "proshek" used by Motl's brother Eli.
It seems that it will remain a secret how one powder could be two 
powders and how 'shemeritsi' could be red and yellow.

Subject: Biographies of some authors

I had posted a previous message looking for biographical information (for 
a friend) about the following authors: Reyzl Zhinkhlinski, Sholem Shtern, 
Pesye Pomerants-Honigboym (Hershfeld-Pomerants), Yuri Sul, Meyer Frumkin 
and Avrom Bik.

Thanks to some helpful Mendelyaners, to the online catalog of the Library 
of Congress and to the Social Security death index, I have found that 
Pesye Pomerants-Honigboym (sometimes spelled Pessie Pomerantz-Honigbaum) 
was born in 1900 and passed away on August 8, 1978 in Chicago, that Yuri Sul 
(spelled Yuri Suhl) was born in 1908 and passed away in 1986 (the Social
Security registers include an Irving Suhl with the same years of birth 
and death, but I don't know if it's the same person), and that there was 
a Meyer Frumkin in the Social Security registers who was born in 1880 and 
died in 1963. I also have found that Sholem Shtern was born around 1901. 
I haven't found anything about Avrom Bik and Reyzl Zhinkhlinski.

Subject: Whence Mendele's Pen Name 

I read with my normal admiration of anything that Zelig Bach posts, his 
comments about the selection of Mendele Moykher Sforim's pseudonym.  His 
comments were, of course, as a consequence of Marjorie Schonhaut 
Hirshan's post, "Mendele's Pseudonym."

Marjorie's post suggests that the name change was commonplace among Jews 
of that era and was a dodge derived to avoid conscription for 25 years in 
the Russian military.

The suggestion that this phenomenon existed and was commonplace is one of 
the central elements of a long standing discussion on "JEWISHGEN," a list 
that deals with questions of Jewish genealogic interest. 

I do not suggest for one moment that I have found the key to this problem, 
but frankly I have had and continue to have great difficulty with the 
essence of that suggestion; i.e., that by the simple expedient of a name 
change, one was able to avoid conscription.  Research that I did on the 
matter confirm my belief that the entire Russian conscription process was a 
great deal more refined and precise than is believed to be the case. In fact, 
central to these stories about a name change is the general understanding that 
Russian conscription authorities were so stupid that all one had to do was 
change one's name, and bang, you were out of the army.

I did a long piece on the subject of the accuracy of some of the bobe meises 
that were being put forward on this subject, and it is still an active file.  
I must get 10 notes a year on the matter, most of them saying that my 
suggestions cannot be correct because that person's grandfather did indeed
undergo a name change to avoid conscription.

I enclose below the entire file for whatever purpose it serves to illuminate 
this discussion of Mendele's pseudonym.  

[Moderator's note: The file "Military conscription in 19th century Russia" is 
available at JewishGen web site (http://www.jewishgen.org/infofiles/ru-mil.txt)
or by sending blank e-mail to RU-mil@mail.jewishgen.org].

Subject: Yiddish Capable Web Browser

I am pleased to announce that there is now a Yiddish capable Web browser.
It's by Alis Technologies, of Montreal, Canada.  Their browser can handle
web pages in Yiddish using standard (YIVO) orthography, encoded in the
internationally recognized Unicode (ISO 10646) standard character set.

The current version of their browser, 3.0, is available for free trial
download off of their web site (http://www.alis.com/).  It is supported for
Microsoft Windows 95. The company plans to release a new version, 3.1,
which will work on Windows 3.1, Windows '95, and Window NT 4.0.

This is the first commercially released browser that handles the Hebrew
characters of Unicode sufficiently to render Yiddish text.

In addition, the program's keyboard system supports the minimal set of
keyboard keys needed to input Yiddish text.  This is used in the mail
program included with this program.  The mail program, by the way, can be
used to send Yiddish text via e-mail.  It is also important to note that
the program can handle Hebrew (full nikud), Arabic, Korean, Chinese,
Japanese, Russian, and many other languages.  There are many other
capabilities beyond the scope of this brief announcement.

The technologies included, and necessary to achieve the Yiddish capability, are:

  - implementation of the Unicode Bidirection Algorithm
  - Unicode and ISO 10646 Hebrew characters sufficient to support
    Yiddish according to its most widely accepted orthography
  - The UTF-8 encoding of Unicode
  - A Font for Hebrew with the capability to render
    all 22 Hebrew letters, 5 final forms, 11 character
    combinations (see http://world.std.com/~yv/uyip/combinations.html),
    and 3 digraph characters (see http://world.std.com/~yv/uyip/digraphs.html)
  - HTML in Unicode/ISO 10646
  - Language tagging in HTML
  - Bidirectional HTML
  - Character set specification in HTML
  - Does not rely on OS support to handle bidirectional
    text formatting and rendering

There is no other browser for any platform that has all of these capabilities. 
Upon request, I will comment further as to the specifics of other browsers 
which prevent them from being considered capable of supporting Yiddish-
language web pages.  Some of the issues have already been discussed on the 
UYIP mailing list.

Congratulations to Alis Technologies for being the first browser to support
Yiddish-language web pages!
