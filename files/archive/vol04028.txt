Subject: Introduction

I am the Eams Chair in Yiddish Culture for the Bendin Program abroad.
Formerly a passive reader, I can finally come out of the cyber-closet. I
have ties (chains) to the Yiddish program at Ohio State University in
Columbus, OH.  I have authored many works on Natural Gas Pipeline testing
and Telephone Network Automation, and hope to follow with some writings
exploring my Bendin roots (Vortslen).

Subject: Introduction

I have been a Mendelnick for about a month and I thought that it was
about time to introduce myself. I'm a retired engineer from General
Electric Co. and I speak, write, and understand Yiddish to some degree.
In the last two years I've been using the language quite a bit with some
Russian immigrants who are in my age group. The Yiddish is not perfect
but we manage to make ourselves understood. The greatest difficulty I
have is when I take one of them to the doctor and act as an interperter.
A large number of the medical terms are beyond me and we have to revert
to pointing to words in an English-Russian dictionary.

I want to thank Shleyme Axelord for quoting the source for the
translation of [cargo] hold on ship or plane. I have a sort of tattered
Yiddish-English dictionary with a missing title page. When I looked up
the reference, I realized that I have a copy of Harkavy's English-Yiddish
Verterbukh. Ich dank dir nach amohl.

Subject: Yiddish handwriting

I have also been faced with the problem of deciphering handwritten
Yiddish. One easily accessible source is Uriel Weinreich's superb
textbook "College Yiddish". Owing to the idiosyncratic nature of
handwriting, it is probably useful for the novice to compare samples from
different sources. In my case, I consulted the alphabet table in
Weinreich as well as a similar table drawn up by my late father, a native
speaker of Yiddish. The differences in the two tables were not
insignificant and samples of Yiddish handwriting would on occasion
correspond more to one or to the other.

Subject: Translation

Larry Rosenwald in MENDELE 4.026-2 asked for suggestions on reading
Yiddish script. Zuckerman and Herbst in their beginners text, Learning
Yiddish in Easy Stages, have a half dozen examples of Yiddish penmanship
styles, in addition to showing how to write the letters.

It might be apropos here to give a few suggestions and caveats for those
doing translations for others and for those hiring translators.

Translation is an art. Therefore not everyone is a good translator even
though one is knowledgeable. You should:

        Have several dictionaries and a magnifying glass.

        Never work with originals.

        Enlarge and alter shade if needed.

        Determine means of payment--beforehand.

        Ask/give beginners, or first time users, a quote on a sample page
        or two.

        Know that the range for those working by the hour is $10-$40/hr.

        Know that _Der Bay_ has a list of/for subscribers who are
        translators (NO CHARGE to be listed or for recommendations).

        Expect that the tasks are often long letters or manuscripts from
        a great grandfather.

        Determine the form of the finished copy. It may be typed, on
        disk, on cassette or even handwritten.

The last mentioned item is the cause of more problems than any other.
