Subject: sneezing

Regarding superstitions & sneezing I had always heard the response "tsum emes
genosn!" ('sneezed to the truth') upon hearing a sneeze, meaning that the last
thing anyone said before the sneeze was confirmed as being true by the sneeze.
Doesn't Molly Picon have a line somewhere in the film "Yidl mitn Fidl" where
she says, "Someone should only sneeze now!" in wishing that something someone
had just said were true?

Subject: Tumbalalaika

We used to sing 'A shtayn......'  until it was pointed out that the phrase was 
properly 'farshtayn ken vaksn on regn' (understanding can grow without rain).
It's a very appealing explanation.  Has anyone else heard this version?

Re a shteyn vos ken vaksn on reygn -- Maybe we're being too nature-oriented
for Yiddish? Maybe we should think more about kidneys and gall bladders? Just
kidding -- but it's the only stones I could ever think of that that line makes
sense for -- and I think of it whenever I hear the song, which has severely
lessened the romantic character of that song for me. ;)

Re Harvey Spiro's sneeze recollections, wow! If the truth be told, what I
remember did NOT really sound like 'Nis deroyf' but more like /nisederof/. The
second vowel is an unstressed shwa. Since my parents said /of/ for /oyf/, I
may well have hypercorrected that back to an /oyf/ that it never was. But I'm 
pretty sure the first vowel was /i/... And they didn't speak Russian.
(Mother's family from Poland, father from Slovakia.) I'd be interested in
hearing more about what this could be.

Also, I must admit I'm having second thoughts about whether that was the
3rd-sneeze response or the response to a sneeze during someone's assertion,
proving that the assertion was true, which would make some variant of 'Nis
deroyf' more appropriate. But what was that vowel doing there after the 'nis'
and before the 'deroyf'? Hm...

As for Harvey's 'Galitzianer roots', hey, I was 'accommodating' the
Yivo-ites/Litvakes out there -- Be assured that in my house it was 'Tsim
gezint' and 'Lang leybn'! And yes, thanks for reminding me, 'Tsi lange
yu:rn'. (But that phrase I associate more with speaking of the dead and the
living in one clause, with 'Im/Ir/Dir tsi lange yu:rn' inserted.)

Which reminds me -- when you got new clothes, the English line was 'Wear it
and tear it well' -- I forget the Yiddish line. I note that my Misty Harbor
raincoat says on the label 'Wear it in good health'. Hm...

And, yes, we too did not go back to get something after leaving the house.
(Or, if we had to, we'd be very nervous. ;) )

Question: Discovering you or someone else was wearing something inside-out
'meant' something -- can't remember what. Does this ring a bell? ('You're
going to get a surprise' keeps popping into my mind -- but I may be confusing
this with something else.)

Subject: Etymology of dav(e)nen

A. Manaster Ramer has stated:
"The crucial point here is that only the d-b-b etymology acounts for teh actual
form of the word in Yiddish." I'd appreciate seeing exactly how this works.

Subject: Tashme and Hebrew words from Yiddish

Does someone know the origin of the word tashme for tape or cassette?

Hugh Denman comment about hebrew words that have its origin in Yiddish.  
"Dash Ham" is one of these expressions, it comes from "a vareme gris."

Subject: Yiddish Texts

The ENCYLOPAEDIA JUDAICA on CD-Rom has three Yiddish songs sung by Jan Peerce:
Rozhinkes mit Mandlen, If I were a rich man, Rabbi Elimelech. Unfortunately
the text is not given in print. I would like to have the text in order to
understand the songs.

Thanks for help.

Subject: Finger in fist - a fayg

I read a translation of a short story, many years ago, called "Makh a Fayg" -
unfortunately, I don't remember the collection or the author.

I think it has a NY immigrant setting, and concerns a mother and child walking
in the street, confronted by an old woman who always casts curses at the
child. The mother instructs the child to "makh a fayg" to ward off the curses.

If anyone can identify the collection and/or the author, I would be greatly
appreciative.
