Subject: Yiddish Music Festival in New York City

On Wednesday July 12, 1995, there will be another annual FREE musical
concert at Damrosch Park beginning at 7pm. I am given to understand that
it will be a really special show (I think they always are, I must say)
because many of the leading Yiddish personalities of the stage will be
performing.

I am also told that the whole program will be taped for subsequent
viewing by the Public Broadcasting Service. For those who are not
familiar with Damrosch Park it is part of the Lincoln Center complex at
Broadway and 64th Street. Since the park cannot be seen from Broadway,
let me explain that it is located behind and to the left of the
Metropolitan Opera House, towards the State Theater.

The same program will be performed at the following locations:

Wednesday, August 9th at 6:30pm at the McDonald Park, Forest Hills;

Tuesday, August 22 again at 6:30pm at Cunningham Park, Flushing, Queens;

Sunday, August 20 at 6:00pm at Kensico Dam Plaza, Valhalla;

Sunday, August 27th at 7:00pm in Seaside Park, Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.

So there's absolutely no excuse for anyone to miss out on this wonderful
opportunity, no matter where you are located on the network!

Enjoy,

Henry Mullish

Subject: Ghengis Cohn

I haven't read the novel nor seen the TV show of _The Dance of Ghengis
Cohn_, but I appreciate Zellig Bach's insightful review (5.019).  The
content described seems to imply that being turned into a Jew is a
punishment, that craving Jewish delicacies is a punishment, that using
Yiddish words in public is a shameful punishment.  One of the tragic
ironies is that the author, Romain Gary, was himself punished for being
Jewish by other murderers, compatriots of the German police commandant.
The author's attempt at symmetry seems, however, to distort the whole set
of glorious possibilities thot open up in becoming and being Jewish.

The occasional use of Yiddish for fun in TV (so-called) comedies often
reaches for the same kind of distortion as does _Ghengis Cohn_.  Using
Yiddish for comic effect is fine, but not when the comic effect depends
(as it often does) on ridicule and destruction of dignity.

Incidentally, I think of myself as _becoming_ Jewish.  I think of
Jewishness and Yiddishkeyt as _processes_ not simply states of being.  I
was born Jewish, am Jewish, but I strive by study (including Yiddish) and
work and thought to _become_ Jewish: not more not less, but still to
become.  By that I mean: Jewishness, Yiddishkeyt are dynamic, living
processes, not static conditions of being.  Belief, faith are elements,
but don't constitute the whole ball of wax.  That would be easy, but as
they say, shver tsu zayn a yid.

It could be said (with my limited knowledge of the novel) that Romain
Gary might have sensed that the real punishment for the German police
commandant was that he was turned into a Jew without experiencing the
living process. And so the painful deadness of his soul was sharply
underscored.

Subject: An incorrect biblical citation?  Kholile.

Thanks to Michael Shimshoni's sleuthing in finding a reference to the
word "kholile" in the Tanakh.

>> kholile ... can be found already in the Torah in
>> Bereshit (Genesis) 18,14 with essentially  the
>> same  meaning it is used these days in Yiddish
>> and Hebrew.

Following up on his citation, I noticed a typo. The actual verse in which
the word appears (twice!) is verse 25, not 14.  It's the beginning of the
story of Avrohom's negotiation with G-d over the fate of S'dom.  The
recent JPS translation interprets it with the meaning: "far be it from
you."

Subject: Eiss

I would very much appreciate learning of any information on a writer
named Chaim Yisroel Eiss.  He lived in Geneva during the first half of
this century and was instrumental in rescuing Jews during the chorbon. He
is referenced in "Chassidic Tales of the Holocaust."

Thanks.

Subject: Gilbert and Sullivan in Yiddish

I'd like to share a post that was sent to me by Sami Klein:

---------- Forwarded message -------------------------------------
The June BBC Magazine had a short piece on Gilbert and Sullivan in
Yiddish.

A Yiddish version of the The Pirates of Penzance, having played to
enthusiastic audiences in the USA for the past 8 yrs, is soon to be
eleased on CD by Blue Hill Recordins. The recording with the Klezmer
Conservatory Band of Boston may come as a suprise to G and S
tradionalists.. "Der Groyser General" -a major general who prays in
synagogue, studies the Torah, eats chicken soup with matzo balls and
cooks carrot stew for Purim - is just one of the newly styled characters
in Di Yam Gazlonim.

It was translated into Yiddish by Al Grand, a retired teacher from No.
Bellmore, NY, who also translated HMS Pinafore. "I am the very model of a
modern major general" becomes "Ikh bin der Groyser General un ikh bin
oykh a guter Yid (literally, 'I am the Major General and I'm also a good
Jew'). Mr. Grand says he has to change contexts and meanings slightly.
(HMS Pinafore is anchored in Tel Aviv harbor, for instance) for the
translations to work.
