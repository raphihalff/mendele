Subject: Introduction

I've decided it's time to stop lurking and introduce myself.  I grew up
in a very Jewish neighborhood in Jersey City, with Yiddish-speaking
grandparents on my father's side of the family and English-German
speaking grandparents on my mother's side.  When I tried to speak Yiddish
to my father's mother she would wince at the germanness of it.  But I
still love Yiddish, since it carries with it so many memories for me.  My
other languages are Spanish and Esperanto.   Mendele has been a real
treat, and an educational one, for me.

There is something that I have wondered about, and perhaps one of the
non-Jewish German-speaking Mendelniks can answer this.  My wife has many
non-Jewish relatives on her father's side of the family in Germany.  When
they have visited here, I have played Yiddish music for them, and
otherwise exposed them to the Yiddish language, hoping to initiate some
conversation on the subject of the German/Yiddish connection, a subject
of great interest to me.  Yet there never is any reaction from them, as
though this strange tongue, which must seem tantalizingly familiar and
yet unfamiliar to them, was something they are seemingly deaf to.  I
can't understand this lack of curiousity in their part.  Is it some kind
of misguided politeness, or just a lack of curiousity, or what?

Anyhow, to the shames and all my fellow-Mendelniks, greetings and
salutations from Fair Lawn, N.J.

Subject: Learning Yiddish

Rick Gildemeister's recent posting spurs me to toss a question into the
collective lap of the _Mendele_ readership.

Mr. Gildemeister, you mentioned that you were neither a born Jew nor a
_ger_; though I cannot judge the purity of your Yiddish, at least it
seems, well, Yiddish.  I am also a gentile greatly interested in the
Yiddish language.  I know German and a bit of Russian, so I can usually
understand written (trans- literated) Yiddish; I'd like, however, to
improve on that (I am a New Yorker by birth, so Yiddish IS in a way at
least a part of my mother tongue).

My question is, then, how did you learn Yiddish?  Make that two
questions: can you (or any other readers) recommend a book for learning
the language? I'd especially like something that will teach me the Hebrew
alphabet as used for Yiddish, but failing that, a "guide to Yiddish in
transliteration" will do.  Thanks to all.

Subject: Eynikl, Wlochy, spuzhet, karahulke

	1) In his etymological dictionary of Russian Max Vasmer connects
Russian _vnuk_, Ukrainian _onuk_ etc. only distantly with German _Enkel_,
which derives from Old High German _enencheli_ 'grandson' (or
'grandchild'?).  The latter is explained as a diminutive of OHG _ano_
'ancestor', _ana_ 'grandmother', which are in turn related to Latin
_anus_ 'old woman' and Lithuanian _anyta_ 'mother-in-law'.  Vasmer
suggests that the Slavic term for grandson or grandchild may be connected
with "this old word from children's language."

	2) Yale Reisner has it almost right:  Polish _Wl/ochy_ is the
name of the country (Italy); an Italian is _Wl/och_ (pl. _Wl/osi_).  The
term apparently goes back to an old Germanic word for stranger or
foreigner (applied to Romans and Celts); it shows up as well in
geographic and ethnographic terms like Wales and Walloons.  (I'll leave
it to Henry Sapoznik or Michael Alpert to comment on _volekhl_.)

	3) Avreymel Cassel asked about _tsespuzhet_ and _karahulke_. The
former, applied to horses frightened by lightning, is presumably from
Russian/Ukrainian dialectal _spuzhat'_ 'frighten'.  The latter, used in
the context "khaverim ... shoin avekgefirt in karahulke," is most likely
Russian _karaulka_ 'guardroom' from _karaul_ 'guard, sentry' (of Turkic
origin).

Subject: Transliteration

To Irene Glasser:

There are a number of transliterated Yiddish works ranging fron "good" to
"feh!" Here are a couple I picked out for you:

1. Royte Pomerantsen: I. Olsvanger; Shocken Books; New York
2. Gut Yontif, Gut Yor: M.B. Jaffe; The Citadel Press, New York
3. Onions and Cucumbers and Plums: Sarah Z. Betsky, Ed.; Wayne State
                University Press, Detroit

Enjoy

[The shames notes that since Arn Abramson is in Thailand at the moment
there may be talk about "transliteration", but warns that when Arn
returns vet zikh tun khoyshekh. ;-^]

Subject: Yiddish handwriting

Larry Rosenwald asks for help with Yiddish handwriting.  If memory
serves, Dovid Katz's "Grammar of the Yiddish language", publ. by
Duckworth, London 1987, contains examples of all letters of the Yiddish
alphabet in their handwritten form (including final forms, where
applicable), and even instructions on how to write them (i.e., the
direction and order of strokes).

Subject: Passive-voice translation help

Thanks to those who responded to my earlier request for help. If a
beginner may impose again, I'm finding myself confused about the use of
the impersonal or passive-voice pronoun. Specifically I'm trying to
translate the following, also from mayn zeyde's zikhroines:

"Nokhdem, vi men hot zikh shoyn oysgelernt abisel shvimen in tifenish
ibern kop, iz the grester ambitzie aribertzushvimen dem gantzen taykh biz
oyf yener zayt vaser. Un az men filt zikh shoyn bikhoyles tzu vagen aza
unternemung, lozt men zikh avek mit der beglaytung fun tzvey gute shvimer
fun beaytebertzushvimen dem taykh. Un az men dergraykht dem anderen breg,
meynt men, az men hot gemakht a rayze arum der velt, oder men iz
ongekumen in di vaytere midboyres.

"Oyfn breg tzit men zikh oys oyfn zamd tzu genisen di zigraykh ferdinte
hanoe fun oysruen zikh, kedey zikh ontzushepen mit genug koyekhes tzu
shvimen tzurik..."

I have the general drift of what's happening; where I bog down is in
figuring who the subject is when you have multiple actors: When does
"men" refer to the "shvimer" vs those observing/accompanying him? Is
there a grammatical rule here that I'm missing? Weinreich isn't much
help, I'm afraid ...

Subject: Sabbetai Zevi

In reply to Hugh Kottler's inquiry about Yiddish literature regarding
Sabbetai Zevi (or however one latinizes the name), I'm sending the
following bibligraphical reference: M. Vaynrakh [Weinreich], [A Yid-
dish poem about Sabbetai Zevi from 1666.] _Tsaytshrift_ 1 (1926),
159-172.

Regarding Ashkenazic false Messiahs, there is the case of Jacob Frank
concerning which see Gershom Scholem's _Kabbalah_ (NY : New American
Library, 1974), pp. 287-309 [bibliography on 308-309]. [This article
on Frank is reprinted from the _Encyclopedia Judaica_, I believe.]
Interestingly, apropos of the question of the ethnicity of the (false)
Messiah, it appears that Jacob Frank was taken for a Sephardic Jew (a
perception that he himself encouraged--Scholem says he "spoke Ladino
when he appeared in public" [288]).

Subject: Sabbetai Zevi

I can rarely find what I need, but I'm pretty sure there's a play by Zvi
Cahn (he wrote regularly for the Forverts) "Shabsai Tsvi"; and I'm
positive about a play by Aaron Zeitlin, "Jacob Frank".
