Subject: transcripts of Dzigan & Schumacher

Would anyone have transcripts of Dzigan & Schumacher routines from pre-war
years? Are there recordings? I'm familiar with the classic routines that
they developed in Israel - Aynshtayn Vaynshtayn in particular. I'd love to
hear or read the routines that made them so famous in Poland before the
Holocaust.

Subject: shtetl profession

In the 1929 business directory, I have come across the phrase "voiture du
place" as a profession(?) for certain individuals in the shtetl. Has anyone
ever come across this phrase?

Subject: "Shimmel Lechel"

Does anyone know how the street game "Shimmel Lechel" was played?  "Lechel"
is a hole, and "shimmel", I suppose, means moldy.  So, Moldy Hole?? 

We played this game in the streets of Brighton Beach in the mid thirties to
low forties.

Subject: Ovsei Driz

Tayere Mendelyaner,

I was reading about the Russian writer for children and adults Genrikh
Sapgir (at http://www.vladivostok.com/Speaking_In_Tongues), and saw that he
translated children's writer Ovsei (Shike) Driz from the Yiddish.  I
remember many Ovsei Driz rhymes from childhood - I used to read them in
Russian. Can someone please post some Driz in the original Yiddish?

Subject: About horses and radishes

My great grandmother used to use the expression "oy dus iz mir a reytenekh".  
 From this one can deduct that finding out what reytekh is is very difficult
- an age-old question indeed.  Concerning horse-radish, my great grandfather
used to say, "di bist azoy kheynevdik ven di est reytekh, bazonders
peysakh." From this one may deduct that my great grandparents are not good
sources when studying entemology.  This really bugs me.

Subject: khrein

Regarding horseradish (khrein), we look at the Russian word "khren" which is
pronounced just like that Yiddish word and we have the source.  Where the
Russian came from, knows God.

Subject: origin of word "khreyn"

Morris Fish asked about the origin of Yiddish "khreyn." 

It's definitely Slavic in origin.  I happened to open up a Croatian-language
cookbook at a friend's house one day just to page through it, and came upon
a recipe for "umak od hrena" - horseradish sauce.  Note that the final "a"
is a genitive ending; the word is pronounced exactly as it is in Yiddish. 
The same word also exists in Russian and Slovenian, and possibly other
Slavic languages as well. 

Hope this helps.  
Zayt gezunt.

Subject: Alsatian Yiddish

I just wanted to confirm Dan Leeson's message on the current status of
Judeo-Alsatian (09.005). I was in Alsace (primarily Colmar) in March and
asked about the language. I was told that only those who grew up before the
war have any real familiarity with Judeo-Alsatian, and that most native
Alsatian Jews today know only a few words. Any revival would be hampered by
the small but growing Alsatian-language movement, which many Jews in Alsace
believe is attracting nationalist and anti-Semitic elements. Consequently,
there is concern over how Judeo-Alsatian might be manipulated by
Alsatian-language nationalists.

Subject: Error correction in TMR v. 3, no, 101

Filologishe shriftn 3 [not 2] in Endnote 2 to TMR 3.010

In Endnote 2 to v. 3, no. 010 of TMR there is a reference to Filologishe
shriftn 2.  This should be changed to Filologishe shriftn 3.  The date is
correct, i.e. 1929.
