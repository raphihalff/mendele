Subject:  Yiddish Romanization Tool

In response to Paula Grossman, who asks about Romanizing Yiddish texts:

My automated tool at
http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/yiddish/makeyiddish.html has an option
that allows you to enter text in Yiddish letters (either directly in an input box or in a file) 
and get the equivalent in Romanized transcription.  In the first option column, choose 
"Unicode"; in the second, choose "YIVO transcription."  If you use a file, it should be
plain text in utf-8 encoding; my program does not understand Word formatting.

If your text is not in a computer file but rather on paper, you need an optical character 
recognition program.  I have built one, but it isn't easy enough to use for me to publish it.  
But I have succeeded in converting some texts from the Book Center into computer files.

Refoyl Finkl


For that very purpose: Refoyl Finkel's Yiddish Typewriter:

Subject: Yiddish Romanization too

Dear Paula,

If your material is in a format Refoyl Finkl's Yidishe Shraybmashinke understands, that 
would be a great tool because it works both ways and can transform oysyes into letters. 
You can check it out here:
http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/yiddish/makeyiddish.html

If your material is too much to upload and convert on Refoyl's page, you might want to 
consider downloading his superb "yidishtex" package for LaTeX and run the scripts on 
your own machine.

Best,
Peter Gutmann

[Moderator's note: Barry Goldstein and Lucas Fiszman also wrote in to recommend the 
Yidishe Shraybmashinke.]

Subject: shabash

I wonder if this is not a derivate from the Hebrew word "shibesh" to make a mistake, so 
something by fault. It depends of course on the context.

Elvira Groezinger

Subject: shabash

Tayre mentshn: Shabash is a Persian/Farsi/Indian Hindi/Urdu verbal applause heard 
during a poetry competition, a musical performance, a sports event, anything you 
spontaneously appreciate in a public or semi-public setting. I have been at musical 
performances of Sufi music or qawwali concerts and at Classical Indian musical 
performances both there and in the USA where many "Shabashes" were heard when the 
performance of a classical Indian raga was performed and as it reached its climax of 
excitement, again Shabash!

Subject: shabash

In Mendele 23:12, Alexis Manaster Ramer asks about the Yiddish word shabash. In the 
YIVO journal YIDISHE SHPRAKH XXV (1), June 1965, pp. 26-28, A. Ben Ezra's 
article "Shabas, Shabat, Shabash" discusses this in some detail. Shabash is used in 
klezmer-loshn, referring to a custom in Galitsye (Kroke mentioned in particular), of 
money contributed to the klezmorim during the mitsve-tentsl. It is proposed that the word 
derives from Persian, since the custom prevailed there and in Kurdistan. Dov Sadan 
proposed that the word came from Ukrainian. The article includes a reference to a paper 
on klezmer-loshn by Noyekh Prilutski.
