Subject: Lucjan Dobroszycki

I am greatly saddened to report that Dr. Lucjan Dobroszycki died
yesterday (October 24th), in New York.  Burial will take place on
Thursday, in Israel.

While Dr. Dobroszycki was not usually identified with the Yiddish world,
he certainly had deep ties to it.  A survivor of the Lodz ghetto and Nazi
concentration camps, Dr. Dobroszycki returned to Poland after World War
II, where he trained as a historian, specializing in modern Polish -- and
Polish-Jewish -- history, where his studies dealt primarily with the Nazi
occupation of Poland.  Operating under the constraining circumstances of
postwar Polish politics, Dr. Dobroszycki undertook studies of the Polish
press -- legal and illegal -- during the war, edited an abridged version
of the chronicle of the Lodz ghetto, and conducted research on the
extermination of Polish Jewry.

In June 1967, Dr. Dobroszycki was in Jerusalem, where he was a visiting
scholar.  He returned to Poland, where he was caught up in the wave of
official antisemitism of 1968 and 1969, which resulted in his decision to
seek refuge in the United States. He and his family settled in New York
City, and for the remainder of his life he was a member of the research
staff of the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research.  He was also affiliated
with Yeshiva University's Holocaust studies program.

During his tenure at YIVO, Dr. Dobroszycki continued to work on several
projects that he began in Poland (an English translation of portions of
the Lodz ghetto chronicle was published in 1984, and "Reptile Journalism:
The Official Polish-Language Press under the Nazis" was published last
year), as well as a number of new ones. His best known publication is
probably "Image before My Eyes," a photo album on pre-1940 Polish Jewry,
which he co-authored with Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett and which was
recently reissued by Schocken.  His last published study was "Survivors
of the Holocaust in Poland:  A Portrait Based on Jewish Community
Records, 1944- 1947," for which he was honored with a reception at the
Polish consulate.

Dr. Dobroszycki was also known as YIVO's "research consultant to the
stars"; he compiled a history of former New York mayor Ed Koch's
ancestors and was a consultant to Barbra Streisand's film production of
"Yentl" (an indirect Yiddish connection). His name has appeared in
numerous published acknowledgments and documentary film credits.

On a personal note, I will miss Lucjan a great deal.  Mi-kol melamdai
hiskalti, and all who know him learned a lot from him. "What's new in the
shtetl?"  he used to ask.  And now he is in the shtetl no longer.  Koved
zayn ondenk.

Subject: Asch's _God of Vengeance_

Dan, please don't think I'm putting you down, but your plot summary is
incorrect.  In God of Vengeance, the owner of the brothel is a religious
Jew, who intends to buy a torah and a son-in-law with his ill=gotten
gain.  Aside from this portrayal of a "god-fearing man" making his income
from the sex trade, there is a love scene between his daughter and one of
the working girls.  The daughter eventually runs off with the girl and a
pimp, and loses it in a more conventional sense.

At the end of the play, far from sending her downstairs to the brothel,
raving, he shoves her under the bridal canopy with her intended groom.
I'm not sure of the exact scene here - my copy of the play is at home,
and I'm e-mailing from work (shame!).
