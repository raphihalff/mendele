Subject: Yiddish to children

Marti Krow-Lucal's comments in Mendele 5.111 gives me the opportunity to
quote the lines from my recent post (Mendele 5.102) on teaching Yiddish
to children which were inadvertently left out of the original post, and
which address the problem mentioned by Marti:

      I realize that there are many practical problems such as a shortage
      of qualified Yiddish teachers, lack of modern teaching materials,
      and the like. Therefore, what we need is a master plan which
      addresses all the problems, and which develops a Yiddish curriculum
      for children and young adults which will fill the gap which now
      exists in Jewish education.

In that same post I mentioned the textbook _Yiddish_ by Sheva Zucker.
This comes close to what Marti is looking for: a modern text with
exercises. Sheva has also written an answer manual which is available
now, and she has indicated to me that an audio cassette is forthcoming.
There is also another modern text: "Learning Yiddish in Easy Stages" by
Zuckerman & Herbst. It has excellent practice conversations, and when I
taught a class using this text, I recorded all the conversations on
cassette for the class. In transliteration there is a very entertaining
book: _A Sheyner Gelekhter_ by Ruth Levitan.

In the past, on Mendele, there has been some discussion about Yiddish on
CD-ROM.  This would put it on a par with other foreign languages which
are available on CD-ROM (I have Spanish and Russian).  Perhaps it is only
a matter of time before someone does produce such a CD-ROM for learning
Yiddish which will have Hebrew characters, sound, and which will also be
interactive.

Subject: Teaching materials for children

Modern teaching materials in Yiddish are becoming available as we write
this. We just received 2 floppy disks of a Hebrew, Yiddish English
picture dictionary for windows called Aryeh to Zebra. It is an
interactive program allowing children to see a picture and the word for
it in all three languages, as well as hear it spoken. It provides a
choice of three levels of vocabulary and several modes of presentation
(games) whereby the student is involved in capturing the proper letters
to spell the word. It  is  at the introductory level and can be used by
children who can use a mouse, they don't even have to be able to read.

Subject: Secular Yiddish Schools of America Collection

Gella Schweid Fishman writes:

All those who were farvalters (school board menbers), treachers, parents
or students in one or more Yiddish secular schools (Mostly: arber ring,
farband, ordn, or sholem aleykhem) are asked to send originals or xeroxes
of their memorabilia related to these schools to the archival collection
that has been established at The Stanford University Libraries. The
Secular Yiddish Schools Of America Collection is open to use by qualified
researchers, as well as to all those who have contributed to the
collection. All materials are being processed by topical categories and
listed under donor's name. For further information contact: The Secular
Yiddish Schools of America Collection, Stanford University Libraries,

Subject: Klipn

I came across the word "klipn" to rhyme with "lipn".  Lipn is of course
"lips" but I am unfamiliar with the word "klipn." I know that a "klipe"
is a shrew or a tsore, but the plural for klipe is klipes.  Is it poetic
license or is there indeed such a word as "klipn"?

Subject: Zalbander etc.

With respect to the question about the source of zalbander and similar
constructions in Yiddish [cf. 5.110], once again these occur in Middle
High German and in recent German as well. Kluge-Goetze-Mitzka has under
selbander a citation from Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival "Gawan saz,
selbe funfte nider". So the expresssions with selbe are at least as old
as the 13th century in German.
