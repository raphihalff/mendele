Subject: Subtle distinctions

In today's San Francisco Cronicle (Friday, Dec. 4, 1992), a
note about the modifications necessary to prepare the
R-rated movie "Basic Instinct" for television (by replacing
swear words or offensive phrases by less objectional terms)
includes the following:

  "Schmuck is more acceptable than putz."

Well, as they used to say on television, "Isn't that
special!"

Incidently, on the same page, offensive English words are
written as "f---ing" and "bull----."  Apparently, the
editors of the Chronicle believe either that Yiddish terms
are less offensive than English or people who understand
Yiddish are less easily offended.

Subject: Doggerel

Norman Zide inquires about doggerel.  I think it would take
a Studs Terkel type investigation from people of my
generation and older to restore some of those pieces. They
are clearly influenced by the Catskills, but in the
Midwest, they were quite important.  I recall when the
dedicated Zionists in the neighborhood were singing
Hatikvah, back during WWII, Willie Lieberman
(affectionately known as Lieberman the Hebrewman) taught us
the forbidden words:

I had a little candy store,
Business was so bad,
I asked mine mama what to do,
This is what she said.
Take a little gasoline,
Put it on the floor.
Take a match,
Give a scratch,
Poof, no candy store.

We used it to ridicule the more dedicated kids. What did we
know?  We were "yids," "kikes" as we were "affectionately"
characterized by the Polacks two blocks over. We retaliated
with jokes and songs, punctuated with bits of Yiddish,
mostly to hide the punch lines from them.  Our parents did
not want us to learn Yiddish.  My mother refused to speak
it. She wanted to be British, have a nationality
transplant.  But my father would slip into Yiddish when he
didn't want us to know what he was saying.  I think it was
very bad Yiddish because I had no trouble understanding
him.   My friend, Maish Melamed, who is somewhere near 70
now, was the repository for these jokes and songs.  He had
a notebook in which he wrote them.  Perhaps the wave of
nostalgia will impel to me try to find him again, see if he
has the notebook still.  The last time I saw him, more than
a decade ago, he was still singing Tsadie Cohen...

Tsitting in a bathtub,
Minding her own business,
Tsadie Cohen was washing off her dirty feet, her dirty feet
Her feet was full from dirtiness,
Her mind it was on business,
When along comes a plumber with a tool kit in his hand.
Says the plumber to Tsadie, "got a screw driver?"
Says Sadie to the plumber with a sneering on the lips and a
shaking from the hips...

Tsu whom.....etc.

I'll ask around.  Those of us who left the neighborhood and
never came back, who became almost-goyim in the wonderful
world of the academy sometimes think back on where we came
from.  Memories.

Subject: Offensive language

One's attitude toward terms like "shikse" and "shaygetz"
must, I think, be shaped in the context of one's own social
environment. I am the husband of a convert and I am well
acquainted with a number of couples of our type. We all
need to understand that the ambiguity expressed by Ellen
Prince about these terms is not shared by converts to
Judaism in the America of the nineties. We owe them the
sensitivity to acknowledge this fact.

Subject: Offensive language

Re Jacob/Jack/Yank's note -- in case someone doesn not know
what JPFO means -- it is the acronym for Jewish People's
Fraternal Order, the Jewish Section of the IWO,
International Workers Order.

As for Ellen Prince's remarks on Shikse/sheygets, shrartse
etc.  I discussed the whole bit with my husband who grew up
in a Yiddish speaking working class religious family (as
opposed to mine which was a Russian intelligentsia some
Yiddish, mostly Russian speaking when not speaking English
family). He agrees with Ellen about the asymmetric
connotations re shikse and shegets.  Interesting that
family and friends used to remark about me when I was a
little girl also as "Vicki looks like a shene shikse" and
I also had blond hair.

My own feeling about the use of shvartse is that those who
used the term were basically racist and used it as someone
using the term 'nigger' would. I agree with Ellen re the
context in which it was used and it is true that most Jews
never had contact with any blacks other than servants but
generally the use of the term was I believe pejorative.  As
an aside I remember how upset I was when i heard someone
refer to the shvartses when I was in Israel, not knowing
that the reference was to the black coated/black hatted
Hasidic Jews.  But i didn't and don't like that either.

Interesting about the use of goyim only for wasps and slavs
.  I think in my family it was used for any non-jews.

Of course no word is inherently or denotatively pejorative
-- connotatively when a word reflects pejorative feelings,
or is felt to be so by those who are referred to by it it
is pejorative. I was surprised a number of years ago to
learn that Asians considered the term 'oriental' to be
pejorative. That is reason enough not to use it.

Subject: Tsatske/chatchke

On the tsatske/chatchke (or tskaskele/chatchkele) dialect
difference. Is it a regional dialect difference?  My family
used both.  I'm trying to think of whether the use of one
or the other was context dependent but I don't think so.
