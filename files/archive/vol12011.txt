From: Warren Hoffman <whoffman@cats.ucsc.edu>
Subject: Yiddish and Queer Issues

I'm a grad student currently working on my dissertation about queer
Jewish cultural production in the 20th century.  Though my project
looks at some English language texts, the first 3 chapters are on
Yiddish texts, namely God of Vengeance, some Bashevis Singer stories,
and some of Molly Picon's work.  I have 3 separate but thematically
related questions that I hope some of you might be able to answer.  
Please feel free to respond to me via Mendele or at my e-mail:
whoffman@cats.ucsc.edu.

1. Does anyone know when the first Yiddish-language production of Got
fun nekhome took place in the U.S.?  I've heard the date 1913 bounced
around, but nothing definitive.  I think the Yiddish Theater Lexicon
also mentions some sort of debate concerning the show happening in the
Yiddish presa around 1918, but again, can't seem to find specifics.  
I'm trying to track down reviews for such productions and having dates
would be helpful.

2. Does anyone know of other short stories, songs, or texts other than
the ones I'm working on that speak to or allude to homosexual/queer
references in Yiddish texts?

3. Finally, I'm interested in Yiddish terminology for gays.  So far,
there's the obvious "homosexual," as well as "lesbianka" and
"feygelah."  What other terms exists (pejorative or otherwise) to refer
to queers in Yiddish?

**On a related note, I'd like to hear from other queer Yiddishists to
perhaps have us come up with some NEW words to describe ourselves.  It
seems that if we are going to contribute to Yiddish culture, there need
to be ways for us to refer to ourselves our than the clinically
sounding term "homosexual" or the often pejorative "feygelah" (for gay
men).  Please e-mail me privately if you're interested on working on
this project as perhaps I could start a separate listserv to discuss
some of these issues**

A sheynem dank,

Warren (Zalmen) Hoffman
