My name is Benyomin (Ken) Moss, and finally I can lay claim to the status
of a Mendele member. I'm an undergraduate at Rutgers College, where I
have studied history and social science.

I am a secular Jew with a deep love for modern Jewish culture (and a
steadily growing commitment to cultural activism in the Jewish community
here). I'm studying Yiddish for precisely the sort of reasons you might
expect from secular inchoate Yiddishistn (indeed, I am precisely and
entirely one of those that Eliyahu Juni and his ilk find so woefully
inauthentic), and I enjoy it immensely. I'm currently doing independent
study in Yiddish with Professor Moishe Moskowitz.

I anticipate many stimulating years of Mendele, and I'm very happy and
excited to be a member.

Subject: Illuminated Yiddish manuscripts

I am a professor of Art History at Arizona State University who would
very much like to work on a Yiddish project.  If anyone out there knows
of a Yiddish manuscript with illuminations or a Yiddish book with
illustrations that no one is working on will you please let me know?  I
am a specialist in art dating fro m the middle ages through the
seventeenth century and so am not interested in pre-seventeenth century
material. I would be interested in working collaboratively with someone
who is studying the text.

Just to introduce myself, I published a book on "The Beginnings of
Netherlandish Canvas Painting" (Cambridge) and should complete this
summer a book on image s of rape (Princeton).  My only publication on a
Jewish theme was an article on medieval and Renaissance images of the
Wandering Jew, many years ago.

Having just moved to Arizona, where there are more missionaries than
Jews,has rekindled my interest in things Yiddish.

Any ideas?

Subject: Lamed-vovnikim

There are 36 hidden tzadikim that sustain the world! Of course,
36=lamed-vov. There _must_ be a connection.  Maybe because we hear the
cricket's song but rarely see him, and when we get to close, the song
stops. The singer remains hidden!

Subject: Three weeks left for the Australian Yiddish News

The editor of the Oistralisher Yiddishe Nayes announced this week that
unless a deficit of A$70000 was met within the next three weeks the only
Australian weekly Yiddish newspaper would close. The newspaper has been
continuously published since the 1930's. Its first editors included
Melekh Ravitch and Pinchas Goldhar. A "friends of the Yiddishe Nayes"
Fund has been established and may be contacted at the Australian Jewish
News - Yiddishe Nayes Fund P.O. Box 1000 Caulfield South, Australia 3162.
The newspaper is not supported by any communal organisation and up to now
relied on income from advertising and subscriptions and the goodwill of
the english language Jewish News for its existance. The owners of the
Jewish News have indicated that they are unable to meet such ongoing
deficits. The Yiddish newspaper recently appointed a new editor, John
Rosenbloom a younger professional journalist who has been introducing
changes so that the paper meets the needs of a younger generation. The
newspaper deserves our support.
