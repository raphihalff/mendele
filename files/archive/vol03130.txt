Subject: Introduction

I am a second generation american of mostly Austrian heritage.
My parents spoke yiddish around the house, but I never really picked it up
as a second language.  I was just hoping to learn something by just sitting
back and listening. So that's my general "hello" to everyone.

The pronunciation =ufruf= is not "Orthodox". It is the litvishe
pronunciation. In poylishe yidish 'oyfruf' is pronounced =awfreef=
as it is spelt (=aw= being one of the ways of pronouncing khoylem).
One would therefore "expect" the pronunciation =oyfruf= [as spelt]
by litvaks. Since litvaks pronounce 'oyf' as =af= it is perhaps not
surprising that 'oyfruf' undergoes a change in pronunciation. I
believe it is a frequent phenomenon for common words to have an
irregular pronunciation. (No doubt we shall hear from the linguists
on this.)

BTW the (a?) litvishe pronounce the word 'aroyf' as =aruf=. This
confused me no end when I first came into contact with it, as it is
so similar to 'arop' (which I am used to hearing as =arup=.

As to =aufruf=, perhaps someone can tell me: is it a Germanised
pronunciation of a yidish word or is it a genuine usage in W yidish?

Subject: the extra n-sound (and pronunciation in general)

The letter was written by Dr. Eliyahu Ahilea. As he does not have
access to e-mail i send it.

I have been following with interest many of the discussion in the
mendele correspondence. I would like to offer my guess as to what
causes the "creeping -in" of an n-sound (or nasalization) into some
words or names, like "manse" or "mainse" instead of "maise", or
"Yankev" instead of the original name "Yaakov". ("Maise" comes from
Hebrew word "maasiya" - a tale, usually meaning a "tall tale").

In polish language sometimes the n-sound is dictated not by the
letter n but by a sign (like the french cedille) under the preceding
vowel, like in Walesa (pronounced "valensa", or rather more like
"va-wensa"), Czestochowa (pronounced "chenstokhova"), Zajac
(pronounced "zayontz").etc. this polish characteristic probably got
into Yiddish words, including  (as above) words originated in
Hebrew. Another possible influence of polish on Yiddish may be the
changing of the "o" sound into "u" (or "oo"), like in "vos" becoming
"vus". An o with an accent in polish - like Lwow, Piotrkov, Krakow -
should be pronounced more like u. As for different pronounciations
of sounds in Yiddish depending on, for example, geographic origin,
these have no doubt been listed and tabulated in various
publications. In the entry "Yiddish" in the Encyclopaedia Hebraica
(in Hebrew) ther is even a  "map" with a diagram of different
pronounciations of one word as an example ("nadan" - dowry). the
references of this entry are the well known YIVO-Blaeter and the
books by Weinreich (alone) and Herzog & Weinreich.
