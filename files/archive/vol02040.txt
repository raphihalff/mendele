I don't have any good answers, except that I agree you have
to compromise and use a mixture, based on whether the
word's presence in Judaeo-English is "mostly" from Hebrew
or "mostly" from Yiddish.

I have a related problem in the oral use of Yiddish.  We
use only Yiddish with our kids.  I have many words in my
vocabulary that are of Hebrew origin, or in some cases
Yiddish origin, that entered my vocabulary before I knew
Yiddish.  I have adopted my wife's (and her parents')
dialect, which is from Stashiv (Staszow), notable as is
much of "Polish" (southern) Yiddish for the vowel shifts
u->i, ey->ay and ay->aa.

Now, there are many words I grew up with (with no Yiddish)
that are in our Yiddish vocabulary.  Peysekh, sukes, beygl
and lot of others.  I find it very difficult to say
"paysekh" or "sikes", especially because I still use these
words (with their "standard" pronunciation) in English.

So the Yiddish we speak at home is a bit weird.  It's a
pretty good Stashiv-area dialect, as best I can tell; BUT
there are a couple of dozen words where we follow
klal-yidish and don't make the vowel shifts.  Even "zayde"
doesn't kling right, so our kids call my father-in-law
"zeydi", which took him some getting used to.

Comments, anyone?

Subject: yiddish ideology

Whoever is interested in discussing different ideological
and political issues related to the Yiddish renesance of
our days, is wellcome to contact me personally:
morim@ccsg.tau.ac.il

In Israel this issue is getting more and more importance.
And I would like to share our experience with those
interested.

Subject: Anschel

Anschel is listed on p. 61 of Zunz, Leopold: Die Namen der
Juden. Leipzig: 1837., along with Anschelm, and a mark
indicates that according to Zunz the two are connected.
Zunz quotes several occurrences in Medieval sources, such
as the Maharil (xiv c.) Anselm is a German name, according
to the Meyer's Enziklopaedisches Lexikon, ans = Gott + helm
(helmet), the name became popular in the Middle Ages, after
the xi century saint Anselm (Anselmus) of Canterbury. Sh
and s were pronounced almost identically in the Middle
Ages, see the French and German glosses in Rashi.

Subject: Geshlekhtikayt

Regarding Vicki Fromkin's raising of the geshlekhte
question, what about that old favorite on Shabbes and
Yontif, "mekaye mitzvos?"

On another subject, albeit less provocative.......

Shloyme Axelrod was recently lamenting the poor condition
of a video of The Dybbuk he recently saw.  It might be
worth checking out the Brandeis collection of remastered
Yiddish films on video.  They are a bit costly to rent so
they are typically used for programs for organizations,
however, they have been very well preserved and are worth
the watch.
