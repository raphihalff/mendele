The origin of kanarik, kanarikl, is likely that of 'canary', and the literal
meaning is the same.

The humorous meaning is a would-be, a not-quite, a self-important singer.
This meaning and usage are beautifully caught in a 1930s Mikhl Rosenberg
skit about an outraged "Shepsl Kanarik" , who is forced to prove ("Makhn
probe") to a shul committee that he is worthy of being hired as a
khazn...and fails - "..a laytisher khazn, a gevaldiker khazn...ikh, Shepsl
Kanarik, vos hot gedavnt in die greste shteyt in der gantser velt! dray yor
hob ikh gedavnt in Pokeepsie..." The best line is: "M'hot-zekh geshlogn iber
mir, m'hot-zekh geshlogn!!!...ikh hob oykh gekhapt a por petch." Kanarik is
also be used as an affectionate term of praise for a great singer, a fine
voice.

I suspect, too, that there is another usage, signifying one who is volubly
confessing, as in the English, "singing like a canary".

Subject: kanarik un soloveitchik

Miriam Isaacs (Mendele 13.015) offers the hypothesis that "kanarik" is a
synonym of "soloveitchik", both meaning canary.

Sorry: soloveitchik comes from the Russian "solovey", which means
nightingale. Both words, of course, can be used as epithets for singers with
unusual - though not equivalent! - voice qualities.

About the meaning of "kanarik": the explanations offered are all plausible,
but here's another one anyway: my friend Zwi Kanar, the well-known mime,
says that in his family, they believe that their name means 'canary' and
that it refers to their height - they tend to be short. As a child, he was
called "kleyn kanarikl" for this reason.

While Yiddish "kanarik" is defined only as "canary" in the Weinreich and
Harkavy dictionaries, in the Kosciuszko Foundation's Polish-English
Dictionary "kanarek" is given the alternate definitions of "trickster,
crook" (and also "military policeman").  That is the probable meaning of the
nickname.  And I may be off base, but I think that "kanarik" is also used
for a rude gesture.

Kanaerik is underworld slang. I think it referred to someone who strutted
around, full of himself, a big shot of sorts. I know it was used that way in
Mottke Ganef by Sholem Asch.

In Brownsville, it was occasionally used by a proud parent after a little
boy did something clever in the sense of calculating.

Yes, but WHAT WAS THE MUSIC?  I mean, what tune was that?  What sort of
music?  It would be nice to know.  Any Klezmer scholars about?  Any old
canary? or a specific tune?

'ofreef' (Mendele 13.015) is far di geshtrofte.

In a 'Litvak' home, you say 'oofroof.' I suspect that 'Aufruf' may have
evolved in the hands of 'orthographic  beautifiers,' or some well-meaning
yeke-lovers.

[See Ruben Frankenstein, Mendele 13.015]

The Communist camp in the 30s at Beacon, NY, was called Camp Nit
Gedayget...or Camp Carefree, in English. I believe there was a book called
FOLLOWERS OF THE TRAIL  [Pioneers in Stalinland] out a few years ago.  I
have it somewhere, full of photos. Diehards, Moscow Trials and all.
