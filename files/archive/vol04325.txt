Subject: Mentsh words

How about (Meylekh Vishvanath ? ) Urdu insaan ?

Less esoterically, in a memoir of (the short story writer and poet)
Raymond Carver, someone  (this is from rough memory) referred to Carver
as a (real) mentsh - or 'as he would have said ..a (real) sweetheart'.A
little closer to the mark I think (Carver was from the Northwest) than
'human being' ?

Subject: Another piece of mentsh

The expression I've always liked in relation to that word, one that says
a whole lot, I think, about the nature of Ashkenaz, is: A goy ken oykh
zayn a mentsh.

Al dos guts to Louis and everyone else.

Subject: Yidl mitn fidl

I can't shed any light on the lyrics, but I have a question.  Is there
another version?  It seems to me that I remember an old Jan Bart
recording with a similar, but different text.

Subject: yidishe farlagn

Ikh volt gevolt makhn a reshime fun yidishe farlagn.  Voltn mendelnikes
gekent mir shikn di nemen fun di farlagn un vos far bikher zey geben oys?

I am compiling a list of yiddish publishers.  Could mendelnikes send me a
list of publishers (that they might know of) and the type of books they
publish.

I know bobby getsoff is on our list.  Perhaps she could email me; also
ellen prince wrote of marion wright (?) the oxford person (who was
mentioned in the english article that she posted, as a yiddish
publisher).
