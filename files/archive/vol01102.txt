Ellen, without regard for the Yinglish phenomenon, the
Yiddish of "Womzi" renders thge final unstressed vowel as
"i" (more or less). Thus, "shmati" too, I presume. Call it
i-like.

Bob, Thanks for the nigrella story. It's been eluding me
for a long time.

Fishbane: koyletsh is the word-of-choice for Sabbath bread
 at some locations in Eastern Europe. Where are the Jews of
 Winnipeg from, essentially? Elsewhere, koyletsh has other
 definitions. It's always round, though. Toronto, the city
 of Polish Jews, has its own regional forms--bilke khale,
 for one: a rectangular loaf of 12(?) bulkes in two rows.
 What do they call the "egg bread" you mentioned?

Mazl-tov on surpassing 100. biz hudert-un-tsvantsik doesn't
seem apprpropriate at this point. Ken yirbu!

Another word to the matter of "Sabbath bread" The
authority on the subject of its variant regional
designations and of thge variant regional meanings attache
d to those words, the decorations for special occasions,
etc., is Elinor (Leah) Robinson. She's not on E-mail,
unfortunately. Her dissertation will reveal all.

Mikhl.

I believe koyletsh is the standard Yiddish for twisted egg
bread.  It became known to some as khale because of the
portion removed for Priestly use; among others it became
known as "gebensh" (my memory is weak here; it was some
such) for the same reason (namely, you make a blessing as
you separate the khale portion).

Probably from the Polish word "kolacz" (pronounced
"kowatch") which comes from "kolo", meaning "wheel". This
was a traditional Polish bread-like cake, round-shaped, and
sometimes very big. The ingredients vary, but some
varieties of kolacz do taste a bit like chalah, although in
general, kolacz tends to be somewhat more cake-like than
bread-like. Kolacz was very popular in most (if not all) of
Poland - at least in the past.
