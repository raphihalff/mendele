Subject: Yiddish is going off the air!

Ruvn Millman seems to have misunderstood me when he wrote:

>Ellen seems to think that if more people read the English Forward it
>doesn't matter if there is Yiddish on the air in New York or not.

My point was that, if money is the issue (as it always is), then the
more people that subscribe to the English Forward, the more money the
Forward Association will have, and the more likely they are to be able
to afford Yiddish programming on WEVD.

>The least we can do
>is to voice our opinion before it is all over.

Well, yes, that is indeed the _least_ you can do. If you'd like to do a
little more than the least, you can pay a subscription fee to the
Forward Assn. (I think it's called 'Put your money where your mouth
is.') Or find them sponsors.

And of course I am also all for subscribing to the _Yiddish_ Forverts --
but I assumed that all concerned Mendelyaner who can read Yiddish
already did that!

Subject: Yinglish or Yiddish

In Mendele 6.072 Bruce Gale asks whether the s in "s'hitzed" is an
English addition or adaptation.  It seems to me possible this could be a
dialect form of "tsi" -- as in "tsi-hitzed," heated-up.  My grandparents
used to say of some one perturbed or anxious that he or she was
"tsi-ujit."  ("ujit" is the best shortened form I can do.)  I suppose
"ujit" is a slavic word.

Subject: "s' hitzed"

The word is properly "tze(r)hitzt," meaning "heated up."  The prefix
"tze(r)-" forms an intensive verb, e.g., "tzerbrokhn" [broken(-down,
beyond repair)], "tze(r)kokht" [(over)cooked], etc.  I've heard
"tzehitzt" used more commonly as a synonym for "(oys)farfrumt" than for
"b'roygez," but that may just be an artifact of the circles I travel in.
My sense is that "upset" or "excited" are probably more accurate than
"angry;" I like "worked up" as a good, general English gloss because of
its broad applicability.

Hope this helps.  Gut moed alemen.

Subject: Pi pa po

I grew up in a Yiddish-Russian-English speaking family with both parents
prolific Yiddish writers. I remember my father, born in Belarus and
grown up in the Ukraine, using an expression "pif paf un poter gevorn"
with the pif and the paf accompanied by slapping the palms of the hands
accross each other. It was used in the sense of "bang, bang and all
done!" when trying to convince me that a job, such as washing the
dishes, shouldn't take long. Since both pif and paf were used by
children as shooting sounds when playing with toy guns, is it posssible
that pi pa po is just an abreviation and that "bang bang" is Yinglish?

ghetto published in France in 40s or 50s in Yiddish. Possible candidates

Subject: Bund book

The second of the two books sought by Ellen Goldbaum and Andrew Kolin is
doubtless Bernard Goldstein's "Tsvontsik yor in varshever bund,
1919-1939" (Twenty years in the Warsaw Bund) (New York, 1960). It is
available at the YIVO library.

Subject: "Maiden name" af yidish

How do you say _maiden name_ in Yiddish?

Of course, one could say "ir meydlsher nomen iz geven..." [her name
prior to her marriage was...].

But there is a folksy way of expressing it in Yiddish.

The formula is:  _Fun der heym_iz zi geven a (former family name), for
instance "a Fridman, a Shmulevits, a Bakaleynik," etc.

In this context "fun der heym" [from her home] means that until the
woman got married her family name was a... (specified, as in the
examples above), and that, upon her marriage, as was customary in former
years, was changed to that of her husband's last name.

Subject: Curses

Martin Davis's "pseudo-curse" with "the mildest of content" (_du zolst
esn kreplekh_) may not be so innocent after all, given the following
proverbial context:

Ven me shlogt est men kreplekh:  az men shlogt kapores [yom kiper], az
men shlogt heshaynes [sukes] un az men shlogt homenen [purim].  Un az
der man shlogt di vayb, esn zey beyde kreplekh (Sh. Einhorn).

Bernstein has a slightly different variant:

	Ven men shlogt, kokht men kreplekh.

He adds an explanation:

Bay yidn iz a minheg tsu kokhn kreplekh dray mol in yor, nemlekh:  erev
yom-kiper, ven men shlogt kapores, hoyshone-rabe, ven men shlogt
hoyshanes, un purim, ven men shlogt homen.  Der folksvits zetst nokh tsu
a firtes mol--ven men shlogt dos vayb.
