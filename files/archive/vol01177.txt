Subject: KLAFTE

I have already learned that _klafte_ is from Western
Yiddish, but its sense there is more playful than in
present- day Israeli "slang" (i.e. informal Hebrew) -- a
Yeke I know tells me that Paula Ben-Gurion was the perfect
_klafte_ and that you could tell someone "Don't be a
klafte" without offense.

The word is cited in a Nassau glossary by Frank as used by
the rural Jews to mean 'boese Weib', yet Uriel Weinreich
says somewhere that Alsace and other rural Jews used
_klafte_ as a term for 'mare'.  The word seems to have
been created in Western Yiddish and exported eastward.  Is
there a similar word in Aramaic?  Why did the _klafte_ form
win out over the more paradigmatic _kelefke_?

Apparently in Yiddish if you meant _bitch_ in a mean way
you used _kalbe_ or _arure_ and _klafte_ was addressed to
women who henpecked their husbands.  Was there perhaps a
diminution in the playfulness of the meaning as the word
moved East, just as it is less playful in today's Israeli
slang?  My wife and daughter assure me that there are
_klaftes_ and that they exist because a male-dominated
society doesn't allow women the outlets of aggression
available to males, which is why you get their devious,
sneaky patterns of nastiness.  A South-African friend tells
me that in her Yiddish in So Afr. a _klafte_ was perhaps
mean but not nasty, which again reminds one that words --
dictionary meanings notwithstanding -- mean different
things to different people.

Incidentally, the fact that I was asked by a local paper to
say something about _klafte_ for an "entertaining" article
again points to the widespread stereotype of Yiddish as
ludic.

I don't know about Orthodox Jews in Ashkenaz 2, but I for
one do feel strange about using some words in the bathroom.
e.g. sholem is supposed to be name of Hashem and so I avoid
saying sholem aleykhem. I feel similarly about git shabes,
although I don't have any defensible reason for that.  I
suspect that there may be other such people.  So your
hypothesis regarding Ashkenaz 3 is quite reasonable. (I
presume that's what your 'and 3?' meant.)

Why "mezuza" and "mezuzot" in L.P.'s posting to _Mendele_
1:172?

Is it not bowing to Hebraist hegemonism to privilege
transcription from modern Hebrew?  Vaynraykh has "mezuzah"
(pp. 203, 553); I prefer "mezuze" (i.e. the standard
romanization), italicized. "Mezuza" (sing.) is, I suppose,
unmarked, hence unexceptionable, but "mezuzot" is a
political statement conceding the "translatability" of
modern standard Hebrew, but not of modern standard Yiddish.
"Mezuzahs" makes of the item something Anglo-American,
"mezuzes" something Yiddish, "mezuzos" (written thus in a
local Chabad publication) something Ashkenazic, "mezuzot"
something Israeli. Orthography, here as so frequently
elsewhere, bespeaks ideology.
