I would like to know, how you translate: 1) the American man, 2) the
American woman, 3) the American land, and 4) the American cities.  My
question is, do you inflect geographical adjectives?  Weinreich and Katz say
no, but Schaechter's discussion in Yiddish II shows that such adjectives are
inflected.  What do the Mendelyaner do?

Subject: hoyler shed

Towards the very end of Bergelson's OPGANG, when Khaym-Moyshe is holding
his last imagined conversation with the dead Meylekh, he tells his friend
that Meylekh's committing suicide was an act Khaym-Moyshe describes as
"hoyler shed" (shin + daled). Can anyone suggest an apt and exact
translation for this phrase, one that does NOT carry connotations of
"devils" and/or "demons"? Are there any native speakers of Ukrainian
Yiddish out there -- or any one else -- to whom this phrase is familiar,
and who might advise on its exact meaning? All suggestions will be most
welcome, as will all comment on Bergelson's use of this phrase.

Subject: Aharon Appelfeld on Yiddish

As Herman Taube noted, Aharon Appelfeld indeed reads and enjoys Yiddish. 
His batchelor's degree from the Hebrew University was in Yiddish, under the
late, encyclopediac Dov Sadan. 

Read his appreciate preface to my wife, Golda Werman's, _The Stories of
David Bergelson_ [Syracuse University Press] to see that his knowledge of
Yiddish is clearly literary.

Subject: Rozhinkes mit mandln

On rereading Goldfaden's famous song 'Rozhinkes mit mandln', what I 
find strange is: I have read that the operetta is set in post-biblical 
Jerusalem and this song is from the operetta. Although the first 
verse: 'In dem Bes Mikdash in a vinkl heder, zits di almone bas Zion 
aleyn" has a post-biblical setting, the song goes on to speak of 'Es 
vet kumen a tsayt fun ayzbanen', which made me think that it is 
referring to the child's prospects in America, as railroads are a bit 
advanced for Jerusalem at that time! Although it could just be poetic 
licence.

Therefore I would like to know, is the popular version of the song 
exactly that from the operetta, or was there an earlier version that 
was sung in the operetta and the popular version is his American 
adaptation. If so it would be very important for me to find the 
original. I am researching a Hebrew poet/playwright from Lvov, who is 
said to have translated/adapted the song in Hebrew in the 1890's. My 
poet would have seen the operetta in Lvov in 1890. It is easy for me 
to recognise his adaptation of the first verse, but the subsequent 
verses bear no relation to the rest of his poem.

Finally the legend that the operetta is based on. Dov Sadan refers to 
it as 'Huldah and Bor' also as the 'Faithful Witnesses'. I found a 
legend on Huldah but not in connection with 'bor' which was only 
listed as a catagory of talmudic tort i.e. 'pit'. As unfortunately I 
do not have access to Sadan's article on the legend. Could anybody 
tell me any more about it?

Thanks

Subject: meaning of "plotz"

Can anyone help me with the proper use of the word "plotz"?  I have read
that it literally means to "explode" but I have seen it used with other
meanings, e.g. collapse or die.  Is it wrong to say, "I was so tired I could
plotz?"  Any advice would be most appreciated.

Does anyone know of an English, Russian or Hebrew translation of Mani Leyb's
Der Fremder ?

Mayn tate nutst dem oysdruk gor oft, ober er zogt nisht

                nor 
"kop, moyekh, magistrat!"

My father uses this expression, but the last word is different.
Magistrat refers to city government.

Why not have the Forward Show on the Internet?

In response to Robert Goldenberg's request of a copy of the Forward Show,
allow me to give the example of Mark David's excellent radio program,
available on his website at: 

http://world.std.com/~yv

It is a good example of how The Forward could make its Yiddish programming
available to people outside of the New York area. As a matter of fact, Mark
David has a program that Henry Sapoznik did on the Forward Show featuring a
recording of Sholem Aleichem.

Subject: Yiddish for a complete beginner

I want to learn Yiddish. I am asking for some advice from cool list members.
What books, audio tapes, video tapes or other media would you recommend to
learn Yiddish? I want to pursue self study and learn to speak (more
important than read or write, although I can read hebrew already). My
grandmother (from Latvia)  speaks one dialect and my hasidic friends
another. Is there anyway to remedy the situation by learning something so I
can communicate with both? 

I guess I am looking for some overall advice, specific books, audio titles
and anything else you would think is useful. 

Please reply to me personally or to the list if your reply will benefit
others. 

Thanks in advance!
