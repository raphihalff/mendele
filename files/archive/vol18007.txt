Subject:  theatrical adaptation of "The Travels of Benjamin the Third"

The most famous one was done in 1927 by the GOSET (Moscow State Yiddish
Theatre) with Shloyme Mikhoels   and Veniamin (Benjamin) Zuskin playing the
two lead characters.

Yidishpil, the Yiddish Theatre in Tel Aviv, presented it in 2007 with
Yaakov Bodo. Here is a link to the article that Zuskin's daughter, Alla,
wrote after seeing the play:

There was a Soviet Yiddish theatre play--here's a link to an article:

And a film, "The King and the Fool," I believe has film footage of that
play in performance.

Subject: tsebalavet/tatele

The word comes from the Russian verb balovat' meaning "to spoil (someone)."
In Yiddish it is probably "tserbalevet," the suffix "tser" stemming from
the German. "zer" (zer-reissen, zer-brechen, etc..) indicates an action
that is negative and also total.  A "tserbaleveter yingl" is a child
spoiled through and through!

As for "tatele," I find Sylvan Beer's explanation less credible than the
simpler one, i.e. both "tatele" and "mamele" are terms of endearment
stemming from the love we bear our fathers and mothers:  as a matter of
fact, I have heard "mamele" addressed to people other than children!
Romanians use the word "mamica" (mommy) as a term of endearment, and will
even use it for boys (or adult men!) in the masculinized form "mamicule"! I
have not heard them use the word for father "taticu" in the same manner.

Subject: mukte, bukte

I am trying to find out more about a Yiddish expression, "mukte, bukte" or
"mukhte, bukhte" or some variation of that supposedly derives from "matke
boga" and refers to the expression on Jesus' face at the time of his death.
I have looked into this phrase before, about 10 years ago, but don't have
any record of what I discovered and don't remember much either. I seem to
remember that the expression is used to describe a strange facial
expression, and that the etymology was the mother of god/Jesus' dying look
explanation. Any insight into this phrase, its origins, usage, spelling
variants, etc. would be appreciated.

best,
Matt Hoffman

Subject: Clara Lemlich speech

Martin Cohen can look at: Gerard Sorin, "The Prophetic Minority" (Indiana
UP 1985) and Kenneth Kann and Joe Rapoport, "The Life of a Jewish Radical"
(Temple UP 1981).

Subject:  film about Jewish life in Lemberg

I have very belatedly just now read the query about a film on Jewish life
in Lemberg. Could this possibly be the documentary short produced by the
Goskind brothers in 1939 along with films about four other communities
(Vilna, Krakow, Warsaw, and Bialystok)? (There was supposedly also one
about Lodz, but it has been lost.) These films are available for purchase
on video from both Ergo Media and the National Center for Jewish Film.
