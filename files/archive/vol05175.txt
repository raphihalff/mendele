Subject: Sol Liptzin

It was my pleasure to have corresponded with Sol Liptzin about Israel
Emiot--his life, my translations, etc.  The letter I received in reply
was generous, supportive, and helpful, in the ways of only great human
beings....It was dated Jan. l992.  In part it said, "...At 90 my
eyesight is declining.  Fortunately I can still read poetry, but have
given up reading voluminous volumes."  So I guess we can take confort
also from his zest for life and learning.   Hope this snippet of memory
is of use.

Subject: Neshome keyn rozhinke

[In regard to Rick Turkel's post (1.159)]:

Your theory that the expression "Un mayn neshome iz dokh a rozhinkeh?" is
used to say, "What am I, chopped liver?" is in the ballpark but not quite
in the right section.  This expressionis used when you want to say, "Am I
not a flesh and blood human being with natural urges and desires?"  It
was often used to justify a person's pursuit of the fleshpots;
particularly his/her carnal desires.  I once read that Golde Meir, after
her separation from her husband, began a relationship with another man.
Since they were both adults it might be assumed that their relationship
involved more than a discussion of Torah.  When told that people might
talk, her response was, "Iz mayn neshomeh den a rozhinkeh?" [Is my soul
(as inanimate) as a raisin?]

Subject: Khushim ben Dan

[In regard to Noyekh Miller's post (1.159)]:

I found your attempts to root out the story that goes with, "Khushim ben
Dan" most interesting.  The research that you put into it convinces me
that you are as much a "mishugener" as I am.  You indicate that you came
to the "hesitant conclusion" that although his name was manhandled, it
seems to be related to deafness (Stutchkoff).  I have some problems with
this given the context in which Pinski used it.  If you were going to a
rich person in hopes of a handout, would you address him as, "Old deaf
one...?"  People with infirmities do not like to be reminded of them and
sycophants are usually quick with compliments even when none are
deserved.  I think you're justified in assuming that the Khushim referred
to is the one from Genesis because it says, "Khushim ben Dan". But can
something else be inferred from this?  But in 46.23 it reads, "And the
sons of Dan, Khushim."  If it's the "sons of Dan" why is there only one
name?  Were all of Dan's other children daughters? Was the "khoyleh" in
Pinski's play an only son?  Did Khushin have any other "mayles" other
than deafness?  Were those who came to visit the sick man trying to "suck
up" to him by referring to him as one who was worthy of being the son of
Dan?  If you read Genesis 49:16-18 we see that the position awarded to
Dan had quite a bit of "koved" attached to it.  You might want to try to
contact Prof. Dov Noy who is probably the most respected folklorist and
specialist in "verltakh" alive today.  In any event, siz a fargenign mit
aykh 'durkhtsuredn' vegn an inyen vos hot di ziskayt fun a yidish vertl.

Subject: A Wartime song from Israel with a Yiddish lilt

I have been asked by my Israeli Nephew to ask about a famous ditty that
was sung during or really just prior to the six-days war in June of 1967
Singing in anticipation, the brave words were "Nasser mechakeh le'Rabin,
ay yai yai... and so on. My nephew is sure that the song has its origins
in a bawdy Yiddish song that he doesn't know the words to. Does any
Mendelyaner in or out of Israel have a clue? If so kindly reply or else
my nephew will be very upset with me.

Subject: Yak reydele (sof)

Maybe, to put this Shulem Aleykhem's 'Motl Peysi' quote to rest, Bob
Rothstein should have completed S.A.'s last quote as: 'So, be a stalwart,
and translate (the above) into English'.

Daniel, I agree that translation of a Yiddish/English translation into
Yiddish is difficult.. How often is that done?

Anyhow, Bob, can you finish this "a sof zol es trefn"?? and translate:'
yak'; and 'dobri', and any other words Americans don't know?
