Subject: Ho-admur; introduction

I have just had the pleasure of reading Reb Zellig Bach's posting on the
Vilna Gaon, Zal, and thought a small comment might be of some interest.

Reb Zellig translates "Ho-admur" as "the teacher."  Well, that's not
wrong, exactly, but as a mefunak (a finicky guy who likes precision),
permit me to add th e following details:

"Ho-admur" (hey, alef, dalet, mem, vav, resh) is customarily prefixed to
the na mes of Hasidic rebbes.  L'moshel, "Ho-admur mi-Bobov, sh'lita,"
i.e., the Admur from Bobov, sh'lita.  "Ho-admur" in full is "Ho-adon
moreynu v'rabbeynu," "the master, our teacher and our rabbi."  It's an
honorific, all right, and a rathe r special one at that.

While we're at it, what about this "sh'lita" business?  (shin, lamed,
yod, tes, alef).  "She-yichyeh l'yomim tovim, omeyn," "may he live for
good days, omeyn."

Since I have never introduced myself to my fellow Mendelniks, and I see
that such is the minhog, let me take this opportunity.  I'm a professor
of philosophy and adjunct prof. of law at Pace University in New York
(philosophy in Pleasantville and law in White Plains).  I grew up in
Denver, got a little yiddish learning in New York, spent three splendid
years in Montreal, where I acquired an appreciation of mamme loshen that
might have escaped me if I had not had the opportunity to meet some of
the wonderful Montrealers and participate in their very special evenings
of poetry at the Lermers'.  (By the way, does anyone know where they are
now?)

I'm most pleased to join your chevra, and look forward to reading your
postings and to contributing, from time to time.  Meanwhile, my wish for
all Mendelniks is that sheyich'yu l'yomim tovim, omeyn.

Subject: Again about the Vilner Ge'on

The Ge'on of Vilna (see Zellig Bach's posting, mendele 4.272) plays a bit
part in a story told by the Hasidim.

One evening, in a shtetl in the Ukraine, a Hasidic preacher, or magid,
opens his door to a knock and is surprised to find a local businessman,
orthodox and anti-hasidic (what the Hasidim call an adversary, a
misnagid).  He welcomes the unusual guest, who tells him, "As you know, I
do not hold with you or your beliefs or your ways, but I have a dreadful
problem.  I should like to put it to the Vilner Ge'on, but my business
keeps me here and my problem gives me no relief, so I am come to you on
the slim chance that you may be of some help."

"So what is your problem?"

"My late father, may he rest in peace, is precisely not resting in peace.
He comes to me every night in my dreams, insisting that I convert to
Christianity.  You knew what a pious and devout Jew he was; never never
in this world would he have entertained such a thought; but now from the
other world he torments me with this demand."

"Take up your father's body from the grave.  You will find that some
sticks of coffin furniture have fallen on his breast in the form of a
cross, and that is what has been weighing down his soul.  Straighten the
sticks, bury your father again, and he really will rest in peace."

The misnagid, incredulous, thanks the magid and leaves.  The terrible
spectral visits continue.  At last the misnagid follows the magid's
advice, and to his astonishment everything turns out as the magid had
said.  The misnagid's nights are peaceful again.  He is impressed and
grateful, and in a few months, finding himself in Vilna, he obtains
audience of the Ge'on to tell him of this wonder.

The Ge'on listens attentively and comments: "Quite interesting, indeed.
It happens that this very matter is touched on in an obscure and
difficult passage in the Jerusalem Talmud.  The more credit to your magid
down there."

On his return to the shtetl the misnagid waits upon the magid and bestows
on him the praise from the Ge'on.  The magid replies: "Hmm. The Ge'on
knows it from the Jerusalem Talmud?  _I_ know it from where the Jerusalem
Talmud knows it from."

Subject: Recognized English usage of yiddish words

I,too, have encountered Kathryn Hellerstein's situation when writing for
the popular press. "Khutspe" just doesn't make (the success of
Dershowitz's book with the amerikaner spelling didn't help. As to the
list, nor bei uns yidn iz faran azoyn mishigas. tsvey yidn, dray da'es.

Subject: Lamed-vovnik--a query

I am writing a biography of my great-grandfather, Moshe Yehoshua
Rabinovich, who came from Vishneva, a shtetl near Vilna, to the U.S. c.
1903.  His son remembers that "Papa spent a great deal of time in the
1930's filling many composition books with fine Yiddish script.  I once
asked him what he was writing and he told me that it was a fantasy
describing a group of people who went around the world doing good deeds,
like building dams, bridges, mills, etc."

When I repeated this story to a friend, she said it sounded the "Lamed-
Vovnik" story about the souls who are re-born in each generation to make
the world better.

Can anyone shed any light on this story? A dank,

Diane Rabson

Subject: Umbeshrign

A friend asks me if I know a Yiddish word something like "umbeshrign",
which he thinks means something like "knock on wood". I don't, and can't
find it in Weinreich. Does it ring a bell for any of you?

give a get unless the wife gives up the appartment!) In any case, on the
29th ( at 317 allen st.  in Syracuse) I and Arre Komar will do a program
of Yiddish folk songs.  All mendelniks are of course invited to come sing

their curiosity piqued about what is Mendele. and have asked me to speak
on this( I cannot do it in Yiddish...until I read Reb Fridlander's
vunderbar verte..so i will bring my lap top down into the living
room..and show them some Mendele postings which i have saved into a

Mendele is precious  ..even for those of us who mostly "lurk " and kvell"
from mendele reportages, fusses, anecdotes...and even technicial and
fascinatingly arcane bits of linguistics. Zoln undzere shammos lebn biz
hundert und tvantsik!... zay gezunt allemen.
