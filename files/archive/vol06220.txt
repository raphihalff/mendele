Subject: Byron's Mazepa

Since nobody answered Louis Fridhandler's question [6.215] about Byron's
poem Mazeppa and Byron's sources for this poem, I thought I would jump
into the breach. Byron's poem was published in 1819, and is founded on a
passage from Voltaire's Charles XII, King of Sweden. In this version,
Mazeppa is one of the king's officers who tells a tale of his early
life, when he was strapped naked to a horse which carried him into the
Ukraine. Mazeppa, at the point of death, is rescued by Cossacks. I
cannot judge the historical accuracy of this story, but it does seem to
have a connection to the infamous hetman. Incidentally, my understanding
is that in Yiddish, the term "mazepa" refers to someone who is ugly,
ergo "mazepevke" is an ugly little shtetl.

Subject: Yosl, Yosl!

In response to Judith Nysenholc's request (6.219), here are the words
for the version we sing in our Yiddish chorus at Temple Chai in Phoenix:

Chorus:

Oy, oy, oy, Yosl, Yosl, Yosl, Yosl,
Mayn khayes geyt mir azh oys nokh dir.
Oy, oy, oy, Yosl, Yosl, Yosl, Yosl,
Dayn malke sitzt nokh alts un vart oyf dir.
Oy, oy, oy, Yosl, Yosl, Yosl, Yosl,
Ikh kholem yeder nakht nor fun dir,
Un git der yetzer hore
Nokh a mol a tore,
Yosl ikh krapir nokh dir.

Verse:

Mayn khayes geyt mir oys,
Ikh fil ikh halt nit oys,
Mayn harts tut mir vey gor on a shir,
Es iz mir heys un kalt,
Un ikh ver groy un alt,
Un veyst ihr mentshn vos es kveyt mir,
Die libe brent a shrek,
Ikh fil ikh shtarb avek,
Nokh mayn Yoslin, mayn darling, mayn dear,
A bokher a sheyner,
Mir zayn far zayne beyner,
Yosl, ikh krapir nokh dir.

English:

Oh, Joseph! Joseph! won't you make your mind up;
It's time I knew just how I stand with you.
My heart's no clock that I can stop and wind up
Each time we make up after being through.
So listen Joseph! Joseph! time is fleeting,
And here and there my hair is turning gray.
My mother has a fear, wedding bells I'll never hear;
Joseph, Joseph, won't you name the day!?
My mother has a fear, wedding bells I'll never hear;
Joseph, Joseph won't you name the day!?

Subject: Shul memories

Pinyeh Weichsel [6.219] asks for "yiddish apikorsishe mistranslations of
certain siddur phrases".  The only example that comes to mind at the
moment is:

bli rayshis bli tachlis : es fangt zikh nit on un es lost zikh nit oys.

I remember the following:

"ha'mamlich melachim ve'lo ha'melucha": gezaltst und gezaltst und nisht
gefefert.

This plays on the misspelling of the root mem lamed kaf (=king) with mem
lamed het (=salt) and likwise the exchange of lamed vav (=him) with lamed
aleph (=no).

Another play, although with less apikorsus is in Hoshana Rabbah "Kol mevaser
mevaser ve'omer" leading to "mayim shelanu".  Proclamation (mevaser) becomes
water. The twigs of the hoshanos are traditionally used in the matza baking
fire; and mayim shelanu (undser vaser) in reality water that stayed
overnight are used too.

Subject: Bibliography

I hope mendelyaner will forgive me for raising a procedural point, but among
our circle there must be a fair number of people who, like myself, are
responsible for ordering books for institutional libraries. Hardly a week
passes without someone posting a message extolling the merits of a new book
in our field. This is most welcome, but somewhat frustrating if it is done
without mentioning the standard bibliographical data that are indispensible
for ordering the book in question. Could I suggest that we make it normal
practice when announcing new books to quote as many of the following items
of information as possible: Author and/ or Editor, "Title", Place of
Publication: Publisher, Date of publication, Number of pages, ISBN, Price.

Subject: Bibliography

I was getting ready to write to Mendele on a closely related matter, and
so when Hugh Denman's sensible request arrived I decided to use his
Subject: line as well.

The new edition of the Reader's Catalog has just appeared, the first
full edition in a long time.  (For those who are unfamiliar with it, the
RC is a huge annotated listing of some 40,000 books on every subject
imaginable.  It is a valuable tool for middlebrows like most of us and I
suspect that it even gets peeked at behind the gor hoyekhe fenster.)  The
section on Yiddish (English translation of course) in the 1989 edition
was I thought very good, ranging as it did from the Tzena U'Reyna to
Weinreich _History of the Yiddish Language_ (Vols.1-2) and including in
addition to the oves writers such as Moyshe-Leyb Halpern, Bergelson,
Rabon.

Since 1989 there has been if anything an increase in the volume of
translations from the Yiddish into English as well as some important
scholarly works.  Some of these are indeed listed.  And it's always
pleasant to recognize the names of Mendelists among the contributors:
Janet Hadda, Kathryn Hellerstein, David Goldberg, Golda Werman, Hillel
Halkin.

But the overall impression is one of retreat and imbalance, especially
where regarding fiction and poetry.  Asch, Bergelson and Grade are gone,
Mendele and Peretz have one listing each, and all by himself with a
separate heading is the old kishef-makher Bashevis.

Why?  Undoubtedly many causes.  One of which is--and here I get to the
point at last--that _some_ of those 1989 titles are out of print.  And if
they are we have only ourselves to blame.  How can _Jews_ allow books to
go out of print?  Even mediocre ones?  Especially books from the
Yiddish?  A mystery.

But I have a simple if belated solution: Yidn, 's brent a velt, koyft
bikher!  Afile nisht geleyent, koyft!  Vos veln di ureyniklekh ayere
zogn vegn aykh: 'khveys? 'khhob gehat a zeyde-bobe, hobn zey zikh gefoylt
tsutsugreytn far undz a yerishe.  Azoy vilt ir den?  Bet ikh aykh,
koyft, koyft mit beyde hent!

On a cooler note--and back to Hugh Denman's post.  The Yiddish-reading
world needs a well-maintained version of the Reader's Catalog, one that
not only offers an annotated listing of worthwhile books but enables
them (like the Reader's Catalog) to buy them.  Who can do that for us?
Turns out that the group is already in existence and has for a long time
been doing just that: the Arbeter Ring.  It runs an efficient,
no-nonsense (and without self-glorifying hype) book operation.  The folks
there need simply to spiff up the catalog with some intelligent copy and
bob's your uncle (vi azoy zogt men dos af yidish?).

Vos zogt ir, tayere fraynt?
