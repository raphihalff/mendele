jules levin:

thanks for a very interesting post. two points:

yes, mendele has spent lots of time on wexler's theory. the problem
it has is that it predicts yiddish to be a slavic language; however,
structurally, it is undeniably germanic. all the 'slavic substratum'
effects he claims are typical effects of borrowing from a contact
language, not at all the effects of genetic (language-genetic, i
mean) descent.

ok, so we're semitic... so how come we don't look it? in my musings
on the early settlements of eastern europe by germanic- speaking
jews, i tried at first to account for both the physical traits and
the facts of yiddish. the second scenario would account only for the
latter. of course, it's very possible that neither is right. but
SOMEDAY one would like to account for both, right?

Subject: Khazars in Galicia in writings of Joseph Roth

I've been reading his novel "The Radetsky March" and noticed the
following:

   Many of these traders were Jews. A *lusus naturae*, perhaps a
   mysterious law obeyed by some secret branch of the legendary
   tribe of Khazars, determined that many among these frontier Jews
   were red-headed.

The locale is a village on the border between the Austro-Hungarian
Empire and Russia before WWI. (This is the region where Joseph Roth
was born of Jewish parents.)

Subjects: Books on games; Wexler revisited

Since you asked (Neach Zide, in MENDELE 3.220), the YIVO Library has
a fair number of books and pamphlets on various types of children's
games -- too many to list here.  These include publications on
rebuses, games involving physical motion (bavegungs- shpiln), word
games, even a Hasidic board game (Brooklyn, 1975), plus musical
games as well.  We also have a section on chess. Among secondary
citations brought out in the YIVO catalog is an offprint by Leybush
Lehrer, "Di psikhologye fun shpil"  (Vilna: YIVO,
Psikhologish-Pedagogishe Sektsye, 1933).  Another YIVO publication,
on games of chance, is by Yitskhok (Isaac) Rivkind, "Der kamf kegn
azartshpiln bay yidn" [English title:  "The fight against gambling
among Jews"] (NY:  YIVO, 1946).

Jules F. Levin, in his fascinating treatment of the origins of
Eastern European Jewry (MENDELE 3.221), asks, "But has anyone
brought up Wechsler's [i.e., Wexler's] theory of a West Slavic
substratum as the basis of Yiddish?"  Hoo, boy...  all I can say is
take a look at back issues of MENDELE, for weeks running, last
summer.  There is where you will find all you wanted to know, and
then some, about Wexler's theories as viewed by subscribers to this
list.  In light of recent discussions on genotypes, phenotypes,
etc., maybe we should change the name of this rag to MENDEL (after
Gregor).

Subject: re bloodtyping

I would imagine that the Jews of Rome are a very special particular
community; whereas the study I was citing from Ashley Montague, as I
recall, was a UN, Pos t WW II study that went all over Europe, as I
remarked, from Poland West to Galicia.  Perhaps Sephardic Jews, and
Romans, were not part of the survey.  But... one exception doesnt
discount the other 60,000 samples; hardly.  A universal rule,it
wasnt.  But as germane to the discussion of why Jews are so various,
yet still Jews, well, it is helpful.  Causes are another matter.  I
was hoping to get beyond Great Grandma's abduction and/or rape.
What communities were like once is very hard to imagine.  An
illuminating example: Marco Polo (what or who were they in that
family?) says he stayed about 6 months in a city in what is now
Anatolia, where I have been, only two years ago, to visit the tomb
of the gre at poet Rumi (blocked by memory lapse, though I see it in
thge mind's eye, the Mosque, and have the Sufi tapes, and all that,
and have translated Rumi!), and Polo says, What a dirty dusty empty
place!  And yet that is the place where at the same time Rumi held
court, lived, founding the Dervish order! and wrote 1000s of lines
of the greatest poetry in the tradition of Persian.  Polo had not
the faintest!  And he was there.  I would assume, as a Venetian
traveller waiting for his caravan, he was kept in restricted
quarters; but, not a whiff of local conversation and news and
gossip?  Amazing!

Subject: Tseyre-tsvey-yudn?

I have a several-decades-old Yiddish schoolbook (obviously intended
for English-speaking, probably bilingual, children -- I don't know
the title, author, or date because the cover and title page are
missing), and came across the following anomaly: "ay" is written
with pasakh-tsvey-yudn as usual, but "ey" is written not with the
usual two unmarked yuds, but rather with a tseyre beneath, so it
looks like !!. Has anybody seen this anywhere else? (This same
schoolbook also contains a short story with every sentence in
verb-first order, which I'll post here if people are interested).

Shalom,
Marnen Laibow-Koser
