Subject: Moishe Pipik and Chaim Yankel

On another list, someone wrote:

        There is a writer, based in Israel, who writes a regular weekly
        column for the NYC English language Jewish Weekly Forward.  His
        byline is Philologos. He writes on derivations in Hebrew and
        Yiddish and although I can't remember the exact history, he
        dedicated an entire column to the Moishe Pipik question.

The discussion was as to the origins of "Moishe Pipik" and "Chiam Yankel".
Does any one have information in this regard.

Subject: Minken un kikhelekh

I'm having such an interesting experience I must share...however trivial:

Some weeks ago, after having spoken on the phone with a friend in Yiddish
before bed, I awoke with the phrase "patshi patshi kikhelekh" in my head.
I couldn't quite remember what it was or why it was in my thoughts.  I
could tell that it was a Yiddish rhyme of sorts, but that was it.  Later
in the day I recalled "something something shikhelekh" (the somethings
just standing in for rhythm).  I told a friend and he said that it was a
well known nursery rhyme in Yiddish.  I asked him not to tell it to me, I
wanted to try and remember it on my own...to live with it a bit. I did
not grow up in a Yiddish speaking family, although it was my mother's
first language; we spoke Hebrew and English.  However, my paternal
grandmother did speak some Yiddish around me (with her sister) and my
mother had a repetoire of Yiddish songs to which I remembered mostly
melody with little vocabulary.

Anyway, perhaps it was seeing the words on Mendele the other day, or
perhaps it was showing the film "yidl mitn fidl" to my Yiddish students,
but something set my brain in motion and I woke up yesterday remembering
my father's mother playing with me when I was very young to the words of
the "patshi kikhelekh" rhyme!  I remembered almost all of them, and then
my maternal grandmother (the other is unfortunately no longer living)
filled in the blanks--her version is a bit different from my "Sapta's"
(that's what I called her).  My mother told me yesterday that she also
used to play it with me, but partly in English:

patshi patshi kikhelekh
Aba's gonna' get you shikhelekh
Mommy's gonna' make you sockilekh
red red rosy bekelekh

...or something like that.

Almost done!  One last note: I also remembered my "Sapta" telling me
a favorite English joke of hers:
(Imagine a heavy Polish-Yiddish/Israeli accent)

Vat dit eyn mink say to de udder von?

See you in shul!

Re: S and the Jews: The Borodin Quartet, Jews, knew DS and worked with
him and recorded him, and some of them are still traveling and
performing.  They might be an excellent means of getting information
about this music of S's.
