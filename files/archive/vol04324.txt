Subject: Nisht geshtoygn nisht gefloygn

I'd welcome help with a literate translation into English of the Yiddish
expression in the subject line -- `nisht gestoygn nisht gefloygn.'  My
grandmother used it to mean that something was ridiculous, roughly,
`without head or tail.'  Vladimir Jabotinsky, perhaps with the same
intent, used the expression to describe the first British scheme for the
partition of Palestine in 1937.

Subject: Dovid Katz

in the course of a long and intense phone call from marie wright at
oxford yesterday, i agreed to post a statement she would send me. the
following paragraph is what was faxed to me three hours later:

---------
I misunderstood about the situation at Oxford. I would like to apologise
to all the people concerned, the Oxford Institute for Yiddish Studies and
in particular to Dr. Dovid Katz. I am genuinely sorry for any distress
caused by my misinformed statements.
---------

and below is the guardian article that my (mis)information came from:

Oxford centre suspends Yiddish academic accused of defamation and
misappropriation of funds

[by] Michael Simmons

Dovid Katz, director of Yiddish at the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and
Jewish Studies, was suspended on full pay yesterday accused by the
centre's governors of misappropriating funds and defaming fellow
academics.

Dr. Katz, an American, has been a member of the independently-funded
centre for 17 years. It has 10 Fellows on its teaching staff, and is
associated with Oxford University, sharing lecturers and courses.

The centre's governors have accused Dr. Katz, aged 38, of opening
unauthorised bank accounts and taking expenses without approval. He said
yesterday the charges were "rubbish." He said they would destroy Yiddish
studies at Oxford, and would discredit an Institute for Yiddish he is
setting up.

"The governors are now complaining about all the things they were
thrilled about for 17 years and which the centre's founder, David
Patterson, once described as its crowning achievement," he said.

However, officials at the centre said yesterday: "We are talking about
sizable sums of money" and claimed that Dr Katz, whose salary is L30,000
a year, faced charges that were prima facie of "a serious nature".

The dispute also involves Marie Wright, a non-Jew who was responsible for
coordinating the centre's Yiddish programme until her resignation in
October.

The governors had issued a writ against her, which has subsequently been
discharged, questioning the use of the centre's funds and documents.

It is believed L34,000 has been "frozen" in specified bank accounts by
the governors.

Mrs Wright, who now runs an Oxford Yiddish publishing house -- the
biggest in the world outside Israel -- described the suspension of Dr
Katz yesterday as an attack by "a wealthy establishment on a fledgeling
institute which has so much to offer."

As well as stunning many of the Oxford colleges which include Jewish
studies in the courses they offer, the dispute has rocked the Jewish
community.

While the philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin has praised the centre as being
"for all non-barbarians and for the rebuttal of barbarian tendencies
wherever they exist", others have not been so sure.

Teaching staff at the centre have been dismayed by the increasing
influence of business personalities, who make up about a third of its
ruling governors.

They include the board's chairwoman Dame Shirley Porter.

Subject: A bit more re: mentsh

Thanks to Ellen Prince and Michael Steinlauf (4.321) for expanding the
discussion on "mentsh." I can cite no evidence, but my hunch is that the
exhortation, "Nu, zay a mentsh!" has had great survival value for Jews
down the centuries.  No doubt, the same idea has operated constructively
for other groups.  This became a foreign body to be rejected in the minds
of authoritarians and their supporters.  Being arrogantly supercessionary
is not compatible with being a mentsh.

_Human being_ can carry some of the same force as mentsh in certain
contexts, but I would add an e in most contexts.  _Humane being_ (more
colloquially, a humane person) is more like it. When it can be said that
"Fun im oder fun ir iz take oysgevaksn a mentsh" then a good deal of
character building has been accomplished.  We are all born human beings,
but it takes time and work at building a strong and admirable character
structure to be considered humane.

Subject: L'koved khoydesh Oder

Many years ago my friend Hershl Bershady told me of his plans to develop
a glossary of Yinglish.  The general idea was that many English words
took on new life if pronounced with the stress on a later syllable.
Thus: farFETCHED.  I think some interloper or other picked up on the idea
and made a mint out of it but I hold that Hershl is the true inventor.

Anyway, for close to 25 years I've been trying to come up with khotch
one word to add to his list.  My friends, I have it.  I found it
yesterday in a seed catalog.  The plant is astralagus membranaceus,
otherwise known as milKVETCH.

How do I know that it belongs?  Here's the description in part:

        tonifies the spleen, especially in cases of fatigue

Freyg ikh aykh, tayere fraynt mayne, nisht azoy?
