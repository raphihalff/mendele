Subject: The Language Instinct

Dear Mendele Correspondents,

I was amused and englightened to read the recent discussion (kindly
forwarded to me by several colleagues) of a Yiddish example used in my
recent book The Language Instinct. I had rendered the saying as "Az der
bubbe vot gehat baytzim vot zie geven mein zayde," and I had already
received several letters pointing out that it was puzzlingly nonstandard.

Here is the background. I am not a speaker of Yiddish (to my everlasting
regret), though the saying was familiar to me. I sought the exact wording
from my father, Harry Pinker, a native speaker. He was born in Montreal,
the son of poor immigrants from Krasnystaw, Poland (near Lublin and,
perhaps significantly, a town called Chelm). He insists that the
pronouns, articles, and verbs are exactly as he has always heard them.
The romanization was my fault, and was indeed ad hoc, based in part on my
reading of Leo Rosten (who uses multiple, informal romanizations and
deprecates standardization).

I have already changed the words and spelling to the YIVO standard for
the next edition. The Language Instinct, by the way, has extensive
discussions of dialects, standardized spelling, and attempts to prescribe
"correct" usage. The latter is discussed in a chapter entitled -- what
else? -- "The Language Mavens."

Sincerely,

Steve Pinker

Subject: Derekh eretz for Yiddish

I'd like to make a belated contribution to the debate sparked last month
by Zellig Bach (Mendele 4.102).  I interpreted his proposal as a somewhat
daunting but polite plea for derekh eretz towards Yiddish in Mendele.
I'd like to append that plea with one for tolerance of the limitations of
fellow Mendelniks.

Zellig Bach views Mendele as a "clearing house," "exchange forum" and
ultimately a society (khavruse) for all aspects of Yiddish language and
literature.  I contend that it does an admirable job of doing so, despite
the vast differences in facility with Yiddish among its members.  In the
few months since I first subscribed, I have been enlightened and
entertained, puzzled and outraged, "nudzhet" and challenged -- and
sometimes all within a single Mendele edition!!

Here's the problem as I see it:

1. Klal shprakh is an artificial construct.  Although it is now the
standard accepted by most scholars, I believe that no one actually spoke
klal shprakh two generations ago (except perhaps YIVO scholars).  I agree
that newcomers to Yiddish should learn klal shprakh, and publications
should use its standards.  Its use therefore should be *encouraged* (but
not required) in Mendele.

2. Many Mendelniks do not know klal shprakh.  Some learned Yiddish
several decades ago, from parents and grandparents who spoke their own
dialects, some of whom spoke a more "educated" Yiddish than others.
Others heard a mix of regional dialects, and therefore remember a
mishmash of differing pronunciation rules.  Many stopped hearing or
speaking Yiddish in their childhood, and therefore never developed beyond
a child's language level.

3. Although standards are important, dialects add character to Yiddish.
While promoting the YIVO standard, let's not lose the richness of
regional accents that permeates our folklore (cf. Olsvanger's "Royte
Pomerantzen" and "L'Chaim") and music (/Bay mir bist du *gut*, bay mir
host du "it"/ just doesn't scan!!).

4. Lovers of Yiddish are unfortunately a dwindling group.  I'd prefer
that we keep Mendele open to contributions from all, whatever their
dialect or even limited grammatical abilities. There is much to be
learned from recollections, however faulty their transmission.

All that notwithstanding, to state that "anything goes" in Yiddish
spelling or grammar is as naive or disparaging as making that claim for
Italian or English or other languages.  Those who are interested in
Yiddish as more than just a vehicle for nostalgia should want to learn
its grammar and standard Romanization.  However, I realize that not all
Mendelniks are interested in doing so.

Historically, Jews have endured derogatory comments about their mame
loshn.  This is similar to the experience of many other minority language
communities.  However, in the aftermath of the Nazi and Soviet terrors
that eradicated Yiddish culture, it is much more painful when the
disrespect comes from fellow Jews, in particular the descendents of
Yiddish speakers.  These are not the arguments of Czernowitz, or even
early Zionism, over language and nationhood.  Like Israel in the UN,
Yiddish does not need to justify its existence or legitimacy, davka not
in Mendele.

I am grateful to the more fluent Mendelniks who routinely correct our
generic mistakes, and appreciate the opportunity to learn from those who
are more familiar with the language.  I urge them to continue; there's a
wealth of knowledge of Yiddish language and culture within our khevra
that needs to be disseminated. Mame loshn deserves our respect, but we
can honor it without alienating those who spell "Noyekh mit zibn grayzn"
or speak with an unabashedly Galitzianer accent.

Subject: Unkosher tomatoes in Poland

About 30 years ago (between 1964-1967), I read a monograph on an area of
Poland where the Rabbis declared the tomato (love fruit or pomme d'amour,
agvaniya in Hebrew, from agavim, love making) as not kosher.  This ban
lasted some two hundred years.  At the same time, according to this
article, the area of Poland was characterized by specialized
characteristics in its Yiddish.

As a non-linguist, I unconscionably forgot the details.

Could you good folks please point me to:

1] The name of the article, its reference and author;
2] The area of Poland under discussion;
3] The peculiar characteristics of the Yiddish of this area.

Subject: Milgroymen un mitsves

Jules Levin, in a discussion of "pomegranate", asks for the Yiddish of
"hand grenade".  Weinreich gives for "grenade" _der granat_; Harkavy has
_[di] granate_.  There is a charming tradition that pomegranates have 613
seeds, representing the _taryag mitsves_.

Subject: Code-Switching

This is for Heidi Shetzer. I'm not sure this is precisely what you're
looking for, but you will probably find it helpful and interesting. Try
an article called "A Defense of Yiddish in Old Yiddish Literature" by
Israel Zinberg. It's in Never Say Die (ed. J. Fishman, 1981). The article
is suggestive of Yiddish as an intentionally subversive force in
literature, secular and otherwise. There's also an article in the Fishman
edition, can't remember article's title, about a Yiddish study group and
the dynamics therein. Also try Deborah Tannen, "New York Jewish
Conversational Styles" (International Journal of Sociology of Language,
1981). Hope they help. Good hunting.
