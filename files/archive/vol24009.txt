1)----------------------------------------------------
Date: February 9
Subject: Shtot

Regarding the use of "shtot" to mean a seat in the synagogue:  it is unrelated to "shtot" meaning "city".  It is related rather to Ger. "Statt", meaning "place, abode" and appears also in "anshtot", "instead of, in place of".

Sholem Beinfeld

[Moderator’s note: Maurice Wolfthal concurs; Leyzer Gillig notes the English cognate "stead", as in "homestead" or "instead" (in place of).]


2)----------------------------------------------------
Date: February 10
Subject: Leksikon translations

FYI, readers of Mendele may be interested to know that translations of biographies from the Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur (8 vols.) have been appearing online at: yleksikon.blogspot.com

Translations are appearing in the order they appear in the original and are somewhere in the middle of "beys."

3)----------------------------------------------------
Date: February 16
Subject: OCR of the complete works of Sholem Aleichem

My OCR version of the complete works of Sholem Aleichem is now open for crowd-source editing. Please sign up to be an editor! 

The main web page is: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.cs.uky.edu_-7Eraphael_yiddish_searchSholem.cgi&d=AwIBAg&c=-dg2m7zWuuDZ0MUcV7Sdqw&r=hgSCSvtHqNOp40iT6T4uKyOHqvQreUPfVso-KO1Kgto&m=qb97WpC0MfVdsGbX93jggj0zI_IZ6i2WDk43gy-eOlc&s=hTmx4fnz7VBauVuJBdefvSUeU1GgIoVWgnL9Dg2HwJg&e= 

You can search through the collected works based on any word or phrase, in Yiddish letters. You can leave off marks (nekudes, the rofe line), in which case the search finds matches with any marks, or you can include them, to specify particular vowels/consonants. 

The result pages include a button that takes you to an editing page, which is entirely in Yiddish. At the top of that page is a link to instructions. You really need to read them if you want to edit a page. There are also a few unusual characters you might need to copy and paste into the corrected text. 

The editing page shows both the editable version as well as a version with hints. Hints in yellow are suggested fixes; if you click on one of them, the affected word is fixed in the editable version. Hints in red are unrecognized words that might need correction. You can also substitute a picture of the original text for the hints. 

At the bottom are buttons to update the hints and to submit the revision. Submission requires a user name and a password. You can also apply to be an editor at the bottom of the page. Until you are an approved editor, you can still play with the text, but submitting your edited version has no effect. 

Future work includes (1) providing a table of contents so you can go directly to a particular novel, story, article, or play, (2) allowing you to see more search results (going forward and backward in the search results), (3) listening to your suggestions and improving the website, (4) generalizing the tools to other bodies of Yiddish literature (suggestions?).

Subject: Joshua Fishman z"l

With great sadness I write to let you know that the great scholar and fighter for Yiddish, yidishkayt, and the preservation of our language and its culture Dr. Joshua Fishman passed away today. Baruch dayan emet, and all honor to his memory. At the request of his beloved wife and life-long partner Gella Schweid Fishman, I want to inform you that the funeral will most likely take place Tuesday morning and that all of the friends and admirers of Dr. Fishman, alev hasholem, are invited to join the family at the funeral. Details to follow. Please share this sad news with anyone else who ought to know. 

Ken Moss

Ghil'ad Zuckerman adds: The funeral will be held on Tuesday at 9:15 at the Hebrew Institute of Israel, 3700 Henry Hudson Parkway, New York.
