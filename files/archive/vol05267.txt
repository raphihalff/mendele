Subject: Non-Slavic Conference: Call for papers

The Department of Slavic Languages & Literatures and the Department of
Linguistics of the University of Chicago announce the Tenth International NSL
Conference (Non-Slavic Languages Conference, formerly the Conference on the
Non-Slavic Languages of the USSR), which will take place at the University of
Chicago, Thursday-Saturday, 8-10 May 1997. We solicit papers dealing with any
linguistic aspects of non-Slavic languages presently or historically spoken on
the territories of the successor states to USSR, i.e., the Baltic republics
and the member republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 30 minutes
will be allotted for presentation and discussion of each paper. Papers must be
presented in English. Funding permitting, we hope to publish papers presented
at the Conference. Those interested in participating should sent a one-page
abstract of their proposed paper to one of the addresses below. Faculty
members are particularly requested to encourage graduate students to submit
abstracts. Please send a copy of your abstract on a floppy disk (preferably
3.5" (90 mm.)) or, ideally, submit your abstract by e-mail. The deadline for
receipt of abstracts is 1 October 1996. You will be notified if your paper has

Subject: Khasidishe Yiddish

On a little lighter note than some of the more scholarly postings on
this subject, I have a couple of amusing stories relating to it.

1.  A friend of mine was walking on the street in the northern part of
    Jerusalem when a khosid pulled up beside him, unrolled the passenger-side
    window, and asked, "reb yid, zog zhe mir, vi kimt men ken rumis?"  When my
    friend recovered his composure, he picked himself up off the sidewalk and
    gave the khosid the desired directions to the nearby neighborhood of
    Ramot.

2.  Another friend recently related the story of a khosid giving someone
    directions.  "... un du makht men a yi."  Hint: it's a type of turn.

A freylikhn purim alemen.

Subject: Yerusholayim d'Lite

Tsirl Kuznitz inquired whether Yerushalayim d'Lite is being published. Yes, it
is and I receive it on a monthly basis.

I paid for my subscription in person last summer but certainly plan to renew
with a personal check.  I have had no problem sending personal checks in
American dollars to pay for services in Lithuania. (ex. research at the
Archives)

Hope this helps.

Subject: Yerusholayim d'Lita

"Yerusholayim d'Lita" resumed publication on a monthly basis in mid- 1995, in
4 separate versions.  The YIVO Library subscribes to the Yiddish and English
versions.  (The English one bears the title "Jerusalem of Lithuania.")  The
latest issue received was no. 2 (whole no. 62), February 1996.  The following
information is taken from that issue (English version):

"Jerusalem of Lithuania.  A newspaper of the Jewish community in Lithuania.
Published once a month in Yiddish, Lithuanian, Russian, and English.
Circulated in USA, Canada, England, Germany, Israel, Sweden, Poland, South
Africa, Australia, and other countries. Printed by the Spauda Printing House,
SL No. 314.  Address:  4, Pylimo Street, Vilnius, tel.:  22-79-17, 61-30-03,
fax (370-2) 227-915.  Price for a year is 50 USD."

We paid for our subscription with a U.S. dollar check, drawn on a regular U.S.
bank account, and that seems to have worked fine. Each issue is 4 pages in
length (tabloid format), and contains interesting articles on Jewish life in
present-day Lithuania and on Lithuanian Jewish history.
