Subject: openers

Harvey Varga asks about playful openers on greeting a fellow Jew.

My father-in-law's standard answer to "Vus makhstu?" is "Ikh makh zikh nisht
visn". (He's originally from a village outside Staszow, Poland.)

Subject: Openers: "me gult zich un me shert zich"

When asked "vus hert zich" the response expression was "me gult zich un me
shert zich und er vaxed aribber [or avider?]" to mean "we shave and we get a
haircut and it grows again". The "zich" of the question rhymed with the double
"zich" of the answer. In several languages the resopne to greetings is double
greetings. This is a typical circular maxim of men who have to shave, and by
the time they finish they have to shave again and again. It has in it an
Ecclesiastes taste, sort of: "The sun rises, and the sun sets--and glides back
to where it rises". Only men use the expression since only men shave their
face. I picked it up in Jerusalem somewhere in my childhood and I use it
regularly as an opener to a very light conversation. It tastes better then
"How do you do?" when you don't even wait to hear the answer.

Here are just some of the cute ways of answering the question 

Vos makhstu?

Ikh makh mit di zaytn.
Ikh makh zikh nit visndik.
Ikh makh a royshem.
Ikh makh a gutn ayndruk
Vos makht a yid? Fun a lebl an okraytshik.

Subject: openers

As an addition to the roster of quip-like rejoinders recalled by Harvey Varga
there is another response I remember to the greeting-- vos hert sich ?  This
depended on the alternative meaning of "hert sich"  to refer to olfactory
stimulation.  The answer was invariable -- tzibole.  Bleibt gesundt und kumts
weiter.

Subject: Vos hert zikh?

In response to Harvey Varga's request for some other crude or indelicate
responses to the question "Vos hert zikh?" that one asks when greeting
someone, how about "Fun alte fish es hert zikh!"

Subject: Kurve = Nafke???

I led a sheltered life.  Never heard the word "kurve."  In my neighborhood,
such women were referred to as a "nafke."  Not that I am THAT interested, but
is there a significant difference? 

The only one the comes to mind for me is a hoary old joke that works with
"nafke" but does not work with "kurve." 

        Well, when Mrs. Nafkewitz came to America, she changed
        her name to Mrs. Horowitz.

Roughly 5th grade humor, but hot stuff if you are a child and are trying to
figure out what words like that mean.

Subject: kurve, etymology and humour

I find attempts to give 'kurve' an Indo-European (let alone an Ugric) 
derivation unconvincing. Even Preobrazhensky, who does tentatively posit a
borrowing from OHG 'huora', admits that this fails to take account of the 'v'.
Six Mendelyaner have addressed this topic now and I am surprised that so far
no one has mentioned what I have always taken to be the origin, namely H/A
'kurbah' [kuf, vov, reysh, veyz, alef/ hey]. True, the gloss 'propinquity'
sounds too innocent, but when you take into account presumably ancient
phaseology of the type: "kurbah shel gilui 'arayot" and "shum kurba'
be'alma'", the case appears to be fairly well established. 
        
Whilst on the subject of etymology, isn't khaver Manaster Ramer [07.161:1] not
using a sledgehammer to crack a nut? I don't disagree with a word he says, but
so many paragraphs to argue that 'shlimazl' is not derived from Polish
'szlamazarny' and that 'shlemil/ Schlemiehl' remains problematic seems to be
overdoing things a little. As for the principles involved, all but the
wilfully fanciful must have taken the point by now. 
        
Satirical etymologies, meanwhile, such as [07.060:2] can be quite diverting at
times, but aren't they best reserved as an accompaniment to port and cigars
after high-table? It's a free world, of course, but isn't mendele's value
enhanced if we keep it succinct and to the point?  Futhermore there is no
small risk that a few ingenus will take such postings literally.

Eve Edelman Russ asks about a book about the Bund by Daniel Blatman. I don't
know whether it's been translated (it just came out, as far as I know), but
here's the bibliographical information:

Subject: mekayem-psak zayn

Thanks a lot to Mendy Fliegler for the suggestion about how to render this
complex verb (and to those who wrote to me privately).  Most of the
respondents assume it means 'to carry out the sentence', which does make
fairly good sense in the context.  Mendy's "a (horrid) deed (about) to come to
pass(?)" seems to me a little less viable.  But I must say I am far from
confidentabout this whole question. Could if for example be that it really
means simply (in this context) 'to beat up'?
