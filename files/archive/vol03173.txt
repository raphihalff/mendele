Subject: Tante/Mime//Onkl/Feter

Well, as long as the pot is boiling, I might as well stir it. ;> I
don't know how many Mendelnikes know this, but "Tante", "Muhme",
"Onkel", and "Vetter" (German spellings) are *all* German kinship
terms. There would be nothing particularly unusual about this,
except that in German "Vetter" and "Muhme" mean "cousin"! (I think
"Vetter" is usually, but not exclusively, male; I'm not sure about
"Muhme".) Anybody know how this shift in meaning came about?

Subject: gevezn vs. geven

Alice Honig gives a lovely criterion for judging authenticity of
usage, the folk song. As she points out, Bay ihre Rebbe iz gevezn a
ganayve. Ober layder Amol iz geven a mayse un dos mayse iz gor nisht
fraylakh. Got zay dank es hebt sikh on mit a Yiddishen meylakh, un
ot azoy kennen mir zen az es muz take zayer alt zayn.

Subject: century old yiddish

I think that we are all in general agreement that Yiddish by
definition is the language spoken by native speakers, particularly
those from the shtels whose dialects were not overly contaminated by
the ambiant goyish culture. The difficulty of course is how to
determine what the vocabulary of those people was. In fact there
can't be too great agreement on that point since the people
themselves didn't agree. There was clearly a continuous spectrum
from yekish Judeo-German (whose demise one should not gloat over) to
the heavily Slavic and Hebrew influenced dialects. As a guide to
what the newly arriving Yiddish immigrant community felt comfortable
with I turned to a century old English-Yiddish dictionary that I
inherited from my father and looked up several of the words that
have been subject to dispute and caviling. The dictionary is:

Complete English-Yiddish Dictionary  by Alexander Harkavy New York:
Hebrew Publishing Company  11th edition 1910 (first edition
copywrited 1892)

That this book was intended for native Yiddish speakers trying to
learn English becomes very evident when one sees that all the
English words are translitterated into Yiddish to enable the
immigrant to pronounce them (sort of the reverse of what we have
been doing here in Mendele). Selected entries (unfortunately
translitterated by me, but in the order as listed):

Wedding: hokhtsayt, khasene
Bridegroom: broytigam, khusn
Bride: broyt, kale
Uncle: onkl, feter
Aunt: mume, tante; shdkhnte (the latter is a new one for me)
Read: lezn    (note: leyenen is not even listed as an alternative!)
Pray: betn, betn got, davnen
Speak: redn, shprekhn; sogn

One can complain, scream nefarious conspiracy, etc., but in the end,
whether one likes it or not, a language is determined by what the
native speakers feel most comfortable with. And I believe that this
dictionary accurately reflects the feelings and practice of its
intended audiance.

On a personal note, both my parents were devout believers from
shtetln in the Russian Pale. My mother never went to school a day in
her life. She was taught how to read by my father, who was an
ordained Rabbi. The language spoken at home to me was Yiddish. The
speach they employed is very accurately described by the above list.
In their dialect men lezt bikhr, djurnalen, etc. ober men laynt
toyre. It is a distinction which I always found beautiful and
profound and I feel agrieved to find it condemned and denigrated by
ideologues with tin ears unable to hear the music of the
distinction.
