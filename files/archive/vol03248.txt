Subject: Klezmer group

I live in Indiana and am looking to form a klezmer group, at this
point just to get together and play for fun.  I play keyboard and
piano, and am currently learning mandolin.  Anyone in Indiana
(preferably close to W. Lafayette) can reply to me personally at
msavelev@mentor.cc.purdue.edu.  Thanks a lot!

Subject: Small correction to my transliteration scheme

In the transliteration scheme I recently posted, pasakh-tsvey_yudn
should map to ii__ , to distinguish it from plain tsvey_yudn, which
maps to ii .

Shalom un zayt mir ale gezunt,

Subject: re Feygele

The penis is a bird in German slang/vernacular, going far back.  To
go birding is to go out cruising (for girls, it used to be). The
penis as winged is a Roma n motif.  I bought one in bronze in
Venezia once, and wrote a poem about it whi ch can be found in my
3rd volume of poems, IN MEMORY OF THE FUTURE (kayak Press ,1976),
and it was published originally in THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR, as "ON A
WINGE D PHALLUS, ROMAN, BRONZE WITH BRONZE BALLS, THAT I GAVE TO MY
FRIEND, A TOKEN T O BE HUNG ON HIS KEY CHAIN."  As the book is
probably only to be found in (good ) libraries nowadays, I can scan
it it and upload it for the list, but this is a Yiddish list, and it
is a pagan poem, quite wonderfully ironic and glorious, a
celebration of heterosexual passion, and thus not germane to a query
[sic] ab out homosexuality.  I see nothing "distancing" about the
word homosexual or hom o for that matter, as distinct from hetero.
To call it medicalizing is to be t old what to say and how to think.
Medically, by the bye, medically speaking, I believe most of the
world will have noticed that in our time Gays of most kind s are ar
more often depressed and unhappy and angry, and not Gay at all, at
lea st in public.  It is hard not to find Gays even when represented
in theater by an expert like Terence McNally who are not deeply
unhappy persons, more unhappy , perhaps than the rest of the human
"race," if that is what we are.  "Feygele" is rather a term of
diminutive usage and compassionate and ironic and friendly rather.
The little bird that flies away, the penis, is nicely done in some
of Boccaccio as I recollect. It flies away and returns to nest, too.
Etc.  If Forw aaerts uses the old "puritanical" term of Homosexual
then indeed the language i s somewhat helped to have other versions
like "feygele," although the language in its richness of nuance and
perjoration, too, is being assaulted by those who will have all use
the terms they prefer, and those terms keep changing, as we h ave
seen since 1950 with the old word Negro, which has been buried under
a few strata of vogueish terms chosen and enforced by American
blacks, if not African s...Etc.  Old stuff.  I would prefer not to
have a word concocted for Yiddish b ecause it is desired as part of
the rectification of process of PCers.  Sue me.
