Subject: Yiddish and CAJE

Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan suggested contacting CAJE (the Coalition for
the Advancement of Jewish Education) concerning spreading Yiddish
[Vol 5.073].  CAJE has a Yiddish Network and we will be well represented
at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst for CAJE20 August 13 - 17th.
Persons living in the area can volunteer to help and thus receive free
admission for one day.  508-754-9017.

Sunday, August 13, 1pm to 4pm in Herter we will have our Yiddish
pre-conference session.  Our presenters will include Roslyn
Bresnick-Perry, nationally acclaimed storyteller and award winning author
for her book, _Coming to America_.  Roz also has two audio tapes out,
"Holiday Tales of a Shtetl Childhood" and "An American Girl."  Naomi
Kadar, national director of schools for the Workmen's Circle will suggest
resource help for teachers of Yiddish.  Henia (Henny) Lewin, just
returning from her Lithuania birth place will share some highlights
through a video of old Vilne(Vilnius) and new slides.  A teacher of
Yiddish and Hebrew at the University of Vermont, she will also instruct
us on the makings of a class/group of adult learners of Yiddish.  Michael
Bass will give us a preview of his workshop sharing program materials for
teaching Yiddish holiday songs. Jeffrey Aronofsky, director of Book
Collection and Distribution for the National Yiddish Book Center will
give us an update on the Center's building project and arrange a tour of
the Center's nearby facilities. Marcia Gruss Levinsohn, liaison to the
board will chair a brief meeting, show a film from YIVO about YIVO and
discuss YIVO's recently released archival finds from the Soviets.

Subject: More dialect transliteration

When I saw David Sherman's reaction (which I agree with 100%) to the
question about transliteration, I thought of a few things:

1. Solomon Birnbaum's complex transliteration (where you practically have
   to know which vowel in Middle High German went what way in Polish
   Yiddish, and then deconstruct the klal spelling. For example: nun
   komets-alef lange-khof represents a convergence in the klal shprakh of
   Polish Yiddish nokh (still) and nu(e)kh (after). He also names several
   different types of ayin: e, ey, y.


2. I couldn't resist the very first Yiddish joke I learned, ven ikh bin
   alt geven fertsn yor:

   A Litvak joins the army, and it's time to do rifle practice. Guns are
   blazing, and then the sergeant yells, "Cease fire!!" The Litvak
   proceeds to give a blast. The sergeant says, "Hey, don't you have
   ears, what did I say? The Litvak says, "You said, "Cease, fire," hob
   ikh gesosn!

Imagine what would happen if you tried to transliterate sabesdikn losn.
Hey, why not?

Subject: Yiddish in translation

I would like to offer an addendum to Marjorie Shonhaut Hirshan's comments
in Mendele 5.073.  I have just recently returned from a visit to a
Yiddishist friend in Los Angeles who told me about hearing on the radio
translations of Yiddish classics read by well-known actors.  This is a
project sponsored by the National Yiddish Book Center.  My friend was
surprised to hear me say that I was not favorably impressed by this
project because I felt it would detract from the effort of getting more
of us interested in learning Yiddish so that we can read these same works
in the original. (My bias is partly due to the fact that I have been a
zamler for the NYBC for over ten years, and I have sent it hundreds of
Yiddish books).  With respect to Hershl Hartman's comments in Mendele
5.075, I would like to see the supporting evidence for his statement:
"...the more knowledge of the riches of Yiddish literature and folklore
becomes widespread, the greater becomes interest in learning the Yiddish
language itself."
