Subject: Introduction

Hi all, it's time to introduce myself after reading Mendele for more than
a half year.  I'm a 22 year old goyishe student of math and computer
sciences.  I'm interested in Jewish culture and history (amatorial) and
therefore subscribed to Mendele to learn some yiddish.  (Some people told
me that I'm getting a strong accent, maybe that's from Mendele :-).  I'll
try to be a more active member of this very intriguing list from now on.

Subject: Introduction

Shole ale!

Mayn nome iz Johnny Mangaard un ich bin a lingvist (shtudent) who's
interested about Yiddish studies (I feel a bit insecure writing more in
Yiddish).

I've been working about ten years as a nursery school teacher but
recently have concentrated myself on linguistics.

Yiddish is known to me solely from Yidishe lider which I've heard some
twenty years. The only person I have spoken Mame-loshn with is librarian
at the Synagogue of Helsinki. My parents don't speak it (my dad speaks
nothing because he's dead).

Now a hopefully not too big request: if any one could aid me advising to
any Yiddish corpuses so I would welcome any help I can get.

Sheynen Dank!

david perlmutter, who i believe is lurking out there, has a very nice
paper on the subject:

Yiddish. Papers from the Milwaukee Morphology Meeting, April.

Subject: Diminutives/plurals in -ekh

I have no special knowledge of Yiddish or older German to solve the
question of diminutive plurals. First of all, I'd like to address the
question of -lekh vs. -lakh. These are regional variants; in Western
Yiddish you get -likh, with the kh pronounced close to sh. I have seen
criticisms of "YIVO Yiddish" as being too unrepresentative in its choice
of pronunciation. For example, if you totaled all living speakers of
Yiddish, the word meshuge would more commonly be pronounced meshige. I
believe that the language of culture developed by YIVO had a large base
in certain Lithuanian Yiddish (and Belorussian Yiddish, too) pronun-
ciations. But this is not the point of this posting, just an aside.

This kh plural exists in Yiddish today with diminutives, but not in
German. There are a group of collective nouns in both German and Yiddish
that end in this suffix. In German the guttural consonant has dropped and
there is only an "h". Unfortunately, the only one that comes to mind is
Vieh, which corresponds to the Yiddish Fikh; these words mean cattle,
beasts, etc. The other ones that I know of but can't remember also have
this same correspondence. It is a phoneme that is felt as plural. Many
German, mostly South German dialects have the -el, -le, -li, -lein
diminutive, but I am not aware of any guttural plural? The question I
raise is, if the kh in Fikh dropped out, could the -lekh/-lakh form be a
remnant of something plural that dropped out completely in German but
remained as a remnant in the diminutive plurals and the anomalous
collective nouns?

Subject: Diminutive plurals

In response to the questions about the vowel in forms like kneydlax,
kneydlex, I can only say that both are certainly attested, depending (I
THINK) on the dialect one speaks. I am sorry if I offended anyone by
using the form my informants use, which is from the Rzeszow area of
Poland.

Subject: To Catch a Typographical Error

          A.  As soon as I E-mailed my posting "Without Malice, but With
Goodwill Aforethought" (4.076,6) I realized that a typo slipped through
(satyrized for satirized) and promptly dispatched a plea to our Mendele
administrator to correct it.  In my message I added that he has carte
blanche to correct in the future any obvious spelling errors, and that I
shall be grateful.  In this case it was apparently too late, or it is
technically not possible to make any changes in an already E-mailed
missive.

          B.  I hastily composed in my mind the following  doggerel
(probably as a self-administered consolation):

When /y/ crept in
In place of /i/,
A glaring typo,
For all to eye,
I cried silently to my aching "I"--
Ay... Ay... Ay...

          C.  Thanks to my Mendele sister Ellen F. Prince and to my
Mendele brother Seymour Axelrod for their timely pointing out my
oversight.

          D.  David-Neal Miller improves my spelling "khaveirim" to the
standard khaveyrim, for which I thank him, but he erroneously titles his
subject "Khaveyrish."  The adjective is formed from the singular, not
from the plural.  It must therefore be "kha'verish" (Uriel Weinreich) or
"kha'verlikh" (Alexander Harkavy, l988 reprint of the l928 edition).

Subject: Dov Noy

Harvey Spiro in Mendele Vol. 4.072 asks whether Dov Noy has published in
English.  He did his Ph.D. at Indiana U. (where once I taught), in 1954,
if I am not mistaken.  I would be surprised if he has no English
publications.  Try a library search, Aleph for example.  The Hebrew
University Library lists 40 items, more than half in English, with some
French and Hebrew.

Sorry for the delay in response; hospital time interfered with any hope
of promptness.
