Subject: Chaver Paver's Labzig

Harold Orbach asks in Mendele 07.179 about "Lobzig" the dog, stories, by
Chaver Paver.  I have a copy of the sequel to the original Labzig book, by
Chaver Paver.  It is called "Labzig" (Book 2): Nokh mayselekh vegn klugn
hintele Labzig."  It was published in New York in 1937 by the Co-operative
Folks Farlag. Both books are probably available from The National Yiddish
Book
Center in Amherst, Massachusetts.

Subject: Chaver Paver

Harold Orbach asks about Chaver Paver and his writings.  I have a lovely
copy
in Yiddish of his "Vovik"--a story about a clever, charming dog.  The book
is
illustrated by Moses Soyer and was published in 1947 in Los Angeles.
Chaver
Paver wrote, as Harold said, in the Freiheit and elsewhere.  His name was
Gershon Einbinder.  I have another volume called, "Zalmen der Shuster,"
not a
children's book, but chapters in the life of Zalmen (Chaver Paver).  It was
published in 1955, inscribed to S. Miller by Chaver Paver himself.  What I'd
like to do (or see someone else do) is translate the books into publishable
English.  Suggestions for a publisher, anyone?

Subject: Chaver Paver

Khaver Orbach's ear has served him well.  "Chaver Paver" was the pen
name of
Gershon Einbinder (Bershad, Bessarabia, 1901- Los Angeles, 1964 - his
son
Michael and I attended the same shule).  He wrote for children and adults.
The National Yiddish Book Center has some of his books in Yiddish, as
well as
a YKUF-published translation of a number of his stories entitled "'Clinton
Street' and Other Stories" (it only contains two Lobzik stories, though).  I
imagine other mendelyaner (Hershl Hartman?) could give more extensive
information.

Subject: ladies

Sean Martin's inquiry about the use of "ladies" by an American Yiddish
speaking Socialist organization evoked memories of Bieletzerkover Branch
541
of the Arbeter Ring in Chicago which was the center of a good part of the
lives of my parents.  It met Sean Martin's criteria. 

It was Socialist. (Well sort of. Thay all voted for Franklin Roosevelt and not
Norman Thomas). 

It was Yiddish speaking. (Well sort of)

And it had as an integral part of its being "The Ladies Auxiliary of Branch
541" 

At events where food was to be served the responsibiliy tended to to be
tossed
to "Di Veiber" An additional synonym (well sort of) to Sean Martin's list.

Subject: Ladies?

Sean Andrew Martin asks about words used to address women in Yiddish
socialist
circles in the 1920's and 1930's. The all-purpose English "comrade"
corresponds to "khaver"(masc), "khaverte"(fem); and the plural "comrades"
becomes "khaverim" and "khavertes." The garment shop forelady was a
different
kettle of fish entirely.

Subject: A real Yiddish keyboard

Many Mendelistn, myself included, yearn for the day when we can
routinely send
and read posts written in Yiddish.  But though that day isn't here yet,
things
are getting easier for those who want access to a Yiddish keyboard. 

I've worked with a trial copy of QText 8.0, a Yiddish word processor by
Dvir
Software for a couple of weeks, and more recently I installed the
commercial
version. It works very well in English and Yiddish (it also offers French,
German, Russian and just about every other European keyboard) and I
recommend
it to my fellow-Mendelists.  Not only does it offer all of the special Yiddish
characters, not only is font-and-direction shift simple, it also enables
users
to mail and fax documents.  Owners of QText can thus write to one
another in
mame-loshn as simply as they've been able to do in English.

There are other features as well, including HTML, sketching and matters
that
are far beyond my feeble understanding.  No matter. What counts is the
Yiddish. 

At this point I think a word of thanks is due our Meyer David who has
devoted
a tremendous amount of time and energy to persuading software firms
(including
Dvir) and anyone else who will listen to provide us with a real Yiddish
keyboard.  The adage about water wearing away rock fits perfectly the way
that
gentle soul has worn down inertia and opposition. 

But Mendele has more than one hero.  Here's another. 

Learning a new keyboard for those of us who've been weaned on Roman
or
Cyrillic is not much fun.  And correct Yiddish spelling isn't always a
straightforward affair.  So for those who hesitate to learn, our esteemed
Refoyl Finkel has come up with a wonderful solution which links his
famous
Yiddish Typewriter up with QText. 

Suppose, for instance, that you're writing a document in English (or
Russian)
and want to switch to Yiddish.  If you're working in a Windows
environment and
connected to the Internet, bring up the Yiddish Typewriter by setting the
browser to: 

http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/yiddish/makeyiddish.html

and compose the text in transcribed Yiddish.  When you're through, click
the
button that reads "QText Hebrew".  The result is a mess of coded symbols.
Copy in the usual way, then switch back to the QText document and paste.
And
there in the document is the Yiddish equivalent, complete with vowel
markings
and special characters, of what you had written in transcribed form. 

You can try it out for yourselves by downloading a 30-day trial copy from
Dvir
(http://www.qtext.com), and can buy it at an attractive price from Meyer
David's new Yiddish Voice bookstore (http://www.yv.org).  (I have no
hesitation in mentioning this since the proceeds go to producing his lively
Yiddish radio program _Dos Yidishe Kol_.)

I mostly try to speak in positive terms -- espcially to our dear
mendelyaner.
but from time to time i lose patience over one subject -- and that is the
subject of learning to read the yiddish alphabet. people are looking for
special dictionaries in transliteration - they do gyrations in order to avoid
the necessity of learning a little aleph beyz. in short, what's the big deal?
an hour a day -- and in 3-4 weeks, it's no longer a problem. 

come on guys, have a little respect for mameloshn. it's worth the little
effort to learn the alphabet -- such a large part is purely phonetic, and
the
hebraisms, little by little, they will also become familiar. 

there are enough textbooks around, old ones, new ones that come out
from time
to time. And classes, certainly. Yiddish literacy is the key to the pleasure
of direct contact with our great writers, poets and journalists.  in the
romanized texts you lose the contact with the shoresh (roots) words on
the
hebraisms -- which means, the translation is often innacurate. 

sometimes i simply think that people are too lazy to learn the alef-beyz. 
it's not really major hard work. while there may be a practicality to writing
in translit over mendele,mendelyaner who profess a love of mameloshn
should
really be able to read yiddish.

Subject: oder/bruder and barnyard linguistics

Bob Rothstein (#07.177) is right to query the cooccurrence of _uder_ (the
month) and _bruder_. At best it's poetic licence. It doesn't happen in the
real world. We find three cooccurrences: 1. NEY ("Litvish")
_oder_/_bruder_,
2. SY (Poland & S. Ukraine) _u(:)der_/bri:der_, or 3.Belorus-Northern
Ukraine
and Polish-Lithuanian border area _oder_/_bri:der_. NO *Uder/*brUder!! 

Obviously, nothing is impossible, as witness the fact that Bob cites the
rhyme. However, the consequence of a merger of the two vowels in
question
would be a disaster for farmers, fowl, and Jewish housewives alike:  A
Yiddish
dialect which failed to distinguish _oder_ (the month) and _bruder_, would
be
unable to differentiate the rooster (_hon_) from the hen (_hun_).  emerged
before SY _hi:n_ 'hen'. 

The problem of _hon_ and _hun_ in Yiddish, the problem of the French
'rooster'
(& 'vicar') about which so much has been written (cf. Gillieron, Bloomfield,
Martinet?), and a similar problem in Hungarian (whose details escape me),
together constitute the nascent field of "barnyard linguistics". Other
contributions will be welcomed.

Subject: [eyf] = "oyf"

The libavitsher rebe (Lubavitcher Rebbe) and other Yiddish-speakers of
White
Russian origin (where I mean "deep" W.R., not the border with Poland or
Ukraine) use(d) [eyf] for prepositional "oyf".  Is it only in "careful
speech," i.e. in rhetorical/literary/official style?  What's the form of the
"converb"?  (Might it be [uyf]?  This is just a guess.)
