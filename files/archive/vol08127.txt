The word "farfast" comes from the German "verfassen"  meaning "to compose".

Subject: farfast

the Yiddish word "farfast" is the past participle of "farfasn"  from modern
German "verfassen" (to write, to indite, to author).  Though Yiddish purists
may deplore this modern borrowing, it nevertheless has to be dealt with by
readers.  Both the Yiddish and the German verb mean "to write, to author,"
etc.' but the German verb also means "to compose music, to set words to
music"--a sense that I've never found in Yiddish--but who knows?
(Incidentally, in the nineteenth century, German "verfassen" also meant "to
edit, to compile texts"--a meaning that is now totally archaic.") 
        
There is also a major distinction between the German noun "Verfasser" and
the Yiddish noun "farfaser":  in German you have to be a "Verfasser" of
something stated or implied--you can't just be a mere "Verfasser" (by trade,
etc.).  By contrast, the Yiddish noun "farfaser"  can stand by itself--as a
practitioner of the profession of writing:  "er iz a farfaser"--"he's a
writer, an author...."  In fact, there's a story by Yankev Gordin titled
"Berl der Farfaser farn Bezdn-shel-mayle"--"Berl the Writer before the
Celestial Court." 
        
Such a usage of "Verfasser" would be ungrammatical in German (which would
actually employ "Autor" or "Schriftsteller" in that context.)  The added
Yiddish meaning also confirms that every borrowing, no matter how repugnant
to purists, has to be examined in terms of both style and usage.

An entfer zu Avremele Walter:

Farfasn is shraybn. Ir hot a toes. In dem zaytl 471 fun Uriel Weireich's
vertebukh hot ir nit gut geleyent. Dos vort vos shteyt gedrukt is FARFASTN,
un nit FARFASN. Farfastn is take esn farn fastn. Ober in di kumendike shure
leyentmen FARFASER: ZEN MEKHABER. Dos is dos rikhtike shlisl tzu ayer frage! 

An answer to Avremele Walter:
Farfasn means to write. You have not read correctly what is in the page 471
form Uriel Weinreich=B4s dictionary. There is no FARFASN but FARFASTN, which
really means the last meal before fasting. But on the coming line there is
FARFASER: SEE MEKHABER (writer), and that's the key of your question! 

Mit derekh-erets (with respect)

Re farfast, in response to Avreml Walter's question:
In German, verfasser = author.  (Pronounced ferfasser).  In Yiddish,
farfaser, for author, is labeled "inadmissible in the standard language" by
Weinreich.  The word he approves of is mekhaber.

Subject: Di Tannaim hobn "farfast" di Mishna

Re: Avreml Walters recent query:

It sounds like "farfast" means "compiled" in this context.  I was recently
reading about the Tannaim and they did, indeed, compile the rules of conduct
that are the Mishna. 

Weinreich lists "farfasser" as "mekhaber" which means "author," and
"mekhaber zayn" as "to author" or "compile."

In response to Andrew Walters' inquiry about the term FARFAST, -- it's a
legitimate Yiddish word in frequent usage, meaning "authored" or "composed". 
Generally it appears more often as a noun -- FARFASER. The fact that
Weinreich does not include it, does not detract from the place of the term
in the Yiddish language.  Dovid Katz in his authoritative volume on Yiddish
stylistics, lists about 500 kosher Yiddish words which have been proscribed
by Weinrich.  The term is found in what is still regarded as the best
dictionary -- the 1925 edition of Alexander Harkavy's Yiddish-English Hebrew
Dictionary which was republished by YIVO a few years ago.  By the way, there
is a typographical error in the word as it appears in Harkavy, with a second
alef letter instead of a resh. It is also included in the English-Yiddish
Encyclopedic Dictionary of Paul Abelson published in 1915 (1748 pages!)
