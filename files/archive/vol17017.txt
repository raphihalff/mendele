Subject: Yidishe kultur

For a collection on yizker books that I am editing, I want to translate and
reprint a 1964 article written by Beryl Mark that was published in the
journal "Yidishe kultur." The journal is no longer published because the
editor Itche Goldberg died. Does anyone know who owns the copyrights to the
journal? Thanks for your help.

Subject: Plant and remedy names

Does anyone know the Yiddish names for these plants: cornflowers, yellow
poppies, coltsfoot, horse elder?

Also, does anyone know anything about remedies (folk or other) that were
used in Poland for the dreaded fungal infection of the scalp, parkh?

Many thanks,
Margie Newman

Great news! A major crater on the planet Mercury has been named for our
classic Yiddish author!

Subject: spelling on gravestone

I just received a query from a woman who is erecting her mother's
gravestone and would like to figure out the most authentic spelling for her
maternal grandfather's name. He was called Avrum. She wonders whether in
Ukraine a hundred years ago, it was more likely that his name would have
been spelled the Yiddish way (alef beys resh vov shlos-mem) or the Hebrew
way for official functions (such as an aliye to the Torah). She noted that
her father-in-law's stone in Jerusalem reads Yosl and not Yosef (but his
family is from Pinsk, Poland).

Any idea what the custom would have been for Jewry in Ukraine at that time?

Many thanks,
Miriam Udel-Lambert

Subject: Avrom Reisen's "Chasing after Villa"

I am working on an annotated bibliography of Yiddish short stories in
English translation - not all stories, but those that convey humanistic
values. This is a revision of an early work--a pamphlet titled A Yiddish
Short Story Sampler ---that was published in 1997 by the Congress of
Secular Jewish Organizations.

One of the Avrom Reisen stories I selected is "Chasing After Villa" (as in
Pancho Villa, the Mexican revolutionary), which appears in Max Rosenfeld's
"Pushcarts and Dreamers." Does anyone know the Yiddish title and source of
this story?

Subject: recording of "Rozhinkes mit mandlen"

Re: Richard Goldenberg's comments in the current review about Golfaden's
songs, if it is of any interest, I have an old LP issued in London, UK by
Simcha Records titled "Rozhinkes mit mandlen" sung by the Jewish People's
Chorus of New York conducted by Maurice Rauch.

Subject: European Jewish populations

The second largest Jewish population in Europe after France is found not in
Germany but in the UK - at 300,000, half as large again as Germany's. My
mother, a Berlin-born Manasseh whose family left Germany in 1932, was one
of those to profit from the fact that the Nazis never made it to Britain.

Sincerely,
Mark Glanville

Subject: bartyarn

I'm doing research on a Yiddish documentary short film from 1939 about
"Jewish life in Lwow." In this film the expression "bartyarn" shows up. As
far as I know, they are street boys typical of Lwow, but I would be very
pleased if somebody would offer a more detailed definition on them.

Thanks a lot,
Viola Hoell

Subject: Rosetta Stone in Yiddish?

I purchased Rosetta Stone Hebrew to help my daughter in school, but learned
that the company has no Yiddish program. Why? Because it needs an
organization to sponsor the project to ensure that the translations are
correct. Do you know whom I might be able to contact to get them in touch
with Rosetta Stone and make Yiddish the 71st language it teaches?
