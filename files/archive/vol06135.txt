Subject: Please

in der diskusye vegn 'pliz' hot keyner nit dermont an oysdruk vos bay
undz in der heym, ubifrat bay mayn boben (oleasholem) is dos geven
geveyntlekh, dehayne: zay (zayt) zikh matriekh.  Dos afile tsu ire
eygene zin un tekhter, ober nit tsu undz eyniklekh.

In the discussion about 'please' in Yiddish there was no mention of the
expression 'zay (zayt) zikh matriekh' which was very common in our
house, used especially by my grandmother (born ca. 1865) even to her own
children, but not to us, the grandchildren.

List of Where Essays Appeared Originally
Index of Persons
Index of Works

An indexed collection of nineteen Hebrew essays published in various
journals and books in the past two decades, this book is important for
students of Yiddish language and literature.  It deserves reviewing and
discussion in _Mendele_.  Though my principal purpose here is to draw it
to the attention of Mendelyaner, I cannot resist pointing to a certain
tension between the book's Hebrew title, its dedication to Dov Sadan
(who with Sh. Niger taught us to speak of "one literature in two
languages"), the book's fundamental purpose and its actual content --
and the English title page.  Note:  _From Language to Language: Literary
Works and their Transformations in Our Literature_. _Our_ literature.
Note:  "In memory of Dov Sadan who explored and tested the vision of
multi-lingualism in our literature."  _Our_ literature.  English title:
_From Language to Language; Literary Works and their Transformation in
Hebrew Literature_. _Hebrew_ literature.

We are of course all of us aware of discrepancies and disjunctures
between "Jewish" and "Israeli" perspectives.  In all fairness, too, we
should keep in mind that the English title pages of Hebrew books are
often amateurishly prepared and are not necessarily the words of the
authors themselves.  Yet the use of "Hebrew" for "our"/"Jewish" in the
present instance seems more than a casual slip.

Subject: Young readers of Peretz

With reference to Morrie Feller's citation [6.134] of Wisse's citation
of Bashevis' reference to Peretz' readers [khad gadyo, khad gadyo ;-) ],
I truly wonder what dictionary those readers may have been using.
Anyone have any thoughts (or believe Bashevis)?
