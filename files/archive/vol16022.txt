Subject: Yiddish audio stories

In response to the request by Michael Rener in Mendele 16.020, audio
Yiddish can be found in Leonard Prager's "World of Yiddish." The best way
to access this site is to go to www.derbay.org and, after opening it up,
click on "Yiddish links." Scrolling down will bring up Prager's "World of
Yiddish." There are many other Yiddish links listed there, and some of them
may include audio Yiddish.

Subject: Yiddish audio stories

In Mendele (Vol. 16.020) Michel Rener inquires about readings of Yiddish
literature on the net. Though I cannot give any answer to that, I'd like to
say that, being fully blind from birth, I am equally interested in this
subject. Meanwhile, I love to listen to the Yiddish Voice (www.yv.org).
Great interviews, music, and also occasionally excerpts of books are read.

As one who is visually impaired, I know what it means not to be able to
read easily or not at all.

[For Yiddish audio stories] contact Pearl Lam at the Jewish Braille
Institute in New York City at plam@jbilibrary.org.

I hope someone responds to Michel Rener's post and at least tells him about
this site:  <http://yiddish.haifa.ac.il/Stories.html>

Subject: Yiddish audio stories

In Mendele Vol.16.020, Michael Rener asks about internet sites from which
he can download stories in Yiddish for his Yiddish-speaking grandfather who
can no longer see well enough to read. A good site is
http://yiddish.haifa.ac.il/Stories.html, which has an excellent selection
of stories read aloud. A useful site is also that of "The Yiddish Voice" at
www.yv.org, which has many links to online Yiddish audio material,
including regular radio programs.  And for more stories read aloud, click
on their link (in their section "Other Interesting Internet Audio Sites")
to the National Yiddish Book Center's Audio Library, which has a few more
stories. A good weekly Yiddish radio program is that of "The Yiddish Hour."
They have a weekly broadcast, and an archive of their past radio broadcasts
is available at www.yiddish.forward.com/oldarchive/radio/old.html.

Subject: opinion sought about book about IB Singer

Khaveyrim,

I came across an unusual title today, one which I can't find in any of the
local library databases, nor can I find reviews of it by googling.  So, I'm
wondering if any of you are familiar with it or have any thoughts about
whether it is worth pursuing.

Here is the publisher's description:

Qiao, Guo Qiang The Jewishness of Isaac Bashevis Singer Oxford, Bern,
Berlin, Bruxelles, Frankfurt/M., New York, Wien, 2003. 272 pp. ISBN
978-3-906769-74-5 / US-ISBN 978-0-8204-5911-0 pb. Order online:
www.peterlang.com US-$ 51.95

This book explores Jewishness in the writings of Isaac Bashevis Singer. The
author makes a close examination of Singer's literary works, Judaism,
Jewish history and related criticism to illustrate Singer's unique but
ambiguous position in American Jewish literature. The book offers a
discussion of Singer's modernity. Singer's Jewishness finds its major
expression in challenging the notion of covenant and the concept of the
coming modern consciousness of Spinoza's philosophy. The book also focuses
on Singer's representation of Jewish assimilation in the past and present,
both in Poland and in America and on the de-Americanization of the
Holocaust.

After an examination of Singer's narrative strategies, the author also
discusses the similarities and diversities of four major American Jewish
writers, Singer, Bellow, Malamud and Roth, in terms of Jewish identity and
Jewish historical consciousness.

Contents: Isaac Bashevis Singer's Ambivalent Modernity Assimilation: An
Ineffable Tribulation De-Americanization of the Holocaust or, Indelible
Shadows on the Jews Narrating Jewishness - Isaac B. Singer and His Jewish
Contemporaries.

The author, Guo Qiang Qiao, was born in Qingdao, China. He obtained his BA
from Qufu Normal University, his M.A. from Shandong University and his
Ph.D. from the University of Nottingham (UK). He is professor of American
Literature at Shanghai University.

A dank!

Subject:

I am looking for the name of the Yiddish lyricist of "Der gasn-zinger."

The song begins as follows:

"Orem, elend bin ikh geblibn On a tatn, mamen, on a heym."

And the chorus is

"Oys iz oys milyonen
A kabtsn bin ikh tsurik
Oys iz oys milyonen
farloyrn hob ikh dos glik

A gasn-zinger
bin ikh elend aleyn
tsulib a froy bin ikh gekumen tsu dem broyt"

This song has the music of the Polish tango "Przy kominku" ("By the
Chimney") by Artur Gold. It's *not* the song from "Der komedyant," as sung
by Peysakhke Burstein.

Many thanks in advance!

Subject: Curses

A few question about Jewish curses:

1.) What is the literal meaning of "a khalatshke"?  I've heard it spoken in
the spirit of, "Oh, Hell," "darn it," etc., when a person broke or spilled
or dropped something.  But its literal meaning....? Is it a diminutive of
"khalerye"?

2.) Is there a decipherable logic in the phrase "fardrey dayn kop un meyn
az dos is mayner" ... literally "Turn (twist) your head and
suppose/consider/think that it's mine."  (This said to a child in the
spirit of "Stop bothering me" or "Don't be such a pest.") Is the child
being invited, ironically, to suppose and take satisfaction from the
transfer of his perverse head to his mother?

3.)  Almost all the Yiddish curses I heard in my boyhood home, 75 years
ago, had to do with what we felt were clean matters, like plague and fire.
Until just recently, I thought that my parents had never uttered "dirty"
curses, in the Anglo Saxon style, that had to do above all with sex and
excretion. So it was hard for me to accept the literal translation I
obtained just recently of a curse I had heard now and then, many years ago,
from my mother's lips: "Geh' kerbenye matri" [Moderator: k benya mat'] =
"Go fuck your mother." In the context in which it was spoken, we kids took
the phrase to mean something as innocent as "Go to Hell!" or some 1930's
equivalent of "Bug off!"

Because this curse was so out of character (Boiling anger: yes. But lewd
remarks? Never!), I have wondered if my mother actually knew the literal
meaning of that curse.  No other curse she uttered went anywhere near that
territory.  Is it possible that having grown up as a girl in the restricted
life of her shtetl, where Yiddish was overwhelmingly the language of daily
encounter and worldly education didn't enter in, her knowledge of Russian
could have been so meager that she didn't know the meaning of the Russian
word "kerbenye?" And that she spoke it with ignorance the equal of ours,
when we took the phrase to mean "Go be a pest somewhere else!"

A last question now, on a different matter.   Is there a Yiddish saying
"Truth comes in blows" that preexists Ted Solotaroff's use of that phrase
as the title for his memoir? I suspect that the phrase is Solotaroff's own
creation, but would like to know if there is contrary evidence about that.
