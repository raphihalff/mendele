Subject: diklekh

Does this simply mean "plumpish", "rather plump", or is there something else to this?
"Der rov hot gehat a hadras-ponem, a diklekher, mit a sheerer groylekher bord, fun niderikn vuks ...."

Subject: Goldfaden's "Vayzuso"

The Mayrent Institute for Yiddish Culture is excited to share a recording from its recently-acquired collection of Thomas Lambert Company recordings. These cylinders, issued between 1901 and 1903, represent the earliest known recordings of Yiddish music.

To listen to a recording of Abraham Goldfaden's "Vayzuso," from the composer's 1885 opera Akheshverus (or Queen Esther: Biblical Operetta in Five Acts and 15 Scenes), please visit our recent blog post at http://mayrentinstitute.wisc.edu/vayzuso/.

Date: September 21
Subject: opshikn dem khoyv

This is from  a yizkor book (memorial book) for a town in Poland:

The rabbi of the town sends his children out to distribute money and food to those who don’t have enough to celebrate Shabbos.  He tells his children to say, “Der tate hot aykh opgeshikt dem khoyv”.

Perhaps it means “Father has sent you the means to fulfill your Shabbos obligation.”  Or does it mean “Father has fulfilled his obligation by sending this to you’”?  Or something else entirely?  All suggestions will be much appreciated.

Subject: anger/rage

khaveyrim -

i'm looking for a little help with the semantics of anger and rage.

basically trying to understand the differences of tone and texture among "beyz", "roygez/rugze", and "kas", and trying to see whether one of them (or another word entirely) comes close to the connotation of  /healthy, righteous anger/  that english "rage" can carry...

any help, whether from the literary side, the family-usage side, or the formal linguistic side, would be very much appreciated!

a sheynem dank,

rozele

Subject: Yiddish translations of Bialik

I would be very grateful for any information of Yiddish translations of H.N. Bialik's Hebrew poems "metey midbar" & "metey midbar ha-ahronim". Please, if possible indicate dates and publication details, but even more fragmentary information would be very welcome.

Thank you,

Subject: Nehemiah Persoff

About 25 years ago, Nehemiah Persoff was doing a one man play about Sholem
Aleichem.  Has anyone ever seen a script.  Or is there any written work
associated with the play.
