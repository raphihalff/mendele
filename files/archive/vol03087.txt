Subject: Shnipishok and Zachary Baker

  I take it that Baker's Snipiskis = Sutzkever's (in Harshav's
introduction to his translations) Snipishok,= my and Rick Turkel's
Shnipishok. The interesting question now is why Shnipishok acquired
these associations - because of  how it sounded (i.e.odd,funny
somehow, like 'Oshkosh' in English), other associations of the name
(i.e., like 'Hicksville'), or for some association - historical,
ethnographic - of this 'suburb of Vilna'. Same question for
Bitshutsh/Patshutsh.

Subject: grobian

this is in response to ellen's question about the stress on the
german "grobian".  it's on the first syllable, as you'd expect in a
good germanic word, and the "i", though completely stressless, is
not reduced to a glide.

Subject: GrubYAN

Ellen objected to -yan in grubyan being a suffix, because it takes
the stress in the word.  Is this a general principle in languages,
or in Indo-European languages?

Somebody else pointed out that pejorative suffixes in yiddish take
the stress.  It occurs to me that in Spanish, e.g. the suffix -on,
which is frequently used for pejorative effect (ladron=robber,
chingon) takes the stress, contrary to other words ending in -n.  Is
_this_ a general principle (in Indo-European languages, or some
subset thereof?)

Ellen F. Prince asks towards the end:

>stressed. anyone know? a dank.

I telephoned my mother and she confirmed what I had thought.  In
German it is GROBian, i.e. stress on the first syllable.

[1] "Nissen" Goldberg shraybt [Mendele Vol 3.080]:

e. Our chorus has been pronouncing the "oyfn" in "oyfn pripitshik"
   as written, instead of as "afn".  I tried to get them to change,
------------

This is a of course a 'problem' in written yiddish to anyone who
doesn't speak the language. By the way, until YIVO 'standardized'
did anyone ever pronounce the word as =oyf= . All the litvaks I know
say =af= and everyone else says =of=

[2] According to several contributors, YIVO transcription can handle
all dialects . Beats me. The 'ou' sound in Southern pronunciation is
un-writabe in this transcription, as far as I can see. Worse still,
there is no provision for long vowels.

[3] Khaim bochner [Mendele Vol 3.086]:

>Reforming this was a big battle, and it still hasn't been won
>completely: daytshmerish silent heys still appear in words like
>"yohr" in modern khsidishe kinder-bikher.

Maybe: but it's a lot easier for a novice to recognise a long vowel
with a 'hey' as a marker. So, daytshmerish or not, it's practical.

>So it wasn't necessarily litvish chauvinism that resulted in the

>Yiddish origins of Yiddish literature?

I didn't think @gut@ was ever -spelt- other than giml-vov-tes. But
of course mlupm is mostly pronounced -i- in Southern yiddish, so
where is the problem?
