Subject: petsha

Here's a recipe that is very similar to the way my grandmother (from
Romania) prepared petsha:

2 calves' feet, cleaned and sawed to fit pot.
Cold water to cover
1 onion
1 clove garlic
3 bay leaves
1 tsp. peppercorns (optional)
salt to taste
2 TBS lemon juice or 1/2 cup vinegar
3 hard cooked eggs, sliced
Sliced lemon for garnish or parsley


Cook feet in water 10 minutes. Skim and add onion, garlic, bay leaves,
peppercorns. Cook over reduced heat for 1 hour. Skim again. Simmer for 2
hours or till bones stand away from gristle and meat. Strain. Cut usable
meat and gristle into fine cubes. Add to strained liquid. Taste and add
salt if necessary. Add vinegar. Cook 5 minutes after bringing to a quick
boil.  Turn into an oblong glass dish about 2 inches in depth. Let cool
until partly jelled.

Place some egg slices on the top and stand remaining egg slices upright
inside the dish along the sides. Chill in refrigerator. When completely
jelled and firm to the touch, unmold on serving plate. Cut into squares if
desired. Garnish with parsley and/or lemon. Chicory, shredded lettuce or
watercress make a nice base on which to serve this as an appetizer. Serves
4 to 6.

Subject: petsha

I'm afraid I can add nothing of a culinary nature. In fact, I'm not sure
that I want to hear much more on this topic, so much does it turn my
stomach over.  However, I can perhaps make a small contribution concerning
the etymology of "fusnoge." I remember Mikhl Herzog mentioning in
conversation many years ago that there exists an interesting lexical
disambiguation-phenomenon which seems to adopt the style of taytsh-loshn.
It replaces Hebrew/ Yiddish (as in 'khamer-eysl') with Yiddish/Slavic, so
that it is now the Slavic term which is used to gloss the Yiddish where a
possibility of confusion might exist. In sabesdiker-losn-territory [s] and
[sh] are collapsed and both are realized as the voiceless alveo-palatal
fricative heard, for example, in Polish slubowanie [kindly imagine an 
acute
accent on the s] or in Castillian las agues. Furthermore, as is very
well-known, in the entire CY area vov is articulated as [i]. Now, where
these two areas overlap, as they just do in and around the valleys of the
Narew and (zachodni) Bug, fus and fish will sound identical [see LCAAJ 
maps
34 & 65]. Since fus (in this special sense) and 'fish' are both
comestibles, confusion is possible, and so people became accustomed to
disambiguate by saying either fisnuge or fisribe, using the Polish or
Belarusian terms for foot and fish respectively [It is important in this
context not to say anachronistically Russian]. Once the term fisnuge had
established itself for this "delicacy" in this particular dialect area, it
was adopted in other areas with the appropriate dialect realization, in
klal-yidish therefore "fusnoge." If I am not mistaken, Prof. Herzog
mentioned other instances of this same disambiguation feature, but I can
neither remember nor find any mention of this phenomenon in his "The
Yiddish Language in Northern Poland." Perhaps he would care to comment
himself.

Subject: mir/fatsheyle/fusnoge

1) mir/wir:
In Yiddish dialects, there is fluctuation too, between mir, indz and me. 
My
favorite example is from the Maurice Schwartz film "Tevye" (although most
of the dialogue is lifted directly from Sholom Aleichem, I don't think 
this
particular bit is), when Tevye encounters the three rich women along the
road.  The oldest of the three explains to Tevye why they're wandering
around:  "Mir zenen damen fin Yehupets ... indz ze'mir aroysgegangen af a
minitkele shpatsirn in me'ze'mir farblondzhet gevorn.  In others words,
three different equivalents for 'we are' in one speech!

2) "fatsheyle":
According to Max Weinreich, the word is probably of Romance origin. The
etymology that is usually proferred is Italian "fazzoletto."

3) "petsha":
"Fisnoge" is not a "compound of German and Russian words for foot," but of
the Yiddish word for "foot" with one of the Slavic words, most likely
Polish. A Yiddish word like "fus" is a Yiddish word, not a German word!

Subject: help with translation

I'm trying to translate a few words of Yiddish for someone. It's the
inscription on the back of a photo.

1. I know that "tsum ondenk" can mean "in memory of." But it's also found
with photos. For instance, how would you translate "tsum ondenk inzer
brider fun ..." Is this "a remembrance of our brother from ..." or "a
remembrance for our brother from ..."? Would "a souvenir" be better?

2. How would you translate "gefeynenim" as in "inzer gefeynenim brider"?
It's spelled gimel-ayin-fey-tsvey yudn-nun-ayin-nun-ayin-yud- mem (sofit).
I would have expected paskeh tsvey yudn and either ayin- mem or yud-mem at
the end.

Thanks for your help,

Subject: Term for female rabbis

I have just returned from L.A. from my niece's ordination. More than half
of her class was female.

With the advent of more female rabbis being ordained, there seems to be a
blank space for the word or name for the husband of the rabbi in both
Yiddish and English.

As a group, perhaps we can coin a meaningful new word, or at least make
some suggestions.

Subject: topele kukeriku

Not sure if my spelling is correct, but I was told this was by Sholem
Aleichem and I can't find out anything else about it.  Anyone have any
ideas? I've tried to "google" it, but nothing.

Subject: Ibi Kaufman

I thank Malvin E. Ring for his suggestion that "lomir ale zingen" is the
program I saw on PBS years ago.  To confirm this, I recently purchased a
copy.  It is a delightful program with several of the big names in Yiddish
music today when they were so young you would have difficulty recognizing
them (Mike Burstyn, Eleanor Reissa, Michael Albert, Avi Hoffman, Zalmen
Mlotek).  But one performer was unfamiliar to me; can anyone tell me
anything about Ibi Kaufman?  Did she go on to have a successful career as
the others did?

Delightful as the program is, and glad that I am to have acquired it, it 
is
not the program I was actually looking for.  That, I fear, is lost
somewhere in the archives of some PBS station, to be found some centuries
from now by a researcher looking for something completely different.
Perhaps the momentous find will make the front page of the NY Times ("TV
Program Believed Lost since the 20th Century Discovered in Archives"), on
the Internet, of course, since there will no longer be print newspapers.
