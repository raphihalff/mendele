Subject: Nokhamol Tevye's perush

Thanks to David Herskovic for his derekh erets in disagreeing with me,
but it is no more than what one would expect from him. The only thing
is, his disquisition on the posik in question was hardly necessary
since, as Reb David points out, there is no way to understand how
Tevye can attribute his perush to Rashi and that is exactly my point:
Tevye is giving his own interpretation and attributing it to Rashi and
the only way it makes sense is to put m'geyfo in place of bagopoy etc.
and say exactly what he says, "Az men legt arayn krenk, nemt men aroys
kadokhes" Since, contrary to Reb David's quotation there is no
indefinite article anywhere there, Tevye is speaking in a general
sense. That has shaykhes to the posik, but only, as I can see it, that
way.

Now in the matter of "kukn vi hon in Bney Odom", the only real
difference between what I said and what Reb David says is that he says
it ten times more clearly than I did, without leaving out essential
detail that I did leave out. If this letter looks shaky it is because
I am writing it with my left hand while shloging al khet with my
right.

Subject: Tevye's quotations (continued)

David Herskovic (in 6.224, 1) quotes Tevye as saying _ayn khokhme,
ve'ayn aytse ve'ayn tvine keygn a krank ferd_ somewhere in the _first
part_ when his horse _breaks down_.

Eureka!  With David Herskovic's help (6.230, 2), hob ikh es gefunen!

It occurs at the beginning of the first Tevye story, Dos Groyse Gevins
(after the introductory letter, Katonti).  But memory plays tricks on
us all.  It is not as David Herskovic suggests (6.230, 2) _on the way
home from Boyberik_. Tevye (the monologist) is explaining to
Sholem-Aleykhem (the faithful listener) how you can't argue with
destiny.  Luck comes or it doesn't.  As I read it the quotation is
_eyn khokhme v'eyn eytse neged a shlekht ferd. Neged (Hebrew) and
keygn (Yiddish) both mean against.  Neither wisdom nor advice defend
against trouble from a bad horse.

This is said well before Tevye's horse takes it into its head to run
while Tevye stands beside the wagon, holding the reins ready to
_stand_ shimenesre. Tevye must hold on, running and shouting
shimenesre while continuing his comic translations of some of the
blessings..

Incidentally, this scene could have been exploited for its comic
possiblities in a movie.  Of course, it was not and could not have
been done in a theater on a stage.  Unfortunately, the makers of the
movie (Fiddler on the Roof) were (apparently) fixated on the confines
of the stage version.  As I have discussed elsewhere (in Der Bay),
Sholem-Aleykhem with his great visual imagination worked on silent
movie scenarios, had many ideas which were never realized.

Subject: Gender in N.E. Yiddish

I quoted Dovid Katz's text on the Yiddish Language (p. 53, 4.1.4)
which states that pre-YIVO Northeastern Yiddish had only two genders
(and still does for the descendents of those speakers?) to a friend
who expressed amazement, stating that since German was the
preponderant component of Yiddish and German certainly had/has a
neuter gender, that this would seem impossible.  What do I tell her by
way of explanation?

A dank faroys,

Subject: "Tate" af yidish

This past Sunday the TV Series "X-File" aired a supernatural drama
based on the golem myth.  In a scene between a hasidic father and
daughter the father is addressed by the daughter (three separate
times) as "tah-TEY";could there be another explanation for this other
than an attempt by an un-coached actress to pronounce the word
"TAH-te"?  I'd appreciate hearing from anyone who happened to see this
episode.

Subject: Shimmalekhl

I would like your help in translating this word "shimmalekhl". The
context is as follows.  When I used to play hide and seek, the one who
was out stood with his eyes closed and head against the wall or a
tree. One of us would draw a circle on his back and say, "I make a
shimmalekhl and I stick my finger in". This was the signal for the
"out" boy to start counting to 100 and for the rest of us to scatter
to our hiding places. I know "lekhl" means hole, but what is the
meaning of the full word "shimmalekhl"? Thank you for any help you can
give me.
