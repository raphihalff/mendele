Subject: Introduction

My name is Michel Konstantyn, son of Yosl (Jozef) Konstantyn (Przemysl)
and Fajga Brucha Janowska (Lodz).  I was born in Paris in 1952 and have
been a librarian with the American Embassy in Israel for the past 15
years.

My spoken Yiddish is good, I write and read pretty well (but not enough
-- to my utter shame), and, as Baruch Leib Gale put it (4.042), the world
of Yiddish that is no more fascinates me, it is an essential part of me
and I cannot, as a child of Shoa survivors, disconnect myself from it.
My old Zionist education (Hashomer Hatzair) is only partly matched with
the thinking ways in Israel, so that the "Diaspora" (galuti) aspect of
Yiddish in Israel and its speakers still tickles one in society, although
mentalities change and we can hope for this somewhat unforeseen revival
of the mame-loshen here.

My father used to write fiction (and other materials?) in Yiddish
magazines in Poland before the war, but, here again, the famous
intergenerational "Holocaust Silence" reigned and I have no idea about
those. My uncle, David Stettner, now writing editorials on foreign
affairs in UNZER SHTIME, Paris, used to be the editor of DER FRAYER
GEDANK, published in Paris in the 50's and 60's.  To everyone his/her own
brand of Yiddish and culture that survived as a twig in a plurality, a
vivid presence of this burning, intimate past that mirrors today's
reality in an acute, sensitive fashion.

I shall be glad to enrich my learning from such bright participants in
MENDELE, some of whom I know, and perhaps, in my own way, I shall be able
to contribute.

One remark: for other recipients' enlightenment, could references to
postings in previous issues be clearly stated (ex. : 4.044), so that they
can easily be retrieved?

Yisher koyekh un a gute hatzlohe!

Subject: Jewess

Fishl Kutner gave two descriptions for his daughters:

>JEWESS and PRINCESS are both beautiful words for beautiful people. Thank
>G-d we can afford to spoil our daughters--they deserve it!

He forgot an equally fitting third one: GODDESS.

Subject: "Jewess"

Two thoughts about the use of "Jewess."

I am perhaps the last person in the world to query about intended
anti-semitism in the use of the word, "Jewess," although my insensitivity
to intended antisemitism in speech probably helps make me a good Israeli.

Furthermore, I thoroughly enjoyed Scott's heroine, [lovely] Rebecca the
Jewess, and found her much more full blooded than her goyish counterpart,
Rowena.  The Jewess, in Scott, as in Shakespeare, is conceived as more
positive than her male counterpart; she is beautiful for one and is not
irretrievably "lost."  She can still be rescued by the goyim and thus
"saved."

On the other hand have you ever tried calling a poet of what was once the
fair sex -- and may now well be the unfairest sex -- "poetess," a
perfectly legitimate word in the English language? I would not try it
unless your armor is made of heavy chain mail.

Can we extrapolate from that?  Is the pejorative association that is read
into "poetess," someone who is less than a poet, to be understood in
"Jewess," too?  Less than a Jew?

Reminds me of my days teaching at Indiana University, the mid- 60's.  My
colleagues were put out and even very upset when they had to confront a
large poster in bold black letters I had printed and placed on the wall
behind my chair.  It read:

                       IT IS NOT ENOUGH
                         TO BE JEWISH!

>  Moreover, the ending '-ess' is generally used to denote
>the female of non-human animals, such as 'lioness', 'tigress', etc.  To
>me at least as a native speaker of English, it carries an implication
>that Jews are not quite human.  The only similar usage I can think of is
>'Negress', which carries similar overtones.

uh, how about actress, waitress, heiress, princess, duchess...? the first two
(or three?) are definitely not p.c. today but they were never (consciously or
intentionally) derogatory and never evoked 'not quite human', so far as i know.
(i'm giggling over the thought of whether a feminist lady di would balk at
'princess' or 'duchess'.)

i think an interesting issue is the one fishl kutner raises of what to call a
female jew in yiddish, where 'yidene' is derogatory, 'yidishke' doesn't seem to
exist outside of weinreich's dictionary, and 'yidishe tokhter' is conceptually
un-p.c.

question to dave sherman and others raising kids speaking yiddish: what have
you opted for and why?

ellen prince (no jokes, please. :) )

thanks to all those who explained lfk (lfq).

Subject: German Dialects and Yiddish

From my experiences in Germany, and my limited knowledge of Yiddish, I have
observed the following, as a response to Yude Rosof at Penn:

Badisch, a dialect which is spoken in the Black Forest and along the
Southwestern border between Germany and France, has many ties to Middle
High German and thus also to Yiddish. Like Yiddish, it has the past tense
form of the verb to be "gewe(n)," and the word "mir" for "we," rather
than the high German "wir." Words like "Deutsch" and "teuer" become
"deitsch" and "deier," as would be the case with that vowel sound in
Yiddish. The Rheinland has "nit" for "nicht" and "keen" for "kein," as in
Yiddish, and Berlinerisch, of course, also has the "ee" vowel form as a
substitute for "ei," as in "kleen" for "klein." as "nischt" where other
Germans would use "nichts." I have also heard it said that , in the city
of Muenster, locals use the words "jofel" and "schofel" as synonyms for,
loosely, "cool" and "uncool" respectively. These are supposedly Yiddish
forms. I am not sure whether this is true or simply a Westphalian urban
myth, but there you have it.

As for why Germans don't seem to want to talk much about Yiddish...
Beyond the immediate issue of historical trauma, there is another related
problem. I have noticed that most Germans my age (I am 25) don't know
what Yiddish is. As Americans, we are very keyed into the experience of
Eastern European Jews, who spoke Yiddish, whereas the Germans,
particularly young Germans, think of Jews in abstract historical terms,
and, in spite of the historical reality that primarily Eastern European
Jews were the victims of the Shoah, Germans usually are usually thinking
of German Jews, who, with the exception of 20th century immigrants from
the East, did not speak Yiddish. Anyway, I have found that I usually have
to explain to young Germans what Yiddish is. But once they know that and
I begin to tell them of the impact of Yiddish on American English, they
are always fascinated.
