Subject: Introduction

My name is Tami Echavarria.  I am the Reference Desk Manager at the
University Library of the University of California, San Diego.  My
subject background underlying my MLS is a BS, MS in International
Agricultural Development.  I am a first generation American, born of
immigrant parents; my mother is Lithuanian Jewish, and my father was a
Spaniard.  I am trilingual: Spanish, Yiddish, English.  I am literate in
Spanish and English, but just barely in Yiddish.  I can read Yiddish at a
very slow pace, sounding out the words in vernacular since I don't know
spelling.  My interest in Mendele is to have an avenue to practice
reading and speaking Yiddish, albeit in tranliteration.  I would prefer
the vernacular, if anyone has suggestions on how to accomplish this.  I
am not a Yiddishist, Judaic Studies bibliographer, learned scholar or
authority.  I am just a native speaker, a litvak dialectically.  If you
are willing to tolerate that, I would like to join you.

Subject: Origin of Zishe

"Zishe" means "sweet" and "Zisle" is a woman's name with the same meaning
(my Lithuanian Jewish grandmother's name).  In naming me after her, the
folks gave me the middle name "Honey" being an anglicized version of
Zisle.  I have no etymological expertise so I can't guess at language
origin of this word, though.

Subject: Re: Yiddish first names

Is there any standard work (that I can expect to find at the McGill
library where they have thousands of Y books) that contains a list of
[the more common] Yiddish first names with:

- The spelling (Hebrew oysyes)
- Yiddish and/or Hebrew transliterations into English
- English equivalent.

Hypothetical example (which might be roughly right):

   daled-veyz-vov-reysh-hey    Dvoyre    Dvorah    Deborah
   mem-???                                         Mathew    ?

Dictionaries seem to never cover this. Weinreich has some names, but not
in an organized fashion (unless I'm blind). Usually context makes it
clear it's a name, but it isn't always obvious tsi froy oder man, and
sometimes that's important to the story, and knowing the English
equivalent can sometimes help a lot in searching one's memory for
pertinent information.

A dank,

Subject: stem construction

dovid, thank you for your detailed response to my msg.  i'm a little
confused, though, about what you're saying.  if the verb-adjective order
is associated wtih the adjective being new information, shouldn't (c) be
felicitous, and (d) infelicitous, exactly contrary to what you say in
your message?   i've repeated the relevant parts below.j

> c. s'iz geven a sheyner tog.  di zun hot geshaynt.  bin ikh mir

>                vs.

> d. ...aroysgegangen fun shtub un mit a mol bin ikh nas gevorn. ...

> Methinks (c) is awkward, infelicitous.  Do native speakers with very,
> very fine judgments concur?

have i misunderstood what you are saying?

Subject: Fonye (Ganef) + "a makh"

Another (self)-educated guess in regard to the origin of "Fonye" to
denote a (male) Russian or Russians and by inference the Tsar, or vice
versa:

I've always seen "Fonye" likely originating from Russian "Afonia" or
"Fonia," nicknames derived from the Russian male given names Agafon or
Afanasii. Both names were popular in the nineteenth century and
especially associated with Russian peasants and/or priests. In my
experience, "Fonye" refers not only to the Tsar or other individuals, but
is at times also analogous to the African-American usages "the man" or
"honky," in collectively describing (Tsarist) dominant-culture authority
in general. The "ganef" part seems fairly clear, as Rick Gildemeister (a
gezunt em in di beyner arayn!) points out.

How "Fonye" came to particularly connote the Tsar remains, of course, a
good question, since I'm hard pressed to think of a Tsar Afanasii or
Agafon dating from the past couple of centuries (and don't have my
"Cavalcade of Tsars" pocket calendar handy at the moment). Possibly the
association went from bottom to top of the social hierarchy, starting
with priests, recruiting officers or draft board authorities and
extending upward to The Big Pirozhok himself. No doubt Bob Rothstein and
other Slavicists are about to leap into the fray on this very issue with
their learned counsel.

Re "a makh" (mit der hant, u.a.v): Begging pardons if I'm restating a
point already made here (I'm not always able to keep up with the frenzied
pace of Mendele discourse), but does not "makh" in the sense of "gesture"
or "wave" derive from Slavic "makh/mashat', etc. ('wave', 'gesticulation'),
bearing only coincidental resemblance to the Germanic-origin verb "makhn"
(make, do)? Clearly, the two meanings seems to have been conflated in
Yiddish to a large extent, despite their separate origin. Or does someone
have the inside story that Slavic "makh" has a Germanic origin, or is a
cognate of the Germanic verb?

Subject: tikn-toes (erratum)

[Regarding "Yiddish scrambling/V+Adj. vs. Adj.+Verb word order"]

I misreferred to one of my examples in the discussion of scrambling in
Yiddish, so it seems that my illustration counterexemplifies my point.
Sorry.

This is what I _did_ mean:

The (a)-utterance is good but the (b)-utterance, perhaps, isn't:

(a) s'iz geven a sheyner tog.  di zun hot geshaynt.  bin ikh mir aroysge-
gangen fun shtub un mit a mol bin ikh GEVORN NAS.  imetser hot af mir
oysgegosn an emer mit vaser!

*(b) s'iz geven a sheyner tog.  di zun hot geshaynt.  bin ikh mir
aroysgegangen fun shtub un mit a mol bin ikh NAS GEVORN. imetser hot af
mir oysgegosn an emer mit vaser!

Very, very, very subtle (if at all correct).

Subject: dropped pronouns

i can't speak to the yiddish details, but i'd like to suggest that
inflection for pronouns, while it may be a factor in dropping of
pronouns, is not determinative.

japanese, for example, has no person conjugation, but often omits
pronouns -- especially first and second person.  context and, most
important, big-time inferencing, take up the slack.  (you wouldn't want
to be too clear in japanese.)

russian makes more inflectional distinctions than polish, for example,
but russian generally does not drop pronouns, while polish does so, at
least a little more readily.  e.g. jak sie ma "how are you/he/she" is
common, perhaps more so than kak pozhivaete "how are you" in russian.

even in spanish and italian, the classic cases, the stem-form is used for
3rd person masc/fem, and also polite sing. "you", e.g. parla italiano?
"do you/he/she speak italian?"  but the pronoun is most often omitted.
the textbook's claim that they are present to resolve ambiguities is
disingenuous: native speakers can handle ambiguities more readily than
american learners.

french, in contrast, at least distinguishes "you" polite from "he/she" in
inflection, but still requires the pronoun.
