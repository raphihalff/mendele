Subject: Earning and learning

Although bereft as a child of the wonderful insights regarding
bilabial fricatives and labiodental fricatives (for which I thank
Ellen Prince, Arn Abramson and Rick Turkell) I too have an anecdote.

My father, whose raison d'etre was earning and learning, attended
(with deep enthusiasm) night school classes in English for foreigners.
One night he came home looking pale, ashen, distressed, and announced
he had been chosen to be Mr. Holland in the June closing assembly. We
thought he should be delighted.

"No," he replied, "I have to tell about George Goetals (sic)." Yiddish
having no "th" sound, he couldn't pronounce Goethals.  Whenever he had
free time, we sat with a mirror for him to study the tongue placement
for creating "th" as compared to touching the roof of your mouth to
create a "t". Each time he could create the "th" sound, he was
gleeful, but when he had to join it to the rest of the sounds, he
slipped back to the "t". His sense of failure and suffering matched
the intensity of his efforts.

It took two full months, with the help of his beloved teacher, Mrs.
Jarvis, (I cna't believe I remember her name these 55+ years), for us
to fill him with a sense of pride in his other new-found English
skills, and motivate him to the point where it didn't matter if his
pronunciation was not perfect.

He performed stalwartly, like a trouper. And when he said, loud and
clear, "George Goetals was..." to me he looked like Spenser Tracy.

Although he sounded like Akim Tamiroff.
