Subject: Mendele's Birthday

     A belated item lekoved Mendele's geburtstog:

     There used to be a comedy show on CBC Television called `The
Wayne and Shuster Show'. Among other things, Wayne and Shuster would
do spoofs of well-known stories, legends, and the like. Once they
did the Robin Hood story, with one of them playing Robin Hood and
the other Friar Tuck. (I now forget who did which). In any event, in
the course of their parody, Robin Hood tells Friar Tuck to shut up.
Friar Tuck replies:  "Host gehert: `Shaddup' tsu a friar".

A favorite proverb in my family, employed when someone makes a
proposal that vastly exceeds the actual resources: "A hunt hot a
keshene?"

This was in reference to a series of panels painted by Brueghel the
elder on folk idioms. How do we know he his beating his head against
the brick wall? Had we 21st century technology available, I'd reply
by showing the picture. It can be seen in Antwerp in the original
and in my home in New York City in reproduction and doubtless in
various "art books."

The panel shows a young man dressed in a garment that looks like a
white gown with (strangely) one foot shod and the other, on which
the youth is putting his weight, bare. His head is shown bent
forward and touching a "stand-alone" red brick wall. The wall's
proportions are like those of a large book, and it is a bit taller
than the youth. It is the narrow end of the wall that his head is
touching. Although Brueghel had no animation technology available,
the sense of motion is unmistakable.

Subject: various and sundry

Catching up on recent Mendeles:

1)  Isabelle Kreindler, I too  have heard _naroim_ [naroyim], from
the area between Grodne/Byalistok.  So at this point we know that it
is at least a "litvish" form.

2)  Anybody who has heard or used "er dreyt zikh arum vi a forts in
rosl" must have stopped at least once in his/her life to think:
'what the hell does this mean!!'  Well, flipping through a volume of
_yidishe filologye_ of YIVO, either vol. 1 or vol. 3 (because those
are the only ones I own) -- these are from the mid- to late 1930s --
I came across a variant of the expression which is perhaps solves
the mystery of its origin:  "er dreyt zikh arum vi a frantsoyz in
rosey" -- 'he's wandering around like a Frenchman in Russia'.  I
think I also saw the variant with "...vi a forts in vane" in that
same volume.

[By the way, whenever I quote something, take it with a grain of
salt:  I do my email in Philadelphia but my library is at home in
Northern New Jersey.  So citations are just by memory -- although
I'd like to think I have a good memory.  Somebody "caught me" a few
months ago when I said that the Harkavy of the 1920s had the form
_duken_ parallel to _dutsn_.  Indeed it's not in Harkavy (of the 20s
or the earlier dictionaries of his).  Since it wasn't there, I'll be
darned if I know where I saw it -- kh'zol azoy visn fun a beyzer
vetshere! Efsher hot zikh mir gekholemt?!  And wrt this issue:  if
you have access to native speakers who are non-litvakes, please find
out and post  what they say: ditsn/diken?  Perhaps they don't have a
verb form for this at all.

3)  If you remember the correspondence a number of months ago, it
turned out that a number of versions of kibinimat showed up.  The
ones I've heard are: kibinimat, kibinyamat, kibeni, kebenye matere.
And all of them are quite far from the original (isn't that right,
Bob Rothstein?) Whoever mentioned the expression most recently
mentioned that s/he had heard the expression used by otherwise
proper, even super-proper people.  So have I.  In Israel it's quite
common (I've only heard the shoerter forms, i.e. ending with mat and
not matere/matyere):  I saw a bumper sticker there with the letters
kuf-yud-beys-yud-nun-yud-mem-tes [with an exclamation point].  It
took a few moments for it to register.  Apparently the expression
has lost its gravity among Jews, perhaps because it isn't
analyzable.  And perhaps in der alter heym, even when the utterer of
the expression was in a Slavic speaking land, it was not analyzable
to him/her considering how far it has evolved away from the Russian
origin.  Is the curse used in modern Russian?  Ukrainian?  Polish?
How does it sound in those languages?

In my family I've heard (in English) "go to your Uncle Benny" or
"tell it to your Uncle Benny" and perhaps in Yiddish "gey tsum feter
beni".  What I chanced upon the expression in Stutshkov, I was
shocked to see next to "gey tsum feter beni" an asterisk, which
means in Stutshkov: "dirty word/expression".  I guess "gey tsum
feter beni" is a further development of "gey kibeni", and a further
step away from the gravity of the curse.

3)  Harry Bochner, you might've found _funem yarid_ boring because
Sholem-Aleykhem never got around to revising it.  He died while
writing it, as he'd only gotten up to his 17th or 23rd year, or stg
like that.  Would a literary scholar please step in [you see, we do
need literary scholars here!]: were the chapters of _funem yarid_
printed before their author's death, or only after?

4)  Ben Elkins, do you know that Yiddish is taught at your
university (UTexas) and that there's more than one full-time Yiddish
position there, in fact? (Itzik Gottesman, formerly of Penn, is one
of the Yiddish instructors and is in charge of drumming up Yiddish
activity on campus.)

The polls on the Great Line-Width Question are closed. Wider columns
were the clear winners.  However, in view of the problems that some
subscribers have with full screens, it would be prudent to go no
wider than 65.

The shames thanks those who took the trouble to write and hopes that
the new width will satisfy everyone.
