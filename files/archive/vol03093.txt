Tayere MENDELnikes

ikh lern zikh tsur tsayt yidish gants aleyn. ikh vintsh mir emetsn
vos mir ken helfen a bisl derbay: freges entfern vegn gramatik,
farsendenish, kontekst un kultur (bayspiln speter). ikh volt gevolt

yidish vi a vaser, hot gramatik lib, un vos efsher ken a bisl taytsh
nokh dertsu. nor a por freges (un minutn) a vokh, mer nit!

ikh lez (conjugating leyenen is still too scary) tsur tsayt "yidishe

than anticipated) un di hebreishe verter makhn mir di greste

Sample questions:

- [translation]: "if i were a bird, i would fly to thee" (in German:
  "waere ich ein Vogel, floege ich zu dir"): how to translate
  German's Konjonktiv II?

- [parsing]: "a koyne vi an arbes di groys": it means "a customer
  tiny like a pea", but I don't really understand the sentence
  structure (ie. what depends on what? -- eg. is "arbes" a genitiv,
  why "vi"?

- [vocab]: "rivkale, di shabesdike, arbet in fabrik": what does
  shabesdik mean. Weinreich (or "vaynraykh" a la YIVO) proposes
  "festive". How can a person be festive? Maybe life-of-the-party is
  meant :-)?

- [grammar]: modern German has both kennen (er kennt) and koennen
  (er kann, no T). Thus I expected to write in Yiddish: "zi ken (no
  T) nit kumen vayl zi kent (with T) nit dem veg". But Yiddish seems
  to have merged both. Is this correct?

- [sound]: can I have heard "er hot mitgebrengt za (instead of zayn)
  fidele"? Just as German 'ein' matches Yiddish 'a', maybe German
  'sein' can be matched (in some dialects) by 'za'.

I expect most questions to be related to structure.

A groysn dank,

Pierre[le] Lewis

P.S. The recent discussion on transliteration and transcription has
been quite interesting. Besides clarifying the concepts, I have
learned a lot about Yiddish dialects. I just wanted to mention that
transliteration/transcription is done in the context of a given
("target") language (in the case of YIVO, English). Tsveyvovn become
a V in English (because the sounds match), but would probably be a W
if the context had been German (as in Salcia Landmann's book). And I
would have found it much easier to write/read. (note: I'm not a
linguist).

Is "Weinreich" written in yet another transliteration system, or is
it simply the German spelling?

Subject: Pronunciation alternatives

My point is admittedly shifting somewhat as this discussion
proceeds. I don't quarrel with a standard orthography, although I
think a better choice could have been made than the YIVO standard,
but that's life. But I still say there should be a way to determine
the pronunciation from the dictionary, and this means (gasp) that
the southern dialect would have to be addressed by the standard in
some way.

This idea is not so radical.  My Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary
(1979) gives the standard pronunciation alternatives in common
dialects, and even some non-standard pronunciations in some cases.
For example, two pronunciations are given for "potato", and three
for "postnuptial".

Why not the same for Yiddish?  Why not annotate Weinreich's
dictionary with regional alternates?  To save space, why not assume
the most common vowel shifts (such as /kumets alef u/ for the
southern dialect) and not bother listing alternatives unless they
DON'T follow the dialect vowel-shifts?  In Ellen Prince's by now
famous /nokh/ and /nukh/ example, the pronunciation differs
according to the meaning of the word, so there would be separate
southern dialect pronunciations listed under the already separate
entries for the different meanings of StY _nokh_.

This would help people like me who wish to speak a common regional
dialect and sing songs intended for that dialect, as well as give me
an accepted authority to consult when obnoxious people correct my
dialect into THEIRS on the grounds that my pronunciation is
illiterate or just plain wrong ("nobody says /tipet/, it's
/tupet/").

Subject: Polish(?) geography

	I'm trying to figure out where my father's shtetl in Poland
was. Maybe someone out there has some savvy in poilishe geography.

	The place was called Wolcza Dulna (pronounced
vultcha-doolnya; anshuldikt mir, ehrliche orthographists!).  My
cousin claims it was punkt-farkert: Dulna Wolcza.  I don't know if
it's a village, city, county, region, or what.  When my father left
it, it was Austria; when my cousin's father left it, it was Poland.
Oyfn greynitz?

	I ask, because we just discovered a possible family
connection hailing from the cities Sonok/Linsk in Poland, and I
would like to establish at least a geographic connection, if there
is one.  Email info to:

Subject: Corrigendum

For having overlooked Zachary Baker's identification of Yehupets as
Kiev, my apology.

Vi shteyt in posuk: V'gam im yomar hechacham lodaat (afile ven a
narr vil vern oys-narr) lo yuchal limtso (iz keyner nishto in
d'reym).
