Subject: Nishdogedakht

It was so popular among so-called Belorussian Jewry! I well remember from
my family (descended from Vitebsk region) the only pronunciation without
'sh', i.e. 'nidogidakht'. Frankly, I 'm in using this word up today just
in such form. I remember one day in St.Petersburg when a friend of mine
(he is from Litvaks, I guess) answered me about one new Soviet opera
abruptly and capaciously: "Nidogidakht!" At once it became clear this
music not for us...

Subject: Dialectics

In the discussion re what authority decides proper usage if not the
average native speaker, most languages have an advantage over Yiddish.
This is due to the fact that they have or have had in their past a
national state which sanctioned one particular dialect over all others.
Thus was established the "correct" usage. This applies not only to
vocabulary and spelling but also to grammatical rules. Yiddish was never
so blessed (or cursed, depending on your viewpoint). There seems to be a
self styled academy growing in the American Universities, but it seems
that they may be divorced from the surviving speakers of the living
language, the Hasidim. Has anyone looked into the Hasidic press to see
the degree to which their usage agrees or disagrees with the language
being taught in the Universities? And if they differ does it become a
question of right vs. wrong? And if so, who is to decide?

Some dialect questions:

Ikh bin gegangn  or  ikh hob gegangn ? (I prefer the former but have
heard dialects in which the latter is consistently employed.)

Ikh lib dikh  or  ikh lib dir  or  ikh hob dikh lib  or ikh hob dir lib?
(Note: I'm quite familiar with proper German gramatical usage, but does
that make it the "correct" Yiddish usage? Remember, the Germans have been
blessed by having a national state.)

Other dialect items:

I have been informed that in the area around Lodz there existed prior to
WWII the first person dual nominative form  oon (as opposed to enk). Can
anyone confirm this? If so how would the verb decline?

tshatshke vs. tsatske

Clearly these are dialect distinctions in pronunciation. However it his
been my experience in my parents' dialect to hear it pronounced both
ways, with a resulting distinction in meaning and/or usage:

Vos far a tshatshke hostu gekoyft?  (i.e. worthless trinket)
Oy iz zi a tsatske!  (i.e. sarcastic implication of nastiness)

Is this distinction recognized by anyone else out there?

Tsi es git emetsn vos (or ver)...  vs.  Tsi 'siz faran emetsn vos (ver) ....
vs.... Tsi 'siz emetsn vos (ver) ...

I notice that the faran usage seems to be prefered here, however many
Yiddish speakers that I've met find it redundant or even puzzling. And
certainly I don't find agreement on vos vs. ver even though the latter is
more logical.

Finally, on a some what different issue, transliterated spelling: Clearly
with with the varied dialects there can be no agreement on standardized
spelling. I feel rather comfortable with the Yivo sheme currently being
promoted. However there are aspects of the Soviet scheme which  are
superior, e.g. x vs. kh, c vs. ts, c^ vs. tsh. (In Chinese Pinyin they
have adopted the x and c usage, which makes it almost half of mankind
|-). )  Any thoughts?

Subject: Getting the word out

In response to my posting about media attention for Mendele, Louis
Fridhandler wrote to me:

"I dare say a few selected interviews in depth with some Mendelniks might
turn up some extremely interesting stories, dramatic sagas perhaps. We
are a varied lot.  All are united by this love for a culture (language
and literature) mauled by history.

One phenomenon I find especially interesting is the number of non-Jewish
Mendelniks who have developed both facility and love for Yiddish.  There
is one even in Germany.

In a movie set in Montreal, "Lies My Father Told Me," a little boy asks
his Zeyde, "Do you believe in miracles?"  His Zeyde replies (without
skipping a beat), "No, but I rely on them."  The internet itself is a
miracle.  The survival of Yiddish is a special one.  Yiddishists still
rely on miracles. The irony is that Yiddish culture has been mainly a
secular enterprise.

The focus of a radio program need not be on the internet itself, but on
the fact that the internet has functioned to bring together widely
scattered devotees of Yiddish.  Generally they don't live close enough to
form a critical cultural mass.  They are too dilute.  The internet in
this case does something out of the ordinary."

I couldn't agree with him more. For this reason, I would like to call
upon Mendelniks to e-mail me personally with your Mendele tales... how
you got turned on to Mendele, why it's important to you, what your level
of ability is. Please write even if you are new or have a low level of
Yiddish ability (like me). I would like very much to put together a story
for the print media, in addition to radio. If any of you live in the San
Francisco Bay Area, or in Boston, I could perhaps do live interviews with
you.

Note: Anyone who would like to be interviewed or to submit writings to me
needs to be comfortable with the idea that they may be aired publicly. We
can discuss this on an individual basis, as well.
