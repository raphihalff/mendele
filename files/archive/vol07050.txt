Subject: az me lebt redux

The nearest English bon mot that I could come up with for "Az me lebt derlebt
men"  would be "Where there's life there's hope". A slightly more ambivalent
expression would be "This too shall pass." (Ambivalent since the English
expression, but not the Yiddish one, also refers to joys.) However I have
never heard it used in the sense of "Vi me bet zakh azoy ligt men". That's
right out of Brecht.

Subject: Yidish in Goles

Here in rural, Republican, relatively Judenreyn, better-natured New Hampshire,
you discover an area that is so rural the libraries still use card catalogues,
so Republican that the townfolk celebrate when Newt vacations down the road at
Sen. Bill Zeliff's resort, and so relatively Yudenreyn that the nearest shul
is more thn an hour and a half away. 

Yet, for some years now, every summer the World Fellowship Center at the edge
of town schedules seven days called Jewish Week, open to the entire community.
Of course, it culminates in a well-attended, toe-tapping, Saturday night
Klezmer Concert. The Fellowship, a rustic, very rustic, retreat for thinking
ultra liberals, during Jewish week attracts as guests the former students of
the leftist Ordn shulas and Camp Kinderland, and a few Yiddish activists. 

Last month, Eric Vieland, a Director of the National Yiddish Book Center, and
Jeff Sharlett, the new editor of their expanded glossy magazine, the
Pakn-Treger, officiated over three nights of lebedike lecture/discussion
about Yiddish or Jewish revival and the directon the Book Center will take.

I stand eternally grateful to the NYB Center for its rescue and storage of
our Yiddish books. Like all Mendelistn, I had been raised in the "whoever
touches a book, touches a man" genre.  But I often wondered about the fate of
these million books (and cartons full are still coming in daily) that could
fill a small city. Would the Center build its "bridge to the 21st Century"?
How? Would the aesthetically pleasing  Amherst "post-modern shtetl" as
Jonathan Mahler named it, be a viable homeland?

Eric's and Jeff's youthful, dynamic presentations and answers about the
future were youth=oriented and hopeful. The evenings of good talk were
enhanced by the unlikely place they were occuring. And the realization once
more crystallized that anywhere that Yiddish raises its head, be it
well-coiffed or tousled, there is our homeland.

In reference to my own August 8 post in Mendele Vol. 7.048, August 12, 1997,
on the lyrics of "Anniversary Song," I have since found and listened to
Connie Francis singing the song on "Connie Francis Sings Jewish Favorites,"
MGM E3869.  I managed to decipher most of the song and list what I found
below.  In a few places where I couldn't make out the text, I have placed a
bracketed ellipsis [...] to stand for the (to me) indistinct word or words.
For words I wasn't sure of (I know some of my ear identifications must be
off the mark), I wrote what I thought I heard and underscored it as best as
one can in e-mail as e.g. _eybelekh_.  The book, _Encore! Music Jerry
Sperling,_ Tara Publications catalog # CO-JSP-20B MAY contain the Yiddish
lyrics.  If anyone can confirm what I may have heard and fill in the gaps,
I'd be grateful.

Adapted by George Shaw from "Connie Francis Sings Jewish Favorites," MGM
E3869 (33 1/3 long playing record); lyrics partially transcribed.  Last
verse in English.  I really enjoyed listening to her Yiddish singing!  Quite
a number of years have passed since I last heard this record.

Dear, as I held you so close in my arms,
Angels were singing a hymn to your charms,
Two hearts gently beating
And murmuring low:
"My darling, I love you so."

Subject: "Yoyvl-lid" or "Anniversary Song"

This will probably be of no help to Elliot Gertel in his quest for Yiddish
lyrics to the "'Yoyvl-lid' OR 'Anniversary Song'" [7.048], but I hope other
Mendelistn will find it as interesting as I do.

The melody of the so-called "Anniversary Waltz," according to the _New
Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians_, dates from 1880.  It was
composed on the Viennese model as part of a larger waltz suite entitled
"The Waves of the Danube" by Joseph Ivanovici, a Rumanian who had studied
in Iasi (among other places). Its incarnation as an Anniversary Song with
lyrics, however, is surprisingly recent, the story of which would take us
well beyond the scope of a Yiddish-related discussion but for its
mirror-image symmetry to that of the English-language popular song "Bei Mir
Bistu Schoen."

In my posts 6.251 and 6.257 -- which were responding to posts by Ellen
Prince [6.241] and Harold Orbach [6.249] concerning the Russian song _Ochi
chornia_ appearing in a Vitagraph "race film" -- I described songwriter
Saul Chaplin's account of the famous story of his having heard Sholom
Secunda's original _Bay mir bistu sheyn_ sung in Yiddish by an
African-American duo at a theater in Harlem, which led him and his partner
Sammy Cahn to make an English-language swing version.  I recounted that, in
Chaplin's recent book _The Golden Age of Movie Musicals and Me_ (Norman,
Oklahoma: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994), he described his own work at
Vitagraph studios, cobbling together quick musical arrangements for
low-budget films, and I speculated that the "jazzed up version of ochi
chornia...then into a pure jazz number" (as Ellen described it) might have
represented another Chaplin-Cahn effort.  By emulating the "Bei Mir Bistu
Schoen" evolutionary process:

        Yiddish song --> jazz number --> mass media version

they might have produced:

        Russian song --> jazz number --> mass media version.

Not so coincidentally, it was the very same Saul Chaplin, ten years later
and moved to Columbia Pictures in Hollywood, who was working on
arrangements for _The Jolson Story_ (1946).  (Al Jolson, of course, was the
cantor's son who starred in his own virtual autobiography _The Jazz
Singer_, the 1927 motion picture which ushered in the age of sound and
defined the shape of the popular culture that came to dominate
international media by century's end.)  As Chaplin tells it in his book, he
needed something -- and he needed it fast -- for *background* music for a
scene depicting the wedding anniversary of Jolson's parents.  Because
Ivanovici's music was long since in the public domain (lapsed copyright, no
licensing fees), it seemed ideal, and he quickly dashed off some lyrics to
it (in English, of course).  Though Chaplin thought he was only doing
background music (his own critique of the metrics and phonetics of his
throwaway lyric is priceless -- see pp. 108-11 of his book), Jolson's
recording of the song became a hit and was seemingly instantly absorbed
into quasi-folk repertory as The Anniversary Song.

Now on Mendele we have arrived upon a discussion of the Yiddish version of
the song.  Though I can't supply the lyrics, I can offer one more
Chaplinesque paradigm, this time scrambling the elements in a new
permutation:

        Russian-Habsburg waltz --> mass media version --> Yiddish song.

Subject: Az me lebt, derlebt men 

Michael Krantz (Mendele 7.047) suggests "comme on fait son lit, on se couche"
and similar as translations of "az me lebt, derlebt men."  I am under the
impression that the Yiddish proverb does not imply any judgment on the
good/bad/prudent/imprudent behavior of the subject, but rather refers to
simple longevity.  I suggested in a private message to M. Steinlauf the
translation "If you live long enough, you'll see everything!" I believe the 
meaning of this, as many expressions, can change according to the context.  It
can mean that simple endurance will get you through hard times, which will
eventually end, or that one's hopes will be fulfilled if one does not give up.
I wonder if it can also be used in a negative context?

I offer these thoughts very tentatively, and would welcome corroboration or
correction from anyone more informed than I.

Subject: terms of affection

Rivke asks about terms of endearment [7.047]. Troym-hendler (daughter of the
Yiddish poet Menke Katz) is the person to contact.  At the recent WC
Yiddish fest in Connecticut she listed hundreds of romantic and erotic
terms in Yiddish.

Subject: Verlaine into Yiddish

In one of the three versions of Verlaine's _ IL PLEURE DANS MON COEUR,
(Mendele - Vol. 7.047) M. Litwin translates _Quelle est cette langueur / Qui
penetre mon coeur?_ thusly:

Fun vanen kumt tsu mir
In hartsn der kumer?

I received a couple of inquiries about the meaning of _kumer_.  I couldn't
find it in Weinreich but I did find it listed in section 512 of Stutchkov's
_Der oytser fun der yidisher shprakh_ (page 555 in my edition) along with
_zorg_, _dayge_, _umru_ and _angst_.  Thus I assume that the meaning of
_kumer_ has something to do with sorrow, grief, worry, etc.  Inasmuch as I'm
no scholar, I appeal to the academicians on this list to supply us with a
more specific gloss on _kumer_  and, if possible, to offer a conjecture as to
why it doesn't appear in Weinreich.

One of my inquirers asked, "Who is M. Litwin"?  I have no information on him
and would be grateful to hear from anyone who does.

Subject: Translations and poetry plaudits

After reading the excerpt from Chaim Grade's _Elegy for the Soviet Yiddish
Writers_ which Iosif posted for us, I feel compelled to express, maybe even
to advertise, how fortunate we are to have Cynthia Ozick, like a poet 
laureate, on our team. Her translations are so superb, so true, so neshomedik,
each poet she touches sings anew with perfect pitch. 

Also, Grade's masterful elegy invoked the bereft feeling "of wearing out the
hurt" for Dovid Edelstadt who died too young, who filled the centerfold of
last week's Forverts.  Plaudits to the Mloteks for again breathing life into
the powerful, passionate poems of Dovid Edelstadt in last week's _In Der Velt
Fun Yidish_ . To have died at 26 and to have left such a legacy - we still
sing his songs - is not to have died at all.
