According to Marvin Caplan ("Raisins and almonds" - Goldfaden's glory. in
Judaism: A Quarterly Journal of Jewish Life and Thought, Spring 1993,
v42, n2, p193-200):

 The white kid is surely kin to the kid of the final seder song, Had Gadya.
 That kid is the embodiment of Israel, whom God the Father buys for two
 zuzim -- which stand for the two tablets of the covenant, or, in other
 interpretations, for Moses and Aaron.

Interestingly, Caplan's article starts from:

 ...               Yet it is hard to imagine a song whose words are more
 likely to offend contemporary Jewish sensibilities than that beloved and
 quintessential Yiddish lullaby, "Rozhinkes mit Mandlen (Raisins and
 Almonds)."

 Do the people who clamor for it at bar mizvahs and weddings and other
 Jewish social functions know of what they are singing as they join in on
 its melting, lovely chorus? Are they aware of what comes after the
 chorus? Most likely not. Do the artists who sing the song at these
 affairs know all the words? Perhaps they do. And, if they do, you may be
 sure that they generally have the good sense not to sing more than the
 first verse. Even the first and best known verse may sound a little
 strange to Jewish ears today...

Subject: Nota Bene [Yiddish software]

I am surprised that in all of the discussion that I've read on Mendele,
over the years, regarding Yiddish fonts and word processors, I don't
recall ever seeing mention made of the Nota Bene word processing program,
which includes Yiddish on its Lingua add-on program.  The default Yiddish
keyboard is the one familiar to users of the old Royal manual
typewriters, and characters can be added to the keyboard, representing
(for example) the YIVO diacritics for letters such as "fe" and "veyz."

As a word processor, Nota Bene is far from perfect -- no spell check,
some directionality problems when using Latin and Hebrew alphabets
together, etc.  The program "feels" like an English word processor, to
which Hebrew and Yiddish have been added as options.  Still, it does the
trick for me, and that includes producing indexable bibliographies in
Yiddish (with the help of an experienced Nota Bene programmer).

Nota Bene has reached version 4.2.  Users know that it's not easy to
learn, and the company that created and markets it has gone through
various gilgulim (including near bankruptcy).  In addition to Hebrew and
Yiddish, NB Lingua also handles Cyrillic and Greek.

Subject: Mock Yiddish

I have been reading with great interest the commentary on "mock yiddish"
and would like to make the following observation.

What ever happened to our ability to laugh at ourselves and with
ourselves? There was a time, not to long ago, when dialectic humor of any
kind was just that, humor. It  would appear  as if we must all be
"politically correct" and take offense at everything that doesn't seem to
be the correct usage. Must everything we say be taken as a racial slur to
someone?

It is wrong to be cruel to people through ethnicity, but we all need to
retain our sense of humor and balance. If Buddy Hackett can do a Yiddish
commercial for Dannon Yogurt, in New York City, it is humor not a racial
slur or a mocking of things Jewish. Even Uncle Sam recognizes that we
have to answer to a "Higher Authority".

Subject: Korn's _A nay kleyd_

I thank Shleyme once more for his comments.  I missed the "button" dis-
tinction completely.  I think the problem (for me) with that line is not
only the "a" but the "s'iz a" phrase as a whole.  Ruth Whitman ignored
this verb construction in her translation and chose instead to focus on
"flist" as the verb for the entire last part of the poem.  I admire her
translation, though it does raise a few questions for me.

She uses "but" for "nor", when I would prefer "only".  For me this is
more in keeping with the difference that I percieve as the lower inten-
sity of "nor" compared with "ob  er", which I find closer to the English
"but". I also would prefer to translate each of Korn's "un" conjunctions
at the begining of the 2nd and 3rd lines in the 2nd stanza.  The repe-
tition in English, as in the original, adds something -- certainly
lengthening the 2nd, line is preferable imo.  Finally (the poem is so
beautifully simple that it is worth this discussion), the last line:
"farshteynert un shver" has a finality and weight in the Yiddish, esp.
following the 3 preceding lines, that is not quite captured by Whitman's
translation -- "heavy as a stone" -- though she comes very close to it. I
would prefer the more literal translation: "petrified and heavy".

Subject: Hot vs cold compresses

I so very much enjoyed the story that Andrew Cassel told of the Dr. and
the Feldsher who prescribed opposite treatments, one suggesting warm
compresses and the other cold.  I had a vision of the final line based on
an old Yiddish joke that deals exactly with such a case, but Andrew did
not come out with that line.  Actually, it was a straight ending.

But here is the joke:

A man goes to the doctor with pains in his stomach.  The doctor tells him
to put warm compresses on it.  The patient goes home and does just that.
The pain gets worse.  After several hours he can hardly stand it any
longer.  His wife is so sick of him complaining that she tells him to put
cold compresses on it.  He does.  He gets better almost at once.

Angry, he goes back to the Dr. who gave him the advice of warm
compresses, explains what happened and states that only cold compresses
made him feel better.

"Cold compresses???  Who told you cold compresses," said the Dr.

"My wife to me cold compresses, that's who!!!"

The Dr. then said, "That's funny, my wife told me warm compresses!!"

Subject: Translating Yiddish

In answer to Marti Krow-Lucal (Mendel 5.083), I have always felt that the
best way to get the "feel" of a foreign language is to read bi-lingual
versions with the foreign language and English on facing pages.  To this
end I have accumulated a fair number of dual language books in various
foreign languages such as Spanish, French, German, Russian, etc.  In the
Yiddish classes which I have taught, all readings were in Yiddish with
facing English translations - some of which I had to do myself.  There
are a number of dual language, Yiddish-English books which I have in my
library such as: "Peretz" (Sol Liptzin, YIVO); "I.L.Peretz, Selected
Stories" (Eli Katz, Zhitlowsky Foundation); "An Anthology of Modern
Yiddish Poetry" (Ruth Whitman, October House); "Onions and cucumbers and
plums - 46 Yiddish Poems" (Sarah Zweig Betsky, Wayne University Press);
"The Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse" (Howe, Wisse and Shmeruk,
Viking); "Words Like Arrows" (Shirley Kumove, Warner Books).  Also, of
course, there are separate English translations which can be held side by
side with the Yiddish versions.  I don't believe in "making Yiddish a
kind of holy tongue that must not be translated", I just would like to
see the Yiddish along with the translation.
