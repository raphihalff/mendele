DARE   (Dictionary of American Regional English) has just
announced the forthcoming publication of its 2nd volume
(D-H, I think). It will be a while before they pass
judgment on "sissel".

well, i NEVER heard the /i/ vowel in these words in
YIDDISH--if it was a yiddish dialect that influenced them,
how come it didn't affect their yiddish? it was only in the
english/yinglish words.  i can just hear my mother saying
'gey koyf a khale' OR 'go buy a khali' but never 'gey koyf
a khali'.

now, if the people from lomza etc got to america first and
borrowed these words into english, using of course their
native dialect's phonology, subsequent waves of immigrants
might have thought that that's how you say these things in
english. so do we know if they got there first?

also, what's the story on these dialects? would they also
have said shmati and khaneki and maysi (/maynsi/ or
/ma:nsi/) and latki...? if they said /i/ in all and only
the words where the yinglish has /i/, i'll buy it, but
otherwise i'm dubious, tho a dialect story seems like the
only possible answer, given the restricted domain of the
phenomenon.

i think there's an analogous thing in 'italinglish'--the
english of italian-americans--where final vowels get
dropped: zbaget 'spaghetti', rigot 'ricotta', manigot
'manicotta', fazul 'fasouli' etc. and it happens even in
the english of italian-americans whose native italian
dialect doesn't do it. but i don't think this phenomenon is
well-understood either.

>the tushi, bubi phenomenon may well reflect the
>mummy, daddy one. No?

again, why only in certain words? why would mommy/daddy
affect khale and not matse (which was never /matsi/), bube
and not tante (never tanti)?

a dank.

Fayvl: how about that nasalization in your "bube-maanse".
Any justification in Hebrew classical phonology for the
nasalization of "ayin": manse. ya(y)nkef and consistently
among Sefardim, in Judeo-Italian, etc. Anyone else on this?

In re Nigella:   Stutchkoff lists shvartskiml (cf. German
Schwarzkuemmel) and feldkiml.  B. A. Sokolovskii (Botanik.
Hantbikhl.  Kiryat sefer:  Vilna [?], l928--cited by
Immanuel Loew, Die Flora der Juden) gives tshernishke.
(Actually Loew cites "tsherniske," but I suspect a
misprint.)   It's  czarnuszka in Polish and chernukha or
chernushka in Russian.

For further confusion:  plants of the genus Nigella are
apparently sometimes known as fennel-flower, although they
have nothing to do with fennel. The black seeds that people
have been remembering are from Nigella sativa.  I quote
Jill Norman's _Complete Book of Spices_:  "The herbalist
Gerard describes the seeds as '...of a blackish colour,,
very like unto onion seed, in taste sharpe, and of an
excellent sweet savour.' [...] In India, where nigella
seeds are commonly used as a flavoring, there is much
confusion about their name.  In the north of the country,
where nigella grows wild, they are called _kala jeera_ or
black cumin.  Real black cumin is also known as _kala
jeera_ as well as shahi jeera_, or royal cumin.  In much of
India, nigella seeds are known as _kalonji_ (black onion
seeds)."  Regarding cumin, Norman writes "Cumin is often
confused linguistically with caraway.  In French, caraway
was often referred to as _cumin des pres_, and inaccurate
translations from Indian languages have confused _jeera_,
which usually means cumin, with _shia jeera_, or caraway
[..] Black cumin (_kala jeera_) is [...] sometimes called
black caraway.  [...] It should not be confused with
nigella, which has also been known by the same name."

I suspect that's more than anyone wanted to know, but I get
carried away sometimes.

In the days when I lived in winnipeg, where yiddishkeit
meant bekitzer-- just speaking yiddish-- so that Israelis
didn't count -- the bakeries sold no challah, but they had
a clone for it, which was called koyletch-- is this some
dialect I know nothing about because in Toronto chalah is
chalah unless its egg bread.-- where did koylich come
from?...........herschel
