Subject: RE: Pupik/pipik

Re: Elliot Gertel's question, in my family "pupik" or
"pipik" referred to the bellybutton and environs,
especially of a baby in diapers, who in moments of delight
and affection would be kissed "afn pupik."  It was a term
of endearment, for babies.  For adults it could be
condescending, as when a shirt didn't quite cover the
abdomen:  "Men zeyt zeyn pupik."  The word was also used
for a chicken-gizzard.  Novelist Marguerite Dorian, born in
Bucharest, concurs with these usages that prevailed among
both Litvak and Galitsiane neighbors in The Bronx.

Subject: Is there Yiddish among thieves?

    The recent talk about sex sets off nostalgia.  Those of
us who were raised in a semi-Yiddish environment,
especially one where Yiddish was a secret language used
only to keep the kids from finding out what was going on,
spawned a gutter argot we used for our own purposes, mostly
to talk about forbidden subjects.  Bob Werman, mentioning
trennen, suggests a chant of ours, which I recall as:

Ai ai ai ai trennen ist mein leben
Das ist vei der Gott a schmuck gegeben.

The grammar, of course, could not meet the standards of the
linguists in this group, but we were all masters for what
later became our storehouse of four letter words.  We all
knew jokes with Yiddish punch lines, which we would share
with glee.  Those of us who were connected with goniffs (as
I was up to about the age of 12, a veritable Billy Bathgate
running bag for the remnants of the Capone organization in
Cleveland), quickly learned derogations. One preferred to
be summoned as, "hey, schmuck" as opposed to "putzeleh."
The names Mushy Wexler, Arnold Rothstein, and Sander Birns
may mean nothing today, but they were giants in their day
and Wexler and Rothstein were pioneers when Nevada
legalized gambling.  My connected, through Uncle Sid, who
owned the Miami Deli was my Yivo.  No Arbeiterring for this
kid.

I wonder if there are others for whom this discussion
trigger this strangely pleasant nostalgia for a time when
there was honor among thieves and Eliot Ness was impotent.

Subject: RE: Meshorer

David Sherman asks:


Meshorer?  What does this mean (well, some of that was
clear from the rest of the article), and what's its
derivation?

**************

Meshorer, from shir, a poet or a SINGER; King David - whom
scholars are trying to turn [Has v'shalom!] into a myth
[Doesn't he have enough trouble being a Jew?] was poet and
probably a singer as well [the rolls may not have been
separate; see balladeer in European traditions].  The
meshorer was also one of the classes of Levi'im whose job
was to sing the psalms.  The gemora - arguing for
separation of jobs [which modern women find so difficult to
accept] - says that the singing Levi who guards [sho'er,
another levitical function] for his brother should be put
to death.

A meshorer is a poet, singer or bard.  It's a Hebrew word
from the same root as shir (poem, song).

Subject: Meshorer

        David Sherman asked for the derivation of
"meshorer".  It is ultimately from the Hebrew word shir
'song, poem'.  The basic Hebrew verb derived from shir and
meaning 'to sing' is (past and present tense) shar
(Ashkenazic pronunciation shor), infinitive lashir/loshir.
But there is a less common verb derived from the same root
(for aficionados of Hebrew grammar, it's in the demi-binyan
"polel", an equivalent of pi'el for middle-weak verbs). The
past tense is shorer, infinitive leshorer; MESHORER is the
present tense and the active participle: 'one who sings or
composes poetry'.  In modern Hebrew it's become limited to
'poet', not 'singer', but that's beside the point.

        Since the "o" in this word is khoylem, which
usually corresponds, at least in open syllables, to
standard Yiddish /oy/, the Yiddish word ought to be
"meshoyrer".  And that's just how Weinreich's dictionary
gives it, under the spelling mem-shin-vov-reysh-reysh. Just
before Meshiakh.  Defined as "choirboy in a synagogue;
Hebrew poet".

Subject: RE: Meshorer

David Sherman asks for the meaning and derivation of
"meshorer". In the sense in which I used it I intended
"choirboy", one of the translations given in Weinreich's
dictionary. It is, in fact, a modern hebrew word meaning
specifically, a member of a cantor's choir. Its earlier
menaing in hebrew

is a composer of litergical poetry and song.
