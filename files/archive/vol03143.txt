Subject: Frayland, grammar and argot

The running dispute concerning proper Yiddish grammar, vocabulary,
etc. seems to me quite beside the point since the issue as to what
constitutes a language as opposed to a dialect or argot is really a
political issue. For example Dutch is regarded as a  langauge while
directly accross the boarder in Friesland virtually the same
language is regarded as a platt, or dialect. French, a bastardized
Latin resembling Black English in many ways, was the dialect spoken
in the Ile de France. It was imposed by force on the rest of the
country by Louis 14 in a draconian fashion. It is now of course
regarded as one of the great languages of the world. However
Catalan, a very ancient and interesting language never had a
definite nation state of its own and thus lives in a linguistic
twilight zone.

Yiddish by the same token never attained language status since there
never existed a state sponsor for an official version. In 1946 an
attempt was made to create a Yiddish speaking state for the people
liberated from the camps. The Dutch government was prepared to offer
the Jews Surinam for that purpose. However the Zionists feared that
the presure would be off the world commuity to crate a Hebrew state
in Palistine should that happen. Golda Mayerson, Moshe Shertok and
Dovid Grunbaum (yes they used to be Jewish in those days) used their
connections in the Socialist International to lobby heavily against
it. Frayland, as it was to be called, was defeated by 1 or 2 votes
in the Dutch parliament. As a result for better or worse we now have
a charming polyglot language which draws quite redundantly on the
many languages of the world where Jews have sojurned. Shall we say
Krieg or Milkhuma, Fried or Sholem, yes and Hokhtsayt or Khasene, or
even such Americanisms as "Ikh glaykh dos" instead of the Germanism
"Ikh hob dos gern". Or how about "Hebrayish" instead of "Ivrit"?
Indeed if the purists would seek to ban all Germanisms from Yiddish
we might as well return to Hebrew and have Yiddish give up the ghost
entirely. After all Yiddish is basically a Mittel Hochdeutch dailect
much as we hate to admit it.

Fortunately the Yiddish speakers love the polyglot nature and the
redundacies of the language even though , or perhaps even because,
it vexes the academicians who love to codify and instruct. They
forget that grammar is descriptive and not proscriptive. Inorder to
determine Yiddish grammar it is necessary to go to those few
survivng communities in Brooklyn or Mea Shearim where it is still a
living language rather quibling over the proscription of dusty
books. Un az men take vil nisht az dos tsvayte vort im zats sol zayn
a verb iz es azoy geferlikh? Oyf Yiddish hot men brayres un mir hobn
es lieb azoy!

A dank far ayer tsayt.

I wonder if "mantsbil" is analagous to the Rheinhessian word
"Mannsbild," meaning "chap," "guy," "Kerl," that sort of thing.

please, let us get a sense of proportion here. 'the rule', as you
put it, is taken from a FIRST-YEAR TEXTBOOK. i am quite sure that
weinreich never intended it to be construed as a complete
description of the verb-first declarative construction.

as for the facts, you reject all the songs we've listed as instances
of 'poetic license' (that's quite an honor for the likes of _bin ikh
mir a shnayderl_!) and you do not seem to want to read the studies
that have been done of the construction. how about just reading
yiddish works? presumably _der forverts_ is not too poetic for the
purposes at hand?  if it is, you should be able to find a million or
so other works at the yiddish book center. and, in them, you will
find many millions of verb-first declaratives that violate your
'rule'.

Subject: sch

[Yankel Lantz writes:]

>The local paper recently carried an obituary for an elderly
>Mennonite lady named Mrs. Elizabeth Schmuck.

it's not at all surprising that the name is spelled with sch; it's a
german name, after all. (means 'jewel', y'know.)

> "Sch" followed by a consonant simply cannot be
>pronounced any way other than soft, thus I see no reason why it

first, there is a not uncommon variant spelling of _scrod_: _schrod_
(/skrad/). so sch followed by a consonant COULD be pronounced /sk/
in english.

second, a reasonable transcription system uses the same symbols in
all the contexts in which the sound occurs, which would preclude
using _sch_ in schmuck but _sh_ in sheyn (since it COULD be mistaken
for /skeyn/, right?).

>Would a French Yiddishist really write "chmou...," er, "chou" or
>"choustaire?"  I'd be interested to know.

a french speaker writing romanized yiddish and ignoring the
internationally recognized yivo system could definitely write _ch_
for /sh/. in fact, i just got out an old record of line monty
singing originally yiddish songs in french, produced in paris, and
the second song is _cha shtyl_. (consistency was never a priority of
the transcriber-in-the-street.) analogously, the standard french
spelling for the arab woman's headgear, so much discussed in the
french press a few years ago, is _chador_; obviously, this is from
arabic, not yiddish, but the point is that _ch_ is the most natural
graphemic representation of /sh/ in french.

>  YIVO hin, YIVO her, so what's the difference

not much, alas. do you mean _shukh_ 'shoe' or _sho_ 'hour' (/shu/ in
Central and Southeastern Yiddish) or something else? (perhaps a
litvak's hypercorrection of _ski_ 'ski'?) see the problem?
