Subject: nivroko

This is also hare-brained.  I got an idea as a result of an anecdote I heard
many years ago (perhaps a precursor to the urban myth).  Apparantly,in Russia,
(according to the story), the author of a book about Nebuchadnezzar was
arrested because on 5 lines running down the spine, the book's title read Ne
Bog ad Ne Tzar (something like it in Cyrillic) which was translated by the
thought police of the time as "no God and no Tsar".  That story rang in my
ears as I Iooked at the nivroko request. I am no chochem, and not much of a
linguist, but when I read nivroko I thought it sounded like part Russian and
part Hebrew for "ni bracha" or "no blessing".  It is pure intuition, and
therefore has no yichus.  Anyway, just throw it in the pot and see what
happens.

Subject: Nivroko.

Gabriella S. Safran posted a question on I.Babel and nivroko [07.151]. You
won't find the word in any Russian-English dictionaries, since it isn't
Russian. It sounds as if it should be Ukrainian (ni v roku),- and in some
places it is pronounced "nivroku" - but (for unascertained reasons) it is
found predominantly or exclusively in the Ukrainian and Moldavian Jewish
lexicon.

It may be, that it was simply a suitable translation for ken-ore, and somehow
became a vertl in its own right. But it's not a normative Russian language. 
There are many expressions and idioms in Russian, used only by Jews and not by
other Russian speakers unless in stylization, because they are, essentially,
ingrained calques from Yiddish; these are used by younger generations, who do
not speak Yiddish, but retain the expressions. This early story by I.Babel
(1916) confirms that the word was already in use at the time, and it is still
associated with the Yiddish-inflected language only.

Incidentally, in his other novella "Konets Bogadel'ni" (The End of an
Almshouse), he uses the word "smit'yo" (in another place - "smet'yo"), which
is also used by some other authors from Odessa (variant: smittyo)  as a
substitute for drek. This word is limited to the Jews of Odessa, though, and
I'm not aware as to where it comes from. 

Now you've got the second opinion from Kishinev.

Shaya Mitelman

[Moderator's note: _Nivroku_ is a common Ukrainian word and literally means
the same as _keynenore_, however in modern Ukrainian it is used also for "not
bad" and "better than expected". _Smittia_ is Ukrainian for "sweepings".]

Subject: Nivroko

Gabriella Safran asked (7.151) about the expression _nivroko_ used in a story
by Isaac Babel.  This is presumably the Ukrainian (and Southern Russian, e.g.,
Odessan) _nivroku_ 'may no evil eye befall', i.e., _keyn eynore_.  Ukrainian
_uroky_ means 'evil eye'; Polish _urok_ can mean '(evil) spell'; cf. Russian
_rok_ 'fate'.

Subject: shvantz

Nu, the German/Yiddish word for serpent/tail.... isn't it shvantz??
That's a bit vulgar, too. And the word for smelling something is also:
shmekn. 
Where is this all leading us?

Time to return to the main topic, Yiddish language and literature.

Sholem Aleichem traversed a very complicated development as a writer.  His
early works were very diverse.  To develop a deeper, more accurate conception
of how Sholem Aleichem tried out various styles and language modes, one should
read one after the other 1) Shomer's Mishpot (The Trial of Shomer), 1888, and
2) the first story, first version of Tevye, Tevye the Milkman (inadequate
translation of der milkhiker), 1895.  I do not refer to the second, revised
version, Dos Groyse Gevins, 1903.  Only seven years had elapsed between these
two pieces, but the language and style were transformed. 

He wrote Shomer's Mishpot for other writers and critics of his region, and
also for the Yiddish-reading public in Europe.  Not so many readers of Yiddish
lived then in America.  In Shomer's Mishpot lies no trace of irony or humor. 
Its earnestness is over the top, and he lambasted Shomer, expressed his
unfavorable opinions about the trash novelist without pity, again and again. 

His language (then called Zhargon) of his time and region, is over-seasoned
with many words (alien for us) that intrude like uninvited guests.  One can
get dizzy rummaging in German, Russian, Yiddish and Hebrew dictionaries.  The
spelling is old-fashioned, irregular, and you have to listen closely to
yourself as you read, to the sounds you make while you read.  Sometimes two
words are put together and look like one word.  Sometimes, the reverse. 

Tevye der Milkhiker of 1895 is quiet something else.  It was also written for
other writers and critics and for the Yiddish-reading public.  The spelling is
also old- fashioned but the language is not overburdened with Russian and
German.  Further, one can sense a spirit of humane sympathy. 

A letter to Dubnov of May 29, 1888 (From Zhargon to Yiddish, Vilna: Kletskin,
1929, p. 64) sheds some light on this transformation. 

I enclose my prose poem, The Bunch of Flowers, or The Bouquet.  This is the
first attempt at writing such poems that brings the language to wholeness
without resorting to German or Russian expressions or words.  Please say
something about it in the next volume of Voskhod [a Russian language monthly
for Jewish readers].  Signed, Sholem Aleichem. 

No doubt there are other important background reasons.

Subject: Yiddish for Breastplate

In response to Yankev Lewis (07.151), the Hebrew word for "breastplate" is
found in Exodus 28, v.15, and it is "khoshen".  Checking in Yehoash's Yiddish
translation of the Torah, I found that he uses the same term:  "khoshen".  The
only difference between the two terms is in the spelling.  The Hebrew is
spelled without a "vov" while Yehoash spells it with a "vov".

Subject: Torah Breastplate

Yankev Lewis asked in the latest edition of Mendele what the Yiddish for Torah
breastplate was. I asked in shul yesterday and learnt that the Hebrew was
'choshen' /-chess/vov/shin/mem. My informant thought that the Yiddish word
would be something like 'choishen'. I hope this is of use.
