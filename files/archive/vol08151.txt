Subject: tseylem kop

My friend the Yiddish poet Malke Heifetz-Tussman in teasing me once for
being descended from Litvaks (she was from Ukraine) told me that Litvaks
have to be presented with an argument thoroughly "lengthwise & widthwise" 
(af der leng un af der breyt) before they will finally accept it hence the
image of a "cross".

Subject: tseylem kop

Replying to Faith Jones' query (Vol. 08.148), let me first express delight
that the Vancouver Jewish Folk Choir is reviving the wonderful cantata, "oyb
nit nokh hekher" and wish them great success. 

As to the meaning of "tseylem kop": Harkavy gives two: "cunning blade" (he
means fellow, I think) and "heretic." Nokhum Stutchkoff's Thesaurus (oytser
fun der yidisher shprakh)--a wedding gift my wife and I received in
December, 1950, from Dovid Matis, then city editor of the "morgn frayhayt,"
later of the "forverts"--lists the term under the following categories:
kluger (wise, or cunning, one), apikoyris (heretic), litvak (Lithuanian
Jew--closest meaning in the context of Peretz's story), shvindler
(swindler). All these epithets were leveled at Lithuanian Jews/misnagdim by
khsidim.

Subject: Rhymed phrases and tseylem-kop

For Harvey Varga:  My mother and her cousin Leo (and my grandfather Motl) 
were all native Yiddish speakers, my grandfather from from Gomel and my
mother and her cousin from New York.  They were also all bookkeepers and/or
accountants.  The rhymed phrases they used may have belonged to a subdialect
of family, financial or Gomel origin.  I hope I remember the meanings
correctly. 

Tunkl-munkl - a generic equivalent of any kind of fooling around, but 
especially      sexual fooling around.
Ifke-pifke - financial sleight-of-hand, cooking the ledgers:  "there was some 
ifke-   pifke with the books"
drey-shmey - I believe this was also financial, but I'm not sure.

For Faith Jones:  I am astonished and delighted to hear that someone is
performing "Oyb nit nokh hekher,"  music by M. Rauch and text by Itche
Goldberg.  If her partner could provide me with the music, I would be
ecstatic!  (I have the text already thanks to the generosity of Leonard
Pritkin, who donated his mother Sonia's music the Secular Yiddish Schools in
America Collection at Stanford, where it was made available to me). 

There is a proverb I learned this summer from my teacher Kalmen Weiser which
says: "A litvak hot a tseylem in kop." (literally, A Litvak has a cross
in/on his head).  As I recall, we discussed the fact that Litvaks were
considered fierce rationalists and thus (supposedly) had a greater
propensity for apostasy than less rationalist Jews.  Considering the enmity
between misnagdim and khsidim, I think this meaning fits very well in the
Peretz story.  Perhaps Hershl Hartman or some other native speaker could
comment.  Or perhaps a note to I. Goldberg at "Yidishe Kultur" would be
illuminating...

Subject: rhymes and Yiddish in America

Meyg ikh areinvarfen meine tsvei koppekehs eykht, veygn vos Harvey Vargas hot 
gefreygt, un veygn vos Seth Wolitz shreibt (Vol 8. 148):

One of those oddments of speech that Mr Vargas may have overlooked is 
"hilke-pilke", sometimes known as "baseball"...

In regard to Seth Wolitz's comments on the dragging of feet on the part of
American publishers toward Yiddish writing, I have found that evident almost
every day on listening to classical music. Gott veyss, how many times I will
hear a chansonette in medeival French about a shepherd and his sheep, or a
canzone sung by a Bulgarian tenor about petals blowing in the wind...but a
classical song in Yiddish??Veyss ikh vos!! There are so many beautiful songs
to equal lieder by Schumann or chansons by Poulenc, yet no one seems to know
about them, nor--and this might be far worse--they may KNOW about them, and
deliberately stay away for fear of offending (?) that one listener in Texas
who will then accuse the station of Bolshevism. Can any station owner
honestly say that 95% of the listeners will understand an obscure art song
by an all but unkown German musician of the 17th century? Yet, I am certain
that MORE would be understood by yiddish oriented listeners to art songs in
Yiddish. 
  
Unfortunately, the attitude "out there" prevails: "Yiddish? (followed by a 
mild sneer). "What's that?"

Subject: similarly sounding words 

Concerning Harvey Varga's request for terms or phrases made up of a rhyming
pair (Mendele Vol. 08.148): the term used in my family for what one now sees
in restaurants and supermarkets as egglant pate or baba ghannoush is
"kutshi-mutshi." I have never, of course, seen this word in print (either in
the Hebrew alphabet or YIVO transcription), and I wouldn't hazard an
etymology beyond suggesting the term may derive from the two main
preparation steps (kukhn, mishn). 

This term may well be unique to my family, who seem to have displayed
linguistic creativity in the naming of food items. Another such hapax (as
far as I can tell) was my Zhitomir-born great-grandmother's name for a
matzoh ball: "balobitshka."

I'm looking for the worths of an old Yiddish lullaby:  Put your head on my
knee.  Leg dein Kop auf meine Knie.  Can you help me? 

Kindly regards
