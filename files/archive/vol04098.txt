Subject: Introductions

We are tim oberlander (a yekke) and Julie Martz, the more ernst of the 2
hyper-amateur  Yiddish afficionados. We are recently transplanted in
Vancouver, canada after 2 years in boston and 5 in montreal, canada. We
think mendele is the bee's knees and wish everyone knew and used it..

Avade, hoben mir a klein frage oder tzvey.We are looking for a yiddish
name for our next baby, due december.   we have never seen a collection
or list, published or otherwise, of yiddish names.  Is there one of any
kind obtainable??

Die tzveyte frage iz:is there anyone out there in the Pacific Northwest
or thereabouts who has been or is interested in teaching their young
children Yiddish as folks are wont to do back east? we are not finding
anyone up here who is so inclined and do not have the coyakh to do this
all alone. anyone out there within visiting distance?  if not,
corresponding distance may have to do.

Subject: Der Forverts

Shleyme,  I invited Yosl Mlotek to be the keynote speaker at the siyem
for the 1994 Columbia Yiddish Summer Program.  When he was dictating his
biographical notes to me, he mentioned that he is the writer of "In der
velt fun yidish".  Ir zayt gerekht:  Y. Hamer iz a psevdonim.

Subject: Translating macaronic language?? Oy Vey!

Bob Hoberman's discussion about a paper by his student, Ken Wishnia, is
fascinating (4.097).  My guess is that the one-act play he translated is
Oylem Habe of 1915 about Mr. and Mrs. Cherkis in America, torn from their
roots.  They are pathetically easy marks for a scam.  They are convinced
to buy a share of the world to come from a phony frumer yid and his
shills.  I have just read it again.  It's hilarious with a poignant
undertone.  I once tried to translate it with little real success or
improvement over Mark Schweid's translation.  The macaronic language of
those greenhorns tragically lost in American cultural limbo is _sui
generis_ (her nor, vi in mitn derinen, hakt men arayn a bisl latayn!).
How to render such multilingual speech for English-readers who are mainly
monolingual is a challenge indeed.

To Bob Hoberman: Where will your student's paper be published.  I'd like
to read it.  Was my guess correct?

Subject: Problems of Translation

Let me encourage the Mendelniks whose interest in problems of translation
would give them the energy to work through a major work on these issues
to look at George Steiner's After Babel. Steiner's massive work came out
in 1975 with a revised edition in 1992

    (Steiner, George. After Babel: Aspects Of Language And Translation.
     2nd. P306 .S66 1992)

Subject: Jimmy Cagney--Shabbos goy, oder nit?

In Zellig Bach's posting on non-Jewish Yiddish speakers he mentions Jimmy
Cagney's famous Yiddish monologue in "Taxi".  The story I've always heard
is that he was a fluent speaker, having worked as a shabbos goy in a
Lower East Side shul when he was young.  None of the movie books that I
have close to hand confirm this--any Cagneyphiles out there have the real
scoop?
