Re: Shakeyts & shiksah. A Jewish friend of mine who grew up
in Bessarabia tells me that "goy" and "goyah" are also
pejorative. When her family spoke politely of Gentiles they
used the words "krist" and "kristleche."I don't see how the
word "shvartse" could be considered pejorative.

Subject: Terms for non-Jews

As I was growing up, I understood "sheygets" to be an
INoffensive term for "young non-Jewish male", and "shikse"
likewise inoffensive for "young non-Jewish female."
Apparently, I either misunderstood then, or am
misremembering now, or my relatives (who were ideologically
and fiercely, almost aggressively, non-racist) were
peculiar in their usage.  In any case, "goy" was used
inoffensively for men, and "goye" [U. Weinreich gives
"goyete" as an alternative] for women.

To Debra Halperin Biasca:

We "expect" gezunt and yorn to cooccur and gezint and yurn
to cooccur. If "gezint" and "yorn" cooccur, it's at
locations precisely in the area between Belorussia and the
Ukraine where "libm" ('life') occurs. Most, if not all of
that area, lies within the province of Volhynia. Can you
pursue your grandmother's origins with a map of that area
in mind.

Actually, there's one other town I know of, in Northern
Poland, at the East Prussian border, where "gezint and
yorn" cooccur--Ostrolenka. I suspect that that's irrelevant
in this case.

Subject: tsign un beymer

I often have problems with the meanings of--i.e., don't
undesrtand when one would use--Yiddish proverbs.  One such
is Ignatz Bernstein's (J:udische Sprichw:orte und
Redensarten, 1908) #362:  "Oyf a yungn boym shpringen ale
tsign" (my transcription).  All goats leap onto (or at)
young trees?  There's obviously something I am missing
about goat-tree interactions, and I'm therefore unable to
understand the metaphorical meaning. Ken emetser mir
derklern vos dos shprikvort vil undz zogn?
