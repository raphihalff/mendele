Subject: Introduction

Please start my subscription to the Mendele list.  I have just finished an
intensive course in 'Yiddish for Holocaust Research' taught by Brukhe Lang
Caplan and Marc Caplan at Indiana University and am interested in following
the various Mendele list discussions.  I have a PhD in Modern
European/British History and for my next project I am researching the
Yiddish-speaking Eastern European Jewish refugee population resident in
London between the mid 1930s and the immediate post-war period.

Subject: Introduction

I have joined the group at the behest of Sylvia Schildt.

My area of interest is Litvak genealogy, specifically the Vilna uyezd
[district] within what was Vilna gubernia in Imperial times. I run a
research group for those interested in the shtetls of this particular
area. The Vilna District Research Group is part of the LitvakSIG, which
can be found online at www.jewishgen.org/litvak . For those interested in
Vilna, please visit my Vi lna Shtetlinks page at
www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/vilna/vilna.htm .

The following is a list of our groups past translation projects:
 1858 Revision List [Revizskaya skazka] E28093 1858 census of the Kahal
 1915 Vilna city directory E2809CVsia VilnaE2809D [All Vilna]
 1942 Vilna ghetto census
Graduates of the Vilna 1st gymnasia 1837 - 1903
 1894 Vilna Talmud Torah donors
 The Yizkor book E2809CBleter Vegn VilnaE2809D has been partially tran
slated into
English [50%].
 In a short time, we will have access to most of the vital records [b,m,d]
for the city of Vilna from 1837-1915 as well as for many shtetls including
Nemencin, Antokol, Snipishok and Novygorod. We are seeking to index the name
s contained in the records  to provide a guide for researchers. I have seen
re cords from several years, including 1883. These records are written both
in Russia n [old Cyrillic] and, on the opposite page, in Hebrew/Yiddish. Our
finances are not unlimited, so we cannot afford professional translatio n
resources. We are looking for people who have an interest in
translating/transliterating these records, have a solid grounding in the
languages required, and for whom the pecuniary aspect is not a prime
motivation. Anyone interest ed in participating in this activity should
contact me at Joelrat@aol.com. I can also provide a sample record to those
who express interest.

 A groysn dank.

Subject: botchvines

Can anyone tell me the meaning and origin (as well as the correct
transliteration) of the word I know as `botchvines,' as in the phrase `er
misht kashe mit botchvines'?

Subject:Re: shier nisht

In response to numerous contributions to Mendele 14.009, is it superfluous
to remark that one should not confuse the Germanic 'shier' spelled
phonetically (shin khirek-yud ayin reysh), used in the phrase 'shier nisht'
meaning "almost", "nearly" and the Semitic 'shier' spelled traditionally
(shin [yud] ayin vov reysh) meaning "measure" and "lesson"? So much is
succinctly recorded in Weinreich's dictionary. True, the etymological
origins are not mentioned, but the contrast between phonetic and
traditional spelling should suffice to make this clear. Incidentally, the
semasiological connection between the two Hebrew senses is that a lesson is
viewed as a measure of learning.

Subject: 	shier nisht

a) Matthias Lexer, Mittelhochdeutsches W”rterbuch, lists the Middle High
German word "schier" and glosses it, among others, 'beinahe', i.e.,
'almost'. Evidently, the word no longer exists in modern German.

b) Uriel Weinreich does not conflate "shier" 'almost' (spelled shin
khirik-yud ayin reysh), of German origin, and "shier" 'lesson; limit,
measure' (spelled shin yud ayin vov reysh), of Hebrew origin - they are two
different entries. He does list both Hebrew-origin meanings in one entry,
and they are apparently of a single etymology, even though the meanings are
quite different. Interestingly, Ernest Klein, Etymological Dictionary of
Hebrew, says that the meaning 'measure, limit' is post-biblical, whereas the
meaning 'lesson' is modern Hebrew.

c) As the discussants have already noted, "Vifl iz der shier?" and "on a
shier" are etymologically unrelated to "shier nisht" and should not be
confused.

Subject: Seeking Yiddish Magazines for Children

I don't know if you can post my query on Mendele.  I am seeking copies of
the children's Yiddish magazine published in Wilno (Vilna in Yiddish)
between 1918-1940 called di grininke beymalekh.   I am also seeking copies
of children's Yiddish magazines and Yiddish writings for children from
Argentina.  If anyone wants to donate them to me or sell them to me, I will
be happy to hear from you.
