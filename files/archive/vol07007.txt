Subject: More on romanization

Now that this issue has been reopened again (and addressed by Zellig
Bach), I would like to push it just a bit farther.

I am not trying to challenge the YIVO system here; I would just like
to understand the origins of the system a bit better.  The immediate
focus here was the suggestion to write "ah", etc., instead of the
standard "a".  The argument was that this spelling would appear more
phonetic to an English-speaking reader, who (without the "h") might
mispronounce "shames", for instance, as "sheymz".  I agree that this
argument should be rejected, on the grounds that English spelling
conventions have no bearing on Yiddish.  In fact, I doubt that the
inventors of the YIVO system even considered this argument.

On the other hand, it was once common to insert the "h" in Yiddish
Romanizations, on the model of *German* spelling.  In fact, the whole
apparatus of German spelling conventions has been used for Yiddish,
probably on the basis of the close historical origins of these two
languages.  But here too the practice should be (and was) rejected
(along with "sch-" and all the other Germanisms).  After all, Yiddish
has its own spelling conventions that evolved over centuries in the
Hebrew alphabet and are quite independent of German.

Nonetheless, the German "h" after a vowel serves a useful purpose: to
distinguish long vowels from short.  Wasn't it once common, prior to
modern spelling reforms, for Yiddish writers to use the Hebrew letter
hey in just this way?  Now the standard spelling, in both alphabets,
is based on the standard pronunciation, which (from what I have read
on this list and elsewhere) is somewhat synthetic, but largely based
on the NEY (litvish) dialect.  Now I am not very familiar with that
dialect, but I know that the short-long distinction is quite important
in CY (Polish) and SEY (Ukrainian) dialects.  So I have always been
quite surprised that the standard spelling does not make this
distinction.  For example, "zun" is spelled the same, whether it's
"der zun" or "di zun".

So my question is:  is the short-long distinction really lost in NEY,
as spoken colloquially by native speakers?  Or was it simply ignored
in the definition of the standard language?  And was there controversy
over this question at the time?

Subject: Yiddish literature in romanized form

As a novice to the subject, I would like to know whether there is any
Yiddish literature (especially poetry) available in romanized form
(Latin characters).

Any hint to books or Internet ressources is highly appreciated. Thank
you very much for your help!

Subject: What's that song?

In the movie "Yidl mitn Fidl" immediately following the wedding scene,
there is a scene where the escaping bride performs with the musicians.

The words of the song are something like (please forgive all the
errors):

        Oy, hert zikh ayn mayne libe mentshn
        Oy, hert zikh tsu atsinder, tsu mayn troyrik lidl
        Fun ale mentshn zog ikh, aza groysen veytik
        In aza kleyne, kleyne fidl.

Does anyone know more about this song?  What is its name? Is it a well
known folk song or was it written specifically for the movie?  If it
is original, who are the writers?

Our band, Macedonian Mazl-Tov is interested in recording a version of
this song and we need to find out as much information about its source
as we can.

Please help.  Many Thanks.

Subject: Versions of "Papirosn"

We are trying to track down some information about the famous Yiddish
song "Papirosn".

Apparently the song is based on some Russian folk melody, which one?
We think that a famous Yiddish actor, Yablokoff, brought it to
America. But then, did he also write the Yiddish lyrics (A kalte
nakht...)? Are there alternative Yiddish lyrics to this song?

Our search through SOCAN (the Canadian Composers association) shows 4
public domain versions of Papirosn and 2 versions licensed to
Yablokoff.  Which is which?

Can anyone shed light on the history of this song?

Many Thanks

Lisa Tomlinson

Subject: Lufmentsh and Menakhem-Mendl

Mechl Asheri (7.005, 1) claims that the name Menakhem-Mendl was not
associated with the idea of the luftmentsh.  For readers of Sholem
Aleichem, since 1892, more so in 1903 until now (but not in 1888), the
name Menakhem-Mendl evoked the archetypal luftmentsh.  I was obviously
talking (7.004, 5) about the world of Yiddish literature (rarely
discussed, it seems, these days in Mendele), while (I assume) Mechl
Asheri wrote of the world of Lubavitch and other religious movements.
I must accept his facts as correct no doubt, but they hardly relate to
my subject matter.

Incidentally, I suggest to him we owe each other the common  courtesy
of spelling each others' names correctly.  Mine is spelled
Fridhandler.
