Subject: Kein bischen Risches

Dr. Herzog,

adjectives in Aramaic are normally in the "QAttil" form, so much so,
that there is a yod indicating the short i (Qattiyl).

TzAddik, CHAkkim, SAggiy (numerous), and many more, including
RAshshi'a: that is resh-patach-shin (dagesh)-chirik-ayin-chataf
patach. See: Beyer, Klaus 'Die aramaeischen Texte vom Toten Meer'
Goettingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1984, p. 435.

The feminine form adds -tav-kametz-aleph/hey (depending on orthogr.)
CHakkimtah, Tzaddiktah, Rashshi'a:tah see also Levy's Talmudic
dictionary.

in Hebrew, of course, the feminine of rasha' is re:sha'ah Levy
mentions "malkhut hare:sha'ah"
(resh-sheva-shin-kometz-ayin-kometz-hey)

2. re: Mechutantah

my question is, how do you know that this is Hebrew with Aramaic
ending, and not straight Aramaic? i.e. How else would be: mechutenet
+ -ah (def. article)

On the other hand, according to Levy, the entire mechutan business
is "spaetrabbinisch" which is his way of saying post-Talmudic, or
medieval. Thus, I think, it can be anything.

Subject: Speech synthesis

To: Michael Braten

The DECTALK program available for ENGLISH is possible because of
years of research into the acoustic analysis of English speech, the
testing of perceptual hypotheses by means of synthetic speech, and
the development of rules for the synthesis of intelligible English
speech. I am not aware that anyone has done this for Yiddish. One
scientist, Dr. Asher Laufer of the Department of Hebrew Language,
The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, is the only one I know about who
has done extensive work on the synthesis of modern Hebrew. Perhaps
he can tell you whether such a system is available for practical
use. I don't have his e-mail address here at home or in my computer
directory. I may be able to get it for you tomorrow.

Subject: Vos zol m'heysen a "gay" af yidish?

It's puzzled me for quite a while that there still seems to be no
contemporary term for gay/lesbian people in Yiddish.  The Forverts
still uses "homoseksualist", which has the same negative (i.e.,
medicalized, distancing) connotations as "homosexual" does in
English.  Most languages that I know of have dealt with this problem
either by just adopting the English word, with perhaps a twist of
spelling (e.g., gai in French), translated it (khush in Hindi), or
used an already existing native word for gay person (flikker in
Dutch, schwul in German).

In Yiddish "gey" is already a commonly used verb form, which
complicates matters.  How about either a translation "a freylikher",
or the good old (American?) Yiddish "feygele"?  Although used
contemptuously for the most part, it could certainly be proudly
reclaimed, like "queer"--it's a nice image, and the diminutive gives
it an affectionate sound.  Does anyone know the etymology of this
word, or seen it used in Yiddish literature? Anyway, appreciate
people's comments and suggestions--if we get a consensus, we can
submit it to the Yiddish Academy (YIVO?, Morkhe Schaekhter?).

By the by, any other gay/les/bi Yidishistn out there?  Love to hear
from any "freylikhe khaverim". Meyshe-Yankl (Michael Sweet)
