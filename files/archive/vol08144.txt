Subject: mezinke

Ida Selavan-Schwarz's comment on "mezinke" (08.139) reflects the word for
"little finger"--that is, the YOUNGEST child--being wed. And it occurs to me
that over the centuries, "leyzen" and "leynen"--both from Germanic and Latin
--were used as the infinitive for "to read", the former for secular readings
and the latter for liturgical. Possibly the "leynen" derived from Hispanic
Jews who brought "leer"--to read--or "leyendo"--reading--into central Europe
via France (aside to Sidney Belman).

Subject: Mezinke tantz

Der Mezinke tantz is of very old Eastern European/Hassidic origin.  It is
danced only at a wedding where the bride or groom (or both) is/are the last
in their family to be married ... It is danced for/around that child's
parents ... as for the symbolism of the broom -- I have been told that it is
in celebration of the parents' good fortune in "sweeping" their house clean
(of children and the responsibilities that go with children).

Subject: Mezinke Tants

Ida Selaven-Schwarcz asks about Mezinke Tants (08.139).  I have seen this
done at many weddings going back much longer that I care to admit. I do not
believe that it is restricted to the Ukraine. The weddings i have seen it at
have not been from the Ukraine but have been from various parts of Russia
and Eastern Europe. I would rather doubt that it would also be a Sephardic
custom, but who knows?

Subject: Der Dishvasher

In response to Anne and Louis Rublin's request for the complete words and 
sheet music for a Yiddish song titled "Der Dishwasher" (Vol. 08.140) - I own 
the original 1934 sheet music with a dashing picture of the composer, Herman 
Yablokoff (nee Chaim Yablonik) on the cover.  The complete lyrics are there 
in a quirky Germanized transliteration (e.g., _Ich wash mit meine shwache 
hent_) which I will herewith set forth in standard YIVO orthography:
                        (1)
In a restoran - hob ikh gezen
An altn man - in kitchn shteyn.
Arum im rasht - er redt kayn vort,
Er shteyt un vasht - di dishes dort.
Un mit gefil brumt er shtil:
                [Chorus]
Ikh vash, mit mayne shvakhe hent,
Ikh vash, un vash, fardinen a por sent.
Fun fri biz shpet, far a trukn shtikl broyt,
Ikh vash un bet, oyf zikh aleyn dem toyt! 
                        (2)
Amol geven - mit mentchn glaykh,
Gehat a heym - gevezn raykh.
Geven iz dan - der tate gut,
Itst bin ikh alt - keyner darf mir nit,
Un in dem rash, shtey ikh un vash - - (Repeat Chorus)
                        (3)
Kh'hob kinder fir - gebildet groys,
Di eydems, shnir - varfn mikh aroys.
Mayn tokhter fayt ["fight"??] - ikh zol geyn tsum zun,
Mayn zun er shrayt - er ken gornit tun.
Un in dem rash, shtey ikh un vash - - (Repeat Chorus)

Subject: khoshever fodem

Can someone parse the expression "khoshever fodem" or "koshere fodem" for
me?  The individual words are clear enough: kosher thread. But what is their
idiomatic meaning? A friend remembers them as part of a disparaging
expression and I think that I recall the words in some song lyrics. Thank
you one and all.

Subject: galkhes/galkes

It's been said that etymologizing is a Yiddish speaker's sport. Sam 
Kweskin's assertions (08.141) demonstrate its dangers.

In Yiddish, Hebrew origin _galkhes_ designates the Latin alphabet; in
Hebrew, it refers to 'Christian priesthood';  cf. _galakh_ 'Christian
(tonsured) priest'. 
 
Slavic-origin _goln zikh_ 'to shave' and _gol_/_hoyl_ (as in _a goln/hoyln
kop_ 'bareheaded') are of Slavic origin, unrelated Hebrew-origin_galkhes_

Similarly Slavic-origin _galkes/halkes_ 'small balls' ('snowballs' if you
like); and one of many regional designations for 'stuffed cabbage rolls'
have nothing to do with _galakh/galkhes_.

Subject: Indefinite article

Re Mikhoyel Basherives (8.135) and Noyekh Miller (8.139) on "eyn" (or
"ayn"?)  for "an" or "one" -- this is perhaps not 100% to the same point,
but for what it's worth: 

I've been plowing slowly through "di ershte komune" by Sholem-Aleykhem (very
slowly, what with my Yiddish and the old orthography) and was confused by
the same "eyn" vs. "an". But I think in this case it is just a matter of the
spelling of the period. 

"eyn" (as in "one (1)") is spelled shtumer-alef/tsvey yudn/langer nun, like
now. Thus, the character's name "shoyn-EYN-mol-moyshe" and the phrase "EYN
mol far ale mol". 

"an" (as in the indefinite article, however it would have been pronounced
and/or transliterated) is spelled PASAKH-ALEF/tsvey yudn/langer nun. Thus
the sentence: "nokh pesakh iz der tate gegangen iber der shtot zukhn AN
ander dire af tsu dingen". 

Needless to say, there isn't a pasakh-tsvey-yudn in sight and I've left out
a whole bunch of extra hey's, daled's, and ayen's. The book was published in
1918 by the Sholem-Aleykem Folksfund Edition, New York.

Subject: Yiddish Club Formation

Feigel Glaser's reply to Sandra Tobias in Mendele vol 8.141 for advice on
starting a Yiddish club is excellent. It may be worthwhile to add several
good dictionaries-definitely Weinreichs's and also Galvin's romanized
version.

Have each person subscribe to a different Yiddish publication and then
report on an article in the publication. Try to include the Yiddish Forward,
NYBC, YIVO, League for Yiddish, Yugntruf, YKUF, and Zukunft, for they are
all very reasonably priced. Several of the Yiddish clubs also have excellent
newsletters with club activities. 

Each club has a distinct personality. Some just get together to shmooze some
are serious about learning Yiddish while others just want to be entertained.
Visit the wonderful Yiddish web sites for additional information. 

Once you are underway, you should join the International Association of
Yiddish Clubs, for they have great conferences and club materials.  Also,
attend the wonderful, regional, Yiddish conferences, festivals and weekends.

Subject: Zangwill

I wish to respond to Linda Conti who is considering taking Israel Zangwill
as subject for her thesis. 

The project seems very worthwhile.  Zangwill was an important writer and,
even though he wrote in English, he understood how important Yiddish was in
the life of English Jews.  His novel "Children of the Ghetto", for example,
uses Yiddish words, phrases, and expressions that are an essential element
in the book. In doing this, he championed Yiddish as a literary medium. 

Zangwill also had a special love for Italy, which he visited many times.  I
wish Linda Conti success in her undertaking.
