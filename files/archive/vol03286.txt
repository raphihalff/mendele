Subject: Game-"Orde,borde,shorde"

I'm passing on this question from Pamela Hitchcock.  She's researching
the song 'Harshl' for her performance.  The song is about a gangster in
Warsaw in the 1930s.  There's a reference to the game "Orde, borde,
shorde," which a translation says is tic-tac-toe.  Is anyone familiar
with this game?  Is it a version of tic-tac-toe, and if not, what is it?

Subject: Parpar in Hebrew

Michael Shimshoni...having checked dictionaries finds that parpar doesn't
imply homosexual in Hebrew...well, I didn't ever read it in a dictionary,
admittedly, but I'm quite certain that as I've heard it used by not so PC
family members and friends that they mean homosexual... sometimes it's
used to imply that the man being called a parpar is effeminate....maybe
my experience with this word is an oysnam....

Subject: Nebakh and nebbish

I'm not so sure these two aren't related.  It's true that the kh-sh
alternation is not common in Yiddish, but it's plausible in
Juedischdeutsch. (Juedischdeutsch is the strongly Jewish-flavored German
used by Jews in Germany among themselves, containing elements from
Western Yiddish and Hebrew/Aramaic.) A German Jewish colleague (right now
I don't remember where exactly he's from) here tells me that in his
native speech the word is pronounced as if it were spelled Nebbich, that
is, with the palatal "ich-Laut" (i'll write it as /ch/) which is between
/sh/ and /kh/.  In his speech /ch/ sounds very close to /sh/, much closer
than in some German pronunciations.  He assumes, and this seems
reasonable to me, that /nebich/ was heard as having /sh/ by
English-speakers in America, and repeated that way.   Furthermore, in my
father-in-law's German dialect (Hessen, near Frankfurt), the "ich-Laut"
has become identical to /sh/, so that "ich" and "Fisch" rhyme perfectly.
So the shift /nebakh/ to /nebich/ to /nebish/ could have taken place
entirely within Juedischdeutsch.  The test of this theory would be to see
whether Nebbich is attested in German Jewish language or nebbish in
English before the big E-European immigration of the 1880's and after.

A bit of Juedischdeutsch humor: about someone my Litvak parents might
call a Meyshe Kapeyer, who does everything backwards and wrong, you say:
Taanes esst er, Purim fast er 'on a fast day he eats and on Purim he
fasts' (a pun on Taanis Ester, the Fast of Esther just before Purim).

Subject: Tsevi Hirsh Chajes

Khaverim oyf Mendele:

	A colleague of mine has been wracking his brains over the
spelling of a rabbinical scholar.  I have twice tried to forward his
appeal to Men- dele, but without luck (I do not know how to send messages
and append comments).  This time I write directly.

	"Could you help me find the correct form of the name for the 19th
century rabbinical scholar Z.H. Chajes?  The Encyclopedia Judaica and the
introduction to the English translation of his work, _Student's_Guide_to_
the_Talmud_, both give his name as Zevi (or Tsevi) Hirsch Chajes.  The
Library of Congress, however, gives his name as Zebi Hirsch Chajes.  Do
you know of any reason why the name could be spelled with these two
differing forms? He was born in Galicia in 1805. "Any help you can give
me would be greatly appreciated."

	If anyone can help, but for some reason does not want to post an
answer on the network, my colleague Joe Ross can be reached at:
JTRoss@ucs.Indiana.edu.

	A sheynem dank far di hilf,

	Jay Lee

Subject: Feygele debate

In the recent discussion of Yiddish references to homosexuality, at least
one colloquial term current in pre-war Eastern Europe has as yet gone
unmentioned.  According to Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter of Columbia University
and the League for Yiddish, the word "fraymayer" (literally, "freemason")
was used before the war in his heym-shtot of Chernovits to mean male
homosexual.  As a slang term, this seems to carry a heavy dose of irony,
but not necessarily derision. Connotations of the word in this context
include exoticism (Freemasonry in its original sense was an institution
not well-known in this part of Eastern Europe), mystery (as in membership
in a secret society), and cosmopolitanism, but not, apparently,
subjection to discrimination, despite various instances of persecution
against Freemasons.  Lesbians were not indicated by this usage, Dr.
Schaechter says, because such people were not even imagined in his
circles.

Additionally, I would like to announce the upcoming publication of my
article on gay subtext in the Yiddish cinema, "A YINGL MIT A YINGL HOT
EPES A TAM":  THE CELLULOID CLOSET OF YIDDISH FILM, coming out in the
Media Issue of The Journal of Jewish Folklore & Ethnography later this
year.  Examples cited are from such classic titles as YIDL MITN FIDL, DER
DIBUK, AMERICANER (sic) SHADKHN, and DER VILNER SHTOT-KHAZN.  The title
of the paper is a quotation from one of Molly Picon's lines in "Yidl."

Subject: re shmushkele

Before Michael Sweet maligns his mother further re "shmushkele" I seem to
recall that the Polish word for "pacifier" (i.e. the gadgets babies suck)
is "shmuchik". I therefore wouldn't vouch for his etymology.

Arre Komar.
