Subject: Hometowns

While most Mendelniks are from the U.S., the list has also received or is
receiving messages people in:

Argentina	Australia	Austria		Belgium
Britain		Canada		Finland		France
Germany		Israel		Italy		Netherlands
New Zealand	Poland		South Africa	ex-Soviet Union

There may be more. This covers the period during which I've been a
subscriber (since June 1993).

Country of origin can usually be determined from an email address by
inspecting the last two characters: e.g., "il"=IsraeL; "ca"=CAnada;
"de"=DEutschland; etc.

Subject: Bakent, derkent, bakant

Perhaps the distinction that Arre Komar suggests can be expressed more
accurately  as follows:

_mir hobn zikh (in his dialect _undz_) bakent_
'We got to know one another'

_mir hobn zikh derkent_
'We recognized one another'

_zey zaynen mir/undz bakant_
'They are familiar to me/us'

Subject: der/bakenen, possessive & refl. pronouns, "component consciousness"

To Arre Komar:

a) _bakenen_ and its variants means 'to acquaint'.  It does not mean
'recognize'. 'Recognize' is _derkenen_.  The distinction you mention is
probably misremembered. (Which Yiddish dictionary do you consult, by the
way?)

b) I surmise that Reb Arre studied German at some point in his life (is
this right?) and perhaps used/s it actively.  Your proficiency in that
language seems to have interfered with the Yiddish spoken to you at home.
How can I tell?

	i. in Yiddish, the possessive pronoun (mayn, dayn, zayn, ir,
undzer, ayer, zeyer) is not inflected for agreement when it precedes a
singular noun (or noun phrase), so _MAYN eygene mame_, not *mayne eygene
mame.  (A star next to an example in this context means 'ungrammatical'.)
In German, however, this would be correct.  [To the specialist:  I'm
ignoring "mass nouns" in "Lithuanian Yiddish", e.g. mayne gelt, dayne
vaser.]  The possessive pronoun is only inflected for plural agreement,
so _mayne eygene kroyvim_ but *mayn eygene/eygn kroyvim.

	ii. in German, _wir waschen uns_, but in Yiddish:  _mir vashn
zikh_ or in the dialects that haven't made it into written Yiddish:  undz
vash(t)'mir zikh, mir vash(t)'mir zikh.  I think these are the correct
facts.  In all of these, however, the reflexive pronoun is _zikh_ in both
1st person singular ('I') *AND* 1st person plural ('we').  Your example,
*mir hobn undz bakent/ bakant is _mir hobn zikh bakent/bakant_ in
Yiddish.

c) M. Weinreich's point was actually that what he called
"komponentn-visikayt" (there's no letter "g" in the word) was a problem
for the status of the language.  It seems that Ashkenazic Jews,
throughout their thousand years of Yiddish use, have usually had some (or
a lot of) knowledge of one or more other languages at the same time --
languages which contributed to their Yiddish lexicon/morphology/
phonology/syntax.

Thus, individual speakers and the group as a whole have been more aware
of the origin of the forms of their language than speakers of other
languages usually are. The English speaker might not know or ever pay
attention to the fact that the English words _book_ and _table_ are
(respectively) Germanic and Romance in origin; but the Yiddish speaker is
more aware of the languages from which his/her language is derived since
chances are great that s/he might know, say, (some of) a Slavic language
and (some) Hebrew.  E.g., s/he might know that the Yiddish word _zhabe_
'frog' is _z.aba_ in Polish and the Yiddish word _shabes_ is _shabos_ in
(Ashkenazic) Hebrew.

While the English-speaker goes about his business of speaking what s/he
calls the *English* *language*, the Yiddish speaker has often questioned
the languagehood of Yiddish since it might look to him/her that it uses
the words of other languages or "has no words of its own" for certain
concepts -- or even that all of its words belong to different languages.

(At the recent YIVO gathering in honor of Max Weinreich's 100th birthday,
Prof. Benjamin Harshav -- formerly Hrushovski -- seems not to have
understood that _table_ is the English word for 'table' as well as the
French word for 'table'; for him, the Yiddish word _tish_ is "German"
and, in fact, the Yiddish word _promine'nt_ is German. Leaves you wonder
how to say 'table' in English and 'table' in Yiddish. Leaves you
wondering whether English is a language, whether Yiddish is a language,
or whether any language is a language.  A strange conception,indeed.)

Subject: _Apikoyres_

Sam Juni glosses the word _apikoyres_ as 'heathen', 'atheist'. It's
neither. It's more accurately glossed 'heretic', one who holds opinions
contrary to established religious beliefs.  Not the same thing at all.

I once made the mistake of referring to myself as an _apikoyres_ and was
quickly upbraided for my presumptuousness. One must first be a
_talmid-khokhem_ before one becomes an _apikoyres_.

Subject: Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Yiddish

Some of you may be surprised to hear that the young Goethe was an ardent
scholar of Yiddish and Hebrew. One result of his studies is his
"Judenpredigt", a droshe written in the west-yiddish he learned in
Frankfurt (he had private teachers coming to his home).

Here it is:

"Sagen de Goyen wer haetten kae Koenig, kae Kaeser, kae Zepter, kae Kron;
do will ich aech aber beweise dass geschrieben staeht: dass wer haben aeh
Koenig, aeh Kaesr, aeh Zepter aeh Kron. Aber wo haben wer denn unsern
Kaeser? das will aech och sage. Do drueben ueber de grosse grause rote
Meer. Und do waere dreimalhunerttausend Johr vergange sei, do werd aeh
grosser Mann, mit Stiefle und Spore grad aus, sporenstrechs gegange komme
uebers grosse grause rote Meer, und werd in der Hand habe aeh Horn, und
was denn ver aeh Horn? aeh Duet-Horn. Und wenn der werd ins Horn duete,
do waeren alle Juedlich die in hunerttausend Johren gepoeckert sind, die
waeren alle gegange komme ans grosse grause rote Meer. No was sogt ehr
dozu? Un was aeh gross Wonner sei werd, das will ich aech och sage: Er
werd geritte komme of aeh grosse schneeweisse Schimmel; un was aeh Wonner
wenn dreimalhunertunneununneunzigtausend Juedlich waere of den Schimmel
sitze, do waeren se alle Platz habe; un wenn aeh enziger Goye sich werd
ach drof setze wolle, do werd aeh kenen Platz finne. No was sogt ehr
dozu? Aber was noch ver aeh greser Wonner sei werd, das well ich aech och
sage: Un wenn de Juedlich alle waere of de Schim- mel sitze, do werd der
Schimmel Kerze gerode seine grosse grosse Waetel ausstrecke, do waeren de
Goye denke: kennen mer nich of de Schimmel setze wer uns of de Waetel.
Und denn waere sich alle of de Waetel nuf hocke;  Un wenn se alle traf
setzen, un der grosse schnee weisse Schimmel werd gegange komme dorchs
grause rote Meer zorick, do werd aeh de Waetel falle lasse, un de Goye
werde alle ronder falle ins grosse grause rote Meer. No was sogt ehr
dozu?"

Nu, un vos zogt ir Mendelniks zudem?

Ruben Frankenstein
