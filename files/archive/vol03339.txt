Subject: Western Yiddish

In reply to Yude Rozof's questions on Mendele 3.337.

Yude Rozof's proposal to include Western Yiddish into the Yiddish family
since "the language of the Ashkenazim may be viewed as an East-West
continuum" is well intentioned, but makes the Western Ashkenazi raise his
(her) eyebrows. For centuries we've known that our eastern brothers and
sisters spoke the same language as we did, and we exported Yiddish books
to them. This worked rather well because of the West-East (!) continuum.
The standard literary language was based on Western Yiddish and
differences in pronunciation were masked by a standard orthography wich
did not reflect the dialectal differences.

Except for those who insisted that Jews in the German lands spoke perfect
German, and that the language was "corrupted" in the East by Polish Jews,
scholars have always thought that Yiddish was one language, divided into
dialects. The two main dialects are Western and Eastern Yiddish. The
boundary between the two is defined according to the isogloss a:24/44 (a:
is a long a). The numbers refer to a system devised by Max Weinreich and
represent hypothetical vowels in proto Yiddish which I can't transcribe
properly without the phonetic alphabet, but I'll try: vowel 24 or E4
refers to *ej (shwa-j). Vowel 44 or O4 refers to proto Yiddish *ou (open
o-u). a:24/44 means that speakers of Western Yiddish say _ka:fn_ and
_fla:sh_ (Standard Yiddish _koyfn_ and _fleysh_).

There are also lexical boundaries between East and West, e.g.
_davnen/orn_ 'pray' and _sider/tfile_ 'prayer book'

Yiddish in Germany was identified as a separate language from
coterritorial German by the first Christian scholars who devoted
attention to the language of the Jews, e.g. Johann Buxtorf the Elder in
his _Thesaurus Grammaticus Linguae Stanctae Hebraeae_ (1609). He is the
first in a line of speakers of German whose interest in the languae of
the Jews led them to do serious research into Yiddish.

Since the beginning of this century much has been written about Western
Yiddish and once the complete Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic
Jewry is published, we will all be able to have a better insight into the
distribution of the dialects. Untile then, it might be interesting to
have a look Beranek's language atlas (Westjiddischer Sprachatlas, 1965)
although that book has serious flaws, or read some of the many articles
about Western Yiddish dialectology, e.g. Florence Guggenheim-Gruenberg
and Johannes Brosi on Yiddish in Switzerland, Richard Zuckerman on
Alsatian Yiddish, Hans-Peter Althaus and Ulrike Kiefer on Yiddish in
Germany, Hartog Beem on Dutch Yiddish, and Uriel Weinreich, Paul Garvin,
C.J. Hutterer, and Pavel Trost on Yiddish in Hungary and Czechoslovakia
(and others I can't think of at the moment - my apologies, this is not a
reflection on their work but on my memory at this late hour). And then
there are studies on the dialectology of pre-modern Western Yiddish...

There are also some overview articles on Yiddish dialectology which pay
attention to Western Yiddish, from Uriel Weinreich's brief and clear
remarks in his article "Yiddish Language" in the _Encyclopedia Judaica_
to Dovid Katz's "Zur Dialektologie des Jiddischen" in Werner Besch a.o.,
eds., _Dialektologie_ (1983).

P.S. Yes, the Western Yiddish verb did have a preterite.

Subject: Yiddish /R/ in Russian

To: "V.U. Novick" <mendele@YaleVM.YCC.Yale.Edu>

Varna, Your explanation is surely right. It is notorious among Russians
of a certain generation that Jews use a Yiddish /R/ (probably uvular) in
their Russian, yet, as you say, there are those who don't. The "genetic"
explanation is, if I may say so, just silly.

Subject: Introduction

I am the last generation to have spent my youth in Philadelphia,
conversing with my parents in Yiddish, reading the Yiddish daily papers
and listening to the nightly news in Yiddish.

Just a few weeks ago I attended a concert featuring the son of the old
Yiddish Theatre actor, Jules Adler. It was a delight for me, but when he
asked for a show of hands of those who understood Yiddish, no one under
65 raised their hand.

I look forward to sharing the Joy of Yiddish with you.

Subject: zhid and zhidlen

I recently came across the word 'zhidlen' which Weinreich renders as to
curse or to call names. Does this in turn come from 'zhid'? As a
derivative question, it seems that zhid is a perfectly respectable word
for Jew in Polish but is essentially 'kike' in Russian usage where the
preferred polite term is 'ivrey'.

Questions? Why would Yiddish adopt an insulting term for Jews if in fact
zhidlen is negative and derived from Russian use of the word?

Why is zhid respectable in Polish, where it seems to have been invented
but insulting in Russian?

Is this a general pattern of Russian borrowing from Polish such that
words take on very different nuance once borrowed?  Are there other
instances of the same phenomenon?

Subject: "fritshunes"?

I have been asked to translate a handwritten letter dated January 26,
1958 from a woman in the Soviet Union (perhaps near Minsk) to her sister
in the US. After noting that she hasn't written in 10 years, she writes
"Nor ikh gleyb az du vest mistame farshteyn az s'iz given alerley
FRITShUNES velkhe hobn nisht gigebn di meglekhkayt shraybn.  Nor yetst iz
gekumen di tsayt vider zikh farbinden tsvishn zikh als fraynt."  Can
someone help with "fritshunes"?  I can't find it in either Harkavy or
Weinreich.  (Either of the first two vowels could be yud or vov, and I
suppose the first letter could be pey rather than fey.)

A dank.

Subject: Kortn

Many thanks to Odem Vaytman for his query about card names.  His
reference to 'pik' (spade) led me to the dictionaries because we used
'shippe' at home.  Not found in Weinreich but Harkavy gives it as
'shiffe' (a typo?) and Stutchkoff says 'shippe' (cf. ModG Schippe).

Ober dos iz in gantsn nisht oysn.  Odem's question got me to open
Stutchkoff zikhroynoy l'brokhe.  To open S. is to open a world.  There's
no better way of disabusing those whose notion of east European Jews is
limited to shuls and shul-going than to read even a portion of the
Yiddish words and terms for cards and card-playing.

I was trained to believe that Richard Lee Whorf was right, though I
learn that the current wisdom is that he was wrong.  Maybe if he had
concentrated on Yiddish instead of Eskimo languages things would have
worked out differently.  He couldn't have of course because the library
he used, now at Trinity, didn't then and doesn't now have a Yiddish
collection.

Anyway, given the lively discussion about Hebrew and Yiddish in recent
numbers of Mendele here are some that ought not be overlooked in any
reshime.  My guesses, not definitions, are in parentheses.  Please
correct as necessary.

hilchos-kortn
kortn-shas
godel tseve (trump)
shney zeysim
shrage (full house)
zogn tikn (play late into the night)
provn khatzes (ditto)
mbulbul zayn (shuffle)
magbie zayn (cut the deck)
makke zayn
aroysgen b'kharboy ub'kashtoy
tseyln sfire (count sevens)
vayhi erev vayhi poyker
eyn khokhme v'eyn tvune kneged shlekhte kortn

Finally one that isn't Hebrew but which I couldn't resist:

Ludmer (Ludmirer) moyd (queen of diamonds)
