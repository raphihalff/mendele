Subject: Yiddish in Universities

I would like to know how many universities have for-credit Yiddish
courses.  Obiviously there is no way to get a figure that includes
every college in the world, but an approximate number would suffice.

Also, could anyone list the universities that have major Yiddish
programs (ie, offer Yiddish language and literature courses, have
full-time faculty, etc.)

Subject: Introduction

I am currently attending McGill University and am taking an
introductory Yiddish course this year.  I found out about this
through my Yiddish teacher who, as of yet, I don't think is on this
list...

I'm not exactly sure how much I can contribute as my conversational
Yiddish is at best marginal...  Az ich vell gepruven tzu chapn a

Subject:  Learning Yiddish

I also found 'Learning Yiddish in Easy Stages' very useful as a
first text before Weinreich's College Yiddish. I find
Zuckerman/Herbst's text particularly useful if you're also learning,
as I was, the letters (the print quality in Weinreich is a torture
to the eyes, e.g. p. 26 with its inkblots, my only problem with this
text). I now use Weinreich and, although I study only at home (not
good for spoken Yiddish!), I very much like the book. Is there an
alternative at that level?

While we're on the topic, has anyone heard anything of 'Yiddish, an
Introduction to the Language, Literature & Culture' by Sheva Zucker.
It was in the 1993 catalog of the Jewish Book Center of the
ArbeterRing, but is not in the 1994 one. When I tried to order it in
early summer, I was told it was delayed. Since, nothing.

Finally, does the NYBC really exist? I've written twice to them,
still have no answer. The latest address I have is 48 Woodbridge
St., South Hadley, MA.

Subject: Introduction

	My name is Steve (Schmuel) Silbert.  I am an engineer in the
Mid-Atlantic.  My interest in Yiddish has come about for two
reasons, both of which can be traced back to my Zeide.

	As long as I can remember, Zeide has told me stories about
when he was growing up on the family farm in Hamilton, Ontario.  His
parents (Alle Hashalom) spoke no English, only Yiddish.  He and his
multitude of siblings grew up speaking Yiddish in the home and
english outside.  My Zeide is a gifted (although not always 100
percent accurate) storyteller and writer.  As he has gotten along in
years I began to feel closer to him.  I think that with his eventual
passing, both of us were afraid that much of the family history and
the history of our people would be lost.  Because of this, I began
to TRY and write letters to he and Bubbie in Yiddish.  Without any
real training, it takes about two weeks of spare time to translate
about one page of Yiddish.  As a side note, I have since purchased a
program for Windows called Heb Type from Kabbalah Software that has
the Hebrew character set and works as a Yiddish word processor.  My
Yiddish is good enough that Zeide recognizes it as Yiddish, but my
grammar is non-existent.  He still shows off my letters to his
friends at the local shule gatherings (except the one letter that I
wrote everything backwards -- it took Zeide a little while to figure
out my secret code)

	Since I was married two years ago, I have gotten the
genealogy bug from my Zeide.  He started working on a family tree
and newsletter in the early 80's but that died off due to a lack of
the funds necessary to mail each letter.  I have taken on the task
of tracking down lost relatives, obtaining stories, etc.  As I began
to talk to some of the older relatives i found that though they
spoke English it was more meaningful to them that I could understand
at least some of a Yiddish conversation.  I also found that the
stories were conveyed in a warmer, more expressive and meaningful
way when they were told in Yiddish.

	I have since become interested in literature by Yiddish
authors (so far I have been reading Shalom Aleichem and Isaac
Singer).  I would be grateful for any suggested readings.  For the
present I have been confining myself to English translations.

I am looking forward to future conversations with others of similar
interests.  Thank you to the administrator(s) of this listing for
providing this service.
