Subject: Food in songs

Here are a few more songs involving food, Adolf King's "Oy, iz dos
a rebetsn" (which needs to be sung in theater [i.e., SE] Yiddish
for the rhymes to work) and two folk songs.  I've capitalized the
food references.

Subject: A story of Chelm

[English follows]
Ikh vel dertseyln a mayse fun der barimter shtetl khelm.  Ikh hob es gehert
ober keynmol nisht geleynt tvishn di bakante mayses fun khelm.  Di mayse

Amol iz geven a khelmer yid vos zayn shtele iz geven zeyer a poshete.  Er hot

 Af di lodns fun ale hayzer hot er shtark ongeklapt un gemakht a hilkhik

 Derfun hot er gemakht a lebn.  Nu, nokh a sakh yorn iz er gevorn zeyer alt,
un di arbet iz gevorn far im zeyer, zeyer shver, kemot tsu shver. Di khelmer

af undzere lodns veln mir ale brengen undzere lodns tsu im in zayn shtibele
un dort vet er kenen klapn un klapn gezunterheyt!"

This story about the famous townlet of Chelm is one I've heard, but never
read among the well-known tales of this town.  The story illustrates that if
the Jews of Chelm are blockheads, they, in fact, have kind, warm, and
sympathetic hearts.

Once there was a Jew of Chelm whose job was a simple one.  He woke very
early, and went around town.  He knocked very hard on the shutters of every
house, very hard, made a loud noise.  Why?  That's how he woke up all the
Jews in town so that they should go to shul to pray.  He did this for years
and years.  It was his living.  Well, after many years he became very old,
and the work became hard for him, almost too hard.  The Jews of Chelm were
afraid that very soon he would no longer have enough strength to walk about
the town.  However, he had to have a job so that, God forbid, he should not
die of hunger.  What could be done?  All the wise men of Chelm came to hold a
meeting to think of a solution.  They thought and thought about what work the
old man could do.  Then, suddenly, one of them jumped on the table and said,
"Let's drink a toast!  I have a fine solution for you!  If the old man can no
longer go around town to knock on our shutters, then we will each bring our
shutters to _his_ house.  And there, he'll be able to knock on them in the
best of health!"

Subject: Davenen-dabern

In Mendele 07.076, elye pavlevsky asks about "davenen-dabern".  In the song
"A khasndl oyf shabbos", the wagon driver describes how the khasn davened
by saying: "Oy, hot er gedabert!"

From: manaster@umich.edu
Subject: davenen/dabern

Elye Palevski suggests that davenen could be related to dabern, but this is
just not possible.  Yiddish verbs of Hebrew origin are really quite faithful
to the Hebrew forms, and you cannot suddenly lose an /r/ or change /b/ to /v/.
And then there is the meaning.

And I really do think that trying to do etymology without linguistics is like
trying to build a suspension bridge without engineering or send an expedition
to the moon without astronomy.

Subject: finger in fist superstition

I read with interest the following by Paul Ilie: "...squeezing the thumb
between the fingers tightened into a fist and motioning to the door after a
visitor left one's dwelling place. Sometimes both hands were used if the
visitor's (usually admiring) words were especially feared."
 
I once visited my employer's home with the entire studio crew for dinner. Her
elderly & somewhat senile mother was present during the evening. She spoke no
English & we really did not understand eachother much with her speaking German
& my speaking Yiddish. They are not Jewish. I always wondered since that night
exactly what happened as we all bid them goodbye at the front door. As I shook
hands with the mother I found her hand clenched in the above-described manner
which made handshaking very awkward. She retained her hand in this position (I
wondered if she were pointing slightly toward us or me) until my boss noticed
it & promptly & very annoyed reprimanded her mother in German "Mutti! Stop
doing that right now! Stop it!" and physically undid her mother's hand twice
as the old lady tried to recreate the fist with finger. I asked my boss what
she had been doing & with an annoyed furrowed brow she did not respond &
deflected my question... Now I have a clue as to what may have been going on.
I have found other folk superstitions that I thought were uniquely
Byelorussian Jewish in my family to be shared by my German Gentile neighbor
who is my age who was also partly reared by a great grandmother.

Subject: superstitions

"Gay nisht iber im (ir), er (zi) vet nisht vaksn!"

My wife grew up with this one and still practices it. If I step over one of
our kids, I have to step back over them, or she gets very upset.

I thought it was just her family, but a couple of years ago I was waiting at
our pediatrician's office with one of the kids, and stepped over a baby who
was playing on the floor in the waiting room. The father very apologetically
asked me to step back over the child, saying his wife would be very upset
otherwise. (And she wasn't even there.)

Subject: rhymes/tongue-twisters

Im reading about dialects and was hoping someone would share some
"rhymes/tongue-twisters/shiboleths" for the different dialects, something
along the line of the Bostonian "park your car in the Harvard yard" or New
"Joy"sey's "dirty girdie murphy she really was a bird she lived on 32 st
right next to 33rd/toity toid". 

One of the few I can remember is a "shagus hot geshosen a shikse oyfn shabas"
with a Litvak pronouncing the sh as s, and the s as sh.
