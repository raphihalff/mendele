Subject: "Vi shver s'iz tsu gleybn"
Date: April 22

I am looking for the name of the author of a poem that begins "vi shver s'iz tsu gleybn." I 
would also appreciate a link to the English translations.

Thank you.

Date: tsushnaydn eydes 
Subject: April 13

I understand the old Jewish customs of not cutting fingernails consecutively (but skipping 
nails and then getting back to the ones skipped), and the custom of not discarding the 
parings on the ground, but what does 
er hot keynmol nisht tsugeshnitn keyn eydes 
mean?
What kind of witness are we talking about here? This story concerns an epikoyres who 
ignores halakha. The immediate context: Oykh hot er zikh geshnitn di negl nisht 
ibergehipert, keynmol nisht tsugeshnitn keyn eydes un azoy aroysgevorfn durkhn 
fentster.

Many thanks in advance.

Subject: tshuve in Singer's "Mayn tatns beys-din shtub"

In Singer's Mayn tatns beys-din shtub, he relates, in the story Der sod, that a woman 
pours out her heart with grief, first to the rebbetsin, then to the rebbe, confessing that she 
had abandoned her illegitimate infant on the steps of a church. Both of them assure her 
that God will forgive her. In addition, the rebbe prescribes a penance, a tshuve: to fast 
Mondays and Thursdays, not to eat meat any weekday, to say the psalms, and to give 
charity.  I had never heard of such a practice among Jews, whereas it is standard in 
Catholicism. Was this common in Singer's day? Is it still?

Subject: William Blake

I wonder whether anyone can inform me about scholarship and/or criticism published in 
Yiddish about the art and poetry of William Blake. My interest is limited for editorial 
reasons to European publications.

With thanks,

Subject: gimze

Earlier today, Gloria Berkenstat Freund posted a question to the Mendele Personals list, 
but the answer is of general linguistic interest.  Gloria wrote:

I am translating an article from the Kurow Yizkor Book. There is a reference to "leder 
gimzes". The phrase appears in a paragraph about a Polish shoemaker who agreed to hide 
Jews in exchange for 10 "leder gimzes." Does anyone know what a leather "gimze" is?

In "Jews and Shoes" (Oxford, UK: Berg, 2008), Edna Nahshon defines "gimze" as "thin 
and supple goat hide... Gimze, which was very pliable and expensive, came in brown and 
black." [95] For European shoemakers, gimze was "[t]he most expensive leather for 
uppers." [97]

I found another clue in the soc.genealogy.jewish archives (14 Nov 2011): 
"Gimze" is a regional Yiddish variant for the German gemze but is not standard Yiddish.

And Gemze?  It's the German name for the wild European antelope better known to us by 
its French name (chamois).  But so far as I know, not related to Gomez (gam zu l'tovah).

Subject: "Hatikva" in Yiddish

Dear Mendele,
 
Has anyone ever translated "Hatikva" into Yiddish?   And was it ever recorded?  I would 
love to obtain a copy of the words in Yiddish, and the recording, if there is one.
 
Thank you.

Subject: rebbe, reb, rov 

But according to http://www.yiddishdictionaryonline.com/ 'rebe' is a Hasidic rabbi, right?
