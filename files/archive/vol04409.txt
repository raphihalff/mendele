checked with a native speaker (mom spent her early years in kasrilevke,
or a place much like it, in the backwoods of grodno gubernye) only to
learn that they called the ladybug not meyshe's ki'ele, but eliyahu's
ferdele. in hebrew, though, there can be no doubt that the ladybug is the
bovine parat moshe.

Subject: Meyshe rabeynu's ki'ele

Thank you Zellig for your stories.  I use a wooden set of picture dominos
with my Mishpokhe Yiddish classes and it contains "meyshe rabeynu's
kieles."  I have asked your question of many rabbis, and other Jewish
scholars.  You're right about connecting them with Shvu'es for I have been
told that when Moses was on Mt. Sinai scribing the 10 commandments, his
lone companion was a "ladybug."

Subject: Meyshe rabeynu's ki'ele

Dear Zellig Bach, dear Mikhl Herzog, here is my entry in trying to solve
the riddle.

This tiny insect has got funny names in many languages. Hebrew folowed
Russian and Yiddish in this case. The russian name translated is: "God`s
cow". Likewise Yiddish named it: "Moyshe Rabeynus ferdl" or
"Moyshe-Rabeynus-beheymele" and "Moyshe-rabeynus-kie`le" which is the
diminutive for "cow" in yiddish. It must have been Chayim Nachman Bialik
who introduced the ladybird into the Hebrew in his poem "Zohar"
(=Brilliance): "Ben-suso-shel-Moshe-rabe(y)nu". Later the small horse
became a cow: "Parat-Moshe-Rabenu".

The latin name is "Coccinella", the french "coccinelle" or "bete a` bon
Dieu" and the Germans call it "Marienkaefer", that is "Marias Beetle" or
"Sonnenkaefer" (sun`s beetle.>

Subject: Housing needed

I am going to be participating in the Yivo/Columbia U. Uriel Weinreich
summer intensive Yiddish program from mid-June until early August. I am
trying to make the experience as inexpensive for myself as possible. If
there are any Mendelniks out there who know of available rooms/sublets in
the vicinity during that time, or who know of any relatively inexpensive
housing options for summer students, please e-mail me at my personal
address (so as not to clog up Mendele), and I shall be ever grateful.
Thank you, thank you!

Subject: Etl-betl

It would seem quite clear that betl is a small bed, i.e. a cradle. Indeed
that's what the structure looks like when completed. As for etl, my guess
is that it was a name chosen (i.e. Ethel) for its alliterative sound, as
is the case for the choice of the word cat to preceed cradle. Surely
Ethel has as much claim on the betl as the cat does on the cradle.
Shtimt?

Subject: Etl-betl

Until Mikhl Herzog spoke of a particular position in cat's cradle as
having a specific name, I absolutely never knew that any of the positions
achieved in the game had Yiddish names.  Of course, I used to make up
names as I played it and the difficult pinky position I called, "The
Spider" but why I have no idea.  I suppose because it required so many
fingers to get it right.  Ah!  I was a master of the spider.  No matter
how good the opponent, an improperly displayed spider would drive them
into submission soon enough.  You had to hold the spider in such a way
that the solution strings were hidden (or, more accurately, all bunched
together making the right grip impossible to discern).

But were there more names to the various positions or is "spiegel" the
only one?  It is exciting to think that the pinky position might have a
Yiddish name.

I presume that anyone who played the game for any length of time came to
realize that almost every position had more than one solution; that is,
given a position one could go in any of two different directions
depending on the solution method chosen.  As I remember, there were about
8 different patterns that were achievable including the dreaded pinky
position.  But the spiegel could be solved from the bottom or from the
top, though as I remember, you got the same next step no matter which
direction the attack.  Other positions would yield quite different
solutions depending on the direction of attack.

Ah, but I woolgather!

Subject: _Antplekn_ revealed

_antplekn_: the mystery "revealed"

To Peter Kluehs' query about _antplekn_ 'to reveal':

Yiddish _antplekn_ has a single surviving related form which, to the best
of my knowledge, occurs only in a small northern Polish area, in the
context of (would you believe it?) 'sticking out the tongue'.

Rendering the English sentence "It's not nice to stick out your tongue",
most people say _siz nit sheyn aroystsuSHTEKN di tsung_; some say
aroystsuSHTELN di tsung_.

More interesting, however, is  _aroystsuLEKN (sic!!) di tsung_, probably
a folk reinterpretation of the term in the adjoining area, the otherwise
unintelligible but most relevant, _aroystsuBLEKN di tsung_, the cognate
of _antPLEKN_.

The transitive form of Middle High German _blecken_ means 'to show'. In
Modern German, it's said of dogs: _die Zaehne blecken_ 'to bare the
teeth'.

Interesting, no?

Variation in the gender of _tsung_ is a separate matter.
