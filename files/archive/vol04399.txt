Subject: Khutspe

Regarding Gaston Schmir's story about Rosovsky and khutspe, I, also a
Rosof (Rozovski in der alter heym), was reminded of another fine
expression which has not entered Yinglish, but which never the less has
some real yidisher tam, and livens up our yidish shebeyidish:

_Yandes_!  Vi azoy hot er gehat dos _Yandes_ (di gal) dos tsu ton?

Yandes, spelled yud-alef-nun-dalet-ayin-samekh, is derived originally as
far as I know from ya'ades: yud-hey-dalet-vov-sov.  It is doubly
interesting: linguistically and sociopsychologically.  Linguistically, we
are presented with another example of the reduction to n phenomenon as in
yankev, and maynse.  In the past on this group, we hypothesized that this
n might be related to an old pronunciation of ayin, noting that in Italy
the ayin has been pronounced gn (/ny/).  Here however, there is no ayin.
It would seem that the operative element is therefore the double-a,
seperated by a glottal stop (in this case, the hey reduces to an alef).
On the sociopsychological level, we have a bit of folk wisdom: Se'shve:er
tsi za:n a yi:d: it takes real khutspe to be a Jew: it is an act of
defiance almost: a refusal to back down.  In this age of asimilatsye,
it's too easy to forget our special yandes, and allow ourselves to be
subsumed in the broader less firy category of khutspe.  But yandes, and
zayn a yid, is more than mere khutspe, because there is another
translation of this perl fun der yidisher shprakh: conscience.  Iz,
raboysay, nat aykh a bisl yandes!

Subject: Moyshe Oysher

More on Moyshe Oysher.

My father, who hailed from Britchon, Bessarabia, claimed Moyshe Oysher as
a landsman, partially authenticted by the fact that Moyshe owed him five
dollars, borrowed in his early days in America.

Subject: Ongepatchket, umgepatcht

A friend asked for the derivation of umgepatcht. I'm not sure whether he
meant ongepatcht, ongepatchket.  When I asked what he meant, he was not
sure and asked whether there was a connection between the two.  Can
anyone help?

Subject: To new subscribers (though veterans may read as well)

There have been so many new subscribers recently that the shames has
fallen behind in sending out a personal welcome.  Please forgive the
oversight.

Part of that welcome message asks that newcomers post an introduction.
The introductions have in fact become a Mendele tradition, so much so
that Anno Siegel has kindly taken on the job of keeping a who-is-who file
current.

Di untershte shure: please send us a note and tell us who you are.  We
are a family and we ought to know one another.

Subject: Yiddish on cd-rom

We had a request not long ago (4.393) about Yiddish cd-roms for teaching
purposes. A good question. Which gives rise to another: how hard would it
be to transfer to cd-rom a large number if not all of our Yiddish
literary treasures?  If for fifty dollars one can buy a cd-rom containing
Tanakh and the Babylonian Talmud together with Rashi, why should one not
be able to get all of Mendele, Sholem Aleikhem, Peretz, Reisen,
Bergelson, the Singers, and the rest?  Not to mention the much harder-to-
find essayists, journalists, critics, pamphleteers whose work is largely
ignored today and without whom we will never begin to understand the
vanished world.

I assume that the technical problems are not insuperable.  I'm sure that
the resulting archive, available in every library and to every lover of
Yiddish, would be priceless.  Whoever were to take on such a project
would be in simple truth acting l'shem shomayim.
