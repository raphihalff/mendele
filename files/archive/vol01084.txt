Subject: Hebrew => Yiddish => Modern German

My wife's 2nd cousin, who was born in Berlin and now lives
in Israel, told me about some Hebrew words that became
modern German, by way of Yiddish.  This fascinates me and
I'd like to know of more examples.

Here are the two he gave me:

   Modern German            Hebrew
   ----------------------   ------------------------------
1. heiraten (to marry)      haray-at (first 2 words of
                            marriage vows) (pronounced
                            "hayrat" in Yiddish, YIVO ay)

2. lashe (tongue of shoe)   loshen (tongue, as in
                            mame-loshen)

To those Jews who consider Yiddish a "bastardized" German,
I say: "ha"!

                                            ... Bob

There forms of the Yiddish -l- and -lex diminutives are
obviously of Germanic origin. Their productivization is
probably due to Slavic influence.

Subject: SINGULARS, DIMINUTIVES, IRONIES, FOOD

I've heard one woman refer to another's new fur coat as "a
shtikl mink!."  I doubt this meant "a piece of mink," more
likely, "SOME mink," or "a hell of a mink."  The diminutive
here is, I think, used ironically.

On food, a topic we could likely write on forever, my
mother used to make something she called "foileh
pumpershkes."  It was a very condensed, small muffin, baked
with raisins and sour cream (the foileh part), the sour
cream, as it were forming a glaze on top.  To my adult eyes
and memory it looked like an Easter bun, and its' design
may have emulated the goyische pastry.  Does anyone know
what this is?  Better yet, does anyone have the recipe?
(They are, of course, delicious, but more than one will
keep you anchored for a bit).

Has anyone mentioned "tzimmes"? -- another word with
wonderful metaphorical properties.  "Gogle-mogle"?  Eva
Hoffman, in "Lost in Translation," has a description.
