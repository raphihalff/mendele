Subject: Yidl mitn fidl

"Yidl Mitn Fidl" may be my favorite Yiddish song, but I was never able to
make out most of the words.  So I had my bube and zeyde watch the video
with me and write down all the words.  But due to the poor sound quality
we still weren't able to get them all.  Here is what we came up with-- I
hope that some of you may be able to help me clean it up.

I indicated the phrases we weren't clear about with brackets [].  Let me
apologize for my transcription job-- I've never done this before and my
Yiddish is very limited to begin with.

Iber felder vegen, oyf a vugen hey,
In finster un in regn, furen klezmers tsvey.
A khidish oy a khidish, zogt ir zenen zey.

Yidl mitn fidl, Arye mitn bass,
Dos lebn iz a lidl, far vuzhe zayn in ka'as,
Hey Yidl, fidl, shmidl, dos lebn iz a shpa'as.

A [coz] shteyt oyf der loynke, [shreyt] "meh",
[Hey di shvartse shoyte], troyrig zayn [iz "feh"].
[Shlog nisht mer dos ferdele?], take take "feh".

A feygl flit "git morgn", "git morgn, a git yor",
Der troyer un de zorgn, tsu alde shvartse yor.
[Der bitr un de soynim], Yidl, Yidl fur.

Subject: Tevye

In response to Danielle HarPaz's very interesting posting about teaching
the Tevye stories - what interests me, in the story about Chava, as
regards the relationship between father and daughter, is how much it's a
story about how the daughter, in imitating the father's behavior, gets to
a place where the father can't follow her. If, like Chava, you're raised
by a father like Tevye, a curious, remarkably open-minded, speculative
man;  and if you develop in yourself that speculative open-mindedness,
then it's easy to turn that speculative open-mindedness on the
commandment that Jews shall marry Jews.  And what's poignant in Tevye's
response to Chava's marriage is that he has to confront in her his own
curiosity, and has to come up against what turn out to be, in him, the
limits of that curiosity - the place where his curiosity is bounded by
dogma. In this respect, though not in many others, I think _Fiddler on
the Roof_ gets it right, when Tevye says, "on the other hand - but there
_is_ no other hand."

Subject: Tevye as a father

I'd like to mention an anecdote which Daniella HarPaz' post about her
Yiddish-literature-in-translation class discussion brings to mind.

I think Tevye's conduct might have been quite typical.  In my old Detroit
neighborhood (12th Street), the local delicatessen owner was from 'the
old country' as were many, many of my neighbors.  He spoke w/ a Yiddish
accent.  His daughter married a goy and had a child a little sooner, I
think, than perhaps she should have.  He disowned her and sat shiva--at
least, that's the story I was told.  Since my family moved away from the
neighborhood, as did theirs, I lost track of the ending of this sad
story.  Somehow, I recollect that he recanted, but definitely not right
away.  This daughter was their only child.

This father was very kind to all the neighborhood children--offering us
free penny candy/pretzels whenever we happened into the deli; and always
with a warm smile.

So, nu?  Gey veys. . .

Subject: Announcement of international conference

The Isaac and Jessie Kaplan Centre for Jewish Studies and Research at the
University of Cape Town, South Africa, will be hosting an international
conference "Jewries at the Frontier" at the University of Cape Town from
11-13 August 1996.

The conference co-ordinators, Milton Shain (University of Cape Town) and
Sander L. Gilman (University of Chicago), are calling for papers which
will explore the Jewish experience in frontier settings.  The emphasis
will be on Jews as a minority within a minority with hegemonic power in
colonial and post colonial settings.

Thus the conference will examine in an interdisciplinary manner South
African Jewry; Anglophone Indian  Jewry; Canadian Jewry with a focus on
Quebec Jewry and Jewry in the Northern Territories;  American Jewry of
the colonial period and American Jewry with a focus on the South
(French-speaking Louisiana) and the Spanish-speaking Southwest; early
Australian and New Zealand Jewry;  German Jewry (Haskalah and
post-Haskalah) in the Baltic, Central,  and Eastern Europe inclduing the
non-German speaking areas of the Austro-Hungarian Empire;  Jewry at the
geographic margins in Latin and South America;  Ukrainian Jewry in the
18th and 19th centuries; and any other communities that fit the
parameters of the conference.

Abstracts of presentations are required before 31 January 1996.
Presentations will be in English. There is a limited amount of subsidy
for accommodation in Cape Town. For further information please contact
