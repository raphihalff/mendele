to mikhl herzog-- Me do penance, even shlugg kapoyres? Why?
I still say gries and grayzn don't shake hands. You say
youre not competent to judge aramaic/hebrew in yiddish and
then you judge. That doesnt convince me you are right.
Citing others, means I cant debate with them because theyre
not here.

You may as well argue french gris for origin-- and say its
possible. The examples you give are normal slurring
transpositions and were common in medieval hebrew. stam
eydes-- is noted by the gemoro to be always plural even if
the form is sing. And the talmud refers it to people as
well, metonymically even if it refers properly to the act
of witnessing rather than the witnesses. The other examples
are exactly what one hears. And I speak hebrew that way
myself-- yashakoyech and the rest. Its not the vocalization
that bothers me about gries and grayzn, its the dissonance
of meaning and the rarity of gries and its legal-specific
sense of "weakness" rather than "mistake".  But if it turn
out in oylem hoemes youre right then you'll have to give me
"mikhile" keshmo. Until then I'll live in sin-- wouldn't
you?

Subject: "mshiekhs-tsaytn"

My father quoted (disapprovingly) certain among the
orthodox who saw in the turmoil in the world (especially
for Jews) a sign of the coming of Mshiekh being imminent.

Subject: Yiddish accent in film, "r-dropping"

I read an interview (don't remember where -- maybe in the
Forverts or else in an English mag) with Reyzl Bozyk who
played the grandmother in the movie "Crossing Delancey."
She stated that she was asked to speak with a Yiddish
haccent, which she refused to do, saying [I paraphrase:]
"My accent in English is bad enough.  Why should I speak in
an even more distorted manner?!"  In fact her pronunciation
of English is quite "good."  It doesn't exhibit many of the
features that a Borsht Belt comedian might exploit.  One
reason is that, if I'm not mistaken, her Yiddish has an
apical ("trilled") "r" and not a velar ("guttural") "r" and
thus so does her English.  [If I'm corrected on this point,
I'll be 0 for 2 on my movies.]

Has apicality vs. velarity of a native Yiddish speaker's
Yiddish "r" been shown to determine the probability of
his/her pronunciation of English /er/ (as in _first_)
[_schwar_, to linguists]? There's foyRst, ferst, foyst,
among others (with R symbolizing the velar and r the
apical).  I concluded from some research on language
contact and phonology that the stereotype of "r-dropping"
in the English of native Yiddish-speakers depends primarily
on "r-dropping" in the English being spoken around the
immigrant (New York vs. Philadelphia English, lemoshl) and,
if the speaker is a Philadelphian (a shteyger) where there
is no "r-dropping" in English, occurrence or non-occurrence
of "r-dropping" in his/her _Yiddish_ will determine why
s/he "r-drops" in English.  (Not suhprising.)
