Subject: Greek Jewish culture

I am sending out this request in the hope that someone might be able
to offer some assistance, but realizing that this is perhaps not the
proper forum for it.

While my father's family is Ashkenasi, that of my mother is Romaniot
(Greek, non-Sephardic) from the town of Janinna.  I am hoping to
contact sociologists, linguists, anthropologists, etc. who would be
willing to interview Romaniot Jews in order to learn about their
language and culture.  Little is known about them (there are not
many books about Romaniot Jews) and most of these Jews in America
are eldery, their children (like my mother) having "intermarried." I
fear this culture will be lost without ever being properly
documented.

I informed the Holocaust video archives at Yale about some
Greek-Jewish survivors and they are very eager to interview them
(Israeli scholar Yehuda Bauer has apparently requested interviews
with Greek Jews especially), but Yale is not interested in
interviewing Greek Jews who did not directly experience the
Holocaust.  Many of these people can be found in Brooklyn,
especially in the Sephardic Home for the Aged on Cropsy Avenue.
There is also a Janinna congregation on Broome St. (Kehille Kadosha
Janinna) in New York.  Janinna was not the only Romaniot Jewish
center, but I believe the largest one.

According to tradition, the Romaniot have lived in Greece since the
destruction of the Second Temple.  They speek Greek, unlike the
Sephardim of Salonika, but many were educated in the French Alliance
Israelite Universelle schools.  Many speak  Ladino, as well, do to
their contact with the Sephardim.

I hope someone will respond to this message, for I am not qualified
to undertake such a project, although I would be more than happy to
supply as much information as possible about subjects.

Subject: Rokhl Korn

I have some information for Rebecca Lillian.  Rebecca may want to
look at Miriam Waddington's book "Apartment Seven."  It has some
material on Rachel Korn.  Waddington has also translated some of
Korn's poetry.  Rebecca also asked for biographical information on
Korn.  I'm not sure if Levitan mentions t his, but I believe that
Chaim Grade fell in love with Rokhl Korn's daughter but Korn would
not allow the relationship to develop (she did not want her daughter
marrying a poet).  If this information is inaccurate would someone
please corre ct me.  If Rebecca has any other questions, she get in
touch with me (my Yidd- ish teacher knew Korn).

Subject: Introduction

I am a federation planner in Toronto, responsible for the areas of
Jewish culture, which includes supervizing the director of our
Committee for Yiddish.

I am particularly interested in the role of Jewish culture,
including, of course, Yiddish language and literature, in enriching
and sustaining our contemporary Jewish life.

Subject: (Long overdue)introduction

I have been violating the etiquette of electronic mail by lurking
before leaping, but I shall lurk no longer. My name is Richard
Menkis, and I teach in the Department of Religious Studies at the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver. My area of research is
Canadian Jewish history, presently with an emphasis on
describing/analyzing the religious self-definitions of Canadian
Jews. Although I have received no formal training in Yiddish, over
the past two years I have been going through introductory college
Yiddish texts,have had fun reading early twentieth century
brifenshteller. I am also fortunate  that there is a very lively
Yiddish reading group in Vancouver, and when I have the
opportunity--not frequently enough--it is a delight.

In Vancouver, you ask (and it's been asked before)? Imagine, in this
Yiddish reading group are two distinguished authors and translators,
Miriam Waddington and Seymour Levitan, whose translations appear in
the Howe and Wisse Sholem Aleichem volume. I introduce them as well,
because I have passed on to them what happens in Mendele, and I
shall pass on to you their comments, if they should so desire.

And, in fact, such is now the case. When I informed Seymour Levitan
that Korn's poetry was being quoted on Mendele, he was of course
thrilled that more and more people are enjoying her work. While I
was not able to tell him whether this poem was one of the poems he
had translated, whether it was or wastn't, he wanted me to remind
you, Mark, that these poems do not appear in English out of nowhere,
and that mentioning the translator would be appropriate.

Rifke Lillian had asked about further information regarding Korn.
Her papers are at the Jewish Public Library in Montreal, and in
their catalogue of MSS they have some biographical information. They
will also have more information in the clippings files in the
Canadiana room in the Jewish Public Library, some of which will be
synthesized in Ch L Fuchs, One hundred years of Yiddish and Hebrew
Literature in Canada (in Yiddish).

I enjoy the comments, debates, etc of Mendele, enormously,
especially when dealing with questions of history and
literature.(Which is why, I suppose, I am enjoying the present text
being read in the Yiddish reading group here, IJ Singer's wonderful
autobiography).
