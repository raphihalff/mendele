Subject: Serebriani and Menakhem Mendl

Louis Fridhandler has undoubtedly done Mendele in general a service in
quoting and very briefly analyzing Yisroel Serebriani=92s article on
Sholom Aleichem, with special reference to Menachem Mendel. And here, it
would appear,  we must examine the function of Mendele: is it to
enlighten people whose only knowledge of Yiddish and consequently
Yiddish writers is academic? Or is it to serve as a medium for
discussion among Jews whose Yiddish is already there and who have read
Sholom Aleichem mit di klayne pintelech? I had hoped it was the latter,
but in the year or so that I have been receiving the Mendele bulletins I
have come to the reluctant conclusion that for every knowledgeable
Yiddish speaker like Louis Fridhandler there must be fifty who can best
be classified in the words of a friend of mine as "Yiddish faddists".=20

Look: Serebriani is not necessary to tell us that Sholom Aleichem honed
and refined his Menachem Mendel stories. In what is, in my opinion for
whatever it=92s worth, the finest of them all, "Es Fidelt Nisht", its
title page tells us that it was written between 1900 and 1909. I don=92t
imagine anyone thinks it took Sholom Aleichem nine years to write it. He
took nine years to produce what he felt was the definitive version of it
and the evidence is there before one even starts reading it.

And a careful reading of Sholom Aleichem will show that almost never
does he use a word or phrase without having a carefully thought-out
reason for it. Take, for example, one of the Ayzenban Geshichtes =96 A
Mensh fun Buenos Aires. Two translators of this piece into English have
treated it somewhat differently in translation but have translated the
title the same: "The Man from Buenos Aires". Surely it can be argued
that the difference between "A" and "The" is negligible and that many
languages have one but not the other or neither, but this is not so. If
it were, neither English nor Yiddish would have separate words for the
indefinite and the definite article and neither would be what it is.=20

Further, Sholom Aleichem uses a word in the title that can mean either
"man" or simply "person" and almost always means the latter. The common
word for "man" among Yiddish speakers was and is, "Yid" =96 Jew -- and in
the writings of Sholom Aleichem this is almost always the case.  The
title is thus indefinite in two ways and when the story is read it
becomes evident why: the "man" from Buenos Aires never defines himself=20
except to make clear that he does business in "imported" merchandise.
"Mayn gesheft iz alayn aygentlich nit in Buenos Aires. Mayn gesheft
iz...umetum, oif der gantse velt: in Paris, in London, in Budapest, in
Boston, un di hoipt-kantor, does buro, iz in Buenos Aires". And while we
spot from the very beginning that he is a procurer, the innocent
passenger-narrator is finally forced to ask him, "Vos iz, aygntlich,
ayer gesheft? Mit vos handlt ir?"

The two translators give two different answers. According to one, the
procurer answers, "Not in prayer books, my friend, not in prayer books!"
The other translator has it, "Not in Chanuka candles, my friend, not in
Chanuka candles!"

Sholom Aleichem says neither. He has the procurer answer, "Nisht mit
esroigim, mayn fraynt, handel ich, nisht mit esroigim!" The subtlety of
Sholom Aleichem=92s answer is lost in both translations. Neither prayer
books nor Chanuka candles are imported as esroigim are and indeed must
be. Neither are "foreign" and exotic, no matter how well known, as are
esroigim. Sholom Aleichem could just as easily have said, "sidurim" or
Chanuka licht", but he didn=92t. What he said was esroigim and not by
chance. In truth, throughout his works you will find that nothing he
says is casual, every single word is the product of hard and exacting
labor and it is the totality of these small details that makes him the
genius he is.

To any reader willing to put in just a fraction of the work Sholom
Aleichem put in to what he wrote, all this is obvious from the
beginning. Serebriani is right, but who needs him to point out the
obvious? Not Louis Fridhandler, I would be willing to bet, and if
Mendele is being edited for people who do need him, perhaps I=92m in the
wrong place and not without company.

Subject: Ha-orets / porets

In my family, the ha-orets / porets rhyme was not attached to the blessing
for bread but rather to the recital of SHema before going to sleep.  My
mother would say the verse (Gen. 48:16) which ends with the words
"ve-yitgu la-rov be-kerev ha-orets" and then say "shlof vi a porets."=20

Subject: The _Forward_ corrects itself

          The English _Forward_ was criticized several times in these pages
for carrying a designed heading over its personal ads section that read "Me=
et
a Meydl, Meet a Mensch."

          It was not merely a question of the German spelling "Mensch"
instead of the Yiddish spelling "mentsh," but the very new concept of
_mentsh_ as Jewish mothers forged it, in the course of generations, was los=
t,
imbued as it became with Jewish and social meanings beyond its limited
literal sense.

          A Jewish mother's admonition to her son "zay a mentsh" conveyed t=
he
message "far got un far laytn" [God-fearing and a respector of societal
values], and encapsulated all her hopes and dreams for her son.  She felt
that such attitudes on his part would ultimately result in people's esteem
and respect for him.
          It was also hoped that this, in turn, would eventually reflect up=
on
her own character as a Jewish mother.

          Apparently under the pressure of the criticism in _Mendele_, the
_Forward_ has now redesigned that respective heading  (May 23, 1997, p. 13)
to read "Meet a Meydl, Meet a _Mentsh_."

          It is hoped that the woman who introduced herself in her ad as an
"observant, kind neshome" will find her bashertn, a mentsh mit ale mayles
[with all virtues], as her heart desires.

          It is further hoped that the _Forward_ will now stop "betailing"
(coined after beheading) such words as "kinderlekh," leaving out the /kh/,
the lange-khof, and we will soon be able to say about its next correction -=
