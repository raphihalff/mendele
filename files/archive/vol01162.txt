Subject: Grayzn

To Fishbane:
 
Let's separate the two issues: i) the putative origin of
grayz; ii) the origin of the expression "noyekh mit zibn
grayzn".
 
As for the latter, it had NOTHING to do with the possible
origin of grayzn. The contention is merely that once grayz
had come to mean 'mistake' (and, perhaps after the method
of writing with krayzn had fallen into disuse) speakers
interpreted "zibn krayzn" as "zibn grayzn". Not terribly
unreasonable.
 
As for the former "grayzn  CANNOT come from . . ., etc."
Doesn't, perhaps, but cannot? Why not? When I say things
like that, I have to do penance. Try the following:
 
a) Get hold of a copy of the Yehoyosh-Spivak "Yidish
verterbukh" of Hebrew and Aramaic words in Yiddish
(indispensible to the study of the language); b) Read
through all the entries for a couple of letters; c)
Classify the words in terms of the changes to which Yiddish
subjects them, i.e., to the manner in which Yiddish
neutralizes the grammatical constraints that prevail in the
original languages; d) Change your mind about what can or
cannot happen.
 
You'll find that grammatical categories of gender and
number are neutralized, words are shifted to different
parts of speech, morpheme boundaries are imposed, shifted,
and eliminated. Semantic nuances shift. A few examples from
my own repertoire:
 
(tsvey) eydes '(two) witnesses' from 'eyduth (sg)'
zeyere oves-oveseynu !!!
zayn okhi!!!
makhn a vayivrakh
di bobe oleVasholem !!!
shem--sheymes--a sheyme
kos--koyses--makhn a koyse
arbe-kanfes--a kanfe
mefunek--mefunitse
 
Still, my Hebrew/Aramaic is not good enough to insist that
"grayz" IS derived from gri'es. Sadan's was.
 
As an aside, keep in mind that long [i] in medieval German
is realized as [ay] in Yiddish (vayn, tsayt, mayn, etc.).
The correspondence between [ay] in grayz and [i] in gri'es
fits that development.

Subject: Re _Mendele_ Vol. 1, No. 152 (Ellen's request for
 the raw material of the jokes in "Ludic Yiddish (Note One)."

Dear Ellen:  I regret that I can't find the jokes in the
form in which I originally received them.  Please
understand that I do not use the term "Ludic Yiddish" to
cover all instances of English (or any other language) with
Yiddish interference.  I don't like the name "Yinglish" and
prefer "Jewish English" (on the model of Black English,
Mormon English, etc.).  "Ludic Yiddish" is a cover term for
the exaggerated association of Yiddish with comedy and
includes the overworking of individual words which are
supposed to be intrinsically funny.  When "broken English"
is employed comically, it becomes "ludic."  Several years
ago I began to take notes on Jewish English and to compile
a checklist of references.

The list includes a few items on phonology.  Only the Green
item below is listed in Joan G. Bratkowsky, :HP1.Yiddish
Linguistics; A Multilingual Bibliography:EHP1. (New York
and London: Garland Publishing Inc., 1988).  As you know,
Bratkowsky has a section on "Interaction of Yiddish with
other Languages," which includes "Influences of Other
Languages on English."  Yet she gives relatively few items
for "English Influence" (p. 164).  Bratkowsky's work is
very useful despite inevitable limitations.  It needs to be
supplemented with the help of "References and Bibliography
of Yiddish Linguistics 1979-1988," in Paul Wexler, ed.
_Studies in Yiddish Linguistics_ (Tuebingen: Max Niemeyer
Verlag, 1990), pp. 187-216.
 
I don't necessarily recommend all of the dozen items -- a
selection -- following.  It would be good to have reviews
of them in _Mendele_. Neither Davis nor his thesis advisor
knew Yiddish!  Gold 1985 is a good general review of the
subject.  There are items in Wexler which are relevant, but
which I do not include here.
