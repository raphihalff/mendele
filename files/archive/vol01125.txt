Aren Abramson: I'm still pursuing the vatnmaxer/vatemaxer
(listed both ways in different sources). UW Dictionary
distinguishes vate 'cotton' from vatn 'wadding'. I assume
that they're cognates, by the way. The expression 'xapt im
der vatnmaxer' i.e., 'devil take him' is well-known (among
Yiddish speakers) & in various dictionaries and compendia
of expessions, but noone has yet suggeste d a reasonable
explanation of its origin. A Sadan bibliography that I have
lead s nowhere. Remind me of the source of your quote. I'll
keep trying. Best guess to date: it's a folk etymology of
the sparrow grass variety. Of what, I don't know yet.
Mikhl.

Yiddish Language and Literature will take place in

Department, The Hebrew University, Mount Scopus, Jerusalem,

Brokhim hanimtsoyim!  It's great to be on this mailing
list!  My name is Meyer in Yiddish, and here's a brief bio
per your request:

I host and produce a weekly Yiddish-language radio called
The Yiddish Hour on WBRS, 100 FM, a college radio station
at Brandeis U, Waltham, MA, which is like my main hobby.
The program, which is at 6:00 p.m. on Sundays, turns one
year old at the end of December, 1991.  The last two shows
of the year will feature interviews with Dov Noy (Nov. 22),
Sylvia Fuks-Fried (Nov. 22), and Aharon Appelfeld (Nov.
29), all in Yiddish, naturally.  It's a lot of fun.

My mother is a fluent Yiddish speaker from Subcarpathian
Ruthenia. And I studied some Yiddish, along with German,
Hebrew, Italian, Spanish, and Romanian, while earning my
undergraduate degree in Linguistics at the University of
Chicago, mit yoren tsurik.  But most of the Yiddish I know
I've learned in the last few years by interviewing people
in Yiddish, reading the Yiddish press, attending concerts,
plays, lectures, sings, and "vinkels", and generally
seeking out the language and its venerable native speakers
wherever I can.

For a living I write computer software in a supposedly dead
computer language: LISP.

        Although we often talk of Ashkenaz and the Yiddish
speech-community as a unit, it is, naturally, not a
monolith.  Playing dreydl during Khanike, we might think,
is a universal custom in Ashkenaz.

        I had the opportunity to introduce the Yiddish
dialects to my Intermediate Yiddish class at Penn with the
timely example of the diversity within Ashkenaz regarding
the term for the dreydl in respective Yiddish dialects.
Lest you think it's dreydl "un dat's oll" (as Aaron
Lebedeff sings), here are some other terms and relevant
notes: (1) trendl, trender, trenderl -- towards the west of
"Yiddish Land", a vestige of Western Yiddish (spoken in
German-speaking territory) [Herzog 1965:53, 57, 58] and
Hungarian Yiddish (I assume Western Transcarpathian) [Shoys
1933:187]; (2) reydl (spelled: redl) -- assumably from an
interpretation of dreydl as di reydl [Herzog 1965:57]; (3)
verfl -- in Zamet/Zamogitia (Northeastern Yiddish) [Shoys
1933:188] (verflekh normally means 'dice'); (4) gor
[Yiddish dictionaries of Harkavy and U. Weinreich] --
assumably derived from one of the explanations of the
meaning of the letter giml on the dreydl, viz. gor 'all,
everything' (Mikhl Herzog, p.c.). Any others?  More exact
information? And dreydl is not the only Khanike game!  Me
shpilt in kortn, in blansh, in domine, in kvitlekh, in
tsig-un-volf, among others.

Gee, I can't wait till Purim when we can discuss grager,
greger, dreyer, homen-klaper, etc.!
