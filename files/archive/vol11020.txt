Subject: Rosten's "The New Joys of Yiddish"

In Mendele 11.018, Al Grand, whom I respect for his talented rhyming
and his admirable love for words, speaks of " the embarrassing borscht
circuity, tasteless, badly edited and inaccurate _Joys of Yiddish_ by
Leo Rosten".

The Forward (Kovi Weitsner) has scorned the newly updated edition for
being politically correct, and I think many academicians on our list
would feel scorn for the Yiddish in the book, even as it tries to
update to YIVO standardizations.

I have long wrestled with ivory tower Yiddish as the only acceptable
standard. It would be a world to win if everyone who loves or 'knows'
mameloshn could read the poetry of Manger and Sutskever, and delight in
Chaim Grade or Perets. What a goal - to speak like a Weinreich.

Yet I think Yiddish wore a tattered coat when it was at its peak, in
its prime in the shtetl. All dialects were respected; grammar was not
apparent on many tongues. But it was how Jews communicated, vibrant and
alive, and it came to America with them in their souls.

And then Leo Rosten created a lexicon in English of Yiddish words, (yes
some are tasteless), and jokes and stories, (yes some are badly
edited), but he writes of our Yiddish language, of its history, of its
influence on English, of Yiddish linguistic devices.

Rosten's genuine warmth, sense of fun, and love of the language, are
felt on every page. Like the Hasidim forsaking di, der, dem, and dos
for d, but speaking Yiddish! Rosten calls upon us too to remember
Yiddish is alive for speaking! If not perfect, it may become so, as
long as he blows breath into it.

I congratulate his daughters, Madeline Rosten Lee and Margareret Rosten
Muir, and editor, Lawrence Bush, for re-presenting a book (The New Joys
of Yiddish ISBN o-6o9-6o785-5 Crown Publishers/New York) that many
readers enjoy, talk about, (even learn from!)and identify with as a
part of their heritage.

Subject: Song: Neyn Neyn Neyn

Tayere Mendelyaner,
I'm looking for information regarding a song called Neyn Neyn Neyn.
The words are:

Neyn (repeated several dozen times)
S'vet undzer folk nit untergeyn.

Ven fun sonim, vilde sonim,
Vet nit zayn kayne zekher, kayn gebeyn,
Veln mir do shvern az di velt zol hern
Neyn, neyn, neyn, neyn, neyn, neyn,
neyn, neyn, neyn, neyn, neyn, neyn, neyn,
S'vet undzer folk nit untergeyn.

Does anyone know who wrote it?  Where?  When?
Any information would be greatly appreciated.

A sheynem dank.

Subject: Vayzoso's seykhl

The famous lyrics by Jacob Jacobs to "Bay mir bistu sheyn" include the
line "un ven du host Vayzosos seykhl".  To what exactly does this
refer?  Megilas Ester mentions a Vayzoso as the tenth (and presumably
youngest) son of Haman to be put to death.  Louis Ginsberg's _Legends
of the Jews_ gives adds an irrelevant detail about Vayzoso's death, but
nothing that could refer to his "seykhl."  Is the expression "Vayzoso's
seykhl" Jacobs' own creation or does it stem from another source?
More importantly, what exactly is its nuance?

Khaveyrim,

I am looking for information on the shtetl wedding.  I would like to
know about all aspects that I can learn:  the food and people who
prepared and served it (hey, recipes if you know them), the clothing
that would have been worn, decorations, dances done, music played,
gifts given, duration of festivities, etc.

Any ideas on sources?

A dank in foroys,

Subject: Josef Herman and Moshe Bernstein

Dear Mendelianer,

I'm a historian from Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw. Now we - I,
and my husband Rafal Zebrowski, are preparing a big lexicon (two
volumes) about history and culture of Polish Jews (polish title -
Polski slownik judaistyczny). Pruszynski and S-ka should print it at
the next spring (2002).

I hope, that some Mendelianer will be able to help me. I look for
information about two painters:

1. Herman Josef (born 1911 in Warsaw), from 1940 -in England ;
2. Bernstein Moshe (born 1920  in Bereza Kartuska), from 1948 in
Israel

Are they still alive? If not what are the dates?

Subject: Psoy Korolenko - a Jewish performer from Russia

Tayere Mendelyaner,

Have you ever heard about Psoy Korolenko's one-man show and singing?

He is a Jewish poet/singer/artist/performer from Russia, whose main
point is to integrate the spice of Yiddishkayt into the context of
contemporary art. In Russia he had been compared with Theodor Bikel for
the cultural diversity of his repertory. He sings in many toungues in
order to express his vision of various traditions, but often he appeals
to the Yiddish folk, Klezmer and Theater contexts.

Recently, the Russian 'Forverts' told about his show in
Saint-Petersburg in which contemporary hassidic tales of his own were
supplemented by Shubert's most popular songs sung in Yiddish. Here is,
e.g., the Mamelushn version of Shubert's 'Serenade':

shtil antloyfn mayne lider
durkh der nakht tsi dir
inem shtiln veldl, liber,
kim arup tsi mir!

gib a kik vi shpitsn royshn
in levune-shayn,
in levune-shayn,
zay zhe azoy git, mayn sheynster
kim tsi mir arayn
kim tsi mir arayn

herst, vi soloveyen shrayen?
oy, zey betn dir,
mit di zise taynes-klangen
betn zey far mir.

oy, farshteyen zey rakhmunes,
libe-veytik oykh,

in di shkhine mit ir fligl
shvebt in himl hoykh
shvebt in himl hoykh

loz mir nor dayn brist barirn,
liber numen mayn
oy, ikh vil mit dir shpatsirn
in levune-shayn
in ganeydn-shayn
in shtiler shayn...

Subject: Psoy Korolenko and Yiddish culture

The previous posting about upcoming Psoy Korolenko's tour to the US
inspired me to share few thoughts on the subject.

Three years ago browsing the Internet I came across Ru.Shtetl, one of
the Russian internet discussion groups. Being interested in everything
eponymous to the real _Virtual Shtetl_, I started reading the postings.
A refreshing stream of phrases that I haven't heard since attending my
high school gym locker room did not evoke any strong associations with
any shtetl. Further down the screen, the rich idiom of drunk Russian
coachmen was sprinkled by occasional corrupted Yiddish words and calls
to all Jews to leave Israel ("ersatz-yisroel" in Ru.Shtetl's parlance),
and resettle in the "Shtetl of Spirit, illuminated by the Truth of
Semitic, Turkic, and Arian Egregors". Ru.Shtetl contributors agreed that

everyone should speak Yiddish and offered a recipe on how to achieve it:

"add 'azokhnvey' after each [Russian] word". Strong smell of New Age and

Eastern Orthodox varieties of Jews for Jesus rhetoric penetrated most
messages.

At first glance, everything looked like either an elaborate but
tasteless spoof on post-postmodernist ethnophilosophical discourse, or a

weird new strain of neo-nazi ideology. However, a closer look revealed
a different story: a small collective of Russian counterculture types
used Yiddish simply as a methaphor for vernacular of a fringe group and
shtetl as a methaphor for place for such a group. Never mind that a
number of people may find it offensive, Ru.Shtetl members could not
care less (nor did they know anything) about the "other" Yiddish
culture. Those conservative academics who claim that "Jewish (and
non-Jewish) spokesmen for gays and lesbians, feminists and
neo-Trotskyites freely identify their sense of personal injury with the
cause of Yiddish" would have had a field day analysing Ru.Shtetl. It is
difficult to imagine better illustration for their thesis.  One of the
few key players in Ru.Shtetl and the author of its manifesto was Psoy
Korolenko.

Psoy Galaktionovich Korolenko is _nom de guerre_ (cultural _guerre_,
that is) of Pavel Lion, a literary critic from Moscow, who moonlights
as a self-defined "junior phallologus, bodysinger and modern
skomorokh". Psoy Korolenko belongs to the generation of Russian
intellectuals that came of age in the time of breakdown of Soviet
restrictions on cultural consumption and production. The newly acquired
freedoms led to the fast (sometimes too fast) assimilation of assorted
postmodernist theories hastily adopted to the realities of post-Soviet
cultural space. On the expression front, the major breakthroughs
occured in the complete destruction of carefully maintained during the
Soviet era taboos on explicit sexuality complete with obscene
vocabulary and abusive, derogatory comments of various types.  The
results of liberation were not always pretty: in Korolenko's case it is
a second-hand deconstructivism in cheap punk rock packaging.

Later I learned that Psoy Korolenko is a popular performer and that his
recordings are available on the internet. Their musical part is often
interesting, for example, the only Yiddish song in the collection, "Afn
pripechek", is done in almost flawless Bessarabian Yiddish with unusual
rhythmical interpretation.  However Korolenko's own songs lexically,
stylistically, and semantically are very similar to the texts in
Ru.Shtetl. The same macaronic arrangements of primitive verses where
vulgar Russian is interspersed with quasi-Yiddish. Korolenko is well
versed in Derrida and Lacan, but it seems that his knowledge of Yiddish
culture is limited to the few albums of Theodore Bickel and the Barry
sisters plus a number of off color "Jewish" jokes.  He may be trying to
deconstruct old (or create new) myths, but is often confusing
archetypes and stereotypes. And stereotypes, in particular the
antisemitic ones, are exactly what feeds his lyrics. I am not inclined
to discuss any details of the songs:  my personal red line is drawn
where the word "Auschwitz" is used in a mocking context, followed by
loud laughter in the recording made with a live audience.

The new show mentioned in the previous posting, besides Andrey
Bredstein's Yiddish renderings of Schubert songs, contains familiar
motifs about Israel as a place where "voynen torn yidn dokh nit" and
some fairly graphic descriptions of castration of violinists
Rabinovich, Tsyperovich, and a cat named Moyshe, and mutilation of Dr
Frumkin and a number of his patients. So much for "integrating the
spice of Yiddishkayt into the context of contemporary art". I, for one,
would rather stay segregated.

Disclaimer: the above comments are made about the internet and show-biz
personality Psoy Korolenko. Conceivably they do not apply to Pavel Lion,

whom I do not know (nor have I read anything he has written).
