Subject: Negative concord

I think it was William Labov who pointed out that every
variety of English that has ever existed anywhere, except
one, has had negative concord.  The exception is, of
course, modern standard English.  This is an exception
simply because Latin's lack of negative concord was imposed
on English by 17th-18th century grammar teachers.
 
Among the languages which require negative concord are
Russian, modern Hebrew, and to some extent French, so
Yiddish is in good company.  For example: /shum yeled lo
akhal levivot/ means 'No child ate latkes'.  No Hebrew
speaker would say or write */shum yeled akhal levivot/, and
if a learner of the language said that I think the result
would be puzzlement: "So did anyone eat or didn't they?"
(Note that /shum yeled/ is really negative: Who ate latkes?
Shum yeled.  'No child.')  Further: /SHUM yeled AF paam LO
akhal levivot be-SHUM mesiba/ 'No child ever ate latkes at
any party.'  Or, Have you every been to Eilat?  Af paam lo.
'Never, keyn mol nisht.'  All perfectly familiar to Yiddish
speakers.  I don't know when all this came into Hebrew.
I'm pretty sure Biblical Hebrew does not have negative
concord.  It might very well be due to Yiddish influence.
I don't have my copy of Haim Blanc's article "Some Yiddish
Influences on Israeli Hebrew" from The Field of Yiddish at
hand.
 
One minor detail: /yeled lo akhal levivot/ means there is a
particular boy who didn't eat latkes, but /ish lo akhal
levivot/ means 'No one ate latkes'.  /ish/ is a negative
word in such contexts, and does not imply necessarily male,
either.  (If you said /ish lo akhal levivot/ when no man
but several women had eaten latkes, hearers would assume
you were pulling their legs.)  But /adam/ 'a person' and
/isha/ 'a woman' work like /yeled/: to say 'no woman ate
latkes' you must have /af/ or /shum/: /shum isha lo akhla
levivot/.  Is there anything like this in Yiddish?
 
Thanks, Ellen, for your interesting points about the
specific/nonspecific contrast with /keyn/.  I'll have to
try it out in Hebrew.
