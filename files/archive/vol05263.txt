Subject: Hasidic yiddish

to steve jacobson: i can second the motion that michael krauss is an authority
(a world authority, i might add) on language death. and i certainly agree with
the assessment that yiddish will remain alive insofar as the chassidic
yiddish-speaking community remains intact. of course, as i said a while back,
given the demographic and linguistic differences between this community and
the former eastern european yiddish-speaking speech community, one would also
predict rather dramatic changes in the language, above and beyond 'normal'
language change. (it would be nice if someone would actually go out and study
this!)

not unrelatedly, i'd be very interested in getting a copy of that novel you
mention, _geknipt un gebindn_ by khaye rosenburg. do you know how i could get
a copy? thanks!

finally, re 'daytshmerisms' in chassidic yiddish, i can tell you that, when i
started getting 'yivo-ized' at the tender age of 40, i was stunned to discover
that the yiddish of my very down-home non-chassidic grandfather, who grew up
with goats and chickens in poland and barely knew the latin alphabet, much
less german, was full of so-called 'daytshmerisms' -- shtunde, monat -- also
farhayret [farheyrat, accg to weinreich] 'married', gestern 'yesterday', leyzn
[lezn, accg to weinreich] 'read', entshuldikn [antshuldikn, accg to weinreich]
'excuse' and many many others. i'm sure my grandfather's reaction to this
labeling would have been similar to the bourgeois gentilhomme's delight at
discovering that he'd been speaking 'prose'. :)

i suspect that poland (and perhaps other western areas of eastern yiddish)
simply had many more recent arrivals from german-speaking lands and lots more
interaction in general than lithuania etc, yielding borrowings that spread
thru the language -- but not as far as vilna and points east... and i
personally find the labeling and stigmatization of words as 'daytshmerisms' to
be obnoxious in general and totally contrary to the spirit of yiddish, a
language whose very genius lies in its openness to influences from language
contact. (when i get really paranoid, i start wondering whether in fact the
yivo mavens didn't actually know this and just pushed the 'daytshmerism' line
to put down the despised galitsianer. ;) )

Subject: Hasidic Yiddish

In Mendele 5.258 Steve Jacobson ask why Hasidic Yiddish contains so many
daytshmerisms. This reminded me of a discussion of "Orthodox orthography" in
Dovid Katz's "Grammar of the Yiddish Language" (p 21). There Katz mentions
that traditional religious communities (in particular Hasidim) often use a
Yiddish spelling convention which is highly influenced by German spelling. He
points to the irony of the fact that such Germanized spelling was developed by
the proponents of the Enlightenment movement and later by revolutionary
parties, both of which were ideologically opposed to the religious tradition
represented by Hasidim and other traditional Orthodox Jews.

Rereading that passage it seems to me that Katz does not quite offer an
explicit explanation of this phenomenon but he seems to imply a simple
explanation which goes like this. In the late nineteenth century such
germanized spelling became standard in Yiddish and despite its having
originated with their ideological enemies traditional Orthodox Jews adopted it
as did other people. When in the early twentieth century modern orthographies
were developed by people who were not as traditionally religiously inclined as
they, traditional religious Jews rejected modern spelling (because it was the
product of people seen by them as secularizers) and just stuck to the old
system, as they still do.

A similar explanation could apply to the Hassidic lexicon. Such daytshmerisms
were once common in written Yiddish. When attempts (largely successful) were
made to expunge them from the language traditional Orthodox Jews did not go
along with those attempts because they were made by people whom they perceived
as opposed to the religious tradition which they hold dear.

Could that be the explanation?

Subject: Can "ober" mean "or"?

My ears still ring with my parents declaiming to me (which I render
phonetically): "Akshin!  S'iz ba dir iber gur iber gurnisht."  In this example
"ober seems to mean "either/or."  My parents, may I hasten to add, were native
speakers, if you call the vicinity of Kiev native ground.

Subject: Ober/oder and correct Yiddish

On the matter of _ober_/_oder_, B. Katz of Guelph, Ontario invokes the
"correct" Yiddish which he was taught at the Talmud Torah of Toronto's Yeshiva
Toras Khayim (of "the late great Rabbi Price").

Without casting aspersions, kholile, on the greatness of Rabbi Price, I can,
nevertheless, comment on the "correctness" of his Yiddish.

I had occasion, some (?) years ago, to attend a small committee meeting at the
Canadian Jewish Congress, then at 150 Beverly St., next door to the
headquarters of the RCMP. Both Rabbi Price and the Rabbi of the "other"
Yeshiva, Rabbi Ochs, were present. Rabbi Price, who had to leave early,
requested at the outset, that the meeting be conducted in Yiddish--no problem,
at that time, for anyone there. He then proceeded, to my surprise, to deliver
his remarks in a most inelegant Yinglish melange, an embarassment for everyone
there. Having said his piece, he took his leave, at which point everone sighed
with relief and Rabbi Ochs remarked, "Itst ken men shoyn redn yidish".

As for the _ober_/_oder_ matter, without speculating on the "reasons" for it,
it's clear that _ober_ 'or'  and _ober_..._ober_ 'either ... or' are
widespread usages. I think we find similar usages in some German dialects as
well.
