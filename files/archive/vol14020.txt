Subject: Table Tennis in Yiddish

Jewish eminence in interwar European table tennis is, or was, a well-known
fact. The list of national team members and national and world champions from
Hungary, Austria, Poland, Romania, et al is long. At the 1930 World
Championships, Lithuania, for example, was represented by M. Blumental, E.
Glikman, M. Glikman, Khone Simensas, H. Urban, and Samuelis Vitkindas--with
one probable exception all Jews. "Officially," i.e., as national team members,
these players probably spoke Lithuanian (though they surely knew Yiddish). But
could they have even talked table tennis in Yiddish? Did an established
terminology exist? Are there sources for it?

Subject: "The Yiddisha Rag"

Tayere Mendelyaner,

Recently my wife and I were at the National Yiddish Book Center (I was
performing in a Yiddish art song concert);  my wife, who's a pianist and
is planning a concert that will include some ragtime pieces, saw on some
wall of the Center the cover of a publication called "The Yiddisha Rag
[sic]."  The sheet music isn't available through the center, and YIVO
doesn't have it either, but perhaps some reader of Mendele could help me
get a copy?  The piece is by "Jos. H. McKeon, Harry M. Piano [sic], and W.
Raymond Walker,"  and the publisher is Harry von Tilzer.

I'd be most grateful for any help - a hartsikn dank, al dos guts,

Subject: Haynt

I am starting a project concerning Jewish-Polish History.

Chaim Finklestein was the last editor of Haynt, the Jewish Daily newspaper in
Warsaw, Poland. His book by the same name, chronicles Jewish life in Poland
between 1908 and 1939.

I am a friend of Yadviga Finklestein, Chaim Finklestein's widow. She is 93 and
lives at Village Shalom in Kansas, USA. She gave me permission of reproduce
Haynt and display it on this website: www.becker-ks.com/haynt.

Haynt was never published in English and may contain historical information
previously unknown to English-only historians . The website makes Haynt
available to Yiddish readers and seeks volunteers to translate a few pages
each into English. I will send a CD containing the complete book to any one
who will translate ten pages. As I receive these translations, I will add the
the English pages to this website and credit the translators for their
contribution.

I would live to correspond with anyone who would be interested in this
project?

Subject: "unter Sorele's vigele"

This is a textual-musical question; I hope I've made it intelligible to
non-musicians!

I have a musical score to an arrangement labeled "Unter Sorele's vigele" in
which (a) there is no text indicated anywhere and (b) there is music for a
second verse! Further, the musical notation for the beginning of the second
verse makes it clear that the verse started NOT with eighth notes the way the
song usually starts, i.e., four short syllables or two iambs ("Un-ter
Sor'-le's"), but with quarter notes, i.e., two long syllables or a spondee.

I don't know a second verse to "Unter Sorele's vigele." Does anyone know a
second verse to the song in which the words in the first measure were set to
quarter notes? The only second verse I have found is in a collection by Y.L.
Cahan, but the words do NOT fit quarter notes.

The arrangement, some of you will not be surprised to learn, is by composer
Leo Zeitlin, after a setting by "J. Schejnin." I would also welcome
information about "J. Schejnin"! The manuscript score was located at YIVO by
musicologist Chana Mlotek.

Many thanks and apologies for multiple postings. Private replies, unless you
think they are of interest to the readership.

Subject: bargisrol

In 1833 in Rendsburg (Schleswig) a book about Yiddish appeared with the
interesting title: _Nothwendiger Einblick ins sogenannte Juden-EbrÑisch, oder Wîrterbuch fÅr
die Gojim, die lernen solle zu seyn Chochum, und wollen begreifen
schmussen als a Bargisrol, Hrsg. von einem Occidentalen_  (35 pp).

Does anybody know the meaning of the word: 'bargisrol'?

Subject: "a balegole lid"

Does anyone out there have information about this yiddish song: "zol ikh zayn
A rov", also known as "a balegole lid"? Who is the author? What are the words?

Subject: tsviyun

I have come across the word 'tsviyun' in  the  essay "di kurlander litvakes"
by B. Rivkin (Borukh Vaynroyb) . From the context  I realize the word
describes a person speaking a  variant of Kurlander Yiddish, but I can't find
the word in Weinreich or Harkavy.    Rivkin gives  Max Weinreich himself as a
prime example of one who speaks this Yiddish. How best  to annotatate this
word?  What is its origin?  Why can't I find a reference to it anywhere?
