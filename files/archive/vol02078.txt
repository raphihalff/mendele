Subject: Introduction

As per your request, an introductory statement.

Ich bin a yid wos is gekommen nach America in 1939 fun
Germany (Berlin). My Yiddish is not as fluent as I would
like, so I'm reverting to English rather than breaking my
tongue (fingers?) trying to continue in Yiddish. Finding a
group like this is, for me a lark. I have no particular
agendaexcept, perhaps to have contact with Yiddishkeit.

Professionally, I am a research psychologist and am
currently a consultant at AT&T Bell Labs.

Max Schoeffler

for moshe taube:

sorry, moshe!!! i'm just very disorganized and don't have a
copy of my paper on hand. but i shall root thru the rubble
that is my office and find one--if you promise to send me a
copy of your paper, the one you gave in jerusalem. and, if
you would be so kind, a copy of your handout with all that
great data, which i carried to tel aviv but managed to lose
somewhere between there and here. a dank dir!

as for the mendele discussion, mikhl asked what those funny
little es's that are not in initial position and are not
arguments of the verb are doing. and so far no one's come
up with an answer, as i recall. so what are they doing?
