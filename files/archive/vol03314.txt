Subject: Jewish Programming on WRNO

This notice was posted to a shortwave radio group. Please note that there
are local stations as well as shortwave stations carrying this
programming. Also, I believe that the shortwave frequency is wrong. It's
given as 7.935 MHz, which is highly unlikely. I believe that the correct
frequency is 7.395.
                        ***

The Judaic Broadcasting Radio Network in Cleveland, Ohio is
pleased to announce the debut of it's new shortwave program:

                Shalom America Worldwide

The program is broadcast Sunday nights at 11pm Eastern Time on
WRNO 7.935 MHz, LIVE from Cleveland Ohio.

The program is hosted in English by longtime broadcsater
Phil Fink, and features Jewish and Israeli music in English
Hebrew, Yiddish and Ladino, as well as recorded comedy, news
from Israel, interviews with newsmakers and entertainers,
and call-in trivia contests via a toll-free number.

Judaic Broadcasting also offers a domestic version of Shalom
America, aired at 7am EST on Sundays on the following stations
WRDZ 1260 AM Stereo (c-quam) Cleveland, Ohio
WWCS 540 AM Stereo (c-quam) Pittsburgh, PA
WNZK 680/690 AM Detroit, MI

For More Information on Judaic Broadcasting and its
programs, call toll free in North America:

Subject: Kol Israel Yiddish, Ladino, & English Broadcasts

These are all shortwave broadcasts. "UTC" is the same as "GMT," which is
British winter time. "EDT" is, of course, Eastern Daylight Time.

17:00-17:30 UTC     1:00-1:30 PM EDT
     to Western Europe & eastern North America  15640, 9435
     to Eastern Europe & western North America  11603, 9845

*LADINO*

     to Asia & Australia                        15650

13:00-13:25 UTC     9:00-9:25 AM EDT
Never on Friday, Saturday, Jewish or Israeli holidays, or the day before
such holidays (therefore, almost always on Sunday!)
     to Western Europe & eastern North America  15640
     to Asia & Australia                        15650

19:00-19:30 UTC     3:00-3:30 PM EDT
     to Western Europe & eastern North America  15640, 11603, 9435
     to Eastern Europe & western North America  11675
     to Africa                                  17575

21:30-22:00 UTC     5:30-6:00 PM EDT
     to Western Europe & eastern North America  11603, 7465
     to Latin America (audible in east N. Am.)  17575, 9435
     to Eastern Europe & western North America  11675

04:00-04:15 UTC   12:00-12:15 AM EDT
     to Western Europe & eastern North America  11605, 9435
     to Asia & Australia                        17545

Shortwave reception depends on a lot of uncontrollable elements,
including solar activity and ionospheric disturbances. If one frequency
isn't audible, try others. If you can't hear anything at one time, try at
another time, and try another day when conditions might be better.
Problems aren't always the fault of your radio, your antenna, or the
broadcaster!

Subject: The integrity of Yiddish

My admiring vote of appreciation goes to Yude Rozof for his stirring
sentiments and well-expressed thoughts on the nature of Yiddish. Perhaps
some of us linguists, with our emphasis on rigorous formalism and,
perhaps, overly prmissive attitude toward usage, forget that there are
other eqally interesting and persuasive ways of looking at language as a
vehicle of cultural transmission.

Subject: Caucasian Jews at the Haifa Museum

The Haifa Museum did indeed have an exhibit on Caucasian Jews, and there
is a catalog available, which includes an article on the literature of
the Jews of this area (although not specifically on the language). For
information, contact Ora Ilani, Haifa Museum of Music and Ethnology,
P.O.B. 45134, Haifa 31451. She can also be reached by fax at
972-4-552714. (Postal services in Israel, incidentally, are vastly
improved in recent years, and are totally trustworthy these days.)

Subject: Yidishe-frantsoyzishe shenanigans

Apropos of earlier postings, I'm forwarding some items from my friend
Steve Tobias, who has some experience in French-Yiddish border regions:

All I have to offer in this vein and possibly worth relaying back to
Mendele is my late father-in-law's quote from the lady in the apartment
building where he lived in Paris in 1935.  Down the staircase she yelled:

Marcel!  Mach attention! Du vest eruntertomben fun die escalier!

And then there was Mickey Robinson's mother, in Geneva, who told me that
at the casino at Evian she once eavesdropped on two women who were
planning a canasta party.  "Abat-jour chez moi," said one of them,
concluding the plan (Mickey's mom inferred that she meant ibermorgen when
she said abat-jour).

Subject: Daytchmerisms, the "principle of specificity"

In the ongoing discussion about the principle of specificity,
daytchmerisms, and the whole business of lexical planning, no one
mentions (maybe since everyone knows about it already?), that the second
half of Dovid Katz's book Tikney Takones, on Yiddish "stylistics" deals
with precisely these questions, and is quite critical of the blanket
rejection of daytchmerisms, and the planning of Yiddish lexicon so as to
distance the language from German. I recently found an article arguing
along the same lines by M. Shapiro, the compiler of the Russian-Yiddish
dictionary published several years ago, in Moscow. The article, which
gives an overview of Yiddish lexicography in general and discusses the
virtues and flaws of Weinreich's dictionary, is to be found in issue #4,
1994 of "Yungvald", the supplement to Sovetish Heimland -- not easy to
get a hold of, but well worth the effort.
