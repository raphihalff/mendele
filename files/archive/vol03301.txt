Subject: Periphrastic verbs

To answer your question Jeremy, from what I have learned from my Yiddish
course I am taking now, ich bin zich moyde would seem to be the correct
answer.  Our teachers explains this as such: When conjugating verbs, any
"attachments", whether it be the reflexive zich, pronouns or the such,
they should follow the active verb in the sentence.  Thus in this case
the active verb is bin and so the zich should follow the bin.  So if my
logic is right, if you put the same sentence into the past tense you
should have the following: ich bin zich geven moyde.

P.S. I may be wrong.

Subject: Vayter migldik

Meylekh asks for documentation on the use of migldik in written and or
sopken Yiddish, implying  that such documentation would settle the issue
under dispute between the usage of migldik vs. the usage of ekldik. But
it seems to me that he is missing the point or origen of the discussion.
I don't believed that anyone asserted that migldik could not be regarded
as a Yiddish word. The point was that it was very rare, in fact not even
listed as such in Harkavy. the common, proper Yiddish word was ekldik.
Someone then complaind that ekldik should be regard as a daytchmerism and
that migldik was preferable. It was at that point that the obscurity of
migldik was pointed out.

In fact I find that that has frequently been the pattern of the
discussions with those who are militantly opposed to perceived
daytchmerisms.  Someone writes in to Menedle using proper Yiddish and a
militant rushes in to say that it is incorrect, me tor nisht! One should
rather use some obscure slavic or hebrew or italian synonym. When its
obscurity is pointed out, and the standard nature of the original version
is emphsized, the reply invariably is that the variant is not as obscure
as all that so why should there be an argument.  Why indeed?

Subject: Salte noces

I am probably going to open mouth and insert foot, but judging from a
conversation already in progress when I joined it, it seemed to me that
someone was trying to find out what salte noces are.

They are cheese kreplach.

Now if the discussion was about the derivation of the words from
middle-Indo-Serbo-Crotation, I apologize for misunderstanding what the
discussion was about.  However, if I am right, I have a recipe for them
in a Jewish cookbook that refers to them by that name.

Am I in trouble?

Subject: Sarg/sargenes, [z]/[s]

Mikhl Herzog writes in response to Marnen Laibow-Koser:

The [z] pronounciation of word-initial "s" in German holds for most of
the northern dialects, but in many southern dialects (such as spoken in
Bavaria and Austria) word-initial "s" is in fact generally pronounced
[s]. "Sarg" would be pronounced with an [s] in these dialects, so the
connection may not be merely visual. The Austrian dialects in particular
share other phonological features with Yiddish, such as unaspirated
[p,t,k] in positions where they would be aspirated in the northern
dialects of German.
