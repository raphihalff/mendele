To support one of Yugntrufs main goals geographic communities of
Yiddish speakers we are creating a Database of Yidish-dires
[apartments], for those that would like to live near other
Yiddish-speaking people.

Whats a Yidish-dire?

Simply put, an apartment/home/etc. which is on the market, which is
itself near an apartment or home where Yiddish is spoken daily. Near
means: either next door, or just in the same neighborhood.

Whats the point here?

To gather information about potential Yiddish apartments (or houses)
which are near already Yiddish-speaking apartments or houses. In this
way a person whos interested in moving into a Yiddish-speaking area, or
in creating one, will have the necessary information.

Is this only applicable to New York?

No! Wherever you are, if you speak Yiddish and you know of a place, send
in the information! You don't need to be a Yugntruf member, either.

What information should we send in?

  1. Name of informant (the person who=92s sending in the information)
  2. Address of informant (the =93Yiddish-speaking=94 house/apartment)
  3. Address of the potential =93Yidish-dire=94
  4. Description of the potential Yidish-dire (number of rooms, etc.)
  5. Price/rent of the potential =93Yidish-dire=94
  6. Contact information (either for the informant, or for the
     real-estate agent/broker/etc. who is dealing with the property)

Where should we send the information?

yugntruf@yugntruf.org
With time, if there are enough respondents, we will put the information
on the Web.

From: Norman Fruman <fruma001@tc.umn.edu>
Subject: Frumet/Frimet/Fruman/etc.

Zachary Baker's excerpt on the names Frumet/Frimet from Alexander
Beider's forthcoming book "A Dictionary of Ashkenazic Given Names,"
reminded me at once of a check my sister ran on our family name FRUMAN
in the Nahum Goldmann Museum of the Jewish Diaspora. The account begins
with the surprisingly blunt statement, which I have before me: "FRUMAN
is a Yiddish abbreviated variant of ABRAHAM." We are then treated to
what appears to be a learned etymological discourse. "The first
syllable, AB, which is the common Semitic term for 'father' often
becomes AV, resulting in Avram, Avraham, and similar variants. The
second A is frequently pronounced O, leading to forms like Abrom and
Afrom, subsequently abbreviated to From/Frum."

All this strikes me, to put it gently, as excessively assured. Many
years ago, a distant immigrant cousin assured me that the name FRUMAN
first appeared in a 17th-century Ukrainian shtetl when Jews were
required by law to adopt family names. He insisted further that
everyone who legitimately spells the name as Fruman is related.

Does anyone have anything resembling verifiable knowledge about all
this? A great deal is being asserted about the etymology of names
without adequate documentation.

Subject: Frumer/frimet, Frume/Frime

With regard to Frumet/Frimet, we owe Zachary Baker thanks for citing
Beider's etymology, which appears to admit of no argument. I do,
however, have doubts about Beider's assertion that Frume/Frime are
hypocoristic forms of those names. Frume/Frime appears in Romance for
both men and women as Pio and Pia, and is in common use in both Italian
(Pia) and Spanish (Pio). Beider's reasons for making that assumption
are not given and the two Ashkenazic names, Frumet/Frimet and
Frume/Frime may very well have completely different etymologies; in the
latter case, not a folk etymology in the sense that that term is
usually employed. It would hardly be the first case of two very similar
words having different etymologies. I recall that Hugh Denman proposed
the possibility of different etymologies for Kalye and Kalyiker despite
their semantic and phonetic similarities. While still having difficulty
in agreeing with Dr. Denman, I would certainly not be prepared to take
a hard position that his view is less than likely.

Subject: Romeo & Juliet

This is the 26th year of Buffalo NY's "Shakespeare in the Park." Having
just enjoyed a charming performance of Romeo & Juliet, I wondered
whether someone had, and could post, a  yiddish translation of the
"Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo..." scene. Both a classic and a
"shund" rendition would be appreciated.

Subject: Death as a musician

Tayere mendelyaner,

I'm looking for some reference in Yiddish literature, theater, or film,
to the figure of Death personified as a musician, playing music at a
deathbed until that person's life is over ('der toyt shpilt oys a nigun
bay emetsens a bet").  This intriguing image appears in a 1934 poem by
Rikuda Potash and I'm trying to determine if it has antecedents.

A hartsign dank aykh alemen in foroys,

Subject: Tsores

In response to Mel Poretz [11.004]:

The Yiddish word Tsores (sometimes pronounced Tsures, or Tsoris)comes from
the plural form of the Hebrew word Tsarah = trouble, woe.

Hebrew singular form is Tsarah; Yiddish sigular form: Tsoreh (or Tsureh)
Hebrew plural form : Tsarot; Yiddish plural form: Tsores (or Tsures).
