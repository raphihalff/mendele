Subject: An Introduction

After an absence of nearly three years, I am finally back on the internet and
am delighted to have rejoined Mendele.  I co-ordinate the creative workshop of
the South African Board of Jewish Education, where my staff and I are
currently building a multi-media didactic exhibition on Jerusalem to cater to
the educational needs of the school children, the dialectic sensibilities of
the adult community and the creative stimulation of the little ones.

I also have an insatiable passion for the Yiddish language which I am slowly
clambering through by means of parallel texting and have been wading and
sometimes drowning in Kafka's Der Protses.

I have a Fine Arts degree from the University of the Witwatersrand and am a
printmaker.

And other than all those external features, I simply cannot wait to receive my
regular doses of Mendele!  So, this is me and I am thrilled to be here once
again.  I hope my connection with the Internet proves to be long and fruitful.

Subject: A reading suggestion

I offer this suggestion for Yiddish Reading Groups, Vinkl, etc.  In a group I
lead we're reading this year Itzik Manger's _Di vunderlekheh lebns-bashreibung
fun shmueyl abervu_ (dos bukh fun gan-eyden), and enjoying it tremendously.
Unfortunately, this was never published in a separate volume (the translation
was), so it necessitates photocopying.  But it's well worth it.
