Subject: Jewish English or "Hebonics"

The Encino School Board has declared Jewish English a second language.
Backers of the move say the district is the first in the nation to
recognize Hebonics as the language of many of America's Jews.  Here
are some descriptions of the characteristics of the language, and
samples of phrases in standard English and Jewish English.  Samples of
Pronunciation Characteristics Jewish English or "Hebonics" hardens
consonants at the ends of words.  Thus, "hand" becomes "handt."  The
letter "W" is always pronounced as if it were a "V". Thus "walking"
becomes "valking".  "R" sounds are transformed to a guttural utterance
that is virtually impossible to spell in English.  It's "ghraining"
"algheady".

Samples of Idiomatic Characteristics Questions are always answered
with questions:

   Question:          "How do you feel?"
   Hebonics response: "How should I feel?"

The subject is often placed at the end of a sentence after a pronoun
has been used at the beginning:

  "She dances beautifully, that girl."

The sarcastic repetition of words by adding "sh" to the front is used
for emphasis: "mountains" becomes "shmountains" and "turtle" becomes
"shmurtle"

Sample Usage Comparisons

Standard English Phrase                 Hebonics Phrase
        ----------------------------------------------
"He walks slow"                         "Like a fly in the ointment, he
walks"
"You're sexy"                           "Oy!  So shmaltzie, this girl is
here.
                                         Let me look at you."
"Sorry, I do not know the time"         "What do I look like, a clock?"
"I hope things turn out for the best"   "You should BE so lucky"
"Anything can happen"                   "It's never so bad, it can't get
                                         worse"

Subject: Kheshbn/khezhbm

Those who might be interested in a more thorough treatment of the
pronunciation of nun after a bilabial ("b" or "p") as in "lebm", "zibm"
(and of course "khezhbm") might want to consult Mordkhe Shekhter's
excellent intermediary textbook "Yidish Tsvey".  The author likewise
points out other phonetic features not captured in Yiddish spelling: for
instance, unvoicings in front of unvoiced consonants like "ret-takt"
(=stress group) as opposed to "red-loshn" (spoken language). the
standard Yiddish word for "noun" is spelled "suBstantiv" but pronounced
"suPstantiv".  The "s" vanishes before a "sh": "oys-shepn" is pronounced
"oy-shepn, etc.

I've been defending Weinreich's excellent books, and I think that
Shekhter's grammar does a fabulous job of picking up where Weinreich
left off.
