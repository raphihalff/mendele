Subject: Introduction

Shalom, Chevre,

Today it rained in Jerusalem. A good sign. Unusual for Iyar.

My name is Yohanan (John Weininger), I'm a library
student at Hebrew Univ.  I'm originally from
Schenectady, NY. Made aliyah in Feb. 1992.  I've worked
here in typing, translating, printing. Now I'm doing
library studies (Judaic Studies library track),
including this course in communications, internet
access good thru 9/93.

I'm a pitzel intelligentz for Yiddish. My only formal
Yiddish study have been in:

  -  the beginner's class at Columbia YIVO Summer 1981
     (lererin Chava Lapin); and

  -  auditing the Yiddish bibliographic orientation
     course this last semester.

This is my first ever posting on Internet. Neat that
there's a Yiddish newsletter. I'll spread Mendele's
scope about. Tack up a print out of Mendele's address
and doings on the department bulletin board, Municipal
library, etc. Look forward, with time and better
emacsing to share notes on Jerusalem's Yiddish library
resources. Zeit gezunt.

Yohanan

Subject: Re: Id/Yid

I am wondering if the id/Yid issue is operative in the
"itst" "yetst" pair? I learned "itst" from my
Russia-via-Argentina teacher Pesach Fiszman.  When I
said "itst" to a Russian immigrant, she didn't know
what I was saying. Finally she said "oh!  you mean
*yetst!*"

Pesach said he was always conscious of his "accent"
(from?) which prevented him from easily pronouncing the
"y" of Yidish.

Can anyone shed light on this?  Is it hypercorrection?

Subject: various

A. My request for idiomatic expressions elicited two
responses.  One was from Mikhl Herzog elaborating on
"Gut morgn, Gele" by adding the phrase "retekh trog
ikh".  The second came to me directly rather than
through Mendele, and moreover I don't know who sent it.
The sender either did not receive or did not respond to
my query regarding his identity. (Please tell me who
you are!).  He sent the following contribu- tions:

1.  "Er hot ir (zi) avekgezetzt af a lyeyke."  He
jilted her.

2.  "Khotsh gib im dos telerl fun himl."  He is
unreasonably demanding.

3.  "(Verb-n) vi a shikerer goy pisht."  To (verb)
sloppily or awkwardly. E.g., "Er shraybt vi a.s.g.p."
He has a terrible handwriting.

4.  "A nayer gast in shtetl!"  Roughly = "Di tsveyte
teg yontef!"

5.  "Es bayst mir in beytsim."  I couldn't care less.

6.  "Me redt, me redt, un me shushket zikh."  Said
when someone says something revealing that he/she
hasn't been following the discussion, or hasn't
understood what has just been clearly stated--for
example, by asking a klots-kashe.

7.  "Klap zikh kop on vant un shray `Bravo!'"  In
response to "What's to be done?" in situations where
no course of action is satisfactory.  Also in response
to "I'm bored, but I don't know what I want to do."

Since then, perfect silence.  So I'll make a brief
comment on the submission, and add a few more of my
own in hopes of stimulating further contributions.

Number 7 is a conflation of two that I know
separately.  "Shlog zikh kop in vant" was used when
one had unsuccessfully tried everything, in the sense,
"all you can do is shlog..."  When kids complained
that they had nothing to do, the response bay undz was
"patsh zikh in tokhes un shray bravo."   That reminds
me: when a kid rejected all of the foods that were
being offered he was told, "Es broyt mit tsung."

How about these?:
Er makht zikh nit visndik.  He acts as though he
didn't notice, wasn't aware, didn't know.

Er tut azoy vi nit im meynt men.  Similar to the
preceding.

Zi iz aroys fun di keylim.  She lost control (got very
angry).

Er krikht oyf di glaykhe vent.  He is beside himself.

Es tut zikh oyf tish un oyf benk.  There's a lot of
activity, lots going on (with a hint of confusion).

M'hot im genumen oyfn tsimbl.  He was called upon [not
in a friendly way] to account for his behavior.

Let's have some more!

B. Ya tebe dam.
I'm glad to have the Russian gloss, which reminds me of
its Germanic calque "Ikh'l dir (bald) gebn", which, as
someone pointed out regarding the Russian, is a mild
threat.  It can be strengthened in the following
manner: "Ikh'l dir gebn, vestu hobn!"

C. Slippers
Has anyone mentioned "pantofl"?  In my home it was
used interchangeably with "shtekshikh", with the lat-
ter much more frequent.  Those were the only two words
I knew for "slippers", but I recall that some time in
1937 or 1938 I heard a song on WEVD called "Lekoved
Shabes" one of whose couplets ran something like
"lekoved shabes, tu ikh oys di shkrabes".  I asked my
grandmother the meaning of "shkrabes" and she said
they were "shtekshikh".  Harkavy, however, has
"shkrab" 'worn out shoe'.

D. "Shtokh' is from "shtekhn", to stick or prick,
particularly the thrust of a needle in sewing.  "A
shtokh" is a stitch, or figuratively, a dig.
