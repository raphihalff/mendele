Subject: gilgul

Re: Josh Kleiman's statement that the word "gilgul" was used to refer to
the Diaspora.  This is certainly news to me.

I suspect that perhaps he is mistaking "gilgul" for "goles," which indeed
does refer to the Diaspora. A "gilgul" does mean the transmigrated soul,
per the kabalistic doctrine of reincarnation.  A popular notion, in fact,
is that tzaddikim become "nisgalgal" in fish.

Certain groups of Hungarian khsidim do not eat fish during Passover (don't
ask me why) so they make a gefilte-fish like dish out of chicken, which is
called "falshe fish" (fake fish).  I once heard a badkhn at a khasene
remark,

"Me zogt az tsadikim vern nisgalgel in fish. Azoy iz farshtendlekh farvos
ungarishe yidn darfn "falshe fish"- vayl in ungarn zenen geven a sakh
falshe tsadikim."

(It is said that the righteous are reincarnated as fish. Thus, it is
understandable why Hungarian Jews need to have "fake fish" since in Hungary
there were many fake tzadikim.)

Obviously, the badkhen was a galitsiyaner.

Subject: San Francisco Chronicle Obituary of Eli Katz

Dear Mendele:

The following is a letter I submitted via e-mail to the San Francisco
Chronicle in response to their mostly lovely obituary of Professor Eli
Katz; I thought the contents would be of interest to our list, as well:

As a scholar of Yiddish literature, I was moved to read on-line Rick
DelVecchio's obituary of the great translator and educator Eli Katz
(Saturday, July 29). I was nonetheless extremely distressed to read that in
the article Mr. DelVecchio incorrectly refers to Yiddish as "a German
dialect." Yiddish is a language that has pursued an independent line of
development from German since the beginning of its 1000-year existence; the
first Yiddish document, dating from 1272, already indicates several social
and linguistic differences from contemporaneous German, the most
superficial of them the fact that Yiddish is written in the Hebrew
alphabet. In linguistic terms, Yiddish is a fusion language incorporating
vocabulary and morphological elements from medieval Romance languages,
Slavic languages, pre-modern Hebrew and Aramaic, as well as Middle High
German. To refer to it as a dialect of German is no more accurate than to
call English or Dutch German dialects, or to call Ukrainian a dialect of
Russian. Obviously, the issue is a sensitive one because Yiddish speakers
have struggled for more than 200 years against the slander that their
language isn't really a language--with its own grammar, rules of usage, and
cultural values-but rather a "deformed" variant of German. I'm certain that
it wasn't Mr. DelVecchio's intention, or the intention of the Chronicle, to
perpetuate this insult. I am therefore asking now that you correct this
error--an error to which I'm certain Eli Katz would have protested
vociferously!

Thank you for your attention to this request, as well as your kind
attention to the career of Dr. Katz.

Sincerely,
Marc Caplan

Subject: Martyr's Tears

The question in Mendele Vol. 16.004 was about possible folk belief, which
teaches that "one is forbidden from wiping away a martyr's tears." That I
don't know; however, I remember some kind of a discussion in, by the way,
not a Jewish circle, which referred to prophet Isaiah saying something to
that effect. I checked the Tanakh (in the JPS Translation 1988 edition),
and it says in Nevi'im Isaiah 25:8,

He will destroy death forever
My Lord God will wipe the tears away
>From all faces
And will put an end to the reproach of His people
Over all the earth...

Maybe it has something to do with the question, in the sense, that it is
Lord God's prerogative?

Regards,
Lyuba Dukker

Subject: Chaim Pevner's "Yiddish, A Dying Language"

Chaim Pevner's "Yiddish, A Dying Language" elicited a remarkable response
on the discussion of what is authentic Yiddish, with most correspondents
opposed to his premise and endorsing diversity.  However, actual numbers of
people still speaking Yiddish was not touched on.

Before the khurbm there were estimates of between 8 and 11 million; in the
latter part of the 20th century even 1 million; but now, at the beginning
of the 21st century, can there really be more than circa 350,000?

In the former Soviet Union and also in Israel, Yiddish was stifled: while
in English speaking countries, Latin America and Western Europe, the
pressures of integration also hindered the passing-on of the language to
the next generation. In fact, the only social group that = actively teaches
the language to its children is the Khasidim.

If there are about 300,000 Khasidim then, who speak Yiddish, can there be
more than a few thousands of either the original secular generation still
with us or ardent Yiddishists who have taken up Yiddish as a second
language?
