Subject: Swiss Yiddish and Swiss German

Velvl Wincour asks me to clarify what I said and to account for the impression
he says he once had that Swiss German sounded like Odessa Yiddish. I think I
can account for this perception by pointing out that, in general, people have
a some perhaps innate way of seizing on one or a small number of features of a
language or dialect and treating it as characteristic. For example, people who
have never heard Polish before and have no learned stereotypes about it (e.g.,
Indians) immediately seize on the supposed frequency of 'ch' and 'sh' sounds
in Polish with such regularity that this cannot be an accident.  And amazingly
enough this seems to be what we Poles (I happen to be Polish) think too at
some level, because the sentence which we like to taunt foreigners by asking
them to repeat it, knowing they cannot is: W Szczebrzeszynie chsza,szcz brzmi
w trzcinie, where all the the 'cz', 'sz', 'rz', and even 'ci' are 'ch'/'sh'
kinds of sounds!  Moreover, people whose languages lack nasal vowels and
especially nasal diphthongs (unlike most Indian languages) often report that
Polish sounds like Portuegese presumably because they hear the nasal
diphthongs as highly characteristic.  All this is a poorly studied subject
incidentally.  In fact, I only know of one serious study.  The problem of
course is that you have to exclude people who have learned preconceptions,
e.g., most Americans have heard that German is 'guttural' and so American
perceptions of German have to be treated with caution.  The best thing is to
have people listen to samples of languages they have never heard about and not
even tell them what languages they are! 

Having said this by way of preliminaries, I think there are two factors here. 
One is that Yiddish like Swiss German has rather distinctly "guttural" ways of
pronouncing the sound written as 'ch' in German and as 'kh' in
transliterations of Yiddish, much more "guttural" (I am not going to worry
about what this means precisely here) than Standard German.  I think this is
what Velvl may have subconsciously seized on, because I cannot think of
anything else that Swiss German and the kind of Yiddish Velvl is talking about
(Yiddish of Odessa, not Swiss Yiddish!) have in common.  The other factor (and
I apologize in advance to those who might be offended) is a set of rather
widespread feelings and myths about Yiddish in relation to other languages,
such as the need to find that Yiddish is as different as possible from the
German of Germany (because of the terrible associations of not so distant
past) with the correlated tendency to exaggerate the similarity to OTHER
Germanic languages, which are not associated with the indelible memory of what
Hitler, Goebbels, and so on sounded like.  My mother, for example, who speaks
Yiddish and recently learned a fair amount of Dutch, would exaggerate the
similarities of Dutch and Yiddish, which in reality are much less similar and
much less closely related than Yiddish is to German.  A special manifestation
of this second factor is that throughout Europe there are still people who
express their feelings about Germany and its past by pretending not to
understand German.  This is a staple theme to this day in Dutch literature, as
is the somewhat contradictory theme of UNDESTANDING German alright but
steering people who speak in the wrong directions (e.g., telling them to turn
left instead of right, etc.).  Since Swiss German is about as close (or
distant) to Yiddish as to German, and since in addition Standard German is
taught in all Swiss German areas, is the language of the radio, newspapers,
etc., it is inconceivable that any Swiss German would undertsnad Yiddish and
not German.  But it is not inconceivable for some Swiss Germans at some times
to pretend this-- and this is what I believe happened to the Mendelist (I am
sorry I deleted the posting before noting his name) who says he could
communicate with a Swiss German in Yiddish but not in German. 

However, all this has nothing to do with Swiss Yiddish, which almost no Swiss
Christian has ever heard, and which is in some superficial respects like Swiss
German but at a deeper level quite different from it (and indeed arrived in
Switzerland from somewhere in SW Germany very recently).  My earlier postings
were about Swiss Yiddish, and so were not at all relevant to the question of
why someone might perceived EASTERN EUROPEAN Yiddish to be like Swiss German
in some way.  I hope, though, to have answered the latter question now.

Subject: Jewish wars

Re: Leeson vs Neugroschel in [08.009]. Smells of powder. But to be absolutely
accurate, the libretto of "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" was by Jules Barbier and
Michel Carre (that is "e" with an accute accent, in case accents don't come
through). 

As to Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Halevy (with a "y"), apart from Bizet's
"Carmen", they did work also for Offenbach ("La Belle Helene", "La
Perichole").

A. M. Ramer wrote:  "I have been killing time reading Rosten's books on
Yiddish and Yinglish, and I keep coming across some almost incredible
blunders, such as the idea that mat 'checkmate' is of German (rather than
Arabic) origin." 

It is ultimately of Persian origin.

Subject: Questions about kissing

I have two questions, one of which IS about Yiddish, the other not so
much(:-).  The first is this: in some Western European dialects of Yiddish, a
girl who is too free with her favors is called a mezuze (for the obvious
reason that a mezuze is something which every Tom, Dick, and Harry gets to
kiss), and what I would like to know if this usage is known in Eastern
European Yiddish. 

The second question is whether in kissing the mezuze, one first touches the
fingers to the lips and then the to the mezuze, or rather first touch the
mezuze and then the lips.  I know the second question is nothing to do with
Yiddish per se but I would really appreciate any information (which can be
sent to me privately).

Subject: lists of Yiddish names

In response to Lori's question: Chabad Lubavitch of Southern Ontario published
a small book in 1986 called "Yiddishe Nachas: A Guide to Jewish Family Life".
It may have been republished since, and may also be published by or available
from other Lubavitch centres. I have it here;  the last portion of the book
has a list of Hebrew and Yiddish names. 

Other Jewish name books may also include Yiddish names. Lori, if you can't
find a similar publication, send me a fax number and I'll fax you the list.
(It doesn't have meanings, but it does indicate whether the source of the name
is biblical, talmudic, Yiddish or Hebrew/Israeli.)

Subject: Yiddish names

Lori (Lippitz) Chinitz asked about a list of Yiddish names.  Harkavy's Yiddish
English Hebrew Dictionary has such a list well hidden starting on page 525 of
the edition reprinted in 1988 by YIVO.  Transliterations are at the end of
each entry.

From: AJ Gilboa <bfgilboa@weizmann.weizmann.ac.il>
Subject: meire

I have had the opportunity to discuss this with Professor Yosef Bar-El of Bar
Ilan University. He informs me that Harkavy has dealt with this word.
According to Harkavy 'meire' in the sense of a portion of dough is found in
various modifications in several Slavic languages, including Lithuanian and
Russian. A well-educated Russian (Ukrainian, actually), whom I asked, did not
recognize this word so perhaps it is an archaic usage. 

Incidentally, Bar El is the author of a learned article "Vi alt is Yentl?"
tracing the appearance and the source of Yente and Yachne in Yiddish. Gentilla
and Hyacinta seem to be well established as the original forms of these two
names. 

Yosef Gilboa

[Moderator's note: It is strange that Yosef Gilboa's "Russian/Ukrainian" 
informant did not recognize the word. _Mera_ in Russian (_mira_ in Ukrainian) 
is not at all archaic. One of the meanings is that of a unit of volume, that
contains 1 pud (40 Russian or 36 British pounds). It's a lot of motses!  i.v.]
