Subject: Ochtzig-neintzig

Apropos the discussions of 99 [777, a local brandy might be
more appropriate with the approach of Purim], yeshiva
bocherim are using the expression, "ochtzig neintzig" to
denote pay tzadee or putz.

And in the Purim spirit, "What comes between fear and sex?"

A: Finf.

I don't see how that would fit into the context of the
article that was cited.  My wife uses the expression to
mean "don't count your chickens until they are hatched."

derekh agev, M.M.B. iz take dokter shekhter.  er nitst

Subject: feygelekh

"leyg zikh nit keyn feygelekh in buzem" in my experience
means something like "give up your optimistic illusions."
"er leygt zikh feygelekh in buzem" would mean he has
foolishly unrealistic expectations.

Subject: Yiddish /f/ and Ukrainian various

David Braun asked about correspondences between Yiddish /f/
and various things in Ukrainian.  The story starts in 9th
century c.e. or so.  The /f/ of Byzantine Greek was new to
Slavic.  It was borrowed by the Slavs in their literary
practice, but dialects (Ukrainian and others) made various
substitutions:  [p], [kh], [khv], [v], [t].  Some of these
versions show up in literary forms as well, e.g., Russian
_parus_ 'sail' from Greek _faros_, Ukrainian _khvirtka_
'gate' from German _Pfortchen_; names like _Pilip_, _Khoma_
(Russian _Filip_, _Foma_), Ukrainian and Russian _Marta_.
Note that as far as borrowings from Greek are concerned,
/f/ or its substitutes replace both phi and theta.

     Correction:  the Russian version of "Martha" is
_Marfa_, not _Marta_, at least in the literary language.

     The extrapolation of all of this to Yiddish depends on
the words you have in mind, i.e., are they
internationalisms, borrowings from a Slavic standard
language, part of the Germanic component, etc.
