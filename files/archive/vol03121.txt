Subject: Introduction

I am Ernest (Ernie) Kurnow. In Yiddish Ezra. I'm Professor Emeritus
of Statistics at New York University,but am still teaching. I've
been bilingual from the day I learned to speak. I'm a 1927 graduate
of the Arbeiter Ring Mittelschul. Are there other alumni out there?

Seit mir alle gezunt,

Ezra

Subject: pronunciation of the holem in Ashkenazic Hebrew

I have read that the pronunciation of the "holem" in Ashkenazic
Hebrew was [OY] as in Hebraic words in Yiddish (in other than a
final unstressed syllable).  However, in the Jewish sunday school
which I attended (in Calif.) in the 1950s we were taught that the
"holem" was pronounced [O], and this was said to be the Ashkenazic
pronunciation (along with certain other features which were
different from the Sephardic pronunciation). They never said
anything about an [OY] pronunciation in words like "borah" or
"leolam". Why was the supposedly Ashkenazic pronunciation we were
taught different from that which I read about in Weinreich's history
of Yiddish and other books? Is it a dialect difference? If so where
does our "Jewish Sunday school" dialect stem from?

Subject: tsherida

U. Weinreich defines "tsherede" as "flock"; Harkavy adds "herd" and
"gang". So the import of the line that Bob Poe's mother recalls (bin
ikh mir a tsig, un peyger oykh in tsherida) may have to do with a
feeling of common cause or common fate.  Another--less
likely--interpretation is suggested by "tshere", for which Weinreich
gives "turn//es iz gekumen mayn tshere=my turn came"; so, "I'm a
goat, and my turn to die is coming too".  Maybe both?

Bob Poe writes:

Actually "tsherede" is a slavic word for 'flock'.

The overall meaning here is about the same, I'd say ...

Subject: A shayle vegn shikh

When we discussed Yiddish words for slippers last year, no one
mentioned _meshte_.  I found it in Sholem Aleichem ("Di Freylikhe
Companye") and only then remembered that it was my bubbe's word for
her felt slippers, but not the one my zeyde used for his "romeos"
(pantuflyes). The rest of us wore shtekshikh.

I remember this as well: every time my bubbe mentioned her meshtes,
my mother laughed.  I never asked why.  Now I wonder this:  My
grandmother came from a dorf, her husband and children from a
shtetl.  Might _that_ be the cause of the mirth, meshtes being
Slavic and boondockish, the other two German or French and urbane?

Snobbery in Shpikov?  Kholile!  I hope there's a better answer.
