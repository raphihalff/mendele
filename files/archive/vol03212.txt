Subject line: Philadelphia Yiddish Radio

Rob Frantz asked about Yiddish radio programs in Philadelphia. Now
here is how to receive them. First you get a really old radio! Tune
to WDAS around 40 years ago. You will be able to hear Seymour
Rechseit, Sheindele the Chazante, Yeider Fru's Farlang etc.  all
sponsored by Planters Peanut oil - gut for kochen, gut for bachen,
for di Shubbis for di vachen.  S'is gut S'is gut!!

Subject: strong Yiddish verbs

Does anyone know of a published (or unpublished) alphabetized list
of past participles of strong Yiddish verbs which have vowel changes
from the infinitives? I want something whereby, for example, if one
reads or hears the word GEYOYRN one could look up this word and see
that it is the past participle of YERN which means "to ferment". I
know that Weinreich's "College Yiddish" lists a number of such
participles in the Yiddish to English glossary, but the onlylist I
know of which seems to aim at comprehensiveness is in a Russian
Yiddish grammar published a couple of years ago.

Arre Komar's submission of the Yiddish version of Joe Hill was
wonderful!  If anyone can supply other verses I, too, would like to
read them.

Subject:  The Jews of Ioannina

To those who are interested in pursuing the history and culture of
Romaniot Jews in Ioannina, Greece, I would like to refer you to the
following, recently published book:

Dalven, Rae [Rachel].  The Jews of Ioannina.  Philadelphia: Cadmus
Press, 1990.  xiv, 227 p.:  illus.  (Bibliography:  pp. 211-219.)

I do not have the book in front of me (I'm sitting in my nephew's
apartment in La Jolla, and am away from my usual locale), but I did
hear the late Prof. Dalven speak on several occasions, regarding her
ancestral city, at Sephardic studies conferences held at Yeshiva
University, back in the late 1970s. (Prof. Dalven died about two
years ago.)  She was one of the very few scholars to study modern
Romaniot Jewry on an intensive level.

This reference is directed to the particular attention of Kalmen
Weiser, Jascha Kessler and Mikhl Herzog (MENDELE 3.209, 211).

As an aside, I am working on a paper for presentation at the June
conference of the Association of Jewish Libraries, entitled "Some
Problems in the Romanization of Ladino/Judezmo." I will be devoting
the bulk of my remarks to a critique of current Library of Congress
practices in this area, and any suggestions that I proffer will be
tentative, since I am not a specialist in this area.

California)

Subject: Introduction

Shalom, all.  I'm a Baltic and Slavic linguist.  My yiddish is bad--
3rd generation Am pidgin yiddish.  But I'm a Lithuanian specialist,
so perhaps occasionally I can have something to contribute re
coteritorial lang.  I'm esp. interested in yid. borrowings in Lith.
I've been back to Lith twice, including my grandparents' home
village (Shaky [Lith shakiai'], pop. as of 1892 3000 Jews, 2000
Lithuanians)  I'm a real Litvak.

Subject: Problems and solutions

In this past Sunday's New York Times (Week in Review p. 1( Charles
Silberman wrote: "'The mere existence of a problem,' a Yiddish
proverb tells us, 'is no proof of the existence of a solution.'"
Could someone give us the Yiddish original?
