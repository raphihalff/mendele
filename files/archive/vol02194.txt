Subject: Re: Sayings

I was brought up in a Yiddish speaking house and was in
the first ever Yiddish class in Melbourne.
Unfortunately, due to family circumstances (marriage to
a non-Yiddish speaking girl, whose parents barely
understood Yiddish) I have not used the language for
quite a considerable time but I derive great pleasure
from Mendele and am renewing my studies.

A sheynam dank ,

Pantoufles are "slippers" in French.   Did your family
have some contact with France?

would anyone out there know of any demographic research
on the migrations of jews eastward in the middle ages
from german-speaking lands to slavic-speaking lands?

Subject: Introduction

My mother's parents both spoke Yiddish, more so my
grandmother, as my grandfather considered it a "woman's
language", though I think it had more to do with his
wanting to be "American" and only speaking English.

Ever since I was a small child I was fascinated by it.
Since my mother's family lived in Brooklyn, E. 92nd
St., there were plenty of opportunities to hear it. I'd
even buy copies of Farvart (spelling?) and try my hand
at it.

Of course that was many years ago, but the fascination
lingers. My mother and her mother are now dead, and my
mother's two sisters only speak it among themselves,
when they don't want others to understand what they're
saying.

I would greatly appreciate any information you may be
able to send me. Unfortunately, the public libraries in
Atlanta have no resources at all, and never being
raised in the Jewish faith, I wasn't sure about
contacting the Jewish Community Center.

Subject: yid/id

There was a recent post by Mikhl Herzog about a rule
regarding words beginning with a vowel.  This was
offered as an explanation/clarification of the yid/id
question.  I don't have the original posting anymore.
Also, I didn't understand it the first time around.
Could Mikhl expand on it?  A dank.

Meylekh.
