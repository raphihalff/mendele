For di brik sheyne retish, iber di brik "mooie rammenas." On this side of
the bridge "sheyne retish" (beautiful radish[es]), over the bridge "mooie
rammenas." The peddlers who spoke Yiddish inside the Jewish quarter, had
to speak Yiddish on the other side of bridge called Bloubrik/Blauwbrug.
(Hartog Beem, _Jerosche_, 1970)

When we talk about German, Dutch, High German and Low German, we must
bear in mind that until this century the Dutch had no qualms about
calling their language Low German, "Nederduits" (as opposed to High
German, "Hoogduits"). The High and Low refer to geographical height, not
to the social status of the language.

There once was a time when Ashkenazic Jews were called "Hoogduitse Joden"
(High German Jews) and Yiddish "de Joodse Hoogduitse taal" (the High
German Jewish language). The Dutch recognized the close relation between
Yiddish and High German.

Politics, nationalism, and above all the cruel occupation by the Germans
during the Second World War, have led the Dutch to ignore or even deny
any close links between the Dutch and German culture and language.
Nowadays, the Dutch are often offended when their language is called
German (this is aggravated by some Germans who think that the "High"
implies superiority). In fact, although the dialects in the border area
are close, mutual comprehension between speakers of standard Dutch and
German would be rather limited if the Dutch didn't study German in
school. Personally, I have never met a German who understood Dutch
without having studied it or having lived in the Netherlands.

subject:  Galicia

Moyshe Baker separates the EE Galicia from Spanish Galicia and the Celts.
But his argument is unconvincing without _another_ etymon for the EE
toponym.  The Celts WERE all over Europe, so their presence in EE is in
itself surprising.  Where does the Slavic placename come from?  I can't
think of a good Slavic etymon.  There is, however, a Baltic toponym root
"gal-" which means "end", and presumably, like the Slavic root "kraj-",
is used in placenames for border regions of one sort or another.  But
this should show up in Slavic as "gol-" not "gal-".  So absent a better
analysis of the EE galicia, I'm not willing to exclude the celts.

Subject: Re: Oyve butl

My (American born) mother used the expression "ayve butl" in the context
"you're making me ayve butl", and meaning that I was driving her crazy.
I recall her telling me that "Eva Butl" was the name of an insane
character in a Yiddish play or story.  For some reason I also associate
"Eva Butl" with the similarly unlikely name "Moishe Kapoyreh".  Are these
defective memories on my part, or does anyone else know of these
expressions as character names?

Subject: Re: Oyve Butl

I am pretty certain that the  phrase in question is what is pronounced
in (Sefaradi) Hebrew Avar u'Batel  (actually u'Vatel) and can be found
in the Mishna Avot (Pirke Oves) or Wisdom of the Fathers at the end of
chapter 5, as an  indication of the state of someone  aged 100.  It is
used more or less  as one might use the term  "senile" in English.  In
Yiddish I  remember hearing  it pronounced as  over botel.   For those
familiar  sufficiently  with some  of  the  Israelis habit  of  mixing
languages, with English being a favourite,  I have recently heard in a
jocular way the expression "me'al  labaqbuq" for that "state" of mind.

Subject: Blondheim and Judeo-Romance

I am researching David Blondheim, a Romance philologist who taught at
Johns Hopkins in the 1940s.  His specialty was Judeo-Romance, a field
that, in a sense, he invented.  Unfortunately, I haven't found a
biography of any sort, and no one I have spoken with can recall his
name--even professors at Hopkins.

So, I was wondering if anyone one MENDELE has heard of Blondheim.  Please
e-mail me if you have information or can be of bibliographic help.

Subject: Yiddish Poetry

        I am gathering poems for a companion volume to my anthology,
_Blood to Remember: American Poets on the Holocaust_ (Texas Tech
University Press, 1991) and would welcome your assistance.  The new
anthology (about 200 pages so far), _Flames Ascending: World Poets on the
Holocaust_, will include poems on the Holocaust (Khurbn/ Shoah) written
by major world poets and also poems that have historical importance.
Poets will include Milosz, Greenberg, Sutzkever, Sachs, Celan, Radnoti,
Levi, and many others.  By "historical importance," I mean, for instance,
poems and songs composed in the camps and ghettos.

        I would be grateful for two kinds of help from members of this
list: 1) recommendations for poems/poets I should not fail to include 2)
assistance with translating significant poems in Yiddish that are
unavailable in English.

        Yiddish was spoken in my house only glancingly, as a vehicle for
talking "over the heads" of the children.  I participated in a seminar on
Yiddish at UMASS-Amherst in 1986 that was co-sponsored by the Yiddish
Book Center.  _Blood to Remember_ contains one poem that is in Yiddish
and English and other work that has been translated from Yiddish into
English.

        Thank you for any help you can offer.

Subject: "Kushik" - shopping bag ?!

In Czech and Slovak we use "koshik" as the word for "basket", but it is
usually used as well for a larger shopping bag (and even for "trash
bin"). Maybe it is influenced by the slavic use of the word?
