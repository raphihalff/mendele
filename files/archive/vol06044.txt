Subject: Horned water chestnuts (trapa natans L.)

Esteemed khevre,

I wonder if anyone can help me track down references in Yiddish to
horned water chestnuts . (Not the same vegetable we commonly call "water
chestnuts")   I think they may be called orzech wodny in Polish.  Other
English names are waternut, water caltrop and, you should excuse me,
Jesuit's nut. The scientific name is Trapa natans L.  According to
ethnobotanist Robert Pemberton, these nuts were used in by Jews in
Eastern Europe as a cheaper substitute for walnuts in some sweets.

I would be very interested to learn any Yiddish names and Jewish uses
for this nut.  Many thanks,

Eve Jochnowitz

Subject: Groyzam, daytshmerish, Weinreich

I have a particular and a general question.  I happened on Tishebov to
be reading Yehoash's Yiddish translation of Lamentations, and came
across the word "groyzam."  I thought, this must be related to German
"grausam," cruel etc., but thought I should look it up just to make
sure. Weinreich gives the word, but doesn't define it, marks it with the
symbol that means "inacceptable in the standard language," and refers
the reader to entries on other words, e.g., akhzoryesdik.  Well, okay, I
thought - it's just one incidence, and in the very special context of a
Yiddish Bible translation. But then, a day or so afterwards, I was
reading Ruven Ayzland's essay about Anna Margolin, and I came across the
word again, used in a secular context ( Ayzland is saying that Margolin
felt in some of her troubles that she was being punished "far dem, vos
zi hot in ire yung-meydlshe yorn azoy groyzam zikh geshpilt mit [a
friend named] Avrashn").  So then I began to wonder what was going on.

The particular question I have is, is there something about the word
"groyzam" that makes it get used by a good writer - in my judgment, at
any rate - in this way, despite Weinreich's classification?

And the general question is, what do people feel about Weinreich's
judgments of the admissibility and inadmissibility of words into "the
standard language," especially words like this that presumably are held
unacceptable because they seem daytshmerish?  When I read Ayzland, I
feel that I'm reading a writer whose diction is _in general_ more
daytshmerish than Weinreich's dictionary sanctions.  But surely our
sense of what belongs in the language should be determined by the actual
usage of good writers who use it, no?

A sheynem dank,

Larry Rosenwald

Subject: Dos talisl

Bernard Katz asked about lyrics to a song identified by Nina Warnke as
"Dos Talisl."  Until someone can provide more complete details, here's
what I know.

I've got an LP (vintage late 1950s - early 1960s?) called "Songs my
mother sang to me" by the Malavsky Family Choir, issued under Tikva
Records (record T-2?).  The version is short and lachrymose -- not
surprisingly, given the theme -- and includes a spoken monologue
presumably written by the Malavskys.  The LP credits the song to one "H.
Wohl."  I believe I've seen a longer version in sheet music somewhere,
but I don't own it.  It may be melodramatic, but I like the rendition.

Here are the lyrics I can make out:

Dos talisl is dokh di eyntsike treyst
Far di yid in zayn freyd in zayn leyd (?).
Fun zayn geburtstog biz in keyver, geyt es mit im mit.
Zayn leybn vert geyogt,
?? trogt,
Ales vos er farmogt
Nemt men tsi fun im.
Ales, ales nor dem talis nemt men mit.

Subject: _tOles_

Bob Rothstein asks [6.041] "whence _toles_?"

Certainly _not_ from Pinsk!

In such cases, it's best to turn to "habokher hazetser" who may have
taken it upon himself to "improve" on the text. (Not an unusual
occurrence in the world of Yiddish letters. Perhaps he was from Podolye?

There are other indication in the text that a non-Pinsker got into the
act: the rhyme  _reyn_ and _geven_, for example.  Only a Southerner would
do that.  Perhaps the same is true of the non-rhyming hypercorrection
_gloybikayt--eybikayt_. The correct form would be _gleybikay-eybikayt_.
