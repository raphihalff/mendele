Subject: Elie Wiesel on The Yiddish Voice

The Yiddish Voice will feature an interview with Nobel Prize winner and
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel on its Wednesday, June 27, 2001
broadcast on WUNR 1600 AM at 7:30 p.m. Wiesel discusses the Holocaust
Survivors Memoirs Project of the World Jewish Congress.

Random House has pledged $1 million to the Holocaust Survivors' Memoirs
Project set up by the World Jewish Congress to find and publish the
written accounts of those who suffered under the Nazis during World War
II. Elie Wiesel, the author of ''Night,'' a memoir of Auschwitz, among
many other works, will serve as honorary chairman of the project.

The Yiddish Voice is a weekly Yiddish-language radio program heard in

Subject: Wax cylinder recordings from the An-ski expedition

Re Mechel Zlotowski's post about field recordings from the An-ski
ethnographic expedition, two CDs have been released to date:
"Treasure of Jewish Culture in Ukraine" (Kiev:  Institute for
Information Recording;  Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine, 1997),
and "Materials of J. Engel Ethnographic Expedition 1912 (The Historic
Collection of Jewish Music 1912-1947, vol. 1) (Kiev:  National Academy
of Sciences of Ukraine;  Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine;
Institute for Information Recording, 2001).  Both CDs reproduce
recordings that were originally made on wax cylinders.  I am not sure
how they are being distributed; I received copies through private
channels, from individuals who are associated with the project that is
responsible for transferring the recordings from wax cylinder to CD.

That project is spearheaded by the Vernadsky National Library of
Ukraine (Kiev), where the wax cylinders are housed -- and not by the
University of Ukraine (i.e., Kiev University?).  The Vernadsky
Library's Jewish Section -- which is headed by Irina Sergeeva (its
music librarian is Lyudmila Sholokhova) -- is where much of the extant
An-ski-expedition materials are located.  The field recordings were
transferred there from Leningrad circa 1929 or 1930, and were
incorporated into the collections of the Institute for Jewish
Proletarian Culture, headed by Y. Liberberg.  They were augmented by
additional field recordings made by the Soviet Jewish
ethnomusicologist, Moisei (Moyshe) Beregovski, which are now also in
the Vernadsky Library.  At the beginning of World War II these
materials were among archival collections that were evacuated by the
Soviets to the Urals, and they were returned to Kiev after the war.
The wax cylinders were not so much "forgotten" (and if they were indeed
forgotten, it was in Kiev and not in Leningrad/St. Petersburg) as they
were victims of official Soviet policies regarding the "Jewish
question."  They came to light during the mid-1990s, as the Jewish
Section of the Vernadsky Library gathered collections that had been
dispersed (or hidden) around Kiev.

Subject: Rajzel Zychlinski

In response to Victoria Lunzer-Talos: I recently published a book of
translations of a selection of Rajzel Zychlinski's poems (that's how
she herself spells her name), under the title "God Hid His Face." I
think she is one of the great Yiddish poets, and not as well known as
she should be.  To the best of my knowledge, she is still living (at
age 91) in California.

Hello all,

I am looking for a listing of English translations of I. Manger's works

Thanks

While I can't reply to Larry Rosenwald's query (v. 11.005) about a
possible translation by Joe Dorian of Itsik Manger's "megile lider," I
can advise him and all participants in Mendele that I have translated
that work and that "Yiddishkayt L.A." published (a photocopied)
bilingual edition (English and Yiddish, not transcribed). More
information can be obtained by e-mail at <yiddishkaytla@earthlink.net>.

Karlovy Vary).

Subject: Katzenelson's poem in Dutch

About Katzenelson's poem" Dos lid funem oysgehergetn Yiddishen folk".
Just to complete the list [11.005:4-Moderator's note], it was also
translated into Dutch by Willy Brill under the title "Lied van het
vermoorde Joodse Volk", published by Element Uitgevers, Naarden, in
1996.

Subject: Two Queries:  Mirele Efros and Sholem Aleichem

I am seeking information on two subjects.  Any help that Mendelyaners can
provide will be much appreciated.

First, was Jakob Gordin's great drama, Mirele Efros, ever translated into
English?  If so, does anyone know where I could find the translation?  This
is for a project that may eventually lead to an English-language production
of the play, and an English translation is a necessary first step.

Second, I am seeking for our Yiddish leyenkrayz here in Washington, D.C.,
USA, an edition of Sholem Aleichem's Funem Yarid (his memoirs) or his
Stories for Jewish Children in modern Yiddish orthography.  Does an edition
of either of these works exist and, if so, where can I find it?

Thanks very much for any help.

Jim Feldman
