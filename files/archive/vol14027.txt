Subject: Re: Gender of yortsayt

Der yortsayt.

Some examples of transformations from feminine (or neuter) base words to more
specific masculine forms in written Yiddish are:

di tsayt, der yortsayt, der moltsayt

di/dos shtik, der frishtik

dos bukh, dos/der verterbukh

dos yor, der nay-yor, der shvartz-yor

dos vort, der entfer ('antvort')

These transformations do not occur in German, though all the words I listed
above are of Germanic origin. These transformations do occur in many varities
of Yiddish. The change to masculine gender suggests a more specific variety
than the base noun, though it does not occur consistently. This is somewhat
along the lines of what happens in spoken eastern Yiddish with collective vs.
specific nouns, though this is not often seen in literary Yiddish. (i.e. di
esn vs. der esn, food in general vs. a specific kind of food.)

The problem of Yiddish speakers from different areas is a very old one. And
each one who is using words from the surrounding nonYiddish language acts as
if  he/she is speaking Yiddish and the other is not.

Subject: Re: Non-idealized Yiddish

Lyubov Dukker posting in 14.026 on "non-idealized Yiddish" does nothing to
support Ewa Geller's article, and much to refute it (unwittingly). It should
be noted that her primary example, the colorful dialogue between her
mother-in-law and a "neighbor," occurs not between a student of the Yiddish
language and a native informant--the crux of Geller's polemic--but rather
between two _native speakers_ of Yiddish! By the same token, one could take
any number of examples of two native speakers of English--one from the U.S.
and the other from, say, Jamaica, Ireland, Nigeria, India, etc--and point to
similar misunderstandings and instances of mutual incomprehension. Would
anyone extrapolate from such examples that the speakers are speaking different
languages? That there is no point in such speakers attempting to communicate?
That there is no hope for the student of this language called, imprecisely and
anachronistically, English to master the language and its various dialects?
That there is no point in linguists trying to posit a standard
grammar/vocabulary/standard of usage in spite of the proliferation of dialects
and ideolects? For what it's worth, my wife Brukhe is from England and I'm
from Louisiana. dankn got hobn mir yidish tsu redn vayl a'nisht voltn mir zikh

Subject: Khavele tsum get

Does any one know the story of "Khavele tsum get" ?  If so, who wrote
it, and when and where can I find it?

My mother used to tell it and I can't remember whether it was just about
someone in her shtetl, or actually a piece of literature.

With thanks for your help!

Just guessing. zhote could be zholte, the Slavic equivalent of gele 'yellow',
but here possibly 'sallow' or 'redhead'.

Subject: taytsh Khumash

I recently acquired a 5 volume taytsh khumash. I am curious about the Yiddish
orthography and specifically its history and possible explanations for its
peculiar style.  First let me describe a typical page, as I think it may have
some bearing on its intended audience.

The largest typeface is for the Hebrew.  Next to it is ONKELOS (Aramaic).

Below that are multiple small sections that vary from page to page; some only
appear on a few pages. I will try to approximate the headings for the most
common sections, but I am unfamiliar with the names and I apologize for what I
do to them (especially P/F, T/S and vowels):

Rashi
Square Hebrew font for quoted text, followed by Rashi Script commentary

SHFSI KHOKHMIM, BAL HTURIM, ENINI KHTA ADM VKHU
all in Rashi Script

The bottom of the page contains 2-4 Yiddish sections, all in square font:

FIRISH LSOROS ELHIM (largest font), SFR HISHR, FRKI DRBI ELIEZR, FRUSH E"T,
LKUTIM AL HATORAH

Although clearly Yiddish, these have a distinctively Hebrew look and
spelling:
--They have a large number of vowel markings.
--The vowel markings are redundant, e.g. yud AND a khirek (under the
preceding consonant)
--They include vowels never used in Yiddish (3-dot segol, 2-dot tseyrekh)

EXAMPLE
geven:
       giml (with khirek), yud, tsvey vovn (with segol), ayen, nun
(in fact, past participles always begins with 'gi' instead of 'ge')

Incidentally, this is similar to the Yiddish in a copy of Tsene Rene I have
(although not identical--past participles are 'ge'). That edition also has
some commentaries below Ashkenazi's text (including SFR HISHR).

Questions:
--Does anyone know the history of this kind of writing?
--For whom was this type of book written? It's complexity and detail makes
it unlikely to be aimed at women or less educated men.  Did learned men
read such commentaries in Yiddish (just as they would have listened to
divrey toyra or homilies in Yiddish)?
--Finally, what was the purpose of the elaborate Hebraization?

a sheynem dank,

Yoyne Freer
