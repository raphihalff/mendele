Subject: Teaching Yiddish

I only remember my own experience in the Arbeter Ring Shule in Detroit in
the late 40s and early 50s.  The curriculum was almost the same as it had
been for my mother, and all instruction was in Yiddish.  I learned very
little other than the alphabet and the songs.  I guess mine was the first
generation where Yiddish was not the language of the home, and I just
didn't understand it well enough--and still don't.  In fifth grade we
began to learn Hebrew also, and that was taught from a standard language
text, so I could handle it better.  Yiddish we were supposed to know just
by osmosis, I guess--no teaching of language structure, etc.  I didn't
understand any- thing about nouns, verbs, participles etc. until the
Hebrew text and then when I took Latin in High School, and didn't
understand Yiddish's until I took German in college.

My point is that it has to be taught as a foreign language, because it is.

Subject: School song to melody of the Internationale

In the Dovid Pinsky Folk Schule in Brighton Beach, which I attended in
the 1930's, the school song had the melody of  The Internationale, but
the following opening line:

       Mir zaynen kinder ale glaykher

Does anyone know the remaining lines?

Subject: A sentence of Sholem Aleikhem's

In my intermediate Yiddish class, we encountered a sentence in a Sholem
Aleikhem story that I could not explain.  Since the term is over and two
of my three students read Mendele, we agreed that I would ask for help
from the chevre here.

The story is "Vos vet zayn fun mir?", one of the Motl Peysi dem Khazns
series.  Motl is discussing different concepts of Gan Eydn, in
preparation for the story of how he got caught stealing fruit from his
neighbor's garden when he was supposed to be saying Kaddish for his
father.  The fourth paragraph of the story reads as follows:

	Kumt tsu geyn a yid an aynbinder un tut a zog, az der emeser
	gan-eydn iz gor fraytik in bod.  ikh hob es aleyn gehert fun
	moyshe dem aynbinder, ikh zol azoy hern al dos guts!  Haynt
	geyt dergeyt an ek!

Question: what is the meaning of the last sentence: haynt geyt dergeyt
an ek?

B'sholem,

Arnie Kuzmack

Subject: Yiddish speakers wanted

I'm looking for people speaking yiddish as their mother tongue and who
would agreed to be interviewed about their use of this language. I'm
doing a study about yiddish for my university.

Subject: Af tselokhes vs dafka

It has been my impression that both oyf tselokhes and dafka have been in
Yiddish ever since I can remember (i.e. 1930's).  More over, it has always
seemed to me that both expressions have the same full range of meanings;
that is , from "for spite" to "just my luck". The only difference I sensed
was purely the region from where the speakers' dialect stemmed. I seemed
to sense dafka more common among speakers from Lodz region and points
north and west, while oyf tselokhes seemed more prevalent in Belarus and
Ukraine. I don't recall ever hearing the same person using both
expressions even in different contexts. It is true however that I don't
seem to find dafka in my turn-of-the-century edition of Harkavy.

Mikhl Herzog to the rescue, please!

Subject: Af tselokhes (the end?)

A dank  to all the  many Mendelniks who  replied to my  "af tselokhes"
query, some  in private and  some in  Mendele.  Harry Katz  in Mendele
Vol. 5.041 added to his reply that  he had thought that the phrase was
connected to laughing  (lakhen).  I, who am more at  home with Hebrew,
could not understand what the meaning had to do with "plates" that are
called in  Hebrew Tsalahot (tsadi  lamed het  vav tav) and  could have
been pronounced in Yiddish tsalokhes...

Well, imagination is something wonderful.

Subject: Fun shames a bakoshe

Dear friends: owing no doubt to the narrow constricted world-view
(Yude-Leyb Proger iz mayn eydes) of the elementary school teachers who
taught us English more than 60 years ago I have developed in recent
months a positive allergy to the way, thanks to the sloth-generating
properties of e-mail software, direct quotes have replaced the simple
summarizing phrase.  Not just direct quotes, but lengthy rambling direct
quotes that Mendele's readers will have already read.  There have even
been _nested_ quotes submitted to Mendele.

No need to bore you with a sermon.  I'll simply urge that direct quotes
be used _only_ when the exact wording of a phrase or sentence is critical
to the discussion. Even in such a case the direct quote should be
limited.  That's the way our literary and scholarly models have
communicated for ages.

If for no other reason, maybe you could just do it as a favor for the
shames?
