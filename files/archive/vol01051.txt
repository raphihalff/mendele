EP: excuse me, tayerer shames, but i DID answer. and
you published it. my answer was: 

BROUHAHA.

it's of course from french, where it's claimed to be
from borekhhabe (just listen to those noisy jews greet-
ing their guests...).

if you had something else in mind, what was it?

NM: The shames's face is red.  Of course you did and I
published it.  But my brain isn't always on duty. 
Here's what happened: since I knew the answer (not
because I KNEW but because Mikhl inadvertently told
me), I somehow treated 'brouhaha' as if it
were the _question_.  Ay, ven me vert elter, toyg es in
gantsn nisht.

However, while I'm up, the etymology just may be more
interesting. The Petit Robert says, like you, probably
onomatopoeic (though without specifying whose noises
are being mimicked).  Recent U.S. dictionaries (with
the exception of the latest Random House which retreats
from the Unabridged, 2nd ed.) say something like this
(here's the New World 3rd): "in medieval theater, cry
of devil disguised as clergy; said to be < Heb...
formula used by Levites to welcome to the Temple".  How
you like them apples? Life must have been particularly
jolly in medieval Yurp.

1. yidtype.c.

If you compile the program using a C compiler, you will
have some software that will turn input looking like

     a SAneM dank

into output looking like


 ___ _  _ _ ____    ____  _ _ _  _ _  _ _ _    _ _  , / 
| ,\|    |    |  |  | |  |  | | | | |    ,\|  |/  _|
|_\    |    |__| _|/  _|      |/_/     |_\  |

If you also have the 'sed' program available, then
using recast.sed will let you type in the more legible

    a sheynem dank
and get the same result.

If you don't have C available, the program is useless.


2.  Borukh-habe.  Might be the origin of 'brouhaha',
but it is in doubt. I expect that 'copacetic' really
does come from 'kol beseder', however.

3.  Shrage-fayvel.  The fact that the two are combined
implies to me that they are synonymous.  I trust the
Phoebus version.  I dimly recollect that Phoebus and
Apollo were not always the same.  Even if Shrage is a
relexification (what a great word!) for Uri, it still
means light.
