Subject: A brief announcement

As most of you know, Mendele is being edited from a distance:
since I live in Brookline, I use a local computer in order to
log onto the one at Trinity.  This makes things a lot slower.
I've therefore asked subscribers to remember to sign their posts
(almost all do) and to provide a suitable subject line (most do).

Hitherto I've gone to the trouble of writing subscribers for the
missing line.  No longer.  Starting with the next issue of Mendele,
if you find your post missing it's because it's been deleted for
lack of a subject line.

Finally, there are a handful of subscribers whose home computers
for one reason or another make it impossible for them to "reply"
to a post.  I've explained this repeatedly and have offered a very
simple remedy.  Their posts, which now wind up in my error box, will
from now on be deleted as well.

Edward Portnoy <ep73@columbia.edu> shraybt (Mendele Vol. 3.107):

Sha"s is roshey-teyves (abbreviation) for :shisho sedorim: in
loshn-koydesh. It referred originally to the six 'orders' into which
the 63 mesekhtes (volumes) of the mishne are divided but
subsequently came to be the preferred alternative for the Talmud.
(The latter term would appear, on the basis of some evidence I have
seen, to have been excised by the censors - but it is not clear to
me why.)

Subject: Shas

	Edward Portnoy asks in mendele 3.107 about the abbreviation
'sha"s,' meaning the Talmud.  It means 'shisha sidarim,' the six
orders of the Mishna, the underlying structure of the Talmud.

	When in doubt on something like this, a good first approach
is a Hebrew dictionary.

Subject: Regarding yontif

Like Bob Werman, yontif was the way I always heard it and pronounced
it. From whence I assume came the "joke" (told me by a Chicagoan
years ago) about what Cohen said to the Pope at Pesach: "Gut yontif
Pontif."

Subject: Shmontses

If "shmontses" is, indeed, related to "shmuesn", it's another
instance of the nasalization of "ayin".

Subject: on 'mazal tov' for "good luck"

the old berlitz-series hebrew was apparently churned out like other
languages in the series, the book being entirely written,
apparently, except for the specific language to be filled in,
sentence by sentence, including the introduction:  it wished the new
learner "mazal tov" as he/she was about to move to the first lesson
-- immediately explaining, however, that "mazal tov" does NOT mean
"good luck".
