Subject: "Lehavdil" Turkish?

Lehavdil from Yiddish and Turkish, the word "lehavdil"
is first rate Hebrew.

Was this a typo for Halva?  Or Halkum?  These are more
likely to be Turkish, Mikhl.

Subject: Response to Zachary Baker 4/20/93

     Truth be told, I haven't followed the current
"Bruhaha" in the Forward about "Klal-takones fun
yidishn oysleyg". We carry the book in the Jewish Book
Center and it hasn't exactly flown off the shelves. I
feel that any number of organizations can declare
orthographical standards. What is more important is if
people actually follow them. We have an ongoing
argument with the setzers of the Forwards. We give them
an ad in Yiddish. We spell "Yiddish" with two yuds.
They, being religious and following the "Williamsburg"
standard will typically spell it with an alef and a
yud. This is just an example. If you ever pick up some
of the more religious  Yiddish newspapers such as "Der
Yid", you will find that to a certain extent, they
totally ignore the Yivo standard.

     Unless the people that use Yiddish in the home,
the street and at work adopt the standard, it becomes
the province of institutions, professors and their
students. It could be that my experience has been
limited. I would be interested in hearing other
examples or points of view.

P.S. The above is not to be taken to mean that I don't
believe there should be a standard. I'm simply
wondering out loud about who should set the standard.

Subject: Mendele in Costa Rica

My name is Leo Goldstein, and I am 20 years old.
I am studing economics at the Costa Rica Univer-
sity,and I can understand Yiddish better than
speak it.  My knowledge of this language in this
part of the world, is thanks to my grandparents,
because since a little boy the spoke to me in
Yiddish, and until this day, baruch Hashem, I have
them to learn more of it.

So now, MENDELE is present in Costa Rica (CR).
