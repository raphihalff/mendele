Subject: Hebrew Gender/Yiddish Gender

Further to the thread on the gender of 'emes', here are a couple more that have
puzzled me:

Hebrew plural / Yiddish plural
shabatot      /  shabosim
talitot       /  taleysim

Tangentially, why is it that the plural of 'doktor' should be 'doktoyrim'?  Is
it because the word connotes a higher education, as knowledge of Hebrew does?  I
can't think of a less convoluted explanation.

Subject: The retort too late

More, although certainly not the final word, on "the retort too late."
In Saul Bellow's novel Herzog, the main character states: ". . . in the
Yiddish of his long-dead mother, trepverter - words that came too late,
when you were already on your way down the stairs."

Subject: Mentsh

Louis Fridhandler writes concerning the word "mentsh":

> (Only Yiddish has such a word.)

The word "Mentsch" in German has much the same meaning. When a priest in
Mozart's "Magic Flute" says of Tamino: "Er ist ein Prinz," Zarastro
replies: "Mehr, er ist ein Mensch."

Subject: Syntax question (wh-infinitives)

Rex Sprouse (rsprouse@indiana.edu) asks (Vol 4.293, item 2) about the
permissibility in Yiddish of constructions like:

	Ikh veys nit, vemen tsu fregn
	Derklert mir, vi tsu shpiln in dreydl
	Ikh freg zikh, vos tsu leyenen

This sounds fine to me, but I'm not a native speaker.  However, if song
lyrics can be considered valid evidence of native-speaker intuition, I'd
like to submit as an example the line from "Tumbalalaika" that reads:

	... vemen tsu nemen, im nit farshemen.

Subject: Mendele who-is-who

Dear Mendelniks,

the who-is-who for Mendele, which has been available per ftp for a while,
can now also be accessed via email.  This way you don't have to fiddle
with ftp.  Also, you can selectively retrieve introductions from people
you are interested in whithout having to download the whole file.
Details on how to do this are included below.

I apologize for another entirely technical posting.

----------------------------------------------
Shtadlen is a service for mendele subscribers.  To use it, you send
email to shtadlen@w172zrz.zrz.TU-Berlin.DE.  A reply is automatically
mailed back to you.

There are currently two items you can request:

- This help file (which may change over time)
- Access to the Mendele who-is-who database

You specify the service you want in the subject of your mail by saying
either of

request help
request who-is-who

If the subject doesn't begin with "request" (or "Re: request") your mail
will be ignored.

If you request help, a message body is not required, but doesn't hurt.
However, it will probably never be seen by a human reader, since
shtadlen handles mail automatically.

If you request who-is-who, the message body may or may not be left blank.
If it is empty, you will be sent a list of all the names for which an
introductory article currently is available (a table of contents).
Otherwise, each line should contain the full name of a Mendele subscriber.
You will then receive the introductions (if available) for each of these.
A name may optionally be preceded by a number and a closing paranthesis,
which will be ignored.  The names you get with the table of contens come
in this format, and you can use them the way they come.

Questions, suggestions etc. concerning this service should not be
sent to shtadlen, but to siegel@zrz.TU-Berlin.DE instead.  Suggestions
on how to make this help file clearer and more readable are especially
welcome.

Subject: A tchaynik hakn

Dana Keren has been kind enough to provide a question which even I can
answer: "hak mir nisht ka (= kayn) tchaynik means - literallly - bang me
no teakettle, aand is a  way of telling someone to stop talking at me or
nagging me about something. "vos hakstu mir a tchaynik?"
