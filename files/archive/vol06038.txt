Subject: Ikh zukh a lid

I am interested in obtaining the title - and possibly the lyrics - to a
song that contains the line: "ober/bloys dem talis nemt er mit".  Yes,
it is pretty thin to go on, but the line is quite distinctive.  Dos lid
redt fun a man vos ven er shtarbt, mus ales iberlozn - nor zayn talis -
vos geyt mit eym in kever.  And I trust our wonderful Mendelyaner
hundert pertsent!  A shaynem dank,

Subject: Luftmentsh

Does anyone know of early literary uses of the word _luftmentsh_? Is it
possibly a calque of a Slavic word? As far as i can tell, there is no
model for it in German?

Subject: Soviet Yiddish writers memorial

On Sunday, August 11th at 2 pm, a memorial to dozens of Soviet Yiddish
writers executed in 1952 will take place at the Workmen's Circle Center
in Los Angeles. The martyrdom of these cultural leaders marked a low
point in dictator Joseph Stalin's rigime. Liquidated on trumped-up
charges such as "Zionism," "cosmopolitanism," and "anti-Soviet
activity," the writers were among Stalin's last victims before his death
in 1953.

The Memorial to Soviet Yiddish Writers is sponsored by the Workmen's
Circle, the Los Angeles Yiddish Culture Club and the Jewish Labor
Committee. Much as world Jewry's attention has focused on the Holocaust
and World War II, the sponsors believe that victims of Soviet
totalitarianism should not be forgotten. Coming only seven years after
the end of the war, the murder of leading Jewish poets and intellectuals
in the Soviet Union was an attempt to destroy Jewish culture in a
country with the second-largest Jewish population in the world. It was
consistent with Stalin's Great Russian chauvinism and attacks on other
ethnic groups in the U.S.S.R.

The memorial will feature poetry by Peretz Markish, Leib Kvitko, Moishe
Kulbak, David Hofshteyn, Aaron Kushnyerov and Shimon Halkin, recited in
the original Yiddish and in English translation. The program also
includes songs created from their lyrics, performed by Lomir Ale Zingen,
the Workmen's Circle chorus, conducted by Malke Shaw. Pianist Helen
Bussell will perform a selection of classical works.

The meeting will take place at the Workmen's Circle Center at 1525 S.
Robertson Blvd. in Los Angeles. The public is invited, and admission is
free. Light refreshments will be served at the conclusion of the
program.

For further information, please call 310 552-2007.

Subject: Opposition to Yiddish

Sylvia Schildt's implicit proposition that those who actively oppose
Yiddishism are partners of anti-Semites (6.035, 3) is quite reasonable.
Those who oppose Yiddishism may not _intend_ to be partners, but are
nonetheless.

I cannot understand the proposition that the revival of Hebrew required
suppression of Yiddish.  It must be wrong according to evidence.
Evidence: Jews have been bilingual, even polylingual for millenia.
Sholem-Aleykhem said that Yiddish and Hebrew coexist within him at
peace. _Zey raysn zikh nisht, eyns dos andere._ Further, Yiddish
speakers from Eastern Europe were major participants in the revival of
Hebrew.  They did not have to suppress mame-loshn.  By the mid-twenties
Hebrew was spoken in homes, shops and streets in _Palestine_ by
immigrants from Eastern Europe.  A welcome miracle.

Some Jews aver that the philosophy (attitude, policy) is this: that the
language of galut does not deserve continuation.  What illogical,
nonsensical, self-destructive rubbish!  In Yiddish wonderful creations
were fashioned despite afflictions by anti-Semites.  If any language
should be shunned, perhaps it is the language in which Mein Kampf was
written, in which the plan to murder all Jews was written and spoken,
the language in which the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was written,
in which newspapers inciting pogroms was written.  That would carry a
modicum of logic, but it would also be senseless. It is clearly
destructive to try to shun German or Russian or (for that matter) Henry
Ford's or Father Coughlin's or Pat Buchanan's English.

Shunning Yiddish has led to weakened, often broken connection with
Jewish cultural treasures which Jews (and everybody else) need.  One
result is that children in America (possibly Israel) are usually left
with vast gaps in knowledge of Jewish history, vast, mysterious gaps
that teachers generally don't attempt to fill.

The Israeli official and unofficial attitude toward Yiddish (which many
Jews share) deserves no respect because 1) it makes no sense, and 2) it
has sabotaged connection with Jewish cultural treasures.  It's time to
repair that once and for all!  Tsurik tsu der arbet!

Do you know where I can get a computer program that teaches Yiddish?
