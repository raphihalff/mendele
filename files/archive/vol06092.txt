Subject: Nahum Stutchkoff

I was wondering if anyone was aware of any biographical materials on
Nukhem Stutchkoff. Does he have any descendants? I find it odd that the
life of so prolific and influential a lexicographer, writer and
dramatist should be so difficult to document. A sheynem dank,

Subject: Nokhem Sternheim

I have been teaching my 5th-grade Sunday-school (Jewish, of course)
class Nokhem Sternheim's "undzer nigndl," which my students are quite
taken with. Can anyone tell me more about Sternheim's life and songs,
and/or point me toward more information?  Is there a published
collection of his songs anywhere out there?

A sheynem dank aykh.

Subject: "First name" af yidish

Several months ago I published here (6.073,7) a short post on the
subject of how to say "maiden name" in Yiddish.

My subject today is:  How do you say _first name_ in Yiddish?

The answer is:  _rufnomen_ (plural: rufnemen).

To the question, depending on whether you "dutst" or you "irtst" the
person: "Vi _ruft_ men dir /aykh/?"  or "Vi heystu /vi heyst ir/?" [What
is your first name?], the answer is:  "Mayn rufnomen iz... [my first
name is...].

There are _formal_ rufnemen, the name a child is given at birth, and
_informal_ rufnemen, the name(s) by which one is addressed at home, by
friends, acquaintances, and, generally, in secular life.

Informal _rufnemen_ often present interesting changes, such as clipped,
shorter forms, differences in pronunciation, an occasional shift in the
syllabic stress, diminutions, augmentations, or forms of endearment, for
example (some of the names quoted below are from Mordkhe Shaechter's
_Yiddish Tsvey_, p.  271):

Srol, Srolikl (from Yisroel), Avrom, Avremele, Avremtshik (from
Avrohom), Yo'me (from Binyomin), Itsik, itsikl  (from Yitskhok), Sender
(from Aleksander), Yoske, Yosl (from Yoysef), Motke, Motl (from
Mordekhay), Lyokem (from Elyokum), Ki've (from Akive), Zalmenke, Zemele
(from Zalmen);  Leyke, Leyele (from Le'a), Sime, Simke (from Simkhe),
Serke, Sorele (from Sa'ra), Mirke, Mirele (from Miryom), Rive, Rivele,
Rivtshe (from Rivke), and so one.

This list, of course, is not a comprehensive one, and there are many
more male and female informal _rufnemen_ to be added.

Note that all the _formal_ rufnemen (in parentheses above) are of Hebrew
origin, while the various changes they underwent in their transition to
become _informal_ rufnemen are the names in Yiddish.
