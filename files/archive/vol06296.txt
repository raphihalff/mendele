Subject: Don't forget Camp Hemshekh!

In connection with Hershl Hartman's listing [6.293] of 4
Yiddish-speaking children's summer camps (Kinderland, Kinder-Ring,
Kindervelt and Boyberik) I would be remiss if I didn't write in to
mention another one (alas, no longer in existence) -- Hemshekh,
sponsored by the Bund. Although my sister and I both attended
Workmen's Circle elementary and high schools in New York, our
connection with Hemshekh was closer than with the Workmen's Circle's
own Kinder-Ring.  A reunion of Hemshekh-ists was held several years
ago, and although I was unable to attend, my sister reported that
those who did attended still had the spirit of "Khavershaft".... and a
(not too) surprisingly high number of them had made careers in the
helping professions.

Subject: The English _Forward_ maims Yiddish

Forget correct romanization of Yiddish words in the English _Forward_.
For instance, its heading design over the section of personal
announcements reads "Meet a Meydl, Meet a mensch" (German spelling),
instead of _mentsh_, the correct Yiddish pronunciation.

I am certain that the woman who advertised herself (in a recent issue
of the _Forward_) as "keeping a kosher home infused with yidishkayt"
would rather marry a "mentsh," with all the ramifications that this
Yiddish word implies. Similarly, several other women who referred in
their Personals to old-fashioned yidishkayt values.

Now, in its issue of May 2nd, 1997, p. 15, the _Forward_ carried the
following heading:  "Bubbe and Zayde Can Ride The Rapids to A Real
Connection With The Kinderle [sic].  It is about the new trend in
intergenerational camps for grand- children and grandparents.

Of course, spelling "Bobe " un "Zeyde" would have been more in
accordance with accepted romanized spelling.  But "kinderle"?

The maimed "kinderle," without the final khof [the lange-khof]  was
also found in the text proper, not just in the heading, and supposedly
was meant for the plural _kinderleKH_.

I would not hesitate to call it "decapitate," since to a word it does
not matter whether there is deliberate cut-off of an initial letter or
a last letter. .

Can you imagine, even if only for a mili-second, how Bialik's famous
and charming song, originally written in Yiddish, "Unter the grininine
beymelekh" ['under the green-green small trees],  about Jewish
children would look, not to mention how it would sound,  without the
missing pluralizing lange-khofs?

"Unter di grininke beymele--
shpiln zikh Meyshele--, shleymele--,
tsitses, kapotkele--, peyele--,
----------------------------
nor eyn zakh farmogn zey eygele--" ...

But never mind!

The English _Forward_ is edited and published in the very same
building where the Yiddish _Forverts_. is edited and published.

This means that if the people in charge of the English _Forward_ truly
cared, they have a ready access to checking the spelling and
romanization of Yiddish words.

If they only cared!

Subject: Bashert

I'm interested in the entymology of "bashert" (fate). I have also seen
it spelled "beshert," and my wife's bubbe pronounces it "bashect."
Thank you.

Subject: Forming diminutives

Zellig Bach in Mendele Vol. 6.295 asks about the reason for dropping
the first syllables many diminutive name forms.  The simplest
explanation that comes to mind is that this represents typical
mother-to-child ga-ga goo-goo baby talk.

Subject: Yidisher khreyn iz umatum biter*

A friend who works in the Israeli Foreign Service told me this story
and asked that I keep it secret.  Dear Mendelists, if you pass the
story on to your friends, please ask them to keep it secret, too -- in
this world one can never be too careful (oznaim lakoysel - di vent
hobn oyern).

It seems that shortly before Passover leaders of the Spanish Jewish
community learned that due to agricultural import restrictions and
controlled agricultural policies there was practically no _chazeres_
(_morer_, horse-radish) in all of Spain.  This information was relayed
to the Israeli Embassy in Madrid, which wired the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs in Jerusalem, which quickly contacted the Ministry of
Agriculture, which mobilized a planeload of _chazeres_ (horse-radish)
almost overnight and flew it to Spain.

On arriving in Spain the shipment was immediately quarantined in
keeping with Spanish protective policies against natural (not to
mention unnatural) pests.  The day before Passover the Spanish Jews,
feeling a profound compulsion to celebrate the holiday kedin vekedas
(vos farlangt nemen a kazis morer, es ayntunkn in khroyses un makhn di
brokhe af achilas-morer), telegrammed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
in Jerusalem to ask where is the _chazeres_.

Fully cognizant of developments on the ground in the Iberian capital,
the Ministry Communications Officer (who unfortunately happened to be
an Ashkenazi, a condition which has been remedied by now) wired the
Spanish Chief Rabbi (my informant saw the telegram!):  "The khreyn in
Spain is mainly on the plane!"

* A well known parody on the expression "Yidishe kheyn iz umatum sheyn"
(see Bernshteyn 1586:4).
