Subject: Yiddish Voice Talk Radio/Boston Hebrew College/1995 Haskura

A quick announcement for Boston area Yiddish radio listeners, and
interested others.

Recent events have moved us to rather hurriedly put together a rather
exciting event: the first all-Yiddish talk radio show in
we-don't-know-how-long.  (Ever?  Can Yiddish radio historian Henry
Saposnik or anyone else fill us in?)

Details: Wednesday, March 29, 1995, 7:30 - 8:30 p.m.
The Yiddish Voice, WUNR 1600 AM, Boston

The subjects relate to what many perceive as the de-Yiddishization and
de-Urbanization of the Boston Yiddish community.  Questions we're asking:
Should Hebrew College move to Newton?  (They've announced that they
will.) Should there be a Yiddish Speaker at the 1995 Haskura (Annual
Holocaust Memorial)?  (The planners have announced that there will not be
one this year, for the first time ever.) Are these questions related?

Hasia Segal will give an editorial on the subject.  We are inviting
spokespersons from Hebrew College and the Boston Jewish Community
Relations Council (JCRC) to respond (translation will be provided by us).

Boston area listeners: please call in!  Here are numbers to try:
367-8456, 367-8895, 367-8992

If this is successful, we hope to have a call-in show again, and let us
hope on a happier occasion, OMEN!

For information by phone, not to call in, call me at (617) 738-1870, or
send email to The Yiddish Voice at yv@world.std.com.
