Well, I'm not a Yiddish speaker, but I do speak fluent
(although a bit yeshivishe) Hebrew. My reactions:

1.      "Bal oyfes": Traditional, but reminds me of Burt
        Lancaster playing Robert Stroud in "The Birdman of
        Alcatraz".

2.      "Mistakel oyf": Nice, but I can imagine Yossel the
        Birdwatcher who isn't so good at it, who gets
        things wrong, and ends-up being called Yossel the
        `Mistayker Oaf'.

My contribution: One of my first Rabbeim (and still a
long-time friend), Rav Chaim Dovid Ackerman, used to tell
me about his grandmother, who was affectionately known as
"Gittel the Tillem-zoyger".

With this in mind, how about swapping Moishe-Nussen's
suggestion from "tsoife oyfen" to a more musical,
hyphenated term -- "oyfen-tzoyfer"?

Or, taking this a bit further; "oyf" is (in Hebrew) more of
a generic term for "fowl" -- usually chicken. Birds are
something else. All "oafot" "oafim" (fly), but a "tzipor"
(bird) "tziyaetz" (chirps).

So; how about an alliterative "tzitzen-tzoyfer"? It
combines the birds' characteristic chirping with an
allusion to the person sitting while watching
(tzitzen/sitzen). In addition, the Hebrew "tzofar" means
`horn, siren', so that a small bird's "tzitzen" is
contrasted with a larger bird's "tzofer'n".

While I'm at it, let me introduce myself -- Yonatan-Berel
Horen (although my `slave name' reads Jonathan B. :-) No
Yiddish, although my parents spoke it fluently, especially
my mother and her sisters. I emigrated to Israel 12 years
ago, and returned stateside this past May. Before going to
Israel (after returning from Vietnam) I spent some time
stationed in Mannheim, West Germany, and I still remember
nur ein bisse Deutsche. While learning in yeshiva I spent
some time off-and-on playing with a college Yiddish
textbook, but didn't learn much more than that "die
fareineke staten" means the USA. I'd like to learn the
language, but want to do so in a real classroom setting
(or, alternatively, from some old-timers -- not that Noyekh
sounds like an "alte zachen" type :-)

In Israel, the more Chassidische types reserve their Hebrew
for tefilot and Talmud, and use Yiddish for classroom
discussions and the home. Friends of mine in Brooklyn take
this a (nice) step further, using English for the "street"
(outside of home and beit hamidrash). It's a good way of
separating environments and identities.

So. My 2 cents. Nice meeting all of you, and if anyone can
help me get started in a more active way with Yiddish here
in the South Bay area, I will be most appreciative.

i need enlightment. why "machen choizek" (usually in the
negative, "mach nisht kein choizek") means "to make fun
of"? Isn't "choizek" derived from "khazak" (Hebrew for
strong)? Is it only my southern Polish parents who use this
expression? Thanks for the help,

[Leonard Prager writes:]
 
        In SYR, Moishe-Nussen would romanize his name
        Moyshe-Nosn and everyone would pronounce it
        according to his own dialect/sociolect/idiolect,
        etc.
 
Hey, Charlie, wait a minute! As I have already told the
list, I am a naive Yiddish speaker, not a savant one -- I
means I did'n learn it in books. So I dunno what SYR is; I
would fain learn it, but feel too old. Vi mn zogt: mn ken
nish alte (or should I have written alt?) bern tantsn
lernen.
 
        _Nosn_ can be pronounced /Nusn/.  But regardless of
        whether or not M.-N. agrees to Nosn, he must
        acknowledge that the final _n_ is syllabic and the
        presence of the _e_ before it is derived from NHG
        and is inauthentic.  Thus we should write _vos_,
        even though the phonological realization of the
        komets alef in some dialects is /u/.  In other
        words, we all follow the same spelling (here =
        romanizing) conventions, and if we wish to indicate
        pronunciation, we use phonetic notation.
 
Yeah, you *can* decide to spell the Kamats 'o' in SYR, but
that woulda mean that everyone knows enough Hebrew to
realize that /nusn/ carries originally one. It doesn't
fluster *me* (I started going to `heder at age 4), but I
believe that would be too demanding even of SYR-bred
yiddishists. As for the 'e' or not 'e' I don't give a
damn, if it make Leonard happy. And the 'phonetic
notation', reduced to putting inside /'s words that
*English-speaking* fellers would pronounce in some
supposed way, is most unsatisfactory; unless you can use
IPA (and in ascii you just can't!) it's worthless.
 
        I notice that the subject of how to romanize
        Yiddish is constantly being raised in _Mendele_ and
        we will have to keep hammering at it until we reach
        a a sensible and civilized consensus.
 
There is indeed a problem of writing non-roman alphabets in
e-mail, I believe I have already given my opinion on the
matter to the list. But why *romanize* Yiddish? We could,
eg decide to *hebraize* English. Let us beware of
'sensible' and 'civilized'; I know of no more ethno-
centric words: the meaning always depends on who is
speaking.
 
        The notion of spelling by ear to placate one's
        ancestors is touching but totally impractical
 
depends for whom
 
        -- and also inconsiderate of one's colleagues who
        are kept guessing what you are trying to say.
 
Would you guess that I have to guess what you mean by
writing Litvish -- which SYR really is, a la fin des fins?
 
Moishe-Nussen
