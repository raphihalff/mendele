Subject: Wallach

Jota Piasecki's glossing [6,128.5] of 'valekh' as 'gelding' (with
contemptous connotation when applied to human male) is presumably the
explanation we are seeking here. The Polish 'walach' (with "crossed l"),
like the Ukrainian 'valakh', is derived from German 'Wallach(e)' meaning
'Wallacian' or 'castrated horse'. Geldings were originally an East
European development in animal husbandry as is documented by French
'ongre' or Late Latin 'equus huniscus' both with the same meaning. The
term 'Wallacian' meanwhile in the sense '(southern) Romanian' is derived
from Old High German 'Walh' meaning originally 'Volcae', then 'Celtic'
(cf. English 'Welsh') and later 'Romance (languages)' (cf. English
'wallnut' and Yiddish 'veltshene/ velitsh nus', i.e 'Gallic nut').

Subject: Af daytsh

In answer to Ellen Prince's question [6.138] as to where Yiddish
diverges from German and where the two are similar, I know of no answer
more to my way of thinking (I am admittedly "deutschfeindlich") than
that of the Alter Belzer Rebbe who said, "Daytsh iz doyme yidish, ober
nor azoy vi a malpe iz doyme a mentsh". On another subject, the proper
meaning of tautology as opposed to pleonasm; zol zayn...

Subject: Zakh/zikh

Almost daily, scores of questions and reflections regarding Yiddish
usage, etymologies, dialectical variations, etc., run through my head.
I'm constantly impelled to bring some of these random thoughts to the
Mendele list but usually resist doing so because of some feelings of
intimidation.  As I am not a member of academia I find myself incapable
of coming anywhere near being able to match the virtuoso performances of
some of the postings that appear here. But I must hastily add that I
yield to no one, not to the most erudite of the Mendelyaners, to an
indestructible love for Yiddish.  I _revel_ in the Yiddish language! The
thought therefore occurs to me that there may be other subscribers to
Mendele who find it as daunting as I do to offer a contribution to the
list.  Perhaps, then, the list could be divided into academic and
non-academic postings and labeled as such.  Having made these prefatory
remarks and, hoping they haven't offended too many segments of Yiddish
academia, I will now get on to my Yiddish "question of the day":

As I grew up in a Yiddish speaking home of working class parents I
always heard the reflexive ("self") pronounced _zakh_, as, for instance in
shert zakh arum (gather around) etc.  After leaving home I, of course,
learned that _zikh_ is the correct form and I assumed that my parents were
using an incorrect regionalism.  I was therefore surprised to discover,
in re-reading some of the humorous tales in my 1947 edition of Immanuel
Olsvanger's "Royte Pomerantsen" that in perhaps 90% of his collected
stories, the reflexive is indeed spoken as _zakh_, or in Olsvanger's
transliteration _zikh_.  His stories are replete with such as "hert zach
ayn", "er hot zach avekgezetst", etc.  Is _zakh_ therefore as admissible
in standard Yiddish as _zikh_?

Subject: Olsvanger's umlauts

As usual, I'm never satisfied with one question, so another curiosity
pops into my head as I write.  Throughout Olsvanger's book [Royte
Pomerantsn] he puts an umlaut over the "o" in the diphthong "oy".  Even
"Royte" in the title on the book's cover has the umlaut.  What function
does the umlaut serve here? Wouldn't royte, Moyshe, azoy, etc. be
pronounced the same with or without that diacritical mark?

Subject: Tsvinter

Would any of your well-versed yiddishists know the origins of  "der
tsvinter," the yiddish word for a non-Jewish cemetery, as opposed to
the common terms of beys oylem, bais hakvores and beys chayim etc. for
Jewish cemeteries.. (My bobe used to refer to the cemetery as "dos
feld").  A Russian acquaintance thinks the word "tsvinter" might be of
Ukrainian origin.
