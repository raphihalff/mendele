Subject: A bitere shayle

I received the following "shayle" [question] from a Mendelyanerke:

"Vi azoy leygt men oys dos vort far gedempte fleysh -- roye oder
gekokhte?" [How do you spell the word for "gedempte fleysh" -- raw or
kooked?]

I promptly wrote back the following collaborative reply (I say
'collaborative' because I composed it with the loving assistance of my
wife):

" 'Gedemfte fleysh' is certainly not roye (raw) but rather gekokhte (in
English:  potted meat)."

The word is related to damp (from the German "dampf"), moderately wet,
cooked slowly, simmered, in a covered pot."

This exchange promptly elicited the following return:

"...ven ikh hob geshribn "roye" hob ikh gemeynt [when I wrote 'roye' I
meant] stew meat that one purchases in the market prior to cooking."

Well, why do I receive such "shayles"?  (One might call them "klotz
kashes" -- hiltserne [wooden] questions.   Do my posts in _Mendele_,
heaven forbid, convey an unintented, unconscious subliminal message to
the effect that in my kitchen something is always on the burner going,
that something is always cooking?...

For a change of pace, may I in this connection share with my colleagues
the following heart-warming story about a shayle of a serious nature:

A very poor woman somehow managed to scrounge together several kopkes
[pennies] and bought for the Friday, erev-shabes,  meal a scrawny
_hindl_ [diminutive for" hun," chicken].

While she was _kashering_ it, the gall broke, and she immediately took
it to the _rov_ [orthodox rabbi] to ask if it is still kosher for
consumption.

The rov said to her:  "Yidene" [woman], give the innards of your chicken
a lick with your tongue and tell me if it tastes bitter."  This test
would determine the answer to her shayle, because in the affirmative it
would be treyf, unfit for Jewish consumption.

When the woman heard the word "biter,"  she promptly answered in a rapid
breath :  "Oy vey iz es biter!  Mayn man iz krank, er halt in eyn hustn,
tog un nakht, un di kinderlekh zaynen bloyz hoyt un beyner, on a pitsl
fleysh af zeyere kerperlekh,  Oy vi biter es iz!  Got zol zikh
derbaremen af undz!" [And how bitter it is!  My husband is sick, keeps
coughing day and night, and the children are but skin and bones, with
not an ounce of flesh on their little bodies.  Oy is it bitter!  May God
have mercy on us!]

The rov did not repeat his request that she tastes to check whether the
fluid from the erupted gall spread all over.  He listened with his heart
to her bitter lament and, without skipping a heart bit, said to her:

"Got vet helfn!  Oyb s'iz biter, iz es kosher" [God will help!  Since it
is bitter, it is kosher.]

Subject: Universities with Degree-Granting Programs in Yiddish

JTS (also known as The Jewish Theological Seminary of America) has
several degree-granhting programs in and around Yiddish.  On the Masters
level, students may enroll either in Modern Jewish Studies or Jewish
Literature.  The first is an interdisciplinary program combining
history, literature, philosophy, and art. The second combines medieval
and modern Hebrew literature and modern Yiddish literature.  On the Ph.
D. level, students elect either to specialize in Hebrew or Yiddish, or
to combine the two.  Franco Melfi did both, as did Mikhail Krutikov.
The core Yiddish curriculum consists of a 3-semester survey of the
history of Yiddish literature from 1780-1980, taught in Yiddish.  There
are currently eleven students enrolled in the first semester.  Prof.
David Fishman teaches courses on East European Jewish history and
culture. Peysach Fiszman teaches beginners and intermediate Yiddish.
JTS has the largest Yiddish collection in the USA outside of the YIVO.
There is also a consortium agreement (on the Masters and Ph.D. level)
among JTS, Columbia, and NYU.

Subject: Universities with Yiddish programs

Re: Shalom Goldberg's query about Universities with Yiddish programs:

Do not forget Ohio State University.  Ohio State has a large Yiddish
program with undergraduate majors and minors, as well as a complete
graduate division through the PhD (including the MA).  The OSU Library
has a large collection of Yiddish books, movies, and other resources, as
well as maintaining a branch reading room library in the Department of
Yiddish and Ashkenazic Studies.

For information, please contact Professor Dovid N. Miller, The Ohio
State University, Dept.of Yiddish and Ashkenazic Studies, Cunz Hall,
Columbus, OH 43210.
