Subject: Saltshe

Comes from Polsih _Salcia_ which is a diminutive of _Sala_, I think
(probably equivalent to English Sally).  A woman called _Saltshe_ in
Yiddish
was probably named _Sore_ and grew up in a slightly, or extremely,
Polonized
milieu where _Sore_s were called _saltshe_.  (Like Freydes who
became
Frania, Miryems who became Mania, Sheynes and Sores who became
Sabina.) 

Best,
Dovid Braun

Subject: erotic terminology

Tayre mendelistn,

I am in the process of putting together a questionnaire to hand out to
native Yiddish speakers concerning erotic terminology.  Indulge me for a
moment to give you the background. 

I have a cousin in Jerusalem who, like me, is a son of Holocaust
survivors,
and also native Yiddish speakers.  I became a Yiddish teacher at
Stanford,
and he became someone who has a strong dislike for the language as
well as
lack of respect for the culture. Probably has a lot to do with his
relationship with his father, ober yeder hot zeyr eygen mishigas.  This
past
summer we were once again discussing the merits, or lack of, of Yiddish,
and
Izzy mentioned how Yiddish was an incomplete language that didn't have
its
own words for everything,..... he made some comment about sex, and I
said -
"Did you think your parents broke out spontaneously into a fliysig French
when they created you?  Vus den hobn zey geredt?" 
     
But to tell you the truth, not too many of these words hobn zich
arayngekrochn between me and my parents.  Closely adhering to the
culture of
the 50's and 60's , sex wasn't talked about.  The Jewish glass ceiling,
"Dos
past nisht far Yidn", kept me in the dark, while my Brooklyn English
tryefene pisk is gegangen vi oyf reydlech; and the Forward didn't have a
letters to the editor page that anywhere near resembled the one in
Penthouse.  To make matters maybe worse, if I ever find myself in bed
with
someone that speaks Yiddish, I'll be totally tongue-tied (already sounds
interesting, huh?) without the proper terminology, barely more eloquent
than
a caveman. 
   
The fact of the matter is that every language has its erotica and
language
for sex, and I know of no glossary for Yiddish, though I know the words
are
there.  I remember reading in one of Irving Howe's books about how E.
2nd
Street, on the lower East Side was where all the Jewish prostitutes and
pimps lived.What were they saying when they were transacting business
with
their customers?  What were my parents and grandparents saying?
Yiddish is
as three dimensional as any other language.  I certainly can't imagine the
majority of Jews being quiet in this situation when we're not in most
others. 
     
I am working on a questionnaire with one of my students, to send out to
native Yiddish speakers that they might send back anonymously, and
have some
people that I will interview.  I would like to ask anyone to share their
knowledge in this area with me, as well as any articles you might know
of. 
I'd love to share this with all of you and see this on Mendele, oyb nisht,
contact me directly at my e-mail address. 

Sincerely, 
Harvey Varga

Subject: walker in Yiddish

Is there a Yiddish word for walker, in this case referring to the walking
device used by older or disabled people.

Subject: prokladim

Elliot Rosenkrants asks about the meaning of prokladim. I assume that
he is
spelling something phonetically, and my intuition is that the words and
context support the idea: a por klader = a pair of dresses,&/or clothes.

Subject: "prikladn" in a "mayse fun a hinkndn"

The query about "prikludn" in Nakhman's story raises a difficult issue. 
Both the Zetser edition of the Tales and Rozhansky's Musterwerk edition
spell this noun with a yud.  Rozhansky footnotes the word as meaning
"shtof
far begodim":  cloth, textile, material.....  But Rozhansky is inaccurate so
frequently (to the point of confusing the mythological figure Pan with
"pan"--a Polish title covering the span from Mister to Lord.  In Zetser,
"prikladn" is in quotes--implying, perhaps, that the word isn't quite
current in Nakhman's (or his scribe's) Yiddish.  It might help to check the
Hebrew version of the story--and I would be interested to hear from a
Hebrew
speaker about this.  One might also consult the Pauline Press translation
of
Nakhman's Hebrew text. 
        
in Russian, "prikladn" means "trimmings"--but a Ukrainian origin would be
far more likely.  Unfortunately I have neither a Ukrainian dictionary nor
the earliest Nakhman edition handy.

Subject: Brooklyn radio stations

I thought people around here might be interested in an article in the
January 1999 issue of =Popular Communications= magazine, which is
now on
sale.  The article is "The Great Brooklyn Radio Wars!" and is all about a
collection of radio stations that used to exist in Brooklyn in the old days. 
The article mentions that several of them did a lot of Yiddish
broadcasting.
