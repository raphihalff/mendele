Subject: fatsheyle

My recollection is that "fatsheyele"(head or face covering) likely stems
from Italian, certainly from a Romance source, as in "face"(fatshey).

Subject: fatsheyle

It is likely that "fatsheyle"/"fatshelke" is derived from the Russian word
"fartuk" or the Ukrainian "fartukh" - both meaning "apron"; the Russian
diminutive of the word is used for a child's bib, while the Ukrainian word
has "child's pinafore" as a secondary meaning of "fartukh."

Subject: fatsheyle

I have read that fatsheyle is an example of words of Roman origin in
Yiddish - Italian fazzoletto. Both my grandmother (from Mogilyovskaya
Guberniya, Belarus) and my mother-in-law (from Kaunas, Lithuania), have
used fatsheylke rather than tikhl. I remember some negative comments from
my grandmother about a "low class" acquaintance: "az zi geyt arum in aza
dorfishe fatsheylke mit greyse blyumen".

It's a guess, but I would not be surprised if the word "fatsheyle" is
related to the Italian word "facciola." According to DeMauro's Dictionary
of the Italian Language, "facciola" is one of the two strips of starched
white cloth that descended from the neck and adorned the front of
magistrates' and scholars' robes in the past, especially in the 18th
century.

collo
sul davanti nella toga dei magistrati e in alcuni abiti talari in passato,
spec. nel sec. XVIII)

My bobe, who wore a fatsheyle every day of her life, never used the word
tikhl, even though it is a common synonym and her Yiddish was learned akht
vyorst fun Vilne in a little village called Vevye.  So, the question about
the etymology of "fatsheyle" could also include a borrowing from the
Lithuanian as well as the Ukrainian.

Bernard Cooperman asked about the origin of "fatsheyle" (17.001).
"Fatsheyle" (kerchief) and "fatsheylke" (handkerchief) are said to derive
from Italian "fazzoletto" (shawl; kerchief) or its Old Italian ancestor.

Try Leonid Soybelman's recording "Kletka Red: Highjacking" on Tzadik 
label.
There are punk versions of some standard Yiddish songs (not the two you
mention, though).

Subject: idioms in yizker-bukh

In connection with a yizker-bukh translation I was asked for help in
translating several Yiddish proverbs and idiomatic expressions. I can
provide translations for several, but others remain unclear. I would be
grateful for assistance. Here are the remaining puzzles. The first four 
are
clear in their literal meanings, but do they have idiomatic meanings?

      1. Ver iz der yold?
      2. Dos iz a mamzerl.
      3. Zay gezunt, Motye.
      4. Shapse, vi [perhaps: vu] loyfstu?
      5. Gut shabes, koze. ("Gut shabes" can be used to mean something
         like "Wake up and smell the coffee" or the current slang "Hello!"
         Is this just a stronger version?)
      6. A kishke a gedule.
      7. Kleyn, groys - eyn prayz.
      8. Oy! a tson!
      9. Khotsh nem im un shnayd im op fun shtrikl.
     10. Gekrogn a krasne bilet - iz gevezn porkhe-nishmose. (The second
         half - according to Niborski/Neuberg - means "nearly died of
         fright"; what about the first part?)
     11. Oy a loksh - a loksh.

Is there anything idiomatic or proverbial about "Zi iz khorev krank; zi
derkent shoyn nisht keyn mentsh" [nisht far keynem fun di mendelyaner
gezogt!]
