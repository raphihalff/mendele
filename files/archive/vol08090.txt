are in public domain and would make good candidates for digitizing. "Good"
1928 edition might still be protected, but even if it is, the copyright will
expire in 4 years, and it should be easy to negotiate with the owners for

Subject: translation of Yiddish poetry

I find Margie Schonhaut Hirshan's characterization of my approach to
poetry
blamed on my being a physician):  a. Ludicrous b. Inaccurate c. Insulting

The implication that I sacrifice all other qualities of a poem to accurate
meaning is simply not true. Many people, poets and others, have written
me
and also publically stated that my translations are usually very good and
occasionally superb. Interestingly, those people include Margie herself,
who
has written me privately, complimenting me on my translations. 

If we're going to have a civilized discussion, let's not get into ad hominem
insults.

Subject: Looking at Translations

Rokhl Korn (1898-1982), my favorite poetess (a Galitsianer too!) sang of
her
most intimate emotions in a style so open, natural and lyrical that we are
drawn into each of her memories with her. Her honesty in revelation; her
use
of nature for metaphors; and her intense sensitivities match her with Edna
St. Vincent Millay in my mind. 

Let's look at one of her love poems and two translations that adequately
reveal its meaning, but perhaps some of you will comment on which
translation captures more precisely the poetic aspects of her words. 

kh'shtey in der mitogtsayt fun dayn lebn,

               1
I stand in the noon of your life,
A corn-stalk bent down by ripe fulness in the midst of the field
That has already taken off its green June-jacket,
And grows in the golden security of coming days.

The air plays a tune on the blue-bells all along the fields,
The summer smells with the bitter smell of wild poppies~
Of steaming hot earth,
And of your hair.

And when day braids her flaxen plaits,
And evening gathers the pearls on the trees,
My brown body falls at your feet
Like a corn-stalk bending before the reaper.
               translated by Joseph Leftwich

              2
I stand in the midday...

I stand in the midday of your life,
a stalk bent in fullness,
no longer wearing the green of June,
growing in golden certainty of days to come.

The wind stirs lilac bells in far-off meadows. 
Summer has the bitter scent of wild poppies, 
of steamy earth, 
and of my hair.
And when day puts up her blond hair in braids 
and evening gathers pearls of dew,
my brown body falls at your feet, 
a stalk breaking before the harvester.
                 translated by Seymour Levitan

Subject: Cynthia Ozick on translating Yiddish

Cynthia Ozick wrote a delighfully perverse little essay on the difficulties
of translating Yiddish poetry: "Prayer Leader", PROOFTEXTS 3 (1983):
1-8. 
It focuses on the first line (and the title) of a poem by Dovid Einhorn:
"Geshtorbn der letster bal-tfile".  After reading that no one could say that
there is ever a perfect way to translate.

Subject: Soviet Yiddish

I am of course delighted that my review of the Weinberg book gave rise to a
consideration of soviet yiddish and yiddish literature.  Lest I be
misunderstood, I happen to be a great admirer of Soviet Yiddish poetry,
which for all the ideological kowtowing and hypocritical cant still strikes
me as linguistically rich, prosodically inventive, its slavicisms and
occasional neologisms combining to raise it to a level often far more
exciting than much of the poetry produced by the "yunge" or the "inzikhistn" 
in the United States.  (They are more to be compared to Yung Vilne than
the
Yunge), I still go back occasionally to the selections in A SHPIGL OYF A
SHTEYN, a marvelous book, with its wonderful poems by Kushnirov, Izi
Kharik,
and others.  The tragedy of these gfifted writers (and that includes Dovid
Bergelson and other prose-writers, too), of course, was to be hounded and
villified by the appointed guardians of proletarian literature and then
socialist realism, with results that you are well aware of..

I also agree with Bruin that Soviet Yiddish, during its tragically brief
span, succeeded in incorporating very good slavisms and revive words
which
in other countries had withered on the vine.

There was nothing wrong with the decision to spell Hebrew words
phonetically
-- it was a decision taken by the CYSHO schools, too, in the l930s.  What
was ridiculous, of course, was the spelling of nun and mem etc. at the ed of
words as if sof nun etc. had never existed--a species of ideological
dafkizmus, typical of the corrosive inanities of the yevsektsia and their
literary "specialists."

Incidentally, a slightly revised Yiddish version of my TLS essay appears in
the forthcoming issue of UNDZER TSAYT, the Bund journal.

Subject: A new approach to keeping Yiddish alive

To enter into the ongoing discussion regarding the viability of Yiddish, I
should like to say that years ago I attempted to organize a movement to
work
towards the effort of keeping Yiddish alive.  I tentatively named this
entity The Society for the Preservation and Revitalization of Yiddish
(SPRY).  But I eventually realized the futility of trying to convince
skeptics of the value of preserving Yiddish and the campaign crumbled. 

Happily, I am now engaged in another venture which is going a long way
towards fulfilling the goal of reinvigorating an interest in Yiddish.  I am
translating the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan into Yiddish.  In doing these
translations I adhere faithfully to Gilbert's dazzling rhymes while
striving to preserve unblemished Yiddish.  I always aim to maintain a
perfect match of verbal to musical cadence so that the lyric conforms to the
accentuation and rhythm of each musical phrase.  These works have been
successful in bringing a renewed sense of the charm of Yiddish to U.S.,
Canadian and English audiences via fully staged productions. I was
particularly interested in what the reaction of Yiddish G&S performances
would be in England, the birthplace of Gilbert & Sullivan.  To my delight,
two summers ago we played in London and scores of people, from both the
Jewish and non-Jewish community, had to be turned away at four sold out
performances at the Rudolph Steiner Theatre in Regent Park. 

Any Mendelyaner who would like to find out what this is all about might
wish
to learn that a new spin on THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE with Yiddish
lyrics (in
simultaneous English translation), featuring Israeli cantor Dudu Fisher,
star of Broadway's 'Les Miserables' will take place from April 10th to May
2, 1999 at the Jewish Repertory Theatre's PLAYHOUSE 91, 316 East 91st
Street, New York, NY 10128.  Eleanor Reissa and Zalmen Mlotek, the
director/musical director team of such hits as 'Those Were the Days', will
be at the helm of this new approach to Gilbert & Sullivan.  For a brochure
listing the schedule of performances or for additional information, please
call the Playhouse 91 boxoffice at (212) 831-2000 or (212) 831-2001.

From: Hugh Denman <h.denman@ucl.ac.uk>
Subject: Shreib in Yiddish! (sic!)

Since khaver Kurtzman has raised the topic [8.087:9], I would like to
propose a set of ground-rules almost diametrically opposed to his: 

1. Write in either Yiddish or English, but never both. [Excellent as
_Mendele_ certainly is in many respects, it cannot be denied that it does
suffer from a certain diffuseness and bilingual contributions just increase
the amount of rapid scrolling called for. After all, most readers of
_Mendele_ may be assumed to read both languages with almost equal
facility. 
Someone will perhaps object that allowing monolingual English is unfair to
Mendelyaner in Russia, Japan, France etc., but I venture to speculate that
they too read English as readily as Yiddish.]

2. Write in whichever language you write better. [There is no virtue in
filling _Mendele_ with Yiddish so agrammatical and unidiomatic that it
makes
the reader wince!]

3. If you write in Yiddish, write consistently either in klal-yidish or in
your native dialect. 

4. Whether you write Yiddish in its standard version or in one of its
regional varieties, use the accurate, scientific YIVO-transcription
(supplemented in the case of those dialects in which vowel-length
distinctions play a signicant role by the conventional vowel-length symbol
[:], thus 'ma:n haym' = 'mayn heym'). [Surely it is not too much to ask that
people with a serious interest in Yiddish should eschew transcriptions that,
in as far as they possess any consistency at all, rest on the implicit
assumption that Yiddish is just a kind of German.]
