Subject: Kielbasa, meshtes, etc.
[kielbasa]

	Polish _kielbasa_ (with the slashed l), Russian _kolbasa_,
Slovak _klobasa_, etc. are of uncertain origin, but may be from
Turkic.  Vasmer cites the Turkish word _kulbasty_ (with two dots
over the u), meaning grilled (?) meat.  The derivation from Hebrew
_kol basar_, originally proposed by the Vienna Slavist and
Yiddishist Berneker early in this century, has not received much
support.

[meshtes]

	Noyekh's grandmother's term for slippers is in Stutchkoff,
and the 1908 Hrynchenko dictionary of Ukrainian lists the word
_meshty_, defined as "Tatar shoes, light shoes."

[cormorants]

	Again in response to our Shames:  Stutchkoff lists both the
Polish _kormorant_ and the Russian _baklan_ in his entry for Yiddish
bird names.

[a berishe toyve]

	Eli Katz mentioned this some time ago.  The expression is
well known in Russian (_medvezh'ia usluga_) and comes from a fable
by Ivan Krylov, the Russian LaFontaine.  The fable is called "The
Hermit and the Bear," and tells about the friendship that develops
between the two. One day the bear is watching while his friend naps
and tries to keep a fly from disturbing him.  Finally, frustrated by
the fly, which keeps returning, the bear hits the fly with a rock,
splitting his friend's head in the process.  Krylov's moral:  "A
helpful fool is more dangerous than an enemy."

This "O" pronunciation  versus "OY" is not the  only "Ashkenazic"
one. If we  take the word "Ashkenazic"  in its basic meaning,  i.e.
that in Germany, than at  least *there*, the pronunciation  was "OU"
something like in hOUr or hOUse, or the  German "AU".  So it seems
that there is a wider variety in the way the "holem" is pronounced.

Subject: Introduction

I am a recent joiner of Mendele... siz a heartfelt nachas for me to
find such an Email group. I have been a Yiddish folksinger for
decades and also sing Ladino and Hebrew and Russian
songs..particulaly those that tsemish Yiddish words and Russian
words.

My Yiddish is a tsebrochene...I mix in a lot of English when I
cannot find the Yiddish word. However, I particularly need Yiddish
words for parts of the body now, as I have begun to sing the song:

Shlof, shlof shlof,
der tate fet foren in dorf
Vet er koifen an eppele
'svet zayn a gezunt oifn keppele

to my grandchildren. SO far, I have made up rymes for other parts of
the body that I know in Yiddish...but do not know how to say words
like elbow or cheek or eyebrow or knees etc.

The rhymes I have sung them already are for
hezele and nezele
nisele and fisele
yaichele and baichele
faygele and eygele
perele and herele

If you can suggest other rhytming gifts and parts of the body in
Yiddish, I should be most appreciative.

Incidentally, I am a professor of Child Develoment at Syracuse
University, and when I teach Language develoment in the Spring
semester, sometimes  I sing a bit of this lullabye....and last
spring One young man lit up and said that he remembered his bubba
singing that to him! Thanks for the words and rhymes in advance!

Alice S. Honig.
