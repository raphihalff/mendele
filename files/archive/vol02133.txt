Subject: Emet/emes

Arn Abramson answered Sigrid Peterson's question about emet
in Israeli Hebrew clearly and preciselly.  I can only add a
few sidelights.  In Israeli Hebrew the stress in this word
is indeed on the last syllable in all contexts that I can
imagine.  (Well, occasionally someone might say it the
Yiddish way, for slightly humorous ["ludic"] effect, with
-s in place of -t and stress on the penult: Emes.)  If some
Israelis put the stress on the penult in the blessing for
the haftara, I think it's not precisely due to the rhythmic
requirements of the melody but rather that along with the
traditional melody they retain some bits of the traditional
pronunciation.  For instance some Israelis pronounce a
tseyre as /ey/ in reciting the liturgy, though it's /e/
(same as segol) in their speech: /seyfer/ in liturgy,
/sefer/ in speech, but /melekh/, with two segols, in both.

The pre-history of emet explains why it does not behave as
a segolate.  In segolates, like sefer, melekh, pesakh, or
kotel 'wall', the last vowel is, or at least historically
was, epenthetic, and in a sense isn't there, as far as
stress placement is concerned, so stress goes on what is IN
A SENSE the last syllable, really the penultimate.  Compare
Hebrew kElev 'dog' with Arabic kalb and Aramaic kalba;
Hebrew must have once had kalb, then kAleb, then kElev.
The historical root of emet was aleph-mem-nun, the same as
in amen, and the -t is a suffix, so the word was
underlyingly something like *'emen-t.  If it had gotten an
epenthetic vowel it would have ended up something like
*emEnet, with stress on the middle syllable (and rhyming
with shamEnet 'cream', a wonderful blend of Hebrew shemen
'oil' and Yiddish shmant or smetene!).  However, in very
early Hebrew, before the Biblical spelling was fixed, the
n-t sequence in *ement assimilated to t-t, then just -t,
before it had a chance to get split by an epenthetic vowel
as in shamEnet.  The upshot of it all is that it SHOULD
have been a segolate *emEnet, but it ended up a
non-segolate emEt.

Subject: RE: "Reflexives"

Thanks to Bob Rothstein for telling us about "zikh
ibergeyn" as an inherently "reflexive" verb. I had often
wondered (while singing "Reyzele") why it was "gey _zikh_
nokh a por mol iber", but 2 lines later "gey ikh _mir_ a
freylekher".

What I think now is that the system in Gebirtig's (the
author's) dialect had "zikh" for accusative reflexives, but
it still had "mir" for the 1sg dative reflexive. "zikh
ibergeyn" takes an accusative reflexive, like other
inherently "reflexive" verbs.  So in some dialects it might
be "gey _dikh_ iber", but in this dialect we have the more
'slavicized' "zikh".  Two lines later we don't have an
inherent reflexive, we have the 'ethical dative' type, and
this type is indeed dative, in dialects that still
distinguish dative and accusative.  So the case is
different, and that can explain the different usage.

And some people say Yiddish doesn't have grammar!

Subject: reflexive pronouns

I am curious about the conjugation of reflexive pronouns,
i.e. ikh shem mikh, du shemst dikh, etc. instead of ikh
shem zikh, du shemst zikh, etc. Is this in fact an older
usage, as someone suggested? I was once taught that this is
a variation used in a particular dialect.

Subject: Beginnings

David Neal Miller came up with a wonderful idea last week.
He suggested that we exchange favorite beginnings and
perhaps discuss them.  As is often the case, no one wants
to be first. A perfect opportunity for the shames!
Everybody will guess the author, but who cares?
