Subject: Matzoh -- gefrishte and brie

My family and their friends (all from Sokolifke, a village
near Kiev) always referred to Matzah scrambled with eggs,
salt and pepper as gefrishte matzoh. They knew nothing
about "matzoh brie."  When I went off to graduate school
and came into contact with Jews whose origins were in other
parts of Europe, "matzoh brie" was the word for something
similar to gefrishte matzoh.  But the differences were
interesting.  Matzoh brie was often sweet-- made with
powdered sugar, sometimes with jelly.  It was a slightly
more complicated dish than ge- frishte matzoh, actually, a
kind of delicacy.

Gefrishte matzoh was more prost, certainly filling -- a
meal by itself.  My mother's recipe was: (for 2) 2 full
squares of matzoh, 3 eggs, 1/4 cup milk, salt and pepper.
Beat eggs and milk. Hold matzos under hot water until soft,
break into smaller pieces, mix into egg batter.  Scramble
the mixture -- salt and pepper to taste.  As a breakfast
dish this will hold one for several hours.  In any case, I
think there may be region al and "class" differences in
these variations in cuisine. Doesn't the term matzoh brie
suggest something a bit more "elevated" and fancy -- a more
urban, refined dish?

Subject: Ex cathedra

      As a physical scientist who has an amateur's interest
in the subject of Yiddish, I am sometimes at a loss at what
to do with the large number of contradictory ex-cathedra
statements that I read.  Our tradition is more modest, and
even Nobelists will use a question mark occasionally and
say "In my opinion ..." or "I think..." [nothing wrong with
that, is there?] or "It seems to me..."

      Perhaps it would help if the writers who are
infallible would indicate their infallibility - perhaps
with an "INFA" at the top of their postings.  This would
help outsiders and viewers like myself inordinately.

      Thanks and mo'adim l'simHa.

I teach linguistics at Sonoma State University and do
Yiddish when I can. If anyone is interested, I recently
published a bi-lingual edi- tion of 16 Peretz stories (my
own translations together with the originals, in modern
orthography, on facing pages).  It can be obtained from the
Zhitlowsky Foundation for Jewish Culture, 1133 Broadway,
Room 1019, New York, NY 10010.
