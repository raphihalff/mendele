Subject: alle montag un donershtag

Monday and Thursday, in addition to fasting on Mondays and Thursdays
for part of the year, Monday and Thursday are marked by some
differences in morning prayers, particularly in the penance which is
lengthened for all but two months and the reading of the Torah which
is always done.

always done is alle montag un donershtag.

Subject: laks, salmon

An article in Scientific American about 35-40 years ago claimed that
counting, beginning in Teutonic Germany and spreading into the
Middle East went

One, Two, ... Nine, Ten, Lox [or lax or related words]. lax and lox
[not the Roman lex] were salmon related or derived in all these
languages, according to the article.

ah, very true--*if* i were writing yiddish! but i was using a by now
well-entrenched *english* word, which is of course invariant with
respect to gender (cp. beatnik, but not *beatnitse; refusenik, but
not *refusenitse...)

heh heh...

ellen prince, only a nudnik, never a nudnitse...

Subject: Rebbe/Rebbetsin

The recent discussion about Mendelnik/Meldenitse for mitglider fun
Mendele raises another question in my mind. A former student went on
to become an ordained rabbi. She will be visiting in a few weeks
with her husband. How shall I address them. Can there be a female
Rebbe? Obviously she's not a Rebbetsin. But how should her husband
be addressed?

A shayne, groise, hartsidige dank,

Henry Breitrose (vos voynt in Stanford, avadeh.)

Does anyone know of any Yiddish clubs or classes in the Northern
Virginia or DC Area?
