Subject: Lokshn

Re Leonard Prager's fine rumination on Lokshn:  but the American use of
"using your noodle" is simply a misunderstanding of "noddle,"  head. This
word shows up in the *American Heritage Dictionary* but I always thought of
it as a British word.  It comes from the Middle English *nodel*, back of
the head, as "to nod" comes from the Middle English *nodden*.

Subject: loksh

In our neighborhood in New Jersey "loksh" was used to denote someone of
Italian origin, as in loksh = spaghetti.  Does anyone else remember it that
way?

Subject: Lokshn Issue

I enjoyed reading the Lokshn issue of TMR. Growing up in Brookllyn we also
used Loksh as a nickname for an Italian.

Subject: A summery

The following saying sums the summer season as observed by traditional
Jews. I assume that the rather doleful connotations are intended to
contrast with the summer of blue skies, colourful butterflies and
buzzing bees.

zibn vokhn tsaylt men, dray vokhn klogt men in fir vokhn blost men.

Subject: Terminology on holocaust

I would like to support Mr. Herzog in his discomfort with words like the
German "Judenrein". When discussing what happened to Jews during world war
II, the terminology that Yiddish speakers used and continue to use is very
different from what exists in English or German. When the German terms were
used by Yiddish speakers of my parents generation it was done with irony
and bitterness. I think it is important to look at those German words in
their own context. Along with "Judenrein" was also "vernichtigung",
literally to make "nothing" of the Jews. I want to urge the revival and
retention of the Yiddish words in discourse about the Holocaust.

Our words included "khorbn" (Khurbn) in some dialects, the plain and potent
"merder" meaning simply and aptly the murder. "Shekhtn" , slaughter was
commonly used. I am concerned that as the discourse about the Holocaust
shifts into English, with liberal doses of German and Russian, a new
terminology appears that is either weakened oreven misleading. The English
"annihilation" is much weaker than "shekhtn" and misses the moral import of
"merder". Strongest of the words was the simple "daytchn" with all the
weight of what that meant to the Jews of the time and thereafter.

Subject: Chasene Valts--Anniversary Waltz

I have both the Vanguard stereo lab recording and the Vanguard cassette
with Jan Peerce singing the Anniversary Waltz in Yidish. The
recording,1963, is entitled Jan Peerce Sings Yiddish Folk Songs. Orchestra
conducted by Abraham Ellstein. Words by Chaim Tauber. Music by I.
Ivanovici. The text that Bob Rothstein submitted looks quite complete.. Jan
Peerce sings it a little differently, and assuming there's an interest in
Peerce's version, here it is as sung by Jan Peerce:

Kum, tants mit mir
Undzer valts fun amol
Gehat nor mit dir.
kh'hob dikh lib on a tsol.

Tsum ershtn mol,
Ven ikh hob dikh derzen [derzeyn]
Geshpilt hot men dan
Undzer valts azoy sheyn.

Tsvey yunge hertser
Mir zenen geven [geveyn]
Libe's gefiln
Umshuldik un reyn

Gedrikt hob ikh dikh
Azoy hertslikh tsu mir
Zikh ayngelibt
Bald in dir.

Koym zikh dervart
Fun  der shul nor aroys
Gefayert a khasene,
Glik azoy groys

Gedenkstu di nakht
Hot geshpilt di muzik
Dem zelbn valts fun glik.

Lebt nokh di nakht
Yene gliklikhe nakht
Freyd on a shir,
Far undz beyde gebrakht.

Khotsh zilber di hor,
Un di fis zenen mid,
In harts klingt nokh alts
Undzer lib', undzer valts.

[He sings the last two lines again after a short musical interlude.]

If you have the record, or the tape: a Vanguard twofer cassette "The Yiddish
Dream." you can sing along with Jan.

One more addition to the drimblen frage: From Yakov Shmuel Toybes, Tsvey
Mol Khay: 36 Yidishe Limeriks, New York: 1962, Limerik No. 8 (p. 14):

Men shpilt shtendik ping-pong in Hong-Kong,
Tog un nakht drimblt der gang;
Un dos glaykhe gekling
Hert ir oykh in Pei-ping,
Say dem gang, say Pei-pinger ping-pong!
