Subject: Call for participation in Voices of the World

Should Yiddish be included in an international media project on endangered
languages?  For information see The Linguist List at
http://linguistlist.org/issues/16/16-1693.html.

From the account of the project:

    Voices of the World aims to build international popular awareness of
    the diversity of mankind through a world-wide documentary film and media
    project. We want to portray the peoples of the world, giving face and
    voice to each culture and empowering every language community to speak.

[...]

    Voices of the World is an international non-profit initiative of
    UNESCO's Goodwill Ambassador for Languages Mrs. Vigdis Finnbogadottr,
    based on an original idea by the internationally acclaimed filmmaker
    Janus Billeskov Jansen, supported by the Danish Government, the UN and
    by leading linguists from all >over the world.

[...]

    Our first task is to create a media event in connection with UN's 60th
    anniversary in October 2005. All the Nordic public service TV stations are
    already committed to this broadcast. We are presently working on similar
    arrangements with other European and international TV-stations. Our aim is
    to reach a global TV-audience.

[...]

    Voices will tell the story of the cultural and linguistic loss the
    world is suffering from the threat of language endangerment. The film takes
    its point of departure in a personal talk with UN Secretary-General Mr.
    Kofi Annan, in his own mother tongue Fante, expressing his concerns for
    cultural and linguistic diversity.

[...]

    We seek case stories, which pinpoint the various stages from language
    endangerment to language death. We look for storytellers who can explain
    what it feels like to loose one's language.

[...]

    We are looking for charismatic storytellers who can tell moving
    personal stories to the world in their own language.

[...]

    After the film is finished, all the footage collected and shot for the
    Voices of the World project will be handed over to the Vigdis
    Finnbogadottr Institute of Foreign Languages at University of Iceland.
    The aim of Voices of the World and the university is to create a
    database of all the world's languages, accessible to everybody via the
    internet.

    Among the topics to be covered are "the language generation gap,"
    'language suppression," "language and technology" and "language
    revitalization."

Subject: Re: kak zey bkheyrem

Let's get back to my mames yidish.  ven men tut epes bkherem -- you do it
freely...you give it freely. So, when when one said of a person or group
"ikh kak af zey bkeyrem"...it meant that "along with all the other
reasons I gave for not liking or agreeing with that group, I also shit on
them". I suppose in that sense of the word it follows the classical
meaning of "kheyrem" in that "Ikh kak of zey bkherem" is a form of
reading them out your life.

Subject: Proposals for the Symposium for Yiddish Studies in Germany

Because we didn't announce this year's symposium for Yiddish Studies in
Germany - which is to take place in Trier 26-28 September - we have
extended the deadline.

Abstracts can be submitted until June 15 to Simon Neuberg and/or Marion
Aptroot (neuberg@uni-trier.de and aptroot@phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de). The
conference languages are Yiddish and German (and papers are to be read in
one of these languages).

More information about the symposium and an archive of past programs can be
found on the Yiddish Studies Websites of the Universities of Trier and
Duesseldorf (Heinrich-Heine-Universitaet).

Subject: Re: orkheporkhe

in der alter heym it was not uncommon for poor itinerants to spend the
night in the local botei-midroshim.From the context in the story (thank you
for posting the URL), one can deduce that orkhe-porkhe means "guests
that seem to come out of nowhere", or "poor guests, of whom there is no
shortage",  in today's understanding more like homeless people - those whom
the rest of us would probably not choose to take into our own homes as
guests. From "orkhim" as in "hakhnoses-orkhim" and "porkhim" perhaps from
"froyakh" meaning flourish...

According to Even Shoshan's Hebrew-Hebrew dictionary, arhey parhey is
Aramaic and appears in "Ktubot".  It means wanderers, migrants, people
without a steady home. Mendele is quoted, as well as Bialik and Shneor.

Yoyne Freer asks in vol. 15007 about the meaning of orkheporkhe. She
correctly assumes it to be 'loshn-koydesh'. Niborski (fun loshn-koydesh
shtamike verter) gives two spellings: אורחי and פּרחיand ארחי-ditto, preferring the last.
His translation: vanderer, medine-geyer, betler. In his French-Yiddish
dict. he translates it: gueux, clochard. The 'wanderer' is in the first
part [shoresh alef-resh-khet - to travel. May be the wanderer gathers
flowers in the medine?

It is an Aramaic expression which in Hebrew would be אורחים פּורחים. Literally it means "fleeting visitors", i.e., here today and gone tomorrow. It is used in Hebrew in the same sense as in Yiddish: vagrants, hoboes.

orkhey porkhey derives from the word oreakh, which is guest in Hebrew and
porekh which is some body who is literally here one moment gone the next.

On second thought, the second part of orkheporkhe might not be of
loshn-koydesh origin, but a Polish word in the guise of a losh-koydesh
word, shaped after the first part.

a 'porkh' is, according to Bernstein, a mangy person; fig. a good for
nothing. He relates this Polish word to another Polish word: parszywy -
scabby, mangy; fig. common, low class.

Weinreikh gives both words as:
parkh - canker, ulcer; (vulgar) rat, stingy person
parshive -mean, vile.
