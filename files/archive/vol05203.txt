Subject: The apostrophe in Romanized Yiddish

In Yiddish, as in English, contractions are shown, in writing and in
printing, by an apostrophe:  Ikh'l (ikh vil or ikh vel), mir'n (mir
veln), s'iz (es or se iz), and so on.  In the possessive case, however,
it is different:  While English takes an apostrophe before the final /s/,
Yiddish does not take one, and the final /s/ alone, the --samekh --,
suffices to indicate the possessive:   Zayn mames oygn [his mother's
eyes];  Khanes  bukh [Khane's book]; Moyshe rabeynus ki'ele [Moyshe
Rabeynu's little cow]; Yankl Zlates [Yankl Zlate's, a husband who for
some reason is called possessively after his wife].

I suggest that in _romanized_ Yiddish the apostrophe could play a special
importance of phonetic clarification and thus gain a new and significant
value.

a)  To highlight the _Yiddish_ pronunciation of a word or name, as
distinct from another possible pronunciation.  In a recent post Ron
Robboy (5.181,2) wrote that Shmu'el, with an apostrophe, "is clearly less
Yiddish, is it not?" [than without the apostrophe].  I do not think so.
If one wishes to differentiate in writing between the Sephardic, modern
Hebrew pronunciation of ShmuEl and the Yiddish pronunciation Shmu'el,
that apostrophe is indeed helpful;

b) To separate certain diphthongs, especially /ie/ and /oe/, for example:

1.  In English the letters /ie/ are pronounced almost as if they were
joined together, for instance _frIEnds_, but in romanized Yiddish these
two letters should be separated by an apostrophe, for example "mi'es,"
[ugly], ki'ele [little cow], thus making sure that each vowel will be
pronounced separately as two independent syllables;

2.  Insert an apostrophe between the /i/ and /e/ in the two-syllabic
Yiddish/Hebrew word "shi'er [lesson, limit], in order to emphasize the
fact that it has two distinct syllables, as above, and thus differentiate
it from the sound of the English monosyllabic "sheer;"

3.  To separate by an apostrophe the /o/ from the /e/ in such words as
"to'es (error, mistake), so that it would _not_ be read, or sound, as the
English "toes," and each vowel will be read, again, separately and
independently, for each syllable.  Similarly, in the Yiddish expression
(from the Hebrew) "nisim veniflo'es" (miracles over miracles), for the
same purpose and reason;

4.  In English the letter /k/ before an /n/ is usually silent.  But if
you wish the /k/ pronounced in a Yiddish word, an apostrophe would
clearly help. Take, for instance, the word "knockers."  In Yiddish it has
a totally different meaning than in English.  The /k/ is pronounced and
the /n/ is soft, and should therefore be spelled with an apostrophe --
"k'nyakers" [derisively, "big shots," those who habitually make big
noises about their own doings].  The apostrophe after the /k/ will serve
as a clear sign that the letter should be voiced.

5.  In Hebrew the _shvo_ or _shva_ (shown by the diacritic sign of a
colon under a letter) means that that particular letter has no vowel.
The convention in romanization is that an /e/ is inserted, in place of
the non-vowel diacritic, for example "mevinim" while, if transliterated
-- that is letter by letter -- it would be more correct to romanize it as
"m'vinim." Another example:  "Tehilim [Psalms].  The /e/ after the
initial letter is inserted by convention, but it should not be pronounced
as a separate syllable /te/, but only the sound of the /t/ made audible.
The correct transliteration is therefore T'hilim.

From the several illustrations above it is quite evident that the
apostrophe has an important part to play in Yiddish romanization.

Subject: Shamus and tokhes

I have seen shamus as private detective in some author's detective
stories and have come across it in movies based on the stories of the
author. For the life of me, I can not retrieve the name at the moment but
i vaguely remember Humphrey Bogart reciting the memorable word.

Tokhes afn tish strikes me as a play on takhlis afn tish, let's get to
the real stuff. The latter may have been used in card games, don't bluff,
let's see your hand, put your cards on the table.

Subject: Shamus

The "shamus" referenced by the NY Times puzzle [5.201] is pronounced
sha mus, and is '20's and '30's American slang for "detective" , "private
eye".  It is a slang term used throughout Dashell Hammett's Continental
Op stories. Hammett was a private Eye (actually, a Pinkerton!) in San
Francisco in the '20's, so I assume it is authentic. I have always
assumed that it has an Irish, not a Yiddish, derivation, given the
difference in pronounciation.  Unfortunately, I lack an American slang
dictionary and can not tell you more.

Irishmen in America, and so many of them connected with police work." nm]

Subject: Shamus

I'd suspect that the Irish name "Seamus" has more to do with "shamus"
than the Hebrew (off-the-cuff guess).  I can also speak for a probably
large class of people for whom the first association of the Hebrew
"shamos" was the "top guy" Chanukah candle, maybe just a couple of leaps
closer in semantic space to Dick Tracy than the Sexton...

I always wanted Jaime to meet Hymie...

Subject: Shamus

The quoting of "Shamus" In Vol 5.201 reminds me of the "hard boiled"
detective stories of the 40's and 50's. Dashiell Hammett and Raymond
Chandler frequently had the police use the term "Shamus" in a derogatory
sense to refer to a private detective.These authors also invented terms
like "gunsel" for a gunman which may have Yiddish roots.
