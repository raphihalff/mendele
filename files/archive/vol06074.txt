Subject: The Forward Association- let's bear witness

It is with a pervasive, penetrating sadness that I read the input on
Mendele about the transfer of sovereignty within the Forward
Association, of the no-longer-covert hostility to the Forverts, of this
testament to the chasmic/cosmic proportions of the generation gap.

Like Miniver Cheevy, I bemoan today, and how computerized accountants
reign, how in days gone by brave-hearted idealists and courageous poets
brandished the swords formed by pens with di oysyelekh that ruled, when
immigrant laborers with mazolyes oyf di hent always found sufficient,
hard-earned coins to support and sustain anything they believed.

Is it not their intensity and toil that created the legendary shoulders
strong enough to carry the Forward Association of today? Is it not these
same shoulders upon which the Association stands (if we do not lose our
historical perspective) that boost the Association members high enough
to think they see beyond the blue, nevermore in the red!, horizon? (Had
accountants ruled the farvaltungs, in the golden age of Yiddish and of
Yiddish education, not even one shule would have existed.)

I bemoan that the fight for Yiddish in the land of the NY Times was
assigned to youths with busted slingshots when tanks like Yosl Mlotek
are ignored across the hall. I lament how the Forverts is ignored when
it boasts the wonderful "In der Velt Fun Yidish" by the glorious
Mloteks, and the  ever-enlightening "Kapitlekh Yidish" by Dovid Katz
from Oxford.

I bemoan that in the Forward -'the station/paper that speaks your
language'- the Philologos column is written by a Hebraist, when it
should be supporting the Yidishists that exist in New York. Where is the
sharp, narrow focus that penetrates? Why strive to become catholic in
taste?

Like Hershl Hartman, I recall the pride that a station was created with
call letters that stood for the initials of Eugene Victor Debs. Like
young Ruvn Millman (who breaths the old idealism), we should be stirred
to anger, to action.

Today, I read the very modern Fast Forward section (undoubtedly a shot
to keep the paper out of the red) and cringe at the superficiality and
narishkayt of some of the articles (i.e. a wife(?) who needs no children
because she babies her husband instead, and they wear matching p.j.s).
Doesn't that promote psychic health, and perpetuate Yiddishkeit! Isn't
that a continuation of the genius of Ab Cahan! (Don't misinterpret - I
will still support the Forward evermore.)

But instead of these Kevorkianesque ideas, where is the creative energy
that spills over in the pages of the Forverts? where are the Saposniks
et al to breathe new life into radio programming? Are there no other
poet-generals like Elie Wiesel to lead us? Have we even reached for the
lantern to seek them out?

And haven't we learned from Elie Wiesel to bear witness? To tell, to
speak, to record how the Forward Hour floated through every open window
on the air waves every Sunday morning permeating entire neighborhoods
with its sweet sounds of Yiddish. How we were lovingly hushed by every
relative,, every lantsman we visited, and it felt so yontefdik, until
the beloved theme song heralded that the hour was completed? Only then
were we tenderly offered the cookies covered with mon, or the egg cream.

Who will tell how discussion, often heated, at family get-togethers
revolved around the writings and programming of the Forverts. How
Minkoff and Reisen and Opatashu and Bashevis were household words, not
names to be searched out in-hard-to-come-by anthologies. And how often
we were assembled in one room to sit and hear the articles or poetry or
segments of novels read aloud.

And how we coalesced and fused into a family, and felt like brothers and
sisters to every Jew anywhere in the world, surrounded by all this
Yiddishkeit, idealism and beauty?

Who remembers, and will tell, when Yiddish was a religion? And was not
yet a business.

Subject: WEVD and Yiddish programs

Since radio station WEVD came in for considerable criticism for (it was
said) dropping Yiddish, I checked with people at the Workmen's Circle,
and they obtained the following statement from the president of the
Forward Association. I hope you find it publishable.

     From: Karl Zukerman (fwd)

     Here is the official response of the Forward Association.  If you
     want to "broadcast" it, we would encourage you to do so.

          Contrary to any malicious rumors on Mendele on September 24,
          WEVD will continue to broadcast Yiddish News daily, The
          Forward Hour and News Commentary in Yiddish every Sunday as it
          is at present.

Subject: Lists of libraries and schools

I am working on compiling two lists that will appear on the Internet
very soon in their own site  and I would be very grateful if you could
please help in  compiling as accurate and as a complete list as
possible:

A. Libraries that have Yiddish book collections (anything over 1,000
approx.).

Can anyone please help in contributing the names of the libraries that
they know of, either on campuses or public collections with volumes in
Yiddish. Please don't hesitate to contribute only one name if that's all
you may know. I may get duplicates, that's okay. I will "clean" the list
and add to it those names that I already have if they are not provided
by you.  Whatever library you can think of is okay.

B. Schools that offer  Yiddish classes, undergraduate degree, graduate
degree, post graduate work, or even continuing education. Hischools are
okay too if there are any public schools that anyone may know of.  I
have a small list of the schools and I am certain that it is much
greater than that.

No geographic limitations please for either list.  Your assistance and
help is most valued and will be deeply appreciated. I also sure thast
people pursing the study of Yiddish will also be very thankful for
having such a great resource at their fingertips.

A groys'n dank eich far di hilf.

Shalom Goldberg

Subject: "Af" the correct romanization

The correct standardized romanization of the preposition "oyf" (alef,
vov, yud, lange-fey) is _af_, as evidenced in spoken Yiddish:  afn
pripetshik, afn tish, af snay [again], and in many other elocutions.

"Af" is the pronunciation recommended for "oyf" by Uriel Weinreich in
_College Yiddish_ and in the _Yiddish-English/English-Yiddish
Dictionary_; also by Mordkhe Schaechter in _Yiddish Tsvey_.

Authoritative examples:  The Yiddish name of the quarterly _Oyfn Shvel_
is romanized on the masthead _Afn Shvel_;  and the recently published
book by David Goldberg is called _yidish af Yidish_ (Yale University
Press).

Warning:  Do not generalize from oyf-af to other words with vov-yud (as
in oyf).  Pronounce oykh, boykh, yoykh, for example, as spelled.
