Subject: Political salutations

Mendele's postings about khaver/khaverte brought memories of my parents,
right-wing Socialists and ardent farvalter in the Arbeter Ring. They were
addressed as Freynt Sheynhayt and Freyndine Sheynhayt, and used Freynt
and Freyndine when they addressed someone. Khaver/khaverte was left to
the linke I.W.O.niks.

In retrospect, was this choice, perhaps, their means of separation from
the linke, the enemy, who used khaver and khaverte for salutations? I
also recall that at times they would use the feminine article only in
lieu of freyndine when referring to the woman, and say, "Freynt Sheynkin
un di Sheynkin gayen kumen tzu der zitzung."

Subject: Yidl Mitn Fidl lyrics

I perform Yidl Mitn Fidl very often in concerts.  Here are the lyrics:

Iber felder vegn, oyf a vogn hey
Mit zun un vint un regn, forn klezmer tsvey
A khidesh, oy, a khidesh, zog ver zenen zey?

Yidl mitn fidl, Arye mitn bas
Dos lebn iz a lidl, to vozhe zayn in kas.
Hey, Yidl, fidl, shmidl, hey, dos lebn iz a shpas.

A tsig shteyt oyf der lonke
Un meket troy'rik "me!"
Hey, du tsig, du shoyte, tro'rik zayn is fe!
Shoklt er dos berdl:  "Take, take fe!"

Yidl...

A foygl flit "gut morgn, gut morgn, a gut yor"
Der troyer un di zorgn tsu al de shvartse yor!
Dem vint a lakh in ponem, un Yidl, Yidl for!

Yidl....

Enjoy!

Subject: Love of Yiddish

Mathew Dailey's note evoked a very great response in all of us. Chana
Honig sent a very moving personal note directly to him.  When I read it I
found it so relvant and reflective of many of our feelings I received her
permission to forward it to the entire khevre. I herewith enclose it.

Arre Komar

    Just a note as a mendele subscriber to tell you that i cried when i
    read your email on mendele.  There was a time up to a few years ago
    in syracuse, when i thought i will keep my love for yiddish alive by
    singing the folk songs ...which i do...and there are hundreds of
    wonderful songs...as from no other folk (  for example lines like (
    lomir trinken far di sonim no r sog zay nit on)...lets even drink a
    health to our enemies...after all they are human beings too..but we
    wont nose the news too publicly, essentially is how i translate
    this). but i may be the last of a small group of human beings who
    honors the beauty of the destroed shtetlach of Europe...the life of
    my zayde and bubbe..honest, caring, hard working, God fearing...and
    bringing up each child well loved and trying hard to be a decent
    mentsch...  that world of Yiddishkeit vanished ...with  the
    HOlocaust..with the tremendous drive toward assimilation in to the
    world of blessed America who welcomed the pogrom driven ( my
    grandparents) to this blessed land.  but their descendants want to be
    like the Gentiles and blend in...perhaps the pain...perhaps the
    shames of the past are too much for so many. but your words stirred
    my heart so much. my own oldest son...a ph.d. and an md.  has acted
    so ashamed when i used a yiddish word in conversation...he doen's
    mind of course if i talk at length in French( my second language)
    he believes that it would be better if everyone became
    gentiles...then there would be no more troubles. The shame that some
    Jews feel about Yiddish breaks my heart..though i dearly love my
    child so much... where does this shame come from.. ich vays nit...
    although I am a licensed psychologist!  maybe too many centuries of
    antisemitism that modern people want to flee from. . The horror that
    hitler really has won..wiped out yiddishkeit...stayed with me until
    really the past few years..now , reading mendele every day...i take
    so much joy from this new e-mail mishpoche -  of all the
    mendelniks... but your understanding of this issue of the yiddish
    people being alive in the flavor of mamaloshen...that splendid
    statement touched my heart.  a hartsikn dank fun a bobe vos hot gehat
    azoy fil frayd tsu layzn deyn brif!.
