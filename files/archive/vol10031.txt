Subject: Beyndlakh & Assorted Witchcraft

I wish to add to Lucas Bruyn's engaging contribution by offering the quote
from Einhorn's Volkovysk Yizkor Book which I am translating into English:

Vol I Page 93, where the various melamdim in town are recalled:

Shimon Adah's ("Shimon der Melamed") -- "Mitn Beyndl." Er iz geven bavust
als a mumkheh optzushprekhn an ayin-horeh mit aza min beyndl vos er hot
gehat.

Before we dismiss all of these carryings-on, let us recall that Pasteur's
Germ Theory of Disease is contemporaneous with the 1870's. Before science
was able to directly link certain types of maladies to the wee beasties
about us, all manner of appeals to occult forces seemed perfectly
reasonable.

Subject: Glikl fun Hamlen

Several people have written in about the volume on Glikl which is part of
the Argentine-published YIVO library.  This seems to be a modernization of
Glikl.  Where could one obtain at least a sampling of the text in her
original Yiddish?  How much modernization was done for the YIVO volume
(orthography? some changes in meaning? etc.)

Subject: Kant in Yiddish?

The Guardian newspaper in Britain is today carrying the first of two
extracts from Norman Finkelstein's controversial book "The Holocaust
industry".

Finkelstein quotes Elie Wiesel, who reminisces that he read Kant's "Critique
of Pure Reason" in Yiddish, soon after he was liberated from Buchenwald.
Finkelstein claims this is a "preposterous statement", as, according to him,
Kant's work was never translated into Yiddish.

Is Finkelstein right? I know that Plato, Nietsche, and many other
philosophers were translated into Yiddish, but was Kant?

Subject: Kant in Yiddish

Norman Finkelstein's assertion that reading "The Critique of Pure Reason" in
Yiddish is a "preposterous statement" may serve as a good example of his
"scholarship". I did not read Finkelstein's books (the pages I saw made me
nauseous), but somehow I beleive that this is not the only example. This
particular Finkelstein innuendo is directed not only against Wiesel, but
also against Yiddish culture (reading Kant in Yiddish is not just a mistake
or a lie, it's a "preposterous statement"; apparently, the very idea sounds
absurd to Finkelstein).

Of course Kant was translated into Yiddish. In 1945, Wiesel could have read,
for example, "Kant's etik" (Varshe: Farlag Etik, 1929. 66 p. Oysgekliben
durkh N. Sheynberg). Although this edition contains extensive excerpts from
"The Critique of _Practical_ Reason", the book's existence takes complete
care of the "preposterousness". And Finkelstein's effort to discredit a
memoirist, because after fifty years he did not remember which one of Kant's
Critiques he had read, illustrates the quality of the polemic.

There are many other books in Yiddish that treat at length Kantian philosophy 
(including "The Critique of Pure Reason"), contain quotes and extracts from
Kant's works, and could have been available to Wiesel in 1945. An incomplete
list includes:

Karl Kautsky, Etik un di materialistishe oyfasung fun der geshikhte (Nyu
York: Di Heym, 1919. The entire Chapter 3 discusses Kant's views).

Friedrich Engels, Ludvig Feyerbakh un der sof fun der klasisher Daytshisher
filosofie (Moskve: Der Emes, 1940. There was also another translation:
Ludvig Feyerbakh un der oysloz fun der klasisher Daytshlandisher filosofie,
Nyu York: Ikuf, 1943)

K. Gutboym, Artur Shopenhoyer: zayn lebn un filosofie (Varshe: A. Gitlin,
1922).

Herbert Spencer, Di ershte prinzipn: a sistem fun sintetisher filosofie
(Vilna: YIVO, 1937)

Max Schatz, Fun roym tsu tsayt: gedanken tsu a kulturfilozofye (Rige:
Arbeterheym, 1922)

Jacob Bobinsky, Shleymes un Kants derkentenish-teorye (and other essays
published in the early 1940s in "Yidishe shriften")

The bottom line is simple: Finkelstein's rant on Wiesel's alleged lie about
reading Kant in Yiddish isn't worth much. However, his "discovery" was put
to good use by various Holocaust deniers, including notorious Bradley Smith,
who repeated it in his "debate on the Holocaust" ads in college newspapers.
Now Finkelstein must be thrilled that in addition to Hunter College and New
York University, where he teaches, students at Emporia State, Boise State,
and University of Maine at Orono were also exposed to his eye-opening
revelations. While Smith is more of a clinical case (unfortunately not
recognized as such by some student newspaper editors), Finkelstein's
affiliations add undue legitimacy to really preposterous claims of his own.

Subject: "dalfen" again

In Mendele 10.025 (July 2, 2000) I posted a question concerning the
etymology and the spelling of yidd. "dalfen" 'pauper, beggar'. I have had
quite a bit of correspondence since then and I would like to put the thing
to rest now. After all, I am a syntactician and not an etymologist. I only
wanted to help my colleagues of the new etymological dictionary of Dutch to
improve just one entry. Furthermore I have come to the conclusion that there
may be a solution in terms of the name "Dalfo:n" which also involves the
Hebrew root DLP 'to leak, to drip, to cry, etc.'.

(Thanks to Shlomo Berger, Lucas Bruyn, Gilad Gevaryahu, Neil Jacobs, Jan
Jonk, Jean Lowenstamm and Meyer Wolf for their contributions.)

THE PROBLEM AGAIN: "Dalfen", which is spelled <dlpwn>, is usually derived
from "Dalfo:n" (spelled <dlpwn>), the name of one of the sons of Haman in
the book of Esther. However, the relationship between "dalfen" and "Dalfo:n"
is very unclear and the plural is "dalfonim", as if the word derives from a
Hebrew etymon "dalfa:n" (from the root DLP 'to leak, etc.'?). Cf. in this
context "evyen" (< hebr. "'evyo:n"), which has the plural "evyoynim". Yet,
it cannot be excluded that "dalfen" with its CaCCen structure derives from
"Dalfo:n" and has been adapted to words like "lamden" with their plurals in
"-onim".

In the mean time I know that the spelling <dlpwn>, which relates "dalfen" to
"Dalfo:n", is quite old and certainly predates the modern etymology, which
goes back to Tendlau (19th century): Meyer Wolf could refer me to a West
Yiddish text from 1627, a dispute between a rich man and a poor man, where
"dalfen" is spelled <dlpwn>.

Yet this does not solve the problem, for it is certainly possible to say
"poor Dalfen [= Dalfo:n]" -- because of Dalfo:n's unhappy fate -- but
Dalfo:n does not seem to be a symbol or an example of poverty. So if
"dalfen" derives from "Dalfo:n" we are still in need of an explanation.

Furthermore note that my hunch to derive "dalfen" from a Hebrew word
"dalfa:n"  probably has to be given up since there is no Hebrew evidence to
support it (yet). In the Modern Hebrew period we do find "dalfo:n" 'pauper'
and "dalfa:n" (!) 'beggar' but these clearly are loans from Yiddish. On the
other hand Jean Lowenstamm informs me that he "heard ["dalfen"] used in
reference to someone who is chronically incapable of retaining wealth, like
someone who would try to retain water in his hands with outspread fingers.
Litterally a "dripper", a "leaker"." [message of July 3, 2000] Yet, this may
be a case of semantic specialization, because the usual meaning of "dalfen"
seems to be 'pauper, beggar'.

INTERMEZZO: Note that the name "Dalfo:n" should be Indo-Iranian but looks
surprisingly Semitic, unlike the names of his nine (Persian) brothers. So it
cannot be excluded that <dlpwn> originally stood for something like
"Dalpawan / Dalfawan" or "Dalpuan / Dalfuan".

Now, whether "Dalfo:n" is original or derivative, Baumgartner et al.'s
dictionary of Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic interprets it as a Semitic name,
suggesting an interpretation like 'sleepless' (akkadian "Dulluppu") or
connections with arabic "dalu:f" 'quick eagle' or "dalifa" 'to have a small
nose'.

However, in my view one could also formally analyze the 'Persian' name
"Dalfo:n" as a Mishnaic Hebrew diminutive "dalf-o:n" 'drop-let' related to
mishn.hebr. "delef" 'drippings' (acc. to Tsanin's Hebrew-Yiddish dictionary
also 'regn-tropn'). But note that this word does not seem to be attested, so
that my Hebrew 'folk etymology' of this Persian name is purely formal in
nature.

A SUGGESTION: This folk-etymological speculation of mine has some relevance
in view of the following suggestion by Meyer Wolf [message of July 7, 2000]:

   "What is the source and history of the word TROPF 'Lump; armes Wesen'?
   I'm wondering if dalfen < DLP might have started out as a secret language
   substitute for Tropf."

By way of an explication: the German word "Tropf, which i.a. means
'simpleton, dumbo; poor being', resembles germ. "Tropfen" 'drop(let)', which
is related to the German verbs "tropfen", "triefen" and "traeufeln", which
describe various aspects of 'to drip / drop'. [Related words are older germ.
"Tropf / Dachtropf" '(roof's) gutter' and modern germ. "Tropf" '(medical)
drip'.]

SOME EXTRA FACTS: Both germ. "Tropfen" 'drop(let)' and germ. "Tropf"
'simpleton, dumbo; poor being' derive from middle high german "tropfe". Or
to put it differently, mhg. "tropfe" was ambiguous between 'drop(let)' (its
basic meaning) and 'simpleton, etc.'. These two meanings were formally
distinguished in Early New High German: "Tropfen" vs. "Tropf". Something
similar happened in Yiddish: "tropn" 'drop(let)' vs. "trop" 'fool'.

Furthermore, the big Grimm dictionary of German notes that the mhg. and
early nhg. diminutive "tropfel" '(lit.) droplet' could also be applied to
persons and -- more importantly -- that "Tropf" with the reading 'poor
being, pathetic person' preferably combines with "arm" 'poor' (i.e. "armer
Tropf" 'poor TROPF') and was often said of people living in poverty.

Therefore, Meyer Wolf's suggestion seems to me to be on the right track.

A PROPOSAL: I would like to suggest that yidd. "dalfen" arose through a pun.

Consider the following:

Any speaker of Early Yiddish or Middle High German knew that "tropfe /
tropfel" applied to a person literally meant 'drop(let)'. Some of them
furthermore knew that "Dalfo:n" could be formally analyzed as if it were a
Hebrew word "dalf-o:n" 'drop-let'. Or to put it differently: some knew that
there was a formal similarity between "armer tropfe / armes tropfel" ('poor
TROPFE(L)') on the one hand and "armer Dalfen" ('poor Dalfo:n') on the other
hand.

So such speakers could substitute "Dalfen" for "tropfe(l)" when applied to
persons, or to put it differently: the name "Dalfen" could take over the
meaning of "tropfe(l)" as applied to persons, thereby creating a new common
noun "dalfen", which necessarily had to be written as <dlpwn>.

Through semantic specialization this new word "dalfen" 'poor being, pathetic
person, (droplet)' could acquire new meanings: 'pauper, beggar'. And once
the connection with "Dalfen" (= Dalfo:n) was broken "dalfen" 'pauper,
beggar' could acquire a new plural in "-onim" on account of its similarity
with words of the CaCC-en class.

I am not particularly fond of etymologies of this level of complexity but
the above seems to be reasonable. However if it is wrong, I am willing to
take all the blame for it.

Subject: Introduction and advice for learning Yiddish

I am a middle aged Jewish doctor married to a former Jesuit. I am providing
health care services to an Aboriginal community on a small island off the
coast of British Columbia. Needless to say there is no yiddishkeit within
about 500 miles other than the bagels and challah that I make out of
desperation. I want to learn the language of my cultural heritage. I can
read Hebrew haltingly but it is phonetic only, I don't know what I am
reading. I would love some suggestions about what would be available wither
by distance education or home study. I am obviously not able to travel to
study.

Thank you for your time.

Subject: Introduction

I'm finishing up my doctorate in English at Johns Hopkins and will be
leaving in a couple of weeks for the haimishe town of Omaha where I'll be
teaching Restoration and 18th c. Lit. at the University of Nebraska at
Omaha.  My interest in Yiddish is only a few years old, and I don't feel
nearly fluent.  I've worked my way through _College Yiddish_ and have gamely
tried translations, from the Forverts to Sutzkeyver and have occasional
conversations with my mother.  But I'm just getting started.  I have already
learned much from Mendele and hope to learn more, as well as attend one of
the summer sessions at YIVO or Amherst in the not-too-distant future.

A shaynem dank for your good offices!
