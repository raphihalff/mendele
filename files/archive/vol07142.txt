Subject: Homage to Dorothy Bilik

Ikh hob bakumen azoy fil tayere, hartsike brivelekh, zikhroynes fun Dvosyen,
alts tsulib dos vos ikh hob geshribn di por verter vegn ir do, oyf Mendele. 

When I received this poem from/by Merril Leffler, his imagination and artistry
invoked all the Muses for me, and finally released my tears for her. He wrote
it four years ago for her retirement from the University of Maryland where he
still teaches. 

He gladly allowed me to share it with all of you. It is an enriching gift to
us all.

Homage
    To Dorothy Bilik, known in Yiddish circles as Dvosye

When I think of Dorothy
I think of Brooklyn. I think
Of Flatbush, of Pitkin Avenue, of Eastern Parkway
And the Botanical Gardens, of the Egyptian mummies
That inhabit the Brooklyn Museum. When I think
Of Dorothy, I think Yiddish.
I think of tayerinke, of ich hob dir in drerd
And nisht haynt gedakht and gezinterheyt.
When I think of Dorothy
I think of Brooklyn College, of Samuel Gompers
And the CIO and the International.
The New Deal and Whittaker Chambers
And Alger Hiss.
    I think of Proust
Stepping, tentatively, off the IRT
At Church Avenue, looking both ways, puzzled,
It is the heat of summer and he is perspiring terribly.
Dorothy takes him by the hand
and climbing into the light of her room
Proust falls upon the couch exhausted.
"Dvosye," he can barely whisper, "a bisl tea, cherie,
Avec limon. Deux sucre, and the rugelakh.
A Sheynem dank. Yes. Yes. I can taste
The memories. They come like the heart's flood
Drowning me exquisitely." Ah!

When I think of Dorothy, I think of
Wordsworth and Coleridge sitting in Grasmere
Over a plate of steaming matzo bray. Coleridge
Can hardly contain himself. He is fevered
And in love, once more. "Dvosye," he says,
"Ikh hob a poeme far dir."
          Halt oyf zelbst-umtsutroy
           Un gib mir a bisl mithilf.
           Du bist a bafligelte Nimfe,
           Mayn tsoyber. Mayn likht.

"What means this Yiddish," asks Wordsworth, puzzled 
Looking as always to Coleridge for explication:

         Suspend your disbelief
         And give me some relief
         You are a winged sprite -
          My Ariel. My light

When I think of Dorothy, I think
Of Mendele and Peretz and Sholem Aleichem,
Of Moyshe Kulbak and Itzik Manger
Sitting and shouting at each other, eating blintzes
And sour cream and carp and herring, black bread
And olives and cheeses. They agree only on Dvosye.

At the next table Saul and Isaac Rosenfeld,
Malamud and Roth cannot make up their minds.
Kashe varnishkes or kishke? Latkes or brisket?
Egg beaters, they settle for. Oy  gevalt, says Roth
In New Jersey Jewish, is there a life without cholesterol -
Is this now where vee may perhaps to begin - or end?

Bashevis comes shuffling from the kitchen with a bowl
Of steamed carrots and peas - a cheer goes up
He bows and winks at his Dvosye dear
Who is sitting now with GIYckel
And Kafka reading the Jewish Encyclopedia
>From the beginning.

When I think of Dorothy, I think of the Klezmorim
Playing far into the night, the music slow at first,
And then the clarinet kicks in and faster now
And faster. Dorothy, her skirts whirling, wildly
Beyond time, as though there were no air to resist her
As though you truly could not tell the dancer
>From the dance, as though Dorothy took dominion
Here and there, as though she was rising now
Into my heart, her wings opening like Ariels
Aloft in flight. 0 brave new world. How bright.
How bright.

Subject: Help with Yiddish cataloging

[forwarded by Nobukatsu Minoura <nobum@gol.com>]

Here at the University of Texas at San Antonio's John Peace Library, we
perform cataloging for the Institute of Texas Cultures (ITC).  The ITC has a
large collection of books in Yiddish which have not been cataloged because we
lack the linguistic expertise to properly process the materials. 

A kind volunteer transliterated some of the titles and authors into roman
script years ago before his death, but most titles remain untransliterated. 
We do know from this gentleman's work that many of these materials will
require original cataloging. 

I was wondering:

1)  Might there by any librarians lurking on this list who would know of an
agency we might outsource the cataloging of these materials to other than
OCLC? 

2)  Are there any individuals from this list in the San Antonio area
possessing Yiddish language skills who might be interested in helping us with
these materials?

Subject: An Italian

It seems we have almost all comnbinations of vowels in the childhood memories
of the word/s for an Italian. Mom was a Bialystoker, actually a little town
nearby known as Tiktin. She referred to an Italian male as a TALYENER and for
a woman she dropped the /r/. I do not recall her using it in any manner as a
derogatory term. 

As was mentioned previously, when there were many of a certain nationality in
the area, the term for the nationality was used. In referring to the general
non-Jewish population, mom used the term goy in the connotation of a
non-believer.

Subject: italaynerkes

My mother was a New York dressmaker (ILGWU) for many years. She worked mostly
with Jewish and Italian women in many different shops between the early 1920's
and the mid 1950's. Her term of art was 'italaynerke' with an 's' added to
form the plural. It was not, in and of itself, a pejorative.

Subject: kibitz, cholent, and endearments

I so enjoyed the post of the Editor, I assume Iosif Vaisman, on correct
Yiddish endearment endings (-enyu, -ele, etc.). What about -inko. I have a
feeling it's from what was once Bohemia or Moravia.

I also have been searching for the derivation of kibitz, and the Weinreich
dictionary gave me only kibitz.  Webster's New World Dictionary tells me that
kibbitzer is Yiddish, derived from the colloquial German kiebitz, originally a
plover of echoic origin, but currently used in describing someone who's
meddlesome, onlooker at a card game, etc. 

Finally, where does the word tcholent come from (that shabes dish) and how is
it spelled? 

A hartstigen dank!

Subject: yiddish film actor max bozyk

I am trying to get biographical and general information on the American career
of Polish-Yiddish film actor Max Bozyk. Bozyk (Bozhyk) was in many Yiddish
films made in Poland from Yidl mitn fidl (1936) on, until the outbreak of the
war.  How did he get to America after the war, and what was his acting career
like after he got there? -- New York -- elswhere?  Family -- offspring.  Death
-- where - when?

Subject: Jack the Ripper case

I wonder whether I may request your assistance in a matter concerning Yiddish. 
I am doing some research on one aspect of the East End murders of 1888, also
known as the Jack the Ripper murders.  As you are no doubt aware, the
population of the East End at that time was made up mainly by foreign
immigrants.  A large proportion of these were Eastern European Jews.  As a
result, Jews featured among the suspects, the witnesses and the concerned
citizens - though not among the victims - in the Ripper case.  One of the
victims was actually found lying outside a socialist club which published a
Yiddish-language newspaper.  Books of interest include Chaim Bermant's East
End and William Fishman's East End 1888.  As is known, the Ripper was never
caught.  Moreover, he never left any clues as to who he was.  Students of the
case, however, have grasped at anything resembling a clue.  Such is the case
of a grafito found in an entranceway, which many assumed had been left by the
killer. The grafito read: 

The Juwes are not the men that will be blamed for nothing.

The grafito was erased by order of the Commissioner of Police, who feared
antisemitic feelings.  This action was welcomed by the Jewish community, in
particular by Chief Rabbi Dr Hermann Adler. 

Although there is no evidence that the killer actually wrote it, the grafito
has been the subject of speculation ever since. 

The purpose of my research is to determine whether the words, which are not
correct English, make grammatical and syntactic sense in any other language if
translated literally into it.  Up to now, I have gathered translations of the
sentence into French, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, Polish and
Spanish without finding among them the 'original' language.  Frankly, I am not
sure I shall find it, but of itself this will prove something or, at least,
provide some material for an article. 

After such a long introduction, you may have guessed that my request is for a
literal translation of the above sentence into Yiddish.  Could you kindly
oblige?  If at all possible, I would appreciate it if you could use both
Hebrew characters and a transliteration into Roman characters, since I don't
have Hebrew.  I hope this is not much of an imposition. I would be grateful
indeed for your assistance.
