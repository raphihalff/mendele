Subject: Introduction and comments on tsatskele

I would like to introduce myself.  I am Edith Cohen and I live in
Seattle, Washington.  I used to be a Research Technologist at the
University of Washington where I subscribed to a Yiddish newsletter much
like Mendele but was out of Canada and was e-mailed by David Sherman.  I
no longer work at the UW and was laid off several years ago which
prompted my return to school to change careers.  I currently am a
student at Bellevue Community College in their Interior Design program.
I still have one more year until I finish.  I am a New Yorker by birth
and went to a Jewish Day School which was closely related to the the
Farband.  My parents were active in that.

I read with a smile all the comments on tsatskele. If my memory serves
me correctly, a tsatskele was a young woman/teenager who was a real
handful for her parents to control.  She had  a mind of her own and was
rather demanding.  (The other definition of tsatskele I consider to be
incorrect.)  We used the term chatchke to mean a souvenir or other piece
of stuff that was not necessary, but just hung around the house.  This
was something that really should have ended up a in a used item store so
that is did not clutter up your own home. I guess this could also be
considered to be a bauble of some kind.

Thanks for so much enjoyment and please forgive my spelling. I"m quite
new to using the electronic mail system, and I do not know how to access
a spellchecker.

Subject: Shvitzer

I was asked the following by a friend:

     Do you have any idea where Hebrew got the verb leHashvitz from? Is
     it from Switzerland, somehow? because I understand "schwitzen" does
     occur in Yiddish, but that, like in German, has nothing to do with
     showing off (unless by "showing off" you mean "reflecting light").

and I answered...

Lehashvitz does actually comes from Yiddish, and means to brag. The
funny thing is that it has entered Hebrew both in its original form (as
lehashvitz, shvitzer, etc.), and in translation (yaz'an, and yaz'anut,
meaning the same as shvitzer!!!!) So you're right about the Yiddish
connection.

I don't know an alternative link between sweating and bragging but the
one which you propose, but perhaps Yiddish shvitzer is linked to German
Schwaetzer, which means chatterer, blatherer...

Could anyone confirm this or give me an alternative etymology?

Subject: Mishteyns gezogt

Noyekh is quoted in Philologos in  the Forward of July 5 as stating,
"Mishteyns gezogt"...is an ironic, even sarcastic signal that what has
gone before is more pathetic than imposing."

In the Forward of June 28, Masha Leon, reporting from the Booksellers
Convention in Chicago bemoans the cancellations of lectures by Jane
Fonda, Elie Wiesel, and Fergie (her order of billing, not mine), then
adds, "Among the hundreds of autographing legitimate and meshteins
gezogt (i.e., proto-) celebrities were Cindy Crawford,...Ross
Perot,...Spider Man, and Art Buchwald."

As if we didn't know that Noyekh knows from whence he speaks.

Subject: Al tiro avdi yakov

Many, many thanks to those Mendelyaner who have helped me with this
project, especially Robert Rothstein. What I thought was a hopelessly
obscure remnant of a vanished past turned out to be the front door to a
wealth of knowledge and more to explore, both in books and the living
memory of those who have helped me.

My sincerest thanks,

Bernard S. Greenberg

     There are some who call Yiddish a dead language, but so was Hebrew
     called for two thousand years.  It has been revived in our time in
     a most remarkable, almost miraculous way.  Aramaic was certainly a
     dead language for centuries, but then it brought to light the
     Zohar, a work of mysticism of sublime value.  It is a fact that the
     classics of Yiddish literature are also the classics of the modern
     Hebrew literature.  Yidish has not yet said its last word.  It was
     the tongue of martyrs and saints, of dreamers and Kabbalists- rich
     in humor and in memories that mankind may never forget.  In a
     figurative way, Yiddish is the wize and humble language of us all,
     the idiom of frightened and hopeful humanity.

The above are the concluding words from, Isaac Bashevis Singer, _Nobel
Lecture_, Farrar Straus Giroux, New York which I checked out from the
University of Maryland Library.  It is a small book, 7 1/2" x 5" and
contains both the Yiddish and English text of the lecture plus chapters;
Nobel Prize Citation, Why I write for Children, and The Work of Isaac
Bashevis Singer by Professor Lars Gyllensten.

You're probaby familiar with Singer's comments at an interview where he
said that Idish was long from dead but was "a bisl krank." (a little
sick).

Thank you Zellig Bach, Zachary Baker, Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan, Morrie
Feller, Ellen Prince, Leybl Botvinik, and others for the recent
discussion of Ruth Wisse's article.
