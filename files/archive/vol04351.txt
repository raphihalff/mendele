Subject: Yiddish lullabies

The following was received at another list. I thought Mendele folks would
be able to help Sam out. I can't think of a more effective way to pass
Yiddish on to the next generation than by starting out in the cradle.

Neil Baker

I am about to become the papa of a little girl, and I want to sing her
Yiddish Lullabies, especially, the lovely Rozhinkes mit Mandlen (Raisins
and Almonds). However, I can't seem to find a songbook which contains the
words and music for this song, or other Yiddish lullabies or other
Yiddish songs.  Does anyone know of a songbook which contains this song
(at least) and other Yiddish songs (ideally).

I was first exposed to these songs from records of the Klezmer
Conservatory Band, so maybe Klezmer songbooks would do.

Subject: Paul Robeson

On our local PBS radio WETA FM station during the first week in March
Paul Robeson Jr. told of a 1949 Moscow concert where Robeson Sr. sang
"Zog nit keynmol" defiantly. Earlier he had insisted on meeting with
Itsik Feffer who had,of course, by that time been imprisoned at
Lubianka.There was a recognition through gestures by both that all was up
with Feffer. Robeson's rendition of the Yiddish partisan song drew a
tumultuous response from the audience which can be heard on this
hitherto unreleased archival disc which will be issued by  Phoenix or
"Foenix" records, a California company.

Subject: Diminutives of names

A recent post in mail.jewish discussed the existence of a name yisroel
isser, with isser being a variant of the name yisroel. If true, this is
an additional example to the samples provided by Dovid Braun and others.
I append the original post in mail.jewish.

Subject: The Name "Issur"

Ben Rothke asks in V18#59 for the origin of the Yiddish name "Issur".
That name is really "Isser" and is derived from Yisro'el.  A Yiddish
version of Yisro'el is Isserl which *sounds* like a diminutive but of
course is *not*.  A hypercorrectism leads to the dropping of the final
lamed and a new name is born.

The name is often used together with Yisro'el: Yisro'el Isser.  The
R'mo's last name was Isserles = son of Isser.

No connection with 'issur [= Hebrew "prohibition"].

Subject: Dina Abramowicz and the Vilna ghetto library

In my haste to compose and send out my last posting, on the list of rules
and regulations for use of the Vilna ghetto library (found among the
documents received at YIVO last week, from Lithuania), I inadvertently
neglected to mention that my colleague and predecessor as Head Librarian
of YIVO, Dina Abramowicz, worked in the Vilna ghetto library -- and is
probably the only surviving member of the ghetto library's staff.  She
wrote about her experiences in the Vilna ghetto library in the 1950
collection "Lite" (cols. 1671-1678).  Regarding the rules and
regulations, she has a number of interesting observations, which I hope
to share at a later date.

Subject: Rotwelsh

A friend of mine is working on a project on Jewish gangsters and in her
travels has come across some references to rotwelsh (sp?) a thieves'
language in use from the 14th to the 19th centuries which consisted,
reputedly, of 80% Yiddish words.   Could any mendeleyaner enlighten her
further or suggest other sources?
