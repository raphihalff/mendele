Subject: new subscriber introduction

I am a researcher at the Universiteit van Amsterdam, department for
Jewish studies. I am actually writing my Ph.D. thesis on Yiddish
chronicles written in the 17th and 18th century in Holland, like
Menachem Man ben Shlomo Amelander's Sheyris Yisroel.

Yours sincerely,
Bart Wallet

Subject: Peruvian

The recent enquiry from Veronica Belling about the origin of the term
"Peruvian", widely used in South Africa as a pejorative to describe
Yiddish-speaking immigrants from Eastern Europe, is timely and
important. The organ of this word has long been a mystery, and all
explanations offered to date are unsatisfactory. While I look forward
to hearing from other correspondents on this subject, my own
contribution here seeks to discredit some of the currently received
explanations.  Bradford's _Dictionary of South African English_ (OUP)
has been responsible for putting into circulation the conception that
the word "Peruvian" derives from an acronym for "Polish and Russian
Union", supposedly a club that existed in Kimberley during the days of
the diamond rush there. No convincing evidence is adduced for this
assumption, either by Bradford or anyone else. Against accepting this
fantasy, one should consider how unlikely it would have been for
Yiddish-speaking immigrants, new to South Africa at the end of the
nineteenth century, to have formed themselves into a "Union" of the
kind envisaged, which would seem to be imagined as some kind of British
Colonial Club for gentlemen of leisure.  It seems also most unlikely
that the word has any connection with South America in general, or Peru
in particular, since there is no recorded historical connection
whatever between South America and South Africa at the time of the
diamond and gold rushes.There is no historical or linguistic evidence
of any persuasive kind for these proposed etymologies, so the sooner
they are both discredited, and a more reasonable basis for the origin
of this unusual usage is proposed -- with hard evidence to support the
assertion -- the more helpful it will be for those of us working on
South African Yiddish.

Call for papers for a scholarly conference on the relationship of the
synagogue (and its bimah) and the Yiddish theater (bine) in the 19th
and 20th centuries. Did the synagogue become more formal with the
emergence of Jewish theater?  What were the consequences for
congregational intimacy? How did artistic expression reflect cultural
preferences of the time? Did the roles of cantors change with the
advent of stars and operatic performers? How have synagogue rituals
shaped Jewish theater? What did the fact that many performers were
cantors mean for the Yiddish stage? Were there shifts with respect to
depictions of Jewish religious life? How was Jewish identity expressed?  
How did the preferences of congregants and audiences shape the action
on stage?

YIVO to Open New Exhibition on the Jewish Labor Bund in Interwar Poland 

"Here and Now: The Vision of the Jewish Labor Bund in Interwar Poland"

On October 28 the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, home of the
renowned Bund Archives, which constitutes one of the largest, richest
and most important sources of documentation on the history of the
Jewish socialist movement, will present a new exhibition on the
occasion of the 105th anniversary of the Jewish Labor Bund.

The Bund, a political party whose history on Polish soil begins in
1918, with the establishment of the Polish Republic, fought against the
rise of anti-Semitism, and campaigned vigorously for fair employment
practices for Jews and for decent working conditions. The Bund
contributed to the flowering of the Yiddish language by encouraging the
founding of Yiddish schools and cultural organizations and by promoting
Yiddish literature and theater. By the eve of the war, the Bund had
become one of the most popular Jewish parties, winning a large portion
of the Jewish vote in local elections. During the Holocaust the Bund
went underground, fought in the resistance against the Nazis and
participated heroically in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising.

The new exhibition highlights the unique contributions of the Bund in
interwar Poland to Jewish educational and cultural life and showcases
its support of the Jewish working class and its struggle against the
rise of violent and government endorsed anti-Semitism in the years
before the outbreak of World War II.

The new exhibition will display documents, posters, photographs,
newspapers and books from the YIVO collections. and will be open for
viewing in the YIVO Exhibition Gallery, Monday through Thursday, 9:30
to 5:00, in the Center for Jewish History, 15 West 16th Street in
Manhattan. It will run for two months from October 29 until December
31.

For questions about "Here and Now: The Vision of the Jewish Labor Bund
in Interwar Poland" please contact YIVO at 212-294-6143.

Subject: Russian born, American artist - Samuel Rothbort (1882-1971)

Our family is delighted to welcome you the opportunity to view a
magnificent non commercial on-line museum based on the life and
accomplishments of Russian born - American Artist, Samuel Rothbort
(1882 - 1971).

Samuel Rothbort was a self taught Impressionist who worked in oil,
watercolor, pen & ink, as well as sculpture out of wood and stone.

 In the 1930's and 1940's he had painted from memory hundreds of works
based on his childhood experiences of late 19th century shtetl life in
Eastern Europe. His work served as research material for the original
production of Jerome Robbins, Fiddler on The Roof.

The web site address is:  www.samuelrothbort.com (Go to the page
titled, "Memory Paintings")

We welcome your comments and suggestions.

Sincerely,
David Rosen

Subject: Eyns, eyns, eyns

The song "Eyns, eyns eyns" that Mitya Farber probably heard [12.005] is
a wedding song addressed to the Klezmers because after every two verses
there is a refreyn:

zing zhe unter Berl,
tantz zhe unter, Smerl,
shpil zhe unter, Khaim
ale balalaykes, tra la la la, tra la la la......
bekhol makom she hu...

The song itself refers to God as the one who mezaveg, mezaveg zivugim
bekhol makom she hu, which better comes along with the song's content.

eyns, eyns, eyns, ver veyst vos is eyns?
eyn is der koydesh borukh hu,
vos er mezaveg, mezaveg zivugim
bekhol makom she hu  x2

Tsvey.....
tsvey zaynen khosn-kale tsulib zey tantzn ale,
eyn....

Dray......
Dray zaynen di klezmorim vos mesameyakh zkeynim un orem.....

Fir.....
Fir zaynen di mekhutonim vos zey hobm di muzmonim.....

The melody could be found on the CD "Mazl un Shlimazl" by German singer
Daniel Kempin and violinist Dmitry Reznik (who is originally from
Russia).

Subject: alphabet song 

Adam Levitin on July 11 in Mendele #12.0005 asked about an alphabet
song and presented two raggedy quotes. He is right on the point when he
said he suspects it stems from the Arbeter Ring.

It is a lovely, lively song to the tune of Do a Deer, a Female Deer; it
has proved very functional for teaching the aleph-beys for young and
old, and was written by Nat Zumoff of Philadelphia, a master Yiddish
teacher and talented writer of parodies, satiric songs, and
motivational lyrics to make a shenere un a besere velt a la the Arbeter
Ring.

Back in the 40's he was a group leader at Kinder Ring, the Arbeter Ring
Camp, and led many a successful program with his original wonderful
lyrics.

Today he is a Florida Yiddish troubador who who has boom-box and will
travel to share his worthy wares with many a condo or Yiddish
organizational group. My Yiddish Club always asks me to rehire him, and
calls him the Yidisher Maurice Chevalier.

der iker iz: Nat's kid brother, Barney Zumoff, is a Mendelist, and a
writer, translator, and word lover as well, and perhaps he can give us
all his brother's words to the Alphabet Song.

Subject: lid gezukht: zaftige karshn afn boym

I am trying bto find a poem I remember reading many years ago in which
the speaker addresses juicy cherries on a tree just out of his reach.  
Each verse begins:

[adjective] karshn afn boym.

baym sof, boygn zikh di tsvaygn tsu zayne lipn.
