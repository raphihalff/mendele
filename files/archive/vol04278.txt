Subject: Prakhes=stuffed cabbage?

A friend recalls that his mother, who came from a shtetl (Yikhlin?
Dzhikhlin?) near Lodz, referred to stuffed cabbage as _prakhes_.  Is this
term familiar to anyone on Mendele?

A sheynem dank,

Subject: Yiddish literature in English

I am teaching Yiddish literature in English translation this semester (as
I mentioned in a previous posting) for the first time.  I am eager to
hear from others who might have already had this experience or who have
been students in such a course.  I have already prepared much of the
course's direction/reading list/syllabus/etc.  But nothing is written in
stone....

Some questions/anxieties/curiosities of mine before the semester begins:

-How much of an introduction should I give the students (approximately 20
 undergraduates) about Yiddish language/culture at the very beginning of
 the course?

-How much "secondary" reading should I assign (ie., about the
 texts/authors, rather than just the lit. itself)?

-Should I encourage discussion of the texts moslty as "Yiddish
 literature" or should I encourage more free associative personal
 relating to each text just as a text? -To teach theory or not to teach
 theory? That is the question.

-Suggestions of films to show the class? "Hester Street"/"Tevye..."/?

-Are there stories/novel(la)s/poems you think I _must_ teach or die?

-Anything hideous you would avoid?

-Will my students like me?  Just kidding! :)

I'm interested in any opinions!

Subject: Learning Yiddish

I have just recently joined mendele and would like to solicit opinions on
a topic which I hope will be of interest to many of you.  I am a graduate
of the YIVO summer program unheyber level and I study gender and Jewish
radicalism in the US in the cultural studies department at the University
of Minnesota. I am writing an essay in which I need to articulate, "while
avoiding nostalgia and Jewish exceptionalism," how learning Yiddish can
be considered a political act. In addition to any thoughts on the matter,
I would also appreciate directions to written sources on this topic and
the related one of the current Yiddish "revival."  A sheynem dank,

Subject: Summer Yiddish Program at Columbia University

Burton Leiser inquired about summer programs that offer Yiddish language
instruction and/or courses about Yiddish culture.  I attended one such
program last summer at Columbia University, the YIVO Institute sponsored
Uriel Weinreich Summer Program in Yiddish Language, Literature and
Culture at Columbia University.

This program offers a six-week course in Beginning, Intermediate, or
Advanced Yiddish Language and Literature instruction with a faculty that
includes Dr. Mordkhe Shechter.  In addition, workshops are offered in a
variety of areas of Yiddish culture, such as folksong, dance (last year
with Michael Alpert), film, translation and theatre.  There are also
occasional lectures in Yiddish and English on a variety of topics and
weekend or evening excursions -- we took a road trip to the National
Yiddish Book Center in Amherst.

I highly recommend the program.  I attended because I am a vocalist who
sings Yiddish music professionally but always needed someome else to tell
me what I was singing about.  Now, after six weeks in the Beginner class
last summer, I speak, read, and write Yiddish at a high Intermediate
level and have continued my studies on my own.

For additional Information, contact Jeffrey Salant (Yankel) at YIVO at
(212)246-6080 (phone).  This year's dates for the program are June
26-August 4, 1995.

Subject: Yiddish in summer

For Berel Leiser:

The summer generally provides several Yiddish programs. There is one at
Columbia University, Bar Ilan in Israel, and the Oxford program. There
has been peculiar talk about Oxford recently, however. No one is sure
whether Oxford will have a program or not. There are also whisperings
about a program this summer in Brussels, but I've not heard a lot about
this.

Burton (Berel) Leiser:

You will undoubtedly get information from all corners of Mendele
about the Weinreich Yiddish Summer Program (at Columbia University)
and about summer study opportunities in Yiddish at the Oxford program.
I will therefore not elaborate on them--however, if you would like
info./addresses for the above please contact me directly.

The National Yiddish Book Center does offer weekend workshops and
programs that might interest you.  If you are not on their mailing
list I recommend it:  National Yiddish Book Center/48 Woodbridge St./
South Hadley/MA/01075/Phone:413-535-1303/FAX:413-535-1007.

Also, I recently learned of an annual summer program that sounds very
interesting.  I have been in touch with (and have seen last year's
program for) the "Charlotte Yiddish Institute at Wildacres".  This
is an award winning (1990 National JWB Award for Excellence in
Judaic Programming) 5 day program sponsored by tge Jewish Community
Center of Charlotte, NC.  The faculty on last year's program included:
Ruth Barlas, Zalman Mlotek, and Shoshana Ron.  "The Charlotte Yiddish
Institute is open to men and women dedicated to enhancing their knowledge
and use of the Yiddish language and culture in a stimulating heymish
environment."  A graduate student with whom I have worked here at
Brandeis attended the Institute last year and had good things to say
about it!  I have had only pleasant interactions/correspondence with
the Institute's representatives.  For info.: Beila Pransky, Coordinator/
Charlotte Yiddish Institute/The Jewish Community Center of Charlotte/

Subject: Zikh teyln vs tseteyln

Perhaps the distinction to be preserved is between _(di shutfim) teyln
zikh mitn revakh_ as against _tseteyln dem revakh (tsvishn di
shutfim)_

Subject: A Guide to Hebraic Words in Yiddish

A month or so back I received a wonderful matone from Steve Jacobson
of the University of Alaska, a copy of his _A Guide to the More Common
Hebraic Words in Yiddish_ (3rd ed.).  Steve asked me not to mention
it until he got back from Tahiti.  Loynt zikh take voynen in Alaska:
ven me ken eyns-tsvey-dray aribershpringen kayn Bali..

The guide is a compilation from various sources of "the words and phrases
from Aramaic, Greek and other languages which are used in the Talmud and
other texts from the same period". It comes in two sections.  The first
presents words as they are traditionally spelled, then phonetically
respelled, and finally translated into English.  The second section
(immensely useful for those with weak or no Hebrew) reverses the order
of things and arranges words first by their phonetic spelling, followed
by the traditional spelling and an English translation.

Is it useful?  Take an example from today's Mendele.  Mikhl writes about
_revakh_ and doesn't define it.  You turn to Harkavy or Weinreich for a
definition but, since it's a hebraic word, the spelling is non-phonetic
and you'll have a hell of a time finding it.  No longer!

Since Steve is not one to toot his own horn (er barimt zikh nisht) I have
volunteered to serve as press agent. The book is a gem.  It belongs on
every Mendelnik's desk.  The price, which includes postage, is $12 for US
residents and $17 for others.  The address is:

                Steven A. Jacobson
                P.O. Box 82849
                Fairbanks, AL 99708
                U.S.A.

Addendum: the Guide is self-published and is the only worthwhile example
of desktop publishing I've ever seen.  (That was yesteryear's hype.
Today it's "information" as in Mosaic and Netscape and the rest of that
tomfoolery.  Dear friends, if you have a civilized bathroom in your house
you have more available and useful information at your fingertips than
you'll _ever_ get from WWW.  Ober nisht dos bin ikh oysn.)  Steve's book
should be available in bookstores everywhere and toward that end deserves
to be published by a commercial or academic press.
