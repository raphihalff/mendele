Does anyone know when vaybertaytsh first appeared and if it was
originally used only for religious texts?

[Ref. 4.328]

Because of the recent computer [Kevin Mitnick] scandal , the Well had
to curtail activity and redo its security. This took me offline since the
beginning of this week. If you posted  amessage to me, please send it
again.

I believe I'm the only one in our list who is on the Well. It could
happen to you. :--)

Subject: NYU In Cracow

Barbara Krishenblatt-Gimblett suggested I contact you in regard to our
new summmer program "NYU in Cracow".

NYU in Cracow is a 5 week summer program on The Modern History and
Experience of Jews in Eastern Europe.  Both undergraduate and graduate
students can choose from a selection of courses that include Introduction
to Yiddish Folklore and Ethnography (taught by Barbara), East European
Government and Politics, Modern History of East European Jewry, The
Holocaust: Destruction of European Jewry, Language courses in Yiddish and
Polish, and others.

Besides Barbara, the faculty include Jan Gross, Christopher Browning,
Lucjan Dobroszycki, David Roskies, Piotr Wrobel, Steven Zipperstein,
David Engel, and Anthony Polonsky.

The program runs from July 3, - August 4, 1995. Four weeks are spent in
Cracow and there is a one week study tour of Jewish Galicia.  So far the
response to has been very positive and applications are starting to
arrive.

I would be pleased to send you more information about the program and
answer any questions you may have.

I look forward to hearing from you,

Jonathan Lipman

Subject: YIVO archives from Vilnius

I am glad to hear that YIVO archives from Vilnius are transferred to New
York. Although Vilna was the place where YIVO was established for last
five decades the New York branch had to replace it as the main office.
Unfortunately there are no resources in Lithuania to research the
archives and statements by previous governments that the YIVO archive is
a national treasure of Lithuania did not match the six people digging
among books and documents and trying to catalog them (only two of them
could understand Yiddish, I believe). Most of the books were uncatalogued
when I was in the "Book Palace" (an old monastery in downtown Vilnius)
several years ago. I hope YIVO finds the resources to research the
documents as soon as possible.

I remember finding among the papers full selections of pre-war
periodicals, various books, textbooks and documents. I hope all of it
gets transferred and becomes available for research.

Regarding the YIVO press release, I can say that both publications were
misidentified. "Respublika" is a New York Post type newspaper with
elements of National Enquirer. It's editor-in-chief suffers from a severe
case of zoological anti-Semitism. It is hardly a nationalist paper and
most of its statements could be ignored.

Lietuvos Aidas is a right wing newspaper and is definitely not communist.
Once more, I hope YIVO takes good care of the archives and some unknown
pages of history of the Jerusalem of Lithuania become available.

Subject: The YIVO archives

All who were witness to the reunion of the YIVO archive yesterday
will testify to how moving an event it was--no shortage of tears.
No less moving than the family reunion of survivors after five decades
of separation.

Congratulations to all who were instrumental in effecting it, beginning
with Sam Norich who began the process as Director of YIVO 5 (?) years
ago, and Allan Nadler, YIVO's research director today, who effected its
consummation, Chairman of YIVO's Board, Bruce Slovin and others --
including a number of prominent Lithuanians have also earned a share of
oylem habe. Yasher koyekh to all of them.

Subject: Returned YIVO archives

I read with great interest Zachary Baker's recent Mendele posting (4.335)
on the arrival of the YIVO archives that remained in Vilna after the war.

He alluded tantalizingly to the heated arguments aired in Lithuania about
whether or not to ship the archives to the US Jewish community, but
provided no details.  I wonder if he, or someone at YIVO,  could share
some of those with the Mendele community.

I'd assume that some arguments were economic (selling Judaica to Western
Jews brings hard currency); ethnic (denial or suppression of the
important role of Jews in Lithuania serves some internal needs);
religious, political, etc.  I'd love to hear more details, as undoubtedly
would others on Mendele.

Subject: Gikh

Anno mentioned that there was a cognate for gikh in a word "ga:". It
happens that in Dutch we may see a connection with "gauw". As in "niet zo
gauw!" (nisht azoy gikh).

If Ogden Nash had written Yiddish, he might have answered
Yude Rosof as follows:

_shnel iz swell, but gikher iz zikher_
