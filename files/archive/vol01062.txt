blessings and curses:

nisht bay dir/im/ir/... gedakht: when speaking of someone
else's misfortune dir/im/ir/... tsu lange yorn: when
comparing a living person with a dead one hob im/ir/... in
'duis': i think this may be 'dos', a euphemism; the
functional import was 'he/... can go to hell' a kholyere!:
pretty strong curse something like 'nise deroyf', after
someone sneezed a second time lang lebn: after a third
sneeze (we sneezed a lot) (there was also an obligatory
ear-pulling if someone sneezed while a dead person was being
discussed) oyf mayne sonims gezogt (why 'sonimS'?): when
speaking of one's misfortune

one english one that i'm sure is a translation of the
yiddish was: wear it and tear it well: for new clothes

other very very frequent english translations in my house
were:

        god willing (accompanying every verb in the future
        tense, unless it was bad, in which case one said
        'god forbid') you shouldn't know from it it
        shouldn't happen to a dog kiss me where the sun
        don't shine don't give me/him/... a canary (= evil
        eye) you/he/... should only bust he/... should rest
        in peace

and one nonlinguistic one was ritual spitting, three times, vocalized as 'poo
poo poo', accompanying 'kenahore'.

most of these were more frequent from women than men--this was attributed to
their greater superstitiousness (= stupidity, according to my father, he should
rest in peace...).

Subject: Farewells, Curses, Expletives

One of my aunts used to regale us with her effusive
farewells: e.g. "Geh gesunt erhade, fuhr gesunterhade, kimm
tserick gesunterhade."  Her brother-in-law, my uncle, who
was skeptical, used to mutter under his breath, "A vaytig in
pupick. He would also say "Zoll vachsten vee a tzibilla mitt
im kopf in drerd..."  He w ould refer to this aunt,
sometimes, as "A cholera."  When really irked he would say
"A cholera zoll dihr (or ihm or ihr) choppen."  A common
expletive, perhaps not quite a curse, is the simple:
"Chaser!"  A negative group designation: "Cha serim!"
"Cheye-a" or "Vildeh Cheye-a" I've heard used to refer to
anyone -- children, adolescents, adults, blacks, whites,
etc.  "Shtinkerki" is a deroga- tory character term for a
sloven, not quite a curse.  I remember my grandfather
uttering a curse so terrible that I only remember its
meaning not its words: the meaning was: he should die and
have no sons to mourn him. (Words are power- ful among
Jews).  Genug.  A gutten juhr!  Hershel
