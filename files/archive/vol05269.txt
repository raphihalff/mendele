Subject: Looking for klezmer citations

I am currently working on a paper investigating the relationship between
language and musical expression, and I would like to include a discussion of
Yiddish and its connection to klezmer music.  Indeed, any scholarly references
which speak to the connection between Yiddish and any sort of cultural
expression would be valuable.  Please contact me directly with any specific
references or general hints.

A sheynem dank,

Subject: Syllable onsets in Yiddish

I would like to hear some thoughts about syllable onsets in Yiddish in the
Loshn-Koydesh component, which involve the adjacency of two obstruents with
(paradigmatically, in Hebrew) a conflict in voicing.

I'll give a couple of examples, using the romanization and examples from Uriel
Weinreich's dictionary.

With an onset with (original, in Hebrew) voiced obstruent, followed by a
voiceless one, we get anticipatory DEVOICING, thus, [Note:  All these examples
involve loss of a "Hebrew" schwa.  However, our concern is the schwa-less
*Yiddish* form, with the consonant cluster.]

psure  'message, tidings'  ( < *bs-), psule 'virgin',  tkhak ( <* dkh-)
extremity, straits' (cf. dakhkes  'want'), ksise 'agony of death' (< *gs- ,
cf. goyses)

On the other hand, in Weinreich we generally find NO ANTICIPATORY VOICING
given; thus:

kdushe, not **gdushe  'saintliness', sdorim, not **zdorim  (plural of seyder),
pgam, not **bgam 'dent, blemish, flaw'.  Now, Weinreich does give [zgule]
'remedy, solution'  ( < *sg- ).

Observations about this from Mendele readers would be appreciated.  Naturally,
I am NOT talking here about the well-documented anticipatory voicing
assimilation in Northeastern Yiddish.  However, in reading the really fine
phonetic descriptions of Viler, Gutman, Prilutski, I find only mention of how
Central Yiddish (or, at least, non-Northeastern Yiddish varieties) lack the
anticipatory voicing assimilation.  What I am looking at is morpheme-internal
clusters.  Generally, these do show a tresolution of voicing conflict in, I
think, all Yiddish dialects.  Thus, even Central Yiddish has a voiced [zh] in
khezhbm.

Is there published work out there on the morpheme-internal devoicing in d-khak
to tkhak, but the supposed non-voing of, say, p- in pgam?  Or does all this
have to do with some transcription or romanization convention?

Thoughts or advice on this much appreciated.

Subject: Glaykhn

In answer to Miki Safadi's question [5.242], I learnt that "to like" was
'glaykhn' (as in 'Ikh gla:kh dus nisht') from my London-born-and-bred parents.
Even as an English-speaking but linguistically-oriented young boy I remember
thinking this sounded a bit "fishy", considering that 'glaykh' also
corresponds to English "like" in the (completely unconnected) meaning of
"similar to", but that's what they used.

I remember reading something about different colloquial Yiddish variants of
this somewhere, but I don't know where.  Besides the question of lexical
choice ('gefeln' or 'glaykhn'), there is the issue of its syntax to consider:
'_dos_ gefelt _mir_', '_ikh_ glaykh _dos_'...

Subject: Daytchmerisms

Thank you and hear, hear Ellen Prince [5.263]!

About 2 years ago, when I first strated communicating with Mendele I was
severely chastized for using "daytschmerisms" such as lezn, monat, etc. I was
informed in no uncertain terms that to use such words was a "baleydigung" to
the speakers of Yiddish. I was puzzled since I learned this vocabulary from my
parents who came to the USA from kleyne shtetlakh in Belarus and Ukraine at
the turn of the century. I was firmly convinced that the language that they
spoke was a proper dialect of Yiddish.

Since I was suspicious of the critics I requested information with regard to
the nature of the dialects spoken by the current speakers of the living
language (as opposed to the academic theoreticians of Yiddish). My initial
request fell into a black hole of silence. Instead I was treated to dogmatic
convoluted theoretical arguments laced with scorn.

In the past year I raised I quietly raised the same question, What do the
Khsidim speak? Finally we learn that they indeed speak the same so-called
"daytchmerish" Yiddish that my parents spoke. But again we are being treated
to hypothetical reasons as to "why" the speakers of the living language are
wrong or misled. Isn't it time to end such khutspah? A language is determined
by what the native speakers speak, not by what academic theoreticians claim
that they should speak. If students in the various college programs are being
misstaught so that they think that they are learning Yiddish and they
arrogantly proceed to "correct" the native speakers, isn't it time to disabuse
them of such error? Yiddish is not regimented by an academy as is French. That
is one of its strengths and beauties.

Subject: Ober/oder

Mikhl Herzog's comment on Ober = oder usage in German dialects is well taken.
In the entry for 'aber' in Goetze's 'Fruehneuhochdeutsches Glossar" there is a
general gloss "wieder" (cf. Yiddish 'ober un vider') and specifically for
Central German: "oder; sondern".

Subject: Khone Shmeruk's prize

In 5.260 there were some comments on the mistake of the Jerusalem Post in
referring to  "Khone Shmeruk"  as "Hana  Shamrock".  Mikhl  Herzog reports an
especially humourous telephone exchange he had with someone who looked for the
(female) Khana Shmorak.

May I make a few comments:

First Mazal Tov to Khone Shmeruk, and clearly every person is entitled to have
his/her name to be pronounced and written correctly.

As  others pointed  out, the  pronunciation of  not Hebrew  words when spelled
in  the  usual   Israeli  method  (without  vocalization)  is difficult.  No
Hebrew  speaker would have any  problems in pronouncing correctly my name
Shimshoni. :-)

Mikhl Herzog gave of course the correct Hebrew spelling (as K.S. likes it):
"Khone Shmeruk (khes-nun-alef shin-mem-reysh-vov-kuf)", but for a Hebrew
speaker "khes-nun-alef"  is  pronounced the  same  as that  of female
"khes-nun-heh", i.e. khana.  Israelis  might be excused for not being very
familiar with that  name of  a pretty obscure  gemara sage from Babylion.
Someone else (not Mikhl)  thought that it was the same name as  that of Khoni
Hama`gel, who  lived in Israel  many centuries earlier and his name is
"khes-vov-nun-yud".

As to  the mistake which M.H.   Herzog reported about the  family name which
was  thought to be  Shmorak, this can  be explained by  the fact that quite a
few years ago we had in Israel a fairly famous Dr Shmorak who was active in
the Jewish Agency (as comptroller?).

Finally, the name Khana ("khes-nun-alef"), while as said is obscure as a
Jewish male name, is quite  common among Arab males.  Strange world!

Michael Shimshoni

P.S.  In order to avoid confusion I used throughout the Yiddish way of
denoting Hebrew letters as Mikhl Herzog did, and not the way I usually write
them.
