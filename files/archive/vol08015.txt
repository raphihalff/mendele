Subject: What came before Yiddish?

Sam Kweskin asks: "Ikh zeekh material veygn di farshidineh l'shonim vos
unzere yiddish folk hobn geret ven zey hobn gevoint in Europe, un eyder zey
zenen arein in Deitschland oder deitsch-loshon teilen fun heintike
Frankreikh. L'moshl, ver kenn mir dertseilen veygn Italkik, oder Frankish,
oder Loez (Laaz) un Loter?"

The problem is that there are several competing views of where Yiddish comes
from, and accordingly different people will tell you different things.  I
suspect Mr. Kweskin is basing his formulation on the theory popularized by
Max Weinreich, though not I think originated by him, that the Yiddish
speakers were originally French speakers who came from France into the
Rhineland.  But it should be noted that the three loudest voices in Yiddish
historical linguistics in the last two decades have been those of Dovid Katz,
who says the Yiddish speakers originally spoke Aramaic, Paul Wexler who says
they originally spoke Sorbian (a Slavic language), and Robert King,, who does
not comment on this but does argue (like Katz> that Yiddish did not originate
in the Rhineland but in Bavaria and so presumably he too would not assume
that the Yiddish speakers could have been originally French speaking. 

Meyer Wolf and I and I alone have tried to argue with some of this, as well
as point out that Weinreich and those who pioneered his view did not have
very good arguments for it at all (in fact, I would say Weinreich himself had
none at all and was in this instance speaking completely ex cathedra, which
does NOT mean he was wrong, of course>. 

Add to this that when you red the fine print you find that Weirneich actually
argued that Yiddish originated in two places simultaneously, the Rhineland as
well as Bavaria, and that it was a different Yiddish in each place, although
they somehow are supposed to have become one later.  This idea has been
recently revived by Katz, who forgets to note that it actually was
Weinreich's and whose principal innovation is to say that we should onlu call
the Bavarian lg Yiddish and the Rhineland one something else and that we
should assume that the Rhineland language became extinct rather than it
somehow mereged with the Bavarian one into a single Yiddish (although even
there there is a complication because Katz says that Literary Middle Yiddish
had elements of the putative Rhineland language>. 

I myself believe and have argued that all these claims and counterclaims have
been based on inadequate, often laughably so, argument, and that the real
work on these questions is just beginning.

Subject: chas v'chalila

I guess I could look it up but it's more fun to get the variety and scope of
Mendeleyan input and commentary. My query relates to the translation and
derivation of "chas v'chalila" commonly used to mean G-d forbid when speaking
of some undesireable eventuality. Chas v'chalila that no one will know. 
Thanks.

Subject: Folklore about Jewish Weddings

I'm gathering stories, proverbs, sayings and folktales related to or about
Jewish weddings (shadkins, marriage contracts, the ceremony, etc. --
anything) for storyteller Estelle Solish, who will perform at RocklandFest
this summer. RocklandFest is sponsored by the Rockland County Folk Arts
Program. As a research assistant for the festival this year, I'd love some
help from Mendele participants, especially if you have stories or memories to
relate. 

You can help in two ways:

1.) Aside from B. Weinreich's *Yiddish Folktales, what reading materials or
sources might you recommend I look at -- preferably in English, though
Yiddish is OK? 

2.)  Do you have personal or family stories and memories you'd be willing to
share with me?  Any folktales/lore about the ceremony, participants, ritual,
ritual objects would be great?  What about proverbs, songs, sayings, or other
relateable information from the U.S., Eastern Europe, Israel, where or
whenever? 

Anything related would be immensely helpful.  It will aid storyteller Estelle
Solish delight and educate festival-goers about the wonders of and rich
folklore concerning Jewish weddings and marriage events. 

I hope to hear from you.  As time is of the essence, please E-mail me
personally at pqb5110@is.nyu.edu Feel free to E-mail entire stories; the
names and contact information of others who might be helpful; or snippets of
information.  If you would like me to call you, please E-mail me your
telephone number and a few times I can reach you this week and next. 

Either way, please include your contact information, even though the
information you provide will be used anonymously at RocklandFest, if that is
your desire. 

Thank you Mendele for providing a forum for inquiries of this nature. And
thank you Mendele participants for your patience and assistance with this
project.

Does anybody have the yiddish text of the Yehoyash poem, translated by Hava
Alberstein to Hebrew as "haHerev" [The Sword]?

Subject: my personal yiddish-english dictionary

There were several inquiries and comments regarding on-line dictionaries,
from khaverim Berger, Merkrebs and Baker, in recent issues of Mendele. My
experience might be of some interest.
 
In an attempt to expand my Yiddish vocabulary and reading comprehension, I
have tried, whenever possible, to list unfamiliar yiddish words (in longhand)
when I read Der Forverts and other Yiddish periodicals and books.  When I
have a few pages of such words, I look them up, and add the English
translation to my list, including other information that I feel might be
useful to me. As the list expanded, I found it necessary to put this on
computer so that it could be alphabetized for easy consultation. To date I
have over 3000 words in my "dictionary." This is a very personal selection,
of words that I did not happen to recognize when I came across them. I must
admit that this dictionary, or word-list, did not turn out to be the
time-saver I expected it to be, and I do not consult it much. The problem is,
obviously, I do not sit at the computer while I read, so it is faster to
continue making lists as I read. This is not an ideal way for me to learn or
to build vocabulary, but nonetheless I personally find it very satisfying.
Since all this information is romanized, my computer list does not have the
actual spelling of the loshn-koydesh derived words, just a notation, "H," to
remind me not to try to spell the word phonetically.  Perhaps some day I will
train myself to use Refoyl's software, or Q-Text, but that moment has not yet
arrived. I could probably make better use of my list if I printed it and kept
the hard copy nearby as I read, but I can't justify printing it when I am
constantly adding to it.  Whatever the practical consequence of this
endeavour, this opportunity to focus on Yiddish gives me great personal
pleasure, so I do not begrudge the time involved. And I do notice an increase
in my reading speed and comprehension, not as much as I would like, but
enough to encourage me to continue.

Subject: 2 more claims about the origin of davenen

I just came across the following:

Apparently,Judah A. Joffe in his article "The Etymology of Davenen and
Katoves", in the Proceedings of the American Academy of Jewish Research, vol.
28 (1959), pp. 77-92, proposes a Slavic origin for the word, basedon the word
for "to present a gift or offering". This was the word Jews usedto explain to
Gentile acquaintances why they would go off in a corner at theend of the
afternoon - they were "davenen" - giving an offering (minha) of prayer. 

This comes from a posting on some list I found on the Web by Dr. Gershon
Bacon, Dept. of Jewish History, Bar-Ilan University

Elsewhere on the web I found a brief article: Jewish Languages -- European By
William Brinner, where davenen is said to be one of the "elements of
Zarphatic" (i.e., Judeo-French).

Subject: Article about Argentine YIVO (IWO)

Dr. Saul Drajer, president of the Instituto Judio de Investigaciones (IWO) 
-- the Argentine YIVO -- has drawn my attention to an article that appeared
in the Buenos Aires daily newspaper "Clarin" on Friday, June 12, 1998: 
"Falta plata para restaurar todos los libros de la AMIA" [There is not enough
money to restore all of the books of the AMIA].  The article, which is
written by Pablo Abiad, is a status report on the straits in which IWO finds
itself, almost four years after the terrorist bombing that destroyed the
Jewish community (AMIA) building, where IWO was located.

According to the IWO's director, Abraham Lichtenbaum, the sum that would be
necessary to restore the library and archival materials lost or damaged in
the bombing amounts to $1,700,000.  Among the costs itemized in the article
are: 

(1) Replacement of 20,000 ruined books -- $700,000.  (The article notes that
the National Yiddish Book Center has pledged to donate 10,000 Yiddish books
and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research will donate books that it holds in
triplicate.) 

(2) Shelving -- $350,000. 

(3) Conservation of the large collection of paintings by Maurycy Minkowski --
$183,000.

The article notes that among the portions of IWO's collection that were most
severely damaged as a result of the bombing were its newspaper and periodical
collection, a collection of paintings, and audiotape collection.  The rare
books (180 volumes) and art albums were a total loss.  It was also not
possible to salvage IWO's Archive of the Spoken Word. 

According to the article, IWO has not received support from governmental or
Jewish communal institutions (with the exception of assistance received from
the National Library and the National Museums), but instead has relied solely
upon the efforts of a group of 30 dedicated volunteers.  In the course of
their work the volunteers (under the supervision of Ester Szwarc) have made a
number of interesting rediscoveries.  For example, they have come across
letters from Sigmund Freud, a zither that belonged to the singer Jevel
(Khevl) Katz, and a collection of theater posters which document the history
of Yiddish performance in Argentina.

Subject: Asch / Gottlieb

Can any Mendele reader help with the following bibliographic query? I am 
trying to establish whether a slim Yiddish art monograph by Sholem Asch 
on the Polish Jewish artist Maurycy Gotlieb was ever published.  The book 
is promised as one of several forthcoming volumes in a series issued in 
Paris by Le Triangle publishers in the 1920s.  Among those that did 
appear were books on Chagall, Modigliani, Camille Pisarro, and Max 
Liberman, but a series of thirteen was advertised, including the book by 
Asch.  The question is, did it ever appear, and, if so, is it in a 
library collection?
