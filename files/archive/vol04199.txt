Subject: Gantsfri

Bob Rothstein inquires about the expression gants fri etc.  My mother
only used fortseleranye when she was extremely upset as when we were too
tired to get up in the morning to help her but we would get ready in a
second if a friend came calling.  Most of the time she would use the term
"gants fri mit der roschene" The roschene was the early morning rising of
the yeast for the bread which was being prepared.  Hope this helps a bit.

I vote for [shabesdik] (after talking to myself for the past ten
minutes).  Could the lack of assimilation relate to the fact that it's
composed of a Hebrew root and a Germanic suffix?  I think [peysakhdik]
(vs. [peysakhtik]) and [yontifdik] (vs. [yontiftik] or [yontivdik] would
be similar situations, although [peysadik] ( < [*peysardik] <
[peysakhdik] ?? ), which I think I've also heard, might argue for voicing
before the /d/.

Subject: Distinctive aspiration

Khayem Bochner:

The claim about distinctive aspiration, which you correctly attribute to
Weinreich (Atlas, Volume I), Weinreich attributes to Beranek and
Guggenheim-Gruenberg.

It's hard to assess the reliability of our own data for demonstrating the
necessary contrasts. Our only "real" Western Yiddish speakers are from
Alsace, Switzerland, Holland, and western Hungary. Elsewhere, our western
respondents are German speakers from whom we can elicit isolated Western
Yiddish  words and expressions.

These may be enough to demonstrate, and our field-notes may be adequate
to reveal, "same or different" for such pairs as _peysakh_ 'Passover'--
_beyzer_ 'angry man' (p- = b- and -x = -r [realized as gamma]), but I
think that Volume V, _Western Yiddish_ will have to rely on instrumental
studies if it's to distinguish aspiration in such pairs as words for
'Passover' and 'pepper' ([p-], [ph-]?).

By the way, a positional "r/x" merger is also a feature of some
Northeastern Yiddish varieties of the [shabeZDik] type, in which _ikh
gey_ and _ir geyt_ are distinguished only by the presence or absence of
word-final [t]. I suspect that this may also be a factor in the
Northeastern Yiddish case merger of _mir/mikh_, _dir/dikh_.

In the [shabeZDik] class, also belong such expressions as [voz vilstu?],
[gandz gut], and [a hibzh bisl], as well. In my message to Arn Abramson,
the other day, I recalled its carryover into Uriel Weinreich's English:
[The fagd that], etc.

[shabeSDik] and [shabeSTik] also occur.

I'm also not a good enough phonetician to tell you whether there is any
distinctive aspiration in Eastern Yiddish. I'm not aware of any. If Neil
Jacobs is lurking, perhaps he can tell us whether he's encountered it.

By the way, where are your parents from? If we have recordings of others
from the same locations, we might be able to listen for it.

[re: Dagmar Mirre's question]

You can purchase Sutskever and thousands of other books through the
National Yiddish Book Center in Massachusetts .  The address is:

48 Woodbridge Street South Hadley, MA 01075

Just write and ask them for their most recent catalog, but because they
do not yet have a complete catalog of all their holdings (I'm not sure if
they'll ever have this), you should ask for a printout of titles they
have by the authors (or in the subjects) you're interested in.

         The Eighth Annual Klutznick Symposium
                 September 17-18, 1995
        Representation of Jews through the Ages
                   A Call for Papers

*******************************************************

Creighton University's Klutznick Chair in Jewish Civilization and Center
for the Study of Religion and Society will host the Eighth Annual
Klutznick Symposium to take place in Omaha, Nebraska on Sunday September
17 and Monday September 18, 1995. The theme of the Symposium will be
"Representations of Jews through the Ages."

Western history is replete with representations of Jews. This symposium
will explore those representations in theater, art, music, fiction,
political propaganda, religious literature, various forms of popular
culture, and any other field of endeavor. The Program Committee is
interested not only in what the representations have been, but also in
what they tell us about their creators and about the time in which they
were created.

Those chosen to participate in the symposium will be expected to submit
their papers in a scholarly form appropriate for publication. They will
also have twenty minutes to present the essential elements of their
papers in a manner suitable to an audience comprised of the general
public and scholars. Please note that the reading of academic papers
would not be appropriate.

Subsidies for the presenter's costs of transportation and accommodation
will be provided. It is expected that the symposium papers will be
published in book form.

For further information contact Maryellen Read, c/o The Klutznick Chair
in Jewish Civilization, or Bryan Le Beau, Director of the Center for the
Study of Religion and Society. One page abstracts and vitae should be
submitted to either Ms. Read or Dr. Le Beau by April 1, 1995.
