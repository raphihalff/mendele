Subject: Shepn/shlepn

Patty Becker (5.050) asks about _shepn_/_shlepn_/_schlepn nakhes_.  The
usage can be summed up this way, I think:  _dem goles shlept men, ober
nakhes fun kinder shept men_:  'One wearily drags around the Exile, but
one derives/draws proud pleasure from one's children.'  The overlap in
meaning between "drawing" and "dragging" adds to the similarity in sound
in producing the confusion, which is quite widespread.

The "c" in "sch" has no function, and so "sch" has no place in YIVO's
standard romanization scheme; the standard forms are _shepn_ and
_shlepn_.  (Mendele 4.170 has a simplified guide to the YIVO system.)

Subject: shep, shlep, nakhes and khohp

There is a difference between saying "ikh hob nakhes" and "ikh khop
nakhes: -- yes?  The first receives, the second snatches.  Is this
analagous to saying "ikh shep nakhes" vs "ikh shlep nakhes"?

Subject: Shepn/schepn/shlepn

Patty Becker has asked about the distinction, with regard to nakhes,
between shepn and shlepn.  One does _not_ shlep nakhes, unless one has
children from whom nakhes is not forthcoming.  Men _shept_ nakhes, one
_draws_ nakhes, as one draws water from a well.  Shlepn suggests dragging
a burden, which nakhes is the antithesis of.  (Of course, one could argue
that the English words *draw* and *drag* come from the same root, but for
that argument make your posting to "Villiam, _English_ Literatur un
Lengvidzh", not to Mendele.)

As for spelling, *schlep* is German in orthography.  Standardized Yiddish
transliteration into English, following the YIVO model, keeps it simple:
sh means sh.  (You'll _see_ *sch*, but that spelling is rong.)  ;)

Subject: Music notation

It is so enjoyable to read the many Yiddish songs that are posted from
time to time.  A good number of them, however, are new to me--as they may
well be to plenty of other subscribers--and I would like very much to
know the music to which the words are sung.

Being new to the Internet in general, I wonder if someone has already
developed a functional form of music notation that can be transmitted via
email, without requiring graphic computer capabilities.

The "tonic sol-fa" notation, consisting of English characters (doh, re,
mi, fa, so, la, ti, doh'   abbreviated "d,r,m,f,s,l,t,d' ") and certain
punctuation marks, might be adapted.  For example, Hatikvah might be
written:

	(Tempo 4/4)   |l,t,:dr|m-:m-|fm:fl'|m-:--|  [un vayter]

where, in the key of C, "la," would be the note A below middle C; the "|"
is a bar-sign, and the " : " marks the mid-bar.  The symbols "," and " '
" after a note would indicate it belongs in the octave above or below the
central octave, respectively.

If this is of interest to others, I would welcome a more simple and
effective approach.  We could discuss it by direct personal mail, so as
not to bore other Mendelyanern with a topic that may not be of general
concern.

Subject: Teaching Yiddish

In response to Helen Abeles's question regarding day schools that teach
Yiddish, allow me to share a deep secret:) with the Mendele fraynd.
There exists in dem vaytn un kaltn Canada, in der shtot Montreal a day
school system of over l600 students that teaches Yiddish from
kindergarten through to senior high school. There are 2 elementary
branches and ahigh school oyfn nomen Yiddishe folks shuln un Peretz shuln
un Bialik High School.  These schools are celebrating 80 years of
existence and are the largest school within the Montreal Day school
system which includes over 20 schools and approx. 60000 students. Di vos
zorgn zikh vegn dem kiyum fun Yiddish voltn b'emes badarft zikh
araynkhapn tsu undz in shtot zen vos fara oytzres mir farmogn onhebndik
mit di shuln, dernokh di velt barimte Yiddish Folks Bibliotek un gevis
undzer Yiddish teater vos shpilt 2 mol in  yor, 3-4 vokhn. Montreal was
and continues to be an active centre of Yiddish culture, Yiddish learning
and Yiddish activity in general.

As for the schools, I would be happy to  hear from anyone interested in
what we do here.  I'll be back in Montreal early August. Dervayl hot mir

Subject: Davka

In 5.039 Harvey Spiro says he has heard "davka" creeping into Yiddish
spoken in Israel.  I believe the word must have been in use in at least
some dialects of Yiddish long before Israel existed because it has made
its way into German.  "Aus Daffke" is used to describe the motivation (or
rather absence of a rational motivation) for an action, meaning "for
spite", "for no good reason", "just because I wanted to."  It's a bit on
the colloquial side of the language, as are many of the German words of
Yiddish origin, but it can be found in most dictionaries.

Subject: Koala Farlag (Melbourne)

For those interested in recently published Yiddish children's books (of a
secular nature, that is; there is also a burgeoning literature in Yiddish
aimed at Hasidic children and youth), the fittingly named Koala Farlag,
in Melbourne (3 Lubrano Street, East Brighton, Victoria 3187, Australia),
has published a number of titles.  Most are aimed at young children who
are just beginning to learn to read Yiddish.  The latest publication by
Koala Farlag is "Tantsndike Dinozavers" (Dancing Dinosaurs), by Rebecca
White, a 14-year-old student at Leibler-Yavneh College in Melbourne.  A
press release issued by Koala Farlag notes:

"She formerly studied Yiddish at Sholem Aleichem College's Sunday School,
and has since continued her interest in Yiddish by taking private
classes.  In fact, it was a homework assignment last year set by her
Yiddish tutor, Mrs Bobbi Zylberman, which led to Rebecca's debut as a
published author....  [Dancing Dinosaurs] tells of a little girl,
Malkele, who can't get to sleep because she imagines dinosaurs coming out
of her doll box.  But Malkele's fears are overcome when her father
promises he will eat up any dinosaurs he finds in her bedroom -- with
horseradish!"

The cost of the book is $5.00 (Australian), plus $3.00 (Australian) for
postage and handling.  For those Mendelnikes who happen to be near Gold's
or Sunflower Bookshops, in Melbourne, it is also available for purchase
there.

Subject: Reading material for kids

Harvey Spiro asks about reading material for kids. If you don't mind the
religious content, there's a fair bit of new material available from the
Judaica stores in Boro Park (Eichler's on 13th Ave., for example), in New
York. These are produced by and for the Chassidic Yiddish-speaking
community, so they're infused with that culture.  Some of it is rather
good, and some of it comes with accompanying tapes (e.g. Di Alef-Beys
Velt).
