Subject: Introduction

I am a very recent member of Mendele, connecting from Belgium, Brussels
Area. My name is Rudi Roth, mathematician and working today in
data-commmunications. I started Yiddish a good year ago at a 2-week
summer course (a Pintele of Yiddish) in the University of Brussels and
continued since. Got this tuesday my Yiddish exam and cross my fingers.

I managed since some days to type in correctly yiddish under Word6 and
would like to see how we could exchange yiddish typed texts over the Net.
In Europe, we use X.400 as mail system and you can just attach any file
with your mail. Over the Net it is somewhat more complicated today. Any
candidates?

I have also two suggestions for Mendele:

1. Calender of Yiddish activities.

As I have seen in Mendele, there are several events taking place
regarding yiddish activities, why not make a kind of rolling-over
calender issued once a week or a fortnight and containing those such as
Mamelosh '95, Ashkenaz, Yiddish convention in Miami, a yiddish summer
programme in Polen and Galicie,...? It could consist of activities of a
certain duration that are worth the trip, the detour or that someone
travelling in the area could attend.

I know of some other activities in Europe that are worth mentionning and
I just list here what I have and know. If Mendele wants to make a
calender, this could be a start and why not already somewhat structured
(I just add a suggestion hereafter, feel free to adapt):

Dates,Location,Activity,Organizer,tel,fax,contact name,price

18 JUNE,25JUNE,Krakau(PL),Yiddish song festival (no more info available)

3 JULY,14 JULY,Brussels(BE),A Pintele of Yiddish (course and
activities),Martin Buber Institute of the free University of Brussels,+32
2 650 33 48,+32 2 650 33 47,Mr W. BOK

17 JULY,11 AUGUST 95,Oxford(UK),Yiddish Summer Course,Oxford Institute
for Yiddish Studies,+44 1865 798989,+44 1865 798987,Marie
Wright,450-975USD

2. Yiddish and etymology.

My other suggestion concerns etymology and it could become a part of the
now "well-known" yiddish on cd-rom.

Several languages have imported words from yiddish and accepted them as
part of the "official" language. A lot of the words came from hebrew, but
were derived from the yiddish form. Why not search for those in several
languages. I have some in french and dutch and I am sure that there are
"tons" in english, but also in other languages.

That's it for now. A gut yor.

Subject: Introduction

The notice about introductions finally has goaded me in to action. My
name is Van Wallach, I'm 37, and I have been getting Mendele since last
fall and have found it very useful. I am a magazine writer in Westport,
Connecticut, a zamler for the National Yiddish Book Center and a
contributor to der bay on Jewish film and music subjects, although I have
not written anything lately. I also write a column for a local newspaper,
The Minuteman, called Ongepatshket, about the experience of being a new
father. I have a long interest in Yiddish. Besides the historical and
cultural meaning, I just love the sound of Yiddish. I like writing about
Yiddish culture (in English) and am constantly looking for outlets. I
also want to introduce it to my son, and already play "On Wings of Song,"
Tex Klez, the Klezmer Conservatory Band and other tapes to him so the
sounds and moods will be familiar to him. If anybody else is giving their
children a Yiddish introduction, I would like to hear about it.

Subject: Introduction

I didn't mean to "lurk"!  I too joined the list over the past month or
two and didn't get around to saying hello 'til now.   I really identify
with Joann Z. Green's recent introduction, where she speaks of being "a
newcomer to Yiddish, stricken with all the symptoms of new romance" --
amen!   Mine is the usual story: grandparents from the Old Country who
spoke Yiddish, parents who used it as stumbling secret code - and my
brother and me, with our handful of funny-sounding words...  I started
studying Yiddish (via a community class in Berkeley) a few months ago,
led to it by a growing desire to understand the culture and "neshuma" of
my family's recent and erased history...  also with a desire to be able
to read among the incredible treasure-trove of poets (I myself am a
writer--  ).

I have found Mendele to be a *very* heymish place to come, read, think &
reflect on what's written here....  It's a wonderful resource, I am so happy
to have discovered it (and all of you!).

Meanwhile -- why wait? -- I have two questions:

1.  I was surprised & excited to read that one subscriber, Alan Shuchat,
has a bobe from Soroki -- my mother's mother came from that town & I know
so little about it -- (she left in 1913 for the States; died in 1956) --
any information/ resources/ anecdotes people have to share about that
town would be gratefully appreciated!

2.  I am moving to Albany, NY in a few months to enter a doctoral program
at the State University there -- alas, they do not offer Yiddish -- can
anyone recommend someone to study Yiddish with or someplace to study
there?
