Subject: An-sky

I extend a hearty thanks to the many senders who offered me
information and leads about An-sky.  I am excited to
follow them up.  They have prompted me to put forth a
question regarding some of the work I am doing in this
respect.

Recently, inspired by an article by Dr. Mendes-Flohr in
Studies in Contemporary Jewry (1987?) I have been pursuing
the question of how a genre of scholarship by Western
Jewish intellectuals writing at the turn of the century can
be placed into the general context of the "Orientalist
movement" that Said, primarily, explores.

While studying An-sky's work, I have begun to wonder: what
does it mean for Ansky, highly educated, with a strong
socialist leaning, to "return" to the study of Jewry, and
more particularly, contemporary Eastern Jewish communities?
How is his project a synthesis of admiration and
objectification--particularly given the fact that a goal of
An-sky's was to assemble a musuem of the "ethnographic
objects" he zammled along the way?  Does such a pursuit
find inspiration in the Western European vogue of making a
pilgrimage to colonial (mystical, alien) lands?

Is it stretching the point to suggest that the fascination
with the Ostjuden as cultural other by certain highly
educated and highly assimilated Western Jews "colonializes"
Eastern Jewry?  Though An-sky was of shtetl origin himself,
as an educated and assimilated Jew he, like many peers,
spent formative years in Paris--where folkloric and
colonial trends were simultaneously develo ping.

Finally, can authors such as Peretz, Shalom Alechem, and
Asch--who describe the shtetl with a similar combination of
admiration and sarcasm, be said to share with An-sky an
"objectified" passion with shtetl life?

I am aware that the Ostjuden were sometimes referred to as
"Asiatic" or "Halb Asian"  by Western Jews. This seems to
me to be a philosophical as well as geographic
catagorization.  Mendes-Flohr's article was the first one I
had read overtly questioning the association between the
Ostjuden and the "Orient"- -and more particularly, the myth
thereof.

Has work been done in this regard that I have
not come across?   In as much as it is largely theoretical
I am not certain as to what extent I am lost in my own
research!  I have really only begun this work, and
recognize many of these ideas and questions as primitive.
But all the more, I welcome responses.

totally trivial comment: in my recollection of the cy i
grew up hearing, the vowel would be much longer than in
_botch_, more like _march_ if you don't pronounce the /r/
(as we didn't, back in brooklyn).

Subject: Query

My late colleague Nathan Maccoby was exceedingly proud of
having been a descendent of the Kamenetzer Magid. We are
trying to prepare a fairly elaborate biography, and would
appreciate stories, references, etc. about the said Magid,
and the tradition of Magidship (magiderei? magidshoft?).

Subject: Jerome Rothenberg's poetry

  Mendelniks (?) who were moved, as I was, by Ira
Robinson's evocative review of the Journal _Polin_, about
Polish Jewry, might appreciate knowing of the two volumes
of poetry by the noted poet/folklorist Jerome Rothenberg
that are related to the devastation of people and culture
that took place.

  One collection is _Khurbn & Other Poems_. New York: New
Directions, 1989; the other is _poland 1931_. Santa
Barbara, CA: Unicorn Press, 1970. (Harvard lists this as a
limited edition; since I read some of these poems in
Portland, Oregon, either Portland State University's
library has one of the 500 editions issued, or it's been
republished, or some of the poems were later collected in
an anthology of his. I suspect this last is the case.)
