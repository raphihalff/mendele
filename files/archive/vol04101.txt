Subject: Introduction

I am a Ph.D. student in Germanic Languages at the University of
Pennsylvania.  My studies focus primarily on German-Jewish literature
from the mid-19th century to the present, though I have a special
interest in Post-Holocaust fiction.  Translation -- both theory and
practice -- is another subject area in which I am interested, and I am
currently involved in translating the two most recent works of Jurek
Becker: Nach der Ersten Zukunft and Amanda Herzlos.

I also write my own fiction, mostly short stories, but sporadically I
work on a rather complicated novel set in the 1940's in Dresden.

As for Yiddish, I will begin learning it soon, this Thursday in fact is
my first lesson.  Hopefully I can begin sending notes in Yiddish soon.

With warm regards,

Robert Fuhrmann

Subject: Introduction

I am Professor of German and Comparative Literature at the University of
Pennsylvania and Co-Chair of the Program in Comparative Literature and
Literary Theory.  I am working on German-Jewish literature, primarily of
the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Although the authors I am
concerned with are writing in German (at least, primarily), Yiddish was
the mother tongue of many of them, for example Salomon Maimon or Rahel
Levin.

With all my best wishes for a happy New Year,

Liliane Weissberg

Subject: Introduction

I teach law at SUNY (Buffalo). Parents spoke Yiddish but as the "adult"
la language. So, I am familiar with the cadejnces and some phrases but
need to focus on acquiring greater knowedlge. This past spring was my
second time teaching law in Poland at Jagiellonian University in Cracow.
Have travel;led extensively in Poland and spent time at Jewish sites in
various cities, have done research on domestic violence in Poland (which
I am now writing up), am still coping with the complexity of what I
experienced there, as well as in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Serbia
where I have spent some time.

Subject: Chelm Dialect

As part of the Montreal Yiddish Theatre's Fall productions (two programs
celebrating 100 years of Yiddish Theatre in Montreal, including many
scenes from past productions, a multi-media presentation, and a
historical overview by a (non-Yidddish-speaking!) Professor, Prof.
Jean-Marc Larrue of the University of Montreal, who is an expert on
Montreal Yiddish Theatre), the Theatre is producing a scene from the Wise
Men of Chelm. For some reason, the cast has gotten into a number of
arguments about the proper dialect to be used by the Chelmer characters,
and particularly by Reb Yoysef Loksh, the lead role. We have several
scenes (such as out of I.B. Singer's In My Father's Court) which require
a thick Warsaw accent, and others which occur in Vilna (like Grade's The
Agunah) which we are also clear on in terms of accent, but what about
Chelm? (Answers would be helpful either in terms of vowel pronunciations
or even in comparison to Lithuanian vs. Polish Yiddish; we have several
native speakers of both in the cast who are always more than happy to
differentiate that for the rest of us...)

PS - if anyone is within range and interested, these Yiddish Theatre
Shows (there are shows every spring and fall) run through most of
October, Tue-Thu and Sat-Sun night and Sun matinee, at the Saidye
Bronfman Centre on Cote-Ste-Catherine Road in Montreal, Telephone
(514)739-2301. Simultaneous Live Translation (using earphones) into
English and/or French is available at no cost to audience members.

Subject: YIVO letter from Argentina

Dear Fishl,

I really appreciate the space dedicated in your publication as regards
what happened in the YIVO in Buenos Aires. My life was saved because of
our programme on the radio on Sundays from 10 to 12 p.m. That's why on
Mondays I arrive at the YIVO after 10 o'clock in the morning. That
terrible Monday I should have begun my work with an interview at 10:15.
Unfortunately the person that was waiting for me died in the attack. The
hard work to rescue the library and the file didn't let me write to you
before, but the information you received through Zachary Baker, given by
my pupil and co-worker on my programme, Saul Drajer is correct. I hope to
go on being in touch with you and keep on reporting to your readers what
we are doing in Buenos Aires. I'm afraid I won't participate in the
conference in Kiev or Toronto. All our efforts must be concentrated on
rebuilding of the YIVO and this requires not only work but a lot of
money. That's why I thank you for news of the account we opened in the
U.S.A. and it would be very helpful if you could publish it again and
also in all the Jewish community magazines and send it by e-mail. I'm
deeply thankful and I wish you and your readers A GUT UN GEZUNT YOR.

Subject: Lists of yiddish first names

The best list I know is to find in the Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dic-
tionary of Alexander Harkavy (1988 Reprint of the 1928 2nd edition p.
525-530). It is a quite long list with english equivalents. A shorter
list of the most frequent yiddish names is to be found in Salomo A.
Birnbaums "Grammatik der Jiddischen Sprache" (Hamburg, my edition is the
4th of 1984).

If you know the technique of changing hebrew words to yiddish, you may
take almost any hebrew name (most of the biblical names). Exam- ples may
be found in my favourite "Verterbikhl fun hebreyish-yiddi- she verter fun
Yankef Levin (Cyco Froyen Centrale, New York 1958), p. 92-96.

Alternative solutions are personal names out of the vast yiddish
literature and if you want to save time, just open the first page of any
yiddish play and look through the list of characters. Shana Tova with
happy hunting and light birth! Ruben

Subject: Translation process

For a nuts and bolts outline of a process used in translating from
Italian into English, see _The Process of Translation_, by William
Weaver, in THE CRAFT OF TRANSLATION, eds. John Biguenet & Rainer Schulte,
University of Chicago Press, 1989, pp. 117-124.

Weaver describes a method of complex revisions that he uses after dashing
off a first draft until finding something that "feels right."  Everything
he says seems to fit somewhere in my experience of translating Yiddish to
English (minus the macaronic language veytikn).
