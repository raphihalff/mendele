Subject:      Initial consonants

    Ellen Prince is right in saying that the letters
'alef and <ayin stand for consonants in some varieties
of modern Hebrew and certainly in biblical Hebrew. For
Oriental Jews still speaking the Hebrew of their home
countries, word-inital 'alef stands for a glottal stop
(not a fricative) and <ayin for some kind of pharyngeal
fricative or glide, whatever is normal in the Arabic
dialect of the same people. In discussing this with
Semiticists, I have come to understand that the exact
phonetic nature of these consonants in biblical Hebrew,
not to mention post-biblical Hebrew, is moot. Indeed,
Arabists, particularly the experimental phoneticians
among them, have shown that the so-called "voiced
pharyngeal" fricative differs somewhat in production as
you move from one Arabic variety to another.

    As for the beginnings of Yiddish orthography, based
as it was on Hebrew script, there is also the question
of the kind of Hebrew that the Jews were using for
liturgy and the study of texts as they settled in
Germanic lands after a sojourn in Romance territory.

   It should also be pointed out that in Hebrew not
only is the letter vav (=vov) used both consonantally
and vocalically, but so is 'alef when it appears as the
medial or final element in a root. In addition, if the
consonant represented by the letter vav is to be
reconstructed, as is commonly done, as /w/ in biblical
Hebrew, then we must understand that this "consonant"
was a glide or semivowel,thus a phoneme with
consonantal functions in some contexts but with a
rather vocalic phonetic nature!

Nar/naronim
===========

Isaac Aronson writes:

Also, Yitzhak Kertesz writes:

>Didn't the expression "hazonim - naronim" help the

>and what about the meaning of the word? namely, isn't a
>word with the meaning "narr" allowed to show a little
>"narrishkeyt"?

So far, the discussion has established that "nar" is of
Germanic origin but has not explained the -on- in the
plural.  The examples of Hebrew words ending in -n
(including hazn/hazonim) don't do it, since these
follow the regular rules for plurals of Hebrew nouns in
Yiddish.  And the other examples of -im plural endings
for non-Hebrew words don't insert an additional
consonant.

Yitzhak Kertesz' suggestion, however, leads me to a
different speculation.  There is one example of
inserting -on-, namely rav/rabonim.  Was there a
parallel expression "rabonim -- naronim"?
Alternatively, might the pair rabonim/naronim
humorously suggest that a fool is puffed up with his
own importance and considers himself as having the
dignity of a rav?

Shtumer alef
============

Ellen Prince describes the consonantal values of alef
and ayin in Semitic languages and points out that the
Greeks also converted them to vowels.  I agree.  My
point, perhaps poorly expressed, was that this would
not have meant much to those originally devising what
was to become the Yiddish writing system in the Middle
Ages.

Yitzhak Kertesz writes:

>You conclude by claiming that yid is written with a

>"id". But couldn't the writing precede and influence
>the pronunciation? Namely, written with an aleph for

Sure.  I was simply reacting to a number of
contributors who cited dialects that use [id].  The
original alternative hypothesis was that the alef-yud
spelling developed because of religious scruples over
writing yud-yud.

I am rather puzzled by the nar/naronim since I've
always thought it was nar/naroyim????  Is that perhaps
unique to Riga Yiddish?

Subject: Yiddish theater and Klezmer music in New York

We will be visiting New York from May 27 until June 16
and are very much interested in Yiddish theater and
Klezmer music. What places should we go to? Where can
we find out what shows are on? Are there things we
should not miss?

Any suggestions are welcome!

I think it's a coincidence; offhand I can find one
counterexample: tayvl "devil" - tayvolim or tayvlonim.
Perhaps also kundes-kundeysim, but I don't know the
etymology of kundes.

By the way, what Mikhl Herzog says about dialectal
confusion between -n & -im makes a lot of sense for
examples like poyerim. And then we can account for
doktoyrim as assimilation to a common pattern for loshn
koydesh nouns, as he says.

BUT X-Xonim, as in nar-naronim, is _not_ a common
pattern. Offhand I know of only two cases where it
occurs in real loshn koydesh verter: rov-rabonim, and
lets-leytsonim (or leytsim).

Since it isn't a common pattern, I think we have to
appeal to old-fashioned analogy here. I've always
guessed that the form originated with the desire to
have a humorous parallelism in the phrase "rabonim un
naronim".
