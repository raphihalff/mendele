Subject: Race and Humor in Yiddish jokes

Many years ago, I heard the following:

Q: What is the difference between a black man at age 20 and age 21?

A: A shvarts yor.

Subject: Race and Humor in Yiddish jokes

A saying worth recording is "Don't call me shvartse" --as witnessed,
recalled, and admired by our dad, Louis Filler, I expect from the 1940's.
There seem to be Web references. It's an employee, a woman, addressing her
employers, a couple that she is aware speak about her in front of her and
on the pretense that she's oblivious to their phrase for her, di shvartse,
whose rough translation is "the black." Compare Sembene's short film
tragedy "The Black Girl," whose original French title is "La noire de";
i.e., "The Female Black [servant] Of," to be completed with the name of
the white employer couple. Compare also the tragic-comic bit in the
feature-length "Bamako," where an unemployed Malian in complete isolation
is studying conversational Hebrew in hopes of eventual employment.
(Compare also Phillip Dean's three-act "The Sty of the Blind Pig" on the
theme They Say I'm Like One of The Family. And the Web indicates a song
with "stop calling me shvartse" in it.)No, s'z nisht kein (nisht a?)
Yiddish joke or saying in toto, except for the one word, but it opens a
cultural interface the size of the universe; as does the traditional
perception of the American Jews as other than white; or, it may be, a
universe and a half.

Referring to racist jokes, please make a note of the lyrics of this old
tune:Shiker is a goy / shiker iz er / trinken miz er / vayl er iz a goy.

Subject: General inquiry about heirs/estates of Yiddish writers and other
cultural figures

1) There is a "Beys Shalom Ash" [Shalom Ash House] in Bat Yam. See:
"http://www.bat-yam.muni.il/show_item.asp?levelId=3D57805"
2) And a "Beys Leivik" [Leivik House] in Tel Aviv that is the home of the
Yiddish Writers and Journalists - they may be able to help you vis-a-vis
Dzigan and Shumakher
See: "http://www.leyvik.org.il/ArticlesEN2.aspx"

3) There is a Shura Turkow - I believe, from the famous Turkow family -
affiliated with the Arbeter ring in Israel. Contact Bela Briks-Klein at:
"belaforverts@gmail.com"

Regarding "biz keyn dants." "Biz keyn" means all the way to. "Dants" could
be Danzig (Gdansk).

Subject: Book of verses sought

This is a request for a book which I used as a child - I was born in
1938.Unfortunately, the book was lost and I was wondering if any of your
readers would perhaps have a copy of it. I do not know the title - but it
was a book of verses.
One of the poems in it - and I quote the first four lines:

Ale zogn ikh bin sheyn
Far vos ikh bin gevaksn kleyn
Ikh ken tantsn, deklamirn
Mames gest tsu amuzirn

Here's hoping someone recognizes the verse.

Many thanks,
Naomi Bloch

Subject: song lyrics sought

Dear Friends,

My mother used to sing me a children's song the first line of which we
both believed was:
"Reyzele, hot zi a neyzele, mit fiselekh kortsinke, hoya hoya!"  We both
treated it as a nonsense song of sorts.  I have since learned that we were
both mistaken about the lyrics (she is a native speaker of Yiddish), and
the first line actually is "Reyzele, hot zi an eyzele, mit fiselekh
kortsinke..."  which makes ever so much more sense.  Does anyone have the
lyrics for this song?  I'd love to see it through this new lens and have
since forgotten all the lyrics (Is there a recording of this song?  It's
not one of the common ones.)

Many thanks, in advance -- a sheynem dank,
