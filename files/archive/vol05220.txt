Subject: Apostrophes

I'm coming in rather late in this discussion as my job has been demanding most
of my concentration and I haven't had the chance to give a lot of energy to
other things, like our beloved Mendele. I agree with Marion Aptroot and Zellig
Bach about possibly getting into all sorts of internal punctuation styles,
which have more to do with the wants of English-speakers.

When I was a serials cataloger at NYU, I dealt with a lot of Yiddish
newspapers and periodicals that were very daytshmerized, and I found quite
often that an apostrophe would be added when a Hebraic stem was connected to
Germanic prefixes and suffixes. I don't see much of this at all anymore, but I
do seem to remember seeing it in the Forverts, which preserved a lot of those
old spelling conventions (e.g. Id, idish).

Just a word about "Alsatian". A Yiddish scholar, a guter khaver mayner, went
to Alsace, and learned some Alsatian Yiddish from the old people that were
left. I don't know how true this is, but he said the Marx brothers' parents
were from Alsace, and the nonsense title of one of their movies, "Duck Soup"
comes from an Alsatian Yiddish exclamation "Dukh zuuuu". I don't claim any
expertise in that particular dialect, so caveat emptor. I've seen specimens of
Southwest Yiddish, and I've always been amazed at the lack of interference by
the local Gentile patois. Alemannisch (hope I spelled that right) is very
rough going, and the Yiddish spoken there would be easier for a German Gentile
from points further North to understand.

A grus aykh alemen!

Subject: Dov Noy lectures at Stanford

As requested of me by one mendelyaner, I am providing a brief report on the
Yiddish lectures given by Prof. Dov Noy at Stanford University on January
10-11.

Prof. Noy spoke twice, the first evening in English on "Time and Space in
Jewish Folklore." Bekitser, his thesis was that in Jewish folklore, in
contrast to non-Jewish folklores, time is more important than space. Only in
Jewish folklore do we see an orientation towards the future, for example. In
his second lecture, given in Yiddish, Prof. Noy spoke about the process of
folklorization, by which songs with known authors become folksongs. He defined
a folksong as a song that is commonly sung and adapted by a "folk" or "oylem"
that may be unaware of the composition's author. (I am writing these summaries
af eyn fus so they of course do not do justice to the scope of the lectures.)

Both talks were interspersed with examples of folktales and folksongs
which made them especially lively and entertaining for the audience.

If anyone is interested, I'll listen to my tape of Rav Shakh's speech and let

Subject: Redn tsum reboyne-shel-oylem

Interestingly, Vol. 5.218 includes both a poem (by Marty Ross, transmitted by
Bert Steinberg) in which the speaker is skeptical about the meaning of praying
to God, and an inquiry from Sylvan Zavi Beer about a poem in which God is
asked when the promise of making the Jews like the stars in the sky will be
fulfilled, they having already been made like the dust of the earth.

The poem Sylvan is looking for is Shimen Frug's (1860-1916) _Zamd un shtern_,
which has been anthologized in several collections.  Here it is as it appears
in Uriel Weinreich's _College Yiddish_, followed by my decidedly unpoetic
literal translation.

Zamd un Shtern
by Shimen Frug

Es shaynt di levone, es glantsn di shtern;
Di nakht shvebt oyf barg un oyf tol.
Dos altitshke bikhele ligt far mir ofn,
Ikh leyen es, leyen es toyznter mol.

Ikh leyen di heylike, tayere verter;
Mir hert zikh a shtime:  "Ikh shver,
Mayn folk, du vest zayn vi di shtern in himl,
Vi zamd oyfn breg funem mer!"

Reboyne-shel-oylem!  Es vert nit farfaln
Fun dayne havtokhes keyn eyn eyntsik vort;
Mekuyem muz vern dayn heyliker viln,
Alts kumt in zayn tsayt, oyf zayn ort.

Un eyns iz shoyn take mekuyem gevorn--
Dos fil ikh, dos veys ikh gevis:
Mir zaynen gevorn vi zamd vos is hefker,
Vos yederer tret mit di fis...

Yo, gotenyu, emes, vi zamd un vi shteyner,
Tseshpreyt un tsevorfn oyf shand un oyf shpot...
Nu, ober di shtern di likhtike, klore--
Di shtern, di shtern, vu zaynen zey, got?
============================================================

Sand and Stars

The moon is shining, the stars are glistening;
Night floats on mountain and on valley.
The dear old book lies open before me,
I read it, read it thousands of times.

I read the holy, dear words:
I hear a voice:  "I swear,
My people, you will be like the stars in heaven,
Like sand on the shore of the sea!"

Lord of the world!  Not one single word
Of your promises ever is lost:
Your holy will must be done,
Everything comes in its time, in its place.

And one thing has already come to pass--
I feel it, I know it for certain:
We have become like stray sand,
That everyone tramples underfoot...

Yes, dear God, truly, like sand and like stones,
Dispersed and scattered in disgrace and humiliation...
Well, but the bright, clear stars--
The stars, the stars, where are they, God?

Shleyme Axelrod
