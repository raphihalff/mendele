Subject: American Ganef

As a mew member, I shall first respond to the question of the meaning of
American Ganef:  A discussion in Yiddish Lingo, 11/12/1970, by Joel
Waxman, mentions three types of thieves.  "A Khamsn buys things that
nobody really wants to sell.  He is punished in guilt.  A Gazlon is an
armed robber.  He must return the value of the object or return it. A
Ganef is a sneak thief who must pay back twice or more what he stole
because he is afraid of being caught and thus is more concerned about
that than the crime itself, or more concerned about man than God."  While
I know little about Jewish law, it seems clear that the phrase American
Ganef is very or doubly pejorative.

Subject: Amerika Ganif

My recollection of this favorite expression of my mother and family is
parallel to that of others -- expression of "wondrous things" in the US
such as the escalator -- but also as often with a sense of implied social
criticism.  Thus, I would expect that my relatives would easily greet an
explanation of the invention of junk bonds as a mechanism to enable
speculators to buy a corporation using its own money and assets and
selling off parts for profit and to pay for transaction costs with the
exclamation "Amerika Ganif!"  And this is different from the famous joke
of the physicist son explaining to his father by simple analogies of time
[an hour is like a minute when one is with a loved one and a minute is
like an hour when sitting on a hot radiator] Einstein's theory of
relativity with the father's answer: "Und fun dos makht a yid a lebn?"

Subject: Yiddish fonts/music tapes

I am also wondering if the use of a Yiddish program has been considered
for Mendele?  Yes?  No?  Is cost an issue?  I find the Yiddish alphabet
easier to read than the Romanized one. How about others?

Second, I know of a man here in Roch.N.Y. with a considerable number of
tapes of a Jewish music program from yesteryear locally--before I lived
here.  I have planned to look him up and will do so soon and convey what
I find out.

Subject: Hey! Zhankoye

Hey! Zhankoye [Mendele v3.109]

The second stanza as posted contains an error (in Yiddish) in the sixth
line which repeats the first stanza's "S'iz a stantziye an antikel" This
should be "Bayle ba der molotilke" as printed in "The People's Song
Book," pp. 46-47 (N.Y.: Boni & Gaer, 1948).  There one will also find the
"familiar" English translation mentioned by Mikhl Herzog and others, with
the "cream extractor" line, English by Peter (sic) Seeger.  It was was
recorded c.1940's, but I no longer have the record or remember if it was
Pete Seeger alone or with the Almanac Singers.  Seeger's "free"
translation captured the spirit if not the literal Yiddish words.

       Hey! Zhankoye

When you go from Sevastopol,
One the way to Simpferopol,
  Just you got a little farther down.
There's a little railroad depot
Known quite well by all the people
  Called Zhankoye, Dzahn, dzahn, dzahn.
     (chorus)

                  Now if you look for paradise
                  You'll see it there before your eyes.
                    Stop your search and go no farther on.
                  There we have a collective farm
                  All run by husky Jewish arms
                    At Zhankoye, dzahn, dahn, dzahn ...
                       (chorus)

Aunt Natasha drives the tractor
Grandma runs the cream extractor
  While we work we all can sing our songs.
Who says that Jews cannot be farmers?
Spit in his eye, who would so harm us.
  Tell him of Zhankoye, dzahn, dzahn.

Subject: Feygele -- Butterfly

Absent I.B. Singer who might tell us what word was used in Poland for a
gay male (could there perhaps be something in his Yiddish papers?), and
the obvious lack of this as a subject in print in the early years of this
century where can one look for an early printed use?  While some have
raised the question of a link to butterfly, it should be noted that this
is not an obvious one.  While Spanish has used 'mariposa' this never made
it in French because the word had already been taken over by prison argot
to refer to one who escapes from jail by "flying" over the walls, as in
the movie "Papillon" with Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman some years
back, based on the book of the same name.  The "Dictionnaire de L'Argot
Moderne" (1953 [1957]) gives this usage.  On the other hand, "M.
Butterfly" suggest this as an English move ...

Can one make anything of the obscene German 'voegeln' for f--k, screw, in
Langenscheidt's (1984) Taschenwoerterbuch as indicating a linguistic
link?  Is there any parallel in German slang?

Subject: Introduction

My name is Lewis (Leib) Gutman.  I have been trying to teach myself
Yiddish for the last year or so, and have slogged my way through
Weinreich's "College Yiddish".  I can read (very slowly) di Forverts,
with a lot of help from my dictionary, and have picked up four or five
miscellaneous books from the Nat'l Yiddish Book Center.   A problem I
have here in San Diego is that, though there are Yiddish discussion
groups here, they all seem to meet in the middle of a working day.
Because of that, I can't practice with anyone (until now :-). Ich ken
layenen besser vi redn oder shraybn.  Please excuse my spelling and
grammar.  I just ordered Schaechter's intermediate textbook, and that's
my next assignment.

Anyway, I've read a lot of the Mendele archives with gopher over the last
couple of days and enjoyed them a lot.

I grew up on Long Island, and neither of parents spoke very much Yiddish,
just a phrase here and there.  My contact with Yiddish was limited to a
neighbor's father who retired from his profession of kosher butcher.  He
spoke mainly English with my family.

Does anyone have a suggestion for a lexicon of Yiddish slang and
colloquialisms?    Also, does anyone know where I can get (facsimile)
copies of back issues of di Forverts and other Yiddish newspapers?  I'd
like to read issues from before World War I.

Looking forward to reading the next issue of mendele,

Zei gezunt,

Lew Gutman

Subject: Introduction

My name is David Perlmutter - I'm a theoretical linguist, now at the
University of Rochester.  I've been "lurking" on mendele for a while now,
so it is high time I introduced myself.

I spoke Yiddish for a very brief period in my childhood - a brief
exposure for a matter of months when I was four, then for a year or so
when I was six.  My first and strongest language was English, which was
the sole language of the household all the time I was growing up.  My
periods of exposure to Yiddish were the times we lived with my
grandparents, who spoke only English at home.  But the people who came to
the house - writers, poets, theatre people, educators - they all spoke
Yiddish. So I quickly got the message:  English was an everyday language,
a "kitchen language," while Yiddish was the language of High Culture! And
I went to a Yiddish school besides during that period, with the result
that I now read Yiddish reasonably fluently, though I haven't really
spoken it for a long, long time.

Reading mendele has been a wonderful experience.  Like so many others, I
had thought Yiddish was moribund, if not altogether dead.  And the truth
is that most of us are not members of a community where the language is
used.  Who would have thought that the Internet would CREATE a community
that would enable the language to go on living for those of us who have
no other contacts with it!
