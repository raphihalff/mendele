Subject: Persecution of linguists and philologists

I would like to draw your attention to a fascinating book which may not
be noticed, because it is not about language, although it is concerned
with linguistics (and it is written in German).

MAAS, Utz: Verfolgung und Auswanderung deutschsprachiger
Sprachforscher 1933--1945. Band 1: Einleitung und
biobibliographische Daten A-F. -- Osnabrueck: Secolo 1996.
ISBN: 3-929979-23-3. 288pp. DEM 98 (about 60 USD).

As the title says, the book deals with the ``persecution and emigration
of German-speaking language researchers'' during the period of Nazi rule
in Europe. The first 157 pages give a general overview about the people
involved, about the political background, the events and their
consequences. It becomes obvious that the present aspect of the language
sciences was largely determined by the described events. Of course, the
main focus of the book is on Germany and Austria, but the consequences
for the development of the field in the US are discussed as well (esp.
pp. 36-41).

The second part of the book contains the biographies of persecuted
language researchers. Not surpringly, there are among them a great
number of Yiddishists and Hebraists. In this first volume, only the
letters A-F (47 biographies) are treated in depth (although the
biographical data of other people can be retrieved from the huge
apparatus of 774 notes). In the preface, the author leaves it open
whether a second volume containing 131 biographies will appear. The
reason for using the unfamiliar term ``language researchers'' comes from
the difficulty to clearly attribute the majority of the scholars to one
specific field. Until the middle of the century, it was not unusual to
work on the borderline of linguistics, philology, and literature (e.g.
E. Auerbach, K. and H. Collitz, or L. Spitzer) or in even wider fields
of investigation (e.g. K. Buehler or E.A. Cassirer).  In spite of their
sometimes impressive contribution to the field, some of them are hardly
known nowadays.

The author studied not only published material, but mainly relied on
personal interviews, public and private archives, unpublished or hardly
accessible material. His provocative, but well documented approach makes
the book highly readable.

Subject: "A keselgarten!"

The Yiddish term "keselgarten", meaning a busy, crowded or disorderly
place, evidently derives its meaning from the New York immigrant
processing center that was the predecessor of Ellis Island. My father,
while watching the Ellis Island special on TV the other night remarked,
"So that's where they get the term Kessel Garden from."

Although  Castle Garden is not the same as Ellis Island, it is located
on the  mainland near where the ferry  departs to Ellis Island.  It was
located at the lower tip of Manhattan at the western part of the Battery
in Battery Park.  It was originally the nation's largest concert hall.
From 1855 to 1890, it had been an immigrant processing center run by NY
State.  Approximately 7.7 million immigrants were processed there.

Castle Garden was closed prior to Ellis Island due to scandals and
immigrant processing was  transferred to federal control.  First, from
1890 to 1892, to the Barge  Office.  Then, beginning in 1892, to Ellis
Island.

Subject: Yiddish love phrases

Stanley Wernick [6.206] asks about love phrases in Yiddish.

The following phrases that pertain to love are all taken from Yiddish
songs, either title or first line.

libste[r] mayne[r]--my dearest one

Bay mir bistu sheyn--to me you're beautiful!
Bay mir hostu kheyn--to me you're charming!

Fun vanen heybt zikh on a libe?--how does love [a love affair begin?]

Farvos dergeystu mir di yorn?--why. are you driving me mad?

Lomir zikh iberbetn--let's make up  [and be friends or lovers?]

Lomir beyde a libe shpiln--let's both have a love affair [more  refined?]--
let's fall in love.

In mayn hartsn brent a  fayer--in my heart a fire burns-- [it's flaming love,
of course]

Oy Avrom, ikh ken on dir nit zayn--oy Avrom, [substitute any name]I can't be
[live] without you.

Sheyn bistu, oytser lebn, azoy vi loyter gold--you are beautiful, dear
treasure  [,as beautiful] as pure gold.]!

Di fayerdike libe, vos tut in hartsn brenen--the fiery love that in my heart
doth burn [an old song, obviously]

Mayn tayer zis lebn--my dear, sweet life [love]!

Ikh hob dikh lib, vi a peysakhdikn rosl--I love you , like a passover brine,
Fun mir, dayn khaver Yosl.[ I know the tune to this song, but only these two
lines, and I've never tasted a borsht made from a peysakhdiker rosl--all
kinds of sincere love].

I can imagine seeing these messages [in Yiddish , of course,]   on those
little heart-shaped valentine candies that always appeared in February. Good
luck in your  Yiddish class!
