Subject: Shpiliter

Morrie Feller's note on 'shpiliter' [6.207: 4] asks about it's
"anomalous" plural in -n.  Harkavy (1928) p. 515 lists the word, though
with a cross-reference to 'ekspediter' in place of a definition which
might have provided information on its plural. Anomalous it's not. There
are a number of Yiddish words in -er that take an -n plural, including
oyern, toyern, poyern (as well as poyerim), numern, federn, totern.

Subject: Shpiliter

In regard to the -n plural of "shpiliter," my friend morrie
feller misquotes me slightly (Vol.6.207):

What I said was that in Yiddish the plural of a male "-er" noun
indicating a profession is usually null or -s (e.g.
"shrayber/shraybers").  "er" nouns in other categories can have an "-n"
plural:  e.g. "tsimern", "shvestern" (the latter can also have a null
plural--perhaps in imitation of the plural for professions or in
imitation of "bruder/brider?. The "e" in "shvester" couldn't get
umlauted because the late Germanic e>i Umlaut stopped being productive
but left German with conjugations like "Ich gebe/du gi(e)bst", or
compare Yiddish "gebm" (infinitive with partial assimilation of n > m
after b) but "er git" etc.)

"Shpiliter/-n) is a mystery to me both	in singular and in plural.

Inincidentally:  the "er" ending in profession nouns like "shrayber" and
"milner" goes back--via German--to the latin ending "-arius".  It
shouldn't be confused with the homonymous "er" ending for masculine
nouns indicating geographic origin: "varshever," "londoner",
"shveytser":  these go back, via medieval German, to a proto-Teutonic
genitive ending of a collective singular.  In regard to usage, they
imitate German in that they can be used both as nouns and as adjectives:
er iz a varshaver = er ist (ein) Warschauer der varshaver dialekt = die
Warschauer Mundart but in English they can be used only as nouns: He is
a New Yorker but: the New York dialect. the exception to this rule in
(at least American) English is a Yiddishism for identifying hasidic
rabbis and sometimes yeshivas:  the Bratslever rebbe, the Satmarer
yeshiva. On the other hand, American Yiddish speakers talk about the
"Boston rebbe" as well as the "Bostoner rebbe."

Subject: Halevay

In answer to David Braun's query concerning the song 'Halevay'
[6,207:5], there is a very spirited rendition with several verses on the
lp 'Freylekh zol zayn/ Vesyolej igraj' by the Ansambl Evrejskoj Narodnoj
Pesni "Feyerlekh (sic)" , Melodija C30 19595 001

Subject: Yiddish story-telling

Various people suggested contacting you about a project that I am
working on for a class here at Knox College in Galesburg IL.  I am
curious about Yiddish story telling and how these stories have been
passed on through out the years.  My big question is this...Have any of
you been told Yiddish stories, either in Yiddish or English, by your
parents or grandparents? If so, which ones stick out in your minds, how
were they told to you, have you passed them on, and any other
interesting factoids you can share about these stories...If any of you
have access to posting this as a question anywhere, that would be great!
I would love to chat with anyone via email about their experiences.
Also, if the stories have not been told to you, is there a reason why?
for example, assimilation, or that just wasn't something that your
family did, etc. Thanks so much for any help or suggestions of
literature that you can offer!
