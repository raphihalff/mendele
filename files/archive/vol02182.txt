Subject: Lehavdil Turkish?

I am sure I am not the only person responding to
Herzog's comment that 'lehavdil' may be of Turkish
origin!  That's certainly a stunner. I am sure a survey
of 1000 yiddish speakers would produce 1000 respondents
who believed that it was from Hebrew :-)  Enlightenment
sorely required on this point.

Meylekh.

Subject: Lehavdil Turkish?

In a recent issue, Mikhl Herzog notes that "l'havdil"
came to Yiddish from Turkish.  Considering the rather
striking resemblance of the term to the Hebrew term
that would be similarly transliterated, I wonder
whether he could give more details of the Turkish
derivation.

Bob Werman: Sad to think you really thought I meant
that "lehavdil" was of Turkish origin. The culprits
were the quotation marks. Please reread my message as
"yarmulke" and, probably, lehavdil "pots". Better, no?

Mikhl.

Subject: skirt

first of all, could someone tell me the yiddish word
for "skirt", the noun, women's garment???

secondly, she wants to brush up on her yiddish reading.
could you suggest some interesting yiddish publications
to subscribe to.  by the way, my sister is an attorney,
so perhaps there is material in her field in yiddish.

Subject: Reminder re Yidish-vokh

MENDELE readers who are starting to make plans for the
summer might wish to set aside time to attend
Yugntruf's Yidish-vokh, which runs for a week and
usually finishes the day after Labour Day.  (Not
everyone stays till the last day.)  It's held at the
Bronx House - Emanuel Adult Vacation Center in Copake
NY, a couple of hours straight north from NYC, near the
Massachusetts border in the Berkshires.  The setting is
idyllic (on a beautiful private lake), the food is
kosher, and the price is ridiculously cheap (last year
was something like US$170 per person for the whole
week).

The camp is a Jewish seniors' camp throughout the
summer, with about 120 spaces.  For the last week of
the summer each year, the camp makes about 50 of those
spaces available to Yugntruf, the NYC-based "young
Yiddish speakers" association.  As the Yugntruf group,
we organize our own activities, but we're also around
the seniors all the time, which is nice because most of
them speak Yiddish (and they enjoy meeting young people
who do).

The week is basically a vacation week in Yiddish
immersion.  We eat, swim, boat, play volleyball, etc.,
all in Yiddish, and there are a range of lectures and
games scheduled. (Last year Simone & I ran a Yiddish
version of the TV game show "TalkAbout" one evening.)
Many of the participants are young families like us who
are raising our children solely in Yiddish.  Some are
older, singles, etc.

We've gone every year since 1989 and it's the highlight
of our summer. A number of other regular MENDELE
contributors also come.

It's a great way to spend a week.  If you have some
fluency in Yiddish, or want to meet a raft of little
kids who play in Yiddish with each other, consider
making time for Yidish-vokh.  The specific details
aren't out yet (maybe Dovid Braun can tell us?).
Yugntruf's phone number in NYC is (212) 787-6675.

I'm still hoping that our shamus Noyekh will be able to
at least come and visit the camp for a day, so we can
meet in person.
