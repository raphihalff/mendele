Dear Fellow Yiddish Researchers!

I am pleased to announce the organization of te Yiddish Research Network.
The main goal of the YRN is to provide information to researchers about
the scholarly activities of others in all fields relating to Yiddish
literature, linguistics, cultural history, folklore, etc.

The concept of the network arose through discussions at the conference on
Yiddish and Ashkenazic Studies at the Ohio State University in Columbus
earlier this year.  The YRN will be managed jointly by graduate students
at OSU and at the University of Texas at Austin.

Our initial task will be to compile a directory containing the following
information about members:

1- Name, address, e-mail
2- Areas of particular expertise
3- Publications (past and pending)
4- Unpublished papers, theses, essays, etc.

The YRN Directory will be distributed in hard-copy form by postal mail.
It will be updated annually.

We have chosen not to go "on-line" for two important reasons.  First, we
feel that Mendele is the only electronic network required for Yiddish; it
provides a valuable and ample forum for direct contact among Yiddish
researchers.  Second, we believe there are many researchers around the
world who are not "hooked up" at this point, and we wish to include
everyone who wishes to be included. therefore, we will communicate with
and distribute information to members primarily through regular postal
mail, although announcements will also be made on Mendele (with the
permission of Mendele's shames, of course!).

Due to the costs of various materials and postage, we must ask a
subscription fee for the Yiddish Research Network.  The subscription
price will be US$5.00 (donations will also be gratefully accepted).  We
will attempt to make arrangements for payment within the European
Community, Israel and other countries by May of 1996.  Checks are to be
made payable to the University of Texas at Austin.  The YRN is sponsored
by the Department of Germanic Languages at the University of Texas at
Austin and supported solely by membership fees. All funds received are
used only for materials and postage.

To subscribe, please send the following information to The Yiddish
Research Network, Department of Germanic Languages and Literatures, The
University of Texas at Austin, E.P. Schoch 3.102, Austin, TX 78712.
Information should be written as you would like it to apear n the YRN
Directory.  The YRN Directory will be updated and distributed annually.
Deadline for inclusion in the 1996 YRN Directory 1996: January 31, 1996.

Subject: Children and future of Yiddish

In mendele vol.5.102 Morrie Feller touched on a very sore subject. I too
have been attending Yiddish cultural events, where the average age is
"deceased". However I'm a little more optimistic than you (maybe it's
because I live in Toronto). In contrast to what I wrote above, at the
Ashkenaz festival we just had here, I was more than pleasantly surprised
by large numbers of under 40's that where there.  So there is some hope.
As to how you get the Federations, bureaus of education etc. to adopt a
Yiddish program, I'm afraid you run into a brick wall of "budget". We all
know the difficulty now in fund raising. Does it mean the communities
hold back even more from their overseas contributions?  To hear some
Israelis speak, it may be o.k. But I have my doubts that the local
balebotim will surender their turf that readily.  Most of the university
programs are privately endowed, how successfuly that can be carried over
to day-school, and congregational schools makes me dubious. I hope I'm
wrong. Nevertheless you performed a mitsve by bringing this subject into
the open.

Re [Zellig Bach's] joke about the school director [5.106], I was told the
very same joke (in English) by a Spanish friend from Barcelona, and he
knew it as a Spanish, or possibly Catalan joke.  Oh, well... the
Barcelonians seem to like to think of themselves as Jewish... (!)

Another Murray Banks favorite:

It's early morning and some Jewish men are arriving at the shul to pray;
one by one they arrive, but they end up with only 9, and you need 10 to
make a minyan. The cleaning lady scopes out the situation, points out her
finger and nods her head, "Ikh vel aykh krign a tsentn." She goes outside
and grabs the first guy that passes and says: "Mister, vi volt ir
geglikhn zayn der tsenter? The man looks aghast and says, "Mises, ikh
volt afile nisht gevolt zayn der ershter!"

Also, btw, the use of the word glaykhn is also attested to in American
German, as gleichen. I *think* H.L. Mencken, but I'm not 100% sure.
