Subject: Spelling and neshome

[regarding Marjorie Hirshan's post, 10.010]

Ellen Prince (10.015) writes:

     If the publisher is YIVO, then I guess one would expect the spelling to
     be changed; if it isn't, then it would just be chutzpah (aka khutspe),
     in my opinion.

Khutspe we expect from YIVO. But from someone else! A khutspe that they
should be so khutspedik! ;-)

My relatively uninformed impression is that the spelling in different works
by the same Yiddish author can vary widely, even if they were written and
published at about the same time. So I'd have to ask, to what extent was the
spelling in early editions determined by the editor or publisher, rather
than the author?

Is the manuscript or first edition always the best text? Yes, variant
spellings and word choices lend flavor to a text, but they can also make for
rough reading.

Perhaps the choice of spellings for a new edition of a classic work should
depend in part on the current editor's judgement about what will best serve
the needs and expectations of the target audience. There may even be cases
where the author intended to achieve or even create a standard usage, where
it would be a khutspe not to help fulfill that intention by exercising a
little bit of editorial judgement.

Subject: Spelling and neshome

The Chaucer analogy is somewhat misleading, as Ellen Prince has pointed out
(10.015), since Chaucer wrote in Middle English, which is not readily
understandable to modern readers; it requires translation, not merely
respelling.  A better example (also provided by Marjorie Hirshan) would be
Shakespeare, who wrote Modern English.  Although many features of modern
English spelling preserve aspects of Middle English pronunciation that have
long disappeared or evolved, as Geoffrey Nathan has pointed out, there has
been a lot of change in spelling conventions since Shakespeare's time.
(Perhaps the "English spelling system was frozen about three hundred years
ago", as he says, but Shakespeare was writing *four* hundred years ago, and
the Great Vowel Shift was old news at that time, so there is no real
causative connection there.  I think there has been a continuous evolution,
but it has slowed down over the centuries under the influence of universal
education and widespread literacy.)

Facsimile editions of Shakespeare's folio and quartos are available and are
of interest, not only to scholars, but to those readers who relish the
flavor of the original editions.  The spelling is *often* different from the
modern standard and often inconsistent.  After all, Shakespeare spelled his
own name in several different ways in the surviving signatures (Shakspere,
Shaxper, etc.).  The punctuation and capitalization conventions are
different also, as is the typography (use of the long "s", for instance).
These can be fascinating to a certain kind of reader, but of course most
editions of Shakespeare conform to modern conventions in order to
accommodate a general readership.  (There have been editions that went even
further and modernized the diction and references, in order to accommodate
an even more general readership, but this practice has usually been
deprecated.)

This may be a reasonable guide for Yiddish.  In most cases, what is needed
is standard orthography.  However, there may be sufficient interest in
certain classic works to have them published in editions that preserve more
of their original flavor.

But is there a special problem with Yiddish, in that there is no universally
accepted standard?  Ellen Prince takes a stand against universally
YIVO-izing the spelling.  She seems to feel that Yiddish spelling has often
been a form of personal expression on the part of the writer.  I can't
comment on that, but I don't agree with her generalization that "in other
speech communities it is usually the (eminent) writers that *become the
model* for spelling!"  Shakespeare and Milton and Shaw may have influenced
English literary style and diction, but I think that Noah Webster (for
instance) has had more effect on American spelling than any of our writers.

I suppose I'm arguing for standards, but with flexibility and with
significant exceptions.

Sholem Aleichem is buried in Mt. Carmel Cemetary in Ridgewood, Queens, New
York. The insciption on the stone is in Yiddish.

============

Firstly, I hope that Mr. Toker was compensated for his translation.
Secondly, it would be nice to see it on mendele in its Yiddish translation
(with the English/Original, of course).

However, it pains me that Mr. Toker tells us this sad fact when it's too
late to do something...

It may be, that we could have worked through official channels, that Yiddish
could have been recognized for this publication. Several factors may have
influenced this: 1) several years ago (1990? - I don't remember the exact
date) Yiddish was recognized by the UNESCO as an important language; 2) in
1996 (I believe) Yiddish was officially recognized by the European
Parliament as a European language; 3) in 1996, both Yiddish and Ladino were
recognized by the Israeli Parliament as National languages of the Jewish
People and the State of Israel.

It may be, that if the Hanover office which handled this issue had received
official letters from these organizations (EU, kneset,UNESCO), or copies of
the protocols or news reports, this would have helped. Next time, I hope,
we'll be smarter.

Oh, I forgot the most important, that Yiddish has already been recognized
since the 1920's as one of the Official (or National) languages of
Birobidzhan...

Thanks to Yankev, Elye, Naomi and Dovid. "Der Yid" is using present-tense
terms "Barikht = Report" and "Oyskuk = View/Outlook". "Outlook" is as close
as they may get to "telling the future", since that's God's territory...

Subject: Loyvitsh

May parents who came from Lodz, Poland, used to say: Ikh hob dikh in
Loyvitsh. I found out that Loyvitsh was a town not too far from Lodz, with
the biggest cemetery at the time of the curse, which meant, drop dead.

Subject: komerne

A guess regarding khaver Cooperman's request (10.017):

A corruption of the Russian: 'khmirneh' meaning dark, cloudy, forbidding.

A likely metaphor for whatever 'prison' or point of dentention that his
relatives were being taken to.

Subject: komerne

bernard d. cooperman asks what's komerne. it comes from polish komorne and
it's the rent you pay to the owner (every month or week)  for  your flat.
the other way to say it in yiddish is dire geld.

My friend, Josh Fishman suggested I contact you for an opinion about the
origin of the expression, "When you are in love the whole world is Jewish."
My uninformed guess is in the title of this email. Thanks in advance for any
assistance you are able to provide.
