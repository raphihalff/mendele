Subject: Info on Leib Fischtein

I am looking for information about my father in-law Leib Fischtein.
Around 1922-1923 He worked for the Yiddish news paper Folks-Tsaytung in
Warsaw. Years later he freelanced to Yiddish news papers in the U.S.
mainly in N.Y. If you have any ideas of where I may be able to look for
any of his pieces I would be forever grateful.

Thank you in advance
Tova Fischtein

Subject: Janet Hadda's article

Dear Mendele readers,

I remember having read recently (I believe, but am no longer sure, on
Mendele) of Janet Hadda's publication of her article "Yiddish in
today's America" (orig. published in the Jewish Quarterly, no.170,
Summer 1998 and re"printed" on Mendele on 13 and 20 May, 1999) being
referred to as a "defection" (presumably from the cause of
Yiddishism?). Can someone please point me to the proper citation?

A more general question: Is it possible to do full text searches of
back issues of Mendele, or only of the subject headings? If so, how?

Thanks,

Joel Rubin

[Moderator's note: The Mendele discussion in question is mentioned by
Sholem Berger in his review of Joshua Fishman's article "A Decade in
the Life of a Two-in-One Language: Yiddish in New York City (Secular
and Ultra-Orthodox)" in TMR Vol 05.006. The full quote from the
Fishman's article is following:

  May 1999: A cause-sensationelle was the 'desertion' of Janet Hadda, a
  well known and highly regarded Yiddish professor (at UCLA), writer,
  translator and literary critic. She published her doubts about the
  future of Yiddish in America (and her psychoanalytic interpretation
  of the unwillingness of admirers of the language to accept the death
  thereof) in JQ (Jewish Quarterly, one of the very best Anglo-Jewish
  literary and cultural journals today). Her article was then carried
  in toto in Mendele, the main Yiddish-interest e-mail bulletin board,
  together with the moderator's rejection of Hadda's theses, and then
  Hadda's response to that rejection. Thereafter for many days, Mendele
  was practically monopolised by reader critiques of (and far more
  rarely, agreements with) Hadda's point of view, methodology and data.
  What made the situation even more poignant was the fact that similar
  noteworthy desertions had occurred in previous years (most visibly,
  that of Professor Ruth Wisse, at Harvard). Several of New York's most
  visible 'Mendelyaner' participated in the e-mail storm.

  From "Can threatened languages be saved? : reversing language shift,
  revisited: a 21st century perspective / edited by Joshua A. Fishman.

On the second question: the full text search of the Mendele archives is
temporarily unavailable due to the software replacement on the server.

Subject: New English Translation of Gebirtig

I would like to bring Mendleyvers' attention to a just-published book
of new translations of 88 Mordekhay Gebirtig Yiddish poems and song
lyrics. The translator is Simcha Simchovich, no doubt well known to
many members as an award winning Yiddish poet and writer. He has also
provided a 15 p. introduction to Gebiritg and his poetry, which
includes bibliographical details about Gebirtig's publications. Most of
the poems & lyrics were originally published in: Folkstimlekh (Cracow,
1920), Mayne Lider (Vilna, 1936), and S'Brent (Cracow, 1946). The
publication details are:

 The Song That Never Died; The Poetry of Mordecai Gebirtig. Translation
  and introduction, by Simcha Simchovich. Oakville, Ont.: Mosiac
  Press, 2001. (vi), xv, 154 p. ISBN: 0889627487 ($14 USD, $19 CND).

Mosaic Press may be reached at: mosaicpress@on.aibn.com and I hasten to
add that I have no commercial interest in this book or its publisher!

Subject: Alter Esselin's web site

The web site I created devoted to the Yiddish poet Alter Esselin (my
father) was not available for two months (malfunctioning of the server
operation) It is NOW back in business (http://www.esselin.com)!
Understandably, nobody is accessing it right now because people got
tired of being told it is not available. I would very much appreciate
your sending the word that it is back in business,

In response to Edward Cherlin [11.010]:

Se shteyt inem dokument vos me hot oybn dermont az di iberzetsung iz fun

It is stated in the above referenced document that the translation is by
Sholem Berger, not Refoyl Finkel, although both of these people work on
creating "Der Bavebter Yid," the online Yiddish journal which published it.
Sholem Berger is also the editor of the journal.

Subject: Romeo & Juliet

In response to Itsik Goldenberg [11.011]:

Funnily enough, someone gave me a copy of _The Complete Idiot's Guide
to Learning Yiddish_ (Rabbi Benjamin Blech, Alpha Books: Indianapolis,
2000) and on pages 259-260 is a transcription of that dialogue in
Yiddish.

Subject: Death as a musician

Yael Chaver asked about the figure of Death personified as a musician
in a poem by Rikuda Potash [11.011].

Not sure about its antecedents, but whatever they are, they're probably
at work in the wonderful last couplet of Anna Margolin's "Mari un der
toyt":

        un foroys iz gegangen farbenkterheyt
        der yingling toyt mit der tunkeler fleyt.
        ("And the boy named Death went in front,
        longingly, with his dark flute.")

Good luck, and I"d love to hear the results of your search!  Best,

Larry Rosenwald

Subject: Yiddish plays

My grandfather, born in Horodishtsh, White Russia, in 1908, remembers
seeing traveling theater troupes pass through his town.  He thinks they
came from Vilna.

Two performances from his childhood stand out in his memory: one was a
Purim- shpil-type dramatization of the biblical story of the selling of
Joseph by his brothers -- he remembers it as "Yoysef mit di Brider" or
simply "Mekhiles Yoysef"; the other was called "Khashe di Yesoyme."

Perhaps these plays are too generic to identify (biblical stories in
particular must have been dramatized many times), but I'm interested in
finding out more about these works if possible.  I would appreciate any
ideas or suggestions other could share.

Jacob Gordin apparently wrote a play in America called "Di Yesoyme,"
published around 1903 (I'm not sure if Gordin's orphan was named
Khashe, as I haven't been able to access a copy yet).  Is it likely (or
possible) that this work made its way back to the old country?

Subject: Trilingual database in French, Hebrew and Yiddish?

A colleague is trying to develop a trilingual database of books and
other material in French, Hebrew and Yiddish, and would very much be
interested in learning what experience institutions as well as
individuals are having in this regards.  Currently, the platform is
Windows - I am not certain however whether it is 95, 98, NT, ME or
2000.

Thanks in advance for any correspondence in this regard.
