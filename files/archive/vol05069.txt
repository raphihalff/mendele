[Re: Mikhl Herzog's inquiry 5.068]

We always used the word "nitl", which must be the yiddish form of the
roman term "natale".

Subject: Makh a fayg

I'm trying to find the source and story about a little child who is
advised by a parent to "makh a fayg" whenever he is frightened by a bad
person or circumstance.

A dank aykh ale.

Subject: Shlepn nakhes

Neyekh Zide (mendele 5.068) asks for an English adult example matching
dining needle for darning needle.  I have always maintained that the
phrase ivy tower  for academic seclusion  is a corrupted form of ivied
tower, such as those which mark Oxford & Cambridge.  In the Bronx, half a
century ago, the kids who went to Bronx Park or to summer camp were
afraid of catching poison ivory, and the Oxford English Dictionary
recognizes ivory as a dialectic form of ivy.  Ivied tower is almost
impossible to say, except by a special effort, because of the
juxtaposition of the d and the t.

I had also thought that the phrase was shlepn nakhes until I studied
German in college and came upon schoepfen .I still don't know which makes
more sense.

Subject: Simcha-Bunim

I have always understood that the name "Bunim" in Simcha-Bunim is a
corruption of the French name "Bonhomme," i. e. good man, and is an
example of the Romance influence in Yiddish proper names. Simcha-Bunim
was a popular name among Yiddish-speaking Jews because it was the name of
one of the great rabbis (I think it was the Vurker rebbe, but I could be
wrong. Or possibly the Przyscher rebbe.)

Subject: Bunim

Helen Abeles asked about the derivation of Bunim in a recent post.  I had
the honor of attending a lecture given by the late Rabbi Shmuel Gorr
(author of "Jewish Personal Names:  Their Origin, Derivation, and
Diminutive Forms",  Avotaynu, Inc., 1992) at the Jewish Genealogy Seminar
held in Chicago in 1984.  At that time, Rabbi Gorr used "Bunim" as the
example of the derivation of "typical" Jewish names and I remember the
explanation as it is the name of my great-great grandfather.

He traced Bunim back to the Hebrew "Shem Tov' or good name.  As Jews
moved to Spain, they translated the Hebrew into Spanish for "good name"
(I can't remember the Spanish).  As Jews moved north into France after
the Inquisition, they changed the name to French - "Bon Nom" for "good
name."  In time, as the Jews moved east to Germany, Poland, etc., they
began to use Yiddish and with this change in accent, Bon Nom became
Bunim.

I hope this explanation helps.

Subject: Yiddish nowadays

David Herskovic and Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan have both recently
commented on Noyekh Miller's remark that "bad Yiddish abounds and in
surprising places", pointing out that the communities where Yiddish is
the most vigorous are not necessarily those where it is most
conservative.

Here's another perspective:

As a linguist, with an attempt toward scientific objectivity, I think
that it's probably inevitable that Yiddish in the ultra-orthodox
community will go through a period of rapid change, given that this
community doesn't take purity of language (wrt Yiddish) as a goal in
itself.  The kinds of change, and the way the new system stabilizes, are
very interesting topics to study. No one outside the community has any
particular right to interfere with the changes, much less the influence
to do so.

But I think it's also inevitable that some of those changes will seem
appalling to speakers of more conservative forms of Yiddish. This also is
part of the nature of language. Why, in English some people have based
their whole careers on expressing of dismay at changes in the language
;-) Although I scorn a number of unrealistic prescriptive rules that
schoolteachers tried to enforce on my English, nevertheless I shudder
when I hear younger people saying things that _I_ wouldn't say. (I could
give examples, but will restrain myself.) This horror at the fact that
other people say things differently than you do is just as natural in
Yiddish as it is in English.

For most of us it's a little trickier in Yiddish, since most of us have
heard Yiddish only from a narrow circle of speakers; an expression may be
very wide-spread, and still be unfamiliar to us. This leads to one of our
favorite kinds of discussion on Mendele ;-) "My parents don't/didn't say
it that way, therefore no one does (or should)." Oh, well, it happens;
sometimes I tell someone some expression is wrong, only to find Sholem
Aleykhem using it ;-(

But when undzer shames Noyekh calls something "bad Yiddish", I'm inclined
to believe him! :-)

And I think we can be quietly appalled at some of the Yiddish that comes
from one source or another, even though we're delighted at the fact that
they're using Yiddish.

To quote David Herskovic's lovely way of putting it: "All the scholarly
discussions of the language do not make up for a few weeks of buying,
selling, loving, hating, laughing, crying, phoning, faxing, blessing,
cursing all in mameloshn." As the flyer for Yugntruf's "yidish-vokh" this
year says: Beser a tsebrokhn yidish vi a gut english!  But that doesn't
mean the Yugntrufnikes aren't trying to improve their yiddish.

Nu, genug shoyn! mertseshem vel ikh shraybn dos kumedike mol _oyf_
yidish, un nisht nor vegn yidish!

Subject: Khotsh, again

Yankel Gerger has asked for examples of usage of "khotsh".

Ikh  dermon zikh fun a kinderlid vos geyt azoy:

	Eyns un tsvey un dray un fir
	Vos mir zaynen, zaynen mir
	_Khotsh_ mir zaynen yung un kleyn
	Vi di heldn darf men geyn

	A fisl, gib her a fisl
	Un shtayfer, shtayfer - shtayfer a bisl
	Shpan, shpan shtolts
	Shpan shtolts un ziker
	Di keplakh hekher, hekher, hekher.
