Subject: Yiddish in liturgy

In the New Union Prayerbook "Gates of Repentance" for the Days of Awe,
there are included in the meditations part of the Yom Kippur afternoon
service the first two verses of "Zawg nit keyn mol" in the original
Yiddish followed by an English translation. This past Yom Kippur my wife
and I read these verses from the bimah so that they were indeed part of
the service.

Subject: Kheshbn/khezhbm

In my childhood I always understood my parents to say "khezhme". Has
anyone else heard this variant? (The first I heard of "khezhbon" was
recently in Jerusalem).

Subject: Textbooks in prewar Poland

Lisa Tomlinson asked about ha-Signon ha-Ivri textbook [6.198]. The
author, Magnus Krinski (1863-1916) wrote several Hebrew textbooks that
were published many times in both hemispheres. Among them "ha-signon
ha-ivri: kurs gavoha le-limud ha-safah ha-ivrit ve-safrutah" (Varshah:
ha-Or, 1922, 11th edition) and "Reshit daat sefath eber" (New York:
Druckerman, 1926, 25th edition).

To answer Lisa's question about Yiddish textbooks we don't have to look
far away. Magnus Krinski wrote "Der idish lehrer" (Varshe: Bikher far
ale, 1920, 4th edition) and "Ertsihung: finf kapitlekh iber der
ertsihung fun idishe kinder" (Varshe: Bikher far ale, 1908). He also
co-authored "Literatur visenshaft: lehrbukh far di idishe un algemeyne
literatur teorye" (Varshe: Bikher far ale, 1908).

As to the level of old textbooks (btw, why "it is striking that such a
fine text was actually taught ... in Poland"? Whose inferiority implied
in the remark? Polish Jews? Tsar's censors?), Shtetl's library has
selections from two Yiddish primers:

Eliezer Steinbarg, Alef Beys (Czernowitz: Kultur, 1921) -
http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/Book/alefbeys.html and Yaakov Levin, Der
onfanger (New York: Idishe Shul, 1922) -
http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/Book/onfanger.html

Compare them to your firstgrader's textbook today. Results may provoke
some thinking.

Subject: Jewish English or "Hebonics"

Further examples of Hebonics:

Standard English:  May I take your plate sir?
Hebonics:  You've hardly touched your food!  What's the matter, there's
something wrong with it?

In case of a mother or grandmother answering the phone:
Standard English:  It's been so long since you've called...
Hebonics:  You didn't wonder if I'm dead yet?

Subject: Mauscheln

Mikhl Herzog's translation [6.197] [of the 17th century poem] renders
the last line:

  das Mauschel
  und ein Jud ein Ding sey."

as:

  The Mauschel
  and that a Jew is a thing" [object?]

The last line is a literal translation. It more likely means: "or that
Mauschel and a Jew is one and the same."

Regarding the word mauscheln: I've heard it used for a card game for
money in which you start with a very low amount and the nature of the
game increases this to horrendous sums very fast.  Has anyone come
across this game?

Subject: Mauscheln

To two eminent cousins are discussed in Volume 6.197, both on the
subject of "Mauscheln."  Mikhl Herzog mentions Nicolas Slonimsky, the
musician/writer, who died just one year ago at the age of 101; and
Michael Steinlauf discusses Antoni Slonimski, the poet.  They were both
grandsons of Hayim Zelig Slonimski, scientist, inventor, and founding
editor of HaZefirah, the long-running Hebrew newspaper published
intermittently from Warsaw and then Berlin.

With all respect to Herzog, however, I believe the 1909 criticism of
Mahler that Slonimsky cites does not actually use the word _Mauscheln_.
The language is nonetheless revealing.  Slonimsky gives both the
original German and his English translation:

[The music] "... _juedelt_.  Das heisst:  sie spricht musikalisches
Deutsch, aber mit dem Akzent, mit dem Tonfalle und vor allem auch mit
der Geste des oestlichen, des allzu oestlichen Juden."

"...it _acts_ Jewish.  This is to say that it speaks musical German, but
with an accent, with an inflection, and above all, with the gestures of
an eastern, all too eastern Jew."  (Lexicon of Musical Invective, p.
121; _italics_ in the original.)

Following the Slonimsky reference, Herzog also quotes from Max
Weinreich's citation of Johann Christof Wagenseil, the German
philologist and encyclopedist.  There exists a small but important
literature on how heavily composer Richard Wagner drew upon another work
of Wagenseil for the vocabulary and historical detail of "Die
Meistersinger."

Regrettably, since the first performances many have argued that the
opera's antagonist, Beckmesser, was intended as an anti-Semitic
stereotype.  He is portrayed with a crabbed and awkward musical style --
to say nothing of his pedantic and uninspired pronouncements on the art
of music -- and it is widely argued that the opera is, among other
things, the artistic counterpart to "On the Jewish in Music," Wagner's
infamous and immensely influential anti-Semitic prose tract which he
re-issued soon after Meistersinger's premiere.  In this essay, Wagner
advances the view that Jews are intrinsically incompatible with European
society.  Though I don't believe he uses the word _Mauscheln_, his point
of departure is precisely what he characterizes as Jews' offensive,
alien pronunciation of German, how that indelibly taints their music
and, by extension, all other arts they may pursue.  Beyond being the
prototype for the kind of musical criticism Slonimsky cited, this essay
was a seminal work in the broader history of German ideological
anti-Semitism, and the concept of _Mauscheln_ -- if not the word itself
-- plays no small role in its central rationale.

In his book "Wagner & Wagenseil" (1927), Herbert Thompson translates
into English from Wagner's early plot notes for the opera, occasionally
inserting in brackets [ ] the composer's original German term.  In the
description of the rules of the singing contest, which forms the central
core of the plot, we encounter the following, reproduced exactly as
Thompson has printed it.

[In the event of a tie, the contestants must] '...be heard again, until
the honour of 'winning belongs to one, and he is found to have been
guilty 'of fewer mistakes than the others, or else has made no slips 'at
all, and is therefore said to have sung smoothly '[glatt]. 'The prizes
are now awarded...' etc.

Nu?  It's hard not to laugh when you know they didn't allow treyf.
