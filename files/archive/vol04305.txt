Subject: Introduction

Finally abashed by the establishment of a ver-iz-der-doziker, I take
keyboard in hand to identify myself, a lokerer, a tshatever [_lurker_] (I
had to look it up) no more. In my case mame loshen was tate loshen, since
my father, Eliyahu z"l, would speak nothing but Yiddish to me fun
kintveis ohn. Some Mendelyaner may remember him as a teacher at the
Peretz Shule in Winnipeg in the '30s and at the Folk Shule in Chicago in
the '40s. An uncle, Alex Robin z"l, was also active in Yiddish circles.
Unfortunately, my own contact with Yiddish in recent years was minimal,
so Mendele has been a real find. Yeysher koyakh to all!

Subject: Late smarts

In vol.4.300 Adam Weisberger asks for a Yiddish term to denote the
perfect report that comes to mind too late.  This is what I think is
known in Western Europe as l'esprit de l'escalier, staircase-cleverness,
what you think of just after you have left the party.  I believe that in
parts of northern New England (in particular, Vermont) it's called
after-wit.  And I seem to recall a Yiddish term, nokh-vitz or nokh-
khokhme, but that may be an artificial calque from the New England
English.

Subject: Mystery word

Much as I hate to think that there's something Yiddish has not named more
piquantly than any other language, I speculate that the mystery
expression is the French l'esprit d'escalier. But if I may be excused the
khuzpeh (is my transliteration glatt YIVO?) of a neologism, how about
"trepn-hokhme"? And if there is a good Yiddish expression, you may throw
me down that set of stairs, shouting "Trepn-nar!"

Subject: Trep-khokhmes

Adam Weisberger (4.300) asks for a Yiddish expression meaning crushing
retorts thought of, alas, too late to be of use.  Di mame mayne flegt zey
onrufn 'trep-khokhmes', that is, wickedly witty replies that occur to one
on the stairs on the way out of the presence of the opponent--or maybe on
the stairs to one's own home--after the confrontation.  I believe that
the French speak of 'esprits d'escalier'.

Subject: Kharomes

Al Madansky (4.300, 7) cites a collection (_Baym Kval_) of "...
_vintshenishn, kloles, kharomes, simonim, sgules, zabobones_...", and
asks about _kharomes_ and _zabobones_.  I haven't a clue about the
latter, but Weinreich gives, under _khromes_ (khes-reysh-mem-vov-sof),
the expression _kloles un khromes_ 'vehement curses'.  _khromes_ looks
here like a variant plural of _kheyrem_ 'Jew. ban, excommunication',
whose regular plurals Weinreich gives as _kheyrems, kh(a)romim_.

Subject: Zababones

In my family of *true* apekorsim, "zababones" means superstition. To
avoid internecine strife I won't specify just what that could cover.

Subject: Kenen un konen

For what it's worth, here are excerpts from a letter I received last week
from a real live Litvak -- a landsman a Keidaner vos voynt itst in Kovne,
with whom I am having a challenging but rewarding correspondence:

"...Ir darft nit zorgn vegn zayn in Lite. Oyb ir vet mir meldn ven ir
kumen, _kon_ ikh aykh kumen in Vilne bagegenen un breyngen in
Kovne....Men darf in hotel hobn gelt, vet ir hobn a gutn lebn. Far gelt
_kon_ men altz koyfn...Far mir perzenlikh _kont_ ir breyngen nor kafe
<Folgers Coffee Crystals> velkhe men darf nit greytn-kokhn.....Ven bay
undz iz ovnt, _kont_ ir mir onrufn in telefon, un zogn genoy ven ir kumt
..."

Incidentally, can anyone provide guidance as to if and when it might be
appropriate, in a correspondence with someone you've not met in person,
to begin addressing the other party as "du" rather than "ir"?

Subject: Trumbyenik, Eydlmentsh, and Philologos' reliability

Am I the only one who noticed the strange definitions of Yiddish words in
Philologos' column a few weeks ago, on a survey he did of readers'
knowledge of selected Yiddish words?  I no longer have the column in
front of me, but his definitions were from an obscure popular work on
Yiddish, not from Harkavy, Weinreich, or other authorities.

The definitions that most struck me with their eccentricity were
"evil-doer" for "trumbyenik" and "(sarcastic) snob" for "eydlmentsh."
The normal meaning of trumbyenik is something like a blowhard ne'er do
well; I heard "eydlmentsh" used many times in conversation, and always
close to its dictionary, non-sarcastic definition of a sensitive,
refined, spiritually noble person.

This does raise questions about the column's reliability in areas in
which I am even less expert than Yiddish; for example, in a March column
inspired by a Mendele thread (on the word "feygele") "Arschvogel" is
cited as a "common" German pejoritive for a gay male.  Unfortunately,
this word is not found in any of the comprehensive German slang
dictionaries, nor is it known to fluent German speakers of my
acquaintance.

If Philologos is lurking out there, perhaps he can reply--it's an
enjoyable column, and I'm not expecting pedantic exactitude, but at least
reasonable accuracy.  If not, perhaps Reb Mikhl, Reb Zellig, or one of
our other Mendele gelernte would undertake a more scholarly Yiddish
language column in the Forward?
