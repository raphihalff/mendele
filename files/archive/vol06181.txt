Subject: Introduction

Noyekh, whose requests I do not refuse, has asked for a personal
introduction. I am a genial but intolerant old man, have lived in Israel
these past nineteen years and regret that I wasn't smart enough to have
come here thirty years before I did. Born in Chicago, I spent over half
my adult life in Latin America, the language of my home is Spanish and
all my children at least bilingual. For Mendele, which is interested in
Yiddish, not in me, that's enough. I have spoken, read and written
Yiddish for fifty years and, put succinctly, there are sixteen
apartments in my building (in Petach Tikva) and I speak Yiddish with the
occupants of ten of them.

Subject: Jet lag af yidish

I have been humbly taking all the flak prompted by my suggestion for
jet-lag [6.156,159,180]. But now I wish to say: a dank laybl botvinik!

Vos iz? Hert a mase.

A boy once came home proudly telling his father that he's saved him 50p.
He explained that he chased after a bus but failed to catch it so he
came home by walk instead. 'Shoyte', the father said, 'you could have
chased a taxi and saved a fiver!'

Laybl Botvinik zogt 'tsi men vet es nitsen? ver vayst?' Nu, az men gayt
es savi nisht nitsen they might just as well *not* use 'khulshe
deporkhe'.

Subject: "Blond" oyf yidish

Joachim Neugroschel in 6.180 asks about the extent of blondness in the
Yiddish "blond". My parents, (Varshever through and through) invariably
use the adjective "geller' (yellow) rather than "blond" . This refers to
fairness of both skin and hair (but not blue eyes which JN refers to as
part of the English blonde).

I am looking for the words to the song: "Dos eybershte fun shteysel".
If anyone can supply them, or point me to a source, I would be most
grateful.

Subject: Yiddish in the liturgy

Michael Shimshoni is right when he says that the origin of 'Raboysay, mi
veln benchn' is in the Aranaic 'Hav lon u'nevoreykh', but...

The phrase of 'Hav lon u'nvoreykh' is used in the Talmud in relation to
the laws of benedictions. While all food needs a brokhe before and
after, food consumed during a meal where bread is eaten does not need a
separate brokhe as it is considered part of the meal for which grace was
said on the bread.

There is then the question of when a meal is considered over to require
brokhes to be made afresh. The Talmud says that if 'Hav lon u'nevoreykh'
is said, which means give us a goblet and let's bench, it is considered
'hesekh hadas' of the meal and brokhes have to be made on food consumed
after this even though it is still before benchn.

(The term 'hesekh hadas' has made its way to yidish where it means
oblivion or distraction.)

The Mogen Avrohom (one of the largest commentaries on the Shulkhen
Orekh) gives a reason for the minheg of Raboysay... by citing a Zohar
which says that every mitzve needs a preparation. The Zohar says that
'Hav lon u'nevoreykh' should be said prior to benching with mezumen,
which is a minimum of three people.

The Zohar has clearly borrowed the Talmud's phrase but for a different
meaning. The Mogen Avrohom says that this is the reason for saying, and
I quote carefully, 'beloshen ashkenaz, Raboysay, mi"r vel"n benshi"n'.
(The Mogen Avrohom died in 1682/83 when in his late forties and lived in
Kalish in Poland.)

Some have added on to it and say 'her tsi raboysay... which I suspect is
a by-product of chasidic rivalry vying to outholy each other.

Subject: Mir/mikh un dir/dikh

What is the grammatical difference, if any, between mir and mikh, and
dir and dikh?

I know that 'mir' can sometimes function exclusively as plural as in
'mir viln' but most of the time they easily interchange. Nevertheless
overuse of the dikh or mikh doesn't somehow sound right.

Is it dialectic or is there a rule?
