Subject: neo-shtetlism

On the word "shtetlizing" (Iosif Vaisman in Mendele Vol 08.120), I note the
repeated use of the noun "neo-shtetlism" (and its adjective, "neo-stetlist")
by J. Hoberman in his essay "Diasporama!" in the April 18, 1995 VILLAGE
VOICE, as in: 

"Postmodern Jewish expression has two poles: Diasporism and Neo-shtetlism."

and

"Not all neo-shtetlism is derived from texts. The most abstract and popular
instance is surely Seinfeld--a sitcom set on an imaginary Upper West Side
whose four major characters are recognizably Jewish although, as in Kafka,
the J-word is never mentioned."

Subject: farfast

English Below

ikh hob gelozen a kinders bukh in yidish, an letzn ein vort az iz omzinik in
zein kontekast. do iz der zatz. der vort mit der problim iz in groys-hantik.

"di tanoyim zeynen geveyn di gedoylei yisroyel, vos hobn FARFAST di mishnoh"

ikh hob gelozen FARFAST in der verterbukh Uriel Weinreich, and es hot gezogt
"the last seuda (meal) before a fast"

ober, do iz omzinik in zein kontekast, es oysen zeyn beerekh, "the sages are
the greatest of Israel, that **** the Oral Law".

keiner helfn?

I have been looking through a children's book in yiddish, and have read one
word that does not make sense in its context. This is the sentence - the
problematic word is capitalised.

"di tanoyim zeynen geveyn di gedoylei yisroyel, vos hobn FARFAST di mishnoh"

I looked up FARFAST in Uriel Weinreich, and it said "the last seuda (meal)
before a fast"

however, this obviously does not make sense in the context, which means
approximatly, "the sages are the greatest of Israel, that **** the Oral
Law".

Any help?

Subject: "Mayn krig mit Hersh Rasseyner"

I'm reading the English translation of Khayem Grade's "Mayn krig mit Hersh
Rasseyner" in preparation for performing in a play based on the movie "The
Quarrel," which was based on the story. I don't have the story in Yiddish
(and I might not be able to figure this out even if I did). 

Seven paragraphs into the translated story, Grade has the character of
Hersh Rasseyner cry out:

"You know the saying among us: Whoever has learned Mussar can have no
enjoyment in his life. You will always be deformed, Chaim Vilner. You will
remain a cripple the rest of your life."

Is this an accurate representation of the Yiddish? I understand that Mussar
teaches that enjoyment is undesirable, but from what does it follow that
Chaim is deformed and crippled? Because he now has (or thinks he has) 
enjoyment from his worldly activities? I'm just looking for a more complete
understanding of the line in case I have it wrong. 

The production, by the way, will be mid-February to early March, at
Playwrights Theatre of New Jersey.

Subject: words for relatives

While sitting and watching cricket (I bet there's no yiddish word for that
game) a few days ago (South Africa versus West Indies - we won) a group of
us considered (cricket being like Baseball on Valium - we have much time to
chat) whether there was an English word to describe my relationship to my
son's wife's parents.  Mechuten/Mechutoinim is, we decided, the Yiddish
word. 

Having failed to come up with an English equivalent for Mechuten, one of the
party recalled that Yiddish had a word/phrase to describe my wife's family
who were, in fact, not related to me.  For example, my wife's sister's
husband's brother - my brother-in-law's brother.  Alternatively my own
sister's husband's family. The phrase suggested was something like "verd
vuss pot(z)kever". 

We would be pleased to know whether we are on the right track and to have
the correct phrase as well as its literal meaning and "whom" it covers.  Why
it is used?.  Any other information regarding the subject would be
appreciated. 

Just to record, I started by searching Rosten's "Joy of Yiddish" - then I
searched under "Yiddish" on the Net and that is where I found you. 

I look forward to being enlightened.

Subject: Rozhinkes mit Mandlen

Jeff Veidlinger (08.122) relates the Shulamis story, the source of
Goldfadn's "Rozhinkes mit Mandlen". One detail is entirely new to me: the
"weasel". Whence this character, and what's it called in the Yiddish text?
The reason for my curiosity may be of peripheral interest to someone out
there. So . . . please be patient while I get to the point. 

Some 54-55 years ago, I (ani hakotn) played/sang the part of Avsholem in a
production of Shulamis performed at the annual concert of the _Yidishe
folkshuln_ in Toronto (believe it or not). _Vos tut der reboyne-shel-oylem_?
On the Sunday morning of the concert, I awake with severe case of
laryngitis. There follows a hysterical day in which two lovely ladies--one,
a _lererin_ at the _shule, Leah Langer, _oleho hasholem_, the other, a
singer, Masha Benye (spelling?), a solo performer at the same concert whom I
had the pleasure of seeing in NYC only a couple of months ago--take it upon
themselves to restore my voice with honey-laden teas and _gogl-mogls_ (now
there's one for you). 

Come evening, I go on to do my bit with Avsholem's famous song in which he
calls to witness i) _der brunem_ 'the well' and ii) _di kats_ 'the cat' (NOT
the weasel). 

He sings: "O der brunem, o der, u-un di kats, ze-e nor ze" (you hear it?) 

In any event, my voice cracked at the crucial moment, as it began to rise
after _kats_ and, as if on signal, Harry, the stage hand, meowed
(extemporaneously, I might add) into an open back-stage mike. Needless to
say, the audience cracked up, too, and put=20 the finishing touch on my
concert career. 

In view of this, I ask again, "Whence the weasel?"

Subject: Nokhamol Rozhinkes Mit Mandlen

My thanks to Jeffrey Veidlinger for his comments about rooting the script of
Goldfaden's "Shulamis" in the Talmud's Weasel and the Well, and for the
synopsis. 

A shayle for some pilpul: 

Why would Avishalom, a heroic warrior, sing to Shulamis, a young shepherdess
who has fallen into a well, the words about an _almone in beys-hamikdesh_
who is lulling her baby to sleep with tales of a _vays tsigele_ who is a
tradesman. And this bestows on the infant the promise of success and
wealth.... 

It has been said that the tsigele stands for _dos yidishe folk_. It has been
said that if we knew what the song really meant we would not use it for a
lullabye. It has been said that it is the most beloved lullabye in Yiddish
folksongdom. 

So - what is the _intershte shire_ in this dichotomy of interpretation of
this most popular of songs?

Subject: treife

In my galizianer yiddish the word is treife (with a broad ei-don't know how
to transliterate that). I heard treyf first when I came to this country,
litvish usage?

Subject: tkhoyr

With reference to khaver Engelhardt's communication [08.122:9] re the
derivation of the Yiddish word for 'polecat', and at the risk of boring
attentive readers of this list, may I once again ask why it is that
medelyaner persist in positing Russian etymologies for Yiddish words? Of
course, after the partitions of Poland at the end of the eighteenth century,
Yiddish and Russian became for the first time coterritorial and many Russian
terms were indeed adopted (cf. poyezd 'train', a modern innovation and
moreover one that was administered from St. Petersburg), but, if we can put
aside the fallacious view that Jews were so busy studying Toyre that it was
only at the time of the Haskole that they became aware of their natural
environment, it is highly improbable the Jews had to wait till the beginning
of the nineteenth century to notice the existence of polecats. And why in
any case should Yiddish speakers do anything so bizarre as adding an
addition consonant at the beginning of a loan word?  No, we can safely
reject Russian 'khor'' or (pace fraynd Engelhardt)  'khoryok' as sources of
the Yiddish word and look at the Slav languages with which Yiddish was
really in contact at an early date. Ukrainian 'tkhir' already provides an
initial t, but the vocalism is wrong. So what about Polish 'tchorz' (with
'acute' accent on the o)? The modern pronunciation is, of course, [txush],
but if we go back to the sixteenth century or earlier the pronunciation must
have been something like [txo:r] and we know that Proto-Yiddish 42-43 long o
regularly produces NEY [ej] and CY (as well as Standard Yiddish) [oj], i.e.
tkhoyr. Need we look further?  The moral of the story: don't derive Yiddish
from Russian without compelling reason for doing so.
