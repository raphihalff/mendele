Subject: Coffee Talk and Cultural Yiddish

I fear I will never recover the Yiddish of Fanny and
Zygmunt, but the cultural mileu remains and important
memory.  That is the reason I brought up Coffee Talk.
I might now mention Brooklyn Bridge and Seinfeld.  It
appears that there is a trend in the media toward
unapologetic ethnicity.  It started with the political
pressure that produced the Cosby Show. Thus, we get the
ultimate American family, only they are black.  It is
followed by the clearly Protestant Wonder Years.  In
Brooklyn Bridge we had Jewish Huxtables.  I am
interested in this trend.  As an unapologetic watcher
of schlock TV, and especially the comedy clubs,
reaction to people like Dennis Wolfberg would be
appreciated. How does Jackie Mason play in New York?  I
realize I am not talking about the Yiddish language
now, but call it "sociolinguistics" if you will.

Lionda Richman (notice the name) could have slid into
an antisemitic stereotype. It is saved from it by Mike
Meyers' obvious affectionfor his creation, no doubt
fashioned after many of his mother's cohort. It's no
more antisemitic than Jerry Seinfeld's "accurate"
depictions of the "kleyn- menschlich narishkeyt" he
encounters visiting his condo-dwelling parents in South
Florida. Sometimes we are, indeed, as "narish" as we
appear to be.

Subject: Sveder

Zev Kesselman writes:

        Similarly, the Hebrew sweater "sveder" HAS to
        be Yiddish related, with all due respects to
        the talmudic "sudar".  Yiddish may have gotten
        it from English, but even my Polish
        acquaintances use this word.

Not only Poles, as witness this bit of French Yiddish
(1945): "Far der milkhome hob ikh gehot a fabrik
fun sveders, yetst arbet ikh farn gouvernement".

I was glad to be reminded of SHTEKSHIKH. In our family,
those were slippers. But I had agreed that we used
PUDESHVES, too. usally the heelless slipper/slopper
rundowns of the shleppers in our family, who went
around with terrible bunions (my aunt Fanny), with the
krimme punim, and the perpetual curse on her lips.

Dear Shames: Okay, here is a terrible joke I heard
recently, to inaugurate your happy third year.

A man is closing the bar in New York City one night. He
orders a double whiskey. Notices way down at the other
end a figure seated in the shadow, also finishing. He
asks bartender who it is.

A regular, is the reply. Closes the place.

-What's he drinking?

Oh, schnapps on ice.

--Send him a double.

Bartender slides a double down the bar. Acknowledgement
with a wave of the hand. Man takes it as hint for
conversation.  Sidles down, and suggests he will finish
in company, if the guy doesnt mind.  Head nods okay.
He looks sidelong at him.  Takes a deep breath,

--Say, hope you wont mind if I say something?

Go ahead,is the nodded response.

--Well, pardon me...but...you know? if Hitler was
alive, he might look something like you, if you dont
mind.

Vy not? is growled back.  I A M Ahdulf Heetler. Zey
zink I was dead in ze Boonker.  Nein.  I got out, with
my closest aide.  Vee haf been in Argentina for 40
years.  Mit plans.  Ve are ready now. We vill soon
begin.

--What?

Ve start our last struggle!  Zis time, ve vill
exterminate all tzvel millions Judim, und 4 acrobats!

--Why 4 acrobats?

And the reply comes, You see? Nobody cares about ze
Judim!

Over to you.

Jascha
