Subject: Sholem Aleichem College seeks principal

The Sholem Aleichem College in Melbourne Australia has advertised seeking
to appoint a new Principal of the College. The College is a secular
Yiddish day school covering from kindergarten to grade 6. Naturally
knowledge of Yiddish is a requirement of the position. More information
can be obtained by emailing ourselves or directly to the College  at
sholem@world.net.

Subject: Got fun Avrom

There are  23 versions of the "Got fun Avrom" text in Noyekh Prilutsky's
"Yidishe folkslider" vol. 1 (Warsaw, 1911).  Some are quite long.  Here's a
pretty short one, the 19th version written in _partial_ dialect (song no.
27):

"Got fin Avrom, fin Yitskhok in Yankev,
Der liber shabes-koydesh geyt avek - zol kimen di libe vokh tsi gezint,
Tsi mazl, tsi brokhe, tsi oysher, in koved, tsim giten gevint
(gevin, analagous to aleynt for aleyn)
Nem dem bekher in der rekhter hant,
Makh a brokhe ibern gantsen land,
Nokh azoy hoykh, nokh azoy shayn,
Kol-yisrol zolen zogen omeyn.
Omeyn, omeyn!  s'ol veren vor:
Der hayliker Meshiakh ben Dovid zol kimen dos yor.
A gute vokh!..."

Subject: Clandestine Soviet songs

Yosl and I would like to find out whether anyone knows the author of the
two songs that were sung clandestinely in the former Soviet Union:
"Shuldike umshuldike" and "Antshuldikt" which David Eshet sings on his
record "Farbotene lider."  Ditto - we would like to know who wrote the
song "Es iz nokh faran aza blum."

Our thanks to everyone who welcomed us aboard

Subject: Pronunciation of abbreviations

Steve Jacobson, in 5.171, asks about the pronunciation of abbreviations.
In general, they are pronounced, though there are exceptions.  The one he
mentions, zayin tzadek (tzadi) lamed (zekher tzaddik liv'rokho), is often
pronounced "zat zal."  A frequent abbreviation in rabbinic literature,
nun lamed (nireh li, it seems to me), is often pronounced in abbreviated
form, "nal."  And of course, we are all familiar with the acronyms of
proper names, such as Rambam, Ramban, Rashbam, Radak, etc. Even longer
abbreviations are formed into "words," such as hey alef dalet mem vov
resh:  ho-odon moreynu v'rabbeynu, often used when referring to a
chasidic rebbe, contracted into "ho-admur."

Subject: Two, three, many Yiddishes

"Yak reydele to reydele, abi dobre meynele":  Discussion concerning this
expression should be juxtaposed with recent exchanges on Mendele which
dealt with the extent to which Yiddish speakers of a secular orientation
retain knowledge of common words or expressions relating to (religious)
yidishkayt.

Presumably "any" Yiddish-speaking resident of the Pale of Settlement
would have instantly comprehended "Yak reydele..." even had they never
used the expression before.  The coterritorial languages were (for the
most part) either Polish, Belorussian or Ukrainian, and they were widely
(if not necessarily grammatically) spoken by the Jews of the gubernii
comprising the former Russian Pale.  "Yak reydele..." would probably not
have been as widely understood, however, by Yiddish-speakers in
Transylvania or the Romanian Old Kingdom.  That does not necessarily mean
that their command of the language was inferior to their "Russian"
counterparts -- just different in some respects (relating primarily to
geography).

A grasp of a large portion of the Slavic vocabulary in Yiddish is one of
the things that today's North American Yiddish speakers -- religious or
secular -- is likely to lack.  And yet, Yiddish is permeated with Slavic
influences, as a reading of Max Weinreich's Geshikhte fun der yidisher
shprakh (to mention only one source) makes clear.

Weinreich also devoted much space in his four volumes to the language of
the "derekh-hashas" -- Yiddish as a linguistic repository for traditional
Jewish religious expression.  Indeed, without that fundamental essence
the language would not be worthy of its name.

Let us not lose sight, however (and I am not the first person to point
this out of late), that languages have many registers.  The vocabulary of
the yeshiva-bokher is not identical to that of the balegole or to that of
the mark-yidene -- the woman who operates a stall in the marketplace.
The same is true of English:  Social class, gender, race, and region all
influence the way one speaks.

I am not a native Yiddish speaker, but I have interacted with enough of
them to know that there is not one Yiddish, there are many "Yiddishes."
One of the things that I've done on occasion is translate letters written
by people in Eastern Europe to their relatives living in America.  We
call ourselves 'Am ha-sefer, but the level of literacy of amkho was not
necessarily of the highest order.  (Indeed, it is not often remembered
that not all Yiddish- speaking Jews, 75-100 years ago, were literate in
their native language, and the letters that I've read attest to that.)
The point being, simply to reiterate, that Yiddish is not one thing; it
is -- and always has been -- many, and it has evolved (like any other
language) over time and space.
