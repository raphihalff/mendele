Not exactly a "Holy" fool, but what about the stories of Hershel
Ostropoler?

Subject: Holy fool

I think Hershel Ostropolier comes close to being a trikster-fool type.
Holy, I'm not so sure.  In any case, the NYTimes Book Review, Sunday,
12/17, briefly reviewed a book of Hershel's pranks that's just been
published (presumably for ages 5-12 or somesuch, but I'm sure still
readable by adults).

Hershel Bershady

Subject: Tricksters in the Yiddish folktale

There is a YIVO Working Paper from the 1970s on this topic by Toby
Blum-Dobkin -- perhaps her MA thesis.  I read it at the University of
Pennsylvania's library, so it's available in some libraries and
presumably through Inter- Library Loan.

As I remember, the work deals especially with the tricksters Motke Khabad
and Hershele Ostropolyer.

A freylekhn khaneke!

Subject: A home page for itinerant klezmer music

Mark Pinson asked [5.196] about a website for "klezmerphiles"...

I think you should take a look at Ari Davidow's Klez Picks:

Subject: A home page for itinerant klezmer music?

In reply to Mark Pinson's query (and, no doubt, those of numerous other
klezmerphiles):  there exists an excellent set of klezmer- related WWW
pages!  "Ari Davidow's Klez Picks" can be found at
http://www.well.com/user/ari/klez and contains articles, reviews (mostly
Ari's) and "a sakh" e-mail and WWW links to klezmer artists,
distributors, etc.!

Ari hails from the Bay Area and is very busy these days, so he can't
update his pages as often as he'd like to.  He can also be e-mailed at
ari@emf.net.

There's not so much news of upcoming klezmer concerts, but messages of
that nature can be found from time to time in the Usenet newsgroup
"alt.music.jewish".

Happy Khanike...whatever way you spell it!

Subject: Lekoved khanike

A couple of songs for Chanukah that my son brought home with him from
Nursery.

     Khanikhe oy khanike

khanike, oy khanike, a yom tev a shayne
a listige a fraylikher nisht do nokh a zayner
ale nekht mit draydlekh shpilen mir
frishe hayse latkes esen mir on a shir


     latkele latkele

latkele, latkele, hop hop hop
tants aran in man top
bak dikh os zayer zayer fayn
val ikh vil di zolst zan mayn

The dreydel game

The four letters on a draydel or dreydel are 'nun', 'gimel', 'hay', and
'shin'. It stands for Nes Gadol Haya Shom.

For the game of draydel it stands for the following yidish words:

Nun:    Nisht      The player does nothing

Gimel:  Gants      The player takes all

Hay:    Halb       The player takes half the 'Bank'

Shin:   Shtel      The player has to pay into the 'bank'

The game starts by everybody putting one of each of the denomination the
game is being played in into the Bank. It usually is Money but I have
heard it being played with Almonds or Sweets. groyse knakers nitsen
hiderters. When any of the players has a 'gimel' everybody has to
re-deposit. The rest is quite obvious.


Vayishkokhayhi!

The game of korten or kvitlekh (Blackjack) was a popular pastime for
yeshive bokhurim, among others, to while away the long cold winter
nights. It seems that on khanike it was particularly popular. The rebes
obviously didn't take kindly to it considering it frivolous and bitel
toyre. Some khsidishe rebes went as far as to say that there is a klipe
in korten shpilen!

As parhes vayayshev usually coincides with khanike or around khanike an
acronym was made of the last word of that sedre. der rebe fleygt zogen az
vayishkokhahi makht Velkhe Yid Shpilt Korten Khanike Hayst Vagabond.
There are a few variants on the last Vov. Others say Vasilyu, apparently
the name of some soyne yisroel.

A fraylikhen khanike tsi akh ale.

Subject: A request from the University of Warsaw

A colleague in Germanic linguistics at the University of Warsaw asks if
anyone has a copy of the English translation of Max Weinreich's History
of the Yiddish Language to donate to the university library. Please let
me know if you do.
