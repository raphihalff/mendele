To Ellen Prince and anyone else interested in the history
of French, roosters, cats, and nuts:

Ellen,

     The recent bit about "Welsh" brought an old fantasy to
mind concerning the history of French about which I know
nothing except with respect to the French "rooster". I
think I've found/invented/dreamed a parallel. It occurred
to me one day as I walked along the Seine and passed a
restaurant named "Nos Ancetres les Gaulois (sp?)".

     To be fair to others, I recapitulate, briefly, the
French "rooster" story. (More about the barnyard school of
linguistics on another occasion.)

     Allowed to develop unhampered, the Latin words, gallus
'rooster' and cattus 'cat' would have merged in a single
form *gat meaning both 'rooster' (Standard French "coq")
and 'cat' in (southwestern?) French dialects. The threat
(to farmers, hens, and cat lovers) of being unable to
distinguish these two creatures led to the substitution of
a number of slangy type terms to designate 'rooster' in the
affected area. In the trade this is known as applying
therapeutic methods to the pathology of homonymy.

     Now to the point: "Wales" and its derivatives "Welsh",
"walnut", etc., are cognate with "Gaul". Question: How do
you say "walnut" in French? "Noix", right? (Ital. "noce"?)
which just means 'nut', no?  Why isnt it further specified?
How about this as an explanation; in the absence of drastic
measures to prevent homonymy, the name of the
above-mentioned restaurant could be read to refer to "our
ancestors, the walnuts". Intolerable, for right thinking
Frenchmen, I'm sure. What do you think?

Mikhl

p.s. Yiddish is an important source of Rotwelsch!

[In order to sneak a little more Yiddish into Mikhl's post,
the shames asks him and others to comment on 'galiganske
hon' i.e. a swaggering cock-of-the-walk Pat Buchanan kind
of fowl.]

1)   Dovid: re palatalization of "l" after k/g:
klyafte/glyuz, etc. see also palatalization of "n" after k:
knyi, knyepl, knyobl, etc.

2) As for "Jew": it's "marked" and it carries its
"markedness" into situations in which, as you say, "nobody
is shouting it in a derogatory way.

3) "faribl" as in "hot keyn faribl nit" 'don't take it
amiss', i.e., 'don't take it FOR EVIL'. Used positively? In
what sense? Perhaps only in "Ikh hob faribl gehat".

Mikhl.

Leonard, Sholem Aleykhem called himself "a zhargonisher
shrayber". Historically "zhargon" is just another name with
which the language was designated, perhaps a word of
pejorative connotation etymologically but not applied
pejoratively within the language. I think we have to
distinguish between things like Yiddish is just a jargon,
not a language" and, as many right-meaning Yiddish speakers
still recall, saying that "er redt zhargon".

Also, I'm reminded of Max Weinreich saying that when an
English speaker doesn't understand a word, he hides the
fact and quietly goes to look it up in a dictionary; a
Yiddish speaker, zolst mir moykhl zayn, writes a letter to
the editor of the Forverts and says "there ain't no such
word". I'm not sure I've ever used the word "frekh" but I'm
sure I've heard it used in Yiddish. "A frekher yungerman,
an azes-ponem". Daytshmerish? Maybe! Hob keyn faribl nit. I
delight in your stuff.

Mikhl

I remember hearing "of the Mosaic persuasion," which sounds
positively Byzantine to my ears, and therefore - presumably
- perfectly acceptable.
 
 ************************
 
In Mendele Vol 1.175, len <RHLE302@HAIFAUVM.BITNET>
 
asks for the origin of klavte.
 
Klavte is the standard Aramaic pronounciation of the
female dog, or bitch, kaf-lamed-bet-tav-aleph, which
scholars suggest should more properly be pronounced
kalb'ta.
