Subject: Introduction

I am an italian student. I am 23 and I study in Innsbruck (Austria). My
english is not perfect but I understand quite all. I study Politics and
History and I have a big interest for yiddish language because I am quite
jew. I read quite all Singer's books and I attend here in Austria a course
of yiddish. Can you help me to learn yiddish and the culture of the jews
from East Europe? Shalom!

Subject: mail.yiddish

Whatever philosophical issues lead to the demise of mail.yiddish, those
who work with Yiddish Vinklen (Yidish Vinklen, Zelig!) might want to
follow Dave Sherman's ftp instructions in the last Mendele posting to
look for program ideas.  I have found some of the jokes/songs/ditties a
good way to re-introduce Yiddish into the lives of many of our mitglider.
. .and to whet their appetites for more mame-loshen.

Subject: Second request for help

On the Jewish Genealogic bulletin board, they are waiting expectently for
an intelligent addressing of the question I posted here on Mendele and to
which no one has posted a response.   Two weeks have passed since the
original posting.

The matter had to do with a geographic difference in hair color. I
asserted that red-headed men were referred to as so-and-so "die geller"
by Litvaks and as so-and-so "die rote" by everyone else.  And what did
Mendele know about this hair color distinction?  I also pointed out that
my grandfather was a red-head and, despite the meaning of "geller" as
"blond" was referred to his entire life as "Al-Lazar die geller."

A number of the member of the Genealogic board have posed the same
peculiar word usage and I figured that Mendele was the very best place in
the world to bring the question up.  So I shouted it out to the world,
and so far all I am getting in return is vast realms of silence.

Nu?  Next comes guilt!

Subject: More on the "Grine Kuzine"

Actually she doesn't fare so well, and the color soon vanishes from her
cheeks. The last line of the song:

A shlok zol trefn Columbus's medina

Happy Columbus day,

Martin Davis

Subject: Housekeeping

A few Canadian subscribers have written about a missing Vol. 4.129.  Some
glitch has taken place at the listserver level.  Since it's not possible
to redistribute them by machine, the job falls to subscribers (who can
download it by anonymous ftp) or to the shames in cases of last resort.

Mendele is in the process of soliciting and developing a series of FAQ
files (files dealing with frequently-asked questions) dealing with such
things as textbooks, transcription rules, software, useful addresses,
etc.  If you have an idea for a FAQ file that you would like to compile
(or that needs compiling) please write.

The shames has finally got around to writing something that Mendelniks,
especially those new to the Internet, might find useful: a guide to
string searches of the Mendele archive.  The teyrets was that-- since the
shames loathes and cannot read two lines of any user manual ever written
--everyone else is the same.  A teyrets bleybt a teyrets.  Amyway, the
solution was in fact not to write a manual but to provide a series of
examples.  It will be available in a few days.  If you can't bear reading
it, we understand.  Comments invited.
