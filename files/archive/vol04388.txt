Moshe Waldoks

[For those who don't read yiddish- I have clarified my attitude towards
spoken contemporary Aramaic- my reference was to the Jewish dialiect of
aramaic that is found in the prayer book- (many in the Hasidic rite are
of course Zohar Aramaic, a product of 13th century Spain (loyt Scholem's
meynung.]

Subject: Sholem-Aleykem belongs to all

Az men zeyt a brivl fun Zelig geyt oyf der zun.  Borkhabe, Zelig. A sakh
Mendelyaner gibn azoy fil mi, un makhn fun Mendele aza fayner kval fun
visnshaft, yedies un komunikatsiye, Zelig besoykhem.  Ober Zelig, mit
zayn derfarung in Yidishe gazetn un tsaytungen iz take epes andersh.

Zellig!  Of course, you're right.  You cannot trespass (4.384) where
nobody owns the territory.  Sholem-Aleykhem belongs to us all just as
Yiddish belongs to us all.  Your addition to my bits of knowledge about
Sholem-Aleykhem are most welcome.

I have chosen to specialize because getting to know a human being as
thoroughly as possible makes the field he or she enriches much more
alive.  I am not one who accepts the modern view (or is it postmodern,
ver veyst!) that the text is all, never mind the life and times and
intent of the creator.  I'll never forget Dick Cavett's interview of
Bashevis Singer.  Dick Cavett recalled Singer's statement that he
(Singer) is not interested in knowing the author, just his story, and
that if Tolstoy lived across the street, he (Singer) would not be
interested in meeting him. Singer said, "Well, across the street, okay,
I'd go, but not Flushing."  I, on the other hand would go to Flushing or
Kiev or Timbuktu, If I could.

Subject: Sholem Aleikhem and Gogol

For Louis Fridhandler:

Having read your post on the relationship between Rabinovitsh and Gogol, I
thought you might find this article interesting:

     Joseph Sherman, "`God and the Tsar': Ironic Ambiguity and
        Restorative Laughter in Gogol's `Overcoat' and Sholem Aleykhem's
        `On Account of a Hat'[Iber A Hitl]." in The Walking Sphinx: South
        African Essays on Russian Culture, edited by Henrietta Mondry.

Subject: Fragment of a Purim song

Purim is gone, but I cannot wait for next year to pose a question.

During  a recent trip to Jerusalem,  I sat at Gershon Winer's  warm
Shabbas and Yiddish table. Inevitably, it being Purim, he whipped out
copies  of a Purim songbook, passed them around and we all sang.  During
the singing, a fragment of Purim melody and words drifted back to me,
which I had sung in the Dovid Pinsky Folk Schule in Brighton Beach in the
1930's.  Gershon had never heard it, nor had any of the others. Have any
of you?  Ratevet mir, emetzn. Unable to reproduce the melody, but here
are some of the words:

                  farflucht zol vern homan --
                  er is geven der ergster!

Subject: Ekhod mi yodeya in Yiddish

Alan Shuchat asks about _Ekhod mi yodeya_ in Yiddish.

I leave the preliminary "yum ta da di dum_" to you. In my
version, the central part of each of the 13 stanzas is as
follow:

ver s'kon reydn un ver dertseyln
1. vos der eyns batayt x2
eyner iz dokh got
un got iz eyner
un vayter keyner.

2. vos der tsvey batayt x2
tsvey zenen di lukhes
un eyner iz dokh got
un got iz eyner, etc.

3. vos der dray batayt x2
dray zenen di oves
un tsvey zenen di lukhes
un . . . . etc.

4. . . . fir ...
fir zenen di noshim

etc.

5. . . .  finf . . .

etc.

6. . . . zeks . . .

7. . . . . zibn . . .

8. . . . akht . . .

If anyone knows the Yiddish words to any other songs from the _hagode_,
I'd be grateful for the texts. Not simply Yiddish Passover songs, but
specifically Yiddish texts for songs in the _hagode_; _adir hu_ or _khad
gadye_, for example.

Hot mir ale a zisn un a koshern peysekh.

Mikhl Herzog

[A similar version was also received from Ruth Ellen Seid.]

Subject: Mu asapru

I'm glad Alan Shuchat brought up Mu asapru (a big favorite of mine).
Moyshe Oysher recorded a very beautiful rendition of this song, using
Polish-Yiddish pronunciation and "tote-mome" pronunciation. I know he was
from Bessarabia, and I think he was from Kishinev.

"Dra zenen di totis" (hope I didn't mess up the number; Avrom, Yitskhok,
un Moyshe?) Just about everything I've heard of his (I have five albums)
is gorgeous and evocative. He'll make you cry.

A zisn Peysekh, mayne fraynd!
