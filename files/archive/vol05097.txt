Subject: Superstitious Yiddish expressions

I want only to add another to Zellig Bach's timely reminder of ways of
warding off the "nisht gute" and other evil designs, since the days of
yomim noraim are upon us and it is certainly timely to frustrate the
various evil eyes that are a constant source of danger. I think that the
practice of naming a girl child "Maiteh" or "Maitah"  -- one who is
already dead -- was another excellent strategy of outwitting the malekh
hamoves for, after all, if the child was "already dead" why bother? In
the case of my own spouse, born in interwar Poland, her mother so disliked
the name that she changed it to Musia. Of course we still are trying to
outwit the aforementioned... Pu, Pu, Pu. (And as my own mother would add;
"With the wind and the water" Pu, Pu, Pu, Ober fun vanen es kumt, veys
ikh gor nit) A gut yor aykh alemen, un zol der malekh hamoves hoben gor
keyn nakhes fun aykh!

Subject: Superstitious Yiddish expressions

I just got back from a trip to New York and found Zelig Bach's posting on
Yiddish superstitious expressions.  It was terrific!!

I was also so pleased with the helpful descriptions responding to my
inquiry about "feldshers" that I am encouraged to try again with a word
that I am not sure of.

The expression used in describing the trade of one of the older members
of the family was "Moishe is geven a zhlen" although the sentence might
have been "Moishe is geven azhlen."  So I am not sure if the word was
"zhlen" or "azhlen."

However, the Moishe in question was an official who kept a record of the
births and deaths of the Jewish community in Nyashtat, Lithuania and that
is what I believe a "zlhen" or an "azhlen" to have been.

Any help?  Any suggestions?

Subject: Harvey Spiro's "southern accent"

This business of saying meshiginer instead of meshuggener must be
regional but it reminds me to that Dershowitz the lawyer, making a guest
acting appearance on Picket Fences TV Friday nite (Shabbes, take) August
25, says in his parting message to the guy playing the part of a lawyer
about to appear before the Supreme Court, zay gezint, not, as I would
have said it, zay gezundt. So it appears to be a systematic thing, and
no doubt their are regional dialect differences to account for it, as in
"moomeh" vs. "meemeh" for aunties, and such like. Even git yor instead
of gut yor, Is it Galicia vs. Lithuania?

Subject: Kovno Ghetto artifacts

Washington, D.C., -- The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum is
searching for artifacts to include in a new special exhibition on the
Kovno Ghetto (Kaunas, Lithuania) that it plans to open in 1997.  Using
surviving artifacts, photographs, and documents from the Ghetto's
clandestine archives, the exhibition will examine the extraordinary
experiences of individuals who were imprisoned in the Ghetto from August
1941 to July 1944.

To complete the exhibition, the Museum is searching for photographs of
Ghetto life; objects made in the Ghetto workshops; personal items used in
the homes; children's toys, clothing, and books; items used in the
resistance and partisan movements, and sacred materials, including prayer
books, prayer shawls, and liturgical items.

The Museum also is seeking artifacts from the destroyed world of
pre-Holocaust Kovno -- including photographs, ceremonial objects,
household items, books, and art works -- to use in the exhibition.

In addition to artifacts, the exhibition team is looking for scholarly
works on the Jewish material culture of Lithuania, works on Lithuanian -
Jewish relations, and papers on the German occupation of Lithuania.

Anyone who is willing to make such materials available to the Museum, or
knows of sources for such materials, including any names and locations of
survivors of the Kovno Ghetto, should contact Paul Rose, Exhibition
Researcher at the museum, via his E-Mail address (prose@ushmm.org), by
calling him at (202) 488-0400 ext.749, or by writing him at the
Department of Exhibitions, United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 100
Raoul Wallenberg Place S.W., Washington D.C. 20024-2150.
