Subject: Introduction

I've been reading/watching the Mendele list for a few years now, since
attending the YIVO summer program, and am extremely grateful for the
learning and experience that is so freely shared over the screen. The
sometimes-struggle through the phonetic Yiddish is always worth it,
for the authentic Yiddish voice I hear at the end.  I heard some
Yiddish as a child growing up in New York, and am told I speak with a
Rumanian inflection, from the bube whom I don't much remember much,
but from whom I absorbed an accent somehow.

Subject: Introduction

My name is Zitta Baker and Yiddish was my second language. I'm
currently teaching a basic conversational yiddish class at my local
JCC. I'm not a teacher by training and really never learned yiddish
formally in school.  I also am not very familiar with the YIVO
standard but hope to become more familiar as time goes on.

My parents were holocaust survivors originally from Czecholslovakia.
It was the language my parents insisted we speak at home. My mother
wouldn't answer us if we didn't speak Yiddish "English vest du kenen
ober Yiddish must du kenen", was their motto.  By the way, French was
my first language, English my third. All this by the age of 4.

Subject: Fis oyf di pleytses

if memory serves, the expression appears in sholem aleichem's "motl
peyse dem khazns."  in the "kvass" episode, motl's brother elye has
manufactured  batches of kvass, which motl is peddling on the street.
one batch, though, goes bad, having been made with waste water.  the
customer complains loudly, a crowd gathers, and the attention of the
local "gardevoy" (or "gradevoy," if you prefer) is attracted.  as he
approaches,  a friendly man in the crowd advises motl to "nem di fis
oif di pleytses," that is,  "make tracks" or "scram." motl does.

Subject: Fis oyf di pleytses

Goldie Morgenthaler (6.264) is right as can be: the phrase is "nemn di
fis oif di pleytses". That said, I have usually heard it as, "nemn di
fis oif di pleytses un vayivrakh", meaning to pick up one's feet and
flee. "Makhn (a) viyivrakh" is also heard with the same meaning
(origin Gen 31:21 "vayivrakh hu" -- He (Jacob) fled. Oddly enough,
Yiddish is not alone in "nemn di fis oif di pleytses". Spanish also
has it: "echar los pies a la espalda", a literal rendering of the
Yiddish phrase (or vice-versa -- who knows which came first?) meaning
simply to go away.

Subject: "Sold to Shame"

Sheryl Harawitz asked (6.264) about Yiddish play "Sold to Shame".

Connection to the following web site -

http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/varstg:@FIELD(author+@band(+Silb
ert,+Jacob+and+Dr.+Waltzman+)) -

will give Sheryl access to graphic (*.tiff format) facsimiles of the
original script. The pages can be viewed and/or copied to disk for
future study at her leisure.

Subject: Klezmorim in literature

Apropos David Goldberg's post (6.264), I just wanted to note that I
once wrote an article "Muzik un lid in Sholem Aleykhems lebn un shafn"
which Henry S. might find useful. I describe among other things Sholem
Aleichem's love for the violin, how he learned to play it, and later
played it with sensitivity. My article was published in "Di goldene
keyt" no ll5, l985, pp. 92-l05.
