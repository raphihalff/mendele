a historic happening in the yiddish forward! beginning with the july 4th
issue, there is a kinder vinkl with yiddish reading materials (page 14). A
little too small type-wise, both for young and for old, but a Jew can work
miracles with a xerox machine. more power to you, forward.

the bottom line is - subscribe and show support for this effort.

Subject: Song in Yiddish

A friend of mine was telling me about his grandmother, who spoke Yiddish 
and of a song she used to sing.  He does not remember the whole song, just 
the first line.  The song goes: "Friday of the nacht is yay day in lah 
may-lech".  If possible, he would like to know the translation and the 
whole song.  If you could help it would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you

Subject: Yiddish "Pirates of Penzance" or _Di Yam Gazlonim_

The extent to which newspaper typesetters can mangle an author's original
copy of a typed document, manuscript or libretto never ceases to amaze me.
In this regard, the current (July 11th) edition of the English _Forward_
outdid themselves.  In their weekly column _Der Yiddish-Vinkl_ (incidentally,
shouldn't that be _yidish-vinkl_?) on page 13 they printed an excerpt from my
Yiddish version of "The Pirates of Penzance" which they decided to call _Di
Yom Gaslonim_ rather than _Di Yam Gazlonim_ as was in my libretto. But that's
not all.  They also jumbled up the original English lines by Gilbert to such
an extent as to make them almost unintelligible. Finally, they printed eight
lines of my Yiddish lyrics with numerous misspellings.  To set the record
straight for those Mendelyaners who may have seen the piece and concluded
that I'm nothing more than an _amorets_ if not an outright fraud - I hereby
submit Gilbert's original lines of "When a Felon's Not Engaged in His
Employment" exactly as he wrote it followed by my Yiddish version minus the
errors.  But before proceeding to do so I should like to inform the readers
of this list that there is now a link from Iosif Vaisman's superb web site
Virtual Shtetl to my own Yiddish "Pirates" web page.  The URL for Virtual
Shtetl is http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/shtetl.html  
When Virtual Shtetl appears click on Art Center then choose Theater and
finally click on Di Yam Gazlonim - Gilbert & Sullivan.  My final remark in
this regard is to relay a message from Zalmen Mlotek.  He is still seeking
investors for a production of Di Yam Gazlonim which he is planning to mount
in Boston and in New York.  Interested investors, sponsors, "angels" etc.
should send him an e-mail message to: 102734.2445@compuserve.com   Eugene
Marner, a prolific creator of television documentaries for PBS ( e.g., Abba
Eban's "Heritage, Civilization and the Jews", "Creativity With Bill Moyers"
and 38 others) will shoot a film on every aspect of this production.  Those
who wish to contact him can do so at genemarner@juno.com

         When a Felon's Not Engaged in His Employment by W.S. Gilbert 

                                        (1)
SERGEANT:  When a felon's not engaged in his employment -  
POLICE:  His employment
SERGEANT:  Or maturing his felonious little plans-
POLICE: Little plans
          
[To save space, I'll no longer indicate the POLICE responses of the
last 2 or 3 syllables of each of the SERGEANT's lines.]

SERGEANT:  His capacity for innocent enjoyment,
                     Is just as great as any other man's.
                     Our feelings we with difficulty smother,
                      When constabulary duty's to be done.
                      Ah, take one consideration with another-
                      A policeman's lot is not a happy one.
ALL:  When constabulary duty's to be done,  to be done,
         A policeman's lot is not a happy one,  happy one.
                                              
                                        (2)
SERGEANT:  When the enterprising burglar's not a burgling.
                     When the cut-throat isn't occupied in crime.
                     He loves to hear the little brook a-gurgling,
                     And listen to the merry village chime.
                     When the coster's finished jumping on his mother,
                     He loves to lie a-basking in the sun.
                     Ah, take one consideration with another-
                     The policeman's lot is not a happy one.
ALL:  Ah!!  When constabulary duty's to be done,  to be done,
                 The policeman's lot is not a happy one,  happy one!

Dare I hope that one of the Mendelyaners who has a connection with the
English forward may have enough influence to have them re-print all of the
above correctly?

Subject: Note from moderator

More than a few Mendele subscribers felt that something was missing in their
daily routines and expressed concerns about Mendele's well-being when new 
issues were not delivered for several days. The good news is that Mendele is
alive and well. Somewhat slow traffic is determined by two factors. First,
high summer temperatures apparently inhibit linguistic creativity, and the
number of submissions to Mendele is low. Second, for the next several weeks
this shames will be preparing Mendele digests in Northern California, which
is, despite the same initials, far away from his friendly home computer in
North Carolina. Although it may cause some delays, Mendele is open and your
postings are welcome as always.
