Subject: Tsvey heldn mayne

I'm happy to announce that Mendele's web page is at last c o m p l e t e !
The last hurdle, which involved numbering hundreds of past issues so that they
could be easily read and downloaded, has been overcome by my neighbor and
lunch-companion Mark David.

Then we have the happy news that The Mendele Review will embark on an
experiment whereby Refoyl Finkel's wonderful yidishe shrayb-mashin (recently
enriched with new fonts) will be used to convert romanized text into 
alef-beys.  Not only is the prospect dazzling in its own right (ingenious
Refoyl!), but there's also this: subscribers who've hitherto insisted on their
own spelling systems will finally have to agree to use the standard
transcription scheme (crafty Refoyl!) in order for the shrayb-mashin to work.

Why heroes?  It's one thing when a pensioner with lots of free time and no
mouths to feed fools around with a list, but it's something else again when
people like Mark David and Refoyl Finkel -- and here I add Iosif Vaisman --
devote hours of their time to this task. One used to take this more for 
granted than is nowadays possible.  The community of Yiddishists is in their
debt.

Subject: "di grine Kuzine"

Freydl Cielak asked for text of the song [07.097] :

        DI GRINE KUZINE , text by J. Leiserowitz
                          music by A. Schwartz

        Es iz tsu mir gekumen a kuzine
        Sheyn vi gold iz zi geven, di grine,
        Di bekelekh vi royte pomerantsn,
        Fiselekh vos betn zikh tsum tantsn.

        Nit gegangen iz zi - nor geshprungen,
        Nit geredt hot zi, nor gezungen,
        Freylekh, lustik iz geven ir mine,
        Ot aza geven iz mayn kuzine.

        Ikh bin arayn tsu mayn "nekst-dorke"
        Vos zi hot a "milineri-storke",
        A "dzhab" gekrogn hob ikh far mayn kuzine,
        Az lebn zol di goldene medine !

        Avek zaynen fun demolt on shoyn yorn,
        Fun mayn kuzine is a tel gevorn,
        "Peydes" yorn lang hot zi geklibn,
        Biz fun ir aleyn iz nisht geblibn.

        Unter ire bloye sheyne oygn
        Shvartse pasn hobn zikh fartsoygn,
        Di bekelekh, di royte pomerantsn,
        Hobn zikh shoyn oysgegrint in gantsn.

        Haynt, az ikh bagegn mayn kuzine
        Un ikh freg zi : - Vos zhe makhstu, grine ?
        Entfert zi mir mit a krumer mine :
        - Az brenen zol Kolombuses medine !

Best regards,

Subject: Shlak

May I try to sum up the long discussion of the word _shlak_ and related
matters?  One preliminary point:  can we agree to the standard transliteration
_shlak_ for the Yiddish word, saving _s(c)hlock_ for the English slang term?
        
        1. In at least some of its meanings _shlak_ seems clearly related to
the verb _shlogn_ 'hit, strike'.  The g/k relationship is not surprising, 
given the fact that in the history of Yiddish (and in some contemporary
Yiddish dialects) final voiced consonants become devoiced (e.g., g>k).
        
        2. Answering an inquiry in the December 1961 issue of _Yidishe
shprakh_, editor Yudel Mark pointed to the following meanings of _shlak_:

                a. sudden paralyzing attack of a disease, such as
                 apoplexy or heart attack (_hartsshlak_);
                b. a misfortune:  a tsore, an onshikenish, a beyze
                 bagegenish, a pegere;
                c. an evil spirit:  a nit-guter, a shed;
                d. a failure, a useless person:  a groyser shlimazl, a
                 shtik loy-yutslekh ("a shlak fun zayn libn nomen");
                e. dross, slag, tail:  opfal baym baarbetn farsheydene
                 materyaln;
                f. other meanings, as in _toybnshlak_ 'dovecote'.

        3. Stutchkoff's _Oytser..._ adds some other meanings

                a. the roof of a _suke_ or a porch (_fligl_);
                b. a border or hem (also _shlyak_);
                c. a tailor's tape measure (also _shlyak_);
                d. (supplementing Mark's first meaning) _hitsshlak_ 
                 'heatstroke', _zunshlak_ 'sunstroke'.

        4. Note also _shlaks(regn)_ 'driving rain'; _shlagboym_/_shlaban_ 
'road barrier, as at railroad crossing' (cf. German _Schlagbaum_, Russian 
_shlagbaum_, Polish _szlaban_); _durkhshlak_ 'colander, strainer' (cf. Russian 
_durshlag_, Polish _durszlak_, German _Durchschlag_); _shlagvort_ 'slogan'; 
and that relic of the 1930's Soviet Union, _shlogler_ 'shock worker' (a calque
from Russian _udarnik_, also from the root meaning 'strike').

        5. As I pointed out in MENDELE a few years ago (and Michael Steinlauf
did more recently), Yiddish _a shlak zol im/zi/zey... trefn_ is presumably
modeled on Polish _niech go/ja,/ich... szlag trafi_.

        6. I would guess that the English slang term _s(c)hlock_ 'something,
such as merchandise or literature, that is inferior or shoddy' (according to
the _American Heritage Dictionary_) derives from the fifth meaning that Yudel
Mark gave for _shlak_ (_opfal..._), that is, tail ('the refuse or dross
remaining from processes such as distilling or milling') or slag ('the 
vitreous mass left as a residue by the smelting of metallic ore'--both 
definitions from the AHD).  Of course German _Schlacke_ (same meaning) could
be the source, but Yiddish (via NYC and Hollywood) seems more likely.
