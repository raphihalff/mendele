Subject: More Joe&Paul, and a lullaby.

1. Here's the version of Joe&Paul which I know in my bones. It's not very
different from the three which have already appeared in Mendele.

           "Joe&Paul, s'a fargenign!
            Joe&Paul, m'ken a bagn krign,
            A suit, a koit, a gaberdine,
            Brengt arayn dain kleinem zin."

There were obscene continuations available, known to the bad kids with whom
I associated at mitlshul.

2. In a quite different vein: there is lullaby which I find beautiful and
moving, but of which I know only fragments. I wish I could find the rest.
I'll write the tune under the words, as if it were in the key of C minor.

         "Amul iz geven --- a kenig;
          G  C   C  C  Eflat    C C Bflat

          Der  kenig  hot gehat --- a veingurtn;
         Bfl  Efl  Efl  Efl  F  G         F   F  Bfl  Bfl

          In   veingurtn iz  geven --- a ???????;
         Bfl  Efl Efl Efl Efl  D  C        B  C  G

          Bayushke, bayu."
          C   G  Efl    D C

Then a refrain, in which the melody changes a little. A later verse
(perhaps the very next) begins:

        "Der kenig iz --- geshtorben", and so on.

Does any of you recognize this?

Subject: Davenen-a new dimension

It seems the davnening bug has caught up with me but with an as yet unknown
variant.

How about davenen stemming from the aramaic word 'boye'? The word means
request or inquiry and is used in the sense of prayers in a few places.  See
Issaiah 21:12 'im TIVOYIN b'oyi' and also the 'Tiskabeyl' piece of the full
Kadish 'Tiskabeyl tseloyshoyn ivoishoyn'.

Subject: Moshe Stendel

I am working on the Yiddish translation of the psalms by Moshe Stendel (or
Stendal). His Sefer tehillim was given to print by Roesel Fischel in 1586. 

Secondary literature known to me:
A transcription by Johann Christoph Wagenseil: Mose Rabbi Stendels nach
Juedisch-Teutscher Red-Art vorlaengst in Reimen gebrachte Psalmen Davids,
Leipzig 1705. 

And short references in:
Wilhelm STAERK und Albert LEITZMANN: Die Juedisch-Deutschen
Bibeluebersetzungen von den Anfaengen bis zum Ausgang des 18.  Jahrhunderts.
Frankfurt a. M. 1923, 207-213.  Meyer WAXMAN: A History of Jewish Literature.
New York u.a. 1960, II 630f. Israel ZINBERG: A History of Jewish Literature.
Cincinnati u.a. 1975, 242. Helmut DINSE und Sol LIPTZIN: Einfuehrung in die
jiddische Literatur. Stuttgart 1978, 39. Jean BAUMGARTEN: introduction la
literature yiddish ancienne.  Paris 1993, 83. 

Who knows of any other publication on Moshe Stendel or his translation
or Roesel Fischel?

From: Leonard Prager <lprager@research.haifa.ac.il>
Subject: _Vi kumt di kats ibern vaser?_

The Magnes Press, as I perhaps did not make sufficiently clear, is the
distributor and not the publisher of this book.  Their correct fax number is
972-2-5633370.  I will forward details regarding price and ordering as soon as
I learn them.  I thank Dovid Braun for pointing to two errors in the review: 
change _a kats_ to _di kats_ (3x) -- first mention is correct; change _a lokh
mit_ to _a lokh fun_.  As I had imagined, the extraneous negative in the given
translation of "lozn zikh shpayen in der kashe" was due to the translator's
instinctive rendition of the usually negative form of the idiom, namely "zikh
_nit_ lozn shpayen in der kashe."

Subject: dawwenen

I was very pleased to see the ancestry of the 'turkey' definitely settled, but
lost track of the 'davenen' issue, especially since someone in the know told
us that all linguistic problems of this kind will be solved within the next
decade. Shame! Has the following explanation been presented yet ?: 

From: H. Beem, Resten van een taal, She-eriet, ISBN 90-71727-21-1.  [The
following is a quote in Dutch, not an attempt to revolutionise the YIVO
spelling]

"dawwenen - bidden, speciaal oostjidd. voor westjidd. oren z.a.; van mhd.
doenen, zingen; (z. Mordecai Kosower in: For Max Weireich on his seventieth
birthday, Mouton 1964) De gemeente oorde, de chazzen doente; vgl, ndl. deun
[melody, tune]." 

Sounds like a good one to me. If you knew that one already, how about Skrt. V.
dhav (with long 'a') > dhavana - sbst. running. If it means 'to run through
your prayers' we only have to find out how it arrived in Yiddish.

Subject: Eugene Debs

When I was in New York, I certainly remember WEVD signing on as the "Eugene V.
Debs Memorial Station".

On a list of radio stations active in 1928, 
http://members.aol.com/jeff560/1928am.html

WEVD is listed on 1220 kHz in Woodhaven (Queens), NY, owned by the "Debs
Memorial Radio Fund, Inc."

Another reference to "EVD" being an acronym for "Eugene V. Debs" can be found
on the web page: http://www.metropolismag.com/sept97/voice/voice.html which is
a story primarily about WNYC.

Of course, one can't take what one finds on the 'web as emes--the web is full
of pyramid schemes, quack medicine, et alia. But I see no reason to doubt
these references.

Subject: Eugene V. Debs

Let me be among those who will respond to Ron Robboy (Vol 07.107) to assure
him that radio station WEVD (New York City) did indeed take its call letters
from the initials of Eugene V. Debs.

Subject: Radio Station WEVD

I am by no means a radio scholar, but I have also heard that WEVD comes from
Eugene V. Debs.  

Unfortunately, WEVD is no longer exclusively a Yiddish radio station. It does
have, however, several hours of Yiddish programming weekly, including a daily
news report (nayes baricht), and several hours on Sunday morning in Yiddish as
well. 

Also, could you please inform me of the correct spelling of the Hebrew/Yiddish
woman's name pronouced:  Yetta

A shaynem dank.

Subject: Eugene Debs speeches?

Does anyone have any recollections, archives, etc. of the speeches Eugene Debs
gave to the jewish people in the early 1900's? Especially at the Thalia
Theatre in Chicago... 

Thank you,
Shana Lipsker
