"L'Chaim Theater Returns Jewish Song to the Stage" by Dan McKinney

Moscow's L'Chaim Jewish Musical Theater opened its first season since
undergoing a major renovation with a dance and musical revue, which included
songs in Yiddish, Russian and Hebrew. The production marks a new beginning
for a theater that as little as four years ago was without heat and
considering closing its doors permanently. 

Zhanna Bialik, one of the few performers who is a native Yiddish speaker and
a veteran of nearly 20 years in Jewish theater, helped to coach other actors
who did not know much Yiddish before their work on the show began.

"Jews and Catholics: Beyond Apologies" by David Novak 

We have known for a while that the Pope fondly remembers many of his Jewish
childhood friends and classmates. It turned out that he has managed to learn
Yiddish from them and still speaks it:

  Indeed, the Pope speaks Yiddish. (I know that for a fact because in 1985,
  when twelve of us had a private audience with him during a conference to
  celebrate the twentieth anniversary of Nostra Aetate, I briefly spoke with
  him in Yiddish.)

testifies David Novak in his his article "Jews and Catholics: Beyond
Apologies". Mendele is considering sending a gift subscription to Vatican.
Sponsors are welcome.

"A Fine Pickle" by Mimi Harrison

Mimi Harrison, who ocasionally entertains the Washington Post readers with
stories about herself and her relatives, revealed a dark family secret she
kept since her childhood:

  My father would look at me from time to time and say: "You're not pretty... 
  You're ba-tampte." I never knew what this meant, either; I didn't have to:
  I knew what it didn't. I knew he could resist me, that his road was the
  noncommittal middle path, one he traveled with amused indifference...

The ignorance could be persistent. Our author met many nice and smart
people, "but no one ever knew that funny phrase ba-tampte." Years passed by,
and: 

  I'm 50 now. I'm a mother, a wife, my father is gone, life holds me in a
  hundred different ways. On this particular day I'm pushing a grocery cart
  up and down the supermarket aisles... I run my eyes over every available
  label and whoa -- what's this!? Chubby glass jars of crisp-looking kosher
  pickles and sauerkraut and every lid inscribed: BA-TAMPTE, and underneath,
  "Ba-tampte means TASTY!!!" 

  I'm feeling dizzy, and I reel. Tasty?!? TASTY! My God, something slides
  off me like slime, and fizz pops from the top of my head... 

The redemption was so close! A trip to the library or a note to Mendele
could have saved years and years of agony. I am afraid to upset Mrs. 
Harrison, but may be her memory failed her, and her father used to call her
_tamevote_ not _batamte_? On the other hand, how much do they pay for a 817
words column in the Washington Post?

Subject: How to say "biological warfare" in Yiddish (Jerusalem Post, Jan 22,
1999, p.5)

"Oy vey? No way. Ex-spy Klingberg barred from speaking Yiddish" 

A Beersheba District Court judge has forbidden 80-year-old convicted spy
Marcus Klingberg from speaking Yiddish - because his secret service guards
don't understand it, his defense lawyer, Avigdor Feldman, said yesterday.
Klingberg, a former assistant director of the biological institute in Ness
Ziona, was released four months ago after serving 15 years of his 20-year
sentence for passing information on biological warfare to the Soviet Union.

Klingberg was released on grounds of ill-health, on condition that he employ
two male housekeepers approved by the General Security Service, at his own
expense.  They were to listen to all his conversations and ensure that he
spoke only to relatives and a few friends approved by the GSS.  State
prosecutor Devora Chen told the Beersheba District Court Wednesday that
Klingberg provokes the housekeepers at every opportunity and speaks to his
guests in Yiddish, or in Russian. His housekeepers understand neither
language.

Subject: Yiddish and the "heart of Zionist ideology" (Forward, Feb 5, 1999, 
p.6)

"Sandler misses heart of Zionist ideology" by Shawn Savage

"Forward" dedicated a prominent place on its editorial page to the letter of
a reader, Shawn Savage. He explains (in a response to an earlier article by
Boris Sandler) that the zionists' "heavy-handed tactics to eradicate the use
of Yiddish" in Yishuv was justified and necessary. "In retrospect, it has
all worked out for the best", asserts the author. 

This contempt for Yiddish is substantiated by a strong argument: "While
Yiddish today is cloaked in nostalgia, in the minds of early Zionists it was
the language of suffering and oppression under tsar and Soviet." 

Mr. Savage, who signed his letter as a "Ph.D. Student, CUNY Graduate
Center", is pursuing a degree in history. The letter shows that he can
benefit from some fairly basic history classes. "In the minds of early
Zionists" Yiddish could have been hardly related to "Soviet oppression" for
one simple reason: there was no "Soviet oppression" (in fact nothing Soviet
at all) in the times of early Zionism in the end of the last and beginning
of this century. Furthermore, for more than 20 years after 1917, when
"Soviet" had acquired power, Yiddish language and culture flourished in the
Soviet Union with state supported schools, publishers, academic
institututions, theaters, periodicals. Mr. Savage can afford such errors --
afterall he is still a historian in training. Forward's editors should have
known better.

Readers of the Shawn Savage's letter might be also interested in the list
of "important Jewish languages" compiled by the author. It includes German,
Arabic, French, Persian, and Polish (in this order). Mr. Savage beleives,
that the Hebrew intelligentsia is not "to be held responsible for the
disappearance of the use" of these languages. And here he is definitely
right.

Subject: Unorthodox Klezmer from Fells Point (Baltimore Sun, Jan 5, 1999,
p.1E)

Attached is an excerpt from the article relating to new songs translated
into Yiddish by Sylvia Schildt.  It describes Jerry Lapides [myself] writer
of the English lyrics and music.  One of the songs -- Mayn Tatns Nigun --
won third prize this past August 1998 in the International Yiddish Folk Song
Competition of the Charlotte Yiddish Institute in North Carolina.Jerry sings
and plays chromatic harmonica with the Baltimore Klezmer Orchestra an
affiliate of tyhe Baltimore Hebrew University.  The band often announces
itself as being the only klezmer band in the world that contains a chromatic
harmonica player. 

Jerry Lapides

"Unorthodox Klezmer" by Carl Schoettler

  Jerry Lapides plays a few bars of the old klezmer wedding dance "Frailach
  Fun Der Chuppa," "happiness of the nuptial canopy," his harmonica infusing
  the festive song with an undertone of nostalgic sadness...

  Lapides is one Baltimore musician who has found a living heritage with
  klezmer. He plays with the Baltimore Klezmer Orchestra, a nonprofit band
  affiliated with the Baltimore Hebrew University... 
 
  [Lapides is] 70 and he's been knocking about the Baltimore scenesince
  Martick's Lower Tyson Street Cafe was a beat generation hangout and No
  Fish Today was a way station on the road to the post-modern millennium.
  "But I don't think I was a character then, like I am now," Lapides says.
  "I'm a Fells Point character. Ask anyone in Fells Point. Fells Point is my
  shtetl."

Subject: Yiddish Poet, 88 (Jewish Bulletin of Northern California, Jan 29,
1999)

Here's an excerpt from the article in the Northern California Jewish
Bulletin that may be of interest to people interested in Yiddish and/or the
Holocaust. It is about my mother, Rajzel Zychlinsky, one of few living
Yiddish poets of her generation. She has been writing since the 1920's and
is interviewed in this article. The article also contains excerpts from her
last book "God Hid His Face".

Marek Kanter

"Yiddish poet, 88, crafts beauty from Shoah horror" by Leslie Katz
                                       
   Yiddish poet and Holocaust refugee Rajzel Zychlinsky created
   hauntingly beautiful poems from the ashes of war.
   
   Now 88 and living in a Walnut Creek nursing home, she still manages to
   find poetry in even the most confining circumstances... 
   
   One of relatively few living Yiddish poets, the widely published
   Zychlinsky has been writing since the 1920s. She says she hasn't
   penned a poem since moving to California from Brooklyn just over a
   year ago. Still, nothing excites her more than talking about poetry --
   other's or her own...

In the February 3 issue of the French daily newspaper "Le Monde", there is
an article entitled "La culture yiddish au futur" (the future of Yiddish
culture), by Gilles Rozier and Yitskhok Niborski (who, as far as I know,
both are Mendele subscribers).

"La culture yiddish au futur" by Yitskhok Niborski and Gilles Rozier

  De toute l'Europe, c'est en France, et a Paris particulierement, que ce
  phenomene est le plus manifeste, du fait, entre autres, de l'importance
  numerique de la communaute juive. Et c'est sans doute de Paris que les
  efforts de preservation et de diffusion de la culture yiddish peuvent
  prendre de l'ampleur. Le yiddish est enseigne dans quatre universites
  parisiennes et plusieurs centres culturels, dont le Centre Medem, qui
  abrite une bibliotheque de vingt-cinq mille volumes en yiddish. Des
  structures existent donc en France mais elles sont encore trop fragiles
  pour repondre a toutes les demandes et pour permettre d'elaborer une
  politique culturelle d'envergure. Le desir d'une grande maison de la
  culture yiddish est trop grand pour qu'il ne se realise pas. Cette
  realisation depend des acteurs du monde yiddish, a condition qu'ils
  puissent trouver des relais institutionnels...

Zoff und Tacheles 

  Sie wurden verspottet, belaechelt und verfolgt - das war jahrhundertelang
  das Schicksal vieler Jiddisch sprechender Menschen in Europa. Die
  eigenwillige Sprache, oft als Jargon, Mauscheln oder Kauderwelsch belacht,
  identifizierte den Sprecher sofort als Juden. Vor dem Zweiten Weltkrieg
  sprachen zwoelf Millionen Menschen auf der ganzen Welt die eng mit dem
  Deutschen verwandte Sprache. Heute sind es nach Schaetzungen von
  Sprachwissenschaftlern noch zwischen vier und fuenf Millionen Menschen.
  "Die rund 1000 Jahre alte Sprache ist vom Aussterben bedroht", sagt
  Professor Erika Timm an der Universitaet Trier, die den ersten
  Jiddistik-Lehrstuhl in Deutschland innehat...

  "Mir gefaellt der Klang der Sprache sehr gut", sagt Ane Kleine, die eigens
  aus Muenchen nach Trier zum Jiddistik-Studium kam. Die Sprache klinge
  manchmal Deutsch, enthalte aber viele Kehllaute, die man nicht ohne
  weiteres verstehen koenne. "Und das entscheidende Wort eines Satzes ist
  oft hebraeisch", sagt die dreissig Jahre alte Frau. Etwa zehn Prozent der
  200000 Worte stammen aus dem Hebraeischen. Viele Woerter, die heute noch
  im Deutschen benutzt werden, haben ihren Ursprung im Jiddischen: So etwa
  "Zoff", "Pleite" und "Tacheles"...

  Doch neuerdings besinnen sich nach Beobachtung von Timm wieder viele junge
  Menschen auf die jiddische Sprache. In den Vereinigten Staaten und Israel
  werde Jiddisch inzwischen an zahlreichen Universitaeten und einigen
  Schulen angeboten. Auch in Deutschland gibt es an mehreren Universitaeten
  Grundkurse. In einem Computerprojekt an der Universitaet Bochum sollen ein
  Sprachatlas digitalisiert und tausend Stunden Tonbaender in jiddischer
  Sprache ins Internet gestellt werden. Doktorandin Kleine glaubt nicht,
  dass ihre Lieblingssprache aussterben wird. "Jiddisch sprechen oft sehr
  fromme Menschen in New York oder Jerusalem - und die haben meistens auch
  viele Kinder", sagt sie mit einem Lachen.
