[See further 6.200, 6.223-7]

I always thought 'mezinek' to be a corruption of the posik, 'ki ven
zkinim hi loy'. It is in berayshis (Genesis) where it tells the story
of Yosef and his brothers. It says that Yankev liked Yosef more than
his other sons because he was a child born to him in old age. The key
word here is 'zekinim' which has its root in 'zokayn', Hebrew for
'old'.

I always took it for granted that 'mezinek' is a corruption of the
above with the 'n' changing places with 'k'. Is this normal in
language development? And is it possible that the Ukrainian and
Russian words cited in connection with 'mezinek' have their roots in
the Hebrew?

I also think that the image of the mezinek may have its origin in the
above biblical story. Yosef and Binyomin, two children born to their
old father, are given special treatment. Yosef gets a special shirt
while Binyomin is never allowed out of sight. The whole story is built
around Yosef being punished for behaving like a spoilt kid, a trait of
a mezinek, Yankev's reluctance to let Binyomin go and Yehuda's
intercession on behalf of his youngest brother.

As regards the tradition of dancing with a broom, mentioned by Fay
Lipshitz [6.223], the minheg is alive and dancing all over the world
in frim communities. As the weddings have a mekhitse I only see the
father dancing with the broom.

Subject: Tevye's aphorisms

First of all my thanks to Louis Friedhandler --mendele's eminent
resident Sholem Aleichemologist- and Mechl Asheri  [6.226, 6.227] for
carrying on where I left off. Sorry for my concision.

I must differ with Reb Mechel in the meaning of S A's phrases.

The posik 'im begapoy yovoy begapoy yaytsay' referrs to a Hebrew
slave. There are only two ways for a Hebrew to become a slave. Either
he is poor and sells himself or he is caught thieving and cannot
afford to pay up so he is sold with the proceeds going to the victims.

When his time comes to leave, after six years, the posik says that if
he arrived on his own he leaves on his own, but if he brought a wife
along he takes her along with him.

The idea of a Jew being a slave, whether a pauper who can think of no
better way of making a living but selling himself, or a thief that
gets caught, implies a shlemazel of sorts. And this is in my opinion
what Tevye means when he says 'az men laygt aran a krenk nemt men aros
a kadokhes', whatever went in comes out. It is a way of saying you get
what you pay for.

The attribution of the quote to Rashi adds a geshmak to the quotation
that I simply cannot explain. I can only compare it to seeing 'omar
abay'ye, omar rove'* in Bialik's 'Hamasmid', 'baye shenolde beyomtev'*
in IB Singer's childhood memories and countless similar phrases in
Yidish and early Hebrew literature. (*Talmudic phrases).

Is it the creativity and the profanity of the apikorses? Is it the
satisfaction at knowing they went through the same Cheider and Yeshive
system that I did? Whatever and however, geshmak it is!

Reb Mechel also mentioned 'vi a hon in benay odom'. Sorry but I must
again disagree.

The tradition of Kapores, (yes, Reb Mechel, I do do it with a chicken
except when they price the chickens so high that it's an avayre to
spend that kind of money) starts with a prayer 'Benay odom' (Sons of
man) which is said three times. During this prayer the chicken is held
still, as opposed to the circular motion made later, and the chicken
with its stare ends up looking into the makhzer.

From this comes the above phrase which is used for a klotz looking at
something he or she has no idea about. For eg. if you caught Bill
Clinton reading Voltaire or Boris Yeltsin scanning a balance sheet you
could make this comment.

The phrase that Reb Louis asks about is, I believe (I do not own the
book), in the first part where Tevye is on the way home from Boybrik
and is stopped by two ladies wanting a ride. In the middle of the way
the horses refuse to move. He whips them and when it doesn't help he
tries to reason with them. The horses, it seems, adhere to a different
strand of logic than Tevye's and this too doesn't work.

He then exclaims in resignation 'ayn khokhme, veayn aytse, veayn
tevine keygn a krank ferd'. The phrase is a play on a verse in
Proverbs which says 'There is no wisdom and no advice (strategy) and
no intelligence against [the will of] G-d.

Subject: More Yiddishe dueten-lider

Further to my message distributed in 6.216 I have come across another
two duets for female and male voices.  They are found in _Mir trogen a
gezang, the new book of Yiddish song_ compiled by Chana E. Mlotek and
published by the Workmen's Circle.  It is sung by Lorin Sklamberg and
Shura Lipovsky on the tape cassette _On Wings of Song_ (WC21) issued
by The Workmen's Circle. The song is "Pozharne komande", by Wolf
Younin and Sh.Kahn, written about 1927-28, and is actually in Yiddish
and Polish (Russian?).  Found on the same tape is "Oh kum shoyn
shtiler ovnt", sung by Yosl Mlotek and Shura Lipovsky, which is also
in _Mir trogen a gezang_.

Subject: "A keselgarten!"

Noyekh Miller writes [6.228]:

        Blaybt fort a kashe: thirty years closed down and people in
        der heym still didn't know about Ellis Island?  Of course they
        did.  Why then retain the older name? Veys ikh nisht.

Ikh oykh nisht.

But by coincidence I have ready at hand evidence that this phenomenon
was not limited to Yiddish, or to Jews. The current issue of
_Language_ has a review of a recent dictionary of the Hungarian usage
of Hungarian immigrants to the US. And the title: "Tu'l a
Kecega'rda'n", which translates as "Beyond Castle Garden".

The reviewer (Edith Moravcsik) remarks: "The name was kept among the
immigrants even after the station was moved to Ellis Island in 1890".

Apparently Castle Garden had quite a reputation.

Subject: "A keselgarten!"

Khayem Bochner's comments above suggest that although the kashe blaybt
a kashe it could profitably be rephrased.  For it is by no means
limited to Castle Carden and may be but one more instance of everyday
ethnogeography.  Simply put, place names die hard but we don't know
why.

Need more examples?  Start with Lemberg, a name that disappeared in
1918 to be replaced first by Lvov and now by Lviv.  Its Yiddish name
remains Lemberg.

And what of Vilnius and Kaunas which stubbornly remain Vilne and
Kovne?  Or Preshburg, which everybody else called Pressburg until about
1919 when it became Bratislava ..and continues to be assigned to
Hungary in the bargain?
