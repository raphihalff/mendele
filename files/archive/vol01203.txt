A) [Purim--Mendele 192]

In connection with "Shoyshanes-yankev" Dovid Braun refers
to a Polish or Ukrainian text.  From the words he quotes,
he seems to have in mind the Ukrainian humorous folk song
"Pishla maty na selo" ("Mother Went to the Village"), the
refrain of which begins "Hop, moi hrechanyky."  Hrechanyky
are distant relatives of blintzes (which are, by the way,
called "mlyntsy" in Ukrainian) made from buckwheat flour
with yeast and eggs.  The Purim song "Yakhne-dvoshe" ("Hop,
mayne homentashn"), text by Y. Pirozh- nikov, was set to
this Ukrainian melody.

B)  [Daytsh]

Yet another version from Salcia Landmann's _Jiddisch:  das
Abenteuer einer Sprache_:

    A Volga-daytsh iz geshtanen far a rusishn gerikht,
bashuldikt in der geneyve fun a por ferd.  Azoy vi keyn
dolmetsh iz in shtetl nisht geven, hot zikh gemoldn a yid
un zikh barimt, az er ken daytsh "vi vaser".

    Der rikhter (oyf rusish):  "Fregt dem bashuldiktn,
farvos er hot geganvet di ferd!"

    Der yid:  "Reb daytsh, der oden fregt aykh, farvos ir
hot gelakkhent di susim."

    Der daytsh:  "Ich verstehe nicht."

    Der yid, oyfgeregt:  "Vos heyst, ir farshteyt nisht?
Men fregt aykh, farvos ir hot gelakkhent di susim!"

    Der daytsh:  "Ich verstehe nicht."

    Der yid (oyf rusish):  "Her rikhter, er farshteyt oykh
nisht keyn daytsh."

C)  [The Yemenite curse--Mendele 201]

What Henry Mullish cites as "gey kebetten materi!" is based
on an obscene Russian way of saying "go to hell!", namely
"idi k ebene materi" ("idi" = imperative of 'go'; "k" =
'to'; "ebene" = a variant dative passive participle of
'futuere' [as they used to write]; "materi" = dative of
'mother').

   Weinreich's College Yiddish is available in Hebrew. The

Subject: Yiddish grammars/textbooks for German speakers

Sure there's Birnbaum for German speakers interested in
learning Yiddish, but has anyone created something zayt
moykl more up to date?  I've had this problem in tutoring
Germans in Yiddish.  Or is the idea tsu treyf?

Subject: "matri"

This is inspired by Henry Mullish's item.

Once in a while, when my mother was quite angry, she could
be heard to say or mutter: "Geh chutoff matri!"

As a child I never knew or wondered what this meant. As an
adult, I realized that it was only the "geh" thast I could
recognize as Yiddish. I guessed that the "matri" was slavic
(Polish in my mother's case) for "mother" and this
imprecation was what Solzhnitzn has called a "mother oath"
(what can be heard on the sidewalks of New York as "your
mother" or worse).

Am I right? Is "chutoff" as vulgar as I imagine? Is it
Hebrew, or (despite the usual give-away three consonants)
Polish? Can my mother really have been in the habit of
using Polish expressions of a kind that would never never
have passed her lips in Yiddish or English?
