Subject: "Yoyvl-lid" or "Anniversary Song"

I have a Compact Disc, The Yiddish Dream, A Heritage of Jewish Song. The 
number of the disc is VCD-715/716, and is put out by Vanguard Records.
Selection #16, is listed as Anniversary Waltz on the disc, and as Chasseneh 
Valtz on the included brochure.  It is sung by Jan Pierce, in Yiddish. (The
words are by Chaim Tauber).

I regret that I am not as fluent in understanding as Jan Pierce is in
singing, and the words are not included in the brochure.

Subject: Az me lebt...

In answer to Michael Steinlauf's query (7.041) how to translate into English
the Yiddish expression "az me lebt, derlebt men,"  Michael Krantz made several
general suggestions (7.047,1), all of which are based on the premise that bad,
inappropriate behavior will ultimately bring forth an appropriate consequence.

That is not necessarily the only, or even the main meaning of the expression.

"Az me lebt, delebt men" conveys a notion of hope that in the final accounting
_yoysher_ [justice] will preval and that things will yet turn around for the
better.  While this, of course, includes the idea of a consequence for past
bad behavior, it also carries a factor of consolation and hope.

If an adolescent, for example, acted in a rebellious and spiteful way, to the
chagrin and exasperation of his parents, and, years later, suddenly turned
around mending his ways, it would be appropriate to say "az me lebt, derlebt
men."

The brevity of the Yiddish expression Is charming.   Since there is no
equivalent verb in English for "derlebn" -- the prefix /der-/ connotes the
passage of _future_ time -- a translation into English will consequently
be longer, and sound somewhat clumsy.

My suggestion:  "Let's live long enough, and we will surely see the wished
for idea, or thing, happen, and such-and-such occurrence will certainly take
place."

Subject: Who was singing in Jerusalem

Lily Elyon writes how much she was impressed with "Chana Mlotek" ! at the
Yiddish concert in Jerusalem.  I am sorry to say that Chana Mlotek did not
sing in Jerusalem nor does she sing anywhere and if she did sing, such praise
would definitely not be forthcoming.  The wonderful singer Lily Elyon heard
is Adrienne Cooper Gordon.  Adrienne's Jewish name is also Chana and she is
sometimes called Chana Gordon;  "Chana Gordon" is Chana Mlotek's maiden name.
Is that clear?  Vi borsht?  Is that from whence the misunderstanding arose?
Anyway, I'm honored to have been mistaken for the beautiful singer and
interpreter Adrienne Cooper.

Subject: Yiddish Terms of Endearment

Rivke Friedman (7.047,2) enumerates the many _tsertl nemen_ [endearing names]
in English that one can readily apply to one's "significant other," and seems
to lament the paucity of such terms in Yiddish.

She refers to the word "tsutsek" that she encountered in Singer's book with
the meaning of endearment.

"Tsutsik," with an /i/ in the final syllable, literally means a little
yapping puppy.  This word, as well as some other words normally considered
pejorative, for example _mazik_ [mischievous child], or _mamzer [bastard],
may be turned into endearments depending on the context, tone, and way it is
spoken.

But Yiddish is in no way lacking in _tsertl nemen_, to the very contrary --
it is a language of heart and affection.

As I pointed out on another occasion in a post in _Mendele_ about diminutive
names, Yiddish given (first) names lend themselves beautifully to expressions
of closeness, warmth, endearment, and love.

Take the Hebrew-Yiddish name Yoysef, for instance.  As a small child he is
called Yoske, Yosele, Yosenyu, Yosenyununu, Tatele, Zeydele (the latter two
are expressions of hope that he will grow up to be a father and grandfather),
and so on.

Another example:  the name "Ber."  By means of a variety of suffixes an entire
gamut of nuances can be achieved:   Berl, Berele, Berke. Berkele, Bertshik,
Bertshinke, Berish, Berishl, etc.  (The examples of the Ber diminutives with
their various suffixes are cited from Max Weinreich, _Yivo Bleter_, Vol. III,
p. 358., 1979.)

Since English does not have this richness of suffixes, it must resort to the
use of appropriate adjectives,  such as 'little,' 'sweet,' and so on.

So if your "significant other" bears an Anglo-Saxon monicker, let say
"Jeffrey," nothing much can be done with it as a form of endearment, unless
it is changed to Yosl, or some other lovely name in Yiddish...

Subject: "az me lebt"....

In regard to Michael Steinlauf's query about an English equivalent for the
Yiddish proverb/cliche "az me lebt, derlebt men" Ive told Michael that
when people deal with a foreign language they tend to read more into
idioms,proverbs, and cliches than is actually in them--since the dead image
seems so fresh and novel to the non-native speaker.

"az me lebt, derlebt men" is fairly equivalent to the English cliches
"live and learn" and "well, you live and you learn..." and in some
contexts "what won't they think of [up] next!!!?"  Or even:  "Whoda
thunk!?" in a smaller number of connections.

The tight-lipped and laconic German equivalent is:  "Man lernt nie aus!"

Sermonizing German proverbs such as "Wie man sich bettet, so liegt man"
are not equivalents of the Yiddish phrase, which usually expresses some
degree of surprise at yet another new experience and an overall degree of
wonder at the infinite resources of life.....

A major problem in dealing with foreign proverbs is that American English,
unlike British English as well as Yiddish, German, etc., is very bristly
about proverbs and idioms--and generally dismisses them as cliches/  this
applies even to bland expressions like "hand in hand" as in:  "The
economic crisis came hand in hand with a change in the weather."
Americans react badly to the moribund metaphor of hand-holding.  Recently
an editor actually challenged my use of the phrase "All in all"--calling
it a cliche.

Yiddish, by contrast, revels in idioms, proverbs, commonplaces--they add
zest, spice, and salsa to both the spoken and the written language, even
when used by the pickiest stylists.  Max Weinreich in his History used
certain standard phrases such as "Di goldene keyt" {of Jewish tradition,
etc.}.  An equivalent American stereptype would be condemned as
banal.  A good exception is Bergelson's style:  Bergelson tends to avoid
cliches, idioms, proverbs, no matter how banal his characters may be:
instead, he characterizes them with the use of leitmotif phrases that he
invents and then runs into the ground to demonstrate the banality of the
people he writes about.

These are just some of the difficulties in translating Yiddish into
American English.

My grandfather used to call me "Boychik" and "Boyala."  He called my sister
"Meidela," and sometimes called both of us "monkela."

Subject: Verlaine and Litvine

Al Grand asked about M. Litvine, Paul Verlaine's Yiddish translator, and about
other translations from Verlaine [7.047, 7.050]. A small selection of
Verlaine's poems was translated by Simkhe Shvarts (I would love to find some
information about him) and published in _Tsen lider fun Bodler un Verlen_,
Tshernovits: Seminar far Yidishe literatur, 1936. There are some translations
in Verlaine's biography in Yiddish: Malka Locker, _Pol Verlen_, Tel-Aviv:
Farlag Y.L. Perets, 1976.

M. Litvine was born in 1903 in Lublin(?). In 1952 edited _Dos bukh fun Lublin:
zikhroynes, gvies-eydes, un materyalen ibern lebn, kamf, un martirertum fun
Lubliner Yidishn yishuv_ (with M. Lerman). In 1990 he delivered the eighth
annual Avrom-Nokhem Stencl Lecture in Yiddish Studies in Oxford "Translations
into and from Yiddish". His _Frantseyzishe poezye_ (Pariz: Unzer Kiyem, 1968,
462 p.) is the only large anthology of French poetry in Yiddish.

Subject: "vayse leykene shikhlekh"

With regard to _leykene shikhlekh_ [Joachim Neugroschel, 7.050]:
_laika_ is Russian for kid-skin, used for making fine gloves and shoes.
Etymologically related to the homonymic breed of Eskimo dogs. Apparently
poor animals served not only as a means of transportation.
