Subject: Yiddish and microfilm

Following on from the recent postings by Sholem Berger and Adam Levitin
on the subject of libraries disposing of original Yiddish periodicals
in favour of microfilm copies, a recent personal experience may be of
interest.

A few months ago, I noticed an American dealer selling bound volumes of
the Forverts, three months worth of papers per volume.  I bought a few
volumes from the 1920s and 30s, and was surprised to find that they
were in pristine condition, printed on rag paper, presumably for
library use, and virtually untouched by later hands.  I was even more
surprised to discover that the bindings were all stamped 'Library of
Congress' - apparently part of the Library's near-complete run of the
original newspaper.

A recent article on the subject of libraries disposing of their
original newspapers appears in the current issue of the Times Literary
Supplement. It makes the point that virtually all the bibliographic
guides to original newspapers are now badly out of date.  This
presumably applies equally to Yiddish periodicals.

Perhaps some of the Judaica librarians among Mendele's ranks could take
the initiative in this matter? At the very least, it would be
interesting to know which libraries have disposed of which Yiddish
sets.  In the face of the growing debate on this issue, the British
Library has now promised to make public the list of 'foreign
periodicals' they have de-accessioned, something they have hitherto
resisted. I hope, and pray, that it does not include some of their rare
sets of London Yiddish newspapers.

Subject: Lewis Carroll in Yiddish?

Can anyone tell me if the works of Lewis Carroll (e.g. Alice in
Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass) have ever been translated into
Yiddish?  If so, can you tell me the translator, Yiddish title,
publisher, and publication date?  The Lewis Carroll Society of North
America is compiling a list of all translations of his works; so far
they have over 70 languages listed, including Hebrew, but they are
unaware of any Yiddish translation.

Subject: The Women's Name Frumet/Frimet

Apparently stems from older Yiddish _frumhayt_ 'piety' (modern Yiddish:
_frumkayt_).

Subject: origin of word  "mayontek"

I came accross the work mayontek (mem -pasekh alef- yod- kumetz alef-
nun-tes-ayen-kof) in Sholem Aleichem's Mottel Pessi.  The meaning is
"estate" or "fortune".  I wonder what the origen of this word would be.

Also in Mottel Pessi in section 8 of "meer koletn" is a dual language
saying: as spoken by Mottel's mother, "yak redele to redele, abi dobre
megele".  First of all what language are the slavic words from?
Russian? Ukranian? What does it actually mean?

Subject: Papirnik

"Papirnik" is indeed a collection of stories written by a young jewish
author living in Vienna:

Rabinovici, Doron:
Papirnik : Stories / Doron Rabinovici. - Erstausg., 1. Aufl.. -
Frankfurt am Main : Suhrkamp, 1994. - 134 S.. -
(Edition Suhrkamp ; 1889 = N.F., 889) ISBN 3-518-11889-7 -

As to the etymology of the name, it seems to me rather simple, imho
combining the word "paper" with the east-european suffix -nik meaning
something like "guy" or so.  (It looks like such a surname exists in
reality too, you find it in some czech sites in the internet)) I would
try to translate by "paperling" - made from paper, filled with paper,
ijnspired by paper = books, multiple written, read, learned identities.

For more about Rabinovici, the author, look at

http://www.cas.uiuc.edu/MillerComm/millercommarchive/SP01/
Rabinovici.htm.

I hope my associations are not too simplistic. (In french, "papernik"
doesn't offer so quick an association to the word "papier", whose
prononciation sounds different)., it seems more to rely on the surname
"Papernik", existing in this spelling too.

Subject: a poem from Sokolifke

My friend Lil Berman of Buffalo NY (and a member of our weekly
yidish-vinkl) asked me to try to find the missing lines and verses of a
poem that her mother and aunt used to recite. They were both born in
the shtetl Sokolifke/Justingrad (between Kiev and Odessa). The lines
that she recalls are:

Ikh lig af der erd
Un shmir di (?)
Kimt arayn der tate
Mit a lange kapote
...
...
...
...
Ikh shnayd un er frest
Zol er vern tsezetst.

If anyone recognizes and can add to this, Lil would be delighted. It
would be interesting to know where else the poem was recited.

Incidentally, the shtetl Sokolifke (or Justingrad, named after the wife
of the porets who owned the land which the shtetl occupied) was totally
destroyed and no longer exists.  The pogroms after WW1 and the Shoah
saw to that.  Modern maps of that territory don't show the location of
the shtetl by either name.

Subject: Glatstein's Holocaust Poems

I'd like to thank my friend Allen Nadler for providing the reference to
the source of the phrase "the God of my disbelief." I'd like to mention
to the readers of this list that I published an English translation of
Glatstein's Holocaust poems several years ago, under the title "I Keep
Recalling" (original Yiddish title: "Kh'Tu Dermonen"). The poem "My
Fellow-Wanderer (Mayn Vogl-Bruder) was one of the many powerful poems
in that volume.

Subject: Peretz' Schriften

I am looking for help to get information about an Yiddish version of
I.L. Peretz'works," Peretz' Schriften", published by Hebrew Publishing
Company, 50- 52 Eldridge Str., New York. There are some interesting
facts about this book : there is no date of printing, and this Yiddish
version , compared to more recent ones, presents special orthographic
forms, remembering more a "German Yiddish" written with Hebrew letters.
One of my friends from whom I received this book as a so kind present,
does not know any extra details about the above mentioned book. My
persistent intention is to translate Peretz into Spanish under the
light of a conception other than trhe ones up to day exposed by some
translators. This is a rather laborious work, to "pass " from a so
beautiful Yiddish into Spanish, trying to keep style, spirit and
literary "flesh" and not turning it into "a treifeh skhoireh mit a
koshern Yiddishn ta'am".I am working seriously on it.

Shall one from among the "Khaverim" be so kind to assist me to know
about, shall I be deeply thankful.

Mit meine beste wunchen,

Marcos Levin
Kibbutz Matzuvah, Israel
