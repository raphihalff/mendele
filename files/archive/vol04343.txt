Subject: Yiddish and Ashkenaz conference

To graduate students who hope to attend the upcoming Yiddish and Ashkenaz
conference in Columbus, Ohio:

As a grad student here at Ohio State University, I know that many of you
may be suffering from lack of funds, but would still like to attend what
promises to be a very exciting grad student conference.  I would like to
offer a few inexpensive alternatives to the official ones for
transportation and accomodation.

A couple of grad students here have volunteered to pick people up from
the airport on the Friday and Saturday before the airport.  It's a
relatively quick drive, but an expensive taxi ride.

If you're not sure that you can afford the hotel, there is also a youth
hostel located conveniently next to campus and within walking distance of
all events.

In the event that even the youth hostel will stretch your budget, a few
people can stay with grad students here who have graciously offered to
put people up.

If these alternatives sound enticing, please contact me at:

		ljenschk@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu

or feel free to call (614) 297-0253.

We're very excited about the conference and are really looking forward to
meeting everyone.

Subject: History of Yiddish

With respect to Shimen Kass's queries about the History of Yiddish, the
answers can be found, not surprisingly, in Max Weinreich' _History of the
Yiddish Language_, Chicago, 1980.

Subject: Skotsl kumt

Yude Rosof asks about _skotsl kumt_: A delicious expression which, in
Eastern Yiddish, is generally an expression of surprise (and welcome)
when an unexpected guest appears. Speakers rarely perceive it's probable
origin, and often reinterpret it in an effort to to make it more
intelligible. To wit:

"O, zey nor ver si du:, skotsl kint; khob im shoyn azoy lang nish
gezeyn." "skotsl kind kimt", and the like. (From Southeastern Yiddish
[kots] 'cat': "_sketsl kimt_".

Folk etymologies include _gots tsel_ 'God's shadow'. Don't believe it!

In Western Yiddish, the expression _gotl_ or _kotl kum_ is said only by
women. Men say _sholem aleykhem_.

Etymology? A reasonable suuggestion is a medieval German expression,
something like _bis got willkommen_. Are there German sources to support
this?

Another proposal (whose proponent will be named, if he concurs) is a
possible Northern German form, more or less like _kohsl_. I've never
pursued this suggestion and would be grateful for any light that can be
shed on it.

Subject: Skotsl kumt

I'm afraid I don't have more to add for Yude Rozof's question about
Skotsl. The way I've heard it, the phrase is "Skotsl kumt a gast iz do".
And the way it was told to me, was that one said this derogatorily when a
woman walked into a room. I'm as puzzled as Yude, and would like to hear,
especially from the native speakers (native speakers taught me the phrase
and tried to convey the sense of it, which I never quite grasped).

Subject: Kibitz, shemhitl

In 4.341 Paul Pascal replied to inquiries by Berel Leiser (4.332) about
the word _kibitz_ and by Kalman Weiser (4.333) about the expression
_oyston dem shem-hitl_.  I would offer the following additions.

In 2.057 I provided a commentary on _kibitz_ (based largely on H. L.
Mencken), tracing the word back to the name of an Austrian general's dog.

As for _shem(-)hitl_, Leibush Lehrer includes it in a list of rare words
from Polish Yiddish in a 1942 note in _Yidishe shprakh_ (v. 2, no. 2, p.
48).  He gives _kharpe_ as a synonym, and provides the following example:
"Ven er zol kenen aropvarfn fun zikh zayn shemnitl un zogn khotati, volt
a sakh beser geven."

Fraynd Pascal suggests a connection with the proverb "afn ganef brent dos
hitl," which has parallels in both Russian ("na vore shapka gorit") and
Polish ("na zlodzieju czapka gore"--attested since the 17th century).  In
both languages too the proverb is usually explained as being connected
with an anecdote about a thief whose guilt gives him away when someone
yells "The thief's hat is on fire!"  There's also a lovely Yiddish
variant:  "Afn ganef in tsilinder brent dos hitl nit" (i.e., if the thief
is rich enough to wear a top hat, he probably doesn't feel guilty).

Subject: Kizshina [sic] diadi Toma

Larry Rosenwald asked about a reference by Yankev Glatshteyn to
_Kizshina diadi Toma_ (4.280).  This is a slight distortion of
the Russian title of _Uncle Tom's Cabin_, namely, _Khizhina
diadi Toma_.

Subject: Setting up a Yiddish class

At our local temple, we have a few people relatively fluent in mama
loshen Yiddish. The Second and third generation American  members are so
fascinated to hear the few speak in the language of their parents and
grandparents. They have been begging for a class to be set up at the
temple.

We have 4-5 Yiddish speakers willing to give it a try but have no
experience in teaching a language. Are there any good literature,
primers, methods, etc.. available to assist these "teachers"?

Once we get them started, the next step will be to introduce them to
Mendele.

Thanks for any help you may be able to provide.

Neil Baker
