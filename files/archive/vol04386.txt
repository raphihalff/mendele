Subject: Toronto festival: Ashkenaz, a festival of new Yiddish culture

Over the past two decades, Jewish artists have been returning to their
European roots in search of information and inspiration. What began as a
North American revival of traditional forms has blossomed into a uniquely
contemporary expression, propelling Yiddish culture beyond revival into
the modern world.

From July 4 through 9, 1995  Harbourfront Centre in Toronto, Canada will
see an unprecedented gathering  of  "Yiddish" performance and visual
artists at the world's first public event of its kind, Ashkenaz: a festival
of new Yiddish culture.

Working in music, theatre, modern dance, storytelling, literature, film ,
visual arts, and crafts, these artists will come together for a weekend
of performance,  exploration and celebration of the unfolding world of
Yiddish-based cultural expression.

Some of the artists and performances scheduled include (subject to change):

        klezmatics, the flying bulgar klezmer band + 4, shirim

Subject: Yiddish Panorama

Those of you who are in easy distance of Toronto would really enjoy the
exibition "Yiddish Panorama: 1000 Years of Yiddish Language, Literature
and Culture" which is on exhibit at the Robarts Library of the University
of Toronto from April 3rd to the 31st of May.  Barry Walfish and his
committee have filled fourteen cases with books, pictures, posters and
other material all having to do with Yiddish and life in Yiddish, both in
Europe and in North America.  A very informative catalogue accompanies
the exhibition.

Subject: Got fun Avrom

Dovid Braun wrote that Got fun Avrom was a women's prayer in Eastern
Europe and a Men's in West Europe.

It seems that it was the custom of some for men, women, and children in
Eastern Europe to say Got fun Avrom.  The Berditchever recommended that
everyone three times.

Tayere Fraynt,

A zeesn Peysakh ale Mendelniks. Vifl teg hobn mir gevandert in midbar on
Mendele?

         Volt kayn Noyekh nit gevezn,
         Iz kayn Mendele nit gevezn,
         Zenen mir ale umitik gevezn,
         Dayenu.

In all your names, I would like to elevate Noyekh's status to CEO, as we now
see he is most definitely more than a shamas extraordinaire.

Ikh bin shoin vider mitn vandershtok in hant; ikh for tzu di kinder oif
Peysakh, un benk shoin nokh di oysyelekh velche veln darfn vartn oif mir in
computer a gantze vokh.

Subject: Correction of misquoted proverb

In my quoted proverb about a "poretz" (Mendel Vol. 4.381) a "lamed" was
inadvertently omitted in the word "shlekhtn".  The correct reference is
to a "shlekhtn poretz".  Sorry.

Borekh hashem, tsurikgekumen der shames. Shoyn a bisl oysgeheylt di

loshn.

It was probably inevitable that given the nature of Sholem-Aleykhem's
humorous disposition he should find a kindred spirit in Nikolai Gogol.
That was evident in 1894 when he wrote a letter to the publisher of the
Pittsburgh, Pa. Yiddish paper, Di Toyb.  He asked if there was a Jewish
theater in Pittsburgh and if it was possible for the theater to stage one
of his plays, a comedy a la "Inspector General" by Gogol.

Why Sholem-Aleykhem thought it was "a la Gogol" is not clear to me.
Possibly it was because in both plays, people carrying on bureaucratic
maneuvers do not know what they are doing, pretend they do, mislead and
are easily misled into senseless action.

Sholem-Aleykhem's play was *Yaknehoz,* printed in 1894 in Russia but
confiscated by the censor due to denunciation by Kiev stock merchants who
recognized themselves among the play's characters. [Forgeyer un
Mittsaytler, by Nachman Meisel, New York: Ikuf Farlag, 1946, pp. 89-90.]
