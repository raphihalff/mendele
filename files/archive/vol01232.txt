Shloyme Axelrod;

Here's the text of DER INTERNATSIONAL

Shteyt oyf ir ale ver vi shklafn
In hunger lebn, muz un noyt.
Der gayst, er vekt, er ruft zum vafn.
In kamf undz firn iz er greyt.
Di velt fun gvaldtatn (not gvaldhaytn in my version)
     opshafn veln mir un dan,
Fun frayhayt glaykhhay a ganeydn
Bashafn vet der arbetsman.
(All stand)
Dos is shoyn undzer letster un antsheydnder shtrayt.
Mit dem internatsional, sheyt oyf ir arbetslayt.
(repeat refrain)

An andershmol vel ikh aykh oylernen vi me zingt "Hold the
Fort" af yidish.

Eli Katz

Mikhl Herzog:

I'll get back to you soon.  I don't have time to keep up
with mendele and still get any work done.

Subject: RE: Mendele Vol 1.226

does anyone know anything about other word processors for
MACINTOSH in Hebrew/Yiddish?  i'm getting desperate.  MIT
Hillel's MacInHebrew was fine a few systems ago, but it's
now very complex, with no wraparound, etc, etc.

Linguists Software is a monstrosity, drawing on the Israeli
Mac System.  

i'm getting a demo disk from Nisus: its creators like it.
does anyone have experience & knowledge of it?

(personally, i need a word-processor that can handle
English and Hebrew -- the latter with a "transliterated"
keyboard -- with quf under Q, vav under W, etc. (instead
of, or in addition to, an Israeli lay-out).)

thanks for any help,

Dovid Braun asks:

      ...are you sure you can be Person A (i.e., the
      greeter, as opposed to the greetee) and greet your
      interlocutor with _gut-yor_ (not on rosheshone, that
      is)? Walking up to someone and being the first to
      speak and saying _gut-yor_ seems very odd to me.
      Have you heard this, or is it just the "logical"
      thing you thought of for when you need a neutral term
      for two people, one still shabesdik and the other
      vokhedik?

Dovid, I am sure I have heard it.  And I have said
it myself to some great, such as Sh.Z.Oyerbach,
still shabesdik, on his way to shul just as I was
coming out, already vokhedik.  But I have been
going to the same shul for 19 years now and I may
have invented the damn thing during that time.

So much for living witnesses.  Gut yor!
