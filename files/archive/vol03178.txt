      Subject: Pishy Pashy

      Pishy Pashy was a card game played by Eastern European Jews in
      this country. Can you have the Mendele folks give me a reading
      on it. Why this game? Where did it come from? Why this
      name--any connection with the diminutive for urination? Was it
      a "woman's game," as we seem to recall only women playing it?
      This is serious stuff.

      Best, Len

Subject: yiddish bibliography

a hearty thanks to bob rothstein for starting the ball rolling on
the bibliography! but, while annotated entries like his would be
great, i don't want to scare off those who just have references sans
annotations. send me what you've got, annotated or not.

Subject: Jewish languages -- Judezmo/Ladino

Lewis Leavitt (MENDELE 3.177) requests references for Jewish
languages other than Yiddish, and in that connection I would like to
bring to his (and everyone's attention) the following, brand-new
publication on Judezmo:

BUNIS, David M.  A Lexicon of the Hebrew and Aramaic Elements in
Modern Judezmo.  Jerusalem:  The Magnes Press, 1993. ISBN
965-223-803-1

>From the dust jacket:  "This is the first comprehensive dictionary
of the Hebrew and Aramaic component of Modern Ottoman Judezmo -- the
traditional language of the Turkish and Balkan Sephardim,
descendants of the Jews exiled from Spain in 1492.  Its over 5000
entries and subentries reveal popular pronunciations of the words as
well as the creative grammatical constructions, imaginative semantic
innovations, and idiomatic expressions, proverbs and sayings
incorporating Hebrew and Aramaic elements, which form a part of the
unique Jewish subculture created by the Ottoman Sephardim.  THE
DICTIONARY IS PRECEDED BY AN OVERVIEW OF THE JUDEZMO (also known as
Judeo-Spanish, Ladino) LANGUAGE IN ITS HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT, and
an analysis of the Hebrew and Aramaic elements used by Judezmo
speakers before the modern period covered by the dictionary."  (My
emphasis -- ZB.)

David Bunis, who has taught Judezmo language and linguistics at the
Hebrew University since 1980, did his graduate studies in linguis-
tics at Columbia and was a research fellow at YIVO's Max Weinreich
Center for Advanced Jewish Studies, before going on aliyah.  He is
also the compiler of a book-length bibliography, "Sephardic Studies"
(New York:  Garland, 1981).

Subject: Ameratses

As the proverb says, "Az Got vil shtrofn an amorets, leygt er im a
loshn-koydesh-vort in moyl arayn."  In my quotation from Yudel Mark
in Mendele 3.177, the word for "examples" should have been _dugmes_
and not _doygmes_.  But then, as I tell my students, my greatest
strength as a speaker of foreign languages is a good intuition about
when I'm probably wrong and should check in a dictionary.
