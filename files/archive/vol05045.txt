Subject: Di yunginke Memloket

A recent Washington Post story called to mind a Yiddish song that I
learned in New York during the late 1930's at _banketn_ and _kontsertn_
that my Communist parents took me to.  The story revealed that the
seven-year-old girl happily being held in the arms of a beaming Stalin in
1936 in a much-reproduced propaganda photograph and sculpture was the
daughter of an agriculture official in Siberia.  In 1938, the father was
executed (presumably on trumped-up charges, as the custom was then) as a
Japanese spy, Trotskyite, etc.  The daughter, Engelsina Markizova, was
now obviously an embarrassment, so the _identity_ of the kid in the photo
and statue was changed; she was now said to be Mamlakat Nakhangova, a
highly productive 13-year-old cotton-picker from the south of the Soviet
Union.

The song, about the meeting of Stalin and the girl, was obviously written
after the transformation; I can remember only a snatch of the melody and
words, but it referred to _khaver Stalin_, of course, and to _di
yu'nginke Memloke't_.  Does some other Mendelyaner know the music and/or
words?

(Incidentally, Engelsina Markizova, 66, now lives in Moscow, according to the
Post.)

Subject: Yoytsres once again

Reb Mikhl Herzog wrote that "yoytsres" and "yoytsrim" (the two variant
plurals of "yoytser") are phonologically anomalous, because they don't
exhibit variation in the quality of the stressed vowel.  (The pattern
would predict yoytser/yotsres/yotsrim.)

Something in my gut tells me that this word sticks more closely to its
loshnkoydesh version than other borrowings because it is mostly used in a
religious setting.  (Then again, it's probably used most as part of the
idiom--but idioms are funny.)  Might there be an alternate pattern for
exclusively religious words?

Regarding the geographical spread of "yoytser/yoytsres", Reb Mikhl
mentioned that only the singular form is recorded in the Carpathians, and
only the plural in the Ukraine (usually as part of the idiom).  My
grandmother, a native Minkatcher (Minkatch is in the Carpathian mountains),
used the plural "yoytsres", and then used the singular "yoytser" in
explaining to me what it meant.

As for the phrasing of the idiom:  I always heard 'fardreyen di
yoytsres', never 'farbayten'.  I looked up 'baytn' in the dictionary, and
found that it means to switch;  I had never seen or heard the word
before.  Am I right in suspecting that fardreyen has a more mocking,
pejorative tone? Is the idiom most common with 'fardreyen' or 'farbaytn'?

Subject: The Ashkenaz event

I am still flying from "Ashkenaz", the spectacular Yiddish cultural
festival in Toronto which culminated yesterday (Sunday).  I have never
experienced such an outpouring of joy in the Yiddish language and its
sister arts of music, dance, theater and art/craft, as I did here these
past few days.  For me, at least, the only frustration came from being
torn between two, sometimes three, wonderful events scheduled opposite
each other.

Mendele is a forum for Yiddish language and literature, so I won't linger
on the *mayles* of the music and so on (I couldn't do it all justice
anyway), but I have at least to comment on the *zise, geshmake Yidish*
which so many of the performers used in speech or in song.  It was a
deep, deep nourishment for the ear and the heart.  The swelling and
enthusiastic throngs in the audiences, day after day, were of all ages,
but the performers seemed mainly in their 20's, 30's and 40's, all
meticulous in their accent, grammar, vocabulary and respect for the
Yiddish tongue and its possibilities.  For performers such as Adrienne
Cooper, Irena Klepfisz, Michael Alpert (of Brave Old World), Shura
Lipovsky (of Lipovsky/Mlotek/Warshauer Trio), and many, many, many
others, the obvious appreciation for the beauty in the sound of Yiddish
words, backed by a deep knowledge, understanding, and love of the soul
within those words, resonated to all who had the privilege of hearing
them, there at the edge of Lake Ontario. As Alpert quotes in his program
notes, "Oyb di velt vet vern oysgeleyzt, iz nor in skhus fun kinder" ("If
the world is to be saved, it will only be on the merits of children.")

I feel privileged to have experienced "Ashkenaz".
