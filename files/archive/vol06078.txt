Subject: Viazoy zogt men "computer virus" af yidish?

I am not referring here to the general type of virus, the simple,
microscopic organism that is smaller than a bacterium, capable of
invading the human body, and causing discomfort and disease.  For this
type of virus Yiddish accepted the medical term virus, but pronounces it
_vIrus_, with a khirik yud.

My question concerns the specific type of virus that invades a computer.

For the term _computer_ itself, I do not believe we need in Yiddish
another word.  It is by now an internationalism, and _compyuter_ may as
well be incorporated in Yiddish.

But for the term virus in the restricted sense when it enters a
computer, I propose the short and sharp Hebrew-Yiddish word _shed_
[ghost].

If such a shed should, khas vekholile, make its quarters in your
"makheray'ke" -- an endearing diminutive term for your computer that in
many ways can do so many remarkable things --, it is capable of damaging
or completely destroying your hardware, software, and built-in  memory,
and erase all your stored documents.  It will have itself a jolly fine
time of a panDEMONium, an uproarious _sheydim tants_ [ghosts' dance].

I deeply regret that, in my limited wisdom, all I can do is offer an
appropriate term in Yiddish for a computer virus, but, unfortunately,
not an antidote for it.

Subject: Yiddish courses and libraries

Shalom Goldberg asked [6.074] about Yiddish programs and libraries.

According to the Less Commonly Taught Languages Project at the U. of
Minnesota National Language Resource Center, Yiddish is taught in 19
institutions in North America:

Baltimore Hebrew U, Brandeis, Columbia, Duke, Emory, George Washington
U, Harvard, Hebrew Union College, JTSA, Los Angeles Valley College,
Rutgers, Temple U, Touro College, UCLA, U of Chicago, U of Maryland at
College Park, U of Pennsylvania, U of Toronto, and U of Texas at Austin.
Details, including some course description (courtesy of Mendele
subscribers Janet Hadda, Ellen Kellman, and others) are available in
Shtetl (http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/school.html). Some course
descriptions were submitted a year or two ago and might be not current.
Updates would be greatly appreciated.

Libraries with significant Yiddish collections and on-line catalogs
include (in an approximate order of the collection size): Library of
Congress, Harvard, JTSA, McGill University, Hebrew University,
University of Texas at Austin, Brandeis University, University of
Toronto, University of California Libraries, Yale University, New York
Public Library, University of Haifa, Oxford University. Links to these
catalogs are provided from the Shtetl's library -

Subject: Alexander Pomerants

I have been trying to find out what became of the writer A. Pomerants
after the mid-1930s. He was born in Grodne in 1901, came to the U.S. in
1921 (N.Y.), got a teaching certificate for the Arbeter-Ring. He was
very involved in left-wing literary/journalist scene of 1920s: member
and secretary of yunger arbeter shrayber farayn, assistant to Moishe
Olgin at journal _Hamer_ and on editorial board of the _Frayhayt_.
Avade, member of the Communist Party. In 1932 he returned to the Soviet
Union. In 1935, published a book _Proletpen_ (Kiev). It seems he also
used pseudonyms in his publications, i.e. Yehoyshe Grodner)

Do any Mendelniks know more?

A sheynem dank aykh,

Subject: Registrtaions in Yiddish in higher education

Mendelyaner may be interested to know that in the Modern Language
Association's most recent (Fall, 1995) census of credit-bearing foreign
language enrollments in 2,772 two- and four-year institutions of higher
education, Yiddish joined many Asian, American Indian, and other
nonEuropean less commonly taught languages (e.g., Persian, Hausa,
Tagalog; also American Sign Language) in showing a marked increase over
the enrollments recorded in 1990.  15 students were enrolled in Yiddish
language classes (or languages in which reading and discussion were
conducted primarily in Yiddish) in 2-year institutions, 614 in such
classes in four year institutions, 27 in graduate courses (1995).  In
1990, there were 3 two-year college enrollments reported and 344
four-year and graduate (combined) enrollments.
