(I suspect that our friend Chabon has lost his sense of what Yiddish is),
and says that the traveler needs the guide book like a hole in the
head...because one needs a _land_where one speaks ONLY Yiddish.. He
doesn't understand that our whole WORLD is our 'land', and where one
goes, one can find a friend who speaks Yiddish .... and can even use a
few words from the guide book (not the expressions I talked about)...

Listen up friend Chabon. A number of us have gotten together and created
a dictionary of chemistry, in Yiddish!! (I hope it will come out in a
short time)....And who needs it ....?? WE need it because it is our
Yiddish CULTURE.....for the same reason the Guide for Travellers is
needed....throughout the world...

 This is Yiddish Culture we are talking about, that is having its new
uprising....Even though khaver Chabon doesn't see the forest for the
trees, there is a whole forest growing out there, without a country.....

Subject: The Weinreichs' book on Yiddish phrases for travelers

The Weinreichs were not alone!

I have a 12-inch LP called "Conversa-phone's Round-The-Word YIDDISH
Language Record Course" (label number CX-156).  The record seems to have
been mastered in July 1967.  It makes no mention of customs or airports,
but covers such items as  registrirn zikh in hotel,  post amt,  baym
dentist,  u.a.

My reaction to the record was, Where would I need this?  (As opposed to
making your vacation more enjoyable, or less expensive, because you could
speak someone's language.)

Subject: Weinreich's "Say it in Yiddish"

In Mendele 7.028, A. Joseph Ross <lawyer@world.std.com> wrote:

>Since they were putting out a series of phrase books for travellers, the

I don't find that strange at all.  When I was younger it was common knowledge 
that a Jew travelling anywhere in the Western Hemisphere, Europe or Israel 
would be able to communicate with other Jews using Yiddish.  I've seen it done 
countless times, with varying degrees of success, by people whose Yiddish is a 
lot less fluent than mine.  And I can't begin to relate how many times I've 
been approached by strangers in Israel, Europe and North America asking if I 
speak Yiddish (I have a trimmed full beard and wear a yarmulke or a hat all 
the time).  The bottom line is that it's easier to learn a little bit of 
Yiddish than to learn a little French, a little Spanish, a little Hungarian, a 
little Rumanian, a little Czech, ....  You get the idea. Also, don't forget 
that the book was written almost 40 years ago, when there were a lot more 
Yiddish speakers around in places outside the USA and Canada.

Then in Mendele 7.029, Michael Chabon <mchabon@earthlink.com>, the author 
of the article in _Civilization_ that caused all this ruckus, wrote:

>People who get the piece recognize, first of all, that a book which
>explicitly advertises itself, on the cover, in capital letters, as a
>PHRASEBOOK FOR TRAVELLERS, naturally, logically, and commercially implies
>the existence of a country to be travelled to.  A country.  

Even after all the discussion of this article, including the author's comments, 
I'm still not certain what is meant by "getting" the article. If Mr. Chabon's 
article was so obscure that only a fraction of its readers "got" it, then it 
must lack some element of clarity.  I suppose I'll have to hit the library and 
see if I can scare it up and see for myself if I "get" it.

However, I have to take issue with the author's inference that there has to be 
a country where Yiddish is spoken in order for a "PHRASEBOOK FOR TRAVELLERS" 
to have any utility.  It seems to me that this flawed inference is the crux of 
the entire problem for those of us who take issue with his article. I contend 
that, at least at the time the book was written, there were many places in the 
world where Yiddish was widely enough used that it would have been useful to 
have a smattering of Yiddish, perhaps not at an airline counter, but certainly
for asking directions in the street or ordering food in a restaurant. Even 
today, many older residents of Crown Heights, Boro Park, Toronto, Mexico City, 
Buenos Aires, Antwerp, Vilnius, Riga, Bnei Brak, Jerusalem and quite a few 
other places are more comfortable in Yiddish than in the local official 
language.

Mr. Chabon continues:

> Where, in 1997, could you go that it would behoove you to know how to
>say, in Yiddish, "Which way to the casino?"

In my view this is a non-argument.  By the same token, why bother learning 
_any_ foreign language if you speak English?  After all, no matter what 
tourist destination you choose almost anywhere in the world, you can almost 
always find at least one English speaker whose brain you can pick for 
directions.  On the other hand, I like to think that my life has been enriched 
by my fluency to a greater or lesser degree in over half a dozen languages and 
reading ability in almost twice as many more.

>The second thing people who get the piece recognize, I think, is that

I believe Mr. Chabon is absolutely correct in this observation, and I'm 
certain that many, if not most, of the Mendele readership would agree with 
him on this point.

>There is no nation to take the Weinreichs' little phrasebook to; for every
>other language in the series, such a country exists.  That difference
>saddens me.

... and the rest of us as well.

As for Mr. Chabon's unhappy correspondence with Ms. Beatrice Weinreich, I can 
only say that it is he who still doesn't "get" it.  He may "love being Jewish" 
and "love language and humor" and feel that his "only desire was to report 
faithfully how the book made me feel, and the fancies it conjured in my 
imagination."  Of course, no one can fault him for how he feels about the 
issue, but it seems to me that this feeling stems at least in part from his 
sharing the popular but quite inaccurate opinion that Yiddish has already 
entered the world of Latin, Sanskrit and Gothic.

>As for the English speaking traveller, if I had been going to Israel in 1959, 
>say, I doubt I would have chosen an English-Yiddish phrasebook to be my 
>companion.

Perhaps not, but my personal experience there ten years later indicates to me 
that it would have been far from useless.

>The more I thought about, and imagined this country, the sadder I felt at its
>absence, a sadness which --for me, the only person I ever claimed to be
>speaking for--no amount of extinct Soviet republics, Chasidic neighborhoods,
>and Yiddish preservation and renewal societies will ever completely abate.

I don't think anyone can fault Mr. Chabon for these feelings; I would imagine 
that most Mendelyaners share many of them.  What I took issue with in the 
first place was his apparent lack of respect for just how widespread and alive 
Yiddish culture was in Ashkenaz before it was eradicated some fifty-odd years 
ago.  Now that we've illuminated the issue with our discussions and (hopefully) 
isolated those aspects of it that trouble us, perhaps we can agree to disagree 
amicably where our opinions diverge.

I'd like to apologize for writing such a long response to these postings, and 
specifically to anyone I may have offended in so doing.  I had no intention of 
boring people with my personal views; I was trying, as much for others as for 
myself, to isolate the cause of my initial revulsion, and apparently that of 
other people as well, at reading about the article in _Civilization_.

Zayt mir ale gezunt un shtark.
