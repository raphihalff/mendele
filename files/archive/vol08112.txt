Saul (Shoyel) Goodman died last week at the age of 97.  Goodman was for many
years the director of the Sholem Aleichem Folk Institute. He was the author
of a number of books, among them Traditisie un Banayung, (Tradition and
Renewal)  1967, Der Derekh fun Sholem-Aleykhem-Institut (The Path of the SA
Folk Institute), 1972, Di Andershkayt fun Amerikaner Yidntum (The
Differentness of American Jewry), 1980, and in English, The Faith of Secular
Jews, 1976.  He came to America in 1921 and began teaching in the Workmen's
Circle schools in 1929.  He continued teaching until sometime in the 1970's
and it was in that capacity that I came to know him.  I was fortunate to be
one of his students in a number of courses in Education at the Jewish
Teachers' Seminary Herzliah.

Goodman was his own special person, and even though he was very much a
member of his generation, he was unique. He was one of the keenest minds and
sharpest wits I have ever had the privilege to study with. I am sure that
his wit probably cost him more than one friend and made him some enemies,
but even here, he could with one word or phrase cut right to the heart of
the matter.  His intellectual curiosity and erudition was amazing. 

He would often say that his name was "Shoyel" (which means "to ask") not
"Shaul" because he was always asking the eternal questions. It was true.
While I often had the sense about some of the older "Yidishe kultur-tuers"
that they let their knowledge and ideology rest on books that they had read
in their youth, this was not the case with Goodman.

He was constantly reading and learning, engaging with the world, and
particularly with the world of ideas. His ideas never got fossilized but
were constantly evolving. He was really the best that secular Judaism has to
offer, one of its profoundest thinkers and philosophers.

I feel that maybe he will come back into vogue some day soon because Saul
Goodman has a lot to say to a generation that is looking for a positive
defintion of what it means to be secular.  To a world that generally thinks
that being a "secular Jew" means not belonging to a synagogue and therefore
being assimilated, Goodman offers a different vision. In his teaching and in
his writing in both Yiddish and English, he argues that being a "veltlekher" 
secular Jew does not mean simply "NOT being religious"  but that it carries
with it a rich and complex ideology and tradition. Saul Goodman taught me
(and several generations of students) that secular Judaism was a highly
creative and rich way of life. To a world that saw being Jewish as
narrowing, he showed that being Jewish should be just the opposite. It
should not prohibit us from engaging with the world, but rather, should
inform and enhance our interaction with the outside world. To children he
taught that Jewishness was a treasure that had been passed down to them.
(That was his metaphor. I remember he said, that when children asked why
they should bother to learn about being Jewish, he would tell them, "Let's
say somebody gave you a box with a treasure, wouldn't you, at least like to
open it up and see what is inside?").  I think, unfortunately, the secular
Jewish world has not lived up to his hopes and ideals, but this in no way
minimizes the depth and beauty of his vision.

He was not just a talker but a listener. He cared about what his students
had to say. I was also always struck by his love of his wife Sorke (who
passed away just a short while ago). For well over a decade she suffered
from Alzheimer's but he remained utterly devoted to her, and the fact that
he could maintain this devotion during her long illness is a tribute to his
menshlekhkayt. He was a man of principle and he lived by those principles. I
feel fortunate that I had a chance to be a student of Saul Goodman.
