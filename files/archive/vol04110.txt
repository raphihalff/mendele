Subject: Romanization

It seems very appropriate to me that the YIVO romanization of Yiddish
words of Hebrew origin should be based on their pronun- ciation in
Yiddish and should be represented according to the same phonetic system
used for words of (say) Germanic or Slavic origin.  There is still some
question, as Yude Rozof has pointed out, concerning Hebrew words in a
Yiddish context that have never been adopted into Yiddish proper.  Here,
I think one would like to treat them as foreign words and spell them "the
foreign way"; but, if this procedure requires extra diacritical marks or
symbols not commonly used in the romani- zation of Yiddish, then it may
be burdensome.  By analogy, Polish words in the middle of a Yiddish
context are respelled "the Yiddish way", are they not?  But that's
because they have been converted from Roman letters to Hebrew letters and
then back to Roman again.  (Is this convention really necessary?)

The real anomaly, from my point of view, is that words of Hebrew origin
are spelled the same way in Yiddish as they are in Hebrew *in the Hebrew
alphabet*.  It seems to me that, if a Hebrew word has been fully adopted
into Yiddish and has acquired a definite Yiddish pronunciation, then it
should be spelled phonetically according to the YIVO system, even when
using Hebrew letters. These words should be regarded as being fully
naturalized into Yiddish.  Instead, Yiddish words of Hebrew origin have
always been awarded a special status, an exemption from the phonetic
orthography prevailing over words derived from other languages. >From a
practical point of view, it means that someone (like myself) who wants to
learn how to read Yiddish cannot even pronounce these words, without
studying Hebrew also!  (The vowels are almost never indicated, anyway, in
these words.)

So my proposal is that the YIVO romanization be retained and that the
Hebraic spelling be regularized by analogy with it. Of course, this will
horrify many people:  the idea of using the Hebrew alphabet to spell
Hebrew words in a radical new and untraditional way is outlandish.  But
my point is that they are *not* Hebrew words anymore; they are Yiddish.

Subject: Transcription of Yiddish

Dismayed as I was by Aharon Meytahl's scheme for writing Yiddish in roman
script, I have been much too busy inefficiently trying to meet a number
of deadlines to compose a reasonably good response. I am, therefore,
grateful to Yude Rozof for his carefully written discussion, with good
examples, of the topic. (I myself, perhaps a year ago, wrote a fairly
long comment on something like "Transcription vs. Transliteration.")

I hasten to add that I heartily agree with Shleyme Axelrod that no rule
should be imposed in Mendele that would drive away the many members who
do not care to make the effort to learn a conventional transcription
system, such as the widely used Yivo system.

Subject: Motl and other songs

I asked recently for the Yiddish words of "Bay Mir Bistu Shayn", and I
now have those words, thanks to Mendele. The singer in our Klezmer Band
also wants to sing "Motl" and "Ikh hob dich tsufil lieb".  Can anyone
help with 1) the Yiddish words, 2) English words if they exist?

Subject: Letter to Congressman about Yiddish and the Census Bureau

This is a copy of my letter to Thomas C. Sawyer, Ohio Democrat, Chairman
of the House Subcommittee that oversees the Census Bureau.

To the Honorable Thomas C. Sawyer, U.S. House of Representatives:

While the Census Bureau is making its multi-phasic preparations for the
Census of the year 2000, may I respectfully call your attention to one
particular aspect.

My enclosed article, _Yiddish and the Census Bureau_, published in the
_Congress Monthly_, official organ of the Ameriucan Jewish Congress,
spells out in detail my special concern.  My sharp and exhaustive
critique of the Yiddish translation of the 1990 Census Questionnaire was
also published in the _Jewish Press_ (Brooklyn), in the language quarterly
_Verbatim_, and in the literary Yiddish journal _afn shvel_.

It is the need of Yiddish-speaking citizens that the next Yiddish
translation of the Census Questionnaire not be an insult to our eyes and
ears, indeed to our past, and be done in a respectful manner with proper
regard for the language and its structures.

Only such a translation will accomplish the purpose of having Yiddish-
speaking citizens participate fully and joyfully in the endeavor of a
complete national count.

While I do not know how the other 31 foreign language translations of the
Questionnaire fared, I appeal here as a native Yiddish speaker and
Yiddish writer.

Since you are a former English teacher, I am sure of your deep sense of
regard and respect for all languages.  But the respect that, I believe,
we owe Yiddish is a special case.

During World War II six million Jews were murdered, about four-and-a-half
million of them Yiddish speakers.

I see Yiddish, lost and bewildered, in tattered clothes and with ash on
her head, wandering from one shtetl to another, mourning after her
children whose mother tongue was cut out.

May I respectfully ask you and your Committee to make certain that the
Yiddish translation of the Census Questionnaire for the year 2000 will
meet all lawful language requirements of Yiddish.

Subject: Address change

Since I have posted questions to various mendelniks recently, I would
like to advise that I have changed my address on Mendele today, from
Evelyn Feins to M.Feins@Genie.Geis.Com.

Subject: What to do if/when Mendele stops

I apologize for taking up time and space with housekeeping but sometimes
it's necessary.

Until recently we used to get a lot of bounced mail: copies of Mendele
that couldn't get delivered for one reason or another.  Now it
seems such names are being automatically deleted by the listserver.

Instead we get letters from subscribers asking why they don't get Mendele
any more.

The answer (in general) is: something was wrong with your account or your
machine.  Nothing personal.  If you haven't heard from Mendele in a week
it's highly likely that something went wrong with your subscription.

The solution is straightforward.  Instead of writing to the shames (who
will simply repeat this message), please resubscribe.  The procedure
remains:

        sub mendele firstname lastname

to

        listserv@yalevm.ycc.yale.edu

Un zayt mir gezunt!
