Subject: Lkoved a bal-nayntsiker

With deep respect and admiration, I honor  Zellig Bach, a Yiddish
scholar whose knowledgeable postings resound into excellence on Mendele,
on his upcoming 90th birthday on January 2nd.

A bal-nayntsiker darf men take bazingen! Spetsiel aza mentsh vi Zellig!

I wonder if all his friends on Mendele are aware of his enormous
significance and generosity in his passion for perpetuating Yiddish.

Zellig has subsidized in full the YIVO reprint editions of Uriel
Weinreich's Modern English-Yiddish/Yiddish-English Dictionary, and
Nokhem Stutshkov's Oytser (Thesaurus of the Yiddish Language).

Currently, he is subsidizing YIVO's whole Max Weinreich project, namely
a reprint edition of the translation into English of Max Weinreich's
first two volumes of his Geshikhte fun der Yidisher Shprakh (which is
out of print), and a newly commissioned translation into English and
publication of the remaining third and fourth volumes in Yiddish of Max
Weinreich' opus.

And where to begin to extol his input: his essence, his tone, his honed
style and ever-fascinating content, on Mendele. He is our man for all
subjects - linguistics, syntax, customs, literature, poetry, quotations,
un nokh un nokh....

Zellig has represented us all when republished in Der Bay under the Best
of Bach which became synonomous with the best of Mendele. Add to this
his love of language, and of Yiddish and Yiddishkeyt, and I think we've
got a winner who has enriched us all.

Wishing him robust health and happiness,

Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan

Subject: Yiddish in the liturgy

I can think of only one instance in which Yiddish has become part of the
daily liturgy. All the blessings are in Hebrew or Aramaic, as are the
prayers and even the shabbos zmiros: Yiddish appears only in the
introduction to the birkhes hamozn.

After a good deal of thought, here is what I think, for whatever it's
worth. As we know, the birkhes hamozn with its introdction, is said only
if three men at the table have eaten a k'zays (at least) of bread. These
three (or more) men are called a m'zumon, from the shoresh "zimen"
meaning to invite. They turn to one of the group and ask him to lead in
benshing after the meal. The famous siddur, Korbn Minkhe, even specifies
who this should be, "ven men bentsht mit a m'zumon, dan zogt _der
eltster_ tsuersht dos).  Whereas non-Yiddish speakers may say, "raboysay
n'vorekh", among Yiddish speakers and even traditionally oriented
Ashkenazim who may speak little Yiddish, the leader says, "Raboysay, mir
veln bentshn".

Why? Possibly because otherwise there would be a question: are these
introductory words an invitation or a notification? The problem is that
the Hebrew is ambiguous; it can mean either, "Gentlemen, let us bentsh"
or "Gentlemen, we are going to bentsh". This is not the place to discuss
Hebrew grammar, but take my word for it.  Hertz, for example, in his
English-Hebrew siddur gives the introduction as "Raboysay n'vorekh" and
translates it as, "Let us say grace". He contradicts himself immediately
in a footnote by saying, "Among Jews from Central and Eastern European
countries this is often said in Yiddish, "Raboisai mir wellen (sic)
benshen", and of course this means, prost un poshet, "we are going to
bentsh".

Older siddurim don't even give the Hebrew introduction. It is assumed
that only the Yiddish one will be used and is the only one given. Thus
Yiddish solves an ambiguity (ah there, Ellen Prince!). Since several men
may be at the table, it is reasonable to assume that not all of them
will be paying attention to the fact that grace is about to be said, so
the leader notifies, not invites. "Gentlemen", he says in effect, "Pay
attention: we are going to bentsh". The others bless the name of the Lord
and the leader continues, "Birshus raboysay, n'vorekh, sheokhalnu
mishloy". With your permission _let us bless_ because we have eaten from
what is His. Here the meaning of "n'vorekh" is unmistakable.

This should give the anti-Yiddish faction among the Zionists (and it
grows smaller every day) pause. What cannot be clearly and unambiguously
said in Hebrew, _can_ in Yiddish and Yiddish is the solution that has
been adopted.

Subject: Poetry of Yehoash and Zukofsky

I am interested in finding a "facing page" edition of the poetry of
Yehoash, with Yiddish on one side and English on the other. Does there
exist such an edition?  Where can it be purchased?

I am also interested in Yehoash's Yiddish translation of the Bible. Is
it available?

I am writing a thesis on Zukofsky.  Could anyone comment or refer me to
materials about the influence that Yehoash and other Yiddish poets had on
Zukofsky?

Many Thanks

Lisa Tomlinson

Subject: Grine verem

I would be interested in the origins of the yiddish expression "es kumt
mir on mit di grine verem."  I know it refers to something that was
very difficult to come by, but exactly why the use of "grine verem"?

Subject: Tsvinter

I want to thank Iosif Vaisman for his most interesting illustration of
the origins of  "Tsvinter"(Vol. 6.146).  It was concise and scholarly
without being hair-splitting or long-winded.  Yet I must say that I, as
one who simply loves using and discussing Yiddish, while not being as
grammar -oriented as some of your esteemed academic Yiddishists,  can
appreciate the depths of  discussion of some of the language issues.
After all, that is what Mendele is all about.  Yasher koyekh to one of
the best subscription lists on-line!
