Subject: Translation fees

I would like to have some current information about the fees for
translators from Yiddish to English.  The work I have in mind is about
100 typed Yiddish pages, single spaced.  Please reply privately to me if
you feel that this is an intrusion on Mendele's space.

Subject: Gut purim, gut purim....

I know two very different variations on this theme.  My mother, born in
Brooklyn of Litvak parents, recites it this way:

	Haynt iz Purim, morgn iz oys
	Git mir a peni ['penny'] un varft mir aroys.

My wife's parents, from Friedberg in Hessen, say this:

	Gut Purim, gut Purim, ihr liebe Leut',
	Wisst ihr all' was Purim bedeut'?
	Purim bedeut' ein langes Leben,
	Sollt ihr mir viel Purimgelt geben.

(I'm not too confident about German spelling, but this indicates the
pronunciation.)  I'd love to hear that this has a Yiddish source, but as
it stands it has nothing that marks it as Juedischdeutsch (other than,
maybe, the syntax of the last line, with verb-first consecutive order?).

Subject: Di Partizanke by Daniel Charney

Daniel Charney wrote a series of 10 articles about a woman partisan who
survived the holocaust.  The articles appeared in a Yiddish newspaper
called Der Tog in the Winter of 1956 or 1957. My mother was a friend of
Daniel Charney and is that woman partisan.

I would like to find those back issues of Der Tog and am seeking advice
on where to look.  I have tried the National Yiddish Book Center, but
they have mostly Yiddish magazines not newspapers.  I will also try the
Arbeter Ring and YIVO.

Can anyone recommend other sources?

Was Di Partizanke ever published in book form?  How could I find out?

Any advice is appreciated.  Thank you.

Leibel Yelgin
