Subject: An open letter to Philologus

New York, NY
April 1, 1994

Philologus, for shame!

	You lurk "hinter di kulyisn", we teach you everything we know,
and look at what we get. Your column of April 1 (Ah, April 1! Perhaps
that accounts for it!) is a disappointment to all your fans and admirers.
We've taught you better.

	Let's take it again slowly:

1. You say ". . . we do not find nasalized ayin . . . among Jews in
Germany and Austria". Really? "ma:nse/maynse" do occur in Germany and
"meynse" occurs in Holland. In all of the West, the feminine of "roshe"
is "reshante"!. And "ya(y)nkef" too! OK, so far?

2. Why "plot a map" when he map has already been plotted. It includes ALL
of the Western Yiddish area as well. (Yidisher shprakh-un kultur-atlas,
Volume I, Map 10). If you count the name "Yayngkev" too, and why not, the
map grows to include Yiddish in the Northeast as well.

3. "Why is it", you ask, "that most Yiddish words with ayin, even in the
manse/maynse area, are not nasalized, e.g., sho 'time' or 'hour'". Why,
indeed? You almost answer the question yourself by mentioning "daynge".

	It's apparently because the "ayin", itself, is not the decisive
factor. It's "hataf-patah" that counts. That's why nasalization occurs
with "alef" and "hey" as well: "ka:nsher", "ba:nsher", "ya:ndes" and, as
you mention "da(:)nges/daynges", too. The problem with "daynges" is that
it differs in the sequence of vowels in the Hebrew etymon which has
"shwa-hataf-patah"; all the other cases of nasalization have "patah-hataf-
patah". This leads Max Weinreich to reconstruct a Hebrew etymon "da'agah",
rather than the assumed "deagah".

4. Now, what's this about "how did the word [manse/maynse] turn back into
mayse in other parts of Eastern Europe?" Turn back into? What does that
mean? Why is it necessary to take the "magic wand" approach? That's for
turning young maidens into pumpkins or princes into frogs. Language
doesn't work that way.

	In every language community, variants coexist, correlated with
social and cultural factors, sex, age, education, religion, social class,
geographic region, or what have you. How this came to be in language, in
the first instance, is "a bazundere maynse" (to coin a phrase), probably
no different from the way in which man (writ large, Man) came to be
differentiated. The regionalization of different language features,
pronunciation, words and their meanings, etc. may be determined by
linguistic structural factors or a variety of topographical and man made
barriers to communication, as well as facilitators of communication, both
of which, by the way, have their genetic consequences too, "afile bay
undz".

	At points of contact, where variants clash, whether as a result
of migration or of diffusion in situ, variants may replace one another,
and the direction of change is determined either by linguistic structural
factors or by social factors; or some blend of the competing forms may
emerge, but they don't "turn into" one another. Sure, some ideal type
Hebrew etymon may be said to have "turned into" the variants we find in
all modern forms of Hebrew and in all the Jewish languages in which it
occurs, although it's probably better to say that the etymon "is
realized" in these different ways; but there's no need to think of these
realizations as "turning into" one another. Am I ranting?

	 So, what about "sho" and, to be seasonal, "moes" 'money' (as in
mo(e)s-khitn)? Why is the "ayin" not nasalized? Again, because it's not
"hataf-patah-ayin" but "komets-ayin", which comes in for its own very
special treatment, at least in western Germany: "shey/she:" and "me:s"
(alongside of "sho:" and "mo:s"; an indication, perhaps, of the general
use of "ayin" to represent [e] in Yiddish, not at all a self-evident or
predictable usage.

	To complicate matters somewhat, at some Western Yiddish
locations, in Alsace and western Germany, for example, even some words
with "hataf-patah-ayin" are rendered with [e:]: "neylimer" 'shoes',
"tseykenen" 'to shout'. This is not to be confused with the Dutch Yiddish
"meynse" and "yeynkef", "teynis" 'fast day' which reflect the regular
treatment of [ay] as in "tsayt" and "haynt".

	You assume that when Edward Stankiewicz and Sam Weiss refer to
Sephardim, they must be referring to northern Italy. Why? They could as
easily be referring to Holland where the contact between Yiddish and
Sephardim was close and where nasalization in Yiddish extends even to the
name of the letter "ngayin" itself. Furthermore, if I remember correctly,
nasalization of "ayin" also extends into the Whole Hebrew reading
tradition of the Dutch Ashkenazim. I assume that our Dutch Yiddish
specialist is lurking, too. Perhaps she could enlighten us further on the
subject.

7. Finally, let's talk about Italy. With respect to the nasalization
feature, I think we can say QED. I've demonstrated the geographic
connection that you find "lacking between northern Italy and parts of
Eastern Europe". It's of equal importance, now, to assert the historical
link between actual Yiddish speakers and northern Italy itself.

	Many years ago, Brendan Gill reviewed a new production of Shylock
in the New Yorker and was critical of the fact that Shylock was made to
sound as if he knew Yiddish. Yiddish? In Italy? He, like most others,
harbored the myth that there was no connection between the two. Am I
mistaken in reading this into what you say, too? In any event, Gill's
review prompted what may actually have been the last time I wrote a
letter to the editor (so to speak). Perhaps I'll get as nice a reply from
you as I did from him.

	Surely, I'm telling you what you already know, but indulge me.
Some Ashkenazic communities were transported, (that's a bad word) moved,
virtually in toto, from Germany to Italy during the period of the Black
Death and, by the middle of the 16th century, Italy was the center of a
flourishing Yiddish literature. Remember Elye Bokher! From your perch in
Jerusalem, you should have easy access to the specialists on the subject,
Khone Shmeruk and Khave Turnianski, at the Hebrew University.

	I've gone on too long. Forgive me. I remain among your loyal
readers.

Subject: Translation thanks, Litvish

Thanks to all who helped me find translations for "gloksne-boymer" and
"salte-noses." Of the latter, my dad hadn't heard of the term, but when
I related the descriptions posted here he declared that he could remember
what they tasted like. Sort of a Proustian moment ...

Jules Levin (Mendele 3.302) raises the question of how commonly Jews
spoke Lithuanian. If it's any help, here is an excerpt from my zeyde's
memoir, published in his landsmanshaft newsletter in 1930. The time
referenced is the 1880s in Keidan, Kovne gubernie. The translation is by
a novice (me) and thus open to correctn. (Places I'm really guessing are
marked with [?])
