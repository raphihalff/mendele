Subject: "forverts"

In Rick Turkel's reply to Kenneth Sipser's question about the word
_forverts_, he says: "Huh?  To me that spells "forverts," not "forvitz." New
Yawka or not, that second resh should be pronounced in Yiddish." 

Actually, I believe there are dialects of Yiddish (Central Yiddish, for one)
that drop postvocalic /r/, just as certain dialects of English (e.g. New York
English) do.

Subject: Forverts

The Yiddish-language newspaper "Forverts" took its name directly from the
German Social Democratic organ "Vorwaerts."  The tes-tsadik ending in Yiddish
reflects the orthography of the German model.  The word "forverts"  is a
by-now venerable daytshmerizm meaning "forward" -- however, I doubt whether
very many Yiddish speakers, now or in the past, ever used it except when
referring to the newspaper.  The correct Yiddish word for "forward" is
"foroys" (which has also served as the title of a number of Yiddish
periodicals).

Subject: "Forvitz"

In answer to Koppel Sipser's question about why the Yiddish newspaper does
not end in a tzadik instead of tess-samakh: 

About the spelling, vays Ikh nisht.  However, the paper's name is Forverts. 
Even the way that you spelled it out, Koppel, it still comes out Forverts.

Subject: Camp "No Worries" 

So far as I know and remember, Camp Nishtgedayget (my spelling based on my
mother's pronounciation) wasn't spelled in English, but in Yiddish -- that
was part of the point.  I never saw a photo or any letter about it that
wasn't in Yiddish.  As most of the people who went were Polish or Russian
Jews, spelling it in Litwak Yiddish would be strange.  Perhaps an English ad
did appear sometime in one of the "roite" English-language newspapers or
journals, but it seems not very likely. 

Coincidentally, my family also hailed from Paterson as did many of their
fellow campers.  After all. Paterson was about one-fourth Jewish.

Subject: student looking for klezmer musicians to interview

Hi - a student where I teach, majoring in music, wants to do a study of
American klezmer music, and would be very interested in knowing whether any
of the musicians who subscribe to MENDELE would be willing to talk with her,
or have any ideas of other musicians she should get in touch with.  If you're
interested or have ideas, you could get in touch with me, or you could write
her directly at rmorin@wellesley.edu (her name's Rebecca Morin).  A sheynem
dank, gmar khsime toyve,

Subject: on the road again

Altho I am not very musical, I am a Willy Nelson fan. The chorus line "on the
road again, we're (?) on the road again" has 5 beats, then 6 beats and I
think can be sung in Yiddish as tsurik tsum veg (with the tsu drawn out) 
                           mir geyn tsurik tsum veg
                           oy,oy tsurik tsum veg...
A gut gebentcht yor tsu alle, ayer kroyvim un khaverim.

Subject: College Yiddish courses

Christian Ferman asks about colleges that teach Yiddish.  I keep such a list
at http://www.starkman.com/aviva/yiddish.html.  It is quite incomplete, but
it does have links to the web pages of the Yiddish departments at each
university.

Subject: saphir and khnyok(es)

Saphir -- I have heard it also attributed to sapir)n) the gemstone, not
Shpier - part of the large family of Jewish names connected to the jewelry
industry - a la silver, diamond, burstyn (amber), gold, stein, etc. 

The etymology of khnyok is fascinating. Another usage these days by some
secular israelis is as a pejorative name for the ultra-orthodox, particularly
those who come to israel and do not serve in the army or contribute to the
gross national product.
