Subject: American Yiddish literary depiction of Yiddish-English contact

Hi - 

I posted a query about this some years ago, and got a very helpful response
from Judith Nysenholcz;  I'm taking the liberty of posting it again, since I
can state the query more precisely, and since there are many more subscribers
than there used to be.  A sheynem dank in advance for any suggestions or
ideas. 
        
I'm writing a book on how American literature represents encounters and
differences between one language or dialect and another - I've written a sort
of general manifesto on the subject, plus essays on how James Fenimore Cooper
represents the relations between English and Native American languages, on
how Alfred Mercier (a 19th-century French novelist from Louisiana) represents
the relations between Standard French and Louisiana Creole, and on how a 1882
German play from St. Louis represents the relations between German and
English among German emigrants. 
        
I have in mind to write something about how American Yiddish-language
literature represents the relations between Yiddish and English (as well as
how American English-language literature represents those relations), and I'd
be grateful for any suggestions of Yiddish texts that might be interesting in
this connection.  The ones I already know of are these:  Sholem Ash, "Der
Amerikaner" (a sketch I'm trying to locate the publication for);  Moshe
Nadir, "Mayn ershter depozit";  and a fair amount of Sholem Aleykhem,
including "Mister Grin hot a dzshob," "A mayse mit a grinhorn," _Motl Peysi
dem Khazns_, and the play "Mister Boym in klozet."  I've also read Kenneth
Wishnia's very interesting article, "'A Different Kind of Hell':  Orality,
Multilingualism, and American Yiddish in the Translation of Sholem Aleichem's
Mister Boym in Klozet," AJS Review XX:2 (1995), and the works of scholarship
he cites there. 
        
So if anything of interesting comes to your mind, I'd be most thankful. 

Zayt mir ale gezunt un shtark, 
Larry Rosenwald

Subject: Search of Mendele archives

I apologize to all those who were inconvenienced by the long interruption in
the Mendele archives search service.

The archives of Mendele are now searchable using new state-of-the-art
Ultraseek 2.0 search engine (http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/mendeles.html).
Ultraseek is an extremely fast engine with advanced natural language
processing capabilities based on Xerox Lexical Technology. Simple and
advanced search interfaces are available with extensive on-line help. 

The queries can be composed in plain language (English or Yiddish), or using
boolean operators, or using multiple options of the Advanced Search
interface.

Mendele volumes 1-7 are currently searchable, vol 8 and vol.1 and 2 of The
Mendele Review have been added to the database and will be indexed in the
near future.

Subject: Shapiro

These names are derived from the German town of Speyer on the Rhine. By 
the way another nearby town is called Heillbron, another well-known 
Jewish name.
Other variants of the name are:Spier, Saphir.

Subject: 1. S(ha)piro; 2. Rumania

1. Ellen Cassedy (08.062): The names S(ha)piro are probably derived from
"Ashpira" the preexisting Latin name of the Rhineland city "Speyer".  Similar
cases: The name Dreyfus from "Treves"  (now Trier), and family names based on
the city name "Vermayze"/"Germayze" (now Worms). 

2. Jane Rothstein (08.062): A classic rendition of the song "Rumeynye" can be
had on a recording of Aaron Lebedov/Lebedef??? Even in the days of Ester
Hamonica and the Starr report, I'm not sure I'd want to teach a class of 6th
graders the lines "Er trit (= Eng. 'treat) zi tsu an ays-krim sode (= 'ice
cream soda'), Un kvetsht es oys tsurik."  Would you?

Subject: Der Rebbe Tut Vunder

Deena H. Mersky asks about words to a song about "Der Rebe tut vunder."  I
happen to have it here in a book of songs for Jewish members of the Armed
Forces.  My mother, who worked at a V.A. hospital, brought it home for me,
and I remember once asking her if she knew the song, and she sang it.  The
title is given as "Nisim V'niflo-os."  The words are as follows

Der Rebe tut vunder hob ich aleyn gezeyen,
Geht arain in vaser un kumt arois a naser
Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy
Nisim v'niflo-os
Oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy, oy
Nisim v'niflo-os.

Der Rebe tut vunder hob ich aleyn gezeyen,
Geht arain in blote, un shmirt zich oys dei kapote.
Oy, oy, oy, ...etc.

Der Rebe tut vunder hob ich aleyn gezeyen,
Geht arain a blinder, macht er ihm tsu gehen.

Der Rebe tut vunder hob ich aleyn gezeyen,
Kumt arain a toiber, macht er ihm tsu seyen.

Hello

I would like to know how could I obtain a list of Colleges in the United
States and if possible international colleges that teach yiddish. 

Thank You

Subject: schmai, lobes

While I do not know the etymology of the word, I do know the meaning (at
least as used by my mother, who spoke a smattering of Yiddish learned on
the streets of London.)  It meant to wander around browsing, as for example
at a mall, or shopping district/department store.  I would be interested in
the etymology, and also of a couple of other words that she and my maternal
grandmother used.  My favorite was

lobes

which meant something close to 'couch potato', and was used in the
following (British) rhyme:

The boy stood on the burning deck
His mother called him a lobes
Because he would not shine his shoes
Or wash his neck on the Shabbos.

(I'm not using the correct romanization here, but the rhyme should make
things clear.)

A sheynem dank.

Geoffrey S. Nathan
