Subject: The akeda in Yiddish literature: a query

I cannot remember which Yiddish writer it was who wrote in his memoirs
of bursting into tears while learning in heder about the akeda. When
the melamed asked him why he was crying when Isaac was spared, he
responded that he was thinking of what would have happened if the angel
had come too late. The rebbe explained that an angel of God could not
come late, but the boy was not consoled. Can anyone help me locate this
anecdote?

Subject: Social class differences in Yiddish

Rick Gildemeister's raises a serious question about social class
differences in Yiddish that may be virtually impossible to answer. I'd
hesitate to transfer our own (American) criteria for determining social
class to a society as remote in time and culture as the Yiddish speaking
world of Eastern Europe. Did learning (i.e. _lernen_), for example,
equal or outweigh economic factors as a criterion of class?  Did the
_nogid_ really want his daughter to marry a _yeshive-bokher_?

The situation is complicated by the suggestion that, after the
Emancipation/Enlightenment? the "upper class" of Jewish society in
Eastern Europe essentially left the Yiddish-speaking community
altogether. What remained would then have covered a much narrower range
of "class" differences.

The social situation surely varied regionally, too.  Galicia was
generally an impoverished area. Some areas were heavily Hasidic, others
not. All these things mattered but I don't know if we can still
correlate them with dialect differences.

The problem is further complicated by a "city-shtetl dichotomy". The
social class situation in Warsaw was infinitely more complex than in the
neighboring _shtetlekh_ but, I'd venture a guess that the language of
the _shtetlekh_ shared features of the "lower class" speech of the
neighboring big city.

As for _sabesdiker losn_, my guess is that the differences in its
retention that Rick discovered has several other dimensions than he
suggests: (i) differences among the various parts of Jewish "Lite":
Lithuania proper, Latvia, Belorussia. (ii) _shtetl_-city differences. (i
presume to know how to correlate all of these factors.

The inaccessibility of sociolinguistic data is a serious but unavoidable
shortcoming of Yiddish dialectological studies. We were deprived of the
opportunity of traveling from shtetl to shtetl and interviewing
informants, in situ, that represented the socially distinctive groups
that we might have encountered in each community: different sexes,
different age groups, professions, educational groups, religious
affiliations.

Actually, there may still be a way of retrieving/salvaging some
otherwise inaccessible sociolinguistic data, but it would take a number
of very qualified people to do it. It can only be done in the Hasidic
communities in the US, Israel, (elsewhere?). I'd nominate a few of our
Mendele friends for the job. (They/you know who they are.) I'd even
offer to help.
