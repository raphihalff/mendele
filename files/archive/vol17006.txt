Subject: fayer-yekelte

The term occurs in Howard Jacobson's _Kalooki Nights_ (Jacobson
writes "fire yekelte" but never mind.  I found the term interesting for
several reasons.

First, because fayer-yekelte refers to a woman who tends to the fire in an
orthodox house, in short a shabes-goy(e). Jacobson himself uses shabes-goy
in reference to the golem of Prague.  So why the switch when he writes
about England's Manchester?  Might fayer-yekelte be a (partial) calque on
charwoman?

Second, this is the first time I've run across "yekelte"  Presumably it's
the same as "yekete", itself a word I find only in Mendele's archive
(http://shakti.trincoll.edu/~mendele/vol07/vol07.191) where our late
esteemed Mordkhe Schaechter writes " yekete (genitst in Mizrekh-Galitsye un
efsher in andere mekoymes oykhet) "

Third, where "yeke" in current Yiddish refers to German Jews (that at least
is my experience) the word as used by Jacobson seems to point to an older
and arguably original meaning.  (See Mikhl Herzog's valuable note in
http://shakti.trincoll.edu/~mendele/vol03/vol03.340).

Noyekh Miller


(For those who might have felt mauled on behalf of Yiddish by Michael 
Chabon's recent novel, be assured that Jacobson didn't learn his 
mame-loshn from a phrase book. _Kalooki Nights_ is basically an English 
__Adventures of Augie March_ as written by Moses Herzog.)

Subject: Manischewitz - Yiddish lost

My wife just brought home a box of Manischewitz matsos, which has prompted
this thought:

When I was a child, Manischewitz products came with recipes in Yiddish
printed on the container.  Later, the recipes were dropped, but the side
panel of the Manischewitz box still had information about the company in
Yiddish. Then the Yiddish was replaced by English. Now I see that the
English has been replaced by Hebrew (or, as someone on a Hebrew list
recently put it, MIH [= Modern Israeli Hebrew]). No indication that the box
was intended for export, and the fact that there is also English here leads
me to believe that it isn't.

Even the spelling of the name has been changed, from M.Alef.N.I
Sh.Ayin.V.V.I.Ts(final)  to M.N.I.Sh.B.I.Ts(final), which, like most
non-Hebrew names transcribed into Hebrew, is unpronounceable except to
those who already know the pronunciation.

Am I the only one who misses the Yiddish? I used to love seeing those
Yiddish words.

Subject: shtotty

I am interested in knowing the origins of the word "shtotty," referring to
someone (usually a woman) who dresses very fancy or elegant.  Does it come
from the word "shtot," thus differentiating the fancy "city" dresser from
the country bumpkin or casual, laid-back dresser? Also, when and where did
this word begin to be used? Was it ever used in the old country in some
original Yiddish form or did it originate in the new world in its
anglicized form?  I have heard this word used in the frum, but not
necessarily Yiddish speaking, Orthodox community.

Is it also used in general Jewish (again, not necessarily Yiddish-speaking)
circles?

Subject: dire

Does anyone have a sense of when the term "dire" as in dire-gelt (rent)
came into Yiddish and what its specific meaning was? In Modern Hebrew the
parallel word "dira" refers specifically to an apartment (as opposed to a
free-standing house or "villa"). But I'm wondering whether in Yiddish the
term has any kind of specific linkage to an "apartment" as opposed to a
"house."  The phrase "dira-gelt," which is well-known from the often
recorded song, might mean "money for living [space]" and not necessarily
refer to an apartment. In Modern German, the word Wohnung with a roughly
parallel literal meaning is used for "apartment" and I was wondering if
that might be the origin of the Hebrew usage.

A dank.

Date: 8 July
Subject:  foreskin

Can any one please provide me with the Yiddish word for "foreskin"?  I
believe there is a Hebrew word, but not one in Yiddish.  We have asked
several Yiddish mavens but no one seems to know.

A sheynem dank!

Subject: krasny bilet

Could this be a "red card" -- a severe warning or penalty -- in the
football (soccer) sense?

As always, further context might help.

Subject: Il ballo proibito: storie di ebrei e di tango

I'd like to know if the Italian Furio Biagini 2004 publication Il ballo
proibito: storie di ebrei e di tango (La Casa, Lettere, Firenze) is widely
known among young Yiddish history fans such as many participants here, as
well as if it can be expected that this textbook will be translated in the
near future into English, French or German.

Furio Biagini is a professor in Lecce University in Italy of Judaic
philosophy and contemporary Jewish history, as well as of musicology and
art history.

Subject: -lekh

I would like to know the etymology of the plural suffix "lekh." I guess
that the first two letters stem from the Southern-German "le" diminutive -
is that right? But where does the "kh" come from? Is it maybe some Hebrew
plural form that I do not know of? Or Slavic? Thank you very much in
advance!

Best,
Felicitas Payk
