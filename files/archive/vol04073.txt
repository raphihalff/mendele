Subject: Introduction

My name is Ali (short for Alison) Lemer. I was born and raised in New
York City, and am a recent graduate of Columbia University, where I took
Yiddish for my language requirement (2 years). Yiddish was my father's
*mameloshn*, since his parents came over from Europe, so although I've
forgotten some of it by now, we still converse in Yiddish sometimes.

Because I haven't had a class for two years and my Yiddish is slipping
away, I want to try to get a copy of Weinreich's COLLEGE YIDDISH (I lost
the textbook junior year) and try and get back into it. When I found
another Yiddish mailing list on the Internet, I naturally signed up.
(There was another one I belonged to, but I stopped getting stuff from
them.)

Anyway, sorry I didn't really write any of this in Yiddish, but I don't
have enough confidence in my Yiddish anymore to try and compose a letter
to everyone. Efsher di tsveyte tzeit...

Zayt gezunt!

Subject: Recorded folksongs

It was mentioned here recently that Theo Bikel's recordings of Yiddish
folksongs have been reissued on CD.  I would like to add that I recently
ran across a CD entitled "Yiddish Folksongs" in a music store.  It was
recorded by the Orchestra of the Jewish Theatre, Bucharest, with various
male and female singers (presumably also from that theater).  The disc is
identified as LaserLight 15 185.  It contains 18 numbers, for a total of
44 minutes, and I found it for $5.99 (!).  In my opinion, the recording
and music are quite good.  The songs are, of course, presented in a
theatrical style, rather than Bikel's folksier style.  My Yiddish is not
good enough to understand much of these songs, except for those I am
familiar with already, but that is not the fault of the recording or the
diction of the performers.  (The dialect is a bit unfamiliar to me, but
bears a general resemblance to my family's Ukrainian pronunciation.)

Subject: Yiddish activities in Israel in August

I will be travelling about Israel during the first three weeks of August,
but will hopefully have some free time in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.  Could
someone provide a list of Yiddish language activities and/or
organizations which I could visit during this time.

Subject: Got fun Avrom

To Shames Noyekh: I am grateful for the transcribed text of the version
you have of Got fun Avrom. I have just learned from my local friend, Ada
Nesselroth, that she remembers her grandmother's version as somewhat
different. She was able to dredge up a few phrases. Mikhl Herzog did say
that there are regional versions waiting to be processed for the Yiddish
Atlas.

To Yude Rozof: Thank you for the note about the Sim Shalom prayerbook. I
will try to go to divine worship at the nearby Conservative synagoge this
Sabbath to look it up.

Subject: Kautabag

To S. Shapiro: I cannot find the town or village of Kautbag in any source
at home. You should look it up in a book I mentioned on Mendele not long
ago: Mokotoff, G. & Sack, S.A. (1991). Where once we walked. Teaneck, NJ:
Avotaynu, Inc.

You must go to the back of the book and use the Soundex system to encode
the name, so as to allow for orthographic variants corresponding to a
range of pronunciations.

The price of the book is $69.50; it is well worth it. If you cannot find
it in your local library, try the nearest Jewish Genealogical Society.

Subject: Shlumiel the Shlemiel

Over a  month ago  David Sherman  wrote on  the shlemiel  and shlimazl
discussion:

>Am I missing something here?  shlim+mazl=shlimazl.  "shlim" could be
>German or Yiddish, meaning "bad", but "mazl" is unquestionably Yiddish
>(from Hebrew), not German.  And shlemiel is from the Hebrew shlumi'el
>(ben tsurishadday), one of the Bnai Yisroel tribal princes in the
>Chumash.  How could either of these gone G>Y?

I confirm that in modern Hebrew we use  Shlumi'el for a  shlemiel, the
question is, why was that prince  singled out for this role.  There is a
(tongue  in the cheek?)  explanation for  it.  On Hanukka  one reads
every morning  during Shaharit  (shakhris) a  portion from  the Torah,
some special ones on  the first and last day, and on days two to seven
from Bamidbar  (Numbers) 7, each  day's portion starting with  "on the
second (third etc.) day" resp.  Now  the fifth day is the sacrifice of
our friend Shlumi'el.  By some rules  of our fixed calendar, the fifth
day can *never*  be on a Shabbat, thus this  shlemiel Shlumi'el misses
the chance to be mentioned on the day when shul is full.

I recently  learned that the late  Habbad Rebbe made a  big tzimmes of
the fact that the  fifth day, because of never being  on Shabbat, is a
day of  special darkness  and thus  on it  the Hanukka  candle becomes
especially  important.  It  seems that  the Rebbe  rejected the  above
mentioned shlemiel explanation. :-)
