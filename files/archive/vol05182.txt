Subject: Hebrew terms in Yiddish

Morrie Feller (5.180) asks about lists of Hebraisms in Yiddish.  Two
readily available collections are

1.  Steven A. Jacobson (a Mendelyaner),  "A guide to the more common
Hebraic words in Yiddish", 3rd ed., 1994.  This book lists alphabetically
according to their traditional spelling about 2000 hebraisms, together
with their phonetic Yiddish respellings (following the YIVO orthography)
and their English glosses.  A second section lists the same expressions
alphabetized by the phonetic respelling, together with the traditional
spelling and the glosses. Available from Steven Jacobson, P.O. Box 82849,
Fairbanks Alaska 99708.

2.  Nakhman Krupin,  "Hantbukh fun hebreizmen in der yidisher shprakh",
1957. This book lists hebraisms and their phonetic respellings (no
English).  There is also a brief section on words having hebraic roots
and non-hebraic prefixes or suffixes (e.g., _shadkhn, shadkhnte,
shadkhenen zikh..._), and finally examples of the use of hebraisms by _di
klasiker_ and others.  Available from the Jewish Book Center of the
Workmen's Circle, 45 East 33 St, New York NY 10016.

My own early Yiddish education gave short shrift to
_loshn-koydesh_-derived lexicon, and I've found both the Jacobson and the
Krupin quite useful in playing catch-up.

Subject: Hebrew terms in Yiddish

Morrie Feller asks for a reference to a book listing Hebrew words used in
Yiddish. The _Verterbichel fun hebrayishe-yidishe verter_, by Yacov Levin
(New York: Cyco Froyen Central, 1958) is one such book.

Subject: Library of Congress romanization of Yiddish

In remarking upon the variant spellings of Shmuel Rozhanski's (Samuel
Rollansky's) name that he has encountered in library catalogs -- Shmuel
Rozshanski and Shemu'el Rozshanski -- Ron Robboy [in 5.181] has stumbled
across two Library of Congress practices that are at variance with
standard ("YIVO") romanization.  The first has to do with the
romanization of the letter combination zayin+shin.  YIVO romanization
transcribes it "zh," while the Library of Congress approaches it from the
standpoint of transliteration (letter-by-letter) and the resulting
romanization is "zsh."

That at least is understandable and on a certain level defensible. But
what is absolutely indefensible is the Library of Congress's insistence
that Yiddish names of Hebrew origin be romanized as if they were modern
Israeli names.  "Shmuel" is a form that has been superseded by
"Shemu'el"; many more examples could be cited, including some egregious
howlers.  The Library of Congress has codified this practice in its
"Hebraica Cataloging" manual, and librarians that produce cataloging in
an online environment are obligated to follow this rule, which was
unsuccessfully contested in 1985 (a year before the publication of
"Hebraica Cataloging") by the Association of Jewish Libraries' Cataloging
Committee.  The same committee, at my request, has submitted a memo to
the Library of Congress, urging that this policy be reconsidered.

Library of Congress romanization practices for other Yiddish words of
Hebrew/Aramaic origin conform more closely to standard practices (with
some variation), e.g., "emes" and not "emet."

If you feel strongly about this issue, you may (if a U.S. resident) write
your Member of Congress -- although I doubt that he or she will be much
exercised by it.

Subject: A vort vegn dorem-afrikanish

I should like to thank Ron Robboy very much for having called attention
[5.181] to the late Shmuel Rozhansky's important volume on
_Dorem-Afrikanish_ in his invaluable Musterverk  series. I am, of course,
intimately familiar with that volume, and fully agree that it makes a
magnificent contribution towards putting South African Yiddish literature
in its proper literary perspective. What I should have made clear, and
actually meant to say, in my tribute to the memory of the late Professor
Liptzin, is that his work on our Yiddish literature was the most
important to date in _English_. Hence I take this opportunity to reply to
Ron Robboy through the open columns of Mendele, rather then privately,
lest, kholile, Mendelyaner should take me for an amerats in regard to my
own country's Yiddish heritage, khas vesholem!

What may be of further interest to Mendelyaner is the fact that the
entire Musterverk series was funded by Joseph Lifshitz through the the
fund he specifically established for this purpose. His name and
sponsorship is acknowledegd throughout the series. The importance of this
fact for us in South Africa is that the late Joseph Lifshitz was a
wealthy South African diamond dealer, passionately devoted to Yiddish
litearture and culture. It is therefore a great source of pride to the
few of us Yiddish scholars left here that South Africa was once a
significant force in both the the production and promotion of Yiddish
culture. Our Yiddish monthly (later quarterly) Yiddish journal _Dorem
Afrike_ ran uninterruptedly from 1948 to 1993, and attracted
contributions from Yiddish writers all over the world. Complete sets of
this journal -- now regrettably very rare -- are much sought after by
libraries in the United States.

My own resaerch in South African Yiddish literature has to date resulted
in two volumes of translations into English, with critical introductions
and notes, published here in South Africa. I regard my work as just
beginning. Hence the importance to me of the work of the late Professor
Liptzin and the late Shmuel Rozhansky, z"l.

I am grateful indeed for the opportunity, offered by Ron Robboy's
thoughtful response, for me to keep South African literature at least on
the fringes on the literary consciousness of the wider world of Yiddish
scholarship.

Subject: Judeo-German vs. Yiddish

Being a subscriber for somewhat over a year, I have not seen a dis-
cussion on Mendele of this subject [cf. 5.178] except for a mention in a
posting of last week. My interest in having this issued aired stems from
both scholarly and professional concerns.  Apropos of the latter, the
Library of Congress does not recognize Judeo-German as an independent
entity but refers from it to Yiddish. Does this mean that Moses
Mendlessohn's famous "Be'ur" is written in Yiddish and not German that
has been transliterated into Hebrew letters? I would like to know if
there are clear lines of demarcation between the two and what are the the
linguistic issues involved.  Would a full-scale discussion of these
issues on Mendele be appreciated by other subscribers?
