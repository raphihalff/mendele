Subject: YIVO: The Name & The Move

Gregg Kinkley asks (MENDELE 4.014), "What does YIVO stand for (not
politically; acronymically)?"  The answer is:

YIdisher Visnshaftlekher institut.  (The alef in "institut" is in this
case read as "O" -- perhaps our founders regarded "YIVO" as more
euphonious than "YIVI" [which in any case could not have been spelled
tsvey-yudn, tsvey-vovn, alef] or "YIV'.")

It would be interesting to learn when the acronym actually came to be
pronounced "YIVO."  Pre-WWII documents and books from the Vilna YIVO are
stamped "tsvey yudn, tsvey vovn, [shtumer] alef."  When the YIVO logo was
adopted in the 1930s -- that circular bit of Polish Yiddish deco that
most MENDELnikes presumably recognize -- it included a komets under the
alef, indicating that the acronym was pronounced "YIVO."  Old-timers put
the stress on the second syllable; in the U.S. the first syllable is
usually stressed.

And speaking of stress, in lieu of a formal press release, I would like
to bring MENDELnikes as up to date as possible, on the status of YIVO's
move.  1048 Fifth Avenue, which has been YIVO's home since 1955, has been
sold to the Serge Sabarsky Foundation, which will renovate and remodel
the building and turn it into a 20th century art gallery.  YIVO is in the
process of buying a much larger building near Union Square, and the
expectation is that we will be joined there by other Jewish research
institutions. Discussions are ongoing with an organization that is
involved in the documentation of Central European Jewry, another
organization that specializes in Judaica Americana, and a small Judaica
museum. Any or all of these could join us (as partners), but it is
premature to broadcast this over the net -- even if the names of the
institutions are not exactly a secret.

Because of the terms of sale and the extensive renovations that will be
necessary for the downtown site, YIVO will be relocating to an interim
site for perhaps as long as two years.  The offices and part of the
library and archival collections will most likely be located on West 57th
Street; most of the collections will however be in a nearby warehouse.
Library and archival services will be somewhat limited during the interim
period, but we will continue to be open to the public.  Classes and
public programs will continue, perhaps on a somewhat expanded scale.

The most immediate detail is that YIVO's Library and Archives will be
closing to the public circa July 1, 1994 and will reopen at the interim
site in the Fall, probably after the High Holy Days. I will keep
MENDELnikes posted regarding precise dates, addresses, and partners.

Subject: Der Nister

Adam Weisberger asked recently about English translations of Der Nister.
You may want to look at:

1) Family Mashber (Mishpokhe Mashber). Trans. Leonard Wolf. New York:
        Summit Books, 1987.

2) I believe that one or two Der Nister short stories may appear in
Irving Howe and Eliezer Greenberg, Treasury of Yiddish Stories.

To Adam Weisberger:

You will find English translations of Der Nister's tales in: _Ashes out
of Hope: Fiction  by Soviet Yiddish Writers_ ed by Irving Howe and
Eliezer Greenberg, NY: Schocken, 1977, which contains the story "Under a
Fence: A Review", but you should warn your students that the main
character is called in English a "scholar" in that translation, while
the original Yiddish word, "nozir", should rather be translaated as
"hermit"

Other stories, (where lots of hermits appear as well) can be found in :
Joachim Neugroschel, ed and trans., Great Works of Jewish Fantasy, also
under a different title: "Yenne velt...", various reeditions.

Last but not least, the story "From my Estates" can be found in _an
Anthology of Modern Yiddish Literature_, Mouton: The Hague, 1974, ed.
Joseph Leftwich.

For an extensive interpretation of the tales, you could have a look at my
book: Delphine Bechtel, _Der Nister's Tales 1907-1929: A Study of a Yiddish
Symbolist_, Bern-Frankfurt-NY-Paris: Peter Lang, 1990.

There is also a translaation of Der Nister's novel _The Family Mashber_
by Leonard Wolf, with an introduction, NY: Summit Books, 1987.

I wish you good luck in teaching this fascinating author

About 5 years ago a translation of his novel THE FAMILY MASHBER came out
to much acclaim.  I am sure that it is still available.

Subject: Pronouncing vav ("and") before bilabials

in hebrew (especially formal style) this pronunciation of vav before all
labials (NB: all labials, not just bi-) indeed obtains, e.g. u-faratsta
"and you will break through" < ve-paratsta.

in modern hebrew, this has begun to be ignored, especially with names: u-
pesahh (or even ve-pesahh) instead of u-fesahh, u-pariz, ve-pariz instead
of u-pariz "and Paris".

i wouldn't expect such a subtlety to transfer to a second language
(yiddish) -- but that's really up to speakers of the language.
similarly, we can say cherubim in english, but cherubs sounds fine too.
