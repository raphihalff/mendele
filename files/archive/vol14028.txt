Subject: Re: zhote

I could be wrong, of course, I haven't heard the song, but my guess would be,
that what Mr. Strom [Mendele 14.026] heard had nothing to do with Malke. It
is, most probably, a Polish (Slovakian/Czech?) version of the name Margaret:
Malgozhata/Malgorzata. Very widespread, for instance, a famous actress
Malgozhata Patotska.

Mazeltov on Yiddish being offered at Brooklyn College. But why did it take so
long? Nevermind. Happy it is happening.

Subject: Dzigan & Szumacher

The comedy team of Dzigan & Szumacher were the Jewish/Yiddish equivalent of
Abbott & Costello.  One of them played the role of the "tam" (simple fellow)
while the other was irascible and impatient with the simplicity of the the
"tam". Do any members know which of these comedians assumed which part.

While I know no story as such, I know the expression - oysgeputst vi yentl
tsum get - a very colorful idiom for "dressed to the nines".

Subject: Re: Etymology of _berye_

[Re: 14.024]

In his _History..._ Max Weinreich cites _berye_ as a loshn-koydesh example of
the development of a short "i" into "e" before "r".  There is a post-biblical
Hebrew word _biryo_ (spelled, like _berye_, beys reysh yud hey) meaning
'creature, human being, man' which could therefore be the source for the
Yiddish word, although the reason for the shift of meaning is not obvious.
There is also a Yiddish phrase _berye-nifloye_, which means "a wonderfully
capable person', and perhaps that helped the transition.  It would be nice if
we knew the chronology.  If volume 5 of the _Groyser verterbukh..._  would
only appear, we might get an answer to the etymological puzzle.

Subject: Re: taytsh khumesh

Regarding Yoyne Freer's post [Mendele 14.027]:

This looks like the well-known Beys-Yehude khumesh (but see my comment
below). My guess is that it first appeared about 150 years ago.

> SHFSI KHOKHMIM, BAL HTURIM, ENINI KHTA ADM VKHU
> all in Rashi Script

Sifsey Khakhomim, Baal Haturim, Inyonei khet odom vekhu'  (= about the
sin of Adam etc). This latter is clearly a one-off, and I could not
find it in my edition.

> font:

> FIRISH LSOROS ELHIM (largest font), SFR HISHR, FRKI DRBI ELIEZR, FRUSH
> E"T, LKUTIM AL HATORAH

Peyrush leToyres Elokim, seyfer hayoshor, pirkey d'rabi Eliezer,
peyrush ivre-taytsh, likutim al hatoyre  (some of these do not appear
in my edition)

That is how they used to be spelt before Yiddish was Germanized.

How about: eliding a- (the indefinite article) with the following word?

Learned men did not really need these translations, but may have used
them for reference. But a kheyder yingl would certainly have needed
them.

> --Finally, what was the purpose of the elaborate Hebraization?

What elaborate Hebraization?  You cannot judge an 18th or 19th century
text by 20th century spelling reforms.  Since the publishers had to set
vowel points for the Hebrew, It wasn't a great deal to set them for
the Yiddish too.

Actually, in my editon the vowel points are often necessary, e.g. khirek
without the yud!

Subject: Re: Non-idealized Yiddish

With all due respect to Lyubov Dukker's mother-in-law, I don't see how her
anecdote supports Ewa Geller's arguments. Dr. Geller argued that the poor
Yiddish she's encountered in American-born students is a result of ideological
bias, whereas Ms. Dukker, in fact, backs up my argument, that it's actually a
matter of circumstance.

Subject: Re: Gender of yortsayt

With regard to Irving Korr's categorical answer [Mendele 14.026]: he's
mistaken. The second element of a compound does as a rule determine the
gender, but "rules are made to be broken" and "yortsayt" is an exception.
Feygl Glazer, who wrote [Mendele 14.025] that only a few Litvakes would use
"der yortsayt" is also mistaken - to the best of my knowledge,
Lithuanian-Belorussian-Ukrainian Yiddish all have "der yortsayt".

Vos iz shayekh Yitskhok Ludens entfer: nisht emes, az "di merste yidishe
publikatsyes shraybn falsh 'der yortsayt'". Af vifl ikh veys iz der klal aza:
in poylishn yidish take "di yortsayt", nor in gants mizrekhdikn
