Subject: Proposal: CENTRE FOR YIDDISH AND TECHNOLOGIC NEWWARE

The following, is a proposal for a project to create a Pedagogical and
Media Resource Centre: Let me know what you think.  If you know of any
potential investors or supporters, let me/them know. A SHAYNEM DANK IN
FOROIS.  (Note: The original Yiddish version is available too. This is
the English translation. However Internet doesn't yet support the Hebrew
alphabet).


        CENTRE FOR YIDDISH AND TECHNOLOGIC NEWWARE
    ___________________________________________________

   Looking to the Future

      New  times  require  new  ways,  methods  and  materials, new
   approaches  and  ideas.   The Centre for YIDDISH and Technologic
   Newware  has  a goal of carrying the Yiddish living language and
   culture into the 21st Century --- right foot first.

      The Centre will serve as a collection and resource institute,
   as   well   as   a   developer,   producer  and  distributer  of
   audio-visual,  film,  music and computer Media for Education and
   Entertainment  purposes.   These will contain suitable assisting
   material and instructions in Yiddish and other languages.

      A  part  of  the work will be carried out in the Centre's own
   studios.   A  part  of  the work will be jointly undertaken with
   specialized individuals, firms and institutions.

      The  most  uptodate  (as  well  as  traditional)  methods and
   materials  will  be utilized and presented --- in Yiddish --- to
   the  Yiddish user and consumer.  Both Young and Old will benefit
   from  the  Centre,  as  well  as  students,  academics, artists,
   musicians,  writers  and  researchers, and every lover of living
   Yiddish in Word  and Sound.

      The  Centre  will  contain  a Library with a reading room, an
   Audio-video  room,  a  Children's section, a computer room and a
   study  area,  as well as a store for serving the general public.
   The  Centre  will  also contain work rooms, class rooms, a small
   Theatre  studio,  a  Sound-studio,  and Audio-Video-, Film-, and
   Computer-labs.

      The employees and co-workers will either be users of Yiddish,
   or  will  become  so  through continuing education and training.
   The  day-to-day  as well as the specialized work will be carried
   out  in the Yiddish language, except for necessary communication
   in  other  languages.  All those employed by the Centre will use
   Yiddish as the living communication medium at work.


   Back to the Roots

      The  work  of  the  Centre is based on that which has already
   been done in the general development of the Yiddish language and
   culture:
   -  Folklore, Folks song, Folks Humour;
   -  The Modern Yiddish Literature;
   -  The Jewish Lifestyle and Traditions of Ashkenazic Jewry.

      As  we  know,  Yiddish  was  spoken  by about 10 million Jews
   around   the   world  in  the  later  1930s.  Yiddish  developed
   naturally,  as  all  languages  do:   A  rich  cultural  life of
   Theatre, Music, Press and Literature.

      In  the  widespread network of Jewish schools and educational
   institutions,  the Yiddish language was used foremost.  Learning
   materials  for  children  and  youth  were printed and taught in
   Yiddish  in  subjects  such  as Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology,
   Mechanics,  Medicine,  Linguistics, Art, Music, Literature, etc.

      Yiddish films were produced, as well as Theatre performances,
   Concerts and even Opera in Yiddish translation.  Conferences and
   seminars  of  professionals  such  as  Doctors or Engineers were
   conducted in Yiddish.


   The end of a dream

      Daily  life for Jews before the Holocaust of World War II was
   not  easy.   However, there grew up a generation of Dreamers and
   Builders,  Revolutionaries, Idealists and Halutzim-Pioneers:
   - Where every working Man and Woman, and every Rabbi and Yeshiva
     student had a prayer on his/her lips for a better world;
   - Where every Woman, every Child was full of hope and dreams for
     a more beautiful tomorrow.

      All this, however, came to a brutal end, when the German-Nazi
   Murder-Machine   took   it   upon   itself   to  carry  out  its
   "SWASTIKA-CRUSADE"  war  against  the Jews, in order to wipe off
   all that was Jew and Jewish from the face of the Earth.

      Six Million Jews were then murdered by the Germans with their
   helpers.   Among  the innocent victims, more than one and a half
   million Jewish children.

      In  the  Ghettos,  in  the  camps,  in  the  forests with the
   Partisans,  the moral and spiritual strength of the Jew overcame
   his  sufferings.   And  he  continued to write and to produce in
   Yiddish, what we now call the "literature of the Holocaust".

      Their last appeal was "REMEMBER".


   The weight of Remembering and Reminding.

      The  Centre  for  YIDDISH  and Technologic Newware takes upon
   itself  the  duty and the heavy weight this entails, of carrying
   out  the  last  appeal  of  the martyrs --- which, for the great
   majority of them, Yiddish was the most integral and natural part
   of  their  lifestyle,  ---  to  remind  and  not forget, and not
   forgive those who forget.

      The work is not easy. Three important tasks face us:

   1) To help preserve that which is still possible to save;

   2) To  help  rebuild  that which was destroyed;

   3) To continue forward in the steps of the builders and dreamers
      by  producing  new  creations  in  and  for Yiddish Language
      and Culture.

      Practically, what is required is a lot of work and effort, an
   earnest approach, and a coordinated budget and work plan.

      Professionals and experts in the fields of Language, Culture,
   Art,    Education,   Theatre,   Entertainment,   Music,   Media,
   Psychology,  and  Technology  will  be  hired with a respectable
   salary.

      The  Centre  will  bring  together  these  professionals with
   skilled Legal, Administrative, Financial, and Business directors
   and  advisors.   They will bring out the best of their knowledge
   and  talents and have at their disposal the best and most modern
   materials  and  tools of the trade. Together, they will continue
   to  draw  the  Golden Thread of Yiddish for the present, and for
   future generations.

      It  remains  for  us  now,  to create the necessary financial
   means for this extremely important project.

I've sent the above to many individuals and institutions

The response has so far been 'moral support' ...
