Subject: Yiddish in the liturgy

First, I found Arn Abramson's observations most interesting. If he says
he's heard "viln" rather than "veln" in France and the UK, I believe
him. Perhaps the Jews I've always hung around around with are the
exception rather than the rule.

Second, Moyshe Taub's paper from the 6th International Congress on
Historical Linguistics was unknown to me (obviously, or I wouldn't have
written what I did) and I am most anxious to get my hands on it. Since
Dr.Taub lives in Israel, I will take the liberty of e-mailing him
directly in the hope that he can tell me where to find it.

Finally, I cannot agree with Les Train that the tkhines in Yiddish --
and this includes "G-t fun Avrom", a prayer, are part of the liturgy by
any definition. The only English dictionary I have at hand (Webster's
Collegiate, zayt moykhl) defines liturgy as, "A rite or body of rites
prescribed for public worship". Every one of the examples cited by
Mr.Train is a private prayer, not recited by a baal t'file, not prayed
aloud as part of any service and not found in siddurim containing only
the basic prayers. In the latter the only instance of Yiddish found is
the one I mentioned. Please excuse me for discussion of an English term:
Mendele, as I understand it, is for the discussion of Yiddish and
Mr.Train certainly did that, whether I agree with him or not.

Subject: Grine verem

Moyshe Taube (6.125) reminds us that parallel to 'mit grine verem',
there is also ' mit grine gal'. Stutshkoff (p. 443, rt. col.) has a
number of additional parallels, among them:

mit grin un gal
mit terkishe verem
mit grine verem un kuperne pisklekh

Subject: Yehoash bible translation

My 1982 edition of Yehoash's Yiddish translation of the Tanakh does
indeed have thirteen pagers of Hebrew commentary in very small print at
the back of the book. I'm grateful to Arn Abramson for having reminded
me to look for it [6.175].  Of course this won't be too useful to Lisa
Tomlinson who was looking for facing pages of Yiddish and English.  It
might be worthwhile for her to call the National Yiddish Book Center's
Book Annex at (800) 783-9272.  They may have a Yiddish/English edition.

Subject: The Weinreich dictionary

A recent announcement on Mendele reported that the Weinreich dictionary
is to be reissued by YIVO.  Students of Yiddish should be cautioned
against three serious defects in Weinreich, despite its many qualities.

1. Numerous well established Yiddish words with a long history of usage
in Yiddish literature, press and parlance are deligitimated by
Weinreich. Dovid Katz's authoritative volume, _Amended Amendments_ --
Issues in Yiddish Stylistics -- Oxford, 1993, lists nearly 400 terms
declared as not kosher by Weinreich.

2. Weinreich arbitrarily introduces new terms to replace the above --
none of them to be found in standard Yiddish texts, as the eight volume
Leksikon Fun Der Nayer Yiddisher Literatur, the multi-volume History of
Jewish Literature by Zinberg, Dubnow, Die Yidishe Entziklopedie and the
approximately two dozen Yiddish periodicals in the the world today
(except for one with the smallest circulation) not to speak of the major
Yiddish poets, novelists, dramatists and essayists. Scholars and
students resorting to these unaccepted artificial aaneologisms face the
risk of not being understood or taken seriously by Yiddish readers.
Weinreich deviates from the universal norms of lexicography of
assembling, reporting and explaining words in print and daily use and
instead, sets out to change the language in accordance with personal
preferences of a few off-the-beaten-track of linguists.

3. It is also not a reliable source for translating numerous terms
grounded in our religious tradition. I collected a few dozen of them in
the course of perusing the dictionary.

The best and most authoritative dictionary is still the
Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary by Alexander Harkavy, but only the
1925 edition, which I have recommended to my students on both sides of
the ocean. YIVO itself recognized this by implication, in issuing a new
(unrevised) edition of Harkavy a few years ago with an introduction by
Dovid Katz of Oxford. By the way, the same applies to the issue of
spelling in all books and authors referred to above, to which should be
added the four volume Great Dictinary of the Yiddish Language which
rejects the YIVO changes in orthography (see editor's introduction in
volume one).

Subject: Slavic influence on Yiddish syntax

In response to Ellen Prince's most recent contribution on this topic
[6,172. 2] and some of her earlier comments, I would just like to remark
that:

1. Her contention that German is a sov language (modified in the main
clause only by a finite-verb-in-second-place proviso) has considerable
elegance as a succinct synchronic description of the more Mandarin forms
of NHG. However, from a diachronic point of view it doesn't stand up to
scutiny, since OHG has very fluid word-order, much of which remains in
MHG. Early NHG (in Luther's Bible, say) has a word-order quite similar
to Yiddish and it is only in comparatively recent literary NHG that the
notorious rules have jelled.

2. Consecutio temporum, though not quite as rigidly applied as in Latin
or the Romance languages, is nevertheless normal at all stages of
German, with the exception of contemporary colloquial usage such as the
example aptly cited by Joachim Neugroschel: "Er sagte mir, dass er krank
ist". The usual state of affairs is well illustrated by Ellen's
interesting "Im Westen nichts Neues" comparison.

3. Unlike Yiddish "zikh", the Polish reflexive prounoun is declined and
has long and short forms. The accusative "siebie" is normally shortened
to "sie,", but in the dative the long "sobie" is the only (written)
form.

As for the wider issue, I incline to the view that the Slav impact on
Yiddish syntax (if often only in a reinforcing role) is more
far-reaching than Ellen believes, but clearly considerable caution is
required, since early and non-standard forms of German often provide
striking parallels with Slav usage.
