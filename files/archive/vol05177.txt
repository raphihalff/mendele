Subject: The antithetical meaning of primal words

In 5.145 Eliayahu Yuni and in 5.148 Shleyme Axelrod discuss the word
"aderabe". Shleyme Axelrod says:

>_A modne vort, "aderabe", mit tsvey kimat-farkerte meynungen_.  Harkavy
>(1898) gives both `all the better' and `on the contrary'; similarly,
>Weinreich (1968) has both `not at all, on the contrary' and `in fact; by
>all means' [also `you are welcome'.  For the intensified
>_aderabe-v'aderabe_, Weinreich has `by all means, with the greatest of
>pleasure'.]  So it appears that both the emphatically affirmative and the
>emphatically negative are kosher glosses for _aderabe_, making both
>Zellig's and Eliyahu's usages correct.  Go figure.

Sigmund Freud, in a paper first published in 1910 ("Uber den Gegensinn der
Urworte"), translated in the Standard Edition of Freud's works as "The
Antithetical Meaning of Primal Words") refers to the phenomenon of the
same word having two opposite meanings ("aderabe" in Yiddish is an
example of this, though not mentioned by Freud). The founder of
psychoanalysis took a particular interest in this matter because of its
similarity to a phenomenon which he claimed occurs in dreams: "Dreams
feel themselves at liberty...to represent any element by its wishful
contrary; so that there is no way of deciding at a first glance whether
any element that admits of a contrary is present in the dream-thoughts as
a positive or as a negative" (Interpretation of Dreams). Freud considered
that the same psychological mechanism is at work both in dreams and in
language (perhaps it's more correct to say that in dreams one object or
event symoblizes its opposite, while in language a symbol, which is a w!
ord, symbolizes two opposite meanings---not quite the same thing, but
pretty close).

I don't know whether he was right about dreams, and in any case, Mendele
isn't the place to discuss that. However Freud does give many examples in
his paper of one word with two more-or-less antithetical meanings and
they are well worth quoting. Freud derived his examples from a pamphlet
of Karl Abel's published in 1884 and bearing the same title as Freud's
paper. He quotes extensively from Abel's pamphlet and acknowledges it as
an important contribution to his theory of dreams ("I did not succeed in
understanding the dream-work's singular tendency to disregard negation
and to employ the same means of representation for expressing contraries
until I happened by chance to read a work by the philologist Karl
Abel...").

Here are some of the examples which Freud quotes:

In Egyptian:

"ken" = strong, weak

In Latin:

"altus" = high, deep

"sacer" = sacred, accursed

"clamare" = to cry, "clam" = softly, secretly

"siccus" = dry, "succus" = juice

In German:

"Boden" = ground, garret (compare in Yiddish boden=ground, boydem=atttic}

In Old Saxon:

"bat" = good, corresponds to the English "bad"

German "kleben" = to stick corresponds to the English word "cleave" in
the sense of to split (perhaps Freud could just have stuck to the English
word "cleave" which means both to stick and to split)

Freud gives quite a few more moderately convincing examples (and also
examples of a similar phenomenon: words in which the phonetic structure
is reversed, the two members of the pair having antithetical
meanings---he sees an analogy between this also and the "dream work").

I cannot think of any further examples in Yiddish but I can in Hebrew:

"adraba" = on the contrary, quite so (our old friend, a Hebrew word which
apparently entered the Hebrew language from Aramaic---it would be
interesting to know if it had two antithetical meanings in Aramaic---and
which gave rise to the Yiddish "aderabe" which seems to have received
both of its antithetical meanings from the antithetical meanings of the
Hebrew word)

"sekhel" = intellect, "ksil" = fool

"khablan" = a terrorist who plants bombs, a police expert who removes
bombs

"sagi nehor" = blind, but in Aramaic, from which language this expression
entered Hebrew, it means literally "enough light" or "full of light" (I
guess that the business of the same word having antithetical meanings
merges imperceptibly into other phenomena such as the consciously
ironical ad hoc use of a word to mean the opposite of what it usually
means; or the conscious use of a word to represent its opposite as a way
of avoiding saying a word with an evil or frightening meaning, "sagi
nehor" may originally have been an example of that).

Apart from English I know some Yiddish and Hebrew, but none of the othe
languages mentioned above. I should like to ask Mendele participants
who_are_language experts:

Does the phenomenon of antithetical meanings really exist? Could it just
be coincidence? Are there other examples in Yiddish? Are there examples
in all languages? And if the phenomenon is real what other explanations
have been suggested apart from the Freudian one?

Subject: Khanike, o khanike

Is there anyone who knows more about "khanike, o khanike" than the very
sparse information I have?  R. Rubin says that the melody is Hasidic and
the lyrics (a little different from the ones I learned) are by M.
Rivesman.  Who was Rivesman?  Where was he from?  When did the song
become popular? I would be very grateful for any information - a sheynem
dank aykh.

Subject: Wartime song from Israel with Yiddish lilt

Mottel Lakin asks about possible Yiddish origins of "Nasser mechakeh
le'Rabin, ay yai yai". I don't know its origins, but maybe this will
help: it's on a record album I have (called Hava Nagila, CBS Records,
1973), sung by Mike Burstein, and attributed as follows:

	H. Hefer   --   Folk  --  D. Krivoshey

I don't know what order the attribution is in (lyrics, music, etc.).
