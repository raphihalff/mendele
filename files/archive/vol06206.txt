Subject: Yiddish with Word for Windows

Microsoft Hebrew Word for Windows has excellent search and replace
capacity. It is an ideal program for creating a Yiddish typesetting
program with an internal conversion dictionary [standard Hebrew/phonetic
Hebrew] and Yiddish spell check.

The purpose of the project, sponsored by the World Jewish Congress, is
to enable Yiddish published in Russia to revert to the standard spelling
of Hebrew from the phonetic spelling which was mandated by the Soviet
authorities about 70 years ago.  To accommodate their readers, standard
Hebrew will be printed first and then followed by the phonetic spelling
in parentheses.  This conversion option is for anyone who would like to
have the phonetic spelling of Hebrew in parentheses immediately
following the standard spelling, or vice versa.

Microsoft said that the development of a Yiddish Extension for Hebrew
Word for Windows is complicated because it failed to designate the
Yiddish characters which are internal in the font as Hebrew letters.  To
create a Yiddish Extension will mean that both Microsoft and Glyph
Systems, Microsoft's sole distributor in the U.S. and Canada for Middle
East Languages, will have to cooperate in  modifying  Hebrew Word for
Windows.  They are both open to looking into doing it.

Since Microsoft and Glyph rely on market forces in deciding the extent
to which they will proceed with developing a product, it is important to
let both Microsoft and Glyph know that there is a large, dedicated
Yiddish constituency.

Demonstrate your support by e-mailing Microsoft and Glyph! In your own
words, urge them to modify Hebrew Word for Windows so that Glyph will be
able to produce a Yiddish Extension so that a project sponsored by the
World Jewish Congress will be able to develop a Yiddish typesetting
program with an internal conversion dictionary and spell check.

If you teach Yiddish, you may also want to include the names of your
students who are interested in signing on to your e-mail message.

We need your help in lobbying Microsoft for Yiddish!

Subject: Yankev/Yoykl

In 6.198 Ruben Frankenstein shraybt vegn di farsheydene diminutivn funem
loshn-koydesh nomen Yankev, un dermont tsvishn zey dem nomen Yoykl.

Ikh hobn keyn mol nisht gehert dem forem Yoykl, akhuts in eyn fal: der
tate mayner heyst take Yoykl. Un er aleyn zogt az afile in poyln hot er
keyn mol nisht bagegnt nokh a mentsh vos heyst Yoykl. Derfar volt mir
geven interesant tsu hern vegn andere mentshn mit dem nomen, un fun
vanen zey shtamen.

In 6.198 Ruben Frankenstein wrote about the various diminutive forms of
the Hebrew name Jacob, and among them he mentioned the form "Yoykl".

I've never heard that form except in one case: it's my father's name.
And he says that even in Poland he never met anyone else with that name.
So I'd be interested in hearing about other people with that name, and
where they came from.

A dank,

Subject: Nartlen zikh

Narty (pl) in Polish are skis. The Yiddish nartlen zikh comes from
Polish.

Subject: Yiddish influence on German underworld language

Ruth Liberman asks [6.205] about the influence of Yiddish on the german
underworld language, called Rotwelsch. It is not very easy to define
exactly when this happened. Research of this idiom is quite neglected. I
believe, mainly in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 18th century this
process must have been concluded. Some of the vocabulary came then into
colloquial German. I doubt very much the maintained etymology of
"Hals-und-Bein-bruch" from "Hatslokhe uwrokhe". Even without such
exaggerations at least 10 percent of the Rotwelsch vocabulary is of
Hebrew origin, but with alterated meaning.

Subject: Valentines Day Yiddish

I have finally gotten the nerve to write to this esteemed group of
scholars. I am but a rank beginner compared to the rest of you but I
need help. I am in a Yiddish class and I  have been asked to come up
with "Yiddish Phrases that pertain to love" for our class next month
which coincides with Valentines Day. I would be very grateful for any
help in this matter.
