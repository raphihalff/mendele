Subject: August 12, 1952

Fourty five years ago, on August 12, 1952 twenty four Soviet Yiddish poets,
writers, and antifascist activists were executed in Moscow prison on Stalin's
order. 

                ... But your darkly murdered tongue,
                silenced by the hangman's noose,
                is no longer heard, though the muse
                again sings in the land. You left
                me your language, lifted with joy. But oh, I am bereft --
                I wear your Yiddish like a drowned man's shirt,
                wearing out the hurt. 

                Chaim Grade, Elegy for the Soviet Yiddish Writers
                                        translated by Cynthia Ozick

Taytsh:

The director of a local theater group putting on a production on the
"Borscht Belt" needs the lyrics in YIDDISH of "Anniversary Song" also
sometimes known as "Anniversary Waltz."  If anyone can help, please let me
know ASAP.  Below are the few lyrics he was able to provide:

Akh, in a nakht
In a gliklekher nakht...

Many thanks!

Subject: Virtual Ashkenaz goes live

(A copy of this message has also been posted to the following newsgroups:
shamash.yiddishnet, alt.music.jewish,soc.culture.jewish)

The Ashkenaz Festival of New Yiddish Culture will take place in Toronto 
starting later this month (Aug. 25th - Sept. 1; http://www.ashkenaz.org).

In the meantime, what is new Yiddish Culture? For that matter, what is old
Yiddish Culture? Even more immediately, who are these musicians and artists
and performers? For these discussions, and anything to do with this new
virtual land of Ashkenaz, Yiddish, or the many strands of Jewish (not just
Ashkenazic Jewish) culture, thought, and literature, you are invited to stop
by a new virtual community,

   Virtual Ashkenaz

and also to experience a different way of online community, using the
Motet web-conferencing software.

The site is most easily accessed at http://www.ashkenaz.org/virtual.html

Mit a hartsikn dank,
Ari Davidow

Subject: concert of Yiddish music

As some one who attended the Cooper-Mlotek-Warshauer Trio concert in
Jerusalem last week, I want to say what a delight the entire evening was.
For most of the audience it was nostalgia - pain for a world lost - and
pleasure in hearing familiar melodies as well as new ones. Chana Mlotek is
wonderful - lovely voice and great presentation, always preceded by a charming 
explanation. Thank you for coming to Jerusalem! and come again soon.

Subject: vider amol as me lebt, and terms of endearment
 
vi me lebt macht an untershaid, as me lebt, lebt (derlebt) men.
vi me bet sach, azoy shloft men. 
 
Terms of endearment?  All translations from the english, plus the diminutive
of any cute and cuddly animal work.  Feigele, ketzele.  But one must beware of
irony, as in ziskeit (sweetness) always used with derogation.
