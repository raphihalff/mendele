I would like to ask if anyone out there knows if there
are any plans to update or expand Weinreich's Modern
English-Yiddish Dictionary.  It seems to me that this
would be an extremely valuable project.

After all this discussion, I'm afraid I still don't
understand what the phrase means, in its various (con-
jectured or otherwise) forms!

Next topic:

How does one say "by accident" (as in, the opposite of
"on purpose")? Weinreich translates "accidental" as
"tsufelik", but that doesn't sound right to me.  We use
"ts'l'hukhes" for "on purpose". (Which leads to another
question: the Hebrew hiph'il form, "to make [someone]
angry", is "le'hakh'is", with a patakh.  How did the
patakh turn into a kometz?  My dialect is adopted
Stashiv (Poland).)

This question (how to say "by accident") isn't theoret-
ical.  Since we use exclusively Yiddish with our kids,
and our oldest two are now aged 7 and 5, the subject
comes up a lot...
