Subject: I.B. Singer story sought
Date: April 17, 2010

I am trying to identify a short story by I.B. Singer that I read some 
years ago.  Here is a brief summary of the plot:

A Holocaust survivor living in New York City receives an invitation to a 
ball for survivors from his shtetl to be held in lower Manhattan. Although 
the weather is cold and it is snowing heavily, he decides at the last 
moment to attend.

He hails a taxi to take him downtown and, then, a few blocks from his 
destination, the  taxi is involved in an accident.  He decides to go the 
rest of the way on foot.

Arriving at the ball, he sees many old friends, some of whom he thought to 
be dead. After a while, he realizes that he too is dead.

This is one of the most chilling ghost stories I have ever read.

Can anyone identify the title and the volume in which it was published?
Naturally, I would "die" to get hold of the original Yiddish text.

Subject: gram shtram

Could this be a reference to the lines "gram, shtram, latutnik," from "I 
am Mani Leyb" (by, of course, Mani Leyb) (cf. Goldsmith's Yiddish 
Literature in America)? I have translated those lines as: Gram, shtram, 
patch-maker", referring to the fact that Mani Leyb was a cobbler.

Subject: gram shtram

In my family it was "gram shtram, makh mir a gramida"; I've never heard 
"letnik".

Subject: demoniac

One of my professors wonders if there is a Yiddish equivalent for the noun 
"demoniac."
Harkavy gives "eyner vos hot in zikh a sheyd." This seems, however, rather 
unimaginative.

Subject: finfer turem, finfer shlos

Just an idea...

I would understand "Finfer-turem, Finfer-shlos" as a reference to Prague's 
Lesser Quarter, which has an coat of arms with five towers.

See the coat of arm here:

Subject: Shakespeare's "The Tempest"

Friends:

I am seeking any information on the Yiddish version of Shakespeare's "The 
Tempest."
Specifically, I want to learn when the first translation into Yiddish was 
published.  Also, I have read that "Di shturem" was one of the final 
productions mounted in Warsaw just prior to war.  Does anyone know if "Di 
shturem" was produced on an earlier occasion in Warsaw and, if so, at 
which theater and when?  How often was it performed in Yiddish?  How 
popular might it have been?  Whatever information you may have, or leads 
to information, would be much appreciated.
With thanks,
Rebecca Joy Fletcher

Subject: Sutskevers a lid

Sheva Tsuker bet dem original tsu der iberzetsung fun Sutskevers a lid:

You say: There is no God. No world creator.
If so, my friend, it seems, the miracle is greater:
He isn't and created all that isn't, all that is,
Light and shade, rainbows of madness, all are his:
