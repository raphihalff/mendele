Subject: Rudnicki

In the Polish-Jewish writer Adolf Rudnicki's book "Teatr zawsze grany,"
he
cites the following and marvels at the Jewish mind: "A mitsve a khazer a
hor
aroystsuraysn." Any ideas about what it might mean?

A sheynem dank foroys.

Subject: Sacco and Vanzetti in Yiddish literature?

Dear friends,

A quick question.  In the _Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse_,
there's
a note prefacing Halpern's poem on Sacco and Vanzetti that says, "many
Yiddish poets and writers wrote commemorative works on this subject."
I'm
aware of Glatshteyn's poem, and of course Halpern's, but would be
grateful
if Mendelistn could point me to other Yiddish works, especially Yiddish
poems.

A dank,
Larry Rosenwald

For the creation of Yiddish-speaking communities it's important for
Yiddish speakers live near each other. We want to make this happen with
financial and informational encouragement for the potential seeds of
such communities. Read on!

1. Yugntruf will award stipends of $2,500 a year to cover the moving
costs of those who would like to live closer to other Yiddish speakers.
Apply now! Yiddish speakers anywhere, of any age, are eligible. The
current deadline is June 1st but with sufficient interest the deadline
will be extended.

2. Yugntruf has also just posted on the Internet the DATABASE OF YIDDISH

APARTMENTS. It works like this: Yiddish-speakers who know of apartments
near them, or just want to live near other Yiddish speakers, AND
Yiddish-speakers who are interested in leaving near other
Yiddish-speakers, log on to and post on our database. They meet each
other, and a Yiddish-speaking community is born, with as few as two
people.

We need YOUR HELP to make this happen! For more information write
dires@yugntruf.org or visit www.yugntruf.org/dires/ .

Thank you!

And you saying to me   When my love drinks me, it is good

And if I do what the world wants,  It is to please you, my wife, my

Subject: Call for Papers (June 1 deadline)

Figures of Memory in Jewish-American Arts and Letters
  From the Early 20th Century to Today
November 8-9, 2002

Papers are solicited which address Memory in its representations and
its place in Jewish-American literature and arts, from the 1930s to
today, in order to expose their strategies of continuity or rupture.
How do artists and writers position themselves as Jewish Americans with
respect to their predecessors?   How has the notion of Memory evolved,
and how is it envisaged now?  While recognizing the plurality and
heterogeneity of diverse systems of representation, should we speak of a

general movement toward decomposing or recomposing Memory?  Perhaps a
metaphoric recomposition, to recall  Cynthia Ozick's observations in her

essay "Metaphor and Memory," which will serve as a starting point for
our reflections.
These are the kinds of questions to be addressed in our conference,
which will subsequently result in the publication of a special issue of
the Cahiers Charles V, in honor of Rachel Ertel, founder of the Centre
d'Etudes Juives Am‚ricaines (Center for Jewish-American Studies), for
her contributions to the fields of Jewish-American and Yiddish studies.

Subject: Dreydl

Khaveyrim,

I have been trying to solve a mystery, to no avail.  Perhaps some of you

can help me.

I am looking to find out who originally wrote the music to the song
known in Yiddish as "Ikh bin a kleyner dreydl" and in English as "I Have

a Little Dreydl" and when they were written.  The melody of the two
songs is the same but the composers are listed as Michl Gelbart for the
Yiddish version and Samuel Goldfarb for the English.  As far as I know,
neither highly esteemed composer would have any reason to claim or
plagarize another's work, yet there they are, same tune, different
composers named.  It doesn't appear to have been an editor's error
either, as Gelbart himself put the song in collections with his name,
and Goldfarb's granddaughter relates the family story that he wrote it
as a young man living in Brooklyn Heights, working at the Kane Street
Synagogue and the Bureau of Jewish Education of New York.

My guess is that it was written in Yiddish first.  The lyrics in the
Yiddish say, "Ikh bin a kleyner dreydl, gemakht bin ikh fun blay",
whereas in English the dreydl is made of clay, which I have never seen
in my life, as opposed to in the Yiddish, lead, which they most
certainly were made of.  Also, Goldfarb's granddaughter claims that the
"traditional" Birkhat Hamazon [quotes and spelling hers] melody was
written by him, which I don't believe to be the case.

The 1926 edition of Goldfarb's The Jewish Songster does not have the
song in question, and one would think it would be included, if it had
been written at that time.  Another source indicates there is an
Argentinian recording of the Yiddish song from 1920, which I have not
seen or heard.  From various informants, I have not been able to place
either song before the early to mid 1940s.

I would like to know if any of you remember hearing either song before
then, when it was and in what context it was heard or learned.  If you
have any song books from between around 1920 through 1945, would you
look through them to see if they are listed with an identifiable date
and let me know?

Finally, if you know of any descendents or relatives of either Gelbart,
Goldfarb, or S.S. Grossman (the lyricist of the English version) please
let me know so I may contact them.

A dank in foroys,

Lori Cahan-Simon

Subject: Origin of Mazl-Bozhits?

Dear Colleagues,

Modliborzyce is a small town near Janow Lubelski in East Poland. Could
you help me explain an origin of the Yiddish name of this town:
Mzl-Bozhic (=Mozl-Bozhits?) used by I. B. Singer in his Der Sotn in
Goray (Jerusalem 1972):

In Narol hoben di bkhurim ongehoybn tsu lernen dem Talmud Irushlmi un
in Mzl-Bozhits hot a gbir tseteylt zeyn parmegn oremeleyt (p. 40).

There are three possible explanation: 1. taboo - Jews try to avoid the
Modli- which means to pray (Yiddish: modlen zih), 2. Volksetymologie,
3. phonetical adaptation of Modli- into Yiddish.

Sincerely,
Henryk Duda
