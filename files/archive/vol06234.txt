Subject: The death of Leo Rosten

I regret to announce the death of Leo Rosten as posted today in an
extensive obituary in the New York Times.  Mentioned with great fervor
was his wonderful "The Joys of Yiddish," a joyous book if there ever
was one.

Subject: Place names

In the discussion of place names, there's been a confusion of two
things: an actual change of name as opposed to the names for the same
place in various languages. Castle Garden was replaced by Ellis
Island,just as Constantinople was replaced by Istanbul in 1452.  But
the city known as Lodzh in Yiddish has always been called Lodz
(pronounced "woodzh") in Polish.  The Yiddish and German names did not
disappear in their respective languages, they were simply not official
terms.  The only time the city's name was actually changed was during
the German occupation in World War II, when the conquerors renamed it
Litzmannstadt (after a German general who had distinguished himself
with the usual atrocities during World War I).  In fact, it was called
Litzmannstadt even in a secret journal kept by German-speaking Jews in
the Nazi ghetto in Lodz.

Similarly, the city known as Lwow in Polish has always been called
LEmberik by Jews:  note that the Yiddish name is tri-syllabic even
though the misleading spelling Lemberg is simply a straight
transcription of the German name Lemberg (not Lemburg!).  The various
names exist simultaneously in various Languages, and as long as you
know what's meant there shouldn't be any problem.  (If you do enjoy
such confusions, try hitching through, say, Belgium:  for every
village you wander into, the Flemish name is totally different from
the French name!)  Problems arise only when you have to translate
geographic names:  presumably in talking about Jewish life in
Czernowitz, it's best to use that name (the Czernowitz Conference)
rather than the Romanian term.  It gets tricky when cultures
intersect.  Sacher-Masoch (yep, the Austrian baron and German-language
writer who gave us the word "masochism") also wrote several volumes of
stories about Jewish life in and around his home town Lemberg/Lemberik/
Lwow/Lviv.  Which form should one use in English when translating his
works?

Further complications arise in English because it tends to use the
(Norman) French forms of geographic names:  e.g., "Milan" for
"Milano", "Moscow" for "MoskvA".

While Yiddish and Ladino use the Hebrew forms for Israeli cities, e.g.
Yerushalayim, the latter has been truncated to Salem in America. just
as well:  or would you rather talk about the witches of Jerusalem?

There are certain Eastern European villages that were founded and
named by Jews--so their Yiddish names should certainly enjoy the
prestige of seniority.  But I'm sure the Polish or Ukrainian
government won't get around to using the Yiddish names all that soon.

Finally, there's the contrast between the local Yiddish name and the
standard Yiddish name:  Bohemia is called "Beymen" in standard Yiddish
(from German "Boehmen"), but the local Jews there called it "Peymen."
The same holds true for the German city of Munich: English uses the
French form, standard German uses Muenchen (from the Latin word for
"monks"), but the Munich dialect uses "Minge"--and Italians call it
Monaco, or more precisely "Monaco di Germania" to distinguish it from
Grace Kelly's principality.

In various Slavic cities such as Lwow or Lodz, it's not the name
that's changed--it's the dominant culture.  The official name is
determined by whichever language group happens to be in charge.  The
various names have usually existed as long as the various languages in
those places.

Yiddish often uses some form of the German name for a Slavic place:
e.g. "Varshe" (from German "Warschau" as opposed to Polish "WarszAwa".
So I can understand that a Pole might resent a Yiddish place name,
say, Lemberik, which, to Polish ears, sounds too much like the German
name. If you feel like using the Yiddish form in English, just explain
to an outsider that it's not the German form and that in fact Lemberik
was once as much a Jewish city as a Polish or Ukrainian (Ruthenian) or
even Austrian one.  And if you're talking about Kant, I don't see any
problem in calling his native city Koenigsberg instead of the current
Kalinograd.

Yiddish speakers in Canada refer to their current country as
"KanAde"--but that's because the name was taken over from Polish
"KanAda" long before any Jews arrived in North America.  All I ask is
that if you're using the Jewish name for "Lemberg" please make it
tri-syllabic:  "LEmberik".  (Incidentally, Paul Celan's most famous
poem, "Todesfuge"--Death Fugue--was inspired by a newspaper account
describing the final liquidation of the Nazi Ghetto of Lemberik/
Lemberg/Lwow/Lviv.  Celan himself pronounced it "Lemberg" since he
wrote in German.)

Subject: Some websites for Yiddishists

While the World Wide Web is mostly junk, hoopla and tararam there
_are_ a comparatively small number of useful sites and some of them
are becoming daily more useful.  Others, let us hope, may follow suit.
Here are three.

The Virtual Shtetl, conducted by Iosif Vaisman.  Indispensable.

  http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/

Another is Refoyl Finkel's with among other things his "Yiddish
typewriter and spelling checker" that enables one to type a document
in Romanized Yiddish and to wind up with one in Hebrew characters.
(If I'd used it in transcribing the selection from Chaim Grade, I
could have avoided a few mistakes.)

  http://www.cd.engr.uky.edu/~raphael/yiddish.html

Now from quite a different quarter comes a very rich lode of Yiddish
documents: the Library of Congress, which has made available 77
unpublished Yiddish playscripts (out of a much larger 1200 or so that
were registered) are now available for viewing and downloading.
Amerike!

  http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/vshtml/vsyid.html

Don't expect a new Euripides or Racine.  These are as we used to say
shmates shbshmates, potboilers of no literary value. Most are
hand-written and hard to decipher.  (There's a typewritten one by Boris
Thomashevsky.)  Nevertheless, for anyone with any interest at all in
the New York Yiddish theatre, popular culture or language this is a
gold mine.  And presumably there's a lot more that may yet come our
way.
