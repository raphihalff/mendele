Subject: Eppes unt nit kayn sof!

Pardon my transliteration, I play by ear.  I German friend of mine
tells me that eppes is heard in the Rhineland and can be attributed
to the dialect of Cologne, "Koelsch."  Given the probable origins of
Yiddish, it's not surprising that this word should appear in Western
Germany. As for gonof or "Ganove," I would guess (but only guess)
that it entered German through Yiddish.  The non-Jewish Germans that
knew any Hebrew in earlier centuries tended to be limited to its use
in bible translations, whereas less intellectual German-speakers who
encountered Jews in daily life could have been exposed to Yiddish.
My own experiences in Vienna and the wealth of Yiddish/Hebrew words
in the dialect of that city's working-class seem to be evidence for
this pattern.

A dank!

hi, andrew. are you the andrew cassel that writes for the inquirer
in philadelphia? the one that did that lovely piece on bob and molly
freedman's yiddish record collection? it would make perfect sense if
you were, given your grand- father's legacy of an interest in
yiddish folk music, but i have a different email address for the
inquirer andrew cassel, is why i ask. happy to meet/see you, either
way!

Well, the first thing that came to mind was kafakale, the name of
one of the tortures a sinful soul may be subjected to oyf yener
velt. (Spivak & Bloomgarden explain: "basteyt in dem vos zi [di
neshome] vert arumgeshlaydert fun beyze gayster hin un her.") But I
didn't speak up, because you were looking for a place name ...

Since you asked again, however, I've looked into it, and found that
Weinreich translates kafakale as "limbo, purgatory", so it is a
place name after all. And while I knew it only with an -e on the
end, all the dictionaries allow the pronunciation without that. In
fact, that's the only form Harkavy gives, so that's probably the
real Yiddish pronunciation. And Harkavy translates "geyn in kafakal"
as 'to go to hell'. Does that fit what you've heard it used?

By the way, the spelling is: kof (not kuf), langer fey, dash, hey,
kuf, lamed, ayin. (But Harkavy leaves out the ayin.)

Subject: Noch eppes

I have here beside the keyboard a thin volume of poetry in Mainzer
dialect.  The title is "Ebbes vum Hebbes."  Hebbes is a mythological
character in Mainz am scheenen Rhoi.  "Ebbes" is, of course,
"eppes."

During the 70's, I lived in Grosz-Winternheim, a small town near
Mainz.  Contrary to what I had been told in college, dialect is
alive and well in Germany.  After I finally figured out what the
people were saying, I was struck with the similarities between the
local lingo and Yiddish.

The Rheinland-Pfaelzer even use the word "shikse."  (Please, no
flames.)  Unaware of the political incorrectness, they employ it to
mean "a woman of slightly loose morals."

Helau.
