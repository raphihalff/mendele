Subject: Kasrilevke on the Mississippi

I was wondering if anyone had access to a script of "Kasrilevke on the
Mississippi," a TV dramatization of a fictional meeting between Sholem
Aleichem and Mark Twain. It aired on NBC in 1955 as part of the
"Frontiers of Faith" series. The show is mentioned in YIVO's "Sholem
Aleichem in America." (p. 31) I'm writing my undergraduate thesis on
the phenomenon of the pairing of these two authors and would be
curious to read it.

Thanks in advance,

Etan Cohen

Subject: "Afn Fidl": serial or not?

A sheynem dank for all the answers to my frage.

I may be overstepping myself in my interpretation of "Afn Fidl" as a
serial but for a line from the end of chapter khes: " ...a groyser
umglik vus vert do bashribn inem kapitel tes." ("...a big problem
which will be written about in chapter Tes") which I see as a
anticipatory linking devise popular with serial writers to sustain
interest between chapters. As Louis Fridhandler points out it was
published in the monthly _Der Yidisher Familye_ might it have been
serialized there? (I translated mine from a 1928 Hebrew Publishing
Company pamphlet where it is coupled with _A vigrishne bilyet_.)

Subject: Keseyder immer

With reference to Arre Komar's question [6.263]:

keseyder = 'constantly, consecutively; continually'
imer = 'always' (the use of this dates and types a person; natively, a
	speaker will say _ale mol; shtendik; tomed_)

Incidentally, this information can be found in the "classic" Yiddish
dictionaries:

Uriel Weinreich, _Modern English-Yiddish Yiddish-English Dictionary_
Alexander Harkavy, _Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary_

Subject: Der Amerikaner

I have been trying to get information about a weekly periodical that
my father read in the 1920's--1930's. As I remember it  was a
literary/human interest Yiddish weekly, a sort of Yiddish New Yorker
without cartoons albeit not so cynical nor sophisticated.  I don't
know who published it nor where, but when it was read in our home we
lived in Brooklyn New York and our daily news- paper was Der Morgen
Zhournal.

I remember a short poem written by, A. Vaynper, title "A Mayse mit a
Ku."  The first line was  "Itzkhak Moishe Yosel's, hot a ku gekoyft"
Der Amerikaner had many such wonderful poems and stories that my
father would read to us and teach us.  I would like to be able to pass
them on to our little "mamzerim"

A sheynem dank.

Subject: Farkukn zikh

Here's a shayle that may or may not interest linguists but I hope it
will interest _somebody_.  "Farkukn zikh" is on its face a Germanic
expression.  Harkavy defines "farkukn zikh oyf emetsn" as "to take
after"; and Weinreich says of "farkukn zikh oyf" "to take after (a
model)"; both close enough to the ModG "vergucken sich" to suggest
common roots.

But the _practice_ of farkukn zikh suggests something else.  Young
married women used to (perhaps still do in some places) go out of
their way to stare at a learned rov or talmud khokhem, especially an
adres-ponimdiker, so that their still-unborn sons might inherit
the model's mayles.  Indeed the practice may be traceable to Yankev
Ovinu, the first (Jewish) bio-engineer, who thus improved his flock of
sheep.  Here is Yehoash:

        Hot Yankev zikh genumen faykhte shteklakh fun topol, un
        mandelboym, un platanenboym, un er hot oysgesheylt oyf di
        vayse oyssheylungen, opdekndik dos vayse vos oyf di shteklakh.
        Un er hot arayngeshtelt di shteklakh...in di karetes, in di
        vaserrines vu di shof kumen trinken...Un es iz geven, ven nor
        di shtarke shof hobn zikh geport, azoy flegt Yankev araynton
        di shteklakh far do oygn fun di shof in di karetes, kdey zey
        zoln zikh porn bay di shteklakh..

Now if it is a widely-shared belief among Jews that (concentrated)
looking has a discernable effect on one's offspring then we might
expect to find comparable expressions in other Jewish languages.  Is
that the case? It's also possible that this is a widely-shared belief
among Europeans and that farkukn zikh is simply a Yiddish variant.
What's the evidence?  It goes without saying that Other Possibilities
Exist. Vos zogn aderof di sharfe kep?
