Subject: Pomerantsn

yude rozof was close but no brass ring. accg to skeat's, pomerants is
from pom- arants-, lit.  'apple orange'. pom- is romance, probably
italian, from latin pomus 'apple', of unknown origin. arants- is from
romance (probably from italian) /arants-/, from low latin arangia, from
arabic naranj 'an orange', from persian narang 'an orange'. btw, the
english word _orange_ is from french, with the same origin, as is spanish
_naranja_.

pomegranate is from old french pome grenate, from latin pomum granatum,
lit. 'apple full-of-seeds' (granum 'grain, seed').

more than you ever wanted to know...

Subject: Oranges and pomegranates

I thank all of the Mendelniks who were kind enough to shape my head
correctly on the Yiddish for pomegranate as contrasted with oranges.  But
Shloyme Axelrod added a terrific dimension.  He asked how come there was
any confusion with orange and pomegranate in the first place?   Let me
say why my problem arose though it is likely to show me as having little
in the way of brains.

I speak little Italian but for years I was convinced that the Italian
word for "ladder" was "laddra" based on the fact that Rossini wrote an
overture called "La Gazza Laddra" which I was convinced meant "The Silken
Ladder."  I also knew that he had written an overture called "The
Thieving Magpie" but would never in a million years have thought that
that was what "La Gazza Laddra" meant.  Who would have the chutzpah to
use "Laddra" and mean anything but "Ladder"?  Only years later did I
learn that ladder was "scala" when I was in Milan and tried to get
tickets to the famous opera house "La Scala."

Now, divorce yourself from intimate familiarity with Yiddish and listen
to the word "Pomerantz."  Someone listening to the song to which I
referred (which made reference to "Bekelech vie rote Pomerantzen") would
logically think that pomerantzen had to be "pomegranates" for 2  reasons:

1. pomerantz sounds somewhat like pomegranate (just as laddra sounds
like ladder, though that just shows my brainlessness);

2. an orange is not red and the line "Cheeks like red oranges" would
never have occurred to me.  What is a red orange?  I never saw one.  It
was not until I was older that I heard of a blood orange and years before
I saw one. In my neighborhood in Paterson, NJ, only sissies ate oranges
because you had to be very rich to afford one that was not green.  And
what came up from Florida to New Jersey was neither red nor orange.  Grey
would be a better description.  And sometimes mottled from the mold.

So the translation of that line to my young ears (this was the 1930s) was
"cheeks like red pomegranates."

I thank Shloyme for making me recall what the source of my problem was in
the first place.  But now, should the song be "Bekelech vie rote
Milgroymin"? Nah.  It doesn't work.  How about Bekelech vie rote
wassermelonen?  Can you imagine the gorgeous cousin from the old country
arriving and having cheeks like red watermelons?  Ugh!

Does anyone remember that song: Tsu mir iz gekummen a cousine?

Subject: Pomegranates, rabbis, kreplekh

Pomegranate: malum granatum, no?

Whence "harov"? Isn't it the term of reference "horav"?

kreplekh: H. Davidson is right (see Mordkhe Kosover's "Yidishe maykholim"
in the _Yude Yofe-bukh_, pp. 70ff.), the word is of Romance
origin--earliest references are, indeed, to krepe"s, analagous to French
crepes. During the 12th-14th centuries, the Germanic types kreplin,
krepl"ix, and the mixed form kreplins predominate. Today's Eastern
Yiddish kreplekh has a variant krepxn, largely in the Northeast and a
companion form krapn, also in the Northeast. Western Yiddish terms are
krepfle, krapfn, krepxen. More than you wanted to know?

Subject: Nokh a mol "Rov" un "Rabay"

It was most interesting to see the responses to my stirring up of a
hornets' nest on "Rov" vs "Rabay". *Obviously* I know that "Rabay" is
somewhat of a pejorative term (Ikh bin a nit-Ortodoksisher yid). Oy.

So, thanks to Elliot Hersch Gertel, Arnie Kuzmack, and Jeremy Stern, for
responding to my "shayle". Perhaps Yude Rozof understood my real question
best. Isn't it about time that we realize that, in the USA, most rabbis
are not Orthodox, and we need a neutral (PC? I hope not) term for all.
I'd prefer "Rov" for everybody, --even Alexander Schindler--and even for
women.

Subject: Rav Ktav

DAVKA software of Chicago distributes Rav Ktav (or whatever it is now
called) and a bunch of other Judaic software for the Mac. They have
Talmud and Tanach, etc on CD-ROM, lots of graphics, etc. Perhaps someone
can give you their phone or address.  I don't have it handy.

Steve Jacobson asked for information on Micro Macro - the last
correspondence I had with them was from 1988 and there were three
addresses on the letterhead. The contact person at the time was a Mr.
Gaby Miro.  Good Luck!
