Subject: Keshenever shkhite

95 years have passed since the infamous Kishinev pogrom ( April 6-7, 1903),
which was an ominous harbinger of the tragic events of this horrible century.
Here follow the lyrics of a folk-song on the topic, transcribed in the
Southern dialect of the venue; the song can be heard on the Orchestre Klezmer
CD "Shpil es nokh a mol" (Arion, Paris, 1992):

Deym ershtn tug Peysekh
Obm idelekh gonts freylekh farbrakht,
Yn deym letstn tug khuge
Ot men Keshenev khurev gemakht.

Keshenev arimgeringlt,
Azoy vi a bonder di fos,
Totes yn momes yn kinder
Zenen gefoln in gos.

Oy, di, Got in iml,
Kik shoyn arup tsi indz,
Batrakht nor deym rash mit deym timl,
Vi di goyim zenen zekh noykem in indz.

The song is also published in Mlotek's "Mir Trogn a Gezang" (NY, 1972).

Subject: Sholom Aleichem's letter to Leo Tolstoy 

This is the contemporary letter, Sholem-Aleichem wrote to Leo Tolstoy, which
may be of interest to the Mendelyaner. The English translation follows the
original Russian text.

Dear Lev Nikolayevich,

Considering how closely you follow all the tendencies and events in the life
of society and peoples, it cannot be conceived, that you passed without due
attention past the crying things, that occurred in the days of the "Blessed"
Christian feast in the city of Kishinev, instigated by evil people like
Krushevan and Co. Having read the newspapers, you could not help but shudder
at the thought, that such outrages as Jew-beatings in Kishinev for 2 days
before the very eyes of the police and local intelligentsia, villainous
rapines of girls before the eyes of their parents, slaughter of the innocents
and similar horrors of the Barbarian age are possible in our time.  Not only
does the present writer have the honor to belong to this ever persecuted,
rightless, disdained, but also great in its own right people; he is also a
modest exponent of its feelings, thoughts, and ideals. In short, I am a
Jewish folk annalist, writing in the Jewish vernacular, called jargon, for
already 20 years (I have extensively written also in the Hebrew language, as
well as in Russian) under the pen-name "Shalem-Aleykhem". I was assigned to
compile a literary collection to the benefit of victims of the Kishinev
pogrom. The best Jewish minds are participating in the collection. In order
to secure success for the collection, I dare to beg you, The Great Writer of
the Russian Land, to give us something, let it even be a letter of
consolatory quality. Woebegone and perplexed eight-million Jewry in Russia is
in need of such a word, maybe more than in anything else. Your letter will I
undertake to translate into the Jewish folk-tongue, of which the knowing
people consider me to be one of the best stylists.

We are expecting your prompt reply, for which the editorial staff thanks you
in advance in the person of the
                            deeply respecting you,
                                                        Solomon Rabinovich.
                                                           Shalem-Aleykhem.

P.S.  Please, don't shrink from reading this little etude of mine in the
"Voskhod", this accompanying, and, if not difficult, tell me your opinion. 

Footnotes: The collection, Hilf, was published in Warsaw in 1903 by the
Folksbildung.  Pavolakiy Krushevan was a local Bessarabian pomeshchik
(landowner) and a publisher of the Black-Hundred (chernosotennoy,
shvartsmeyediker) newspaper "Bessarabets" in Kishinev (now - Chisinau). 

Count Leo Tolstoy did reply promptly and provided three fairy tales for the
collection, ober dus iz a manse far zikh.

Subject: Yiddish voices in "The Voice of America on Kishineff"

"The Voice of America on Kishineff" is the title of a colection of the
sermons, meeting resolutions, editorials from the American press in the
aftermath of the pogrom in Kishinev. The volume was edited by Cyrus Adler and
published by the Jewish Publication Society in 1904. It is a unique document
reflecting what was perhaps the first mass campaign in the US on behalf of
the Russian Jews. Most speakers at the meetings in many major cities
represented Jewish as well as non-Jewish establishment and, naturally, the
talks were delivered in English. One of the very few exceptions was the
address of Rabbi Hirsh Masliansky at the meeting in Faneuil Hall in Boston on
May 17, 1903. A quote from "The Voice of America on Kishineff":

"The Rev. H. Masliansky of New York, the main speaker of the evening,
followed, and addressed the audience in Yiddish. In their native tongue he
eloquently recited to them a tale of horrible cruelties perpetrated upon
helpless women, young girls and children, which brought tears to the eyes of
many of his audience. He told of a mother, outraged and insulted by Russian
soldiers, whose 18-year-old son attempted to interfere, and was killed on the
spot; of fathers and mothers forced to witness the outraging of their
daughters, and the brutal torture of their young children; of young women
tortured and put to death be- fore the eyes of their sweethearts, and
appealed to them to do what they could to relieve the sufferings of these
poor people. 

"What irony!" he exclaimed, in closing. "The Czar, the peacemaker of Europe
and the butcher of his own subjects, turning a whole city into a butcher
shop!  Long live those young revolutionists suffering in Siberia and in
Petropolevska prison. Long live they, and may their cause be ever
strengthened." 

Abraham Cahan participated together with Rabbi Masliansky in the meeting in
Philadelphia on May 3, 1903 in the Kesher Israel Synagogue:

"Abraham Cahan, of New York, was the next speaker. He asked that the Jews
throughout the world unite in protesting against the outrage which had been
committed upon law-abiding and peaceable men, women and children. He spoke of
the great meetings that had been held in New York City during the past few
days, and asked that the Jews of Philadelphia unite with those of New York
and the rest of the country in asking the Government to protest against the
iniquity which had been perpetrated.  He asked that liberal contributions be
made to the National Relief Fund, in order to alleviate, so far as human
sympathy could, the sufferings to which the survivors of the massacre were
subjected. He alluded to the fact that in such calamities there should be no
distinction made between socialist, orthodox or radical.  He, the leader of
the socialists, known as the infidel, the heretic, stands now in an orthodox
synagogue and preaches from the same pulpit with Rev. Masliansky and Rabbi
Levinthal. He also recalled the effect of the riots in the early eighties,
when young students, who were entirely alienated from their faith, returned
to the fold, because of the common sorrow that befell the whole house of
Israel. 

Upon motion of Mr. Cahan, resolutions were adopted, providing, first, for the
organization of a fund for the relief of the destitute families in Kishineff,
and calling upon all Jewish societies, lodges and other organizations to
assist in raising money; second, that an appeal be issued to the civilized
world to join the Jews in protest against the atrocities which had been
committed upon their brethren; and third, that it was the sentiment of the
meeting that the Russian Government, which had permitted these massacres and
outrages to be continued for three days in the large military city of
Kishineff without interference, was held responsible."
