Subject: Camp Nitgedaiget

Further to the recent submissions to Mendele by Harold Orbach and Shaurain
Farber, I have a copy of an English advertisement for this "proletarian" 
camp (it is thus described, together with Camps Kinderland and Camp Unity) 
in 1932. I also have a copy of an advertisement in Yiddish, from the
periodical "Yidishe Kultur" in 1937.The name in Yiddish is spelled
phonetically: nun, yud, tes, gimel, ayin, daled, tsvey yudn, gimel, ayin,
tes. Elsewhere in the ad, tsvey yudn appear in words where they would
certainly be pronounced "ay." I hope this helps answer the question of how
the name is/was pronounced. If it confuses it, so much the better! 
Incidentally, in the ad, the rate to attend the camp "including Organization
and Press Tax" was $16.50 per week.

Subject: parevnik

answer for Meyer Wolf. He asked about PAREVNIK. 

in polish "para" means steam, vapour. I met a lot of polish words in 
yiddish texts and very often wovel was changed. 

1. For my ears from knowing polish and a litle bit of russian sounds like
something what was cooked on vapour. Or something for cooking with/on
vapour. 

2. My mother sais that word sounds familiar for her from visiting someone in
the country when she was a child (POLAND, 50-ies). We discussed the case and
we think it may be a place in oven. 

3. My stepfather and my big athority sais that PAROVNIK this is something (a
pot I suppose) used for cooking potatoes for pigs.

4. I chacked PAROVNIK in polish dictionary. It sais that it's something 
(machine) used in production prosses of giving a color for tissue. 

I'm intrested of results of your research about PAREVNIK.

Subject: "kasa"  

Per Gilad J. Gevaryahu question about the term "kasa" , I would venture a
guess that it is the word "kaseh "  which means treasury; in other words, a
place to store valuables.

Re: Gilad Gevaryahu's question about the meaning of "kasa" [08.074]
 
Among many khsiidm, the term "kase d'rabayni (d'rabeynu)" is used to refer
to a special fund set aside for the rebbe's discretionary use for
charitable/righteous purposes.  Literally, I believe it means 'pocket of our
master', and that "kasa" in Aramaic = "kis" in Hebrew.  ("kis" is often used
to refer to a wallet, or even to money in general;  I believe this is
because in gemure/halukhe, the pockets generally referred to are not part of
a person clothes, but more like money-belts or money-bags.) 

So I would hazard a guess that "kasa" in the context mentioned is being used
(maybe ironically) to refer to a 'fund' of food that is being set aside for
shabbes in a different kind of "food bank."

(I am assuming that "kasa" is speeled kof-samekh-alef;  if not, I'm probably
way off base, unless the writer didn't know of the Aramaic origin/spelling
and used a more conventional Yiddish spelling for a word he learned by ear.)

Subject: kasa

To Gilad J. Gevaryahus query about "kasa", it seems to me obvious that this
a variant of the yiddish "kase" meaning "cashbox, treasury". The etymology
is: German "Kasse" or "Kassa", > Italian "Cassa" > Latin "capsa".

Here in the UK pubs have a similar arrangement which they call a happy hour. 

So how about calling it 'di gite sho'. Just imagine two grannies, sorry,
ying vablekh, telling each other 'lomer gayn esn in di gite sho'.
