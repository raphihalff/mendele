Subject: nokhamol internatsional

Shloyme Axelrod hones in on the syntactic problem with the Yid-
dish Internatsional that has been bothering me for forty years.
The punctuation in my version represents my own solution to the
problem, one, however, that does not completely satisfy me.
Axelrod is surely right in considering that 'muz' is a noun,
although this is a rather anomalous for Yiddish.  But then a
problem remains with the verb 'lebn' which ought to agree with
'ir' (lebt) but instead agrees with 'shklafn'.  This is not
altogether exceptional, given the well known tendency to have a
finite verb agree with the nearest preceding noun rather than the
actual subject.  (I was once told that the text was translated
into Yiddish by Leivick, but I never confirmed this.  If so, he
should have known better.)  If my analysis is correct, then the
translation into English would be something like:

      "Arise all you, who like slaves, live in hunger, [stark]
necessity, and misery."

Subject: Mendele on the mind

Once again, reading Friday's newspapers, I was reminded
that Mendele still lives.  He has now, according to the
paper, moved to a white [Byelorussian?] suburb.  When I
last saw evidence of his activities, he showed that his
literary touch was still intact when he announced - on
separating from his wife - that he still loved her but
would not live with her.

Of course I am talking about the South African Black [I
certainly cannot say African American, can I?] leader,
Nelson M., no relation to our patron.  The Hebrew
mem-nun-dalet-lamed-heh reads Mendele to me, what can I do?
Actually, I understand that the Yiddish flavor of his name
is indicated in Hebrew by a final yod instead of the heh,
but I would likely read that Mandalay, as in song I was
forced to hear in Junior High School [On The Road To ...]
when the disciplinary teacher, an Irish tenor, would give
forth at school assemblies.

Shavu'a tov, all Mendelites, .... and I do not mean
geneticist followers of Austrian monk Gregor.

Subject: translation assistance

My wife and I have a knowledge of Yiddish that draws upon
sixty year old memories of our first language.  Our recent
activities have revolved visiting various physicians for
various ailments.
 
She asked me to ask you for a translation of a word she
thinks is "ubbergechalished" or "ibbergechalished."  "It
explains how in Yiddish how I feel -- but I don't think I'm
translating it accurately."  The general domain has to do
with weakness, exhaustion, fatigue, etc.  But none of these
seem to her as descriptive as "ubbergechalished."
 
Although Naomi is a devout technophobe, she is a devoted
reader of MENDELE in hard copy translation.   Thanks.

Subject: Ketchup

Being out of touch with my computer, and out of the country
for 3 weeks meant, that I had 20 issues of Mendele waiting
in addition to lots of other mail for the past weekend. So,
I would like to recycle a few issues from the past 3 weeks.

(1) gut-morn, gut-yor

If you, unlike Harshav, accept the fact that the Mosaico-
Talmudic religion had an influence on Yiddish, the the
issue may originate with the principle "Hameshiv kofel
hashalom". (Kofel = to double) This has several aspects and
related issues, one entry point to it is Gittin 62b.
Related is the response to Borchu in the liturgy, which
adds leolam vaed; or the zimmun (Invitation to a bench)
Nevarekh */borukh *, where uvetuvo is added. The principle
has implications to conduct with gentiles, see Yoreh Deah
148,10. Somewhere along the line the generic gut-yor will
also show up, first in Hebrew/Aramaic, then in Yiddish. The
entire issue is confusing and mysterious, so i recommend to
consult a competent orthodox rabbi for a full explanation.
Rwerman is correct (1.228) that among our competition
(Ladino speaking Mendelniks) the response to Shabbat shalom
is almost mandatory sh. sh. umevorakh.

(2) shalom alekhem (1.236)

The phrase appears in the Kiddush levono (in Polish:
Chiddush levono). To find out when it got there one would
have to check old manuscripts. If sbd. is inclined to do, i
would like to commission him to check "Siman tov umazal
tov" in the same prayer. Reasons for the reversal are given
in a mysterious book called Taame haminhagim on p. 502,
extremely difficult to figure out.

(3) Priluki (1.233)

This is an easy one, and i was disappointed that fellow
librarians did not jump in to help, especially because it
was the last days of Pesach (remember Red Sea?) There are
three places listed as Priluki, all in the Ukraine, quite
near each other. I do not have financial interest in promo-
ting this source, but it is very useful in locating and
identifying Jewish settlements in Eastern and Central
Europe. Mokotoff, Gary; Sack, Sallyann Amdur: WHERE ONCE WE
WALKED. Teaneck: Avotaynu Inc., 1991.
