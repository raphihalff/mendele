Subject: Greek cognate of potz?

In classical Greek (the only type I can speak of) there is
a well-attested word "posthe" (macron over the last vowel
for eta) which carries the expected meaning, i.e. potz, but
can also refer to the prepuce or (less to the point) a stye
on the eyelid. Posthe does give you a dental, whereas the
more basic form whence it probably comes, peos, doesn't. So
far, maybe, so good, but the semantic bridge from potz to
the buttock cleft of the Turkish word quite eludes me.

It's a common enough name, but it's not in my dictionary.
Just what kind of tree is a Birnbaum?

Subject: es, a-, -et

In a frenzy of file housekeeping I obliterated the original
presentation (including the examples) of Mikhl Herzog's
very interesting "es" query, as well as his more recent
"a"-prefix query.

(1) Regarding the former I was finally able to retrieve
from my (personal not computer) memory two lines of an old
Camp Kinderland song which I knew had something to do with
the "es" question, but eluded me for days:

        ver flit es in nakht arum?
	es flit a moskitele arum, zum, zum, zum.

Now the "es" in line (2) is an unproblematic non-
referential (filler) "es".  But the "es" in line (1) looks
like one of Mikhl's.  In this example it almost seems as
though there was an interrogative transforma- tion without
application of a deletion rule.  A typi- cal pair would
look like this:

        Es shteyt a mentsh in gas.
	Ver shteyt in gas?

i.e., wi th the "es" deleted in the question.  The
particular "es" in the song is thus reminiscent of the
optional retention of the subject in a Yiddish rela- tive
clause:  "Der yid, vos (er) redt mit mayn froy, iz mayn
shvoger."  Any ideas on this?

(2) Regarding the "a"-prefix question, if I remember
correctly, it had to do with such forms as "adurkhgelofn".
I think this is a case of analogy as part of a process that
goes something like this: MHG directional prefix "her"
becomes "a" in Yiddish, as in "arayn" or "aroys", in the
meantime losing its specific directional orientation
(toward the speaker), and becoming instead simply a marker
of direc- tionality.  This is then added to directional
particles either obligatorily as in "avek" ("a" plus MHG
"wec"), or optionally, as in "adurkh", and even redundantly
as in "ahin" and "aher".  I'm pretty sure that this is the
right answer if in fact I remembered the right question.

(3) Here's another question to throw into this inter-
esting pot:

In "Zetst zikh avek un rut zikh opet." where does the
clitic "-et" come from?  I haven't done any serious
looking, but my first thought is that it occurs only on the
separable prefixes "op-(arop-)" and "on-" (pos- sibly also
"oyf-") when they are in fact separated. It strikes me as
less formal or more casual than the standard form, and it's
surely rare in literature.

Subject: es & dos: ellen prince.

dear ellen,

regarding es & dos as fillers and would i understand a
sentence with such exactly as without them,iam not a
linguist.like you know it's not like it was my bag(read
academic discipline).therefore i cannot give you an acdemic
discourse on fillers. but it seems to me it says more about
the speaker than the meaning.

sorry i can't ve more enlightening.

[From Gella Schweid Fishman]

            RICH YIDDISH LITERARY ARCHIVAL COLLECTION
                          NOW ACCESSIBLE
                TO SERIOUS STUDENTS AND RESEARCHERS

A rich archival collection that documents the life and
creative writings of the American-born Yiddish poetess,
Rukhl Fishman, has been organized and is now being made
accessible to serious students and researchers of modern
Yiddish literature.

Rukhl Fishman was a striking figure in post-World War II
Yiddish poetry.  She was the only American-born poet, as
well as the youngest, among the Yiddish writers' group in
Israel called "Yung Yisroel", and was praised as the "young
hope" and "the youngest child of Yiddish verse".  In 1978,
a few years before her untimely death (due to lupus), she
was awarded the prestigious Israeli Manger prize for her
published writings.  She lived in Kibbutz Bet Alpha and
died in 1984 at the age of 49.

The trilingual archival collection (in Yiddish, Hebrew and
English) includes handwritten manuscripts of her published
and unpublished poetry, correspondence (dating back to her
childhood years in Philadelphia), documents, photographs
and taped interviews of collected reminiscences.
