Subject: First ten years

Ten years ago 22 enthusiasts of Yiddish and of the internet (the latter
was hardly referred to by this word at that point) received an email
that read:

| Mendele: Yiddish literature and language
| Contents of Vol. 1 no. 1

| At last Mendele is ready to go public.  We have as of today a total
| of 22 subscribers (list on demand) and a very good roster it is.
| And while we're neither in Czernowitz or Vilna we may be at the start
| of something that none of us might have thought possible 10 years
| ago. Let us hope so.
|
| Noyekh Miller

Rekhtn fus s'iz take geveyn! And not only this. We all should be
thankful for Noyekh's vision and perseverance, for Victor Bers'
tireless work behind the scene, for dedication and support of all the
subscribers. Today, Mendele is in the beginning of its second decade.
Ten years is an extremely long period on the Internet time scale,
especially for an enterprise without a budget and staff, without any
institutional support or any formal organization behind it.  Thousands
of Internet projects, big and small, did not make it past their first,
or second, or fifth anniversary. Mendele did not just survive, it has
grown and matured. Mendele established itself as a respectable
electronic publication, which is listed and cataloged by a number of
major libraries and library consortiums around the world. It serves as
a valuable resource for students and scholars and as a source of
enjoyment for all subscribers.

Mendele's tenth birthday is a convenient occasion to recall its
history, as well as the history of the Yiddish internet in general. The
story below is not complete. I apologize if I missed any important
events or people and would greatly appreciate all additions and
corrections, that will be incorporated into the future versions.

Personal email was the first truly popular application of
computer-mediated communication. In the 1980s, it was complemented by
group communication in the form of mailing lists and Usenet newsgroups.
The first generation of the Internet users, which consisted mostly of
computer professionals and aficionados, scientists and engineers
quickly realized that new media can be quite useful beyond the regular
working hours. The growing Usenet was expanding into various subject
areas, including religion and culture. Before long, there were active
Jewish groups on the Net, including net.religion.jewish, and later,
soc.culture.jewish and soc.genealogy.jewish.

While the messages on Yiddish-related topics started appearing in the
general Jewish Internet media from the mid-80s, the first online public
forum dedicated exclusively to Yiddish was created in October of 1988
by David Sherman from Toronto. A Yiddish mailing list (or mail.yiddish)
was issued in digest form and gradually attracted a relatively diverse
audience. The contributions to the list were written in English or
transliterated Yiddish and covered a fairly broad range of topics,
including reports of Yiddish events, songs, jokes, and news.

By the early 90s, several important developments affected the landscape
of the Net. An increasing number of academics in humanities and social
sciences were becoming email users, which prompted a need for a more
scholarly media. In 1991, Noyekh Miller, a veteran mail.yiddish
subscriber organized a list named after Mendele Moykher Sforim. For
several months, Mendele and mail.yiddish peacefully coexisted, but
eventually most mail.yiddish subscribers switched to Mendele and
mail.yiddish became inactive. For the next ten years Mendele was
steadily growing. It reached 500 subscribers in 1994, 1000 in 1996,
1500 in 1998, and 2000 in 2000.

To provide better channels for the different types of materials,
Mendele created two spin-off publications, The Mendele Review and
Mendele Personal Notes and Announcements. The Mendele Review (TMR) is a
literary supplement to Mendele edited by Leonard Prager. TMR publishes
book reviews, bibliographies, fiction, and literary criticism.
Mendele Personal Notes and Announcements present a different facet of
the Mendele community:  materials of local and regional interest -
festivals, concerts, exhibits, personal classifieds.

Mendele is a truly international community. As of today, we have 2,100
subscribers living on six continents, approximately two thirds of them
in the United States. (The exact numbers are unknown, because it is
difficult to attribute correctly addresses in .com, .net, and .org
domains. The numbers below reflect only the respective country domains
-- .ca, .il, .de, .nl, etc. The actual number of subscribers from some
countries is significantly higher.)

Country domains with less than 5 subscribers include China, Croatia,
Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hong Kong, Iceland,
Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovakia, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey,
and Uruguay.

When Mendele started ten years ago, all but one of the 22 subscribers
were affiliated with the US universities.  Since then their portion in
the list has been steadily declining. Today, only 434 (21%) of all
subscribers have e-mail addresses in the .edu domain (plus several
hundred at foreign universities).  Harvard and New York University
boast the largest teams - 18 Mendelyaner each. They are followed by
Stanford (17), Berkeley (16), U. of Michigan (15).  U. of Chicago, U.
of Maryland, MIT, Ohio State, U. of Pennsylvania, U. of Texas (11
each), UCLA, Columbia, and Yale (10 each). More than 100 other campuses
around the world have fewer than 10 subscribers.  Universities outside
the US with more than 10 subscribers include U. of Toronto and Hebrew
U. (both 13).

One of the problems of Yiddish communication on the Internet from its
early days was the rendering of Yiddish letters. In late 80s and early
90s most Internet users were working on the terminals that supported
only a single character set. The only way to display Yiddish letters on
the non-Hebrew ASCII terminal was to "draw" them using several ASCII
characters for each letter. The first program for converting
transliterated Yiddish text into a "real" Yiddish, "yidtype", was
written by Refoyl Finkel in summer of 1991. This program was designed
to enable communication in Yiddish by e-mail and in principle could
have served this purpose; however, more practical applications for
Yiddish email did not appear until a later time.  "Yidtype" gradually
evolved into "Yidishe Shraybmashinke", a wonderful tool that permits
composing Yiddish text in different formats by entering a
transliteration through the Web interface.

In the late 90s, several programs using proprietary formats supported
Yiddish e-mail, none of them gained wide popularity. Real progress in
Yiddish computer communication is becoming possible only now, with the
advent of Unicode, an international standard for multilingual text
encoding. Mark David and a group of enthusiasts loosely organized
around his mailing list UYIP (Understanding Yiddish Information
Processing) played a great role in ensuring correct and full
representation of Yiddish in the Unicode standard and in convincing
Microsoft to support Yiddish in its browser and e- mail client. Current
versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer and Microsoft Outlook support
Yiddish encoding and are supplied with the fonts that contain most
Yiddish letters and ligatures. These popular programs made possible the
creation of the "real" Yiddish Web pages, including interfaces to the
databases and other applications with interactive features. One of the
examples of such development is the online catalog of the British
Library. British Library is the first major library in the world that
converted the bibliographic records of Yiddish books into Unicode
format, making them available for display in a standard browser.

One of the earliest Yiddish collections on the Net was started by Ari
Davidow in December of 1988 within the framework of the WELL virtual
community. The Yiddish resource databank was created as part of WELL's
online reference library.  Access to the resource was limited to WELL
members only. In May 1991 Noyekh Miller started archiving the
newly-created Mendele mailing list. In addition to Mendele issues, the
archive contained other documents, e.g. Noyekh Miller's own translation
of Jacob Pat's "Shmuesen mit Yiddishe Shrayber".  For several years the
scope and usability of Yiddish archives remained limited.  Only the new
technologies that enabled global navigation of information space
radically changed the situation.

The first serious attempt to collect and classify Yiddish resources was
launched in 1993 by Shtetl, the major Yiddish navigation site and
virtual library of the Internet. Shtetl contains a large list of links
to the Yiddish web sites around the world as well as its own collection
with many thousands documents on Yiddish language, literature, culture,
and history. Shtetl is a popular site - in 2000 it has been visited by
more than 100,000 web surfers and the rate of access is growing. The
dynamics of the monthly access to Shtetl (number of unique visitors and
number of pages served) is shown in this table:

   Visitors  Hits

Jul 1996  1168   10382
Jan 1997  2179   26262
Jul 1997  2009   29128

Conventional media is making inroads into the digital age as well. Der
Yidisher Tam-Tam, published bimonthly in Paris, was the first Yiddish
newspaper on the Internet. Bavebter Yid is a quarterly Yiddish literary
journal . Forverts publishes some of its materials on the web. Forvets
Sho, a weekly radio program on WEVD produced by Boris Sandler is
broadcasted on the internet for more than a year.  Another Yiddish
radio weekly, The Yiddish Voice, has a longer history - it was a
pioneer of the Internet Yiddish radio. At least three other Yiddish
radio programs: from Australia, Canada, and Israel are available to the
listeners worldwide.

Every year brings more good news.  Yiddish education on the Internet is
making first steps:  two projects were launched recently in Florida and
Germany. Onkelos project - the first full text library of Yiddish
classics is acquiring more and more works.  All these resources, old
and new, professional and amateur, multimedia and interactive, make the
Internet, a world wide shtetl of our days, a truly exciting place for
the lovers of Yiddish.
