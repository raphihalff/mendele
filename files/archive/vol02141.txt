i once saw a very cheap fur coat for sale in the flea market
(_marche' aux puces_) in paris. i asked the proprietor (in
french) what kind of fur it was. he replied, with a straight
face, 'peau de schmuck.'

Subject: Help

Howie Aronson: Try Leonard Wolf, in New York City (probably
on Riverside Drive), an old Manger afficionado and
translator.
 
Bob Werman: The two suffixes are not the same; nekstoriKE,
lererKE, shrayberKE but di LeybIKHE, di BerIKHE, etc.

Subject: Word Thou Never Wert

I wonder if it might not be interesting and fun to build a
list of Yiddish words that either don't exist or exist only
in dictionaries without being known to the average speaker.

One such is the word for pedant.  Weinreich gives "pedant"
(a big help, that) or "m'dakdek" and Harkavy even offers
"dikdukey sofrim" (the pedantry of scholars).  But I'm left
with the feeling that af der Idisher gass "dikduk" is
reserved for (Hebrew) grammar and that your Uncle Shoyl and
my Tante Bessie wouldn't have known the words.  Or--and I
guess this is my point--the concept.

Any more kandidaten?

Subject: RE: jewish feminist journal

Dear Internet Friends,

        Greetings!  I'm sending you this internet to tell
you about Bridges, A Journal for Jewish Feminists and Our
Friends, a non-profit print magazine.  Bridges has been
publishing for almost four years and has a subscription
rate of over 1,000.  As stated in our editorial mission, we
have a "...commitment that combines the traditional Jewish
values of justice and repair of the world with insights
honed by the feminist, lesbian and gay movements.  We want
to provide a forum in which Jews, feminists and activists
can exchange ideas and deepen our understanding of the
relationship between our identities and activism."  Bridges
is published twice a year, and has covered a diverse range
of issues, including anti-semitism, class, Yiddish language
works in the origianl and translated into English, the
Middle East, music, spirituality, health care, abuse,
racism, coalition work, the holocaust, Sephardic and
Mizrachi culture, and children.  We also publish a wide
range of formats:  essays, interviews, poetry, fiction,
music, photography, and graphic arts.

         Some of our works of particular interest to our
Yiddish readers include: Under Forty by Muriel Rukeyser,
The Lamp by Irena Klepfisz, Jewish Feminism 1913:  Yente
SerdatzkyUs RConfessionS by Irena Klepfisz and
Vide/Confession by Yente Serdatzky,  Kadya Molodovsky
translated by Kathryn Hellerstein, Abraham Sutzkever
translated by Ruth Whitman, and Dreams of an Insomniac and
A Few Words in the Mother Tongue by Irena Klepfisz,
reviewed by Ellen Stone.  Our next issue is looking
exciting and will include an essay on Sephardic music,
poetry that includes translations from the Yiddish, a
number of short stories, a computer art essay, an essay on
being a Jew by choice, and a review of Cancer in Two
Voices.  WeUd be happy to send you the table of contents to
our past issues (by email or regular post).

        There are ten women on Bridges' core editorial
group.  We range in age from 27 to 62, four of us are
working class and six of us are middle class, we are all
Ashkanazi, we have various religious and secular
affiliations, and we all live in different geographic areas
-- east cost, west coast, the midwest, and the south.

        We are sending you this information through
