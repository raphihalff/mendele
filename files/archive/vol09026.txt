This is the third year that Leonard Prager, the editor of "The Mendele
Review", and his associates have presented us with a feast of stories and
essays, most of them romanized from Yiddish originals.  Beginning with
TMR03.014 the same material will be available in Yiddish. 

But since it be would be even better if _all_ of the TMR were in Yiddish, I
started to do just that.  All of Volume 3 (1999) is done
(http://www2.trincoll.edu/~mendele/tmrtoc03.htm) as well as a third of 1998. 
I hope that in the coming weeks all of the first two years will be ready. 

The Yiddish texts are available in two formats: PDF and Unicode (UTF-8). 
PDF is for readers who use the Adobe Acrobat Reader and Unicode is for those
who use Internet Explorer 5. 

As it is written: the voice is the voice of Jacob, the hands are the hands
of Esau.  There are a lot of mistakes in the Yiddish texts earlier than
TMR03.14.  These mistakes are on my head, not that of the Editor.  And if
you find a mistake, please write to me mailto:nmiller@trincoll.edu.

Subject: Now's the time to learn the Yiddish alef-beys

This is as good a time as any to remind Mendelistn that we're not as tied to
the Latin alphabet as we used to be.  We can send one another Email in real
Yiddish characters with Lingomail, write novels with QText, and read a
growing amount of Yiddish on the Web.  Moreover, though Meshiekh keeps a
steady distance, there will almost certainly be new software in the next
year that will make writing and reading even easier. 

For that reason I would like to urge those Mendelists who don't now use the
Yiddish alef-beys to learn it.  It's not hard and--except for those from the
Hebrew--most Yiddish words are spelled phonetically.  This makes learning
the alphabet particularly easy for those who already know the language. 

Why learn it?  For starters, there are those thousands of Yiddish books that
you haven't yet read.  Not to mention the Yiddish press (The Forverts, for
instance, is better than it ever was and decidedly superior to the
English-language Forward).  But most important, it seems to me, reading
Yiddish in some other alphabet is like eating something particularly
geshmak--say a helzl--that's been made without salt and pepper.  aza tam hot
yidish mit fremde oysies.

Subject: Yiddish Poetry

When I was young, a callow student in the Arbeter Ring Mitlshul, I was
saddened by the fear of some of my ardent wonderful teachers that Yiddish
might not survive. I used to dream of a poet-general (on horseback!) whose
flaming rhymes would lift everyone to a love of words, of Yiddish words, and
a thirst for them. This could only result in the perpetuation of the
language so the mighty poems could be read forever. 

Many years later, on Mendele, I made an email friend, Sarah Traister
Moskovitz, who is an author (Love Despite Hate: Child Survivors of the
Holocaust and Their Adult Lives - Schocken Books 1983 ISBN 0-8052-3801-8) 
and practicing psychotherapist in Pacific Palisades. Her love of Yiddish was
born early and mirrored my youth and upbringing. (Her father was principal
of the Arbeter Ring shule in Philadelphia).

Several years ago she invoked an old muse, and started writing poetry in
Yiddish. It appears she found her ultimate means of expression. Maybe, sans
horseback, she can lead us to the waters that quench thirst. 

 From our Florida Circle of Yiddish Clubs newsletter, I share with you the
original and the translation of one of her new poems:

_Yidish Esn_ fun Sore Treyster Moskovitz

Yidish oyfn tsung tsegeyt zikh
vi a shokoladene tsukerke
mit a geshmakn nus ineveynik.

ikh bays ayn yidish mit di tseyn
un s'kayt zikh laykht un zaftik
vi an epl frish fun boym.

Yidish in moyl makht zat
vi ayngebrotn brust-dekl
mit tsibl, meyern un kartofl.

mayn tante khayele's yidish
mit a varshever aktsent
vos zingt, "Nu, gay shoyn, gay shoyn,
un freg nit mer farvue!"
varemt oys di kishke vi
shtarker tey mit honik, a refue.  

zis vi karshn,
sharf vi khreyn,
mit trern bazaltst
mit seykhl geshmaltst,

ikh rays op a frish shtikl khala
un tink ayn in dem yoykh fun doyres.


Translation:  _Eating Yiddish_ by Sarah Traister Moskovitz

Yiddish on the tongue melts
like a chocolate candy
with a delicious nut inside.

I bite into Yiddish with my teeth
and it chews light and juicy
like an apple fresh from the tree.

Yiddish in my mouth satisfies
like brisket roasted long
with onions, carrots and potatoes.

My Aunt Khayele's Yiddish
with her thick Warsaw accent
that sings, "Go on, go on
and let me be!"
warms the gut like a medicine
of honey in strong tea.

Sweet as cherries
sharp as horseradish
salted with tears
shmaltzed in good sense
a thick powerful soup
with tastes sweet and sour
nurturing life
over one thousand years.

I tear off a fresh piece of khala
and dip into the broth of generations.

Subject: Say It In Yiddish at the NYC Transit or MTA

Michael Chabon just might have to hang his head in shame for last year's
attack upon the usefulness and very existence of _Say It in Yiddish_, and
the Weinreichs would be dancing with glee, as I hold in my hand a Yiddish
brochure from the New York City Transit (complete with an MTA logo!) 
entitled "Servis Meldung: es zenen nishto kayn treyns (sic) ariber di
Vilyamsburg Brik fun shabas, may dem ershtn biz october 1999." 

It continues to explain that "men firt durkh an erenste iber-boy arbet oyf
di 'subvey' vegn vos firn tsu di vilyamsburg brik. di arbet farlangt men zol
opshlisn di M J un Z banen ariber di brik....." 

It goes on for several more columns replete with diagrams and information in
mame-loshn, very much alive and lively! 

Attention: Janet Hadda - Together, we might send thanks to the Hasidim for
this new birth of Yiddish in New York.

Subject: translation of a book and theater festival

I am a playwright and theatre director. Last week in Paris I met Joseph
Schein who has written a book in Yiddish on the Soviet Yiddish actor Mihoels
(He was murdered by Stalin). The book deals with Mihoels' use of theatre to
criticise Stalinism. Does anyone know of a Foundation that would pay for the
book to be translated into English so that it can reach a wider audience? 

I am organising a Jewish Theatre Festival in London and am open to ideas on 
content and any funding possibilities. Feel free to make suggestions!
Also any thoughts on touring my Jewish plays in the US.

Subject: A small Judeo Alsatian lexicon

On the Alsatian Judaism site, Rabbi Daniel Gottlieb has begun to
create his lexicon of Judeo-Alsatian.  The URL is

        http://www.sdv.fr/judaisme

and from there you wend your way through to the "dialect" section.

I hope that all of you will have someone "er hot s'klopfe on s'blosse,"
which is Western Yiddish for blowing the shofar.

Assistant Professorship: Comparative Jewish Literatures (Modern)

The Joseph and Rebecca Meyerhoff Center for Jewish Studies at the
University of Maryland seeks highly qualified candidates for a tenure-track
assistant professorship in Comparative Jewish Literatures (Modern).
Demonstrated scholarly ability, teaching experience, and a commitment to
continued scholarly activity are greatly desired. 

While it is expected that most candidates will have primary expertise in
Hebrew Literature, preference will be given to those whose fields of
research include literature in other Jewish languages (Yiddish and Ladino)
or in literature written by Jews in English or other European languages.
All candidates will be expected to demonstrate their ability to teach
across the entire spectrum of modern Jewish literature.

The Center is a cross-disciplinary program whose members hold primary
appointments in appropriate disciplinary departments of the University. The
Center is currently responsible for a wide-ranging undergraduate program in
Jewish Studies; graduate courses are offered through various departmental
programs throughout the university. The specific departmental home of the
successful candidate will be decided in accordance with that individual's
background and interests.

Only candidates who can offer reasonable assurance that they will have
completed their Ph.D. by September 2000, will be considered. Candidates
should submit a C.V., three letters of recommendation, and a one- or
two-page abstract of their dissertation or current project by November 1,
1999 for best consideration. Send all materials to Professor Bernard D.
Cooperman, Chair Comparative Jewish Literature Search Committee, Joseph
and
Rebecca Meyerhoff Center for Jewish Studies, Woods Hall 0113, University of
Maryland, College Park, MD 20742.
