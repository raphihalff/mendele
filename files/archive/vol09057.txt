[Moderator's note: questions about drinks usually provoke active response in
Mendele. The gogl-mogl's record (17 replies, vol.07.197) has been
successfully challenged by the current slivkes case with the same (perhaps
magic) number of replies and divided opinions. While _slivki_ (small plums)
and _slivki_ (sweat cream) are homonyms in Russian (and some other Slavic
languages), Yiddish _slivkes_ are only the latter.  -i.v.]

Perhaps if you think of heavy whipped sweet cream with the pastries rather 
than IN the tea, it won't seem that strange?

Subject: slivkes

My Russian Dictionary shows 'sliva' to be either a plum or a plum tree.

It further shows: 
sliva-t : to pour off, to decant
sliv-ki: cream
sliv-i: plums

I'm no expert, but it sounds like maybe some sort of plum compote that you
either ate with tea, or even sweetened the tea by pouring a little into the
tea glass. I remember my grandparents doing this with orange marmalade in
the USA. I imagine the range of options in Eastern Europe might have been
more restricted.

It'll be interesting to hear from others.

"Slivkes" surely comes from the Russian "slivki", cream; and the Yiddish is
plural because the Russian word is plural.  (There is no singular.)  As for
why sweet cream in tea, a number of people drink tea that way, and not only
in eastern Europe.

did you consider Polish (with 's acute' - one day e-mail will allow us to
spell things accurately) and Ukrainian "plums"? When my wife and I have tea
in the garden in the summer in our Austrian home, we often have either fresh
or dried plums with tea.

A case of mistaken identity, perhaps?

Perhaps this is a case of broken telephone, and the suspect word "slivkes"  
actually was Sliwowicz (sp? Slivovicz)? You know, that strong, clear
schnapps that appeared on our table for special occasions? To us it was
Newfie Screech with a slavic twist. I always understood that Sliwowicz was
distilled plum vodka that could spike anything -- even (and ESPECIALLY) tea
-- without affecting its color or smell.

Thoughts, anyone?

Dem 11tn Yanuar, 2000 , hot Noyekh Miller gefregt vegn SLIVKES:

Der entfer iz a posheter:"Sliwka", starting with a "s" with an apostrophe
above the S, could be found in every Polish dictionary under SLIWA or SLIWKA
(after the "S" and SZ comes the labial sibilant 'SH').  It is pronounced
"shlivka" , in plural shlivki) and it means in Polish a plum or prune. So
some Jews may have said "a slivke" instead of "a floym", azoy vi di
Amerikaner Yidn "volkn tsu tsu der vinde".

I hope that  I was of some help.

Subject: Slivkes

Slivkes does mean cream (skimmed from milk) - and in Russia it was available
in cartons identical to those for regular milk. It may be used with coffee,
tea, or in any other way in which milk is used. In Russian it is called
"slivki", which is plural (no singular form). So in Yiddish it's called
slivkes by analogy. It isn't sweet - it tastes very close to milk. It means
"smetene" only figuratively - in the expression "slivki obshchestva", i.e.
the cream of society (di some smetene/tsimes fin gezelshaft). Also -
"slivochnoe maslo" - piter fin slivkes, or azkrem fin slivkes/"slivochnoe
morozhennoe" - are common products there.

Since slivovitz is plum brandy perhaps slivkes is plum jam.

Subject: slivkes

Slivki in Russian is cream (many nouns use a plural form in Slavic languages
- here the etymology shows why: s-livat=off-pour of the milk is... the
cream). Polish is shlivki. From here we get slivkes. and I assume the people
were living high of the, lhavdl, hog and could afford cream,not milk,in
their tea.

Noyekh Miller fregt wos iz slivkes mendele 09.052 ("hobn ale gest gehot

in this case ,slivkes means a kind of plum marmelade. The Polish word for it
is Konfitura, In Russia, You drink tea (tey) with plum marmelade (slivkes).

Subject: slivkes

Our distinguished shames emeritus could have pierced to the heart of this
mystery by spending just a bit more time with the Polish dictionary. If one
puts a diacritical on the [s] and then pronounces the word shlivki, the mist
begins to part: you have plums in Polish, which is what I suspect those Jews
were eating, in the form of compote or perhaps preserves.

I thought of the resemblance of slivkes to slivovitz plum brandy. 
I looked up "plum" in the Langenscheidt Polish English dictonary and got 
"sliwka". Could the tea have been used with plum preserves?

Noyeklh Miller asks about the remark "hobn ale gest gehot heysn tey fun
samovar mit di gute slivkes un gebeksn".  He wonders about drinking tea with
cream among Eastern Europe Jews.  Wouldn't the cream be eaten with the
gebeks, not mixed in the tea?
