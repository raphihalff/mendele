Subject: nokh a mol transcription

I would like to enthusiastically second Arn Abramson's point that
our richness of dialects is not a reason not to use a systematic
transcription. If a litvak writes "sheyn" instead of "shoyn", I
don't have any more trouble understanding that than when I hear it
said that way. But if he/she writes "shane" (English-style) or
"schehn" (German-style), I feel like I'm puzzling out a code (and
don't always have the patience).

I hope my friend Moyshe Waldoks won't mind my picking on him as a
recent example: I'm sure I'm not the only one who finds "strieml",
"zveytns", etc. harder to understand than "shtrayml", "tsveytns".

If I try to write in my parents dialect, Lemuushl, az iyekh dertsayl
aakh az baa ints zugt men "kenaynehuure", it may be hard to read for
people who aren't familiar with Galitsiyaner Yiddish, but I think
it's still easier than if I wrote: Limooshle, as eeuch derzale ach
as ba ins soogt mann "kenninehowrie".

(Dos heyst, oyf klal-shprakh: Lemoshl, az ikh dertseyl aykh az bay
undz zogt men "kenaynehuure" onshtot "keyn ayin hore".)

Actually, no ;-)

Most suffixes don't take stress, but the ones that form pejorative
terms for people (men?) generally do: shayderuk', yungatsh',
frumak', all with stress on the last syllable. I think Yudl Mark
points this out in his grammar, but I haven't had a chance to check.
Anyway, grubyan' fits this pattern.

The next question is: where does this pattern come from? The
suffixes all look Slavic: can one of the Slavicists tell us what
their stress characteristics are?

Subject: Lafayette Klezmorim

Melinda Saveleva states that the Lafayette Klezmorim are the only
such group in Indiana.  My list of 120 U.S. Klezmer groups does not
list any other one in Indiana.

32 of the 50 states have Klezmer groups.  CA has by far the most
with 29.  NY is next with 17 and followed by MD with 8.

Any subscriber to DER BAY may receive a copy of this list or one of
Yiddish teachers or Yiddish clubs by merely sending a SASE to:

Subject: Standardized transcription

Bob Goldberg complains about the "standardized" (YIVO) transcription
of Yiddish.But the YIVO transliteration is a one-to-one Latinization
of the Hebrew letters used to write Yiddish. It really doesn't
reflect any dialect, since, e.g., transliterating giml-vov-tes gives
a sequence of letters "gut," which just as giml-vov-tes is
pronounced either /gut/ or /git/. But to -transliterate-
giml-vov-tes as "git" is impossible--giml-yod-tes is /git/. I can't
see any reason to oppose the YIVO transliteration. As for the YIVO
orthoepy--it's wierd. I know of no other language where the only
acceptable stage pronunciation (a Southern Yiddish) is diametrically
opposed to the "literary norm," self-proclaimed by YIVO. As a
Litvak, I'm very happy that YIVO arbitrarily chose basically a
Litvak norm for their "literary norm." And as a teacher of Yiddish
I'm even happier, because, unfortunately, there is -no- way of
arriving at a stage pronunciation (Galitsyaner yidish) from the
orthography.

Subject: bisti

In reading the discussion of how to spell Yiddish I was taken aback
by the spelling of the third "word" of the song that made the hit
parade during WW2, and would like enlightenment.Why is bisti not
spelled as two words, probably bist di. If phonetic judgment says
that either the t or the d must go, then bis di seems just as
reasonable as bist i. But a Yiddish speaker of my close acquaintance
rejects bisti as simply nonsense.
