It worked so far, Noyekh. Thank you. Where is trincc.bitnet? But Mendele is
here. Thank you, Victor Bers, for all your work behind the scene. Thank you
to all Mendele subscribers and contributors. You made this possible. And
useful. Let us hope so.  -Iosif Vaisman]

Subject: p'tsha

Mikhoyel Basherives asked about "gegliverte fis".  Well, I don't recall that
term -- but I do know that I never ever heard _fisnoge_ at home and very
rarely ptsha. (Is it possible they pronounced it /ptshe/? If they used that
word at all, it was with that vowel, I'm almost positve.) Anyway, we really
called it _fisl_ or _fargliverts_. And, yes, it was cold, an aspic (tho I
didn't know that word then), very garlicky and peppery (white pepper, to be
sure), and there were hard-boiled eggs in it -- and other less easily
identifiable objects. And I must confess -- I hated it. Everyone but me
thought it was a delicacy from heaven, tho. ;)

I knew it, in my mothers kitchen, as "farglivertz".  In addition to bits of
meat from the calves feet and much garlic and hard boiled eggs my mother added
a liberal dose of black pepper.

Subject: Cholent

Rita Falbel asks about the origin of "cholent" (tshulnt, in our southern
pronunciation).  As far as I remember if comes from the Rhineland-French
"chaud lent" (slow heat).

From: "Dan Leeson: LEESON@admin.fhda.edu" <leeson@olive.fhda.edu>
Subject: The possible origin of "cholent"

Rita Falbel asks "where does the word 'tcholent' come from and how is it
spelled?" 

There are several sources suggested for the word, but the one that always
struck me as the most rational was from the words "shul ende."  The
relationship is, of course, the fact that the dish would be consumed following
services on Saturday that ended the shabbat.  Thus following "shul ende" one
ate a "shul ende" food which corrupted itself into "cholent."  The spelling is
something that has always evaded me and I am afraid that I can be of little
help in this respect.

Subject: Jack the Ripper

In _Yiddish Culture in Britain_ (1990) I wrote the following, which differs a
bit from Richard Lacey's account (_Mendele_ 7:142).  Perhaps someone could
check on the original wording of the graffito, which I may have miscopied: 

Chaim Bermant wrote, "The East End has been the home of many great men,
saints, sages, scholars, explorers, trade union leaders, statesmen, but the
one name which still lingers in the public mind and is known to every
schoolboy is Jack the Ripper" (_Point of Arrival / A Study of London's East
End_, p. 121).  In October 1987 the _Daily Telegraph_ reported that the
identity of this famous criminal had been established and that he was a Polish
Jew named Kosminski (as reported in _Yediot acharonot_ of 20 October 1987, p.
4).  The revelation was based on the ms. of the memoirs of Sir Robert
Anderson, now in the possession of his nephew, James Swanson.  Anderson
investigated the famous crime in 1888.  Arthur Conan Doyle (= Sherlock Holmes)
treated the theme; films and novels have covered the material -- murder and
mutilation of five East End prostitutes.  Kosminski's guilt has been
contested.  A Yiddish linguistic dimension attaches to the celebrated murder
case owing to a message scrawled on the wall near the scene of the crime: 
"The Juewes shall not be blamed for nothing."  The lettering of the word
_Juewes_ seemed to some people to look like Hebrew.  Bermant cites the letter
from Chief Rabbi Hermann Adler to Sir Charles Warren dealing with this issue: 
"I was deeply pained by the statements that appeared in several papers today,
the 'Standard', 'Daily News', etc., that in the Yiddish dialect the word Jews
is spelled 'Juewes'.  This is not a fact.  The equivalent in the Judao-German
(Yiddish) jargon [sic--L.P.] is 'Yidden' [read _yidn_--L.P.].  I do not know
of any dialect or language in which 'Jews' is spelled 'Juewes' (cited by
Bermant, above, p. 117).  Ref:  Chaim Bermant.  _Point of Arrival / A Study of
London's East End_, London:  Eyre Methuen, 1975, pp. 111-121.

Subject: memories

Since signing on with Mendele, I've been flooded with memories of words and
expressions I learned, mostly over my mother's and father's knees. I list them
below fully aware that they might be way off the mark,  orthographically as
they are what I've been able to dredge up after many years of not hearing
them. I'd be interested in variants based on location (my folks came from
Eishyshok, a shtetl 35 miles from Vilna), and any other aspect of locution
that might turn up. I've always had difficulty in identifying much of their
vocabulary as to whether it was Yiddish, Lithuanian, Polish or Russian. I
think they limited their use of Hebrew to more sacred, less profane matters.
German was the main province of my father from his days in the Czar's Frontier
Army, and then it was  probably 100% cursewords. Thanks.

1. My father called my mother his "panendra" (or "panendreh") which I've
always thought was one of his rare expressions of affection. Which is it?
2. Yenta Dvusha. I know how it was used. What, literally, might the second
word mean?
3. My uncle Max of blessed memory called me his "chishik" which someone once
told me meant "squirrel." 
4. When there was a terrible rain or snow storm, my mother referred to these
as a "khurum" or an "avalitsya." These sound Russian. 
5. The bogeyman we were terrified by was one called "Kondrashe" who would
snare us in our beds and transport us to some sweatshop where we would never
be found again. Was anyone else held in fearful thrall by Mr. K?
6. I know the expression: "Ayn tukhus awf tsvay yuridden" and would be
interested in variants of this sage advice I was regularly accused of
ignoring. Still do!
7. I understand the meaning of "Ikh'l vissen fuhn tsuris" but would like to
know how it turned the corner into irony from what might have been, with
slight alteration, one hell of a good klula.
8. Relatives constantly pinched my chin, commenting about what a cute
"morditchka" I possessed. Sounds Russian. No one ever used a foreign language,
however, to compliment me on my deep dimples.
9. My father played this game with every grandson (eight with nary a girl) and
I'm curious as to whether anyone else recalls it. He would feign spitting into
the open palm of the child and then, with a steadily upward  movement of his
forefinger  on the forearm in the direction of the baby's neck and underarm,
he would recite this doggerel, finishing up with the greatest of deliberation
by poking his finger into the tickle area. The child was helpless to do
anymore than say "more!" It went like this: "Surrokeh, varoneh, kotchkeh,
varilleh, etu medallah, etu medallah, malenka moonishkalla, kootchy-de-
kootchkehleh....."
10.I've been told that when I awoke laughing, I'd soon " lokh mit
yakhtchikes." Anyone?
11. Has Mendele printed any klulas in Yiddish or English? I'll submit them in
the future if appropriate, including the best one I ever heard in English
courtesy of Wallace Markfield in his classic book "To An Early Grave."

Subject: "Bay undz yidn" by Pinkhes Graubard

Khoshever mendelyaner, 

I am presently working on a third book of Yiddish folk sayings (Book 2, More
Words, More Arrows, will shortly be available from Wayne State University
Press.) I would like to access a Yiddish book called, BAY UNDZ YIDN: zamlung
far folklor un filologye by Pinkhes Graubard, published by M. Vanvild, Warsaw,
1923.

I've already made inquiries from the National Yiddish Book Centre but its a
rare book and they don't have it. If anyone can help me locate a copy I would
be most grateful. I'm prepared to purchase it, loan it, photocopy it, whatever
is legal. 

Ikh hof az emetser vet zikh onrufn oyf mayn bakoshe un ikh dank aykh foroys.

From: Olivia Hibel <olivia@ghplus.infi.net>
Subject: Tsvi Kanar

Someone recently suggested that Tszi Kanar's adult, child-in-the-Holocaust
narrator is Sholem Aleichem's Motl transmigrated to 1940.  This is a fruitful
thought.  Having translated both "Motl" and Kanar's "Opgegebn broyt"  (Bread
for Bread)--Olivia Hibel (my wife)  translated sections of "Ikh un lemekh" 
for Tsvi and hopes to complete the book--I find Motl is a cynic and Kanar's
character is not.  Motl is only two shouts away from Holden Caulfield. 

By way of introduction, my name is Rabbi Gershon Freidlin.  Olivia Hibel and I
run Jacob's Dream, a research and consulting firm dealing with Judaica and the
arts.  By way of information, if you've not seen Kanar's mime work, make sure
to catch the act.  Olivia and I took our eldest son, Benjamin, then aged four,
to see Kanar, and at age eight, to see Marcel Mceau.  I cannot say who's
better, but Ben laughed a lot harder at the Kanar performance.

English summary:  You can hear over 150 hours of lightning-fast Yiddish spoken
by native speakers by getting the CD from the above address.  It covers all of
Talmud tractate Shabbos, with pictures of each page and a point-and-click
interface to hear a discussion of each section.  The speaker assumes you
understand how to study Talmud and are familiar with Hebrew and Aramaic.  The
CD also contains in digital format the entire Tanakh and Talmud with Rashi and
standard law codes, all visible with a Hebrew font.  I got my copy from a
bookstore in NY (over the phone! Goldman's Judaica Outlet, 125 Ditmas Avenue,
Brooklyn, NY 11218, 800-972-6201, Judoutlet@aol.com). It cost $18, not
counting shipping and handling.
