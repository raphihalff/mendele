Subject: An e-index (with abstracts) to Jewish Studies Periodicals

I recently sent this note out on the JewStudies List,
but I would like the opinions of those on the Mail-Jewish
and Mendele list as well
--------------------------------
A note to get some opinions, please:
   Several times I have heard of e-mail projects being
 undertaken where reviews of printed journal contents/articles
 in a field are compiled and sent out over Internet, a cross
 between a Reader's Digest idea and a periodical index with
 article abstracts.
   While most of these are done in pure science fields, I think
 that the same could be done in Jewish Studies.
   I would like some comments on whether 'you' would be
 interested in receiving such a journal to keep you up-to-date
 for the discipline.
 Further, I would be interested in knowing what printed
 journals 'you' think would be worth reviewing for such a
 project, and if 'you' would be willing to 'pay' for such a service?
        Thank you for your time.

N.B.  Many of the people who responded to this post,
directed their comments to the fee-for-service element,
HOWEVER, I would like some suggested titles of journals
that should be reviewed by such a service
thanx, AJH

Subject: Korten

Mine uncle used to say, when he wanted another card, "Shlug mir
aince" (or, "nokh a muhl," and this would sometimes end as "und
takeh nokh a muhl"); in poker he would say, "Shlug di tepple."
There was a card he called a "kvetcher," but I don't know which one
it was.  (A deuce, maybe?)  Now these sound like translations of
American idioms, but way back I thought these were rekhtiger
shprakh.

Another playing card term for Seymour Axelrod: "Moishe Pippick" (for
the Ace of Spades).

Subject: di yidishe gas

Just want to call attention to the recent publication in Moscow of a
collection of  Yiddish and Russian stories and poems edited by Aaron
Vergelis and using the usual Heymat phonetic spelling of Hebrew
words. The first story by Tevye Gen is called" naye mitsves" and
relates the trials of a Jewish family emigrating to Israel. Lots of
other good stuff too. Available very inexpensively ($7.00) from the
Workmen's Circle Jewish Book Center, 45 East 33rd Street, NY, NY
10016. Tel.: 1-800-922-2558, Ext. 285.

Subject: various

1) I have been holding back from posting on Mendele until I had time
to read everything in the archive, but since I now have a question
to ask, I might as well jump in the fire.  First, my question: Would
anyone here know of any women's Yiddish literature reading groups?
Someone from Lilith magazine called me to ask if I knew of any
besides the one that meets in Toronto.  I hoped that someone here
might know of others.

2) I enjoyed hearing about the Jerusalem gathering in honor of
Sutzkever. Perhaps someone can tell us about the conference of
Yiddish Clubs that just met in the Washington, D.C. area.   A second
thought would be to have Fishl publish Der Bay on-line here so that
those who would like to attend the activities listed there, wouldn't
get it nokh alemen in snail-mail, as I do.

3) Does anyone know who Philologos in the English Forwards really
is?  I always had the impression that it is really Paul Wexler
writing since Philologos once mentioned in his column that he made
aliya in the late 60's which is what I heard Paul Wexler did.  As we
know from the Pavel Slobodjanskyj scandal two years ago, Wexler
likes to hide behind masks when reviewing (promoting) his own work.

4) On Zak's request for feedback on Paul Wexler's thesis in
Philologos: I remember Mikhl Herzog telling us students in our
History of the Yiddish Language course in Columbia some years ago
that "it is believed" (or something to that effect) that Jews
entered Slavic areas in the first millennium A.D. through the Baltic
areas or perhaps through the Caucasus and that the language these
communities spoke has been named Judeo-Slavonic.  Once larger and
larger migration of Germanic Jewry came eastward after the Bubonic
Plague, the Yiddish of this population began dominating and
Judeo-Slavonic yielded to the Yiddish of these great migrations.  I
have never seen or heard the evidence for this assertion/theory nor
do I remember if its author was ever mentioned, but it seems quite
plausible from what we know of Jewish involvement in slave trading
of Slavs in the first millennium.  There was substantial contact
between Turkic/barbarian art and culture and the Eastern European
and Balkan populations as well as great influence by the various
Turkic tribes who migrated into Eastern Europe from the Russian
steppes.  I have done a lot of research into the folk art of Eastern
Europe and these Turkic tribes, and I see clear and tremendous
influence of Turkic (perhaps also Khazar) and Turkish folk art on
Jewish folk art.  But, to come out and say that Yiddish is a Slavic
language and that the bulk of its first speakers were Slavic
converts is nisht geshtoygn nisht gefloygn. I imagine that Wexler
will probably cite in his book the intriguing presence of Slavic
`bobe', `zeyde', & `tate' in Yiddish kinship terminology as part of
the evidence for his theory, but so what?  What if they are remnants
from Judeo-Slavonic?

      The evidence presented for Wexler's theory in Philologos is
unconvincing, but I'll just pick at one point (cited in Philologos
3) which I know more than something about.  If Jews in Eastern
Europe borrowed the term `treibern' ('traybern') to describe
koshering meat, they were definitely learning it from the world's
experts.  One of the highlights of Turkic tribal culture is the
thorough removal of blood from an animal or human victim and
drinking it as a  symbolic means of conquering its soul.  If Jews
wanted to be medakdek about thoroughly removing blood from an
animal, these were definitely the guys who knew how to do it better
than the Jews.  These various Turkic people (often  called
barbarians), especially the Scythians, Magyars, etc., invaded the
Ukraine, Hungary, Turkey and the Balkans.  After several generations
of mixing with the conquered populations, hobn zey zikh a bisl
oysgementshlt.  It's no accident that the word pogrom arose in the
Ukraine where most of the Scythian descendants now live.  When one
reads in Jewish memoirs of the retsikhe in di oygn of those in the
running onslaught of a pogrom, they are exactly the same
descriptions found in ancient non-Jewish memoirs of attacks by the
fierce marauding Scythians.  Red hair among Jews is attributed to
mixing with the Turkic Khazars or other descendants of these pagans.
But that these marauders are the genesis of Eastern European Jewry,
klept zikh nisht.  Their descendants are the Ukrainians and not the
Jews.  I don't know Mr. Wexler, but this thesis seems like another
attention-getting device.  It just makes me sad, especially after
reading of the enraging Slobodjanskyj scandal in Lingua Franca.
