Subject: Jet-lag af yidish

ikh meyn es volt geven k'day az mir zoln batrakhtn dem fenomenon a
bisele andersh - dzhet klingt in yidish a bisl slavish - iz lomir dos
onnemen vi me nemt on un ba-arbet a slavish vortzl mit yidishe
tzuklepenishn fun ale zaytn.

hert zikh gut tzu:

ikh bin geforn in isroyl afn festival yidish, bin ikh ongekumen a bisl
fardzhetevet. forndik tzurik ahaym bin ikh ongekumen in gantzn
tzedzhetevet. ven ikh vel zikh gut oysdzheteven, vel ikh onheybn mayne
normale flikhtn un arbet.

let's not be so literal and heavy handed. jet (dzhet) has a kind of
slavic sound) so let's see what happens if we approach it from a
slavicized yiddish perspective - it was a very natural process for our
forebears. and yours truly.

i flew to israel for festival yiddish and i arrived a little
fardzhetevet. when i flew back home, i arrived completely tzedzhetevet.
when i will zikh gut oysdzheteven, i will be able to pick up my normal
duties and work.

the consensus among attendees at festival yidish - after one or two
l'khaims, was " it works for me."

if this doesn't make total sense it's probably because "ikh bin nokh a
fardzhetevete."

Subject: Poetry of Yehoash and Zukofsky

Lisa Tomlinson asks [6.169] about editions of Yehoash'es Bible
translation. In addition to the Hebrew-Yiddish bilingual mentioned,
there is a (monolingual) Yiddish edition which should not be hard to
obtain from some used Yiddish  book agency.

As to Louis Zukofsky and Yiddish, I assume the published correspondence
(e.g. with Ezra Pound, not a notable Yiddishist) was no help. Has she
tried his son, Paul Zukofsky with reference to unpublished papers,
correspondence ?

Subject: Mauscheln

About mauscheln, I got one useful reply - from Yitzhak Kertesz [z"l; see
obituary Vol4.273] when I asked about it a couple of years ago. (Kertesz
also expressed reservations as to what Gilman said about mauscheln, in,
I thnink, a discussion of Kafka.) I also asked about analogous
pejorative-'comical' conventionalized 'Jewish Polish', 'Jewish Russian'
and 'Jewish Hungarian', and got no replies about these. Do they exist?
With the advent of Joachim  Neugroschel and the current focus - foci -
of Mendele, I would like to open the subject once more. And how does
Joachim translate examples of, mauschel-ing? (In reply to an earlier
question of JN, my (Litvak) gradmother did use 'blonde' for light and
medium brown hair as well as 'true' blonde.)

Subject: Serdatsky's "Lilien"

It would certainly seem that Serdatsky's Lilien is the famous artist.
Margaret Olin's reference to Aubrey Beardsley [6.187] is quite to the
point.  Lilien, as a graphic artist and book illustrator working in a
European capital, would very likely have known Beardsley's illustrations
to Oscar Wilde's scandalous "Salome," on which Richard Strauss in turn
based his equally scandalous opera of the same name.  A Queen of the
Night, the perplexingly ambiguous figure of The Magic Flute, would seem
a fitting response.  (In this sense, Joachim Neugroschel's speculation
about Lilith [6.187], while almost certainly way off the mark, adds an
intriguing resonance to the Mozart-Schikaneder creation.)

Having said this, however, what if "Lilien" really is someone other than
the famous artist, as Daniel Soyer wonders [6.192]?  What are some
musical candidates?  I have a copy of a mid-19th-century reference work
which lists two sisters, the Baronesses Antoinette and Josephine de
Lilien, amateurs who both published sets of keyboard variations in
Vienna in 1799 and 1800, respectively.  Mozart's Masonic allegory,
premiered in that city in 1791 (and appeared in Paris in 1801).  By the
20th century, the sisters Lilien seem to have dropped out of standard
English-language reference works, but I would guess more could be found
on them in German (or French?) sources. This provides, of course, a
ridiculously remote new course of research, but it certainly is fun
raising these kinds of possibilities.

Another potentially significant musician is Ignace Lilien, a composer
and pianist whose career was spent in the Netherlands, but who was born
in 1894 in Lemberg (Lviv), Galicia.  Ephraim Moses, the artist, was born
twenty years before that in nearby Drogobych.  If the graphic artist had
accomplished musical family, his drawing upon a subject from the world
of opera becomes all the more plausible.  There is, by the way, an
etching by Lilien depicting a view of Drogobych reproduced in the
Encyclopedia Judaica, s.v. Drogobych.

Lastly, as for other works containing Lilien's illustrations, I note
that Zachary Baker coincidentally mentioned one as recently as last
month in his Mendele posting on Der B'rit Chadash [6.154].

Subject: Hebrew borrowings

A tangent: how do we get to "Yankev" from the Hebrew "Ya'akov?"
