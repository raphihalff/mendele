[re: Morrie Feller's post, 5.102]

Morrie Feller's accurate assesment of the paucity of Yiddish for children
is correct. Any critical advancements in this field seem to have ended
before the Second World War. Except at KlezKamp: The Yiddish Folk Arts
Program sponsored by Living Traditions. For the last 11 years KlezKamp
has pioneered age appropriate childhood Yiddish education in areas of
music, language, theater, crafts and movement. Our "KlezKids" program is
second to none in bringing together the finest and most innovative
teachers, performers and adminstrators in this sorely neglected field.
The "Oom Chicks", the successful KlezKamp children's music ensemble (ages
3-7) has been copied at Yiddish events around the world, while our newly
launched "KlezKamp Youth Orchestra" encourages older children (8-16) who
study band or orchestra at school to adapt their school training in the
interest of Yiddish music. The long running "Junior Folklorist" program
devised by Dr. Barbara Kirshenblatt Gimblett trains youngsters at Kamp to
collect oral histories with older European born KlezKamp participants
whose life stories are then adapted by teachers Benny Ferdman, Shari
Davis and Jenny Romaine into  performances by these young sleuths at the
conclusion of Kamp.

This year's KlezKamp "The Wonders of America: A Century of
Yiddish-American Culture" to be held December 24-29  is our 11th and will
continue our commitment to the vitality of our unique Yiddish culture
simultaneously honoring older folksmentshn while training the young in
the precious task of maintaining a much needed continuity.

Detailed information about this year's KlezKamp will appear in a
forthcoming edition of Mendele.

Subject: Children and the future of Yiddish

The only Yiddish I learned as a kid was what my parents used as their
"secret code." When I decided to learn more, to be able to read or listen
the Lubavitcher Rebbe's (may his merit shield us) talks without
translations, it took great effort. I bought a good dictionary and
translated Eliezer Schindler's book of poetry (lovely, religiously
oriented, using a managable vocabulary set).

Yiddish lives in charedi homes where it is the primary spoken language.
Here in Israel, once Hebrew replaces it, the chain is broken.
Yiddish-for-kinder courses are a limited and remedial step. An incentive
(such as cracking parents' secret code) is needed.

B'hatzlacha!!

Subject: Shnirele Perele

Song No. 11 in the Ginsberg-Marek collection (St. Petersburg, 1901)
appears in the following (German-based) transliteration:

Schnirele, Perele, gilderne Fohn,
Moschiach ben-Dowid sitzt eiben on;
Halt er a Becher in rechten Hand,
Macht er a Broche iber die ganze Land.
Omein w'omein dos is wohr,
Moschiach wet kummen haintigen Johr.
Wet er kummen zuraiten,
Welen mir hoben gute Zaiten.
Wet er kummen zufohren,
Welen mir hoben gute Johren.
Wet er kummen zugeihn,
Welen mir alle in Erez-Jissroel ainsteihn.

That version was contributed by "D.G. Galpern" of Vitebsk guberniya. A
variant appears as follows:

Moschiach ben Dowid sitzt eiben on,
In Gold un in Silber ongethon.

Er halt a Becher in die rechte Hand,
Macht er a Broche iber die ganze Land.

Omein w'omein dos is wohr:
Die G'ule wet kummen haintigen Johr.

Wet sie kummen zuraiten,
Welen mir hoben gute Zaiten.

Wet sie kummen zufohren,
Welen mir hoben gute Johren.

Wet sie kummen zugeihn,
Welen die Meissim aufsteihn.

Mir welen kain erez-Jissroel geihn,
Uwo l"Zion Geieil w'neimar omein!

That one was collected by Aaron Leib Pick and Boruch Chaim Cassel (mayn
zeyde, olevhasholem).

For the melody, I'd refer you to the band The Klezmatics, who have a
wonderful version on their second recording, "Rhythm & Jews". That'll
really put it into your head to stay!

Subject: Mock-"Yiddish dialect" pop songs

[response to Joel Rubin; Mendele Vol, 5.080]

As a performer in the Jewish/Yiddish theater in NYC, I have had the good
fortune to come across many songs in the genre that you were talking
about in your submission to Mendele.

As the lead singer of the Don Byron Klezmer Orchestra, I've spent the
last few years traveling around the world singing the music of Mickey
Katz (Heym Ofn Range, The Mekhaye War Chant, etc.)

But recently I've come across some material that took me completely by
surprise.  I found a dusty album at a garage sale, with a Jewish Star on
it.  It said - "The Garden Of Yidn - featuring Eli Basse".  I have since
learned that Eli Basse was a famous comedy writer, who wrote for the
likes of Joe E. Lewis, Red Buttons, Johnny Carson, etc.  He specialized
in original Yinglish songs like - I'm a Litvak, She's a Galitz, The
Oom-Glick Blues, #4 Humentash Lane and many more.  They are very original
numbers and I have included 2 of his numbers in my Off-Broadway show.  I
have several of his songs on my computer and would be happy to share them
with you.  He put out several albums, which I am trying to track down,
also I have met his daughter who lives in the NY area and was shocked and
excited to hear her father's material in my show.

Although some people find these materials insulting and demeaning, I find
them to be extremely entertaining, and a fascinating look at a musical-
sociological phenomenon.  Let me know, if you are interested in the
material that I have and zay gezunt.
