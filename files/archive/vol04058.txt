Subject: Introduction

My name is Robin Charles McKenzie-Boone.  I'm a Systems Analyst and live
(and work) in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada.

My interest in languages has been growing for a few years and recently
made me aware of the contribution Yiddish has made to the vocabulary of
my mother tongue (English).

I have subscribed to the MENDELE list, hoping to learn more about this
interesting language.

My academic background is technical.  However, I managed to squeeze in
two courses in linguistics when I was at university.  I have also read a
couple of books and several articles in the topic.  I consider my
knowledge of linguistics to be very elementary in nature.  And I know
almost nothing about Yiddish!

I don't even know what this means:  "A sheynem dank."

Subject: Re: Gettysburg Address in Yiddish

Well, if you're researching the subject, there's always Emil Cohen's
version from his comedy album.  A couple of examples will suffice to give
the flavour:

"our forefathers"	"unzere fir tates"
"conceived in Liberty"	"zi hot geshvenget in Liberty ... a kleyn
			 shtetale lebn Monticello"

(I'm always reminded of it when driving on Route 17 through Liberty, as
we did last week.)

Subject: Shalet/tshulnt

We're talking a lot on Mendele about tsholent and varieties of
pronunciations. Here's my two bits: we'll start west and move east.

Mayrev Yiddish is commonly associated with areas in Western Europe, and
to an extent also Central Europe (Czech and Hungarian territories). One
variety of Mayrev Yiddish found its way east to the very border of then
Eastern Hungary, an area variously called Carpathoruthenia,
Transcarpathian Area, or Ruthenia, which is now in the Ukraine. The
speakers of this language live in the Oyberland district, and they use
the Western Yiddish term "shalet".

Other migrants to this area came from Poland and the Ukraine and inhabit
the Unterland district, primarily,and they brought with them the Central
and Eastern Yiddish word "tshulnt". If my memory serves me, the Oyberland
people show their disdain for the Unterland people by calling them
"tshulntike yidn" or refer to their language as "tshulntiker loshn", I
can't remember which.

A thought: maybe "solnt" is a compromise between Litvak and Mayrev
Yiddish?

Subject: Yiddish language sports writing

With the World Cup of Soccer in full swing, I've been wondering if
Yiddish has been used to describe soccer games. I'm interested in all
sports, baseball especially, but here, because of its greater
international expanse, would like to find any writings in Yiddish about
soccer. Concomittant with this, while looking in the index of Kyle Rote
Jr.s COMPLETE BOOK OF SOCCER, I see references to a soccer club New York
Hakoah (I've guessed, but could be wrong that this is from the Hebrew for
strength, ha-koakh) winning amateur soccer titles in the USA in the
1950s, as well as the Los Angeles Maccabees winning in the l970s. While
this may not directly touch on Yiddish (I beleive Hakoah originates in
Vienna and must have had numerous Yiddish speaking followers) I would
appreciate any references you have on these and other Jewish soccer clubs
outside of Israel.

Subject: Knibbers

Can it be that nobody at all with the exception of my immediate family
has ever heard the expression "a little weak in the knibbers."?!!!  Where
are all the Brooklynites?  Eyn mol far ale mol, lozt hern khevre!!!

A dank vider amol, ikh'l vayter keyn spodik nisht dreyen vegn "knibbers."

Subject: Yiddish activities in Europe 7/23-8/1 ??

A friend of mine is going to be traveling in Western Europe the last week
of July, and asked me to ask the Mendelnikes about Yiddish activities;
she'd be interested in lectures, leyenkrayzn, shmues-grupes, etc,
particularly in any of the major cities, like London, Paris, Brussels,
Amsterdam, etc. I couldn't find anything in Fishl's International
Schedule, but perhaps there are smaller things that didn't get into the
schedule?

If you know of anything, please send information either to Mendele, or
directly to me. Thanks!

Subject: Family name, roots, etc.

Am not sure exactly to whom I should be addressing these topics, being
new at this, but I'll give it a try, and hope that whoever is
knowledgable in these areas, will be kind enough to reply. Having waited
too long in life to develop a curiosity about my roots, I had given up on
trying to find out. But now that I've joined Mendele, and started reading
some of the mail, it has stirred up my brain again, so here are a few of
the questions I hope someone will be able to answer for me.

My parents both came from the same small shtetl in Russia, and I would
like to know more about what the area was like in the late 1800's and
early 1900s I do not know the exact name and location, but believe the
town was called B'Polia, and that it was a small farmland area.My
Father's name was Kvarten or Kwartin.(His cousin was the well known
Cantor, Zavel Kwarten.) My paternal grandfather would go into the city to
sell produce, and my father used to chant this little ditty:"In B'Polia
gayt min pavolia, in Arrel gayt min shnell.  So, I assume from this that
Arrel was the somewhat larger city near them. My Mothers family was named
Shames. And her mother came from a large family named Beck who also lived
in B'Polia and owned a schenk (tavern).   Does the name Kvarten stand for
anything in Hebrew?

The pronunciation of words, used by my family, was keegal, not kugel and
fa'pitzed, not fapuhtzed.  My grandma mentioned the Yapenazer malchuma.
They said edena and eingalah (dropping the beginning letter y).
Everything diminutive had a lah added. And they ate hochflaysh mitt
cartoflehs. I have a feeling they spoke a small town dialect, such as
buh-naay-en-aahs, not ba- nann-as. And they also tended to bunch their
words together. It took me a while to figure out that feartzah as ve
"endraym" (when being served homemade jam at a kuptzins home meant act as
you would "in der haym."

Does any of the above give someone a clue as to where in Russia they
might have lived? They called themselves, "Rooshishah", and I think their
area would be called the Ukraine," but might be from the border, which
had belonged to Poland, and was returned to Russia. Hence the name
B'Polia? They emigrated to US by way of Riga in 1922.

Hope I have not asked too many questions, all at once. Ashaynem dank tzu
allah, Evalah.

Subject: Various problems and a correction

A number of subscribers have written about 3 missing numbers: .049, .050,
.051.  I have no idea how or why such a thing could have happened but if
you are one of the sufferers, please let me know.

Second, please note that the address for such requests is to me and not
to Mendele.

Third, the gods of the machine have changed my address.  It is now

            nmiller@mail.trincoll.edu  .

I want to thank everyone for cooperating in the matter of signatures and
Subject: lines.  It makes things easier at this end.  I would also like
to ask those who hit the "reply" button in writing to Mendele to be sure
to write an additional Subject: line in the text.  AND to make sure that
their local machine does not echo back to me the entire text of the
number in question.

Finally, a correction.  From time to time I take it into my head to make
small editing changes (spelling, that sort of thing).  I did so in the
case of Harold Orbach's recent post (Vol 4.057), changing his "sleeress"
to "seeress".  I should have remembered that fellow-sociologist Orbach,
unlike your hapless shames, is a careful writer.  Ven er zogt azoy iz
azoy. For further information on sleeress, see the OED.
