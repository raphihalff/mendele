Subject: Mit halb farmakhte oygn by Anna Margolin
 
Dear noyekh shames (one m, please, despite the dagesh
in the mem in Heb. sha`mash): I wrote the following
several years ago at the request of someone who was
preparing a critical anthology of Yiddish poetry.  I
did not pursue the project, but I am now curious as to
how my reading strikes other readers of Anna Margolin,
in whom there seems to be a certain interest these
days. I just heard the Dept. of Yiddish at the Hebrew
Univ. has issued a volume devoted to the poet -- I have
not yet seen it.  This reading has not been tested by
reference to the poet's work as a whole, but it does
glance briefly at her life.

A Reading of Anna Margolin's "Mit halb farmakhte oygn" 

                 by Leonard Prager (Haifa)
 
I.  Transcription  (according to the Standard Yiddish
Romanizaton)  

    "Mit halb farmakhte oygn"
 
Zitsndik bam tish in groyen zal,
foyl un umruik zikh viklendik in shal,
kuk ikh den af dir?
Ruf dikh den tsu mir?
Nor royter iz mayn moyl atsind,
un di halb farmakhte oygn
mit a roykh fartsoygn.
 
Nor farfleytst bin ikh fun roysh un likht,
un dayn gezikht ze ikh durkh nepl un flam,
un af di lipn iz sharf der tam
fun zun un vint.
 
Nor ikh tsi zikh aruf mit farshtiktn geshrey,
ikh vaks flaterndik, fiberdik azoy {azey},
un dos vaksn tut vey.
 
Farrukt in vinkl fun dem groyen zal,
In di lange flamendike faldn fun shal,
kuk ikh den af dir?
Ruf dikh den tsu mir?
Nor ikh hob veytiklekh, un tif, un blind
mit halb farmakhte oygn
Dikh ayngezoygn.
 
II.  Translation (more-or-less literal)
 
 
      "With Half-Shut Eyes"
 
Seated at a table in the gray hall,
Idle and anxious, wrapping myself in my shawl,
I don't look at you, do I?
I don't call you to me, do I?
But my mouth is redder now,
And my half-shut eyes
Are smoky.
 
But I am flooded with sound and light,
And I see your face through fog and flame,
And on my lips the taste
Of sun and wind is sharp.
 
But I pull myself up with a choked cry,
I grow trembling, feverish,
And this growing hurts.
 
Removed to a corner of the gray hall,
In the long flaming folds of my shawl,
I don't look at you, do I?
I don't call you to me, do I?
But a little painfully and deeply and blindly,
With half-shut eyes
I have taken you into myself.
 
III.  Commentary (division into Theme and Form is for
the purpose of analysis only).
 
A.  Theme
 
The speaker of Anna Margolin's "With Half-Shut Eyes"
addresses a lover with whom she is and yet is not in
contact.  The "action" of the poem concerns the
speaker's solution to this dilemma. The setting of the
poem is a "gray hall," doubtless like one of those
meeting halls where Anna Margolin (1887-1952) and her
comrades, in her days as secretary of the anarchist
_Free Workers' Voice_ met to confront the fateful
political issues of the twenties or thirties.  We do
not know why the speaker must avoid her lover, but her
two starkly colloquial and somewhat petulant question-
statements with the almost impossible-to-translate
particle _den_, questions which appear in identical
form in the third and fourth sentences of the first and
last stanzas, suggest an answer.  By some express or
silent compact she understands that her private passion
must be subservient to the social struggle or to some
undefined spiritual goal.  Or if not subservient then
at least muted. Speaking of Anna Margolin's generation
of Russian-born Jewish idealists, but with reference to
those who went to Palestine rather than to North Ameri-
ca, Anita Shapira succinctly describes "the typical
Second Aliya aversion to a public display of emotion. 
Any relationship between the sexes was then a deeply
serious, even ponderous matter, in the spirit of the
great Russian novels, not to be discussed openly and
certainly never to be referred to lightly."(1)  
 
    The first stanza of "With Half-Shut Eyes" opens
with the restless speaker symbolically enveloping
herself in her shawl as she would like her lover to
take her in his arms.  This opening stanza poses an
incommensurable opposition between "gray hall" and
"red{der} mouth." Red is the color of desire and gray,
an achromatic color, is in the popular sense a non-
color, one associated with death and desolation.  This
opposition of "hall" versus "mouth" emblematically
defines the issue at stake.  Moreover, it does so
ironically, since the hall, probably a meeting hall, is
a place where mouths are at work articulating abstrac-
tions.  The speaker, whose mouth is a very red one,
feels flooded with emotion and outside ordinary con-
sciousness.  Her half-shut eyes are eyes that refuse to
yield the night's dreams or to accept a dayworld de-
fined by others.  Whether or not the hall is "smoke-
filled," the speaker's eyes are shaded by a protective
mist, generated from within, which shields her subjec-
tive truth.  

    In the second stanza, the speaker describes
her heightened state.  Her eyes and ears have
been overwhelmed by sound and light, which is to say
that her being is alive with sensation.  Having earlier
referred to her mouth, she speaks here of the _taste_
of sun and wind on her lips.  _Sun_ and _wind_ are
images of natural energy, of cosmic force as opposed to
the cultural products of the _gray hall_, of institu-
tion and of society.  The fresh tastes are ingested at
the mouth, as a child first relates to the world
through the mouth.  The second section of the "broken"
second stanza records the speaker's efforts to "pull
herself up" so as not to be overrun by her feelings. 
She manages to do so "with suppressed cry" and her
self-struggle is a painful one as she consciously
dampens her sexual ardor to meet the "gray hall."  

    The last stanza finds the speaker "displaced in a
corner of the gray hall," the folds of her shawl "flam-
ing" because she is so feverish (l. 13).  Her passion
notwithstanding, she continues to assert her indepen-
dence and does not summon her lover.  Here we finf a
true psychological displacement.  Not wishing to call
to her lover --and thus, perhaps, appear weak and
dependent and unintellectual -- she introjects him,
sucks him into herself.  The crucial final word of the
poem _ayngezoygn_ consists of _ayn-_ 'into' and
_zoygn_'to suck' --  as infants do at the mother's
breast.(2)  This introjection is "blind," unillumined
by conscious will or by the intellectual's enlighten-
ment. The speaker keeps her bargain, but not with
complete passivity. She absorbs her lover into her very
being, exhibiting a power which is feminine, elemental,
maternal. Were she a philosopher she might echo Maurice
Merleau-Ponty: "The world is not what I think, but what
I live."  

B.  Form
 
This love lyric consists of three seven-line variously
end-rimed stanzas, with the middle stanza broken into
two parts of four and three lines respectively (1:
aabbcdd/ 2: effg hih/ 3: aabbcdd). The first and last
stanzas are identical in number of lines and in rime
scheme.  Some readers may see four stanzas (1: aabbcdd/
2: effg/ 3: hih/ 4: aabbcdd).   The stanzaic pattern in
conjunction with the rime scheme helps to structure the
poem's meaning.  The first and third stanzas contain
three couplets and a single unrimed line, the fifth. 
The fifth line of the first stanza rimes with the fifth
line of the third stanza.  Moreover, these fifth lines
rime approximately with the fourth (and central) line
of the second stanza: the perfect rimes _atsind_ and
_blind_ obliquely riming with _vint_ The eighth line,
the only line in the poem which does not even rime
obliquely with any other end of line, does rime with a
word in the middle of the ninth line: _likht_ and
_gezikht_ are significantly linked.  In the poet's own
Northeastern Yiddish, _azoy_ is pronounced _azey_ and
therefore all three lines of the second part of the
second stanza end rime perfectly.  If, however, we
prefer the Standard Yiddish _azoy_, then slant rime is
also present in this part of the stanza, _azoy_ riming
approximately with cit.geshrey_ and _vey_.  Rime, then,
plays an important role in this poem.  The approximate
rimes are centered in the middle of the poem where the
speaker attempts to break out of her passionate mood.
The rimed couplet with which the poem ends adds to the
feeling that a solution at some level has been
found.(3)

cialist Zionist_, translated by Haya Galai, Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1984, p. 41 {originally
published in Hebrew by Am Oved Publishers, Tel-Aviv,

in the course of her eventful life.
 
2. "ayngezoygn" (see :HP1.Groyser verterbukh fun der
yidisher shprakh: "aynzoygn", 3:1153, col. 1) is a tough
word to translate in the present context.
