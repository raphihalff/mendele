Subject: Slavic influences on Yiddish syntax

As another card-carrying non-academic, I am not sure exactly what is
technically included in syntax, but the original assertion was that
Slavic languages had given Yiddish vocabulary but had not influenced its
grammatical structure.  Here are two things that strike me as possbile
examples to the contrary:

1.  The use of zikh for first and second persons as well as third.

2.  The near disappearance of perfect tenses in Yiddish.

meylekh viswanath (6.160) asks two questions that may be on other
people's minds as well:

first, the simple one: 'infl' is the node that dominates things like
tense. short for 'inflection' -- but involving those inflections (and
not just inflections) that pertain to the finite verb. sorry for not
explaining it before.

the second one, why do we say that german and dutch and old yiddish are
'subject-object-verb' but that the verb moves into 2nd position in the
main clause and NOT that they're 'subject-verb-object' but that the verb
moves to the end in subordinate clauses?

well, you _could_, but you'd also need a bunch of _other_ rules as well,
to get everything in the right place:

1. you'd still need a verb-second constraint since the finite verb
in main clauses has to be in 2nd position, which may or may not be
after the subject:

[* = impossible, ungrammatical]

 old yiddish: aun di zelbn hiidsn kliidr tet er an
	      and the same heathen clothing put he on
	     *aun di zelbn hiidsn kliidr er tet an
	      'and the same heathen clothing he put on'
	      [bovo 263]

 german: auf diesem gebiet habe ich keine erfahrung
         *auf diesem gebiet ich habe keine erfahrung
	 'in this field i have no experience'

2. consider main clauses with compound tenses or complex verbs --
it's only the finite part that is in 2nd position -- the rest of
the 'verb stuff' is at the end, following the objects, etc:

 old yiddish: der duzig HUT dir laiidr diin brudr tsu tut GISLAGN
              the hat HAS you-dative alas your brother to death HIT
	      'that one alas killed your brother'
	      [bovo 238]

	  [see 1st example above for clause-final separable prefix:
	    ...TET...AN 'put on']

 german: viele deutsche revolutionaere SIND in den jahren 1848 und 1849
	 nach amerika GEKOMMEN.
	 'many german revolutionaries came to america in the years
	 1848 and 1849'

	 wir ZIEHEN diese methode der alten VOR
	 'we prefer these methods to the old ones' [vorziehen 'prefer']

(sorry for the ponderous examples! i don't know either of these
languages and so can't make up nice simple ones but have to take
what i find.)

anyway, it's an 'occam's razor' thing -- if you say it's subject-obj-
verb plus the verb-2nd constraint, you account for ALL the facts; if
you say it's subj-verb-obj, you still need the verb-2nd constraint,
_plus_ you need to stipulate a _lot_ of other rules to get it right. by
the way, the first person that noticed this, at least in modern terms,
was a guy jan koster working on dutch, barely 25 years ago. i guess it
takes a few centuries for some finding, however elegant it may be, to
make it into the language-instruction textbooks. ;)

Subject: Yiddish palindromes

In regard to my recent request for Yiddish palindromes, it occurs to me
that I didn't indicate whether I was thinking of transliterated
palindromes or oysyes.  The answer, of course, is that I'm interested in
both.  But since we have not yet entered the new era wherein oysyes can
be transmitted electronically, I'd be grateful to have palindromes in
oysyes sent to my postal address: Al Grand 933 Lawrence Court North
Bellmore, NY 11710

And speaking of "new eras" here is a gem of a palindrome that addresses
itself to that topic and which verges on the inspirational:

"Are we not drawn onwards, we Jews, drawn onward to new era?"

Al Grand
