Subject: The Internationale - oyf/af

In my grandparents' book "dos revolutsionere rusland" (New York:
yidisher sotsialistisher federatsiye in amerika, 1917) I find this
version of the first two lines of the Internationale:

shtet [shin-tes-ayen-hey-tes] oyf, ir ale, ver vi shklafen,
in hunger leben muz, in noyt!

The refrain is as follows in this version:

dos vet zayn shoyn der letster
un entshidener shtrayt;
mit dem internatsional
shtet oyf, ir arbeyt-layt!

I too would like to know, from a native speaker (singer?), how "shtet oyf"
would be pronounced.

Subject: Af vs. oyf and related questions

I was surprised to learn that the pronunciation of oyf as written is
regarded as nerdish. When I think back to my mother's speach it is true
that she generally said "afn tish" or " mir darfn fri ufvakhn" (zi iz fun
minske gubernya, belarus gekumen). However I have always had the
Éàüûimpression that that was colloquial speach. As I recall, when she
wantedßú to speak "proper" she would use "oyf dem tish" or "Ihr darft fri
oyfvakhn". I know that she couldn't have learned that in school since she
never attended a day of school in her life (and was rather proud of the
fact that despite that she was literate in Russian, Yiddish and English,
each requiring a different set of scripts ..both printed and cursive.)

My question is, is the native Yiddish speaker generally conscious of the
existence of a "proper" Yiddish despite the fact that he almost always
speaks colloquially his native dialect? Or is Yiddish really _only_ a
collection of related dialects which the modern academic is attempting to
codify into a standard language? And if the latter is the case, by what
criteria can this be accomplished (since there has never been a Jewish
national state with a sponsored Yiddish dialect)? Of course if in the
back of a native speaker's mind he is able to distinguish colloquial from
"proper" that would be more than half the battle.

A related question which I have posed on earlier ocassions, but never
received a reply: How does the academic sponsored Yiddish dialect taught
at universities relate to the language spoken in the surviving native
Yiddish communities of the khasidim? And in case of a conflict shouldn't
the native speakers of the living language carry far more weight than the
academics (unless of course the speakers of the living language concede
that they are really speaking coloquially, and they recognize the
existence of a "proper" Yiddish")?

From the resounding silence I seem to have heard whenever I have raised
this question in the past I get the impression that no one in our khevre
either knows or cares how the living language is being employed in the
real world. Is this an unfair or untrue characterization of our current
situation? I beg enlightenment.

Subject: We need a Yiddish teacher for our children!

Our small secular Yiddish Shul needs a Yiddish teacher to work with our
children every Saturday morning from 10 to 1.  We meet in lower
Manhattan, usually in someone's home.  Our children range from 6 to 17
years old, and we split into groups by age and ability to learn music,
culture, history, holidays, customs, and, with someone's help, Yiddish.
If you are interested, please E-Mail me at:  K9Kastle@aol.com., and I'll
put you in touch with our director.  We are the Chaike Klebansky "Little
Mittle Shul,"  we are very small, and very heymish.  Thanks.

Subject: Yiddish lives in many ways

A Yiddish-impaired (but, he insists, not Yiddish-deprived) friend, Milton
Riback, posted the following to me under the subject, "News from Borough
Park":

"A friend from there told us of a new baby in the neighborhood. She was
named Sheyndele--after her grandmother.

"The grandmother's name was Stephanie!"

Subject: Language tone: Yiddish/German

In the process of translating the collected poetry of a Yiddish writer, I
came upon one poem which survived only in a German translation done under
I know not what circumstances.  Or so I thought.  Later I acquired a
Yiddish version of the same poem.  They are substantially the same poem,
with a few line differences.  I have no data about the actual chronology
of either, nor can I ever obtain any.  The poem, in either version, is
substantially influenced by Rilke in tone and subject matter...

I do not know German.  But I know that the translation I have is a good
literal one...as is the Yiddish translation.  What fascinates me is the
difference in the two literal translations, tone wise, though I can
recognize that they stem from basically the same text.  But since I do
not know if one or the other was chronologically prior, and/or a
revision, I have come to wonder about the larger question of tone--or is
there a better word?-- in the two languages.  The closest analogy I can
think of is the difference in English between the use of Latinate and
Anglo-Saxon word synonyms.  But that is a misleading analogy in ways too,
since it is not only the difference in the word choices but in the
sentence structure I refer to--i.e. the emphasis points and logical
sense.

I think of a comment A German Jewish psychoanalyst once made to me about
his reason for wanting to learn Yiddish:  something about the German word
for "ambivalence"  (?) and the Yiddish, which literally means, he said,
that which one turns around inside oneself  (?).

I'd appreciate any thoughts on this fairly esoteric subject!  Thanks.
