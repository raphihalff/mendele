Subject: Shnipishok

Neakh Zide wrote, in mendele 3.056 (sorry, but I've just caught up
after being ridiculously behind in my reading for the past few
weeks), to ask about the place name Shnipishok.

I remember my father-in-law a"h, a shtarker litvak, using this name
in much the same way that my southern-Polish family used Patshutsh
(Paczucz?), i.e., to refer to somplace far away.  The latter is a
real place, but far distant from Bendin (Bedzin), whence my
grandparents came.  I always assumed Shnipishok was a real place,
but since I've also heard (and used) 'Yenemsvelt' in this context
and recently heard 'Kenishkakn' from a friend in Detroit (I was
driving at the time, and nearly hit a tree!), I'm not really sure.
These kinds of terms tend to be pretty local - obviously, no one
from near Patshutsh would use that name to refer to someplace far
away.  Ver veyst, maybe they said Bendin.

Subject: Yivo transcription for lyrics

i think one could be in favor of a standard (e.g. yivo)
transliteration orthography for general prose purposes and still use
a more sound-based one for lyrics and poetry and any other situation
where the intent was to convey a regional dialect. what would you do
if your group could actually read yiddish? the problem would be the
same, of course.

the whole issue of what dialect is used for artistic performance in
yiddish is a very interesting one. as i understand it, the theatre
ignored the newly proclaimed standard, so prilutski came out with a
'compromise'--a second standard dubbed 'teater-yidish', which, so
far as i can tell, is identical to the voliner yidish that the
actors were using anyway! i guess he wanted to be sure to find a
standard that would be accepted. :) the reference is:

Prilutski, N. 1927. Di yidishe bineshprakh. Yidish Teater 2.129-44.

btw, i was told by the singer emil gorevits that, as late as the
early 1970s, it was FORBIDDEN to use any dialect other than standard
yiddish in the yiddish state theatre in moscow. (and we can't blame
the kremlin for this bit of totalitarianism!)

what is to me very amazing is that just about everyone DID finally
adopt either standard yiddish or teater-yidish in performance, with
a very few exceptions. most of the exceptions involve some sort of
mockery or else special uses of nonstandard regional dialects for
certain songs only (shartse karshelekh is typically sung in central
'galits' yiddish; moishe oysher uses his native southeastern 'tote-
mome lushn' for certain southeastern songs, as do the barry sisters,
etc. i'm not counting isa kremer, who always sang in 'tote-mome
lushn', since she'd reached stardom before the standards were
proclaimed.) the only real exception i know of was a singer named
sarah gorby, who sang EVERYTHING, including
serious/romantic/high-falutin' songs, in her native 'tote-mome
lushn'. i actually did a study charting her use of the dialect in
recordings over a 40-yr period, the results of which were that she
clearly was trying to hold on to it but that it was slipping away in
spite of her intentions, no doubt due to all the subtle and
not-so-subtle pressures to avoid stigmatized dialects (she was
living in france and recording there, in south america, and in
israel). i can give you some references, if it interests you.

to cary, on spitting three times:

they don't spit three times only in chicago! i was raised in
brooklyn with the knowledge ( :) ) that spitting three times (or at
least making a ritualized spitting movement and sound, which i've
always rendered as 'ptui ptui ptui') is an effective means of
warding off a 'nehore' (or 'canary', in my native yinglish). it
follows 'kinehore', as in 'oy, azoy sheyn kinehore ptui ptui ptui!'

-------------------------------------
to beatrice and others, on -ian:

one problem with the -yan of grubyan being cognate of the suffix in
oxonian etc is the stress: it's grubYAN, whereas one would expect
GRUByan if it were a suffix, no? if it's germanic, it would
presumably have to be a compound noun to get that stress (hence my
folk etymology making it akin to french grosjean); you guys have
convinced me that it's slavic. anybody know the slavic etymology?

Subject: Transcription vs. transliteration

Bob Goldberg's comments in MENDELE 3.080 reveal a common
misapprehension of the difference between transcription (represent-
ing the vsoundsv of a language) and transliteration
(representing the vspellingv of a language written in a
non-Roman alphabet). When one is citing a Yiddish source in, say, a
bibliography, or when one needs to romanize a headline in a Yiddish
newspaper, the proper approach is to "transliterate" -- and
regardless of how the author or the romanizer pronounces the words,
the accepted Yiddish transliteration scheme is the YIVO standard.

I should add that, when used in this way, the YIVO system is
actually an amalgam of transliteration (for the non-loshn-koydesh
elements of the language) and transcrip- tion (for loshn-koydesh
elements).

The YIVO system may also be used for the purposes of pure transcrip-
tion (perhaps with a note indicating that the transcription is based
on a particular dialect of Yiddish).  Indeed, the example given by
Bob Goldberg ("Ba mir bisti git, ba mir hosti 'it'") is perfectly
compatible with vtranscriptionv of Yiddish according to the YIVO
system.

I might add that, for the purposes of bibliographical citations, I
really do object to those who "improve" the romanization by turning
"idish" (when it's spelled with an alef) into "yidish." True
transliteration, as I say, is intended to represent the spelling
used in the cited source.

The problem with certain other Yiddish transcription systems (e.g.,
those used by professional linguists), for now at least, is that
they cannot be used in electronic forums such as MENDELE.  But that
is a technical obstacle only, as far as I'm concerned.  The
inability of this medium to display the symbols used in linguistic
transcription serves as an argument (for the time being) to rely on
the YIVO system, whether used for transliteration or transcrip- tion
purposes.

I'm sure this is all as clear as mud.
