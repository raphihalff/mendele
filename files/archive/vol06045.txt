Subject: Dos talesl

With respect to Bernard Katz' inquiry about the line "ober bloyz dem
talis nemt er nit" - the line comes from the refrain of the famous song
by Solomon Smulewitz-Small "Dos Talesl", as Bob Rothstein has indicated.
Although Smulewitz or Shmulevitch wrote words and music to many songs,
including the popular "A brivele der mamen," music to this song was
written by the composer team Arnold Perlmutter and Herman Wohl.
Rothstein cited a copy of the sheet music dated l9l2.  At YIVO we have
songsheets dated l906, l921, l960. We also have the Smulewitz manuscript
Collection in the YIVO Archives, consisting of some 200 songs. "Dos
talesl" was sung in the play "Der yid in Sobyeskis tsaytn".  I am
quoting the refrain from Smulewitz" book "Lider", NY l9l3:

Dos talesl iz nor dos eyntsike kleyd, / Far dem yidn in zayn freyd un
leyd. / Fun zayn geburtstog biz in keyver / Geyt es mit im mit. / Vert
iberal geyogt, / Zayn lebn iz geplogt, / Ales vos er farmogt, / Nemt men
tsu fun yid, / Ales, ales, nor dem tales, / Dos nemt men nit./ Neyn,
neyn, neyn, neyn!.

Subject: Dos Talisl

The song "Dos Talisl" was composed by Solomon Smulewitz (w) with music
by the team of Arnold Perlmutter and Herman Wohl for the 1906 show "Der
Yid in Sabiesky's Tsaytn". The song was one of the first major hits of
the American Yiddish stage and was  recorded by several stars of the
Yiddish theater including Kalman Juvelier, William Schwartz and even
Smulewitz himself (although his 1906 recording of it was never
released.)

Subject: Instructional materials for non-standard Yiddish

I have been approached by someone looking for materials to learn
Yiddish, but who wants to learn non-standard Yiddish.  I learned my
non-standard Yiddish in a non-formal setting, and don't know what, if
anything, is available.  My impression (from afar) is that most of the
learning materials used in the haymishe community are geared to very
young children; does anyone know of anything geared to adults?

A shaynem dank.

Subject: Yiddish names needed

Here's the deal (di mayse fun der geshikhte iz aza):

The L.A. Sholem Community Organization is preparing to celebrate the
120th anniversary of Yiddish theatre with the 10th in its own series of
original plays, in English, almost all of which have been based on
outstanding works of Yiddish literature and whose cumulative audience
has reached about 10,000.

The SCO plays are unique in that they are written to provide roles for
all the members of the Community--from ages 4 to 88--who wish to
participate. That has meant as many as 90 speaking roles.

So--we need as many as 90 _names_, given and family, to designate all
these roles. This year's play will be set in Eastern European cities and
shtetlekh, so we need authentic Yiddish names. Not unique names, just
ordinary, everyday names, starting, perhaps, with khave (Eve) and ending
with sheyndl. Or sheyne-sheyndl.

I've assured our playwriting collective that the Mendelistn will either
suggest a printed source or come up with lists of their own from which
we can draw. In turn, we will combine all such lists and make them
available to Mendele and tsu gor der velt (all the world).

A hartsikn dank in foroys.

Subject: Undzere Klasiker and the defeminization of Yiddish

Irena Klepfisz, an important contemporary Yiddish poet, thinker,
essayist, editor, anthologist, and lecturer, has created an introduction
to "Found Treasures - Stories by Yiddish Women Writers" brimming over
with facts regarding the place denied Yiddish women writers, and with
feminist interpretations of literature, as absorbing as any of the works
that surface in this treasured, prose collection, the first to bring the
voices of Yiddish women to readers of English.

She virtually sings of Yiddish, its birth in Ashkenaz, Loter, its
maturation, its broadening, its many uses, over the last thousand years.

Of the time when Yiddish was regarded the language of women, she delves
into the process that devalued it; this feminization of Yiddish limited
its use to things secular, or to communicate feelings, while Hebrew was
equated with the male, with intellectual discourse, with holiness, with
tanakh. Yet, she postulates, Yiddish contains much loshn-koydesh; many
men were poor and illiterate and did not know Hebrew, nor did they
study; some learned men valued Yiddish (i.e. the Vilner Gaon insisted
his daughters and sons learn Yiddish); rabbis spoke Yiddish and used it
in their dealings and pronounced judgments; and there were women - the
zogerin, the rebetsin, etc. who were literate in Hebrew.

She reviews the broadening of mame-loshn through tkhines, through
religious Yiddish literature in vaybertaytsh, and the Bove bukh for
"vayber and proste mentshn", also its use by Khosidim to rebel against
the rabbinic authority, and its legitimatizing by the yiddishists of the
haskole bavegung and its many fervent isms.

Now we're in the 19th century where Mendele, Peretz and Sholom Aleykhem,
though ambivalent about it, turned to writing in Yiddish as an
"identification with the masses through their spoken language." Mendele,
she says, likened it to having an affair with a stranger, and Peretz and
Sholom Aleykhem wondered if they would be understood by the masses.
Yet, Yiddish now belonged to the male, to the patrilineal dynasty of the
grandfather (Mendele), the father (Peretz), and the eynikl, Sholom
Aleykhem, by whom these familial designations were proclaimed.

She theorizes that this defeminizing was an attempt at universality, but
now Yiddish writing dealt with the primacy of men's feelings, often in
first person narratives with men's perceptions and feelings. Frequent
negative depictions of shtetl women as "shrewish, conniving and gossipy
- helped male writers to bond with male readers and to establish a male
audience."

Mendele's popular "Travels of Benjamin the Third (1878)" sets the tone
of man-to-man address. With his friend, Sender (demeaned by the nickname
"Housewife"), the two still paint women as fools and shrews who torture
their husbands.

Sholom Aleykhem's portrayals of women are gentler as are his narrators
(Tevye sometimes even cries like a woman, but he puts down his wife and
talks of his daughters as burdens.) Tevye's daughters, each depicting an
aspect of life of the times, could be considered a major breakthrough,
yet we know them only through Tevye and never hear their views. The
women characters, she claims, are used to explore men's feelings about
modernization.

Peretz, of the three, openly championed women and their cause, yet
"Monish" (1888) which was hailed as expressing the feelings of a whole
Jewish generation, is a man's poem about "men's conflicts, sexual needs,
attachment to Judaism, and artistic aspirations." His interest in
Hasidic tales and in di goldene keyt focused on a male dynasty where
even Bontshe Shvayg suffered the burden of a cruel, deceitful wife who
abandoned him and the son he is unaware he did not father.

Klepfisz' thinking, sharply and narrowly focused, gives intensity to her
penetrating ideas. Has she sullied our classical triumvirate, or is she
an artistic taskmaster who, in her intensity, demands more of these
literary giants than the times that bound them would allow?

Subject: Yiddish women writers

_Found Treasures - Stories by Yiddish Women Writers_ is edited by Frieda
Forman, Ethel Raicus, Sarah Silberstein Swartz and Margie Wolfe, with an
Introduction by Irena Klepfisz  Published in 1994 by Second Story Press
720 Bathurst St Toronto, Ontario M5S 2R4

Yiddish women writers have been allowed their confined place in poetry,
but "Found Treasures" forges a breakthrough for their voices to be heard
through their prose writings.

The stories invoked a sense of awe and admiration in me that these
Ashkenaz women - suffering not only economic hardships and pogroms, but
the restrictive policies of the state and of their  husbands and fathers
- found the intellectual and creative energy to record their thoughts
and feelings.

Some of the stories re-echo the pain of alienation and subordination so
powerfully transmitted in their poems, the same agony of enforced
silence, of a muteness so soulful and deep it renders Bontshe Shveig a
diffuse, wordy, garrulous character. In the highly imaginative "The New
World", Esther Singer Kreitman presents the thoughts of an embryo
yearning to be born, but she learns her powerlessness as a female begins
early, while still floating in amniotic fluid. Fradel Schtok's "The
Veil" poignantly depicts a young girl's alienation and longing to exist
beyond the prison of  the stifling shtetl. Rokhl Brokhes' "The Zogerin"
depicts an unjust life of dutiful praying for others, ending in
depressive bitterness and pathetic madness.

Yet, in full grasp of their legacy since Biblical days, some writers
(i.e. Miriam Raskin, Yente Serdatzky) come shining through as forceful
women of valor, competent, independent, confident though conflicted
between traditional values and the call of freedom and progress.

If literature, as we believe, helps shape self-image, or creates
ego-strength through identification, within these pages we meet role
models for our daughters to honor and emulate. A beautiful excerpt from
Malka Lee's "Durkh Kindershe Oygn" paints unfaltering dedication to her
secular writing when it was frowned upon by her father, a Khosid, and
the entire religious community. Kadya Molodowsky's heroine in "A House
with Seven Windows" makes Moll Flanders appear passive and
dysfunctional. Other heroines courageously leave for America, join the
Bund, become activists, and take charge of their own lives.

Complete with photographs, biographies, a glossary, and a bibliography
of each author's works (which alone is worth the price of the book), it
is a valuable addition to any library.

Writers included are: Lili Berger, Rokhl Brokhes, Celia Dropkin, Shira
Gorshman, Sarah Hamer-Jacklyn, Rachel Korn, Esther Singer Kreitman,
Malka Lee, Blume Lempel, Ida Maze, Kadya Molodowsky, Rikudah Potash,
Miriam Raskin, Chava Rosenfarb, Fradel Schtok, Yente Serdatzky, Dora
Schulner, and Chava Slucka-Kestin.

Translators are: Roma Erlich, Frieda Forman, Shari Cooper Friedman,
Barbara Harshav, Ronnee Jaeger,  Irena Klepfisz, Shirley Kumove, Goldie
Morgenthaler, Norma Fain Pratt, Ethel Raicus, Henia Reinhartz, Brina
Menachovsky Rose, Sarah Silberstein Swartz, Miriam Waddington, and
Margie Wolf.

We, on Mendele, should buy the book to support the organizers of this
project in their work for future translations and publications, women
who have alone broken down the wall that excludes Yiddish women writers
from anthologies that present our unique literature to a growing group
of English readers.

Two thumbs up, and a blessing on all their Canadian kepelekh, as we look
forward to volume 11 and 111, un azoy vayter....
