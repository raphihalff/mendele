Mikhl, I'm confused as to what you're asking.  Are you
stating that these constructions are normal in
{some/most/all} Yiddish, and asking about the origin of
"es"?  If so, I'd appreciate an explanation as to what "es"
means here, how it's used, and who uses it this way.  These
constructions look totally unfamiliar to me.*

  *From this last sentence you know for sure I'm not a
   native speaker.  If I were, I would say "that's not
   Yiddish!" rather than simply "I've never heard it".  :-)

Subject: jewish last name Spetter:dutch or yiddish?

For a while I have been trying to find information on the
origins of the family name of a friend of mine, who is from
jewish descent. (I am not going to conduct a full
genealogical search, I just want to find out the
etymological background of the name).

I don't have much to go by, just a picture of a barely
readable tombstone in The Hague. The last name, 'Spetter',
is spelt shin (or sin, I can't tell) peh-ayin-tet-tet-ayin-
resh. This can hardly be a Hebrew word; it must be either
Dutch or Yiddish.

In Dutch 'Spetter' means something like 'drop (of liquid)',
'splash'. It is a normal word, but used as a name has a
rather comical feel to it. This is in itself possible: when
Napoleon introduced obligatory last names in 1811, many
Dutch people registered under mock names, not taking the
new institution seriously (much to the chagrin of the later
generations who have inherited these rather embarrassing
last names up to the present day).

In Yiddish, according to a Yiddish dictionary, the verb
'spetn' (shin-peh-ayin-tet-nun) means 'to ridicule'.
Theoretically, there could be a Yiddish word 'spetter',
meaning 'someone who ridicules', very akin to the Dutch
word 'spotter' with the same meaning. I don't know however,
if that would/could be spelled with double tet.

My question: does anybody with more knowledge of Yiddish
than I do have any suggestions as to which of the two
solutions is the most probable?

The spelling with double tet is probably decisive.

Apparently (although not beyond all doubt), my friend's
relatives have come from Spain in the 1500's. This would
mean that they have been sefardim, right? Would that affect
the probability of the name deriving from Yiddish?

[David Sherman asks:]

>Are there other names or words in Yiddish that have come
>into existence through this kind of acronymming?

there are a bunch. unfortunately, the only names that come
to mind at the moment are ash/asch and azoulay (a
sephardic/ oriental name). and rashi? or is it rambam? or
both?

for other words, there's tenakh. and a million others, none
of which i can think of.

can't wait to hear all the ones other mendelnikes will come
up with.

Subject: RE: frum

In answer to the question concerning the word "frum", it
seems to be quite similar to the German word "fromm", which
means "pious, religious, godly, devout".  "Frum", as used
in Yiddish, has very much this meaning.

While we are on etymologies, could someone tell me the
origin of the "knish"?

Subject: pe tsadek

1. Without detracting from the punning irony in the
euphemism 'pe tsadek' for 'pots', it does NOT result from
the intentional humorous substitution of 'tsadek' (virtuous
person) for 'tsade' (letter of the alphabet).  'Tsadek' IS
the Yiddish name for that letter of the Jewish alphabet,
resulting, no doubt from metanalysis in reciting the
original sequence 'tsade, kuf, resh,' etc.  Thus the
correct answer to "vi leyt men oys dos vort 'kats'?" is
"kuf, pasekh alef, (langer) tsadek."  You can check this in
Weinreich.

2. With regard to the nuances of 'pots' vis-a-vis other
derogatory epithets, here is an illustrative anecdote from
the late forties, told to me in an undertone by an
otherwise very proper mitlshul lerer:

A yid gefint zikh oyf a shif in mitlendishn yam.  Er fort
ergets vu, nor er iz azoy fartumlt fun ales vos er hot
shoyn durkhgemakht, az er ken zikh beshum oyfn nit
dermonen, vi heyst di shtot vu er darf arop fun shif.
Dreyt er zikh arum an umglik- lekher, un a tsveyter Yid
bamerkt es, un fregt vos iz im.  Dert- seylt im der ershter
az er veyst nit vu aroptsugeyn fun shif. Der tsveyter ken
gor nit gloybn az emitser ken zayn aza min idyot un git a
zog: "A pots a yid! "  Derfreyt zikh der ershter un zogt:
"Oy a lebn oyf aykh!  Dos iz dos, take: Port Said!"
