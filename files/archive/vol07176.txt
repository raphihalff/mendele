Subject: Hershele Ostropoler

In response to David Ebner's request (07.171), I have a copy of "Hershele
Ostropoler un Motke Khabad" in Yiddish published by the Star Hebrew Book Co.
(no date given).  Also, in Ruth Levitan's "A Sheyner Gelekhter" there are a
number of Hershele stories in transliterated Yiddish.

Subject: Ostropolyer stories

Regarding David Ebner's question:  several stories about Hershel Ostropolyer
can be found in Nathan Ausubel's A treasury of Jewish Folkore. "Ostropolyer" 
is in the index, and there is a whole section of stories.

Henry Spalding's Encyclopedia of Jewish Humor also has the one about the
"spontaneous lie", there may be other stories, but as there's no index it
might not be worth the time. I didn't see anything in the chapter on
Schnorrers.

If any Mendele-khaverim have any information about the historical Herschel,
I'm sure I'm not the only one who would be curious.

Zayt gezunt!

Subject: Hershele Ostropolier

I am no expert, but the material I hgave read suggests that Hershele
Ostropolier actually existed. Two collections which have stories about Hershel
are: Nathan Ausubel, A TREASURY OF JEWISH FOLKLORE, Crown Publishers, and
Irving Howe and Eliezer Greenberg, A TREASURY OF JEWISH STORIES (not sure of
publisher). As to why Hershel was not rich-- he didn't want to be. He was a
truth-teller, a man who used his wit and 'street-smarts' to expose the
hypocrisy, posturing, and snobbery of the wealthy. He was the everyman of the
little man. Many cultures have such figures. Hershel Ostropolier is ours.  

One more source for an Ostropolier story. In Sheva Zucker's wonderful text
"Yiddish, An Areinfir: Loshn, Literatur, un Kultur". (Arbeter Ring)  The story
is in Unit 9, and is called 'Klaider'. Read and enjoy. (And thanks to the
people at the YIVO Columbia Summer Institute for introducing me to this
text. Credit where it's due.)

Subject: smoes/smoesje

On the discussion re: shmusen/shmuesn, etc.:  the etymon has made it into
non-Jewish Dutch as well:  smoes 'excuse' (noun), dim. form:  smoesje.  This
word is listed in general dictionaries (e.g. Dutch - English), in addition to
the well-known works concerning Jewish speech (Voorzanger & Polak 1915; Beem
1967).

Subject: Hare hunt in Hagodes

Hershl Hartman wrote in mendele 07.172: "As I recall it, the cartoon was a
mnemonic for the order of the first seyder when it coincides with _shabes_: 
Yayin (wine), Kidish (blessing), Ner (candles), Ha-Zman (blessing of
thanksgiving)= YaKiN HaZ = yogn hoz (chasing rabbit/hare)." 

Close, but no cigar.  I just finished learning the relevant portion of perek
arvey psoxim (chapter 9 of gemore psoxim), where there is a discussion about
the order of the blessings in the kiddush of any yomtov evening when it falls
immediately _after_ shabbos.  The last two letters of the abbreviation
yod-kuf-nun-he-zayin refer to havdolo (the ceremony marking the end of shabbos
or yom tov) and zman (i.e., shehexiyonu).  The Friday night yomtov kidush is
the same as any other yomtov kidush (except for the addition of the vaykhulu
paragraph at the beginning), and has no brokho on candles; yomtov candles are
lit while it is still light, at least an hour before kidush (for which we must
wait until dark).  I believe that Reb Hershl is quite correct, though, as to
the connection of the illustration to Yiddish; I never heard Diane Wolfthal's
interpretation before. 

Zayt mir ale gezunt un shtark.

Subject: entfer mir/mikh

Sam Kweskin's frage:  If you think of "entfer" as meaning "reply" -- then "it
makes sense to say "entfer mir,"  "reply to me," not "reply me."

Subject: gutahr 

Rhonda Friedman asks about _gutahr_ in the following rhyme remembered by her
mother: "Ich hub a gutahr in mein nuz.  Shtaarbn vehl Ich zeechah balt, veil
in mein nuz hub Ich a kalt" 

I don't know, but I would guess that it's the Yiddish variant of English
_catarrh_, German _Katarrh_. It's not in Weinreich, unfortunately. If
that's it, the YIVO-ized version of the rhyme would be:

        Ikh hob a katar in mayn noz. 
        Shtarbn vel ikh zeyer balt,
        vayl in mayn noz hob ikh a kalt.

Subject: Correction re kurve

In an earlier posting I wrote:

"Another point is that, as shown again by khorbe, Hebrew can only have beyz,
not veyz in this situation (and I dont see where we could get a vov from), so
would have to expect Yd *korbe, rather than kurve (* means that the form is
hypothetical). Since the form IS kurve and not korbe, a Hebrew etymology is
not possible, QED (assuming all the premises are correct, which I am PRETTY
sure they are)." 

Apparently, PRETTY SURE is not good enough. Meyer Wolf and Bob Hoberman
pointed out to me that Hebrew CAN have veyz after reysh after all, and there
seems to be some disagreement about the vowel too, so I may have to withdraw
this whole line of argumentation. For although the methodological point I made
is still valid, I seem to have chosen the wrong example to take a stand on.  I
am sorry to have confused the issue.

Subject: glock

In reply to Fred Sherman's question about "glock" in the Joe and Paul ditty I
would submit the possibility that it relates to the  telephone-bell
relationship. Glock is German for bell , hence  its use for  ,"ring me up".
