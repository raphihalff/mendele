Subject: David's Violin

I'm looking for David's Violin / Dovids Fidele by Joseph Lateiner; I know it
has been published in Mark Slobin's 'Retuning Culture' but that is not
available in any Dutch library; does anyone know another book or collection
where it was published? (yiddish or english)

Thanks,
Gerben Zaagsma

Subject: more of my mother's and father's argot/patois(?)

In the old films and mystery novels of my 30's childhood, police searching for
a body in a lake fired off canons to cause victims to rise to the surface.
That's been the effect on me of some of the Mendele postings I've been reading
that have dealt with the idioms and delicious expressions that have resonated
throughout my life, and especially in the last decade since both of my parents
have departed. I offer the following in the hope that readers might know a bit
more about them than I do:
1) We worked hard to avoid being leftback in school for fear of being termed
"leck lukh."   My mother also used it to describe "being late" or missing out,
such as missing the boat, bus, etc. 2) Describing someone who was really
scared of something, my mother would say:" Ze chittert vee a huhnt in nine
teg." I know it has something to do with Tisha B'Av and the famine and wonder
how widespread was this expression's use and did it apply to other events or
circumstances. 3) "Tsebetsky's yurren" is a sump of an expression with too
many applications to list here. I'd be interested in what Mendelyaners recall
about it. It connotated a long period of time, that's for sure. 4) My clothes,
my bed, my hygiene and my eating habits were frequently described by my
parents as "ehkloft." My inadequate dictionary shows "ehkl" as a noun meaning
"disgust." This undoubtedly makes my folks' expression of love an adjective.
Rikhtik?
Is it a Yiddish word or is it derived from Russian or Polish? which is how it
sounds to my old ears. 5) When I got too big for my britches, Pop would curdle
me by calling me a "shmerkotch."  Coming from him it was worse than snot-nose
and here, too, it sounds Slavic more than Yiddish. I know that when he called
me a "shvinyah" he was using the Russian word for pig/swine, but shmerkotch
always stung a bit more.

Subject: Inquiry regarding derivation of yiddish word

I wonder whether someone can help in ascertaining the origin or derivation of
the word greiz spelled as gimmel-reish- yud-yud-zayin meaning mistake,
error,etc. I have consulted two of the most popular yiddish-english
dictionaries with no indication of this word's origin.  Thanks for your help
in this matter.

Subject: translating Yiddish expressions

I've gotten so much help from just that previous brief query, I thought I'd
bother everyone some more.

The beginning and middle of Adar (in Yiddish, if I remember correctly, "oder,"
which according to Weinreich means "or"; is that because the month either is,
or is not, doubled, depending on whether it's a leap year?  Linguists, please
help!) flood my mind with memories.  In particular, my great-granduncle used
to grace the ears of our family with what I'm sure were touching Yiddish
witticisms--unforunately, since no one speaks the language anymore since
George Burns died, I don't know what they mean, and my letters to Ruth Weiss
go unanswered.  Can you help?

Around the dinner table at Shabes gatherings he used to throw down his fork,
and with a twinkle in his eye, say, "Kh'ken beshum ofen nisht aropshlingen dem
farshtunkenem opfal.  Fun zint kh'bin aroys fun geto hob ikh nisht geshmekt
aza khaloshesdikn reyekh."  My great-grandniece, overcome with joy, would
always leave the dining room in tears.  Why was this?

Then there were the warm, "heimische" Friday evenings in shul, when he would
always say, "Vos gorglt zikh der khazn--kh'vil shoyn esn.  Zayn liber nomen
vet farshteyn oyb m'vet iberhipern a por tfiles."  I knew he was saying
something to God in "His" language, but I didn't know what!

And, lastly, when I left the house to study linguistics (I had stayed with him
for most of my adolescence after an unfortunate hamantashn-baking accident
which incapacitated my family), he said, again with that famous twinkle, "Der
vos darf nor eyn etimologye, darf nor eyn froy."

Could someone favor me with the translations?

A dank foroys,
Aridoso Parshandoso

Subject: Article on Forward and YIVO spelling

I invite your attention to an article I wrote recently in Salon, the online
magazine, on The Forward's decision to adopt YIVO spelling.  You can find it
at http://www2.salonmagazine.com/media/1998/02/24media.html.

Subject: a disgrace

I remembered a remark that was made when a person did something
disgraceful or shameful. Now I ask all the experts if they can explain
the meaning of the two phrases. Man mus zikh khapenen and khabene
busheh. A shehnem dank khaverin.

Concerning the question raised by Miriam Isaacs: I cannot shed any light
because Lemberg was not part of my environment.  But I do remember that, at a
time when my family lived in the northern part of New York City known as The
Bronx, we would describe a very distant place as "even as far as Canarsie."
Canarsie is a neighborhood in Brooklyn to which, as I recall, the subway line
did not quite reach. To get there from The Bronx required two trains, with a
five-cent fare each time. After that, it was often necessary to take a bus
(another five cents).  It was quite a trip.
