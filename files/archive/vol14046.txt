Lucas Bruyn writes [14.043]:

     I am not qualified to comment on Joachim Mortello's remark that "the
     Nazis might have changed their plans after observing the desire of
     liberated Soviet nationalities for collective revenge agains all etnic
     Ashkenazim because of the acts of the Ashkenazi Soviet officials during
     collectivization". I would think that some historians would contest such
     a statement. Wasnt that partly German propaganda?

For what it's worth, I am an historian of modern Jewish, Russian and Soviet
history, and would note that both of Martillo's remarks are extremely
problematic as history, leaving aside their deeply irresponsible invidious
comparisons (Palestinians are worse off than German Jews etc., as though a
situation of military occupation and colonial settlement in the context of
an 80-year interethnic and multistate conflict -- however deplorable in its
own terms -- can be intelligibly compared to a situation in which 1% of a
state's population was cast during peacetime and with no actually existing
conflict in the role of insidious race enemy etc; or as though this
comparison helps us ot judge either case, any more than noting that the
Palestinians are much better off than, say, the victims of state-sponsored
terror in Darfur).

His comment on vengeance against "Ashkenazi etc" has of course a core of
distorted truth: the notion that Soviet collectivization policies in teh
Ukraine in teh early 1930s and the Bolshevik regime in general were in some
meaningful sense a 'Jewish' policy struck roots among substantial parts of
the Ukrainian peasant population in the context of a larger notion of
'Judeo-Bolshevism' that became a staple of anti-semitic propaganda already
by 1917, if not earlier; the Ukrainian nationalists of what had been
western Soviet Ukraine and eastern Poland certainly seized on this notion
in teh independent campaign of mass murder which they then pursued against
Jews.  In fact, there were many ethnically Jewish individuals in teh
Bolshevik regime before the late 1930s, including in its 'security' (ie
state terror) organs, among the collectivizers etc; but it is ludicrous to
imagine that they sought to enact some distinct 'Jewish' policy.  Was
Stalinism a "Georgian" policy because Stalin happened to have been born
Georgian? Of course not: Bolshevism was a political religion unto itself,
and its adherents and servitors came from all backgrounds but by definition
broke with these 'parochial' concerns.  Jewish disproportion in the
party-state apparatus seems a lot less disproportionate when one compares
it not to the total Soviet population, but to the Soviet urban and literate
population, incidentally.

Those interested in these issues might consult: Timothy Snyder, The
Reconstruction of Nations; Amir Weiner, Making Sense of War; Zvi Gitelman,
A Century of Ambivalence; and the works of Lynn Viola.

Martillo embeds a more complicated historiographical issue in his
unfortunate remarks: the influence of German contact w/ anti-Soviet forces
(Ukrainian nationalists) on the decision to carry out hte mass murder of
European Jewry.  On the origins of that decision, see the works of
Christopher Browning.

Acutally, though, it is Martillo's prior claim about Zionism and the Nazis
which marks the real blood libel of his message.  The notion that "during
the 30s the majority Zionist leadership actively and often cordially
collaborated with the German Nazis" is simply wrong.    Mainstream Zionism
was convulsed by deep desperation the face of 1930s trends (which many did
see as marking the end of European Jewry in a poltiical and econoimc sense,
though few could imagine actual genocide), not only in Germany but in
Poland and indeed throughout Europe and, we might note, the Arab world.
Zionists played a key role in active Jewish diplomatic efforts against
Nazism in teh 1930s, such as they were.  It was precisely mainstream
Zionists like Stephen Wise who pushed American Jewry to try at least some
sort of symbolic boycott of German goods, for instance; in Germany itself,
it was only the Zionist movement whcih could offer some measure of
self-respect to German Jews forced into the life of racial outcasts.  The
half-truth in Martillo's claim has to do with what was called the Transfer
Agreement, an effort to organize some German Jewish emigration to
Palestine; that this was an act of desperation, an effort to at least draw
some good for the Jewish people from teh intolerable situation in Germany,
is evident to any objective reader.  Mendelyaner are referred to the work
of Yehuda Bauer.

Subject: Re: prezhenitse

In the April 21 issue, there is a discussion of the Yiddish word for
omelet. Sheva Zucker seems to prefer "prezhenitse." Having grown up on a
chicken farm, I ate eggs almost every day, and heard much conversation
about eggs. No one in our community of  yiddish speaking chicken farmers
ever used that word. At least not in my presence. The word for omelet was
'faynkukhen.'  But then again,  what did we know; we were simple farmers.
And we had much more interesting things to argue about, such as how we can
best save the world.

Another Yiddish word for 'omelette' is _ya'yetshnitse_.

Subject: Re: aftsulokhes

Parallel to af-tsulokhes: I used to hear in the '30s, my father, on his
return home from the fur shop on Seventh Avenue say about some unfortunate
meeting, event, coincidence, to begin with, "Rose? treft mir haynt a
glik!"  and recount the disaster... and/or, "You know what happened to X's
business? it went af-tsulokhes - the damned debtors wouldnt pay up! Er iz
shoyn af-tsulokhes...." if my memory serves, which these days...is, well,
somewhat scatty?

Subject: Nevues

[Felicitas Payk asks [14.045] about "nevura".]

Nevues means "prophecies," and that would seem to fit with the verses
meaning "in my song lie many prophecies, that some day you will be spread
(like seeds) throughout the world".

Subject: Re: Slob

My sources for many things Yiddish are my grandmother and mother who came
to the United States from the Ukraine as adults.  The lady who lived five
houses down the street and was considered by my bobe and mother to be a
sloven, was called by them a shtinkerke.  Her house was constantly
disheveled, un-swept sidewalk, dirty dishes in the sink, an odor of
unwashed diapers, throughout, her  children with runny noses and soiled
clothing,etc.. I don't know  whether shtinkerke is an American-Yiddish
expression of the kind Ellen Prince once noted  -- i.e., next-doorikeh, or
upstairsekeh. -- although it may be.   In any case, shtinkerke is the one
word drilled into my memory for "bad housekeeper."  (It was a pretty filthy
household back then, although one of the daughters was quite cute).   There
are expressions my family used to mean irresponsible or lazy girl -- foyle
moyd -- but this doesn't seem to be what's wanted.
