To: Rita Falbel

Using the Daitch-Mokotoff Soundex Coding Ssystem, I have found that your
town is entered as Zamarstynow on p. 405 of _Where Once We Walked_ by
Gary Mokotoff and Sallyann Amdur Sack. No latitude and longitude can be
given because this town was not found in the gazetteers of the U.S. Board
on Geographic Names. It is described in _The Black Book of Localities
Whose Jewish Popuilation Was Destroyed by the Nazis_ as being in the Lwow
region of Poland. It is  mentioned in the _Encyclopedia of Galician
Rabbis and Scholars_. It had a  Jewish population of 2914 before the
Holocaust.

Subject: Zamarstynov

In the memoirs of Leon Wells ("The Janowska Road", Macmillan, New York,
1963), there appears a map of Lwow indicating the location of a section
called Zamarstynowska. The ghetto seems to have been located near this
area and one of the streets forming the boundary of the ghetto was
Zamarstynowska Street.

Subject: Zamarstynow

In 4.252 Rita Falbel asked about Zamarstynov.  It was established in 1422
by the Lemberg burgher Jan Sommerstein on the northern border of that
city and called Sommersteinhof, later Polonized  to Zamarstyno'w.
(Lemberg is of course the Yiddish and German [Austro-Hungarian] name for
the city that is usually known in English by its Russian name, Lvov
[L'vov]; the Ukrainians call it Lviv [L'viv].)  By 1930 Zamarstyno'w was
officially part of Greater Lwo'w (as the Poles called it).  It was an
industrial and working-class area.  During the Nazi occupation it
constituted part of the Jewish ghetto.

Subject: lern, davn and no epenthesis

In the words _tseykhn, ordn, latkhn_ and many, many others, an /e/ is
inserted before the final /n/ of the stem when the inflectional ending
/-en/ of the infinitive or of the 1st/3rd persons plural is added. So
_mir tseykhEnen, zey latkhEnen_ etc. etc., although _ikh tseykhn, er
latkhnt, du ordnst_.

(Without linguistic analysis of the phenomenon,) the generalization is
that when the stem of the verb ends in /n/, add /e/ before it when
inflecting with /-en/.  But _lern, davn_ seem to be exceptions, since in
their inflected form they are:  _lernen, davnen_. (Yes, there are those
who say _davEnen, lerEnen_, so they have regularized these two stems.
But I'm interested in those who have maintained the exception.)

My question:  can you think of any other stems ending in /n/ in which
/e/ is _not_ added?  My thanks in advance.

Subject: Nasidale

In 4.251 Howard Freedman asked about the word _nasidale_ in the context:
"Zey geyen kayn Rakhmanov oyf der nasidale."  He had been correctly
informed that the word involved a Slavic root meaning "sit," but that's
only part of the story.  In Ukrainian _sidalo_ can mean "perch" or
"roost" (e.g., for a chicken); _na sidale_ (prepositional case) would be
"on the perch/roost" and _na sidalo_ (accusative case) would be "(on)to
the perch/roost." So the Yiddish _oyf_ duplicates the Ukrainian
preposition.  The joke presumably comes from the fact that _sidalo_ can
also mean "buttocks."

Subject: Tam yak tut

In 4.251 Zev Bar-Lev correctly pointed out that while _tam_ could be
either Polish or Russian, _yak_ could only be Polish and _tut_ could only
be Russian.  He suggested that the whole expression might work in
Ukrainian, "which does mix Russian and Polish."  He's right that all
three words are good Ukrainian, but saying that that language "mixes
Russian and Polish" shows the same lack of respect that we complain about
when its object is Yiddish.  It might be more appropriate to say that
Ukrainian shares (through common inheritance or borrowing) some words
with its two linguistic neighbors.

Subject: Khoge

With his characteristic wink of an eye, Rick Gildemeister in Mendele
4-247 wished us all "a gute khoge".  Abe Bloom in Mendele 4.248 asks
about the word "khoge," wondering "Efsher iz es nit Yiddish?"  Rick
Gildemeister (a gezunt af dayn kop!) answered in Mendele 4.252 that "the
word is used to mean 'gentile holiday.' I'm assuming there's a connection
to the Hebrew word 'khag' which means holiday."

I've also seen the word used in Yiddish as Rick Gildemeister describes,
in as neutral a sense as Yiddish can have in speaking of days that often
were fraught with terror for the Yiddish-speaking community.  Although
obviously related to the Hebrew word "khag," I guessed that Aramaic was
the more likely direct source, because of the final "alef" instead of a
more Hebraic "he."  So I hit the books.

Jastrow's 1903 "Sefer milim," a dictionary of Talmudic and Midrashic
Hebrew and Aramaic, lists the word, citing several midrashic sources (in
Aramaic), with an apparent definition of "feast" or "festival."  I'm not
a scholar, and the dictionary's annotations are (to me) cryptic, with no
key provided.  Going to a more recent reference, Even-Shoshan's
dictionary of modern Hebrew, "Hamilon haivri hamerukaz," defines "khoga"
as a medieval Hebrew expression for a "gentile holiday, or non-Jewish
"khag." Weinreich confirms the Yiddish definition of "gentile holiday."

I'll leave it to others to discuss whether the use of "khoge" in Yiddish
was generally neutral or otherwise.

A gut gezunt khoge, un a zis nay yor, tsu ale Mendelyaner.
