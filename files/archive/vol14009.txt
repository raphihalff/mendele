Subject: Re: shier nisht

In answer to Marty Green, who asked about shier, it looks like a clear
cognate of Dutch schier - sheer in English.

The sense in Dutch is 'nearly', 'almost', as in schier-eiland (nearly an
island, ergo peninsula), schier aal (almost an eel; an eel with deviant
characteristics), and similar usages. Similar also to some English usages
of sheer - e.g. schier lelijk (utterly ugly).

The Dutch language did not borrow from Yiddish till fairly late in the
game, but Dutch and Yiddish were originally fairly close relatives. The
Germanic root word for shier/schier would probably be something like skeir
or skaer - likely meanings: barely, hardly, almost, or almost not. I doubt
that anybody borrowed it - it was probably always there, in Yiddish, Dutch,
German, and English.

[I really should have a copy of Van Dale's etymological dictionary at my
desk!]

Modern pronunciation of 'ie' in Dutch is 'ee', though in dialects you will
hear, in many Dutch dipthonged one syllable words (ie: schier, boer, thuis,
etc.) the ghost of that second vowel.  Likely it was more than a ghost
centuries ago, not only in Dutch, but also further up the Rhine.  That
might explain the double ayin spelling convention.

The 'Nederlands Etymologisch Woordenboek' (Jan De Vries, fourth printing
(1997), published by Koninklijke Brill, Leiden, The Netherlands) states
that it is derived from middle Dutch sciere / scier, meaning soon, almost,
cognate with Old High German (?) sc§ro, sciaro, scioro (quickly, soon),
derived from sk§iro, from Indo-Germanic skei - to sever, separate. Related
to Latin scire - to know, to distinguish.

The Dictionary of Word Origins (By John Ayto, Arcade Publishing, Inc., New
York 1990) informs that sheer (shear) is "the principal descendant of the
Indo-European base sker - cut', to which are related also score, share,
shirt, short, skirt", etc.  Then goes on to say "The immediate source of
shear (sheer) itself is prehistoric Germanic skeran, which also evolved
into German and Dutch scheren, Swedish sk„ra, and Danish skjaere". Then Mr.
Ayto caveats this by indicating that the adjective sheer "probably
represents a survival of Old English scir - bright, shining". But, as this
must refer to appearance, it is probably not germane to shier.

The Roots of English - A Reader's Handbook of Word Origins, by Robert
Claiborne (Times Books, 1989), gives the root of the cognate sheer as sker,
related to ker - to cut. From which derive also share, sharp, shear, short,
shrub, shirt, un so nokh eppes weiter, shier ohn a shiur.

Clearly, shier is a word of Germanic origin, with relatives in many
Germanic languages.

Subject: Re: shier nisht

The use of shier to connote limit in Yiddish (e.g. vifil a shier, on a
shier, shier nisht. etc...) has absolutely nothing to do with the common
Hebrew application of "shiur" to connote a lesson, but derives rather from
the more general rabbinic Hebrew usage of "shiur" to denote a precise
measure or quantity. In rabbinic Hebrew, "shiur" refers to precise
minimum/maximum amounts regarding the fulfillment of specific halakhic
obligations or transgressions of biblical prohibitions.  For example, the
minimum "shiur" of matza one must eat at the seder to fulfill the mitzvah
of akhiles-matze; or the maximum "shiur" of trayf one consumes before having
trangressed the Biblical dietary laws, etc.....

Weinreich unfortunately conflated these two different Hebrew terms in his
Yiddish dictionary, thereby creating confusion, "on a shier."

Subject: Re: shier nisht

Martin Green's question on "shier nit" prompts me to ask a further
question.  My German dictionary (Oxford Duden) gives two distinct words
"schier": 1) almost,  2) pure, sheer.  The latter is surely cognate with
the with the English "sheer", as in "sheer nonsense" or "an act of sheer
bravery", and former with the Yiddish "shier nit".  In addition I have come
across a Middle High German word "schiere", meaning "quickly", "soon"
(Walshe, "Middle High German Reader").   This would be cognate with the
word in the old Yiddish version of the Passover hymn, the last line of
which runs, I think (I quote from memory):  "boy dayn templ shire", where
"shire" is spelled like the Hebrew word for song, but which the Hebrew
version shows to mean ''soon''.  My question is, are all these words
etymologically related, or are we dealing with three distinct words similar
in sound?

Subject: Zal Kedrova/Sala Kedrowa

I am trying to locate a hall called "Zal Kedrova/Sala Kedrowa," which
appears, without the name of the town, on a concert poster.

According to the poster, composer Leo Tseytlin's wife, Esther Sititskaia,
performed on a concert there Sat, July 22, 1922, and Tseytlin himself may
have played viola. At the time they were living in Vilna, so I have always
assumed that the concert took place there, but a research librarian in
Vilnius who has investigated it thoroughly (and whom I trust) tells me that
there has never been a hall by that name in Vilna. YIVO has no information
about it.

Here are some clues to where the concert may have taken place:

(1) The poster was printed in Vilna, so I assume the concert took place not
far from there, BUT there seems to be no mention of it in the Vilna
newspapers, so maybe it didn't. The posters are small enough (approximately
19 x 24 in.) that they could have been carried easily.

(2) The poster is in two languages, Yiddish and Polish (NOT Russian).

(3) No address is given for the hall; either the city was small enough that
no a ddress was necessary, OR the hall was very well known. A dance followed
the concert.

(4) Tseytlin and his wife were both originally from Pinsk; possibly the
concert took place there.

Private replies, please, to <eisenbak@stthom.edu> unless you think they are
of interest to all. Please excuse multiple postings.

forward questions for discussion.

The symposium is open to all those interested in Yiddish Studies. There is
no conference fee. We do ask participants to register as soon as possible at

Subject: Abraham Plotkin, 1982-1988

A colleague is doing research on Abraham Plotkin, who had worked for a
number of years with the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, and -
we suspect - had written a number of items that appeared in the Jewish Daily
Forward between July 1, 1933 and November 31, 1933.  [We're trying to see if
in fact he did get published there -- they are we believe reports of a trip
he made to Germany in 1932, during which time he interviewed a number of
German trade union leaders, among others.]

He was born in 1892 in Russia, and died in May, 1988 in Los Angeles, CA.

If anyone "here" can help with our search for information on his life [and
death - it would be very helpful if you know of likely places to search for
obituaries] that would be most appreciated.

Subject: Wolf Yunin

I am seeking Yiddish writing by Wolf Yunin (he supposedly wrote Yiddish
songs, and a Hebrew-Yiddish Dictionary), Yossl Birstein (he lived his final
years in Israel), Shomer (he supposedly wrote "shund" material), and
Heschel's analysis at a 1946 symposium of Eastern European Jewish Life.
Also, who wrote the story "Der Alef"?  His first name begins with a B.? and
his last name begins with a B.? (Berkhov?, Borowitz?). If you can direct me
to journals or books where I can find this material, I would appreciate it.
