Subject: Yiddish Festival in Amsterdam, Holland

The second International Yiddish Festival in Amsterdam will be held from
November 24-December 1 1996. We are planning a program with music,
theatre, a storytellingpiece, workshops, films, documentaries,
roundtablediscussions with participants from around the world.

funem 24tn november  bizn 1tn detsember  1996.

Themes of the festival will be: shtetl and ghettoization; revolutionary
movements (e.g. the Bund); yiddish in the world; women and yiddish;
assimilation, a choice?; transformation; future.

temen funem festival veln zayn: dos shtetl un geto; revolutyonere
bawegungen (bundistn, anarchistn); nayes in yidishland; froyen un
yidish; asimilatye; transformatye; tsukunft.

One of the programs that will be developed especially for the festival
wants to show aspects of  yiddish oral culture of 1996 by gathering
stories. Some ten yiddishspeaking storytellers will present them in a
storytelling collage.

yidishredendike dertseyler veln dertseyln mayses vos hobn a shaykhes mit
yidish in undzer tsayt un di temen funem festival.

We are collecting stories related to the themes of the festival. We are
interested in contributions of stories from yiddishspeakers around the
world. -Our interest is not necessarily in existing folktales, but in
new stories, autobiographical or other, that can be told best in
yiddish, orally. Even though we are looking for stories to be told, not
written, we invite you to contribute e-mail stories in writing.

- We are interested in  yiddish stories about life now in different
cities around the world.

- stories in which people tell about their relationship to yiddish
language and culture.

- farvos ir interesirt zikh in der yidisher shprakh un kultur.

- we can imagine that certain 'untranslatable' yiddish words bring up a
story. E.g. the word 'mentsh', 'mitsveh', 'yiches', etc. We are certain
that many other words can be added. We'd be interested in your additions
to this list.

- A program of the festival will be send into space in September.

Subject: Lodzer Yizkor-buch

For predoctoral work at a Parisian university, I am researching and
preparing a monograph (60-100 pages) on the *Lodzer Yizkor-buch*, first
published in New York in December, 1943.

I am eager to hear from any one who can provide information, first-hand
or at some remove, as to the production and distribution of this
memorial book.

Also, I have yet to find any secondary or critical sources which address
this yizkor-buch, nor, in fact, any in-depth analysis of any one
yizkor-buch.  (I except the sensitive and far-ranging presentation of
Itzhok Niborski's and Annette Wieviorka's, because their analysis relies
on exemplary passages from numerous yizkor-bicher.)

If any of you can furnish information or citations -- or whatever
suggestions you think might helpful -- please communicate with me
privately.  Thank you.

Nikki Halpern

P.S.  I have passed on the gratifying remarks about *Tam Tam* to some
staff members.  I agree it's an exciting enterprise.
