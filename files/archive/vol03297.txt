Subject: Migldik

Dovid's statement re: "loy _shomati_ eyno rayo" is on the mark.  However,
I was somewhat disappointed.  I don't see people on the other side of the
argument being convinced.  They might very well say to Dovid: your
statement is no proof that migldik was used by yenem's bobe, either.  The
question is, what do we assume as a null.  The matter would, however, be
comparatively settled if someone could give cites from, say literature of
the last century where 'migldik' was used, or better still evidence of
its use in spoken yiddish.

Subject: Introduction

I come from a Hanseatic Protestant family that established themselves
about 150 years ago in Chile and Peru. My family was very involved in the
Peruvian foreign service, and my grandfather represented the Peruvian
government in Berlin up to World War II; it was there that my father was
exposed to Yiddish.

When I was 14, I discovered Yiddish and have been fascinated with the
language ever since. People tell me I talk like a Litvak, probably
because I learned the pronunciation of the literary standard. I also
speak the stage standard and code-switch a lot back and forth, lemoshl: I
always say "shteytl" instead of shtetl, but I always say "nokh" not nukh.

Anyway, my father would give me samples of words he heard in Berlin. I
pooh poohed his knowledge for the longest time, until I got interested in
Mayrev Yiddish. It turns out that my father was right after all. For
example, in Eastern (standard) Yiddish one says "revekh", and further
South the pronunciation "reyvekh" was common. What my father learned was
"rebakh" (note the b), which I found listed in a Juedisch-Deutsch text.

Mayrev Yiddish is my current passion. Also, we talk a lot about Daytsh-
merizmen; it worked both ways. Mayrev Yiddish crept into Dutch (sjofel =
schoufel, meaning shabby) and into German (akhlen, to eat) and "Juss"
meaning "ten"; the latter must be very old, old enough to have predated
the Highland shift of final t to s.

One final anecdote; my father had an uncle in Germany who spoke fluent
Yiddish. He made up pet names for everyone. My father, now Enrique (we
Hispanicized our names in solidarity with the Allies) was called
Heinrich then, and his uncle called him Henekh; so if I have a Yiddish
name, that's it (though we followed the German Christian minhag lehavdl
of naming kids after their fathers).

I look forward to being a member of Mendele.

Subject: Sources of current "natural" Yiddish

Arre Komar mentions the existing communities that speak Yiddish and
wonder what kinds of Yiddish they use today:

> It is the duty of the academic to go out in the real world to learn
> what is happening out there rather than theorizing in an ivory tower.

If you're looking for source material and do not have an easy entree into
the Chassidic world for field work, there are many cassette tapes
available today, aimed at kids, which you could use for resources. Any
seforim store in Boro Park has them. (Eichler's on 13th Ave. is just one
example.)  The speakers aren't using Yiddish in any self-conscious way --
they're using it to communicate with their target audience.  We have a
number of them (our kids enjoy them). There's a bit of English vocabulary
dropped in, though not an overwhelming amount.  The groups producing the
tapes are, I believe, generally Satmar Chassidim, and the accent (vowel
shifts etc.) is a Southern Yiddish.  Sample titles you could look for
include Der Alef-Bays Velt; Di Mitsve Kaytl; Avremeleh (a series with 4
tapes so far); Ikh Bin Alt Dray Yur.  Of course, the content is generally
religious and mitzvah-oriented.

Our son goes to a Lubavitch cheder, where, ironically, he's one of only 2
boys in a class of 17 who actually speak Yiddish fluently.  But the
teachers use quite a bit of Yiddish in class, and the Lubavitch
pronunciation is, of course, a "Russian" Yiddish. Again, there is
recorded material around which any interested researchers could study.
(Recordings of the Lubavitcher Rebbe might be difficult to work with,
since he uses a vast quantity of Hebrew vocabulary in his talks.  The
"sichos" directed to women more "pure" Yiddish, however.)

Subject: Reflexive periphrastic verbs

A quick shayle concerning Yiddish verbs:
How are reflexive periphrastic verbs conjugated in the present tense.
So, would it be

ikh bin zikh moyde
or
ikh bin moyde zikh

for the verb zikh moyde zayn?
My ear tells me the former, but I am not sure.

Subject: Jewish lists

Last night,l I discovered an E-mail list for Jewish music. It's
apparently a new list, as it seems to have only 20 members so far. But if
people log on and use it, it will grow. The list is called
"jewish-music."

To subscribe, address E-mail to <listserv@israel.nysernet.org>. The
message should say: SUBSCRIBE JEWISH-MUSIC Your Name   . The list address
for posting is <jewish-music@israel.nysernet.org>.

I have been trying to track down and verify all E-mail lists for
classical music, early music, musicology, and ethnomusicology. This is
the only list I have found related to Jewish music. There is a newsgroup,
called "alt.music.jewish"; this list does not appear to be an echo of the
newsgroup. I can't be sure about that, as I am still working on verifying
mailing lists and thus have not had time to check out the newsgroup.

I have discovered what appears to be the "mother lode" of Jewish lists.
When I sent the command LIST to <listserv@israel.nysernet.org>, I got
back a list of about 75 Jewish lists run from that listserv. The message
also included 71 lists run from other srvers, including MENDELE and the
lists at the jerusalem1 system in Israel. Happy hunting!
