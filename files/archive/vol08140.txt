We are seeking the complete words and sheet music for a Yiddish song titled
'Der Dishwasher'

Recollection of 'Der Dishwasher' - 1st stanza & chorus is:
1st stanza:In a restaurant              Chorus:Ich vash
           Hob ich gezeyn                      Mit meyne shvache hent

Subject: nitl -- again

Concerning Marc Sachs posting (08.138):  There are two Jewish "practices"
said to be associated with Christmas Eve--a) fear of venturing out on the
street (hence staying at home), and b) playing cards. Neither is known as
"nitl", the designation for the holiday itself. The word _nitl_ has been
derived, variously, from Latin _(dies) natales_ (Max Weinreich et al.) and
from Hebrew _nitla_ 'the hanged one' (Paul Wexler).

Subject: PARIS AND VIENNA (PARIS UN VYENNE) 

after my recent posting about Elye Bokher's PARIS AND VIENNA, I received
several letters inquiring whether this medieval Yiddish epic was available
in English.  so far:  no.  But I'll be using it in some way in an anthology
of Yiddish fiction from 1382 to the present--which I'm preparing for an
American trade publisher. 
        
at this point I haven't decided how much of PARIS AND VIENNA to use:  a few
chapters or an overall digest of the complete story or....?  I'll also be
using several chapters from E.B.'s BOVVE-BUKH plus a load of other early
Yiddish material--it's quite fascinating..... 
                
Incidentally, if you happen to be in London this coming June, you might want
to catch a British production of my adaptation of Sholom Asch's GOD OF
VENGEANCE.  It's going to be directed by Lawrence Sommers at the Lkhaim
theater.  Take your mom and your granny--the play takes place in a Jewish
brothel and there are a few hot lesbian scenes--the heterosexual parts are a
lot drearier.  take the kids and anyone else you can drum up--I get
royalties.  Take your entire congregation!!!!  let me know how you like it!

P.S. PARIS AND VIENNA was published by Max Niemeyer Verlag, Tu"bingen, 1996.

Subject: 'Pariz un Viene'

I can only share Mr. Neugroschel's recently expressed enthusiasm for the
sixteenth-century Yiddish epic, 'Pariz un Viene' (Mendele 08.138). The
published version of the text which he names, however, is yet another an
example of a long tradition in Germanistic scholarship of treating early
Yiddish simply as disguised, deformed, and debased German that must be
'cleaned up' and published as if Middle High German. 'Pariz un Viene' is
indeed a masterpiece of Yiddish and European and world literature. But
surely Mendele-subscribers need not approach this sixteenth-century Yiddish
text via a late-twentieth-century academic 'translation' into quasi-Middle
High German. The actual, original Yiddish text is available in the 'Israeli
edition' (mentioned but not identified by Mr. Neugroschel), edited by the
masterful scholar of early Yiddish literature, the late Chone Shmeruk (z"l),
'Pariz un Viene,' Jerusalem 1996 (ISBN 965-208-125-6). That's the one to
read. Unless, alas, you prefer your Yiddish disguised, deformed, and debased
as German.

Subject: Pariz un Vyene

As Joachim Neugroschel has already said, Pariz un Vyene/Paris un Wiene is a
wonderful work of older Yiddish literature; it is probably the greatest work
of Renaissance Yiddish literature and simply "a good read". 

I wholeheartedly concur with Joachim Neugroschel on his description of Erika
Timm's "German" edition, but would recommend reading the "German" and the
"Jerusalem" editions next to each other. The "Jerusalem" edition by Khone
Shmeruk and Erika Timm includes the text in Hebrew characters as well as
introductions by professors Shmeruk and Timm and a detailed linguistic
analysis by Erika Timm and Liliane Gehlen (in Hebrew). The "German" edition
by Erika Timm in cooperation with G.A. Beckmann includes a very detailed
introduction (in German), the text in transcription with detailed footnotes,
and glossaries of the Hebrew-Aramaic, Italian (Romance) and Germanic
elements. 

I know that there are many Yiddish enthusiasts who shrink back at the idea
of reading anything in transcription, but these editions are complementary. 
(Timm's linguistic analysis can not be found in the German edition!) 
=46urthermore, reading older Yiddish texts requires a lot of preparation and
the pronunciation requires knowledge of variants of older Yiddish and a
detailed analysis of the text in question, so a transcription is very
helpful. 

The two editions are:  

Erika Timm, ed., Paris un Wiene. Ein jiddischer Stanzenroman des 16. 
Jahrhunderts von (oder aus dem Umkreis von) Elia Levita. Tuebingen: Max
Niemeyer Verlag, 1996. 

Khone Shmeruk and Erika Timm, eds., Pariz un Vyene. Jerusalem: The Israel
Academy of Sciences and Humanities, 1996. 

For those who would like to know what the original looks like there is a
facsimile edition:  Jean Baumgarten, ed., Paris un Viene (Verone, 1594). 
Bologna: Universite di Bologna, 1987. 

I hope many more people will enjoy reading Pariz un Vyene.

Subject: Mikolai GIBS

Shalom,

I typed and posted a poem in Yiddish and its translation to Hebrew, written
by Mikolai GIBS:  http://www.geocities.com/Paris/Rue/4017/GIBSMIK.HTM

It is a poem without a title, which I found in the Yizkor Book of Gombin. 
It was the first poem in the Yiddish part, pages 5 and 6.  It was written in
Warsaw, November 1966. My late father, Meir Holtzman of blessed memory,
translated it at the time to Hebrew.  Is anyone out there who reads
Hebrew/Yiddish is willing to try and translate to a poem in English?

Anybody knows anything about Mikolai GIBS? Who was he? Was he a member/
survivor of the GIPS family from Gombin? Did he write other poems or
literary works in Yiddish?  "Mikolai" looks like the Hebrew name MICHAEL, in
Russian. 

Thanks, Shalom, and happy Pesach to all,

Ada Holtzman

Subject: Bar Mitzvah poem

A request for a poem suitable for a Bar Mitzvah was posted a week or so ago. 
I responded by e-mail directly to the person, but perhaps this is something
of general interest. 

A gut yom tov tzu alemen. 

A poem that I read at the Bar Mitzvah of one my sons (8 years ago) was Aaron
Zeitlin's Zayn A Yid - To Be A Jew. If you'll forgive my transliteration
here it is: 

Zayn a yid heyst eybik loifen tzu got
Afilu az m'iz an antloyfer;
Dervarten tzu hairn a liadeh tog
(afile az m'iz a koyfer)
s'kol fun moshiach's shoyfer.

Zayn a yid heyst nisht kenen aroys fun got
afile az me vil es;
Nisht kenen oyfheren tfileh tzu ton
Afile noch aleh tfiles
Afile noch aleh afiles.

A translation by Robert Friend is:

To Be A Jew

Being a Jew means forever running to God
even if you are His betrayer.
means expecting to hear any day,
even if you are a nay sayer,
the blare of Messiah's horn;

means, even if you wish to,
you cannot escape His snares,
you cannot cease to pray -
even after all the prayers, even after all the "evens."

This may be in Howe, Wisse, Shmeruk's Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish
Verse - I don't remember.

A poem I have read in shul is Leivick's Yom Tov - it references
Passover - and is lovely.  You might think it suitable.  It's on page
753 of Harshav's book.  If you don't have access to that, let me know
and I'll send it to you.

A poem I might have considered was Glatshteyn's  Steal Into the
Prayerbook on page 367 of Harshav.

It actually isn't easy to find one, given the major themes of Yiddish
poetry.

Mazel Tov to you all.
