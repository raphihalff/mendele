[Regarding Neyekh Zide's post Vol 6.195]:

The most useful and useless use of "mauscheln"--in English I'd call it
"to yiddle"--was in Freud's book _The Joke_ (Der Witz).  While this
short opus is a wonderful study of freedom--far beyond what Freud
thought he was doing--it makes the stupidest remarks about Jewish humor.
Regaling the reader with one silly and often vicious "Jewish" joke after
another, Freud never quite realizes that these uncharacteristically
short jokes aren't by Jews, they're by Jew-baiting Germans _about_
Jews--and calling them "Jewish" humor is on the level of describing a
blackface minstrel show as a product of African-American culture.

In German literature, Jews generally yiddle (mauscheln) if the author
dislikes Jews (Raabe), but if he likes them then his Jewish characters
speak a spotless and flawless German (Jean Paul Richter).
German-language fiction does have a few sympathetic Jewish characters
who yiddle, but they are usually peripheral to the plot and quite
stereotypical--even if in a positive way (Doeblin).

Thomas Mann, in some of his early stories, like Blood of the Valsungs,
presents ugly Jewish characters (modeled after his wife's family), who
nevertheless speak pure German.

Arthur Schnitzler, a Viennese Jew (who introduced stream of
consciousness into German literature), usually treated his East European
Jewish characters with sympathy and without condescension, attacking the
anti-Semitism that put Ostjuden on a lower level than German Jews (at
that time "German" also referred to German-speaking Austrians). Thus in
his most famous novella "Fraeulein Else" the title character is
identified sub rosa as a highly assimilated closet Jew  ("No one can
tell because I've got blonde hair, but sometimes you can tell with Mama
because of the way she speaks" (a hint that the mother
yiddels--"mauschelt").

And Stefan Zweig, another Viennese Jew, actually wrote a story about a
Russian-Polish Jew, "Book Mendel" (Der Buechermendel), in which the main
character is a positively treated stereotype.

Kafka never used the word "Jew" in any of his fiction, but his short
story, "A Report to an Academy", which was first published in Martin
Buber's magazine _Der Jude_, allegorizes the assimilation of the Jew
from less than human (the ape's gibberish symbolizes "mauscheln" ) to
human, i.e. speaking correct German.

And Paul Celan, a German-speaking Jewish poet from Czernowitz, wrote one
short story, "Conversation in the Mountains", in which two Jews yiddel
their way through a surrealistic parable that tells us more about the
author's stormy and violent relationship to his own Jewishness and to
Jews.

When the Swiss German playwright, Max Frisch, a Protestant, used a
Polish Jew in his drama _They're Singing Again_ (Jetzt singen sie
wieder), he avoided the entire issue of "yiddling" by having someone
translate the character's lines into Yiddish within the German body of
the play--rather than use an unrealistic pure German for the character
or "insulting" him by having him speak with a Yiddish accent.

The issue of "mauscheln" in German culture is hopelessly complicated,
and I'd rather not get into the "Mauscheljuden" in Germany plays and
movies during the Fascist Era.

The most embarrassing example of "mauscheln" is a mindless development
in today's German culture:  practically every German writer feels
obliged to present a Yiddish word or two in every book--just to show how
tolerant he is.  He'll say something like, "there's a wonderful Yiddish
word that fits this situation"--and he then uses a word that is neither
phonologically nor semantically viable in Yiddish, and is really a
twisted German word.

In other words:  "mauscheln" is in.

As for Gilman on the subject, one should read his _Jewish Self Hatred:
Anti-Semitism and the Secret Language of the Jews_. It's not confined to
a discussion of Kafka.

According to Kluge _Etymologisches Woerterbuch_, _Mauschel_ as a
pejorative for Jew, first appeared in the 1695. He cites from 1622, the
use of _mauscheln_ 'to speak like a Jew'. As its etymology, he offers
the name Mousche, Mausche (= Yiddish _Moyshe_) which had, for a long
time been a disparaging term for the Jewish tradesman.

Note that the late Nicolai Slonimsky, in his Dictionary of Musical
Invective, cites an early 20th century review of a Mahler composition as
_mauscheln_.

In his overview of "Yiddish Studies in the 17th century", Max Weinreich
cites as follows from Johann Christof Wagenseil's _Belehrung des
juedisch-teutschen Red- und Schreibart_, Koenigsberg 1699, which may
actually be a source for Kluge's etymology (I retain the line breaks in
the Weinreich article, I think, and thus probably in the original.):

"Auf gleiche Weise
nennen Sie [i.e.the Jews] ein kleines Kind
Moses benahmt
Moschele
und weilen dieser Nahm unter den Juden sehr gemein
glauben die unberichteten Christen
welche dafuer Mauschel aussprechen
ein jeder Jud heisse Mauschel
oder
das Mauschel
und ein Jud ein Ding sey."

Translation more or less (Joachim/anyone, please feel free to
amend):

"In like manner
they [i.e. the Jews] name a small child
whose name is Moses
Mo(y)shele
and since this name is very common among the Jews
the uneducated Christians believe
that every Jew is called Mauschel [=Moyshl]
or
The Mauschel
and that a Jew is a thing" [object?]

Subject: Mauscheln aka zydlaczenie

With respect to Noyekh Zide's query in the Polish world, there's been a
bit of work done in recent years. A good place to start is Maria
Brzezina, "Polszczyzna Zydow" (The Polish of Jews) (Krakow, 1986). This
600-page volume makes use of written sources from the turn of the
century, revealing a highly-developed genre of popular Polish literature
comparable to the Uncle Remus tales in America. The Polish word for
talking like a Jew is "zydlaczenie." In the interwar period in Poland,
there was a widespread genre of jokes, sketches, monologues of varying
levels of skill and taste, some created by well known poets such as
Julian Tuwim and Antoni Slonimski (both of Jewish origin) based on
zydlaczenie. The genre was known as szmonces (shmontses). Teyku.

Some remarks of a layman, an outsider:

In the first years of this century J.L.Voorzanger and J.E.Polak
collected yiddish words as used in the Netherlands.

They also mention 'maushelen' as a word for speaking yiddish, speaking
as Jews do. They explicitely declare that this word is only used in
Germany and consider it as related to the german word 'maeuschele', a
diminutive of 'mausheh'.

In Germany 'mauscheln' is not only used for speaking yiddish, but also
in a more adverse way: 'speaking indistinctly', and, even worse, in the
sense of 'to traffic', 'to huckster'. Mauschel as a noun is used
mocking: 'yid, kike, sheenie'. I must add that this is what the
dictionary declares, I very often visited Germany and never heard it
there.

In the dutch language, which is often close to German, Mauschel or
mauscheln is not known.

However, I met the name 'Mauschel' once in a dutch zionist-journal of
1916. There it was used to indicate jewish 'Selbsthass' and there was a
reference to Theodor Herzl.

The biography of Herzl, written in german by Alex Bein, ( I do not know
about a translation into english) refers to an essay written by Herzl
after the congress in Basel in 1897 and probably published in 'Die
Welt'. This essay is called "Mauschel" and it described a Jew who does
not care in any way about honour, honour of the Jews. He is an
antizionist, he sneers, he scoffs, he slanders.

Must we conclude that 'mauschel and mauscheln' are use in two ways, one,
just simply in the meaning of a Jew, of speaking yiddish and the other
meaning, an adverse one, used by not-Jews to emphasize supposed bad
properties of the Jew, but also used by Jews to express jewish
Selbsthass ?
