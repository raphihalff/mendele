Subject: Does Vilna still exist?

Dovid Braun's posting about places that have been "wiped off the map"  brings
to mind a recent phone call that I received from an individual who was seeking
to trace one line on her family tree.  She mentioned that her ancestors came
from Vilna, and then told me their unusual surname.  Thanks to Alexander
Beider's indispensable book, "A Dictionary of Jewish Surnames from the Russian
Empire" (Teaneck, NJ:  Avotaynu, 1993), I was able to verify that the name in
question was indeed encountered specifically in Vilna early in the 20th
century.  Her follow-up question:  "Does Vilna still exist?"

A freylekhn peysekh aykh alemen!

Subject: "Tisa-Eslar," by "Professor" Hurwitz

In response to Naomi Fatouros' inquiry (Mendele 07.184), "Professor"  Moyshe
Hurvits (Moses Hurwitz) is mentioned in Nahma Sandrow's history of the Yiddish
theater, "Vagabond Stars," and in David Lifson's book, "The Yiddish Theater in
America."  There is quite an extensive entry on him in the "Leksikon fun
yidishn teater" (Lexicon of the Yiddish theatre), by Zalmen Zilbertsvayg
(Zylbercweig; vol. 1, cols. 591-606).  Hurwitz was one of the pioneering
Yiddish playwrights in America -- a "specialist" in the "shund" (lowbrow)
genre -- and is often paired as such with his contemporary, Yoysef Lateyner
(Joseph Latteiner).

"Professor" Hurwitz was born on February 27, 1844 in Stanislawow (Stanislau,
Stanislav), eastern Galicia (now Ivano-Frankivsk, Ukraine), and according to
Zylbercweig he traced his ancestry to Rabbi Yeshaya Hurvits (the "SHeLaH,"
Prague, 1558- Safed, 1628).  At age 18 Hurwitz left for Iasi, Romania, where
he became a Hebrew teacher.  He subsequently moved to Bucharest, and years
later claimed to have served as professor of geography at Bucharest
University.  However -- again according to Zylbercweig -- it is known that
after having been dismissed as director of a Jewish school in the Romanian
capital Hurwitz converted to Christianity and became a missionary (ostensibly
out of economic motives, though spite may well have played a role, too). 

It was in Bucharest, in the spring of 1877, that Hurwitz encountered Abraham
Goldfaden, who turned down the opportunity to stage a Yiddish play written by
the apostate.  Accordingly, Hurwitz set up shop on his own, in competition
with Goldfaden, and his troupe produced Yiddish plays in Bucharest and
elsewhere in Romania for several years. 

At the end of 1886, Hurwitz emigrated to the United States, and the first play
of his to be produced (at the Roumania Opera House, in New York) was "Tisa
Eslar, oder, Di Farshverung" which he had written while he was still living in
Romania.  The subject of the play was, of course, the notorious blood libel
trial which took place in the Hungarian town of Tiszaeszlar (not Stanislawow!)
in 1882.  Hurwitz also wrote and produced a sequel, "Der Protses in Tisa
Eslar."  According to Yankev (Jacob) Mestel (as noted by Zylbercweig), "Tisa
Eslar" was still being produced as late as 1913, in Iasi. 

"Tisa Eslar," then, marked the American debut of a colorful and controversial
Yiddish theatrical personality.  "Professor" Hurwitz died a pauper in New York
on March 4, 1910.  Scripts of a number of his plays may be found in the YIVO
Archives (Sholem Perlmutter papers, Record Group No. 289, script nos. 333,
333A, 333B, 333C).

Subject: Playwright Moses Horowitz

Moses Horowitz or "Professor" Moyshe Hurwitz as he was often called was born
in 1841 and died in NY in 1910. His play, "Tisa Eslar," produced around 1888,
was indeed one of his most famous plays. It is based on the events around a
then recent blood libel suit in Hungary. It was a 2-part play; one full
evening being devoted to the events leading up to the trial, the second
evening being essentially a court room drama with Hurwitz playing the defense
lawyer. 

Hurwitz was generally regarded as a hackwriter by the NY Jewish intelligentsia
and was held responsible for the "low" state of the Yiddish theater. Some
information about him can be found in Nahma Sandrow, _Vagabond Stars_
(recently reissued). Of particular interest is a contemporary source: 
Hutchins Hapgood, _The Spirit of the Ghetto_ (originally published in 1902)
but republished several times since then. Within the chapter on "The Yiddish
Stage" there is a lengthy description of Hurwitz.  However, most of the
information on Hurwitz is in Yiddish. See B. Gorin, _Di geshikhte fun yidishn
teater_ and Z. Zylberczwaig, _Leksikon fun yidishn teater, Vol. 1

Subject: Ployneste

For some native speakers of Yiddish, the word _ployneste_ (emphasis on first
syllable) can be used to mean 'wife'.  Neither Harkavy nor U. Weinreich
includes the word.  Can someone provide any information about it?

1.  What is the source language of the word?  Slavic?
2.  Is there a masculine meaning 'husband'?

A dank.

Subject: KENTUCKY

Mara Cohen Ioannides (Vol. 07.186) inquires about Schwarz's epic poem
_Kentucky_. If Gertrude Dubrowsky is on this list, she will surely provide you
with chapter & verse. I can only tell you that several decades ago, she
prepared a fine English translation of the poem as part of her doctoral
dissertation for Columbia University's Teachers' College. I'm sure that a copy
is available through University Microfilms.

Subject: "Kentucky"

I am happy to tell you that I translated the whole of I. J. Schwartz's
KENTUCKY and it was published in 1991 by the University of Alabama Press. I
agree with you that it would make a wonderful addition to what is taught re
the American experience for Yiddish speaking immigrants. I have tried to
convince the U. of Alabama that they ought to make a paperback available so
that it is possible to add the book to a student's reading list. Perhaps you
can also speak to the editor, Nicole Mitchell, about it. 

Kentucky is a wonderful example of how the immigrants experienced the America
that stretches far and wide outside of New YorkCity. You have brightened my
day.

Subject: a zisn peysekh

Khaverim, when I wished all of the tayere Mendelyener a zisn peysekh, I didn't
know that I was opening a can of worms, peysekhdik or otherwise. A sheynem
dank to those who have praised this expression, but I cannot claim or accept
any special credit for it. I was merely repeating what I have heard said in my
family since childhood. 

If this turns out to be nisht kosher, so sue me. And what would you prefer, a
bitern peysekh?
