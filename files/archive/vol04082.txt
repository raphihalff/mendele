Subject: "Kitchen Yiddish" I

This is a re-posting because my original message apparently got lost in a
computer scramble.  My note in Vol. 4.081,3 on the same subject should
therefore be considered "Kitchen Yiddish II".

In a recent article in the New Tork Times Magazine (7/31/94) Martha Lear
describes in _The Roots People_ her own search for roots , specifically
her trip to Russia where she traveled to her mother's birthplace in
Stavishche in the Ukraine.

The present population of Stavishche is 9,000, among them 11 aged and
aging Jewish families down from about 4,000 Jews before WW II.  There she
met the chief of the local traffic police who turned out to be a Jew and
who spoke some Yiddish.

She then writes:  "I speak a bit of kitchen Yiddish myself, the hundred
words recalled from a childhood amid my grandmothers."

"Kitchen Yiddish" seems to me is a good descriptive term, defining the
measure and quality of Yiddish that an American-born granddaughter
absorbed from her grandmothers.

Of course, not everyone's "kitchen Yiddish" is the same since a number of
significant variables come into play:  How much, or even how good, was
the Yiddish of the mother or grandmother, that is the supply source; what
was the scale of the inter-generational talkativeness, so to speak; how
attentive was the native grandchild to the, to her ears, foreign sounds;
and what is, or was, the child's aural memory.

For some reason we usually speak of a general, undifferentiated memory.
We say, for instance, he or she has a good memory.  But when it comes to
language, as is the case with many Mendelyaner who try to transcribe the
remembered Yiddish sounds of their childhood, one may wonder whether or
not there is a differentiated range in the aural memory factor.

Subject: Kitchen Yiddish

Zellig Bach asks: Where did grandsons learn Yiddish?

I have two answers that apply to me and certainly others.  When I was a
child, all of my adult relatives could speak Yiddish. Although my
American-born mishpokhe, and those who came to the U.S. at an early age,
also spoke relatively unaccented New York English, they easily switched
from one language to another, either to make a point, to conceal from
eavesdropping kids, or just azoy.

When relatives spoke to those whose English was more of an effort,
Yiddish was simply a more comfortable choice.  So there was always
Yiddish to be heard at family gatherings, which seemed to occur almost
weekly when I was young.  However, the primary language was still
English.

Second, I was lucky enough to have my grandmother living with us for
about ten years.  Born in northern Poland, she came to NY in the early
part of the century as an adult, and lived first in the Lower East Side
and then Brooklyn.  Ver hot gedarft lernen oder reden English in aza ort?
To my recollection, my parents spoke to her in either language.  We kids
spoke to her in gradually- absorbed gemutchete Yiddish; she replied in
either Yiddish or broken Yiddish/English.  The need to communicate with
her probably drove us to develop at least a working knowledge of the
language, not to mention the classic incentive of understanding the
Secret Conversations of Grownups.

As a 10-year old talking to an octogenarian grandmother, did we discuss
Peretz and Glatshteyn and Opatashu?  Aza narishe kashe. Did we have
high-level philosophical discussions on Bundists vs. Zionists,
Yiddishists vs. Haskalists, or even on fine points of halakha or minhag?
Avade nisht.  Our conversations were those of kids talking about simple
matters to their grandparents.  We discussed school, friends, the
weather, Kennedy ("a sheyner mentsh, khotch er iz a Katoliker yingl") vs.
Nixon ("a momzer"), "Eddie Solomon" (whom you may know by his TV name, Ed
Sullivan -- my grandmother thought he was Jewish).

As a result, my conversational Yiddish never advanced beyond the
rudimentary level needed for those conversations - "kitchen Yiddish," if
you will.  As I grew older, Yiddish gradually disappeared from my life as
the Yiddish speakers in my family died.  Only as an adult did I discover
the real secrets that Yiddish was hiding: the joy of reading Sholem
Aleikhem or Zinger in the original!!!  Although the few survivors from my
parents generation (now in their seventies and eighties) once spoke
Yiddish as their first language, none has retained more than a passive
understanding and a marginal interest in Yiddish.  For my family tree, if
I don't help to keep Yiddish alive, no one will.

Subject: New Yiddish language & culture bulletin

Dear Friends,

The Congress for Jewish Culture is about to initiate a regularly
published bulletin in Yiddish and English dedicated to the field of
Yiddish language and culture.  The purpose of the bulletin is to gather
and disseminate news and information about Yiddish language and culture
in America and internationally to both speakers and non-speakers of
Yiddish. We hope that this bulletin will serve as an informational
clearinghouse in a manner and breadth not available in any other single
publication.

The bulletin will cover literature, media, computers, language
instruction material and programs, e-mail, services, conferences, as well
as performances, meetings, events and activities sponsored by various
groups and organizations around the world.  This bulletin should be
useful to all lovers of Yiddish, whether the interest be of an
ideological, popular, or academic nature.

We plan to publish this bi-lingual bulletin quarterly in print and
monthly by electronic e-mail (in English).  The print bulletin will be
sent out to our mailing list and to anyone who requests it at no cost at
this time.  The on-line publishing on internet and BBS's will be local
and international, requiring only a phone and modem connection. Detailed
information about this will soon follow.

We ask that all organizations, groups, colleges, synagogues, community
centers, performers, and teachers involved in Yiddish language and
culture send us information about your present and future programs,
activities, classes, products, and services on a regular basis and we
will include as much of it as possible.  You may fax us anytime at
212-473-5102, or call me at 212-505-8040 from 10:30-4:30 P.M. on
Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. We believe that this bulletin will be
useful to all those interested in the field of Yiddish language and
culture.

Thank you,

Mit khaverishe grusn,

Reyzl Kalifowicz-Waletzky
