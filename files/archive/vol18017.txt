Subject: Luftmensch in Max Nordau's writing

Can anyone provide the citation for the original writing in which Max
Nordau first used and defined the term "Luftmensch"? Also, did he ever
write anything else on the subject?

I'll appreciate any help.

Subject: yolop

To reply to my friend Al Grand's query: Harkavy's Yiddish-English-Yiddish
dictionary, 22nd edition (undated, but the 11th edition was 1910), defines
"yolop" as "clumsy big fellow." His 1928 Yiddish-English-Hebrew dictionary
adds: blockhead, fool. Immediately following and referred to the "yolop"
entry is "yolopatron," which might shed some light on the etymology. I'm
sure the Mendelyaner who know about such things will inform us all.

This is a Ukrainian word meaning a stupid person, a blockhead, an idiot
etc.

Subject: yolop

In reply to Al Grand, Harkavy's Yiddish-English-Hebrew dictionary has for
yolop "clumsy big fellow; blockhead, fool." According to Stanislawski's
Polish-English dictionary, jolop in Polish means a blockhead, a dolt.

Martin Jacobs

[Editor's note: a similar response was received from Vincent Homolka, who
points also to Niborksi's Yiddish-French dictionary. Stephen Berr notes
that "yold" has a similar meaning.]

Subject: yolop

Harkavy glosses yolop as "clumsy big fellow; blockhead, fool." The source
is presumably Ukrainian iolop [YOlop] meaning fool, although similar terms
exist in Belarusian (Î´lup [YOlup] (and Russian underworld slang - elop).

Subject: plotke

I know what "plotke-makher" means - trouble maker - but would like to know
if "plotke" is Yiddish, Polish or Russian.

Many thanks,

Subject: ashlekh

Weinreich translates scallions (spring onions) as "ashlekh." Is there any
evidence for this usage?

By what name(s) are scallions known in Yiddish?
