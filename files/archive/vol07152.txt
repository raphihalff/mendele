Subject: a frage vegn Lemberg

Miriam Isaacs in 07.150:4 asks about the expression: Na'n (9) tug inter
Lemberik. I never heard that one before, but I grew up with an expression that
is its fraternal twin: gey dray (3) mayl inter'n oyvn.  (Go three miles under
the oven.)

It was a put down that my mother used when I would be particularly persistent
in pestering her for something to do or somewhere to go. As I recall, she
would say this when my pleas for attention were egregiously ill-timed, as when
she was preparing dinner. In those days in the Bronx our gas range stood on
four porcelained metal legs and one could actually crawl under it. But I'm
quite sure that fact has no bearing on the origin of the expression.

Subject: "Lebn Zol di Unyen"

Bay undz hot men gezogt, "Ikh zol azoy nit visn fun keyn tsories/shlekhts
vi ikh veys nit vos er vil/ dos iz., meaning, literally,  I shouldn't
know from any troubles/evil, like I don't know what that is.  In other
words it reflected one's ignorance of whatever was being discussed.

Iker shakhakhti:  I remember a pro-Garment Workers' Union song that was
sung to the melody of "Lebn Zol Kolumbus."  This one was called "Lebn Zol
di Unyen."  Does it sound familiar to any Mendelyaner; or could anyone
tell me where I might find it?  The first few lines are "Lebn zol di
unyen, di arbeter tsuzamen, lebn zol di unyen, zi farbesert undzer lage. 
Mir shayder, koter, preser un apreyter, Mir fayfn af zey ale, Di boses,
di fareyter.

Subject: Swiss Yiddish

Thanks to Vivian Aldridge for his generous statement.  Swiss Yiddish, and
non-Eastern Yiddish generally, is indeed a topic worth study, and full of
subtopics which have not been adequately studied to date, so that it is very
much a living, open field.  Although I keep criticizing incorrect and
uninformed claims in Yiddish linguistics made by all too many Mendele
subscribers on a regular basis, I have said before and I would like to say
again that the amount that we know with something approaching certainty in
this area (and in most other areas of Yiddish linguistics)  is TINY compared
to what we do not know--or compared to the situation in the linguistics of
other languages.  Yiddish has really been very poorly served by linguistics to
date.  This of course makes it all the more startling when the few things we
do know are routinely contradicted by people who are proud of not knowing
anything about diphthongs etc.  But let me conclude on a positive note-- and a
challenge: if friend Aldridge or anyone else does want to find out how Yiddish
linguistics actually is done, please get in touch with me.  Although I have
been seriously ill and do little at the moment, I would be happy to show and
discuss some of my own work or that of other Yiddish linguists.

Subject: Mayse

Dan Gilman asks: "Why do non-literate speakers think that "mayse" is
pronounced "maynse?" 

I hope friend Friedlander and others will not mind if as a linguist working on
Yiddish I answer the question. 

The question is not quite rightly posed.  Many Yiddish dialects do have a
nasal sound of some kind in this word and indeed in a whole family of words
like it (see below).  This is probably more commonly a nasalization of the
vowel or diphtong than a separate nasal consonant, I think, but in any case
there is no doubt that it is a nasal sound.  But some dialects lack the nasal
sound, and Standard Yiddish happens to be based on this kind of dialect. 

Incidntally, there is nothing mysterious or strage about this difference.  All
dialects and related languages exhibit complex but regular correspondences
between their sounds.  I think we just recently had some discussion of
dialects which regularly have word-initial i- where most Yiddish dialects have
yi-, for example.  It is the existence of such patterns of correspondnce which
is the main reason we can figuer out the prehistory of a language.  The
reconstruction of the earlier stages of the language is based on comparing teh
different dialects and reasoning as follows: 

If one dialect has id 'Jew' as well as iberlebn 'to experience' both with i-,
but another has yid vs. iberlebn, we automatically tend to hypothesize that
the latter presevers the original state of affairs, and the the former
underwent a change of yi- to i-.  If we then find that related words in
languages related to Yiddish, e.g., German or Dutch, have the same distinction
(German Jude vs. u"berleben), then our hypothesis becomes a certainty. 

(I am overismplifying slightly, and I have to cuation that this is NOT the
ONLY kind of reasonng we use, but basically this is the kind of excample we
would start a class in linguistic reconstruction with.) 

The same applies to the question of the nasal in mayse.  There is no question
that the nasal pronunciation is the older. 

Finally, we should note that most of the words which have a nasal /ay~/, /aa~/
or /ayn/, /aan/ in some dialects but /ay/ in others are of Hebrew origin and
involve a sequence of /a/ vowel followed by an ayin or sometimes alef or he,
and no Hebrew nasal of any kind.  These words include dayge, maykhl, and a few
others.  I have also proposed (in work that remains to be published, inasmuch
as I have been too ill to finish it) that words such as shayle and mayrev,
which don't have a nasal in any modern dialect, had one originally. 

As for the spelling, these words, like all Yiddish words of recognizably
Hebrew origin, are spelled as in Hebrew and not in accordance with the
pronunciation anyway.  The only non-Hebrew-origin word which is widely
attested with this correspondence is mayster, but its history is one of those
many still-open problems of Yiddish linguistics as far as I know. 

I hope this helps.

From: Hugh Denman <uclhhfd@ucl.ac.uk>
Subject: mayses/maynses/ma(:)nses

With reference to Dan Gilman's enquiry [07.151:3], ma(:)ses is not alone. 
Take for example 'bansher', 'shmontses', 'yandes', 'daynge' with their varying
degrees of geographical extension as well as the ubiquitous 'Yankev'. But
haven't we been over this ground before? In any case, an exhaustive answer is
probably not currently possible. Suffice it to reflect how 'ma'asah' is
pronounced by oriental Jews and then ask oneself why 'evil eye' in
Judaeo-Italian should be 'ngain-oreng'.

Subject: mayses/maynses

In Vol: 07.151, Dan Gilman asks about mayses v maynses.  I am a speaker of the
Litvak dialect of Yiddish which has no 'n' in ' mayses', but my friend Chaim
Pevner, whoo speaks a Voliner dialect of Yiddish, says 'maynse'. He quoted
other words which had this variation.  On his return to London, I will ask him
to write to Mendele on this topic, if it hasn't been resolved in the meantime.

Subject: Mayse or maynse?

Apropos of Dan Gilman's (7.151, 3) question: Why do non-literate speakers
think that "mayse" is pronounced "maynse"?  Naturally, being Jewish, I respond
with a question:  Why do perfectly literate speakers think that "Lech Walesa" 
is pronounced "Lech Walensa"? 

I heard only "maynse" in childhood, never "mayse".  (Polish influence?)  My
parents were literate.  I and my family come from Kishinev, Rumania at the
time, Moldova now, but basically it is in the Ukraine, once part of Poland. 
There is also a history of Ottoman Empire influence. 

Louis Fridhandler

[Moderator's note: The mayse/manse topic has been discussed in Mendele several
years ago, c.f. vol3.112, vol3.266, vol3.308, vol3.319.  -i.v.]
