Subject: Introduction and a couple of questions

Hello!

First, I would like to introduce myself.

My name is Emil Jelstrup and I am from Kobenhavn
(Copenhagen), Denmark. I am 16 years old (was born in
1987) and a high school student. At the moment I'm
learning German and Russian.
Among my biggest interests are linguistics in general
and Central-/Eastern European culture and languages.
Yiddish, as well as the history and life of Jews in
general is also one of my interests - but I'm still
struggling to learn the alef-bejs (as I have very
little time to do it).

I also have a couple of Yiddish-related questions:

"Vodovoznik": The first one is the word "vodovoznik"
(or "wodowosnik" with German translitteration) - a
water carrier. It occurs in the fourth stanza of the
song "In shtetl Nikolajev" (available at
http://www.aufwindmusik.de/t-awek-e.htm) by David
Medoff.
The word seems to consist of three Slavic morphemes:
"vodo-" (meaning "water-"), "voz-" (equiv. to Russian
"vozit'" of "vesti" - "to come with") and "-nik".
Is the word well known in Yiddish and does it exist
(and if it is - is it then frequently used) in Russian
or any other Slavic languages?

[ei]- and [ai]-diphthongs: The other is about
diphthongs in Middle High German (MHG), Yiddish and
Standard High German (SHG): I have for a long time
wondered why some words with the diphthong [ai] in SHG
in Yiddish have the diphthong [ei] (which doesn't seem
to exist in SHG) and others have [ai] in Yiddish. What
was the original MHG form - and did [ei]/[ai] exist in
that langauge?

Regards,
Emil Jelstrup

Subject: Maladovsky's "Efnt dem toyer"

Re Leonard Prager's discussion of Kadye's "Der daytsh yemakh shmoy," (TMR, vol
7 no. 11) it is interesting to note that the poem appears in my edition of the
book,"Yidishe kinder," directly before a poem called "Pitkhu et ha sha'ar," a
translation of her original Yiddish poem, "Efnt dem toyer," taken from the
book "Mayselekh," published in Warsaw, 1931. Given Kadye's broad background,
"efnt dem toyer," may be understood in terms of appreciation of her Jewish
heritage ("di goldene keyt") and might allude to the Biblical and liturgical
passage,a request to open the gates of justice so that the righteous might
pass through them (psalm 118 as found in the Hallel). I have been told by
Israelis, however, that the translated and well-known version of this poem,
put to music, is a staple of an Israeli child's repetoire and is understood to
refer to the ingathering of the Jewish people into the land of Israel as a
part of the Zionist enterprise. Given the confluence of the facts that the
current collection is published in 1946 by the Jewish Folk Schools of the
Jewish National Workers Alliance and Poale Zion, and that the 1931 poem is
published in its Hebrew translation and taken from the Kibbutz Ha'meukhad
version of the book, that there is an ideological component to the
juxtaposition of these two poems in this collection. It is not clear,however,
that any editorial decisions were made by Kadye herself beyond her giving
permission for the publication of her work, as many of the books published for
use by the schools were edited by committees of educators.

Subject: Rubin Berkovici

I am sending you a request by my friend Miriam Yahil-Wax:

"Rubin Berkovici from Botosani (or environs) Romania, was head of a Yiddish
troupe around the 1900's. His wife, Surika Berkovici, was an actress in that
troupe. They travelled between Russia and Romania. I have postcards with their
photographs, in Yiddish, from 1903-4. At that time they were in Romania. The
story is that Surika (Sarah) was an established actress and he an aspiring
teenager who fell in love with her, when her original group (Polish?) visited
Botosani. Then he joined her, she put him through theatre school in Poland and
he founded his own company.

I am looking for any reference to them, individually, or to their theatre ,
either in Russian or Romanian documents."


Please answer directly to Dr. Miriam Yahil-Wax myahil@isdn.net.il

a shaynem dank,

Sabine Cohn

Subject: deyzhe borsht

Several of us wonder about the term "deyzhe borsht" listed as one of the
characters in Sholem Aleykhem's tiny piece "Az Got Vil, Shist a Bezem." We
know a deyzhe was a trough-like thing for kneading bread. Harkavy gives
"deyzhe-borshtsh" as "a dish of leavened dough." At first I thought the term
must mean something like a bread starter like sourdough starter these days but
then realized this is implausible because the story takes place Erev Peysakh
and the piece is set in the pantry and esp. on the Passover shelf. A "dish of
leavened dough" would have made everything treyf for Passover. It's only in
the list of characters that it is listed as "deyzhe borsht." Within the little
story when it speaks it is called just "borsht." The following is the
interchange in the middle of the piece:

Matses: Tsikave beytsim! Mir lign do fun nokh purim on. Shmalts: Fun nokh
purim? A tayere metsie! Ikh shtey nokh fun far khanike. Borsht: Un mikh hot
men do avekgeshtelt bald nokh sukes. S'iz mir shoyn azoy umetik, az ikh hob,
dakht mir, gekhapt a shiml.

  Thanks for any help in explaining this.

Subject: Polin v. 16 on Jewish popular culture

This is to announce the publication of volume 16 of the annual Polin: Studies
in Polish Jewry, edited by Michael Steinlauf and Antony Polonsky. This issue
is devoted to Jewish popular culture in Poland and its afterlife. The volume
include studies of klezmer musicians, recorded music, theater, badkhonim
(wedding entertainers), popular literature and press, postcards, workers'
libraries, political cartoons, the Jewish underworld, as well as contemporary
phenomena such as the trade in Polish wooden figurines of Jews, the Krakow
Jewish culture festival, the music of Wolf Krakowski, the canonization of
Roman Vishniac. There are also several new studies of Polish-Jewish relations
and a large book review section. The volume is available from the Littman

Subject: Camp Nailand

I'm still looking for information about a summer camp called "Nailand" or
"Nayland." Leo Zeitlin (1884-1930), the composer whose works I am editing for
publication, wrote a short piece for piano and percussion dedicated to the
camp.

I now know, from Fradle Pomerantz Freidenreich, that it was a Yiddish-speaking
Workmen's Circle (Arbeter Ring) camp, and that it existed in Gillette, NJ,
from 1928 until at least 1930.

Fradle has asked YIVO about it and has checked with Workmen's Circle; neither
has any information. I have been in touch with the Rutgers archives, the
Jewish Historical Society of MetroWest, and several other NJ historical
societies.

Does anyone recognize the name of the camp? Is there anyone reading the list
who is old enough to have attended the camp?

Any and all leads welcome. Private replies to
<eisenbak@stthom.edu>
please, unless you think they
might be of interest to the group.

PUBLIC SPEAKERS SOUGHT FOR LOCAL I. B. SINGER CENTENNIAL EVENTS

The Library of America, with support from the National Endowment for the
Humanities, is sponsoring the 2004 centennial celebration for Isaac Bashevis
Singer. Produced in partnership with cultural institutions nationwide and with
the support of the Estate of Isaac Bashevis Singer, "Assimilating America: The
Life and Stories of Isaac Bashevis Singer" will feature diverse humanities
events and activities.

In conjunction with the American Library Association, dozens of local
libraries will host lectures, readings, and panels. The sponsors of the
Centennial celebration are now compiling a nationwide Speakers' Bureau of
scholars and writers who might be willing to make themselves available for
these local events. Doctoral candidates with a knowledge of Singer's work are
also welcome to participate. (All arrangements--honorarium, travel, etc.--for
such programs will be made directly between the inviting institution and the
speaker.)

Other activities for the centennial celebration include:

* An authoritative 3-volume Library of America edition of Singer's collected
stories * A major museum exhibition of Singer manuscripts, letters, and other
materials, curated by the Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin
and mounted in New York, Florida, and Massachusetts * Gala public tributes in
New York City, Los Angeles, and South Florida * A coordinating Web site
(Singer100.org)
