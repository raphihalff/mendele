Subject: Steinlauf lecture

Five years ago, our fellow Mendelyaner Michael Steinlauf gave a
fascinating and insightful lecture at Gratz College, where he was then
employed, about the revival of Jewish memory in Poland. Recently Michael
gave me a copy of that talk. I liked it so much that I posted it, with
his permission, on the Web. Interested khaverim armed with browsers may
check it out at this address:

Subject: Transcribed Yiddish into Yiddish letters

The effect of putting one's thoughts into writing and of submitting them
to the criticisms of others is quite amazing, and that is even before
the criticisms start coming in!

I had been thinking for quite a time about the fact that the the writing
system used for the majority of Yiddish words (those of Germanic-Slavic
origin) is pretty "phonetic", that is to say that there is a close
correspondence between the written letters and the spoken sounds and
that this should enable a computer program to be devised which would
translate, into Yiddish letters, Yiddish transcribed into English
letters (as we read all the time on Mendele). That would be as long as a
uniform system of transcription were used. I recently submitted a rather
long-winded posting to Mendele concerning this.

It has now become clear to me that my idea was hopelessly
over-optimistic. Such a computer program could hardly be expected to
know, for instance, that a word such as "farrikhtn" contains a double
letter reysh. Or that "kind" (a child) though written with a final
letter daled is prounouced with a final "t" sound. Yiddish spelling is
just not _that_ "phonetic" (or phonemic). I don't think that of any
language is.

And then there is the problem of the Hebrew-Aramaic words.

Of course it is possible to accurately tranliterate a Yiddish text into
English letters. And of course a standardized system of writing Yiddish
in "Latin" letters could be derived but that would mean Yiddish learners
having to come to grips with two different standard ways of writing the
language. What I had in mind was something quite different---somebody
who perhaps does not know the Yiddish alphabet at all being able to
unworriedly write the language in English letters as he or she hears it,
its being then automatically turned into "correct" Yiddish spelling by
computer.

The problem of the trouble-free transmission of Yiddish and Hebrew over
the internet remains to be solved (I seem to remember that there is now
a mailing list devoted to this topic for Yiddish). I naively thought
that I was suggesting a solution for Yiddish which would could co-exist
with the sort of transcribed Yiddish used on Mendele. How wrong can you
get!

Subject: Yiddish literature of Czernowitz

I am collecting materials for the electronic exhibition on World Wide
Web with the working title "Jewish Czernowitz: People and Books". The
exhibition will focus on cultural history of the city, language
situation, biographical and bibliographical information about writers,
poets, artists, and scholars who lived and/or worked in Czernowitz. The
exhibition will be "hosted" by Shtetl
(http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/shtetl.html).

Currently my list of Yiddish authors with the "strong" Czernowitz
connections include (spelling according to the Library of Congress Name
Authority File): Moishe Altman, Shlomo Bickel, Nathan Birnbaum,
M.H.Breitman, Iosif Burg, Shimshon Ferst, Muni Fried, Jakow Frydman,
Meir Harats, Hirsch Leib Kazber (Vainshtein), Joseph Kissman, Gershon
Kizshner, Moshe Krinitz, Chaim Lecker, A.Y.Lobel, Itzik Manger, Hayim
Melamud, Itzhak Panner, Mordkhe Schaechter, Bella Schaechter-Gottesman,
Ikhil Shraibman, Nokhum Shtif, Eliezer Steinbarg, Jacob Sternberg, Lobel
Taubes, Josif Trachtenberg, Kubi Vol, Ruth Wisse.

I would greatly appreciate any additions to this list and any hints
about non-obvious sources of biobibliographical data (especially about
lesser known authors and about publications in periodicals).

Although Czernowitz German-Jewish literature (Rosa Auslander, Paul
Celan, Alfred Gong, Alfred Kittner, Alfred Margul-Sperber, Zelma
Meerbaum, Immanuel Weissglas, and many other) is documented much better,
I would be grateful for any interesting information, particularly about
German-Yiddish literary relations.

Other relevant information would be welcomed as well.
