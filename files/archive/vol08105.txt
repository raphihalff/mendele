Subject: Abraham Karpinowitz

This is in response to a recent inquiry about the Yiddish author Abraham
Karpinowitz.

Karpinowitz has been a resident of Tel Aviv for about half a century. 
He is the author of numerous books, nearly all related to the place of his
birth, Vilna.  In my own library there are five such volumes:
--Tzu Foos Kain Eretz Yisrael
--Oif Vilner Vegn
--Vilna Mein Vilna
--Geven Geven Amol Vilna
--Di Geshichte fun Vilner Ger Tzedek, Graf Valentin Patocski - a beautiful
volume in content, typography and appearance.

Karpinowitz has been chairman of the World Council for Yiddish Culture, is a
leader of the Yiddish Writers Union and is a lecturer at the annual one
month Yiddish seminars in Russia, sponsored by the World Council for Yiddish
Culture. Some of his books are available at Peretz Publishing House, 14
Brenner St., Tel Aviv

Subject: standard Yiddish vs. the dialects

Mr Neugroschel is absolutely correct when he compares the insistence of
using dialect Yiddish over standard Yiddish to one insisting on Liverpudlian
or Mancunian English over the standard language. As to what standard Yiddish
is, Reb Joachim suggests that the rule books lie with YIVO and to make his
point adds that most Yiddish writers wrote in standard Yiddish. 

So far so good. But my question is when exactly were these rules formulated
and when did these writers write. Perhaps a further analogy with English
would be of assistance. The Concise Oxford Dictionary, first published in
1911, is now in its ninth or tenth edition; Fowler's Modern English Usage,
first published in 1926, is now in its third edition. This seems to suggest
that English, far from being a standard language with a set of rules for all
times, is, to the contrary, constantly in flux. 

Yiddish, on the other hand, has its Wienreich dictionary first published in
1968 and is still in its first edition. This suggests that either Yiddish is
frozen in time, as indeed it may be in some circles, and so is in no need
for an updated version, or, as some 'squawkers' may suggest, the self
proclaimed guardians of Yiddish either wilfully ignore or are ignorantly
oblivious to large communities for whom Yiddish is, like any other spoken
language, in a constant state of change. 

It is the same with Yiddish writers. Most of the Yiddish authors wrote at
the turn of the century and in the inter war period. Relying on them for a
standard is no different than relying on Victorian writers for a current
English standard. They may be useful guides for many aspects of Yiddish but
they are pretty useless for the state Yiddish is currently in.

Subject: a lid

Owing to a recent career change I am occasionally forced to leave home early
and return home late (and spend less time on mendele!). 

My brother, teasingly, faxed me the following lid which I thought would be
nice to share with you. 

ikh hob a klaynm yingele

Does someone have details on the author?

Subject: Mazepevke-Kasrilevke substitutions and translation problems

In The Mendele Review (TMR) 2.034, 3, Leah Krikun provided a transcription
of A Gebentsht Land, a letter from Menakhem-Mendl to Sholem Aleichem.  (If
you have not read it yet, go read it, you'll like it!)  Pains were taken to
pinpoint some textual differences between the version printed in Fargesene
Bletlekh, FB, (Kiev, 1939) and Menakhem-Mendl, MM (Tel-Aviv, 1976). 
However, at the first instance of the word, Kasrilevke, there is no mention
in TMR of the fact that Kasrilevke is _NOT_ mentioned in FB.  As a matter of
fact, Kasrilevke is nowhere to be found as well in the version printed in
Sovetish Heymland in 1969.  This clearly indicates that Kasrilevke was
absent in the original text. 

Most of the textual differences seem to me to be trivial, and fail to
justify the statement in that issue, "...neither is a completely
satisfactory text for the translator."  On the other hand, the absence of
Kasrilevke is not trivial, and assumes major significance when combined with
other facts about Menakhem- Mendl's home town.  In 1892, in Kol Mevaser Tsu
Der Yidisher Folks-bibliotek, Menakhem-Mendl writes home to Sheyne-Sheyndl
in Mazepevke.  I have seen a copy of that publication with corrections made
in Sholem Aleichem's handwriting.  No changes are evident with regard to
Mazepevke.  Those changes appeared in the 1910 compilation of the
Menakhem-Mendl letters, the so-called "canonized"  version.  There,
Mazepevke was replaced by Kasrilevke when Sholem Aleichem was still alive. 

Looking at versions of Menakhem-Mendl letters published before the 1910
compilation, it is very clear that Menakhem-Mendl stems from Mazepevke, not
Kasrilevke.  Even Tevye's Golde comes from Mazepevke, despite that fact that
it was changed to Kasrilevke for the Folksfond Oysgabe.  Since that edition
was published posthumously, we may suspect that Golde's change of home town
may not have been authorized by Sholem Aleichem.  My impression is that
Kasrilevke, being more famous and popular, was considered to offer better
commercial prospects.  In my opinion, that change and other such changes in
other works were artistically infelicitous. 

The nature of the fictional town colors the nature of the fictional
inhabitants, and deeply influences how the author intended for us to
understand a character.  Mazepevke has a most unpleasant air about it. 
Kasrilevke, on the other hand, while it is poverty-stricken and its citizens
must cope with tragedies at times, the people are warm (mostly), helpful,
optimistic and resilient.  Kasrilevke seems to be a place to which one might
want to return to be among buoyant neighbors.  In one piece, Sholem Aleichem
describes Mazepevke as a heap of garbage.  Who would want to return there? 
Is that why Menakhem-Mendl starts to return, but repeatedly gets intercepted
by some fly-by-night deal?  Is it that he does not want to go back to dreary
Mazepevke?  If so, it is understandable. 

In MM Kasrilevke is added, but Mazepevke is retained.  Elsewhere, Mazepevke
is simply removed to be replaced by Kasrilevke.  In light of that, I sum up:
The important changes for the translator are not the kind of minor changes
detailed in TMR 2.034, 3, but in the addition of Kasrilevke in MM which
reflects the substitutions of Mazepevke by Kasrilevke in accessible versions
of Menakhem-Mendl.  Even if Sholem Aleichem himself authorized those
changes, the translator may have to allow for the influence of commercial
over the artistic interests of the author.  Kasrilevke was famous and
beloved by readers while Mazepevke was not.  It is, of course, exceedingly
presumptuous of a translator to overrule the author's judgment, but in this
case, I think Sholem Aleichem (or surrogate) made a mistake if he authorized
some of these changes.  Mazepevke as home town is, I think, truer to Sholem
Aleichem's concept of the nature and enduring identity of Menakhem-Mendl. 

Whenever you think you appreciate the complexity of the translators'
problems, you bump into other complexities.  Here's what I think: Each and
every translation is a work in progress.  Just look at some serviceable
English translations of a generation or so ago.  There are some defects due
to errors in understanding the original, but most other defects have only to
do with changes in the English language itself, and NOT with any defect in
the translator's understanding of Yiddish, or his/her English rendering of
the original Yiddish.  As English changes, new translations may be needed. 
This notion, if correct, poses a hard reality that is not an encouraging
thought for a translator. 

[For more about shtetl names, see my article, "Place Names and Their Meaning
in Sholem-Aleykhem's Work" in The Three Great Classic Writers of Modern
Yiddish Literature, Vol. II, Sholem-Aleykhem, ed. Zuckerman and Herbst,
1994, p. 30.]

Subject: Yiddish Music of Birobidzhan

Birobidzhan - Zionist Utopia or Soviet Hoax?

We visited the Ziff Jewish Museum of Florida to view a controversial
exhibit, "Stalin's Forgotten Zion: Birobidzhan and the Making of a Jewish
Homeland"  which comes here from the Judah L. Magnes Museum in Berkeley, CA
(with the Historical Museum of the Jewish Autonomous Region, Russia). 

The Dlugatsh posters of stalwart, happy farmers, the enlarged photos of
heroic Halutzim with hoes in hand, the imposing schoolhouse with Yiddish
signs, stirred childhood memories of a world in Yiddish. One older cousin of
mine was a farhitste IWO linke and used to teach us songs about Birobidzhan
as she described this 'homeland' and tried to raise funds to send there. 

One song kept reverberating in my mind, and softly, I sang my cousin
Tillie's song, "Dortn in Sovyetnland in dem land dem frayen, boyen zikh di
Yidelakh a lebn gor a nayem...." 

The docent, excited, saying she never heard songs from that era, wanted to
call the curator to have it taped and added to the exhibit. Since I am no
Adrienne Cooper, I promised to try to get a pianist and a shtikl chorus to
tape some songs for the exhibit. 

So - helft - where can we find music, and the songs of Birobidzhan? 

Amazing fact: 200,000 people today live in Birobidzhan of which a handful
are Jews. There still exists a Yiddish newspaper, and a synagogue (it looked
huge)  that they share with the Seventh Day Adventists. 

If the exhibit travels your way, it's certainly worth viewing.

Subject: Shtetl house

Hello!  

My name is Alla Sokolova. I am a researcher from Petersburg Jewish
University (Russia). I study architecture of traditional Jewish houses in
former shtetls of Podolia (Ukraine). Every summer (beginning with 1989)  I
undertake expeditions to former shtetls in Podolia where I do my field
studies. The results of my studies were published in a 7 articles. Among
them I would like to mention two articles written in English: A Study of the
Architecture of the Ancient Jewish Towns of Eastern Podolia, Including the
Graphic Reconstruction of a Typical Jewish Market Street of the Beginning of
the 19th Century // Research Support Scheme Network Chronicle, No. 2. Prague
1995, pp. 10 - 12;  Architectural Space of the Shtetl-Street-House //
Trumah, No. 7. Berlin 1998, pp. 51 - 85.

I would like to ask a number of questions to the scholars who study Yiddish.
Each room in the typical set of rooms in traditional shtetl house has its
own name in Yiddish. I am interested in the following matters:
- when did these names appeared in Yiddish language;
- what was the geneses of these words.
Here is the list of Yiddish names of some rooms in traditional Jewish house:
Zol' - a kind of a sitting room,
Uz - a stable,
Bashke - a basement of the house
Anfur - a hallway through the house (Have you got any evidence that this
word was also used for the name of an inn in the shtetl?).
Gonek - a gallery in front of the house facade (Are there any other names
for the gallery in Yiddish?) .

I know that there is a special name for the building which is being a block
of two houses. These two houses may contain two sets of rooms adjoining each
other along the central axis of the building. May be you know the name of
this building?

I shall be very grateful for any help in this matter,

Alla Sokolova

From: nmiller@mail.cc.trincoll.edu
Subject: A Yiddishist of the far left 

A long and interesting article in the January 4 issue of the Paris newspaper
_Liberation_ is centered around the career of the man who in his time was
responsible for printing a great many legal as well as clandestine tracts
for the far left.  His name was Joseph Schachter.  Born in Moldavia, he was
a founder of the Romanian Communist Party before emigrating to France in
1937.  He played a crucial role for the French resistance during the war,
being responsible for turning out _L'Humanite_ as well as other work.  After
the war he became involved with French Trotzkyists. He died in 1992 at the
age of 86. 

None of which would merit mention in Mendele except for this: among the
products of his printery was at least one book in Yiddish.  No further
details.  But I'm intrigued and perhaps others too might want to know more
about a man who printed much of the ultra-left student broadsides of the
70's while publishing at least one Yiddish book and who in his last years
was working on a history of the Jews. Perhaps our French Mendelists have
more information.

This may seem an odd enquiry but a member of a local Jewish theater is
seeking a Yiddish translation of "Porgy & Bess". I thought I had once read a
posting about such a thing. Can anyone help?
