Subject: Dan Leeson

Dan Leeson had a "moderate" heart attack last Friday night.

According to his wife, Rosanne, he is now doing very well and will be
home from the hospital in a week to ten days.

She is printing-out peoples' email messages to him and bringing them to
the hospital.  So, if any of you would like to send him a message, be
assured that he will read it.

The address is:

         leeson@admin.fhda.edu

Subject: Shyster

Judith Klavans at Columbia recommended I contact you in regards to my
search on the derivation of the word "shyster".  I have heard that it is
yiddish in origin, while others have said it is german.  I was wondering
if you could shed any light on this.

Your help and advise would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks,

Geralyn Flood

Subject: Al tiro avdi Yaakov

With the help of a couple of young expatriate Russian friends of mine, I
have made substantial headway in decoding this brief
Hebrew-Yiddish-Russian-Ukranian macaronic folk song.

One phrase is still a complete mystery. If anyone recognizes the sounds
of these few words, in context, I'd love to hear.

Here is the context:

   Omar adoynoy l'Yaakov    God said to Jacob (Hebrew),
   Ya, tatye, Ya            "My little-father" (Ukranian)
   Otsokh niere tsugi zogt  .... .... .... said,   (Yiddish?)
    "Al tiro avdi Yaakov"   "Fear not, my servant, Jacob" (Hebrew)
   ne boyus', ne             "I fear not, I fear no one
     kogo ne veryu ne komy    I believe in
     tol'ko bogy odnomy       no one but in God alone." (Russian)

The phrase "otsokh niere tsugi" is a complete mystery: My guess is that
it is Yiddish of some form, but (but for one) I neither recognize the
words nor can find anything like them in Weinreich or Harkavy. The
stresses are on OTsokh NYEre tsuGI (so it's not 'tsugezogt'), nye is the
sound of "nyet", which is distinctively Slavic non-Yiddish, but my
Ukranian/Russian speakers can make no sense of it.

Can anybody help?

Thanks
Bernard S. Greenberg

Subject: _Konin: A Quest_

A dank Dovid Herskovic for his masterful review and recommendation.
Mendele may have discovered the Edmund Wilson of the new  generation.
Dovid's intensity and talent with words made his interest contagious,
and I sped to the library for the book. Here, in goles, the closest
thing to Konin in the computer listing is Kon-tiki.

I would appreciate the name, rank, and serial number of the publisher. A
dank faroys.

Mendele seems a wonderful avenue for book reviews of this type of
material which touch at the heart of Yiddishkeit, albeit they are in
English.

Happy Independence Day,

Subject: _Tam-Tam_

A hearty second to Khayem Bochner's comments re: _Tam Tam_. As a Yiddish
"onheyber," I found the articles just about right for my skills --
readable with about 6 "Weinreichs" (trips to the verterbukh)  per
paragraph.

As for PDF, it's agonizingly slow but, I have to say, worth the wait.
Only the first issue didn't load properly (perhaps they'll repost it). I
did find, after printing issue 5 out on 8 x 11 paper, that it was much
more legible after I'd enlarged it to a legal-sized (8 x 14) sheet on a
xerox.

The question is, will the publishers continue to distribute future
issues freely this way? Or was this just a teaser offer, with
subscriptions required in future? I found nothing on  the "Gefi'l"
website to answer this question.

Finally, has anyone considered a joint venture between Mendele and this
organization, aimed at creating or distributing timely, lively Yiddish
literary and educational material over the Web? Sounds like an
opportunity for someone ...

Subject: _Tam-Tam_

I am one of the main complainers about pdf. It turns out that the three
psf-files on _Tam-Tam_ are not standard pdf.

I downloaded them and tried to display them with ghostscript, which
supposedly reads pdf, but I just get a list of errors.

My Unix (Linux -- a free and widespread paltform) is not supported,
neither is HP-UX on MC68040 machines nor NeXTStep on NeXT machines.

The alternative would be to reboot my ThinkPad in DOS, start up Windows,
use Lotus's Acroread, and discover perhaps that the files are
unreadable.

I had some correspondence about this with the person in France
responsible.

A shod az men ken es nit leyenen!

A gris far ale mendelyaner,

Meinhard E. Mayer

[Technical discussions are important but perhaps they belong in a
separate mailing.  Unless there are strenuous objections from Mendelistn
such posts will in future be bundled separately.  nm]
