Subject: alt-modish

Yude-Leyb Proger:

        I betcha the spelling _alte-modish_ in Mod. Heb. is
somebody's confusion of _alt-modish_ 'old-fashioned' with
_alte moyd_ 'old maid'.  Is the use of _alt(e)-modish_ in
Mod. Heb. widespread, or is it just in the article you
cited?

"Jew"  and "to Jew" and its equivalents in a number of
other languages, are frequently not "nice" words. I doubt
that the reasons have anything to do with their linguistic
structure. "dervay" l "in the meantime".   "vayl"
'because'. English "while" = Yiddish "beshas".

Did my message to Bob Goldberg concerning "Lasche" get
through to you? I seem to have missed it if it did.

Mikhl.

Subject: p.s. on 'enjoy!'

i neglected to mention what i think is the yiddish
influence in intransitive 'enjoy!'--the 'missing direct
object'. this is standard in yiddish for *any* transitive
verb when the object is salient in the physical or
linguistic context and, to a lesser degree, is found in
'yinglish', a dialect of jews of yiddish background, e.g.
'i'm making popcorn--you want?', as opposed to standard
english '... you want some?' for some reason, 'enjoy!',
with the object missing (and usually salient in the
physical context, the speaker having just served it to the
hearer), is, i believe, originally one of these yinglish
usages but it has, for some reason, swept the country and
become quite standard, as a sort of idiom. (i say 'idiom',
since it's only used in the imperative, e.g. you still
can't say in standard english 'i ordered a prime rib and i
enjoyed.')

In addition, English has a pejorative use of the word Jew
as in 'to jew down'; on the other hand, we have 'to welsh
on (a bet)', but Welsh is used nevertheless to refer to
something/someone from Wales.

With respect to the very interesting analysis of Herzog's
on why Yiddish speakers may be more into (folk?) etymology
than other language speakers, here's another observation.
 
I was listening to a gemore shier yesterday and the blat in
question discussed why dror meant freedom and the
explanation given was that it came from the word 'dar'= to
reside; a free person can reside where he chooses. This is
not an isolated instance; the gemore does that all over the
place. In Eastern Europe, a Jew (not a Jewish person) would
have been exposed to such etymologizing through his gemore
study; and even if he himself (or she herself) did not
lern, magidim would have exposed him/her to such
etymologizing.  Would not such preoccupation with exegesis
be another explanation for the Jewish predilection for
etymologizing?

Mark David writes in #161:

The same goes for "Yentl".  The characters in the film would
have all been speaking Yiddish all the time.  Yet when Yentl
(Barbra Streisand) is being fitted for her khosn's suit the
day before the wedding, the tailors speak with a strong Yiddish
accent.  (I don't remember whether her father, at the beginning of
the film, and other characters, are also given Yiddish accents.
The tailors are on the soundtrack, which I listen to occasionally.)

What's more, they use classic Yiddish-in-English expressions, which
I suppose Yude-Leyb would call ludicization: "You got trouble with
the pents." "What's wrong with the pants?" "You'll find out ven
you go, excuse me, to relieve yourself."

And, to digress somwehat, where does the interpolation of
"excuse me" *before* a reference to a "dirty" subject come from?
I've heard it in English, from Yiddish speakers, but not in Yiddish.
What's the Yiddish form?

Subject: klafte
 
i glimpsed at the reply on ENJOY -- which I still believe
to have entererd General English via Jewish English from
Yiddish -- and it is certainly true that I am not exactly
up on what has been happening to  English in the USA.

-- i have an immediate problem -- i was called from a local
paper and asked to say something about the origin of
_klafte_ , which in Israeli Hebrew is not as strong as
bitch -- there is a variant _kelevte_, on the pattern  of
_khaznte_, etc. that raises no problems -- but where does
/klafte/ come from? the /f/ before /t/ is no problem, but
where is the pasach from.

in 1910 Golumb (p. 188) suggested the word is from H.
_kalba_ (which is 'bitch' in the straight and figurative
senses) or _kalvito_ which I don't know.  in the next few
hours i will try to learn something about this, but in the
meantime perhaps mikhl herzog or others could give some
etymological first aid -- does the atlas have anything to
say on _klafte_?  is is known in Western Yiddish?  when
does it first appear in EY? i know a 110 year old text
where the writer uses _kalbe_ for 'bitch'.
