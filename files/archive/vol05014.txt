Subject: Introduction

I'm an assistant professor of chemistry at the University of Richmond.  I
am a non Yiddish speaker (or reader) except at the level of expertise one
can obtain from the scholarly work of Leo Rosten.  However, in recent
years I have been reading heavily in many areas of Judaica.  Mendele came
to my attention when I put a request on Koach for the words for Rozhinkes
mit Mandlen so I could sing it to my (now 5 week old, then unborn)
daughter.  I have since been a passive member, but have enjoyed the
correspondence.

By the way many thanks to the people who helped me with my request.  I am
now the proud owner of two yiddish songbooks.  Interestingly of the three
versions of Rozhinkes mit Mandlen that I now have, two are riddled with
either melodic or harmonic errors.  Alas that the Klezmer Conservatory
Orchestra, with thier impeccable taste, have never published a songbook.

Subject: "di dEr"

Yeder eyner veys as "di" in      Everyone knows that in Yiddish
yidish iz der bashtimter         "di" is the definite article of
artikl far vayblekhe             feminine nouns,
substantivn, un "der" iz der     and "der" the
bashtimter artikl far            definite  article of
menlekhe substantivn.            masculine  nouns.

Ober s'iz do a fal ven           But there is a case where
beyde artiklen tsuzamen          both these articles together
formirn a gramatish              form a grammatically
rikhtikn zats.  Vi kumt es?      correct sentence. How come?

"Der" iz  a substantiv, a        "Der" is a noun formation
derivirte forme funem verb       derived from the Yiddish verb
darn-- "to wither"-- un meynt,   "darn" --to wither--,  and means,
men zol derfun nit visn,         one shouldn't know from it,
TB, comsumption.                 TB, consumption.

Nu,"der", in dem zinen, iz       "Der," in this sense, is
gramatish vayblekh, azoy         grammatically feminine,
az "di dEr" iz corect.           therefore "di dEr" is correct.

Nokhamol, mir zoln zayn          Again, we should be kept
opgesheydt fun dem, omey'n!      away from it, amen!

Subject: Tsar Nikolay

Meyshe-Yankl Sweet requested the words to the bawdy Yiddish-Russian song
celebrating the Czar (yimakh shmoy) and his German whore.

Well, it's a dirty job, but somebody's got to do it!

Here goes:

        Tsar' Nikolai, ebi tvoyu mat'!
        Mit vemen, mit vemen, hostu khasene gehat?
        A kurve, a blate [blyate ?], an oysgetrente shmate!

Subject: Tsar Nikolai

Meyshe-Yankl Sweet probably assumes that I was being coy with my offer to
send the obscene text only to those requesting it. Actually, I had in
mind people like his uncle, who might find the text offensive.  There is
also something to be said for using obscenities sparingly, so as to
preserve their power for when they are needed.  Since obscenities are
powerful, I suspect, only in one's native language, I will observe my
first principle by reminding native speakers of Yiddish or Russian of
their option to read no further in this posting and will honor my second
principle by following the venerable philological tradition of providing
glosses in Latin.

Here, as requested, is the text that I learned in graduate school:

	Tsar Nikolayke, eb [yop] tvoiu mat',
	zey nor mit vemen du host khasene gehat:
	a kurve a nase, an oysgetrente shmate.
	Tsar Nikolayke, eb tvoiu mat'.

The precise meaning of the Russian "mother oath" is a matter of some
scholarly disagreement.  The verb is in the past tense but has no subject
and is ambiguous as to person.  Many have assumed that the missing
subject is first person ('ego matrem tuam futui'), but Alexander Isacenko
argued, based on an account by the Austrian diplomat Baron Sigmund de
Herberstein, who was in Moscow in the early 16th century, that the oath,
like a contemporary Hungarian one, originally had the noun _pes_ 'dog' as
its subject, i.e., 'canis matrem tuam futuit.'

As I wrote in my earlier posting, the Yiddish text is sung to the same
melody as one of the most popular Russian revolutionary songs of 1905.  I
neglected to add that the melody (by Ia. F. Prigozhii) was popular before
that with the words of the poet Ivan Nikitin ("Ekhal na iarmarku
ukhar'-kupets..."), so it's conceivable that the Yiddish text originally
mentioned Alexander and not Nikolai.

Subject: Shleyer lid

I joined this list because I was curious about a song my mother tried to
recall some time ago when I was interviewing her on tape. I suspect it's
a children's song.  I'd be grateful for the complete lyrics & translation
&, if possible, the melody.  I transcribed what I heard, but please
excuse my lack of knowledge of Yiddish.

  Oy gevalt a gonif
  Hot er mir beganvit  (_or_ altich mit beganvit)
  Er rotich(s) mir tzi genime
  alles fin de stig
  Du vist keishl fin di eier in de bubbe's alte schleier. (schleie?)
     (shleyer?)

My mother said that women wore "shleyers"  before sheytels were
fashionable. I thought it might be a head scarf, but I'm told that the
translation is mantle or veil.

Thanks for any help.
