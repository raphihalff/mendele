Tayere Mendelistn--

I'm under the impression that "lernen" can mean either to TEACH or to
LEARN. I'm unaware of another word that would distinguish the two
activities. If this is an accurate observation, would someone in the know
explain this conflation. As a teacher, I find it interesting to consider
how languages/cultures view the relationship between teaching and learning.

Subject: suppletion in verb inflection

I am writing my dissertation on suppletion in verb inflection (the typical
is example for this is _go_ in the present, _went_ in past, that is the use
of two different morphological stems in one and the same paradigm). One of
the goals is to provide a broad database showing the distribution of this
phenomenon in the languages of the world, both on the synchronic and
diachronic levels. I have a short online questionnaire which I would like
filled out by people who are either native speakers or specialists in
particular languages.

Subject: Mezinke Tantz

Rifka Wein notes that she has been told this dance in part celebrates the
parents' "good fortune" in having married off their youngest child and so
being relieved of a major life-cycle responsibility.  At the same time, I
have heard songs that reflect the 'empty nest' in a very poignant manner: 
for eg. Drey Tekhterlekh (by M. Gebirtig?), where the singer is moved by
seeing the mezinkele's empty clothes cupboard-armoir (klederschank) and
comments on how still the house has become.  There also are, of course,
examples of songs that celebrate the end of this part of the life-cycle. 
I'm not near any of my music ref.books, so can only recall the one that has
the refrain: "di mezinke oysgegeben, di mezinke oysgegeben".  My own
understanding of the word is that mezinke refers to the youngest daughter.

Subject: ZICH or ZAKH

[zikh], [zekh], [zkh], [zakh]--regional variants--are all spelled as _zikh_
in Yiddish letters. For many, _zikh_ is simply a "spelling pronunciation".

Subject: zikh, zakh, and mikh

Al Grand raises an interesting isue with ZIKH and ZAKH---but that gives rise
to yet another question: whatever happened to ther first person reflexive
MIKH, or was it NEVER applied in Yiddish as it was in German?

Subject: zikh/ zakh

With reference to Al Grand's query [08.145:6], I think it may for once be
said that the answer is fairly straightforward. For etymological reasons
'zikh' is spelled 'zikh' in standard Yiddish. However, a general phonetic
rule operates in Yiddish requiring vowel lowering* before khof, khes and
reysh. Hence the pronunciation (in all normal, i.e. non-stilted) situations
is [ZAKH]. This being so, many people spell 'zakh', because this is what
they hear. However, the correct spelling remains 'zikh'.
{* 'lowering' means that the tongue is lowered in the mouth. The same
effect is achieved if the jaw is opened further.}
