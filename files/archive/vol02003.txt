Subject: Reb Shlemiel revisited

When I introduced myself to Mendele, I mentioned my current
interest, the origins of Shlemiel and Shlimmazal, with the
hope that I would get some reactions from other Mendelists.
Especially, because the earliest use of these words that I
could find, is from 1784.

Now David Sherman was kind enough to ask about it,so I can
give it a second try. (1.238 item 1)

(1) Shlemiel from Shlumiel ben Tsurishadday

This is the most well known explanation, based on Heine's
poem "Jehuda Halevi". I. Tabak points out (Judaic lore in
Heine p. 153) that Heine misinterprets his sources. It is
indeed an ingenious "Khap", but cannot be the origin of the
word. So we are left with the following possibilities: a.
there was another person named Shlumiel, who is responsible
for this word. b. the word is of German origin, c. or the
word is a combination of Hebrew words (shelomi El, etc.)

(2) Shlimazal from schlecht + mazal

First of all, your computer mistyped the word, probably
because it is not PC compatible. The word is not schlecht,
but the in meaning identical schlimm. This is indeed the
most frequently given explanation (see Weinreich, e.g. or
Dov Noy in the Enc. Jud. v. "Folklore") The question is,
since when does mazal mean luck? This leads us to a very
difficult conceptual problem, the history of the
philosophical category "Chance". Other explanations exist
for schlimmasal from the German. They are also mentioned in
Weinreich's History of the Yiddish, in a very awkward way
(see index).

(3) Of course, words are only words. The real question is,
did these characters really exist? If so, was it a separate
category in society, such as batlanim, letsim, meshugoim,
etc.? And if so, what was specifically Jewish about them?

For even more info you have to wait until I get all my
thoughts organized.

Subject: A query and an announcement

Sherri Calvo asks whether there is a Yiddish primer
that's less tough going than Weinreich's.  Replies
can be sent to:

    CALVO@NSSDCA.GSFC.NASA.GOV

or to Mendele.

*********************

The Workmen's Circle has just announced its schedule of
summer activities: ten programs that will interest
Mendele's readers (several speakers are themselves
Mendelnikes).  Everything takes place at Circle Lodge

York City.  Accomodations are available at reasonable rates
for A.R. members and non-members.

Here are some of the programs.

one of these summertime extravaganzas?

To: M.-N. Eytan

  "Should we, as Jews, admire... "

I believe it is a wrong question.  One can only ask in this
context:

  "Should I, as a human beings..."

Let's not pretend that it is only our(?) problem.  And
could there be a COLLECTIVE(?) response?  Who is going to
enforce it?  Everyone has to answer this question
individually.  Of course, I reserve the right not to shake
a particular hand, but that is my individual solution.


To S. Feldman

My impression is that the easiest and the least expensive
way would be to subscribe to Compuserve (it has a gateway
to the Academic Net).

From: ROBERT.ROTHSTEIN@SLAVIC.umass.edu
Subject: Syntactic problems

    The syntax of the first stanza of the _Internatsional_,
which has puzzled Seymour Axelrod and Eli Katz, is not as
bad as it seems: Shteyt oyf, ir ale ver, vi shklafn in
hunger lebn muz, in noyt... [note the corrected version:
IN NOYT, not UN NOYT]

        Arise, all ye who like slaves
        Must live in hunger, in need...

In English _who_ can be singular or plural ('he who
lives...' vs. 'they who live...'); in Yiddish _ver_ seems
to be grammatically singular even when the reference is to
a plurality.  Thus the singular verb form _muz_ rather than
the plural _muzn_.

I would translate "like a wet noodle" (or lukshen, if you
prefer.) [Noodle is a moderately Yidlish word.]

To khalesh is from the Hebrew (hello Yitzchak Kertesz)
khalash = weak, and means to faint; also, khalesh tzu means
be itching for, dying for (Weinreich), in the sense, I
imagine,  of fainting away with need (a rather genteel -
no, not gentile - image.)
