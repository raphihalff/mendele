Subject: Tsadik

I suspect that the Yiddish "tsadik" vs Hebrew "tsadi" derives
ultimately from the practice of reciting (while learning) the
alphabet.  Progressing through the alphabet from alef to sof a speaker
encountered the juncture "...tsadi kuf...".  Under influence of the
word "tsadik" this was reinterpreted as "tsadik kuf", and the
"mistake" was generalized.  A similar phenomenon accounts for certain
variations in the names of numbers in some Indo-European languages.

Subject: Yiddish and Yiddishkayt

I believe most Jews (including me) foster and depend on pluralism so
that the religious and the secular can coexist comfortably.  This
certainly suggests that Yiddishkayt includes both.  In fact, Yiddish
literature often represents a secular attitude, even when dealing with
the religious tradition as subject matter.  Example: In my view,
Peretz was respectful toward the religious tradition but emphasizing
the value of earthly deeds in his powerful story _Oyb Nisht Nokh
Hekher_.  You'll recall how a skeptical Litvak secretly followed the
adored rebe, a tsadik, to see if, as claimed by his khosidim, he
actually went up to heaven each morning.  The skeptic became a devoted
follower (a heyser khosid) when he discovered that the tsadik chopped
firewood to save the life of a widow alone in a freezing shack.  That,
for the skeptic, was going even higher than heaven.  I think Peretz
was expressing the Judaic valuation of practical deeds.  In effect,
saying, Do it [whatever it is] for life, l'khayim.  Raboysay, be
mentshen; feet on the ground, work hard.  Above all, be mentshen.

Subject: Yeshivish

I haven't yet seen "Forverts" of 21 February (my copy takes 5-6 weeks
to reach me), so I don't know who is responsible for this piece of
instant folklore, but even in the Purim season it does seem a little
churlish not to make it clear that the quotation in question [6,255:7]
is originally taken from: Chaim M. Weiser, "Frumspeak, The First
Dictionary of Yeshivish", Northvale, NJ-London: Jason Aronson Inc.,
1995, 108pp., [ISBN: 1-56821-614-9] L19.99, a work which is more
scholarly and useful than its somewhat facetious title implies.
Despite solecisms (e.g. the hoary misconception that Slavicisms in
Yiddish are derived from Russian and the like) the author, who teaches
English in an American yeshive, has some linguistic sophistication and
most readers stand to learn much not only about "yeshivish", i.e.
English laced with Yiddishisms and Hebraisms as spoken in yeshives in
English-speaking countries, but also, with a little extrapolation,
about the equivalent registers of Yiddish itself, so that Weiser's
book can serve as yet another minor supplement to the inadequate
dictionaries with which Yiddishists are condemned to work.

Subject: _Yidishe Shprikhverter_

Unfortunately, the very nicely produced 1983 version of Bernstein's
"Yudisher Shprikhverter" is expurgated of many of the wonderful
scatological and sexual sayings found in the original.  The 1908
edition can still be obtained, xeroxed, from a research firm in
Israel. I don't have the address handy, but can get it;  if anyone is
interested, e-mail me privately.

Subject: Sholem Aleichem in Harlem

I certainly defer to L. Fridhandler's expert knowledge of Sholem
Aleichem's life and times [6.255].  I have no time to consult any
records, but I believe it was in a past issue of Mendele that I read
of Sholem Aleichem's living in Harlem and his funeral being at a
synagogue on 116th street near his home.  The Lenox Avenue address
Fridhandler gives would be close to 116th Street, as Lenox began at
110th Street.  I'm sorry if I conveyed incorrect information.

The point I was making, however, involved the fact that lower Harlem
(from 110th street at the northern end of Central Park to 135th
street) was not an area of black concentration until some time after
World War I.

Instead it was in good measure Jewish so that blacks and Jews became
neighbors and the basis for cultural exchange existed.  The fact that
Sholem Aleichem lived there at all was an illustration of that.  Our
good shames, to keep things from wandering too much, asked me to omit
some things from my comment on yiddish singing in a black "race film."
One of those things was the fact that my mother lived with her older
sister in East Harlem, c.122nd street, when she first came to the U.S.
in 1922. I could also mention that as late as c.1948-1950, when I was
a student at CCNY, I went with a class-mate to his father's clothing
store on E. 125 Street near Third Avenue.  This "Jewish" store where
the clerks still all spoke Yiddish had been in the family for over 30
years
