Subject: Pi pa po

The Brockhaus "Deutsches Woerterbuch" has "pipapo" <adv> 'and so on' and
"Pipapo" <noun> 'the (unnecessary) rest' like in 'marches, parades and
Pipapo'. They also note that the derivation of the word is unknown.

For me (an Austrian) it feels like a definite (north)German expression,
and I can only remember reading it at the end of a list in the
combination 'etcetera pipapo'.

Subject: Pi, pa, po

Considering how little response there's been on this business, I guess I
should share some of my early memories, which I always thought were
totally unique. My father, who worked a one-man business in the NY
garment center in the 1950s and 60s, had the part-time help of a
shipping clerk named Alexander Schindler. Alex, a short broad Jew with
thick eyeglasses and an extraordinary full head of dark hair parted on
the side like a schoolboy, worked vi a ferd at least 12 hours a day.
Alex had a reputation for being intensely nuts as well as for giving
ridiculously disproportionate amounts of his pay for tsedoke. Like most
of the other adults I knew, he was a Holocaust survivor.  Whenever as a
kid I visited the grungy warehouse of the laundry supply business where
he worked (my father had a desk in the corner), Alex made quite an
impression, not the least of which was his incessant refrain, repeated
hundreds of times a day with dread finality in his varshever loshn as he
shlepped huge laundry bags over his shoulder: Pee-pah-poo! Asta la vista
la furtse la granda!

Subject: Pi, Pa, Po

The origin of Pi, Pa, Po is so obvious that I'm surprised other
Mendelniks haven't thought of it:  It comes from Ping, Pang, and Pong,
the three shmendriks in Turandot.  Turandot was, of course, a Khazar
queen before Puccini patschket around with the story, which was first
written in Mame Loshn, and told about the conversion of that great
kingdom to Yiddishkeit. The three riddles were easily solved by the
hero, Kalaf (whose name was derived from the Hebrew word for "scroll"),
a renowned Torah scholar and soyfer.  You can read the whole story of
how Kalaf converted Turandot and her whole kingdom in the Kuzari.  Ping,
Pang, and Pong were among the first to jump into the mikveh.

Subject: "shm-"

i found zellig bach's comment about the belittling quality of the prefix
"shm-" (6.065) most amusing.it recalled to me the quite disparate use of
prefix "s-" in so-called supersymmetric theories in particle physics.
there, all particles,e.g.,electron, quark, neutrino, etc.,are purported
to have a supersymmetric counterpart, much heavier than the ordinary
one, and obeying an alternate kind of statistics (i.e., fermions become
bosons and vice versa). these supersymmetric particles are then called
selectron, squark, sneutrino, etc. their possible existence is taken
quite seriously, and experimentalists have been searching for them, but
thus far there is no evidence for them that i know of. of course, here
the "s-" must clearly derive from "supersymmetric", although at first
glance it does look like some kind of joke.

i wonder if the use of "shm-" might have evolved from "shmendrik", or
perhaps from one of a few other words of a derogatory nature.

Subject: Hebrew e-mail

Do you know about this?  I've only tried it a little bit, but it seems
really nice, once you get it figured out.  It should work decently with
Yiddish, too.  If you don't have Eudora you can get it free from the
net.

On the other hand, if you have used this already, what do you think?

Taken from Brigada for 14 Sep 96:

      send and receive email in hebrew! -- chris istrati (capable
      moderator for brigada-peoples) sent along a tip this week that at
      <http://www.hevanet.com/dshivers/mikhtav>, developers have pulled
      together "mikhtav," hebrew for the word "letter." the site
      apparently includes discussions about topics of israeli jewish
      interest in hebrew using hebrew letters, instead of latin
      transliteration.  the site contains all of the software utilities
      that you will need to communicate on the list -- downloadable
      software for macintosh, pc or unix shell accounts.
