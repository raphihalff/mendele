Subject:  La Shiksa

According to my trusty Argentine informant (a porten~a of fine
Galician lineage --  her parents are from the region that gave birth
to such notables as Generalisimo Francisco Franco, yimakh shemo
ve-zikhro, so that makes her a gallega and not a galitsyanerin), the
word "shiksa" has entered Buenos Aires slang among the twenty- and
thirty-something generation as a term for "maid" or "housekeeper."
She reports that it was not that current a generation ago.  Perhaps
it has merely spread from middle- class Argentine Jewish speech into
more general usage, in ways familiar to speakers of American English
who casually employ various Yiddishisms.

To: P. Mett concerning "Koylech (or koyletsh)"

1. > My recollection is that koylech is used only for a -large-
   > loaf. Can anyone confirm?

What is the definition of large? Does this mean larger than a loaf
of bread? I think the difference is in the ingredients, namely that
koyletch had eggs, raisins, and (in Poland) a little sugar.

2. The notion of the twelve khales goes back to the Arizal.
(Artscroll transcription) He had this concept of the Shabbat table
resembling the Temple, and therefore had 12 (smaller) khales at his
meal, just like the bread that the kohanim used to place on the
table of the Temple in Jerusalem. This then became the custom of
generations of Cabbalists, and was subsequently adopted by many
khasidim.

3. Western Yiddish did not use "khale" in the sense of a loaf of
bread/koyletsh, they called it "barches". This word has as many
etymologies as "cholent". On the Jewish end there is the Biblical
verse "birchas H' ta'ashir", and the proof is that some people
called it "Daasher/taasher". On the non-Jewish end scholars mention
a certain ritual bread from the German tribal traditions called
"Berchesbrot/perchesbrot". And there are many variations on these
two themes, conveniently summarized by Herman Pollack in: 'Jewish
folkways in Germanic lands.' MIT Press, 1971. Western Yiddish used
"khale" in the Biblical sense, namely to refer to the small piece
that gets separated from the dough before baking.

Subject: Re: Amish German and Yiddish

Living here in Amish country, I can testify that our Yiddish
speaking friend has no trouble talking to the Amish in their own
language.  They regard her as a relative.  On the other hand, a
speaker of standard German tried to talk to them in German and they
refused.

We have old order Amish here.  No resorts.  Just farms.

> Chicago last week and passed a new Jaguar with the license plate
> SHIXSA. Deep sociological implications ?

For what it's worth, we have MMLSHN (Ontario).  At the National
Yiddish Book Center's summer program in Massachussetts last week,
there was a ZAMLER from New Jersey in evidence.  (For those who
don't know, a zamler ("collector") is a person who collects old
Yiddish books for the NYBC.)

Anyone else have Yiddish-related plates?

Subject: re jaguars

One might guess that the Jag was given to the lady, not that she is
boasting, not necessarily, that is, and by whom?  (Cf my Short
story in SIREN SONGS, titled "Aeaea," in the book published in
November 1992, by McPherson & Co.) It reminds me of a convertible
Mercedes that some lady drives on Sunset Boulevard, in Brentwood,
with the plate: I KVELL.  I used to think of pulling alongside, and
asking her if she had the first model with real leather, and not
human leather.  No bottom to the abyss of vulgarity.  And if you want
cornbread, with or without caraway seeds, there is plenty to be had
in LA, of course, not as dense as what the Bronx had in my
childhood, where the loaf weighed 5 pounds and was a foot in
diameter if not more, and one could ask for a half loaf cut off, and
sliced, or even a viertel cornbread.
