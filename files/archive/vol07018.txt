Subject: Let's read something modern!

Having read Sholem Berger's letter "Vos vert ibergezetst from Yiddish into 
English?" ( Mendele Vol. 7.015) I decided it was about time to put "Sholem 
Aleikhem" aside (for a while) and start reading something modern.

During my last visit to Israel I went to the 'I.L. Perets' book shop and 
asked the 'moykher sforim' for advice: What to read? So he sold me a work 
by Sholem Aleikhem. I asked him again, whether he had something more modern. 
I ended up buying several books by modern authors I had never heard of and 
whose names don't figure in the 'Mendele' archives. One of them: Zwi Kanar. 
His latest book: 'Bread for Bread' appeared only last year and contains three 
longish short stories or short novels. The title story "opgegebn broyt", is 
about 90 pages.

Are there any 'Mendelist out there that would like to read it with me? If 
there are enough people one could think about making a collective translation 
into English or of making an Romanised edition with a wordlist and notes.

I have read the first ten pages and it is not light reading. It appears to be 
autobiographic and the author spend 3 years in camps. I did transliterate the 
first few pages and will be happy to E-mail the text to people who would like 
to consider my proposal.( I trust the author will overlook this breach of the 
copyright laws - if anything comes of it his permission will have to be 
obtained).

If the work of typing out the text and/or translating can be shared, 'Mendele' 
might be willing to publish it in 'feuilleton' form.

Claus Buryn.

Subject: Yiddish textbook advice 

My Yiddish, as imperfect as it is, (I come from a Yiddish-speaking home, 
studied Yiddish on college level intermittently, corresponded in Yiddish 
with my parents for almost thirty- five years) is sufficient for teaching 
my wife.  The Arbeter Ring's catalog lists a number of teaching materials.  
Could someone please advise me which would be best.  I am particularly 
interested if anyone on the list has had experience with these.

(1)  Language 30: Yiddish
(2)  Sheva Zucker's material
(3)  Zuckerman and Herbst, _Learning Yiddish in Easy Stages_
(4)  Jean Joffen's _Yiddish for Beginners_

I have no commercial interest in the above and anyone may write to me at my 
home email to avoid any unnecessary "shemmen".

My wife, by the way, is a linguist as well an historian.  She knows several 
languages well.  I, on the other hand, know Hebrew, both Ivrit and loshn 
kodesh, German and Dutch on varying levels.
