Subject: "Posuk"/"Ferz"

Recently I ventured a reply to a question whether there was an
alternate Yiddish word for "posuk."  I suggested "ferz" and added
that it was likely cognate to the German "Vers(pl.-e)."

One correspondent, whose identity I regret I do not recall,
commented cogently that "Vers" was one of those German words where
initial "V" is pronounced like a "v" rather than life an "f."  He
therefore doubted that "Ferz" would derive from "Vers."

I took the liberty of consulting a German scholar at the University
of Vermont who told me that "Vers" does indeed begin with a "V"
sound, like most German words of Latin origin, but that many Germans
pronounce it "ferz."

Thus, I'm inclined to stick by my surmise that "ferz" and "Vers" are
as cognate as appearance would suggest.

In any event, a sheynem dank to the correspondent who raised the
question, as he induced me to make further inquiry and learn
something useful.

Subject: Re: "Daytchmerizmen" and "Tante/Mime//Onkl/Feter".

As a  yekke, who  heard no  Yiddish at home,  and taught  himself
some passive knowledge (reading with Hebrew or Latin letters) of
Yiddish, I would hesitate to join  the ongoing discussion about
"Daytchmerizmen".

I just wonder  if in the pro and con  arguments take sufficiently
into account the  variety in  Yiddish spoken at  different places.
I know here in  Israel many  people from  Romania (certain  parts of
it) who speak German fluently  (somewhat of the Austrian version),
but at the same time,  use Yiddish as  their first language when
speaking within the family.  It *seems* to me that they have a
greater tendency to use in Yiddish  more of  what might be  called
"Daytchmerizmen"  than some people of Polish origin.

Now I  will let  you have  the benefit of  my Yekkish  background,
and being able  to consult with  my mother  and another yekkish
friend as well, and would  like to comment on what Marnen
Laibow-Koser wrote on the subject "Tante/Mime//Onkl/Feter":

>Well, as long as the pot is boiling, I might as well stir it. ;> I
>don't know how many Mendelnikes know this, but "Tante", "Muhme",
>"Onkel", and "Vetter" (German spellings) are *all* German kinship
>terms. There would be nothing particularly unusual about this,
>except that in German "Vetter" and "Muhme" mean "cousin"! (I think
>"Vetter" is usually, but not exclusively, male; I'm not sure about
>"Muhme".) Anybody know how this shift in meaning came about?

While all these terms *are* German kinship ones, both Vetter and
Muhme are used less and less.  Anyhow in German Muhme was never a
term for a cousin but  for and *aunt*.  Vetter  is exclusively used
for  a *male* cousin, the  female term being  Base.  My personal
experience  from my distant  childhood was  that we  still  used
Vetter,  but also  Cousin (German sp?) but did not use Base in our
daily speaking.  Muhme I have also never  heard in daily usage,  and
know it only  from older books. Tante and Onkel were used not only
for the relevant kins, but for all older persons one was close to.
Onkel Fritz was used rather than Herr Kohn which was the term used
for people known less intimately.

Subject: loose rules

re the continuing discussion on 'loose rules in Yiddish'.  I suggest
that anyone who still believes the grammatical rules in Yiddish are
less constraining than in English for example should reread Ellen
Prince's clear, lucid explanatory discussion on linguistic grammars
(internalized knowledge of one's language) and the use of such
'rules'.  This also gives me the opportunity to publicly (to
Mendele's public, that is) thank Ellen for doing such an excellent
linguistic tutorial.  Well, Ij think it is excellent even if some of
the 'students' didn't seem to get the message.

Subject: "Daytshmerizmen in Old Yiddish" and "lezn"

Reyzl Kalifowicz-Waletzky's diatribes about Yiddish can be amusing.
However, it is dangerous to state opinions as facts without anyone
being able to check the statements. Many Mendele subscribers are
Yiddish enthusiasts who may take any thing stated with force as
"Toyres Moyshe" or - lehavdl - Gospel truth.

I would like to know how Kalifowicz-Waletzky can justify the use of
the term "daytshmerizmen" when discussing Old Yiddish and also why
she thinks "leyenen" is older than "lezn". I would never dare to
make that statement, and I have spent many an hour reading
pre-modern Yiddish texts. Although I haven't paid particular
attention to the first appearance of these forms, my hunch is that
both preexist written evidence.

Am I right when I suppose Kalifowicz-Waletzky thinks that "leyenen"
must be older because of Weinreich's hypothesis that the first
Yiddish speakers were originally speakers of a romance language? If
so, this seems to me to be an example of circularity.
