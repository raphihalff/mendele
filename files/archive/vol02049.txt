Subject:  Quebec

In vol. 2, no. 46 of MENDELE, Martin Haase inquires about Yiddish
cultural life in Quebec.

If he means Quebec City (the capital of the province -- it
is still a province -- of Quebec), then there is virtually
nothing of interest to visit from that standpoint.
Montreal, however, which is the largest city in the
province (and now the second largest city in Canada), has a
flourishing Jewish community, albeit a community that is
under some stress, having been adversely affected by a poor
economic climate and a brand of political and linguistic
nationalism that in practice (although not in principle)
places limits on the province's largest linguistic minority
group:  the anglophones.  Out-migration of Montreal's Jews
has reduced the size of the community from 115,000 circa
1961 to about 85,000 today.  The true dimensions of that
exodus are masked by the immigration during the same period
of a substantial number of North African-origin,
francophone Jews, along with a smattering of Russians,
Israelis and Ethiopians.  Who departed?  Primarily young,
English-speakers of Eastern European, Ashkenazi background.

The Montreal Jewish community today nevertheless is one of
the most fascinating communities in North America.  Like
Canada, it is divided linguistically (about 75% anglophone
and 25% francophone) as well as confessionally (similar
proportions of Ashkenazim versus Sephardim).  It is
composed disproportionately of the elderly -- who are, in
turn -- at least compared with U.S. Jews of the same cohort
-- disproportionately of immigrant background, and hence,
native Yiddish speakers.  Aside from New York, I do not
know of any North American Jewish community that has such a
large representation of (Yiddish-speaking) Hasidim.  These
are concentrated in various parts of the city. Belzer,
Satmarer and Tasher tend to reside in the av. du Parc-
Fairmount area (a district celebrated in the writings of
Mordecai Richler, who dealt with an earlier period and a
very different type of Jewish first- and second-generation
community). Habad tend to live in the Snowdon area
(northwest Montreal). In addition, there is a community of
Hungarian Hasidim (Tasher, I believe) that has settled in
an isolated town north of the city -- along the lines of
New Square (=Skvir), NY.

Most of the non-Hasidic Jews of Montreal, i.e., about 90+%
of the population, have long since left the "old
neighborhood," where Belzer, etc., now reside, but culinary
relics of that earlier group remain:  Moishe's steakhouse,
Schwartz's Montreal Hebrew Delicatessen (Charcuterie
Hebraique de Montreal, under Quebec's language laws),
Warshaw's supermarket, and Waldman's poissonerie -- all
within a short distance of one another, near Boul. St.
Laurent (The Main) and av. des Pins.

Also in that area are a Jewish monument engraver and (on
rue Bagg) an exquisite rowhouse synagogue, Beth Shlomo,
with beautiful wall paintings. A little further uptown, on
Fairmount and St. Viateur (off av. du Parc) are two of the
most authentic, European-style bagel bakeries one is likely
to find anywhere these days.  The Montreal bagel is
characterized by its slightly sweet character, its large
hole and the aroma of charcoal -- not surprising, since it
is baked in a wood-burning oven.  Imitators of the
Fairmount and St. Viateur bagel bakeries are found
elsewhere in the city. I should point out that the
aforementioned restaurants are NOT kosher; nevertheless,
for the adventurous carnivore, Montreal style smoked meat
(at Schwartz's, especially) is a MUST.  I could write an
essay on that subject alone, but will refrain from doing
so.

What about Yiddish culture in Montreal?  There is the
famous Yiddish Drama Group of the Saidye Bronfman Centre,
which has just had a very successful run of "Les
belles-soeurs," a play by the French Canadian dramatist
Michel Tremblay, translated into Yiddish by Goldie
Morgentaler and Pierre Anctil.  They stage two plays each
year, one in the autumn and one in the spring, and are
known for their relatively serious repertoire, which
includes original productions of plays by Bashevis Singer,
translations of "The Jazz Singer" and productions like the
one that recently took place.

Across the street from the Saidye Bronfman Centre (which
houses an art gallery and school, as well as a theater, and
which is attached to the Snowdon YM-YWHA -- where there is,
by the way, a kosher coffee shop) is the Jewish Public
Library, founded in 1914 by the Hebraists Reuven Brainin
and Yehuda Kaufmann (later Even-Shmuel) as Di yidishe
folks-bibliotek.  The JPL maintains one of the largest
Yiddish collections in any library on this continent, and
during the autumn and spring Yiddish lectures are held
there.  The cross-streets, by the way, are chemin de la
Cote Ste-Catherine and av. Westbury. On Westbury, just in
back of the JPL, is the Golden Age Center, where one can
hear Yiddish spoken.  There is a dairy cafeteria there,
which is kosher.  There are Jewish shops nearby, on av.
Victoria and Van Horne, including bookshops and kosher
restaurants -- also along Boul. Decarie and chemin Queen
Mary.

The principal areas of Jewish residence these days are
Snowdon (the area just described), Hampstead, Cote St-Luc
-- all of them adjacent -- and Dollard- des-Ormeaux, on the
West Island.  (Montreal is the name of the island on which
the city and many of its suburbs are located.)

I don't know of a Jewish community of its size on this continent
that can boast of a more glorious cultural heritage -- in terms
of writers, both Yiddish (Melekh Ravitch, Y. Y. Segal, Yehuda
Elberg, Rokhl Korn, Chava Rosenfarb, and many others) and
English (A. M. Klein, Irving Layton, Mordecai Richler, Leonard
Cohen), community leaders and artists.  It is a community that
is aware of its roots, and that has made strong efforts to
transmit them to the younger generation.

There are about two dozen Jewish day schools in Montreal (a
majority of Jewish children and adolescents attend day
schools), including the Jewish People's and Peretz Schools
and Bialik High School. Among the founders of these schools
were their long-time principals, Shloime Wiseman and Jacob
Zipper, both relatively recently deceased, both deeply
learned, both strongly Yiddish oriented.  One of the great
teachers at the Folkshule was the late Shimshon Dunsky,
translator of Midrash Rabbah into Yiddish, and a mentor of
the literary scholar David Roskies.

Finally, a word about Jewish Studies at McGill University.
This program, which was headed for a long time by Ruth R.
Wisse (who is about to depart for Harvard), has several
faculty specializing in various aspects of Eastern European
Jewish history and culture.  Among these are Gershon Hundert
(a specialist on Polish Jewry) and Eugene Orenstein (one of
the co-founders of Yugntruf, in 1964).  Prof. Wisse will be
sorely missed, I am sure.

I regret that I have gone on for so long.  I always resisted
the temptation to do so until the Quebec question -- about
which I have such a warm feeling -- arose.  Forgive me,
tayere leyeners.

N.B.  The founder and director of the Yiddish Drama Group is
Dora Wasserman, a student of Shloyme Mikhoels in Moscow.
