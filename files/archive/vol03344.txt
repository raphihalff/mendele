Subject: Introduction

I am a new list member from Winston-Salem, NC, where I am an Assistant
Professor of Pathology at Bowman Gray School of Medicine. My knowledge of
Yiddish literature (and Yiddish) is scanty, but I am excited about the
opportunity to learn through Mendele and the members of the list.

Subject: Courland; Voroshilovka

In the Columbia Lippincott Gazetteer (p. 458) we read:

"Courland or Kurland..., Lettish Kurzeme, region of W and S Latvia, bet.
Baltic Sea and Western Dvina R., which separates it from Livonia...
Originally inhabited by Cours, an extinct Finno-Ugric group, the region
was ruled (13th cent.) by Livonian Knights; became (1561-1795) a duchy
under Pol. suzerainty; passed (1795) to Russia as a separate govt.  In
1920 it became part of independent Latvia, except for small S coastal
strip (including Palanga) which went to Lithuania; divided into KURZEME
and ZEMGALE."

Courland's most famous Yiddish native was Max Weinreich, founder of YIVO
and author of "Di geshikhte fun der yidisher shprakh."  He was born in
1894 in Goldingen (Kuldiga). In "Shtaplen:  fir etyudn tsu der yidisher
shprakhvisnshaft un literaturgeshikhte" (Berlin: Vostok, 1923), he
describes the linguistic surroundings of his childhood.  Technically
speaking, Courland was not part of the Pale of Settlement, but Jews were
permitted to reside there.  A good source on this subject is the article
on Courland in the old "Jewish Encyclopedia."

Vorozhilovka:  There is a locality in the Ukraine identified in "Where
Once We Walked" as Voroshilovka, 26 km SSW of Vinnitsa, with a Jewish
population in the 1920s of 1,079.  "Where Once We Walked" also lists
Voroshilovgrad, a.k.a. Lugansk, also in the Ukraine (270 km ESE of
Kharkov -- i.e., quite far east).

Subject: Why Ashkenazim?

Ikh hob in zinen shteln a poshete shayle.  Frier, hob ikh gemeynt az ikh
veys an entfer.  Efsher neyn.

Vi kumt es az me ruft di yidn fun mizrekh Oyrope Ashkenazim? Emanuel
Goldsmith in zayn bukh, Modern Yiddish Culture, leygt for az mistome
derfar vos As-Skandz (Saxony) klingt a bisl enlekh tsu Ashkenaz.  Dos
heyst, fun As-Skandz vakst oys Ashkenaz.

Another (anecdotal) source offers another explanation.  One of Noah's
great-grandsons was named Ashkenaz.  In the middle ages, the rabbis tried
to account for the presence of Jews in Germany even before the Roman
Empire.  They concluded that after the flood, Ashkenaz moved to the
Rhineland.  And so, his descendants were naturally known as Askenazim.

Can someone shed additional light?

Subject: Oyve butel/iber botel

Oyve Butel sounds to me very close to Iber Botel (not sure about the
spelling), but in my family it didn't mean "I've got my own tsores" as
Meyshe Yankl Sweet has recently suggested. Instead, it described someone
with missing marbles -- usually due to senility.  "Ikh bin noch nisht
iber botel" could be the response to someone's questioning the wisdom of
your ideas on some subject or your plan of action.

Subject: sh-v-l-l; vern-constructions

1. Tsanin's _Fuler hebreish-yidisher verterbukh_ (Tel Aviv 1960)
translates "sh-v-l-l" as `negirer, farneyner, farleykener'.

2. Shapiro's et al. _Russian-Yididsh dictionary_ (Moscow 1984) very
frequently lists the following type of vern-constructions for its
aspectual pairs where the difference in aspect is expressed by a change
in word order:

moknut' 	`NAS VERN, farnetst vern, durkhgenetst vern'
namoknut' 	`VERN (fitsh-)NAS'

blednet'        `BLAS VERN'
poblednet'      `VERN BLAS'

krepnut'        `VERN SHTARKER, vern gezinter, kumen tsu di koykhes'
okrepnut'       `SHTARKER VERN, kreftiker vern, farhartevet vern, kumen
                tsu di koykhes, shteln zikh oyf di fis'

The change in word order is not always consistent in the dictionary, but
still the change seems to indicate a change in focus.  One informant
explained them as follows:

a. S'iz gegangen a shpreyregn.  Az er hot night gehat keyn zontik, iz er
NAS GEVORN.

versus:

b. Ven er iz gegangen oyf der gas, hot zikh plutsem ongehoybn a shturem,
iz er GEVORN NAS.

Example (a) was to express the duration, whereas (b) the suddenness and
completion of the process.  The _Russian-Yiddish dictionary_ does not
limit it only to vern constructions, but to others as well, e.g.,:

mstit' `nekome nemen' otomstit' `nemen nekome'

I have not checked literary sources, but does anyone know whether these
changes in word order are actually used in literature to express
aspectual differences?

Subject: Shopping bag

> What about "kushik", basket in standard Yiddish but often used in my

We use either baytl (baatl, in our pronunciation) or torbe for a shopping
bag.  My understanding is that baytl is actually more appropriate for a
wallet or purse (or, as they call it in New York, a "packe-book").  What
exactly are the parameters of a torbe?

Subject: Sholem Aleichem

Andrew Cassel:

For some reason, my private message to you was sent back to me as
undeliverable.  I am trying again, but just in case, I post this
on Mendele for you.

I received your zeyde's Sholem Aleichem letters very well. They are truly
Sholem-Aleykhemdik in tone and spirit.  I certainly enjoyed them, and
they add to biographical and historical backgrounds.  They anchor certain
dates and concerns of Sholem Aleichem at a crucial period in his life.  I
am going to go over them a bit more, and see if I can discern some
special insights from them.

Zeyer a sheynem dank.

Louis Fridhandler.
