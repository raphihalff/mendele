Subject: "while" in Yiddish

I heard Yid. "dervayl" a lot, which I took to mean
"meanwhile" when recounting a past event, and a sort-of
"while" in the present.

(past) ikh bin dortn geveyzn, dervayl mayn shvester iz
       geforen kayn amerike.

(present?) zets-zikh do dervayl ikh makh epes tsu esen.

Does that fly, or is it Anglicized Yiddish like "nemen
'care' oyf"?

Subject: He's Jewish vs. He's a Jew

        Re Yude-Leyb Proger's note on "Ginsberg's Jewish
background":  in English we are more apt to say "(s)he's
Jewish" than "(s)he's a Jew", for example.  I've noticed
people (Jews) bristle when someone talks about so and so as
being "a Jew", as opposed to "being Jewish".  In general we
(at least nowadays) say "he's Chinese (not: he's a
Chinaman), she's black (vs. she's a black/Negro), they're
Hispanic" -- i.e., the adjective and not the noun form.

        Why does _Jew_ make some people uncomfortable?  I'd
like to hear people's feelings about this.  One reason, I
think, is the phonological markedness of this one-syllable
word in English (for non-linguists this means: 'the word
sounds funny in comparison with the majority of other sound
combinations in the language').  How many other words do we
have (in English) with consonant+[u]?  Only oddities such
as _moo_ (the sound a cow makes), _goo_ (an informal word
for sticky, dense liquid), and maybe some more.  And
phonologically marked combinations are in fact the ones
most likely to be exploited by childspeak (_goo_) or
onomatopeic lexical items (read:  'words') like _moo_. So
the Jew (bristle-bristle), in his/her
historically/socially/etc. anomalous position in the world
is even treated as an anomaly by phonology! Other thoughts?

Subject: turmoil words

        Well, I know that the Hebrew word _megillah_ has a
secondary Yiddish meaning of fuss, turmoil, brouhaha,
hassle, parental diatribe, etc. I wanted to find a parallel
word, also in Yiddish, for a post on IUODAIOS. I came up
with _meshugas_. It seems that it could mean the same
thing, though the root probably puts it close to _meshuga_,
_meshuginer_. Looking at the form, probably _meshugas_
shouldn't be used alone; is it "a whole craziness of
......., or as hersh basser would want it, "a
crazy..<?>..."

        As parallels to _megillah_, Noyekh-shames suggested
tsimmes or British shemozzle (different from _shlemazl_, or
similar, meaning 'the whole luckless mess?'?

        So what should I know that I don't?

Subject: RE: Mendele Vol 1.154

Still catching up on back issues, I've just read Yude-Leyb
Proger's very eloquent and thoughtful Part 2 of Ludic
Yiddish. I agree with what he says -- in theory. And I'm
doing what I can, in practice: our kids are growing up with
Yiddish as everyday tongue, and hopefully will be able to
relate to mame-loshn in the way described in some of the
very touching poetry that Yude-Leyb quotes.

But we all have to admit that this is an exception.  Except
to the extent that Jews who grow up in a Yiddish-speaking
Chasidic community turn to the secular literature (which
isn't likely to happen anytime soon, but isn't outside the
realm of possibility somewhere down the road -- consider
where the original secular Yiddish writers came from in the
first place!), the large base of native Yiddish speakers is
irretrievably gone.

And Yiddish as an academic and literary subject of study
may thrive, but much as Latin and Greek have thrived in
universities over the centuries.

Which leads me to wonder.  Which is better: for Yiddish to
survive as "Ludic Yiddish", or not at all?

              "YIDDISH" SPELLINGS IN ISRAELI HEBREW
 
In _Maariv, asakim_, p. 24 on 16 February 1988 I noted the
spelling of the Yiddish word _gefilte_: gimel, pey, yod,
lamed, tet, ayin at end!  One usually sees hey for final
ayin. Israeli Hebrew often must spell in a Yiddish manner
in order to be understood!
 
Hebrew still has no uniform system for writing Yiddish
words or words of Yiddish origin (the two should be
distinguished: certain Yiddish lexemes have entered Hebrew,
hence they are Hebrew lexemes of Yiddish origin; and any
Hebrew-writer may cite Yiddish texts within an otherwise
Hebrew text).

Sometimes Yiddish spelling is followed. Sometimes a Hebrew
spelling is improvized.  And sometimes the spelling is
mixed. Here is an example of mixed spelling: the 29 April
1988 issue of the Netanya-Chadera edition of the _Shevuon
Yediot Acharonot_ announces a Yiddish play to be staged on
5 May, _Rozhinkes mit mandlen_. It was spelled
resh-vav-zayin-yod-nun-kof-samech mem-yod-tet
mem-alef-nun-dalet-lamed-yod-nun.

Hebrew now spells Yiddish _altmodish_ 'old-fashioned'
_alte-modishe_ (hey at end of both parts of compound), thus
creating a new form, one non-existent in Yiddish.
 
                             ******
 
                           ENJOY
 
 
In April 1988, at the entrance to the Israel Museum in
Jerusalem there was a large sign in Hebrew and English
which read as follows: "Hapaam -- mevaker, hapaam habaa --
chaver.  Lehitraot beagudat hayedidim  / This time visit
and enjoy -- next time visit and join the Organization of
Friends."  This (Ashkenazic) Jewish English use of _enjoy_
has penetrated General English in places like New York City
and perhaps other American urban centers as well.  Since
visitors to the Israel Museum come from all over the world,
it would have been more appropriate to use General English:
"A visitor today, tomorrow a member -- we invite you to
join the Organization of Friends." The play on "enjoy /
join" is not too good to delete.  There is no reason why
one can't enjoy being a member as well as being a visitor.

                            ******
 
                            SHMALTZ
 
It takes time for a Yiddish word to become a Jewish English
word and then become a general English word and different
individuals and groups hook into the system at different
points.  If you are sophisticated, you sometimes miss the
fact that what you think is a Yiddishism is already good
colloquial English.  Isn't _shmaltz_ (< Y. _shmalts_)
already well acclimated in general English?  Yet William M.
Johnston in his -The Austrian Mind; An Intellectual and
Social History 1848-1938- (University of California Press:
Berkeley/ Los Angeles/London, {1976}, p. 128), writes:
"Since World War Two, the waltz, together with Austrian
pastry, has become identified with a sentimentality that
American Yiddish calls shmaltz."
