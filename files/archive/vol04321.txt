Subject: Introduction

I am Michael Kleiner of Philadelphia, Pa. I was raised a secular Jew,
attending the Jewish Children's Folkshul. I also taught there for five
years. During the '80s, early '90s, I was active in the Congress of
Secular Jewish Organizations (CSJO), particularly around young adult and
continuity issues. I was on conference planning committees, delivered a
couple of speeches, facilitated some workshops and handled publicity when
the conferences were held in Philadelphia in 1988 and 1993. I know that
at some of those early conferences I met Miriam Jerris.

After a number of years as a journalist and public relations person, I
returned to school and will receive a master's degree in educational
media from Temple University in August. The program has allowed me to be
very creative with a number of projects. During the fall semester, I had
a course on Designing Instructional Resources, in which the students had
to write a teacher's guide/curriculum or training manual on a topic of
their choice, and produce the media -- videos, slide shows, overhead
transparencies -- to complement the instruction. I chose Eastern European
Jewish Immigration 1881-1924. I produced a slide show, which included my
mother singing in Yiddish. This project showed a progression from my
shule days.

As a student, the teacher had us interview our grandparents who were
immigrants. When I taught the course in 1987, I had the students
interview immigrants, but we put together a slide show with music and the
students presented the reports at the closing assembly. That was before I
knew of educational media and how to do it right. In my teacher's guide,
I also have the students doing interviews with an end product of a video
or slide show or CD-ROM.

Although I don't know Yiddish, I am interested in the culture, music and
literature. I also recognize the language's importance. In 1969-70, our
family spent a year in Norway. We also traveled in Europe. Wherever we
came into contact with the Jewish community, it was my mother's Yiddish
that enabled us to communicate (with the possible exception of Norway,
where they knew English). My mother translated for us. We learned a great
deal about the experiences of people during WWII. My grandmother spoke a
lot of Yiddish. My aunt is translating Yiddish material for a man who is
writing a book about a righteous Gentile.

Subject: The Oxford Yiddish program

For B. Adler:

The story I've heard is a little different from Ellen Prince's. There was
a conflict between the director of the Postgraduate Hebrew Centre and
Dovid Katz, one which resulted in Katz' resignation and his subsequent
forming of the Oxford Institute for Yiddish Studies. The Hebrew Centre
retaliated by hiring a chartered accountant to investigate financial
misconduct by Katz et al, an investigation which turned up no such wrong
doing. Having spoken with Peter da Costa, director of the Postgraduate
Hebrew Centre three weeks ago, and having been told by him that there
would probably not be summer program (something that was patently untrue,
as Marie Wright of the Yiddish Institute informed me; the Yiddish
Institute's summer program was fairly well in place by that time), it
seems to me that a lot of this boils down to that tired old battle
between the Hebraists and the Yiddishists. This is especially true when
one considers the output of the Yiddishists at Oxford versus their
Hebraist counterparts. Mostly this battle is annoying and typically
divise of the Jewish Studies movement. Clearly Yiddish is still
considered by many to be the bastardized German of Mendelssohn. Its a
wonder anything gets done. . .

This is the story as I've heard it. Other Mendelniks will probably chime
in with their interpretations/ideas.

Subject: Why Study Yiddish?

Matt Dailey has lifted Mendele to new heights. We soar on his words - oyf
odler fligl.

Would that we could bestow goldene margaritkelekh for words on Mendele
that are too precious to be contained only within our family; his words
are so uplifting, so moving, it makes one ponder how to share them with
the world, how to distribute them on the wind. I shall read them proudly
at our Yiddish Club meeting this week, and I forecast that many members
will shed a tear of appreciation.

I am honored that Matt is on our network.

Subject: mentsh

to: louis fridhandler

granted it's not technically one word but the english complex noun _human
being_ has the same sense as _mentsh_ ('decent, ethical person').

Subject: Mentsh

In response to Louis Fridhandler's search through other languages for an
approximation to the Yiddish mentsh, the Polish word czlowiek (pronounced
chwoviek) is pretty similar, carrying all three of the meanings Louis
lists for mentsh. Even more interesting is comparing the connotations of
the Yiddish mentshlekhkayt and the Polish czlowieczenstwo. While they
seem to be a reasonably close fit, it should not surprise us that the
Polish seems to emphasize the component of dignity most, while the
Yiddish that of compassion.
