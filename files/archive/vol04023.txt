Subject: A really masterful hegdish!!

It takes extraordinary talent to screw up as many things in one
Mendelnick posting as I did in my note about Singer.  I referred to the
right brother with the wrong name, the wrong brother with no name, etc.
But now I know who it was I thought I was asking about because everybody
figured out what it was I should have been saying instead of what I said.
And the syntax of this last sentence is glorious in its total
incomprehesibility.

Then Ted Steinberg correctly jumped all over me for making reference to
the "happy, happy Jews of Tevye the milkman."  But I mention that I am a
professional musician who has played "Fiddler" about a million times so
my mindset about Tevye is always conditioned by a paycheck for playing
klezmer-like on the bottle dance!!!  When I stop playing the musical, I
will have to completely reread the Sholem Aleichem stories to get my
perspective back again.  So, Ted, it was in this mindset that I was
referring to the happy, happy Jews of the pale, which is exactly what one
gets from the musical.  And without doubt, the original shows a much more
profound picture of the pale Jews.

The only thing that I have played more than Fiddler is the Nutcracker
ballet (about 50 times a year in December) and sometimes I get the two
mixed up; i.e., the mouse fight is beginning to sound like "Matchmaker."

But, striking back ferociously, no one has responed to my inquiry about
Sholem Asch and why he has disappeared from sight so swiftly.  His books
"East River," "Moses," etc. were so very popular.  Why did they go away
so fast?  His play, "Die Gott fun nekomen" (The God of Vengeance) was so
powerful, perhaps an equal in shock value with The Dybbuk, and now one
cannot even find it in libraries, much less see it on the stage.

Is it true that Asch converted to Christianity?  What happened to so
eliminate him from the public scene?

Subject: 1) shabeysenakhts 2) Kinship terms 3) Names

1) Many thanks to the many who provided me with a variety of responses
regarding the adverbial use of "nachts" in German. Curme's grammar, by
the way, describes the form as an "old genitive".

2) Those interested in Yiddish kinship terms should ask Zachary Baker if
he can have YIVO make photocopies of an old issue of "Working Papers"
which containns an analysis of Yiddish kinship terminology by Beatrice S.
Weinreich. 3) Shapiro, cognate with Speyer, is derived from the Romance/
Latin name of that city, Ashpira; hence, the final vowel. As for the name
"Mintz", why assume that it derives from the place name "Mainz"? Try
again!

Subject: Shapiro

I was puzzled by the recent note of Yude Rozof attributing the origin of
the distinctively Jewish name Shapiro to the town of Shpayer. It was
always my understanding that the name came from the Hebrew word sofer,
i.e. scribe (the peh and feh being interchanged). Surely Jews having the
occupation of scribe were far more ubiquitous than Jews from the town of
Shpayer.  Can anyone shed some more light on this?

Subject: Etymology of Shapiro

I know that the standard line about the family name Shapiro is that it
comes from the place name _Speyer_ in Germany.  What's the reason to
assume it is not the Ashkenazically pronounced Talmudic-Aramaic _shapiro_
'the beautiful (one)'?

Subject: Re: momzer-gonoruk

Does anyone know the meaning of the phrase: mamzer-gonoruk? (I've been
asking people for years, but have never posted it on Mendele). The
context is a poem by Kadya Molodowsky, and here is the stanza:

Bay mir in hant tsvey federn fun a fazan.
khotsh s'klingt dos vort fazan
tsu fremd, tsu eydl.
s'iz nisht vi mamzer-gonoruk,
un shoyn avade nisht vi katshke-dreydl.
es klingt ober vi traktor, bire, tayge --
verter muntere, bavofnte,
un oysgetonene fun alter dayge.
shtark un umgerikht aroysgeregnt --
ershte yidishe oytonome gegnt.

The poem is about language and territory -- America and Birobidzshan --
Yiddish and memory...  I understand the poem, and I've had some good,
intelligent guesswork go into that phrase (mine and many others'), but no
one can swear to its meaning.  Someone came up with "gonorrheal bastard,"
maybe punning on "goner" (gander).  I think it is a curse or epithet from
Molodowsky's native shtetl Bereza-Kartuskay (in White Russia), or
possibly from her adopted city of Warsaw (in the 1920s-1930s).  But no
one has been able to verify this guess for me.

a sheynem dank.
