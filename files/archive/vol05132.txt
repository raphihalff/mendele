Subject: Yiddish & bas/bar mitsves

Marcia Gruss Levinsohn (Vol. 5.129) asks whether the cultural
celebration she describes can be called a "bar/bas mitsve" event since it
doesn't include readings from the Torah and/or Haftorah. Having conducted
such celebrations for over 30 years and as the author of "Credo for a
Secular Bar/Bas Mitsve," a version of which, I understand, is also used
in Israel, I have no difficulty in affirming the right of non-observant
Jews to adapt any aspect of the varied, continually evolving Jewish
tradition to meet their needs. The alternative for such Jews would be to
discard the traditions entirely--as is often the case when options are
foreclosed.

In addition to the "droshe" topics Marcia suggested, the bas/bar mitsve
program of the Sholem Community encourages youngsters to select any topic
related to their Jewish identity (historical, cultural,
philosophical,etc.) and to present it in any form they wish (spoken
essay, graphic arts, dance, music, audio-video, etc.) although most opt
for the traditional spoken essay.

Many participants in the program have reported that, years later, when
they describe their experience to college roommates and others, the
uniform reaction has been: "that's not fair--how come you got to do
something so creative and interesting?!"

I like Lipa Feingold's song (is the music available?) and hope Marcia
will supply what appears to be a missing last line of the second verse.
Then we can all say az mir hobn geklibn nakhes.

Subject: Yiddish diminutive names

A shaynem dank to Zellig Bach on his wonderful disertation on naming.
(Vol. 5,125,1)  A frage. If the diminutive form for 'Yankl" is "Yankle",
then "Moishe" is the diminutive of "Moish". Is this correct? This would
mean that the beloved Moishe Rabenu (Moses) was really Moish Rabenu.
Doesn't sound right!! One solution would be that the non-diminutive form
in "Yank" and thus the diminiutive form becomes "Yankle". Would
appreciate comments from my khaverim Mendelyners and especiallly khaver
Bach. (I am wondering if khaver Bach has a background in language study
or connected to a college or university, since his address is AOL).

Yankl (or Yankel or Yank) Gerger

Subject: Shilumim

Could someone explain the meaning (and pronunciation) of the presumably
Hebraic word spelled shin-yud-lamed-vov-mem-yud-mem, which appeared in
the caption to story near the bottom of the front page of the Sept. 22,
1995 Forward? By context the word appears to mean "reparations", but I
can't find it in a Hebrew dictionary nor in any of my dictionaries of
Hebraisms in Yiddish.

Subject: Stashkeshmir

Leybl Goldberg refers to "staskeshmir" as a Weinreich neologism for
peanut butter. Is this word not generally accepted? Our kids use it all
the time. A "stashke" is a peanut, and anything one spreads on bread is a
"shmir". E.g., we also have "tshoklet-shmir" (the goopy stuff from
Israel, yum!). Garlic spread is knobl-shmir, and so on.

Subject: Yiddish in L.A. secular kolnidre program

Some 400 people joined in a solemn and joyous observance of kolnidre
night in which many works of Yiddish poets and thinkers were read and
sung at a program sponsored by the Sholem Community Organization of Los
Angeles, an affiliate of the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations.

Poems by Avrom Reyzin, Itsik Fefer and Peretz Markish, as well as
Yehoyesh'es translation of biblical passages, were read to and by the
enthusiastic crowd, many of whom had not previously experienced a ritual
or ceremonial use of Yiddish literature. Also included in the program
were excerpts from the writings of Y.L. Peretz and Dr. Khayim Zhitlovsky.

The musical component of the unique program featured the Sholem
Community's Yiddish Choir and a stirring solo rendition of kolnidre by
its conductor, Joanna Cazden, who also led the audience in Yiddish,
English and Hebrew songs. Especially moving were the Choir's renditions
of J. Kotliar's "Zing'zhe mir a lidele in yidish," (Sing Me a Yiddish
Song) and Mark M. Warshavsky's "Oyfn pripetshik."

The melody of kolnidre was heard again in a solo performance on the
theramin by Alex Schub, music director of the Sholem Sunday School, where
almost 100 students learn Yiddish folksongs and some folk expressions as
part of their exploration of Jewish identity.

A number of the participants in the kolnidre program learned of it at the
huge Yiddishkayt Festival in September, which was co-sponsored by the
Sholem Community, and via a posting on Mendele. Others had attended the
Community's Rosheshone celebration in a Brentwood park, where Peretz's
"L'shonetoyve tikuseyvu" was read in the original and in Max Rosenfeld's
translation.

Subject: Julius Blauma?

I'm seeking a book on the Jewish communities in E. Europe, written in the
late '20s by an author whose name is reported to me as Julius Blauma--the
book is in Yiddish, and was published in Poland.  This is of great
interest for some research I'm doing.  A thorough search of library
databases yielded nothing with this author's name, or close to the
description of the book.  If anyone has a bibliographic lead, pls.
contact me at my email address--would be very grateful.  A sheynem dank
in foroys.
