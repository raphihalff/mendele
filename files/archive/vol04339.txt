Subject: Hannah and her sisters

Since Leonard Prager mentions a young Yiddishist named Hannah, I thought
it might not be inappropriate, while reminding the world of poets, to
remind the Mendele list of a first rate poet who died a few years back,
steeped in years, but writing to the end, in Yiddish, in Berkeley: Malka
Heifetz Tussman.  I had the delight of knowing this beautiful woman, but
not as well as I should have done, I mean, life is full of busy
distractions, and when two people meet passionate ly, as we did, once in
long while is enough... writers in America are like elephants, who graze
apart, or like bulls, in their own separate fields, male and female, and
Malka was 1000% passionately female.  I even had the pleasure of meeting
Glatshtayn at her apartment here in Santa Monica, in the late 1960s.  An
evening of tea and cakes and light chitchat.  Malka adored and respected
him, and he basked in her glowing respect.  Malka, however, is a poet as
fine and powerful as he was, and there was an element of embarrassment
that flickered over his expression as she honored him time and again,
with her respect: he knew her worth, but he was the great one, I mean
Great One.  Malka published her books, I believe, in Israel, Goldene
Kayt.  She deserves full attention, and Englishing s...I did only a dozen
poems with her in the 1960s, again to my regret.  They were published in
England by Daniel Weissbort, in his journal of Translation in the 60s.
She would be a delight for eager new students, I believe, and well worth
a thesis, MA, or even PhD, or two.  Her husband was the founder of the
Hebrew Teachers Union in LA, a fighter for minimal decent wages, as you
might imagine. Her son was a professor of philosophy at Berkeley, and she
moved up there, as a widow in the 70s, to be near him.  Marcia Falk
translated some of her work, too.  Irving Howe had my versions, but
neglected them in the end in his anthology.  He was not too good at that
sort of job: a prosaic professor, good for prose, that is, and criticsm
of of American fiction, but not much else, I think, in the end.  I offer
Malka to this world.  She would be happy in heaven to hear from you all,
about her work, in this sublunary sphere.

Subject: Words ending in -em

There are a number of interesting words that serve as a reminder to us to
be careful when making correspondences between present day Yiddish and
modern High German.

I was home sick, and decided to do some exploring. The phrase that kept
ringing through the haze of the antihistamines was:

Az der rebe heyst, shist a bezem oykh!

bezem (Yiddish) = Besen (German) = bezem (Dutch)
buzem           = Busen          = boezem         = bosom (Eng.)
boydem          = Boden          = bodem          = bottom
fodem           = Faden          = vadem          = fathom

All these nouns have German forms in "n". Boydem iz interesting because
its cognate's meaning in German is "the ground". Boydem shares its
additional meaning of "garret" or "loft" with Boden. But the Yiddish word
in addition to this latter meaning, has the sense of "attic," a real
shift in meaning. Vadem in Dutch has nothing to do with thread; its
meaning is more like "fathom".

"Drinen oyfn boydem shtibl voynt mayn tayer Reyzele"

I know we've dealt to death with bargoens, but I did run across some
likely candidates. I found these as I was hunting for "gauw" (see
previous posting)

goochem (clever, knowing)
goochemerd (wide awake person)
gannef
gappen (to steal)

Subject: "Sweetheart" is not "mentsh"

In the "mentsh" debate earlier this month, someone offered the (slightly
dated?) term "sweetheart" as a possible equivalent.  In my view, that's
someone whose "heart is in the right place," well beyond expectations, or
in contrast with others whose behavior is less generous.

I contend that mentsh is a more complex concept than that.  Let me
demonstrate by resorting to the popular current Paul Newman movie,
"Nobody's fool."   Newman, as the lead character, is caring, generous,
and giving.  In my mind, he's a "sweetheart," or has a "heart of gold."
But he also drinks to excess, loses his temper often, spends much of his
time unemployed because he is irresponsible, and abandoned his wife and
child when the child was small.  Is this a mentsh?

I say no.  His "heart is in the right place," but his "head is not on
straight."  To be a mentsh, you need both.

Subject: Khinezishe mentshlekhkayt

A final stray thought about the "mentsh" thread--agree with those who
point out the occurance of dual meanings of human/humane in diverse
cultures.  The Chinese word "ren" has a similar meaning to
mentshlekhkayt, at least according to Mencius, and is phonologically
identical and etymologically related to "ren," person.  This was long
before there were Chinese Jews, so this was definitely an independent
development.  And thanks to those who rescued me from the horns of my
rogele dilemma (oy!).
