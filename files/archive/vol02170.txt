Subject: Purimshpil.

As someone one who has spent last Purim recording a
Purimshpil at the Krethenef Tish in Rehovot, I can only
recall that the Artaxerxes comedy was published and
discussed in a russian book which appeared in the sixties
in Moscow. I think the name of the book is Artaxerxovo
Dejstvo, but I could be wrong. Forgot the nam e of the
author. Binding was green.

Good Luck

Subject: Various

zev bar-lev's question about the pronunciation of 'ikh'
reminds me that I recall seeing (probably in some
translations of khumesh) the form 'nikht' for 'nisht'. As
if that wasn't enough I discovered that litvaks use 'nit'.

=================

Martin Davis is absolutely correct about the general lapse
in the use of polite forms among younger folk (and, no, I
do not go around hitting people in the face!)

==================

And thanks to khayim bokhner for his clear summary of the
ground rules for irtsn, which conform to my experience too.

Subject: A Kashe

My son asked me about an expression he had come across and
he was told is Yiddish.   It is tipech shel kayitz.  Do you
know it, and if so what does it mean?

Subject: Pronouncing ish for ikh

Zev Bar-Lev asked about the pronunciation /ish/ for ikh.
I've never heard it in Yiddish, but that's exactly how it
is pronounced in my in-laws' German dialect, spoken by Jews
in small towns near Frankfurt: "ich" rhymes exactly with
"Fisch", and similarly all words in which standard German
has the "ich-Laut" are pronounced with /sh/ ("sch").  Also
some words in which the standard language has /k/, for
example, the name of one of the towns, Friedberg, is
pronounced locally as [fritbeash] (with a short /i/).  I
don't know how widespread that is in German dialects.  The
only possibly analogous case I know of in Yiddish (but
maybe there are others) is nisht, compared with German
nicht -- if this originally had a /kh/.
