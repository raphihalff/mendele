Subject: A glossary

When Yude-Leyb Proger took temporary leave of us early last
summer to visit Oxford, most of us expected that he would
spend his time among the dreaming spires doing just that.
A nekhtiker tog!  One sees at last the error of projecting
one's own slothful ways onto one's betters.

At any rate, nos. 164 through 166 will contain a particu-
larly useful and welcome contribution.  I'll go further:
it's a _wonderful_ contribution and Mendele is proud to
present it.  A riziger yasher koyekh aykh, Yude-Leyb, fun
unz alle.

Subject: A glossary
 
During the past summer I translated Mikhl Radzinski's _Di
megile fun mayn lebn_.  M.R. (1909-1989), from Semyatitsh
near Bialystok (Y. Byalistok, virtual NEY territory?),
dictated his memoirs to the journalist and critic Shimen
Kants (1914-1990), born in Cracow (Y. Kroke, western
Galicia = CY?) and lived in Warsaw (Y. Varshe) and
elsewhere.  Kants took dictation manually and later typed
his notes.  I worked from a typescript, encountering some
confusing elements in terms of spelling and a few other
matters -- it was hard to know whether certain forms and
expressions originated with M.R. or with S.K. My approach
to the translation is indicated in the following preface:
 
              A Word on the Translation and the Notes
 
"Ideally a good translation does not read like a
translation. Traces of the translated language may mar the
idiomaticity of the finished work, but there are also cases
when the translator might wish to keep some flavor of the
original.

To do so without offending the syntax or stylistic options
of the target language is something of an art.  Chaucer and
others have shown that a sprinkling of untranslated words
can flavor an entire text; a sampling of non-native syntax
may have a similar effect.  In the present translation, I
am decidedly not interested in communicating the flavor of
Yiddish syntax a la Leo Rosten, a strategy which mocks the
speaker.  I try to imitate the mood of the original in an
informal English which is analagous in as many ways as
possible to the author's Yiddish.

However, I do not want the reader to forget that the
original text is rooted in a mental climate different from
his own. By giving key terms and names in romanized Yiddish
in parentheses (which I use _only_ for this purpose)
immediately following the translation gives some of the
sense or feel of the world in which the text originated.
It also enables the reader to judge and thus accept or
reject the English rendition (which is sometimes very
approximate).

At the risk of cluttering the page, I romanize and gloss in
the following fashion: beautiful character (_sheyne
mides_); good deeds (_maysim toyvim_); the old home (_di
alte heym_).  When the original Yiddish expression is long
I often place it in a footnote. Romanizations are given
selectively, but most of them can also be found in the
_Glossary_ at the end. I also give footnotes for matters
that cannot be explained adequately in a gloss __
identifications of persons, organizations, places, events.
Hopefully these may help the reader to enter the world of
these memoirs more fully.  Footnotes are also where I
indicate puzzles, problems in the manuscript, and where I
ask for help from others in matters I have not been able to
explain."
 
 
Working on this translation further convinced me of the
necessity for a standard romanization of Yiddish, which is
what SYR is.  I give the _Glossary_ below.  I would
appreciate any corrections and improvements in either the
transcription or the concise gloss.  A part of this
_Glossary_ is lifted out of my notes for _A Student's
Dictionary of the Hebrew-Aramaic Component in Yiddish_.
Many of the words are both transcribed and glossed in Uriel
Weinreich's important dictionary, _Modern Yiddish-English
English-Yiddish Dictionary_, but no existing dictionary can
help beginners with all the words they are likely to meet
in a Yiddish text.  Someday dictionaries like the
_Glossary_ offered here will be on line like existing
spelling-check programs and _Mendele_ authors will be able
to transcribe Yiddish without any difficulties.  Moreover,
machine-translation will enable us to translate from
English to Yiddish faster and better.  This is known as
futuristics, what we call in Yiddish _meshiekhs-tsaytn_.
