Subject: Why never 'der' Rashi?

In Mendele Vol 5.060 among another points, Eliyahu Juni also discusses
the places when one  says in front of the name of  a rabbi "der", like
der  Rambam, and  when "der"  is not  used.  I  think that  it was  in
mail-jewish  where someone  had  brought up  a  related question,  not
mentioned by  Juni, and which as far as I know was never answered. Why
is the combination "the" Rambam frequently used but never "the" Rashi?
I think  other examples  were given  as well.  Clearly both Rambam and
Rashi are acronyms.

Subject: Definite article plus

Eliyahu Juni writes that the definite article is usually used with a name
if the name in question is an acronym or a magnum opus (e.g. the Rambam
or haRambam).

Acronyms don't always require a definite article, and in fact, in some
cases, cannot take it.  The example I have is of Rashi: rashe brengt,
etc. not 'der rashe brengt.'

Eliyahu speculates further that the use of an article with a proper name
might be  restricted to names prefaced by the title "Rabeynu", or perhaps
even to names consisting of "Rabeynu X" where X is a single personal
name, and no more.

However, he brings down an example that refutes his own hypothesis, viz.
"der Noyde Biyhude iz geveyn rov in Prag."  Of course, he may have meant
that for the definite article to be used, the name has to either be that
of a book or a personal name beginning with Rabeynu X, where X is a
single personal name, and no more.

I have an alternate hypothesis.  Perhaps the definite article _always_
refers to a book.  Thus, "der Rambam" refers to 'yad khazaka' or some
other book, depending upon the context.  E.g. "azoy shteyt in hilkhes
tshuve inem Rambam."  Similarly, the 'node biyhude' refers to the seyfer
written by R. Yekhezkel Landau.  However, this is then extended, so as to
refer to the author of the seyfer, so that we have "der Noyde Biyhude iz
geveyn rov in Prag."  According to this hypothesis, if you say: "der
rambam hot gevoynt in fustat," this actually means " the writer of the
book written by the rambam lived in Fustat."  Now, this may seem unduly
complicated.  On the other hand, we can now explain why we cannot have
'der rashe,' because there is no book by rashe.

A test of this hypothesis is to see if the definite article is used for
writers who have not written complete sforim.  For example, does one say
'der rabeynu khananel?'

Disclaimer: There was a discussion on this very point in mail.jewish.
Some of what I have written might stem from mail.jewish.

Subject: "Bringing" for "citing"

Reb Eliyahu Juni's scholarly submission on the use of "bring" in English,
Yiddish, and Hebrew as a synonym for "cites" (as proof) can be expanded
with the Aramaic use of "'isa'" (aleph-yud-sov-aleph") used like "muva'"
in Hebrew.  Thus: "'isa' b'gemara"="it's brought (as a proof) in the
Gemara."

Subject: Bringing examples

Another possible source for "bringing an example" (discussed by Shleyme
Axelrod in 5.056 and Eliyahu Juni in 5.060) are Slavic calques of
(medieval?) Latin _adducere_  such as Russian _privesti primer_, Czech
_uvest pr^iklad_ 'adduce an example'.  In other contexts the verbs would
be translated by English "bring" or Yiddish _brengen_.

Subject: Khotsh, khotshk

Khotsh or khotshk is used in two ways. 1. at least; 2. despite. You find
it in a song, "Gib mir abisele, khotshk abisele koyekh".  Here it is used
in the first sense. The other meaning is found in a popular tune sung by
kheydr children on the sedre in parshes Va'yekhi. Where Yankev tells
Yoysef to bury him in the land of Kenan despite not having done so to
Yoysef's mother Rokhel. The posik starts Va'ani. The tune goes on the
words "Khotshk ikh bin dikh matriekh mit mayn kevire, un far dayn mame
Rokhel hob ikh nisht azoy geton".

Subject: Khotsh

To Fishel Hoppe's question, I believe its meaning is "despite the fact
that" or "even though" and I think it derives from the Russian Chotya
which means "even though". At least that is the way I recall it being
used.

Subject: Khotsh

I was surprised to find that Reb Yankel Gerger's query about where
"khotsh" is used got only one answer;  I would have responded earlier,
but I expected the next volume to be flooded.

Khog'meynt az khotsh di mendelyaner vos redn yiidish alts zeyere ershte
shprakh kenen es, un kh'hob mikh nisht g'kholemt az s'iz a y'kar
ham'tsies; "bay indz", vi me zogt, s'iz a vort vos m'nitst gants a sakh,
un nisht nor shrayim fun der literatur.

In the usage I am used to, "khotsh" means 'at least';  it's synonymous
with "l'khol hapokhes".  See the paragraph above for an example.

Subject: Hebrew-Yiddish pairs

Miriam Isaacs asks about children's rhymes with paired Hebrew and Yiddish
words (5.061).  A number of such songs have been published, starting with
Ginzburg and Marek (nos. 122-23). No. 448 in Y. L. Cahan's _Yidishe
folkslider mit melodyes_ is a long variant that begins as follows:

		Eyle toyldes noyekh,
		fun bronfn krigt men koyekh,
		a glezele vayn iz der iker,
		fun bronfn vert men shiker.
		Ov iz a foter,
		keyder iz a toter,
		a toter iz keyder,
		bgodim zenen kleyder,
		kleyder zenen bgodim,
		royt iz odem,
		odem iz royt,
		lekhem iz broyt...

No. 449 is a shorter but trilingual (Hebrew-Yiddish-Polish [mostly])
text:

		Bayis, a shtibele -- to khata,
		eym, a muter -- to mama,
		ov, a foter -- to tata,
		derekh, a veg -- to droga,
		yad, a hant -- to ruka [Ukrainian or Russian],
		regel, a fus -- to noga.
