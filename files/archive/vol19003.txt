Subject: Plea to authors

Authors of books on Yiddish culture often announce their works in either 
Mendele or in Mendele Personal Notices. Quite naturally, they want us to 
know that their books have been published, what they are about and, with 
due blushing modesty, how excellent they are. All power to their elbow! We 
potential readers are truly delighted to hear the news. But may I make a 
plea to all such authors? Please spare a thought for those of us 
responsible for ordering books for university and other libraries and give 
the full bibliographic details.

Today for example I read a personal notice from Warren Hoffman announcing 
his "The Passing Game: Queering Jewish American Culture."  Typically he 
gives us a useful synopsis, but otherwise mentions only his own name and 
the title. That just isn't enough!

What we also need, mutatis mutandis, is something like this:

Hoffman, Warren, The Passing Game: Queering Jewish American Culture,
Syracuse U.P., 2009, 216pp. [ISBN: 978-08156-3202-3], $24.95.

That way, the necessary information can be cut-and-pasted directly into an 
accessions-list, saving faculty and librarians time and helping the 
authors themselves to get their books purchased and read as expeditiously 
as possible. I happen, by the way, to use to use MHRA style, but, of 
course, the Chicago U.P. nusekh is equally acceptable.

Subject:  eyer-kikhl

While reading Bashevis' "Di kafeterye," the Yale-New Haven Leyenkrayz came 
across "eyer-kikhl."  Can someone provide a description of precisely what 
kind of delicacy this is?
