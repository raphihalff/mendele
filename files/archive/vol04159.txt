Subject: Bonkele

To Soreh Benor:

I don't have anything very revealing to say about _bunshke_, but I'm told
that my grandmother used to call my mother _bonkele_ when she was a tot.
Makes you wonder...

Subject: Sholem Aleichem: Attention Deficit?

Re: Harvey Spiro's "Did Sholem Aleichem have Attention Deficit?"

I don't think there is any reason to conclude that Sholem Aleichem had an
attention span problem.  First of all: I caution against mistaking an
author for his characters.  E.g., there is no clue suggesting that
Shakespeare was crazily ambitious for power like Lady Macbeth or as
indecisive and depressed as Hamlet.  Mark Twain was neither Huckleberry
Finn nor Jim.  All art is autobiography, and there are author-character
identifications but not identities.  Sholem Aleichem labored over his
work for many hours and days and weeks in deeply concentrated attention.
This is evident from contemporary observers.  In addition to Yiddish and
Hebrew authors, and Talmud and Tanakh, Sholem Aleichem read the Russian
authors, and Mark Twain, Dickens, Thackeray, et al. in Russian
translation.  This _must_ have taken intense, concentrated attention.  He
neglected business affairs to great financial loss through attention to
his writing.  From my perspective, there is no reason to diagnose in
Sholem Aleichem an Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).
He made some rash decisions at times, but don't we all?  In early youth,
he hardly reread his own work before sending it off.  This changed as be
became an experienced writer, and often revised and re-edited.

As to Tevye, Sholem Aleichem makes him artfully change focus to back and
fill in and toss off revealing comments.  Tevye certainly pays attention to
the main thing: concern about feeding his family and maintaining his
"family values," but makes a mistake or two.  Further, in the Tevye
stories, there are two characters: Tevye the monologist plus Sholem
Aleichem the silent listener paying close attention through a a long story.
(Incidentally, in the original version of the first story, Sholem Aleichem
is _not_ silent).  The stories became tragic as the years go by.  Sholem
Aleichem continues patiently listening, very attentively.  In "An Eytse,"
Sholem Aleichem is again the listener, not the one seeking advice.  Sholem
Aleichem listens very attentively to the nudnik at first, but finally loses
both patience and temper, a rare occurrence.

Motl seems not unmanageable.  He is bright and observant and often
cooperative.  His language changes from childish to poetically adult, an
author's device.  Of course, as child, he changes focus, but from a
child's perspective the world demands attention in so many directions at
once.  The child better change focus to absorb what he needs to become a
mentsh.  I can only guess he did not need Ritalin, but that's up to
_very_ careful, experienced, attentive diagnosticians.

For insight into Sholem Aleichem, we ought to look at his life _and_
work. For one thing, his evident, much too close, identification with his
father led, in my opinion, to an earlier death than he might otherwise
have suffered.  See my article, "Was his Death Too Soon?" in "The Three
Great Classic Writer of Modern Yiddish Literature, Volume II,
Sholem-Aleykhem," Malibu, CA: Joseph Simon Pangloss Press, 1994, p. 17.

Subject: Yiddish Sentence Revised as Criticized

A Mendele member wrote that he "stopped reading Mendele a while back
because [he] was sick of the grammarians" (4.119,4).  Then he "flamed" me
for having the audacity of analyzing critically a Yiddish sentence in
Steven Pinker's recent book _The Language Instinct_ (4.118,1).  He
continued:  "Boy, things are getting worse.  Poor Pinker, the MIT
linguist, gets slammed... all because of a few words in Yiddish about
grandmothers, grandfathers, and balls.  A shande, I tell you."

Well, if you and I can  be corrected for faulty spelling and incorrect
grammar, why not--especially--a linguist?

Pinker himself did not find it a "shande," nor a "kharpe".  In his reply
in Mendele (4.129,1) there was no indication whatsoever that he felt the
least bit insulted, and no sign at all of any degree of defensiveness.
He wrote: "I was _amused and enlightened_ (Italics added) to read the
recent discussion in Mendele (kindly forwarded to me by several
colleagues)... and I had already received several letters, pointing out
that [the sentence] was puzzlingly nonstandard."  He added that he
already changed the words and spelling of the sentence to the YIVO
standard, for the next edition.

In an E-mail letter I asked him to advise me the revised sentence, with
permission to publish it in Mendele.  Back came his prompt and friendly
reply:  He has no objection to discussing his revised sentence in
Mendele.

This is the new, revised text:

      Az di bobe volt gehat beytsim volt zi geven mayn zeyde.

Mendele readers may recall that this revision corresponds exactly with my
word analysis of the original mangled sentence ("Az der bubbe vot gehat,"
4.118,1).
