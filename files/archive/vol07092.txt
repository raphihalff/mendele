Subject: Der Yiddisher Pinafore

In response to Larry Mitchel's query about obtaining the libretto of _Der
Yiddisher Pinafore_ (Vol. 07.088) I should like to make a general statement of
policy both to Mr. Mitchel and to others who may have similar needs.  I've
received scores of requests for Yiddish G&S material since I began this
project in the mid 80's and have had to tell people that the situation is as
follows:  I wrote the Yiddish "Pinafore" lyrics for The Yiddish Light Opera
Company of Long Island and I have a contractual arrangement with them. I
receive a royalty each time Yiddish "Pinafore" is presented.  The company is
very protective of this property and it is therefore not possible to send
anyone the libretto.  On the other hand if someone has a very special need,
say to include an excerpt or two in a concert or recital, he/she should send
me an e-mail (savoyid@aol.com) and I will try to arrange with the company for
permission to comply.  

The situation is considerably brighter with Yiddish "Pirates of Penzance" (_DI
YAM GAZLONIM_).  I am, as yet, under no contractual obligation with "Pirates".
However, Zalmen Mlotek, who is preparing to mount a professional production of
_Di Yam Gazlonim_ , is seeking financial support for the huge budget that such
a project entails.  Accordingly, we have been sending portions of the libretto
and of the musical score (and sometimes entire scripts and scores - depending
on what we perceive as the level of interest) to potential "angels" or
investors who wish to examine the material.  We also send out the resume of a
prolific TV filmmaker (Abba Eban's "Heritage,Civilization and the Jews",
"Creativity With Bill Moyers", "Challenge to America With Hedrick Smith" and
about 35 other widely viewed documentaries) who will be filming a TV
documentary of every aspect of this production once it is under way. He has
already shot an hour of raw footage interviewing us and having us sing
excerpts of Yiddish "Pirates" in Zalmen's music room at The Workmen's Circle.
Those who wish to support this project (which has the potential of being
enshrined in a Public Television documentary) should send me a message and
I'll reciprocate as stated above.  Or else, please call Zalmen at (212)
889-6800 ext. 207.  Those outside of New York State call Zalmen's toll free #
1-800-922-2558 ext.207.

Subject: Shmerke Katriginski

A friend is looking for works by a poet named Shmerke Katriginski [[probably 
Kaczerginski/Katsherginski (1908-1954) --Mendele moderator]] (no idea if 
that's the right spelling). We think he was writing in the 1920s to 1940s.
Ideally, side-by-side yiddish and english would be great, but if not either
language alone would also suffice. If you have any citations for this author,
please let me know.

Thank,
Faith Jones

Subject: "schmooze".

In response to Ethan Hollander's query [07.091] I will venture the guess that
"schmooze" comes from "shmues", which - from my mittlshul days - I believe
means "conversation" (without negative connotation such as "gossip"), and with
a verb version, "shmuesn".

Subject: schmooze

Re Ethan Hollander's question [07.091] there are three meanings in german
language:

1) schmusen - to cuddle (in german)
2) Schmu [hebr.-jidd.] to behave in harmless but not correct way
3) Schmu reden - (austrian) to talk just for talking, without deeper sence,
trying to be nice, typical austrian kind to talk

Subject: Mendele Review in Yiddish

In the Mendele Review (Vol. 01.024), Leonard Prager writes: "Mendelyaner who
wish to read _TMR_'s romanized Yiddish texts in Yiddish will now be able to do
so (provided they have the proper hardware and software)." I'm interested. Is
more information forthcoming?

Subject: Schmozzing 

Ethan Hollander mentions [07.091] that on use of the word "schmooze" may be
likend to "kissing-up" someone.  In that respect, he is right on the mark.
The German schmooze is the slang equivalent of "necking."

Subject: Weinreich et al.

Sylvia Schildt writes [07.091]: "the new theories should not only be
linguistically cohesive -- they need to jibe with other subjects -- for
instance, the story of Jewish migrations. Herein lies the greatness of
Weinreich."

I don't wish to quibble about Weinreich's greatness, but two things need to be
added:

(1) For some reason (actually we all know the reason, namely, the fact that he
wrote a well-known and deceptively accessible book), Weinreich is often the
only one of the great Yiddishists that non-linguists and even many linguists
know about.  But Saineanu, Fischer (later name Bin-Nun), Birnbaum, and at a
slightly lower level Beranek, Prilutski, even Sapir, are some other names that
should not be forgotten.  Above all, we should not allow W's greatness to 
influence us as to accepting his theories or arguments, many of which are by
modern standards completely unacceptable.

(2) It IS important that linguistics jibe with history, but Weinreich -- and I
dont think this is or can be controversial--allowed a received view of history
(namely, that german Jews came from France) to impose conclusions for which he
had no linguistic evidence.  Of course, he was not alone: Fischer and Birnbaum
seem to have made the same assumptions.

Subject: davenen

Dovid Braun writes [07.091]: "I see another problem:  whence the -nen?"

This is a good question, but it presupposes that all verbs of this sort have
stems in -n- as well as ones in -e-. I do not know this to be correct.  If it
is, I would like to have this information, and then indeed we would have a
problem.

There is, however, a bigger problem anyway, which is to account in general for
all these verbs.  A lot of people have tried over the years, but teh problem
is still open. If it is true that stems in -n- like darshn- are connected to
nouns like darshn (as Birnbaum, Wexler, Jacobs, me, and perhaps others) think,
then there is another possible problem for the etymology i have been
defending, and one I had not thought of until Dovid raised his objection.
As usual, more research seems to be called for.
