Subject: Weinreich's Say It In Yiddish

Ikh bin maskim mit Rick Turkel un zayn meynung vegn Al Grand's opshatsung fun
dem artikl "Say it in Yiddish" fun dem (June-July 1997) numer fun Civilization.
Ikh hob gekrogn dem zhurnal umzist a dank der Delta Shuttle vos git avek
zhurnaln tsu zeyere pasazhirn in zeyer terminal in LaGuardia luftfeld. Ikh bin
bemes ibergerasht tsu leyen aza min artikl in a zhurnal vos iz aruysgegebn fun
aza bekovediker institutsye vi di amerikane Library of Congress.  

Ikh bin nit zikher tsi der mekhaber - Michael Chabon - veyst ver zenen di
Weinreichs un zeyer arbet legabe yidish.  Er heybt on un ikh tsitir "Probably
the saddest book that I own is a paperback copy of Say It in Yiddish edited by
Uriel and Beatrice Weinreich."  

Shpeyter in dem artikl shraybt er "What were they thinking, the Weinreichs?  
Was the original 1958 Dover edition simply a reprint of some earlier, less
heartbreakingly implausible book?  At what time in history of the world was
there a place of the kind that the Weinreichs imply, a place where not only 
the doctors and waiters and trolley conductors spoke Yiddish buyt also the 
airline ticket clerks, travel agents, ferry7 captains and casino employees?  
A place where you could rent a summer home from Yiddish speakers, go to a 
Yiddish movie, get a finger wave from a Yiddish speaking hairstylist, a 
Yiddish speaking shineboy and have your dental bridge repaired by a Yiddish 
speaking dentist? If, as seems likelier, the book first saw light in 1958, a 
full 10 years after the founding of Israel - which turned its back once and 
for all on the Yiddish language, condemning it to watch its native speakers 
die off one by one in a headlong race for extinction with the 20th century 
itself - then the tragic dimensions of the joke looms larger and makes the 
Weinreichs' intentions even harder to divine. Say In In Yiddish seems an 
entirely futile effort on the part of its authors, a gesture of embittered 
hope, of valedictory daydreaming, of a utopian impulse turned cruel and 
ironic."

Di letste helft fun dem artikl iz a, zol men zogn, "vos volt geven" rayze in
uysgetrakhtn Yidishland.  

A por bamerkungen.  Ikh meyn az in 1958 hot men gekent, un afile in 1997, ken

Subject: Weinreich's phrase book - redux

In response to Ellen Prince's comments in Mendele 7.025 on my "irate response 
to Al Grand's discussion of the piece on the 'Say It in Yiddish' book," if you 
reread my remarks you will note that they related to the essay in 
_Civilization_, not the phrase book itself.  Everyone is entitled to his or 
her own opinion of the book, which probably is pretty amusing, given the 
context.  However, no one can deny, assuming Al Grand's original comments to 
be true, that the review belittles the history and culture of Ashkenaz, and I 
don't see how anyone who cares enough about Yiddish to belong to this list can 
find that anything but disturbing at the very least. 

As for Al Grand's sarcastic response to my comments, the latter were based on 
his review, which I took to be a more or less honest survey of the contents of 
the article.  Since I see no reason to assume the contrary, I don't see any 
positive purpose in supporting the publisher of such tripe, even if it is the 
Library of Congress, by purchasing a copy of that issue of _Civilization_.  
Clearly I don't stand alone; I received several email notes off-list praising 
my comments, including a copy of a lengthy letter to the editors of 
_Civilization_ by another mendele subscriber taking them to task for their 
unprofessional treatment of Yiddish culture.  Also, please note the comments 
of Mordkhe Schaechter right below yours in mendele 7.025.  To tell the truth, 
I'd much prefer to remain in their company than to join those who think 
Yiddish is some kind of joke, your comments notwithstanding.

A gut shabbos alemen.

Subject: More kvetching about NYBC

Like Sholem Berger, I'm a longtime member of the NYBC, and salute its
wonderful achievements. But they're not a sacred cow, and my experience has
not been that they have a "scholarly and helpful staff"- aderabe.  They do
pretend to be, among other things, a resource for scholars, yet, unlike the
invariably helpful YIVO staff, I've found their assistance disappointing.
For example, there was a drawing in a previous issue of their magazine, the
Pakn Treger, that related to a research interest of mine. I wrote to the
editor a courteous letter asking for the source of the drawing, if known.
Many months pass, and no reply. I sent a second letter, with a copy to Aaron
Lansky, requesting the information, and two months later still no reply.  If
they even had replied in a sentance "we don't know where this drawing was
from" or "we don't have the staff to reply to individual inquiries"---dayenu.  
But not to answer at all is a breach of scholarly courtesy, in my opinion.  
Somehow, I think I would have had a reply had I been a rich contributor, 
rather than one of modest means.  In this, NYBC reveals itself to be 
quintessentially American--"money talks".  This is of a piece with turning 
Yiddish culture into a suburban theme park.  YIVO, on the other hand, has 
remained true to the intellectual ideals of its Vilna past, and for that, 
more power to them.

Subject: Learning Yiddish
     
For the Mendelyaner who is learning Yiddish and asked about "hearing" Yiddish 
as well as seeing it written: the text for beginners Marion Herbst and I 
wrote, called LEARNING YIDDISH IN EASY STAGES not only has an answer book, but 
also a tape that pronounces the readings, exercises, and folksongs in the 
book.  It is available from the following sources: Jack Roth/Bookseller 
(Los Angeles): (310) 557-1848; National Yiddish Book Center: (800) 535-3595;
Workmen's Circle Bookstore: (800) 922-2558
