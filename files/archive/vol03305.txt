Subject: Sholem Aleykhem's yartzayt

Louis Fridhandler is right on the secular date and I was wrong.  It's May
13, not 2. Maybe I mixed in the birth date, Mar 2, 1859.  Zayt mir moykhl
dem toes.  Another case of "mail now, check later".

Subject: Advise to polyglots on learning Yiddish

For those who love learning languages and have experience in
self-education, let me relate how I learned Yiddish. Prior to Yiddish, I
had studied Hebrew and Arabic (I have an M.A. in Near East Lang & Lit),
French, German and yes, Esperanto. I'm mostly interested in reading and
have learned the last three languages mentioned in addition to Yiddish
purely by self-education and have read novels and/or verse in each of
them. So here goes, for Yiddish:

1) Obtain Uriel Weinreich's "College Yiddish" and read it-the whole
thing. Get a hold of a Yiddish-English dictionary, Weinreich's preferred,
but Harkavy's is good. A cheap and portable one, though not very good is
the paperback by D.M. Harduf, obtainable through the Workmen's Circle
Book Center. Also, I used Hebrew-English and German-English dictionaries
quite a bit. If you know German, learning to recognize the Yiddish
spelling of German words helps immensely.

2) Find a novel or short-story in Yiddish with a translation. Here's what
I did. I found a Yiddish novel entitled Di Gas (The Street) by Yisrael
Rabon (Israel Rabon) and plodded my way through sentence by sentence,
often reading aloud (don't worry too much about pronunciation at this
point). This is quite an interesting novel, but of course any novel or
short story (along with the same one translated into English) will do. In
my case, I was carrying around two books on the bus too and from work
each. When you finish this you'll be on your way.

3) Get a subcription to the Yiddish-language Forvarts ($36/year) or at
least buy some issues on the newstand. It helps in learning the language
of the living world, not just literary language. Also, approximately
every other weekly issue has a literary page "Perls fun Yiddishe Poezia,"
with poems (and stories about the poets) as well as songs, letters from
readers and  so forth. It is a must in my estimation.

4) Join and become active in a Yiddish club in your town or city. Find
out if there is one through the local synagogues or JCC's.

5) Stick with it. It's rewarding. However, take a break once in a while
in a while so you don't get burned out.

kreplach filled with cottage cheese and floating in milk-soup, with
dollops of sour cream...

and occasionally filled with *ground-up meat!

And from a Pesach cookbook to boot!

I guess the haskole was more widespread than I imagined.

Subject: A Pesach-cum-recipe-cum-Yiddish question

I seek a Yiddish word or a Yiddish expression that I have forgotten. At
this time of the year my grandmother always prepared her matzoth in a
special way and the word for matzoth prepared in that fashion is what I
seek.

She would get a pot of water boiling, run cold water over the matzoh, and
then steam it over the boiling water for perhaps 10-15 seconds for each
side.  Then it was coated with butter or schmaltz depending on what else
we were eating and it was (and still is delicious).

Anyway, how were matzoth prepared this way referred to in Yiddish?

I always thought that it was only my grandmother who made them this way
(though I must admit I did not do a lot of looking into other people's
kitchens to find out how they preferred their matzoth).  And the people I
would ask about this as I got older looked at me as if I were trying to
inquire about where to buy a size 14 bustle frame whenever I would speak
of "steaming matzoh."

But my daughter works at a place that has a number of Russian immigrants
and as Passover approached, one of them mentioned that, in Russia, she
had them steamed in exactly the same way as I described (and which my
daughter loves).  So clearly the practice of steaming matzoh was more
widespread than I thought.

But what Yiddish word describes them?  My grandmother always referred to
them as being refreshed or "frished auf" but that is not the name of the
thing, only a description of what was done to it.

Now that your childhood memories have been awakened, remember, only 10-15
seconds per side over boiling water.  Then butter at once and eat at
once.  No delay or the thing petrifies!!  And the matzoh must be wet
before steaming.

Subject: Introduction

My name is Matt Dailey.  I am a graduate student in Yiddish and Hebrew at
the Ohio State University.  My Yiddish interests are in the area of
Yiddish religious literature, in particular those items written for
women, like the tkhines.  My Hebrew training is in the area of Biblical
Hebrew and Comparative Semitics.  I am looking forward to interacting on
Mendele, and hope to hear from my colleagues soon.

Subject: Grayever folkslid

Mikhl Herzog:

I don't remember the khazn or the label, but I'm pretty sure the Grayeve
recording you are thinking of is "Dray yor a libe gefirt" (or, as they
say on the recording itself, "Dray yor a wibe gefirt"), an American
Yiddish recording of the late 78-rpm era (late 40s-early 50s), at least
the copy I know. There is a spoken intro at the beginning, to the effect
of: "'Dray yor a wibe gefirt': a idishe folkslid fun grayever gegnt,
gezungen in ortikn dialekt," and then the 'w's and final 'i's fly fast
and furiously.

A number of years ago, the record was in the collection of Carol Freeman,
a singer of Yiddish and Balkan music living in lower Manhattan. If you'd
like, e-mail me directly and I'll put you in touch with her.

A gutn meyd (so to speak),
