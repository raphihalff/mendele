Subject: Argentine YIVO

Yesterday's New York Times (July 21) stated that the YIVO was spared
destruc- tion, but that the archives of AMIA were destroyed.  Zachary or
anyone else: what's the correct version?

Subject: More on the bombing in BA

Some more news regarding the bombing of the AMIA building in Buenos
Aires, where the Argentine YIVO was situated.  On Friday (July 22nd)
Larry Rubinstein, Executive V.P. of YIVO in New York had a phone
conversation with Shaul Brajer, who is associated with YIVO in BA. Brajer
(prounounced Brakher) says that the front part of the building was
completely destroyed, but that the rear section is more intact.  The
surviving portion of the YIVO Library (in the rear) is still surrounded
by rubble.  Perhaps as much as half is potentially salvageable, but it
will be about a week before that can be verified, since the emphasis now
is naturally on recovering bodies buried underneath the collapsed
sections of the structure. I spoke yesterday with Shoshana
Balaban-Wolkowicz, former librarian of the BA YIVO (now living in the
U.S.).  She says that part of the YIVO Archives was also located in the
rear of 633 Pasteur, so it is conceivable that it might also be partly
intact.  A special fund for the reconstruction of the Buenos Aires YIVO
has been set up.  Contributions may be sent to the following address:

CITIBANK, 111 Wall Street, New York, NY 10043.  for:  EXPRINTER
INTERNATIONAL BANK, N.V., account no. 36083629, reference no.
11159, in the name of INSTITUTO CIENTIFICO JUDIO - IWO - ARGENTINA.

In Saturday's NY Times there is a brief article noting that a Shiite
group, Partisans of God, based in Lebanon, has claimed responsibility for
the bombing.

Subject: Bodies of water

To: Peter Kluehs

In Eastern Yiddish "taykh", diminutive "taykhl/tekhl" does, indeed, mean
'river'; a synonym, of more limited distribution, is "bokh". A small
"taykh"  may also be designated "ritshke" or "zhitshke". A variant of
either "ozere" or "sazhlke" designates the "standing body of water" for
which modern German uses Teich.

How come? I don't have the sources at hand now, but you should consult
medieval (rather than modern) German sources, and German dialectal
sources (Kluge, Kretshmer, DSA, Zeitschrift fuer deutsche Philologie,
etc.) These are apt to provide a better explanation for the divergence.
Let us know what you discover.

Subject: Rashi glosses

To: Bob Werman

Bob, does Rashi actually introduce Yiddish glosses with the designation
"belaaz", or does your reference to such glosses as "laazim" follow from
the assumption that "laaz" is an acronym (for "leshon am zar[a]")? I know
that the acronym explanation is part of our "received wisdom" but, what
if it's not true?

Isn't it the case that wherever Rashi himself introduces a gloss with
"belaaz", it's followed by a word of Romance origin? That's why Max
Weinreich uses the term Laaz to designate the Jewish correlates of Old
French and Old Italian, whence the "Laazic" component of Yiddish. By the
way, is it invariably written as "roshe-teyves",i.e. bla"z?

Finally, aren't what you call Rashi's "Middle High German" glosses
introduced by the "roshe-teyves" bl"a, i.e. "beloshn ashkenaz"? Why
assume that "loshn ashkenaz" is Middle High German? Why not Yiddish? The
best scholarship on the subject of Rashi's Yiddish glosses is Erika
Timm's (University of Trier). I doubt that she'd accept them as MHG. Was
there any other designation for Yiddish at that time?

What say you?

Subject: Ladijin

I'm new to mendele and wonder if there is anyone out ther e who might
have any information aboutthe town of Ladijin.  I was born there, came to
US at age 6 months.  When my brother visited Russia he did visit Ladijin
which is larger than a shtetl now but could find no signs of Jews who
ever lived there.  Ladijin is part of the Ukraine.  Also does anyone have
any info on the writer Linetsky.  My grandmother came from the town of
either Vinnitsa or Uman (I don't know which) and I understand that
Linetsky is from one of these two towns.  A shenem daynk un gut shabos

Subject: Havdole

To David Kazdan and Mikhl Herzog,

Thank you very much for telling me about the Havdole prayer "Got fun
Avrom." I cannot find it in any of the prayerbooks in my house, and I am
not likely to be in an urban center soon where i might find it. Would
Zachary Baker or Shames Noyekh be good enough to send me a copy of the
text either by e-mail in transcription or to my postal address in Yiddish
writing?

Subject: Havdole

My source (Tikkun Asher) writes that this was found among the manuscripts
of Rebbe Levi Yitzkhok of Berditchev, that it was considered a segula
g'dola l'hatzlacha and that it is recited three times by men and women.
I've tried to "match" the spelling throughout.
