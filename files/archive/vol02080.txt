My assumption is that this is a subjunctive -- without
having at hand any exact description of its forms and use
in Yiddish.  After all, such forms occur sporadically and
relictally (in subordinate clauses of various kinds) even
in English!

Zev Bar-Lev

On vi helf nor got:

Surely enough this is a vestige of modal verb forms,
surviving only in formulaic expressions, like: got helf,
bay im blayb es, loz er nor pruvn, etc.

(1) Shloyme Axelrod asks about a Yiddish proverb:
 Got vet helfn - vi helft nor Got biz Got vet helfn.
                       ^^^
This is how it appears in Bernstein's collection (#668),
the source for Ayalti, as well as for all other
collections. Ayalti, in his usual sloppy style dropped the
-t. Bernstein's collection of Yiddish proverbs, the most
comprehensive such work, will be reviewed soon by Dave
Sherman.
 
(2) Incidentally, the above mentioned Bernstein has
(#3030): "Er iz a zwei-un-funfzignik", and the explanation
is that he is a dog (kelev = 52)
 
(3) For H. Bershady, about "nimis un muvis": Hebrew nim'as
= disgusting. mavet = death.
 
(4) Regarding the name "shpetter": There is a new book
published by Ktav, compiled by Heinrich Guggenheimer. It is
supposed to be the most comprehensive work on Jewish names.
Our copy hasn't arrived yet, but perhaps one of my fellow
librarians on Mendele might want to check it.

Subject: nimes umoes

Harold Bershady's NIMIS UND MUVIS in Standard Yiddish is
NIMES UMOES, which means something like 'boring and
disgusting beyond endurance.'  In many contexts 'es iz mir
nimes umoes' is felicitously translated by 'I'm sick of
it.'

Subject: NIMIS UND MUVIS

Hershel Bershady asks in Mendele Vol 2.79 about the two
title terms.

I never heard the expression, but 'nimis' must be from the
Hebrew 'nimas' (nun-mem-alef-samekh), meaning
'contemptible, abhorrent, despised.' 'muvis' is most
certainly from Hebrew 'maves/mavet' (mem-vav-tav), and
means 'death.'  I can easily see how they would be used
together for emphasis.
