Subject: Ashkenazic Studies

These critical thoughts were inspired by a call for papers
[Announcements (3/12/97)] for a forthcoming conference in Poland
inaugurating a new field called Ashkenazic Studies .  The positive
aspects of this inaugural conference are fairly obvious.  It offers a
belated response to Sephardic Studies. It suggests a way out of the
impasse of dedicating one's life to Yiddish language and culture.  It
is surely no accident that most of the "big name" academics in the
field (including myself, I suppose), have hyphenated careers:  Yiddish
and psychoanalysis; Yiddish and Hebrew; Yiddish and modernism; Yiddish
and politics, and so on.  By redefining what we do in terms of
"Ashkenaz," we broaden and deepen our scope.  We also send a very
clear message to the few historians of medieval Ashkenaz that they
cannot ignore the study of Yiddish.  The unspoken ideological agenda
of "Ashkenazic Studies," however, is to offer a counterweight to
Zionism.  As the prose accompanying the Call for Papers makes
eminently clear: Ashkenaz stands for language, culture, and land.  The
fact that it no longer exists is precisely what makes it so
attractive. It is easier to claim than the messy geopolitical present.
Ober nisht dos bin ikh oysn.

To be a true scholar of Ashkenaz, there are five areas that one must
master: (1) Khumesh mit Rashi, the foundational document of all of
Ashkenazic culture; (2) Talmud with Tosefos, the core of the elite
culture; (3) medieval Muser literature, the most popular form of
Jewish self-expression throughout the history of Ashkenaz; (4)
Mysticism; and (5) the Yiddish language.  Of all these areas, which
are inextricably bound together, I can claim some expertise only in
the last.  In this lifetime, I fear, I will never be counted among the
true scholars of Ashkenaz.

Subject: Nivl-pe

The attempts [6.283ff] to explain away the pronumciation of _nibl-pe_
as _nivl-pe_ are probably in vain. Not only does Harkavy register
_nibl-pe_, but so do Stutchkoff and Birnbaum. It appears that Sam
Weiss is referring to an alternative compound from _nivul_ 'ugliness'
+ _pe_. _nivul_ is spelled with vov, rather than veyz.The interchange
of _nibul_ and _nivul_ is is found in The Talmuds, though not in the
compound _nibl-pe_.

_nivl-pe_ is a Yiddish innovation for all we know.

Subject: Nivl-pe

The question of the pronunciation "nivl pe", as against "nibl pe", has
been discussed in recent Mendele postings.

Could the occurence of "nivl pe" in Yiddish be due to confusion of two
different (though Even-Shoshan writes that they are etymologically
related) Hebrew words? "Nibul" (nun, beyz, vov, lamed) means
obscenity, repulsiveness etc. according to Alcalay's dictionary and
from it there comes the usual Hebrew term for obscenity and its usual
Yiddish cognate.

"Nivul" (nun, vov, vov, lamed) is translated by Alcalay as disgrace,
ugliness and so on.

In view of their similarity in both sound and meaning these two words
might easily be confused by a Yiddish speaker who knows Hebrew well
leading to the pronunciation "nivl pe".

Interestingly Tsanin, in his Yiddish-Hebrew dictionary gives the
Yiddish form as "nivl pe", that is he spells the Yiddish word nun,
veyz...(not nun, beyz...) giving the Hebrew translation as "nibul peh"
(nun, beyz...). Perhaps "nivl pe" is the way that he grew up
pronouncing the word. In addition to variation between individual
speakers could there be an element of regional dialect variation in
the use of the two forms?

Subject: Yiddish in Yiddish letters

I have just sent a posting to Mendele in which I had to spell out
various Yiddish and Hebrew words letter by letter. Everybody on the
list uses this clumsy procedure when the need arises. At present there
is no alternative. That is one reason why it would be helpful to be
able to use the Jewish letters on Mendele. Another reason is that many
of the postings on the list are written in Yiddish. People vary in the
system of transcription which they use and this sometimes leads to
difficulties. In addition there is a less tangible, perhaps
sentimental, but in my opinion no less important reason for preferring
the Yiddish alphabet. For the last one thousand years Yiddish has been
written almost exclusively using the Jewish letters. It is a pity not
to continue that millenial tradition on the information superhighway.
And apart from those reasons I personally just can't get used to
reading Yiddish in English letters---I'm sure other Mendele
participants must feel that way.

I know that this question has been discussed before on the list. At
least one person has pointed out that there are Hebrew mailing lists
(the ones I know of are Mikhtav and Doar) and that they use Hebrew
letters. The system of Hebrew e-mail which they use could also be used
for Yiddish. A few months ago I sent a posting to Mendele in which I
suggested what I subsequently realised was a completely wrong-headed
solution to the problem.

It is clear that all the postings on the list have to exist in English
letters (as they do now). Not everone knows the Yiddish alphabet and
not everyone has a computer system which can display the Jewish
letters. However, I should like to suggest the following alternatives:

1. That posters to Mendele be offered the option of sending (as an
e-mail attachment to their message containing their English-letter
posting) a file using Yiddish letters. This attached file could use an
ASCII-based Hebrew format (as in Mikhtav and Doar) or else it might
use a word processor format (such as that of Hebrew Word for Windows
or Dagesh).

2. That if they wished to do so posters might submit a Yiddish-letter
version of of their posting as well as the English-letter posting and
the Yiddish-letter version would appear in the body of the list (using
ASCII-base Hebrew format) for those are able to read it.

One can envision other possible solutions such as a WWW version of
Mendele using Hebrew HTML (a problematic subject in itself, I know).

What do other people think about this?
