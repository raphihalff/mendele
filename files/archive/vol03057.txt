I have heard it in Switzerdutsch (?-"deutsch") and Alsatian.

Subject: introduction

I'm no linguist, and have only recently begun an informal
self-course in Yiddish. But over the past few years I've been trying
to translate and edit my grandfather's Yiddish history of his native
town, "di shtat Keidan," published in 1930 by the Keidaner Farein of
New York. Among the things I learned from this was that zeyde (who
died in 1941, nine years before I was born), had collected folk
songs in his youth, and was a major contributor to the 1901 book
published by Ginsburg and Marek.

Baruch Chaim Cassel was a stolz Keidaner, and was quite put out that
the G.-M. book credited the songs he had collected as merely from
"Kovne gubernie" rather than Keidan. In 1990 I brought this to the
attention of Chana Mlotek at Yivo, who put me in touch with Dov Noy
at the Hebrew University. The result was a footnote on p. 85 of
Noy's re-issued (1991) Ginsburg-Marek (Bar-Ilan U. Press), which
corrects this 90-year literary mistake.

Sadly, the 1901 Ginsberg-Marek contained only lyrics; the money
apparently ran out before they could publish the accompanying music.
I'm hopeful that someday I'll turn up at least some of the tunes; my
dream is to resurrect zeyde's music for his great-grandchildren, now
aged 4 and 2.

I've also got some grist for any Sholem-Aleichem scholars out there,
in the form of 6 letters from S-A to my grandfather in New York in
the period 1906-1908. (Some of these were published last year by
Itche Goldberg in Yiddishe Kultur.) They mainly concern an attempt
to translate and publish several works, including "The First Jewish
Republic" and "Motl Peyse dem Khazan's" in the U.S. Nothing ever
came of it, so far as I can tell; probably it was one of many
not-too-successful ventures my merchant scholar-Zionist grandfather
tried over the course of three decades. But they may be of some
interest. For my part I'd like to find someone  with detailed
knowledge of S-A in that period, in the interest of establishing
context and possibly shedding some light on my grandfather's early
life.

Anyway, I've got translations of the 1930 history, along with some
delightful zichroines from other Keidaners of that period, available
to be posted or emailed if anyone is interested....

Subject: German the Fifteenth Semitic Language?

The College Edition of the Harper-Collins German-English
English-German Dictionary (1990) defines *Ganove* as
"umg[angssprachlich=colloquial] crook", and *Edelganove* as
"gentleman criminal".  Can the Germanicists on Mendele tell us
whether the similarity to Hebrew/Yiddish ganev/ganef is
coincidental? If not, did German acquire these umg. words from the
Yiddish or from the Hebrew?

Subject: philologus and water buffalo

i meant to write this last week but was giving noyekh a little rest,
nebekh. however, i do want to say that the philologus article on
penn and water buffalo was not the most responsible journalism one
could hope for.

first, it was never claimed that the influence at
work was yiddish. the student was born in israel and went to a
hebrew-based school here and it was hebrew that was at issue.

second, no one 'found him innocent'--the complainants withdrew the
charges, not inconceivably under pressure from above, which was not
inconceivably more inspired by hackney's confirmation as head of neh
than by a sense of fairness. (hackney is the president of penn, in
case anyone is lucky enough to have missed that.) therefore, the
case is not closed in the way that a real case that had run its
course would be, and jocular and/or sloppy discussion, in the very
newspaper that first ran the story and started the world-wide
tararam nokh, is really not a great idea.

third, i forget the precise wording but something like 'counsel for
the defense' led me to infer that philologus is not aware that there
was NO counsel for the defense ALLOWED. this is a serious case, at
least to the young man whose college career and therefore future is
on the line, and it really should be treated as such by journalists,
even ones who hide behind pseudonyms.
