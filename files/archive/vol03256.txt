Subject: A Purim lid

Tayere Mendlnikes:

Miriam Isaacs asks me to seek among you for the words to a Purim lid
vos zi hot gehert fun ir mamen. siz do transcripirt oyf  ir loshn:

A gitn purim malakh
vi ikh gay falakh
der burd iz mir lang
das vab iz mir krank
--------------------
---------------------
Gib mir a grushn un varf mir aras.

Efsher kenen Meyshe Alpert oder Eli Kats undz aroyshelfn? Anander
inyen--"feygl" My brother used to hang around in greenwhich village
and informed me that there were many bars with bird names that were
predominately "gay" bars. They were called "the bird circuit". also
in Yiddish literature and folk songs there are references to
"kanarik" and "kanarikl" which strongly suggest effeminancy. Any
connections you linguists and folklorists?

Subject: Nasality

If I take Roth's writing of manseh, as cited by Philologus, to mean
a fully articulated dental or alveolar n-consonant, I must agree
with Zachary in not ever having heard it for Yiddish mayse. If,
however, this is simply Roth's way of trying to make English
orthography convey an impression of some kind of nasality in
utterance of that word, it is a different kettle of fish. I do
indeed know of people who pronounce mayse with nasalization of the
diphthong ay~: may~se (the tilde, which should be over the [a],
means nasalization of the vocalaic stretch, the diphthong). At The
University of Connecticut, Arnold Dashevsky, the scion of a
Philadelphia Yiddishist family, always pronounces the word that way
at our Yiddish luncheon meetings.

The topic of nasality in Yiddish words spelled with ayin has come up
before in Mendele. In a name like Yankel, even if originally it
started with nasality in the vowel [a], it seems to have undergone
assimilation to the consonant [k] yielding a dorso-velar consonantal
articulation that we render in roman script as -ng.

Subject: Maynses etc.

Am surprised that Zachary Baker finds "maynses" in Roth's novel to
be curious.  That's the only way it was pronounced in my family (of
Ukrainian origin), in such phrases as "bobe-maynse" and "a maynse on
an ek". In my partner's family, Galitsianers, it was pronounced
"manse", just like Roth. I never heard of "mayse" until I began the
formal study of Yiddish with Weinreich's text--undoubtedly a
Litvakism (??).

There's a word that's puzzled me for years, that's perhaps Yiddish.
There was a child's game we played in Brooklyn in the '50s, a
variation on hide and seek, in which one of the players would trace
the outline of a face on the hider's back, before running to hide.
What was said, in doing this, was "make a shimmelekha on the old
man's back." What could this be?  From shimml plus lekhe(l) "moldy
little hole".  Any surmises, or anyone else who knows this word?

Subject: 'klezmer'

to: meyshe alpert

oy, that was a line to remember: 'funny, you don't look klezmer'!!!
since the beginning of its revival, i found something a bit weird
about the use of 'klezmer music', but i couldn't put my finger on
what it was, other than that it was being used to denote a much
broader range of music than originally. very very funny, meyshele!

of course, the problem with 'jewish' being broader than 'yiddish' is
not unique and, also, not solved. it's not unique since the same
sort of problem arises with many other terms, e.g. french people
also speak breton and provencal, italians speak sardinian and
sicilian and piemontese and..., etc. and it's not solved, at least
not IN yiddish, since 'yidish' still means BOTH 'jewish' AND the
traditional language of the ashkenazi jews. what are you gonna do...

btw, there's a funny sort of naming crisis wrt french these days.
'french literature' conventionally denotes the literature of france,
plus belgian and swiss lit in french. but what about the literature
in french of canada? of senegal? of cambodia? that has come to be
called, at least in academe, 'francophone' literature. so you get a
sort of paradoxical situation whereby balzac and proust aren't
francophone... go figure.

re 'yivo' and what it stands for, what do other people tell editors
who see it in your bibliography and want it 'spelled out'? they act
like i'm severely dyslexic when i tell them. in one instance, the
editor refused to believe me so i changed it from YIVO to Yivo,
trying to hide its bizarre acronym-ness.
