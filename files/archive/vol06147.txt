Subject: Acceptable Yiddish contractions

I have noticed what appear to be contractions submitted in Mendele. My
teacher, (mayn sheyne lerer), has taught me that the only acceptable
yiddish contraction is s'iz. (I hope I have spelled it correctly).

Is this correct?

Also I have spoken with my friend Joachim Neugroschel about submitting
in yiddish only. I would like to, but I am struggling with grammar and
conjugation. I encourage correction but I ask that my fellow submitters
forgive me for any frustrations I may create.

Subject: When does one become a Yiddishist?

I read, write and speak yiddish daily. I try to learn something new
daily. Does the love of the language and the active participation label
me as a yiddishist? Or is there more to it? If I am not one now I hope
to be soon.

Subject: Bakoshes

In response to Jeff Neiman's request in Mendele 6.141, the Yiddish word
for "penultimate" is "forletzt" as in "a forletzte zilbe fun a vort".
Source: "English-Yiddish Encyclopedic Dictionary", The Jewish Press
Publishing Co., New York, 1915.  Editor: Paul Abelson, Ph D.  P.1029.

I might add that this dictionary calls itself: "A Complete Lexicon and
Work of Reference in All Departments of Knowledge."  And it does seem to
live up to its claim in its over 1700 folio size pages.

Subject: A Slavonic component?

Although it is not related to Yiddish directly, I would like to comment
on one of the misstatements made by Jota Piasecki in "A Slavonic
component" post [6.145,1]. Piasecki writes : "...Slavic [? must be
Slavonic. Slavic people - but Slavonic tongues]." It is not true and
Zellig Bach's reference to the Slavic component of Yiddish is correct
(formally as well as conceptually).

Slavic and Slavonic are sometimes interchangable, but current common
usage is "Slavic languages". Examples include "American Association of
Teachers of Slavic and East European Languages", numerous textbooks and
journals in Slavic languages and linguistics, Departments of Slavic (not
Slavonic) Languages in most schools, including Lund University, where
Piasecki's e-mail address is located. On the other hand, The School of
Slavonic and East European Studies at the University of London is
significantly involved in research and teaching of regional social
sciences and history.

Subject: Slavic determinant in Yiddish

Regarding Jota Piasecki's post concerning the Slavic component of
Yiddish, even a casual reading of Max Weinreich's History of the Yiddish
Language (Geshikhte fun der yidisher shprakh) reveals that Slavic
languages -- especially Polish, Belorussian and Ukrainian -- had a
profound influence on Yiddish syntax as well as vocabulary.  Weinreich
refers to four "determinants" of Yiddish, which he describes as a
"fusion language": Hebrew/Aramaic, Romance, Germanic, Slavic.  While
Weinreich is by no means the last word in Yiddish linguistics, when all
is said and done he remains *something* of an authority...

I leave it to the Slavicists on this list to deal with this question in
greater depth, but on an anecdotal plane, when I was being tutored in
Russian some years ago, the teacher -- an experienced Yiddish
philologist -- chose to teach me through the medium of Yiddish, because
of what he viewed as the affinities between the languages, which extend
far beyond the realm of loan words and calques.
