Subject: RE: Mendele Vol 2.38

I think Dave Sherman has a reasonable complaint: the de
gustibus argument holds for him. However, I have always
tried to make a distinction that seems destined to fall
on stuffed ears, especially in our age of the arrogant
citizen's ego, which reacts irritably to any and all
criticism, out of anxious defensiveness, I surmise.

I recall a terrific argument I had with my sisterinlaw
years ago, decades ago. She just loved AN AMERICAN IN
PARIS, if that was the name of the movie musical with Gene
Kelly, a nonpareil hoofer himself. It won all the Awards
said she and she loved it. I said it was Crapola. She was
immediately upset: the snobbish poet and critic and
highbrow attacking the historian and sociology world of
utter middlebrow taste. That was in the year's of the first
fascination with lower/mid/highbrow, Dwight MacDonald's
leap into the first glimmering what is now known as
popular culture (aka, The People, and we know the source of
that mythology in bad Marxism, Cf Empson, the Pastoral
Myth).

At any rate, I said, I too enjoyed the movie immensely; but
it was nevertheless crapola. She couldnt see the distinction
between enjoying a form of entertainment and criticizing it
for what it is, objectively, as it were, on the basis of
canons of taste. NO use to point out that she might enjoy
the Van Gogh print, cheap, of sunflowers, but as an object
it was, well...

We spend our lives and efforts learning to discriminate
between better and worse, higher and lower, we learn to
dance, to draw, to play the piano or klezmer clarinet...but
let us remember, there is such a thing as connoisseurship,
and when an expert goes through a drawer of etchings say,
and shows us what is to be learned about this or that state
of an etching, this or that inking, this or that technique
in drawing and preparation, and some fetch high prices
because of value, and some because of rich overbidding,
but that junk doesnt necessarily sell at Sotheby's because
we LIKE it or enoy it, and the movie isnt good because it
grosses 300 millions, even though we might like it a lot. A
ride on a deathdefying rollercoaster is a great thrill,
bungee cord jumping from the Rio bridge ins Taos is a great
enjoyment, but AS A FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT OR ART...well,
when we watch the Olympics this week we will observe what
most of my writing students fail to observe: there is form
that wins, and form that comes in last, and though we might
enjoy the dash, the coaches do say this is the right way to
come off the blocks and this is the wrong way, and the same
with, say modern dance: there are fine dancers and clumsy
dancers, there are great ballerinas and danseurs nobles,
and so-so ones.

Art is art, and it has its fine degrees of excellence.
Still, one can delight in lindyhopping and even there,
well some can really or could really do it!  Travolta wasnt
much of a dancer, and there is a lot of lying. There is
Ella Fitzgerald and there are many lesser singers....and
we might like them all for pleasure. The same for Danny
Kaye and the Borscht Belt: Eddie Fisher was a pisher.

Anshel = Angel, No?
 
Ellen, there's some literature on the Yiddish/English
shmok/shmuck distinction (and their NON-RELATIONSHIP to
German Schmuck). I don't have access to the bibliography at
the moment but will be glad to quote chapt verse next
month.

Mikhl.

Subject: sex

Yiddish terms for "sex," "sexual intercourse," "have sex,"
and the like order themselves not only along a naughty-nice
axis, but along other axes as well. (I hope the linguists
on MENDELE will overlook my improvised terminology.) One
such axis--and and interesting one--is playful-earnest.
 
My informant, a native Yiddish speaker from Latin America,
a rebetsin wed to an orthodox, non-hasidic rosh-yeshive,
gives three terms (only) from her active vocabulary, viz.
"geshlekht" 'sex', "farker" 'sexual intercourse'--both
uttered in a serious near-whisper, and "makhn a mitsve" 'to
have sex/make love'--this latter uttered with a
non-embarrassed smile.
 
An unabashed lover of daytshmerish, I was delighted to hear
"geshlekht" and "farker"; for reasons entirely
non-linguistic, I was even more delighted to see this
committedly orthodox woman treat lovemaking not vulgarly,
but also without excessive earnestness.
