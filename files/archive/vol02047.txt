Subject: Galitsianer

A friend of mine who specializes in the history of
Ukrainian peasantry in Galiciabelieves that the various
nationalities of that region may have been stereotyped in
similar ways by their co-nationals elseware. Ukrainians
from Galicia, for example, are seen by other Ukrainians as
haughty, clever, good at driving a hard bargain, etc. Is
anyone aware of stereotypes of Galician Jews?  Such
stereotypes might be reflected in Yiddish fok sayings.

In reply to a query about the song my mother used to sing,
there is i record by Theodore Bikel in which he sings it
(with slightly different lyrics).

Subject: Introduction

I feel like an imposter introducing myself on Mendele, as I
really know no Yiddish beyond a few common words and
phrases. I'm here at the request of my brother, Hillel
Halkin; he does know Yiddish, but hasn't an INTERNET
connection, so I'm serving as an intermediary. We both live
in Israel, Hillel in Zichron Ya'akov, and I in Haifa. He
translates (Hebrew, mostly, but you may know his Sholem
Aleichem translation) and writes. I'm a reference librarian
at the Haifa University, subject specialist in psychology
and education.
 
The Mendele connection may motivate me to try to learn a
little Yiddish. I went looking in our library to see what
Yiddish textbooks we have, and came up with Uriel
Weinreich, which looks reasonable, although not really set
up for do-it-yourself. Is there anything better? Is there
anything on cassettes that's available either here or in
the U.S.? I'll probably be in NY over the Yamim Nora'im, so
if anyone knows of any good teach-yourself-Yiddish stuff,
I'd appreciate hearing about it.

Subject: Lachoudisch

The term Lachoudisch sounds familiar, but I'm not sure if I
can come up with the reference.  Someone once showed me a
book published in Germany, not too many years before
1981-82, when I saw it: a dictionary of the local students'
slang in a particular German city; the slang was based
mostly on Western Yiddish or Juedischdeutsch, though it was
used by non-Jewish students, who were not aware (I think)
that it was of Jewish origin, though their ancestors a
generation or two ago may very well have been.  I think it
was called something like Lachaudisch.

        I bet it's from the Yiddish/Hebrew word lakhodim,
which means 'retail', according to U. Weinreich's
dictionary.  It's also mentioned in M. Weinreich's History
of the Yiddish Language, p. 309.  It's spelled
lamed-alef-khes- daled-yud-mem, i.e. Hebrew la-aHadim 'by
ones'.
