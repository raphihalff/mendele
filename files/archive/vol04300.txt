matone_.

Well, of course, it's not whether *I* use it, but whether my wife, and
more importantly my in-laws, use it.  But to my ear they do.

Subject: Distribution and meaning of _konen_

I seriously underestimated the geographic extent of _konen_. At least in
the meaning 'to know how/to be able', it is almost universal, very often
alongside of _kenen_, in Southeastern Yiddish in Podolia, Bessarabia,
Rumania, in much of Galicia (East and West), in northwestern Poland, and
in central Belorus.

It appears to be unknown in northeastern Poland and in the neighboring
part of Belorus and Volhynia, in much of Latvia, and in northern and
eastern Belorus.

I have yet to systematically plot the distribution of _konen_ as 'to
know/to be acquainted with'. At first glance I see several instances in
which it occurs with this meaning alone, (perhaps alongside of _kenen_)
and several instances in which it occurs with both meanings. More anon.

Subject: Xmas eve

Eli Katz's posting concerning his father's designation for 'church' as
"al di blinde kloyster" is revealing. Was he a native of Vilna or did he
migrate there from the Ukraine? The almost universal designation for
Christmas eve in the Ukraine is _blinde nakht_, surely the result of the
same process of distortion that Eli describes. Slavists, please help.

If, as seems likely, "all saints" is the underlying model, how does it
get to Christmas eve. Doesn't _Alle Heiligen/Touts saints (sp?)
correspond to our Halloween?

Subject: Help with a yiddish word

I received the following letter today and wish to prevail upon my
fellow Mendelniks for a bisl hilf:

    "Dear Professor Weisberger,

     I had the pleasure of hearing you on Maine public radio this morning
     and immediately thought that perhaps you might be able to help me
     identify a certain Yiddish word that I've been searching for for
     some years.

     The word is used to describe an absolutely perfect and devastating
     retort to an insult or put down, but one which unfortunately comes
     to mind too late to be used (say a half hour after the insulter has
     left); the sort of thing that "I should have said..." Do you know
     this word?

Does anyone out there know what this refers to?

Adam Weisberger

Subject: Wooden synagogues

I too am interested in the preservation of the memory of synagogues, and
pursue this interest by collecting picture postcards of synagogues.  to
date i have over 500 synagogues depicted in postcards in my collection.
as an adjunct to this hobby, i research the history of these synagogues.
perhaps when i retire i'll try to codify this mass of synagogue lore into
a book.

the reason for this overlong personal prologue is twofold.  (1) i'd like
to hear from any other mendelniks with this (or a related) hobby, (2) to
inform those interested in wooden synagogues about a book entitled, oddly
enough, Wooden Synagogues, published by Image Publishing House (Z.
Yargina is listed as the author, and it may be a Russian publication), as
Volume 5 of their series, Masterpieces of Jewish Art  ISBN 5-86044-021-9

Subject: Curses

With respect to jewish curses, let me add to the bibliography the
following:

Blessings, Curses, Hopes and Fears: Psycho-Ostensive Expressions in
Yiddish, by James A. Matisoff, published in 1979 by the Institute for the
Study of Human Issues, Inc.  3401 Science Center, Philadelphia, PA 19104
ISBN 0-915980-94-0

He refers to a few interesting items:

Joe Singer, How to Curse in Yiddish: Entertain Your Friends! Terrify Your
Enemies!  published in 1977 by Ballantine Books, New York

G. Weltman and M. Zuckerman, Yiddish Sayings Mama Never Taught You,
published in 1975 by Perivale Press, Van Nuys CA  (a translation of
Ignacy Bernstein's Judische Sprichworter und Redensarten)

Sh. Bastomski, Baym Kval: Yidishe shprikhverter, vertlekh,
glaykhvertlech, rednsarten, farglaykhenishn, brokhes, vintshenishn,
kloles, kharomes, simonim, sgules, zabobones, published by the Naye
Yidishe Folksshul of Vilna in 1920.

by the way, any mendelniks out there who know what "kharomes" and/or
"zabbones" are, please chime in with translation/derivation.
