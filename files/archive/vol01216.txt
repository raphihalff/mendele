Dear Dr. Band,

Thanks for your suggestion.  Eli Yassif and I have
corresponded regarding Rosenberg and I have given him some
material which he graciously acknowledges in his preface.
He and I are not the only ones to be interested in
Rosenberg.  The list includes as well Yosef Dan, Moshe Idel
and Sid Leiman.  All the best,

Ira Robinson

Herr Noah,

was fuer eine brief introductory statement wollen Sie von
mir lesen? Anything I reveal about myself will be used
against me. I am originally from Hungary (booo), and work
at the Leo Baeck Institute (deytshen - double booo), as
cataloger and local computer guru. For the past two weeks I
have been searching for the origins of Herr Schlemihl and
Reb Schlimmazal, very confusing.

Regarding "eppes / etwas" (Mendele 1.215 item 2.) Being a
newcomer I do not know the rules of the game, but if one is
allowed to use books, the standard "Weinreich- dictionary"
(v. etwas) refers to eppes and also mentions "a bissl". No
doubt, that this is correct. Eppes comes from the old
Germanic *bis root, used also in English for that little
something that is either 1 or 0. Nothing unusual, that such
an archaic word survived on the fringes (like Swiss or
Yiddish) and disappeared from mainstream, although "ein
bisschen" (a bissl) is used regularly. Eppes is not related
to etwas, although they ended up meaning eppes the same
thing.

i've always thought that _epes_ represents a
straightforward evolution from _etvas_: first the _t_
assimilates to the labiality of the following _v_, giving
_epvas_, then the _v_ drops out.   something like english
_sumpin_ from _somethin'_ (but the aassimilation goes in
the reverse direction here).

if _etvas_ also exists in yiddish, it was probably
reborrowed from german, just as _filial_ is reborrowed into
spanish, parallel to the original and evolved _hijo_.

Subject: The Workmen's Circle Third Seder

As a member of the choir of the Workmen's Circle in New
York, I just wanted to take a few minutes of your time to
make a short report on the extensive but equally enjoyable
Third Seder which was held last Sunday at the Sheraton
Hotel in New York. It was an afternoon crammed full with
the finest of Yiddish song, dance, oratory and spirit. The
ballroom was crammed full with people of all ages, all with
a central love, namely Yiddish. The main speech was
delivered (in the most delightful Yiddish, of course) by
Joseph Mlotek who suffered a heart attack a few years ago
and now walks with the aid of a cane.

Many of our Russian brothers were present and for their
express benefit we sang a song called "N'ye Bayussiya"
written by a refusenik. The dance company accompanied the
song with a spirited rendition of the famous Russian-style
of dance and to say that it was a special hit would be a
gross understatement.

On the way out after the Seder was finished, I went over to
a woman in a wheelchair and asked her how she enjoyed the
performance. With her handkerchief in her hand she said: "I
cried from the first song to the very last one. Don't ask
me how I enjoyed it!"

It was a wonderful afternoon and I only hope that your
Passover is as zees as the Third Seder was.
