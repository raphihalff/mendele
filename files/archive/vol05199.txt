Subject: In memory of Julius Sokoloff

I is with deep sadness that share the news of the passing of Julius
Sokoloff.  Julius was a wonderful individual who understood the wholeness
of Jewish culture.  The following tribute was written by Helen Helfant,
Yiddish Culture Group in the Bernard Betel Centre, and appeared in the
Canadian Jewish News September 7, 1995 edition in Toronto:

Together with all the friends of Yiddish in our Jewish community, we
mourn the passing of Julius Sokoloff.  He was an intellectual blessed
with a sense of humor, a man of high integrity with unique abilities, who
gained the love and respect of all segments of our Jewish community
regardless of political differences.  His priority in life was the State
of Israel.  He grew up in the youth organization of the Zionist
Movement--Dror Habonim.  Already as a very young man he served in the
Bricha, an illegal Israeli group that was instrumental in helping the
survivors of the Shoah to immigrate to Israel, which was ruled by England
at that time.

In Toronto, Sokoloff was elected many times to the highest office of the
United Zionist Movement.  Thanks to his unusual abilities, in all
organizations in which he served, people lookep up to him, to his wisdom
in solving the most complicated problems of our times, especially in
regard to Israel, the land that he loves so much. Deeply concerned about
Jewish education, he was one of a few dreamers that brought to life the
unique Bialik School that serves hundreds of Jewish children, teaching
them the great values of Judaism.

A great admirer of Yiddish literature and the Yiddish language, he
successfully fought to bring Yiddish classes into Bialik School.  For the
same reason, as a lover of Yiddish, he joined the Yiddish Culture Group
in the Bernard Betel Centre, which he chared.  Under his leadership for
the last six years, the number of participants has doubled.

There is no substitute for people like Julius Sokoloff.  He will be
greatly missed by all of us.

Subject: Kestl-ovntn

We recently received a letter from a researcher who is studying Yiddish
secular schools in pre-World War II Poland.  Among other things she asked
for a description of "kestl-ovntn" (a term she came across during her
research).

As a graduate of the Minneapolis public schools during the 1960s, I
hadn't a clue about this term, so I asked two of my co-workers who
attended Yiddish schools in Vilna during the 1920s and 1930s. They
described "kestl-ovntn" as follows:

Students (in gymnasium, according to one informant) would place questions
of various types (personal, pedagogical, political) into a box, and a
committee of teachers would convene an assembly, where the questions
would be pulled out, one by one, and answered.

My questions are:  (1) Is this practice familiar to any Mendelyaner who
might be reading this?  If so, can you elaborate on it? (2) Were
"kestl-ovntn" a common practice in other Eastern European schools at that
time?  What were the terms used in other languages for these assemblies?
(3) Were "kestl-ovntn" held in American schools -- either Jewish or
otherwise?

Subject: Hershel of Ostropol

Published in late 1995: _The Adventures of Hershel of Ostropol_, retold
by Eric A. Kimmel, illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman, 64pp. NY: Holiday
House, $15.95 (ages 5 to 9).  I think the Ostropolyer part of the name
refers to someone who came from, or travelled through, Austria and
Poland. Efsher nisht.

Hershel Bershady

Subject: Hershel of Ostropol

Binyomin Weiner (5.198) asks about Hershele.

Ostropol or Ostropolye is a shtetl in Podolye due west of Berditchev.

In addition to the book mentioned by Hershel Bershady there are a number
of collections in Yiddish.  Zachary Baker (4.002) lists a collection
by M. Gershenzon published in Kiev in 1939.  There are at least two more:

_Hershele Ostropolyer der Velt Barimter Vitsling_, New York, Hebrew Pub-
lishing Company, n.d.

_Mayses, Vitsn un Shpitslekh fun Hershel Ostropolyer_ iberdertseylt fun
A. Holdes, Kleyne Bibliotek numer 6, Varshe, Farlag Yidish Bukh, 1960.
Iberdrukt fun Mlukhe-Farlag far Natsionale Minderhayten in USSR, Kiev,
1941.

Hershele was among other things court-jester to the Baal Shem Tov's
grandson, variously known as Rebbe Borukh of Medzibozh and Reb Borukhl
Tulchiner (1780-1811). Many of the Hershele stories center around Reb
Borukhl and his less than exemplary character.  Dubnov cites a tradition
that he was indirectly bringing about Hershele's death; another lays the
blame on Reb Borukhl himself.

Be that as it may, here is a question.  Reb Borukhl enjoys the singular
honor of being as far as I know of being the only rebbe whom the
_secular_ Yiddish literary tradition treats disparagingly.  True, there
are fictional rebbes (such as in I.J. Singer or Chaim Grade) who don't
come off too well, but historical rebbes are treated with respect by
Opatoshu, Tsvi Cahn and others.  Are the Hershele stories responsible for
this?
