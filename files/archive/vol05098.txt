Subject: Altfrenkish/altfraenkisch

The expression "altfrenkish" may have special connotations in Yiddish
including perhaps reference to Sephardic persons, but the word has a long
history in German, as a glance at the entry in Kluge-Goetze-Mitzka's
Etymologisches Woerterbuch (19th edition, p.17) shows. There the
expression is taken to have designated good old fashioned German customs
and people as opposed to  newly imported, 14th century, French courtly
customs. The article quotes Hugo von Trimberg's Renner, ca.1300: Man
sprichet gern, swen man lobet hiute, er si der alt frenkischen liute.

More about "altfrenkish":

The word is attested to in Y. M. Lifshits's "Yudish-Rusisher verterbikh"
(Zhitomir, 1876), where it is defined as "starinnyi, [sta?]rikovskii" (p.
23) = antique, old-fashioned.  (I could use some help from our
Slavicists.)

More importantly, "altfrenkish" appears in the "Groyser verterbukh fun
der yidisher shprakh" (vol. 3, p. 1371), with a rather long entry.  The
etymology given is "Mhd [Mittelhochdeutsch]:  alt- vrenkish."  The
definition:  "Altfeterish [=fartsaytik], nor genitst ofter un s'rov mit
baytam fun nit-gefeln."  A number of expressions are given
("a[ltfrenkish]e malbushim, a[ltfrenkish] mebl, a[ltfrenkish]er shteyger
fun mishpokhe-lebn").  The pedigree, as I suggested in my previous
posting, is venerable.  The earliest citation given is to a phrase in the
"Mayse-bukh," one of the classics of Old Yiddish literature:  "Er velt
sheyne fingerlekh koyfn un alt frenkesh ding, er zolt im nit tsu tayer
zayn." The first edition of the "Mayse-bukh" was published in Basel,
1602. (The edition cited is Amsterdam, 1700/01.) The "Groyser verterbukh"
then proceeds to give other citations appearing in western and eastern
Yiddish sources over the following centuries.  One of the later citations
given (for "altfrenkishkeyt") is from Yankev Glatshteyn/Jacob
Glatshteyn's "In tokh genumen": "Di altfrenkishkeyt fun Yehoyeshes
iberzetsung vet ersht krign nokh mer onzen."

Hakitser, "altfrenkish" is a common Yiddish word, used for centuries, and
attested to in numerous readily available reference sources.  (And it's a
good thing it's spelled with an alef, since the "Groyser verterbukh"
begins and ends with that letter.)

Subject: Goldfaden (was: Hotsmakh)

Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter was kind enough to call my attention to a fact of
Avrom Goldfaden's biography that I had misstated in my posting about
Hotsmakh (5.064).  I wrote that Goldfaden was "from Romania."  In fact,
as Dr. Schaechter writes, while it was in Romania that he established the
modern Yiddish theater, "geboyrn gevorn iz er in der ukrayine, deheyne
inem shtetl novo-konstantinov (nisht vayt fun zhitomir).  Oyf yidish hot
dos shtetl geheysn nay-kosntin... Avek fun der ukrayine iz Goldfaden in
elter fun etlekhe un draysik."

Subject: Gesosn

In Mendele 5.077 Rick Gildmeister passed on the following joke:

   A Litvak joins the army, and it's time to do rifle practice. Guns are
   blazing, and then the sergeant yells, "Cease fire!!" The Litvak
   proceeds to give a blast. The sergeant says, "Hey, don't you have
   ears, what did I say? The Litvak says, "You said, "Cease, fire," hob
   ikh gesosn!

As a novice to Yiddish, I don't know what the punch line means.  Could some
Mendelnik enlighten me?
