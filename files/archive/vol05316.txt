Subject: Tshatshke/tsatske

i find harvey spiro's proposed hebrew etymologies really fascinating. and i
agree entirely (pace noyekh!) with his intuitions about two separate words,
tshatshke for 'knick-knack' and tsatske(le) for 'young woman to reckon with'
(or however else you would translate 'oy, iz dus a tsatskele!' ;) ).
furthermore, i am pretty sure it's not limited to yinglish but is in fact at
least in the version of central yiddish that he and i grew up with.

at the same time, it should be mentioned that it's very common for two
dialectal versions of the same word to diverge in meaning, making for two
distinct words. _kirk_, now only a man's name, used to be a dialectal variant
of _church_; _chief_ and _chef_ were dialectal variants; likewise for _catch_
and _chase_, etc.

ok, i think we now need the old yiddish experts. (that's [[old yiddish]
experts], not [old [yiddish experts]]!) can beatrice or someone tell us if
_tshatshke_ or _tsatske_ occur before slavic contact? a dank.

Subject: YIVO recordings

Several years ago I had the good fortune to work very closely with Henry
Sapoznik, in his capacity as Sound Archivist at YIVO, in an effort to catalog
and (we hoped) transfer to an accessible medium all the Yiddish 78s in the
YIVO collection.  The response of the institute was underwhelming, and when
Henry and YIVO parted company, I suspect that all prospects for further
official issuing of such material ended as well.  I relate this in the hopes
that the Mendele community can perhaps create a groundswell of support for
such projects and thus influence the powers that be that access to such
precious resources is essential for those of us interested in pursuing,
perusing, preserving and/or purveying yiddish culture.
