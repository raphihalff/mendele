Subject: Hob un bin

Dan Slobin mentions some of the complexities of "haben" vs "sein" in
German (and the Dutch equivalents), and asks how Yiddish compares in this
regard.

To the best of my knowledge, Yiddish has nothing like this at all. "Zey
zenen getantst" sounds completely unfamiliar, and wrong, regardless of
the intended meaning.

I've checked the grammatical literature I have at hand: Zaretski(29),
Mark(78) as well as Weinreich(68). Just about the only case they mention
where the choice of auxiliary depends on meaning is the distinction
between transitive and intransitive "hengen": "Dos bild iz gehangen oyf
der vant." vs "Ikh hob gehangen dos bild oyf der vant." (And Mark points
out that even this distinction is systematically observed.)

None of them mention distinctions like those in German, even though I
think it's safe to assume that Weinreich (and probably Zaretski & Mark as
well) knew about those distinctions (in German).  So I think there's an
argument 'ex silentio' that those distinctions don't exist in Yiddish;
still, it would be nice to find some explicit discussion.

As I understand it, in Yiddish the choice of auxiliary is simply a
lexical property of a verb; the generalizations about semantics are of
diachronic rather than synchronic significance. Zaretski puts it well:
"Shafn spetsiele klolim vegn dem, velkhe verbn bildn di fargangenhayt mit
'bin' ('verbn, vos bataytn bevegung', un dos glaykhe), iz tsulib dray
tsendlik verbn nisht keday. Eynfakher iz poshet oyslernen zey." ("It
isn't worthwhile to create special rules concerning which verbs form the
past with 'bin' ('verbs that signify motion', etc) for the sake of thirty
some verbs. It's simpler just to learn them.")

Of course, there's no telling what might show up in the dialects. But on
a subtle matter like this, I'd be inclined to be suspicious of the
intuitions of anyone who's studied German ;-)

Subject: Dialects and standards

Two quick notes:

Eliyahu Juni apparently interpreted my ending a previous note with "genug
shoyn" as an attempt to close the discussion. My apologies to him, and to
anyone else who understood it that way. I meant that _I_ was running on
too long ;-)

Secondly, we now have several reports of dialect intolerance from
'yiddishists', I can't argue. Alas, I should have known. A little
knowledge is a dangerous thing.

More later, if I find the time.

Subject: Neshome keyn rozhinke

Daniel Soyer asked (5.158) about the above expression.

My late wife's uncle uses this expression (in the form, "Un mayn neshome
iz dokh a rozhinke?") in mock response to a perceived insult, in much the
same way as one might say in English, "What am I, chopped liver?"  In
other words, "Don't I count, too?"

Subject: Khushim ben Dan

There's a scene in Dovid Pinski's play _Der Oytser_ in which the
old man is playing doggo with various khevrelayt who, thinking that
he's rich, have come for a handout (as well as drinks on the house).
Getting no reply the biker-khoylimnik calls out: "nu, vos ligt ir azoy,
alter khushim ben dan...?"  (Khushim is spelled khes-vov-shin-yod-mem.)

I'd never heard that expression.  Harkavy (1928) and Weinreich give
idiot, imbecile, fool.  But surely a shnorer wouldn't call his mark an
idiot until he was sure that it was no go?  Besides, the "ben Dan"
suggests a reference to an actual person.

And such a person (khes-vov-shin-yod-mem) is indeed listed in Tanakh, in
Divrey 1 8.8.  The only problem is that this Khushim is a woman.  Another
Khushim (khes-shin-yod-mem; note the spelling) who is the son of Dan
does appear in Bereshis 46.23.  But since nothing whatsoever is given
other than the name, the question is why his name is invoked in Pinski.

Rashi has nothing relevant to say (a novene) but in the Talmud we at last
hit pay dirt.  Tractate Sota tells us (13 a) that Khushim (spelled _with_
a vov as in Pinski) was hard of hearing!  Was that what the khevreman
meant?

Although Harkavy and Weinreich are silent, Nahum Stutchkoff (may his
memory be blessed) is there with the goods.  According to him khushim
means someone who's deaf.

End of the quest?  Yogt nisht!  Heybt zikh ersht on di mayse.

One question is how Khushim got to be deaf in the first place.  Since I'm
already in over my head, I may as well go one step further and suggest
a connection with the Hebrew "hushim", as in the five senses. (Stutchkoff
by the way also lists "toyber khush".)  Since we're not primarily
concerned with talmudic language that's of course neither here nor there.
Except that "hushim" has the same root as the Hebrew "husham" which means
dolt and simpleton.  Which leads to my _very_ hesitant conclusion that
poor Khushim ben Dan has in the first place had his name manhandled and
misspelled by the sages (no offense to their memories intended) and later
had his name conflated with a word meaning fool.

My second question asks: how many in Pinski's audience _understood_ the
reference?  I assume more then than now, a safe guess.  But how many?  No
theater-going _Yiddish theater_ audience in Poland and especially the
United States (where the play was written in 1906) was likely to be
packed with people who had ever studied Talmud at all, let alone who knew
its (very) minor characters.  The word is listed in Harkavy (1898) only
as the plural of "khush", sense, which suggests that the word was not
exactly a well-known synonym for deafness.

Is this then a case of Pinski flattering the pit, much as Shakespeare
did, with allusions to things about which they knew nothing -- but
understood the thrust just the same?  My question goes to what I consider
to be a nostalgic (and probably false) construction of shtetl reality
wherein everybody was steeped in learning.  I don't believe it, especially
not of _theater_ audiences.  So the "flow" of language becomes an
interesting subject.

Now it's up to the people who know something to comment.
