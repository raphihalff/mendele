Subject: Dos shtetl bashteyn

To add to what Mendy Fliegler (7.027) and Andrey Bredstein (7.029) had to 
say about the Yiddish proverbial expresssion "dos shtetl bashteyn":  the 
late Dr. Israel Furman in his _Yidishe shprikhverter un rednsartn (Tel-Aviv, 
1968) has two relevant entries.

	"1664.  Er ken zayn shtetl aleyn bashteyn.  [...]  Men banutst di 
r[edns]a[rt] oykh in der ershter perzon.  Geveyntlekh zogt men dos, az 
eyner git eytses oder vil helfn.  Bekheyn, batayt 'aleyn' an opzogn fun 
der hilf, oder der eytse.

	[The proverb is also used in the first person.  One usually says 
this when someone offers advice or wants to help.  "Aleyn" thus means a 
rejection of the help or the advice.]

	"1665.  Er ken zayn shtetl bashteyn.  Mit der r[edns]a[rt]
zogt men aroys zayn gleybn in der feyikayt fun emetsn, az er
farshteyt zikh tsu helfn in a shverer situatsye, oder vet kenen 
di shvere arbet durkhfirn ukhdoyme.  Bikhlal iz es an aroyszogn
fun tsutroy tsu eynem.  [...]  'Shtetl' hot in der r[edns]a[rt]
dem batayt fun plats, postn, ort, shtele, shtandpunkt un bikhlal
situatsye. -- Noent fun dem batayt iz in yidish dos vort shtot
(in shul). -- 'Bashteyn' hot dem zin fun toygn, durkhfirn, 
menatseyekh zayn. -- Di tsvey verter in di ongevizene bataytn
zenen undz akhuts do, nish bakant.  Di bataytn zenen fun daytsh,
vu zey zenen ofter, nor in daytsh heyst es nisht Stadt, nor Statt
oder Sta"tte.  In yidish-taytsh hot men enlekh gezogt:  'Der kann
sein Sta"tche bestehen.'  S'iz ober genutst gevorn nor in a
shlekhtn zin, lemoshl, vegen a shleger."

	[With this proverb one expresses belief in someone's
ability to cope with a difficult situation or to carry out a
difficult task etc.  In general it is an expression of confidence
in someone.  In the proverb 'shtetl' means 'place, position, 
location, point of view or situation in general.'  The word
'shtot' in the sense 'seat in a synagogue' has a similar meaning
in Yiddish.  'Bashteyn' has the meaning 'qualify, carry out, 
triumph.'  The two words in the given meanings are unknown to us
except here.  The meanings come from German, where they are more
common, but in German the word is not 'Stadt' but 'Statt' or
'Sta"tte.'  One said similarly in Judeo-German:  'Der kann sein
Sta"tche bestehen.'  It was used however only in a negative 
sense, e.g., with respect to a pugnacious type]

Subject: Yiddish National Book Center - Follow Up

I am glad to report that the June 27,1997, "Forwerts", includes an article 
about the opening of the Yiddish National Book Center in Amherst MA. A brief 
history of the center, followed by a description of the facilities which 
includes a collection of 1.3 million (!) books in Yiddish, is given.

I am still puzzled about the reasons for chosing the location of the "National 
Yiddish Bicher Centrale", away from major Jewish Centers. I am also puzzled by 
the fact that during the opening ceremonies, held on June 15, 1997, no mention 
was made of NYBC's role besides "samlung" or of its collaborative endeavors 
with other institutions promoting Yiddish culture. Is this going to be a 
central warehouse for Yiddish books discarded by their dying owners and 
distributed for safekeeping and study to other libraries, or is it going to be 
more than that.

Hopefully, the questions will be answered.

Subject: ben Yishai - a query

I'm new to the Mendele list and uncertain about my participation because I
neither speak/read Yiddish nor am very knowledgeable about either the history 
of the language nor its current status.  I am, however, delighted to see the 
level of interest in literature, poetry in particular, on the list, and would 
like to query other participants for any knowledge about a particular Yiddish 
poet.

His name is (was) David Greenberg--my great-grandfather--and he wrote under 
the name ben Yishai.  I've been doing some research on him out of interest as 
a poet myself and because the family has not had any of his work (or, for 
that matter, much memory of him).  His dates are 1853-1917, he emigrated 
(1883) from Volhynia, and lived in Cincinnati.  I have found three of his 
poems in Die Yiddische Velt (Cleveland), where a wonderful obituary notes 
that he was widely published in all the leading Yiddish newspapers (don't 
we miss the days when newspapers published poetry!) and that "thousands 
of Jews" attended his funeral (perhaps a bit of an exaggeration given the 
size of the local Jewish community at that time). He is also given a 
reference in Radar's Concise Dictionary of American Jewish Biography 
(1994), so obviously he was (outside the family, that is) quite well 
known (he's referred to there as both poet and composer); that entry also 
refers to a listing in Eisenstadt's Hakme Yisroel be-Amerika which I have 
not yet found.

Information/advice from anyone who knows anything about this poet/ancestor
of mine would be greatly appreciated--including suggestions for (practical) 
routes for further research.

Many thanks.

PS:  Those with a particular interest in poetry might enjoy the current
(Spring 1997) issue of the literary magazine Prairie Schooner, edited by
Hilda Raz, which (despite its unlikely title) is devoted to contemporary
Jewish writing in America (this current issue, that is).  This is admittedly 
a flagrant plug, since I also have some work there regarding this 
great-grandfather of mine.
