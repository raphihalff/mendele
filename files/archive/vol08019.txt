Subject: Musulman

I can't shed light on how the word came to be used in the camps, but I can
help a little with the Spanish part of the question.

"Musulman" (w/ emphasis and written accent on the 'a') is either a noun or an
adjective (masc., singular) meaning Muslim, Islamic.  "Sarraceno"  (English
equivalent 'Saracen') is a historical word from medieval and Renaissance
times; it is used today only as a pretentious (and sloppy) synonym for Muslim.
"Moro" is the traditional Spanish work for any man of Islamic faith, whether
North African Berber, Pakistani or Turk (or anyone else).  The English word
'Moor' (as in "Othello") has a similar connotation - someone with what is
perceived as dark skin.

"Mozarabe" (written accent and emphasis on the first 'a'), used for people and
a particular type of art, means a Christian living under Muslim rule in Spain
in the Middle Ages.  Because the Reconquests of Portugal and Aragon were
essentially finished by the end of the thirteenth century (and the remaining
Islamic kingdoms were essentially vassals of Christian rulers), there was
comparatively little Mozarabic culture and very few "mozarabes" from the
beginning of the 15th century on.

I doubt very seriously that Ladino provided the word "musulman" to Europeans
in the camps;  there is testimony about how the Ladino-speaking Greek and
Balkan Jews were unable to communicate with most people in the camps because
of the lack of a common language.  As far as the history of the Islamic
Spaniards ('moros') goes:  in the15th century (starting with the riots of
1391), the Spanish *Jewish* community was fatally weakened by repeated murder,
robbery, forced and willing conversion.  This took place in Castile and
Aragon, in the towns and in  all the cities - Barcelona, Seville, Cordoba,
Toledo, etc., etc.  The small Islamic kingdoms were warred upon and conquered
throughout the 15th century, but the civilian population was let more or less
alone, and when the kingdoms were conquered by Christians there were not the
forced mass conversions characteristic of the recurring anti-Jewish riots.
Muslims in 15th-century Spain starved no more often than anyone else.  

In the year of the Jewish expulsion (1492) the last Muslim kingdom (Granada)
fell to Ferdinand and Isabella.  But the Muslims were not expelled; they were
granted the right (on paper at least) to remain in Christian Spain and
practice their religion.  It was only under the heavyhanded attempts by
Cardinal Jimenez de Cisneros at forced conversion and prohibition of Arabic
and Muslim clothing that they rebelled (1498-99) and new directives were
promulgated.  The descendants of these Muslims (called "moriscos") were
finally expelled from Spain by a series of decrees spanning the years
1608-1614.

I think it would be more fruitful to look for the origins of the usage in
European culture and 'Orientalism' of the 19th and early 20th century.

Marti Krow-Lucal  

[Moderator's note: word _musulman_ (obs. Russian for Moslem, here means
'goner, one not far from death') in the Nazi camps was borrowed from the
Russian camp argot (see e.g. Meyer Galler, Soviet camp speech / Jerusalem: 
Magnes Press, The Hebrew University, 1994.  Previous editions 1972 and 1977).

Subject: Modern usage of 'shvartser'

Dan Gilman's query is, in my opinion, an interesting and valuable one that I
have often thought about since I began studying Yiddish four years ago. 

I am a graduate student in comparative literature, and my research involves
studying Yiddish literature in the context of post-colonial theory --
particularly with reference to post-colonial African literature. Therefore I
find myself speaking in Yiddish about both African and African-American
culture quite a bit. 

Because I come to Yiddish by way of English, the word "shvartser" is
irrevocably tainted for me by the racist connotations it has acquired in
English. I think contemporary Yiddish speakers, especially in America, are
kidding themselves if they consider the term, in 1998, neutral or objective. 

I therefore advocate--and my Yiddish-speaking friends on this list can
attest that I use the word frequently in conversation--"Afro-Americaner" as
the term of choice in Yiddish:

"Er iz an Afro-Americaner shrayber."

"Zi fleg voynen in an Afro-Americaner gegnt."

"S'iz a tendents tsvishn di Afro-Americaner tsu shtimen far dem demokratik
partey."

Un azoy vayter....

Subject: usage of 'shvartser'

As an interesting digression, I was recently told that the term is now used
in Israel to refer to the ultra-Orthodox Jews, replacing the more generic
"dawsim").

Subject: Usage of Shvartser

My mother-in-law, o'h, used to refer to African-Americans, then called
negroes and later blacks, as 'vayse.' She did this just in case they might
overhear her and take offense. So she developed this code word.  She was
convinced that people of color understood Yiddish.  Maybe she was right.
After all, Yiddish is a universal language. No?

The only true African-American people I know I my Jewish friends from Morocco
and South Africa. This term for black people is somewhat misleading, and
therefore probably with short shelf life.

Subject: Modern use of 'shvartser'

Re: Dan Gilman's research on the use of the word 'shvartser' My memory of the
Yiddish that surrounded me when I was growing up in Cincinnati and Los
Angeles was that you couldn't reallly determine the prejudice of the speaker
simply from the mention of the word; you'd get your clues from the context as
to whether it was derogatory or not. (Like Archie Bunker discussing 'da
coloreds') 

I suspect--with no supportive data--that our parents, having so few English
words to choose from for the purposes of ethnic identification, didn't keep
up with the latest nuance. They probably felt lucky to know one word per
phenomenon. My sister told me of an uncle--a 'greenhorn'--who was making
friendly small talk with an African-American acquaintance. After an exchange
of "How are you's", my uncle inqured with concern, "and how's your nigerke?" 

I think it was in the late '40s that my peers, for whatever reasons,
concluded that 'shvartzes' was coarse and derogatory--"The shvartze" meant
"the cleaning woman"--and that Hebrew provided the better alternative.
"Shokhor" was the correct word now. It wasn't long before my friends were
referring to "The Shukhs" in ways indistinguishable from "The Svartzes" 

Gurnisht helfen. 

I'd appreciate hearing others' experiences.

Subject: laas is la'az

Rashi uses the Hebrew word la'az (laned ayin zayin) to indicate a foreign
language. The myth that la'az is an abbreviation of "Leson Am Zar" or "Leshon
Avodah Zarah" had beed put to rest long time ago. Some old editions of
Rashi's commentaries indeed put the abbreviation mark by the word la'az, but
is was a local printer initiative not scholarship i.e, [am aratzuth]. For the
Hebrew word la'az see for example "Beyit Ya'acov me'am loez" in Psalm 114:1.
'loez' means here foreign toung. 

This process of making words or names into abbreviation has to do with anti
Christian, or with folkloric reasons. Another word that comes to mind where a
word became an abbreviation is Yeshu (Jesus) which the abbreviation stood for
Yemakh shemo vezichro. I am sure that other people can come up with more
examples.

Subject: Dissertation on Yiddish names

I've gotten several requests for information on how to get a copy of this
University of Chicago doctoral dissertation.  Here is the bibliographic
information:

Cohn, Rella Israly. 1995. Yiddish Given Names: A Lexicon. 454 pages. 

Volume one is a discussion of the problems and methods of study of this
subject, volume two is the lexicon. 

Most universities make their dissertations available through University
Microfilms International in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but I think that Chicago
does not.  It may be that the only way to buy a copy is through Regenstein
Library at the university.  I suggest that people who are interested ask
their local library's reference librarians whether they can get a copy
through Interlibrary Loan.

Subject: More dissertations: Yiddish-Chinese connection

Speaking of dissertations...  Kai-Ping Peng recently got a PhD in Social
Psychology from the University of Michigan. The dissertation ("Naive
dialecticism and its effects on reasoning and judgment about contradiction
(compromise)", 1997) discusses a rather esoteric topic of relations between
Chinese dialectical epistemology and Aristotelian logic. 

The work includes five empirical studies, one of which might be of interest
to Mendelyaner. Chinese and American study subjects were presented with
several sets of Chinese, American and Yiddish proverbs in different
combinations for identification and/or evaluation:

"... when Yiddish proverbs were evaluated, the Chinese preferred the
dialectical Yiddish proverbs more than Americans did while both groups were
equal about the non-dialectical Yiddish proverbs. In addition, the
dialectical Yiddish proverbs were guessed more likely to be Chinese proverbs
by people from both cultures when they were informed that half of the
proverbs were Chinese and half of them were American."

East is East and West is West...
