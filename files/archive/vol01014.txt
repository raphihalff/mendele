Subject: Mendele

Mendele, is exactly what I had in mind. My name is Mina
Graur and I am a researcher at the Dinor Institute (the
Hebrew University in Jerusalem). I finished my Ph.D.
dissertation at Rice University in Houston, and I wrote
a biography of an anarchist called Rudolf Rocker, who
for a quarter of a century edited the "Arbeiter Fraint"
the main anarchist newspaper in the Yiddish language in
London's East End. I am now working on the history of
the Jewish labor movement in the USA with special
emphasis on the Jewish trade unions. Let me congratu-
late you on your initiative, and please add my name to
your subscribers' list. Best wishes. Mina Graur.

as for introductions - i may be something of a ringer
on this list: i'm a professor of statistics at rutgers
univ. in new brunswick, nj. but i take an amateur's
delight in yiddish linguistics and related matters and
some of the items i've read on mendele have been very
interesting and informative.
