Subject: correction

_di shidekh_ in _TMR_ vol. 02.021 should be corrected to _der shidekh_.  The
mistake appears a number of times in the introduction and once in the body of
the story.

Subject: "shidekh"

As far as I know, "shidekh" is a masculine noun, so it was quite disconcertng
to find it feminized to "di shidekh" in the heading title and introduction to
the story by Alter Kacyzne. The actual text by Kacyzne has it correct as "der
shidekh," but whoever wrote the introduction seems not to have looked at the
text, and the mistake is made more than once.  I know it is difficult to keep
the Yiddish masculine, feminine and neuter nouns straight when one is used to
English, but I think an effort should be made, especially in the Mendele
Review, in the interests of keeping the language from deteriorating any more
than it has already.

Subject: Boris Sandler Mkabl Ponim Zayn

I am not a linguist, nor an academic, but as a lover of Yiddish and of words,
it behooves me to welcome, for all of us, Boris Sandler as the new editor of
the Yiddish Forward.

While we parse and play with derivations and defintions of fendl and pamelekh,
nobody has taken the several moments to note how he lights up the sky with
innovative additions in his editions - pages glowing with literatur,
introducing new writings to evaluate, new Yiddish styles, new writers! (our
own Sholom Berger)....honoring the beloved master Sutskever on his 85th
birthday.... new pages about Yidishe Moleray - Chagal and Modigliani.... an
enlightening literarisher togbukh with thumbnail sketches of our legacy of
authors..

Is anybody here? Does anybody care? Do we only pay homage to the dead?
The King is dead. Long live the King.

Subject: nerayen

re: Avrum-Yankev Amkraut's question about nerayen/eytsn in Vol.08.022

Weinrech's dictionary does give eytsn, geeytst. That is not an answer to your
question. I don't know whether there is a regional difference in usage
between 'eytsn' and 'gebn an eytse'. May be the first is more literary. 

'nerayen': Weinreich gives: naray - suggestion, offer, tender, recommendation
and: narayen, narayt - suggest offer, tender. In Polish there is the word:
'narada' - consultation, councel, conference. I don't know how the one could
be related to the other, but they sound a bit the same. (Russian has: narjad:
order, warrant; duty, detail.)

Subject: Nerayen

Avrum-Yankev Amkraut asked about the galitsianer verb _nerayen_ (8.022). 
Ukrainian _naraiaty_ and its Polish source _naraic'_ mean 'advise;
recommend'.  The Polish root was originally _rad_, as in Polish (and
Ukrainian) _rada_ 'council', whence _rajca_ 'councillor' (from _radz'ca_). 
The Polish root in turn is a borrowing from Germanic:  cf. Yiddish _rot_
'council, board' and _rotn_ 'advise, counsel'.

Subject: Yiddish and Aramaic

I enjoy all the varied postings on Mendele.  Thanks for introducing me to
Tzvi Kanar's DER TOITENMARSH which I used as reading material for my Yiddish
literature group here in Houston; we were all touched by the narrative. I
have a question about "Yakum-purkn zup" mentioned at the end of the
narrative.  The book Vidervuks had an excerpt from this story & in their
dictionary they defined yakum-purkn as "strange" or "mudne"( in Yiddish).  An
older Yidddish speaker (Riga, b. 1910) defined it for me as a "mishmash". 
Question:  how did this Sabbath afternoon prayer come to have such a meaning? 

I have just had time after several busy months to read my mendele list & in
an old posting someone trying to remember a saying with "hindik ... " Since
no one seems to have answered this, I'll try.  The woman who I learned most
of my Yiddish from (b. 1888, Korostishev, Ukraine) once told me the following
annectode:  When she was a child & she or her siblings would pester their
mother asking repeatedly,"what's for dinner?", the mother would answer
sarcastically, "kakapitzi mit indik zoimen" . "Kakapitzi" is, I assume ,a
nonsense word which doesn't soundo very nice, served with "turkey seeds" I
remembered the saying because it struck me as very funny! 

Our mayvinim on mendele have discussed the relationship of Aramaic to early
Yiddish.  The question if I understand is whether the Aramaic was a spoken
language or a language only read and studied by proto-Yiddish speakers.  I've
always been impressed at what seemed to me like a pretty high percentage of
Aramaic words in the Loshn-koydesh sector of Yiddish.  But it seems like few
of the Aramaic origin words are "every day words"(i.e. food, body, family
words)  which you would expect from a spoken language. Most of them seem to
be the type you would use in discussion (i.e. aderaba, mistome, etc); I had
always assumed that these would have been used by the yeshiiva-bekhorim who
read talmud in Aramaic & therefore interjected Aramaic words from their
reading. into the spoken language.I'd like to hear more on this matter . 
Special thanks to Noakh Miller who explained how to change the romanizations
on mendele to "real" Yiddish.  All I can say is awesome!

Subject: "beit midrash" or "beysmedresh"

"beit midrash" was mentioned in the article on Yiddish in Canada

I don't know how many chassidic children are at home in a beit midrash, but
I bet most of them could find their way to the beysmedresh.....

Subject: Source of a Yiddish book

Ezra Gordon (8.023) asked about the source for a book mentioned in the
_Forverts_:  _A hundert yidishe shtetlekh fun Ukraine_.  The book, the first
part of a planned multivolume work, is actually in Russian:  _100 [Sto]
evreiskikh mestechek Ukrainy:  Istoricheskii putevoditel'.  Vypusk 1: 
Podoliia_ (ISBN 5-89007-008-9.)  (The two-page English summary gives the
English title _Historical Guide "One Hundred Shtetls of Ukraine."  Issue 1: 
Jewish Communities of Podoliya_.)  It was compiled by Veniamin Lukin and
Boris Khaimovich and published in 1997 by the Jerusalem Center for
Documentation of the Diaspora Heritage and the Institute for Investigation of
the Jewish Diaspora (Petersburg Jewish University). 

I obtained my copy from the Victor Kamkin Bookstore in Rockville, Maryland.
