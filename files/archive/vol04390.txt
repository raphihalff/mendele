Subject: Leyvick's 1957 speech/essay

I have in my files an English translation of a speech (and perhaps an
essay) which Howe/Greenberg refer to in their volume on Yiddish poetry.
Beyond identifying it as a talk delvered at a writers conference in
Jerusalem and quoting a paragraph, Howe does not give any more
particulars about the essay. The copy in my files is a photocopy,
similarly without citation or source, but the photocopy is clearly from a
publication (rather than a typescript). I would love some help in
tracking down this piece, both in Yiddish and in English.

The essay begins by stating that the author is now 70 years old, and
looks back on a day when he was 7 during which four traumatic and
formative things happened to him: He is hit by a brutish Pole in front of
a church, he learns in heder about the akedah, he sees a madman, and he
wounds his tongue on a frozen pipe.

Does this ring any bells for anyone?

Subject: Tundele

a nice russian immigrant friend uses this version to
tickle our kids. she thinks it's folklore:

(first you rub the palm and say)

soroka-vorona                  magpie-crow
kashu varila                   she cooked kasha
detechok kormila.              and fed her children.

(then you bend down one finger at a time, starting with the pinkie,
saying with each)

etomu dala                     she gave to this one
etomu dala                     she gave to this one
etomu dala                     she gave to this one
etomu dala                     she gave to this one

(now grab the thumb and give the hand a shake)

a etomu nye dala               she didn't give to this one
on lyentai                     he's lazy
on vles nye khodil             he didn't go to the forest
drova nye rubil                he didn't chop wood
i kashu nye varil              and he didn't cook kasha

(tickle the inside of the wrist)

zdyes kolodetz                 here's a well

(tickle the inside of the elbow)

zdyes krinitsa                 here's a drinking bowl

(tickle the armpit)

zdyes kholodnaya voditsa!      and here's some cold water!

(all parties collapse in laughter)

a koshern pesah alemen

Subject: Hern a yidishn vort

Moshe Waldok's post about Aramaic used the phrase "ken men hern dortn a
yidishn vort," which reminds me of a joke my father told me.

A politician, was addressing a crowd on the Lower East Side. He spoke in
English, and every so often a heckler would shout out "red yidish!" This
went on for a while, and the speaker finally got hot under the collar and
yelled "sharrop!" The heckler replied, "Oi, 'siz gut zu hern a yidishn
vort."
