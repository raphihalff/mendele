Subject: Introduction

A few words about myself:

My father was born in Kielce (Poland) in 1921, and settled in Paris in
1928. In 1941, he was arrested with his whole family, escaped shortly
before being sent to death, and spent a few years fighting as a
partisan in the french Alps.

I was born in Paris in 1961 and although my mother tongue was French, I
spent my whole childhood among Yiddish speakers. My father encouraged
me to learn German at school so that I could better understand Yiddish.

At the age of 22, I moved to Israel and spent four years studying
linguistics at the Hebrew University. But for private reasons, I
eventually relocated to France, where I could unfortunately not really
make use of my knowledge. I am now working in France for a german
company (Lufthansa).

I have always been fascinated with languages and with the many aspects
of the jewish culture. I studied thoroughly German, Hebrew and Russian.
I find of particular interest the blending of these languages into
Yiddish. And I think that both the respect for tradition and the
aspirations to progress inherent in the Yiddishkeit keep it as "actual"
as ever.

Alain Rapoport.

Subject: song

Does anyone know the full words to a song that I think is callled "Yidn
Redn Yiddish".  It talks of all the lands in which Jews speak Yiddish.
It was taught at the Workman's Circle elemntary schools in the 40's.
Thank you.

Subject: Sauregurkenzeit & Hals-und Beinbruch

A Yiddish etymological background has been suggested to me behind the
German idioms SAUREGURKENZEIT and HALS-UND BEINBRUCH - I don't recall
exactly which and how, and maybe it was only a folk etymology or pun in
Yiddish based on the German idioms. As far as I remember the SAURE-
part in SAUREGURKENZEIT could be from yiddish tsores 'trouble, ..'. And
maybe the -BRUCH part in HALS-UND BEINBRUCH could be from brokhe /
brukhe 'blessing'. Please enlighten me or link me further on to someone
who might be able to do so.

Best regards

Subject: samuel margoshes

I am trying to track down the papers of Samuel Marghoshes for research
purposes.  Specifically, I would like to find his doctoral thesis,
written in English in 1916.  I've had no luck at JTS, Columbia, or
YIVO.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?

Many thanks.

Subject: Cracow dialect

I live in Cracow, but I have a very hard time trying to find any
speakers of local Yiddish (and there are no books on it).  Could I get
some info (or an address where I can find it) about the dialect spoken
in Crakow like:

did it preserve length (shluufn/zugn, zyn-ziin son-sun), final voiced
consonants (kind or kint), what became of MHG aa (zaagen, taag), ee
(schnee), ii (miin, ziin), oo (root, groos), uu (huus, aruus), u (gut),
ou (koufn), ei (klein, ein), iu (friunt, hiunt).

I wonder why M. Gebirtig rhymes (or maybe it is licentia poetica)
weeping and to be (gewejn-zain, gewajn-zaan), great and mouse
(grojs-mous), love and room (liib-shtuub/shtiib) while also makh tsu
and lyu lyu.

I will appreciate your answer very much.

Subject: words

Khaverim,

In my translation of the Volkovysk Yizkor Book, from Yiddish to
English, I have encountered Yiddish names for a series of
'pre-industrial' trades and occupations, that I am not familiar with (I
suspect that these words were never used in my household, in mid-20th
century America, out of sheer lack of need and/or obsolescence).

I would like to render these in English correctly, and welcome any
interpretation you may be aware of. A list follows:

a kotler
a koshtiolker/koshtelker (may have something to do with churches?)
a vendzler
a meckler
a zhemshchik
a bayn-tokker (I am told a tokker turned wooden furniture legs to
finish them)
a pandanter
a tenzer
a niezner

A hartzigen dank!

Yankev Berger

Subject: Boris Sandler's "A Shmek Tabeke"

I had the pleasure to listen to Boris Sandler's "A Shmek Tabeke" The
disk is beautifully crafted, perfect stories well presented by Dovid
Rogow, Mina Bern and Shifre Lerer . This remarkable CD lends itself as
an educational tool for Yiddish classes and good entertainment for
Yiddish clubs and individuals who enjoy to listen to a good Yiddish
story. I highly recommend Sandler's CD to those who can't read Yiddish
but understand and enjoy listening to Mame-Loshen.

Di CD hot be'emes mir farshaft asakh fargenign.
