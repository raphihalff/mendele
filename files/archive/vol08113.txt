Subject: Yiddish in Israel

There have recently been a number of communications about Yiddish, living or
dead. There is an interesting phenomenon I have observed here in Israel.
Yiddish has become the lingua franca between "Anglos"  [English speakers]
and immigrants from the FSU. Indeed, many Anglos who came as adults and have
had great difficulty learning Hebrew, use Yiddish to communicate with
Israelis of Ashkenazic background or with immigrants from South America who
often know a bit of Yiddish. A great deal depends upon the age of the
speaker, of course. Since most of my friends are over 60 they usually heard
and often spoke Yiddish as children. 

There are some lively Yiddish events here in the Negev. Dimona has frequent
lectures and concerts in Yiddish. In Arad we have occasional Yiddish
programs. The other night Yitshak Weinstock of Beersheva (formerly of
Argentina) very active in Yiddish culture on a national level, brought us
the video of Mikhoels in Yidishe Glikn. Weinstock gave an overview of the
happenings in USSR in 1925 and then we saw the video.  He comes to Arad
about once every two months, on a completely voluntary basis, to bring us
Yiddish culture. He also singlehandedly publishes a Yiddish periodical in
Beersheva. I have participated in a number of programs in the past and will
continue to do so.

Subject: tumbalalaika

In Primo Levi's book IF NOT NOW, WHEN? (English translation from Italian by
William Weaver), unfamiliar lines are given in the familiar song
Tumbalalaika (referred to as "Song of the Foolish Boy" (narishe bokher) in
the book. Here, the questions in the riddle are (1) who is the king who has
no country? (2) what water doesn't wash away sand? (3) what is faster than a
mouse and higher than a house?  The other two questions are familiar: "What
can burn without a flame," and "What can weep without tears?"

Do any mendelyaners know these words in Yiddish, or was the author possibly
"winging it?" (I expect to be chastised for suggesting sloppiness on Levi's
part! I really hope that someone will know of the lines mentioned above.
Chana Mlotek, are you there?

Subject: Jesus in yidish

There is a yidish nickname for the Christian saviour of yosele pondrik.

What I want to know is: wasn't it Jesus's father whose name was Joseph
and what does pondrik mean?

Subject: buttering someone up

M.Feller requested a yiddish idiom for buttering someone up. I believe that
the word "chanifenik" expresses that.

Subject: Yiddish idiom

I'm just getting caught up on recent correspondence and I see Morrie
Feller's request for a Yiddish idiom which would correspond to the English,
to butter him up. In response, I offer up, men darf im pitsn dem hoyker. 
Literally it says, you have to polish his hump. 

I note Morrie's mention of Yosef Guri's 1,000 Yiddish Idioms. I am not
familiar with this volume and would appreciate receiving publication data
about it so that I can access the material.

Subject: snorkeling

In a recent shmuesn session, we found ourselves stumped when it came to the
Yiddish for snorkeling and scuba-diving.  Any suggestions?

Subject: vayter farvarfn gendz

Ikh hob bamerkt dos vos reb Noyekh shraybt vegn "farvarfn" in 8.111, un,
tsufelik hob ikh bald dernokh gefunen a zats bay Sholem Aleykhemen vu er
bashraybt "farvarfn" mer protimdik: 

    Er vet ir aroysgebn gelt in mark arayn, zi vet aynkoyfn oyfes,
    farvarfn zey in shtayg arayn, hodeven, zey zoln vern "fet kapital",
    un kokhn a yoykh fun zaynetvegn.
    (Yosele Solovey, zaytl 203)

Mir dakht zikh az dos shtits unter Reb Noyekhs oystaytsh.

Summary: I happened to come across this passage in Sholem Aleykhem with a
more detail description of "farvarfn": he describes throwing the birds in a
cage, and feeding them so they'll become "fat capital".  This seems to
support Noyekh Miller's interpretation.

Subject: Ver iz a Yid

David Herkovic need a better definition to "Ver iz a Yid".  Allow me to
quote Rabbi Abraham Klausner in this subject:

"What is a Jew?
A jew is a riddle,
wrapped in an enigma,
dipped in a puzzle,
shaped as a question mark
leaning on an exclamation point
and surrounded by a hedge
of parentheses.
A Jew is an answer,
clear as a bell, wise as a sage
deep as the sky.
A Jew is one of the chosen people.
A Jew is a victim, furtive as fear,
shy with tension, nervous with destiny,
on edge with uneasy awareness,
the scapegoat of history.
A Jew is a victor, rich in knowledge,
wealthy with insight, proud with
s u r v i v a l across the milennia."

Es vendt zich vie einer zikht yiddishkeit, einer gefint fargenign in baigel
un lax, kreplekh, oder gefilte fish a tweiter gefinfargenign in leinen Chaim
Grade, Kocherginski un Leivick, a driter hut fagenign fun hern gute klezmer
music.... 

Far einem iz yiddishkeit kapdonish, shver un shtreng, far a tveitn iz es
full mit inspiratzie....
