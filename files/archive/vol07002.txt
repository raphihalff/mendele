Subject: English transcription of Yiddish words

Sheker hasus litshue: If everyone's beating a dead horse I might as
well.

I hesitate to take issue with Zellig Bach, but it's incorrect to find
fault with the Forward's transcription of Yiddishisms that have
entered English.  Foreign words get Anglicized when they get devoured
by English; that's the way it has been, is, and will always be, from
"desperado" to "chaise-longue" (pronounced "chaise-lounge" by most
English speakers), from "kangaroo" (however that might have been
pronounced in the first place) to "borscht."  Languages that get it
the worst are those which are written in non-Roman character systems,
including Yiddish and Hebrew. (And, of course, not just those: one can
still get into fights in certain academic circles for advocating the
"wrong" system of Chinese romanization.)  If every writer who
"mistransliterated" a Hebrew or Yiddish word were laid open to the
charge of insensitivity with regard to the source language, who would
be left standing?  "Chanukah," "Hanukkah," or "Hanuka"?  "Pesach,"
"Pesakh," or "Peysekh"?  It's hard enough writing a good sentence
without worrying about the provenance of every other word.

So it's no surprise that (to take one example) the American Heritage
Dictionary, third edition, my current favorite among dictionaries for
its faithful representation of current usage, gives non-Yivo, indeed,
positively anti-Yivo spellings for Yinglish words: "schmooze,"
"mensch," etc.  This is not indicative of any lack of rigor on their
part--the included etymologies, when they bother to list the Yiddish
source words, transliterate them "correctly," i.e. according to Yivo.
Rather, it's merely a reflection of the way a word's spelling gets
refracted on its trajectory through many different languages.  And
this is perfectly okay: no one should be expected to translate
Yinglishisms a la Yivo  for the simple reason that they're no longer
Yiddish words.  (Leonard Prager made this abundantly clear in the case
of "mentsh"-->"mensch.")

So, no--if we're conducting a Grand Inquisition of (or laying a kherem
on) the English Forward there are much better reasons, to which
transliteration is merely ancillary: the flippant and often ignorant
treatment of the language _in general_ in such rump columns as
"Yiddish VInkl" and "Philologos," and indeed in the whole newspaper,
and a lack of respect for the facts with regard to such small
historical matters as pre-World War II Eastern Europe.

Transliteration of Yinglishisms has really nothing to do with one's
respect for the language one way or the other.  It's an
intelligibility issue to the non-Yiddish speaker: If I spelled
"schmooze" "shmues," would anyone really know what I meant?  "I
shmuessed with her" looks almost obscene...

Vegn Andrey Bredsteins entfer (6.302-4):

Actually I was asking about lipograms which are made on purpose, for
literary reasons, and not about abbreviations or alternative
spellings. For example, Perec's "La disparition" (translated into
English as "A void", with no "e" too) is a long novel which includes
no "e"s, and all the novel deals with "disappearances", so that the
stylistic constraint is a kind of reflection of the book's subject.
Sometimes lipograms just are amusing games (cf. "Dying or not dying"
in "A void", which is a "lipogrammatic translation" of a famous text
by William S. ...), sometimes they are more interesting. I remember of
reading a text of Perec about the history of lipograms, including
examples in several languages, but I don't think it included any
example with non-Latin alphabets.

Subject: Kezayes

In my recent dissertation on the logistics of khreyn distribution in
Spain [6.296] I inadvertently spelled _kezayes_ as _kezis_, i. e. I
wrote "I" for "aye".  Hugh Denman's sharp eye caught this.  I wish
also to thank Mikhl Herzog [6.303] for catching _HaRov_, which of
course should be _HoRav_. Ha rov (the majority) are indeed always
making transcription errors and we need to keep learning Yiddish so
that mistakes will be as few as possible.  We owe this especially to
newcomers to _Mendele_ and _The Mendele Review_ and, hopefully, to
posterity.

PS Happy Birthday to _Mendele_!!
