Subject: New Jewish Gopherspace

I am pleased to tell you that Jewish Studies Judaica eJournal has now
opened its JEWISH STUDIES GOPHERSPACE.  Gopher is a program used to scan
material in an easy-to-use menu style over the internet.

Included in the Jewish Studies space are direct connections to libraries,
actual texts and articles for reading on-line or downloading, information
about programs at universities, and lots of other stuff related to Jewish
Studies and Judaism in general.

To find it, you need access to gopher, which universities have. Instead
of typing MAIL to enter your mail account, try typing GOPHER. You may
need to set your computer to VT100 emulation. If it works, you will see a
menu screen pop up. If it doesn't, speak to your local computer services
person.

Here is the path to follow:

Other gophers around the world / U.S. gophers / New York State gophers /
NY-Israel Project of NYSERNET / Electronic Journals / Jewish Studies
Judaica eJournal

Please have a look and then tell me what you think.

Subject: Ansky exhibit update

The tentative dates for the Ansky exhibit at the Jewish Museum, New York,
are:  October 6, 1994 to April 23, 1995.  The person at the Museum with
whom I spoke told me that those dates are 95% certain.

Subject: tikn-toes

The point of my posting about the "gutn purim malekh" song was to bring
you the passage of the song that differs from the one collected by Cahan,
and dafke that I left out:

	a gitn pi:rem malox
	vi: ox gaj fal ox
	fal ox of de s'tajno
	cebrex ox mo de bajno

(Translated into orthography: a gutn purim malekh, vu ikh gey fal ikh,
fal ikh of di shteyner, tsebrekh ikh mir di beyner).

Subject: The Australian connection

That Bobbi and Michael Zylberman are heirs and transmitters of Yiddish
culture in Melbourne is at first glance rather startling.  Azoy vayt
farshtekt? Doesn't that illustrate something about the power of the
Ashkenazic spirit? Could we bottle it?  However, here I am in Orange
County, California as distant from my geographical and cultural roots as
could be. If it can happen here, it CAN happen ANYWHERE. I have taught
Yiddish, given academic as well as entertainment talks on Yiddish,
presented programs on Yiddish writing (especially Sholem Aleichem). In
Orange County? Are you kidding?

Last night we heard Thomas Keneally speak on "The Indeliberate Elements
in Writing."  Of course, he shifted eventually into discussing
"Schindler's List." The story of Poldek Pfefferberg's lifelong
persistence to tell Schindler's story is a legend with many facets. One
of those facets is, in my opinion, the humane spirit that permeates
Ashkenazic culture: devotion to righteous action and to honoring
righteous action. We Yiddish cultural heirs are certainly not the
exclusive heirs to such a spirit, but we may have the most experience
with forces hostile to that spirit.

Thomas Keneally has undergone a deep transformation. Observation from the
outside reveals a journey from ignorance of European Jewish history to
considerable knowledge that has changed his insides. Now, he is one of
the few non-Jews that seems to "get it." And I am not offended by his
(partially successful) attempts to imitate Pfefferberg's Polish-Yiddish
accent. Er iz a mentsh, un take a heymisher mentsh!

I would love to hear from the Zylbermans about 1) their style of approach
to teaching Yiddish, and 2) how Keneally is received in Australia by
non-Jews and by Jews.

Hail to thee blithe spirit! The Chinese girl will probably come back and
haunt you but I say Ok to guy from the Bronex, a coopsite. Taka a
landzman. With people like the murdering doctor running around why mess

Subject: shimelekhe, and various

1. More or less in agreement with Shleyme Axelrod: in playing hide and
seek (called hide'n go seek) - also in Brooklyn in the thirties, you made
a circle on the back of the boy who was it, and recited a rigmarole
having to do with 'shimelekhe and you go O  U  T.'This finished the
programming of the it boy; then you had a short time (counted out ?) to
hide before he could open his eyes, turn around and look for you. I
assumed the shimelekhe had something to do with the Hebrew shem OlekhO.
(Inscribing (names or whatever) wasn't as trendy then as it has since
bcome.) I don't remember anyone ever explaining it. Hide and seek is an
old and widely known game (in Europe), and I assume there are
explanations, scenarios of 'what was going on ' in this rigmarole. As to
games in New York, Botkin ? Kirschenblatt-Gimblett ? Does Baker's YIVO
book(s) on games talk about hide and seek ? What is it called in Yiddish?

2. I second Steinlauf's comment on the urgency of getting cultural
(including linguistic) information from the oldest Yiddish speakers
around. (How many Mendelniks are in their eighties or older ?) On
theatre, sexuality or whatever. On 'feygele', Groucho Marx used the term
somewhere; I can't supply the reference.

3. Freely associating from good old Meyshe Kapeyer, what's the story on
Meyshe Pisher, later gentrified to Maurice Lafontaine ?.
