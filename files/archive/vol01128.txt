Bob Rothstein on vatnmaxer is pretty definitive. My message
re the Prilucki interpretation seems to have gotten lost
somewhere in Mendele. No!

Aren Abramson: "yagati umatsati" or "az me zukht, gefint
men". Actually, the credit belongs to Andrew Sunshine,
former student of mine, colleague on the Yiddish Atlas
project, most recent Columbia PhD in Yiddish linguistics.
The only credit I claim is for having asked him. He
remembered the following source: See
 
YIDISHE FILOLOGYE (1924): 234. "Der Vatelmakher" (notes by
the editor, Noyekh Prilucki.
 
Mendele, in various places: "khapt aykh/im der
vatelmakher". Other sources: "vatenmakher".
 
A.A. Roback: "vatenmakher" and "baytlmakher" which he
considers a euphemism for "tayvel". Prilucki's objection:
There is no form "tayvelmakher".
 
Prilucki's own hypothesis ("for lack of a convincing
alternative"): "vatelmakher" is "mevatel-makher" (< Hebrew
levatEl), i.e., "the devil, der nishtguter, the
discrediter) with simplification of the unfamiliar initial
cluster "mv-".
 
Howzzat?

Subject: Vatnmakher

I am grateful to Bob Rothstein for his very interesting
findings on possible origins of /vatnmakher/. I will pass
these thoughts on to our local Yiddish- reading group late
in January. Perhaps by then Mikhl Herzog will have
something to add. By the way, Bob, I remember Judah A.
Joffe well. We used to attend meetings of the old
Linguistic Circle of New York together. He would often stop
to chat with a few of us on Fifth Avenue afterwards.

As for Ellen Prince's foray onto the field, it was fun to
read, but she seems to have forgotten that the oath can be
laid upon us folk as well as horses. Aren (Re: Mendele,

Subject: ober vs. oder

I have noticed in some older Yiddish speakers a mixing of
"ober" (English "but") and "oder (English "or").  In one
case I know, the speaker, when speaking in English,
consistently uses "or" when she means "but", and I suspect
(though I can't say for sure) that this is because of the
ober/oder confusion in Yiddish.  Can anyone comment on
this? Is it widespread?

Sparrow grass?  What is this a reference to?
