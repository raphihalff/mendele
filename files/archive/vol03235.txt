Subject: introduction

after a voyeuristic-like rapport with mendele for a couple weeks
now, i think it is time for me to speak up and introduce myself. my
name ist kathleen rose noe, i am a phd student in german lit at
univ.of maryland. started yiddish one and a half years ago, but
don't really have any regular shprakhpartners since the yivo
zumerprogramm at columbia ended (in july). ober ikh ken zogn az ikh
bin azakh tsufridn mit dem nays vos ikh derfar fun mendele un s'iz
oykh interezant tsu zen fun vanen zenen di layt vos interezirn zikh
mit yidish.

right now in a seminar with Dr. Dorothy Bilik we are reading Glikl
von Hamels memoirs and in case anyone is interested in a 17th
century Hamburg Jewish woman's perspective on life and the world, i
recommend it highly. every time i sit down with it i feel like i'm
sitting in der shtub listening to her tales.

to daniella harpaz:

you were recently talking about schindlers list and is the portrayal
of human behavior in the ghetto realistic or not... i haven't seen
the movie yet, but thought that you and maybe others might be
interested in a recent publication: the chronicle of Jewish ghetto
policeman Calel Perechodik, which he wrote from may-oktober 1943. i
read an excerpt, it is hard to read because the suffering and agony
this man was in just jumps out of every line. he seems to feel that
many jews sold each other out on purpose, for privileges, out of
spite, whatever. he himself died in 1944. the manuscript had lain in
the jewish institute in warsaw for 50 years and nobody cared to
publish, cite, or critique it.

in case you're interested, the publisher is pawel szapira,
warsaw:Karta, 1993. its in polish, the title is: "Czy ja jestern
morderca?"

Subject: Re: Turniansky's anthology

In reference to a query several issues ago about Chava Turniansky's
anthology of Yiddish literature, FUN UNZER YIDISHER LITERATUR,
(which Dorothy Bilik provided a citation for) -- I was unable to
locate any copies for my intermediate Yiddish class this year --  I
tried the U. Penn bookstore, National Yiddish Book Center, Workmen's
Circle -- and so have concluded that the book is out of print.  If
anyone knows otherwise, I'd appreciate the information.

A sheynem dank,

Kathryn Hellerstein

Subject: A Yiddish Poem About Mozart

My favorite subject is Mozart, so you can image how I felt when I
first saw the following poem of Y. Glatshteyn brought to my
attention by Richard J. Fein who teaches at the State University of
NY at New Paltz.

=====================================================
Es hot zich mir gecholomt:
goyim hoben Moztarten gekreitzikt
und ihm begroben in an aizel-keber.
Nur yidn hobon ihm gemacht far Gotes mensch
un zain gedechenish gebenscht.

Sein apostol bin ich iber der velt gelofen
un fakert yeder ainem vos k'hav getrofen.
Umetum voz k'hav gechapt a krist,
chob ich ihm geschmat oif a Motzartist.

Vi vunderlech iz fun gettlechen mentsch
zein musikalischer testament,
vi durchgenogelt mit gezang
zainen zaine lichtigeh hent.
In zein grester noit,
hoben beim gekreitziten zinger
gelacht ale finger.
In zain veinendiksten troier,
hot er noch mehr vi zich alein
lieb gehat dem schaines oier.

Vi orem und vi karg,
antkegen Motzartem farblaib,
Iz di droshe oifen barg.

TRANSLATION:

I had a dream that Gentiles crucified Mozart
and buried him in a potter's field.
Only Jews revered him as a holy man and blessed his memory.

I was his apostle.
I ran through the world converting everyone I ment.
Whenever I caught a Christian, I turned him into a Mozartean.

How marvellous the musical testament of a G-d-filled man,
how nail-pierced with song are his glowing hands.
In his most bitter need,laughter lit up the fingers of the crucified
         singer.
In his most painful weeping,he loved, more than himself, the
         attentive ear.

Compared with what Mozart left us,
how poor and meager is the Sermon on the Mount.

Dan Leeson, Los Altos, California
