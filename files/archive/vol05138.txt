Subject: Questionnaire about Yiddish

Sholem ale frayndlekhe un gute mentshn!

I'm making research for my thesis about the situation and meaning of
Yiddish in modern world. Therefore I need your support in answering to
this, hopefully not too long, ankete. I find it very important a subject
for research to map out the current state of Mameloshn. And I find
Yiddish, its future and process, otherwise too of momentous value, as my
main interest. But here I am, in a remote little country at the edge of
the world, being uncapable to travel in America, Israel, Russia or
wherever di mentshn who still speak Mameloshn are to be found. That's why
I'm going to approach you through Internet, and all your assistance is
warmly welcomed. Please don't waste too long time in pondering the
questions, just answer them as you find it to suit. All the troubles
concerning this fregboygn should be laid on me and not on you. If you
find some questions silly or odd I hope you don't mind. One advantage
with using e-mail is that you're not dependent on the space I've left
open for you for the answers; you can make it as large as you wish -
which, of course, doesn't mean you have to give long answers. Those who
want can naturally tell more about themselves; I'd be enourmously glad of
all the informatsie I would get.

Dave Lee Roth is by the way a rock artist, former singer in Van Halen,
and jewish, of course. Abbie Hoffman used to be a beatnik and a poet.

Have fun!
