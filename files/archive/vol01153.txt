Subject: RE: std yiddish: erratum

for m.-n. eytan:

'sina%' should read 'sino%'
'ka%pra%dre$' should read 'ko%pra%dre$'

i wrote it first in egyptian french, to be REALLY
nasty. then i decided to be kind and switch to
standard french but inadvertently left in these 
two egyptianisms. now it's really easy, ne$spa?

Subject: Let's Standardize Our Spelling

Hau mehnie ov ewe feind iht eezee too reeyd thihs?

That's what some of the Yiddish in messages in MENDELE look
like to me.

I support Yude-Leyb Proger's arguments to adopt SYR (Vol. 1
no. 149).  There are two steps to this argument:  (1) adopt
standard Yiddish spelling (StY) using the Hebrew alphabet,
and:  (2) adopt standard translations of Yiddish spelling
in the Roman (i.e., ASCII a..z) alphabet.

Aside from disagreeing which standard to choose, can there
really be any doubt by any MENSH that a standard for both
Yiddish spelling in aleph beys and transliteration of that
spelling to a..z benefits us all?

Sure, it's nice sometimes to write in dialect for effect or
to emphasize a point, or to show how you pronounce a word,
and I'd like to get my hands on a dictionary that tells me
how to pronounce Yiddish words as my ancestors did. But
does anyone seriously propose that we each choose our own
spelling depending on our accent?  Reread the opening
sentence again before answering.

I have learned that komets aleph is rendered as "o" in SYR,
and vov is rendered as "u" in SYR, ergo I pronounce SYR
"vos" as "vus" and SYR "kuk" as "kik".  Now, some
well-meaning Galitzianerke comes along and writes down some
word I don't know, but makes the above dialectic
substitutions, and I have to guess whether the "u" is
Litvish that I need to pronounce "i", or is really a "u"
sound.  And vey mir nebkh if I have to look it up in
Weinreich's dictionary!

Aside:  Isn't "oy vey" short for "oy, vey iz mir"?

Subject: general

I received a letter from Moyshe-Nosn and answered it
privately, but when I saw he had sent a copy to _Mendele_ I
decided to do the same.  Here it is:
 
Dear Moyshe-Nosn,

I like your peppery manner and acknowledge that we
disagree.  Perhaps we will arrive at a mutually
satisfactory solution -- or is that formulation too
weasel-like?  S'iz ober nit gefeyrlekh vos mir zenen nit
maskim eyner mit dem tsveytn benegeye dem inyen
transkriptsye.  It is certainly possible to write any
language in a variety of alphabets and there is a group in
Israel lobbying -- in vain -- to romanize Hebrew (Kemal
Ataturk did it for Turkish, Jabotinsky I believe was in
favor of it for Hebrew, there have been advocates for
romanizing Yiddish).  Zayt mir gezunt un shtark,

Ayer, Yude-Leyb Proger
 
P.S.  You are right about the SYR being biased toward
Litvish; my own dialect is Southeastern (Ukrainian).  I
value Yiddish more than any version of it and in certain
areas of life I favor standardization, which is not the
same as Gleichschaltung.
