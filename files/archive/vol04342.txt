Subject: Vaybertaytsh

Lisa-Leah Jenschke's inquiry about the origins of Vaybertaytsh has
prompted a question of my own:

I have in my possession a Yiddish volume printed in Zhitomir in 1850,
entitled Seyfer Noifess Tsufim.  In fact, the title itself already
presents a puzzle:  while the bulk of the book is in Yiddish, the Russian
transliteration of the title is in _Sefardic_ Hebrew, to wit-- Nofet
Tsufim.  But I digress.  The publishers are the brothers Shapira
(Shapiro?): Khanina-Lipa, Arye-Leyb, and Yoyshua-Heshl.  And let me cut
to the chase:  I would like to know what sort of book I've got here.
I've been told by a rabbinic friend that it might be a Tsenurena, but I
personally don't think so. So I will quote, in transliteration, from the
opening lines of the first page, and perhaps an apikoyres or two on this
forum will recognize something from his (or her!) youth.

Before beginning, I want to mention that my Yiddish transliteration is
faithful in one respect to the Galitzianer accent--audible on the written
page!--namely that melupm vov is clearly meant by the author to be
pronounced as a yud throughout; I have transliterated it as such only in
places where standard Yiddish would have used a yud to spell the word. On
the other hand, I have omitted transliterating the author's yud in places
where standard Yiddish omits it.  For example, this text uses a yud
before the final nun in "bashafn";  I omit it.  I have also been faithful
to the absence of punctuation, mainly because I was often unsure as to
where exactly the periods should go.  I'm also not 100% sure of my Hebrew
transliteration.  Btw, the only samekh that appears--ever--is in the
Hebrew quotations; the Yiddish itself renders the s-sound only with a
_sin_.).  So here goes (non-Hebraicists, I assure you there's Yiddish in
among the Hebrew quotations!):

"_Breyshis boro eloyhim es hashomayim v'es ho'orets_ Rabi Shimen zogt es
shteyt _V'asim dvaray b'fikho uv'tseyl yaday kisisikho lintoya shomayim

den mir hobn gelernt b'oysoy sho'o as di divrey toyre geyen aroys fun

b'oysoy sho'o shmekt er zey un es iz tsu im _l'reyakh nikhoyakh_ liber

This is clearly _not_ vaybertaytsh.  But I have never heard of mystical,
perhaps Kabbalistic, material written in Yiddish!  If anyone can offer
any help, I would be very grateful.

Subject: Vayzusye's seykhl

With Purim coming, perhaps some Mendelyaner would care to comment on the
origin of the expression, "Vayzusye's Seykhl."  I understand this phrase
to be yet another way of referring to a fool and I take it that it
derives from the name of the 10th son of Haman (Vyzota), but what do we
know about the 10th son of Haman that led, if the above surmise is
correct, to the expression, vayzusye's seykhl.  Perhaps Reb Meyshe
(Waldoks) can comment?

Subject: Anumelt

Harvey Spiro asked about the etymology of the word _anumelt_ (4.320).
According to the _Groyser verterbukh..._ it goes back to Middle High
German ie-nuo-mal(t) (circumflex on the _a_).

Subject: Gikh

Yude Rozof mentions "af der gikh."  Current German has a colloquialism
"auf die schnelle," meaning "quickly, neglecting thoroughness."  It has
been in common use for no more than 20 or 30 years, and I have been
taking it for an ellipsis from "auf die schnelle Tour" (the quick way).
But "af der gikh" makes me wonder if it isn't much older, or if it has
made its way, recently someway, from Yiddish to German slang.

As for "pameylekh" I have also heard "melekh."  This must be related to
German "allmaehlich" (slowly, gradually) where "all-" is an intensifier
attatched to the near extinct "maehlich."  It is interesting that both
languages now have a prefix in their standard word forms. What is the
general function of the (Slavic?) "pa-" (or "po-")?

Subject: Gikher

I'm probably not telling Mikhl Herzog anything he doesn't already know,
but the use of _gikher_ in the meaning 'rather, preferably' (4.327) is
paralleled by a similar use of Russian _skoree_ and Ukrainian _skorishe_,
both literally meaning 'faster, quicker'.
