Subject: UFRUF and OYF

To Jeremy Stern:

        Despite several responses here questioning your using the
term "orthodox Jews" as if they consituted a seperate regional
dialect, you still seem to be confused about it.   Orthodox Jews
lived in all dialect regions and their speech in America still
reflects that.  Why don't you identify the Modern Orthodox community
where you heard UFRUF?  I can tell you that I come from a large
orthodox Jewish family and among my native Yiddish-speaking uncles,
incidentally all Modern Orthodox, one may hear "ofruf", "ufreef",
and "ufruf" depending on their native dialects. These are the same
variations you will find in the rest of the Yiddish speaking
population, Modern Orthodox or not.  Perhaps what you are finding is
that in certain communities connected with certain popular
synagogues or rabbis, the rabbi's dialectal variant became popular,
and everyone else adjusted.  I know of several cases in America like
that.  This always happened in khasidic courts (Orthodox) and
probably also among students of misnagdishe yeshivas (also
Orthodox), although the latter probably tended to be mostly Litvish
anyway.

        Vos heyst OYF is not originally Yiddish"?   It is part of
Southeastern Yiddish and as someone here has already pointed out
unquestionably kosher .  There is no confusion between the
preposition "oyf" and the adverbial complement "oyf" for the native
Yiddish speaker despite the fact that they are and have always been
spelled the same. Granted, you sometimes see the preposition spelled
aleph fey in books from Litvish publishing houses.  Most speakers
who pronounce the adverbial complement spelled aleph, vov, yud, fey
as OYF to rhyme with loyf pronounce the preposition aleph, vov, yud,
fey "OF" to rhyme with shlof.  Most speakers who pronounce the
adverbial complement ARUF, usually pronounce the preposition as AF.
I think that there are maps of this in Mikhl Herzog's published
thesis where you can see the regional distribution of these dialect
variants.    What you guys may be talking about is interdialectal
confusion between the adverbial complement OYF of one region with
the preposition OYF of another region.  But that is not clear here.
I don't know of any "hacking" by language planners.   The only
decision on the part of language planners I know of is the one to
include the AF pronounciation of the preposition as a variant of OYF
into klal-Yiddish.    What are you referring to?

To Peyrets Mett on this point:

Litvish Jews didn't take up the "UFRUF" pronounciation for this word.  It
corresponds to all the other words with this adverbial complement, e.g.,
uframen, ufgeyn, ufefenen, etc.  There are too many interesting things to
say here about AF but I will make one point.   AF is the exception  not
UFRUF.  It should be pronounced EYF like litvish LEYFN (=loyfn), BREYT
(=broyt), VEYNEN (=voynen) but it isn't.  Mikhl may want to give us the
historical reason for that development.   I don't remember it anymore.

        Note: there are 2 Litvish variants of this, east and west.
              E.g., OYFGEYN in at least southwestern region of
              Lithuania (exact map?) and UFGEYN in White Russia.
