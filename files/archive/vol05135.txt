Subject: Introduction and request

My name is David Lidsky, and I'm a lover of Yiddish.   I've been lurking
around Mendele for a while, but this is my first posting.  I have
recently come across a delightful example of Yiddish pulp literature:
"Amazonen", by Michailevitch, first published in 1913 and subsequently in
1920 by the Hebrew Publishing Company in New York.  I would very much
like to find out more about the author (I suspect his name is a
pseudonym).  Can anyone out there help me?  Thanks and Shone Toyve to
all.

Subject: Khapn

Regarding grabbing, nabbing, and aprehending, I have heard of a couple of
interesting variations of "khapn." According to the memorial book for the
town of Luboml (Yiddish: Libevne) in Volhynia, an action in which the
Germans seized Jews from the streets and houses was called a "khapun."
"Punkt a khoydesh nokhn daytshn araynkum iz plutsling gevorn a groyse behol
behole in di gasn. S'iz bald klor gevorn, az dos iz 'a khapun' (azoy
hot men ongerufn di tsayt, ven men hot in di gasn un hayzer gekhapt yidn).
Ver es hot zikh bahaltn, iz tsaytvaylik geblibn lebn, un di farkhapte,
vos zeyer tsol iz geven hekher 400 mener, hot men mit oytos avekgefirt
hinter der shtot." (Nosn Sobel, "Khronologie fun khurbn," in _Sefer
yizkor le-kehilat Luboml_ (Tel Aviv, n.d.), p.247.)

On a somewhat less terrible note, I have heard that in Borough Park an
action in which a mob of citizens chases after a mugger is called a
"khapts'em." That may be more Yinglish than Yiddish.

Subject: Nabbing and getting

For Neil Jacob's benefit, there is a little ditty that starts out: "Men
khapt un men nemt un men zetst im an....." (one captures, one takes, and
one jails him...) I forgot the rest, if anyone can provide, thanks.

In my house it was always "khop ihm" to denote grab him.

"Vos khopt ihm" was idiom for what's grabbing him or what's wrong with
him.

Subject: Shilumim

The posts responding to Steve Jacobson's question are, of course, quite
accurate in defining the Hebrew word, "shilumim." They didn't, however,
deal with the issue of whether the word can be considered a _Yiddish_
word. (That the _Forverts_ used it is hardly evidence, given the nature
of journalism in general.)

The traditional Yiddish word for "reparations" is _fargitikung_ and was,
indeed, the word used when the acceptance of German reparations was a
hotly-debated issue in Jewish life. Weinreich also offers _reparatsye_; I
can't recall whether that word was ever used in the reparations debate.

Subject: Yiddish & bas/bar mitsves

Hershl Hartman writes in vol. 5.132 that the last line of Lipa Feingold's
song was omitted.  Sorry, it is as follows;

zoln undzer fon nor trogn      let them carry our banner
un nit vern keyn mol mid.      and never tire. (carry our banner forever.)

The sheet music of the song, "der neier yid," arranged by Jack Kammen is
no. 453 of a series of "Kammen Songs,"  copyright 1947 by J. J. Kammen
Music Co., 1619 Broadway, New York 19, N.Y.

I don't know if the music company still exists.  Good luck
Is your, "Credo for a Secular Bar/Bas Mitsve" available?  I concur with
your philosophy.  un a gut gezunt yor tsu ale.

Subject: Itzik Manger's _The Book of Paradise_

I'd appreciate hearing from anyone with information on where I might find
a copy of Itzik Menger's _The Book of Paradise: The Wonderful Adventures
of Shmuel-Aba Avervo_, in English.  A translation by Leonard Wolf was
published by Hill and Wang in New York in 1965, but I haven't been able
to find a copy for sale anywhere.

Thanks.

Subject: ICOR

A few documents relating to ICOR's work in Birobidzhan are located in the
Russian Relief Collection at Yeshiva University Archives.  They are:  an
offprint from the ICOR Yearbook - 1936 (I assume the yearbook is
available elsewhere), a copy of an article with a photo of a tractor
donated by ICOR, a fact sheet in Yiddish and English about ICOR and
Birobidzhan, and a flyer for a lecture by Anna Louise Strong, sponsored
by the NY City ICOR Committee.

Subject: Frida de Cielak's _Arele_

I have seen Frida de Cielak's _Arele_ mentioned several times and would
be very interested in examining it and buying it for my son.  Can anyone
give me the full title, publisher, city and date, as well as price and
from whom it might be purchased?  The Workmen's Circle Book Center has no
record of its existence, and without the bibliographic information it's
hard to ask people to find it for me.  A sheynem damk aykh.
