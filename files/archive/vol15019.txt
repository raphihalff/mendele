Subject: Re: Soviet orthography

I would like to thank both Bob Rothstein and Dovid Braun for their
comments on my general remarks on Soviet orthography, I agree with both
writers, especially with Bob Rothstein's second remark. I should have
put that more precisely. Dovid Braun thinks my remarks quite incorrect.
I may remind him that the original question was about the date of
introduction of the system. I added my note only to indicate that the
spelling of non-L.K. words in the Soviet system is more similar to YIVO
than, for instance, to the spelling used in Harkavy's dictionary. In
The Mendele Review Vol. 01.012 you will find Sholem-Aleykhem's _Motl
Peyse dem Khazns_ Part I, chapters 7 and 8, romanized from the Der
Emes, Melukhe Farlag edition. A reader used to YIVO will have no
difficulties reading a text in Soviet orthography, despite the existing
differences.

Subject: Re: parkh revisted

Since I introduced parkh to the list (as an example of how far you get with
popular etymology), I feel responsible for this affliction and would like
to give Felicitas Payk an answer to his itching question whether:suffixes
"es" and "im" were both used as plural suffixes, or whether "parkhes"
denotes the infection and "parkhim" is referred to those infected.

I am quite sure the answer is, that both plurals can be used with the
same meaning, though parkhes is the usual plural, given in
dictionaries. Other examples of a plural -im for non loshn-koydesh
words are: nar-naronim and dokter-doktoyrim, commented on in earlier
issues of the list. The difference is, that these words have no
alternative plural on -en.

Subject: _parkhes_ vs. "parkhim"

Re the query by Felicitas Payk:

The plural *in Yiddish* of _parkh_ is _parkhes_.  The text where you saw
the -im plural was a Hebrew text; the use of _parkh_ was as a Yiddish
"loan" to the Hebrew, so the regular Hebrew (typically masculine) plural
morpheme was added to the Yiddish word.

An analogy:  the German word _Kindergarten_ is used in English (viz.,
_kindergarten_, although the second element of the compound is typically
Anglicized so that it is pronounced like the English _garden_).  The
plural, *in English*, is _kindergartens_ and not _Kinderga"rtner_.

Subject: Re: Yiddish in Los Angeles

With regards to the spelling of "avada" on YiddishkaytLA's logo, I don't
find their justification to be as unreasonable as Noyekh Miller does. It is
hard to deny that one of the problems with YIVO transcription is the
tendency for English speakers to misread the internal vowel sounds when a
word ends with "e". The argument is whether one should nevertheless use the
YIVO spelling in any case.

Here are some reasons why we should not feel bound to use the Yivo
transcription system when writing in English:

1. Outside of academia, it has never really caught on. If the Jerusalem
Post (for example) uses the word "khutspe" in an article, they usually
spell it chutzpah.

2. Yiddish has an official spelling system, and it uses Yiddish (Hebrew)
letters.  A standard system for transcriptions into Roman letters surely
does not have the same status as an official spelling system.

3. If we grant the YIVO transcription system the status of an _official_
spelling system, then we have two official systems. If we can have two, why
not three or four? In Harkavy's 1897 dictionary, he was able to say
without embarrasment that "Yiddish has two spelling systems: a phonetic and
an etymological...". There are in some situations very good reasons for
wanting to use an etymological system.

4. I have no argument with the YIVO system. I don't see why it shouldn't
co-exist with other systems. Other languages also have dual systems, for
example Chinese which has a modern and a traditional system. For most of
our history, multiple systems have coexisted in Yiddish.

I'm afraid that I made a huge error in my last post on Yiddishkaytla and I
want to rectify it as soon as possible.  By confusing long with short
vowels, I completely turned around the clear meaning of their note to me.
Thus, while 'avada' is an innovation in spelling it isn't what I'd feared,
namely a change in pronunciation.  I'm terribly sorry about this and
apologize to all concerned.

Subject: Re: a rusish lidl

In response to Shaye Doris's inquiry, see pages 167-168 in the anthology
"Lider fun dor tsu dor" (Songs of Generations) by Yosl Mlotek z"l and Chana
Mlotek. This song, titled "Shpil, gitar!" , is prefaced with a note
explaining that it is a translation of a Russian song "Chto mnie gore" by
Samuil Iakolevich Pokrass (1894-1939).

The refrain printed in this version:

tsu vos zhe zorgn
farn morgn
fil dem bekher on mit vayn
heyb dem bekher
hekher, hekher
in dem vayn fargeyt der payn

The three verses printed in this version:

shpil, gutar, biz mayn tsar vet oyfhern
zoln platsn di strunes on a tsol.
kh'vil mit vayn un shampayn shiker vern
un fargesn vos geven iz a mol

di tsigayner, zey ruen un shlofn
un me hert shoyn keyn lidl nisht meyn
nor kol-zman s'iz faran vayn a tropn
iz dos lebn un der toyt shoyn alts eyns

alt un shvakh, on a dakhm iz farblibn
a tsigayner, a held, gants aleyn
ferdlekh ganvenen, meydlekh fil libl
er flegt zingen dos lid azoy sheyn.
