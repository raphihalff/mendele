Sholem aleykhem un grusn fun oystralye,
 
In Rokhl Korns lid "Der elfter lefl" gefint zikh a shure: 
 
"Host efsher feld far ale, vi dem shoyfets marte?"
 
Vos oder ver iz dem shoyfets marte?
 
Ikh dank aykh gor hartsik far ayer hilf. 
 
Mit vareme grusn,
 
Hinde Burshtin

Subject: Song Lyrics Sought (Reyzele)
 
Leah Szlanger of Ha-Cameri and Kol-Yisroel recorded the song in question (Reyzele, hot zi an eyzele). I am sure she would oblige with the lyrics, or if you can't reach her, contact me and I'll put you in touch with her.
 
Best,
 
Shane Baker

Subject: "milionike"
 
Ikh bin mispael gevorn fun der ashires vos ligt avekgeleygt umbamerkt tsvishn di milionike obyektn in YIVO-Arkhiv.  Does "milionike" here mean "a million or so" or "millions" or something else?
 
Thanks in advance,
Martin Jacobs

Subject: "shantazh" and "spodik"
 
In a recent article in the Yiddish Forward (September 16 - 22) regarding the Palestinian Authority's request for membership to the UN Security Council, the word "Shantazh" was mentioned a number of times (always with quotation marks).  I could not find this word in either Uriel Weinreich's or Harkavy's dictionary.
 
The writer also used the expression "dreyt dem spodik." Again, neither Weinreich or Harkavy  contain the word "spodik"
 
If any Mendele members could enlighten me, I would greatly appreciate it.

Subject: Yiddish absent from "The Great Courses"
 
The well known project called "The Great Courses" has produced dozens of courses covering a wide range of subjects including several about Jewish subjects.
I have in hand a catalogue in which there is a series of lectures entitled "Introduction to Judaism". It consists of twenty four half-hour lectures covering many aspects of Judaism, but nowhere do I see any mention of Yiddish, Yiddish literature or Yiddishkeit. So my question is: are not these also part of Judaism? If not, what
shall they be called?

Subject: Additional queries about heirs/estates of Yiddish writers
 
As managing editor of the Posen Library of Jewish Culture and Civilization, the ten-volume series being published by Yale University Press, I am trying to establish who holds the copyright for a number of Yiddish works from the interwar period. It would be great if we could all post this information to a central file! The writers whose heirs or 
rights we are seeking, so that we can translate works, include the following:
 
Berlin, Meir
 
Horonczyk, Shimon
 
Kacyzne, Alter
 
Kaganovskii, Efraim
 
Korn, Rokhl
 
Liberman, Hayim
 
Nomberg, Hersh Dovid
 
Opatoshu, Joseph
 
Pinski, David
 
Rabon, Yisroel
 
Rozental, Anna
 
Shneour, Zalman
 
Varshavskii, Oyzer
 
Wasserman, Elhanan
 
Zeitlin, Aharon
 
Zeitlin, Elchonon
 
 
I thank you for any leads you might have.
 
Sincerely,

Subject: "kick" oyf yidish
 
The two words that I know of are "shtoys" and "kop." As a kid we knew a joke based on the latter: A rich, but ignorant, man seeking a talmid khokhem as a potential son-in-law has a candidate tested by the local melamed. In his presence, the young man and teacher are seated at the table with a gomore opened in front of the candidate, who happens to be no scholar. In fact the whole process bores him. So he aims a good swift kick at the melamed's shin who cries out "oy, iz dos a kop." The potential father is impressed by what he thinks is a complementary remark about the young man's brilliance and he offers him a large nodn.

In reply to Les Train: my Harduf dictionary gives "kopen" (kof, alef, peh, ayen, final nun) for the verb "kick." However, another anglicized source gave me "briken."
