Subject: Frida de Cielak's "Arele"

Marti Krow-Lucal asks about Frida de Cielak's "Arele," a 3-volume Yiddish
workbook published in Mexico in 1982.  I ordered it from the National
Yiddish Book Center, 48 Woodbridge St., South Hadley, MA 01075.  Phone:
413-585-8200. It was a perfect beginner's book for my 10-year-old.  Now
we're working our way through Joseph Mlotek's 3-volume "Yidishe Kinder,"
available from Workmen's Circle, which is just right after "Arele."

Subject: _Arele_

Martha Krow-Lucal writes that the Jewish Book Center of The Workmen's
Circle is unfamiliar with the book "Arele" by Frieda de Cielak. Nothing
could be farther from the truth. We are very familiar with the book. We
don't carry it for several reasons. They are:

1. It uses highly stylized lettering that some people find hard to read.

2. It was rapidly going up in price. "Arele" is a three book set that
when I last was interested listed for $40.00

3. It didn't sell. When I had them, no one wanted them. When I don't have
it, people want it. For a bookseller, it is a highly maddening state of
affairs.

4. When we would order the book from Ms. de Cielak, her invoices would be
accompanied by long notes informing us that she continued to hold the
copyright.

5. Lastly, it was always a pain to set up the shipping and billing of her
books.

As I recall, the book is entirely in Yiddish. For some people, this is
exactly what they want.  I believe Fishl Kutner (Fishlfishl@aol.com) has
her latest address.

Subject: Women of the Yiddish left

I'd like some input on the subject of women in the Yiddish left.  From
personal knowledge they certainly seemed to be assertive and quite
active.  For instance, my grandmother, Bessie Solomon, helped form an
Emma Lazurus Club in the Bronx.  On the other hand, this was a woman's
auxillary, by definition less important than the male led IWO.  Were
radical Yiddish women more "empowered" and "powerful" than other Jewish
women?  Were/are Jewish women any better off in this regard than their
non Jewish peers?  I've done some reading on this: _Daughters of the
Shtetl_ by Susan Glenn; "What Made Yetta Work?" by Charlotte Baum; and
"Culture and Radical Politics: Yiddish Women Writers, 1890 - 1940."

If anyone has any useful sources to read, and/or opinions on the matter
I'd be grateful.

Subject: Khapn

Just wanted to follow up Daniel Soyer's message referring to khapts 'em
for the act of getting a mugger. What your dealing with probably is the
Central Yiddish colloquial custom of adding (e)ts to imperatives, which
refer back to the use of "ets" instead of "ir" in the nominative for 2nd
person plural of "you". Mike Burshteyn sings a beautiful song from a
Manger work (Di Megile). "Flits, feygelakh, flits getraye, oyf der malke
Ester's dakh." I.B. Singer has a spoken recording, which, because I only
spoke the klal shprakh at the time, was very hard for me to understand. A
sentence which stood out, if I remember it correctly, was one at the
beginning of a mayse: "Ets gleybt nisht kinderlakh, vel ekh aakh
dertsayln". Now that's eynmol dialect! Em instead of im is also very
common, and some scholars like Solomon Birnbaum, *prefer* eykh, eym (em)
for ikh, im. So that should give Daniel and anyone else that's
interested, a kik araan in poylish yidish. I pray *I* got it right!

Subject: Khop

In Brooklyn (or at least Brownsville) "khop" was used as a more vigorous
form of "take" than "nem" including, but not limited to, "grab, nab or
steal."  Eventually it became yinglishized into "cop," (on the west coast
"kype").  So if you got caught "copping" something, you might "cop a
plea" (plead guilty to a lesser charge).
