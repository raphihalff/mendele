Subject: El-Al's disdain of Yiddish

Let me add a word about the dismissal of Yiddish by the El-Al higher ups:
In 1979 after the release of "Future and Past" Kapelye's first LP, I sent
a promotional copy of the disc to El-Al and suggested that since this was
a "Jewish" airline and since they offered the obvious Hebrew and
not-so-obvious Italian, Spanish, French and other languages, they offer a
cut or two of Yiddish to their passengers as part of their in-flight
entertainment. I received a curt and inane reply which defended their
employing other languages and not Yiddish, because they could point to
passengers speaking those other languages but not Yiddish! (I guess all
those khsidim must be yammering in Esperanto...)

Since I used to operate mail.yiddish, from which Mendele split off, I
think I can comment here.  Noyekh's concern about mail.yiddish was that
it was all jokes and ditties, with no serious discussion. To my
suggestion that he start serious discussion, he replied that the serious
Yiddish academics wouldn't participate as long as the mailing list
contained jokes and ditties.  Hence Mendele was formed, in May 1991, and
since we started to see duplication, I eventually stopped mail.yiddish.

Meanwhile Mendele has gotten somewhat more relaxed, and jokes do show up.
I sense that Noyekh isn't worried about them, since the overall tone of
Mendele is very different from the old mail.yiddish.

But I think Mikhl is misreading Howard Kaplan's concern.  By all means
let Mendele be a place for scholarly discussion.  But that does not mean
its primary content should consist of criticism of others' Yiddish
orthography or grammar.  I believe in following the YIVO standard of
romanization, but I also believe that public criticism of those who
aren't familiar enough to use it is pointless.  Better would be a polite
_private_ note to the "offender", accompanied by a summary of how to do
it the YIVO way.  Then maybe Mendele can revert to more interesting and
fruitful discussions.

(P.S. the mail.yiddish archives can be downloaded from news.lsuc.on.ca,
directory "pub/mail.yiddish", files 01 through 53, via anonymous ftp.  Or
I can mail them to anyone who wants them.  It ran from October 1988 to
March 1992, so I guess it is just now being overtaken by Mendele as the
world's longest-running Internet Yiddish mailing list!)

I believe this is particularly common for people who learn Yiddish in a
home environment but never learn about alternative dialects or how to
read and write (both of which force you to separate the morphemes and
understand how your streams of sound are strung together).

When my wife (Simone) and I first met in 1977, I spoke no Yiddish but had
studied German and Hebrew (and was studying Linguistics in undergrad at
the time), and she used it with her parents (who are survivors, from
Poland originally, and came here after the war).  I decided to learn
Yiddish so that I wouldn't be left out of her family discussions (and we
later decided to speak only Yiddish to our kids, who are now fluent, but
that's another story).

At one point early in our relationship (and early in my study of
Yiddish), Simone told me that she'd spoke Yiddish "fun kindvazoo".
Kindvazoo?  What's a vazoo?  Simone had no idea; the phrase just meant
that she'd always spoken Yiddish.

It was some time before we were able to dissect the phrase, assisted by
my analysis of Simone's vowel patterns, and realizing that "oo" as a word
ending is actually "op" or "on".  (For example, to tell a child to get
down from somewhere they shouldn't be, "standard" Yiddish is "gey arop",
while we say "gay aroo".)

The phrase is actually "fun kindvayz on" -- from childhood on.
