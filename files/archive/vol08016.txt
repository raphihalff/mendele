Subject: Shvitnik

I am reading a story about a "Brunem Und a Nisht-Guter".  In the story, the
word "Shvitnik" shin, tzvei vovn, yud, tes, nun, yun, koof, appears.  This
Shvitnik is also referred to as a "Nisht-Guter".  Does anyone have an idea
about this term or name?

Subject: a shande un a charpa

Rick Turkel writes: "Not "charpa" but "kherpa," from the Hebrew "xerpa"
(disgrace, shame)."

In Polish Yiddish (at least) the pronunciation is khArpe.

Actually 'e' before 'r' frequently seems to get pronounced A (but i'm no
expert)

Subject: Yiddish terms of endearment

I am looking for a few words in Yiddish to incorporate into a short story. 
The story is set in the early part of this century and the two characters
involved (an elderly married couple) are speaking to each other at a dinner
party and mix some Yiddish terms of endearment for each other into their
conversation.  There is another couple at the same table, recent immigrants
to the US, who are from Eastern Europe who become embarrassed by the use of
the terms. 

It is a minor scene in the story but important to its development.  Trouble
is that I do not have any "terms of endearment" in Yiddish to put into the
story that an elderly couple (early 70's) would use with each other,
especially from this period.  Can you help me by providing a couple of words
and providing me with translations of what is their closest English
equivalent? 

I got directed to MENDELE from Mark David over at Yiddish Radio.  In part the
idea of including the scene in the story was inspired from the
pyscho-analytic books and sections of books I've read on the Jewish
experiences prior to WWII by Sanders Gilman.. 

I look forward to your response. 
Thanks.

Subject: Shosha

I received the following inquiry from a Hebrew University 66-67 colleague Jay
Beder (beder@csd.uwm.edu):

"Well, I'm reading Shosha, and while it's a wonderful book, I'm annoyed with
the translation.  There are a lot of times when something should have been
left in transliteration or with original terminology -- even with a footnote. 
And I'd be very curious as to how Singer expresses himself in Yiddish on
things like Kant and art.  Do you know of a good translation?  Or better, is
there a version in Yiddish that I could compare?  Best of all, I can imagine
a text having the Yiddish on one side and a translation on the facing page --
has anyone published such a thing?"

Subject: Elyakum Zunser's poem "Der prom"

I am anxious to obtain the text of a poem by Elyakum Zunser (or should his
name be Tsunser?) called "Der prom", (the ferry). I would be very grateful if
someone could provide me with this.

Subject: Swiss/Yiddish

Gitl Dubrovsky and a number of others have written that they could understand
Swiss German and/or be understood speaking Yiddish by S-G speakers. If the
point is that Yiddish and Swiss German therefore have some special origin
apart from other Germanic varieties, I would like to note something. 

First, it is very common that speakers of one language can more or less get
along in a closely related language, especially in the area of comprehension.
Slovak speakers understand a fair amount of Polish, French speakers
understand a fair amount of Italian, Marathi speakers understand a fair
amount of Hindi, etc. So all that these anecdotes show is that Swiss German
and Yiddish are closely related, which we already knew.

Second, as a mere imperfect speaker of Yiddish, I have no trouble following
the dialog in German movies, so long as they're talking about mundane things,
and I had no trouble understanding Germans in simple service encounters on my
trips to Germany, and I even managed to kvetch out a few sentences that were
comprehensible to them. So this suggests that New High German is also closely
related to Yiddish -- no news there... 

Third, it occurs to me that the reason that understanding Swiss German on the
basis of Yiddish is so newsworthy to some people is that ENGLISH is the
oddball in this domain -- a monolingual speaker of English can't understand
any other Germanic language, even the most closely related ones (e.g.
Frisian). But this is because English has had a very unusual history and
underwent extraordinarily profound changes at the end of the Middle English
period (and due to the prior occupation of England by Anglo-Norman, i.e.
French, speakers). And these changes affected every level of the language --
the sound system, the lexicon, the morphology (endings), the grammar, the
works. 

Anyway, my point is: If you understand Swiss German (or any other Germanic
variety) on the basis of your knowledge of Yiddish, just be happy that their
relatedness affords you that benefit but don't infer that there's anything
very special about this relatedness.

Subject: "Muselman" and the Concentration camps

I received the following communication from a writer and researcher for help
on the following:

"Thought you might be able to help me with the etymology of the word
"musulman" as used in the concentration camps of eastern Europe to mean, "A
human bag of skin and bones ready to enter the next stage before death called
a "lunatik". 

I have spoken with many survivors and about one-half seem to recall hearing
the word "musulman" used to mean a human skeleton prior to their
incarceration in the shtetls of Poland. The other half heard it for the first
time in the lagers. No survivor I have interviewed knew that musulman in
Spanish means Muslim.  ALthough Primo Levi's translators use the English word
Muslim in translation, no one explains it. I have had discussions with
Auschwitz, Treblinka and Sobibor survivors who insist that there is no
meaning of the word muselman other than as used in the camps. 

In Southern Spain I learned to use the word muselman in public and the
slightly pejorative "moro" only in private. Saraceno, moro, mozarabe,
musulman: but only musulman in puplic. 

Do you know anything about this?  During the reconquest of Spain were the
Moors horribly starved and persecuted before the Jews were? That might
account for the the ladino word eventually working it's way into the Yiddish
with the new meaning". 

Let me know if you can shed any light on this matther, since this is beyond
my ken. I will send your replies to the writer. 

Thank you.

From: Stan Nadel <nadels@swosu.edu>
Subject: Ganef

A Manaster Ramer recently made a point by alluding to the English slang use
of ganef, saying: "It turns out that dictionaries of English slang used to
(maybe still do) often give fanciful etymologies of words which are obviously
of Yiddish origin, e.g., ganef from gone off!!  Now, how do we KNOW that this
is meshugge and that ganef is from Yiddish?  I don't know how, but we do." 

Not to distract from his excellent point, but for those who are curious about
this example: 

It seems that gonef (sometimes gonnoff, hence the false etemolgy)  entered
American and English slang via what is known as thieves cant.  One of the
traditional occupations for Jews in Europe and America was as pawnbrokers.
That is an occupation which tends to bridge the border between the criminal
and business worlds.  At the margin, the line between pawnbroker and fence
(handler of stolen goods) is often obscured and some Jews played an importnat
role in the criminalized underground economy of large cities.  To provide a
concrete example from my own research, I'll offer up the notorious Fredrika
"Marm" Mandelbaum of New York--who was alleged to have gone from fence to
crime boss and veritble female Morriarity in the third quarter of the 19th
century (see George W.  Walling's *Recollections of a New York Chief of
Police*--which has a thieves slang appendix which, as I remember, included
the term gonef defined as a pickpocket.  Herbert Asbury later defined
"gonnoff" as "a thief who has attained the higher walks of his profession"). 
I had assumed it moved into American English from German Jewish immigrants in
New York (like Mrs. Mandelbaum) until I learned it was also present in 18th
century London's thieves cant.  Then I was told by a specialist on the 18th
century London underworld that Jewish fences played a key role in linking the
London underworld with markets in Amsterdam (he says they claimed they could
fence anything, including the crown jewels), and that this is the source of
Yiddish loan words in English thieves cant.  So we have two possible sources
for the American usage-- Anglo-American thieves cant via London and
German-American thieves cant directly from the Yiddish.
