Subject: Taharas hamishpokhe

The phrase "taharas hamishpokhe" was used as the title of a
book on the topic by Rabbi Mordecai Aaron Kaplan.  Kaplan
was the rabbi of the Bnai Yehudah shul in Boro Park,
Brooklyn, for many years.  The book was published in New
York in 1923. It's mainly in Yiddish, but there is also an
English section with an English title page, which reads as
follows: "Family Purity (Taarath Hamishpocho) from a Jewish
Religious and Hygienic Standpoint."

I just happened to come across this reference, I haven't
done a survey of the topic, but I thought this might help
the person who was trying to trace usage of the term in the
US (if that was indeed the question!)

well, nice try, but it doesn't quite work. what's deleted
is 'a mentsh', not 'es'. the 'es' disappears if anything
precedes the verb, as in :

	in gas shteyt a mentsh

it seems as tho this 'es' is very superficial, just being
inserted if it's a canonical declarative sentence and
there's nothing preceding the (tensed) verb.

as for 'der yid, vos er redt mit mayn froy,...', that seems
to be something else again--the 'er' actually refers to
something, to the yid in this example, whereas the 'es' in
the previous example doesn't refer to anything. note that
the 'er' changes depending on what it refers to, while the
'es' is invariant:

	a yid, vos er redt mit...
	a froy, vos zi redt mit...
	a bukh, vos es iz aroyskumen...

vs.:    es ligt a yid/a froy/a bukh oyfn tish

so, whatever this 'es' is, it doesn't seem to be the same as
the 'er/zi/...' in the relative clause.

would this be related to the -et in 'oykhet' as a variant
of 'oykh'?

Subject: Es

To Eli Katz:
Eli, let me give you the actual sentences again.
 
1. The "es" group, in which "es" is unstressed:
i) alemen hot men "es" oysgeharget
ii) vos hostu "es" nekhtn azoy geveynt?
iii) es hobn zey "es" zikh azoy geshlogn (Stress ZEY!)
iv) efsher vet "es" di mame trinken tey
 
2. The "a" sentence:
ver es hot "anor" farshtanen un ver es hot "anor" gevust
 
I think your recollection may have been a bit off in both
cases. The "es" sentences don't seem to "transform" in the
manner of your example. The "anor" form doesn't appear to
belong to the words that are marked for "directionality".
 
3. Concerning the "-et" words:
kum(t) araynet; gey(t) aveket; krikh(t) aropet; tu(t) zikh
onet; shtey(t) ufet; any other?. Very "Litvish", right?
 
I don't know its origin but I do know that it overlaps
another phenomenon which overlaps still a third. I do know
the origin of the last of these. I'll try to link them,
thus:
 
1) Words like "avek" have a verbal quality: AVEK(ET)! 'beat
it!'. Similarly verbalized: SHA! '(be) quiet!'; NA! 'here'
(i.e. 'take it!').
 
2) Note, plural NAT AYKH! with regional variant NATS
(AYKH). Similarly, regional plural variants of such
verbalized forms: SHATS! 'be quiet', and AVEKTS (a favorite
way of driving off dogs, by the way).
 
3) The regional (much of Poland) form of the second person
plural and plural imperative, GAYTS, KIMTS, VAYNTS NISHT,
which, historically, go along with the regional forms of
the pronouns ETS and ENK (derived from an old dual, as I
recall). The features of the system, have diverged from one
another in Yiddish so that the distribution of the
imperative with -TS extends eastward far beyond the
stigmatized ETS/ENK pronouns. KUMTS, GEYTS, VEYNTS NISHT
are also the rule in otherwise "Litvish"-sounding speech in
northeastern Poland.
 
So, what's the connection? Vos hot eyns tsu ton mitn dritn?
Eyns tsum dritn iz nisht keyn mekhitn, they say. Or is it?
I'm not sure I know.
 
Finally, the ec/-ts forms provide (even a Litvak) the clue
to the mystery of the following conversation:
 
tsOtsidikI?  mOtsidikI! nu, abI tsOtsi.
 
Hot mir ale a gut un gezunt yor!
