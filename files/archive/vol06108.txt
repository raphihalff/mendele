Subject: Kalekh hakn

This is in connection with the song that Leonard Prager [6.100].

Incidentally we read his article on Yiddish Vaudeville in London, which
we liked very much.  We wanted to inform him and the readers that the
song he cites comes from the operetta Hertsele Meyukhes or Taybele by
Moyshe Richter (l87l-l939).  The play was quite famous in its time -
written in l899, performed for the first time in the Thalia Theater in
New York.  The particular song "Khave Leye - gut-shabes" was sent in to
the Perl fun yidisher poezye in the Yiddish Forward in l973.  One
version that we printed reads:

Vi es kumt fraytik in der fri
Zets ikh mir nit tsi
A bisele optsuruen.

Ikh muz in mark araynloyfn
Un ales aynkoyfn
Akhuts in der shtub tsu tuen.

Koyln hakn, bulkes bakn
A fish a dikn, tsholnt rukn
Shnaydn, varglen, lokshn kokhn
Un khreyn darfn shobn
Un nisht fargesn di yoykh
shoymen
Un arbes, tsibeles, fleysh, floymen
Far dem alem darft ir
gornisht zorgn.

Bald nbokh di kugl morgn
Vet dos kepele zayn oysgetsvogn
Un opgeputst di shikh mit di lates
Un ir vet mir ale kenen zogn:
Khave-Leye, gut-shabes!

We also printed this opening stanza:

Der fraytikdiker tog
Iz a tsore, a plog
Dos veyst dokh ayeder.
A tshad, a roykh
Men arbet mit koykh
Der kop geyt oyf reder
Khale bakn
Koyln hakn
Fish optsushobn, etc.

The song can be heard on Ruth Rubin's ethnographic record. I believe its
title is Jewish Life in the Old Country. (Bob Friedman, correct me if
I'm wrong).

Subject: Kalekh

[Regarding Kayle Goodman's shayle (6.102):]

This "kalekh" is German Kalk, meaning lime. "Auskalken" is German
for whitewash.

Subject: "Please" and other issues

Regarding a Yiddish equivalent for "please," I dont think Leah Krikun
(6.106) got my point.  there are numerous ways of verbally expressing
that concept in Yiddish, and there's no need to adopt a new word,
especially one that may or may not be understood by all Yiddish
speakers.  Languages dont have to have exact equivalences to survive and
to express the full range of human experience.  One language may use a
single word, another a phrase or even a long sentence--or simply a
gesture or a nod.  it makes no sense using English (or any other
language) as a standard for Yiddish, let each language develop its own
standards and habits.

A Yiddish speaker who tells a friend" "ziiiiiits" with his voice
shifting a full octave is being just as polite as the Frenchman who
says, "Mais assieds-toi, je t'en prie"--each speaker accompanying his
invitation with the appropriate gestures of his culture.

Anyway:  talking about how Yiddish says one thing or another is mere
rhetoric if people refuse to speak or write Yiddish or use it in their
correspondence.

I just received an e-mail from a self-styled Yiddishist, who raved and
ranted against the use of alleged "daytshmerizms" like "bitte."  His
letter was written almost entirely in (awkward) English, and the few
Yiddish phrases that he came up with consistently ignored the rules of
case, gender, and tense and also contained words that don't even exist
in Yiddish.

When I first subscribed to Mendele, I stuck to Yiddish in my postings,
but I soon noticed that the vast majority of messages were in
English--especially from self-proclaimed Yiddishists vociferously
advocating the survival of Yiddish.

A Yiddish speaker or writer who uses "daytshmerisms" (soi-disants) is at
least using Yiddish.  someone who objects to "daytshmerisms" but does so
in English is not really helping Yiddish in any way.

In my private correspondence with other Mendelyaners, I use Yiddish, but
in my postings I've switched to English.  I would much prefer seeing
those who can do so writing their postings in Yiddish.

Subject: Daytshmerish

As I've mentioned before, numerous complaints about "daytshmerish" seem
to come from people who prefer making their complaints in English rather
than in Yiddish.

A further problem is the fact that such plaintiffs fail to deal with the
purely linguistic and stylistic issues of "daytshmerish."  When Max
Weinreich wrote "Daytsmerish toyg nisht" he accepted borrowings from
modern German if they were used by Mendele--that was his cut-off point.
I'm not sure what our cut-off point would be today--especially given the
habits of native Yiddish speakers who use many words and phrases
condemned in the English-language attacks....  I recall that Shloyme
Birnbaum refused to accept even "geshikhte" in place of "historye," etc.

I'm not too interested in the ethical questions of German
borrowings--I'm much more curious about the way they're used by Yiddish
speakers and writers.

For instance:  German "Monat" became "monat" in Yiddish, which, however,
came up with a whole new plural:  "monaten" (stress on second syllable)
instead of German "Monate" (stress on first syllable).

German "Stufe" means both a literal step (in a stairway, etc.), and an
abstract level;  Yiddish "shtufe" means only the latter and is thus
fairly synonymous with "madreyge."

German says "die Erlaubnis" (feminine), Yiddish says "dos derloybenish"
(neuter).

German says:  "Er hat Selbstmord begangen";  Yiddish says:
"Er _iz_ selbstmord bagangen."  Etc., etc.

There are probably thousands of such differences between Yiddish
and German in regard to modern borrowings from the latter language.  and
in addition, their uses in Yiddish writers are quite fascinating.

Subject: Vi a toytn bankes

On another aspect of this expression:  the pronunciation I have heard
for "bankes" employs a soft (palatalized) "n", presumably as is present
in the Slavic word from which it has been derived.

I am wondering how common this phenomenon may be.  If the distinction
between hard and soft consonants is frequently maintained in Yiddish
speech, then I would have expected that it would be indicated somehow in
Yiddish writing, either in the formal spelling system or by some
informal convention (such as using the apostrophe in transliteration
--i.e., "ban'kes").  Is this done?  If not, was it discussed as a
possibility in the development of the YIVO orthography?  And, if the
distinction is not phonemic in Yiddish, should one say that Slavic loan
words like "bankes" are not completely naturalized?
