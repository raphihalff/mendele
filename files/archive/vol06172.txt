Subject: Slavic influence on Yiddish syntax (non-technical)

Those Mendelyaner who chose not to follow the linguistic discussion
about Slavic and Yiddish syntax missed (at least) two important general
points made by Ellen Prince and others.  The first is that not every
phenomenon that is present in Yiddish and Slavic, but not in German, is
necessarily due to Slavic influence.  Before jumping to conclusions one
needs to look at older Yiddish (before massive contact with Slavic) and
also at the developments in other Germanic languages and dialects.

The second point is that outside influences (e.g., of Slavic on Yiddish)
may come in the form of encouraging developments that were already
inherent in the influenced language.  This seems to be at least part of
the story of the development of verbal pre- fixation in Yiddish. (For
some more details, see my "Yiddish Aspectology," a review article
occasioned by the 1986 publication of Mordkhe Schaechter's
groundbreaking 1951 dissertation, _Aktionen im Jiddischen_, in _Studies
in Yiddish Linguistics_, ed. Paul Wexler [Tubingen, 1990].)

P.S. On "Slavic" vs. "Slavonic":  The former is the preferred version in
the United States; the latter, in the United Kingdom and, I believe, in
Canada.  Thus the _Slavic and East European Journal_ is published in the
US, while the _Slavonic and East European Review_ appears in England,
and the origin of _Canadian Slavonic Papers_ should be obvious.  One odd
subregularity:  the earliest written Slavic is referred to as "Old
Church Slavonic" by Harvard-trained Slavists (and their students, and
their students' students) but as "Old Church Slavic" by Yale-trained
Slavists (and their students, and their students' students).

Subject: Slavic influence on Yiddish syntax

thanks to joachim neugroschel for correcting my error that german was
like english with respect to 'sequence of tenses' -- _very_ interesting
to me to learn that it is not!  question to joachim or other german
speakers: how would you say the following in german?:

	when i was a child, i always knew when i was going to get sick.
	i thought you wouldn't come back. (but you came back!)

also, what do you think of this line from remarque's _all quiet on the
western front_ in the original german and in (singer's) yiddish
translation? my german isn't even good enough to be called 'terrible' ;)
but it looks as tho the german has a past tense where yiddish has the
present tense, no? does this sound stilted in the spoken language?

	'wir mussten erkennen, dass unser alter ehrlicher WAR als
	das ihre...' (impropylaeen-verlag, berlin, 1929, p. 18)

	'mir hobn gemuzt aynzen, az in undzer elter IZ men erlekher,
	vi in zeyern.' (kleckin, warsaw, 1929, p. 23)

	'we had to recognize that our generation WAS more to be
	trusted than theirs.' (little brown & co, boston, 1929, p.10)

re joachim's point about the verb-second constraint in the
interrogative, several comments are in order. first, i believe that both
german and yiddish have a 'verb-first' order in the interrogative -- the
verb-second constraint is strictly for declaratives. second, the
position of _tsi_ 'if/whether' in yiddish is generally construed as the
same position as the other question words, e.g. _ver_ 'who', _vos_
'what', etc, a position that is outside the clause proper and that
doesn't count as 'initial field'. (in modern syntax, it's called the
'complementizer' position.) e.g.:

	tsi redt er rusish? 'does he speak russian?'
	ver redt rusish? 'who speaks russian?'
	farvos redt er rusish?... 'why is he speaking russian?'

the 'out of the clause' position is more easily observable if we look at
indirect questions, which are declaratives and which (in yiddish) obey
the verb-second constraint:

     ikh veys nit tsi er redt rusish. 'i don't know if/who/why...'
     	          ver es redt rusish.
		  farvos er redt rusish.

     ikh veys nit tsi dort redt er rusish. 'i don't know if/who/why...there'
		  ver dort redt rusish.
		  farvos dort redt er rusish.

(this is more or less the same position that other 'complementizers'
occupy, e.g. ikh hof AZ er vet kumen 'i hope he comes', ...KEDEY er zol
kenen zen '...so that he can see', dos bukh VOS ikh leyen 'the book i'm
reading', a simen AZ ikh bin a nar 'a sign that i'm a fool'.)

so again i think the only influence of slavic here is lexical -- yiddish
borrowed the polish yes/no question word _tsi_ -- but it fit it in to
its germanic syntax.

re reflexives, i'm grateful to meyer-leyb wolf for pointing out that
polish doesn't use a reflexive for _er hot zikh gekoyft a hoyz_ --
_kupil sobie dom_. wow, _sobie_ sure _looks_ reflexive to me -- but what
do i know? (do you or does anyone know what IS the 3rd pers singular
reflexive form in polish? it's really unusual for a language to have
_any_ reflexive forms and not use them for the 3rd person, which is why
i'm particularly interested.)

Subject: Question intonation

The several participants in the discussion over the possible Slavic
influence on Yiddish syntax have been very interesting and informative.
With all respect to Joachim Neugroschel's prowess as a translator, I am
puzzled by his statements on intonation [6.168].

He says, "A connected issue is the inflection of a question: In an
English question, the voice always goes up; 'Where are you going?' but
in German the voice rises only if there is no interrogative word."
Actually, we have statistical data on the matter for spoken English
which indicate that the situation is similar to what he describes for
German. Questions like "Where are you going?" and "What is he doing?"
are likely to have a falling intonation at the end unless certain
special affects are being conveyed. For example, "What is he doing" at a
higher voice register with a rise in pitch at the end may indicate that
the speaker didn't quite hear what had just been said.

Without an interrogative word, e.g., "You're coming?," a sentence can be
said with a rising pitch to show that it is not a statement.
Superficially, one might say that it is a question, but, if so, it is a
question conveying surprise or skepticism or the like. Of course, if it
is worded "Are you coming?," an ordinary downward pitch movement, as for
a statement, is quite normal; nevertheless, here too one can use a
rising inflection, perhaps coupled with an overall higher voice
register, to signal various attitudes of the speaker.

Joachim also says about Yiddish, "In Yiddish, the voice seems to go up
at the end of every question, but I wonder if there are regional
differences." I must say that my own experience with a scattering of
native speakers does not support his assertion. That is, except for the
detailed shapes of the intonation contours, the "rules" may be be rather
similar to the ones I have outlined for English. I hasten to add that
his question about regional dialects is reasonabale and relevant, as it
is for any language. Indeed, it is easy  to observe intonational
differences between American and British English.

Perhaps Mikhl Herzog's data base contains information on varieities of
intonation contours over the territory of Yiddish.
