Subject: dos and es

It has been over two months since I left Jerusalem till I
relogged to Mendele here at Harvard, and it seems that I
have missed a lot. I especially am interested in Ellen
Prince's contribution on es and dos, since she was present
at the Jerusalem conference on Yiddish, where I presented a
paper on this topic. How can I get this stuff?

Also, since Ellen has not responded to my e-mail messages
to her, may I use this list to reiterate my desire to read
her 1988 paper on Expletive Es and Subject position in
Yiddish, which appeared in the IPrA Papers in Pragmatics.
If anyone has a copy of it, I would greatly appreciate a
xerox. Harvard library does not have this publication
(ordered but not received).

Subject: Warsaw's ghetto revolt. 50 years.

In relation to the commeration of the 50th. aniversary of
the gettto Warsaw's revolt, we are organizing delegations
from Israel that will emphasize Iddysch language to honor
the culture of the European Jews. With this purpose we met
the President of Israel Haim Herzog, who was very
simpathetic to our goal and wishes.

We would like that o ther delegations from all over will
join this initiative. The official events in Poland will
start the 18th. of April and will continue all over the
week (the Israeli delegation of the Hemshej Dor will also
visit Hungary and Checkoslovaky). As soon as we shall have
more details about oiur program, we shall send it to
Mendele.

If anyone whishes to propose some ideas, please write to me
to: morim@ccsg.tau.ac.il

Daniel Galay.

well, you for one, obviously... it's my husband's name and
he's from egypt. his paternal grandfather was from germany
and he changed it from 'prinz' to 'prince'--not to make a
jewish-looking name into an english-looking one but to make
a german-looking name into a french-looking one. egyptian
jews were typically francophone, and egypt was always
allied with england/france against germany, so it didn't
pay to have a german name in egypt. the name change took
place in the late 19th century. alas, there's no 'p' in
arabic, so they were called 'brince', with the french
vowel, rhymes more or less with english 'pants'. on my
in-laws' ketuba (alexandria, 1939) it's spelled
bet-resh-nun-samekh--clearly the jewish scribe's dominant
language was arabic.

btw, the best (most credible) etymology i've seen for
'prinz/prince' qua jewish name is italian 'firenze' (= city
of florence)--if you spell it in hebrew, you can see how
that could be.

my maiden name was 'friedman', which my father changed from
'friedmann' upon arrival here from slovakia in 1923. the
only substantive name changes the family made were in
israel, where one brother, starting with fe-resh-
daled-mem-nun, left out every other letter and became
pe-daled-nun 'padon', and the sons of another brother
became 'ephrath'.

you feel better now?

This is not going to help much about the origin of Milman
as a family name, but the Philadelphia phone directory has
four separate listings for people named Milman.  The phone
book for an adjacent county lists seven listings for people
named Millman (double 'L') plus one Milman and one Milmon.
 
The Philadelphia book lists 20+ names for Millman.
 
As did Nicholas, I had never heard the names.  Funny what
one can learn from keeping phone books close-to-hand.
 
While the books are still on my desk: there seem to be only
five Melman listings, at least three of them dentists
apparently in practice together.
