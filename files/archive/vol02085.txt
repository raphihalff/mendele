Subject: Answer book for College Yiddish

For Jeff Finger: My memory is a bit hazy on the subject
but, I do recall a project at YIVO, many years ago (in
which I had a hand but which David was responsible for) to
prepare a correspondence (?) course for the University of
Wisconsin (?) (Adult Education/Extension Program)--as you
see, there are many question marks. It resulted in two (?)
workbooks and perhaps, an answer book. Inquire of YIVO
(Zachary, if you're tuned in, perhaps you can clarify this;
or, if David Gold is on the line (or, perh Leonard, in
Haifa knows), please shed some light on this. Sorry to be
so
 
To the pesl/pesl respondents, thanks. The "bas", diminutive
"besl" didn' occur to me. The besl/pesl correespondence is
interesting. I can only think of one other Western Yiddish
etymological initial "b" that shows up as "p" in Eastern
Yiddish: WY baafn 'to drink' (presumably cognate with
French "boire") Eastern Yiddish pof/pufn as in "shlofn un
pofn" a pejorative for 'to sleep' (presumably in a drunken
stupor). More on this, anyone?

Subject: RE: bloyz and nor

(Jeff Finger asks:)
>
>Is there a difference in usage and meaning between "bloyz"
>and "nor"?

i once looked at the differences and there were quite a
few. unfortunately i can't find my notes at the moment. one
that i remember is that _bloyz_ cannot function as a
conjunction the way _nor_ can, e.g.

ikh vel aykh gebn tsvey rubl, nor/*bloyz lozt mir geyn
        brengen di vaser farn tatn. (rp:7)

men volt gedarft oysleshn dem lomp, nor/*bloyz ikh bin foyl
        oyftsushteyn. (rp:38)

note, btw, that english _only_ can also function as a
conjunction in this way (e.g. 'someone should turn off the
light, only i'm too lazy to get up')

Subject: Computer Yiddish

I understand that Compuserve has a bidirectional utility
which is Shareware.  Does anyone on the list have it?  Can
it be shared through Mendele?  I have Wordperfect and have
re-programmed my keyboard to input Yiddish; but I have to
input the aleph-bet backwards, which is not practical (!).
I note that in yesterdays message someone felt that
uploading and downloading the aleph-bet would not be a
problem. I wonder how that would be accomplished.

The Answer Book for Weinreich would be helpful to me, too.

Subject: Khurbm

I was surprised to come upon the term "Hitler-khurbm" as
early as 1941 in Maks Vaynraykh's paper on "Di yidishe
visnshaft in der hayntiker tsayt":
 
"Nor mir gleybn dokh in dem groysn natsyonaln un
mentshlekhn koyekh fun der yidisher shprakh far yidn afile
nokh dem Hitler-khurbm un afile in Amerike" (Yivo-bleter
17:7, based on a talk presented on 3 Jan. 1941 at the 15th
annual Yivo Conference in New York).
 
Has anyone an earlier cite for the use of khurbm =
Holocaust? Was this term in general use by 1941?
