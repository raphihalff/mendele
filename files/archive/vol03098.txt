Subject: Sluschei and a comment on Mendelnikes

It seems likely that your grandfather's poem was written in Slavic
-maybe Russian- where the term Scuschei means "listen here". But
even as I write this, I note that Chaver Berman's response saying
the word is Polish in origin was quicker off the mark - perhaps even
the following day.

Computer "kalyikes" like me cannot hope to get their comments in
fast enuff because, I conclude, most of the "posters' to Mendele
zeinen fun die richtige lingvistiker, und zei chaapen zich tzu tzu a
frage azoie vie tzu heise lokshen tzi a gut shtik herring oder a
Shabbesdige tzcholent. I have an image of Mendelnikes lying in wait
for the questions.

Nu, abi gezunt! Mir zollen alle hoben a gut yor!

I just completed Columbia/Yivo's summer Yiddish program and since I
recently gained possession of a modem, I thought it would be
interesting to take part in Mendele.  Though I'm no mayven, my
Yiddish is pretty good and most importantly, I enjoy it immensely.
Additionally, I'm hoping to continue my Yiddish education in grad
study.  At the moment I'm working at a small publishing firm.
Exciting, it's not.  Anyhow, I'll begin with a tayne:

Has William SafireUs annoying Germanicization of Yiddish ever
bothered anyone else?  Surely it must.  He did it yesterday,
spelling shtarker "starker" in his Op-ed column, and about a month
and a half ago in a Sunday Magazine piece in reference to Connie
Chung's Yiddish prowess. Unfortunately, I cannot reproduce what he
wrote since I immediately threw it in the recycling bin after
reading it.  The gist was that Ms. Chung knows a few Yiddish words
and was able to employ them correctly.  However, Safire mentioned
that the words (I don't recall exactly what they were) were from
German.  In doing this he perpetuates the commonly held notion that
Yiddish is not quite its own language, that it's simply a zhargon.
Obviously this is not true and someone with linguistic yikhes ought
to set him straight.

This is my beef.  Perhaps it's too pitslekh a complaint.  But then
again, my name is Portnoy.

A gut yor.

Subject: sluschei

The form sluschei is suspiciously close to Russian slushay "listen!"
(informal). The Polish form, I would think, is better rendered as
swuxay. Not being by any stretch of the imagination a slavicist, I
have no idea but that there may a convincing Czech form lurking
somewhere.

I am Sholom Glouberman. I work as an organisational advisor on
health care in Toronto. Mendele sparked a new interest in the
relation between english and yiddish. This is especially true for
those of us who have only begun to read yiddish in transliteration
because  of Mendele and the Internet. We found that our old game of
finding english words which sound Yiddish e.g. "Farfetched",
(slightly mad) "gazette" (seen by an illiterate) expanded to include
words which though they sound the same in english and yiddish, have
very different meanings in the two languages. An evening with
friends and relatives produced the following list.

bench     bless  The rabbi-manager benched the star quarter back.
bet       ask
fell      pelt
foil      lazy
fort      nevertheless
framed    foreign
frayed    happiness
get       divorce
gift      poison
gleed     limb
grapes    burp
grate     ready
grease    greet
guns      goose
held      hero
hemmed    shirt
hock      chop (hawk, hack,)
ken       know
languor   more lengthy
lash(out) extinguish
lead      song
light     people
mead      tired
men       one
rain      clean
shit      pour
sigh      in any case (sigh vee sigh)
tire      dear
zest      see!

Some of these may contribute to the current controversies raging in
Mendele about transliteration into Yiddish. Some of the above
english words are not pronounced exactly the same way in yiddish as
in proper English.

A good example is "tire." This word is pronounced as "Tyehr" by some
native speakers of yiddish who come to speak English. (E.g. Me.) The
illusion that English words have only one syllable when native
speakers of yiddish can clearly find several suggests that there are
"invisible vowels" (the opposite of silent consonants)...in yiddish
nothing is silent.

Others may ask is the Yiddish "HAK" pronounced "Hock", "Hawk",
"Hack" or in some other way. This comparison to english
pronunciations tends to be useless however and to issue in family
quarrels. My brother in law left home after his father presented him
with the following family disagreement. "Your mother and I disagree
about how "W" "A" "S" "H" is pronounced. She says its "vahsh" and I
say its "vosh". You're a professor, who's right?"

Some are just at the edge of a connection, but I bet that in some
areas in the backwoods of galicia "guns" is the correct
pronunciation of "goose". "Gleed" is not an englsh word but is
placed on the list because it sounds like the past tense of some
verb or other.

Others display their etymology in the yiddish word e.g. "gift",
where the english word is related to the germanic word for poison.

Some issue in confusions for native speakers. We often speak of
doing things like lashing out the fyehr. If the rabbi benches the
hockey player what is he really doing?

We have also found it significantly easier to find words of one
syllable than ones with two or three. "Languor" is particularly
pleasing to me because I found it.

So send in your examples and we can have a sibehr space yinglish
game..

Sholom
