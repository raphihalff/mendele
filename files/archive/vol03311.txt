that you + brave old world will perform in berlin for 2 months in the
summer - zi iz dos gerekht? could you give more specific info, like when
and where in berlin? a sheynem dank oykh! btw, your music is wonderful.

thessaloniki, in case there are various studies.

Noyekh --

I've only been on Mendele a short time, and I'm already making new
friends, meeting people with varied interests.

It's not to early, I don't think, to thank you. I just came back from
lunch, and I knew the latest issue of Mendele would be there.

Subject: Names

I have long been fascinated with my grandmother's ('aleha ha-shalom) name.
My grandmother was an immigrant from Eastern Galicia, from what was then
Austria(Francis Joseph was a good king).  She was born in one of the following
three towns or villages: Tarnopol, Zborow, or Aberzhantse.  The last
named is a tiny village in the vicinity of the other two towns.  Its
spelling reflects my grandmother's pronunciation.  Her father was a
rabbi, so she probably was not born in Aberzhantse, where according to my
research, there were no Jews after WWI.

My grandmother pronounced her Yiddish name as /Sushe Gitl/.  Gitl
presents no difficulties, but Sushe is less easily spelled.  The local
rabbi reccomended the Hebrew (Aramaic) Sasya -samekh samekh yud aleph.
If this is voweled with a kometz, then in her East galician Yiddish, the
name would in theory be pronounced /Susye/.  Would the sye ending be
assimilated to a -she ending?  Is Dvosye pronounced Dvosye or
Dvoshe/Dvushe?  My grandmother had a sister named /Reyzheydl/.  If I am
not mistaken, this is spelled Reyze Eydl.  Is Reyze (instead of Yidish
Royz/Reyzl) a Slavic name?  Was Reyze commonly combined with Eydl and
slurred together to /Reyzheydl/?

On last names:  In America, my grandmother's maiden name was written
Zamore.  The name seems neither Germanic or Slavic.  The closest East
European Jewish names of which I am aware are Zamir and the town of
Zamoszc (Yiddish: Zamish).  The only possibility which I could think of
was the Spanish city of Zamora.  Although in modern Castilian this would
be pronounced THAMORA, in Southern Spain and among the Sephardim, the
pronunciation is SAMORA.  On a hunch I asked my grandma's elder brother
how the name was pronounced in Europe.  He told me ZAMOYRE.  This would
seem to be a perfect Yiddishification of SAMORA.  A Spanish surname for a
Galitsiyanerke  seemed initially farfetched, but the Encyclopaedia
Judaica lists Zamora as among the most common of Sephardic surnames under
the article "names."  I would be interested in knowing of any other
Zamoras/Zamores, particularly Ashkenazic ones.  Is it possible that a
distant ancestor migrated north to Galicia from Turkey?  Or would they
have arrived via northern Germany and Holland?  What is known about
Sephardic geneaology among the Ashkenazim?  Whence did other Zamores
emigrate to America.  Were they also Galitsiyaners?

Subject: Yiddish radio shows

For the last 5 years National Public Radio producer Andy Lancet and I
have been documenting the history of Yiddish radio in America from
1925-1955. Our research has uncovered hundreds of hours of unique,
vibrant and exciting Yiddish and Jewish broadcasting from this period.
The completed documentary "The Stations That Spoke Your Language:
Jewish-American Radio 1925-1955 will air on National Public Radio in
December of 1995. If any Mendelniks are interested in this field we would
be happy to hear from you. As a Producer/host of WEVD's all-Yiddish
"Forverts sho" since 1991, I have many hours of the programs the station
has aired. Anyone who is interested in current and classic Yiddish radio
programs or have information or broadcasts to share are invited to

Subject: Introduction

Greetings.

I am a Yiddish-impaired Klezmer accordionist from Sebastopol (not far
from Santa Rosa), California.  I currently play with a band called
Sevastopol (not far from Simferopol).  Michael Alpert suggested I join
this mailing list, so here I am.

Mine is the typical story; parents only spoke Yiddish when they didn't
want me to understand.  It worked.

I've enjoyed the writings and ramblings of Michael Wex.  Wex, are you out
there?

I know what my last name means in Yiddish, but I haven't gotten around to
figuring out whether it denotes optimism or procrastination.  Perhaps
someone can help me figure it out?

Pleased to be here,

Marty Morgenbesser

Subject: A Table of Contents for Mendele

There have been many requests for Bob Rothstein's wonderful table
of contents.  Now requests are coming in about retrieving the files
themselves.  I don't know this end of the business as well as I should
and I hope that the more sophisticated among Mendele's readers will
be forbearing.  Better yet, let them give good eytses.

Beginning today, the table of contents is found in 3 files:

CONTENTS.V1
CONTENTS.V2
CONTENTS.V3

These, as well as _all_ of Mendele's back numbers are available by
"anonymous ftp".

The procedure sounds daunting but isn't.  Here is how it's
done:

1. Begin by typing "ftp ftp.mendele.trincoll.edu"
2. At the request for Name, type "anonymous"
3. At the request for Password, type your username
4. At the message "Guest login ok, access restrictions
   apply", type "cd /pub/mendele/files".
5. The message "CWD command successful" means that you can
   now retrieve any file you like.
   a. For a list of the files, type "dir".
   b. To download a file to your computer, type "get filename"
6. When finished, type "quit" or "bye".

Below is an actual log of an ftp session.  In order to make
it easier to follow, the user's input is shown in upper-case.
This is for illustrative purposes only; in actual use, stay
with lower-case.
