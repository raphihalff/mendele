I've been swamped with work for quite a while and have let
MENDELE pile up.  I've just caught up the last 4 months of
issues and discovered the above.

I didn't know I was supposed to be reviewing Bernstein!
Yitzhak recommended it to me in email some time ago, and I
got it from the NYBC.  It's pretty impressive, though I
haven't tried using it for much "real" research.  Fun
browsing, though.  The official title is "Yiddish
Proverbs", compiled and edited by Ignacy Bernstein.
Reprinted 1983 by the Congress for Jewish Culture, NYC.
It's organized alphabetically by topic, much like a
Bartlett's Quotations or similar work in English.

I recently wrote a paper on the new definition of "spouse"
(now includes common-law spouses) for Canadian tax
purposes, and needed an opening quote; unfortunately, none
of the 5 entries under Khassene or the 50 entries under
Vayb were appropriate, though many were interesting.  I
ended up using something from Shakespeare.  But it was a
good test of the book. There's a lot in there.  It's 228
pages chock-full of proverbs.

So, if you ever have occasion to want to look up Yiddish
proverbs by topic, I recommend it.  I think the NYBC
charged US$27 for it.

This, of course, is a Fundamental Vocabulary Word for those
of us who speak Yiddish to young kids on a daily basis.
We've pretty much settled on "hegdish" (that's phonetic --
etymologically it's hekdish).  Based on the derivation of
hekdish (Hebrew "set apart" for kodesh = holy purposes, but
actually meaning precisely the opposite), we may be "wrong"
in our usage, but the main thing is that we have a word
that works. We tend to use it for all of Mark's examples --
liquid, dry and chaos.

I've also heard "tel" (in the sense of "screwup", I think),
and "khurve" (in the sense of chaos or destruction), though
we don't use them ourselves.  Schaechter's Trogn/Hobn
dictionary lists hekdish, among other words; I don't
remember whether we got it from there, from Mordkhe
personally at yidish-vokh, or from somewhere else.

An interesting anecdote: we started using hegdish in the
absence of my wife's parents, who live in the same city but
aren't physically around our kids' messes that often. (They
are our "original" source of Yiddish; my parents speak no
Yiddish whatsoever, while Simone grew up with it.) A few
months ago we were visiting them, and one of the kids (who
use exclusively Yiddish with each other and with my
in-laws) made a passing comment about the baby having
gemakht a hegdish.  My mother-in-law obviously found it an
amusing choice of word -- as best I can tell, because it
suggests much more destruction or chaos than the simple
spilling of orange juice or whatever had happened. When she
repeated it to me (to recount the amusement) a few minutes
later, however, she used the word "khurve" -- i.e., that is
how she "remembered" what the child said, the two words
evidently being synonyms in her mind.  (I know the child
didn't say khurve because it's not in our family
vocabulary, and our kids have no source of Yiddish
vocabulary other than us.) So the connotation of hekdish,
to at least some native Yiddish speakers, is identical to
khurve -- ruin or destruction. (My in-laws are from Stashiv
(Staszow) in Poland.)

On to Mark's examples:

        1. Dos kind hot gemakht a hegdish.
	2. Makh nisht ka hegdish.    (I'm being phonetic here;
					it's really "keyn")
	3. Oy, vus far a hegdish!
	4. Da punim iz bridik.	(or, "mis")
		(I don't think hegdish goes with a punim, but I
		think my wife does say "...iz a hegdish".)

Subject: Sneezes

Another topic that has come and gone while I was letting
MENDELE pile up, but I'll put my contribution in anyway.
What we say is (after beign normalized into klal-yidish):

	"Tzum gezunt, tzum lebn, an alte[r] {zayde/bube}
	 zolstu vern."

However, we don't wait for the 2nd or 3rd sneeze -- the
entire expression comes after the first sneeze.
