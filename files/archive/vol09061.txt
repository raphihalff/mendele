Subject: bayke, balte, dayke

I have a book of songs called 60 folks lider, gezamelt fun M. Kipnis, pub.
in Poland around 1924?  There is a song called "Di Bayke" (beys-tsvey
yudn-kof-ayin), which I need some help with.  I could not find the meaning
of a few of the words; bayke, balte, dayke (seems to be a variant of
"davke"?)  Is bayke an article of clothing?

Here are the lyrics:

Der tate iz gefaren in balte,
Hot er mir gefoyft a bayke,
Hot er mir gefoyft a bayke.

vifil hot er batsolt far der bayke,
tsvey mit a halben toler, mame, dayke,
hot er batsolt far der bayke.

ver vet dir neyen di bayke?
Sore di modistke, mame, dayke,
zi vet mir nayen di bayke.

ven vestu onton di bayke?
Shabes nokh'n kugel, mame, dayke
vel ikh onton di bayke

vu vestu geyn mit der bayke?
in dem grinem veldel, mame, dayke
vel ikh (printed "ir") geyn mit der bayke.

mit vemen vestu geyn in der bayke?
mit a sheynem bokher, mame, dayke
vel ikh (printed "ir) geyn in der bayke.

vos vet zayn der sof fun der bayke?
er vet mir take nemen, mame, dayke,
dos vet zayn der sof fun der bayke.


A sheynem dank, khaverim,
Lorele

Subject: Yiddish/Jewish terminology

Lucas Bruyn suggests development of a compendium of terminology arising out
the Jewish cultural/religious background to Yiddish (for lack of a better
description).

A good start might be Frumspeak: A Guide to Yeshivish, avaible at Eichler's
and similar Judaica stores. It contains a glossary of many words used by
today's English-speaking yeshiva bokher.

Subject: "erev habotchvanim"

Tayere Mendelyaner,
    
Here's another "oysdruk-retenish," or mystery expression.  One of my uncles
says that his father, who came from Kremenchug in the Ukraine, used to refer
to old age as, "erev habotchvanim," an expression my uncle says was related
to "botchvan," to babble -- thus, "erev habotchvanim" meant "the evening
before the babblers" -- the time of life just before senility.  I can't find
the word "botchvan" in Vaynraykh or Harkavy.  Does anyone know it or the
expression, "erev habotchvanim?"
   
Could the latter be some kind of much-transformed variation on "oyver-botl,"
which is the Yiddish expression Vaynraykh gives for "senility"  (meaning,
apparently, something like "the crossing over to nothingness")?
    
A dank in faroys far alle ideen, un a grus far alle, 
Jon Levitow

Re: Miriam Weinstein's query (09.055) concerning Hebrew and Yiddish in
Israel, see Aryeh Pilovsky's excellent dissertation for the Hebrew
University, published as _Tsvishn yo un neyn_ (I don't recall the subtitle).

Per Robert Goldenberg's question regarding blood spots in eggs.  We always
called them blutstropn.

Subject: Blood spots

In Mendele 9.054-6 Robert Goldenberg asks about the Yiddish word for blood
spot on the yolk of an egg. On the farm we used the term blutstrof.

The Jewish Agricultural and Industrial Aid Society published Heymishe Oyfes
by Israel Katzovitch in 1921. In Chapter 11 pp 166-181 emtitled eyer
produktsion, he discusses various aspects of eggs including double-yolks and
blood spots. On page 173 section 169 entitled eyer mit a bluts tropen, reads
as follows:

Es kon trefn az di huhn zol zayn falkom (perfectly) gezunt, un in dem ey zol
zayn a bluts-tropen. Dos ken trefn ven a huhn legt zehr fiel eyer, oder ven
der huhn kumt oys oft tsu shpringen fun a hoykhen ort. Vi tsum bayshpil, ven
di rusts zaynen tsu hoykh fun der erd. Es kon ober zayn az bay der huhn hot
geplatst a kleyn blut oderel oyfn eyer-shtok. Deriber, oyb a huhn legt oft
azelkhe eyer zol men beser koylen zi.

My copy of the book came from Petaluma, California. It was once a major
poultry area. These poultrymen politically were very active and among
the most leftist in the region.

Subject: The Internationale

In reply to Ron Kuzar's questions (Mendele 09.056), here are a few answers
gleaned from examining the sheet music, published by Metro Music in New
York. The original copyright in 1912 was by Joseph P. Katz, and was assigned
in 1927 to Henry Lefkowitch. The sheet music attributes the music and
arrangement to Eugene Potter and Max Persin, respectively. The English
version is by Charles H. Kerr. The yiddish version, not precisely a
translation, is given, but no mention is made of the author. The covers are
printed in red, and the catalogue of music on the back cover is printed in
Russian. Mint copies of the sheet music are available from the National
Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Mass.

Subject: lyrics request -- 'mein schwesterl un ich'

In a recenlty published book, _lahazot et hanahar_ (Crossing the river) by
Shalom Eilati (J'lem: Karmel/Yad Vashem, 1999, ISBN 965-308-082-2), a poem
by Kadya Molodowska is mentioned -- the author remembers only the first two
lines: 'mein schwesterl un ich/mir haben beide ein par schich) . Can anyone
on Mendele help with the rest of the poem?

Many thanks,
Tamar Fox
