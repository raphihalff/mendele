Subject: pronunciation: idish vs. yidish

Could someone explain the the variant pronunciation 'idish' rather than
'yidish'? Is it due to dialect variation? spelling pronunciation from
avoidance of the double yod? (If this has already been discussed on Mendele -
please excuse.)

Subject: Kybosh

I hope I may be permitted to reopen this topic,and perhaps to close it
permanently! I agree that kybosh is not Yiddish, but as a Jew born and bred in
Ireland and familiar with Irish Gaelic the origin of Kybosh has always been
obvious to me. In Irish Gaelic and I'm sure in Scots Gaelic also Caip Bais
-pronounced kipe (to rhyme with ripe) bawsh - means cap of death. It was
applied to a black cap which a British judge put on before pronouncing a
sentence of death. Hence to put a Kybosh on, or put on the Kybosh. According
to Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins and also Robert Hendrickson's
Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins the Irish poet and
storyteller Padraic Colum was aware of the "cap of death" meaning of Kybosh,
although they both give "Cie Bais"  as the Gaelic form. I am sure Padraic
Colum knew better than to give this impossible Irish formation.

Subject: a lost chorus

My mother, Anna Lubetsky Poretz, was the reigning songbird of Brighton Beach
from the mid-thirties to 1986 when she died. She held court at the Fourth
Street Boardwalk Pavillion, at supermarket openings such as (anshuldik mir) 
The A&P, at senior citizen clubhouses and would belt out her considerable
repertoire at the drop of an invitation. One song she sang with particular
gusto had five choruses. All I recall are four, with the next to last a blur. 
She'd hear a song on Second Avenue where I was shlepped as a child because the
union assessed our family three tickets to their "benefits" and I was the
unlucky (then! lucky today!) child to fill that third seat. This particular
song might have come over from Eishyshok with my folks as it was a hotbed of
anti-Hasidic sentiment. Its great shul allied itself closely with the
philosophy of the Gaon in nearby Vilna. The song is lusty and my non-singing
father was always there at the end with a rousing TA-DA, such as the way
Lebedeff finished off many of his numbers. I'd welcome the missing stanza. 

In a shtetele nit veyt fuhn dahnent...Ay Yi Yi

Lebben lebt ehr nit fuhn shaymas...Ay Yi Yi
Nohr fuhn d'Hasidim, di bahaymes...Ay Yi Yi Yi ...Ay Yi-Yi-Yi...Yi-Yi-Yi-Yi-Yi

TA-DA!

Subject: pravn, broyges, anglicization

1) pravn
I agree with Meinhard E. Mayer that pravn comes from the Slavic.  Cognates
exist in several other Slavic languages besides Russian.  I also agree re:
bentshn, although I must have missed something because I never saw any
specific question on its origin.

2) broyges
Re: the question of Mark Shenken about broyges.  It is of Hebrew origin:
"rogez" means "angry, irate;" "berogez"  is therefore "in an angry state." 
"Breyges" is a litvish pronunciation, which goes well with his observance of
this pronunciation among South Africans, who were mostly of litvish origin.

3) anglicizing Yiddish words
Bob Poe wrote about how Yiddish words are spelled in English.  As strongly as
I feel about standardizing the transiteration of Yiddish into English for
scholarly purposes, I think trying to change established spellings of accepted
Yiddish words is like spitting into the wind; it's oysgevorfene verter. 
Unless there is a well organized movement to do so, I can't imagine the entire
English- speaking world agreeing to change spellings that have existed for
decades (or longer).  Even the mail.jewish moderated mailing list, which
attempts to use standardized transliterations, accepts the established
spelling of words that have been assimilated into English, whatever their form
- Hanukka(h), Cohen, etc. 

4) hegdesh
Bernard Gershen asked about this word.  It is of Hebrew origin, and is more
properly written as "heqdesh."  Something (usually produce) that was set aside
to be brought to the Temple as an offering was heqdesh, or made qodesh (holy),
and once so designated was forbidden from any other use.  The reason the /q/
became a /g/ has to do with assimilation to the following voiced consonant.

Subject: Shul/Temple

Elye Palevsky (07.133) refers to a story by Avrom Reisin in which the
distinction between a shul and a temple figures heavily.  The story is "Der
yid vos hot khorev gemacht dem temple."  It appears in "fun undzer yidisher
literatur: lernbukh farn limud fun yidish"  (From Our Yiddish Literature,
edited by Chava Turniansky, published by the World Council for Yiddish and
Jewish Culture, Tel Aviv, 1983). 

In the story, the assimilation-oriented congregation of a New York suburban
"temple" is greatly affronted by the loud Old-World-style davening of a
greenhorn who mistakenly believes himself to be in "shul."

Subject: Etymology of praven

The question of just which Slavic language Yiddish gets its Slavicisms from is
intricate.  In some cases, such as domb, pl.  dembes 'oak', there is no
question that this can only come from Polish, but in other cases we either
can't know, don't happen as yet to know, or have to do some careful thinking
to find out.  It is in particular all too easy to assume that the Slavic
languages from which Yiddish has borrowed are only Polish and Russian (as many
amateur Yiddishists seem to).  Especially for the oldest Slavic words in
Yiddish, it seems pretty clear that at least some of them come from Old Czech
or Old Sorbian.  And here is an interesting thing to ponder:  unless I am much
mistaken, even the best experts until recently simply did not consider
Sorbian, even though once this possibility was mentioned (by Paul Wexler I
think), it becomes clear that words we used to regard as Czech in origin can
equally well or better be analyzed as Sorbian instead. 

Now, how do we approach questions like this? I will not go into details here,
but there are really three considerations.  One, we must think not of which
Slavic peoples Yiddish speakers have had close(st) contacts with in the
18-20th centuries but rather in the Middle Ages, and once we see this, it
becomes clear that we must look to those Slavic languages spoken furthest to
the west or southwest AND that we must take into consideration the fact that
Slavic (incl. Sorbian) was spoken in much of today's eastern Germany.  Two, we
must pay attention to the precise forms of the words, so that a word like
nebekh can only be from a Slavic language (like Czech or Sorbian etc.)  where
the sound 'g' had changed to 'h' or 'kh', and so this cannot for example be
from Polish nieboga (which would have given Yiddish *nebek or *nebeg and not
nebekh).  Three, we must pay attention to the precise histories and meanings
of the words in the different Slavic languages. 

I have never studied the problem of praven specifically, but these are the
kinds of things I would consider before deciding which Slavic language it
actually comes from (or whether it is even possible to tell--because in some
cases it just is not possible to decide).

Harkavy lists it as 'mixed up' and Weinreich (p.473) fermishn 'confused'.  My
parents used it too.

Subject: John Glenn

The news that John Glenn is going back into orbit again at the age of 77
brings to mind a story that I heard when he was the first American to orbit
the earth 36 years ago.  It's about a woman who hears a news report on the
radio about Glenn having made three circumnavigations of the world in a space
capsule.  She meets her neighbor that morning and says, "Host gehert az John
Glenn iz arumgeforn der velt dray mol ?"  Not overly impressed, her neighbor
quickly replies, "Nu, az me hot gelt, fort men !"
