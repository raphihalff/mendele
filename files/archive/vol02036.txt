A groisn dank to all who correctly translated nepr as
Dnieper. I'm not sure why this didn't occur to me, but at
least I know where to go with future problems in Yiddish
translation.

Subject: Sex

Vicki Fromkin (2.33.5) asks for the Yiddish for 'sex' and
'sexual intercourse'. For 'sex', U. Weinreich (1968) gives

        dos geshlekht, der min, der seks.  (Harkavy [1925]
        gives the first two.)

For 'sexual intercourse',

        seksuele batsiungen, der tashmesh (-hamite)
        [tof/shin/mem/yud/shin (-hey/mem/yud/tes/hey)]
        (For 'coition', Harkavy gives tashmesh hamite, and
        another Hebrew word:  beys[veys?]/yud/alef/hey.)

Mordkhe Schaechter (in Pregnancy, Childbirth and Early
Childhood:  An English-Yiddish Dictionary, 1991) adds for
'sexual intercourse'

	dos shlofn mit, dos lebn mit.

For 'have intercourse [with]', he also has

        baheftn zikh mit; bashlofn; meshames zayn
        [mem/shin/mem/shin]; derkenen, kumen tsu (both
        biblical); firhobn.

                Inocuous/Vulgar Dual Terminology

To Vicki Fromkin's "most serious" shayle (Mendele 2:16)
-which is certain to elicit tshuves on a shier- regarding
"'proper'" Yiddish glosses for "sex" and "sexual
intercourse," try (that was indeed unconscious) "seks" or
"geshlekht" -the latter has always had a "shlekhtn tam"
(strictly sound-wise) for some reason, I don't exactly know
why..."- for "sex" and "seksuele batsiungen" (i.e. sexual
relations) or "tashmesh-hamite" {tof/shin/mem/yod/shin-hey
/mem/yod/tes/ hey} for "sexual intercourse."  (I'm quite
confident that many other Mendelnikes out there will have a
hipsh bisl tsugobike gedanken vegn dem...)

While we're on the topic, did/does anyone else's family use
(the word) "shtupn" in only the literal sense of "push,
shove, or poke?"  I have, on more than one occasion, -no
doubt due to the ease and innocence with which we use(d)
this term in my meshpokhe- had the misfortune to let (the
word) "shtupn" slip out when I was describing the act of
pushing/shoving.  One such incident which turned out to be
somewhat embarrassing happened while aboard the Ellis
Island ferry in the company of hundreds of khsidim!  I
really had had no (conscious) intent to be offensive.  I
was just describing the manner in which the large,
tightly-packed crowd was pushing and jostling:  "Zey nor vi
'zoy me shtupt" or something to that effect was what I
said.  When I saw how krum some people looked at me, I soon
realized my faux-pas.  I learned the more colorful use of
this term, "shtupn," later in life, it's true, but I was
certainly aware of that meaning at the time of my slip on
the ferry; it's just that I'm so accustomed tousing it to
mean "push" or "jostle," I said it faster than my
"yeytser-toyv" could reign in my tongue!

What are some ideas out there on other terms in Yiddish for
the verbs "push, shove, jostle, poke," that slide off the
tongue as naturally as "shtupn" that will offend no one?
"Shtoysn?"  Efsher.  "Shparn?"  Sounds too figurative in
this sense or better suited to verbal combat as in its
reflexive form.  "Rukn," on the other hand, seems to mild;
more like "move or slide (over)."  Perhaps "shturkhn," but
I can't recall ever hearing anyone use that one.

I've also been told that other words that I grew up and
that I had taken for granted [I mean "grew up with"] as
being "harmless," are offensive to some ears,lemoshl
"pupik."  Apparently "boykh" is the "acceptable" gloss for
"belly" or "abdomen" and "nopl" for "navel."  Kh'bin
naygerik tsu hern fun aykh.  Vos trakht ir, vos gedenkt ir,
vos zogt men oder vos hot men gezogt bay aykh in shtub, in
shtetl, vu es zol nisht zayn for "push/shove/jostle/poke,"
"belly/ navel" and in which social circumstances (with
geographical breakdowns, if possible) for these and other
words and expressions that have a safe dictionary
definition but under some circumstances are perceived as
vulgar.

I invite a frank, open, and broad- ranging discussion of
terminology with dual interpretations on the innocent/
offensive scale, and on all manner of ephemisms,
double-entendres, and dual- functioning expressions
including those which have undergone a shift from
inoffensive to quite the opposite (tokhes/gezes for
behind/buttock, e.g.).  This then is probably as good a way
to end these ramblings as any.
