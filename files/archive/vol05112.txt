Subject: Fir kashes (TeX font copyright)

I have a couple of postscript files with the text of the fir kashes.
These were prepared with a TeX system.

I would like to know who owns the copyright to the font that was
used in these files. I don't remember where I got them from
unfortunately (a few years back). They were:

   4kashes.ps
   4kashes.big.ps

A groysn dank,

Subject: Henry James and other matters

I have not been contributing lately for various reasons including an
email hiatus which was not my doing. But as a dedicated Jamesian I have
sought other connections than the master's unflattering description of
the lower east side. I also recall Ab Cahan's lauding of James' (and to a
lesser extent Howells') realism in contrast to the more popular Richard
Harding Davis. I love the thought of James, Howells and Cahan hobn hanoe
fun Yidishn teyater. A very  warm yasher koyakh to Sven Valne and other
new Mendelyaner.

I shall be in Barcelona on Roshashone, but before I wish you all l'shone
toyve I want to respond again to the question of Bashevis and his
standing among some Yiddish readers. Irving Howe,of course, expressed it
brilliantly when he noted that Yiddish readers were ambivalent about
Singer because of the porposefulness-- takhlis--of almost all Yidlit.
Whenever there was the hint of hedonism. art for art's sake,aestheticism
in Yiddish literature, history in the form of poverty, antisemitism,
pogrom, Holocaust would force literature into a more programmatic
direction. Remember Zishe Landau's witty appeal to Yiddish poets to stop
being the rhyme department of the Jewish labor movement.Then comes a
cataclysmic event like the Triangle fire. (yes, I know I am
oversimplifying) Singer was a superb prose craftsman, a racy story
teller, without the political puritanism and gentility of most mainstream
Yidlit.But anyone who has read him in the original, or better still, has
heard him read by an educated native speaker cannot help but acknowledge
his mastery of Yiddish prose. Cynthia Ozick has  graphically explored the
contradiction of a Jewish writer who "only" tells stories, but for a
Yiddish writer the absence of explicit moral purpose--takhlis-- is by
definition a contradiction. Yes, of course there are many exceptions but
they are much less famous and are less likely objects of envy and
schadenfreude than was I.B. Singer. This comment is in response to a
request made earlier this spring about ambivalence  to Yidlit's only
Nobel laureate. Adios and l'shone teyve,

Dvosye Bilik

Subject: Shnirele, Perele

I would like to thank publicly those Mendelyaners (or is it Mendelniks?)
who responded so generously and promtly to my request regarding the song:
"Shnirele, Perele".  Again, Mendele has shown itself to be an outstanding
source of information with subscribers who give of themselves.  For those
who may be interested, my request resulted in learning about a great
source of Yiddish folksongs.  It is: "anthology of yiddish folksongs" in
four volumes, out of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1987.
