Subject: Rokhl Boymvol and bibliography

A few days ago Freydl Cielak (in vol. 6,101) referred favourably to the
recent book by Rokhl Boymvol, "Antkegn dem, vos ir zogt". I too read the
interesting review in "Forverts" last summer and just like her was
frustrated that no adequate bibliographic details were appended,
otherwise I would have ordered a copy for our institutional library. Can
anyone quote place of publication, publisher and date? Price and number
of pages would also be welcome.

More importantly, I'm afraid it isn't only "Forverts" that occasionally
lets us down in this way. Even members of our own circle have been known
to be guilty of this grievous misdemeanour. Could I perhaps put in a
plea that we should all make it a practice, in referring to new
publications in our field, whenever possible to cite full bibliographic
data? There is much talk about the virtue of supporting the language and
its culture. Surely this includes getting books sold and into the hands
of readers. This is not possible unless librarians can be provided with
the relevant details.

Subject: Yiddish and the Russians

I have been reading Mendele for sometime now and I am amused by the
discussion of Yiddish as a dying, dead and doomed language. To me it is
is a vibrant language which added considerably to our modern, secular
lives. Since I retired some seven  years ago, I wanted to become
reacquainted with the language I learned as a child. My grandparents and
parents lived together in a small town in up-state New York. My parents
were the breadwinners while my grandparents, who spoke no English,
raised me.

We formed a Yiddish Club in Cincinnati where I now live, with a group of
other native born Americans who also wanted to reach back to their
roots. During that same period, Russia opened its gates permitting the
Jews to leave. Russians consisting of entire families -children, parents
and grandparents- came to Cincinnati 'en masse'. And I am proud of our
Jewish Community that took them in, found housing, clothing, medical
support without much fanfare. The older Yiddish speaking Russians soon
joined our group. Many of the older generation spoke a fluent Yiddish
but knew little of Yiddishkeit.

The club served a useful purpose. For the Americans, we became more
articulate in the language. For the Russians, Yiddish was the language
to communicate with them  and give them some realization of their new
homeland, what America and democracy was all about. We learned from them
the hardships they had to endure. The economic sacrifices leaving behind
precious possessions and the security that the Russian state promised.
Some professionals high up in the Communist ranks found themselves in
the gulag just for being Jewish. The older Russians also did not have a
bed of roses in Cincinnati. They lived in poor homes, supported by the
community and perhaps by some the children who had found employment. I
am happy to report that seven years later, these people have learned the
language, became citizens and adjusted to American life. They have
contributed significantly to the culture of our town. Our Yiddish Club
no longer exits. However, Yiddish served a useful purpose. To me,
Yiddish lived and did well.

Subject: Beregovski archive

The (relatively) short answer to Leonard Prager's question (6.111) about
the Beregovski archive is as follows.  To Izaly Zemtsovsky belongs the
credit for preserving the typescript of Beregovski's five-volume
collection _Evreiskii muzykal'nyi fol'klor_ (Jewish Musical Folklore)
and other archival materials, all of which were entrusted to him in
Leningrad by Beregovski's daughter Eda.

Only the first volume of the collection was published during
Beregovski's lifetime, in 1934.  (The second volume was set in type in
1938 but never published; Mark Slobin discovered the author's proofs at
YIVO in New York in 1981.)  In 1962, after Beregovski's death, a
one-volume selection of materials from his collection was published in
Moscow.  Mark Slobin's 1982 volume _Old Jewish Folk Music:  the
Collections and Writings of Moshe Beregovski_  reprinted the 1934 and
1962 publications and also included translations of several of
Beregovski's articles.

More recently Max Goldin of the Riga Conservatory published a version of
Beregovski's third volume, on Jewish instrumental folk music (Moscow,
1987).  For some time now Mark Slobin and I have been working to bring
out editions in English of volumes 3, 4 (nigunim) and 5 (purim-shpil).

Beregovski's five-volume work was based in part on his own extensive
fieldwork, and also on the materials from earlier collections (Kiselhof,
Engel, the St. Petersburg Society for Jewish Music and Jewish
Historic-Ethnographic Society, etc.). These invaluable collections
(which were inherited by the Jewish section of the Ukrainian Academy of
Sciences, where Beregovski worked) had long been thought lost, but were
discovered by Israel Adler to have miraculously survived in Kiev.

Subject: Who discovered the Beregovski archive and when?

It appears that I am that very "knowledgeable Mendele reader" who can
comment upon those two reports concerning the discovery of Beregovsky's
archives.

One month ago I came from Kiev where I met with Dr. Liubov A. Dubrovina,
the director of the Kievan Institute of Manuscripts of the Ukrainian
National Library named after V.I. Vernadsky, where the legendary
archives of the former Cabinet of Jewish Culture (which was headed by
Moshe Beregovsky) have been kept recently.

The two reports which were quoted by Leonard Prager refer to different
archives. I spoke of archives which became known in 1966 thanks to me,
indeed. These are the manuscripts and draft copies of Beregovsky's own
collection of Jewish folk songs and music (five huge volumes which he
prepared for publication), his own articles in Yiddish and Russian, a
few abstracts, a bibliography, and other documents, some rare books from
his private library, as well as about 60 wax cylinders with Yiddish
songs from his field work, which he kept at home. At that time and later
when I wrote about these, let us say, St. Petersburg archives, nothing
was known about another set of Ukrainian state archives which included
numerous recordings of different folklorists, all of the sound archives
from the famous An-sky expedition, Kiselgof's musical manuscripts,
Beregovsky's recordings, and so on, and so forth.

When the Kievan Institute released the information about this
magnificent collection, Prof. Israel Adler came to examine it (not to
"discover") and to start the negotiations concerning its preservation,
copying etc. He invited the best specialists from Vienna but,
unfortunately, as far as I know from the director, there is no agreement
yet, no cooperation between Kiev and Jerusalem, alas.

Liudmila Sholokhova-Goizman, a young musicologist from Kiev, is working
selflessly to prepare these materials for publication.  During  the
period 1994-96 she has already published ten articles about these
archives and prepared the compact disc which was mentioned in the latest
Hebrew information which Leonard Prager quoted. (By the way, while in
Kiev, I was invited to be a consultant for this disc, which is really
unique and priceless.)

Let us hope that these valuable archives will be preserved successfully
and fully appreciated by future generations.
