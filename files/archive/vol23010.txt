Subject: "Boris Muzikant"

I'm listening to the cut on Brave Old World's album Klezmer Musicthat features Ben 
Bayzler [Boris Muzikant]. In his role as marshalik at a wedding, he says to the guests, 
"Un yetst vet ets hern a modzhitser shtikele" [And now you will hear some Modzhits 
music].  Later he exhorts the dancers, "Haybts di fiselekh" [Pick up your feet]. And when 
he sings the song Tshipe Dvoyre, he ends with "Gets mir khanike gelt" [Give me 
Chanukah money]. 

1. I'm curious to know the geographical parameters of the forms ets, haybts, and gets.
2. He begins his routine with "Un hersht lomir ale gayn bazetsn di kale" [And first let us 
all go and seat the bride]. Is he saying "hersht" for theatrical effect, or is this also 
regional?

The full text of "Di goldene keyt" is available in any edition of Peretz's collected works. 
It doesn't seem to be online anywhere.

Subject: "Sheyn vi di levone"

I loved reading Perla Sneh's folk-processed version of "Sheyn vi di levone!

I'm curious in general about the ways in which texts with known authors become folk 
songs in Yiddish culture.  If anyone has thoughts or recommended reading, I'd love to 
hear about them.

Subject: Yung-Idish

Mendelyaner,

I'm pleased to announce that the Stanford University Libraries have digitized a complete 
set of the rare (and fragile) avant-garde Yiddish literary and artistic journal Yung-Idish. 
All three issues were published in Lodz, 1919, and the digitized versions are found at the 
following URLs:

 
http://purl.stanford.edu/xs149kg0644 
http://purl.stanford.edu/vz646sg6431 
http://purl.stanford.edu/vr126xr7917

For background on the Yung-Idish (or: Yung-yidish) group, see the entry in the YIVO 
Encyclopedia : http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Yung-yidish 

"The founding of Yung-yidish, the first Yiddish artistic avant-garde group in Poland, 
grew out of a meeting in 1918 between poet Moyshe Broderzon and a group of visual 
artists centered around Yitskhok Broyner, Yankl Adler, and Marek Szwarc. Eventually, 
the group included some 20-odd members including Yitskhak Katzenelson, Yekhezkl-
Moyshe Nayman, and Hershele, as well as younger people discovered by the group, such 
as the artist Henekh Bartshinski and the writers Elimelekh Shmulevitsh, Khayim Leyb 
Fuks, and Yisroel Shtern."

Yung-Idish was also the subject of a scholarly monograph by the Polish art historian 
Jerzy Malinowski: "Grupa 'Jung Idysz' i ?ydowskie ?rodowisko 'Nowej Sztuki' w 
Polsce: 1918-1923." Warszawa: Polska Akademia Nauk. Instytut Sztuki., 1987

In addition, I see that there is a Facebook page devoted to the group.

Stanford's set of Yung-Idish is part of the Ezra Lahad Collection, which was acquired by 
Roger Kohn for Stanford in 1998. The issues, on crumbling thin cardboard stock, were 
painstakingly conserved by the Stanford Libraries' professional conservators in 2012, 
prior to their digitization.

Subject: script of Itzik Manger's "Megile-lider"

Hello All,

A local Yiddish theatre collective is forming in Berkeley, CA. They want to stage a 
reading of the Megillah of Itzik Manger. I am trying to find a copy of the original stage 
adaptation by Shmuel Bunin (music by Dov Selzer, lyrics by Manger). Does anybody 
know details about the history of the stage adaptation? Who wrote the English narration? 
Where might one find a copy other than the German re-issue? I can't find it on World 
CAT or at the local Jewish Library, other than as an audio recording.

I have Manger's MEGILE LIDER in Yiddish. I also have an LP of the songs, "THE 
MEGILLA OF ITZIK MANGER: A Musical Comedy in Yiddish with THE 
BURSTEINS." What I'd like is the script.

A sheynem dank,
Jeanette (Neshome) Lewicki (say "Levitsky")

Subject: married beneath him/her

Tayere Mendelyane,

How would you say in Yiddish, "He/she married beneath him/her." That is to say, he/she 
is of a higher social standing than the person he married.

Mit grusn,

Cedric Ginsberg
