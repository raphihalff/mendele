Subject: Grammar Wars

How about a cease fire in the Grammar Wars? Let's declare everyone
(everybody?) correct (right?). It reminds me of the old story of the
shipwrecked Jew on a deserted isle. When relief finally came they
noted he/she built two synagogues. The second one was the one he/she
didn't go to! Let a 100 synagogues bloom this Chanukah (spelling?)
season and let's visit them all. So it goes.

Subject: "Jiddische Sprachgeschichte," by Bettina Simon

The above-mentioned book, originally issued in the DDR, 1988, has
been reissued in Frankfurt am Main, by Juedischer Verlag, 1993 (ISBN
3-633-54077-6).  It can be ordered through bookdealers specializing
in Western European publications (e.g., Schoenhof, in Cambridge,
Mass., or Mary S. Rosenberg, in New York); it costs about $25.  This
message is in response to Bob King's plaint in MENDELE 3.155.

Not quite two years ago, on a visit to Berlin (to see the "Juedische
Lebenswelten" exhibition, which included a large number of items
from YIVO's collections), I went to the Weissensee Cemetery.  While
there, I was shocked and saddened to see a stone for Bettina Simon,
who died in the autumn of 1989, just around the time the Berlin Wall
came down, at the age of about 40.

Subject: Verb-first Phrases in Talmudic Yiddish

The great verb-first debate has not yet died down, so let me raise a
question that is peripherally related to the suggestion that it was
influenced by Talmudic constructions like "omer R. Ploni".

Here, with apologies for the haphazard transliteration, are a few
typical examples from R. Shmuel Hibner's translation of Baba Metzia
(Levkovitch, Brussels, 1961):

"Modeh R. Shimon ben Eleazar": R. Shimon ben Eleazar iz moyde.
"Amar R. Nachman amar Shmuel": Rav Nachman hot nakhgezugt fun
Shmuel".
"Amar lekha Rav Yoseph": Rav Yoseph vet dir azoy entfern.

The subject-first order is the rule in the present, the past simple
and subjunctive, but occasionally - for no apparent reason - a
similar expression is translated in the past perfect:

"Ela' amar Rav Zvid": Nor, hot Rav Zvid gezugt.
"Amar leyh Rav Safra le-Rava": Hot Rav Safra gezugt tzu Rava'n.

My question is whether insertion of the subject between "hot" and
"gezugt" constitutes a violation of the subject-first rule? My own
knowledge of Yiddish is limited, but I have no doubt that Hibner can
be trusted to know the rules.

Having mentioned this translation, let me put in a plug for it. The
text is fully punctuated, including vowels (niqqud) - well before
Steinsaltz.  The translation into Yiddish and accompanying
explanation is remarkably clear.  It is heartily recommended to any
Mendelnik who would like to attempt self study of the Talmud, and
who - unlike the present writer - has a better command of Yiddish
than of Hebrew and Aramaic.

Subject: Einspruch/Aynshprukh

Thanks to Zachary Baker for the sketch of the remarkable life of
Henry Einspruch/Khaim Aynshprukh, who did such a fine translation*
of the New Testament into Yiddish.  It reads like an oysgetrakhte
mayse:  khsidisher yikhes, labor organizer, colonist in Erets,
multilingual pamphleteer, Lutheran missionary--and a Yiddish
typesetter to boot.  I'm not sure what young people mean exactly
when they say "Get a life!", but Reb Khaim certainly had one.

*At least, I suppose it's accurate--it tallies well with the English
versions I have some familiarity with (King James, New English
Bible).

Subject: N.T. in Yiddish

In Mendele 3.150 Jeremy Stern (jstern@phoenix.Princeton.edu), wrote
about a Yiddish version of the New Testament. In the Ohio State
University Libraries, I found:

     Dos evangelyum fon Markus <Berlin : Gedrukt bay Trovitsh und
          Zohn, 1928> pages 79-127.

          On verso of the title page: St. Mark in Yiddish. (Made in
          Germany)

     It seems to me that it is a part of a bigger work. No
     translator mentioned.

     Does anyone know about this translation? (I will be happy to
     send some photocopies of selected pages).
