The Yiddish Voice, Boston's all-Yiddish weekly radio show, heard each
Wednesday on WUNR, 1600 AM, Brookline, Massachusetts, is pleased to
announce the opening of its World-Wide Web site, located at

http://world.std.com/~yv/

This page features program notes for recent and upcoming shows,
information about the Yiddish Voice, links to many Yiddish-related Web
sites, favorite quotations, information about our sponsors, and
occasionally a Yiddish poem or short quotation in a graphic format for
easy viewing with a graphical Web browser.  We will at some point soon
feature audio selections as well.

We also now have email.  Our email address is

yv@world.std.com

"One Hundred Years of Jewish Short Stories". Both courses offer eight
weeks of on-line lectures and discussions, beginning October 23, 1995. If
you live in the Boston area you can also take advantage of our classroom

Subject: National Yiddish Book Center in the news

There were a couple of news stories about the National Yiddish Book
Center during the past week.  One was in The New York Times (Sept. 19th),
"Jewish Stories, Celebrity Voices," by David Margolick (better known
these days for his dispatches from Judge Lance Ito's courtroom) -- about
the radio series that is being produced by the Book Center and radio
station KCRW in Santa Monica, California.

In the mailing that I received from the Book Center, public radio
stations in the following cities are listed as broadcasting the short
story series:

New York City, Albany, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, Boston,
Baltimore, Miami, West Palm Beach, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh.

Perhaps our Canadian friends could prevail on public radio stations in
border cities -- or dare I suggest it?  the CBC even? -- to carry the
series.

The other article about the National Yiddish Book Center appeared in the
September 22nd issue of The Chronicle of Higher Education: "Rescuing
Yiddish Books:  A Student's Plan to Save a Dying Litera- ture Yields a
World-Renowned Clearinghouse," by Scott Heller. The same issue also
contains a short article on the state of Yiddish studies in American
universities.
