Subject: Help for a beginner

Can anyone out there help a beginner. I've just started learning Yiddish
and I would like to find a simple text on how to read and understand
simple words and/or sentences. Also, if some one who sends in a small
poem could also provide a translation it would be a valuable tool for
learning Yiddish.

Subject: Hotzmekh

My folks used the phrase "hotzmekh boydem" and I believe it is a
colloquial expression meaning "putting on airs." If someone seemed to be
impressed with him/herself, they would say, "kik nur un hotzmekh boydem."
Boydem is an attic, I believe, so the phrase does contain some logic.

Subject: Hotsmakh

Bernard S. Greenberg asked about the term "hotzmekh," used by his mother
(4.389) to describe someone unkempt.  It may well be an allusion to the
peddler Hotsmakh in Avrom Goldfadn's operetta _Di kishef-makherin_ (also
known as _Koldunye_ or _Di makhsheyfe_).

Subject: Baw Dayn Templ

A quick note about the "Baw dayn templ shire" song about which Eliyohu
Juni was asking.The word shire here comes from the Middle High German
"schiere" meaning "soon, right away", and is not, Germanically speaking,
any kind of yekar hamtsies. The song itself--the Yiddish version of Adir
Hu, that is--is generally attributed to the Holy Shelah, Rabbi Isaiah
Horowitz, known as the Shelah after the title of his book Shney Lukhos
(or Likhes, if you prefer) Ha-Bris, The Two Tablets of the Law, a work of
ethical kabbala which was, and still is, of great influence on hasidism.

Whether or not the attribution is correct, it's generally accepted in the
hasidic world. While I've seen the song printed a number of times (I have
a version, but the book is in genizah by my father), I've never heard it
live: I've been told, however, that it can still be heard once in a
while, if you're lucky, at gatherings of the Reb Arelekh, the followers
of Reb Arele Roth, in Jerusalem. At what type of gatherings, I don't
know--I do recall that I've never seen it referred to as a song
specifically for Pesakh in those printed versions which I've seen.

Subject: Bobover Rebe's song

The song from the Bobover Rebe quoted by Berel Leiser (4.393) is
interesting in a way that he may not realize.  Kipnis's second collection
includes a two-stanza version in which the second stanza is similar to
the one quoted by fraynd Leiser, but the first one is in Polish (cited
here in transliteration from Kipnis): Matka kazala, kazala, kazala,
ozshekhuv urvatsh; [bis] yak visoko dzshevitski, yak nizko khlopatski,
nye mogon dostach.  [bis].

			Di mame hot geheysn, geheysn, geheysn,
			di niselekh reysn; [bis]
			oy, vi hoykh zenen di boymelekh,
			oy, vi kleyn zenen di yidelekh,
			zey konen nisht dergreykhn.  [bis]

(The Yiddish text is a more or less faithful translation of the
Polish version [or vice versa].)  Beregovski refers to another
version of the song, published in 1907 by A. N. Birnbaum, with
text in Polish, Hebrew and Yiddish.  Birnbaum attributes it to
Reb Ber of Radoszyce.
