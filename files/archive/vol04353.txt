Subject: Language clues to geographic origin

Howard Gershen asks whether there are "benchmark" words whose variant
pronunciations would provide a clues to a speaker's place of origin. The
answer is, of course, an unqualified _yes_. In fact, we can get much closer
than the large areas that Howard asks about: Lithunia, Belorus, Ukraine,
etc. With the appropriate questions, we can focus in on much smaller
subregions within each of them. Some of us play that game all the time.
In fact, anyone can take Volume I of the Yiddish Atlas in hand and play
too: Devise any number of questionnaires for the purpose. When Volume III
appears, it will permit an even more refined focus-- even zeroing in on
clusters of towns.

Rick Gildemeister's opinion to the contrary seems reasonable on the
surface, but it's not supported by the facts we've been able to establish
"in the field". The normative influence of yeshives is the least of our
problems. Consider "contamination" that may result from marriages across
dialect boundaries. Think of the many who survived the war by crossing
dialect boundaries--Polish Jews in the Soviet Union, to say nothing of
Yiddish speakers who have spent decades in centers of immigration: New
York, Montreal, Mexico City, Tel Aviv, etc., in contact with speakers
from other areas. Despite it all, the boundaries on our maps, based on
data gathered from such people yield trait-areas of excellent sharpness.
Read the introductory materials to Volume I.

If anyone wants to take the initiative to construct the kind of
questionnaire that Howard Gershen has asked for, and would like my help
in refining it, I'd be glad to try.

Subject: Hebrew/Yiddish Puzzle

This doesn't answer the question, but a few years ago, we went to NYC and
met some friends to go to a restaurant, with our (and their) kids.  I had
occasion to tell one of my kids to stop touching something, and said, as
usual, "loz op!" ("leave that alone!").  But in our dialect (my in-laws
are from Staszow), that comes out "loz oo".  My friend turned to me in
surprise and asked if I was speaking Hebrew to my child. He heard it as
"lo zu" ("not this"). Same general idea, different meaning!

Subject: Mordecai Gebirtig

I want to call your attention to a recently released collection of the
songs and poems of Mordecai Gebirtig on a Koch CD (# 3-7295-2H-1). Among
the 19 works on the album is a powerful recitation of S'tut vey, which
was recently printed here on Mendele. The presenatation and performances
by Daniel Kempin are particularly moving and effective. I am sure that
every khaver of Mendele will be touched by this album. I happened to
stumble upon it while browsing in Tower Records looking for the Maramaros
album of lost Yiddish music of Transylvania. (Unfortunately the latter
album still remains lost so I am not in a position to comment upon it.)

Subject: Shmuel Rozhanski z"l

Zachary Baker posted a notice (4.332) of the death at age 93 of Shmuel
Rozhanski, a major figure in 20th-century Yiddish letters and criticism;
among other accomplishments, he was a founder of the Argentine YIVO and
editor of the "Hundert Musterverk" series.

Several advertisements expressing grief over his passing appear in the
March 3 issue of the Yiddish _Forverts_.  One, signed by Shifre Lerer,
has a touch of affectionate humor.  The text:

	a trer oyfn frishn keyver fun
	SHMUEL ROZHANSKI O"H
	avek iz a riz, a kemfer, eyner fun di letste
	argentiner idishe kultur-mohikaner.

	koved zayn ondenk!

Subject: Irving Howe

What was the point of Jascha Kessler's  gratuitous and unjust attack on
our beloved friend and intellectual giant Irving Howe?  Yiddish language
and literature, humanist politics and American literature never had a
more impressive, intellectually rigorous spokesman than Irving Howe. I
can't imagine that his attacker would have had the temerity to express
such loshnhore had Irving been alive.  We've  gone on and on defining
mentsh and here is the exemplar Irving Howe.

My wife, Golda, who knows about these things from her research on David
Bergelson and interviews with the families, wives and children that
survived Stalin's  persecution of Jewish intellectuals and artists that
ended with the killing of many [most?] of them on August 12, 1952, tells
it differently.

Feffer was dragged out of the dungeon and shaved and dressed in a suit to
meet Robeson, but he could not hide the fact that his nails had been
ripped out, although he was told to keep his hands hidden. Robeson noted
all this in his diary . . . But, Communist apoligist that he was, Robeson
betrayed his friend Feffer and announced to the world that Feffer was
fine.

So much for Robeson's solidarity with his Jewish friends.

Subject: Paul Robeson

I'm glad to hear of Paul Robeson's gesture in support of Itsik Feffer at
his 1949 Moscow concert. However, it should be said that Robeson, knowing
clearly about the savage vendetta against Yiddish culture at the time,
with the imprisonment and murder of the cream of Yiddish writers going
on, never, to my knowledge, ever publicly or openly criticized  what was
happening. Sometimes gestures are not enough.
