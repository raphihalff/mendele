Subject: Prokofiev's Yiddish music

There have been a whole host of stories about how Prokofiev got the
melodies for the Overture.  Both have been suggested in notes: (1)
Bellison got them for him; (2) Tomashevsky got them for him.  There are
at least 3 others stores and I have no idea which, if any, is true.
Bellison (who played clarinet in Moscow and them came to America where
he was 1st chair in the NY Philharmonic for years and years) was
supposed to have composed them to sound like Jewish melodies even though
(according to several sources which I now doubt based on the informed
postings) they were original compositions by him.

I had no idea that the big slow melody (played by the cello in what
sounds like a slow passage but really is fast as can be) was a real
Yiddish tune.  Live and learn.

I played the work for the last time (I no longer play) at a Yiddish folk
festival here in Palo Alto at which there must have been 300 Russian
immigrants.  And when they heard the opening measures, their smiles lit
up the room.

However, one thing is for certain.  Exactly what was Prokofiev's source
for those tunes is a story that need straightening out.  There are
simply too many contradictory versions.

Suubject: Tevye fardreyt Hilels a posek

Khayem Bochner's citation of a 1602 antecedent for the play- ful proverb
"Bemokoym she'eyn ish iz a hering (oykh a) fish" (6.161) deserves some
additional commentary.

The original quotation from Hillel (_Pirke avos_ 5:6) expresses a moral
imperative:  "In a place where there are no men, endeavor to be a man."
(In Yehoash's Yiddish translation: "Un in an ort vu es zaynen nito keyn
mentshn, mi zikh du tsu zayn a mentsh.")  The Yiddish "paraphrase"
converts this into an expression of the relativity of values, something
that has a variety of proverbial formulations in the languages of Europe
(and undoubtedly beyond).  One version is the Russian proverb that
Khayem alluded to, _Na bezryb'e i rak ryba_ 'In the absence of fish even
a crayfish counts as a fish'.

Perhaps the best-known formulation is (in various languages) "In the
country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king."  Accord- ing to the
1989 _Macmillan Dictionary of Quotations_ it is one of the 479 commonest
American proverbs (cited by Gregory Titelman in his _Random House
Dictionary of Popular Proverbs & Sayings_, [1996]).  Cf. French _Au pays
(au/dans le royaume) des aveugles, les borgnes sont roi_ and German
_Unter den Blinden ist der Ein- augige Konig_.  Titelman (and others)
cite John Skelton (c. 1460- 1529) as the earliest English source, and
Erasmus (c. 1469-1536) has Latin and Greek versions in his _Adagia..._.
The earliest German attribution is to 1541.

Some other formulations:  Russian _V temnote i gnilushka svetit_ 'In the
dark even a piece of rotten wood shines'; _Na bezliud'e i Foma
dvorianin_ 'In the absence of people even Foma [a typical peasant name]
counts as a nobleman'; Polish _Na bez ludziu i pop czlowiek_ 'In the
absence of people even an orthodox priest counts as a human being';
Ukrainian _De ne maesh spivtsia -- poslukhaesh horobtsia_ 'If you don't
have a singer, you can listen to a sparrow'.

The distinctiveness of the Yiddish proverb lies in its use of a
canonical text (the beginning of Hillel's admonition) to introduce a
typically proverbial dose of realism about the way of the world, thus
giving an extra "kick" to the proverb.

Subject: Yiddish present perfect in the U.S.

I would like to request information from anyone who can provide insight
on the following questions:

In exactly which dialects of Yiddish could the Yiddish present perfect
be heard using only the single auxiliary _hobn_ (e.g. _ikh hob gegangen,
ikh hob geven, er hot geshtorbn_ etc.)?

To what extent was this grammatical reduction (to the single auxiliary
_hobn_) found in the Yiddish speech of 1) immigrants to the U.S. who
formerly used a 2-aux system, and 2) the children of immigrants?  The
period of time in which I am interested covers roughly the period of
immigration from the 1880's through the 1920's.

The larger question I am investigating concerns whether it was ever
'grammatical' here in the U.S. to speak in the past tense using only
'hobn' as the auxiliary.  I do not mean 'grammatical' in the
prescriptivist sense, as I am aware that no grammar (book) of Yiddish
would consider this reduction acceptable.  'Grammatical' refers here to
what people actually _do_ while they are talking, what is acceptable
within speech communities.

Any information, whether anecdotal, or based on actual examples, would
be greatly appreciated!

Glenn Levine

PS: With regard to the above-mentioned period of time, if any recordings
whether written or on tape) are extant of immigrants' _children_
speaking Yiddish prior to WWII, I would be grateful for any information.

Subject: Grine verem (fe!)

Regarding Sema Chaimovitz Menora's question [6.169] concerning the
phrase, "Es kumt mir on mit die grine verem", it definitely has the
meaning of something very difficult and was explained to me some fifty
years ago asd stemming from a (probably imaginary) gastric condition,
involving not only green worms, but cramps, bellyaches and great and
painful difficulty in doing what one had sat down to do. I have always
heard it as, simply, "s'kimt mit grine verem", but it is interesting to
note that "fun ale grine verem" is even more common and is the
equivalent of "aldos shvartze yor", meaning everything unpleasant. It is
heard as "Zol ikh visn fun ale grine verem vos ikh veys in...". I
myself, finding this somewhat indelicate (and being a known khniok) say,
"Zol ikh visn fun shvartze kholoymes vos ikh veys etc."

In fact, lomir ale visn fun shvartze kholoymes vos mir vaysn fun grine
verem, v'imru: "omeyn"!
