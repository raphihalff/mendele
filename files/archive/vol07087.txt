Subject: Shlack

In the peculiar dialect in which I was raised, a "Shlack" had the single
meaning of a foolishly stubborn person, one who could not be persuaded by
reason.  Gay vais.

At last. I sat at the computer and looked on and waited patiently. Wanted
to see if anyone would catch on to the connection between Yiddish and Old
French. And here comes Rick Turkel -- a gezunt im in kepl.

I know full well that our current linguists and scholars will accept that
Yiddish words can come from Basque, or Carpathian, or Bavarian. Or Turkish.
Whatever you want, whatever pops into your head - however illogical it may
be. however irrelevant to the history of Ashkenzi Jewish communities. God
forbid, a word should come from Old French?

I heard the same as Rick Turkel -- and not from amateurs -- but from my
dear learned mitl shul and seminar teachers - people who possessed great
reputations in the Jewish intellectual world -- Yefroikin, Yankev Levin,
Opotashu, Yudl Mark, Khaim Bez, Kashdan, Lehrer, Weinreich, etc. -- a list
of great minds.

Of course science and learning must update itself -- but I have not heard
from our contemporary great ones a theory that makes sense.  One forgets
that Old French was also a language in Alsace-Lorraine, as Old German was
in Alzatz-Lotringen, i.e., this was a bi-lingual region, as it is today.
and Jews had to get around in both cultures.

I sometimes think that even in the linguistic sciences there is an issue of
"style" -- such and such a theory is in style -- and such and such a theory
is out. It pains me that the Weinreichs, seemingly seem to be out.

And about Old French, definitely out. I see all sorts of theoretical
gyrations, to keep a word from being considered a derivative of an Old
French word.  Let the guillotine fall -- I think davenen comes from Old
French.

Subject: On the trail of the Turkish shawl (Dos Porfolk)

Yes, there _is_ a connection between the Turkish shawl in Dos Porfolk and a
character in Sholem Aleichem's early novel (1889), Yosele Solovey.  A
fascinating characteristic of the Turkish shawl is her constant nature in
contrast to bizarre metamorphoses of other characters in a story which reads
like a nightmare.  For example, on p. 137 the hairy man has red hair, but a
few sentences later has yellow hair.  The English translation ignores this.
 Another feature already discussed: The protagonists are indianer at the
beginning and at the end, but their nature is ambiguous at times.  They shout
in Yiddish, "halt dir, halt dir" which is translated as halder, halder.  This
is a reasonable sound interpretation and may be meant to convey the Yiddish
equivalent of gobble gobble.  However, that's not what Sholem Aleichem wrote.
 (Incidentally, in Kapores, same volume, p. 121, one lone turkey among
chickens on strike shouts, hol-der, hol-der.)  As in any dream, logic doesn't
hold, constancy evaporates.    No wonder, the protagonists look different
from different points of view.

An exception is the Turkish shawl, a woman of vivid character.  On further
reflection, I now believe she is the fulcrum of the piece, and she gives the
piece an autobiographical basis.

In Yosele Solovey (Ale Verk Fun Sholem-Aleykhem, Nyu York: Folksfond Oysgabe,
Volume XIV, Yosele Solovey, 1918, p. 37) the Turkish shawl is brought from
Berdichev to be a stepmother to Yosele.  Yosele is basely neglected by the
Turkish shawl, and, as a consequence, Yosele's father also becomes
neglectful.

This persuasively associates to Sholem Aleichem's autobiographical novel
(Folksfond Oysgabe, Volume XXVIII, Funem Yarid, Bukh Tsvey, 1923, pp. 7-13).
 The chapter is called a mayne-loshn fun a shtifmame (abusive language from a
stepmother).  Sholem Aleichem's father, not very long after the death of
Sholem Aleichem's mother, brings home to Pereyaslav a woman from Berdichev to
be his children's stepmother.  The hurtful curses heaped on the Rabinowitz
children by this stepmother is described by Sholem Aleichem in detail.
 Clearly, the Turkish shawl in Dos Porfolk connects to the fictional Yosele's
stepmother, the Turkish shawl from Berdichev, and thence to Funem Yarid and
Sholem Aleichem's own abusive, real stepmother from Berdichev.

At first the Turkish shawl in Dos Porfolk is almost a neutral character.
 Later, she becomes insulting, and eventually lets loose a stream of curses
that match in vigor the curses flung by Sholem Aleichem's stepmother.  For
example: the Turkish shawl in Dos Porfolk screams at the unruly children (p.
140): a shlak zol oyf aykh kumen, reboyne shel oylem, a srife, a mageyfe, a
khalerye!  S'zol aykh onkhapn un s'zol aykh koyklen un koyklen un oyskoyklen
eyntsikvayz mit ale meshumodim, ziser got, un s'zol fun aykh nisht blaybn biz
peysekh keyn shrid upolit, liber, foter, hartsiker, getrayer!

Thus can be traced a connection between Sholem Aleichem's real life and Dos
Porfolk, an elusive, oneiric fantasy.  Of the many things the author was
trying to deal with, one of the elements was, in my opinion, unfinished
business from childhood.  The stresses of 1909 probably forced him to dig
deeply.  That is the one most attractively interesting element of the piece.
 Thanks to Leonard Prager for suggesting we carefully consider this work.

Subject: Duchan

Hugh Dennan asks about the origin of the word, "duchan."

The word appears in the gemara, if not earlier.  See, for example, Rosh
HaShanna 31b, "the Kohanim are not permitted to ascend to the duchan in their
sandals."

Note that it is duchan and not dukhan, chaf and not khet.

Subject: shlak/Dick

While this doesn't answer David Herskovic's question about the connection
to sukkes, it's interesting that there's a Polish expression that's just
about the exact equivalent of "der shlak zol im trefn," that is: "Niech go
szlag trafi," with the subtle difference that in the latter the szlag
seems to have a bit more of an aim, since trafic suggests hitting a
target.

On Steven Cassedy's question about Isaac Meyer Dick: David Roskies wrote
his dissertation at Brandeis on Dick; it includes an extensive 
bibliography.

Subject: Yiddish anarchist group in England?

In a French novel I've just read, "Jordan
Fantosme" (first novel of the young writer Jean-Baptiste
Evette), which takes place in London in 1991,
the main character meets some people at the headquarters
of the "Fe'de'ration des anarchistes de langue yiddish"
in Jubilee Street, and reads an anarchist journal 
"V'panotch" which is supposed to be published in Russian
and Yiddish. I was wondering if that "federation"
and that newspaper really existed in 1991.

Subject: Superstitions

My bubby, from Toste, Galitsia, before coming to New York, lived with us on
our farm in New Jersey after my mother died. She prevented lightening from
striking our house.  When it rained and stormed,-- gedunert un geblitzt--she
filled glasses half full with water, placed a fork with the prongs up in each
glass, and placed the glass carefully on the window sill. Proof that she was
right: Our house was never hit by lightning, phtu, phtu, phtu.

She also had a most effective remedy to stop bleeding from cuts, a frequent
occurrence in our household. The bleeder had to chew a piece of rye bread,
but not swallow it. The chewed up bread was used as a poltice and went
directly on the wound. The bleeding stopped and the wound healed quickly
after that. Maybe rye bread because it was the only bread we ate, except for
my bubby's home baked challah which I don't remember we ever used for this
purpose. I don't know the medical reason for the healing properties of chewed
up rye bread, but there must be one.

Use these helpful hints in any way appropriate, and thank my wonderful bubby,
Tsirl Katz.
