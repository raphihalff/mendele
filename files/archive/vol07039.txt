Subject: Yiddish in Estonia and multilingualism

Dear colleagues! I am Anna Verschik from Tallinn, Estonia. I am a linguist 
and a speaker of Yiddish, too. There are still somewhat 500-600 Yiddish 
speakers in Estonia. I am working on my doctoral dissertation dedicated to 
the multilingualism of Estonian Jews and would be very interested in learning
about other works in this field and in Yiddish linguistics in general. I teach 
courses in Judaism and Yiddish culture in the Estonian Institute of the 
Humanities and also translate fiction from Yiddish into Estonian. I would be 
very grateful for your help and advice. 

Zait gezunt - s'iz a shod, az men ken nit shraibn mit di yidishe oisiyes.

Subject: Reading Yiddish

I noted Allen Dronet's letter in Mendele about his difficulty in reading
Yiddish, and it struck a familiar, if painful note:

I am a 68 yr old retired Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon who is a self-taught
Yiddishist, but I, too, have a problem reading long passages in Yiddish.  It
seems that I still stumble over any long Yiddish word, despite my having
studied Yiddish at the graduate level at Ohio State Unioversity for four
years, and Bar Ilan University for one summer.  It was sheer terror for me
to be asked to read aloud in class.  All this, in spite of being quite
fluent in the language.

As far as flash cards:  I have had much success with my Hebrew word processor, 
DAGESH2 (by Kivun).  I ordered it from DAVKA, 7074 N. Western Avenue, Chicago, 
IL, along with a Hebrew keyboard (which also has Latin letrters on it) for 
$35. Their phone no. is: 1-800-621-8225.

If anyone out in MENDELEland can offer any workable material to help
farkrempteh Yiddish readers, a whole lot of us would be deleriously happy

Subject: Jewish prostitute/students 

Sholem Aleikhem!

As part of a dissertation on narratives of Jewish acculturation in Russian
literature (1870-1890), I've become interested in the stories of Jewish
girls who registered as prostitutes in order to have permission to live in
a big city outside of the Pale of Settlement and to study there.  As far
as I can tell, this happened very rarely if ever, but was much discussed
and was the topic of much fiction between the early 1880s and the Revolution.
I've already heard about a number of films -- Yiddish, Russian, and 
German/Polish --  with this plot, read footnotes about it in Laurie 
Bernstein's book on prostitution and Ben Nathans' dissertation on Jewish 
assimilation and some mentions in Edward Bristow's book on Jews and
prostitution and J. Hoberman's book on Yiddish film,, seen a reference in a 
Sholem Aleikhem novel (_The Bloody Hoax_), and read Baron Ginsburg's
testimony about it to an international congress on white slavery.  I would
appreciate references to any more uses of this plot in Russian or Yiddish
literature (or films, or any other literature, for that matter) or any more 
mentions in historical works.

A sheynem dank.
