Subject: netizne-gelt

Would anyone know the yiddish word "netizne-gelt". It appears in a
mayse of Der Nister, I couldnt find it anywhere, from the context,
it could mean something like "alms"

Subject: 'gay' in Yiddish

In my long message of March 2, I said I'd be content to accept Yosl
Mlotek's word that "feygele" was used in Yiddish in Poland to mean
'gay' Heybt zikh nisht on! Having just spoken to him, let me report
the following: i) He says he was never approached on the subject by
a DARE editor (as I know I was); ii) He denies any knowledge of the
word having been used in Yiddish, certainly not in Poland (though he
did know one or more gays). I consider us back at square one on the
subject, ready to go to battle for my "seductive" theory that
"feygele" in English is a Yiddishoid extension of "fag" (or, how
about "fey"?).

Subject: Lezbyanke

"Lezbyanke" cannot be a recent formation; the word was borrowed from
Russian.  Incidentally, does Yiddish allow the word "lezbyanitshke"
as Russian does?

Subject: Shprintsaleahs

I have a few more queries for the mavens at Mendele.  First, in my
family (Russ ian Jews who settled in Montreal), we used the term
"shprintsaleah" to describe spoiled Jewish girls.  Interestingly, we
did not have a comparable term for spoiled Jewish boys.  I have been
having a debate with my friend.  I believe the term is a diminutive
of the Yiddish word for princess.  My friend believes that it is a
combination of two womens' names -- Shprintse and Leah.  Who is
correct?  Second, I refer to my grandmother as Babi and my
grandfather as Zeda. Jews in Toronto usually pronounce it Bubbi and
Zedi.  My fiance, who is from South Africa, pronounces it Bobba and
Zeda.  Why is there a difference?  Is it a Russian, Polish,
Lithuanian thing or is there another reason?

Subject: Nasality in ayin-words

I'm glad at least one person, Zachary Baker, agrees in having heard
nasalization in the diphthong of mayse (=[may~se]. Of course, in a
dialect in which such words do not have a diphthong we might hear
[ma~se] although, as some of our people have said, [manse] or
[maynse] might occur too.

The other day I mentioned the pronunciation of /mayse/ by my
colleague Arnold Dashefsky, Director of the Center for Judaic
Studies and Contemporary Jewish Life at UConn. Yesterday we had one
of our Yiddish Table gatherings. It happens that he had to use the
word /mayse/ several times. One of our members asked him later about
his "strange" pronunciation with an "n." Now I was not surprised
that a man whose dominant language is English would hear the
nasality on a vocalic stretch as the consonant N, but it is also
true that Dashefsky in replying thoughtfully and carefully, gave a
deliberate citation-form pronunciation with a consonant rather than
a nasalized diphthong, [maynse]. If you will be kind enough to trust
my field phonetician's ear, I can assure you that in casual speech
he just nasalizes the diphthong.

Given this alternation between speaking styles and the existence of
the dorso-velar nasal consonant [ng] (in phonetic transcription,
impossible here, this would be a single symbol, an n with a
descender), linguists would probably want to link any nasalized
vowels or diphthongs with an "underlying" nasal consonant. An analog
in English is that in, e.g., Greater Metroplitan New York English,
words like "can't" with a final voiceless [t] are pronounced by some
with a nasalized vowel and no [n], whereas words like "canned" with
a final voiced [d] and a longer vowel are not.

Subject: Feygelekh and friends

It seems to me that there's been substantial agreement regarding
"feygele", i.e. that it's a North American word.  The question
about European terms for homosexual remains open.  For what it's
worth, here's my experience.

I'm one of those who doesn't recall ever hearing about such things
from my parents.  They came to America when they were past 40.  But
from my aunt, who had emigrated when she was a girl and who lived up
the street, and from her children (indeed recently from one of her
grandchildren) I heard "feygele". Not that I knew what it meant
until I was about 19.

Years go by.  One day I ask my father.  He gives a nervous laugh,
looks to my mother for support, and says: "Binyumin Bes Petzke".
Suddenly I realize that I _had_ heard it before--and more than
once-- but I'd heard it with the inattentiveness of a kid bored with
his parents' constant jawing about landslayt named Moyshe Khane
Rivke's and the like.  So I say, "Binyumin Bes Petzke?!  Fin vonen
aza tchidne numen?" (I spoke mother-lode Podolian in those days.)
My father answers: "Ikh veys? S'iz geven ba inz a Binyumin, azoy ot
men im gerifn". He was clearly anxious to move on to another topic
and we did.

I have a _very_ tenuous theory to account for all this, but I'd much
rather hear from the sociolinguists among us.
