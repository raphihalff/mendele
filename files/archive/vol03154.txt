Subject: Henry Einspruch, D.D.

Seymour Axelrod asks (MENDELE 3.153) about the Yiddish New Testament
translation, Henry Einspruch/Khayim Aynshprukh.  A brief bio-
bibliography appears in the "Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher
literatur" (vol. 1, cols. 77-78).

Einspruch was born in Tarnow, Galicia, the child of an iron-merchant
who is described as a learned man (lamdn) and a Sandzer Hasid.  His
mother was the daughter of the cantor of the main synagogue in
Jaroslaw.  In short, good yikhes. He received both traditional
Jewish and secular education and in his adolescence gravitated
toward the Poale Zion (Labor Zionist) move- ment, and was active
(together with Yitskhok Shiper -- who I assume is the same person
who later became a famous historian of Polish Jewry, also known as
Ignacy Schip[p]er) in organizing strikes among tailors, retail sales
clerks and "belfers" (assistants to melamdim).

He emigrated to Eretz Yisrael (Ertsisroel [!]) in 1909, lived in the
agricultural colony of Merhavia, then (1911) moved to Egypt, and in
1913 emigrated to the U.S. (Cleveland and New York City), where he
worked in a restaurant and an iron foundry.  Later, he moved to
Chicago, studied at McCormick Theological Seminary; Baltimore, where
he enrolled at Johns Hopkins; and received a doctorate (1920) from
Gettysburg College.

From 1920 onward, he lived in Baltimore. "Although E. did not
officially convert [to Christianity], he was the leader of the
'Lutheran Jewish Mission'," writes the anonymous bio-bibliographer.
He wrote for the Poale Zion journal, "Der Yidisher Arbeter" (circa
1908-09), and after 1915 wrote for missionary journals and authored
pamphlets in Hebrew, Yiddish, Polish, Russian and English.  The
first edition of his N.T. translation, as noted by Seymour Axelrod,
appeared in 1941.  "He learned how to set type himself and his
publications appear in a correct and modern Yiddish."  I do not have
ready information regarding his presumed year or date of death. (His
name does not appear in Berl Kagan's 1986 "Leksikon fun Yidish-
Shraybers.") After reading the bio, I don't know what else remains
to be said!

Subject: word order

to jason berman and hal berman:

i personally will take shleyme axelrod's sage advice and drop this
discussion right after this final note, which is not on word order but
on methodology, since my plea to look at the data was misunderstood by
both of you. to get at the facts of a language, any language, one
does NOT ask a speaker what the rules are, since that would enlighten
us only on their METAlinguistic beliefs, not on the actual 'rules' in
their heads that govern their linguistic production and comprehension.
to acquire insight into those 'rules', we alas must do the research
OURSELVES, rather than expecting our informants to do it for us, by
COLLECTING AND ANALYZING LINGUISTIC DATA, i.e. what they in fact
produce naturally or in a well-designed experimental context. to see,
e.g., how the blood system works or how the human body manages to
maintain an upright position, one does not ASK people how they do it,
right? asking people how their linguistic system works is analogous.

Subject: Grammar and rules

	On the question of Yiddish word order, we seem to have
accumulated a variety of contradictory observations and conclusions.
Let me add some thoughts about methodology.

	One of the most important discoveries linguists have made in
the last few decades (I'm thinking of the work of William Labov, who
incidentally collaborated with Uriel Weinreich and our own Mikhl
Herzog on some fundamental work in historical linguistics [not
particularly on Yiddish!]) is that speakers of a language do not
reliably know what they say.  Over and over again people working on
English and many other languages and with educated and uneducated
speakers alike find that speakers will tell you "I never say X and
no one I know says X and it would be silly to say X" and then you
tape record their conversation and they say X.  And you play them
the tape and they say "Oh, yeah, well that has a special meaning" or
"It's very rare" or "Nu, so I say it but it's not really correct"
and so on mit alerley terutsim.  I have a feeling that if the
Yiddish speakers who rejected verb-first sentences took a look at
some IN CONTEXT in stories, they would bring themselves to accept
them as natural.  (It's worth a try.)

	The fact is, native speakers' intuitions based on
introspection is only one kind of data about their language.  As the
people who do political polling know, you get different results
depending on how you ask the questions, which order you ask them in,
who the questioner is, and so on.  And if speakers are unreliable
when they tell you "I would/wouldn't say X" they are far less
reliable when they try to state generalizations about the language.
Generalizations are hypotheses; they have to be checked against
data. Introspective judgments are one kind of data; another
extremely important source is the examination of natural samples of
speech or writing -- samples that weren't composed for the purpose
of grammatical analysis, but for real communication.  These two
ALWAYS yield contradictions (this is not to say that they never
coincide), and frequently neither one is consistent within itself.
Which one tells you what is "grammatical" or "grammatically
correct"?  That is a matter of definition.  The main thing is that
it takes a lot of data, thought, work, trial-and-error, etc., to
figure out what is going on.
