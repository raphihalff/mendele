Subject: der tate mit DI mame

A propos Joachim Neugroschel's posting:

In much of the litvish dialect, female nouns denoting animates
take the
definite article _di_ and the adjectival agreement ending _-e_
throughout
the inflectional paradigm.  There, you *never* get _der_ +
_froy_ (for
instance):

        DI yungE froys shabes-kleyd
        kh'ze DI froy
        kh'reyd mit DI yungE froy

In other parts of litvish, where the above doesn't apply, there is
yet
another quirk:  as litvish has dispensed with the accusative-dative
distinction, you get
        
        kh'ken DER froy

Any wonder members of the Yiddish-using intelligentsia were
hoping to
establish a "standard language"?

Subject: Treves, Trier 

Your are right about the name of the city and that it was called
Treves when
the city was under French influence. When it became German the
name became
Trier. The name of the city is derived from the name of the
people who
settled there - a Celtic people known as Trevener. Rashi had little
to do
with this city no matter what name. He studied in Worms when
this city
together with Speyer and Mainz known as Shum were if not the
most but at
least a very important center of Jewish learning. Rashi used the
local
dialect that today's Frenchmen would not understand. Some of
this even enter
into Yiddish where often it is the only place it was still used, e.g. 
Leilakh.

Subject: theater

I thank Samuel Millman for correcting my misthought of fifty
years ago.  It
was indeed Maurice Schwartz, not Maurice Evans that graced the
stage of the
Second Avenue Theatre on the lower east side of Manhattan. My
question for
Mr. Millman: Were you the tzatzkaleh that used to kick Menashe
Skolnick in
the ankles and run off-stage? 

My greeneh Tante used to take me to the theater. I must have
seen a dozen
performances before the ripe old age of 10. What a thrill. Now
that I
understand Yiddish a little better, I wish I had the opportunity to
see
those productions again.

Subject: bodn zakh

In response to Arre Komar:

The verb bodn zakh/budn zekh is as old as the Yiddish language
(l000-l100
yrs), while the German Boden has been introduced approximately
100 years ago
in writings about Jewish colonization. It has not become part of
Spoken
Yiddish.  For soil we generally say: erd, in certain expressions
also
adome/adume.

In the last issues, some mendelyaners discuss the meaning of
"bod" (bath).
As a contribution to the general confusion, I would like to add the
following: I dont know if the word has or not some hidden sexual
meaning.
In Spanish, there is an expression "anda a baniate" (which
literally means
"gey in bod arayn" "go and take a bath"),  which has no hidden
second
meaning, and is used in the same way as the english expression
"get lost".
If someone have the old 78 rpm record "Mucho ojo", made by the
outstanding
Yiddish-Spanish singer Khevl Katz in Argentina during the fortyes,
will
clearly hear that expression with the above mentioned meaning.
Notabene:
actually the spanish word "baniate" is misspelled. Instead of an
"n" plus
an "i", the correct spelling is with an "enie", a letter similar to an
"n",
but with a dash over (like the "fey" in yiddish), which sums the
pronounciation of the both before mentioned letters. The fact is
that only
spanish based computers has that letter in the keyboard. As far
as the
maistream is: english based computers, I must adapt...or perish!

Subject: bod 

Regarding "bod" Arre Komar writes (8.102) that it's "clear"
(though he
doesn't tell us on what grounds or on what evidence) that a bod is
neither
horrific nor bad, then follows with the suggestion that "bod" is a
corrupted
form of the Germanic "boden", so that "hob im in bod" means "he
can go to
hell".

Maybe. But here's why I'm skeptical.

For one thing, the bath-house or "bod" -- if not "horrific" (and no
one but
khaver Komar himself has called it that) -- wasn't exactly on a
par with the
beys-medresh either. It was frequently what the pool-hall once
was in
America, a sort of clearing-house for thieves, fences, smugglers,
and for
illicit activities generally. (It was also where Jews -- according to
their
accusers -- allegedly carried out their ritual murders.) 

It was in short a moyshev-leytsim, a hangout for kortn-shpiler
and the like. 
zikh firn vi a bod-yung, for instance, doesn't refer to a bath
attendant's
assistant but to a good-for-nothing. Which is also why we have
"firn in bod
arayn", to be tricked or bamboozled -- as in the celebrated case
of
Mendele's _benyomin hashlishi_.  Nothing remotely connected
with the
hypostatized boden-bod connection so far.

iz eyn zakh.  tsveytns, reb Arre to the contrary, "hob im in bod"
doesn't
mean "he can go to hell". 

Take these two scenes.

        --zeyde, mayner a profesor zogt az ronald reagan iz geven
          fun di greste prezidentn.

        --hob im in bod dem profesor daynem.

        * * *

        --zeyde, netanyahu zogt az er vet nokhamol zign.

        --hob im in dr'erd dem paskudnyak.                      

The first of these stirring exchanges lets us know that the
professor in
question is a fool.  hobn in bod is the equivalent of being told to
go fly a
kite or to go peddle one's papers.  Like hobn oyf a nisht-gut ort,
it's a
term of belittlement -- often playful at that -- rather than a curse.

The second tells us that a more serious matter is at issue and that
a more
serious formula is appropriate.  (Of course, in dr'erd hobn isn't
exactly a
death sentence either -- for that there are a couple of hundred
eloquent and
blood-curdling oaths -- but that's already a separate affair.) 

So are "bod" and "boden" related?  I doubt it.  I also doubt that
my reasons
for doing so are conclusive: I've learned my lesson about being
an amateur
etymologist.

Subject: Cole Porter's attraction to Yiddish melodies

To follow up on Sema Chaimovitz Menora's citing Cole Porter's
affinity to
Yiddish music [Vol 08.102 ] here is what Alexander Chancellor
wrote in the
Nov. 28, 1998 issue of The New York Times Book Review in a
review of William
McBrien's _Cole Porter, A Biography_: 

"Porter once claimed to Richard Rodgers that his most successful
songs, with
their constant shifting from the major to minor key, were 'Jewish
tunes.'
Rodgers agreed, and wrote in his autobiography that the
melodies of 'Night
and Day,' 'Begin the Beguine' and 'Love for Sale,' among others,
were all
'Jewish.' He added, 'It is surely one of the ironies of the musical
theater
that despite the abundance of Jewish composers, the one who has
written the
most enduring _Jewish_ music should be an Episcopalian
millionaire who was
born on a farm in Peru, Ind.' " 

Another Cole Porter song with a Yiddish flavor that Richard
Rodgers might
have mentioned is "My Heart Belongs to Daddy."  What could be
more of a
Yiddish melodic phrase than Porter's "Da-da, da-da-da,
da-da-daddya?"
