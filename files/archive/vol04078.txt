Subject: Credits for Yiddish Children's Songs
Dear Friends and Colleagues,

We are in the process of producing a recording of Yiddish children's
songs. Many of the songs have never before been recorded, and in some
cases, we do not have a source identifying their authors or composers.
Because we would like to give credit where it is due and provide whatever
information we can about the origins of these attached samples of songs,
we are asking for your help in identifying the creators of any of these
attached samples of songs. We are also  interested in knowing if you
remember singing, teaching or hearing any of these songs in schools,
camps, at home or other settings, or know other versions of words or
melodies.  In addition, if you know of other sources - people, printed
sources, manuscripts, etc, that might help us with information about any
of these  songs, we would be very appreciative.  Please  E-mail, write or
call:

Paula Teitelbaum

With sincere thanks for your assistance,

Subject: The name "Shapiro"

Dovid Braun asks (Mendele 4.072):

> No one ever refuted my hypothesis that the last name Shapiro
> and its variants stem from Aramaic _shapir_ + _o_ ('beautiful'
> + 'o' = 'the "beautiful one').

Since I'm relatively new to mendele, I may be retracing old territory on
this issue.  With a surname of Spiro, I have a vested interest in the
derivation of that name.

My grandfather and father pronounced our name Shpira, but Ellis Island
converted it to Spiro (pronounced to sound like "spear-o").  I have
always taken it to be a variant of Shapiro.

I understood that the conventional derivation of the name Shapiro/Spiro
was from Speyer, a city in central (Rhineland?) Germany.  This was echoed
in a popular book on Jewish genealogy that was published some 15 or so
years ago, whose title I no longer remember ("Finding our fathers"?).  I
believe that the book also connected Rashi's family tree with the name.
Although my father and paternal grandfather were born in Galitzia, it is
plausible that there was a migration many generations earlier from
Germany.

I too have long wondered about the possibility of a connection with the
Aramaic word for beautiful.  Interestingly, our family's spelling of the
name included a yod and ended with an aleph, which matches the Aramaic
spelling.

Are there any other mendele readers named Shapiro or Spiro who remember
the original Yiddish spelling of their surnames?  It seems to me that
direct Yiddish spelling of Shapiro would include a pasakh-alef after the
shin, which might differentiate it from my family's spelling.

Subject: Yiddish Proverbs

Howard Gershen:

I think you are referring to Jim Matisoff's wonderful (and yes,
scholarly) "Blessings, Curses, Hopes and Fears:  Psycho-Ostensive
Expressions in Yiddish." He groups the expressions into maledictions,
benedictions, and others, although he gives them different labels.

Subject: Rashi glosses

Mikhl Herzog in Mendele Vol. 4.071 asks about the use of _b'la'az_ in
Rashi (1040-1105).  All the forms seem to be present, with and without
the use of rashei - tayvot, as in _b'la'a"z_.  I do not think that we
have independent evidence that Rashi spoke Yiddish or that he even heard
it.  He did study in Mainz and Worms.  It is not clear how much of his
commentaries were actually written by him but clearly the great majority
was done by him, with some additions by students and the usual changes by
those who copied manuscripts.  He is considered responsible for about
1300 _La'azim_ in the Bible and 3500 in the Talmud in French and some in
German [not Yiddish], acccording to my sources, although some of the
latter [Yiddish, too] were added in later generations.

_La'az_ originally referred to Greek, first, and then Latin, in Tannaic
literature and then became generalized to all foreign glosses,
particularly in Romance languages, written in Hebrew translation.  (The
Yiddish in *Mendele* is clearly in need of a parallel name, something
like _Yan-kie_, I imagine.)  The Biblical Hebrew word, _lo'ez_ (speak a
foreign tongue, criticize), seems more related to _lo'eg_ (mock) and
_luz_ (as in _hiliz_; sneer, twist).  _Bilshon am zar_ is indeed a folk
etymology of _b'la'az_ whose popularity has had both great penetration
and, in my opinion, conviction as well.

Mikhl asks how Rashi introduces his "Yiddish" (quotes mine) _la'azim_.

For example, Rashi seems to think that *_estock*_ (for _basad_) is Greek
and writes: _"_u'b'l' yivani" (Job 13:27).  But in I Kings 6:9, he gives
both Old French, *_zeled*_ (introduced as _b'lashonainu_, in our
language) and "Yiddish" (Middle High German, no?) *_gehimilt*_
(introduced as _u'b'ashon ashkenaz_) and then ends the same (a later
addition?) interpretation of _gavim_ (roofs, domes) with _"b'lashon
ashkenaz _*_dek tzigel*_".  Thus matters are not all that simple.

More in that line is found in Ezekial 27:24, where the Middle High German
is given as _"shkorin *ashkarin* b'la'az_" (for treasure chests).

One Middle High German word, _wendelstein_, or _shvindelshveig_, or
_shvindelshtein_ appears three times.  In I Kings 6:8, in II Kings 1:2,
as well as in Ezekial 41:7, it is introduced with _b'lashon_ _ashkenaz_.

The majority of these Middle High German or Yiddish uses are found in the
two book of Chronicles which suggests that a different hand was at work
with this group but I have no independent evidence on that point.

Michael Shimshoni in Mendele Vol. 4.072 agrees with Mikhl, and
like Mikhl is partly correct, both at my expense.
