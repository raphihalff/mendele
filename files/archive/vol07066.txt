Subject: visnogge

I am currently helping compile the Oxford Food Companion, and felt that it
should have an entry for fisnogge (fishnogge) - however, as I don't have
access to a Yiddish dictionary or encyclopaedia, I wondered if you could help
me with either information or a reference to this peculiar term consisting of
the word "foot" in two languages.

With very many thanks,
R Harris

Subject: Western Yiddish

The posting on Alsatian Yiddish is quite misleading because it confuses two
different issues.  On the one hand, it IS true that many Yiddishists such as
Birnbaum and Weinreich treated any kind of Jewish German (excpt modern German
spoken by Jews) as "Yiddish" and explicitly employed nonlinguistic argumetns
for this position.  Ont heother hand, those of us who confine ourselves to
linguistics and who believe that there havebeen kind of Judeo-German other
than Yiddish, e.g., Dovid Katz and myself, do have overwhelming linguistic
evidence that so-called "Western Yiddish", incl. Alsatian, comes from the very
same source as Eastern Yiddish.  It is thus not a matter of ideology or
definition but of fact.  The largest list of linguistic features which argue
for the unity of all of Yiddish, see my recent paper "The polygenesis of
WY--and the monogenesis of Y".  Katz's work of course has been out for over a
decade and in a nuber of places, and I must say I am puzzled that it could be
so cavalierly ignored.

Subject: A baker's donkey

Er zetst vi a beker
He (thumps) [phrases] like a baker

This expression is used, especially by rebes in khayder, to mock someone
misphrasing passages in Hebrew 

Misphrasing was probably a result of the way Hebrew used to be taught, and
still is in some circles, in that children are taught to read without any
understanding of what they are saying. They then progress to khimesh, sider
and tehilim but often with little understanding of the meaning of the words.
Another factor is the poor, if any, punctuation of holy texts.

The baker's thumping (kneading) is not merely a pun as a baker, along with a
shister and shnader (cobbler and taylor) are the archetypal ameratsim. As the
rebe would say to a kartofel kop, 'vos vet fin dir vaksn? A shister? A
shnader?'

An hilarious example of zetsen vi a beker is the bal tfile who said 
'milfoneykho mishpotayni, yaytsay ayneykho, tekhzeno mayshorim'. (From You my
vindication [should emanate], may Your eyes bulge out, see my righteous deeds.
see Psalms 17.2)

Another saying on linguistic howlers explains how to make sense of homonyms, a
not uncommon occurrence in the gemore where two languages are intertwined.
When words of similar sound but different meaning are confused the explanation
is given:

's'vendt zikh vi der khamer shtayt an: is es in keyler is es van, is es in
shtal is es an aysel'. (It depends where the 'khamer' -meaning 'wine' in
Aramaic, 'donkey' in Hebrew- resides: if it's in the cellar it's wine but if
its in the stable it's a donkey. Or simply, put the word in its context.)

Subject: Alsatian Yiddish

In answer to Prof. Joachim Mugdan's views on Alsatian Yiddish (as transmitted
by the Leesons), specifically: "If we apply the criteria linguists normally
use in deciding whether X and Y are different languages or varieties of a
single language, the features of Judeo-German are not sufficient to classify
it as a language separate from (gentile) German." However, he does not specify
these criteria, because linguists "normally" do not take it upon themselves to
decide where a dialect ends and a language begins. If "many scholars insist
that what we've called Judeo-German should be named 'Yiddish' or, specifically, 
'Western Yiddish.'  As I see it, their reasons are essentially ideological,"
that is sensible, because ideology, otherwise known as politics, is what
generally determines what is a language and what is a dialect. No linguistic
criteria can explain why Czech and Slovak (which are so similar) are separate
languages, but northern and southern Chinese dialects (so different) are the
same one. It might be pointed out that Czechs and Slovaks use different
literary languages, whereas Mandarin and Cantonese use the same one, but, of
course, that is actually also the result of ideology/politics. In the case of
Yiddish and German, the use of different alphabets points up the fact that
these two different cultural groups use two different languages, although the
different alphabets alone do not cause these two to be different languages. 

Prof. Mugdan undercuts his own argument when he writes that "as long as Jews
in Germany (and Switzerland, Alsace, the Netherlands, etc.) continued to speak
Judeo-German, there still was a certain linguistic unity between East and
West, at least in the written medium.  That unity was lost when (in connection
with the Emancipation) Jews in Germany began to use Standard German in Latin
letters for written communication and eventually gave up Judeo-German as a
spoken medium, too." If there was "linguistic unity" between eastern and
western European Jews, it must have been because they used the same language.
If it is agreed that the language in the east was Yiddish, then the language
in the west must have been Yiddish, too.

Incidentally, in his "Geshikhte fun der yidisher shprakh" (History of the
Yiddish Language), Max Weinreich has an interesting discussion of this matter,
including the famous remark that "a language is a dialect with an army and a
navy." See vol. II, pp. 3-4 and vol. IV, pp. 3-5 in the Yiddish original, pp.
349-350 in the English translation (if you will forgive a plug, the English
translation of vols. III-IV is being prepared by this writer and should appear
sometime in 1998, at which point this reference can be completed).

When the Leesons write: "Western Yiddish and Eastern Yiddish are not connected
by virtue of their origins being German in both cases, but are, in fact,
separated by this phenomenon," I am not sure I understand. It seems to me that
what distinguishes Eastern and Western Yiddish is primarily the heavy Slavic
influence in the east, in vocabulary, grammar, idioms, and phonology. What the
two branches have in common is their German component.

Subject: Internationale

Per the request of several Mendelyaner, a transliteration of the 1917
"revolutsionere rusland"/Bundist version of the Internationale follows. I have
attemped to reproduce (in transliteration, obviously) the original spelling.

"Shteht oyf, ihr ale, ver vi shklafen
in hunger leben muz, in noyt!
Der geyst - er kokht, er ruft tsu vafen,
in shlakht unz fihren iz er greyt...
Di velt fun gvaldthaten un leyden

beshafen vet der arbeyts-man.

Dos vet zayn shoyn der letster

Neyn, keyner vet unz nit befrayen:
nit got aleyn un nit keyn held--
mit unzer eygenem kle-zayen [=kof-lamed-yud  zayen-yud-langer nun]

Di groyse shturm-teg zey velen

Dos vet zayn shoyn der letster

Der arbeyts-man vet zayn memshole [=mem-mem-shin-lamed-hey]

Arop dem yokh!  genug geliten,
genug fergosen blut un shveys!
Tsublozt dem fayer, lomir shmiden

Dos vet zayn shoyn der letster

If something looks wrong or unclear, please feel free to e-mail me and I will
be happy to check it again.  The book is fascinating, with reproduced photos
and/or articles of people from Sofia Perovskaya to Medem.
