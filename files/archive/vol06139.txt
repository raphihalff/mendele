Subject: Young readers of Peretz with the dictionary

Dovid Braun wonders [6.136,4] about a dictionary in Morrie Feller's
citation of Wisse's citation of Bashevis' reference to Peretz' readers.

They may have been using one of a number of dictionaries. Several of the
options include:

Abraham Buchner, Otsar leshon ha-kodesh (Varsha: Avigdor b. Yoel, 1829)

Naphtali Shraga Feigensohn, Otsar shorshe leshon Rusya meturgam bi-sefat
Ever uvi-sefat Ashkenaz (Vilna, 1874)

Joshua Steinberg, Polnyi russko-evreisko-nemetskii slovar (Vilna: Romm,
1890, 8th ed.)

Joshua Steinberg, Slovar drevne-evreiskago i russkago iazykov (Vilna:
Romm, 1890, 9th ed.)

Iosif Dreisin, Polnyi russko-novoevreiskii slovar (Varshava: V.Til, 1894,
5th ed.)

Joshua Steinberg, Mishpat ha-urim: Otsar ha-milim le-Mikrae ha-kodesh
(Vilna: Romm, 1897, 2nd ed.)

P. Kantorovich, Fremd-verter-bikhel: enthalt ale noytige fremde verter
(Varsha: Kantorovich, 1900)

Yehuda Gur, Milon shel kis: me-Ivrit le-Rusit ve-Ashkenazit (Varsha:
Tushiya, 1900)

Erich Bischoff, Judisch-deutscher dolmetscheer, ein praktisches jargon-
worterbuch (Leipzig: Th. Grieben's Verlag, 1901)

H. Klughaupt, Leshon limudim: Sefer milim Ivrit Ashkenazit u-Polanit
ha-kolel (Brody, 1901)

Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, Milon Ivri meturgam ashkenazit ha-meduberet ben
ha-Yehudim ve-Rusit (Vilna: Y. Reznikovski, 1903)

Subject: Tautology vs. pleonasm

for the record, these aren't synonyms. a tautology is a proposition that
is necessarily true, either by virtue of the meaning of the words (e.g.
a square has four sides) or by virtue of the rules of logic (e.g. if you
gotta go, you gotta go). a pleonasm is a redundancy, esp a redundant
lexical item, one that adds no meaning that is not already in the clause
in which it occurs since its potential meaning is already conveyed by
something else in that clause. all the cases we have seen here are
pleonasms, as mikhl originally pointed out, not tautologies. more than
you ever wanted to know... :)

Subject: Kosher

regarding eliyahu juni's citing of the word "kosher" [6.137] for its
cultural baggage, I must agonizingly point out that it's one of the most
difficult concepts i've ever dealt with in any of my translations from
any of my languages.  when i recently translated sholem asch's _God of
Vengeance_ for a coming adaptation at an american theater, i had to
struggle with the adjective "kosher" as a leitmotif that needled its way
into every aspect of the text.

To clarify its multivalence and omnipresence, i inserted the yiddish
word {in squiggly parentheses} into the english translation wherever it
appears in the original yiddish and no matter how I rendered it in each
given spot: "pure, innocent, virginal" and a dozen others. this was to
be the version used for the adaptation and as a guide in the staging--
though not of course as the final script.  in the final version,
appearing this week in the current issue of Der Pakn-Trager, i naturally
omitted the original yiddish word and its squiggly bookends; however my
introduction to the play highlights the major problems of rendering the
text--especially the word "kosher" and its involvement in an intricate
network of virtue and vice, good and bad, "kosher and treyf".

actually I did use the english word "kosher" once in the translation,
when the wife says:

'The goy may be treyf but his money is kosher.'

the only thing that really gets lost in translation is: _time_.

i realize that both the play and the translation will raise a lot of
hackles--but then, since neither is kosher, i have only myself to
blame....

my next project, aside from the Thomas Mann selection i'm working on
now, is a collection of Ansky stories for an american publisher....

Subject: History of Yiddish

I am interested in the origins of Yiddish and new theories about the
same.  Can you suggest any recent material?  I am looking for Weireich's
book, but suspect there is more interesting readings around. I greatly
appreciate any pointers, titles, sources etc.  Thanks.
