Subject: Tsu 'to' tsi interrogative

Concerning the words to the song _A libe iz an umglik af der velt_, which
Keyle (Kay) Goodman posted today, note the need to distinguish

Tsu in
Tsu vemen zi falt nor arayn,
Tsu vos hot mir getoygt tsu visn,
Tsu morgns tustu avekforn,

from Tsi (_not_ tsu) in
Tsi ken mir den erger zayn?

Subject: Yiddish or German?

Leonard Prager's discussion "Is it German or Yiddish?" in Mendele 5.289 has
finally inspired me to clean up and submit this piece I've had on hand for a
while --

Two decades ago, upon playing for my East-Side bred father the late, beloved
Josef Rosenblatt's (1882-1933) immortal and vastly popular rendition of
Massenet's _Elegie_, I was dumbfounded to find him unable to comprehend what
the label of our old 78 asserted straightforwardly was a "Tenor and viola in
Yiddish".  When I one day by accident opened ears used to the _Lieder_ of
Schumann and Schubert to this classic track, all of a sudden it revealed
itself as German. The issue of "Yiddish or German" is by no means clear, and
as such is a reflection of the precarious niche and identity crisis of the
whole departed Euro-Yiddish culture.

I have acquired a score for it in a recent anthology of "Jewish Music"
(publication details such as I can ascertain given below), which gives
English, Hebrew, and "Yiddish" texts underlayed.  The aria's original text was
in French.  The Hebrew text (given in Roman characters) is credited to one "M.
M. Dolitzky".  The "Yiddish" text is not credited.  Upon close inspection, I
was struck by the idiosyncracy of the orthography of the latter, which leads
me to suspect that the Groyser Khazen, who sang secular concerts in foreign
languages to raise money to pay his tragic debts (see the wonderful biography
by his son, Samuel), was not only wholly innocent of French, but could not
deal with foreign languages (including liturgical Hebrew!) without a
not-always-equally-appropriate Yiddish accent.  I suspect that the Great
Cantor was urged to sing the song in German "which is just like Yiddish, isn't
it, Mr. Rosenberg?" as the only possible means of recording this classic
side, even more touching to me now in my awareness of the financial problems
that forced him to record secular songs.

I reproduce this text and orthography below.  Please bear with me in insofar
as that I will use u" for u umlaut o" for o umlaut, a" for a umlaut, which are
important here, especially. as differentiated from their usual "e" expansions.
Note that even the same word oscillates between different orthographies on
different lines of the text (e.g., "vek", "wek", "liebes", "libes" on two
successive lines, etc.) I find this obvious lack of care embarrassing and
painful.

(If I have made German errors, bitte, korrigierien Sie das Folgende...)

"Yiddish" as given in                   Hochdeutsch orthography --
"Great Jewish Classics Vol 3" 		  Syntactically, this is almost
Tara Pub. NY, no date (very recent)	  perfectly clean German
__________________________________      ______________________________

Oh!  fruhling du bist ferbai		O Fru"hling, du bist vorbei,
   [Rosenblatt clearly and audibly umlauts the u]
goldene teg				goldene Tage
   [note G plural is Tage, Y is Ta"g]
flu"hen fon mir vait a wek		Fliehen von mir weit weg
   [note the bogus umlaut in the "Yiddish"!]
die himlen sheinen so fer		Die Himmeln scheinen so (fern?)
sisse gesang				Su"sser Gesang!
feigelach (!) ihr ruft nit mer		Vo"geln, ihr ruft nicht mehr.
 [pron. "fay," but see "sheinen"] [this is the most charming, IMO]
herzens gelibte du mein			Herzensgeliebte du mein
Ach vie vait du bist fon mir		Ach, wie weit bist du von mir
Ach! mein herz ful mit sherz[!sic]      Ach, mein Herz, voll mit Schmerz
			[typo, Scherz, "joke", s/b "Schmerz"]
und pain 				Und Pein
ich seh dich niemals mehr[!sic, v.sup]	ich seh'(e) dich niemals mehr
vek is die zeit				Weg ist die Zeit
vershwunden mein grosses glik		Verschwunden mein grosses Glu"ck
ach wie is shmerzt [sic]		Ach, wie ist [be?]schmertzt
mein brust liebes kind,			Meine Brust, liebes Kind,
ach libes[sic] kind,			ach, liebes Kind,
fur imermehr.				Fu"r immermehr.
 [again, pronounced with an umlaut not written!]

There is also a text supplied in the frontmatter in a
Hebrew-character (by no means "standard") Yiddish orthography, of
unknown origin, which could well be a reconstruction, which I will
not transcribe here, tracking the above Romanization and word-forms
rather closely, including some rather unusual half-breeds, like
_Fru"hling_ as fe-resh-yodh-he-lamedh-yodh-nun-gimel.

Is my nefarious reconstruction of what went on in the recording studio
credible?  "That was really wonderful, Cantor Rosenfeld.  I've always admired
you people."

Bernard S. Greenberg
