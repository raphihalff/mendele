Subject: Kapelye's "Af der luft"

Since I wasn't able to get back stage, let me use this channel to
congratulatHenekh Sapoznik for his delightful production taken from
old-time Yiddish radio bits, entitled "af der luft" which played last
night here in greater Philadelphia. And of course to recommend it to any
Mendeleniks who have a chance to catch it in the future.

Andrew Cassel

P.S. Henekh, how about posting the lyrics to your version of "16 Tons"?

my understanding was that catholics use the polite form and protestants
the familiar form. this was certainly my recollection of the pattern in
france, where i spent a summer once with a protestant family but also
attended various catholic church events. perhaps the christian
mendelnik(es) could enlighten us here? a dank.

Subject: Thanks re: Ravel

Just a note of thanks to all those who helped me help my student
understand the transcription of the Ravel music she is to perform.
Several very interesting histories and versions of the transcriptions
were sent to me and I'm truly grateful!

My student asked that I send a message of her thanks, also....so, "thanks
from feygi". Now the show will go on......correctly!

zayt ir ale gezunt,

Daniella HarPaz

Subject: Yasher koyekh Zelig Bakh!

Far khoshever colege Zelig Bakh,

(un far andere Mendelenikes vos zenen oykh interesirt,) Zelig: Tsurik mit
a por vokhn hob ikh geleyent az ir zent farinteresirt in sikhologiye un
sikhoanaliz.  Efsher hot ir geleyent dos bukh fun Gershon Sapoznikow,
"Shraiber un Werk in Licht fun Psychoanaliz" (azoy hobn di aroysgebers in
Tel-Aviv es oysgeleygt).

Vayter af English: It was published in 1969 by the I.L. Peretz Publishing
House, 31 Allenby St., Tel-Aviv, Israel.  I've read only that part
dealing with Sholem Aleichem.  My impression was that it was more an
adoration of Sholem Aleichem than a probe of the unconscious of the
author and/or his characters.  As a student of Yiddish culture I am
interested in whatever psychoanalytic thinking may reveal about the
hidden depths of literary creators and their creations (especially Sholem
Aleichem).  Sapoznikow also wrote about Itsik Manger, Agnon, Isaac
Bashevis Singer and Jacob Dineson.

Another interesting study is: Psychological Types in Sholom Aleichem's
Literary Creation, by Isaac Kanter, in J. Psychol. and Judaism 4:
205-213, 1980.  I disagree with some of Kanter's assumptions.  For
example, Kanter claims support for assuming that Tevye was obese, and
that casting a somewhat obese man like Zero Mostel as Tevye was
appropriate.  Some evidence does not support that speculation.  In the
generally available version of Tevye (revision of 1903), there is no
description of Tevye.  However, in the 1895 original (not generally
available) there _is_ a brief description. Tevye did not look much like
Zero Mostel.  Further, because Tevye could not always feed his family, I
would guess that he had no excess food with which to load on excess fat
on his own belly.
