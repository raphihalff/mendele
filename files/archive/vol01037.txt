Subject: Query in Mendele 1.28

I have been unable to respond directly to Harry Katz,
who introduced himself in  Mendele 1.28 and requested
information about _goldene pahves_, a book by Zusman 
Segalovich. I had sent him the following negative
information on June 19th,  which the postmaster has
been unable to deliver. I am therefore broadcasting it 
via the newsletter in order to reach Harry Katz.

Subj:     Re: Segalovich, as Segalowicz and Segalowitch

     Our library has five books (probably all from
NYBC) by Zusman  Segalovich, none of which are _goldene
pahves_, the book you are seeking. There  are three
books of poems, and two that were written in Argentina
at the end of  his career. One is _letster lodzsher
roman_, (1951) and one is _tlomatske draytsn fun
farbrentn nekhtn_ (1946).
     Library listings are variously transliterated, so
that there are two  different names for Segalovich in
the Marriott Library (University of Utah), neither
spelled in the way you requested: Segalowicz and
Segalowitch are the  entries, otherwise with the same
first name Zusman, and the same dates for his  life.
   dir/new
     Good luck in your search. I hope this has helped.

Subject: Various

Moyshe KAPOYER (= topsy-turvy) NOT kapoyre and DEFI-
NITELY NOT kapores. darfn af kapores is 'to have no use
for'; toygn af kapores 'to be useless'; slogn kapores
is what you do with a chicken for Yom Kippur.  
toes: Litvish (probably S. Belorussia) toves, like
novnt 'near', ever 'ear',etc in the Ukraine: tuves,
nuvnt (also nivnt in Volin), zover 'sour', etc. Not
taves in Lite (or anywhere, I'd wager) but yes zaver in
S. Belorussia. Noyekh, Podolia and Bessarabia do have
interesting features in common, despite the river; I'm
glad to learn that the kats/koter distiction is
criterial. As for Lomze, it too is a n interesting
"Yiddish" town including the local rendition of the
name itselfwhich sounds more like "Womzi". Back to
work!

Subject: RE: Vol 1.36 Intro; usage; various

It would be hard for me to think of anything but
ketzele, such animals not bein g liked in the house-
hold. I like cats myself, but wont have them: they kill
birds and they walk on the table where the food is.
Dogs are fine with me, though. But, Izhvonits is on the
east bank of the Dniester, it seems to me, and that is 
where the atlas showed it when last I looked. Up in
that nasty corner, so well  described by Gregor von
Rezzori in his masterful work, MEMOIRS OF AN ANTI-SEMI
TE. Either that or my father didnt know east from west
bank, or I kept an archaic memory of it looking west as
he described his dives from shore to me years and years
ago. He would never say anything but Bessarabia, though
they were all Russian speakers. While he recited
Lermontov aloud, much to my mother's dislike  of it,
since she was born in Paris, in the Marais, and had
completely suppressed the memory of her first 9 years,
as fraught with loathing and fright. History. I miss
him now, untimely off two years ago at 89, when he was
good for 100, a story I shant go into in this place.
