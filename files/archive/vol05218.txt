Subject: Tracking article

In response to Louis Fridhandler's query in 5.214 re Yiddish and secularism, I
do not know if this is the article he is seeking,  but there is an essay
entitled Nationalism,  Secularism and Religion in the Jewish Labor Movement by
C.  Belazel Sherman in the anthology Voices from the Yiddish  (Schocken, 1975)
ed.  by Howe and Greenberg.

This essay contains  "...the era of the  Yom Kippur Ball and the atheistic
Haggadah..."

I hope that this helps.

Subject: Seeking yiddish poem

Does anyone know the author and can  furnish the words for a poem in yiddish
that expresses the idea of the poet pleading with god to the effect that you
have already made us like the dust of the earth, when will you make us, as
promised, like the stars in the sky?

Subject: Haredi Yiddish

A recent inquiry asked about use of Yiddish among haredim.

Based on my experience in the litvishe yeshive oylem (sorry if the questioner
"doesn't approve"), casual conversational Yiddish is mostly limited to certain
rabbinical families.  It is used in some yeshives to teach advanced shiurim,
but most agree that this is a vestige; indeed, virtually none of the students
in the shiur understand it, and need to attend a "khazores hashiur" by one of
the more heimish advanced students which is really just a translation.  Even
this "shiur yiddish" is of rather poor quality, and most of its speakers are
native Americans who probably seldom spoke it at home.

There is a certain cachet to speaking Yiddish, especially when giving over a
dvar toyreh or a vort in a rabbinical environment, among the young and
especially "farfrumt" in the yeshives, but by and large the Yiddish they speak
is poor and unnatural.  In yeshives such as Chaim Berlin in Brooklyn and even
in Lakewood, there is no casual Yiddish conversation among American students.
It is used to express certain concepts in lomdus, but in this way it is more
like a lingo than a language.  It is still the language of formal rabbinic
discourse, and at events such as the conventions of the Agudath Israel and
Torah Umesorah, most addresses are given in Yiddish, with simultaneous
transalation by radio headphone for the majority of listeners (except on
Shabbos).  But no one thinks these rabbonim speak Yiddish among themselves in
private.

Unquestionably conversational Yiddish among khasidim is much more widespread
than among misnagdim.  I hear it in Boro Park and among the Satmar khasidim of
Williamsburg, and would say that even younger Hungarian and Polish  khasidim
speak Yiddish before English.  (Very few young Lubavitchers (Russian khasidim)
do, at least outside of Crown Heights.)   In Monsey there is little doubt that
Yiddish is the everyday language for Vizhnitsers and others.  Hebrew is
virtually never used in the U.S. for conversation among non-Israelis, of
course.

There is always a lively debate in our community as to whether Rav Shach, head
of the litvaks in Israel, speaks Yiddish or Hebrew at home.  He has lived in
Israel since after the war, and of course is quite fluent in Hebrew.
Considering that few of his students speak Yiddish as a first language, it is
unlikely that few other than his closest and oldest relatives speak Yiddish,
and the same is true for most of his generation.  When Rav Shach speaks
publicly, he does so in Hebrew.   Haredim in Israel have no problem speaking
Hebrew for mundane purposes; as a political battle, that one has been lost,
especially (but not only) among misnagdim.

But few would doubt that the Gerrer Rebbe and denizens of Mea Shearim and
other such neighborhoods rely on Yiddish.  Even in the U.S., the late
Lubavitcher Rebbe used to farbreng in Yiddish, and it would be unthinkable for
a khasidishe rebbe to address his khasidim in English.  I have communicated
with yerushalmi yidn (not hasidim but hasidic-style litvishe misnagdim) in
Yiddish, and among these "deepest" haredim, I do not doubt that Yiddish is the
every-day loshn of discourse among themselves.

Subject: Pluperfect

Incidentally, anyone who wants to see a "real, live" usage of _gevezt_ as the
invariant auxiliary in the pluperfect can find it in Olsvanger's _Royte
Pomerantsn_ (he spells it:  "gevest").  The first gloss of _gevezt_ indicated
in U. Weinreich's Eng.-Yid. Yid.-Eng. dictionary is, I think, U.W.'s
"appropriation" of the obsolescent auxiliary to fill (what he thought to be a)
lexical gap (i.e. to correspond to the English _formerly, sometime_ as in the
example he gives:  der gevezt barimter aktyor 'the formerly famous actor').
And I think Max Weinreich uses it in this way (adopting his son's suggestion)
in his _Geshikhte fun der yidisher shprakh_. I don't recall how I know this
(if indeed it is accurate); I think I read it somewhere.  Crucial point being:
if you are ever interested in the form _gevezt_, assume that the gloss
'formerly, sometime' is a neologism, that is, a "recyclism" -- an old word
being given a new function.

To Ellen Prince:  I don't get your comment about Olsvanger's litvishkayt.  It
has been said that in "litvish" Yiddish, the hobn vs. zayn auxiliary class
distinction has been levelled -- with _hobn_ the winner.  First of all, this
is a gross overgeneralization (veho-raye:  the auxiliary _zayn_ is to be found
in the appropriate places in _Royte Pomerantsn_, by and large). If the
auxiliary _zayn_ had disappeared from litvish Yiddish, we'd expect there
*only* to be _hobn gehat ge..._ Your comment was: "olsvanger, being a litvak,
does not use 'gehat' with 'zayn' verbs[...]" If being a litvak is significant
to auxiliary selection, and given that _some_ levelling in _some_ areas of
Lite and Vaysrusland has taken place, wouldn't we dafke expect instances of
_gehat_ with _zayn_-verbs?

If time permits, and if anyone is interested and reminds me, I'll mention some
things about invariant auxiliaries in the conditional, as well as some more
detailed info about auxiliary selection in litvish Yiddish.
