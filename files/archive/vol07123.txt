Subject: Dictionaries and Morality

Tayere Mendelistn,

Have patience!  The great _davenen_ and etymology controversies should not be
cause for discomfort.  One of us even wrote that this is not what Mendele is
all about.  I beg to differ.  Mendele is our forum.  It can certainly
accommodate all our concerns, for the Internet is a very large place indeed. 
For those who want to see more Yiddish literature:  Please, write!  And my
suggestion to those who have tired of the _davenen_ debates is that they
simply not read them.  It's OK not to read something.  You can even get a
pro-rated refund on your subscription! 

I myself have immensely enjoyed the raging polemics (and imagine how much more
so had I actually read them).  I continually remind myself, however, that I
can't read everything, that I have to treat my subscription as a means of
insuring that I will always see what's being discussed.  Then I can pick and
choose, as time and interest permit. 

As for the issues of folk etymologies, amateur linguistics, dictionaries, and
Morality, they have all but merged with the particulars of the _davenen_
debate and seem to me they should be treated of a piece.  While I agree with
the position that informed, methodologically disciplined inquiry is essential
if we are to develop anything approaching reliable explanations for some of
these mysteries, I don't share the view that uninformed, methodologically
undisciplined observation has no place on Mendele.  What ought to be clear is
that uninformed, methodologically undisciplined observation is traditional! 
It is a part of Yiddish culture, no less than the parallel tradition of great
learning.  As such, it is the mere fact of this stuff's existence, this
half-baked oral pseudo-learning, and of the passionate concern for it, that is
so interesting.  To exclude it because it cannot be supported by linguistic
science or because it is not in a dictionary distorts the reality of the
culture. 

Mendele is not, and cannot, be authoritative.  It is an ongoing discussion. 
It really doesn't matter if someone raises a question they could have looked
up, or if someone asserts as true something that is not -- which does not mean
it is not important for others to challenge the wrong information.  It just
means it is not a moral transgression.  The reason scholars footnote sources
is to render their assertions open to verification.  So it goes with all
inquiry.  It is all always open. 

As for my claim that uninformed inquiry is part of our Yiddish culture, if
some of the charming claims and concerns we read on Mendele are not evidence
enough, I would submit the case of Tevye, one of whose principal character
traits is to engage in monologic flights of hopelessly bungled erudition. 
Much of what is so wonderful about his character and literary persona lies in
these mangled quotes from rabbinic literature, of course, and in the inspired
malapropisms themselves.  But there must be a deeper parody in his epic
development as well, one that satirizes the culture at large.  Tevye could not
have been so successful had he not been also engaging an element present in
the Yiddish world(s) of his time.  Though certainly fictional, it would not
have been so funny -- and so endearing -- had the reader not found something
recognizable about Tevye's modus operandi, something that rang familiar. 

We have all known arrogant blowhards, and at the same time we have all known
well-meaning but misinformed, even naively innocent, do-gooders, well-wishers,
and sundry other kibitsers.  The range is wide, and our tolerances vary.  What
they all share, however, all these opinionated fabulists and fabricators, is a
passion to have the opinions, which, admittedly, may range from useless to
offensive.  But can you imagine a world of Yiddish literature without them? 
Can you conceive of a Yiddish life where such opinions are not offered, not
just impetuously, but as though a matter of life and death?  Can you imagine,
in other words, the opinions not being about the language itself?

Subject: German words

If L. Fridlander is so unhappy with Nomberg's Germanicized style, which he
considers "stiff," then he should be happy that I translated it into a
non-Germanicized English.  Is he implying that my translation of the story
reads better than the original?  Thank you for the compliment.  I'm always
gratified to hear from my fans. 
	
In regard to his complaint about sliding off into a discussion of German words
on Mendele:  he's quite right.  However, he was the one who slid into German
when he brought up "vidrik" after failing to find the correct meaning in an
inadequate German dictionary.  He also seems to have missed a few points,
which I don't want to go into again.  He should, however, check a German
etymological dictionary to see that the German adjective "widrig," as I've
already explained, has nothing to do with the German noun "Widder" (ram).  But
I've already gone into that in a previous posting.  If L. Fridhandler wishes
to abandon the discussion of German borrowings in Nomberg, why does he keep
bringing them up? 
	
I also find any sweeping rejection of Germanisms in Yiddish literature rather
useless.  They have specific functions, as I've already explained in a
previous posting--and one of those functions is to help create a Yiddish
modernism.  But let that be for now.

Subject: daytshmerish

The recent postings concerning the style of Nomberg's "tsvishn berg" have made
me want to write something concerning "daytshmerish." 
	
1)  It seems to me that daytshmerish is sometimes used to refer to a style
considered inauthentic in Yiddish. 

2)  Now if you're me, and you use a Germanic turn of phrase because your
Yiddish has given out in mid-sentence, and all you can think of is the German
word or idiom, then what you're producing is in fact both daytshmerish and
inauthentic. 

3)  But when I read earlier Yiddish literature - _not_ Sholem Aleikhem, but
say, works as diverse as Yente Serdatski's "Vide" (printed in _Bridges_ some
years back), Ruvn Ayzland's memoir of Anna Margolin in _Fund Undzer Friling_,
Margolin's own poems - I encounter a lot of traits that one might call
daytshmerish.  Clearly in these cases the writing is not inauthentic. 
	
4)  So where, exactly, does the sense come from that daytshmerish is in se
inauthentic?  (I've wondered whether it's come to seem more inauthentic - or
something worse than that - because of an association linking daytshmerish,
daytsh, and Nazi Germany.) 
	
I'd be grateful to hear some discussion of this - a sheynem dank,

Subject: kaybosh

Excuse me for exploiting Mendele on a marginally-if-at-all-but-probably-non-
Yiddish word, but as a Canadian, I bristled when I read Dan Gilman's
designation of "kay-bosh" rather than "k'bosh" as a "strange English-language
mutilation of the printed word."  Here in Canada, as in England, we pronounce
it kay-bosh. And thus it is pronounced in the World War 1 song: "Belgium Put
the Kaibosh on the Kaiser," which can be heard on the original cast recording
from the musical "Oh! What a Lovely War."

You Americans always mess up with spelling and pronounciation!

Genug shoyn mit kaybosh. S'iz nisht keyn yidishn vort. Davenen, for all its
trials and tribulations, is, whatever its origin.

Subject: English-Yiddish Encyclopedic Dictionary by Paul Abelson 

What is the group's opinion of the English-Yiddish Encyclopedic Dictionary by
Paul Abelson (New York, 1924 ~1750 pages)  I keep hearing about Harkavy's,
Stutshkov's, and Weinreich's dictionaries and not about this monumental work;
why? Yes, it goes only one way, but with some effort you can find the meaning!

Subject: "b'lo kharote u'blo d'ro'o"?

Nusen Fishman asks (07.121) about the expression  "b'lo kharote u'blo d'ro'o".
Not being a linguist put me at a disadvatage in this mekhubedike group, but
I'll try.

Since the context is: " Before beginning the game, one says to his brother,
benni:  "eyn zakh vil ikh dir beten, benni, - b'lo kharote u'blo d'ro'o, - dos
heyst: a gang zol zayn a gang."; it suggests that he tells his brother "do not
play with tricks". 

"Kharote" from Hebrew 'kharatah', in this contest means 'with no going back',
so the second "d'ro'o" is likely to be from Aramaic "dera'ah" (Jastrow p.324)
'arm-hand' equivalent to Hebrew 'zeroah' and in this context probably means
"without armtwisting", or  'without improper handling'. However, I never so it
or heard it used that way in Yiddish - this is a mere speculation on my part.

Subject: "b'lo kharote u'blo d'ro'o"

Nusen Fishman asked about the meaning of "b'lo kharote u'blo d'ro'o" in Sholem
Aleikhem's "Khanuke gelt" [07.121]. This phrase is likely a laconic formula
for two of the major rules of chess (that also apply to the checkers). It may
have originated from Rashi, the first European who mentioned chess in his
writings, or from Ibn Ezra, whose song "Haruzim al sehok shah-mat" contains
the first comprehensive treatise of the rules of the game in Europe.

The rules changed very insignificantly since Ibn Ezra's times, and translated
by the modern-day lawyers, "b'lo kharote u'blo d'ro'o" becomes:
"4.3. Except as provided in Article 4.2, if the player having the move
deliberately touches on the chessboard: (a) one or more pieces of the same
colour, he must move or capture the first piece touched that can be moved or
captured...
 4.7. When, as a legal move or part of a legal move, a piece has been released
on a square, it cannot then be moved to another square." 
(FIDE Laws of Chess, 1996) 
The difference in size between the original and translation is understandable,
taking into account that Ibn Ezra was not paid by hour. More popularly, the
rules are known as "touch move" and "don't take move back".

For more details see: "Shokh shpil: do vert gelernt vi azoy me zol kenin
shpilen in den barimter shpil - shokh", Zhitomir: A. Sh. Shadov, 1869, however
it might be out of print.

Subject: Yehezkel Dobrushin

Dobrushin (1883-1953) was born in Chernigov, the son of a lumber merchant. 
After studying at the Sorbonne in the early 1900s, he returned to Russia and ,
in 1916, helped found the Kiev Kultur-Lige along with Peretz Markish and
others.  The Kultur-Lige was one of the first avant-garde Jewish literary and
artistic circles in Russia which eventually spawned music, literature, art and
theater sections.  It was disbanded in 1924.  In 1920 Dobrushin moved to
Moscow where he became secretary of the Yiddish Writers Union.  Throughout the
1920s and 1930s, Dobrushin became known as one of the most prolific Yiddish
literary critics and dramatists of the era.  He was a regular contributor to
the Communist newspaper, Der Emes.  Dobrushin was also very involved with the
Soviet Yiddish State Theater, and served as one of its literary directors and
a teacher at the Yiddish theater school.  His numerous published works on
Soviet Yiddish theater include biographies of Mikhoels, Benjamin Zuskin and a
work on Children's Theater.  Dobrushin was also the most prolific Yiddish
playwright of the era, although only two of his plays, The Court is in Session
(Der Gerikht Geyt) and The Specialist (which he wrote with Isaac Nusinov) were
ever actually performed (at the Moscow State Yiddish Theater in 1929 and 1932
respectively).  His other plays included Fire God and On the 82nd Strip of
Land.  Dobrushin's most productive work as a dramatist was in his adaptations
of others' plays.  He adapted Goldfadn's Sorceress and Tenth Commandment; A.
Vayter's Before Sunrise; Mendele Moykher Sforim's Travels of Benjamin III; and
Sholem Aleichem's Luftmentshen and Tevye the Dairyman, among others.  In the
late 1930s, Dobrushin collaborated with A. Yuditskii to compile a collection
of Yiddish folk songs, which included both traditional songs and contemporary
Soviet songs.  During World War II, Dobrushin was a member of the Jewish
Anti-fascist Committee and a regular contributor to its newspaper, Aynikayt. 
He was arrested in 1949 and perished in the gulag, presumably in 1953.

Dear Mendele,

If they call the "@" symbol a "shtrudel" in Hebrew, what is the proper term in
Yiddish? Enquiring minds need to know!
