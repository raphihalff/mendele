Subject: Read the English Forward!

Mendele members:

I hope that, by now, the voices of we Yiddish enthusiasts have reached
the management of the Forward Association informing them of our support
of Yiddish WEVD radio programs.  I am writing because I feel a bit
confused by Ellen Prince's post about the possible decision by the
Forward Association to cut Yiddish language programming from WEVD.
Ellen seems to think that if more people read the English Forward it
doesn't matter if there is Yiddish on the air in New York or not.

1. "New York City and its burbs" contains (I believe) the largest
Yiddish-speaking population.  Not only does NYC have the largest
Yiddish-speaking population, it is a major demographic area, period.  I
believe that _any_ Yiddish language service that serves such an area of
prestige is worthy of support by all of us who consider ourselves
Yiddishists, Yiddish-lovers or Yiddish enthusiasts.  The least we can do
is to voice our opinion before it is all over.  No matter what the
quality of the broadcasts are, WEVD's Yiddish language programs are the
_only_  ones that exist in New York.

2. How can we image that eliminating the few existing hours of Yiddish
programming on WEVD can save the English Forward?  The connection simply
does not exist - the two issues are separate.

Subject: English/Yiddish Forward

I saw an article (?) quite some time ago which gave me the impression
that the management of the English *Forward* was almost hostile to their
older colleagues across the hall putting out the Yiddish *Forverts*,
whose circulation has been declining steadily.  (When I visited the
*Forward* Web Page, my impression was somewhat confirmed.  There is no
information there even on how to subscribe to the Yiddish language
paper.)  I think it might do more good to subscribe to the Yiddish
paper, if the object is to show that there is support for
Yiddish-language programming on WEVD or anywhere.

Subject: Yiddish on WEVD

Upon reading Roland Millman's message on Ashkenaz and later on Mendele
(6.068) I sent a message to the Forward's newsdesk and received a reply
from Patricia A. Kabo (title not given) assuring that "WEVD will
continue to broadcast its Yiddish News daily; the Forward Hour & News
Commentary in Yiddish every Sunday as is currently being aired."

Being somewhat out of WEVD's broadcast range, I can't tell whether the
two programs mentioned are all or part of the current Yiddish schedule
on the station whose call-letters are the initials of the Socialist and
trade unionist Eugene Victor Debs. Can others in NY comment?

Subject: WEVD

A phone call to Thomas Bird, station manager at WEVD elicited the
following information: there are now no plans to curtail the Yiddish
programming found on WEVD. That is, the 2 hours of Yiddish language
programming now heard weekly (some would say, _very_ weakly) are to
continue. (This includes the "Forward Hour" and news in Yiddish read by
Miriam Kressyn and/or Moshe Rosenfeld). However, there _is_ a policy of
attrition in effect; any show which loses its host due to death,
retirement or whatever, will _not_ be replaced (this recently happened
with a Yiddish language yeshiva fundraising program whose on-air rebbe
died) . These Yiddish shows are the last vestige of the once common
practice of "sustaining" programming (shows underwritten by the station
itself as a public service and not  dependent on a sponsor.) All the
other shows currently on the air are paid for in a "lease time" policy.
As a former producer/host of the Forward Hour (1990-1995) , I can sadly
attest to the enthusiastic disinterest of the Forward Association in
seeking out a new and vital listening audience by not allowing the
production of shows with both high quality Yiddish content and
contemporary broadcasting production values in the style of National
Public Radio. (Those Mendlyaner who may have heard my show know exactly
what I was trying to do.) The hewing to an antiquated style and poor
quality of Yiddish programming has meant that, with the dying off of the
generation weaned on Yiddish radio, the disappearance of the Yiddish
programs is inevitable. By allowing the Yiddish shows (and other foreign
language programs) to die of benign neglect, the station is, for the
first time in its history, making a profit. Ironically, as the
once-Socialist WEVD is no longer "red" in its outlook, it is no longer
operating _in_ the red, either.

Subject: Yiddish curses

I don't know anything about serious curses in Yiddish. But I find very
amusing the pseudo-curses used by women that have the explosive force of
a real curse, but the mildest of content. E.g. "du zolst esen kreplakh".

Subject: Yinglish or Yiddish?

My girlfriend often uses the phrase "s' hitzed" with the meaning "to be
upset", "angry", "all worked up over something".  I had never heard this
word before and looked up what I thougt the verb to be, "hitzen"
(hay-yud-tsadik-nun) in Weinreich.  Weinreich defines hitzen as "heat,
get excited continually; be exited", so this seems to correspond to way
I've heard the word being used.  However, I don't know why the "S'"
prefixed is attached.  Is this just a Yinglish adaptation or is it a
valid Yiddish prefix.  If it is valid, how is it used?

Subject: Yiddish word processing

I have been using WP 5.1 for four years.  It is a Hebrew word-processor
and lacks some of the Yiddish characters such as yud-yud, vav-yud, etc.
I have developed a number of macros which provide all the necessary
Yiddish characters.  This version supplies all the standard
word-processing functions including the mixing of English with Yiddish
and vice-versa.

Anyone needing help in setting it up can contact me.
