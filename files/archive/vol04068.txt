Subject: Lamed-tsadi

To: Arnie Kuzmack

There is a Hebrew abbreviation that I know about, lamed-tsadi for /lo
tsarikh/ 'need not; must not,' but it is not tsadi-sofit (final tsadi). I
wonder whether you have come across a scribal error. I cannot find your
version in the Even Shoshan dictionary.

Subject: allah/alemen

I think that Harold Orbach (4.065) misunderstood the important point in
Zellig Bach's correction of Evelyn Fein's "allah" in "A ... dank tzu
allah", which was not the un-YIVO spelling of "ale"  but the case, which
is dative, and so calls for "alemen".  "Loz mir alle zingin" (or "Lomir
ale zingen") is correctly recalled, but not relevant here.  Or have *I*
misunderstood the issue?

Does anyone know the whether this Yiddish poet and author
(b 1906) still lives?  His last known residence is in
Israel.  Thanks.

Subject: Tlomatskie 13

Some time ago (4.049), but only recently received because of mail sludge,
Leah Zazulyer asks about an important but still ignored piece of recent
history: the activity of Tlomatskie 13 (in  Polish Tlomackie),the Warsaw
headquarters of the Union of Jewish Writers and Journalists during the
interwar period.

This was a place that functioned as a kind of secular beys hamikdash for
a generation or two of Polish Jews. There is a great deal of relevant
written material, first of all two books, both titled "Tlomatskie 13,"
one by the novelist Z. Segalovitsh (Buenos Aires, 1946), and one by Ber
Rozen (Buenos Aires, 1950). Melekh Ravitsh was for many years the
Secretary; check his memoirs, as well as the memoirs of other literary
figures of interwar Poland.

Then, of course, the Yiddish press, above all the weekly "Literarishe
bleter" (annual volumes have indexes), and the daily press, "Haynt" and
"Der moment" (with an index now on line courtesy of A. Novershtern in
Israel; details in an earlier Mendele). A marvelous person to speak to is
S. L. Shneiderman in New York, who was an active member of this and many
other Warsaw Jewish literary scenes.

It's an exciting subject.  Good luck with it, Leah.

Subject: Grandmother's prayer

Arn Abramson: You're probably looking for "Got fun Avro(ho)m". There are
surely printed versions. Perhaps Zachary Baker or Shula Berger can supply
specific references.

The Atlas inquiry sought regional versions, but they've not yet been
transcribed--a task and topic for an MA.

By the way, there's a well-known (art?) song "Bobenyu, zog nokh nisht
'Got fun Avro(ho)m'", a plea to hold back the end of the Sabbath.

Subject: Friendly acts

Am I alone in finding something condescending and arrogant in addressing
one's friends and colleagues as "undzere khakhomim",\j

Subject: Seattle activities

To: Fishl Kutner

Your writeup up on the Toronto Yiddish Conference sounded so fascinating,
I wondered if you or perhaps some yiddisha Seattleites, had any info
available on anything of this nature, when my husband and I take a mini
vacation the end of this month.

We will leave, haysa, nussa Florida for, I hope, a bissel keeler und
maire trinken Seattle, far a pur tayg. We will be there from Sunday, July
31st through Wed noon, Aug. 3.  Would be interested in anything re:
yiddishkeit, programs, museums, etc.

A shainen danke to allamen (no allah THIS time :-) )
