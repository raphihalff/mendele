Subject: Search of Mendele archives: new and improved

My apologies to everybody who tried to search Mendele archives in Shtetl
in the past several weeks: due to some security problems with the old
software (WAIS) the search did not work. Now Mendele archives are
reindexed using state-of-the-art search engine (Isearch from CNDIR).
Isearch is a powerful retrieval system that implements sophisticated
search and ranking of the results algorithms. Isearch works efficiently
with complex boolean queries using weighted search terms, at the same
time the search form is user-friendly and simple. Currently only
full-text search is possible, search by fields (subject and author)
would be enabled later.

Search results are ranked according to the frequency of occurences of
higher scoring words. The score of the word depends on its frequency in
the database. For example, using word "yiddish" as one of the search
terms will not do any good, because "yiddish" occurs in every single
issue of Mendele.

Speaking of issues, current database includes 1,693 volumes of Mendele
(yasher koyekh, Noyekh). It is 4,233,776 bytes of high-quality
first-class information with almost no artificial flavors, artificial
colors, and other harmful ingredients. The database will be updated
approximately bimonthly.

URL for the search form:

http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/mendeles.html

The old URL (http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/mewais.html) now points to
the new search form and can be used as well.

Comments and suggestions about the new search engine and its
implementation would be appreciated.

Subject: Shpigel shprakh

While listening to Kol Yisroel short wave, poetry of two Yiddish poets
was read.  The poets were a father and son, Josef Kerler and Boris
Karloff.  During the reading the phrase "shpigl shprakh" was used.  Can
any one comment on the derivation and meaning of the phrase or is it an
expression coined by the poets?

Subject: "Ikh fur aheym"

Sema Chaimovitz Menora fregt in vol. 6.152 vegn dos lidl, "ikh fur
aheym."  ikh hob gevust az ikh hob a tashmir fun an altn plate un hob es
nor vos gefunen.

It is sung by Sam Appel on a record, "Songs I Love."  Listening to it,
these are the words I was able to make out. (He sings fast.)

ikh fur a heym

mazel-tov aykh Yidn.  mit mazol zol es zayn.
ikh veys ir vet zayn tsufridn.  ot vos hert zikh ayn.
gehoft hot mir oyf shtendik,  oykh tsu undzer glik.
der goles iz geendikt  un ikh fur yetst zurik.
es ruft oyf mir di shpine.  es hot mir ufgegolt.
ikh fur in Palestine  vi mayn zeyde hot gevolt.

ikh fur a heym.  ikh fur a heym.
ikh voyn nit mer  bay dem geher.
...

tsi iz dos dem lidl vos ir vilt?  az ir vilt vel ikh shikn di resht.

The accompaning notes say, "I'm Going Home," although written many years
ago, is very timely.  It tells about the Jew who is planning to return
to Israel, and with typical Jewish humor, explains why.  A great
all-time classic." There are songs sung in Yiddish, Hebrew and English,
all relating to Israel.

ikh vintsh aykh ale a gut gezunt 1997.

Subject: "Bay Mir Bist Du Sheyn"

I recently acquired the book _100 Best Songs of the '20s and '30s_.  On
page 362ff. I find "Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen (Means That You're Grand),"
with the following credits:

Original Lyrics by Jacob Jacobs
Music by Sholom Secunda
English Version by Sammy Cahn and Saul Chaplin.
The score contains the English lyrics only.

What are Jacob Jacobs' original Yiddish lyrics to "Bay Mir Bist Du
Sheyn"?

Subject: Masculine form for rebitsn

Has anyone coined a  Yiddish word for the masculine form for rebitsn?
Obviously the requirement was not necessary until this generation.
