nayich tieruh--  so i see ellen prince (whos she kidding
with that spelling) liked your extraordinary basserool
which I somewhere missed-- What in fact does it mean--
basser never has any rools as far as I know except the rool
of hefkeres and the rool of achesveresh which was party
after party like israeli politics-- beats the two party
system anyways unless youre a monogamist in which case the
first party can sue the second and vice versa, a problem
achisverish and henry the 8th didnt have.   -- so vus
meynteer-- "basserool" ?

A "baren boim" means "pear tree".  Birnbaum probably comes
from this.

[A similar response came from Margaret Mikulska.]

Never again in Hebrew, reduction of paperwork
act, from four syllables to two, "lo ohd."

Subject: Names: Milman & Melman

After sharing the recent discussion of the name Katz with a
friend (named Kac), we began to wonder about the name of
another part of her family, Milman.  Does anyone know the
nature of the relationship between the names Milman and
Melman?
 
As Yiddish mil and mel are related in the same way as
English mill and meal or German mill and mehl, would this
suggest that they are seperate families raher than varient
forms of the same name? (Or maybe it suggests nothing at
all?) At any rate, the name Milman was unfamiliar to me.
Infomation regarding geographic origin of this family or
anything else would be welcomed (e.g. famous/notable
Milmans)

Subject: A few lines of introduction

My name is Marc L. Greenberg and I'm an Assistant Professor
of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the University of
Kansas. My specialization is Slavic linguistics,at the
moment particularly pertaining to Slovene and
Croatian/Serbian.  I'm sorry to say that I do not know
Yiddish (my great-grandparents were the last speakers in
our family) though I can figure out much of it from my
reading knowledge of German. Yiddish is one of the
languages on my wish list, and I hope to set aside some
time in the near future to learn it properly.(Kelberne
hispayles.) So, I hope no one will mind if I just "audit,"
unless I can be of some help with Slavic languages.
