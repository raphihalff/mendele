Subject: S'iz geven erev krismes

Sheldon Benjamin asked for a Yiddish version of Clement
Moore's poem. One version can be found in a book by Marie
B. Jaffe, _Gut Yuntif, Gut Yohr_ [sic], (New York:  The
Citadel Press, 1969).  Since the text is long and I don't
want to offend Reb Noyekh's sensibilities, I'll quote only
the first few lines and send a photocopy of the rest by
snail-mail to Sheldon and to anyone else who requests it.
The poem begins:

  'Sis geven erev krismes, und shtil is in heizel,
  Kein nefeshel rirt zich, afileh kein meizel;
  Beim oiveleh zeinen die zocken gehangen,
  Mit hofnung as bald vet der yuntif onfangen...

Subject: terms for gentiles

Reading the discussion on "shiksa" and "sheygitz" I feel
very much that this is where I came in.

In the original draft of my "introduction" to Mendele, I
wrote that I had been married for more than forty years to
a "shkisa." At our shames' instance, I was persuaded to
delete the term which he assured me was offensive. I did as
asked, though I was not really convinced, because in my
family I had never heard the term used pejoratively.
However, the current discussion has certainly convinced me
that many do find the term deeply offensive.

Although I was pleased to see Ellen Prince's defense of the
terms, aspects of it bothered me. The idea that "shiksa"
and "sheygitz" were used to indicate that Jewish children
were good looking, is too strongly redolent of the
"zelbsthas" of the ghetto, as though good looks were not to
be expected of Jewish children.

Finally, I do hope no one will take offense (because truly
none is intended) at the following joke which was told to
me by my mother who had picked it up in the South Miami
Beach Jewish community:

"Rebbe, rebbe, iz okh un veh! M' tanst mit shiksas un m'est
khazar."

"Noo, iz vohs? Az m' vet tansen mit khazayrim un essen
shiksas, dos vet zayn eppes."

Subject: Etymology

Does anyone have an explanation of how 'hinerplet' comes
to mean lethargy, coma, etc.?

Noyekh

[Also, while I'm up: like the unpleasant feeling I get
from those clothing store mirrors, I'm not a little
chagrined to discover that the shames has become a
virtual Anthony Comstock.  And it's true!

I apologize for him and wish to announce that he--that
shoyte--will be kept henceforth under strict control, and
that Mendele's readers should feel free to write anything
they like.  Hulyet vi fil aykh glust!  nm]

Subject: chagall in Manhattan

N.Y area Mendelists may be interested to know about the
Chagall exhibit at the Guggenheim in SoHo. They have
Chagall's costume and set designs on display. Ch' prepared
them in the 1920s for the State Jewish Chamber Theater
(Moscow). As an added benefit visitors learn about the
story of this theater-company. The exhibit is an ideal
place to take a break from your X-nukkah (pron. Chi-nuka)
shopping activities. The address is: 575 Broadway near
Delancey (be careful at the crossing!)

Subject: schvartze as derogatory

A speculation:  schvartze/shiksa/shegetz as adjectives are
perhaps non-judgmental, simply descriptive.  The words
become derogatory when used as nouns as in der schvartze,
etc.  The analog that struck me as I thought about it is
that I am not offended if one says that Cal Pryluck is a
Jew; I would be profoundly offended if referred to as The
Jew.

Subject: RE: pejorative words

A propos Vicki Fromkin's and others, I note an incident
which occurred in my class at the Summer Program in Yiddish
at Columbia this year.  Most of my classmates were in their
20's, learning Yiddish without having heard it spoken at
home.  When the text (Weinreich's _College Yiddish_)
referred to schvartze, the class unanimously voted to read
(instead):  "mentchen fun kolor."  The term was obviously
perceived as pejorative by these young Yiddish learners.

This occurred despite der lehrer's insistence that the
expression was descriptive and not pejorative.
