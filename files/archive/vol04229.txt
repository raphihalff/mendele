Subject: Words of Semitic origin in Western Yiddish

Rick Gildemeister:

I think saying that there are more words of Hebrew-Aramaic origin in WY
is impressionistic.  You, who are more familiar with Eastern Yiddish,
read a WY text and the words (of Semitic or other origin) that aren't
familiar to you in EY varfn zikh in di oygn.  If a speaker of WY were to
read an EY text, the Semitic-derived words of EY (that aren't used in WY)
might varf zikh in di oygn of that speaker.

Subject: Oon/chatchke

In reply to Mikhl Herzog's RQ for documentation:

oon:  This usage of a dual pronoun in Yiddish was reported to me by an
elderly native speaker from Lodz. She said it was spelled in Yiddish:
aleph vov lange nun. She was also familiar with the form enk but said
that in her region and further east toward Russia oon was preferred.

Chatchke vs. tsatske: I became conscious of the distinction ( as opposed
to always being subliminally aware) when the discussion of its etymology
arose here in Mendele. Could it be that one usage comes from the Hebrew
while the other comes from the Polish? A Yiddish speaking friend of mine,
whose family comes from the neighborhood Bialystock, upon hearing of my
observation concerning the distinction in usage between the two differnt
pronunciations of what I thought of as the same word, replied that of
course she knew the difference; they are two different words.

Re my own yiddish provenance: My mother came from Staraya Bikhov, a small
Dnieper valley town in Minske gubernia, Belerus. She spoke a proste
Yiddish and in this country generally read the Forvest. My father came
from a shtetl deep in the Ukraine near the town of Cherkass. His command
of Yiddish was more sophisticated. His preferred newspaper in this
country was Der Tog. I am not conscious of whether there were any dialect
differences between their speech, and if so, which is the one I learned.
I rather suspect that in Yiddish my mother's version dominated since she
continued to speak to me in Yiddish all my life while my father had
complete command of English and generally preferred it when speaking to
me. In fact as I think about it now, I seem to have gotten the impression
that Yiddish was the language of women and perhaps little children, and
of course greenhorns, but that men preferably speak English. My father
came to America about 1906 at the age of 20, my mother 1912 at the age of
16. They both regarded their native language as Russian even though it
was not spoken in their respective homes, nor was it used but rarely in
our home.

Subject: Oi, I'm in pain but need a word for it!!

In a conversation with the shames, I mentioned that, unlike English, the
various pains and aches spoken of in Yiddish all seem to have a specific
word that describes them.  In English, for example, there is a pain in
the head, a pain in the back, a pain in the arm.  I happen to have a pain
in the ankle.

But in Yiddish there is a considerable distinction between "klopt in di
zaytn" and "hakt in kop."  (I am grateful for Noyekhh helping me with my
spelling but he bugged out on the next one.  Perhaps my mother made it
up?)  Then there is the ear.  In Yiddish, one does not have an earache.
Instead, one describes the condition as "geooghit".  As for the stomach,
no one has a bellyache.  Instaed, the "boach bochtzit."

My problem is my ankle.  I don't know the word for that specific pain and
cannot communicate with my MD.  What is the word for ankle pain?

(I know.  I know.  Six people will give me 8 words, and 11 will correct
them.)

Is this a discovery that will rank with that of knowing that the earth
goes 'round the sun instead of vice-versa (whose translation I would also
appreciate)?  Is there some metaphysical principle involved here?

Subject: O Ir Kleyne Likhtelekh

O Ir Kleyne Likhtelekh is a wonderful little Khanike song by Rosenfeld
(music by Leo Low).  It appears in several song books including the
Hebrew University Anthology of Yiddish Folksongs.  We always sing it at
Khanike tsayt, and I remember it being sung in my grandmother's house
as well.  Words on request (I've noted a propensity of late for the
shames to nix the posting of songs for public consumption in favor of his
forwarding them to the individual who inquired).

Subject: Rotwelsch?

Reuven Frankenstein writes that 300 to 400 Hebrew words have entered
German either through Yiddish or Rotwelsch.  What is Rotwelsch?

Subject: Women writers

Over the last year or so several subscribers have mentioned the existence
of leyenkrayzn in Toronto, New York and elsewhere whose focus is on women
Yiddish writers.  I'm happy to report that one of these groups has
produced an impressive collection which has just appeared:

_Found Treasures_: Stories by Yiddish Women Writers, ed. Frieda Forman,
Ethel Raicus, Sarah Silberstein Swartz and Margie Wolfe. Toronto: Second
Story Press, 1994.  ISBN 0-929005-53-8

_Found Treasures_ contains twenty selections from the work of eigtheen
writers, among them Rokhl Brokhes, Miriam Raskin, Esther Singer Kreitman,
Malka Lee and Kadia Molodowsky.  There are as well an interesting introduc-
tion by Irena Klepfisz, two very useful bibliographies and some entrancing
photographs.

Vert dos gelt.

I leave serious literary criticism to my betters, who I hope will not be
slow in reviewing the book.
