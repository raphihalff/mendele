Subject: Yiddish New Testament

to jeremy stern:

i have a yiddish new testament (der brit hadasa) translated by a
henry einspruch and published by the lewis and harriet lederer
foundation, 6204 park hts ave., baltimore, md 21215, 1977, 5th ed.,
distributed by the messianic jewish center here. yes, the goal would
be to make it as 'heymish' as possible, given its intended use as a
proselytizing tool.

Subject: a kholem

last night i dreamt that i was watching tv and there was some panel
discussion (don't know on what) and one of the panelists was our own
vicki fromkin. and, to my delight, she was wearing a mendele
t-shirt! it looked very much like a t-shirt i have advertising the
yiddish-english theatrical production a few years ago, dos goldene
land. gee, maybe we should get t-shirts? :)

Subject: Yiddish words for "verse"

In connection with his interesting posting about the Yiddish New
Testament, Jeremy Stern asks whether there is a Yiddish word for
"verse" ther than "posuk" (pl. "p'sukim").  "Ferz" (pl. "ferzn")
has, I believe, the same meaning, but is obviously cognate to the
German "Vers(e pl.)."

"Posuk" seems to me appropriate only in reference to scriptural
verses. I can't imagine using "posuk" for, say, a verse of
Shakespeare ... "Merchant of Venice" *maybe*, but the goyishe
dramas, neyn.

Subject: Scholem Aleichem (or, if you will, Sholem Aleykhem)

Writes Dvosye Bilik:

> On the subject of "mentsh un froy" let us recall that in Sholem
> Aleykhem's Taybele, the main character says referring to herself "a
> froy iz oykh a mentsh" This is a very early work by S.A.-- 1884.

I am not familiar with that quotation, but it would seem to have no
bearing on the subject.  There does not have to be any intended pun
or word-play.  In English, there is the cliche, "Kids are people,
too."  The purpose is just to affirm the woman's -- or child's --
humanity, not to change the meaning of the word, "people".

Subject: Introduction

I studied yiddish for many years in a Sholem Aleichem Folk Schule
but lost contact with it, unfortunately. Subscribing to Mendele is
my way of retaining contact with at least the culture.

Subject: Introduction

I am currently Head of the Department of Chemical Engineering and
Director of Bioengineering at the University of Illinois in Chicago.
Why is an engineer interested in Yiddish?  Because it was my first
language. My parents spoke Yiddish at home, and I attended Arbeiter
Ring schools from age 6 through 13.  At that time, my Yiddish was
reasonably fluent, but I have not used it for 45 years.  I joined
the network because I want to resurrect my knowledge of Yiddish.  As
I read material on the network, I will contribute as best as I can,
when my memory returns.  Of course, at my age memory tends to get
worse with time.  I intend to buck that trend.  We will see if I
succeed.
