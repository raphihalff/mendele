Subject: mameloshn un Weiberdeutsch

Does anyone out there in the electronic wilderness have
some bibliographical references for the origins of the
expressions "mameloshn" and Weiberdeutsch? Also: are any of
you aware of any journal articles in English (French,
Yiddish, German, Spanish, Dutch ) which deal with the
gendering of Yiddish (feminized) versus Hebrew
(masculinized).

Thanks for your help!

I'm mystified, even though I speak a Toronto r-dropping
Yiddish. Can you clarify, Mikhl?
