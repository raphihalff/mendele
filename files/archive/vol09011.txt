Post Doctoral Fellowships 2000-2001
Application Deadline November 30, 1999

MODERN JEWRY AND THE ARTS

Jewish involvement in the arts in the modern era has been remarkable, and an
examination of this phenomenon is likely to yield rich and fascinating
insights into many aspects of Jewish history and culture. The CAJS will
devote its annual seminar to this theme. Among the questions it will
consider are the following: What is the connection between Jewish identity
and Jewish artistic creativity in modern times?  How did the Jewish influx
into the arts affect the evolution of modern Jewish culture, its aesthetic
and spiritual concerns, and the relations between Jews and non-Jews?  How
are we to understand the evolution of such terms as "Jewish art" and "Jewish
music"?  How have Jews represented themselves in art, music, architecture,
theater and film, and how have Jews been represented in these media by
non-Jews? How have Jewish political, cultural, and religious organizations
employed the arts in order to advance their own agendas? What has been the
role of the arts in Jewish efforts to forge a collective memory and a
"usable past"? How has the rediscovery by modern scholars of ancient and
medieval Jewish art and musical traditions affected the development of
modern Jewish art and culture? What is the significance of the role of Jews
as patrons, critics, and scholars of the arts, and as consumers of "high"
and "popular" culture?  And what has been the place of theater and museums
in disseminating Jewish culture and art?

The seminar will concentrate on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
although subjects related to the early modern period may also be considered.
It will focus on developments in Europe, the American continent,
Palestine/Eretz Yisrael, and the State of Israel. Scholars of modern Jewish
history and culture, as well as those outside the field who combine an
interest in Jewish life with expertise in the fields of art, architecture,
music, theater and film are invited to apply. Professional artists and
musicians with scholarly interests and with a relevant scholarly project are
also encouraged to apply. 

Outstanding graduate students in the final stages of writing their
dissertations may also apply. Stipend amounts are based on a Fellow's
academic standing and financial need with a maximum of $30,000 for the
academic year. A contribution may also be made towards travel expenses.
Application deadline is November 30, 1999. Awards will be announced on
February 1, 2000.

[Fun der Bobover Luakh:]

Altz bokher hot kvod kdosho moron moreinu horav rav shloimeh zikhroi yogen
oleinu gehot a getreyen khaver mit vemen er hot tzusamen gelernt b'khevrusoh
fille yorn.  Ober shpeter is der rebbe oysgevaksen tzu zein einer fun di

nisht geven. 

Herendik di groyskeit fun zein yugnt-khaver velkher shpilt aza rizige role
in der khsidisher velt, hot yener mekane geven der rebbe.  Amol, ven er hot
zikh tzuzamengetrofn mit der rebbe, hot yener gefregt, "Mir hobn dokh
tzuzamen gelernt, mir zenen tzusamen oyfgetzoygn gevorn, un ver nokh vi ir
veyst az ikh bin punkt vi aykh a talmid khokhm, a y'rey shomayim, an oyved
hashem, un a yakhsn.  Nu, farvos kumen tzu eikh a velt mit khasidim, un ikh
bin nisht mer vi a shtetldiger rov on kein ein khosid?" 

Zogt oif dem der rebbe, "Es iz emes, ir zent a talmid khokhm un a y'rey
shomayim nokh mer fun mir, un es vundert mir takeh farvos mentshn loyfn mir
nokh un eikh nisht.  Nor yetzt falt mir ein a shtikl teirutz, az efsher iz

vider klert shtendig arein hayitokhen ikh hob yo khasidim un ikh bin a rebbe
un ir nisht.  Ot dos aleyn iz der teyrutz.  Es vendet zikh vos der mentsch
halt of zikh." 

Un heint, dermonen di khasidim, shteyt in der heilige toirah, "V'ho-ish
Moishe onov m'od mikol ho-odom." 

As a boy, the holy Reb Shloime, may his memory protect us, had a close
friend with whom he studied for many years.  Later, however, the Rebbe grew
to be one of the great and righteous men of his generation, with a world of
hasidim.  The other, despite the fact that he was a great scholar and a
famous teacher, had no hasidim who considered him to be their rebbe. 

Upon hearing of the greatness of the friend of his youth, who was now
playing such a central role in the hasidic world, he became exceedingly
jealous.  Once, when he met the rebbe, he asked, "We studied together, we
grew up together, and who knows more than you that I am just as accomplished
a scholar as you, just as pious, that I am a true servant of the Lord, and
that I have a pedigree as well?  So, why does the entire Hasidic world come
to you while I am no more than a town rabbi without a single follower?" 

The rebbe responded, "It's true, you are indeed a great scholar and a pious
man, far more than I.  And I wonder why people run to me and not to you. 
But I have just thought of a bit of an answer to the question. Perhaps this
itself is the reason:  I stand in amazement and ask, 'Isn't it odd that you
are not a great rebbe and have no hasidim, while I have?' While you are
constantly wondering why you have no hasidim while I am a rebbe and have
followers.  This is indeed the answer:  It all depends upon what a person
thinks of himself." 

To which today's Hasidim add that the Torah teaches us that our greatest
leader, Moishe Rabbenu, was the humblest of men.

Subject: Fusion language

Max Weinreich characterizes Yiddish as a fusion language in his _History
of the Yiddish Language_. Modern Hebrew is also characterized as such by
some researchers. Can anyone refer me to theoretical works dealing with
this concept including its definition(s) and typology?

Subject: "Eugene Onegin" lyrics

My uncle reports that recently, while attending a performance of the
Tchaikovsky opera "Eugene Onegin" in Detroit, he suddenly found himself
flashing back to a memory of 60 years, hearing the voice of his father, my
zeyde, singing to a tune found early in the opera's second act: 

zog mir nor lenski
farvos geyt du nisht tantsn
shteyst in a vinkl
shmuest mitn vantsn

He wonders if there ever was a Yiddish version of the libretto, or if we
should conclude that der zeyde was doing his own off-the-cuff translation... 
Anyone have a clue?

Andrew Cassel asked about the Yiddish translation of "Eugene Onegin". 
Incidentally, today is the 200th birthday of Onegin's author. Mendele joins
the celebration with a selected bibliography of Yiddish translations of
Pushkin's works. Alexander Sergeevich Pushkin (1799-1837) directly and
indirectly influenced several generations of Yiddish poets, among them many
translators of his poetry (see the bibliography). There are many Yiddish
poems dedicated to Pushkin. This year marks another anniversary: the first
full translation of "Eugene Onegin" by Aron Itskhok Grodzensky was published
80 years ago.  The imprint of the first edition reads: "Katerinaslav: Farlag
Visnshaft, 1919".  In 1919 Katerinaslav (Russ. Ekaterinoslav, since 1926 -
Dnepropetrovsk) was home to more than 70,000 Jews in the midst of the bloody
Russian Civil War.  Paper was an extremely scarce and strategic commodity,
allocated exclusively for the handrolled cigarettes and leaflets of numerous
fighting armies and militias of different colors: Red, White, Green (no, not
the environmental movement), Yellow-and-Blue... Most of them did not display
any signs of philosemitism. For the Jews, escaping the pogroms and finding
bread for the children would seem to be the priority agenda items. Yet,
somebody decides to publish the Yiddish translation of "Eugene Onegin",
apparently knowing that there was a market for this book [1].  Where are you
today, unknown to me publishers from the "Visnshaft"? 

Grodzensky's translation of "Yevgeni Onegin : roman in ferzn" was reprinted
in Vilna by B. A. Kletskin in 1923. Yiddish translations of some other works
