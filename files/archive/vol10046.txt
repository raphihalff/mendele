Subject: Alter Kacyzne's "goldene shikh"

To some Yiddishists certain recent events in the United States seemed
positively Chelemish, so I thought this might be a good time to share
Alter Kacyzne's poem. The Yiddish version can be found in:
http://www2.trincoll.edu/~mendele/poetry.htm.

Noyekh Miller

              alter kacyzne 
              goldene shikh   
            (khelemer nusekh)

Subject: A Purim lidl: Zayt zhe yidn sha un shtil

I'm looking for a Purim song called "Zayt zhe yidn sha un shtil".  I
have one verse and would like to know if there are more and what the
music is.

Here is what I have:

Zayt zhe yidn sha un shtil (3)
Mir fangen on dem pruim shpil.
A purim shpil in gramen, Vos hot a toyznt tamen (2)
Zayt zhe yidn sha un shtil (3)
Mir fangen on dem purim shpil.

A dank,
Lorele Cahan-Simon

Subject: Silent night in Yiddish

My name is Alexander Krischnig, I am a 30 years old Austrian and I 
would like to ask you a little favour. I am very much interested into 
foreign languages and cultures, that's why I am collecting - among 
other things - the Austrian Christmas carol "Silent night" (German 
"Stille Nacht") in as many languages as possible. I have heard that the 
lyrics of this song exist also in Yiddish language, but as it is a 
Christian song I did not suceed in obtaining the Yiddish version so far 
(only the Hebrew one).

Maybe, you have heard about a Yiddish version of that carol or maybe, 
you even have the lyrics, so  I would be very much delighted and most 
thankful if you could either send it to me (if possible, in Hebrew with 
Latin transcription) or, maybe you could give me some hints where I 
might get it.

It really means a lot to me and I am very much looking forward to 
receiving a positive reply from you. So, let me thank you in advance 
for your kindness.

Best regards and greetings from Vienna un a sholem aleykhem!

Alexander Krischnig

Sholem aleykhem,                                                     I
am looking for the Yiddish original of Marc Chagall's poem, "To the
Martyred Artists", translated by  Moshe Kohn.  Please reach me  at my
e-mail address.  A sheynem dank.

Subject: naming conventions

Most everyone knows that Jewish males are traditionally named so & so
"ben" so & so or so & so "bar" so & so. It was always my understanding
that "ben" is "son (of)" in Hebrew & that "bar" is the same in Aramaic. I
have a couple of questions:
   
Is there any convention which determines whether ben or bar is to be used
or does it not matter?
   
On another listserve someone wrote that "bar" is also an abbreviation of
"ben Reb" (son of Mr. so & so). Is this true? The other listserve's
members are not particularly knowledgeable in either Yiddish or Hebrew. I
did see recently a signature from the 1700s in which "bar" had the 2 upper
slash marks between the beyz & reysh that Yiddish uses for abbreviations.

Thank you,

Subject: kant

Recently a number of non-Yiddish speakers have mentioned that the Jewish
"recruits" forced into serving in the tsarist army for 25 years during the
tragic period of 1827-1855 were called "cantonists"  because they were
housed in camps called "cantons". I am wondering whether they are
confusing the English word "canton" which does have as one meaning
"quarters for military troops" with the Yiddish word "kant" which as far
as I ever heard means only "region", "rim, edge".  My older relatives
always told me that "Di gekhapte yidishe yinglekh hot men gerufn
Nikolayevske soldatn vayle Nikolay iz geven der tsar un kantonistn vayle
zey zaynen farshikt gevorn in di vayte kantn".
   
Does anyone know "kant" in Yiddish as also having the meaning of military
camp, quarter for troops, etc. or is this merely a confusion with the
English word?
   
Thank you,
Mikhoyel Basherives

Subject: muz nisht vs. darf nisht

Efsher vet emitzer gefinnen a teyos in mayn oys-taytshung fun'm untershied
tsvishen di dozike tzvey oysdricken. (Nokh a frage: Zogt men in Yiddish
"muz nisht", oder muz men shtendik zogen "tor nisht"?)

"The verbs muz'n and darfen mean almost the same thing in the positive
sense; but they differ in the negative; furthermore, they don't behave at
all like the corresponding German modal auxiliaries, mÅssen and dÅrfen.
For example, Ikh darf nisht essen means, in Yiddish:  "I don't need to
eat"; while in German, the same sentence would mean, "I am not permitted
to eat". To express the latter thought in Yiddish, one would say: Ikh tor
nisht essen. In German, one who doesn't need to eat would say "Ich brauche
nicht zu essen"; he could also say "Ich mu· nicht essen" to express the
idea that "no one is forcing me to eat".

Subject: shtrekfisl

I got the following query from a friend; maybe somebody on Mendele can
throw some light on it.

A landsman of mine from Yonkers remembers that when, as a child, he asked
his grandmother who lived in the tower of the Yonkers City Hall, she
replied, "Shtrekfeesl."  What could she have meant?  Is this the name of
some Yiddish bogeyman or what?

Subject: Berlin in Yiddish literature

Dear Mendelyaner,

I'm working on a study of Yiddish literature from Berlin and am looking
for literary texts, that somehow reflect the experiences there. Quite well
known are Bergelson's Berlin stories as well as I. J. Singer's Karnovkies.
Does anybody know other writers, who wrote stories, poems or novels
located in Berlin or hinting at the time spend there?

A dank
