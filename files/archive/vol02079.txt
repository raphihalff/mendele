Subject: got vet helfn

Hanan Ayalti's collection "Yiddish Proverbs" (Schocken,
1949, 1963) includes

Got vet helfn--vi helf nor Got biz Got vet helfn.
                  ^^^^
translated for Ayalti by I. Goldstick as "God will
provide--if only God would provide until he provides."

Nu, gut.  But why is it "helf" rather than "helft", the
regular 3rd person singular present of helfn?  Is there a
tense (or mood or aspect or whatever) here that I never
learned?  Or could this be a misprint?

A dank.

1976.My research interests include work on Glikl
Hamil,Tsenerene, Holocaust lit. and Soviet Yiddish
writers.My current project is Der Daytch-The Image of the
(non-Jewish) German in Yiddish lit. I have collected
shprikhverter, oysdrukn, lider etc.I have given papers on
Aksenfeld's Shterntikhl and its presentation of Germans and
Germany as well as on Kulbak's Disner Tshayld Herold. I'm
working on Vaysenberg's Shmuglares.

I ask my fellow MENDLNIKES to inform me of any references
to Germans they have come across in their reading in
Yid.lit.I found an isolated reference `in an early
Vintshfingerl, in Perets Di Royz,Zibm gute yor. Sholem
Aleykhem's Marienbad is another source. I would be grateful
for any perl funder yidishe literatur vos hot a sheykhes

Subject: an idiom

After a recent faculty meeting a phrase popped into my mind
that I used to hear from my bubbeh.  The problem is, I
don't know the exact meaning and would ap- preciate any
help.  The phrase is: Se it govern mir NIMIS UND MUVIS.  I
under= stand the first four words.  "Nimis," ikh denk maint
miserable -- although I'm not sure.  But on "muvis" I draw
a complete blank.  For a moment I thought the word was
"boorvis" -- barefoot -- that's the word I thought I heard
her say when I was child, but it seems to my adult ear that
that's all wrong.  Ikh bait dir alleh fur an anfer.  Dank.
