Subject: Sarah in Yiddish poetry

For a project on the biblical Sarah, I would appreciate information on
Yiddish poetry about her.  I am familiar with Manger, but hope to find
more.

Thank you,

Subject: Talmy's Jabberwocky

Shalom! After a modest attempt to translate the sample piece of Alice, I
must say that the Talmy version is wonderful and full of wit and whimsy! I
meant to write earlier, but the protest letter prodded my enthusiastic but
belated response.  KOL HAKAVOD, MENDELE....
Best, Bracha

Subject: Talmy's Jabberwocky

Re: Jabberwocky

I'm in full agreement with der untershames. Yiddish folksong has a rich,
wide and deep store of misnagdish (doubters') songs that mock the Hasidic
rabbi (rebe). In fact, I often hear singers introduce a "Hasidic song,"
because it refers to the rebe, when it's actually the opposite.
(Philologos, in the Forward, once committed that error and published my
correction with an apology.)

I sincerely hope we have not come to the point where, as in some other
communities, the clergy is sanctified.

Subject: Talmy's Jabberwocky

Sore-Rokhl Shekhter (Rukhl Schaechter) complains that Len Talmy's
rendition of the "Jabberwocky" in Yiddish is offensive because it makes
fun of a rabbi.  But it doesn't.
Talmy's character is "Reb Averbukh."  _Reb doesn't mean "rabbi" -- not in
Yiddish, not in Hebrew, not in Aramaic, not in any other language I'm
familiar with.  _Reb_ is used in Ashkenazic discourse as a title,
preceding the first name of (traditionally and typically) a married man.
That's Sore-Rokhl's misunderstanding.  Talmy is in error, though, for
placing _reb_ immediately before a surname, in this case:  _Averbukh_
(variant:  Oyerbakh, Averbakh; usually spelled in Latinletters as
_Auerbach_).  The convention
governing the usage of _reb_ is similar to that of _don_ in Spanish (_don
Isaac Abrabanel_ or _don Isaac_, but NOT *don Abrabanel) and _sir_ in
English (Sir John Gielgud_ or _Sir John_, but NOT *Sir Gielgud).  The
title used before the name of a rabbi in Yiddish is _horav_, e.g.  _horav
shapiro, horav yitskhok shapiro, horav reb yitskhok shapiro_.  And "rabbi"
is _rov_ (note the different vowels:  _rov_is the common noun meaning
"rabbi"; _horav_ is the title preceding a rabbi's name).

Does anyone know how much of Sholem Aleichem's "In shturem" is
historically factual?

Subject: moyde

Regarding Benjamin Fogel's question about "Moyde," "Mode" in Hebrew
(whence
"moyde" in Yiddish) has the basic meaning of admitting. Apart from
admitting such things as culpability, it is also used to admit that
someone has done you a favor, i.e. to thank them. Both meanings exist in
the bible, and are still in use in Modern Hebrew.

Subject: moyde

Yiddish uses the Hebrew origin word "moyde" in both the sense of admission
and of thanks. "moyde zayn zikh" is to admit to a  transgression. "Moyde
ani" is the beginning of the prayer of thanksgiving (I am thankful...)
recited by the observant upon awakening and going to sleep.

The apparent confusion exists in Hebrew usage, as well. The New
Bantam-Megiddo Hebrew &amp; English Dictionary defines "moda" in the
Hebrew-English section as "thankful, grateful; admitting." However, in the
English-Hebrew section, both "grateful" and "thankful" are given as
"asir-toda," No reference to "moyde" whatever.

I admit to being thankful that I'm not a dictionary compiler.

Subject: Moyde and burkis
Date: March 24

I must have missed the original questions about these terms, so I don't
know who inquired about them.

Professor Bers is probably more expert in Greek than I am, but (burkos) is
a mire, or speaking metaphorically, the gutter. [The word is not, at least
in that form, attested in Classical Greek, the only Greek I dare speak
about. VBers] Leather is (derma) as in skin.

As for Moyde meaning thank you in Hebrew, is this some new slang?   Moyde
refers to a confession in Yiddish, as in "zihk moyde zain."
