Subject: another query

I know the subject was "yok", but it reminded me...

Does anyone *know* how "bok" ("buck"?) got to mean somebody
who doesn't know anything?  I have a number of guesses, but
nothing really firm.  At the risk of sounding like a bok, I
reserve them in favor of a more expert answer.

TO:  Mikhl Herzog
 
in answer to your question -- my father was from Vitebsk --
grew up with Chagall.  In fact, one of the great stories of
my (his) life was that when they were both in the gymnasium
they had paintings selected to be sent to Moscow for an
exhibit and my father took first place and Chagall second.

Cal Pryluck: Only now BECOMING an Emeritus Professor? A
veritible spring chicken. Camp Naivelt? Where? More
important: Pryluck. Noyekh Prylucki (Prilucki) is one of
the most prominent names in early 20th century Yiddish
linguistic/dialectological research. Lawyer, member of the
Polish Seym. Any connection?

Subject: Matza bray and (op)gefrishte matza

My grandmother used to make what she referred to as
"toasted" matza" as follows:

1) hold an entire "board" under cold water until the
surface begins to soften;

2) hold the softened matza over a high gas flame until it
   dries out and begins to curl, being careful not to burn
   either the matza or the fingers;

3) spread with butter or cream cheese and salt to taste for
   the best breakfast this side of gan-eden.

She also made matsa bray of the peppered rather than the
sweet variety.  My improvement is to saute diced onions in
the pan before adding the rest of the ingredients.  I also
add grated onions to the batter for matzo-meal latkes
(khremzlakh), being of the mind that anything that can
serve as a vehicle for onions can't be all bad (both matza
bray and khremzlakh are too bland for my taste without the
onions).

Subject: Introduction and query

Born in 1927 in New York City to immigrant parents (from
Smargon, a small city in *Vilne gubernye* in Lithuania).
My first language was English, but my parents spoke Yiddish
around the house (Russian or Polish when they didn't want
the kids to understand) and sent me to a far-left-wing and
ferociously irreligious Yiddish school three afternoons a
week in the East New York neighborhood of Brooklyn to learn
to read and write Yiddish, and to be indoctrinated into
socialist/communist thought.  The indoctrination didn't
survive my adolescence, but I have remained fond of the
language *fun kindvays on*, and about 15 years ago led a
group of colleagues at the State University of New York at
Buffalo systematically through Uriel Weinreich's *College
Yiddish*.  I have since worked my way through Mordkhe
Schaechter's *Yidish Tsvey*, though *kam mit tsores*.
Because of the anti-clericalism and anti-hebraicism of my
early Yiddish training, I have a hell of a time with the
Hebrew-Aramaic words and expressions in most writing.

And now, an inquiry.  In those salad days, I learned a
Yiddish version of the socialist/communist anthem
"Internationale".  I can recall only a fragment now (see
below), and would be delighted if someone out there can
come up with the entire song.  The people who taught it to
me are now, of course, *af yener velt.*

...Di velt fun gvaldhaytn un laydn
Tseshtern veln mir, un dan
Fun frayhayt glaykhhayt a gan-eydn
Bashafn vet der arbetsman...

[At this point, everyone was expected to stand with right
clenched fist raised, and sing the chorus.]
