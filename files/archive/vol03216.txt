Subject: re Khazars /re Shuls

For Ellen Prince: Ashley Montague, in MAN'S MOST DANGEROUS MYTH
(c.1951-52) cites a piece of research post WW II.  Blood tests were
taken of Jews and their su rounding "national" or native populations
from the USSR to Galicia in Spain.  Apparently the distribution of
blood types among Jews was exactly the same, percentages of A, AA,
O, etc., as that among their fellow nationals -- which, by the same
token, also differed in the proportion of A, AB, O, etc, from region
to region. What does this suggest?

For the Shul hunter, Kirschner. In Rome do as the ancientest of Jews
do; do Purim at the Central Synagogue on the Tiber, in the Via del
Tempio, if you can get in.  Or in Firenze, the Main Synagogue there.
I dont know abou the Venetian synagogue, however.  Shuls there are
what we would call grand temples here, as in NYC or LA, etc.  Only
old, old, old.

Subject: re Khazars

Something more has to be known about their kingdom before you
dismiss the story of their conversion to Judaism.  It has to do with
the crossroads of empires and the Silk Road, I believe.  My son, a
Chinese archaeologist who is the only Caucasian allowed on the great
sites beyond the Great Wall (cf his show that opens in LA, EMPIRES
BEYOND THE GREAT WALL: THE HERITAGE OF GENGHIZ KHAN, and goes to NYC
Mus of Nat History, after the show here closes (5 March opening),
and thence to Nashville, Vancouver, etc, the great amount of
treasures ever to have left China!  Most of them recently unearthed,
too, post 1945, remarks that he was taken to one of 100+ new sites
in Inner Mongolia a few times over the past year.  One famous one, a
great city, seems to have had at least 1000 temples, and was called
the city of 100 churches, the Black City. He saw there a newly
unearthed 4th Century cornerstone for a Nestorian temple, or church,
one of many.  There is lots of commerce east and west to be
discovered yet, or uncovered, and it dates back and back.

Jews seem to have been involved with it all always.  The recent
discovery of a silkthread in the hair of a mummy in Egypt, dating
from about 1500 BC, that gives us much pause. Also the use of
Chinese pottery, and porcelain, in such quantity as to be able to be
made the bas e for the mole of an artificial harbor at Caesarea!
that tells us that Jews passed through Khazaria much later, etc. The
Khazars were notoriously redheaded; so are many of my ancestors,
though I am blackheaded. Let us not be too quick to dismiss the vast
unknowns of ancient Jewish wanderings.

Subject: Yiddish-related dissertations at JTS

As a Yankl-Come-Lately to e-mail, I was astonished to discover the
speed with which these missives are received and the international
scope of mame-loshn (by which I mean English, of course).  One
ought to recite a special brokhe before logging in...

To further the exchange of information, I offer the following list
of dissertations I supervised or hope to supervise someday soon
under the aegis of the Department of Jewish Literature here at the
Jewish Theological Seminary of America.

(1) Daniela Mantovan (from Heidelberg) successfully defended her
thesis at Columbia Univ. on DER NISTER AND HIS SYMBOLIST SHORT
STORIES (1913-1929): PATTERNS OF IMAGINATION.  (JTS and Columbia
have a close working relationship thanks to Prof. Rakhmiel Peltz.
There is significant cross-registration between his courses and mine
and a wonderful complementarity.)

(2) Mark William Kiel (son of Yiddish poet Khonen Kiel) successfully
defended his thesis A TWICE LOST LEGACY: IDEOLOGY, CULTURE AND THE
PURSUIT OF FOLKLORE IN RUSSIA UNTIL STALINIZATION (1930-1931).  (The
thesis was submitted to the dept of Jewish History.)

(3) Francesco Melfo ( from Milan, Italy) is about to defend his
thesis THE RHETORIC OF IMAGE AND WORD:THE MAGAZINES MILGROYM AND
RIMON, 1922-1924 AND THE JEWISH SEARCH FOR NEUTRAL LOCI.

(4) Jillian Davidson (London, England) has begun writing her thesis
A SECULAR CATASTROPHE IN EASTERN EUROPE: THE FIRST WORLD WAR AND
JEWISH LITERATURE.

(5) Mikhail Krutikov (from Moscow) will soon begin work on his
thesis THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE YIDDISH NOVEL IN EUROPE AND AMERICA,
1905-1914.

(6) Carrie Friedman (Montreal-Jerusalem) will soon
begin work on THE LODZ GHETTO WRITINGS OF JOSEF ZELKOWICZ.

Subject: Yankee Yiddish

The quotations from Rechnitzer's Rejects (by David Sherman in
Mendele 3.208) remind me of a small cartoon book called "Yankee
Yiddish" published in the 1950s. It contains terms and phrases in
Yiddish and wrong meanings for them, with matching cartoons, which
might be guessed by the unknowledgeable. Some examples: "Shlim Mazl"
(or "Muzzle" - "A cowboy from the Catskills"), "A Shikse" ("an
electric shaver", and the cartoon shows a young woman using one),
"Goyeh" ("a famous Spanish painter"), "A killeh" ("a dangerous
gangster"), "A pisher" (a "strike-out artist" in baseball), "A
misseh mashine" ("who stole the car?").

The original book in that vein was "Fractured French"; its
best-known example was "Jeanne d'Arc" (- "no light in the john").
The correct meanings were given in the end of the books.

Answering Jeremy Stern's question (Mendele 3.213): "Kol koyre
bamidber" is straight Hebrew (in Ashkenazi pronounciation) and does
mean "a voice calls out in the desert" or "a voice calling out in
the desert".
