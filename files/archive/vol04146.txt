Subject: Kids and Yiddish -- A Family Yiddish Musical Experience

It is not very often that we get an opportunity to attend a top-notch
Yiddish show entirely geared to kids -- of all ages, I might add.

On Sunday November 6, 1994 at 1:30pm at the Katie Murphy Auditorium the
Workmen's Circle will be offering a sensational program for kids starring
Joan Borts, Adrienne Cooper, the Yiddish Troubador, Menachem, and the
Workmen's Circle Yiddish Chorus (here is where I take my bow) under the
direction of Zalmen Mlotek at the Fashion Institute of Technology,
located at Seventh Avenue and 27th Street, Manhattan. The price of the
tickets for this benefit performance ranges from $50 to $5 for kids and
they may be obtained by calling (212)889-6800 x226.

This is an opportunity to teach the kids in the most direct way the meaning
of the word _kvel_.

All the best,

Henry Mullish

Subject: Yekes

Last night at a dinner party the distinguished British novelist Bernice
Rubens -- on a current visit to us here in South Africa -- surprised me
by asserting that the orgin of the pejorative Yiddish term for a German
Jew, Yeke, is an acronym of the Hebrew phrase 'yehudim kshey oref'
(yud-kaf-ayin). This delightful explanation seems to me most interesting
and amusing -- but is it true? Can the learned *mendelenikes* advise,
confirm or deny?

I will look forward to provoking and to reading some of the vastly
erudite -- not to say pedantic -- responses that have filled the columns
of the elmails of recent months on other subjects. It would also be good
to hear from some real yekes what they think about it all.

Warmest regards to the khevre

Subject: Transliteration, romanization and translation

First I would like to give an example of an anecdote from Royte
Pomerantsen and a translation of the same story.

                             Nomen

Ba yunge por iz geborn gevorn a zun. iz geveyntlach geven a simche in
shtub. Tate-mame zanen geven gor prosste mentshn, ober take gor prosste.
Der yungn tatnstate iz geven a shiker, un di yungn mamens tate iz geven a
ganev----eyner gor fun di groysse shikurim, un der anderer gor fun di
groysse ganovim.  Un beyde mechotonim zanen shoyn hant, aych tsu lang
yorn, af der bessere velt. Hobn zach di yunge tate-mame ongehoybn tsu
krign, vi me zol a nomen gebn dem ingl. er hot gevelt, men zol em gebn a
nomen noch zayn tatn, un zi hot gevelt nit andersh noch ir tatn. Un az
man un vayb heybn zach on krign, iz dos b'li kets. Zey hobn zach gezidlt
un geshrien, un sol-kol-sof, zey hobn gezen, az zey kenen aleyn nit
durchkumen, hobn zey bashlossn geyn tsum rov. Zey kumen tsum rov, hert
zey der rov aus, un fregt em: "Vi hot geheyssn dayn tate?" Zogt der man:
"mayn tate hot geheyssn Avrom-Dovid." Fregt der rov di vayb: "Nu, un vi
hot geheyssn dayn tate?" Zogt zi: "Avrom-Yitschok." Zogt der rov: "Iz
doch gut, vos vilt ir? Ruft dem ingl Avrom. Ay vos? noch velchn Avrom?
Vet ir zen shpeter: vet der ingl aussvaksn a shiker, vet es zayn noch dem
tatns tate, un oyb er vet aussvaksn a ganev, vet dos zayn noch di mamens
tate."

                  What's in a Name  (Ausubel)

When the time came for naming their first born son, a husband and wife
began to wrangle with each other. She wanted to name him after her
father; He wanted to name after his father. Unable to asgree they went to
the rabbi to referee the dispute. " What was your father's name?" asked
the rabbi of the husband. "Nahum." "And what was your father's name?" the
rabbi asked the wife. "Also Nahum" "Then what is the whole argument
about?" asked the puzzled rabbi. "You see rabbi," said the wife " My
father was a scholar and a god fearing man, but my husband's father was a
horse thief!" The rabbi pondered and pondered. It was indeed a ticklish
matter; he didn't wish to hurt the feelings of the husband. So he said,
"My decision is that you name your son Nahum and leave the rest to time.
If he becomes a scholar, then you will know that he was named after his
mother's father. If on the other hand, he becomes a horse thief, it will
be clear that he was named after his father's father.

p.s. I love the rhythm and the nuances of the of the transcription. The
translation hot nisht ken tam. It's like a corned beef sandwich on
gentile bread with butter.  (is that too harsh, enshuldig mir) Am I the
only who ever went to the A&P and asked for a gentile bread) pps. Dear
Zellig it grieves me to think that I made you feel bad for even one
moment. I have the utmost respect for you and for what you are trying  to
accomplish for yiddish. Please understand my only contact to yiddish is
through transliteration, and I had never heard of " romanization" or the
phrase "kitchen yiddish" before mendele. You have my heartfelt hand shake
and best wishes biz hundert un tsvantzig.

Al Strauss
