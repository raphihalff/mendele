Subject: Itche Goldberg

As wonderful as it has been to read so many prominent obituaries about my
father and to know that so many people are reading about him, I have been
feeling that some essence of who he was still needs to be expressed and
shared. The following, though still only a beginning, attempts to fill out
the picture a bit.

Susan Goldberg

Our beloved Itche died at home in NYC on Dec. 27, at the age of 102. From
the day when, a streetwise and spirited 14-year-old in WWI Warsaw, he
talked his way into a teaching institute for much older students by
assuring the director that if he didn't admit him it would be a loss for
the Jewish people, Itche devoted his life to the perpetuation of the
Yiddish language and its literature at their most elegant, nuanced and
sophisticated, stressing the quality of that literature and placing it
alongside other great world literature; and to the social and  humanistic
values of the secular Yiddish movement of which he was a leader, values
that emphasized the worth and dignity of the common people and the
importance of freedom and justice for all people. He was a master of the
language, a mesmerizing teacher, a compelling speaker and writer, and a
critic and publisher of other Yiddish writers and poets. His friends were
the many writers, artists, actors, musicians and activists of the
international Yiddish community, as well as hundreds and hundreds of
ex-students, representing every decade from the 1920s on.

Warm, sharp, ironic, funny -Itche had time and space for everybody, no
matter their size, their age, their position in life. He spoke with respect
and interest to every person he encountered. It was never too late or too
early to call him or to show up at his office for a cup of coffee, a
parable, a conversation sprinkled with casual references to writers living
and dead, quotations, fragments of poetry and song. He was charming,
playful, and could be unexpectedly silly. He had a boundless capacity for
friendship, and although he outlived all of his contemporaries and probably
most in the generation after them, he continued to make new friends
literally to the very end of his life, welcoming them to his home, his
table, pulling them into his orbit, genuinely caring about them all.

Most of all, he loved his family, and we all loved him beyond what words
can express. His absence, his silenced presence, is tangible. He was always
at the table, always with a book and pen in hand, always holding court.
There were few dull moments around him; things, along with the coffee, were
always percolating. He was the last in a family of six siblings, uncle to
an array of nieces and nephews whom he loved. He never missed a performance
or a graduation of his granddaughters, from preschool on. He was the first
to arrive at the hospital to welcome the arrival of his
great-grandchildren, whom he held and gazed at in wonderment for hours. He
never missed a birthday and was always at pains to find the most fitting
gift for each person. Most of all he loved and cherished Jennie, his wife
of 66 years (and quite a few more years before that, if truth be known). He
is survived by Jennie, who is 101; their children, Susan (and her partner
Janet) and David (and his wife, Rita); his two adored granddaughters, Zoe
(and her husband David) and Nana Catarina; and his adored
great-grandchildren, Ollie (Yankl, to Itche) and Tessa. We love him and
miss him already, and will miss him all the more as time goes on.

He had no use for death--his own or that of his language. He published his
last book (Esayen Tsvey) at 102, the last issue of his magazine (Yidishe
Kultur) the year before. He was never ready to stop and would have
continued if could have. He sang, recited, translated and quoted until his
very last days. He refused to accept the murder of Yiddish and its literary
figures as a final chapter, and he leaves us as his legacy, along with all
of his scholarly and critical work, his optimism and determination that the
language and all the words in which it has been given expression shall not
die. Zog nit keyn mol az du geyst dem letstn veg!

A memorial for Itche is being planned and will be announced soon. A fund is
being set up in Itche's name to further the study of Yiddish literature.

Subject: der sotn tantst oyfn dakh

In a Yiddish story, I came across the expression "Der sotn tantst oyfn
dakh." I was interested in knowing if anyone has encountered this
expression in any text, or if anyone can offer any explanation or
commentary.

Subject: Jewish women in prewar Shanghai

A colleague in Chinese history and native Yiddish speaker in Israel wrote
me recently of a project concerning two Jewish women who found themselves
in Shanghai in the prewar era.

"I am thinking of writing an essay about two Jewish ladies in China whose
contribution is not negligible. One is Shoshana Kahan and her Yiddish
Shanghai diary, but I must find out more about her life. The other is Luo
Chen, or Rosenberg, from Poland who married a Chinese student in Paris,
then wrote a marvelous book that became very popular and was made into a
movie around 1930, a rather amazing film that was sent to me by a former
student."

If anyone knows anything about Shoshana Kahan's life, especially after
coming to New York, please contact me, and I'll pass the information along.

Many thanks in advance,

Josh Fogel

Subject: "Erets yisroel"

In Vol. 16.014 (Nov. 14, 2006) Meylekh Viswanath asked about "Erets
Yisroel" (New York, 1918), concerning which I had sent a long posting to
the list. Anticipating that the answers to his questions also may be of
interest to others, and with apologies for my long delay I'm responding to
the list.

...How far back does it go? Is it restricted to modern Times or does >it go
back to antiquity?

The book starts from the Biblical period and goes through post-Biblical
Middle Ages and Renaissance - but in a very abbreviated form (Biblical to
1500 in about 40 pages). From the early modern period on, it goes into much
more detail. The authors state their sources at the end of each chapter,
and there are photographs and illustrations throughout.

...Where might one get a copy?

That's a much more difficult question to answer. To the best of my
knowledge, the book is not in print. The out-of-print ABE Web site
<www.abebooks.com>, turns up three copies for sale: from $55 to the
astonishing price of $350 USD! The prices reflect varying levels of
condition. All copies are of the 1918 edition. Because the titles are
transliterated differently, here are all three of the dealers:

1. $55 - Schwartz Judaica (San Diego), inventory # 001919.

2. $220 - The Book Gallery (Jerusalem), inventory # A 194 014.

3. $350 - Howard H. Weetall, Bookseller (Las Vegas), inventory # 3226.

Bernard Katz

P.S. a reproduced copy can also be obtained ($53 for non-members and $41
for members) from the digital library project of the National Yiddish Book
Center - I should have thought of them! <http://yiddishbookcenter.org/+yb>
will lead you to their catalogue - try "Erets Yisroel: in fergangenheyt" as
a title.

Subject: va pyervoye

In response to Roby Newman's question about the meaning of the phrase

       Ven der keyzer Nikolay fayerve hot gehot a milkhome...


The writer used the Russian word pyervyi = first, which makes the sentence
about Nikolay the First.

In the next sentence va pyervoye= first of all.

     Mir past nit azoy fil oystsushraybn undzere palazene vi shlekht va
     fayerve.  Ikh ken nit aroysgeyn in gas vintertsayt...

Translation: It isn't so appropriate for me to describe how bad our
situation is. First of all, I cannot go outside during the winter.

Subject:  definite article before names

Is the definite article ever used with people's names, perhaps in informal
colloquial speech?  For example, can one say, "Di Ester iz gegangen in shul
mit der Soren"?  If so, does this apply to both men's and women's names
("Der Moyshe iz gegangen in shul mit dem Yankevn")?  I know this is done in
German (for example, in the operetta "Der Fledermaus," the character Ida is
sometimes referred to as "die Ida") and I suspect in other languages too,
but is it done in Yiddish?

Subject: farheltenishmesik

Can anyone tell me what "farelt(e)nishmesik" means? It occurs in a yisker
book for the town of Goworowo, Poland in the following contexts:

1) In farloyf fun der poylisher hershaft biz tsum letstn krigs-oysbrukh iz
dos lebn in shtetl geflosn fareltnishmesik ruik.

2) Di fareltenishmesik nisht shlekhte virtshaftlekhe lage hot gehat ir
opshpiglung in der gaystiker un kultureler antviklung fun shtetl.

Martin Jacobs

[Moderator's note:  Martin Jacobs seems to mean here "farheltenishmesik,"
meaning "relatively."]

Subject: Yiddish textbook for Swedish speakers

In reply to the query below from Patrik Nilsson:

Patrik, you can obtain a book for learning Yiddish for Swedish speakers
that uses the YIVO orthography from the publisher MEGILLA-FORLAGET at
Bjornsonsgatan 335, 168 44 Bromma, Stockholm 2000; Tel: 08-37 31 49.  Ask
for Lennart Kerbel, or email info@megilla.a.se

The book is called in Swedish JIDDISCH 2000: LAROBOK FOR ALLA (ISBN #
91-89340-07-8). It is an adaptation and translation of the book I
co-authored called in English, LEARNING YIDDISH IN EASY STAGES, currently
being published and distributed by The National Yiddish Book Center in
Amherst, Mass., USA.

Good luck in your desire to learn Yiddish,

Marvin Zuckerman

Subject: Yiddish for beginners

The best book for a beginner in Yiddish which slowly, friendly but firmly,
leads you into the language is Sheva Zucker's "Yiddish" I and II.  My
students love it. She uses both YIVO transliteration and the Yiddish
alphabet. The book is also a source of Yiddish culture. A set of CDs,
beautifully done, is available, which helps a lot. All this is being sold
at

    League for Yiddish, Inc.
    45 E. 33rd Street #203
    New York, NY 10016 USA

Email:   store@leagueforyiddish.org

Good luck!
