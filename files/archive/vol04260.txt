Subject: Copyright

I have been told by someone in whose judgement I have faith that
(notwithstanding any copyright messages) any message received on email is
yours to treat in any way you want, to share with anyone you want.

Internet law is decades (figuratively) behind the technology, so while I
can understand that it may be a legal offence to broadcast copyrighted
material on email, say,from a book or CDROM disk, there is such little
regulation of email that basically, with few exceptions, anything
goes....

Subject: "Lehavdl" words

In several recent Mendele postings Abe Bloom (4.248), Harvey Spiro
(4.254), and Mendy Fliegler (4.256) discussed the meaning of _khoge_ as
designating a non-Jewish holiday.

_Khoge_ and _tifle_ (see below) are both "Lehavdl" words.

"Lehavdl" is a Hebrew word that entered in the Yiddish vocabulary with
its exact same meaning:  to differentiate, to distinguish between the
sacred and the profane.

It is a verb related to the noun *havdo'le,* the pensive domestic
ceremony to usher out the departing Sabbath and to separate its holiness
from the this-worldly weekdays.

If one brings up in a conversation a great Jewish religious leader
contiguously with the head of the Christian church, the traditional
linguistic usage calls for an immediate "lehavdl."

Similarly, if one mentions in the same breath the name of a deceased and
a living person, the prompt interposing of a "lehavdl" is obligatory .

The intent of "lehavdl" also entered as a differentiating linguistic
device to draw a distinct demarcation line between what is _ours_ (Jews)
and what is _theirs_ (Non-Jews).  Thus, "khag" is ours [khag someyakh --
a freylekher yontef] and "khoge" is theirs.

May I share with you a personal experience from my childhood:

When I was about 9 -10 years old I was sent away to study in Telzsh in a
*mekhine* -- a preparatory school for the entrance into the famous
Telzsher yeshive.

Although of tender age, I became a beneficiary of the tradition of "esn
teg" (to eat "days"), the custom of families obligating themselves to
serve three daily meals one week a day to grown-up yeshive students.

On my way to my Sunday "day" I had to pass each time the great church on
the hill.  I knew that in Yiddish it was called a "tifle."  In my
childish and "learned" mind I tried to figure out why it was called
"tifle,"  and I came to the conclusion that it was a deliberate
transposition of "tfile" (Jewish prayer), a purposively wrong pronouncing
for the sake of a derogatory connotation.

Imbued early on with the idea that Jews are the "chosen people," I
thought to myself that our tFiles go up straight to the Almighty, while
their prayers are a mere distortion of the real thing, and thus but
tiFles.

This, I believe, is an excellent illustration of folk etymology, how
people unsophisticated in the science of language come up with their own
explanations in an effort to satisfy their search for meaning.

Subject: fershtot

To Refoel Finkel:

While _forshtot_ means 'suburb', there was a specific part of Grodne that
Jews referred to as _fershtot_, with an /e/.  I do not know the
geographic details about it, but a native of Grodne surely would and a
Yiddish book on Grodne would probably be instructive.  (What good sources
are there on Grodne?  Books on Jewish Vilne abound [relatively speaking],
but what, dear librarians, are the sources on Grodne?)

If you do any digging into the matter, please share your results with us.
It would also be interesting to know whether this area has/had a special
Slavic name as well. I have never heard it referred to as anything but
_fershtot_, but I've only discussed Grodne with speakers of Yiddish.
(Maybe I'll have a chance to be in touch with a Grodner acquaintance of
mine soon, at which time I'll provide whatever info I can.)

_fer_ is apparently one of the older forms of the prefix _for_ mentioned
by Perl Teitelbaum and was retained in this place name.  There's an
interesting article on the prefix by Mordkhe Schaechter in a 1970s (?)
volume of the YIVO publication _Yidishe shprakh_.  Schaechter also deals
with it, more prescriptively than descriptively, in a subchapter in his
book _Layitsh mame-loshn_. Among the forms it has or had are /fer, for,
fur, foyr, fir/, depending on time and place.

The original Yiddish prefix became unproductive, only remaining in
fossils (such as _fershtot_) and became unanalyzable (at least to some
speakers).  My grandmother, alvisholem, was from the Grodne area and
visited Grodne (and possibly the Fershtot area).  I once asked her why it
was called _fershtot_, to which she had no answer -- i.e. she did not
associate the name _fershtot_ with the word _forshtot_ 'suburb' and told
me that, as far as she knew, _fershtot_ could only be used for that part
of Grodne, not for ANY suburb.

The other _fir_-fossil that was current in her speech was _firhoyz_
'foyer'.  Etymologically it is obviously _fir_ 'front, anterior' + _hoyz_
'house'.  Checking its analyzability/fossilhood with her on this point
too, I asked her why it's called a _firhoyz_. Her answer (recall that
Grodner Yiddish is an /h/-less dialect):  "vayle se firt oys".  A nice
folk etymology.
