Subject: Reviews of _Jews Without Money_

On behalf of Tony Michels (Stanford University), I would like to ask if
anyone knows of reviews of Michael Gold's _Jews Without Money_ that
appeared in Yiddish, other than those in the Freiheit.

Subject: _Oyf_ as preposition and prefix

Further to my post __Af_ the correct romanization_ (6.074,4), I hasten
to add that a clear distinction must be drawn between the preposition
_oyf,_ romanized  _af_, and the prefix _oyf-_ as in oyfklaybn [gather,
collect], oyfklern [clarify], oyfrufn [call up], oyfshteyn [get up],
oyfton [accomplish], and so on.

As a _prefix_ oyf- is pronounced _as spelled_ and is not changed to _af_
as when it is a preposition.  This spelling pronunciation of _oyf- _is
recommended by Uriel Weinreich in his _College Yiddish_ and in his
_Modern Yiddish-English/English-Yiddish Dictionary_.

However, in _Yiddish Tsvey_ Mordkhe Schaechter recommends that the
prefix _oyf-_ be pronounced as /uf/, for instance _oyfheybn_ [to lift,
raise] read _ufheybn.

Thus, as a preposition _oyf_ is read, pronounced, and romanized _af;_
but as a prefix, _oyf-_ is read and pronounced as spelled or as /uf/.

Subject: Af un oyf

always thankful for the learned lectures of Zellig Bach, so this one
concerning the pronounciation and romanization of the preposition _oyf =
af_, but wouldn`t it be reasonable to add another warning: not to
generalize from oyf-af to the verbs starting with the prefix _oyf_?

Subject: Yiddish on WEVD

I recently spoke to Barney Zumoff of the Forward Association regarding
my earier posting about the cutting of Yiddish radio programming on WEVD
in New York.  Mr. Zumoff informed me that not all of the Yiddish
programs are in danger at this time.  At this time, the Forward
Association is considering eliminating 15 minutes of Sunday morning
Yiddish programming.

I tried to be as clear as I could in my posting that the information
about programming cuts had not been officially confirmed by the Forward
Association.  My intent was only to show the extent of support and
interest for Yiddish programming and not to spread false information.  I
most heartily apologize to Mr. Zumoff and the Forward Association.

Nevertheless there was positive feedback from my posting.  Certainly as
a Yiddish activist it is moving to see how many of us are affected by
the important Yiddish language services provided by organizations like
WEVD, the Yiddish Forverts, Living Traditions, Yugntruf, etc.  We are in
a symbiotic relationship.  It is important that the  the Yiddish
enthusiast community provide these organizations with feedback so that
they will not do their work in a vacuum.

A gutn moyd!

Somewhere in the Rube Goldberg arrangement that connects us all,
a break has occurred.  I had just caught a glimpse of some incoming
posts when Trinity's (or somebody's) machine went down..and farfaln!

So if you don't see one of your messages in the next day or so, please
send it again.
