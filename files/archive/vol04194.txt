Subject: Mendelniks at the lsa?

this won't do for a mendelnik convention, obviously, but how many of you
will be at the lsa meeting in new orleans this january? if more than one,
perhaps we could have our second annual mendelnik-lunch-at-the-lsa?

Subject: Peretz's "Frume kats"

To answer, albeit briefly, Moishe Feller's question about Peretz's "Frume
kats": the story has generally been read as a not-so-sutle attack on the
hypocrisy of Jewish orthodoxy, indeed, of religious orthodoxy in general.
For this reason, it was one of the most commonly anthologized Peretz
stories in the Soviet Union. By the way, in general with Peretz, his
stories are rarely just "stam mayses." While they're rarely allegories
strictly speaking, there's frequently a "shpits," typically located in
the last lines.

So break your head and enjoy!

Subject: Tsvi Schooler

Re: Harvey Spiro's queries:

I also have fond memories of hearing Tsvi Schooler's raspy greeting "A
hartsikn gut-morgn aykh!" every day on WEVD in New York in the 1960s and
70s just before he would read the news in Yiddish.

I don't know about his publications, but Harvey or others may be
interested in knowing that Schooler was interviewed on camera about his
film career (he played "Charlie the Marxist" in the 1932 film version of
_Uncle Moses_) in the documentary on Yiddish movies, _Almonds and
Raisins_ (c. 1980, narrated by Orson Welles).  Those in the Washington,
D.C. area can find the film in the library of the BJE (Board of Jewish
Education) in Rockville, Maryland [tel. (301) 984-1611].  It's also
available for purchase from ERGO Media in New York.

Subject: Zamenhof and Yiddish

In Mendele Vol. 4.183, Zellig Bach points out Zamenhof's plea for a
consistent Yiddish orthography based on the phonology of Yiddish. It is
true that he states "there is no basis for writing ... double consonants,
the letter 'h', etc., only because these words are so written in German."
Yet, Zamenhof had an absolute terror of homonymy (his Esperanto avoided
all instances of homonymy). For this reason he did propose such spellings
as:

lehben   to live        vs.    leben   near
mehl     flour                 melen   draw
nehmen   take                  nemen   names
nohkh    still                 nokh    after
ohrem    arm                   orem    poor
vehgen   weigh                 vegn    about
vell     wave                  velen   want
zunn     sun                   zun     son

Incidentally, the Zamenhof Yiddish grammar is a fascinating and important
work. It has been published by Adolf Holzhaus: L. Zamenhof, Provo de
gramatiko de novjuda lingvo kaj Alvoko al la juda intelektularo,
published in 1982 by the Fondumo Esperanto (Helsinki). This volume
contains the original Russian text from 1879-1882 along with an Esperanto
translation.
