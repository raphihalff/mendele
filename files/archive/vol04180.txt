Subject: Introduction

I am a Klezmer musician.  I play guitar, mandolin, and tenor banjo, and I
sing in  Yiddish and English as well.  I play with the Klezmer Conser-
vatory Band, the Lipovsky/Mlotek/Warschauer Trio (mostly in Europe), and
the Jeff Warschauer Klezmer Ensemble.  I also teach at KlezKamp and
Buffalo on the Roof, etc... My Yiddish language skills are at what you
might call an intermediate level-I took one semester when I was at
school, and did one summer of the Oxford Programme.  Since then, I have
tried to improve my Yiddish by attending meetings of a Yiddish club that
meets at a senior citizen's center here in Boston, thought lately I have
not been able to do that as much as I would like.  It is really great to
see so many familiar names here on Mendele.  If I had known, I'd have
been here sooner...

Subject: Eve Sicular's address

Eve Sicular is YIVO's curator of photographs and films.  She can be
reached by snail-mail (c/o YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, 555 West
57th St., 11th Floor, New York, NY 10019), phone (212/ 535-6700), and fax
(212/734-1062) -- but NOT by e-mail (at least not directly).  I gather
that the issue of "Jewish Folklore and Ethnology News" to which she
referred is due out imminently, if not sooner.  N.b.  "JFEN" is no longer
co-published by YIVO.  The editor, Prof. Guy Haskell, is at Oberlin
College (address not handy at the moment).

As previously announced, the YIVO Library will be reopening on Monday,
November 14th.  In addition, the YIVO Archives will reopen the following
Monday, November 21st.  No appointment is necessary to use the Library,
but an appointment is now required to use the Archives.  We are still
working on ways to retrieve materials from the warehouse; until that
matter is resolved, however, only those library and archival materials
that are on premises at 57th Street will be available to readers.

Subject: Identifying French Jews as Jews

In connection with this discussion, it may be worth noting that the
monument to the "deportees" of the second world war (on the Ile de la
Cite just in back of Notre Dame) never finds it worth mentioning that the
deportees were mostly Jews. On the right bank not far away is a monument
specifically to the Jewish victims of the Nazis. However, while the first
is an official government sponsored facility, the second is strictly
under Jewish auspices.

Subject: P-rk

In the wonderful film "The Last Klezmer", I heard the subject of this
cinematic biography, Leopold Kleinman/Kozlowski, when speaking about
various animals stolen at night for sustenance by Jews in the Hanaczow
forest refer in Yiddish to pigs as "Schwein".  I have never heard other
than "Khazir" for this animal in Yiddish.  Anyone?

(This film, by the way, in Yiddish, Ukranian, and Polish, subtitled, is
also great fun for those with a linguistic bent.)

Subject: Romanization, Yivo-Style

I would like to thank Shleyme Axelrod for the Romanization List and
Information he posted on Nov. 6th.

I copied it post haste, and will use it as a reference to reinforce the
info from Zellig Bach, and some other friends I have made on Mendele.

The List will not only help in learning to write yidish correctly, but to
more easily understand some of the wonderful array of questions, jokes
and stories written in yidish by some of the Mendelniks.

Thank you again.

Subject: Di etimologie fun "Shprintse"

In a recent review (3/94 issue of "Names") the Yiddish linguist Dovid
Katz excoriates a non-scholarly book called "Jewish Personal Names" by
Shmuel Gorr.  In the course of this review Katz quotes an admittedly
incoherent paragraph by Gorr, which states that the Yiddish name
"Sprintse" means "Hope".  Katz treats this as a ridiculous assertion,
claiming that it comes from a Middle High German name, "Sprinz", meaning
a female sparrow hawk.

Isn't "Hope" the usually accepted (but perhaps incorrect) etymology of
this name, from the Spanish Esperanza, via Ladino?  It makes a lot more
sense to me that Jews would name a daughter "Hope", something that we've
needed through the ages and had in abundance, than after a treyfe bird of
prey! Ober, gey veys.

Harkavy has "hope", and I'm sure that I've seen this explanation
elsewhere--looked in "College Yiddish", but in vain.  Does anyone know of
other references on this question? Is it Hope or Sparrow Hawk?

Subject: Mendele-on-disk: a correction

A brokh! The announcement in Vol. 4.176 was an early draft and wrong in
one respect.  Mac users _will_ also have an uncompress utility included
with their disks thanks to Khayem Bochner and Meyer David.
