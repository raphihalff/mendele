Subject: A word or two from Nachman Meisel

Nachman Meisel, sometimes spelled Mayzel (1887-1966) wrote a book on Peretz
(Perets, zayn lebn un shafn, New York: IKUF, 1945).  He also wrote many essays
about Yiddish writers including both literary criticism and biographical
sketches.  Among experiences qualifying him for such assignments, he was
editor of Yidishe Kultur from 1939 on.  He remained editor until 1964. 

Chaim Grade (who died in 1982) was born in 1910 according to Encyclopedia
Judaica, or 1912, according to Meisel.  In 1945, while Chaim Grade was still a
young man, Meisel, who was 23 or 25 years older than his subject, wrote an
appreciative personal memoir about him which appeared in Forgeyer un
Mittsaytler (Predecessors and Contemporaries), by Nachman Meisel, New York: 
Yidisher Kultur Farband, 1946, pp. 408-423. 

The essay is written in excellent Yiddish.  The language is modern, clear,
sophisticated and accessible without a German dictionary. A pleasure! 
Moreover, it adheres to YIVO orthography by and large. 

I plan to contribute a review of some of the highlights at a later date. 
Today I'll focus on a word used by Meisel not found in any source I consulted. 
I don't know if he invented it, or if it was in general usage in his circle. 
The word is spelled beyz alef yod komets-alef ayen reysh.  From the context
it's meaning is clear, and its pronunciation is probably ba-yo'er.  That is, a
yea-sayer, one who supports, cheers on, encourages; the opposite of a nay-
sayer (a farneyner, according to Meisel).  I have found ba- yo'er in two of
Meisel's essays. 

Meisel describes himself as an optimistic ba-yo'er compared to Grade the
pessimistic farneyner. 

Has anyone else encountered these terms elsewhere?

Subject: The New YIVO

I wish we could turn back the clock to the letter from YIVO where
Freudenheim's name was printed upset down - a pure, human mistake while an
organization is being revamped. 

Today I received a letter from YIVO in an envelope that would be a graphic
artist's dream, adorned with pictures of people learning, studying, in tones
of mauve with a bold blue banner across, "Yiddish Has Magic - It Will Outlive
History".  They got my attention. 

I opened the envelope. The letter within started: Dear Friend, "Yiddish has
magic. It will outwit history."  They went on to say it was a quote from Max
Weinreich. 

I teach my students that YIVO is our Yiddish Library of Congress, the
preeminent institution for our Eastern European culture, an instituton to be
revered and treasured. 

I think we deserve that they at least hire an adequate proof reader, worthy of
the awe we feel at the name YIVO, worthy of our work for Yiddish continuity.

Subject: Maps in Yiddish

Miriam Isaacs requested info on maps in Yiddish.  This is an interesting
issue. 

1.  First, there are, of course, maps in Yiddish which essentially reflect
non-specifically Jewish geography, such as in Y. Kadushin (1922) 
*Geografisher atlas* [Yiddish version edited by H. Abramovitsh, A. Y. 
Goldshmidt, and Y. Zavels.] Vilne: Tsentrale yidishe shul-organizatsye. (YIVO
library has a copy).  The maps in this atlas are essentially identical to
those found in any school atlas of that time, in the Jewish or non-Jewish
world, except that these maps happen to be in Yiddish. (This in itself is not
unimportant; however, it is another issue.) 

2.  Vilenkin's (1931) *Yidisher shprakhatles fun sovetnfarband...* contains 74
linguistic maps where place names are in Latin letters.  However, there is
also present a base map (map 75) in Yiddish orthography.  Still, however, the
question remains of the "Jewishness" of map 75 in the Max Weinreichian sense,
i.e., does this map reflect--in size of lettering/prominence of given
locations--*Jewish* or *general* demographics, relative cultural importance,
etc.

Subject: Yiddish influences in American culture

Two examples of Yiddish influences in very different corners of the American
cultural arena have come to my attention recently. 

1)  My wife's son has reached an age (16) where he is methodically going
through my vinyl LP collection, especially the jazz.  Not having listened to
some of these in many years, I had completely forgotten about reed player
Yusef Lateef's treatment of "Rozhinkes mit mandlen" as a free-time ballad for
solo flute.  Called "Raisins and Almonds," it appeared on the album _Jazz
'Round the World_ (Impulse A-56), recorded in December 1963.  The liner notes,
by Joel Dorn, comment that Lateef does not take a "Ziggy Elman _frielach_
[sic] approach,"  but rather "adapts [it] to the jazz idiom in the same manner
as would . . . an Israeli."  Dorn is identified by his association with a
Philadelphia radio station (WHAT-FM), and was probably making his observations
at the beginning of 1964.  I find myself wondering what he meant.  It's
possible that his point is very interesting, depending on what it is!  There
is, of course, a glaring typo:  Dorn left out the final 's.' It should be
_frielachs_.  Should one suppose he pronounced it "FREE lox"?  (A nekhtiger
tog!) 

2)  In "Sinatra's Song," John Lahr's long and compelling profile of the
popular vocalist (_The New Yorker_, 3 November 1997), more than a little
attention is paid to the character and formidable influence of Dolly Sinatra,
the tough lady with "a stevedore's heart and mouth" who in 1915 gave birth to
the future singer in working-class Hoboken, New Jersey.  She was, writes Lahr,
"a typical Italian _balabusta_."  I was enchanted by the spelling, and
thankful for the italics.  Lahr stresses, incidentally, that the late Sammy
Cahn, well-known to Mendelistn as a collaborator on the English-language swing
version of _Bay mir bistu sheyn_ (Sholem Secunda-Jacob Jacobs), is regarded by
those close to Frank Sinatra as that singer's definitive lyricist.

Subject: Yiddish in Detective Fiction

Heynekh Sapoznik raises the issue of Yiddish usage in detective fiction
[7.126].  I recently ran across a different kind of example, not in a novel,
but in a film written by Raymond Chandler. 

The 1946 Paramount film _The Blue Dahlia_, released on video in 1996, opens as
a bus marked "Hollywood" pulls to a stop.  Out spill several passengers,
including some GIs and two good-looking guys in suits.  A third man, a little
older, is with the other two, though he looks tougher in his leather bomber
jacket.  He is played by a fortyish William Bendix, an actor who later became
indelibly (and lovably) associated with his eponymous working-class character
in _Life of Riley_, the early television series (and radio before that?).  In
the movie, however, no sooner is Bendix out of the bus than he sees a tavern
and excitedly blurts out his first line, which in fact constitutes the
picture's first spoken words:  "Give a look!" 

That expression's appearance in English is imported from Yiddish _gib a kuk_,
is it not?  Leo Rosten somewhere offers the opinion that it is, I believe, but
I also believe he hasn't anything more to support his claim than I do, i.e.,
guessing. 

Produced by John Houseman (who was born in Rumania and whose father was
Alsatian, but I don't know what they spoke at home), the film was originally
released amid some fanfare, proudly touted as the first original screenplay by
Chandler.  A version of the screenplay has been published, edited and with an
afterword by Matthew J. Bruccoli (Carbondale, Illinois:  Southern Illinois
University Press, 1976), but "Give a look" is not the opening line.  Neither
does it appear anywhere else in the published script, though it does reoccur
later in the film itself, as I recall.  It would be fascinating to learn how
the line crept into the production.  One's impression of how the
Yiddish-inflected words could have originated in the mouth of Bendix, whom
most viewers associate with the big-boned Irishman he later played on
television, may be subject to revision once one learns that the actor himself
was the son of Max Bendix, improbably enough a former Concertmaster of the
Metropolitan Opera orchestra and a published composer of violin concert
miniatures.  Other references to Yiddish in the film are more tenuous, and to
elucidate them it's necessary to look a moment at the cast and story line. 

Bendix's two friends are played by Alan Ladd and Hugh Beaumont.  Beaumont
later achieved modest fame as the father on _Leave It to Beaver_; there is no
Yiddish content there as far as I can see.  Ladd, meanwhile, plays the hero
with a romantic interest in Veronica Lake (the bad-guy night-club-owner's
girl), a relationship they were busily recapitulating in a series of _noir_
films through the 1940s.  His specialty was not saying much and acting hurt. 
I know the reader is here certain that I will be arguing that the Yiddish
connection lies in Ladd's later appearance in the 1953 Western classic,
_Shane_, after the novel by Jack Schaefer.  That, however, seems a stretch --
even to me -- though I leave it to the ever-feisty linguists among our
Mendelistn to thrash that one out.  (It was, by the way, just a month ago that
Saul Chaplin passed away; he was, of course, the last of the several
collaborators on the English-language swing version of _Bay mir bistu sheyn_.) 

In the case of "The Blue Dahlia," Ladd was hurt by his no-good wife.  She's
been seeing Lake's good-for-nothing night-club-owner husband while he (Ladd),
Bendix, and Beaumont were off fighting in the South Pacific.  Ladd is coming
home unannounced -- he just got off the bus, remember -- and as he approaches
his apartment, we (and he) hear loud music.  His two-timing wife is having a
wild party.  On a sound track, this is called "source music":  music the
characters within the narrative hear themselves.  (The Music Director on the
film, by the way, was Victor Young.  Though born in Chicago, he was a graduate
of a Warsaw conservatory and had begun his career as a concert violinist.) 
The song that is heard emerging from the party is an instrumental version of
the Harold Arlen-Johnny Mercer standard, "Ac-Cen-Tchu-Ate the Positive." 
Arlen (originally Arluck) was the son of a khazn, a khazn who was to later
unashamedly brag that he he'd interpolated his famous son's music into the
liturgy -- and it will come as no surprise that the famous son's formative
musical training had been as that of a _meshoyrer_ (choirboy) under his
father's tutelage.  I say it will come as no surprise, for what is
"Ac-Cen-Tchu-Ate the Positive" but an elegant gloss on Rambam's famous
enumeration of the _tarya'g mitsves_ (613 commandments). 

        ...You've gotta:
        Ac-cen-tchu-ate the positive,
        E-lim-in-ate the negative,
        Latch on to the affirmative,
        And don't mess with Mr. In-Between.

Subject: editorial grouping

I strongly disagree with Martin Horwitz's appeal [7.126] to group Mendele
posts according to thematic content (originally suggested by Ellen Prince
[7.122]), which he justifies in terms of a "large number of posts which are
very similar and do not add mew [sic] information."  I have been a little
troubled by such occasional groupings lately as it is. What may not appear as
new to some may hold keys to new questions for others. Horwitz is not, I
emphasize, merely talking about spatial arrangements -- placing
subject-related posts in sequential proximity -- but actually abridging
material, for if he were not suggesting editorial deletions, how else could
his plan save the downloading time he speaks of?

I know that Mendele is moderated, and thus subject to a significant measure of
redaction, but I would much prefer to keep the data closer to its original
state.  Besides, why should we impose the additional responsibility on our
shames?  Hasn't he enough to do? 

Further, I would miss headers we are accustomed to, giving not only the
sender's address and subject, but the date and time. Again, what is
insignificant to some may be significant to others. When certain posts were
transmitted can sometimes be revealing in terms of seeing how collective ideas
develop among our group.  If Horwitz is not speaking of deleting even the
headers, then truly, how is he intending on saving downloading time?  My modem
is three years old -- medieval (if not ancient)  by Internet standards -- and
I do not find the current download time to be a burden.

Lastly, what can Horwitz possibly mean by "topics which may not be of general
interest"?  Can this mean Gilbert and Sullivan in Yiddish -- which I offer
only for the sake of this argument -- but not the nuts and bolts of the
history of the language?  Or did he mean etymological issues are the ones of
general interest, but words to radio commercials are not?  By its very nature
our list presupposes that nothing is general and everything is. 

Please, shames, we are individually capable at least of determining what is of
interest to ourselves. 

On the other hand . . . if we are going to be self-regulating, perhaps this is
a good place to remind Mendelistn to use not only a meaningful subject line,
but to confine themselves to one subject per post (just, regrettably, as I am
not doing at this moment) so that the Archives can be usefully indexed.  If
you have more than one thing to say, send another post.  Or two more.  Or
three.  The Internet is a big place.

Subject: Professors of Yiddish

I recently have seen reference made to the American Association of Professors
of Yiddish.  It would be of interest to know how many professors there are in
this organiztion.  Of further interest would be the names of the institutions
where they are teaching.

Subject: gendzl

In reply to Heynekh Sapoznick's question about "gunsel" in Dashiel Hammet's
"Maltese Falcon": the probable (but not certain) etymon of this word is the
Yiddish "gendzl" "gosling. It's first attested in a 1918 dictionary of
American prison slang, and refers to the *receptive* partner, usually younger,
in a male-male sexual relationship.  It was also well known among hobos.  The
older, insertive partner was known as a "jocker," "wolf," or "prushyun."

Subject: The other side of Bronfn

Following up on the recent discussion regarding "bronfn", I've wondered for
some time about Yiddish words to describe drinking in general. In translating
my grandfather's memoirs, I noticed that his accounts of holiday celebrations
in his Lithuanian heymshtot included what we might consider a pronounced
popular fondness for alcohol. (I'd be happy to provide examples on demand.)
Especially given what I always heard about how Jews only drank in moderation,
if at all ...

In one essay I found the following terms, all referring to either the act or
the state of inebration: 

ontrinkn zikh
bgilufn
bazoyfn
farshikert
onshikern
ongeshnosket

Can anyone help me define their various nuances more precisely, and/or add to
the list? And does anyone agree that, just like the Eskimos' 26 (or whatever)
terms for snow, this multiplicity of terms suggests a greater familiarity with
the phenomenon than we've been led to believe was common?
