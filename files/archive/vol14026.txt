Subject: Re: etymology of berye

In response to Jack Berger's letter [Mendele 14.025]:

This hypothesis is is completely illogical. Even the word "barii" is a
non-existent one. The Russian (Slavic) for lordly (but not in the sense of a
"berye, a gerotene") is "barskiy". Absolutely no correlation in meaning.

Berye means somebody like this: she manages to raise the kids, keep the house
with a meager salary and despite shortages of everything, work in an office,
dress well, bribe the official to get her kid in a better school etc. That was
my aunt, a well known berye. "Barskiy" has a connotation of "lazy, born with a
silver spoon in his mouth". No way.

Subject: Paris Yiddish theater

While doing other research in Paris I discovered that there was no history of
the Yiddish theater in Paris so that I started to interview former
participants and embarked on a history, 1920- 1970. So far I have compiled a
chronology, a list of participants, a bibliography, and am in the process of
writing. I would be pleased to be in contact with others who might have
similar interests, who can suggest leads, etc.

Subject: Non-idealized Yiddish

As much as a "layperson" can judge, I find Ewa Geller's article [TMR 8.012] to
be wonderful and extremely true. I was totally not surprised by the fact, that
only a native Polish speaker could truly make sense of a survivor's testimony.
Ms. Geller's observation about the interviewee and interviewer speaking
different languages is also very keen. It has triggered some memories,
fortunately, of an amusing, rather than tragic nature: in the late 80s, just
"off the boat", after suffering through the oppressive heat of our first
summer in New York, our  extended family pitched in, and next summer rented a
tiny onebedroom in a bungalow colony in the Catskills - "tsulib di kinder".
The plan was for my mother-in-law to stay there during the week with the
grandchildren, and we, the parents, would come on weekends. The owner assured
us, that many of the bungalows are occupied by elderly "Floridians", who speak
Yiddish, thus, providing my non-English-speaking mother-in-law with some
support system. And indeed, during the very first week, she made some
acquaintances, and especially befriended one neighbor, who was considered a
Yiddish maven. Over the weekend I was privileged to meet her. Here is, more or
less, how I remember the conversation between my mother-in-law (MIL) and the
neighbor (N).

...

MIL: O, froy Vernik iz do. Kumt, kumt arain, froy Vernik. S'iz take heys,
efsher vilt ir a gloz mineralke?

N: Vus?

MIL: (opens the refrigerator and points) Mineral'ne vaser.

N: Neyn, adank dir, s'mir vert heartburn fun seltzer.

MIL: Vos?

N: (points to her chest) Es brent afn hartzn.

MIL:  A... nu dan keyn marantz zaft avade vilt ir nit.

N: Vus?

MIL: (points) Apel'sin zaft.

N: Un ken ice tea hostu nit?

MIL: Vos?

N: (after some thinking)  Ken farayziktn tey.

MIL: Neyn, ot dos hob ikh nit. Zetsekh, zetsekh. Zetsekh dortn afn kushetke,
di taburetke iz umbakvem.

N: S'iz ba dir azoy zoyber. Un ikh khob shem nit ken keyekh tsu shlepn dem
vacuum.

MIL: Mikh nervirt ober der remont in dem tsimer, di greyse blumen af di vent.
My Lyovin'ke hot gevolt dos fardekn mit oboyen, ober ver veys, tsi mir veln do
kumen iberayor.

N: (not sure of the meaning switches conversation): Vus makhstu, lunch?

MIL: Varemes far di kinder, blinchikes.

N: Makhst fun scratch?

MIL: Vos?
...

And so it goes: with pointing, pausing, gesticulating and various facial
expressions. But when in the fall the Floridians indeed leave for Florida, the
very first phone conversation stumbles. After initial greeting and a couple of
minutes on the phone my mother-in-law calls out to me in frustration:
"Lyubin'ke, kum, herzikh ayn vos zogt tsi. Es dakhtsekh az ir Lui iz krank."
Turns out, that what she was saying, is that "Lui matertzikh vayle di
dentures scratchen em di gumen, ober der specialist zogt az vet dos
adjustn"...

Also notice, that MIL uses the polite plural "ir", where the N is using "du",
same way she would use "you". And their accents are very different. But, aside
from academic circles, this is the only Yiddish that is out there. And, with
the imminent crossing of both of these distinguished older ladies onto the
other side, even this will be gone: "di kinderlakh" , for whom the
"blinchikes" were being prepared fun "scratch", don't speak a word of Yiddish.

Happy New Year!

Subject: zhote

I recently transcribed a song for my book: "A Wandering Feast: A Journey
Through the Jewish Culutre of Eastern Europe" called "Malke Zhote". I
collected the song in Velki Kapusany, a small town south of Kosice in
Slovakia. Can anyone  tell me what "zhote" means. The song's lyrics are: Malke
Zhote, es tut in hartsn brenen! Malke Zhote, loz zhe zikh derkenen. Malke
Zhote, Ikh ken on dir nisht zayn! Ikh tsu dir, du tsu mir, lomir tantsn ale
fir.
