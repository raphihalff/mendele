zaynen etlekhe klolem.

If you want to use the Yiddish Typewriter or enter text for MENDELE according
to the YIVO transcription, here are some guidelines.

Yivo transcription format uses the following consonants:

	b g d h v z kh t y l m n s f p ts k r sh tsh zh dj

and the following vowels:

	a e i o u oy ay ey

In particular, don't use "tz" for tsadik; use "ts".  Don't use "j" for 
a yud (as in German) or as a khof (as in Spanish).  The combinations "ay" and  
"ey" and "oy" should not be replaced by such forms as "aj" and "ei". 
Don't use capital letters except for the first letters of Hebrew proper names
(like Refoyl and Binyomen).

You can use the | character as a nonprinting character to circumvent usual
orthography rules. For instance, write "oys|heyln" instead of "oysheyln" to
avoid the "sh" turning into a shin; write "elt|stn" instead of "eltstn" to
avoid the "ts" turning into a tsadik.  It is not necessary to say "t|sh" when
you mean "tsh".  If you really need a vov at the start of a word, you can use
"|u".   

If you want a compound built on a Hebrew root, separate the Hebrew root
from prefixes and suffixes by |.  For instance, "farkholemt" should be
written "far|kholem|t" so that the Hebrew lookup succeeds.  Many Yiddish verbs
from Hebrew have an extra "en", as in "harg|enen" and "ganv|enen".  Even though
the words "*harg" and "*ganv" don't exist, use these pseudo-roots as in the
previous sentence.

If you have a number, write it forwards (1997, not 7991).  This rule also
holds for numbers with embedded punctuation, all of which is treated as a
region of left-to-right text within the normal right-to-left rendition of
Yiddish (such as 5-17-1997).

If you need a Hebrew word, spell it phonetically.  Unaccented vowels often
should be spelled with an "e", as in "borekh", "bimkem", "maskem". If the
spelling checker accepts your input, it should be spelled fine in the
output.  If you have misspelled slightly, the spelling checker will suggest a
substitute.  Otherwise, mail will be sent to the maintainer, and the word
should appear shortly on the spelling list.  If you need Hebrew before then,
or if the word you want is unlikely to be used in standard Yiddish texts
(such as Biblical quotations), you may use the following letters:

	aleph	#
	veys	B
	khes	H
	kof 	K
	ayin	e
	sin 	Q
	sof 	T
	tof 	W

If you are using the Yiddish Typewriter, then you can insert TeX commands to
control the output somewhat.  These commands must be on lines by themselves;
they all use the \ character, and any line with one of those characters is
not processed by the other software.

Here are some of the available TeX commands:
	(1) To change font: \font{n}
	where "font" can be any of these:
		jerusalem (handsome angular line form)
		deadsea (standard book form)
		calig (nice calligraphic form)
		frank (somewhat blocky book form)
		telaviv (OK thick line form)
		classic (ugly prayer-book form)
		oldjaffa (ugly thin line form)
	and "n" is the size.  You can currently use 1000, 1500, or 2000.

	(2) English inserts should be on lines by themselves, surrounded by
	\english{}.

	(3) You can force a new line by \\ and a new paragraph by inserting
	a blank line.

The Yiddish Typewriter gives you options for output style.

If you ask it to check your spelling, it will compare each word with a
spelling list.  The list currently contains about 8,000 words, counting all
grammatical forms as separate words.  This list has been assembled by hand.
In the future, I hope to generate it from roots using morphological rules
appropriate to Yiddish.  Then all forms of each word will be represented.  As
it stands, you will often find words flagged as misspelled that are just
unusual forms of words that are already known. For instance, "farzikhert" is
in the list, but "farzikherte" (an adjective meaning "insured" in the plural
form) is not (yet).

Most users first check their spelling and then ask for a GIF image.  The
result will show on your web browser, but won't be particularly high
quality.  It is a picture of a fairly low-resolution rendering of the text
you have specified.

PostScript gives you a much higher quality image.  But to see it, you either
need a PostScript viewer (standard on Unix, available via a link on the
Typewriter web page for PCs) or a PostScript printer (more expensive than
usual printers).

If you have the Hebrew Language Option for either Macintosh or MS-Word, you
can select one of those output forms and see your text in whatever font you
have loaded.  Unfortunately, I don't know of any fonts for these platforms
that contain all the Yiddish symbols (such as pasakh-tsvey-yud), so you might
not be satisfied with the results.  Complain to your font manufacturer.

If your browser supports Unicode with the full bidirectional algorithm and
Hebrew/Yiddish font (only the Tango browser comes close at the moment), you
can select UTF-8 format, which is a standard encoding of Unicode.  Unicode
should be the wave of the future; it will theoretically support texts in any
language or mixture of languages.  If your browser doesn't support Unicode,
complain.

Please direct any suggestions and questions to me.

Yiddish Voice Radio Features Singer Perl Teitelbaum
Introduces the New Recording of Yiddish Children's Songs

The Yiddish Voice, a Yiddish-language weekly radio show, will feature an
interview with Perl Teitelbaum on its upcoming show, Wednesday, November 5,
from 7:30 to 8:30 p.m on WUNR 1600 AM in Boston, Mass.

Perl Teitelbaum, a native speaker of Yiddish who was born in Poland and
immigrated to the US as a teenager, has been performing as a Yiddish singer
for several years.  She was prominently featured along with other young
musicians on the recording "Zumerteg: 20 New Yiddish Songs", featuring
songs by the poet Beyle Schaechter-Gottesman.

Her latest recordings appear on the "Di Grine Katshke" ("The Green Duck"),
a new CD recording and songbook produced by Living Traditions, Inc.  The
recording of "Di Grine Katshke" includes 25 Yiddish children's songs about
animals, and features, in addition to Teitelbaum's, performances by such
leading Yiddish singers and klezmer musicians as Lorin Sklamberg, Adrienne
Cooper, Henry Sapoznik, Jeff Warschauer, and Lauren Brody.

In the interview, Teitelbaum discusses the history of the project to produce
"Di Grine Katshke", as well as some background on the songs included.  She
also talks about her experience as both a teacher of Yiddish language to
adults and as a mother of Yiddish speaking children, both of which activities
served to motivate her involvement in the project.  In addition to the
interview, several selections from "Di Grine Katschke" will be played, with
introductions by  Teitelbaum.

The Yiddish Voice, which began broadcasting in July, 1994, features music,
poetry, comedy, interviews, news, commentary, and announcements of current
events, all of it in the Yiddish language.

This is the second notice, since maybe there are those who didn't get the 
first.

For several months now a group of people have been writing and distributing
droshes on the parshe of the week--in Yiddish, of course.  We switch off
writing, so that everyone gets a chance.

Interested people should let me know.
