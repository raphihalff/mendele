Subject: The God of My Unbelief

In case there has not yet been a response to the April 14th query
[10.055] about the quote: "great is the God of my disbelief", the
source is the powerful Yiddish poem, "Mayn Vog'l Bruder", by Yankev
Glatstein. The fourth stanza of the poem begins:

"der Got fun mayn umgloybn is prekhtik
Vee leeb is mir mayn fashlafter Got"

which I would render as follows in English

"The God of my unbelief is magnifient
How nice is my weekened God"

This astonishing poem contains many more varieties on that same theme,
such as:

"Mayn tayerer Got,
vifil tfiles tsu im hob ikh farshveht"
("My beloved God
How many prayers I have descrated unto him")

and,

"Mayn Got Shloft un ikh vakh iber im"
("My God slumbers and I watch over him")

All of these, and more, are part of Glatshtayn's radical transformation
of the biblical and rabbinic doctrines of Divine Providence, largely as
a response to the Holocaust. Glatshtayn's transvaluation of traditional
Jewish theology renders the Psalmist's "Guardian of Israel who neither
slumbers nor sleeps" into the powerless, somnolent divinity who must be
watched over by Israel, now the guardian of an effectively dead God.

Long before the writings of professional "Holocaust Theologians", such
as Richard Rubenstein, Arthur Cohen, Emil Fackenheim, etc., Glatshtayn
advanced in his poetry the most daring Jewish response to the problem
of faith after the Khurbn.

Subject: papirnik?

Hi - a colleague asked me about the word papirnik - he writes,
"'Papirnik' is the title of a collection of stories by a Jewish writer
from Vienna, and his French colleague Moses has a novel 'Papernik'--any
clarification on the etymology of this term would be very much
appreciated."

Which query I'm hereby sending on to Mendele for him - any ideas?

Best,
Larry Rosenwald

Subject: "tsores"

I believe I know how to use the word "tsores" in its encompassing
meaning of overall misery, woe, trouble, as when someone is beset by
multiple (or single or general) miseries, woes, troubles. In
sympathizing with someone who has only one problem, I would say that I
am sorry for his "tsora." If someone has, specifically, two miseries,
woes, troubles that are besetting him simultaneously (such as his
business is failing and his wife has left him), how do I apply "tsores"
to reflect two such miseries, etc.? Two Israeli friends have suggested
"tsorot" but this sounds to my untrained ear more Hebrew than Yiddish,
although I'd be unsurprised if the derivation of "tsores" makes their
Hebrew solution the one and proper way for me to say that "I am sorry
for your "two" miseries, woes, troubles, etc."

Subject: Gender-neutral names

"Zisl" can be used by a male or a female. A famous rosh-yeshive bore the

name "Simkhe-Zisl."

Subject: Gender-Neutral Names

I've wondered about the Yiddish name "Mikhle", a girl's name, at least
in my mother's part of Vays-Rusland.  I've speculated on it's being a
female counterpart of Mikhl or Mikhele, or is it, perhaps, a Yiddish
form of the Hebrew Mikhal (Michal, King David's first wife)? I'd like
to be enlightened on this.  I'd also like to know its correct Yiddish
spelling.

Subject: name Frimet

My late mother's given name was Khana-Frimet (Frumet). Could anybody
tell me what is the origin of Frimet? Was it originally Fruma?

Subject: Shnoderer

In response to khaver Tein [10.056]:

I believe it is a "Shnoderer," from the Hebrew, SheNadar, meaning 'who
has pledged.' A Shnoderer would also make door-to-door collections as
well.

Subject: a finstere nakht in bronsvill

"A finstere nacht in bronsvill" was a oft heard saying in my family,
but not as a tagline for a joke.  Rather as a descriptive piece
comparable to "as the sun sinks slowly in the west" used as a colorful
descriptive bit for a real happening.

Subject: S'iz geven a finstere nakht....

I put subject line to a group of 20 "mature" people who get together
weekly to resurrect our long-ago learned Yiddish. Immediately 4 of them
broke into smiles. They agreed that the unspoken lines dealt with
common human anatomy that should not be spoken of in public. The words
are:
Der vint hot gebloysn --- of-tselokhas,
Es hot ibergekert mayn kleyder,
Un ikh hob gehat a kalten tukhas.
