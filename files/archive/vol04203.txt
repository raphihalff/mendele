Maks Erik believed that Suesskind von Trimberg was Jewish, but there is
no evidence to support this. Suesskind von Trimberg wrote in German and
had no connection with Yiddish literature - even if he was a Jew. Fact
is, that we know little or nothing about Yiddish or Judeo-German folk
music, but we do know that it is highly unlikely there ever were any
Yiddish minnesingers or minstrels. An excellent article on this by
Professor Chone Shmeruk, "Can the Cambridge Manuscript Support the
_Spielmann_ Theory in Yiddish Literature?" was published in _Studies in
Yiddish Literature and Folklore_ [Research Project of the Institute of
Jewish Studies, Monograph Series 7, The Hebrew University], Jerusalem
1986. It has also appeared in other languages. The article also deals
with the question of Yiddish creations and adaptations, and editions of
German works in Hebrew characters. By the way, Provence is not in
Northern Europe but in the South of what is now France.

Subject: Isaac Bashevis Singer

Just so that all those Mendeleniks who live outside of Manhattan are
aware of it, it might be of interest of all to know that as I was walking
along Broadway and West 86th Street last Saturday morning I noticed that
West 86th Street had been named Isaac Bashevis Blvd. As many might know,
Singer used to live in this neighborhood.

Subject: Shostakovich - review

In his sympathy and solidarity with the Jews after the Doctors Trials
Shostakovich composed the music to 11 Yiddish songs, translated to
Russian under the title "From Jewish Folk Poetry" op. 79. With the help
of Joachim Brown`s essay I tried to identify them and had success with 5
of them.

I. Plach ob umershem mladenste - Lament for a dead infant -  ?
II. Zabotlivyie mama i tyotya  - Fussy Mummy and Auntie -
  Shlof, shlof, shlof!/Der tate vet foren in dorf (Ginzburg/Marek 72)
III. Kalybelnaya - Lullaby - ?
IV. Pered dolgoy razlukoy  - Before a long separation -
  Oy, Avram, ikh ken on dir nit sayn (Mlotek: Pearls... 24)
V. Predasterezhenye  - A warning -
 Her Khasi! me tor nit geyn (Rubin 78)
VI. Broshennyi atets - The deserted father -
 Elje der sheynker hot ongeton sayn khalat (Ginzburg/Marek 354)
VII. Pesnya o nuzhde - A song of poverty -
 Oyfn boydem shloft der dakh (Mlotek: Pearls 80)
VIII. Zima  -  Winter
IX. Kharoshaya zhizn  - The good life
X. Pesnya devushki  -  A girl`s song ?
XI. Schastye  -  Happiness   ?

Who can help identify the other six songs?    Who has the source
Shostakovich used, namely Y. Dobrushin & A. Yuditsky: Yidishe folks-
lider, Moscow 1940?

Ruben Frankenstein
