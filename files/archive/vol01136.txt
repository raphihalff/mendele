Something on "r"-"l" confusions; bal mitzva and bar mitzva.
 
You do not have to go to Japanese to find similar
confusions. Classic Hebrew contains a number of examples -
garin - galin [pit, stone of fruit, nucleus] and sharsheret
- shalshelet [chain, dynasty {including the TV series}]
 come to mind.

>For 'bal-mitsve' vs 'bar-mitsve' just listen to a Japanese.
>Again, a universal phonetic phenomenon that people on the
>list attribute to Yiddish

a nice little example from english: grammar and glamour
have the same origin!

Ellen,

Your explanation of the essence of folk-etymology was very
clear. I had two points which may have gotten lost in my
long posting. 1) folk-etymology cannot be folk-etymology
simply because it is wrong. Such a use of the term would
seem to rob it of its usefulness. 2) Defining folk-
etymology on the basis of the actual hypothesis cannot be
meaningful either; professional linguists themselves use
sound similarities to posit relationships; they too pull
apart words to make sense out of them.  Hence it must be
what is done after the hypothesis is generated (or not
done) that makes folk-etymology what it is.  This was my
suggestion. Also, thanks for the spelling correction on
Ra(i)mon.

Melekh.

Subject: Introduction

I've subscribed to the mailing list to pass on to my
mother.  When I was growing up, Yiddish was the primary
language of the household.  But I've forgotten (or it lies
dormant) most of what I knew.

My mother still communciates in Yiddish with many of her
friends, both verbally and through letters.  She has also
found it quite helpful in working with some of the new
Russian immigrants who have settled in the Boston area.  As
an avid reader, she has also enjoyed any materials in
Yiddish that she finds, even transliterated.

Subject: NAMES

My old aunt (mihme, tante -- take your pick) talked
about a mix-up of one of her friends and referred to him as
a "Moishe kapoire."  I know what this means, except now
that Mendele has been educating me to things I used to take
for granite, I wonder why the Moishe in the expression?
Does anyone know? There is also the name "Moishe pipick"
whose meaning I don't quite know, although this could well
be a character created by Sholem Aleichem.  I'd also
appreciate any clarification of meaning and source on this
name. --Hershel
