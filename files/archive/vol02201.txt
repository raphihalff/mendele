Subject: naar

	A Hebrew sliding pond is a "magleisha", from
the Hebrew root GLSh (to slide); the yiddishy
pronunciation "magleitcha" (from Yiddish glitchen) does
not leave me with any doubt of it's Hebrew origin.

	Similarly, the Hebrew sweater "sveder" HAS to
be Yiddish related, with all due respects to the
talmudic "sudar".  Yiddish may have gotten it from
English, but even my Polish acquaintances use this
word.

	Where is all the assurance coming from,
regarding the origin of "naar"?

Subject: Fractured posuk drashes

	Dan Breslauer's 'naarish' drash of the posuk at
the end of birkat hamazon, viz

>"narishkeit", only the foolishness of an old fool, that
>could claim that a Zaddik is never abandoned or his
>children sent out to seek bread!

	reminded me of a similar fractured
interpretation of shabbes mincha's "adam uvhema toshia,
hashem".  It became repunctuated with a dash between
the second and third words, and farteitched as: "az a
mentsch iz a behema, zul em gut helfen".

Subject: P.S. on nar-naronim

After all of that, "iker shokhakhti". I've obviously
neglected to account directly for the precise form of
"naronim". I don't think I can, but I do believe that
the explanation resides within the structure that I set
up.

Subject: More on aler/ayin

Meylekh, I just noticed the parenthetic remark in your
message of May 3--the one I was ostensibly replying to.
I think you may be confusing the issue when you say
that "ayin" is not always a vowel in Yiddish. It is,
except in the traditional spelling of words of Hebrew
origin, where it's simply an artifact of a totally
different system. As for "alef", it too, it, too, is
either a vowel (as in the case of [a] and [o]) or
strictly an orthographic symbol, either as a "dummy"
consonant in non-Hebrew words, or as whatever, in the
traditional spellings of Hebrew words. Yes? No?
