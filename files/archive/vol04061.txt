Subject: Yiddish Textbooks

Along with many others, I, too am self-taught. Although both my parents
spoke Yiddish, I refused to even listen to it.  In my mid-40's I decided
to correct that mistake. The books that I used (in order of difficulty)
are:

     1. The Yiddish Teacher (H.E. Goldin) Hebrew Publishing Company [may
        be a different publisher now] 77 Delancy St. New York

     2. Learning Yiddish in Easy Stages [Zuckerman and Herbst] J. Simon/
        Pangloss Press PO Box 4071 Malibu, CA

     3. College Yiddish [Uriel Weinreich] YIVO Inst for Jewish Research, NY

I believe that all three books can be pruchased form YIVO [1048 Fifth
Ave. New York City, or The Workmen's Circle, also in New York

Good luck.

Subject: Sholem Asch 1952 Columbia Lecture Recording

The following may interest those following the earlier thread on Sholem
Asch.

Folkways Records, which was cofounded by Sholem Asch's son, Moses, and
run by him from 1947 to 1987, recorded a lecture given by the senior Asch
at Columbia University in 1952.  The lecture was given in English, but
has many non-English words and phrases (mostly Hebrew and Yiddish) thrown
in it, which on the recording are strangely and crudely "dubbed" with
English translation.

As I recall, having heard it once several years ago, the lecture presents
Asch's answers to his critics -- on his writing generally, on his role as
a Jewish writer, and particularly on the subject of his alleged
conversion to Christianity.  It's somewhat long and rambling. It's also
rather hard to make out what he's saying.  But I think his indignation
and his intensity of feeling and bitterness came across loud and clear in
many parts of the recording.  As I recall, in this lecture he flatly
denies that he converted to Christianity, or anything like that.  There's
much more there, I think, of interest.  I would like it if someone who
has, or will have, studied it a bit more would offer a better review than
I can manage right now.

I borrowed the record from a library in Cleveland -- I think it was the
Cleveland Heights Library.  That may not be convenient for many, but you
can also buy the recording on a reissued tape, along with a copy of the
original liner notes -- these contain a transcript of the lecture -- from
Smithsonian/Folkways.  Here's some of the info.

Subject: Yiddish secular school movement

The following is posted for Gella Schweid Fishman:

*** An urgent call to rescue papers, documents, photographs, and other ***
***   memorabilia pertaining to the Yiddish secular school movement    ***

Please don't throw out the documented memories you have of your years in
the Yiddish Secular Schools of the USA and Canada.

Maybe you were a student, teacher, parent, or board memeber of one or
more of these schools. Your memories are very important to preserve so
that others may appreciate this 'golden age' of Jewish education in
Yiddish.

Too much has already been thrown out!

An archival collection of these Jewish historical treasures is being
organized by Gella Schweid Fishman as part of her Oral History project
pertaining to the Yiddish Secular Schools in America.

All of your materials will be included (under your name) in the Yiddish
Secular School Collection, which is housed in the Department of Special
Collections at Stanford University Libraries in Stanford, California.

For further information, write to Gella Schweid Fishman at:

345 Sheridan Ave.            3340 Bainbridge Ave.
Palo Alto, CA 94306          Bronx, NY 10467
(summer and winter)          (autumn and spring)

You may also respond to this list or E-Mail to me; I will forward all
responses to Gella Schweid Fishman.

Subject: poor romanization of Yiddish and other sins

Zellig Bach [writes about Romanization of Yiddish:]

> We need greater care and self-discipline when romanizing Yiddish.

We have all had the experience of suffering when someone not too well
versed in a language we know well insists on mangling it. These days I am
all too conscious of the effect I have on others when I try to conduct my
daily affairs here in Paris in my very inadequate French. BUT the only
courteous thing one can do in such a situation is to be patient, and,
when appropriate, offer helpful corrections.

I submit that the issue of romanization is a red herring. "allah" instead
of "alemen" is not an orthographic error. It is certainly true that quite
a few of us Mendelniks know Yiddish only aurally as remembered from
childhood. We do our best. Corrections offered in a friendly spirit are
appropriate and should be welcomed; but not the cross ill-tempered kind
of comment typified by the above. Unless, of course, it is proposed to
exclude from Mendele all who can not pass an entrance exam in Yiddish.
