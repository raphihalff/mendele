Subject: Re: dray niselekh

Marvin Engel asks about a song which is very close to one that the
singer Sarah Gorby recorded on a 78 rpm record and which I transcribed
as follows. (The bracketed material is stuff I was unsure of.)

 From Sarah Gorby, Melotone 293

DRAY YINGELEKH (Zaslavsky)

Di mame hot dray yingelekh,
Dray yingelekh gehat.
Mit beyde royte bekelekh,
Di tsarte [samet blat].

Hot eyns geheysn Berele,
Dos tsveyte Khayim Shmerele,
Dos drite hot geheysn
"Men zol im koyfn shikh."

Ikh hob aykh opgenart,
Ikh hob gevust ir vart,
Dos drite kleyne yingele,
Dos drite, dos bin ikh, bin ikh.
Dos drite kleyne yingele,
Dos drite, dos bin ikh, bin ikh.

Di mame hot dray niselekh
Fun dem yarid gebrakht.
Dray gute fete niselekh,
Dray niselekh, a trakht!

Iz eyns geven far Berele,
Un eyns far Khayim Shmerele,
Un gor dos beste nisele,
Hot zi gelozt far zikh.

Ir vundert zikh a bisl
Far vos nit mir a nisl,
Vayl nisl, nisl, nisele,
Dos drite, dos bin ikh, bin ikh.
Vayl nisl, nisl, nisele,
Dos drite, dos bin ikh, bin ikh.

Di mame hot aheymgebrakht
Tsvey niselekh [...] mikh,
Tsvey nislekh far di briderlekh,
Un mir tsvey naye shikh!

Ellen Prince

[From Mendele 07.078: The song "Di mame hot dray yingelekh"  was written by
Y. Goichberg.  The more popular melody was written by Michl Gelbart.  I
believe the melody that Sarah Garby sings (that Ellen Prince) refers to is
by N. Zaslavsky. (Chana and Yosl Mlotek)]

Subject: Hinde Bergner, On Long Winter Nights

This is to announce the recent publication of an English language
translation from the Yiddish of Hinde Bergner's memoir of life in a small
Galician shtetl - On Long Winter Nights. As members of Mendele might
recall, Bergner is the mother of Melekh Ravitsh and Herts Bergner, and the
grandmother of painter Yosl Bergner. The  memoir recalls the gradual impact
of modernization on a traditional world from the perspective of a young
woman. As translator, I provide an introduction to situate the memoir in
the context of Galician Jewry. This short volume should be of particular
interest to students of Eastern European Jewish culture and Jewish women's
studies, and is a new addition to the library of Jewish women's memoir from
Eastern Europe.

Publication Information: Hinde Bergner, On Long Winter Nights: Memoirs of a
Jewish Family in a Galician Township, 1870-1900, translated from the
Yiddish, with an introduction by Justin Cammy, Harvard Center for Jewish
Studies, 2005 (Distributed by Harvard University Press, ISBN 0-674-01969-5,
$25, cloth; ISBN 0-674-01970-9, $17.50, paper.

Subject: Re: parkh

The Polish word _parch_, referred to by Lyuba Dukker in 15.009, is the name
of a skin disease that is called favus in English. It is a kind of
ringworm, caused by a fungus. Its most typical manifestation is on the
scalp, where it produces round, yellow, cup-shaped crusts with a "musty" or
"mousy" odor. The 1911 Encyclopedia Brittanica says that favus "is
commonest among the poorer Jews of Russia, Poland, Hungary, Galicia and the
East and among the same class of Mahommedans in Turkey, Asia Minor, Syria,
Persia, Egypt, Algiers etc. ...Lack of personal cleanliness is an almost
necessary factor in its development..."  The Polish term seems to be used
nowadays only (or primarily) with reference to a fungal disease of plants.
The human disease or animal disease is more often called _grzybica
woszczynowy_ (sebaceous mycosis) or _strupien' woszczynowy_ (sebaceous
tinea).

The word _parch_ was also a term of abuse applied to Jews in Polish, as was
the adjective _parchaty_, also borrowed by Ukrainian and (perhaps via
Ukrainian) Russian, which originally meant 'infected with favus'. A variant
of the adjective meaning 'infected with favus' was Polish _parszywy_ (with
similar forms in Ukrainian and Russian), which also took on the figurative
meaning 'lousy, rotten', whence Yiddish _parshive_. Note that English
"lousy" (which is considerably weaker than the Slavic adjectives) also
presumably originally meant 'infected with lice'.

Subject: Re: parkh

I don't know what other connotations the term "parkh" might have, but my
version of Harkavy's dictionary defines it as "scab, scurf, (fig) wicked
man". It shows up in my grandfather's memoirs of his Lithuanian heymshtot
Keidan, in this description of a rather frightful character:

"avrom parkh, a hoykher, darer mit a tsigenem groyer berdl, velkher iz
geven eyner fun di khapers in nikolays tsaytn, hot tsulib zayn frierdiker
basheftigung oysgeibt epes a min shrek oyf di Keidaner yidn, velkhe nokh
als kinder, flegn araynfalnen in a tsiter, ven men flegt nor zayn nomen
dermonen."

My translation: (corrections welcomed):

Avrom 'the Scab' was a tall, skinny man with a grey goatee. He had been one
of the child-snatchers in Tsar Nikolai's time, and because of his former
occupation he still evoked terror in the hearts of Keidan Jews, who as
children had trembled at the mere mention of his name.

Subject: Re: lakhn mit yashtcherkes

A belated response to Bernard Brasen, who asked in 14.050 about "lakhn
mit yashtsherkes": there's a possible etymology in 1.208 (April 6,
1992).

Subject: Re: kakt mir bkherem

"freg mich b'kheyrem" was the the ironic answer my parents would give me if
asked about an item that I had misplaced. That is to say "I might as well
be in excommunication for all the good it's going to do you to ask me about
the thing you misplaced" This expression was also liberally applied when I
(who was already a smartaleck at a young age) would pose a myriad of
questions for which they could supply no ready answers. I also have heard
the word play of "kak zey on instead of kik zey on. I heard it used both in
jest and in serious insult.
