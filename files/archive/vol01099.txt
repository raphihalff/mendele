Growing up in Hollywood, California (yes, people do grow up
there), I recall my mother buying a bread called sissel at
the local deli.  It was a light rye with caraway seeds, and
the same bread without the seeds was NOT called sissel.

Synonyms   for "binde": shnips, shlips, kravat.

As for the pronunciation "khally" and even the spelling
"holly bread", there's an area in northeastern Poland,
around the towns Lomza and Grajewo (local Yiddish "Womzi,
Grayvi") where all words like "khale, kale", etc. are
pronounce d "khali, kali". Could that account for the
"holly bread"?

Are "nigrella seeds" what we call "cherneshkes" in Yiddish?
Are they black sesame? Please enlighten.

[Zogt Mendele: Cherneshkes!  Of course there's a Yiddish
word for them!]

Having just returned from a long stay abroad (about which,
more anon), I'm reading and replying to accumulated
messages--backwards, so to speak. So, back to the boughs of
holly: the tushi, bubi phenomenon may well reflect the
mummy, daddy one. No?

A recipe for the gogl-mogl is to be found in a collection
of NYTimes favorite recipes.

Yasher koyekh, Noyekh. Great summary on the shisl/sisl
story. It's good to be back. Volume 1 of the Yiddish Atlas
now reposes with the publisher. Publication date-mid 1992.

Mikhl.

Thanks for the summary on the question of sissel. Never
having heard of "shissel broyt" I cannot say whether or not
it is/was sissel broyt. Was "shissel broyt" a heavy rye?
Dos iz der iker bay mir!

A further note on Providence, RI B.N. (Before Neusner).
Other than the Taytche Yehudim who came in the mid-
late-nineteenth century, the Yidn who settled in Providence
came from two areas: Podolia and Bessarabia, and the
Ukraine around Kiev. Litvaks and Galitsianers came after
World War I. Korb's Bakery billed itself for years as a
"Polish bakery," which may have been loshon sagi-nahor for
"Jewish." (After all, "polaco" is a common way to avoid
saying "judio" or "ebreo" in a number of Spanish dialects.)
Perhaps the Polish part of Korbs was Lithuanian, and hence
"sissel broyt."   As for me, I'll stick to my grandmother's
version, "bubbe-maanse" or not!
