Subject: Kalich, Khash

Does anyone know the date of death of the Yiddish dramatist and theater
manager, husband of Molly Picon, Jacob Kalich, who was born in 1891? The
birth date of the Vilna Yiddish operetta actor and director Yoysef Khash
(d. 1941), brother of Kadish (K. Khash, 1893-1941)?

Subject: glombike

I had expected some critical remarks about my translation of Yishroel
Shtern's poem (vol. 14.037). Thusfar, my interpretation came under attack,
but not the translation itself.

I found one typo in the translation: flagrance = fragrance and I noticed
that I incorrectly attributed the practice of sorcery or 'popular medicine'
to the 'sogerke' in my comments. The only word in the text that I had a
problem with was 'glombike':

The dictionaries I consulted did not provide a ready answer.

Weinreich has: glomp, der (n) - stalk, stem (of a cabbage, lettuce); dummy,
yokel.  'Stalk, stem,' looks like a good candidate. The meaning 'yokel' is
probably similar to:' a klots mit oygn' - a foolish person.

Can I assume that this word for 'stalk, stem' is also used for fruits? What
are the alternatives for stem in Yiddish? I check with the English-Yiddish
sections of Weinreich and Harkavi:

stalk - di zang, dos shtengl, dos hengerl (of fruit), der katshn. katshenes
(of cabbage etc.); stem - dos shtengl, der shtam [Harkavi: dos shtekele,
der tsvayg]; dummy - der goylem, der glomp, der lekish; yokel - der zhlob.

Conclusion: for fruits the words 'hengerl' and 'shtekele' would be more
common. I only find back 'glomp' as 'dummy'. I try another dictionary,
Tsanin's Yiddish-Hebrew and look up the meanings of the Hebrew, It does not
give me the stem of a fruit on the tree:  glomb (n) der - kelah (final
cheth), kolas, shoresh; tipesh >; kelah - shtengl; glomb (lemoshl fun
kroyt); kolas - shtengl; heyftl; kepl shoresh - vortsl; tipesh - nar,
goylem.

A last resort, the 'oytser', The oytser confirms what I have found and
gives an indication about the origin of the word. It must be a Polish
cabbage stem, while' katshan' is its Russian equivalent:

Stutchkoff (oytser): index: gliomp: 258. teyl kroyt; 340. nar 258. spayz,
getrank. p. 223 [teyln kroyt] katshan, khrapke, gl(i)omp 340. narishkeyt p.
306 nar: gl(i)omp (also: katshan)

Origin/etymology:

Polish: glab (a with ogonek, an little hook underneath) - stalk

Preliminary conclusion:

meaning of gl(i)omb : cabbage stalk > [worthless part of the cabbage] >
stupid person.

Not found as an adjective ending on -ik.

Possible meaning of the adjective glombik:

1. having a stalk (like a cabbage).

2. being like a dummy, yokel

The fruits in the text are: hanging on a tree in an orchard and they are
fragrant. They are big enough to cut up with a small knife.

A cabbage stalk is not appropriate to describe the stem of a pear or a
peach.

Fruits are not clever, but to describe them as dummies is unusual. If
stupid or foolish fruits were meant, the writer could have used many
alternatives expressing the meaning more clearly.

Stuck with glombik, back to the dictionaries once more:

Niborski:

glomb - der (n/es) > glomp

glomp - der (n/es): trognon; fig. abruti, andouille.

Harrap's French-English dictionary translates:

trognon - core of an apple; stump (of a cabbage, etc.), T. de chou, cabbage
runt. F: (to child, to little girl) Mon petit trognon, my little dear.

abruti - sot; idiot, fool

andouille - muff, duffer, chuckle-head, mug

The French translation seems to provide us with an additional meaning for
glomb: core of an apple. If so, glombik could mean: having a core or
core-like and our fruits turn into apples or pears.

In my opinion, this additional meaning of trognon is not meant by Niborski.
The cabbage stalk is obviously what he had in mind. Yiddish has other words
for core: dos harts, der yoder. Moreover, knowing that the fruits have
cores would not add to our understanding of the poem and assuming that they
look like cores or are reduced to cores would not fit with the fragrance of
the garden or their 'vign' on the tree.

Other interpretations of 'glombik', like a connection with German 'Gelumpe'
etc, are not supported by Yiddish dictionaries. Assuming that the word is
the result of a printing error would open the door to a host of
possibilities, none of them obviously correct.

I decide to translate 'fruits having stems' although I am not sure this is
correct.

The Niborski-Vaisbrot Yiddish-French Dictionary is obviously one of the
best available, but we cannot discard our old dictionaries yet. I have been
told that a collective of English speaking Yiddishists is working on a
translation of the dictionary into English. A word of warning: translations
should be checked with all earlier dictionaries, or we get apple cores
where there are none.

Subject: RE: Kuni-leml

In Vol. 14 number 48, Lucas Bruyn states: "The question not answered yet is
how the lamb got to the kune. Must have been a foolish lamb, and, as Mr.
Hartman's original question suggests, probably an innocent lamb as well."

At first glance 'leml' looks to be the Yiddish variation of Dutch
'lummel, derived from lumm (dialect Dutch: lazy, limp).  Possibly,
though, the meaning conflates with 'lommerd' (Lombard), used mediaevally
as an insulting term for bankers and pawn-shop owners, as Lombards were
at one time north of the Alps.

[Note: Lombards as bankers or lenders: the coat of arms of the D'Medici
family is still, in abbreviated form, used as a shop-sign for
pawnbrokers.]

Surely many average people during the middle-ages (and even to recent
times) would have loved to see the lommerd or lummel to whom they owed
money tied to a pillory.

I also suspect that 'kuni' derives from cone (Greek 'konos' - pinecone),
applied to a short conical pillar (or its termination) such as one would
tie a horse or wagon to - but this is mere speculation.

Subject: ikh vil nit keyn ayzerne keytn

I'm a sometime lurker on the list, now turning active in hopes of some
speedy help with the lyrics for B. Charney Vladek's "ikh vil not keyn
ayzerne keytn", which i'm hoping to use in a seder this weekend.

I've only been able to find bare-bones summary translations, and don't have
the Yiddish skills to get the sense of some parts of the song even with a
batch of dictionary work... what I've got is below.

So I'm hoping someone can give me a hand, mainly with the last lines of the
first and third verses, and the last two lines of the fourth.  and of
course if i'm terribly off in other places I'd love to know...

Feel free to email me off-list, at glitz@lessonplanproject.org

Many thanks
un gut yontef
