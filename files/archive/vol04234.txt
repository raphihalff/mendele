Subject: Introduction

I am a professor of public administration at Syracuse University who does
not speak Yiddish--other than the small number of words and phrases I
heard as a youngster in my grandparents' apartment. (My Hungarian is
similarly limited--and has the same "roots".)  I play trombone (classical
and jazz) and, as of last Sunday, Klezmer as well.

I am interested in learning some more Yiddish as well as the literary and
historical characteristics of the language.  Suggestions for a beginner
are welcomed.

Subject: Greek, Hebrew, and -- Targemloshn

This is a P.S. to my recent posting:

Before my Mendelyaner colleagues assert that the interpretations of the
three expressions I discussed are too narrow, I hasten to add that they
could as well have a _positive_ meaning, namely an honest admission that
the matter at hand is "too complex to follow;"  occasionally they may
also be said in an ironic or humorous vein.

This should then cover the entire gamut of the nuances of all three
expressions -- "This is Greek to me," "this is Hebrew to me," and "bay
(ba) mir iz es targemloshn."

Zellig Bach gave some fascinating  examples about Targemloshen and its
association in some  cases with Greek and Hebrew.  If  Reb Noyekh will
allow this time some related remarks  even if not about Yiddish I will
give them in short, with > quotations from Zellig's article.

>"Targem,"  as it is pronounced in Yiddish, means only one thing:  the
>translation of the Bible into Aramaic.  No definite article is used or
>necessary.  Several years after entering kheyder a boy soon learns what
>Targem means.
>
>In time the Targum translation entered the canon of religious readings of
>the Jewish people, and enjoyed a sanctity of its own.  The Talmud then
>enjoined the reading of the weekly Toyre passage ("parshe") twice in
>Hebrew and once in Targum.

I have come across a related  usage by a not fluently Yiddish speaking
group of Jews,  the Yemenites.  Their version of the  khumesh (not the
Sefer Torah but a printed copy) is called TAG (? tav aleph gimel, I do
not know what it  means).  In the TAG, we have  each verse given first in
Hebrew, this is followed by it in Aramaic from the Targum (Unkelos) and
after that  comes the verse in Arabic based  on the translation by Rabbi
Sa'adya Ga'on  (10th Century, Sura, Babylon).   In all versions,
including the Arabic ones, the alphabet used is the Hebrew one.

Zellig then tells us about some  event while meeting his former Hebrew
teacher in Paris:

>One evening, a young lady student in his class sat next to him, and when
>she casually took a glance at his notes, she exclaimed in French "That's
>_Hebrew_ to me.,"  meaning that she could not make out a thing of his
>scribbles.
>
>I regret not knowing French to quote her exclamatory phrase verbatim, but
>it has about the same meaning as the English "That's Greek to me."

As far as I remember some  childhood French this is "c'est Hebreu pour
moi!".

>Well, the interesting part is that in this instance she was correct,
>because he was taking his notes in Hebrew...

Well, he should have replied "pour moi aussi!".

Now I shall let you all return to Yiddish proper.

Subject: Yiddish 'r' in Russian

Ben Alpers is correct re the stereotype, but as my semiotics teacher
Michael Shapiro once remarked, in order for a stereotype to have legs, it
must have a grain of truth (no one will buy that the Swedes are
happy-go-lucky).  The Yiddish uvular /r/ is found in Yiddish-accented
Jewish speakers of Russian, not, obviously, in native speakers of Russian
who happen to be Jewish, and who may not even -know- Yiddish.  Thus his
premise, that "Yiddish speakers in Russia pronounce their "r"s as
Russians do", is mistaken.

Curiously, this pronunciation of /r/ as a uvular trill occurs in at least
two other registers of Russian, although I don't believe it ever occurs
in any territorial dialects.  First, it was found in the speech of some
pre- revolutionary aristocrats, where it was considered an affectation.
References to it crop up in 19th C Russian novels, though it may be hard
to tell from the English translations.

Second, it is taught as a substitute pronunciation to those who cannot
make a trilled 'r', a common impediment in languages that use the apical
trill.  In fact, I know an immigrant from Russia who looks extremely
Jewish, has a very Jewish last name, and who uses the uvular 'r', I
assume because of reason #2.

Ironically, he is _not_ halachically Jewish!
