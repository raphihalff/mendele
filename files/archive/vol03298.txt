Subject: Nit vs. Nisht

Maybe this has already been discussed before I joined mendele, or maybe
this is a question with an obvious answer that I am not aware of:  what
are the geographical parameters, or other parameters, governing the use
of "nit" as opposed to "nisht"?  I find myself using them interchangeably,
without any awareness of where my influences have come from.  Being
neither milkhik nor fleishik (mother's side Litvak, father's Romanian),
with a Yivo-style education to make things worse, it's hard to know where
I picked up this or that.

Subject: Brooklyn

For an interdisciplinary/interdepartmental course on "Brooklyn: The
Poetics of Place," I would welcome suggestions for works in Yiddish in
which Brooklyn plays a central role--either works explicitly about
Brooklyn, works set in Brooklyn in which Brooklyn-ness is foregrounded,
works with Brooklyn/Bruklin (also: Flatbush, Williamsburgh, Brownsville,
etc.) in their titles, or works otherwise connected with the Brooklyn of
today, of our memories, of our longing. (What is it about Brooklyn which
leads one to overwriting, as Alfred Kazin should have asked?) "Works" may
certainly include music and film, high culture and low.

Though there's certainly no dearth of bibliographical tools addressing
works in English, it might also be of interest to hear suggestions from
mendelistn regarding Brooklynalia in languages other than Yiddish and, if
this doesn't stretch the bounds of MENDELE beyond the breaking point,
cultures other than Ashkenazic.

Subject: Bubbis and Zedas

I would like to thank Zachary Baker for his thorough response to my
question about the pronunciation of Bubbi and Zeda in Montreal and
Toronto.  In response to his question: I would say that Montreal Jews
that have migrated to Toronto have maintained their cultural specificity.

First, it is easy to detect a Jewish Montreal accent.  I can even tell
the difference between Jews from Hampstead and Cote St. Luc (in central
Montreal) and Jews from Chomeday (in northern Montreal).

Second, Montreal Jews tend to settle in certain parts of Toronto.  This
is also true of South African and Russian Jews.  The chain migration
theory must be correct.

Finally, Montreal Jews tend to distinguish between themselves and native
Torontonians.  My friends from Montreal constantly lament the fact that
Montreal bagels, smoke meat, and Van Houte's coffee are not readily
available in Toronto.  Generally, they portray the city as a cultural
backwater (they may be right).

I would be interested in hearing what people think about the cultural
differences between the Jewish communities in Toronto and Montreal
(although this is probably outside the scope of Mendele).

Subject: Translation help needed

I am trying to translate some zikhroines fun mayn zeyde, in which he
described his youth in the town of Keidan (Lite). As an elementary
Yiddish student I'm relying almost exclusively on Weinreich and Harkavy,
and I've found a couple of terms where they don't give me a clue. One is
"gloksne-boymer" which zeyde describes as something that grew all around
the area in spring, and which he and other kids used to clip to makhn
fiflech. Anybody know what a "gloksne-boym" might be? The other term I'm
stuck on is "salte-noses" which is something that was apparently stuffed
with cheese and fried in butter, but I don't think is a blintz because he
mentions blintzes as yet another item on the same Shavues milkhedik'n
menu ... Sound familiar to anyone?

Subject: Introduction

I am a professor at a medical school quite interested in Yiddish culture.
I speak Yiddish fluently as I was born in France just before WWll.  My
parents spoke Yiddish at home, and taught me to appreciate this wonderful
language.

Is there a compendium of jokes in yiddish available?
