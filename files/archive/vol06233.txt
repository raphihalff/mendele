Subject: Jewish geography

Some years ago I wrote two articles on the subject of Jewish toponymy:
"Eastern European 'Jewish Geography':  Some Problems and Suggestions," in
Toledot, vol. 2, no. 3 (winter 1978-79), pp. 9-14, and "More Eastern
European 'Jewish Geography'," in Toledot, vol. 2, no. 4 (Spring 1979), pp.
2-5.  The articles were specifically aimed at addressing problems
encountered by genealogical researchers in locating information about
their ancestral shtetlekh, and included extensive bibliographies on the
subject.  From the perspective of Yiddish linguistics, the most important
citation, in my opinion, is Edward Stankiewicz's article, "Yiddish Place
Names in Poland," in The Field of Yiddish:  Studies in Language, Folklore,
and Literature; second collection, edited by Uriel Weinreich (The Hague:
Mouton, 1965), pp. 158-181.

Subject: Place names

Having been brought up as the child of Lodzers, and having spoken
Lodzer yiddish as a child and always since referred to landsmen as
lodzers, I was at first taken back by Polish friends and colleagues
who always, politely, corrected me to inform me that the city's names
was pronounced VWodz...

Memory becomes history when it is enshrined in place names and
linguistic usage carries it forward until the memory carriers are no
more, political change creates a new name and the printed records of
the past become mysteries for historians to explain to those who
stumble upon them.  Now, how many times have you wondered whether to
fly overseas from Idlewild Airport in New York, or would you prefer to
use Kennedy?

Subject: Shimelekhl

[Re: Gene Sucov's query about "shimmalekhl" (6.231):]

Ikh hob amol gekent a shrayber mitn nomen "Avram Davidson" vos er
flegt haltn a lange droshe af der teme fun "kinder shpiel als
iberblaybekhtz fun kishuf un ibergleybn."

Loyt zayn droshe iz "shimelekhl" a "gilgul" funem lateynishn vort
"simulacrum" vos iz azaymin farkishefter ringl oder kreyz.

Tzi dos iz emes tzi nit, veys yakh nit ... ober nu ... lomir zen vos
di andere greyse kep veln ba-arbetn ot-di frage.

I once knew a writer named Avram Davidson who used to discourse on the
theme "children's play as a remainder of magic and superstition."

According to his discourse, shimelekhl was a creature in transition
from the Latin word "simulacrum" which is a kind of magic ring or
circle.

If it's true or not, I dunno ... but nu .... let's see how other great
minds will work out this  question.

Subject: Shimelekhl

In regard to Gene Sucov's query about the meaning of the "full word"
_shimelekhl_ my guess is that the _shime_ segment of the word has no
meaning. Its function is to supply an extra two syllable beat to the
word _lekhl_ so that it can fit in metrically with the chant "I make a
shimelekhl, and someone sticks it in!"  _Shimelekhl_ played a dual
role in the East New York section of Brooklyn where I grew up:  It
helped to determine who was next person to be "it" when, in the last
round of the game "Hide-and-go-seek" (or "Hango-seek" as we called it)
the last "it" person would lean against a tree or a wall with eyes
closed and head buried in her arms while  one of us would draw a
little circle (to represent a _lekhl_) on her back and recite the
chant.  If the last "it" person would guess who's finger was poked
into the imaginary _shimelekhl_ then the poker was "it".  If she
guessed wrong she was "it" again.

The other function for _shimelekhl_ was to give a name to a four inch
diameter hole that was dug into the ground and which was used for a
hazelnut throwing game on Passover.  To play the game you'd grab a
handful of hazelnuts and get ready to toss it into the _shimelekhl_ .
Your opponent would call out "odds!" or "evens!"  You'd then stand
about six feet back from the hole and toss the handful in.  A count
was then taken and if your opponent's call of an odd or even amount
was correct he'd win the nuts.  If his call was wrong, he'd give you
the same amount of nuts as you tossed. This game was also played with
marbles at other times of the year.

Farvos klingt es mir azoy modne, ven ikh leyen "ikh veys, du

Subject: Oysyes gedoyloys af yidish

A frage: Mir nutsn do di lateynishe oysyes -- se nito keyn breyre.
Ober farvos nit oysnutsn di capital letters? They are highly
advantageous,  and not to use them simply because they don't exist in
the Hebrew alphabet is silly, in my opinion.
