Leonard Prager, who wrote "Shakespeare in Yiddish" (Shakespeare Quarterly,
1968, vol.19, no.2, pp.149-163) will probably answer better, but meanwhile
there are at least two translations of Hamlet: by Israel Schwartz (New York:
Forverts, 1918) and by Itshe Goldberg (Minsk: Melukhe-farlag fun Vaysrusland,
1934).

About performance see paper by Iska Alter "When the Audience Called 'Author!
Author!': Shakespeare on New York's Yiddish Stage" (Theatre History Studies,
1990, vol.10, pp.141-162).

Mendele has grown beyond any reasonable expectations and the volume of
contributions has kept pace.  So has the number of communications between
subscribers and the shames, some of these dealing with submitted articles,
others with subscription questions.

Opgeredt, Mendele is the only worthwhile thing on the internet and your shames
takes his responsibilities seriously.  Nevertheless books need reading,
gardens need tending, eyniklekh need zeydes.  Something has to change.

Beginning at once,  the shames will _not_ any longer enter into negotiations
with contributors and will _not_ answer their notes as to why their pieces
have not appeared in Mendele.  Here are some of the reasons why they may have
been rejected.

1. The post largely duplicates what has already been run.  This happens most
often in answer to a query.  All such posts will however be forwarded to the
questioner.

2. The post deals is not primarily about Yiddish but instead a political or
religious gloss that takes us beyond our common interests.

3. The post requires more editing than the shames deems appropriate.  This
includes correcting typos, changing BLOCK LETTERS to a more civilized way of
writing, eccentric layouts, shameless self-promotion, ad hominem attacks,
lengthy quotes, yoo-hoo messages and the like.

4. The post is irredeemably trivial.  This does _not_ refer to questions
raised by subscribers who are unsure of their Yiddish.  These questions will
be treated respectfully and where appropriate forwarded to a knowledgable
member of our khevruse to be answered.

5. The post is either not signed (full name please) or does not carry a
usable Subject: line.

I hope that Mendele's friends and readers will understand the need for
this new arrangement.  Who knows: it may even improve things.
