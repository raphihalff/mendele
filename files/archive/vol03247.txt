Subject: Zachary Baker

    I was very happy to read Prof. Wolitz's entry devoted to Zachary
Baker. I would like to add that scholars from Poland owe him a great
deal as well. A number of my colleagues and I visited YIVO in the
past and we all appreciated Zachary's enormous competence,
knowledge, culture and patience. During his last visit to Lublin in
October 1993 he met a group of Polish students from the English
Department and talked to them about YIVO and Jewish studies, as well
as answered a number of questions. My students recall this meeting
as one of their most interesting classes and some of them say that
Zachary made them genuinely interested in Yiddish and Jewish
culture. Thanks a lot, Zachary, for everything you have done for us.

Can anyone tell me something about this code page? Or point me to
the right place? Where is it defined. Are there other fairly common
code pages that are useful for Yiddish?

A dank,
Pierre

Subject: Interwar memoirs

To Sean Martin:

Sorry I haven't been in touch before but I would recommend the
memoirs of Hersh Abramowicz, the father of YIVO's beloved Dina for
insight into Poles and Jews. There are others but I am not where I
can cite them easily. Dovid Roskies' "Against Apocalypse" has
extensive bibliography. If you find material on interbellum
attitudes toward Germans let me know. Yechiel Szentuch's book on the
subject is supposed to be coming out in English,to be published by
HUC press.

Good luck,
Dvosye Bilik

Subject: Re: the name for 'yiddish' in other languages

Standard Russian word for Yiddish is _evreiskii_ [jewish]. Word
_idish_ exists, but is used mostly in scholarly context, and almost
always in collocation _iazyk idish_ [Yiddish language], which means
that this word requires an additional definition in order to become
a lexeme. Interestingly, _evreiskii iazyk_ [Jewish language] in a
broad sense may be used for both Yiddish and Hebrew. At the same
time, there is a distinct difference between _drevneevreiskii_
[ancient Jewish] for pre-20th century Hebrew and _ivrit_ for modern
Hebrew.

Subject: Yiddish dictionaries

This is in regard to the question of Weinreich vs Harkavy dictionary
choice.  I also work in a university library and do most of the
complex copy and original cataloging of our recently acquired
Yiddish collection. I use both Harkavy and Weinreich...Perhaps this
quote from the introduction to the reprint edition of Harkavy's
Yiddish-English-Hebrew dictionary would be of some help.  "This
republication of Harkavy's Yiddish-English-Hebrew dictionary in no
way displaces Uriel Weinreich's Modern English-Yiddish
Yiddish-English Dictionary (1968).  In fact, the two complement each
other.  Weinreich's is a masterpiece of modern scientific
lexicography that has become an international structural model for
makers of other bilingual dictionaries.  Its semantic structureing
reflects the author's brilliant research in general linguistics. Its
comprehensive analytical apparatus is tantamount to a Yiddish
grammar compressed into a lexicographic format.  Moreover,
Weinreich's dictionary is bidirectional; it will therefore remain
the first dictionary for elementary students of Yiddish, for those
seeking equivalents for the English vocabulary of modern science and
technology, and for those desiring guidance on the attitudes of
American Yiddish normativists toward a given item.  For the last
decade or so, however, the disappearance of Harkavy's trilingual
dictionary from the market has been painful for more advanced
students of the language requiring a more exhaustive coverage of the
language of the nineteenth and twentieth century masters of modern
Yiddish literature and a dictionary that is more descriptively
oriented. The student of Yiddish can supplement both Harkavy and
Weinreich with the first four volumes of Yudel Marks unabridged
Yiddish-Yiddish defining dictionary, the Groyser verterbukh fun der
yidisher shprakh..."  Hope this helps!
