Subject: Mutual comprehensibility (or lack thereof)

Zev bar-Lev's item in mendele 2#160 reminds me of an
amusing incident I had more years ago than I care to count.
My American-born mother came to visit while I was doing a
post-doctoral fellowship in Israel, and I took her to visit
her only Israeli relative, a cousin who had been born in
Poland and moved to Israel during the 1930's.
Theoretically, they shared the same dialect of Yiddish as a
common language; however, my mother's Yiddish was, by then,
three-quarters English, and her cousin's was one-quarter
Polish and one-half Hebrew.  They managed to communicate
only on the most rudimentary level without me translating
for them.

Subject: Yo

Bob, Generally, "jo", NEVER "ju", sometimes (in Courland)
"ja", even "joj" (in the Transcarpathian area), and
DEFINITELY "je" in the Lithuanian-Belorussian area. Not to
be confused with English "yeah". Whence "je" in Yiddish.
I'm not certain at the moment. A search through Lexer's
Middle High German Dictionary (3 volumes, not the pocket
version or even of Grimm, may reveal the answer.

A lesson to be learned (from an about to become a
grandfather). az a bob zogt, meg men ir gleybn.

Good wishes, Mikhl.

Subject: RE: New Mendele archive

I hope to contribute something of substance in a while,
such as a favorite epithet of my mother's that has always
fascinated me with regard to origin, but I have little
sense of how to put Yiddish into our alphabet.  Is there
some work that provides a key to this?  I seem to notice
variations in different sources.
 
The new archive system works smoothly and perfectly.  One
minor note: when I typed 'bye' to get out, after "getting"
a few numbers of Mendele, that command was not recognized.
'Quit' did work, however, as it usually does in most
systems.
 
As a newcomer to Mendele I find the material very
fascinating.  I'm a 64 year old sociologist, born in
Paterson, N.J., and raised there and in Passaic and
Manhattan, N.Y. of parents from Poland.  My mother's family
from Lodz, my fathers from there and near Warsaw.  While my
first language was Yiddish, I have lost the easy ability to
speak and I never did learn to read.  I do understand
spoken Yiddish fairly well and speak with some hesitancy,
easy among relatives, useful when travelling as in parts of
Europe where I find myself "switching" with German.  My
mother- in-law was of Polish origin but raised in Germany
and spoke only German, not Yiddish, which helped "corrupt"
my Yiddish.
 
I am getting a few issues at a time to try and catch up to
all the material you have, and noticing old friends or
people I have known from different contexts from time to
time.  Martin Lakin I knew/knew of in the context of his
work in gerontology a few decades ago, when the field was
small and less divided.  Zachary Baker is the son of an
older friend whom I knew as a graduate student and when
Zach was a bright Minneapolis youngster.  I have wanted to
reclaim the Yiddish that was my original tongue as a child
in New Jersey and which was limited to conversation with
older family and friends, now departed.  My cousins in
Canada had a better Yiddish education due to the
institutions in Toronto.  They learned to read and write.
I always find it very difficult to express anything in
Yiddish in written form, or formally for that matter so
you'll excuse my Goyishe salutation,   Best wishes,
 
                                       Harold L. Orbach
 
P.S.  My Yiddish name is Hirsh Liebish, or familiarly
      Hershel, or the even more familiar, childhood
      diminutive of Heshy.  But its been a long time since
      I heard the last one from older cousins and
      playmates; family friends, aunts and uncles always
      used Hershel.

Subject: Humpik

Avi Joseph Hyman (2.158) asked about a word _humpike_.  In
_Yidish shprakh_ 4 (1944) Raphael Mahler has an article on
the Yiddish of Nowy Sacz (with a "tail" on the _a_, Yiddish
"Sandz"--in southern Poland).  On page 70 he includes the
word _humpik_, which he glosses as 'a kleyn dik mentshele'.
I don't know whether this has anything to do with the word
in question, and I can't offer any obvious etymology.
