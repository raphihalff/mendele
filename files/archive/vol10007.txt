Subject: Dictionary

Does anyone have information on the "English-Yiddish Encyclopedic
Dictionary" by Paul Abelson (1915)? Is it available , and worth getting?

Subject: copyright question

I'd like to know if the copyright still applies to the stories by Leah K.
Hofman in the book, Kleyne in der groyser velt, published by Farlag leben,
copyright 1920 by Noach Steinberg. Can anyone help me with this question?

Subject: Y.Kotik on corn

L.Prager in The Mendele Review Vol.04.006 discusses in detail the threshing
scene from Kotik's memoirs. I'm prone to lean towards the Assaf's Hebrew
translation. Especially taking into consideration that "korn" is rye, and
not corn (papshoy, kukuruze, mais). "Zang" is therefore a ear of rye, and
not a ear of corn (pshenitchke/kachn papshoy). Also, I would expect rye
("korn") to be threshed ON the threshing-floor (AFN toyk), and not "fun tok"
(toyk is more Yiddishized a pronounciation). The question remains: Why "dos
korn", rather than "der korn"? A local variation I guess.

Subject: Binem Heller

I am immensely touched by Binem Heller's poem (Vol 09.082).

This is the second work of his that I have come across. The first was "Mein
Shvester Chayeh," which was put to music by Chava Alberstein and the
Klezmatics on their CD, "Die Krenitseh." I was so moved by this poem that I
used it as a dedication in the translation of "The Dereczin Memorial Book"
that I have just completed and published.

I would like to know if there is a collected body of his work, and how to
obtain a copy, if possible.

Subject: geshtoygn

I am at a perfect loss, as is my usually flawless guide, Uriel Weinreich's
dictionary. A friend offered me this comment -- evidently a vortl -- in a
letter:

"Nisht geshtoygn, nisht gefloygn."

Please: What does "geshtoygn" mean?

Subject: Y. Keitelman

Dear Khevre,

Recently a scholar asked about obtaining rights from the family of Y.
Keitelman, a Yiddish writer in postwar Germany. My apologies for not
answering sooner, and for not answering directly to him/her.  Would someone
kindly forward the following to that individual, as I've lost that email
address? Thanks in advance.

The writer Y. Keitelman died of leukemia in l968 or l969.  His son, Lazar
keitelman could possibly be located on the Israeli Internet, as he moved to
Israel shortly before that time, and would be about 47 years old.  Lazar's
sister, Esther keitelman, married a French Jew and moved to Paris about
l970. (Don't know her married name).  Try advertising in Paris Jewish
community.  Her husband and his family were in business in the fashion
(leather) industry. Keitelman's brother, Keitelman, M.D., was an ob-gyn in
Brooklyn, N.Y. (Kings Highway Hospital), and his family may live in NYC
still.

Mr. Keitelman was a close friend of my father, the Yiddish journalist
Benzion Hibel, and was a frequent visitor to my home during my childhood.
He was a tall sensitive artistic gentleman, whose hobby was sculpting.  His
wife was an artist.

I hope you receive rights, and are able to share the work of this impressive
individual.  All my father's postwar Yiddish writer friends were tender,
tortured, and rare people, committed to their artistry, and stretching to
make a new life for themselves and their families.

Sincerely yours,
Olivia Hibel
(Mrs. Gershon Freidlin!)

Subject: orl

Robert Goldberg wrote that 'orl' means 'foreskin', which is not correct. He
means 'orle', which is indeed not to be found in Weinreich, but in Niborski.
He also says that 'orl' is not in Weinreich: Page 288, 'ayen-resh-lamed':
orl - areylim (cont) non-Jew. As to Weinreich being a prude, even 'scrotum'
is in.

Subject: "ershter vals"

I'm looking for information about a Yiddish song called "Ershter Vals."
It's a Russian folk tune set with Yiddish words by Chaim Towber.  The
Klezmatics have recorded it.  Apparently it's a theater song.

I'm looking for information on all aspects of the above: Yiddish folk song,
Yiddish theater music, the migration of Russian to Yiddish, etc.

Thanks!

Subject: Sholem Asch

Tayere Khaveyrim,

I am looking for a bit of bibliographic information on Sholem Asch. Where
was Got fun Nekome (God of Vengeance) published most lately? Exact year?
Who is the translator? Was the play staged recently, if so, where, and whose
translation? What was the exact title of the conference recently held at
Yale? Many thanks,

Sheva Zucker
