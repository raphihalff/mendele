Subject: Yiddish dictionaries

The work that--to my knowledge--comes closest to what Serge Rogosin describes
is the _Groyser verterbukh fun der yidisher shprakh_/_Great Dictionary of the
Yiddish Language_. Unfortunately, only the first four of a projected twelve
volumes of this work have been published (the last c. 1980); these cover all
words beginning in alef (to the innocent ear this will sound ridiculous;
however, a disproportionate number of words/spellings begin in _alef_,
including most of the words beginning in vowels). Draft entries have been
written through _hey_, if my memory serves (I know Meyer Wolf is out there in
Mendele-land; perhaps he can correct or supplement this account). The entries
that are furthest along are those beginning in _beyz_; these were to
constitute the fifth volume entirely or almost entirely. The manuscript
material is currently housed in Butler Library, Columbia University (a
duplicate of this material resides at The Hebrew University in Jerusalem).
There haven't been too many requests to look at the ms., however, those which
have been made have been honored. If I can help you find your way to this
material, let me know.

to arnie herschorn:

you say 'a language is like a species.' ok, i'll bite -- HOW is a language
like a species? imho, a language is a cognitive/social construct residing in
the minds of the people who are said to 'know' it, tho its products fill the
airwaves and the libraries, to be sure. its 'rights' cannot possibly exceed
the rights of those people in whose heads it potentially resides.

as for your eagerness to see tears, i'm not sure why you are so discounting
those chassidim for whom yiddish is alive and well. you say yiddish will have
a 'vestigial life' with them. nokh a mol with the biological metaphors! :) in
what way is it 'vestigial'? as i understand it, a vestigial organ is an organ
that has outlived its function and has deteriorated structurally such that it
no longer _can_ serve a function. clearly, this is not the case with yiddish
among the yiddish-speaking chassidim -- it's serving them just as well as any
_other_language is serving its native speakers, and there is certainly no
evidence of 'structural deterioration'. (oyf mir gezogt!)

i'm not sure what you'd wish for, if you had your druthers. you despise those
who are living the kind of life that yiddish evolved to function in ('like a
mammoth preserved in ice in the wastes of siberia' were your words) and yet
you are in deep mourning for yiddish.

your wish for a 'concept' for a language that is 'not fully alive if it is the
language of the last of the mohicans' reminds me of a hilariously funny thing
i read once. my husband is an egyptian jew, one of the many who left the arab
world (or were kicked out) after the suez war. his mother lives in brooklyn,
near many of her 'landslayt', and they have their own sephardic community
center. one day at her house, i was reading this community center's newsletter
and i read that they were starting arabic classes for children. and it said
'our children must learn arabic -- so that the language doesn't die out!'

funny, eh? obviously the scale is different here -- but i believe you are
doing the same thing they were -- for _your_ group, the language has
effectively died out -- and the others just don't count! :-) (or would you
feel better if there were 100 million yiddish-speaking chassidim in the world?
oy vey! :) )

Subject: Life and death of Yiddish

Glad Morrie Feller (V 5.238) has introduced humor into this "life or death"
question.

Recently, following my lecture (in Yiddish) to the fabled L.A. Yiddish Culture
Club (about to celebrate its 75th anniversary!), I was told another story
about Khayim Nakhman Bialik:

Once, on shabes, Bialik strolled in Tel Aviv, speaking Yiddish with his
companions. When a passerby accused him of thus "violating the sabbath,"
Bialik replied that he was actually observing the strictures against exertion
on shabes because: "af tsu redn ivris muz men zikh onshtrengen." (Speaking
Hebrew is an exertion.)

Subject: Suffix anomalies

In 5.225 and 5.236, Zellig Bach discusses a number of ways in which Yiddish
can identify as female either the holder of an occupational title or the wife
of the holder.  Along with other valuable information, Zellig notes that in
his 1968 dictionary, U. Weinreich uses the feminine suffix _-in_ [yud-langer
nun] (e.g., _neytorin_ 'seamstress'; _kishef-makherin_ 'sorceress'), though
Harkavy (1928) omits the yud (_neytorn/neytern_, _kishef-makhern_.)  Harkavy
thus appears to be more phonetically precise than Weinreich; as I understand
it, the _i_ in the suffix is so reduced when spoken that it is left out of the
pronunciation altogether, at least in "Standard" Yiddish.  Weinreich himself,
in a footnote to lesson 28.2 in his textbook (p. 262 in the 5th edition), says
"_-in_ is sounded as a syllabic (N); e.g., _leyenerin_ [LE'YENERN]."  That is,
not [LE'YENERIN].  I wonder why the standardizers, whom Weinreich follows, did
not call for dropping the yud in these words, as Harkavy did.

Another curiosity:  in view of the evident desire of the standardizers to be
systematically phonetic in the orthography of the non-loshnkoydesh-derived
lexicon, why did they not put a pasekh under the tsvey yudn in the suffixes
_-hayt_ and _-kayt_, as in _frayhayt_ and _kleynikayt_, so as to show that the
pronunciation is not _-hEYt_ or _-kEYt_?  After all, they have pasekh tsvey
yudn for the first syllable in _frayhayt_; why not for the second syllable as
well?

(Az ikh fleg fregn bay der mamen vegn epes vos ikh hob nisht farshtanen,
"Why?", flegt zi mir amol entfern " 'y' is a crooked letter.")

In personal communication, Zellig has suggested that these inconsistencies in
the spelling of Standard Yiddish may be the results of compromises among the
speakers of the several dialects represented in the standardizing group(s).
Is/was there a dialect that has _frayheyt_, or one that gives full value to
the _i_ in _neytorin_?

Subject: Letzter Mohicaner?

In 5.238, Arnie Herschorn of Toronto wrote:

"A language is not fully alive if it is the language of the last of the
Mohicans."

I'm unqualified to enter the alive-or-dead debate, but I am quite curious
about this very American phrase, which I have noticed cropping up in Yiddish
too often to be just a coincidence. When my zeyde, olevasholom, passed away in
1941, the obituary in his landsmanshaft bulletin referred to him as "one of
the last Keidaner Mohicans."

Later I was struck to hear in the film "Partisans of Vilna" an excerpt from a
partisan marching song in which the term "der letster mohikaner" is used to
rhyme with "partizaner" (sorry I can't recall the verse; efsher ken emetsn mir
helfn). Anyway, I wonder; did this bit of U.S. slang make its way back across
the ocean in time to be incorporated into 20th century Litvish Yiddish
vernacular? Ver veyst?

Subject: More Dona, Dona

It should be noted that the song--in both its Yiddish and English versions--is
included in the just-published "Apples and Honey: Music and Readings for a
Secular Humanistic Observance of the Jewish New Year Festival." The English
version includes a new verse, written at a workshop of the Conference of
Secular Jewish Organizations, publisher of the anthology. The verse, we're
told (p. 91), was written "to remove blame from the victim."

"Flying over, knowing freedom
As the swallow began to laugh;
Soaring down upon the wagon
With its beak untied the calf."

Many of the songs and readings in "Apples and Honey" are taken from Yiddish
literature and almost all of these appear in the original, in transcription
and in translation.

The large-format (8-1/2 x 11) 128 pp. book is available at US$19.95 ($3.50

Subject: Sholom Aleikhem on Tolstoi

Thank  you, Louis Fridhandler, for "giving over" that extraordinary brif of
Sholom Aleikhem.  The deeply religious Christian Tolstoi might have been even
more surprised to find himself described as a crypto-Jew than you were to see
"mortification of the flesh" on Sholom Aleikhem's list of Jewish attributes.
This is something still done in our day on Yom Kippur and numerous other days
of the years, even by the most marginally frum!

One can see how the heart of the great writer bled for his nation, and felt no
need to say that its suffering was the same as any other suffering -- indeed,
as you say, his day *was* different from ours.  The saddest part about it was
his prophetic words, albeit not the way he had hoped -- that there should
never be talk of a Pale of Settlement, or a Jewish Question.  Nebakh.

First of all, a mazl tov to the Lewis' on their forthcoming blessed event as
announced in Mendele 5.238.  In answer to their request, I would recommend
"Pregnancy, Childbirth and Early Childhood - An English-Yiddish Dictionary" by
Mordkhe Schaechter.  Published by the Yiddish Language Resource Center, League

Subject: Viazoy redt men tsu kleyninke kinderlekh?

Yankev and Yoyne-Brayne Lewis want to raise their forthcoming child (Mazl-tov
aykh; zayt ale dray gezunt un shtark!) with Yiddish, and ask about materials.

Mordkhe Schaechter (editor of _Afn Shvel_, and author of _Laytish Mame-loshn_,
_Yidish Tsvey_ and other contributions to Yiddish) has compiled from a number
of sources an excellent English-Yiddish dictionary of _Pregnancy, Childbirth
and Early Childhood/Trogn, Hobn un Friike Kinder-yorn_ (New York: League for
Yiddish, 1991).  It includes nursery-talk for a variety of terms, among them
those denoting anatomical parts.
