Subject: The Shvitz

Dear Mendeleniks -

For those of you who can get TVO (TV Ontario), you may be interested
to know that The Human Edge program entitled "The Shvitz," which
aired last night (Tuesday) will be repeated on Sunday, Nov. 7th at
9:00 p.m. on la Chaine francaise (French TVO) in English.  The
description of the program is as follows:

A tradition of Jewish immigrants, the shvitz (Yiddish for "sweat")
was once celebrated as the key to the good life.  Jonathan Berman's
humorous ode to the original steam baths portrays the unlikely
community that still enjoys the last traditional steam baths in the
U.S.

Watch for the Klezmatics' Yiddish "rap" song at the end of this one
hour program!!!

Walter Zimmerman

Subject: Introduction

A few words by way of intro: I am an associate prof. of political
science in CUNY with a long-term interest in Yiddish culture.  My
own writing has dealt primarily with the interaction between
socialists and Jews, and has included work on the reception of
socialist ideas by Yiddish-spe aking writers and activists.  I am
presently working on critical theory and the image of the Jew.

Subject: Shlogn zikh kop in vant (again)

Back in May of this year, in connection with this expression, Martin
Davis mentioned a picture by Pieter Brueghel that shows a young man
beating his head against a brick wall.  That section of Brueghel's
"Netherlandic Proverbs" (1559) is reproduced in a book just
published by Oxford University Press, Wolfgang Mieder's _Proverbs
Are Never Out of Season:  Popular Wisdom in the Modern Age_ (p. 60).
Mieder, of the University of Vermont, is one of the world's leading
paremiologists.  In his book he mentions that there have been some
40 studies of the Brueghel picture, but not all of the proverbial
expressions in it have been identified.  He recommends the
reproduction in Christopher Brown, _Brueghel_, NY:  Crescent Books,
1975, p. 11.  Mieder's book, his most recent of more than fifty,
also includes an interesting essay entitled "Proverbs in Nazi
Germany," in which he discusses "the promulgation of anti-semitism
and stereotypes through folklore."

Subject: Ashkenazic Hebrew

  I was much taken with the discussion of Ashkenazic Hebrew vowels
started by Steven Jacobson and carried on by Jeremy Stern, Dovid
Braun, Bob Hoberman, Michael Shimshoni, and perhaps a few others.
This should interest us because, as a number of you made clear, many
Jews know "Ashkenazic" pronunciation only as it has been influenced
through phonic interference by the local vernacular languages of the
Jews of Europe, including the various varieties of Yiddish.

  In fact, the underlying phonological system of Ashkenazic Hebrew
antedates all these influences of co-territorial languages.The
vowels learned by Steven in his American Sunday school were
apparently meant to simulate those of the Ashkenazic accent as it
has been transmitted by scholars; however, what must have happened
in his school, and in other congregational schools across the length
and breadth of the land, is that instead of learning the
steady-state ("pure") vowels of Hebrew, like Italian "no," American
Jewish students,prhaps along with their teachers, used the American
English diphthongized [ou] as in English "no," and so on with the
rest of the vowels. Similar remarks could be made about a number of
the consonants. (By the way, many American immigrants speaking a
rather fluent Israeli Hebrew do the same thing with that dialect and
thus have a heavy American accent.)

  Ashkenazic Hebrew in its origins is not an invention of our
European Jews.The only source I can find in a hurry is Hebrew: The
Eternal Language, by William Chomsky (Philadelphia: Jewish Pub. Soc.
of America, 1957). He says (p.112), "The available evidence points
to the assumption that the so-called Ashkenazic pronunciation really
stems from Palestine. ...This pronunciation may have been carried to
Germany and Eastern Europe,during the Middle Ages,by the Tiberian or
Palestinian teachers, whose expertness in the 'proper' pronunciation
of Hebrew was at that time generally recognized among the Jews.

  The Sephardic pronunciation ... may have been imported into Spain
from Babylon during the eighth to eleventh centuries. Indeed, the
Jewish population of Spain during that period was mainly of
Babylonian origin."
