Subject: Is the National Yiddish Book Center on the Internet?

If someone would let me (or "Mendeleyeners" at large) know whether the
National Yiddish Book Center is contactable by e-mail, I'd be most
appreciative.  Thanks in advance!

Subject: Looking for Yiddish words; Yiddish rhyming dictionary

Can someone think of a Yiddish adjectival stem that ends in -rn or -rl?
(Specifically adjectival *stems*, not derived adjectives like _a nay GEBOYRN
kind_.)  The only one I can think of is _modern_.

And can anyone give me information about a Yiddish rhyming dictionary?  (If
I'm not mistaken, Nokhem Stutshkov compiled one.  Is this right?  Are there
any others?  Do you have one that I could borrow or buy?)

Incidentally, I ask the above because I'm working on a project analyzing
Yiddish word structure -- it's not for writing poetry (although after I finish
this project, I could easily see myself writing some).

My thanks in advance!

Subject: Bokser and kharub

I find it curious that there has been no response to my query about the origin
of the Yiddish term "bokser"and how it came to be used when a (presumably)
biblical Hebrew word for "carob" existed (kharub). Are Mendelyaner linguists
too absorbed in the pluperfect?

Subject: Yiddish in Israel, February 1996

A subtle strategy is best.  It has been working effectively for some time now.
Yiddish must be lauded -- and simultaneously lowered into place.  There is no
"Yiddish culture," only "Yiddish folklore."  There is this immense body of
juicy jokes which lose their tang in translation -- "be-yidish ze metsaltsel
yoter tov" ('it sounds better in Yiddish'). One cannot praise you blacks
enough for your musical talent and you women for your maternal touch.  Yiddish
is funny; the very name Yiddish puts one in stitches.

It is Wednesday morning, February 7th, 1996, on the Voice of Israel and Dalia
Meiri, hostess-commentator-interviewer-gossip galore of a popular talk show is
chattering away in her typically flippant manner about the morning's
offerings.  These will include the subject of Yiddish, for that morning
Yiddish is to be discussed in the Knesset's Education Committee.  Meiri
gleefully introduces the subject with the question, "Ma, hayidish adayin
chay?"  ('What, is Yiddish still alive?').  Her tone of unbridled hilarity is
matched by that of her male sidekick (stooge?)

Shocked listeners like myself had not caught on as to what the joke was, but
those in the know knew the joke was Yiddish.  It was soon clear that the
interviewee, Gershon Viner, Chairman of the World Council for Yiddish, was at
least as obtuse as I was.  Meiri persistently -- indeed, obsessively and
repellingly -- pestered Viner to "tell us a joke in Yiddish."  He replied that
this was not the occasion -- doubtless presuming (as who would not?) that the
interview was tied to the serious deliberations regarding Yiddish being held
that very morning in the nation's highest tribunal.  But Meiri insisted again
and again:  "Tell us a Yiddish joke, tell us a juicy Yiddish joke, we want a
joke, a joke, a joke."  Viner ignored Meiri's sick request with dignity.

Lying in bed with a monster cast on my broken ankle -- which explains why I
had turned on the radio in the first place -- I heard a voice (could it have
been my own?) shouting:  "Barabolikhe, plaplerke, leptshikhe, yakhne,
moylmakherin, kalekotnitse, yentushke, rekhilesnitse!"

Zoln ameratsim un yidishfaynt khotsh visn as yidish iz an ernst inyen un in
yidish ken men zidlen un shnidlen un nisht nor zikh vitslen!

Subject: American English _chutzpah_

Most instances of general English _chutzpa/chutzpah_ (the apparently preferred
American English spellings) that one sees these days carry a positive sense in
direct contrast to their pejorative meanings in both Yiddish (_khutspe_) and
Hebrew (_chutspa_).  As the instance below indicates, this shift is not
universal.  The word _nerve_ as used below preserves the full force of Hebrew
_chutspa_ and Yiddish _khutspe_. However, we should note that the editor of
_Maledicta_, Reinhold Aman (a native speaker of Bavarian German) knows
Yiddish.  (Indeed, his maverick journal is full of Yiddish items.)  Recently
released from prison for allegedly dangerous verbal behavior, the editor of
"The International Journal of Verbal Aggression" (P.O.  Box 14123, Santa Rosa,
CA 95402-6123, USA  (707) 523-4761) is now open again for business. You can
get a copy of Abraham A. Roback's _A Dictionary of International Slurs_ (lots
of Yiddish) from Maledicta Press quite cheaply.

Subject: Myron Cohen recording

Louis Fridhandler asks about recordings of comedian Myron Cohen.  Two of his
monologues  -- "Idle Conversation" and "Swimming Pool Story" appear on a
cassette called "20th Century Yiddish Humor," put out by Banner Records, POB
1516, Boynton Beach, FL 33436.  I ordered it from Workmen's Circle, 45 East
33rd St., NY NY 10016.

The pieces are really funny.  The one I like best is about a woman who has
recently made it into a more refined crowd.  To impress her sophisticated new
friends, she claims she saw Mozart getting on the Number 5 bus to the beach.
On the way home, her husband yells at her:  "You know perfectly well the
Number 5 doesn't go to the beach."

Other comedians on the tape include Billy Hodes, Radio Aces, Larry Best,
George Jessel, Leo Fuchs, Leslie Brothers.
