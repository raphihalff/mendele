Subject: Israel Narodiczky

Recently I came across a copy of a book entitled _Jewish
Books in Whitechapel: a Bibliography of Narodiczky's Press_
compiled by Moshe Sanders and edited by Marion Aptroot.
(London, Duckworth, 1991). Narodiczky apparently was the
chief Hebrew/Yiddish printer in London in the first half of
the twentieth century and his life, as traced by Aptroot in
her introduction, is fascinating.

If Aptroot is listening in now, or if there is a "Mendele"
in England who is in contact, I have discovered a letter
written by Narodiczky in the period prior to his emigration
to England.

Subject: Maurice Schwartz

One of my favorite memories was seeing Maurice Schwartz
play the lead in "Shylock's Tokhter" on Second Avenue in
New York in the late 1940s. This was a wonderful Ghetto-eye
view rather different from Shakespeare's (though the "hath
not a Jew eyes" speech was translated quite literally). The
climax occurs when Portia's courtroom sophistries are
trumped by those of a brilliant young Yeshiva bokher, and
the judge reluctantly tells Shylock to proceed to cut his
pound of flesh. Maurice Schwartz picked up his knife, held
it aloft, and then shouted (they must have heard him on
Times Square) "Ikh ken nit! Ikh bin a yid!"

A couple of years ago I saw him in the wonderful film UNCLE
MOSES (mentioned by Ellen Prince) at a Jewish film festival
in San Francisco. (I am often in the Bay Area during the
summer.) As we were leaving the theatre, I heard a young
woman saying,"That's a fine little actor." I couldn't
resist informimg her that "that is no little actor, that is
the great Maurice Schwartz!"

Subject: Yiddish songs (margaretkas)

My favorite is a lovely song my mother used to sing about
the seduction of a girl who is looking for daisies
(margaretkas) in the woods. She is approached by "a bokher,
a shlanke" who informs her "di zukhst nokh; 'khob shoyn
gefinen. Di sheynste margaretke in vald." The lad easily
overcomes the girl's scruples (Di mama zogt, mi tur nit).

In the final stanza:

Di zun is fergangen
Der bokher fershwinden,
Un Khayele bleybt nokh in vald.
zi benkt nokh dem bokher, 
un zingt zikh dos lidele,
tra-la-la-laa la.

Subject:  "YIVO for Sale?"

Responding to JJ/Yankel's query of July 14, the answer is
yes, the YIVO building is for sale, through Sotheby's.
YIVO is currently negotiating over another site, elsewhere
in Manhattan, which should offer us more and better space,
along with such amenities as air conditioning (lacking at
1048 Fifth Avenue). The Institute ran out of space for its
collections on these premises approximately 25 years ago.
It is the view of both the YIVO Board and Staff that the
present site has served its purpose and it is time to move
to more appropriate quarters.

Subject: Query

I am working on a translation of a Hebrew article by Shmuel
Ettinger on the social and legal status of Jews in Ukraine
before 1648. The article contains a quotation from an early
Yiddish source about Cossack raids. The source mentions
that many Jews were killed "hinter dem nepr." The last word
is spelled nun-ayin-pey-reish. Does anyone know the meaning
of "nepr?" Thanks.
