Subject: Introduction

Mayn nomen iz Avi Hoffman un ikh voyn in 'Nev York', un ikh bin a naye
mitglid fun 'cybervelt'....  I am an actor/director in NY and have spent
many years doing shows on Jewish/Yiddish themes.  I have been involved in
many Yiddish productions, most notably the Joseph Papp production of
'Songs of Paradise - Lider fun Gan Eydn' at the NY Shakespeare Festival.
I grew up in the Bronx in the 60's, part of the Yiddishist group of
families that congregated at the Sholem Aleichem Folkshul #21 on
Bainbridge Ave. I lived in Israel for several years, but have been back
in the US since '77. I am currently starring in a 'one-mensch' musical
Off-Broadway at the Houseman Theater on 42nd st. entitled - "Avi
Hoffman's Too Jewish ?" - all about my life in the Bronx, my experiences
with the Yiddish theatre/vaudeville and what it's like growing up as a
Yiddish speaking Jew who is proud of his culture and heritage.  The show
has been very well received, wonderful reviews, sold out houses - It's
been running for four months already and my producer just asked me if we
could extend through September !!!

Anyway,  I'm excited too have found this Yiddishe E-Mail Vinkl (or is it
OY-Mail) <g>, I hope to hear from you with some information on how I can
become a part of your BBS's...

Avi (Avrum Ber) Hoffman

Subject: Why Study Yiddish?

Ver volt zikh forgeshtelt az men ken benkn nokh vayse papirn mit
shvartzinke oisyelekh, E-Mail fun Mendeleniks. Azoi iz geven di letzte
por vokhn far mir in Chicago. Eyder ikh bin avek, hob ikh ongefirt a
program in undzer Yiddish club, "Yiddish in the Air - On Mendele and PBS"
tzulib Matt Dailey's oisergevenlekher posting, "Why Study Yiddish?"

First, I edited down the PBS program, "Shlemiel, Shlimazl and Dopess" for
a half-hour viewing, and discussion; then I explained Mendele and read
Matt's poetic, hartzike posting (dividing it for presentation by four
dramatic readers, leaving the last paragraph for me to savor as I
emoted).

As I looked up at the audience, several bubbes with tears streaming down
their cheeks, everyone else intense and farkisheft, I too shed some proud
tears and then completed the paragraph. Better than the applause were the
many requests for copies of the reading - to savor again its hopefulness,
to send to their children, etc. Thank you, Mendele, (and Matt), for a
night to remember.

Subject: The Yivo Find in Lithuania

Dan Leeson asks for verification of the CNN broasdcast about Yivo.

Mashe Leon in the Forward of March 3, quotes Allan Nadler, the director
of research, about the new material shipped to New York, "When I first
saw this material in 1993, it was a mess. The pages were in horrible
condition with leaves and dirt and mud. The Lithuanians cleaned it up a
bit, then stamped every page with their stamp and numbered every page -
so they can get everything back. That's the deal I signed with them. That
we just weant to borrow it, to microfilm it, preserve it and put it in
order...then we will send it back. We have a schedule."

It appears CNN was more than vaguely correct.

Subject: Third International Yiddish Club Conference

Preliminary arrangements have been made for the next Intl. Yiddish Club
Conference to be held in Southeast Florida. The Greater Miami Area won
out among five areas considered by The International Yiddish Club
Conference Committee.

Friday afternoon March 1, 1996 the conference will start, and go through
a noon buffet on Monday March the 4th. Sponsoring host for the Conference
is The Circle of Yiddish Clubs. Ruth Barlas and Sunny Landsman are the
Chairperson and Vice-chairs respectively. David Barlas is Co-ordinator
and Will Stern Honorary Chairperson.

Official information will come from the hosts and be released by the four
Yiddish club newsletters; Der Bay (San Francisco), Dos Bletl (Toronto),
Undzer Shtime (S.E. Florida), Yiddish of Greater Washington, (Wash. DC
area) and Mendele online. Readers of these news sources represent a key
segment of the Yiddish community teachers, "club leaders", and Klezmer
band leaders.

Subject: Bi-lingual coincidence?

Morrie Feller writes:

  The Spanish sentence is: Aqui esta una mesa?  Which means: Where is a
  table?  The Yiddish sentence is: A key est un a meser. A cow eats
  without a knife.

The Spanish phrase isn't quite correct, nor is its translation.
The verb usually comes first in a questioon, so it would be: Esta aqui
una mesa?  The correct meaning is: Is there a table here?  The Yiddish
sentence is correct.  :-)
