Subject: Mani Leyb's _Yidish_

For Bertha Berman's request in Mendele Vol 11.013 :

The song she seeks is _Yidish_ by Mani Leyb, with music by H. Volovitsh
who was my beloved music teacher in East Flatbush Shul 1 in Brooklyn in
the late 30s and early 40s.

Volovitch instilled a love of Yiddish and music and peoplehood in all
who received the treasure of learning from him, or knowing him. His
body, misshapen like that of Moses Mendelson, housed a mind and soul
that were strong and even gigantic. He could make our old, donated,
broken-down piano whisper or shout to us.

The song (poem):

di velt iz ful mit reydn,
es redt dokh yede zakh.
un yeder oyf zayn shteyger
un yeder oyf zayn shprakh.

yidn redn yidish
in ale, ale ekn velt.
in afrike in heyser
un in sibirer kelt.

yidn redn yidish,
vayl yidish iz dokh sheyn,
men ken a tsveytn yidn
farshteyn vi zikh aleyn.

yidn redn yidish
in ale, ale ekn velt.
in afrike in heyser
un in sibirer kelt.

Subject: song about Yiddish

Bertha A. Berman asked for a song about Yiddish that she learned in the
Workmen's Circle shule in the 1940's.  We still sang it in the 1960's
in Workmen's Circle Shule 3 in the Bronx, where we had the good fortune
to have Khane Mlotek as our music teacher.  I couldn't remember all the
words, but I found them in a small songbook called Mir Zingen,
published by the Workmen's Circle in 1951.

Yiddish
Mani Leyb, H. Volovitz

Di velt iz ful mit redn
Es redt dokh yede zakh
Un yeder oyf zayn shteyger
Un yeder oyf zayn shprakh
(repeat last two lines)

Chorus:
Yidn redn yidish
In ale ale ekn velt
In afrike in heyser
Un in siberer kelt

Yidn redn yidish
Vayl yidish iz dokh sheyn
Men ken a tsveytn yidn
Farshteyn vi zikh aleyn
(repeat last two lines)

Chorus (as above)

Zingt gezunterheyt!

Subject: song "Yidish"

I can't be the only Mendelyaner to answer regarding the song "Yidish"
as taught in the Arbeter-Ring shuln in the 1930s-1940s.  The song was
written by Volovitsh (first name escapes me) and the words are as
follows:

Di velt iz ful mit redn,
Es redt dokh yeder zakh.
Un yeder af zayn shteyger
Un yeder af zayn shprakh.

CHORUS:

Un yidn redn yidish
af ale-ale ekn velt.
In afrike in heyer
un in sibirer kelt.

Un yidn redn yidish,
Vayl yidish iz dokh sheyn
s'iz gring a'yedn yidn
Farshteyn vi zikh aleyn

CHORUS:

I learned the song when, at aged 3, my older brother/baby-sitter,
Shimen, dragged me along to gezang (singing-class) with Lerer Matlin,
at the AR Shul in Bensonhurst.  When my father, Volf Beckler, z'l, had
"slack" (temporary unemployment)  he was the disciplinarian, who kept
order, so the lerer could lern.  It was one of the first songs I
learned.

Subject: Warshavsky's "Peysakh"

Does anyone have the music for Warshavsky's song "Peysakh", which
begins:

--Ikh vel aykh dertseyln do, kinder, a mayse,
Vos s'hot zikh getrofen, oy hert oys do mikh!
    Vos s'hot zikh getrofen,
    Vos s'hot zikh farlofen --
--"Oy vey, zeydenyu, oy, vey zeydenyu, mir heren dikh!"

I have a copy of his book Yidishe folks-lider (mit tsvey forredes fun
sholem-aleykhem) from 1918, and it indicates that most of the songs
included have notation somewhere.  Does anyone have the music for these
poems?

a dank in foroys,

Can Mendelyaners provide some Yiddish suggestions for "lap-top"

A dank.

From: geofeld@juno.com
Subject: jitney

I'm looking for the etymology of the word "jitney."  The dictionaries I
have consulted say the ultimate origin is unknown or obscure, but the
meaning does derive from a slang use of the word meaning a nickel, a 5
cent piece, the original cost of the ride.  One dictionary suggested a
connection to the French "jeton," meaning a token.  However, _A
Dictionary of Americanisms on Historical Principles_ cites an
intriguing quotation from the Nation Magazine of 1915: "The word
'jitney' . . . is the Jewish (sic) slang term for a nickel."

Can anyone elaborate on a Yiddish or Jewish connection?
