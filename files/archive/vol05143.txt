Subject: Sholem Aleichem Street

Iosif Vaisman mentions several ex-Soviet cities with streets named for
Sholem Aleichem and one for Perets Markish, as testament to the power &
fame of Yiddish writers even in the Soviet era.

I don't know if it exactly counts, but I noticed an A. Mapu street in the
old section of Kaunas (Kovno) when I was there last spring.

Subject: Sholem Aleichem Street

Iosif Vaisman expressed  his pleasure that there will be  now a Sholem
Aleichem Street in  New York, and lists several towns in Ukraine, that
had such streets in the 1920-1950.

Vaisman then  adds that he  knows only  of one other  Yiddish literary
name "on  the map",  namely that  of Perets Markish  who has  a street
named after him in his Podolia.

I am sure that it may please many  of our readers to know that in many
towns of Israel  there are streets after Sholem Aleichem.   My city of
Rehovot is, alas,  an exception in that, but we  proudly have a street
named  after this  list's "patron  saint" Mendele (and one  after Y.L.
Perets).

Michael Shimshoni

P.S.  In  Haifa there is a  street named  after Perets Markish (and of
course those named after S.A. and after Mendele).

Subject: How to _nab_ in Yiddish?

Either I missed it or no one has suggested pakn as a Yiddish word for
_nab_, _catch hold of_, etc.  Pakn differs from khapn as I sense it.
Khapn happens after a chase.  Pakn can as well, but for me it almost
carries the sense of an ambush, or at least the one gepakt is surprised
by the event.

Khapn also carried the sense of kidnap when the infamous kidnappers of
Jewish boys for the cantonist army of Nicholas I were called khapers.
Unfortunately, many of the victims (or their families) were not too
surprised.  It was a generally known custom for decades before Alexander
II stopped the practice in 1856.

Subject: Khapn

Am I not correct in remembering that those men who captured Jewish children
for eventual conscription in the Russian army during the mid-1800s
were referred to as Khappers?

Subject: Tell me it ain't so

Paul Pascal suggests (though with a smiley face) that Zellig Bach's
interview with Colin Powell might be a fabrication.

Tell me it ain't so.  His Yiddish was so excellent that I saw him in
quite a different perspective.  But tell me I was not fooled. Zellig
would not have done that to me, would he have?

Subject: Avade "yo"

a)  I'm puzzled by Paul Pascal's comment (5.141,4) in connection with my
"exclusive" interview in Yiddish with General Colin Powell (5.139).

Paul writes that the single word "yo," in my answer to a question by the
General, "gave away" the fact that the whole interview was but a
fictional event, because instead of the traditional litvish-yidish "ye" I
used "the African-American slang 'yo'."

Well, why in the world would I suddenly use an idiom from Black English?
Let me assure the entire Mendele khavruse that _ye_ and _yo_ are equally
correct in Lithuanian Yiddish, with the single difference that _yo_ is
occasionally more emphatic, as if spoken with an exclamation point.

My "yo" answer in the "interview" had nothing to do with African-American
slang (nor with Sylvester Stallone's gruff "yo" and his muttered
'signature' sound).

b)  Another khaver Mendelyaner, a personal good friend of mine, called me
to tell that he, too, initially thought that my interview with the
General was the "real McCoy" until he came to the passage where I stated
that I went to Colin Powell's residence in McLean, Virginia.  Knowing
that for reasons of health I do not travel, he realized that the whole
journalistic "scoop" was a friendly, humorous hoax.

Well, there are always some unintended, hidden ways by which one gives
oneself away in a light-hearted feuilleton but, in this case, not by a
"yo"...
