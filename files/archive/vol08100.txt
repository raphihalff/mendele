Subject: non Jewish use of Yiddish

Larry Rosenwald asks about the occurance of non Jews using Yiddish
before
WWII, Mendele 8.098).

In pre WWII Bronx there were densely Jewish neighborhoods that
abutted
Italian, Irish or other territories. Though we boys had sporadically
stormy
relations, many of the merchants, i.e.: vegetable vendors, grocers,
druggists (We never called them pharmacists), etc. served
neighboring eths.
Non Jews frequently became adept not only at the specialized
vocabularies of
their trades in their customers' languages, but often gained a
working use
of proste spoken Yiddish. A similar source of cross-fertilization was
the
needle trades. First generation Italian and Yiddish speakers often
worked
side by side in the same shops. 

I had a Sephardic-Greek colleague, also from the Bronx, who
learned Yiddish
while working in his family vegetable store. (Not a non Jew, but a
similar
process.) My mother, who was dark complexioned, was frequently
mistaken for
Italian by Jewish vendors, sometimes to their acute
embarrassment, as when
they inadvertently revealed some slick stratagem.  It wasn't a
melting pot,
but much closer to it in spirit, I think, than more formal educational
programs.

Subject: 1. Non-Jews & Yiddish; 2. _khoyzek_

1. Marginally relevant to Larry Rosenwald's query (8.098) about the
non-Jewish use of Yiddish:  Scholarly interest in Yiddish can be
traced back
at the very least to the mid 15th century. From then on, and until
the late
19th century, with the single exception of the 16th century scholar,
Elias
Levita (Elye Bokher), Yiddish scholarship was exclusively the
province of
non-Jewish scholars. 

2. Elozor Oisher (8.098) asks about the word _khoyzek_ 'derision'.
It is NOT
a word of Hebrew origin although it is one of several words that are
given
a "hebreoid" spelling in Yiddish (like _baln_ 'interested person',
'volunteer', and names like _kalman_ and _zalman_). I have a
recollection
that I saw (or heard)  _khoyzek_ attributed to Northern German,
but I've
been unable to verify this. Is there anyone out there who can?

Subject: bud

Re. Aaron Krishtalka's questions:

It seems to me that the use of "hobn" has a lot to do with Polish.
The very
explicit "Ikh hob 'em in tokhes", for instance, is a perfect carbon
copy of
the Polish "mam go wdupie" (same meaning). It works with most of
the other
Yiddish expressions I can think of. 

As to the "Bud", it is not only the location of the silly and stupid, as
Reb
Krishtalka wrote. In the European tradition going back to the Middle
Ages,
it was THE place for the bawdy (baud, in Old French, at least
according to
Webster). As good Jewish boys don't know because they don't go
there, in
places where you have prostitutes, you also usually have their
pimps and
related con men. So when one says "gey in bud arayn", the obvious
meaning is
"get off my back". But the less obvious, and probably unthought of
by the
speaker himself, has to do with either a sexual or an ill-wishing
connotation. In any case, wishing that someone be in hot waters is
never a
nice thing to say. 

As we know, Rashi was also a French wine grower living in the city
of Troyes
in Champagne (no, he didn't invent the bubbly drink). His
commentary of the
Talmud is studded with 11th century French words written in
Hebrew letters,
so that nowadays, non-Jewish scholars studying Ancient French read
Rashi to
know how those words were then pronounced. Which brings me to
my query: has
Rashi ever written something about the "baud" ?  Has sending
someone to the
"bud" anything to do with a word of Rashi's commentary ?

Subject: bud

Apologies for writing on a borderline topic, but all this talk of
shvitses
makes me wonder if anyone can suggest a good resource: 

My family (maternal side) owned Daniel's Shvitsbud (sp?), possibly
the
largest shvits in Pittsburgh (closed in the '70s, I think). My
grandmother
worked there many years, making sandwiches, preparing towels.
She told me
what many of you already know; the people from the country came
to the city
for a shvits once a week (leading to the citified prejudice that only
"hicks," or dumb people went to the bathhouse?) 

Two questions:

1) Mickey Katz sang about a bath house in "Shvitsburgh,
Pennsylvania"--would
that have been about Daniel's? Or were there a whole bunch in
Pittsburgh? 

2) Does anyone know of a book that addresses the history of the
shvits?  (We
do have a marvelous documentary video, "The Shvits.") 

Thanks,

Subject: Songs from long ago

Over 50 years ago, my late, beloved mother-in-law, Clara Brody
Z'L, spent a
lot of time teaching me her beloved Yiddishe songs from her
girlhood in
Grodno, Poland.  To this day, the words remain fresh in my mind
and I'm
curious to know whether other Mendelers remember these words. 

A sukkele a kleine fhun bretelach gemaine, vos ich hob alain
oifgeboyet,
Ich badeck dem dach mit a bissele schach, ich zits mir in sukkele
bynacht.
Dee vinten dee kalte zai blozen durch dee shpalten und dee lichtlach
zay
leshen zich ois,
Ich mach nit kein chidish, ich mach mein kiddush,
Ich zits meir in sukkele bynacht.
Tu zaizhe nisht kein naar, un hobzhe nish kein tsar,
Der vint vet dee sukka nit umvarfen,
Fil tseitens veln kumen, fil vintens veln brumen,
Dee sukkele vet shtain oifn ort.

Subject: Mendele as a restrictive club

Since I was addressed in Mr. Horwitz's diabribe, I feel a need to
response
for myself and maybe others. 

"Reb" Horwitz, at sixty years old, I don't feel that my enjoyment of
my
forebearers tongue is enough to engage myself in YIVO or going
back to
kheder. I didn't realize how restrictive this Mendele club was.  Kind
of
reminds me of the social clubs here in Alabama. 

I enjoyed yiddish on the stages of the Second Avenue Theatre with
the comedy
of Menashe Skulnick, Molly Picon and Maurice Evans in the early
forties.
They didn't require a diploma in yiddish before entering the
theater... only
the price of a ticket.  In the same neighborhood, my father took his
sons to
the Russian shvitz where the men giving us "double Plaitzas" spoke
a less
than literate yiddish. We came in naked and we exited with a few
new yiddih
words. No one showed us the door because of our verb-conjunctions
weren't
perfect. 

Perhaps Mr. Horwitz can suggest a website that will rid him of us
inferior
lovers of Yiddish, so that we may enjoy the company of those that
would
accept our love, though limited, of the language.  I repeat what I
said
before. My grandparents spoke only Yiddish, and were the illiterate
women of
Poland at the turn of the century. They conversed with each other
and with
others as well and weren't afraid to speak with the type of snob that
might
leave mendele if subscribers like me stay.

Subject: Newcomers

I happen to be a Sefardic Jew (a Puerto Rican Jew to be exact) who
has spent
the last semester trying very hard to learn Yiddish.  You see, there
is a
one semester class of Yiddish offered at Syracuse University.
Although I
really do not have any roots to the language, I do have roots in
Judaism.
Growing up in the United States as a Sefard can be very difficult.
My
synogauge in Newark, Delaware was mixed with everyone from
orthodox to
reform, sefardic to ashkenazic.  That made it a little easier, but the
US
(and Syracuse University) are predominantly Ashkenazic. Anyway,
back to my
point. I took this class because I felt like I was losing my Jewishness
in
college.  I don't really have time for services or Hillel, so I felt like I
was losing my community. We are a very tight community in my
hometown.  I
saw this course and decided to take it, because it offered me a piece
of
myself that I am missing in college.  You all are worrying about
spelling
things gramatically correct and if things should be translated.  Well,
I am
telling you, as the future of Judaism and Yiddish, this pettiness does
not
matter. Yiddish has always been a spoken language, allowed to take
turns and
adopt phrases as it pleases.  Let it continue on this path.  I know
very few
phrases and some of them don't help me at all;  like, Lomir
shpatsirn bam
yam.  Unless I am near a beach, I will never use that!  But that is
aside
the point.  I enjoy learning Yiddish and reading stories by IL Peretz
and
Sholem Aleichem. So what if my grammar isn't perfect and I need
your
translations to understand most of the passages you all are writing,
at
least I am trying.  At least I am on this list serve.  Remember, I am
your
future.  Do you want to shun me or help me?

Subject: Trier - Dreyves

Ane Kleine calls the German town of Trier "Trier" in Yiddish.
Actually the
Yiddish name is "Dreyves" from Latin "Treves." modern French
"Tre^ves".  I
don't mind if Germans mispronounce the names of their towns--for
instance
Koeln (Cologne) from Latin "Colonia" or Braunschweig from earlier
"Brunswick"  But I do wish they'd respect the Yiddish names of
towns.  I
realize that Trier has to some extent displaced "Dreyves" in Yiddish,
but
why shouldn't the Yiddish term be strengthened and employed?  it's
gone down
in history as the Alsatian name Dreyfus--as in Captain Alfred.  But
think of
the fun you can have making Karl Marx turn over in his grave.
Marx, who was
born in Trier and whose letters to his parents were in Western
Yiddish,
didn't much like Jews.  So imagine his reaction if he were told he
was born
in "Dreyves."  (I forgive him though because he was a dazzling
stylist in
German.)

Subject: "aynfarshtendik"

To Joachim Neugroschel: I agree that "aynfarshtendik" is not
German at all
but of Germanic origin. In fact, I was actually criticizing the purist
tendency to do away with good Yiddish words because they sound
"too German".
Maybe you misunderstood my original posting.
