Subject: Takeh

Anatole Beck rules out a czech origin for take=indeed in yiddish, since
tak (cz.) seems too far away.  but there is also, take (with an accent on
the final e) which means even, as in _i take_ = and even ; this would
seem closer to yiddish take, since both words indicate emphasis. (my
czech is somewhat old, so I apologize in advance for faulty memory.)

There is 'pisherl' for penis, and 'mayse' or 'oyse mokem' for vagina. I'm
sure we will get other words from mendeleniks, and explanations.  I will
forbear with mine.

Anatole Beck asks:

There is a Yiddish bible commentary called "Ivri Taitsh" which I think
satisfies the query.

I think that's the old line.  The more modern one (I can't remember to
whom to attribute it, but I heard him speak at Ohio State a number of
years ago.  Neil?  Dovid?) has as its basis the southern German dialect
around Regensburg, on the Danube.  This was based on a detailed study of
German dialectology and a comparison with various features of Yiddish as
they contrast with Rhenish (and with standard Hochdeutsch).

Subject: number agreement (warning: long post!)

no, mikhl, my father was definitely not a litvak. (kha kha kha!) i'll put
it on the list of things to check out with my uncle (his brother) in tel
aviv this june. by the way, the examples you give (mayne shikh iz
gemakht...) do not really occur in royte pomerantsn tho there are many
singular verbs with plural POSTPOSED subjects. here's a complete list.
(the number refers to the number of the anecdote.)

ok, now here's the complete list of singular agreement with a plural
subject with the subject in initial position:

neyn, keyn eyer iz grod nit faran in shtub (209)

i don't think we have to be great statisticians to conclude that there's
some relation between postposed subjects and lack of number agreement,
wouldn't you say? any thoughts?

Even two summers ago when I was at the YIVO Weinreich Summer Program I'd
heard talk of the end of Klez camp, the issue was money..no money...no
camp.  Sad....

Subject: Ansky exhibit

In response to Lewis Leavitt's query in MENDELE 3.276, whether "there is
to be an exhibit 'somewhere in Europe' of recently recovered material
from Ansky's ethnographic expedition of 75 years ago":

In 1992 the Joods Historisch Museum of Amsterdam did indeed mount such an
exhibit.  The published catalogue, "Tracing An-sky: Jewish collections
from the State Ethnographic Museum in St. Petersburg," edited by Mariella
Beukers and Renee Waale (Zwolle: Waanders Uitgevers, 1992), is fairly
widely available.  It includes some striking objects and photographs.

The Ansky exhibit traveled from Amsterdam to Jerusalem (Israel Museum),
and is scheduled to open shortly at the Jewish Museum, New York -- sorry,
I don't yet have the dates on that. Zachary Baker

Subject: Counting Jews at a Minyon & shimmelekha

The origin of avoiding the use of actual numbers is probably Exodus 30.12
where Moses counts shekels submitted rather than heads to avoid a plague.
I always assumed that when children drew a circle on someone's back and
said "I make a shimmelakhle and someone hides" they really meant to say
"shmule lekhle", meaning a small hole.

Sidelight on the word "sargenes": the word for "coffin" in German is
"Sarg".

Subject: farsheydns

I too was under the impression that _feygele_ came from Eng. _fag_ only
on American soil.  Daniella HarPaz's note that Mod Heb uses _parpar_
makes me think, though:  what are the slang terms in Russian, Polish? One
of the Yiddish words for _butterfly_ is _zumer-feygele_.  If Russian or
Polish use 'butterfly' equivalents, we'd have a story for Yiddish
incorporating those forms and passing them on to Hebrew (or Heb getting
them directly from Russian or Polish).

I second Elye Katz's etymology/explanation of _shmolyares_  -- this was
my conclusion, too.  And I too have only heard the word with [o] and not
"oo" (whatever Roth meant by that) -- even from Southern Yiddish
speakers.

To Dvosye Bilik:  I've recorded a version of "a gutn purim malekh" with
the beginning:

	a gitn pi:rem malokh
	vi akh gay fal okh
		('a gutn purim malekh, vu ikh gey fal ikh')

from a Polish informant.  By the way, who is the "malekh" addressed in
the song?  One hypothesis (I don't remember whether this is Max
Weinreich's or Y.L. Cahan's in a footnote to Cahan's book, cited by
Robert Rothstein):

	a gitn pirem ale a:kh -->  ...piremalekh --> ...pirem malekh

I don't think there is any deep historical explanation to shprintse-leye.
Numerous actual names have become pejorativized to denote characters,
personality types.  On the male side there's khayim-yankl and perhaps
others which don't come to mind immediately.  On the female side, there's
yente and yakhne, 2 previously neutral names.  And then some names, whose
distribution I don't know about, but seem to have lost connection to any
specific person (but presumably were connected to some specific female):
in my family (Yiddish-speakers from Northern Poland, between Bialystok
and Grodno) a snotty or spiteful girl is called a khane-sime [xanesi'mi]
and a 'yakhne/yente' is called a khaye-sose [xajso'si]. I've heard of
other such 'types' from Jews of other regions, but I can't access the
notes right now.  I betcha other readers will be able to identify such
names being used for types, without being able to identify
