I believe the point isn't that the "baynkes" were dead, but rather
the person to whom it was (metaphorically) proposed to apply them.
In other words, literally:

It will help as much as applying cups to a dead person.

just wanted to point out that they were not limited to eastern
europe and asia--for example, i know they were used in france and
are called _ventouses_ in french.

it's not dead cups--it's 'a dead person [dative]' cups'--it helps like
cups [help] a dead man. that is, it doesn't help at all.

Subject: The geography joke

An early form of this joke stems from pre-WWII, post Hitler Germany.
The Jew at an immigration office finds all of the gates to other
countries closed and aske for another globe, please. See, The Big
Book of Jewish Humor (section 2 /Jewish/goyish).

Subject:   idioms

I don't know how others do it, I can barely keep up with reading
mendele, let alone to react. (This is _not_ a complaint) I promise
to post a question real soon for non-linguists, historians,
bibliographers, and literary experts (not necessarily in this
order), but since idioms, curses and proverbs are my favorites, let
me contribute some comments.

1. The "flying Frenchman"

Katriel Leibovic (3.016#4) was mislead by the transcription of the
word, rosl does not have a zayin, but a samekh, therefore it cannot
mean a rose. Bernstein derives it from polish "rosol (brine?)" in
the second half of his collection (#191), thanks to M. Waldoks for
reminding us about its existence.

A yasher ko'ach to Dovid Braun for reminding us of the original form
of the idiom. In disagreement with Eli Katz, and with no more
authority, let me guess that the Frenchman _is_ the origin of the
idiom, and in case it is not clear to everybody, let me add that it
must be about that Frenchman who visited Russia, and who was
referred to by his Jewish admirers as "helek tov" (Buona parte).

2. Pandera, Pantera appears on Shabbat 104b, as a reference to
Joseph, the carpenter.

3. CPR for a dead man

H. L. Orbach speculates about the meaning of "toyten bankes"
(3.020#1). It seems to me, that the word "toyten" is not a modifier
of "bankes" but the subject of the procedure. Bernstein has the
following two expressions (#1201-2):
"es helft, vi a toyten an 'el mole rakhamim'"
"es helft, vi a toyten bankes".

4. The Queen is naked

Sh Axelrod (3.013#5) is in good company, Bernstein quotes "A terets
far di bentshlikht" as an irrelevant answer, and admits that he has
no idea what's going on. The second half (Vashti's toothache) is
very frustrating, I remember the whole issue being discussed in a
footnote somewhere. Last week, while searching for chomets I checked
all the footnotes in my apartment, but couldn't find this one. Of
course, the Midrash, Talmud, Targum is filled with stories about the
matter, but I couldn't locate any mentioning of teeth, only a tail.
(Megilla 12b)

On this occasion let me throw in the idea that somebody (perhaps an
MA student?) should sit down and create an index to all the works of
Dov Sadan. He has so much information hidden in footnotes and other
places that this would be a great contribution to the study of E.
European Jewry. (I know, I know, some of you will ask gently, why
don't I take this task upon myself?)

Subject: Farshidens

For Len and Lisa Duhl re Yiddish lullabies: Dov Noy is, of course
the primary source- see his multi volume collection of Yiddish folk
songs.  Another is Toby Dobkin who has been working on the folklore
of the Holocaust for a number of years. YIVO knows how to reach her.

Yes, all you literary Mendelnikes there are many more of us  around
than you think but literary inyonim cannot be done vi di mame hot
gezogt "fitch mitch." Un mir layenen Opotoshn, Nadirn, Kulbakn un
azoy vayter.

I am off to Paris in part to visit the Vladimir Medem library and
then to London to see what they have in the new  Yiddish library
there. I attended the memorial for our beloved khaver, Irving Howe
and was most moved by Abe Brumberg's reading in Yiddish of poems by
Moyshe Leyb Halperin, Mani Leib and Kadye Molodovsky.

Zaytzhe mir ale gezunt.
