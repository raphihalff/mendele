Subject: Schindler's List and Greek Jews

In response to recent letters concerning "Schindler's List," I must say
that I, too, was suprised by Spielberg's choice of "Yerushalayim shel
zahav" rather than a Yiddish song.  However, considering the DPs
tremendous committment to a Jewish state in Palestine, especially since no
country wanted them after the Holocaust, it seems to be fitting.

In the process of completing a senior essay on the DPs in Bavaria, I
found the final scenes of the film very powerful, that is, when the
Russian soldier liberates the Jews and warns them to go neither west
nor east.  The question of "where do we go from here?" was on the
minds of all the DPs and the response of "Palestine" was so strong
that in one incident, cited I believe in Mark Wyman's book "DP",
Jews polled by UNRRA as to where they wanted to go chose Palestine
as both their first and second choices.  When told that they must
list a different second choice, the Jews in a certain DP camp,
listed "crematoria."  Please forgive this morbid example, but I
believe it serves as a good illustration of the commitment of the
vast majority of the  Sheyres hapleyto (at least during the first
year following liberation) to building a homeland in the land of
their forefathers.

Concerning Romaniot (Greek non-Ashkenasi, non-Sephardic) Jews, I
thank everyone for their responses.  I just read an interesting
article in the 1987 issue of "Jewish Languages Journal" about
Yavanic (Thank you, Prof. Herzog. Btw, my name Kalmen is purely
ashkenasi, although I was named after the living in the tradition of
the Romaniot).  In comparing the words listed by the language
informant interviewed by the author with those provided by mother,
who speaks the Janinna dialect, I found a number of discrepencies
but also some concordance.  However, like the informant in the
article, my mother's speech is influenced by other languages,
including Ladino (her mother was born to Romaniot parents who had
settled among the Sephardim of Istanbul) and Turkish.
Interestingly, for example, the holiday which the informant in the
article refered to as "Pesakh," my mother calls "Paskelya."  I don't
know whether this is straight from Ladino or comes from Greek, since
I speak neither language.  My mother has no special name for this
language except "Janinna Greek."

I read Ray Dalven's book a few years ago (she was a friend of the
family) and found it to be a heroic contribution to a field about
which so little is written. However, not to detract from the
importance of the work, it was written by someone who was not a
trained historian and this is reflected in the text. It is a good
starting point, though, to learn about Janinna history and culture.

I plan  to visit Kehile Kadosha Janinna in the spring and to
interview some relatives about Romaniot culture, with the hope of
finding a professor interested in this material to whom I could
submit information.  I am currently trying to contact Joshua
Fishman, for example.  Personally, I hope to learn Greek and Ladino
in the next few years so that I, myself, can help in documenting
this culture.  But I fear it will be too late.

Finally, I have found the discussion about the origins of Ashkenasi
Jewry fascinating and hope no one will be discouraged from
continuing this discussion for whatever reason.

Blaybt gezund,
Kalmen Weiser

Subject: european jewry

having read bob king's and mark louden's very interesting posts, i
can see a slightly different scenario to get the same effect i was
aiming for with my earlier musings:

as before, the migrations from german-speaking lands to
slavic-speaking lands would have been predominantly by men, but the
wives they took when they got there might have been the
SLAVIC-speaking JEWISH women of the earlier migrations. actually,
this would also explain why, in modern times, there is but one
eastern european jewish speech community--clearly the later
germanic-speaking groups merged completely with the earlier jewish
communities, all winding up germanic-speaking.

there, does everyone feel better? :)

Subject: language and maids

benjamin alpers:

i'd like to see some references on the moscow story. as you no doubt
know, linguistics in the ussr was for many years strongly 'colored'
by political concerns and this story (that rural wet-nurses
influenced the language of the upper classes) would fit right into
the party line. the reason i'm so skeptical is that it has been
found, over and over and over again, that language change goes from
the higher prestige group to the lower prestige group. of course
'prestige' is locally defined and may be domain-specific (e.g.
english rock stars singing with an approximation of the phonology of
black americans--but of course even they don't SPEAK that way), but
it's hard to imagine any domain in which rural wet-nurses would have
constituted the high-prestige group for the upper-class children
they suckled. anyway, i'd love to see a reference, if you have one.
thanks.
