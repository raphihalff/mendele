Subject: Ire fislekh un ire zokn

Shleyme Axelrod makes reference [07.180] to the Barton Brothers' "Cockeyed
Jenny"  and the lines: <Ire fislekh un ire zokn.  I tell you people, its no
use talkin'>. These lines were "borrowed" from Yiddish theatre great Aaron
Lebedeff's "Oy, I Like She".

RE:
        _Ire fislekh un ire zokn_,
         I tell you, people, it's no use talk'n'...

(Which Itsik Goldenberg calls plagiarism, but my brother Ron points out was
drawing upon the canon) 

I can't resist referring readers to a great couplet from Mickey Katz's 
St. Louis Blues: 

        "I gave you a check,
        Now you varft mir avek."

This is so concise as to be almost meaningless out of context, but the Mickey
Katz recording is a superb performance musically and also a great example of
blues singing in Yiddish, and this couplet in the context of the song is right
in the tradition of Blues couplets and at the same time right in the tradition
of Yinglish humor.

Subject: Yom Tov Erlikh

In reply to Marjon Aptroot's question, Yom Tov Erlikh is extremely popular in
haredi circles and has put out quite a few cassettes that can be bought in
shops in religious neighborhoods. His songs are quite funny, in Litvish
Yiddish, usually rythming and quite witty. He sings and, I assume, composes
his own materials.

[Moderator's note: some of Yom Tov Ehrlich's records:  
Ikh hob gevart / Oceanphonic Records, 1982. No.451 (12in - 33 1/3 rpm)  
Cassettes: Der Satmar Rebe (TS 268-23, 1980), Yidish nahes (1986), Journey
through song (JN16, 1986), Emunas tsadikim (JN28, 1986).    -i.v.]

Subject: ya-tebe-dam

Louis Friedhandler asked, in Mendele vol. 07.181, from where comes
ya-tebe-dam. I have never come across this word or phrase in my limited
exposure to Yiddish, but as a Slovak and Czech speaker it appears to me a
precise transliteration of the Czech for "I will give to you". Ya tebye dam is
perhaps the same but closer to a Slovak pronounciation, though it is also
pronounced as such in Russian, and not much different in Polish and some of
the other Slavic languages. The 'big shot' translation mentioned perhaps can
be inferred from this Slavic statement that 'I shall give to you' as reply or
as an initial comment within any discussion.

Subject: ya-tebe-dam and Avraam Uri Kovner

"Ya-tebe-dam" (ia-tebe-dam) means "I'll give you ...." in Russian.  I'm not
aware that it is a set expression meaning "big shot" in Russian.  I would also
like to ask how I might find out more about the family of Avraam Uri Kovner
(1842-1909), the Hebrew writer, "nihilist," and criminal.  I have Weinreich's
and Grossman's books.  I am working on a book on Kovner, and would like to
find records about his childhood in Vilna.  Kovner's autobiography gives an
extraordinarily negative picture of poverty and enmity in the family, but a
brief bio of Kovner's physician brother Savelii suggests otherwise. 

Yours,

Subject: "grisheh"

A contribution  re the meaning of the word "grisheh"  It conveys the general
sense  of gnawing, maceration, aggravation, or grinding.  Some usages follow:
A hund grishet a bayn. 
Es grishet mir in die gederem.
Ich hob sich a sach gegrishet iber damit.

Subject: Moses Horowitz Play: "Trisa Esler"

Dear People,

On behalf of a gentleman from the Jewishgen mailing group I am inquiring about
a Moses Horowitz, who was his relative and a Yiddish playwright and actor in
Roumania and New York.  Moses Horowitz wrote a play called "Trisa Esler" which
was based on a tragedy that occurred in the town of Stanislau.  Any
information about the author, play or the actual tragedy would be gratefully
received.

Hello, my name is Andreas Schwantner, I am living in Vienna, Austria. I am
interested in learning Jiddisch, does someone know a "virtual Yiddish" 
course?

Thanks
