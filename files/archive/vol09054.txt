Subject: List of Sholem Aleichem's stories

Itsik Goldenberg asks (09.048) if there is a master list to all of Sholem
Aleichem's stories in the Folksfond edition of his "Ale verk"; he also asks
if all of Sholem Aleichem's work is in fact included in this edition. 

The answer in Yiddish is "loy mit an aleph"--no, on both counts.

The folksfond edition was originally projected to include 40 volumes, rather
than 28--why it wasn't completed is a good question. Even those 40 volumes,
however, probably wouldn't have contained everything that Sholem Aleichem
wrote, partly do to editorial and "political" decisions made by the editors
of the edition. Still and all, the folksfond edition is by far the best and
most readable edition of Sholem Aleichem's work--or at least the 50% or so
that's been collected--available.

Much of Sholem Aleichem's early work, not collected in the folksfond edition
is available in three volumes published in the Soviet Union--with Soviet
orthography--by the "Emes Farlag" in the late 1940s. This was also part of a
projected "Ale verk" series that was never completed--though considering the
time and place of this edition, the politics of its termination are sadly
all-too-easy to figure out.

Some material not available in the folksfond edition can also be found in a
volume published by Ikuf called "Dos sholem aleichem bukh."

If I'm not mistaken, Khone Shmeruk was involved at the time of his death in
an effort, at last, to produce a real "Ale verk" series for Sholem
Aleichem--of which a magnificent edition of "Motl Peysi dem khazns" is the
only volume published to date. Anyone know of plans to continue this series?

By the way, the absence of a genuine "Collected Works" edition affects not
only Sholem Aleichem, but all the great Yiddish writers--to say nothing of
the more minor Yiddish writers, as well.

Subject: Indexes to Sholem-Aleykhem Works

Itsik Goldenberg (9.048, 4) asks about a master list or index to
Sholem-Aleykhem's stories, and a cross-index of English translations of
Sholem-Aleykhem stories that have been translated.  I have both, but only
one type has been published.  I published a compilation, up-to-date as of
1987: "Index to English Translations of the Works of Sholem Aleichem," by
Louis Fridhandler, Jewish Book Annual, ed. Jacob Kabakoff, Vol. 45, 1987,
pp.121-142. 

I also have in my computer (and printed out for my private use)
1) an index of his Yiddish originals compiled alphabetically according to the 
romanized titles; and
2) a list of his works compiled chronologically (subcompiled alphabetically). 
 The chronological compilation is of obvious historical-developmental 
interest.

In 1987, I offered these to the editor for publication as well, but the 
answer was, "No.  Not enough space."  The index in the Jewish Book Annual 
shows the source of the English translation, but does not point to the source 
of the Yiddish original, an unfortunate omission.

Given the new capacities of the internet, I might offer the Yiddish titles 
indexes to those interested.  It would take a bit of work to format the 
information for internet transmission, but I think it can be done.  My 
impression is that these romanized titles could then be transformed into 
Hebrew characters and alef-beyz(ed) accordingly.  Far di dozike merkvirdike 
nisim fun di kompyutor mevinim darf men zikh freyen!

I can testify that these indexes have been very useful to me in very many 
ways.  If you know the Yiddish title, the Yiddish original can be easily be 
found whether it is in the 28-volume Folksfond Oysgabe or elsewhere.  Some 
can be found only on microfiche edited by Chone Shmeruk published as "Yiddish 
Classics on Microfiche, Vol. 1, Clearwater Publishing Co., 1980.  Oh, those 
microfiche copies!  Looking at a copy of the original with the date of the 
censor's approval printed on the flyleaf is an arresting experience.

Alert!  Many Mendele fans will know that the Folksfond Oysgabe of 28 volumes 
(1917-1923) has been republished from the original matrices a number of 
times.  Unfortunately, volume numbers have sometimes been capriciously 
changed causing various degrees of confusion.  Fortunately, the content of 
each volume has been kept together and intact (as far as I know; ober ver 
veyst?).

Subject: fargin zikh; af zayne trit

In response to Alla Sokolova (09.048): Perhaps _af zayne trit_.

In response to Neil Sandow (09.048): _fargin zikh_ 'Don't begrudge yourself,
'indulge yourself in'.

Subject: fargin zikh

The translation of 'fargin zikh' is not quite "enjoy yourself". Enjoying
oneself was not in the psyche of gheto life and even considered unseemly,
sinful, and even an invitation to the "evil eye". All of this grew out not
only of poverty but a basic requirement of a good Jew was to live a life of
moderation, deprivation, in order not to detract from the spiritual--the
devotion to Gods law.... be an "esser" not a "fresser". Thus "ikh fargin im
zain mazal" would best be rendered as "I do not begrudge him his good
fortune."  To "fargin zikh" is to allow oneself the pleasure which one might
more rightfully be obliged to forego....... "Es iz shver tsu zayn a yid"!!!

Subject: fargin zikh

Neil Sandrow (09.048) asks about the expression "fargin zikh" translated as
enjoy yourself.  My mother, altho she did not use Yiddish very much,
frequently used this expression, especially in the negative, to mean to
begrudge or be envious of someone else's pleasure.  In the positive
imperative, as you have here, it would mean to allow oneself a pleasure,
hence 'enjoy yourself.'

It is perhaps not appropriate to use the list to ask questions about
meanings of words which are to be found in any Yiddish dictionary.  I am on
a French list and a Latin list, and altho not all the questions are
challenging to a specialist, some coming from beginning students of the
language, no one would feel that the list was a substitute for a dictionary.

[Moderator's note: Jack Berger, Yoshua Ben Litman, and Milt Koosman
submitted answers to _fargin zikh_ question as well.]

Subject: blood spots

A friend asked me if I had ever heard of the word in Yiddish for blood-spots
on the yolk of an egg. (The presence of such a spot, as most of you will
know, renders the egg treyf). My friend thought the word was "bulstrofn" but
I could not find that in Weinreich or Harkavy. If anyone can help, it would
be appreciated. 

Mayner a fraynd hot mir gefregt tsi ikh hob amol gehert dos vort "bulstrofn"
vos iz shayekh tsu a blut-flek afn gelekhl fun an ey. Kh'hob dos vort frier

Subject: call for performers - Shostakovich's "From Jewish Folk Poetry"

In 1979, Prof. Joachim Braun published the original Yiddish texts of the
poems that Shostakovich set in "From Jewish Folk Poetry." According to
Braun, Shostakovich instructed the translator that the Russian versions
should match the Yiddish texts metrically and syllabically, so that the
songs could be performed in either language without distortion of either the
music or the words. 

As far as I know, the Yiddish version has never been performed in the United
States. Prof. Izaly Zemtsovsky, when he was the Bloch Lecturer at UC
Berkeley last year, told me there had been two performances in Russia and
possibly one in Israel. I would very much like to organize a US performance
of the song cycle with the Yiddish texts. 

I'm a pianist; I'm volunteering to do this without compensation. What's
needed are a soprano, a contralto, and a tenor who can sing the vocal
material, who can learn the Yiddish texts, and who are willing to prepare
the piece "on spec"--that is, to learn it in the hope that we can find
performance venues, and possibly even a source of modest remuneration, here
in the Bay Area. 

Any takers? Email me at the address above and we'll see what develops.

Subject: translator sought for yiddish poetry 

Your email address was forwarded to me by a Dr. Hellerstein, a professor of
Yiddish and German at the University of Pennsylvania.  I am seeking
assistance in locating a translator for two books of Yiddish poetry written
by my grandfather, Chaim Simon, a poet who lived in Chicago and was an
active member of the Yiddish literary community there from the 1930's until
his death in 1946. 

On the assumption that this email address is relevant to the above, I would
appreciate any referrals you might be able to make for me in the above
regard.  By the way, and by way of a brief self-introduction, I am a Jewish
American who has lived and worked in Tokyo for the last 13 years in the
legal department of a computer manufacturer. I attempted for one year in my
youth to study Yiddish on my own and translate some of the poems, but with
little success.  More recently, of course, my language study has centered on
Japanese. 

Best regards,
Jeremy Abrams
