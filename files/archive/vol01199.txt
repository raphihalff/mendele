[David Sherman says:]

>I once heard Sam Norich telling the anectode of some Jews
>in Russia who needed to communicate with the local
>authority (police officer, whatever) about some crime that
>had been committed.  But they didn't speak Russian, so they
>found a Russian who spoke German.  Then one of the Jews
>begins telling the story of what happened -- and (as Norich
>told it) it came out with a wonderful collection of
>Hebrew-based words that would make it totally
>incomprehensible to a German-speaker.

If I understood correctly your narration of Norich's
narration of this joke, the code which Proger, Herzog, and
I were talking about probably doesn't come into play here.
What (might've) happened in this anecdote was that the Jews
said: "es iz geven a geneyve in shtot", etc. and the
German-understanding Russian had no clue what geneyve,
gazlen, etc. were.  This wasn't in code, though, naturally,
for the Jews had no other way of expressing geneyve.

The issue of _Jew_ is really interesting, no matter what
the answer (as if there really were an answer).

Judging by the meter (and lack of rhyme), your melody is
probably different from mine.

Dan Breslauer,  As an authority on Bialik, will you take it
amiss if someone suggests that you run right out and really
learn Yiddish? Bialik was, after all one of the very few
who wrote his own poetry, ORIGINALLY, in both languages;
i.e., he didn't simply translate from one to the other. And
then there are the jokes. Ah, the jokes! WELCOME!

Subject: "Ost und West"

David Brenner inquires about the journal "Ost und West". I
have no information about that, but he may be interested in
a Yiddish (silent) film made in Vienna in the 1920s with
that title. It was Molly Picon's first and was later
reissued in the US with the title strangely mutated to
"Mazel Tov"!

The film was in the context of the "Ost Juden" mainly from
Galicia who had come to Vienna seeking refuge from the war
of 1914-18. These were not always appreciated by the
prosperous semi-assimilated Viennese Jews. The film shows
the development of a young Galizianer "rube", rejected by
the American Molly, despite being formally married to him
(because the "Haray at" had been said at what was meant to
be a mock wedding). Helped by his clean shaven Viennese
uncle, the lad becomes a success as a secular scholar,
writing a book called "Ost und West" (and of course wins
Molly).

This likely is little use to David Brenner, but it was a
really interesting film.

David Sherman: No, in Yiddish, seyfer DOES NOT belong to a
subset of bukh. If you can't identify the object's contents
from a distance, you might call a khumesh, but that would
be your only excuse.

David Braun, A propos of your "dautsh" joke, fill in the
blank in the following "A Varshove izikimin kan Ameyrike;
nu:kh tsvay vokhn ote gizukt: 'az yakh binikimin kan
Ameyrike obox shoynikent redn dra:tsn shprakhn; ha:nt,
azexobzox shoyn o:sgileyrnt Engelish, kenox shoyn ------'.

Probably the 'other' Ben-Ami is the' right' Ben-Ami.
Yankev Ben-Ami (playwright, director) was much too recent.
But once again, don't have dates at  hand.

*****

Mikhl Herzog urged me to mention to Mendele that the
Yiddish of Immanuel Olsvanger's [imonuel olshvanger] _Royte
Pomerantsn_ is not of the Kurland dialect, but is probably
litvish Yiddish of the Grodne/Byalistok area (specifically
Grayvi [Polish: Grajewo], if I remember Olsvanger's
birthplace correctly). There are umlauts on some of the o's
in the book, as in the title: Ro"yte Pomerantsen, and there
are some cases of au where Standard Yiddish has oy
(araus/aroys), but these should be taken with a grain of
salt because he was trying (sometimes succeeded, sometimes
didn't) to present the Yiddish phonology in such a way that
it would be understandable to German readers.

His original of Royte Pom.. was published in the 20's or
early 30's by the Schweizer Gesellschaft fu"r Volkskunde.
The reader is supposed to be able to understand
"everything" in the book because glosses of many of the
words are given.  This is actually false advertising to the
reader of the American Schocken edition: the English reader
has no way of understanding the Yiddish unless... (s)he
understands a lot of Yiddish.  The reader of the original
publication was supposed to be a German-reader/speaker, so
all the items of Slavic/Semitic/Romance extraction in the
Yiddish of Royte Pom.. are glossed in footnotes, since the
German is expected to be able to understand most of the
materials from the Germanic component.
