Subject: Vider a mol Hotsmakh

A further sidelight to the much earlier discussion of Goldfaden's
Hotsmakh:  I've just come across the Romanian word _hot,_, pronounced
[hots], which means 'thief; swindler; sly person' and the word _hot,oman_
'thief; scoundrel, rascal'.  Considering Hotsmakh's behavior in
Goldfaden's "Di kishefmakherin" and the fact that Goldfaden was from
Romania, could there be a connection?

Subject: Ashkenaz; Yiddish nowadays

After returning from Toronto and being part of Ashkenaz, still flying
(like Paul Pascal), I was describing the hartzik intensity of Adrienne
Cooper and Irena Klepfish who created a program that presented the
Yiddish women poets (Fradel Schtok, Kadya Maladowsky, Rokhl Korn,
Rachelle Vaprinski, and more) that was truly extraordinary. Adrienne
singing Bella Schaechter Gottesman's "Mayn Khaverte Mintsye" and
"Harbstlid" could move the proverbial stone to sobbing. At this point, my
computer hard drive crashed, blew, collapsed, and I was reminded of an
early Kurt Vonnegut short story, "Epicac" where the computer fell in love
with the young lady who was recipient of the poems being written upon it
by the young man who loved her. Was Ashkenaz reporting too much emotion
for my computer to handle? S'ken zayn. Ver veys?

I had to be patient until it was mended, and then had the pleasure of
almost two weeks of Mendele printouts in one sitting. It was like an
overview of what Mendele is - a potpourri of brilliant academicians, of
lovers of Yiddish literature, of friends of Yiddish, of pedestrian
posters, of knowledgeable professionals working for perpetuation of
Yiddish, of new enthusiastic subscribers, of lurkers (wouldn't viewers be
a better name?)

But through all the pages, I have been haunted by David Herskovic's
posting in Mendele Vol. 5.055 about the khsidim and khsidishe kinderlekh.
"All the scholarly discussions of the language do not make up for a few
weeks of buying, selling, loving, hating, laughing, crying, phoning,
faxing, blessing, cursing, all in mameloshn." (Even if less than perfect,
is implied.)

I believe Yiddish wore a tattered coat in the shtetl too, when it was
alive with all the aforementioned activity (minus the phone and fax).
Although I have learned so much on Mendele from Bob Rothstein, Mikhl
Herzog, Zellig Bach, Harvey Spiro, and so many more scholars, I feel
Herskovic's plea for allowance of change, additions, and growth in the
language is something we must heed, or our perfect, every-hair-in-place
Mame Yidish may end up a static hand-maiden to Latin which is jailed
within its grammar and sentence structure in specific tomes today.

Herskovic is, perhaps, predicting the future, when he says that another
Sholom Alkeikhem or Peretz may more likely arise from these kheder yugnt.

Maybe even a Mendele.

Subject: Regarding the 80th anniversary of the death of I.L. Peretz

Sylvia Lustgarten, undaunted "tuer" for Yiddish in Toronto was throwing
some ideas my way the other day as she is wont to do.  Specifically, she
suggested that it might be an idea to stage community events in
commemoration of the 80th anniversary of I.L.  Peretz' death.
Apparently, the anniversary occurs either in 1995, or 1996.

Sylvia thought that there might be agreement among Jewish communities to
host events in schools, synogogues, organizations, etc. to commemorate
the anniversary.   Or, otherwise stated, to celebrate the life of Peretz.

We did something like that in Toronto re Sholom Aleichem. The Committee
for Yiddish sent out a request that some event, or whatever, be staged on
the theme of Sholom Aleichem.  It worked out not badly.

I agreed to throw the idea out on Mendele because it presented the
opportunity to stage international, perhaps complementary events which
would enrich the whole because of electronic information permits such
rapid sharing of information.

I leave that with you.

Subject: Sharing among Jewish day schools teaching Yiddish

First of all kumt es mir a mazel tov.  I am a member of the first public
secondary school class to complete the OAC level in Yiddish, which means
that were I proceeding to the first year of University, I would be able
to use Yiddish as one of the credits, in the category of international
(not folk) languages, to be considered for admission.  In my particular
case, I studied Yiddish at university before I studied it in high
school...

Thanks to Elie Moidel, die leriren, and Gloria Howard, the principal of
the Continuing Education Department at Earl Haig Secondary School in
North York (Toronto).

We are moving along with registration for the 1995-96 academic year, and
we expect to have some more OAC graduates most (a relative term) of whom
studied Yiddish at the Bialik Hebrew Day School here in Toronto.  Zey vet
take kumen a hartsikn mazel tov.

Secondly, Sylvia Lustgarten--she is very creative, you see--suggested the
idea that it would be fun for children learning Yiddish to correspond
with other children who are also learning Yiddish.

Mendele makes such a pen-pal project much more feasible than previously
because e-mail facilitates the organization of such a project--or perhaps
just makes it seem like more fun.

At any rate, reading the messages from Jewish day schools in Montreal and
Melbourne made me think about Sylvia's idea once again.

If there is any interest in this, I would be pleased to facilitate the
process here in Toronto, as in my own home there are four students.

Subject: Vinkl

Since Daniella HarPaz has renewed her query about the use of _vinkl_ to
mean 'club' etc. (5.062), I'll try my hand at it.  My first association
was with the late Wolf Younin's column in the _Forverts_, which he called
"Shprakhvinkl," i.e., "Language Corner." There are Slavic parallels using
the diminutive of the word for "angle" or "corner" to refer to a regular
newspaper or radio feature, e.g., Polish _ka,cik filatelistyczny_
'philatelic corner', Russian _ugolok kollektsionera_ 'collector's
corner', Czech _jazykovy' koutek_ 'language corner' [a radio program
devoted to usage questions].

Perhaps the meanings that Daniella asked about represent an extension of
this usage.
