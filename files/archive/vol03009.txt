Subject: sayings, words

When anyone announced to my grandparents some deed, accomplishment,
so-called important event that my grandparents thought didn't amount to
much, they would say, "Shtel sikh rakkhim!"  My mother explained to me
that this meant "Go stand on your head."  (It's another one of the
phrases I mutter at dept. meetings.)  "Shmorovoz" means, I think, slob,
an unkempt person.  It sounds like a Russian word to me.  For some
reason, I associate this word with the term "besmackovit" which means,
in my family's usage, a condition in which one's snot has spattered
one's shirt, face, necktie, blouse, whatever...this can happen when one
laughs in the midst of swallowing hot coffee.

Subject: weininger/viswanath

With a name like Viswanath, I can't hope to be taken seriously as a
Yiddish speaker.   Your suggestion of substituting Weininger for
Viswanath is a good one. (see 3.006)

Subject: Transcription vs. transliteration

Thanks to Arn for explaining the difference between transcription and
transliteration.  I did, indeed, miss the point of that first paragraph
in 3.004 (I believe).

My postings should be read with 'transcription' for 'transliteration.'
As for the substantive content of his posting, I believe I have already
responded in the previous issue of Mendele.  I note that Bob Hoberman
also seems to agree on the spelling of yiddish 'borrowings' into
English, although the question of 'Yiddish Vokh' versus 'Yidish Vokh' in
an otherwise English letter would still seem to be unresolved in his
comment.

I agree, if the transliteration is a transliteration and not a
re-expression in the host language's phonology.

The words "yidish" and "Yiddish" are pronounced differently. The first
vowel is long in "yidish"; a true English transliteration would not be
"yiddish" but "yeedish".

Therefore, I find "Yiddish vokh" unacceptable.  It's a mixture of
English and Yiddish phonology in what should be a single compound word
in (only) one language. For me, "yidish-vokh" is the only possible
spelling.

The same issue comes up, for Canadians, when writing about Montreal.  If
your sentence is to be read with Montreal pronounced as it is in English
(mon-tree-ALL), then you don't put an accent on the 'e'... because once
you put an accent on the 'e', you must pronounce it in French
(mon-ray-AL).  Thus, Canadians writing about Montreal in English will
not put the accent on the 'e'.  On the other hand, if you're writing
about the Gaspe' peninsula, you always put the accent on the 'e' even
when writing in English.
