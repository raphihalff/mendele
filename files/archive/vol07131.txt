Subject: Judith Maccabee

In Philip Goodman's _The Hanukkah Anthology_ (JPS) -- a book filled with
tantalizing references to all kinds of interesting stuff -- we find on page
286: 

The eighth and last day of Hanukkah is called Zot Hanukkah (This is the
Dedication)... In some communities the eighth day was dedicated to Judith; 
the women would read in Old Yiddish the story of the heroine in _Zos Hanukkah
Bikhel_ by Elhanan ben Issachar (Frankfurt on the Main, 1712). 

Does anyone know:  is this Zos-Khanuke-Bikhl extant?  Where is it?  Does
anyone on the list have access to it (e.g. in a university library)?  Any
chance of posting its contents relevant to Judith on this list? 

I'm also extremely interested in any information from memories or folkloric
research on the story of Judith as it relates to Khanuke (n.b. the apocryphal
Book of Judith must have gone through considerable folklore processing in
Jewish communities.  According to Mishnah Berurah on the laws of Khanuke,
Judith [referred to in the Shulkhan Orukh there] was "the daughter of Yokhanan
the High Priest", making her Judah Maccabee's aunt) or on women's Khanuke
customs (see Goodman's _Anthology_ for various tantalizing references, mostly
in regard to Sephardi communities).

Subject: shiker iz a goy

As far as I remember the song:

   Oy, shiker iz a goy
   Shiker iz er
   trinken miz er
   val er iz a goy. 

   Oy, nikhter iz a yid, 
   Nikhter iz er, 
   Davenen miz er, 
   val er iz a yid. 

(Forgive my non-YIVO transliteration).

Subject: Hebrew-Aramaic words in Yiddish

May I take issue with some recent comments.

Beni Warshawski writes: "The Hebrew-Aramaic words are the core words in
Yiddish because they articulate Jewish religious concerns which are not
expressed using words from the dominant environment.  ......" 

Mikhl Herzog: "Hebrew-Aramaic words like _got_, _bentshn_, _leyenen_,
_praven_, _treybern_, right?" 

I take Reb Mikhl's point, but

1) until recently, leynen had no religious meaning. I still equate leynen with
reading, fullstop (period). If someone asks me "Will you leyn this week" (I am
a bal-koyre) my immediate reaction is what book or newspaper am I being asked
about. The religious context carries the phrase "leynen di toyre" 

2) pravn defeats me completely. Yes, one talks about pravn a tish, pravn
shaleshides but I don't see praven as having any religious content. what about
praven malkhes?

Subject: Yiddish & alcohol

I saw a Yiddish play when I was a boy (in the 1940s) in which a character with
an obvious alcolhol problem would prefcae each swig from the bottle with the
verse: 

Iz gegangen
Tsu Ferlangen
A bisl mashke
fin di flashke

The play may have been "di mensh fun morgen"

Subject: bayoer

In regard to L. Fridlander's question about "bayoer":  all he need do is check
Weinreich's dictionary:  "bayoen" = "confirm," etc.  The root is presumably
"yo" = "yes".  The German cognate--and I presume source--is the verb "bejahen"
(same meaning), though German lacks "Bejaher," so that "bayoer" appears to be
a purely Yiddish invention meaning sort of "optimist"--someone who has a
positive attitude towards life.  But given the inventiveness of German and the
productiveness of its "er"  suffix, "Bejaher" sounds perfectly acceptable.

Subject: Ba-yo'er

Louis Fridhandler asks about the word ba-yo'er and speculates that it may have
been invented.  This is unlikely, since my German dictionary has bejahen, with
the same meaning.

Subject: Dobrushin

In response to David Goldberg's comments about Dobrushin, I would like to
stress that my earlier comments were by no means intended to be
hagiographical.  I wrote that Dobrushin was one of the most prolific Soviet
Yiddish writers, but I should add that he was by no means one of the best. 
Dobrushin's critical work consistently followed the party line with very
little of his own innovations.  His originality of thought pales in comparison
to some of the more astute Soviet Yiddish literary critics of the era (I am
thinking in particular of Moshe Litvakov and Osip Liubomirskii). 
        
Dobrushin's work as a dramatist was equally mediocre.  His plays were pale
copies of typical socialist realist works dealing with socialist construction. 
The Trial Is On tells of Niome Burman, a young Jewish man from a traditional
Jewish background who joins the Red Army and helps form a workers artel of
Jewish and non-Jewish workers to build socialism.  He befriends a non-Jewish
woman, Anastasia, whom he marries despite his parents' ardent objections.  The
ease with which Niome renounces his parents and their heritage and the ease
with which he assimilates into the gentile world were entirely unrealistic. 
Dobrushin's other major play, The Specialist, was equally bland. It told of a
bourgeois specialist who feels that his work is not being appreciated. 
Frustrated, he joins a group of counter-revolutionaries who try to sabotage
the construction of socialism in the Soviet Union. 
        
Dobrushin's adaptations of the plays of Sholem Aleichem and Goldfadn also
merit little attention.  His primary goal was to make the plays adhere better
to the dictates of socialist realism.  For instance, in his adaptation of
Tevye the Dairyman, Tevye does not come to accept the decisions of his
daughters out of love and respect for their judgement, as in Sholem Aleichem's
version, but rather because he is convinced of the merits of communism by
Perchik (Godl's revolutionary husband) who acts as a mentor for Tevye. 
Dobrushin essentially turned the play into the story of how one simple and
naive old man gradually becomes socially conscious and a supporter of the
revolutionary movement. 
        
I would like to point out, however, that Dobrushin was not representative of
Soviet Yiddish literature and drama as a whole.  The plays of Peretz Markish,
David Bergelson, Shmuel Halkin (including his adaptations of Goldfadn's
Shulamis and Bar Kokhba), Moshe Kulbak, and others, were remarkably rich and
full of Jewish motifs.  They managed to cater to contemporary Soviet demands
without sacrificing their Jewishness or quality.  Jewish culture remained
alive and well in the Soviet Union until after World War II.  Dobrushin was
just not one of the best examples of it.

Subject: Rose Auslander's Yiddish poem

Next week will mark the tenth yortsayt of Rose Auslander (1901, Czernowitz -
1988, Dusseldorf), one of the most powerful voices in the German poetry of
this century. Being like most Czernowitz Jews of her time multilingual, Rose
Auslander knew and loved Yiddish. She translated into German and English
fables and poems of her good friends Eliezer Shteynbarg and Itsik Manger. Her
original Yiddish poetry is known much less. I was able to locate only a single
poem quoted by Joseph Kruse in "Von Franzos zu Canetti: judische Autoren aus
Osterreich" (Tubingen: Max Niemeyer Verlag, 1996). The poem written in 1947 in
New York and addressed to the friends in Bucarest. It is probably one of the
very first lyrical reflections of the lowering iron curtain. The poem also
shows that even freedom and relative material well-being do not replace
severed ties with the friends and familiar intellectual atmosphere. 

Tsu di khaveyrim in der vayt

"Oyf a shteyn, oyf a shteyn"
zits ikh troirik un aleyn.
Di khaveyrim zenen vayt
un es yugt an flit di tsayt.

"S'tantst a reytach mit a khreyn"
zing ikh shtil tsu mir aleyn.
Kimt a brivl fun der vayt,
lakh ikh un ikh veyn far frayd.

"Ikh bin oykhet dort geveyn"
in di yurn gut un sheyn.
Efsher kimt meshiakh's tsayt
un er brengt aykh fun der vayt.

Zingt dos lidl, s'iz nit shver:
"Ikh hob oykh gelost a trer".
Nit zikh sheymen zolt ir, neyn:
Treyrn hobn oikh a kheyn.

"Lomir ale tantsen geyn",
ir tsuzamen, ikh aleyn.
Unzer lidl hert nit oyf,
brengt in benkshaft unz tsunoyf.

Five stanzas of the poem are threaded on what seems to be the lines from a
Yiddish song:

Oyf a shteyn, oyf a shteyn
S'tantst a reytach mit a khreyn
Ikh bin oykhet dort geveyn
Ikh hob oykh gelost a trer
Lomir alle tantsen geyn

Does somebody know this song? Any other Yiddish poems by Rose Auslander?
