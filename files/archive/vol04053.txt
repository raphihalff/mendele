Subject: Introduction

Ikh hays Raizl. This summer I am attending the Uriel Weinrich Program in
Yiddish Language, Literature and Culture at Columbia University through
Yivo and Columbia.  I volunteer at Yivo, where I am currently cataloging
a collection of photographs by Menachem Kipnis taken in Poland in the
1920's.  Also I serve as a docent at the Jewish Museum in New York City.
I am interested in Yiddish language and literature and Eastern European
Jewish history.

A sheynem dank.

Subject: teu teu teu

During a recent conversation with friends in Germany, my mitshmueser
listed a bunch of happy events followed by "Teu teu teu" read /toy/.
This sounded very much like konehore and shpay oys dray mol (spit out
thrice) in yiddish superstition surrounding the evil eye.  Am I correct
in supposing this etymology for the German expression?  I also would like
to repost my question on knibbers which does not seem to have been posted
as a result of last week's confusion.  My father from Brooklyn has an
expression "a little weak in the knibbers," which is roughly equivalent
to "nisht mit alemen, a bit under the weather."  What the heck are
knibbers? Is this from Yiddish?

Subject: Skvira

David Sherman asked about the location of Skvir in Europe. I have found
an entry for Skvira on p. 93 of Cohen, Chester G. (1989). Shtetl Finder.
Bowie, MD: Heritage Books.

"Skvira, SW of Kiev

"West of Belaya Tserkov.A branch of the Twersky dynasty of chassidic
rabbis was based in Skvira, dating from Yitzchak Tversky 1912-1885."
Cohen says there is an article on Skvira in the Encyclopedia Judaica,
1971. Also, it is number 6107 in erl Kagan's 1975 book Sefer
Haprenumerantn (Hebrew Subscription Lists).

Our kids have gone through brief stages of thinking that someone who
doesn't speak Yiddish isn't Jewish.  The explanations get confusing
because of the double meaning of the word _yidish_, of course.  (We speak
to them only in Yiddish, so there's no opportunity to clarify with the
English terminology.)

There's also the misconception that a man who doesn't wear a yarmulke
isn't Jewish, which can happen to kids who grow up in Orthodox
communities.

Re: mendele@shakti

zayt mir moykhl--dos hot gor nisht tsu tin mit yidish.  nor ikh miz
epes zogn vegn dem!

I am glad that even though I don't normally had power breakfasts and
power lunches, I do now subscribe to a mailing list that operates out
of a 'power' computer!  Shakti, the new (?) name of the computer from
which mendele operates is a sanskrit word, which means power, and which
also represents the female deity, usually thought of as the consort of
Shiva, who is himself also thought of as androgynous.  So, it is also a
politically correct name (methinks, anyway).

Subject: Solent

Regarding "solent"  (Solent Green?).  This must be a misremembered
[tsolent].  My father's family, REAL Litvaks, pronounced it [tsount].
This Litvak dialect pronunciation, brought to America in the great wave,
and well-represented in my family (those who heard my cousin Sol
Goldstein, whose postumous troubles have been on the front page of the
Forward, heard a perfect rendition of this dialect feature--in English
and Lith, as well as Yiddish!), began to retreat after the turn of the
century and the spread of standard Yiddish from urban centers.
