Subject: Old Yiddish and Judeo-Deutsch

Can anyone tell me what are the differences (if any) between Old Yiddish and
Judeo-Deutsch. Are the differences in time, place, form of the language, or
predilection of the person naming the language used?  I am working with some
writings by women in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, mostly in
Germany, but some in Bohemia. Most people who have looked at them state that
they are written in Judeo-Deutsch.  I wonder what the experts on MENDELE
would call the language used?

Subject: I.B. Singer

Many thanks for Golde Gross' response to attacks on I.B. Singer (The Mendele
Review Vol. 03.017). As a casual reader of Singer, I think there is little
to fear from his critics. If you took a survey of reactions to his name,
"What a wonderful writer" would far outnumber those comments about
craziness, woman-hating, etc.

The delicious irony is that the instrument of his detractors is
psychoanalysis. Now you're really talkin' crazy, woman-hating, primitive and
bewildering.

Subject: recent history of Yiddish newspapers 

Does anyone know of an article or book, popular or scholarly, that deals
with the history of Yiddish newspapers around the world, especially in
recent times?  I know that in recent decades once thriving Yiddish papers
have closed down on all continents, but I'd be curious to know how many
papers there were at various different times, in various places, with how
large circulations, and with what political/religious orientations. A few
years ago I received "Global Yiddish" which had a nice listing of Yiddish
periodicals worldwide, but not too many details. I wonder too whether
orthodox (or ultra-orthodox) papers are published anywhere but in the US
where I know of at least four, plus small local Yiddish papers in Kiryas
Joel and in Monsey. It would seem hard to believe that no such Yiddish
papers exist in Israel or elsewhere outside of New York state. 

Thanks in advance for information or recommendations of where to look,

Subject: New Publication: Yiddish in the Contemporary World

TITLE: Yiddish in the Contemporary World:Papers of the first Mendel
Friedman International Conference on Yiddish
EDITORS: Gennady Estraikh and Mikhail Krutikov
DESCRIPTION: In August 1908, a few prominent Jews - socialists, liberals,
non-political writers and cultural organizers - came together in the town
of Czernowitz, then in Austria-Hungary. At this historic meeting they
worked out a programme for promoting Yiddish as the official language of
Ashkenazic Jews.  Ninety years later, the Univeristy of Oxford European
Humanities Research Centre and the Oxford Institute for Yiddish Studies
organized 'Yiddish in the Contemporary World' (19-21 April 1998) to
celebrate the anniversary of the Czernowitz Conference and to review
academic work in universities in Europe, Israel and North America.  Leading
scholars came to Oxford to present their research, collected here to
provide a remarkable panoramic view of Yiddish at the end of the twentieth
century.  This annual international gathering provides ongoing analysis of
Yiddish language and culture.

Subject: "Voyages", film by Emmanuel Finkiel

I would like to recommend the recent French movie "Voyages"  ("Travels") to
all the Mendelyaner. It is the first film of Emmanuel Finkiel, and was
released at the end of September in France. A significant part of its
dialogues are in Yiddish (the rest mostly is in French, with a bit of
Polish, Russian and Hebrew too). 
 
The plot is centered on three elderly Jewish women: Riwka (Shulamit Adam),
who visits Poland (and especially the death camps) with a group of French
Jews and tries to deal with the painful memories of her murdered family and
also with her conflicts with her husband; Regine (Liliane Rovere), who lives
in Paris and is contacted by a very elderly man from Lithuania who claims to
be her father, while she thought he had been killed in Auschwitz 55 years
before, and 85-years-old Vera, who has just emigrated from Russia to Israel,
and gets lost in the suburbs of Tel-Aviv while searching her cousin whom she
hasn't seen for nearly 30 years... 

This film received a wide appraisal from the French press, and I found it
especially moving and beautiful.

Subject: word on a jar-"zangvil"

Marc Agronin asks [Mendele Vol 09.032] for the meaning of 
<<zayin-nun-gimel-bet-yud-lamed sofit [sic]>>

Zangvil is the spice 'ginger' according to Dov Ben-Abba _Hebrew/English 
English/Hebrew Dictionary_ but it is cinamon according to the _Milon Ivri_ of 
Yehuda Gur. Even Shushan _Hamilon Hachadash_suggests 'Zingiber' based on the 
Greek dzingiberi.

zangvil is used in Hebrew for the root spice 'ginger'.  In Yiddish it is
called ingber.

"zayin-nun-gimel-bet-yud-lamed" is zangwill, or ginger.

Gut shabes to all,

Subject: Word on a jar

Regarding the query about the inscription on the jar from Hungary:
zayin-nun-giml-beyz-yud-lamed (and I'm not sure how a lamed can be "lamed
sofit", as the questioner put it), it looks to me like a Hebrew (not
Yiddish) spelling of the name "Zangvil", sometimes rendered "Zangwill", a
well-known surname and given name.  The beyz is a veyz, hence the V sound.
The name is a form of "Samuel".
