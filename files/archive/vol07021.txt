[English translation]:  

Dear, learned mendelayners,

I'm stuck for the exact definition of a word and am sublimely confident that 
someone out there can unstick me in short order. The word is 'boyuvka', 
spelled: beys, komets alef, yud, vov, shtimer alef, 2 vovn, kuf, alef. In 
context, it probably has a military connotation: cadre, patrol, squad, 
committee, etc. 

The source is: lodzer almanakh, lodzer branch 324 of Workmen's Circle, 
Bronx, NY (1934?), LC call # DS135.P62L64414, Page 92.   

a shaynem dank,

Marvin (Meyer) Engel

Subject: Isaac Singer: "Noble" [sic] Laureate

Today's NY Times (6/19/97, page A18) has a very lengthy article on the 
correction of a typographical error on both the headstone and the footstone 
located on the grave of Singer.  While I cannot sign my speculations with 
Singer's autograph, I suspect that he would have found both comedy and 
tragedy in the scene.

To make a long story short, an engraver is said to have made the error by 
placing on both stones the fact that Singer was a "Nobel Laureate."  The 
smaller stone was corrected very quickly, but it took until now to correct 
the headstone, though all it has on its is two lines which (now) read:

			SINGER
			Nobel Laureate

To make the matter worse, it appears to me from the photograph in the 
referenced newspaper article, that the correction was made by cutting out 
the offending text and then placing a tablet with the corrected text into 
the stone.  Such addenda to memorial tablets are prime targets for theives, 
and to own the tablet from Singer's stone is someday going to be a cottage 
industry.  If it lasts for 10 years, I will be astonished.

There is a personal and unrelated sadness to the story in the telling of the 
tale of the site selection for Singer's grave by his wife, the former Adele 
Wasserman who, it is said, left her husband, Walter Wasserman, to marry 
Singer.  In searching for a site, Mrs. Wasserman found one very close to her 
former husband and also near her daughter with whom she unfortunately did 
not have good relations and who passed away from cancer.

The entire episode could be made into a sad/funny short story that Singer 
could have done up brown!

Subject: barikht vegnm kalevers vizit in ingern

A dank, koydem kol, Perets Mettn far korigirn mayn yidish. Ikh hob take 
gemakht a toes. Halevay es volt geven tomid emetser, vos iz greyt tsu 
korigirn vos ikh shrayb af yidish! 
 
Vehasheynes vil ikh derklern dem filologishn hintergrunt fun mayn toes.
Ven ikh hob geshribn 'gegebn a tish', iz dos nisht geven keyn iberzetsung 
fun english, nor fun ingerish, vos iz mayn mame-loshn. Az an ingerisher yid 
zogt af ingerish 'der rebe hot gefirt a tish', zogt er _a rebe tisht csinalt_ 
(= Engl.'made') oder a _rebe tisht adott_ (Engl.'gave'). Yes, with the Yiddish 
word in it, even though 'tish' in Hungarian is _asztal_. Dem dozikn oysdruk 
hob ikh instinktiv tsurik ibergezets vi 'gegebn a tish'. How would you 
translate 'gefirt a tish' into English, by the way?
    
And thirdly, in English, so that everyone on _mendele_ should be informed, I 
mentioned that the Hungarian TV filmed the entire visit of the Kalever rebe 
(who, indeed, used to live in Rishon letsion, but moved to Bne-brak a few 
years ago). Even his visit to Nagykallo was filmed: how he sang, how he 
davened, how he gave a telephone interview to the Israeli radio. The material 
is now put together and it will be shown on Hungarian TV soon. If anyone is 
interested in seeing it, I can help you make contact with the producer of the 
film.
