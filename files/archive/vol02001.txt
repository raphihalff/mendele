Well, we have Camp Emanuel (Bronx House) at Copake NY,
where the Yugntruf camp week takes place from Wednesday to
Tuesday through Labour Day.  It's only a week, but it's
something of a substitute.  Who from MENDELE will be there,
besides me, Dovid Braun and Meylekh Viswanath? Noyekh, can
you at least drop by, if you can't make it for the whole
week?  Anyone else?

I saw Eleanor Reissa in "Those Were the Days", which she
directed as well as starring in (there were 5
actor/singers). I thought it was wonderful.  Drama
workshops from her should be worthwhile.  (No, I won't be
in England in August.:-)

[Bob Werman writes:]

        Joyce raised the question of the nature of an
        object of beauty created by a man hacking in fury
        with no intention of making art.

This raises a related -- but to my mind a very important --
issue: should we, as Jews, admire and condone literary
works that have a real esthetic appeal but that are
violently (or even not so violently) antisemitic? (and imho
'antizionism' is but a hypocritical and insidious form of
it). I am thinking of authors like Ezra Pound, Celine and
recently Drieu la Rochelle to cite only a few. This also
extends to other works of art, eg Wagner's music, etc. To
be frank with the list, my position is that of our first
and foremost text on antisemitism, ie what the Torah has to
say about `Amalek: "Yimma`h shemo vezikhro" -- I shall not
argue for it in detail.

Subject: access to mendele

Can anyone advise me how a friend in Jerusalem, who has no
university affiliation, can gain access to Mendele?  I
believe that internet connections are available through the
telephone company, but this would involve a .com suffix,
and probably be expensive.

Subject: Anyone know of Jewish contacts in Hungary or Slovakia?

I lead a klezmer band, OOMPH, based in Portland and
Corvallis, Oregon. Last fall, we gave a series a concerts
in Birobidjan and Khabarovsk, the sister cities of
Beaverton and Portland, Oregon, respectively, in what was
then the Soviet Far East.  In just four weeks, we will be
in Krakow, Poland, to perform at that city's annual Jewish
culture festival.  We had applied for some funding, didn't
receive any, but decided to go ahead with the trip anyway
out of our own pockets.  We'll be spending almost two full
weeks in central and eastern Europe, with a performance in
Austria immediately upon our arrival and a block of free
time surrounding Shavuos.

While we're in Europe next month, we would like to schedule
one or more concerts in Budapest, Bratislava, or any other
community in Hungary or Slovakia.  If you have any contacts
in either of those countries, I would very much appreciate
your help.  Our needs are simple: a place to perform, and
overnight accommodations for four.  Of course, if an
honorarium is available to help defray our travel expenses,
that would be nice too, but it's not essential.  We
understand that the economic situation in Eastern Europe is
difficult, and our goal is simply to perform for Jewish
communities that have been outside the mainstream of Jewish
life for too long.

Even though this is very short notice, I would hope that
there might be some venue in these communities where we
might perform, however informally.  As I said, our needs
are quite modest.  Mainly, we just want to play.
  
About OOMPH:  our music is a blend of traditional klezmer,
Yiddish theatre, chassidic melodies, free jazz, and a wide
range of American influences. (Imagine "I Feel Good" or
"Sweet Home Chicago" in Yiddish.)  We bill ourselves as
"intercontinental klezmer", and we like to keep things
lively.  We travel as a trio, including vocals, soprano and
alto sax, tarogato, and keyboards. Back in Oregon, we
usually work with a drummer and frequently with a guitarist
too.  On this trip, we'll be accompanied by a very good
friend who will help us with many logistical details.
We're planning to release our first CD later this year.

If you can help us in any way -- either by suggesting
contacts who might be able to schedule a concert for us, or
by suggesting generous individuals or organizations who
might be able to help with the cost of our airfare --
thanks in advance.  Just in case you know of someone who's
interested, the Portland Yiddish Club (P. O. Box 3151,
Portland, OR 97208) has established a special fund for
traveling artists to which individuals can send
tax-deductible contributions.
