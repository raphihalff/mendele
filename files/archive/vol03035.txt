Subject: Re: Yiddish -- The Fifteenth Slavic Language?

zachary baker writes of paul wexler's claim that yiddish is
(relexified) slavic and wonders why the professional linguists here
haven't commented on it.

first, i think there was some discussion way back--but that may just
be a bad dream. second, when i see some content to his claims, i'll
take them as worthy of scholarly debate.

I seem to remember Ellen Prince being eloquent on this subject some
time ago, but perhaps that wasn't on Mendele. In any case, I'll take
a stab at it.

Disclaimer: I haven't read Wexler's work, and it's possible that the
second and third hand reports I've heard haven't given me a fair
impression.

But the reason I haven't bothered looking up the original work is
that it sounds too implausible to be interesting.

Why? Well, let's consider briefly a real case of the scenario being
proposed, like Albanian. As I understand it, when historical
linguists first looked at Albanian, they thought it was a Romance
language, because there were Latin etymologies for most of the
vocabulary. But the grammatical patterns were very different from
any other Romance language. And then they noticed that they couldn't
find Latin etymologies for many of the words least likely to be
borrowed: everyday nouns, common irregular verbs, etc. A closer look
revealed that those words did have Indo-European etymologies, but
could not have come from Latin. (It turns out that Albanian is a
separate branch of Indo-European, with massive numbers of Romance
loan words dating back to the period of the Roman empire.)

And the point is that Yiddish doesn't resemble this at all. Basic
vocabulary is overwhelmingly Germanic. Pronouns and irregular verbs
are exclusively Germanic.  The syntax is fundamentally Germanic. The
morphology is primarily Germanic.  Yiddish simply is not a Slavic
language. In fact, it's a pretty typical Germanic language, more
typical than English, I'd say.

That doesn't mean that there couldn't have been some group of Jews
who spoke a Slavic language, and later switched to a Germanic
language, as Wexler suggests. But if so, the switch was too complete
to call the result a Slavic language. (Something like this did in
fact happen to the Romance predecessor of Yiddish, the source of
words like bentshn & cholnt.)

And I don't deny that there are subtle and interesting influences on
Yiddish from Slavic. I'd like to learn more about them. But they all
seem to be the sorts of things that can be borrowed readily under
circumstances of extensive bi-lingualism, which we know we had.
Frankly, Wexler's claims sound too much like the lunatic fringe (a
regretably large part of Linguistics :-() for me to think that I
would learn much from his work.

Once while browsing the "history of Hebrew" shelves in the library.
I came across a respectable looking book entitled "Hebrew is Greek".
I didn't bother reading that one either ...

So much for the hard-core skeptic position: anyone for the defense?
