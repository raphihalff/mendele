Subject: Tsum dritten geburtstog

Mendele begins its fourth year today.  From a nucleus of 22 we are now
close to 500.  From a hand-stitched mailing list that came out of
Trinity's old VAX we now, thanks to Victor Bers, conduct business via
Yale's Listserver.  For the shames it's been pure pleasure the whole
time, since all the hard work has been done by those who do the writing.
And the product is just what it ought to be: rarely heavy, usually
serious, always intelligent.  Many thanks.

There are of course deficiencies that can and ought to be corrected. One
is that far too few few readers take advantage of Mendele's standing
offer to publish notices of lectures, concerts, plays, classes, etc.  The
fact that such events are always "local" should not dissuade readers from
posting them for the Yiddish world to know about.

And there's even less reason why books and articles, old and new, that
deal with our concerns should not as a matter of course be mentioned,
better yet reviewed, best yet discussed by khevre Mendele.

Azoy zogt der shames.  More important, what say you?  What needs doing or
changing?  Please write.  Either directly to Mendele or, if you prefer,
to me at

                   nmiller@mail.trincoll.edu

and I can summarize for the list.

One last item.  It's now possible for most readers to download Mendele's
archives in a number of ways and I'm writing a new moreh nevuchim in that
regard.  However, for those who can't or who are still computer-shy, it
may be possible to receive the archives on floppies via ordinary mail
(U.S. only).  I'm looking into it now and will let you know soon.

A gut yontef aykh, tayere fraynt. Zayt mir alle gezunt un shtark.

Subject: Russian Yiddish Writer Query

Last night, while browsing through the library shelves, I found the book
_Russian Jewry 1917-1967_ (ed. by Gregor Aronson, Jacob Frumkin, ALexis
Goldenweiser, and Joseph Lewitan; translated by Joel Carmichael; c. 1969
by A.S. Barnes and Co., Inc.). In a chapter titled "Yiddish Literature in
Soviet Russia" I found the following passage:

	...A great many Yiddish writers who were over-age for the draft
        volunteered for the Army (Ezra Fininberg, Meir Wiener, Moshe
        Khashchevatsky, Aron Kushnirov and others). Later on it was
        established that 38 Yiddish writers were killed in battle, among
	them Moshe Khashchevatsky, Meir Wiener, S. Rosin, S. Godiner,
        Yasha Zeldin, Buzya Olevsky, A. Gurstein, Hershel Diamant, Eli
        Kagan, B. Schwedik, J. Gershenson, Peisi Altman, S. Goldenberg,
        Kurland, Dubilet and others. Therre are no lists of the dozens of
        other writers who met their deaths at the hands of the Nazis..."

Can anyone supply me with information about "J. Gershenson"? Before my
grandfather was naturalized, he shortened the family from "Gershenson" or
"Gershenzon" to "Gershen." I am curious if "J. Gershenson" was mishpoche.

Subject: Oyverbotl, oyver un eyver

Rick Gildemeister shraybt (MENDELE 3.346):

	"...Oyver/eyver means "limb" as far as I know, and the expression
	Oyver botl can carry the meaning of 'useless thing' 'worthless
        thing/person.'  ...Could it be that the meaning is something like
        a limb, which is designed to be a functioning part becomes a
        "drag" when it's 'botl?'  Useless appendage might be a
        translation; albatross around one's neck..."

An interesante teorie nor az kh'hob nisht keyn toes, plontert er "oyver"
vos af english darf zayn "violator" un "eyver" (english: "limb").  "Oyver
legt men oys azoy: ayen/vov/veyz/reysh un "eyver" azoy: alef/veyz/reysh.
Tsvey bazundere verter.  Farvos iz zayn teorie azoy interesant?  Tsulib

Subject: Source of Dzhudezmoanecdote

To: Bob Hoberman

Me of all people, who said he "didn't know where he saw it"! I *have*
that article at home. Will post the reference. "What kind of crazy
country is this where everyone talks Jewish?!?!" was covered in the same
article about Jews joining their families in Latin America.

I know this is a Yiddish list, but I can't help it, I have to correct the
author of that article on one point. He says that the interjection E!
Bre! is short for "hombre" (Hey bub!) Actually it is an adaptation of
Greek More' = Vre; this "more'" is also used in other Balkan languages.

One more: Elias Canetti said that growing up in Bulgaria, his relatives
would express distress, tiredness, etc. with the interjection "Akh aman",
which he believed had to do with Haman. Actually, again, it's a popular
Balkan expression meaning "Oy Gotenyu". Aman is an old Turkish expression
for "please".

Well, now that we've covered Plattdeutsch, etc.....  No, Bob's bringing
his message in about Dzhudezmo,and the postings about "Joodsche
Hoogduits" are very relevant; Yiddish is unusual because it is at once
private, universal, obscure, yet well connected, in ways that are being
discussed on this list, to major European national languages, and that
sensibility represented by language-and-identity has fluid boundaries and
cross-cultural features.

Subject: Friddish (French Yiddish) for Jewish mothers

See the book "French for Mrs. katz: All the French a Jewish Mother Could
Possibly Need" as published by Fawcell, $10.  One can receive advice on
how Jewish momism could say "Answer me this.  How could a woman wear such
a tasteless frock like this to her only son's wedding?"

"Dis-moi, ca, comment une femme peut porter une schmata comme ca au
mariage de sons fils unique?"

Or: "Of course I worry.  I'm your mother." which becomes:

"Bien sur je m'inquiete.  Je suis ta mere.  Oi."

And finally, the ultimate guilt giver: "How much longer will we be around to
bother you anyway?"

"Ne vouz den: combiens de temps encore serons-nous ici a t'enquiquine?"

Myself, I would have enjoyed having my mother say "Oi!! Je kvell."

Subject: Preglen

In response to Mikhl Herzog's inquiry about Slavic sources for _preglen_:
the most likely candidate would be something derived from the
proto-Slavic root  *pirg- (short i), which is related to Latin _frigere,
frictus_, whence _pommes frites_ etc. The root shows up in contemporary
Polish _prazyc'_ [dot on z] 'parch, roast, grill'; _prazucha_ [again
dotted z] 'noodles of parched buckwheat or rye flour'; Slovak _praziti_
[hacek on z] 'fry; roast'; _prazenica_ [likewise] 'fried/scrambled eggs';
_prhl'ava_ [long r] 'nettles' [which burn].  Cf. also Polish _pragna,c'_
'desire' whence _spragniony_ 'thirsty'; etc.  In his Polish etymological
dictionary Brueckner also suggests a relationshiip with Lithuanian
_sprageti_ 'crack, crackle [as of burning wood]' and Greek _asparagos_
'shoot of a plant', whence our vegetable name.

One of the more or less accepted etymologies for _Prague_ derives it from
the idea of burning off trees etc. to clear the land and hence ultimately
from the root under discussion.
