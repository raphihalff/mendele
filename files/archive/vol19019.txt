Subject: "Elisha ben Abuyah"

In response to Ben Birnbaum's enquiry (Mendele, Vol. 19.017) about Jacob 
Gordin's play "Elisha ben Abuyah":

The book "Finding the Jewish Shakespeare. The Life and Legacy of Jacob 
Gordin," by Beth Kaplan, Gordin's great-granddaughter (Syracuse University 
Press, 2007), has the following to say (p. 156) about the reception of the 
play's opening run:

"The opening night performance went on for nearly four hours. An 
English-language review, though positive, remarks dryly, 'From a Gentile 
point of view, the performance would have been better had the dialogue 
been greatly condensed.' The choice role of Shlomo Hoots was another 
triumph for Mogolescu. Adler, the review notes, 'was as superbly 
impressive as ever.' After the third act, the actor received numerous 
floral tributes and made a long speech about his problems with the actors' 
union.

"But Gordin had predicted that Elisha would not be a hit, and he was 
right: it was devastating flop, running less than a week. 'Put it on after 
my death,' he advised Adler bitterly. 'Then it will be a success.' Again, 
he was right. Following Gordin's demise, Adler mounted Elisha again. 
According to one perhaps exaggerated report, it ran for a year.

"The Forward review was a caustic piece by Cahan's then friend and 
colleague M. Baranov. Though Baranov admitted, with unusual warmth, that 
Elisha was 'one of the most powerful roles our talented dramatist-poet has 
created,' he went on to belittle the play, disagreeing with Gordin's 
portrayal of early Christians and ending, 'What started out as a grandiose 
tragedy ended up as a comedy. The heart ached for the play and its 
author.'

"Gordin was deeply hurt by the failure of a play so linked to his soul 
[...]"
Regarding a translation of the play into English: Elisha ben Abuyah does 
not appear in the list of translations into English of Gordin's plays in 
Kaplan's book (p. 255), but she writes that she possesses an unpublished 
translation by Sarah Torchinsky.

Kaplan's book, a labor of love on which she has obviously expended much 
time and effort, should nonetheless be treated with a degree of caution in 
the light of what she writes in her "Note to the Reader" at the beginning 
of the book: "And a disclaimer about accountability and accuracy: there 
are periods of Gordin's life about which very little is known. In order to 
create a vivid account I have, based on research and reading, extrapolated 
my version of the truth."

Best wishes,
Vincent Homolka

Subject: "Elisha ben Abuyah"

Mr. Birnbaum, I wonder if you have a copy of my book, "Finding the  Jewish 
Shakespeare: the life and legacy of Jacob Gordin." There are a number of 
pages dealing with this play and its reception.

To my knowledge, there is no English translation of the play. My own 
translator, Sarah Torchinsky, did a rough translation of some passages for 
me so that I could quote from the book, but it is scattered and 
unfinished.

Subject: khisorn

A friend used the word khisorn to refer to an aspect of a mutual 
acquaintance's character, referring to a lack, a deficit, or a missing 
element. I believe the spelled it Chet,Samach, Raysh, Nun- Sofit.

I'd appreciate any elaboration on its meaning/usage.

Many thanks,
Robert King

Subject: Discrepancies between Russian and Yiddish Versions of Isaac 
Babel's Story "Gedali"

I have not seen the 1926 edition of "Gedali," but in the text that has 
appeared in modern editions of "Konarmiya," the first paragraph does 
indeed end with these two sentences:

"O, istlevshie talmydy moego detstva! O, gustaya pechal' vospominanii!"

Subject: Discrepancies between Russian and Yiddish Versions of Isaac 
Babel's Story "Gedali"

Norman Buder asks for solutions to two very interesting puzzles about the 
early Yiddish translations of Babel's stories. I can't answer the first 
query, but can offer some information about the second. Mr. Buder writes:

.... The other discrepancy is that the first paragraph in Gitl Mayzil's 
translation ends with two exclamatory phrases that are absent from the 
1926 version and from Peter Constantine's English translation:

"O tliyendike gemores fun mayn kindhayt! O gedikhter umet fun zikhroynes!"

Again two possible explanations seem possible: (a) Gitl Mayzil translated 
phrases that were in an early Russian version but were omitted in the 1924 
and 1926 publications;

(b) Gitl Mayzil introduced phrases into the story without any 
justification in Babel's original.
Does anyone know which explanation is correct?

The phrases in question are:
"O, istlevshie talmudy moego detstva! O, gustaya pechal' vospominanii!"

It is not only the 1924 and 1926 publications that omitted these phrases, 
but every other edition of Babel's Konarmiya published in the Soviet Union 
hereafter did the same, substituting an ellipsis for them. Even the 
edition published in Russia in 2005 (Isaak Babel', Konarmiya; Odesskie 
rasskazy. Moscow: ACT, 2005) left them out.

The two phrases are present in an edition published in Israel in 1979 
(Isaak Babel', Detstvo i drugie rasskazy. Jerusalem: Biblioteka-Aliya, 
1979), which gives the original publication information in an end note:

"First printing: the newspaper Izvestiya Odesskogo gubispolkoma (1923), 
under the heading 'From the book Konarmiya'; second, in the journal 
Krasnaya nov', 1924, no. 4, June--July. Dated: 'Zhitomir, June 1920'." The 
editor also states, with respect to the two phrases: "Missing in later 
editions."

The most recent edition (as far as I know) of Babel's collected works in 
Russian (Isaak Babel', Sobranie Sochinenii. 4 vols. Moscow: Vremya, 2006) 
restores the missing words.

It is interesting that in Walter Morison's translation, Isaac Babel, The 
Collected Stories (New York: Criterion, 1955; New York: New American 
Library, 1960), the phrases are present:

"O the rotted Talmuds of my childhood! O the dense melancholy of 
memories!"

They are also present in David McDuff's translation (Isaac Babel, 
Collected Stories. London: Penguin, 1994):

"Oh, Talmuds of my childhood, turned to dust! Oh, dense sadness of 
memories
!"
All of this obviously vindicates Gitl Mayzil's translation, and the answer 
to your puzzle is:
(a) Gitl Mayzil translated phrases that were in an early Russian version 
but were omitted in the 1924 and 1926 publications.

Subject: "Shmaravoznik"

Can anyone shed any light on the source of either the melody or the lyrics 
of the song "Shmaravoznik," (also known as "Vos bistu broyges?") recorded 
by Marty Levitt? The same melody also appears in one of Dzigan and 
Schumacher's sketches about two conmen in Tel Aviv prison.

Subject: shvartser

Regarding Paul Glasser's comment of 12/28 on the use of "shvartser": 
("'Shvartser' in Yiddish is to the best of my knowledge an euphemism, not 
a slur. 'Neger' is probably a recent borrowing from German.")

... my own experience, dating back 75 years, was different.  As poor as we 
were in the hard years of the depression, on occasional Friday afternoons 
my mother would have in a sorry, alcoholic black woman,  to scrub the 
kitchen floor, whom she referred to as "di shvartse."  We all knew the 
woman's true name, Mrs. Crawford.  But like the Duke in Feuchtwanger's 
"Jew Suess," who for the hell of it referred to Suess, his indispensable 
man, as "the Jew," my mother spoke of Mrs. Johnson, in the third person, 
as "di shvartse."  ("Die shvartse vet haynt kumen," etc. )  To me that 
sounded, with its overtones, like "the nigger."
