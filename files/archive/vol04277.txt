Subject: The latest from Buenos Aires

On Friday morning the President of the Argentine YIVO, Moishe Korin,
visited YIVO in New York, and gave us a bit of an update on the situation
in Buenos Aires, since my visit there in late November.  In a week or
two, groundbreaking is expected to take place for the reconstruction of
the AMIA building at Pasteur 633. The Foreign Minister of Israel, Shimon
Peres, has been invited to attend.  The building will be recessed from
the street and will be somewhat taller than the one that was bombed; it
will also have cosiderably greater security than it did before July 18th.
Construction is due to last about a year-and-a-half.

YIVO-BA is to be allotted from one-and-a-half to two floors in the new
AMIA building, which will house all of the agencies that were in the old
building -- and not just the cultural agencies, as previously reported.
Meanwhile, the surviving archives have been moved to the Kultur-kongres
building (YIVO-BA and the Kultur- kongres merged in mind-1993), while the
books remain stored in a synagogue basement near the AMIA.

Prof. Korin also left a brochure containing a proposal for the
conservation of the artworks that were damaged by the explosion. I have
spoken with several people in the Jewish museum field, and there is some
interest in a small traveling exhibit, which would display selected
paintings by Maurice Minkowski (the best-known painter represented in the
YIVO-BA's collections) along with photographs and text panels depicting
the bombing and its aftermath.

Subject: Einstein-Relativity/Explaining the Exotic

In Mendele 4,272, Leon Lipson recounted a version of the Yiddish joke
about the college-educated son, Einstein and relativity, with the
end-lines:

> "Ah-ha?  Und fun azelkhen narrishkaiten klaibt Einstein parnosseh?"

I recall the parallel verison that ends with a different punch-line:

  "Ah-ha?  Und fun das makst a yid a lebn?"

Subject: A correction

I hasten to publish, with apologies, the following correction:  In my
posting "The Honorific Reb" (4.269,6) the statement "...khashmenoim,
after Bar Kokhba and his five sons who led the revolt against the Roman
authorities..." should read:   "khashmenoim, the Maccabees father and
five sons who led the revolt against the Greeks..."  I greatly regret the
error.

I have learned from all my teachers, and (I hope) from all my mistakes.

Subject: A shayle far noyekh

Discovering Mendele last month was a homecoming for me; the past flows
into the present, filling me with memories of merry-making at the Purim
seudah, of the awesome Peysakh seder, of the pilpl of Arbeter Ringniks
who were ever talkative, ever debating. Mendele is the Yiddishe shule
where Adele Opatashu, Yankov Levine, N.B. Minkoff, Bez and Yefroiken, all
stretched our minds, touched our hearts and enriched our souls. We gave
them our Saturdays and Sundays to fill with the magic of mame loshn and
idealism and social justice. All for Mame Yiddish that we had sucked in
along with our mother's milk. A hartzikn dank aykh ale Mendelniks who are
the mortar and bricks of this network, this new sturdy shule.

Some thoughts about the network to share with you:

As a timorous newcomer, I am apprehensive about posting my thoughts (or
questions) about usage or transliteration, as I think that perhaps they
have been discussed, dissected, or disputed and put to bed in the past.
And who wants to be redundant or a nudnik? (Do I speak for other new kids
on the block?)

Also, I wonder is there a way to call up the introductions (or short
bios) of the Mendelyaner? (A shayle for Noyekh?) So many names posted are
familiar, yet all remain phantoms. For a start, I marvel at the beautiful
prose and sensitivity of Louis Fridhandler, at the knowledgeability of
Zellig Bach, at the deep, immediate responses of Mikhl Herzog, David
Braun, Mendy Fliegler, Harvey Spiro, Moshe Waldoks, and all of you (wish
I could name you all), whose love of Yiddish, of words, make Mendele the
wondrous home that it is. It would enhance the words and concepts
exchanged to know the name, rank and serial number of the contributor.

Subject: Jews and Poles in Krakow

I'm beginning a research project on relations between Jews and Poles in
Krakow during the interwar period.  Since there seems to have been more
assimilation in Krakow than in other Polish cities, I thought Krakow
might be a good place to look for such interaction.

Does anyone know of anyone with firsthand knowledge of Krakow during this
period (1918-1939) or of memoirs that might be relevant?  According to
one article I've read (by Czeslaw Brzoza in the most recent issue of
Polin, a journal devoted to the study of Polish Jews), the Jewish press
in Krakow was predominantly in the Polish language.  What does this mean
for the status of Yiddish in Krakow?  How important was Krakow to Yiddish
literature?  Perhaps largely because of its ties to Austria, Krakow
doesn't seem to have been as important for Yiddish writers as other
Polish cities like Warsaw and Lodz, but surely there must be references
to Krakow in Yiddish literature.  Does anybody know of any?
