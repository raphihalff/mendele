Subject: Khaver

The various recollections of 'khaver' and its use perhaps don't go back
far enough to The Bund in Poland (the source of the Arbeter Ring).  This
is prior to "comrade" in its specifically Bolshevik usage and refers to
the idea of fraternity and "brotherhood" -- a special bonding.  As I grew
up in a socialist/unionist context, 'khaver' and 'khaverte' were the
equivalent of the common trade-union 'brother' and 'sister' as well as
having the 'comradeship' connotation.  The common form of address in the
US [English-language] trade-union was 'brother' and 'sister' as in the
Jewish-language unions it was 'khaver/khaverte.'

'Bund' may be due to German influence (listed and detailed in Harkavy in
its Jewish-Polish usage).  A classic sociological study of "the Bund" as
a form of human social relationship treats it as a special form of human
bonding and of course it means more generally confederation or covenant
as in Bundesrepublik or as in my 1880's German dictionary 'bundeslade' =
Ark of the Covenant.  In the German-language unions, 'genosse'
[genossenschaft] was widely used for 'brother/comrade' rather than the
alternative [later?] 'c/kamerad' which came from the French 'camarade.'
In Brecht's _Der Teppichweber von Kujan-Bulak Ehren Lenin_ (written
before 1933) he uses "Genosse/n Lenin" for "comrade Lenin."

Clearly, what Yiddish needs is a dictionary like the OED with citations
and dates of usage showing meaning(s) in context.  Mendele's learned
contributors (unlike linguistically ignorant amateurs like myself) are
providing raw material for such a project.  Let's hope it gets done.

Subject: More on _khaver_

In addition to _khaver_, note the Yiddish variant _khover_ 'Fellow',
'fellowship holder'.

As for the political associations of the word, Paul Pascal recalls the
feminine _khaverte_ from the political left in Winnipeg. In Toronto, we
distinguished the Labor Zionist feminine _khavEYre_, from the
non-(originally anti-)Zionist Workmen's Circle feminine _khAverte_.

Subject: Names and name-pairing

Dovid Braun and Khayim Bochner inquire about Shmuel-Zanvl. There are
various principles at work in Yiddish name-pairing:

I. Etymologically disparate equivalents:

a) _Shrage-Fayvl (= Fayvush)_: _Shrage_ = Aramaic 'light' (?) _Fayvush_
(probably = Phoebus(-Apollo), although Latin _vivus_ has also been
proposed_. _Fayvush/Fayvl_ is called up to the Torah as _Shrage_. In
Israel, today, there is a frequent pairing of _Fayvush_ with _Uri_,
instead. Similarly, _Faytl_ [Vital(y), Vidal] is called up as _Khayim_.

b) _Dov-Ber_, Tsvi-Hirsh_, Arye-Leyb are of the same order-- translations
eqivalents.

c) Also, more or less translation equivalents: _Menakhem- Man/Mendl_
involves the misinterpretation of the Hebrew-origin _Menakhem_ as the
diminutive of German _Mann_, i.e., _Maenchen_, of which _Mendl_ is the
Yiddish equivalent.

This may come closest to the pattern of the sought after _Shmuel-Zanvil_.
The latter is, I believe, ultimately derived from a German rendition of
"Samuel": [Zamuel, Zanuel, Zanvl].

II. Tribe and totem; quite a different pairing of some of the names in b)
above: _Naftoli-Hirsh_, _Yehudo-Leyb_, _Osher- Lam/Leml_.

III. Traditional pairings for which I don't know the rationale: _Itshe
(=Yitskhok)-Mayer_, _Yekhiel-Mikhl_ (not me, by the way; I'm
_Yisroyel-Mikhl_), _Yaynkef-Yitskhok_ (pairing of the "fathers",
perhaps).

I'd be glad to learn of other categories or explanations that any of you
can adduce (and the reason for Dovid and Khaim's query).

Subject: Tifle and tume

A belated contribution to Zellig Bach's discussion of "tifle" and "tume":

The Jewish practice of referring to Christian places of worship by
derogatory terms ("dysphemisms"?) is very old and continues into modern
times.

The Cambridge University Library manuscript (Taylor- Schechter 10. K. 22)
published by L. Fuks as *The Oldest Known Literary Documents of Yiddish
Literature* (1957) dates from 1382 and includes a fragment of an Old
Yiddish adaptation of a German epic poem, "Dukus Horant".  There already,
instead of the anticipated Middle High German "munster", we find "tifle".

There is a town somewhere in Ukraine called "Byelaya Tserkve" ("White
Church") [Slavicists please excuse or, better still, correct the
Russian/Ukrainian]. Jews frequently referred to it as "shvarts tume" or,
more accurately in the regional dialect, "shvarts time".

My father who lived in Vilne as a child around the turn of the century
spoke of a church there that was referred to by Jews as "al di blinde
kloyster".  His account was as follows [once again I crave indulgence
from the Slavicists]: the church was called "wsyech swyati" ("all
saints"); this was distorted to "wsyech slyapi" ("all blind") which then
became "al di blinde".
