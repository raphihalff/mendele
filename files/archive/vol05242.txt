In 5.240 Andrew Cassel wrote:

"..did this bit of U.S. slang make its way back across the ocean in time to be
incorporated into 20th century Litvish Yiddish vernacular? Ver veyst?"

James Fenimore Cooper's novels were immensely popular among German youths
before the much inferior writings of Karl May took their place. The title of
one of Cooper's works was translated as (from memory) _Der letzte der
Mohikaner_.  This phrase has entered the German vernacular and is still in use
as a jocular expletive when referring to the last instance of anything, not
necessarily restricted to people.

Subject: Der letster Mohicaner

Can you really call the expression „The Last of the Mohicans“ slang? In any
event, I would simply assume that it was not the expression but the book that
first made its way among Yiddish speakers in Europe, along with numerous other
English and other European language works titles.  As a teen-ager in pre World
War I Poland, my mother read Dumas’ _Count of Monte Cristo and _  Victor
Hugo’s _  Der mentsh vos lakht_ in Yiddish).  _Tom Jones_ was a Yiddish
favorite, too.  Why not _Der letster Mohikaner?_ Still, I must admit that I
don’t know this for a fact.  Zachary?

Subject: Der letster Mohikaner

An abridged translation of The Last of the Mohicans was published in Warsaw,
1921.  Here is the full citation:

Der letster Mohikaner.  Yidish:  R-vitsh.  Varshe:  B. Shimin, 1921.
127 p.  (Yugnt-biblyotek; [no. 16])

The author's name, at head of title, is given as F. Kuper. According to the
Library of Congress catalog card, R-vitsh is actually a pseudonym for David
Kassel [Dovid Kasel] (1881-1935).

This is probably the only translation of this work into Yiddish. It is
possible that the Yiddish expression "Der letster Mohikaner" predates this
publication, since Cooper's work was translated into other languages and may
have been accessible to Eastern European Jews in those languages.  The
expression might also have been found in Yiddish journalism before 1921.

Subject: Tumbalalaika

Re:  Serge Rogosin's query some time back about the origins of Tumbalalaika:
some months ago Yoyne-Brayne and I were surprised to hear the song on Max
Ferguson's program of folk songs on CBC radio, identified as "a Ukrainian folk
song".  I don't remember if it had Ukrainian lyrics or was an instrumental
piece; it was not in Yiddish, anyway, but the tune was clearly recognizable.
Did any other Canadian khaveyrim hear that program?  Can anyone follow up on
this clue?

"Iker shokhakhti!"  A groysn dank tsu di khaveyrim vos hobn rekomandirt

Subject: The anomalous spelling of the suffixes -heyt, -keyt

The normal dialect correspondences --Northeastern and Southeastern Yiddish
[ey]--Central Yiddish [ay], represented in Standard Yiddish spelling by _tsvey
yudn,_ does _not_ apply to the the suffixes -heyt and -keyt which, while also
spelled with _tsvey yudn_ are rendered with [ey] _only_ in Southeastern
Yiddish. In Central Yiddish, as expected, they are realized with [ay].In the
Northeast, however, (Litvish!!!), they are anomalously [ay].  The most
accomodating spelling is, thus, _tsvey yudn_ alone. The worst it can lead to
is the Litvak reading it as [ey].

The suggested alternative, writing these suffixes with [ay] instead would be
OK for Litvish version but, the normal dialectal correspondences would yield
Southeastern [a] and Central Yiddish long [a:]. Hence . . . .
