Subject: Was Sholem Aleichem a Yiddishist?

David Herskovic (6.122, 6) questions whether Sholem Aleichem was a
Yiddishist.

Yo, Sholem-Aleykhem iz gevorn a yidishist trit bay trit. Ongehoybn hot
er in zayne yunge yorn. A briv tsu Shemen Dubnov iz shaykh. In _Fun
Zhargon tsu Yidish_, fun Shemen Dubnov, Vilna, Kletskin 1929, zaytn
64-65, shraybt Sholem-Aleykhem tsu Dubnov af Rusish (ibergezetst fun
Dubnov af yidish):

Baylegndik derbay mayn khibur "Dos Bintl Blumen" oder "Der Buket,"
_ferzn in proze_ (in der yidisher shprakh der ershter pruv tsu shraybn
azelkhe lider, vos derfirt di shprakh tsu fulshtendikeyt, nisht
onkumendik nisht tsu keyn daytshe, nisht tsu keyn rusishe oysdrukn un
verter), bet ikh aykh tsu gebn dem a por verter inem noentstn bukh fun
Voskhod.

[Translation] Enclosing herewith my work, "The Bunch of Flowers" or "The
Bouquet," lines in prose (the first attempt in this Jewish language to
write such poems that take the language to completeness without
resorting to German or Russian expressions and words), so I plead with
you to devote a few words to this in the next issue of Voskhod [a
Russian language periodical of Jewish interest].

Sholem Aleichem also devoted his writing, editorial and publishing
efforts to produce two massive volumes of Di Yidishe Folks-Bibliotek,
the first anthologies of the best Yiddish writing in 1888 and 1889. The
Jewish world was stunned and delighted. Peretz published his very first
Yiddish work in those two anthologies.

While he traveled to give public readings he was delighted to discover
Yiddish expressions, and he used them in his works. That must have
caused them to be spread over the Yiddish-speaking world, enriching the
language and increasing its value as a lingua franca. There is, of
course, more evidence that Sholem Aleichem was an influential
Yiddishist, becoming even more emotionally involved over the years; but
enough for now.

He wanted his work to reach more of the world than Yiddish could, and so
he was eager to see his work translated into Russian, English and other
languages.

As to Sholem Aleichem's use of the term, zhargon, to designate Yiddish.
He meant no disparagement. Zhargon was a pejorative term back when Moses
Mendelssohn used it, but it eventually became a neutral term. That's how
Sholem Aleichem used it. See Max Weinreich's History of the Yiddish
Language (English translation) pp. 321-322. In the early 1900s it was
replaced by the term Yiddish. Jargon is in use again as a pejorative
term for Yiddish along with hodge-podge. Vos veysn azoyne mentshn? Ikh
her zey vi dem koter.

Subject: Sholem Aleichem's letters in Russian

Iosif Vaisman (6.122, 5) cites a 1970s Moscow publication that includes
letters by Sholem Aleichem and that all letters to family members from
this sample are in Yiddish. This is totally at variance with the
collection of letters in Dos Sholem-Aleykhem Bukh, 1926, 1958, compiled,
edited and partly written by I.D. Berkowitz, Sholem Aleichem's
son-in-law and close confidant from 1905 to 1916. One hundred and eleven
letters are in Russian to family members (children, wife, son-in-law
Mikhail, niece Natasha, grandchildren). It might be useful to compare
the particular letters in the 1970s Moscow publication with perhaps
identical letters in Dos Sholem-Aleykhem Bukh. Did those editors,
perchance, omit noting that the letters were translated from the Russian
original as noted in Dos Sholem-Aleykhem Bukh? Or did they find letters
completely uncharacteristic of those selected by Berkowitz?

Sholem Aleichem wrote in Yiddish to brother Vevik and mother-in-law
Rokhl Loyev.  He wrote Hebrew to son-in-law I.D. Berkowitz and brother
Elyohu. He wrote Russian to other family members according to the
letters compiled in Dos Sholem-Aleykhem Bukh. That is the only
publication I can think of at the moment that is careful to note the
original language of each letter. And of course he did not abandon
Yiddish in the family, but Russian was the everyday language. See Marie
(daughter Marusi) Waife-Goldberg's biography of her father.

I can't resist quoting Sholem Aleichem's letter from America to
4-year-old Bella in Odessa, charming and poignant. It was translated
into Yiddish from Russian by her father Mikhail Kaufman.

August 5, 1915

Mayn libe, tayere Belotshke!

Ikh shrayb dir, az bay aykh iz a milkhome un bay undz nit, az du bist in
odes afn fontan un mir in Amerike af a datshe, un az do iz zeyer heys,
un az bay aykh iz faran a yam, heyst er der Shvartser Yam, un bay undz

ikh dir, az ikh hob dikh zeyer zeyer lib un az ikh hof nokh tsu zen dikh
un di mame un dem papa Mikhail, vos iz shoyn bald a doktor.  Un ikh bin
nit kayn doktor.  Ikh bin a shrayber.

Dayn papa Sholem-Aleykhem
(From Mikhail Kaufman's memoir in Dos Sholem-Aleykhem Bukh, p. 138)

Sholem Aleichem did not want to be called "zeyde."
