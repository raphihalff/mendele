Subject: Gotenyu ti nash

Two or three people have correctly identified the _ti
nash_ used by Manger as Russian or Polish (or Ukrainain
or other Slavic), but didn't quite get the sense of the
whole phrase _Gotenyu ti nash_. It's a vocative phrase,
something like "Thou/You God of ours." This kind of
mixture of Slavic and Yiddish and/or Hebrew is found in
a sizeable body of hassidic songs, presumably
reflecting the inclination of at least some hassidim to
find mystical meaning in objects of everyday life that
surrounded them, including the non- Jewish languages
that they heard around them.

Subject: Jacinta un Talila

The welcome message on subscription suggests I quickly
introduce myself. So here goes...

ikh lern zikh tsur tsayt yidish. ikh red shoyn daytsh,
vos helft zeyer fil (mayn mame-loshn iz frantseyzikh).
shver zaynen far mir di oysyes un di hebraishe verter.

ober far vos lern ikh zikh yidish?

- shprakhn zaynen zeyer interesant, shpetsiel far mir
  der varglaykh tsvikhn yidish un daytsh (vi a rayze in
  der fargangenheyt).

- ikh hob mir tsvey CDs gekoyft, vos vundershoyn zaynen
  un vos ikh vil beser farshteyn ("Jacinta, Autres
  chansons yiddish" [Ocora] un "Talila et l'ensemble
  Kol Aviv" [Arion] -- hot ir di gehert?).

- ikh hof yidn (un ire tife sheroshim) beser tsu
  farshteyn.

Well, enough (and enough mistakes -- transliteration is
easier to read than to write, esp. with german writing
habits!) for a first post.  Now I will listen!  I hope
this mailing list will be yet another source of info on
this fascinating language and the folks who speak it.

Nor a goy,

Pierre (my friend Rivka calls me Pierrele)

Is there an FAQ for this list.  Questions I have
include:  Is there a standard codepage for Yiddish
(maybe iso8859 addresses this?)?  I have found some TeX
fonts which look very nice (still have to learn TeX),
but no X11 font.  Are there some?  Is transliteration
the standard mode in this group?

BTW, I did hack one X11 font (based on lucidatypewriter
14).  Also I suppose I'll find the answers to some/all
of these questions on the backfiles, so maybe you
should tell me where to get them from.

A groysn dank,
Pierre Lewis
