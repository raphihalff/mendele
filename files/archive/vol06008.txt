Subject: Mazl tov, Mendele, and happy 5th Anniversary

I add my appreciative name to the list of Mendele's well-wishers.  Having
joined the family late, only a year and a half ago, I am filled with awe at
his ability and dedication for so many capable man hours of labor. I also seek
advice from you elder statesmen. Like the sorcerer's apprentice, my Mendele
printouts seem to reproduce in the filing cabinet, and have over run my
garage, my study, and kitchen counters. I hope we will not have to buy a
bigger house to accomodate this year's output with its increase in
subscribers. Long may we continue in our work for, and our love of, Yiddish!

Subject: Tsatskele revisited

I liked Ellen Prince's definition of tsatskele as a 'young woman to
reckon with' and I wonder would  "Oy, iz dos a meydele! mit an oyringl!"
have identical meaning or nuances of different implications?

Welcome back to Harvey Spiro and his intelligent posting re: tsatske,
etc. our thanks for his proposed etymologies.

Subject: Sholem Aleykhem reading

It is not often I am speechless, but how to thank Mark David is a
problem this morning for taking us back in time and creating so moving
an experience for us.

Bravo! Bravisimo! rings hollow when someone leads you to a voice from a
literary burning bush.

We replayed it twice and found the sound clear and audible. A blessing
on your head! Greedily, we call for more, more!

I would like to ask if the writer Lawrence Sanders is Jewish. I need
this information for my research on "Jewish English". This author uses
well quite often Yiddish expressions in his novels.

Subject: Workmen's Circle Convention

I would like to pass along some notes about the 1996 biennial convention
of the Workmen's Circle/Arbeter Ring held at the Nevele Hotel 2 weeks
ago.

In addition to reports and discussions on various aspects of WC
activities, much time and programming were allotted to Yiddish culture,
with sessions on Yiddish drama given by Chayale Ash, Yiddish song by
Zalmen Mlotek, conversational Yiddish by Brucha Lang; also programs
devoted to the Shule, the children's and adults' camps Kinder Ring and
Circle Lodge.

President Barnett Zumoff gave the beginning of his address in Yiddish
and Executive Director Robert Kaplan interjected a few Yiddish phrases,
like "a shenere un besere velt" which embodies the spirit and goal of
the Arbeter Ring.  Some guest speakers made a point of referring to this
phase of the organization's program, like Maynard Wishner, President,
Council of Jewish Federations, a graduate of the WC schools, who told of
a recent emotional experience he had when speaking Yiddish to Russian
Jews at Babi Yar in Kiev.

Other prestigious guests who let a Yiddish word or two drop included
Jerry Goodman, Executive Director, National Committee for Labor Israel,
Ambassador Colette Avital, Consul General of Israel in New York, Jack
Sheinkman, President, Americans for Democratic Action (alumnus of WC
schools), Bess Myerson, former NY City Commissioner for Cultural
Affairs, who is now helping Russian immigrants at the Jewish Braille
Institute and using Yiddish in her work.

The Traditional Friday Yiddish Cultural evening program introduced by
Joseph Mlotek, former Educational Director of the Arbeter Ring, gave
tribute to veterans Ben Gebiner and Will Stern, former executive
directors.  A moving musical montage on the 95th anniversary of the
organization was prepared and staged by Zalmen Mlotek with the able
participation of Adrienne Cooper and Henry Sapoznik.

At the close of the convention three ardent Yiddishists were elected to
office: Shelby Shapiro - treasurer, Abigail Mandel - vice chairman, and
Mark or Moish Mlotek - president, whose inaugural address also began in
Yiddish - a tradition of newly-elected presidents.  There was a
singalong in Yiddish, prizes awarded for exceptional cultural activities
presented by Cultural Director Chava Lapin.  The spirit and enthusiasm
ran high and hopefully will bring good results. Incidentally, at one
point in his speech Moish divulged the solution of the Yiddish puzzle
that Yosl and I present in our column "Perl fun der yidisher poezye" in
the Forverts and I thought perhaps other Mendelistn would enjoy
participating in it.  The puzzle appears every two weeks and deals with
various topics like holidays, literature, music, theater, etc.

Subject: Yiddish and Franz Kafka

In 1912 (18 February - Sunday) Franz Kafka delivered a lecture about
Yiddish language. The lecture was preface to Jizchak Lowy's  (1887-1942)
reading of poems.  This happened in Praga.  Jizchak  Lowy was  the actor
from Poland (from  Warsaw ?).  Franz Kafka  told  that  Yiddish has only
400  years and  it is the youngest european language.  It has no grammar
yet.  As we know  the first scientific book  about  Yiddish grammar was:
S. A. Birnbaum,  Praktische  Grammatik  der jiddischen  Sprache fur  den
Selbstunterricht, published in Wien in 1918.  Franz said that Yiddish is
still in use. It is changing.  Sometimes Yiddish was more consequent  in
developing  a form than  modern German language. And for example form in
Yiddish "mir seinem"  (we are)  from  middle-high-German  "sin"  (to be)
developed  more  naturally  than  modern  German  "wir sind"  (we  are).
Sometimes  Yiddish  preserved  middle-high-German  forms.  For  example:
"kerzlach",  "blumlach"  and  "liedlach".  Now in German language  those
words sound: "Kerzchen", "Blumchen", "Liedchen". One of the poems which
was reading by J. Lowy is called "Sand and Stars" by  Simon Samuel Frug
(1860-1916)  "Samd  un  schtern".  It  is a bitter interpretation of
biblical promise: we will be as sand and stars.  Franz Kafka  adds:
"Nun,  getreten wie der Sand sind wir schon, wann wird das mit den
Sternen wahr werden?".

See: E.T. Beck, Kafka and the Yiddish Theater. Its impact on his work,
Madison, Milwaukee, London, 1971

If someone is interested - please feel free to send me your notices and
also questions. I could write more about Franz Kafka and Yiddish then. I
can also give more sources (bibliography).

P.S. -  excuse me for any errors in writing - but my native language is
polish.
