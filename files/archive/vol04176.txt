Subject: Re: Oifn pripetchek

David Ferleger asks about the origins of Oifn Pripetchek brent a
fyerel..un in shtub siz hes...und der rebbe lernt kleyne kinderlach  dem
aleph bayz.

I do not know the orining but I remember this as my earliest memory of
Iddish sog. I was a baby in my crib on one side of the orom. On the
other, my mother lay  very ill with diphtheria ( the days before
vaccinations of course ..she is almost 94 now).  Weakly , she  sang oifn
pripetcheck...and i tried hard to get myself up to hol on to the crib
bars and listened.  My father nursed her through that awful time...but i
have never forgotten the special ness of this song...it must have been
special for a long time...for her to choose to communicate with me
whenshe could not even lift her head off a pillow.... For many years I
have been a Yiddish folksinger...but this song will always remain very
precious..  I would like to nknow not only who wrote it, but how it
achieved the popularity it did by the late 1920s.

Subject: Games with young children

In response to Miki Safadi's request for bube-baby games, does he know
"Soreke, voreke?" It is spoken or chanted while pinching the skin on top of
the child's hand while the child does the same to the hand of the other
player, who says: "Soreke, voreke, kashe mit milekh, ver s'vet veln, deym'l
ikh geybn, ver s'vet veynen, deym'l ikh shlugen." At the conclusion of
which both throw their hands up in the air and laugh, maybe with tickling.

Subject: Feygelakh un zomerfeygelakh--videramol

Many of you will remember the contentious and interesting thread we had
on the subject of "feygele" and kindred Yiddish words for gays/lesbians,
that we had last March-April, and which culminated in a column on the
subject by the pseudonymous Philologos, in the Forward.  This has been
simmering in my brain for a while, and I'd like to put together a little
paper on the subject, with all due acknowledgements to Mendelnikes who
contributed postings on this.

Don't want to repeat what's already been discussed, but have a few
questions on which I'd be grateful for any speculations:

1) Zomerfeygele is obviously a dialect word for "butterfly."  But in
which dialect (s) of Yiddish is this known?

2. Any Slavicists out there know of any sexual connotations of
"butterfly" in Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, etc. ?

3. Does anyone know how to get in touch with Eve Sicular, who is (was?) a
curator at YIVO.  In March she posted that she was publishing an article
entitled "A Yingl mit a yinl hot epes a tam" in the Journal of Jewish
Folklore and Ethnography later in the year.  I'd very much like to read
this article, but we don't have the journal in the UW library, and I
don't want to wait for the interminable workings of ILL.  Has anyone seen
this article, and know how to procure it?

Don't know if #2-3 would be of general interest to others on the list.
Use your judgement-feel free to send to my email address.  A sheynem dank
in foroys tsum alemen.

Subject: Freylakh lider

After being blown away by the Klezmatics in concert here the other day,
I'm happily humming several tunes from their first recording, "Shvaygn =
Toyt". I'd enjoy it all the more if I could find a copy of the lyrics,
which don't appear on the cassette I purchased. Can anyone direct me to,
or better yet post, the words to "Dzhankoye" and "Ale brider"? A sheynem
dank in faroys ...

The University of Connecticut Dramatic Arts Department is staging Fiddler
on th e Roof.  They request of me advice on authenticity of costume
design.  What advice do you have for me as to whom to contact or what to
suggest? A sheynem dank

Subject: A new way of getting back issues

For Mendele subscribers in the United States:

Here is a new alternative for those who would like a complete file of
Mendele but are either daunted by the time-consuming process of
downloading or unable to use ftp: Mendele on disks.

You can have a set of Mendele from Vol. 1.001 to the most recent number.
And perform a mitsva.  Here is the procedure.

     1. Send three 3.5" formatted HD disks to the address below.  They
     _must_ be formatted.  They _must_ be HD.*  They _must_ be
     accompanied by a stamped self-addressed envelope (SASE).  Be sure
     that the return postage is sufficient.

     2. Indicate whether the formatted disks are for a PC or
     Macintosh.

     3. Include a check (minimum $18 but $1000 would be better) made out
     to:

        Exprinter International Bank, N.V. Account # 36083629

     In addition, please enter the following in the Memo area:

        Instituto Cientifico Judio -IWO- Argentina, Reference #11159

        (sorry, but _all_ of this _must_ appear on the check)

These funds will be used to repair and rebuild the bomb-damaged
Argentine branch of YIVO that has played such a vital role not only for
the Yiddish-speaking Jews of Argentina but for Jewish culture throughout
the world.

The disks will include a utility for uncompressing the files on PC
machines.  Unfortunately it is technically impossible to include a
comparable utility for Macintoshes.  Mac owners who don't already have
one can download one from the Mendele archives by anonymous ftp from the
Mendele archives.  Its name is:  Be sure to set the transmission at
binary.

Please note: disks will not be sent unless _all_ of the conditions are
met.  Don't court disappointment by sending the shames money for _him_ to
buy stamps, etc.  He's notoriously lazy and won't do it.  Besides, he's
not to be trusted with cash and there are four bookstores in the half-
dozen blocks between his house and the post office).  So be forewarned
and bear in mind that your check will go off to Argentina in any case.

If you have any questions before sending off your disks, an e-mail
message will be answered promptly.  You can also phone.

* A HD disk has 1.4 mb capacity and is easily identified because it has
_2_ square holes (one opposite the write-protect hole).
