Subject: Yiddish tongue twisters

My grandfather, a"h, who was from Bendin, Poland, had one:

	di post iz mit paketn bapakt

Try that one five or six times quickly, and see what happens.  :-)

Zayt mir ale gezunt un shtark.

Subject: Tongue twister

My father taught us that tongue twister.  As I recall it, the complete rhyme
went - 
Fun Alesk biz kayn Brisk
Trogt a fiks a biks in pisk.

Subject: Figs

In my family, from Russia, the fig was always an obscene gesture.  It was
widely known as such by Jews; I recollect a story by Sholem Aleichem 
(unfortunately, I do not recollect its name), in which two professional
card-swindlers, claiming to be grandsons of the Baal Shem Tov who have never
before seen playing cards, cheat some Jewish youths out of their money one
Hanuka.  The last words of the story are that the swindlers, out of the window
of a train leaving town, send to their victims a gesture "consisting of two
and a half fingers."

Subject: shlock

I have heard the word shlock for the sukkah but I have not heard it used for 
roof. I think the suka shlock comes from the word shloksregn which means 
pouring rain (Harkavy). The shlock is a dakh in the case of a rain.  The most
simple shlock is a folded up plastic which you roll out on the sukakh when it
rains.

In a "shlock zol ihm trefn", shlock means a mishap should come upon him.
Shlack, shleck (plural) means appolexy or a mishap (harkavy).

A shlack zol eikh nisht trefn

Subject: Yiddish-Hebrew dictionary and Superstitions

Ada Holtzman asks for a Yiddish-Hebrew dictionary -- there is an excellent
2-volume (Y-H, H-Y) dictionary by M. Tsanin, published by (and presumably
available from) Leivick House, Dov Hoz Street, Tel-Aviv.

More superstitions coming back -- sorry, now that I've started, I can't stop!
;) 
Two (or more) people may not dress a person simultaneously -- this was
explained to me as being something done to corpses and therefore mustn't be
done to living people. (The question usually arose when dressing a child.)
(The evil spirits sure have a lot of trouble distinguishing the living from
the dead -- so many superstitions relate to this potential confusion!)

If it rains on someone's wedding day, it means the bride likes sweets (or is a
nosher, or is a freser -- depending on how much you disliked the bride ;) ).

You must never take food from a house where they're sitting shiva. (A most
annoying belief when we were racking up 30-50 cakes a day after my mother died
-- there were only so many cakes the few non-Jews in the apartment building
could handle!)

If you give someone a purse/wallet, you must put some money in it.

If you give someone something sharp (brooch, knife...), you will no longer be
friends.

And, lest you think my family was totally retarded, I must relate this memory.
Don't know if this was the when the Kohanim went up but there was some point
in the High Holy Days service when the men drew their taleysim over their
heads and everyone had to look down and not look toward the ark. My father
never mentioned blindness but he made it VERY clear that looking was strictly
forbidden 'because there would be angels that came down to the ark and God
didn't want us to see them.' Well, one year I looked. And then of course I was
consumed with guilt and fear and, a few days later, finally confessed to my
father:
	Me: Daddy, I did a terrible thing. You know, when you're
            not supposed to look in shul? Well, I looked. [Sob sob]
        Father: Nu, it's not so terrible. When I was your age,
            I looked too. [Characteristic lop-sided shrug indicating
	    'no big deal']
        Me: But Daddy, I didn't see any angels!
	Father: Nu, I didn't see any angels either... [Wink]

Finally, does anyone know where the Israeli superstition comes from that says
you must never give someone an even number of flowers? Might that be Turkish?
Or is it known in the Jewish Diaspora? (Flower-giving was not exactly big in
my house, I must say, so maybe it was even known in Brooklyn but not by me.)

From: Meyer Wolf <wolfim@idt.net>
Subject: davnen

A. Manaster Ramer traces davenen (originally daven) to the Hebrew root D-B-B,
whose primary sense is 'to move the lips', claiming that this etymology
accounts for the meaning of davnen. I do not see how "lip moving" accounts for
this.

1. The meaning of davnen in Yiddish, from its appearance in the works of
Rivke Tiktiner in the late 16th century to the present is 'to recite the
prescribed prayers' -- whether silently or at the top of one's voice. 

2. Unless A. Manaster Ramer has some earlier known attestation than those
in the works of Rivke Tiktiner, who writes "dvnin" [v = veyz], there is no
reason to believe that the verb was originally "daven".

3. One of the things that Genesis teaches us is that even divine knowledge
is no guarantee that you get etymologies right; if omniscience is no
guarantee, how much less is knowledge of linguistics...

Does anybody know where I might obtain the libretto of Der Yiddisher 
Pinafore?  Thanks very much for your help.
