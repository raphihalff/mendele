We, the people of the book (and our friends), sometimes
ignore the fact that Yiddish has a written history as well
as an oral one.  There is in particular a literature on the
subject of the reform of Yiddish orthography in the Soviet Union.
For example Rachel Erlich writes about it in her article
"Politics and Linguistics in the Standardization of Soviet
Yiddish" (_Soviet Jewish Affairs_ 3 [1973], 1:71-79).  She points
out that after the revolution the Soviet government promised help
in establishing educational and other institutions for all the
peoples of the Soviet state.

She writes:

      The Yiddish linguists, intent on standardization, were elated by
      this, and set out to simplify Yiddish spelling.  They had before
      them as an example the changes in Russian spelling brought about
      with the help of government power.  A plan of simplified Russian
      spelling, filed away in the Tsarist Academy of Sciences, had
      been quickly adopted by the Soviet Government, and brought into
      being by its decree.

      As part of a pedagogical debate on how to teach Yiddish to
      children ignorant of Hebrew, and how to make it easier for
      adults unfamiliar with Hebrew to write YIddish correctly,
      discussions about changing the Hebrew spelling of Yiddish words
      had begun long before the Russian revolution.
      	[...]
      Only in the Soviet Union did the adherents of change win out.
      [...]  The response outside of the Soviet Union was mixed: the
      naturalized spelling of words of Hebrew origin receiving a more
      sympathetic response than the dropping of the final letters.
      Both steps were imitated at one time or another in Yiddish
      writing in Europe and the United States, but these changes were
      never formally adopted in the West.
      	[...]
      In 1932, the organ of the youth organization of the Bund in
      Poland, the _Yugnt-Veker_, naturalized the spelling of the words
      of Hebrew origin, and continued to do so until the outbreak of
      the Second World War.  While the official organ of the Bund, _Di
      Naye Folkstsaytung_, kept the original spelling, not wanting to
      change it.

Erlich also cites some evidence that not all Soviet Yiddish linguists
and activists were in favor of the spelling reforms. A. Vevyorka, for
example, pointed out that it would be easier to sell works of Soviet
Yiddish literature abroad "were it not for the difficulties imposed
upon the reader by the new orthography" (quotation from Vevyorka).
Erlich adds in a note that "a spelling system ... made easier for
those who are in the process of learning to read and to spell ... [may
present] in the beginning some difficulty to older people who are set
in their ways and do not like innovations.

The spelling reform is also discussed briefly in Rakhmiel Peltz and
Mark W. Kiel, "Di Yiddish-Imperye:  The Dashed Hope for a Yiddish
Cultural Empire in the Soviet Union," _Sociolinguistic Perspectives on
Soviet National Languages:  Their Past, Present and Future_, ed.
Isabelle T. Kreindler (Berlin etc.:  Mouton de Gruyter, 1985), pp.
277-309; see especially p. 284 and the bibliography in note 22.  The
authors write that "it was the teachers in the Yiddish schools opened
for children of displaced families in Russia during World War I who
initiated the naturalization of the spelling of the Hebrew component
of Yiddish.  They argued that orthography based on phonetics would
make it easier to teach children who did not know Hebrew how to read
and write Yiddish correctly.

I don't believe that anyone has pointed out the following
orthographical/bibliographical curiosity:  The editors of the journal
Sovetish heymland (1961-1989) reinstituted final letters in Yiddish,
while retaining the phonetic renderings of loshn-koydesh elements
within the language.  Yiddish books published by Sovetskii Pisatel'
(the Moscow-based publishing house to which, I believe, Sovetish
heymland had some connection) followed the same practice, once the
journal started to appear.  Meanwhile, far, far away, the newspaper
Birobidzhaner shtern retained the earlier practice of omitting final
letters.  I wonder how many other languages in the Soviet Union
possessed, in effect, two variant, "official" orthographies.

I would like to add to Andrey Bredstein's sound account [6.241] just
two points:

1. I believe (although I don't have references at the moment) that
language reform was widely discussed in various Yiddish circles before
the Russian revolution and not only in Russia.

2. Technically all letters were always present in the Soviet
alef-beys. In 1920s and 30s ende oysiyes were usually accompanied by a
footnote like this: "Final forms are excluded from Soviet Yiddish
graphics, but de facto are used" (I.Zaretzki, 1930). Later these
footnotes disappeared. Four other letters (khes, sin, tof, sof) were
excluded more thoroughly. But again, they were always listed,
accompanied by a comment: "These letters are used in Hebrew quotations
and proper names only". To make up for the lost, two affricatives
(zain shin, tes shin) were introduced as plenipotentiary letters. This
innovation was adopted by many Western authors.

The situation itself gives the hints to the answer on who initiated
and introduced the reform. If the letters were purged by the
Party/Government we would not find even traces of them.
