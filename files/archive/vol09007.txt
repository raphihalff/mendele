Subject: Feet and legs

To Yankev Lewis [08.152]: to the best of my knowledge (which might perhaps
lack polish, because I learned Yiddish as my mame-loshn 70+ years ago in a
shtetl and have been speaking it ever since, but never had proper schooling
in it), "foot" and "leg" are simply not distinguished in Yiddish. Moreover,
this semantic feature is replicated in the upper extremity, where "hand" and
"arm" are not distinguished either. There is thus one word for the entire
extremity: "fus" & "hant". The loss of this distinction common to Germanic
and other European languages (compare French "main" & "bras", "pied" &
"jambe") is explained by its absence in every Slavic language, the common
feature of which are single designations for each extremity (Russian "noga" 
& "ruka"). This is a vivid illustration of how Slavic influence affects the
semantic properties of Yiddish words even if they retain their original
German shapes and forms.

Subject: Feet and legs

Yankev Lewis asks about the same word "fis" for both leg and foot [08.152]. 
I think we have to live with it...there is no differentiation, that I know,
between "finger" and "toe" in yiddish.

Subject: lernen

The use of "lernen" and "lernen zikh" is more complicated than indicated
so far on Mendele [08.152].
        
North Eastern (i.e. Litvish) Yiddish distinguishes between "lernen" -- teach
-- and "lernen zikh" -- learn--a distinction enshrined in standard Yiddish,
especially by U. Weinreich in College Yiddish. 
        
however, other areas of Yiddishland use "lernen" indiscrimiantely for both
"teach" and "learn" so that the distinction has to be clarified in other
ways.  "He teaches Russian" would have to be rendered as "Er iz a
rusish-lerer"--"er lernt rusish" would be ambiguous in those areas.... 
"He's learning Russian"=="Er iz a talmid fun rusish" etc. 
        
"He's majoring in Russian" -- "er shtudirt rusish (in universitet)  or "Er
iz a student fun rusish" and so on....

Subject: Leyg dayn kop

Many thanks for al who gives me the words of 'Leyg dayn kop oyf mayne kni.'
 
I shall use the text in my book 'There and back'.  First it was a
radio-drama produced in Brussels, Den Hague, Tokyo, London, Frankfurt and
Berlin, now it shall be a book telling the story of a boy of eleven going
with his father to a catholic school to survive the war.  During the trip
the father telled him a old yiddisch story 'The water-palace'.  The evening
before they say good-bye, the father sings The old lullaby.  Forty-five
years after the war, the 'boy', now a man of 55, brings his old father back
to the house they have leaved during the war. 

The book shall be published in october this year bij Lannoo Tielt Belgium.

Subject: Arbes, lekakh.

I was surprised to learn that arbes stands for chick peas (vol.09.003). As
far as I know arbes is simply peas (cf. Weinreich and Rusish-yidisher
verterbukh, Moscow, 1984, under "gorokh"). It may have changed its meaning
in the US, but I must say that chick peas are scarcely available in Eastern
Europe. In those areas where they are available, the word is "nait" ("nahit"
in Bucovina, cf. Mordkhe Schaechter "Yidish tsvey", NY, 1995, p.83), and the
dish described is called tsimes-nait.  (The literary Russian word is "nut",
or "baraniy gorokh", but in the areas where it grows it is called "nagut",
and the Russian Dictionary of Foreign Words, Moscow, 1979, claims Tatar
etymology; Moldavian word is "naut", Ukrainian - "nahut".) 

Lekakh is prepared differently in various regions (I guess Dr.Herzog can say
more about this), but honey is not a necessary ingredient. In fact, in
Bessarabia and Podolia the name is "onik-leykekh" when the honey is to be
used ( and (h)onik-likakh in the rest of Ukraine) - see
 the aforementioned Rusish-yidisher verterbukh, p.244 under "medovij 
prianik".

Subject: lekakh, arbes

Many contributors have suggested that lekakh must be honey cake.  That would
be honig lekakh. stam a lekakh is a sweet spongy cake. zayer geshmak mit a
gleyzl tey. 

About arbes: We call them nahit.

The holiday at which they are most likely to be eaten is Purim.

They are also customarily served at a 'zokher', the gathering which takes
place on Friday night in the house of a newborn male child. (Actually my
nephew will be making just such a celebration this week.)
