Subject: Re: Yiddish Geography

In a nutshell, _Raysn_ means Ukraine-Byelorussia-the Carpathians. Raysn
nowadays generally means White Russia (Belarus), but evidently was
equivalent in those days to 'Ruthenia' or 'Rus', meaning the Eastern
territories of Poland-Lithuania, where the majority of the population were
Eastern Orthodox (and later Slavonic rite Catholic) slavs who spoke what in
Polish is still called "ruski" (Byelorussian or Ukrainian) and used Old
Church Slavonic as their official and liturgical language (also "ruski";
compare "rosijski", [Great] Russian).

Subject: Re: Yiddish geography

In Mendele 14.016,3 an enquiry was posted as to the meaning of the Yiddish
geographical term "Raysn". The simple answer, as recorded in all the
dictionaries (Niborski, Weinreich, Harkavy etc.), is that the meaning is
"White Russia/ Belorossiya/ Belarus". However, more may be said.

The fact is that the toponyms Russia, Raysn and Ruthenia are all cognate and
originate, somewhat curiously, in the Norse word for oarsmen that was
imposed on this vast territory by the Vikings who crossed the Baltic and
fearlessly navigated the river basins of Russia and the Black Sea as far as
Byzantium. But since then there has been much semasiological usage, and in
its Yiddish form "Raysn", it's meaning was restricted to those parts of
Russia accessible to Jewish migration since they lay in the the Grand Duchy
of Lithuania and not in the Muscovite lands from which Jews were excluded,
i.e. White Russia (meaning Western Russia, according the the scheme of
chromatic designations of points of the compass which the Slavs had borrowed
from the Mongols. n.b. this has nothing whatever to do with the political
terms "White Russian" and "Red Russian" that came to designate the opposing
sides in the Civil War).

The name "Ruthenia" meanwhile is derived from the mediaeval Latin word for
Russia and was applied by the the Austrians to that part of the Western
Ukraine that fell within the confines of the Habsburg Empire. The Austrians
found it expedient to eschew the term "Ukrainian" in describing Ukrainian
speakers within their borders, so as to discourage irredentism. And, of
course, their Ukrainians differed culturally from those under Tsarist
control in that they owed allegiance to the Uniate Church in communion with
Rome, rather than to the Orthodox Church whose writ ran further east.

Interestingly enough, it is in old Ruthenia, now a part of newly independent
Ukraine, that the Ukrainian language is still a vibrant cultural force,
since it has "enjoyed" several centuries less Russian assimilatory pressure
emanating from St Petersburg. "Raysn", it follows, forms the southern
portion of that other important Yiddish geographical entity, "Lite", which
corresponds to what in Polish used to be called "Litwa", or the ancient
Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was incorporated into the huge united
Commonwealth consisting of "Litwa" and "Korona" (or the Kingdom of Poland).

It is important to distinguish clearly between Raysn (where the goyim speak
White Russian) and Lithuania proper (where the goyim speak Lithuanian), that
is to say the territory of today's (and the inter-war) Lithuanian Republic
or "litvishe republik" as we must call it, if we intend to refer to
Lithuania in its modern, more restricted sense.

Subject: Ladeshke

Ken Frieden (14.106) asked about "ladeshke" in the phrase _vi a moyz vos men
nemt aroys fun a ladeshke zoyermilkh_.  Harkavy lists _ladish_ from
Belarusian _hladysh_ (stress on the last syllable), meaning a pitcher
without a handle.  The Belarusian word may be from Polish _gladysz_ (with
slashed "l"), meaning a clay pitcher without a handle, especially for milk.

Subject: Re: Construction with 'ton'

Dovid Katz in "The Grammar of the Yiddish Language" equates "ton a" with
"geven a". Quote "It too designates a single event, rather than an ongoing
affair". There is no mention of its origin.

60 years ago when I was a young man, "Ton nisht topn" was used to describe a
girl who would not allow a boy to explore her physique.

Certainly not every use of grob is pejorative; it simply means big, thick,
fat, etc. The word is pejorative when used to describe a person.

Subject: Re: prost un grob

I've just started learning Yiddish which was the language I heard from
grandparents in my childhood, so I don't yet know in which context the words
"prost" and "grob" are used in Yiddish, but since both words seem to have
Slavic roots, I hope my knowledge of Russian and Ukranian may help:

1. "prost" probably derives from "prostoy" (adj)/ "prosto" (adv) meaning
"simple", "common", "usual".  E.g., some Russian phrases as translated into English: "a simple
question",  "just so" ("prosto tak")

2. "grob" sounds like "grubo" (adv) / "grubyi" (adj) / "grubiyan" (n)
with a vowel change which is quite common both in Slavic languages and
Hebrew ("vav" pronounced either as O or U.

The word means "primitive", "rude", "vulgar".  This adjective's collocation
with "word" means "a rude word, curse", with "flour" not refined,
whole-wheat; with "cloth" or "noodles" mentioned in one of the letters
home-made (i.e. primitive) as opposed to thin, factory-made, refined.

When related to people, a clearly derogatory "grubyi" means "rude, vulgar,
harsh, cursing", whereas "prostoy" is a stylistically neutral word
describing a person's origin or status: "a simple man, commoner" as opposed
to "aristocratic, cultured, refined".

Subject: "a kind firt dem veg"

I am trying to remember who wrote this short story. I read it about 10 years
ago. It was about a girls' boarding school whose campus is to be overtaken
for the purpose of quartering German troops. The students there perform
kidush hashem. I was thinking it was by Peretz, but I also (perhaps
mistakenly ) recall the intruders as Nazis, which makes the time period
incompatible. The most likely alternative is Sholem Asch, but I have not
seen the story in any of his collections since then (not that I've seen
many). I don't know if it has been translated, but if so, its title would
possibly be "A Child Leads the Way".

Can someone confirm?
