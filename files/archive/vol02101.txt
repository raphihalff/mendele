Subject: Kamenitzer Magid

For Henry Breitrose:

I am most interested in this project as my wife is a
great-granddaughter of the Kamenitzer Magid. Bli neydr, I
shall dig out some references for you.

Meanwhile please tell me the exact yiches of Nathan Maccoby
(my son has researched the family tree, but the said person
does not figure on it yet).

Subject: RE: Goy

Goy meaning gentile is recited everyday in morning
prayers-- baruch hashem shelo asani goy. True in biblical
Hebrew is means an entire nation (etymologically related to
the word for body) and can even refre to Israel. That usage
disappears quickly as goy, nochri, akum becomes standard
for an idolator, a gentile, in short for a goy. we also
have goya, not the artist, but the cleaning woman who used
to clean my bubbe's house and the usage in the singular,
male or female probably goes back at least 2000 years. Can
Israelis be goyim. Certainly, thats how they were defined
in the religious right-wing world, "goyim who speak
Hebrew". Yiddish simply took over te Hebrew.

Why God Never Received Tenure at the University
- - -----------------------------------------------
1. Because He had only one major publication.
2. And it was in Hebrew.
3. And it had no references.
4. And it wasn't published in a refereed journal.
5. And some even doubt He wrote it himself.
6. It may be true that He created the world but what has He
   published/done since ?
7. His cooperative efforts have been quite limited.
8. The scientific community has had a very rough time
   trying to repeat His results.

Subject: Genossen!

Does anyone have any information on what people say on
hearing someone sneeze?  I grew up hearing the following
from my mother, who was born in Kovno and grew up in a
Yiddish speaking household in Chicago:  Tsu-gezunt, tsu
leben, tsu vaksen, tsu kvelen, a yingel vestu hobn, un
khasene vet veln.  The commas basically indicate the
sneezes, i.e., a sort of punctuation mark.  After a certain
number of sneezes the punctuation (or actual sneezes)
became almost irrelevant.  I don't recall that there was a
comparable ending for my brother.  At some point my father
would chime in with what seemed to be an alternate ending,
although it didn't rhyme, namely, gey shoyn in der erd, du
host shoyn a kalt. It also sounds very American.  I have
never heard anyone else go further than tsu leben.
Admittedly I was a champion sneezer as a child, but has
anyone out there ever heard anything similar, or know if
anyone has ever written anything on this?

Dowling; "Tevye and His Women" by Sheva Zuckera; and an

third person) David Neal Miller.
