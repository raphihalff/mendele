Subject: _In Poylishe Velder_

Certainly Yoysef Opatoshu's novel, _In Poylishe Velder_ (1921)
satirises the Kotsker rebe and Kotsker hasidim in general. It was
filmed in 1928 by Jonas Turkow and had its premiere in January 1929. I
have never seen the film and it was not included in the recent,
extremely comprehensive Yiddish Film Festival at London's Barbican
Arts Centre, but according to Hoberman's "Bridge of Light"
(undoubtedly the best book on Yiddish film) the cuts that were
cravenly made at the behest of the Agudes Yisroel ruined the film and
accounted for its commercial failure. It would be good to know if
there is an uncut version still in existence anywhere. The person who
would know is Sharon Pucker Rivo, Executive Director of the National
Center for Jewish Film at Brandeis.

Subject: Present tense, singular, third person of "veysn"

My friend Sholem Jafe in 6.233 states that "er veyst"  "klingt im azoy
modne".  He asks if this form is a matter of dialect or a
daytshmersim.  In "201 Yiddish Verbs" by Anna Rockowitz, p.77, the
verb "visn" in the present tense, singular, third person is shown as
"veys" but with a "tes" after it in parentheses.  I take this to mean
that "veyst" is an alternate acceptable form, but not preferred.

Subject: Place names and rebbe's names

Everything so far received on the subject of place names fails to
mention the names that were not just phonologically adapted by
Yiddish-speakers but actually translated and invariably used in their
translated form. Three examples come to mind: Stary Sambor in Poland
which was almost always called Altshtut, Bielaya Tzerkov in the
Ukraine, always called Sde Lovon (when it wasn't called Shvartze
T'uma) and Deutschkreuz in Burgenland, called Tzelem. I knew
Altshtuter Rav z"l, a great tsadik, and once saw the Tzelemer Rebbe.

That said, I greatly enjoyed David Herskovic's amusing observations on
why one place name is preferred over others. As he says, who ever
heard of an Uzhgoroder Yid?  But the Kloizenburger Rebbe is another
story: it's not only places that change their names but Rebbes too.
Kloizenburg is called Kluj and Koloshvar too as far as that goes, but
R. Yekusiel Halbertshtam who when I first met him was called the
Kloizenburger Rebbe, is now called the Tzantzer Rebbe. The late
Pittsburgher Rebbe, z"l, when I first knew him after the war, was
called the Czernowitzer Rebbe. Other examples abound.

Subject: Yiddishisms in American English

Of possible interest to Mendelniks is an article in the New York Times
today (2/23/97), by Richard Shepard, about the extent to which Yiddish
words and expressions have been incorporated into American English.  The
article appears on page 2 of the Week In Review section.  On the Web
version of the Times, the article appears at

Subject: Ende oysiyes

In. 6.238 David Herskovic expressed  his surprise at seeing some works
by  Bergelson in  Yiddish with  all end  letters replaced  by "normal"
ones.  I thought that this  was standard Soviet practice.  During WWII
I used to read their  Eynigkeyt (sp?) published by the antifashistishe
yiddishe farband (or something like it), and there also no end letters
were used.  Another difference from other Yiddish texts I know was the
spelling of  words originating in  Hebrew, as shabbes etc.   They were
all  spelled phonetically  rather  in  the way  they  were written  in
Hebrew.

I took it to be the  Soviet attempt to severe relations between Hebrew
and Yiddish.   Another reason could be  that in the S.U.  by then many
Jews who spoke and read Yiddish were ignorant of Hebrew and thus would
have trouble to know what "shin beis sof" etc. meant.

In answer to David Herskovic's question, "Was there ever a movement to
remove the end letters from Yiddish orthography?" I seem to recall
that Communist Russia imposed two innovations on Yiddish writers: all
Hebrew words had to be written in a phonetic transliteration and
word-final letters were forbidden. If my memory serves (and if it
doesn't, I certainly should be used to it)	that must have been
where the book he found was published.

But here's the weenie: Yiddish, which adopted ten percent of its
mostly Germanic vocabulary from Hebrew, adopted Germanic terms for
word-final letters in Hebrew. There are five of them and they are
called, in every Yiddish-speaking talmud-toire, lange khaf, lange nun,
lange pe, lange tsadik and shloss mem. "Ende tsadik"? Never heard of
it!

In Soviet orthography, lange nun,tsade etc. were all dropped, as were
all hebrew spellings - words were written phonetically. As well, by
(by) was spelled as pronounced in USSR - ba; hence, "baym" becomes
"bam".  It wasn't until the early 90's I believe, when they finally
fell into step with the rest of the world.

The reason  for the differentiation was probably political. Erase as
much of the old, conservative semitic writing system, and the gulf
between the religious traditionalists and the modern secularists
widens.

Subject: Ende oysiyes

David Herskovic asks about a movement to remove the end letters from
Yiddish orthography.  I once read that in the Soviet Union, the
authorities required two modifications of Yiddish orthography.  The
first was that Hebrew words had to be given Yiddish spellings.  This
was because, while, ideologically, Yiddish was recognized as the
language of one of the many ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, Hebrew
was considered the language of religion and of Zionism, buth of which
were anathema to Soviet ideology.

The second was that the end letters could not be used.  Apparently,
this was looked upon as bourgeois elitism because only a selected few
had end forms.

I have no idea whether these orthographic ideosyncracies still exist
in Russian Yiddish today.
