Re: Tsugetschepet

Does this bring back memories! My parents told me: "Tschepe nisht!" every
time my fingers went near my adolescent acne.

I'm officially de-lurking, so I should introduce myself. My parents and I
were born in Canada, and their parents came from Byelorus. Although my
first language was Yiddish, I can no longer speak or write it because of
years of neglect, but I am enjoying decoding the Romanized Yiddish I find
here. I teethed on Yiddish music (my mother sang Yiddish songs
semi-professionally), and I greatly enjoy the current klezmer revival --
it's my soul music. My father did English translations of some Peretz
stories, collected under the title "As Once We Were", which was much
admired by the relatively few people who read the private publication of
them in the early '50's. As a young teenager, I was a member of the
Yiddishe Kinder Theater, a Los Angeles group which performed exclusively
in Yiddish, under the direction of Than Wyenn and, later, Benjamin
Zemach.

Despite my parents' zeal in attempting to preserve the Yiddish language,
however, I lost contact with Yiddish for a number of years, and I am
delighted to see the resurgence of interest in its rich heritage. Ver
vays? Maybe I'll be able to start speaking it again!

My parents do not have Net access, so I am forwarding copies of Mendele
mail to them on computer disk, and I hope I will be posting contributions
from them on their behalf.

Subject: Hunt for Chicago's elusive YIVO

Meyshe-Yankl Sweet:

How about trying the Spertus Museum on Michigan Avenue?  As for the
Chicago YIVO, the current _Forverts_ does have a small article about them
and their activities, but doesn't print any information about how to
reach anyone there.

Subject: On Some German-Jewish Words

Rick  Gildemeister interesting  post about  some phrases  the Jews  in
Germany used  moves me  to ask  a question.   Although I  left Germany
quite early  in my  life, I  was exposed  to the  language used  by my
parents and our  yekkish family and friends in  Israel (Palestine) for
much  longer.  One  word used,  and  which I  do not  think exists  in
Yiddish was "ohser" (I  spell it like that as the  "o" sound was long,
and the  "s" was a  hard one).  This word  was used to  express strong
disbelief in some story told.  Does anyone else know this word?

As I  am with  yekkish usages,  we, who lived  in Berlin  (but perhaps
influenced by my father's  Alsace/Bavarian origin), called the shabbes
khalle something  like barshes.   I was  told that  in other  parts of
Germany  it  was  called  tatshir  (tatsher?),  and  that  both  words
originated from  the biblical  verse  BIRKAT hashem hi TA'ASHIR.  This
verse  was  engraved on  my  parents'  khalle knife,  supporting  this
conjecture.

I wonder how  far east "ohser", "barshes" (or  barkhes) and "tathsher"
have travelled.

Subject: mieshtshanske felder

On Judith Binder's query (nr. 205), the question of Tzipyorek is
certainly disposed of; the others, though, still remain. Let me take on
the last one, which no one has yet touched. The word is almost certainly
from the Polish mieszczanskie, which usually means bourgeois. But here
the context forces some refinement ("di shmole pasn fun di mieshtshanske
felder"). The reference here, I would suspect, is to fields owned by
town-dwellers, i.e, burghers, another older meaning of mieszczanskie.
These fields would certainly be more modest than the typical vast
possessions of the Polish landowning aristocracy,the szlachta magnates.
And therefore the "shmole pasn." All this is only an educated guess, of
course, and needs verification through considerably more context,
ideally, the entire story. But one of the things I want to suggest here
is the importance of historical in addition to language knowledge when
one goes to translate Yiddish (or, of course, any language).

Subject: Maoz Tzur

I know of no Yiddish tranlation, but I do remember the first line of a
German parody that my (Jekke) grandfather used to sing:

Moysche, du die Schuh' auszieh'

Does anyone know the rest?  As I remember, it was wonderful.
