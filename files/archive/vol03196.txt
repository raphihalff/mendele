Subject: Introduction

I have just signed on to Mendele because I am interested in
preserving my knowledge of Yiddish. I was born in the south Bronx to
immigrant parents from Lithuania and Belorussia.  We spoke Yiddish
at home and I have retained most of it through conversation, writing
to relatives in Argentina and Israel and attending the Oxford Summer
Yiddish program. I am a chemistry professor at the University of
Pittsburgh at Johnstown. I am 55 years old, am married with3
children and 1 grandson. Ikh vintsch eikh aleh a gezunt'n neiem
yohr. A sheynem dank.

Subject:  Yiddish Children's Literature (postscript)

After reading my comments on Yiddish children's literature, Dina
Abramowicz told me that in Prof. Shmeruk's view, Sholem Aleichem's
story "Dos meserl" (cited by her as the first Yiddish children's
story) was in fact aimed at adults and not children, and that the
same should be said of S.A.'s other "Mayses far yidishe kinder." She
regards that as a correction to what she wrote back in 1975.

And speaking of Khone Shmeruk, in his review of the YIVO/Clearwater
microfiche edition he commits an act of auto-citation, which may be
of interest to those who are researching the general topic:
"'Iyunim be-darke ha-kelitah shel sifrut yeladim lo yehudit
be-yidish," IN "'Iyunim be-sifrut - devarim she-ne'emru ba-'erev
li-khevod Dov Sadan be- mal'at lo shemonim ve-hamesh shanah" [The
Dov Sadan festschrift] (Jerusalem:  1988).  This article was
translated into English and published in "Art and Its Uses:  The
Visual Image and Modern Jewish Society" (Studies in Contemporary
Jewry; vol. 6), edited by Ezra Mendelsohn (New York:  published for
the Institute [of Contemporary Jewry, The Hebrew University of
Jerusalem] by Oxford University Press, 1990), pp. 186-200, under the
title:  "Yiddish Adaptations of Children's Stories from World
Literature."

I neglected to mention that the English citation for Shmeruk's
Hebrew article, "Yiddish Adaptations of Children's Stories from
World Literature," was brought to my attention by Michael Steinlauf,
to whom I am deeply grateful.  Bardzo dziekuje, Panie Doktorze!

I don't know quite what you mean by "Yiddish jazz" (although I would
love to hear more, both of and about it) but I wrote a magazine
story a year ago about a couple here in Philadelphia who have the
largest private collection of recorded Yiddish music in the country,
Bob and Molly Freedman. What's more, Bob Freedman has cataloged the
collection in database form, so he can look up any recording by
name, artist, subject, date, etc. I know their collection is
stronger in 33 LP's and later stuff than in older '78s (I believe
YIVO has more of that) but you might contact them; they are haimishe
and usually delighted to help. Email me directly and I'll give you
their address.
