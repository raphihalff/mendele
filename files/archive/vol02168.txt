Subject: Bibliographic question

Several days ago I found in our uncataloged book
collection, a book published in Warsaw in 1918 by Farlag A.
Gitlin. The book is a translation into Yiddish of a roman
by a Danish author of the name Aage Madelung. The title of
the book is "In'm groysen tumel' and translated into
Yiddish (or, as it appears on the title page, Yudish) by
Yehudit P. My question is: a) Does any one on the list know
what the title of the original novel was, and b) who is
Yehudit P.

I tried to search the National Union Catalog (NUC) and
found that there are several books by Aage Madelung (I am
not sure if Aage is Male or Female) and that he/she lived
between 1872 and 1949. I checked also the 5 volume catalog
of YIVO and did not get much information about Yehudit P.
In Leksikon fun der nayer Yidisher literatur, vol 4 (1961)
I found that Yehudit was a pseud. of Rahel Bernstein - but
there is no mention that she translated this book into
Yiddish. Berl Kagan in his Leksikon fun Yidish-shraybers,
does not mention her either.

Thanks for your help,

I hope you take some protection with you when you speak
yidish. In some circles if you address a complete stranger
'du' you are likely to be rewarded with a patsh in ponem.
However the abolition of the polite form -has- become more
prevalent, very likely (as others have suggested) by
analogy with English.

Subject: Du and ir

in response to zev bar-lev's request for comments on du/ir
and whether ir is ever used in the singular, i offer the
following true anecdote.

my mother, born in nyc in 1905 and a native speaker of
yiddish, used ir in the singular but only with people
significantly older than she who were not relatives. my
father, born in slovakia in 1899, had a much broader use of
ir in the singular. one day they invited for dinner two of
my father's landsmen, a man and woman, both single. the two
knew each other since childhood and were friends but used
ir with each other. my mother was blown away by this and
kept making jokes and cracks until the two started dutsing
each other, out of embarrassment. several months later they
announced their engagement--and told everyone that it was
my mother's doing--by making them reach a new level of
intimacy, she had in fact inspired a shidekh.

Subject: du and ir

My mother's oldest brother lived with us for many years.
Shortly before he died and at a time when my father was
close to 70, I suddenly realized that in all those years my
uncle said 'du' to my father but that my father in return
said 'ir'.  I cooked up all kinds of hypotheses, but in the
end I just asked him.
