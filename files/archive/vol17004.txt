Subject: petsha

My mother was of Polish origin and my father came from Zhitomir in the
Ukraine. My mother made petsha or fusnoge. The terms were interchangeable.
My father preferred "petsha." It was made from calves' feet and not cows'
feet. It was known as "calves' feet jelly." It also contained garlic and
sliced hard boiled eggs. It always seemed to be a hit or miss affair.
Sometimes it was almost like rubber and at others it was very loose. My
mother wasn't a particularly good cook. A sister-in-law of my father also
used to make it rather more consistently. I nearly always liked it. The
period was about 1928 up to 1938 in the UK.

Subject: petsha

For what it's worth:

I recall a suggestion that "petsha" may be a corruption of the French 
"pied
chaud" (heated foot), just as "cholent" is derived from "chaud lent"
(slowly heated).  I am aware that petsha is eaten cold (by those who can
stomach it), but it has to be heated before it cools, n'est-ce pas?

Amitai Halevi

Subject: petsha, kasharn

Re:  "petsha." I always heard it as "p'tsha" (one syllable and, I think
closer to the Russian)

Re:  Ms. Gross' "kasharn," I would guess it is "Kaserne" (German; French:
"Caserne"), which means "barracks," which could fit her meaning.

Subject: kasharn

"kasharn" refers to the place where the Jews were taken for execution.
"Koszary" are military barracks in Polish.  Makes sense, unfortunately.

Subject: idioms in yizker-bukh

I am uncertain as to the distinction that Bob Rothstein is seeking, but I
will attempt to reply (see interstital replies below)

       1. Ver iz der yold?

A 'yold' is a lout, or rude, unmannered individual. This comment could be
applied to anyone who was acting in a manner deemed unruly by the speaker.

       2. Dos iz a mamzerl.

Quite likely used as a term of endearment (reversal of literal meaning), 
in
the case of a precocious child.

       3. Zay gezunt, Motye.

       4. Shapse, vi [perhaps: vu] loyfstu?

       5. Gut shabes, koze. ("Gut shabes" can be used to mean something 
like
       "Wake up and smell the coffee" or the current slang "Hello!" Is this
       just a stronger version?)

       6. A kishke a gedule.

Can't help here

       7. Kleyn, groys - eyn prayz.

A way of saying "no difference".

       8. Oy! a tson!

       9. Khotsh nem im un shnayd im op fun shtrikl.

Literal meaning is clear, but I am unfamiliar with the idiomatic use.

      10. Gekrogn a krasne bilet - iz gevezn porkhe-nishmose. (The second
      half - according to Niborski/Neuberg - means "nearly died of fright";
      what about the first part?)

It looks like the first part is a "red ticket." The real question is what
does that refer to? I don't know.  One could imagine this being a draft
notice, for example, to report for military service, but that is just a
guess to use as an illustration.

      11. Oy a loksh - a loksh.

There is the expression langer loksh for someone who is unusually tall.
Perhaps this is just an abbreviated form of that expression. Is there
anything idiomatic or proverbial about "Zi iz khorev krank; zi derkent
shoyn nisht keyn mentsh" [nisht far keynem fun di mendelyaner gezogt!]

Bob should say gedakht instead of gezogt. I'm not sure what Bob is looking
for here. The notion of "khorev krank" is new to me, but the meaning is
pretty clear.

Subject: idioms in yizker-bukh

Shapse is either another form for the name Shabesai (as in Shabtai Tsvi,
who claimed to be the messiah in the 17th century) or another form of
shepsl - little sheep; vi loyfstu means what's the hurry? where are you
running to?

5. koze is a nanny goat; I think it also has a pejorative meaning when
applied to a woman.

6. I'd like to know the context of a kishke - a gedule, but kishke can 
mean
anything from a length of intestine to a fire hose. A person with a
prodigious appetite can be called a kishke on a dno - a bottomless
intestine (Sholem Aleichem uses it). A gedule is a big deal.

7. One price for either big or small.

8. O a tooth! Most cultures herald the eruption of a baby tooth as a sign
that the child is hitting its landmarks appropriately, and is developing
normally - a good omen.

9. However, grab him and cut him off from the string (context?).

10. (When he) got a red ticket - he almost swooned. I don't know what a
red ticket is, but as is the case with most tickets received, it's
probably not good. Porkho nishmosoi means his soul ascended (into heaven)

11. loksh in my father's Yddish meant a tall, gangly person, as opposed to
a pempik, who looked like a fire hydrant - short, stout and fat. It's from
the word for noodle. Later, in Toronto Yiddish, it was sometimes applied 
to
Italians.

Subject: Ibi Kaufman

I went to George Washington Junior Senior High School in Northeast
Philadelphia with Ibi.  I believe she graduated in 1971.  She and Iwere
friends and I was pleasantly surprised to see her in this video some years
ago.  I was told that she is still in NYC area, but I don't know what she
is doing now.  I don't imagine she is still in undzer yidishe velt or I
would have heard about her.  Zalmen may have contact information for her.
