Gabriella Safran <gsafran@leland.Stanford.EDU> asked in Mendele 08.150 about
the above.  The former is honey cake; the latter are chick peas 
(= Sp. garbanzos = It. ceci), which are eaten as a snack. 

Hope this helps.  Zayt gezunt un shtark.

In response to Gabriella Safran's query re yiddish for 'arbas' and lekakh: 
arbas are chick peas and 'lekakh' is honey cake. At least that is in my
vocabulary.

Subject: lekakh, arbes

In response to Gabriella Safran's questions about Lekakh and Arbes:

In my experience, the word Lekach was always preceded by the word Honey,
because of its defining ingredient.  It is a moist cake that also has as an
ingredient either "hard" tea or strong coffee.  It was served year round on
special occasions, but had a special place on the menu at Rosh HaShana where
it symbolized the prayed for sweetness of the coming year.

Arbes, on the other hand, was peppery chick peas (only white pepper was used
in my house). It was a favorite snack that we made from scratch mainly for
eating on Sunday evenings.  Our version was pretty dry and was served cold,
almost like nuts, but I have known them to be served with onions (raw or
fried), and other such things.

Gabriella Safran asks about "Lekakh" which is a brown cake with almonds..I
remember that as "Honey cake" usually a must at Roshashona. She also asks
about "arbes" this, as I recall was sometime called "niyid"  as I remember
them they are "garbonzo beans" or "chick peas". They are bought dried then
soaked in water and boiled, drained, salted and eaten hot or cold like
popcorn. They were also eaten at a holiday but I wouldn't swear at which
one.

Re: lekach and arbis-Lekach is cake as described. I know it as honey cake.
Arbis are chick-peas. The Spice and Spirit cookbook describe an arbis recipe
as being traditionally served at a Sholom Zochor.  The Joan Nathan "Jewish
Holiday Kitchen" quotes from Schmaryahu Levin "Childhood in Exile"  that
chickpeas are served on Purim to commemorate the piety of Queen Esther who
ate plain peas and beans while in the King's palace .

Subject: Arbes

In response to Gabriella Safran's question about the food "arbes"...
They would be translated as chickpeas or garbanzo beans.

What I would like to know is, we call them "arbesin".  What is the
difference between "arbes" and "arbesin"?  I ask because my knowledge of
Yiddish grammar is nonexistent.

To Gilles Rozier:

Shimen Dzigan iz geshtorben in 1981. And I'm told that he died during a skid
called "THE LETZTE LACH". I'm also told that he died from a heart attack,
and since he always made himself sick, the people thought that he was
faking, so they laughed and didn't do anything to help him. But it WAS the
"letzte lach".

Subject: Pushke

Here is a query I sent to Mendele almost six years ago.  No one answered it
at the time.  Today I received a message from a non-Mendelist who has
nevertheless searched the archives and asks for more information.  Any
takers? 

   Date: Tue Aug 17 13:30:36 1993
   Subject: Pushke

   I've always assumed that _pushke_ is derived from the Polish
   _puszka_ and let it go at that.  The other day however I ran across
   a reference in Zangwill to a _pyx_ which resembles exactly the metal
   box with a lock found in most orthodox shuls.  Pyx (<Lat <Gr), say
   the dictionaries, is used for the sacramental bread of the Eucharist
   and it's used for the storing of specimen coins at the Royal Mint.
   
   Question: does _pushke_ or a related word first show up in eastern
   Yiddish or does it have older, non-Slavic, roots and appear in
   western Yiddish as well?
