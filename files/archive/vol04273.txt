Some of you may remember Yitzhak (Istvan) Kertesz, who was an occasional
contributor (but frequent lurker) to this list. I am sorry to report that
Yitzhak died this past Monday morning. Yitzhak was a librarian at the Leo
Baeck Institute in New York. He was a linguist, Talmudist, and author of
a book on Talmudic and Rabbinic humor.

The funeral is Wednesday Jan 11, at 1:15 PM, at Riverside (180 W 76 St) in
New York.

Yehi zichro baruch.

awaiting a liver transplant, Yitzhak developed kidney failure and died
yesterday morning.  Funeral services will be Wednesday January 11 at 1:15

Two friends are gone.  Yitzhak, a learned and witty man, wrote some
wonderful posts for Mendele.  Here is an excerpt.

Subject: Noch schlimmer mazl

to Hersh Volf Basser (2.04 #1)

I did not intend to deny that mazl means luck, fortune. You are right
that in that Talmud, and even all through the Middle Ages mazal meant
constellations, astrology. When we wish a mazaldike sho, or sing "siman
tov umazal tov yehe lanu", these are in the future tense. But how am I
supposed to understand "Mazl tov, I heard that your son got married!" Is
this a prayer to the stars about something that is done already? Or does
it mean, that the marriage should turn out to be successful? In which
case mazl means success, not stars. This is of course still not luck,
unless you are ready to claim that a successful marriage is only a matter
of luck! David Braun is (2.05 #2) absolutely correct, that mazl came to
mean "congratulations". ((Regarding the ironic use of mazl tov when
something breaks: since we scream mazl tov at a wedding when the glass is
broken, one might argue that this reaction to the sound of breaking glass
in other situations may be a Jewish Pavlovian reflex.))

The English words are confusing, too. Fortune magazine is not about
winning in Las Vegas, and the game-show Wheel of Fortune is not about
picking the lucky stocks. I know that I am not clear, but I don't have an
answer yet. All I know, is that this is a very understudied concept
called "chance", which would belong to a network devoted to Jewish
philosophy, called - I guess - Spinozele. ((This must mean "nose
twisting", if we follow the oylem - goylem phallacy that David Roskies
described in his article: Forward 5/22. Are you online, Reb Dovid?))

As for the conventional wisdom which explains the shlemiel spilling soup
on the shlimmazal, I have problems with it. First of all, as far as I can
see, and I am eager to hear if somebody has proof to refute me, this
definition does not appear in ANY European source. Moreover: If
shlimmazal is an event of bad luck that can happen to anybody, why is the
person sitting there called shlimmazal? Is it a person, or an event? And
if it is a person, but can happen to anybody, why does he have a special
name? If you believe that they are two separate categories (I disagree)
then shouldn't the case be the reverse? Shlimmazal spilling on the
shlemiel? "I was just getting ready to have my soup, when, to my
shlimmazl, can happen to anybody, my sleeves got caught in the edge of
the table, and there went the bowl. And that poor loser Shlemiel sitting
there, the soup could have gone to my left, to my right, but no, it
landed straight on his new suit!"

Leybl Tenzer was known to everyone in Montreal where he headed the
Yiddish schools.  Others knew him from his role as master-teacher at
the National Yiddish Book Center's summer schools.  A gentle man, a
wonderful teacher.

Subject: Talk on Yiddish at MIT (Cambridge, MA)

David Braun (PhD student in Linguistics at MIT) will be giving a
half-hour presentation on the endangered status of Yiddish, at MIT on
Thursday, Jan. 12.  The presentation will be part of the IAP (Independent
Activities Period) that MIT holds during intersession, in which less
formal courses and seminars are led by both faculty and students.  This
year a number of professors and students have organized an "IAP Workshop
on Endangered Languages and the Maintenance of Linguistic Diversity" that
will have four meetings on Thursdays from Jan. 12 to Feb. 2.  It is open
to the public.  Here is a description of its character and purpose:

"Linguistic diversity is decreasing at an alarming rate.  Of the world's
6,000 languages, 5,000 are threatened with extinction within the next
century. Researchers actively involved with endangered languages will
discuss the linguistic situation in various parts of the world with a
focus on ongoing language maintenance programs.  No knowledge of
languages or linguistic theory is necessary."

Topics to be covered over the four sessions:

1. What is a language?  When is a language endangered? Why maintain
linguistic diversity?
2. The United States (status of Native American and other languages)
3. Yiddish
4. Central America
5. South America
6. Australia
7. Ireland
8. Ireland
9. The Far North (e.g. Siberia)
10. The UK
11. What works in language maintenance?

The first three topics will be discussed on Thursday, Jan. 12.  The
session begins at 1:00 pm and lasts until 4:00 pm, in Room 66-154 of MIT.
Call David Braun for more details (375-9533) or e-mail him at dovid@mit.edu.
