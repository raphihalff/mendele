yes, fact would be stranger than fiction, if in fact wexler
were reporting facts. or even reasonable inferences. HE IS
NOT. his 'evidence' is entirely of the most superficial
lexical and morphological type--on the basis of such
evidence, english would come out being 'really' a romance
language (as opposed to the germanic language it is) much
much more decisively than yiddish comes out being
slavic--or hebrew comes out being yiddish. i could rant on
for many screens' worth on how outrageously nil his
'research' in this domain is, but i won't unless someone
wants a private ranting. let me just say here that he is
TOTALLY IGNORING the domain of SYNTAX, which shows very
clearly that hebrew is semitic, infinitely closer to arabic
than to yiddish, and that yiddish is germanic, infinitely
closer to new high german than to 'sorbian' or any other
slavic language. he claims that yiddish is 'relexified
sorbian' and hebrew is 'relexified yiddish'--however, he is
just throwing the term around and is misusing it
egregiously. creole languages are said to 'relexify' when
they KEEP THEIR SYNTAX but trade in certain lexical items
for those of a new language (e.g. when a new colonial power
takes over). therefore, the *syntax* is the crucial
indicator of what kind of language one is *really* dealing
with, genetically. yiddish syntax is clearly and
unambiguously germanic (and non-slavic), and hebrew syntax
is clearly and unambiguously semitic (and non-yiddish).
wexler NEVER addresses the issue of syntax at all and CITES
NO SYNTACTICIAN in his opus--not a one--in spite of the
fact that germanic syntax has generated an enormous amount
of research in the past 15 years. so he has IN NO WAY given
us the slightest reason to think that a relexification
story is even worth checking out, much less the right
story.

if these issues were politically neutral, i'd just write
his stuff off as non-research, up there with a pakistani
book i saw a few years ago claiming arabic is the 'original
language' and other drivel. however, it is not politically
neutral and as such is the most irresponsible thing i have
seen in linguistics in the 26 years i've been in the field.
and yes, you can quote me. i've already said this to him
publicly and am still awaiting a reply.

finally, i'm not worried that he'll 'undermine' the field
in any way--the field has responded to his farkakte claims
with the embarrassed silence they deserve. what i fear is
that the *popular* press, here and in israel kholile, will
take it up and give it publicity. and this we really don't
need.

Dave: to add to your list of pairs: yontev/khoge,
besoylem/tsvinter; there are more. This is a Jewish-Gentile
distinction, not to be confused with other pairs like
shtarbn/peygern, esn/axlen, etc. which function as plain
vs. pejorative. There's yet another category of plain vs
cryptic: redn/dabern and still another of plain vs.
euphemistic: pishn/mashtn zayn.

Ellen: A propos of restaurants, Chinese, Baleboste, etc.,
there's a store on Bvd St Michel in Paris called
(approximate spelling) Toyu Voyu. Not a very Jewish
neighborhood. saydInteres: I'll use it in a sentence. Az se
reygnt indero:sn, gayt menisht ara:n dorkh di front; me
gayt ara:n dorkhn saydInteres. flEtelet: "flat to let"
solefIte: "self-heater" a device that no home should be
without.

David Braun: Add these to your list "Daber nisht, der orl
iz meyvn kol diber" From Moravia "Shtike, di zeygestn
shmeyet" "zeyg" is a Western Yiddish term for "orl/goy".
Etymology?

Subject: bagels and bialys

Ellen Prince doesn't KNOW (:-)) how bad things are west of
the Hudson.  In Southern Illinois they think they know what
bagels are - no one could ever develop strong teeth on these.
They are basically soft rolls, not very good, with a hole in
the middle.  As for bialys and hamantashen, no one has ever
heard of them!  Sigh!

Re: Jeff Finger's Yiddish Anthology question....

I don't have the answer you are looking for, BUT...I assume
you are referring to a recorded anthology and not books (I
was trying to imagine how you might enjoy Paul Robeson
singing from a book and reached this astounding
conclusion).

I just received the Arbeiter Ring's most recent Jewish
music catalogue and am astounded at the collection of
recordings they've assembled.  There are in fact several
anthologies listed with similar vocalist mixes to the one
you describe. One they have is called The Golden Years of
Yiddish Music, Vol 1 (I believe the other 3 may not be in
print) which features a lot of the classic Yiddish singers
on a single tape.

Now if it were books you were talking about, Hebrew U. did
publish a fairly useful 4 volume "Anthology of Yiddish
Folksong" a few years back. The Workmen Circle catalogue is
definitely worth getting though.

        I don't understand many of the distinctions above
        (i.e., exactly what the difference is between
        shtarbn and peygern, for, for that matter, niftr
        zayn).

As far as I can tell, the difference between'shtarbn' and
'peygern' is what in French you would call 'mourir' and
'crever' (dunno the exact word for this in English); as for
'nifter zayn', it's 'to pass away' -- or some other lenient
and roundabout way to say 'to die'.

        Can someone start a list (based on the above), with
        English translations and explanations as necessary,
        that we might collectively expand on?  This is a
        fascinating topic.

Well, above is a (tiny) start; just ask for precise
distinctions -- although some in the citation are unknown
to me (eg 'tsinter', 'byela-tserkov' -- must be Polish, or
even 'shvarts-tum' that I easily understand but never heard
of).

        I can think of a couple of others: shmadn/mgayer
        zayn (convert from/to Judaism);

You got it wrong Dave: 'shmadn' is not 'convert from' but
'apostasize' (mebbe it's only a nuance, but it makes a hell
of a difference for a Yid, as distinct from a mere Jew --
distinction between the last two should be obvious!).

        and bukh/sefer (the latter referring to a religious
        book; are the terms mutually exclusive, or is sefer
        a subset of bukh?).

I would say they *are* exclusive. Never would my Mum call
'A la recherche du temps perdu' a 'sefer'.

More generally I totally agree with Yude-Leyb that most
often the difference is between ordinary and pejorative
use, although for me 'khazer' is definitely non-neutral.
However I would call all this stuff 'socio-linguistics'
(some of my former colleagues at Univ. Paris V studied
'l'argot des etudiants' and here they study 'l'alsacien'),
the interest being very dubious to me -- unless you tie it
up with the whole environment of the Yiddish-speaking
folks;.
