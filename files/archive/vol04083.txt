Subject: Introduction and a request

My name is Mitchell Brown and I have been lurking for quite a few months
now.  I am 39 years old and currently live in Hyde Park, Chicago.  I grew
up in Brooklyn, New York.  I heard some Yiddish spoken, but not often.

My grandmother was fluent in Yiddish.  However, she did not learn it
until she went to work in a factory in the early twenties.  When ever she
would relate the story of how she learned it, she would always end by
saying "Those girls were always suprised that I learned to speak such a
'deep Jewish'".

Has anyone else ever heard of a fluency in Yiddish being referred to as
'deep'?

She never referred to the language as Yiddish, only as Jewish.

I was a German Language and Literature major and did my Senior Year
abroad in Bavaria.  When I returned to the US, I was amazed to see that
along with German, I had also acheived some degree of fluency in Yiddish.
I had some Russian and Hebrew, which obviously helped.  I tried to read
the Forward every week.  I also started collecting Klezmer  music.

I studied Beginning Yiddish at the Workman's Circle in New York with a
lovely man named Pesach. Is he still there?

Since coming to Chicago, it has been more difficult to keep up my Yiddish
studies. It is less 'in the air' than it was in New York.  I have been
able to pick up a Forward occasionally, and rent Yiddish films from that
wonderful resource, Facets Multimedia.

Any suggestions for pursuing Yiddish in the Windy City? Are there any
Yiddish radio broadcasts in the area?

Here is a request:  I just finished John Gross' fascinating book SHYLOCK,
a book that starts out being a historical survey of interpretation and
criticism of the character, and winds up being a study of anti-Jewish
sentiment throughout the centuries.

One of the most interesting pieces of information for me, was the great
tradition of performing Shakespeare in the Yiddish theater of New York.
Can anyone tell me where I can find these Yiddish versions of the plays?
Besides MERCHANT OF VENICE, HAMLET and KING LEAR seemed to be the most
popular.

Subject: Guidelines

Some of the requests for help that appear in Mendele seem -- to my
oversensitized ears -- to border on, or even enter into the area of
unforgivable hutzpa.

I work in science and have seen articles authored by A. (alone) who in a
endnote thanks B. for doing the experiment and C. for writing the paper.

If some of the requests for aid were answered, I imagine a similar scene,
the requester authoring an article/thesis/book based on the information
all supplied by other readers of Mendele.

Why should we contribute under those circumstances?  Does the requester
deserve sole authorship because s/he initiated the request?  I think some
guidelines are in order here.

Am I more paranoid than absolutely necessary?  Nobody, by the way, ever
answers my queries on Mendele (except to correct my egregious mistakes).
Perhaps this posting is generated by envy on my part.  Why is everyone
keeping their Venetian dictionaries to themselves?

Subject: Yiddish courses; Yiddish wordprocessors

I believe that it has now been more than 7 months since I posted anything
on Mendele after writing so many long "essays" here.  That year of making
time to contribute to Mendele is long gone.  I have been extraordinarily
busy working for Yiddish in the last 7 months as the Executive Secretary
(now officially Executive Director) of the Congress of Jewish Culture (=
Der Alveltlekher Yidisher Kultur Kongres) in New York.  I have been
extraordinarily busy with computerizing an office, preparing for a
three-day North American Yiddish conference to be held mertseshem in
June, 1995 (more later); a new lecture series; new leyen-krayzn; and
preparing a bi-lingual quarterly bulletin about the latest news about
Yiddish language, literature, and culture to be published in print and on
our own online forum (For those who may not know, until 8 years ago, the
Kultur-Kongres regularly published a prolific quarterly about this domain
in Yiddish only.)   Between a sick mother, no cleaning lady, and 3 major
computer crashes, there has been no time for e-mail shoyn opgeret fun
snail-mail.   But it certainly has been wonderful to find so many new
members here as well old Yiddishist friends in the last 7 months.

I have needed to post for a long time, but just couldn't find the time.
Now the rush is on to get the bulletin finished.  So, I will be posting a
slew of items during this week, and hope to get many responses. Besides
the general request in the my newsletter posting, I am seeking detailed
information about the following matters:

1)   I would very much like to compose a list of all institutions around
the world that teach Yiddish language, literature and culture, i.e.,
colleges, Hillels, synagogues, Jewish community centers, Workmen's Circle
branches, clubs as well independently formed classes.  Any and all
information would be welcome, but the more detail, the better, e.g.,
address, phone number to call, instructor's name, etc.  (Dates and
schedules are not important.)

2) I would appreciate hearing from anyone with direct experiences writing
Yiddish on a computer.  Which wordprocessing programs worked best for
you? What were the problems with your particular programs?  What fonts
did you use?  Which programs do you recommend and why?

3) Fonts with which to write Standard Yiddish are hard to come by.  But I
believe that there are several in the public domain on internet as well
as several independently composed by individuals.  How does one access
those? Can we upload them onto the Mendele archive for others to download
like regular files?  I am sure that there will be many willing takers for
this, since most programs come with a small selection of Yiddish fonts.

Hoping to hear from lots of you out there.
