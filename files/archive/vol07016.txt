Subject: Serebriani misleads a bit

Serebriani's bamerkungen mikoyekh Sholem-Aleykem's Menakhem-Mendl serie
zaynen take zeyer interesant ober me muz untershtrikhn epes farfirerish, epes

Menakhem-Mendl shraybt fun Yehupets azoy tsu Sheyne-Sheyndlen, zayn vayb, in
Kasrilevke:

Vos du fregst zikh nokh af "Erets-Yisroel", kerst du avade meynen "tsinizm?"
[gemeynt tsionizm]  Dos iz zeyer a hoykher inyen, khotsh in Yehupets af der

(Ale Verk fun Sholem-Aleykhem, Folksfond Oysgabe, T. X, Menakhem-Mendl, z.
132.)

Farshteyt zikh az Menakhem-Mendl hot gevolt shraybn tsionizm un tsionistn,

Ober Serebriani shraybt af zayt 144:

Vi mir zeyen, hot inem ershtn variant Menakhem-Mendl nokh gehat dem interes

Serebriani nemt di verter aroys fun di mayler fun di asimilirte, yidishe

 Dertsu, Serebriani (mit andere) leygt for az mit Menakhem-Mendl,
Sholem-Aleykhem meynt zikh aleyn.

[English translation:]
Serebriani's observations about Sholem Aleichem's Menakhem-Mendl series are
indeed very interesting, but it's important to underscore something
misleading, not quite accurate.  First, I will cite a passage from
"Milyonen."

Menakhem-Mendl writes from Yehupets to his wife Sheyne-Sheyndl in Kasrilevke:

You ask about "The Land of Israel."  You must mean "Zionism." [His
misspelling turns that into "cynicism."]  That's a topic of a high order,
although they don't think much of it on the Yehupets stock market.  A few
times I was among the local Zionists [misspelling turns that into "cynics"]
and I wanted to know what it is, but they spoke only in Russian, and talked
really a lot.  Seems to me strange.  Why should it bother them to talk over
something in Yiddish with another Jew?  I even raised the subject a few times
with my stock-market fellows, but they made fun of me: "Go on with you!
 Zionism [cynicism]!  Doctor Herzl!  You call that a business?"

The unlearned villager, Menakhem-Mendl jumbles the words.  The main point
here: it is not Menakhem-Mendl himself who ridicules Zionism.  He is writing
that the assimilated, Russian-speaking, Jewish stock traders ridicule Zionism
and Doctor Herzl.

However, Serebriani writes:

As we see, in the first version, Menakhem-Mendl was still interested in books
about Zionism, about Doctor Mandelshtam, etc.  In the canonized version,
Menakhem- Mendl held himself aloof from such interests: "You call that a
business?"

Serebriani takes the words out of the mouths of the assimilated Jewish stock
traders and apparently sticks them into the mouth of Menakhem-Mendl.
 Furthermore, Serebriani (as well as others) suggest that by Menakhem-Mendl,
Sholem Aleichem means himself.

Subject: The history of re-evaluation by literary critics

I am immensely grateful to Martha Krow-Lucal who pointed out (in 7.013, 3)
that [in her words]:

<The thrust of the article [Serebriani's] is of course recognizable to any
scholar of nineteenth-century European literature and history of criticism;
there was a long-lived critical tendency to see writers who utilized
colloquial language in their works as walking local-color tape recorders who
dashed off their fiction effortlessly and unthinkingly, af eyn fus.>

I did not know that, but then I'm not a scholar of the history of criticism
of 19th century European literature.  It puts Sholem Aleichem in a broader
context.  Thank you Martha Krow-Lucal.  I suspect Dante was criticized for
using Italian, a street, home and market-place language.

Incidentally, this illustrates wonderfully what Mendele is for: to educate
each other at all levels, wherever we find ourselves, in this most engaging
field.  Whenever I have taught, I have learned.  Whenever I have learned, I
think I might have taught.  Yiddish has a word for both: lernen.  It means
both to teach and to learn.

Now back to Sholem Aleichem.  When he first began to write, he did indeed
dash it off, send it off.  At the time, 1883, Mendele Moykher Sforim, the
great pioneer, was the only true stylist in Yiddish, and at first he thought
of Yiddish as only a temporary device to be used until Jews learned Hebrew.
 Fortunately, Sholem Aleichem appreciated the genius of Mendele, and so
eventually refined his own work in emulation.  Again, fortunately, Sholem
Aleichem found an adoring public almost immediately.  And so he was spoiled
temporarily, became cavalier in his work.  As a matter of fact, he wrote once
in a letter that he would give anything to erase one of his early works from
the collection.  I suspect that anyone who writes experiences that kind of
embarrassment.  Ultimately, by self criticism, he learned to write with such
skill that the art is hidden, as well as the complex structure which, if
altered even slightly, may make the piece fall apart.  I have told some of
his stories in English.  Only if I maintain his structure does the piece
satisfy.  Mysterious.

Subject: Name change

As I understood it from my grandfather, whose father had changed his family 
name, the issue was not one of simply tricking the recruitment officers with 
a new name, but rather of presenting a *passport* that identified the bearer 
as a first-born son.  The name was incidental to that essential piece of 
information.  What mattered was whether one had proof of being first-born.  
Was my grandfather incorrect in his interpretation?

Subject: The Fated Faddist

esreg, esroygim der - ethrog, citron, a fruit over which the blessings are 
said during the Sukkoth holiday. 
Dutch: ceder appel.
Footnote: aza frukht, vos vert bay religieze yidn banutst tsu religieze tsvekn.

I started on Yiddish one year ago, during a stay in Riga. I found a copy of 
S. Sandler's: "Yiddish lernbukh far oyslernen zikh yiddish zelbshtendik", 
bought a Russian dictionary and started "oyslernen". After a few weeks I had 
mastered the alphabet, but not knowing Russian my progress was slow. I ordered 
a copy of Weinreich's dictionary and found myself a teacher. An elderly 
gentleman who knew Russian, German, Hebrew and Yiddish.

I had made the common mistake of underestimating the difficulties of the 
Yiddish language, believing it to be '"some kind of German". Knowing some 
German and being fluent in Dutch I figured I would get the hang of it 
with some practice.

German and Dutch are very useful. I would say that about 75% of the Yiddish 
language was 'understandable' to me from the outset, but the 25% is not to be 
sneezed at.

So, having a teacher and a dictionary I started reading Yiddish literature. 
My teacher brought me a copy of Sholem Aleikhem's "Motl, Peysi dem khazn's".

After one year I am still busy with Motl and I am finding out about the 25 %.
I have bought a Hebrew dictionary and a Polish dictionary to assist me and I 
have just completed a word list of the words of Hebrew origin in "Motl". In 
the two parts of the book I have thus far located over 1200 such words and the 
list is still growing. The "esreg" quoted above is one of them.

The reader will agree, that from the definition found in Weinreich only little 
can be learned, unless you are familiar with the 'ethrog' already and know 
about Sukkoth.

Although it could be said that it is quite impossible to learn Yiddish without 
a good background in Hebrew, the problem is not in the first place linguistic, 
but cultural. A simple story like "Motl" turns out to be a whole encyclopedia 
of "Yidishkeyt".

Without making a study of the whole cycle of Yewish holidays an "esreg" might 
as well be a tomato.

The few people I have met who know Yiddish all agree that translating Yiddish 
is extremely difficult, because a lot of the value of the text is in the 
language itself: the way things are said in Yiddish is so 'novel', so 
'different', that  a translation is bound to fail. Take for instance a work by 
Isaac Bashevis Singer in the Yiddish version and put the authorised English 
translation next to it. The work has been filtered through a cultural screen 
and can hardly be said to be the same, but for the story.

Most translators seem to have notions about how much the non-Jewish public can 
handle. For example, it seems to be generally accepted that the word "yid" is
the equivalent of "mentsh". My friend "Motl" always tells me who in his 
stories is a "yid" and who not. - which seems to indicate that for Sholem 
Aleikhem a "yid" is a "yid" and not just a man or a person. If one allows such 
a "tone down" approach, an "esreg" might, 'keyn eynhore' as well be an 
easter-egg.

Being a goy with a fancy for 'Yidish' I am, of course, a 'faddist'. I only 
recently subscribed to "Mendele" and have been enjoying the quaint mixture 
of contributions. Half forgotten lines of song, attempts to improve the YIVO 
spelling, learned exposis, minor misunderstandings and interesting anecdotes. 
Good fun and gee, it's only the internet.

Since it is clearly Mendele's idea to propagate the Yiddish language I would 
like to plead for some more clemency from those subscribers who have a good  
knowledge of the language and of the Jewish culture. Where would a serious 
faddist be without them?
