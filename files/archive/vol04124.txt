	(800) 621-8227

    They have CD roms of extensive Hebrew literature (Talmud etc.)  besides
    word processors etc.  Now, if they would only issue the stuff with nikud
    in it, even i would get it (expecially a computer Talmud with nikud
    would be great... but at least if the tanakh would have the nikud i
    would be happy)

    Sells the 'Bible Scholar' for mac or ibm for $239, fonts, plus much
    more.  Hebrew Writer-tm 2.5 (made in Israel) has auto-nikud, $189
    for IBM.  (according to the sales representative this program
    will automatically put in the nikud from a database supplied with
    the program.  if it works properly, it sounds like a dream come true :)

    This company produces the multilingual Windows word processor, Dagesh,
    which is distributed by Davka, among other companies.
    It has been on the market for almost two years
    and supports typing in virtually all
    Western languages (e.g. English, French, Spanish, Finnish,
    etc.), as well as Hebrew and Russian.
    There is a complete Hebrew and English Spell checker,
    including options for checking Hebrew according to either
    "regular" or academic usage.  It includes 20+
    fonts in Hebrew (as well as the fonts needed for Russian
    support).  The spell checker does not check nikud, however
    There is also a less expensive version Dagesh Lite.
    Current version is 1.1 and includes a free upgrade to 2.0,
    scheduled to ship later this year. (Note: Lite does not include
    a free upgrade)

    The only full, complete, accurate, and authorized source that I know if is
    sold by Linguist's Software for $99, I believe. What I have is on three
    floppies, in MS Word format, for the MAC and requires a Hebrew font. I have
    used it and my professors here are impressed. I am, too. It says on the
    disk, copyright by Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft 1967/77/83 and 1987 by P.B.
    Payne. They are the ones who produce the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia,
    the standard among Western theological scholarship. I'm sure that they have
    a Windows version as well. Hope this helps.

    A recent phone call to them has revealed that you must also purchase
    a BHS font that has the cantillation marks.  The upshot of this is that
    their software isn't compatible with the Macintosh HebrewScript
    system extensions.  I would strongly urge the company to make their
    software compatible with the "upper ascii" Israeli-Hebrew fonts.

7. ftp.netcom.com  /pub/abdali
   this archive has macintosh system software extensions that will allow
   Hebrew/Arabic word processing while still leaving your machine essentially
   an English based machine.  This pretty much will make your machine bi-
   lingual.  It works with system 7.0.1 but can be buggy at times.  You may
   have to install fonts manually with Font DA mover.  System 7.1 works, and
   appears more stable.  Included is MuEdit 1.3, which is a terrific text
   editor fully compatible with Israeli and Arabic right to left fonts.

   (I have found that with 7.0.1 I must install fonts with FontDA mover
   that can handle true-type fonts... but with system-7.1 i can just drag
   the fonts with all the other extensions onto the closed system folder
   and reboot and everything is fine)

   In any event, I have found that MuEdit 1.3 is completely compatible
   with WorldScript 7.1.  Tex-Edit 2.5 (Ie. Texas-Editor) is another
   shareware text editor that is Worldscript compatible.


A short description of the Global Jewish Networking Server, of other
information resources related to Jewish and Israeli matters and the
access to software which can give you the best interaction with these
systems follows.
