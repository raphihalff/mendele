Subject: Ex-Lax

Bob Werman asked (4.393) about an old Yiddish jingle advertising Ex_Lax.

The only one I remember, from the radio (WEVD) in New York, is:

		nemt a bisl, makht a shisl.

In the same vein, when Winston cigarettes were saying "Winston tastes
good, like a cigarette should," was:

		Vinston is fayn, vi a sigaret darf zayn.

My favorite from this period, however, may be apocryphal, and went
something like this:

	S'kratzt zikh?  Koyft Keshi-Meshi.  Keshi-Meshi iz di beste
    cockroach powder in gantzen velt.  S'iz zeyr poshut tzu benutzn
    dem Keshi-Meshi: nemt dem cockroach in eyn hand; nemt dem
    Keshi-Meshi in anderen hand.  Shit arayn a bisl Keshi-Meshi afn
    cockroach - es vet im gantz gut hargenen.  Un az der Keshi-Meshi
    harget dem cockroach nit, nem dem cockroach, shtelt im in an
    anvelop, un shikt im tzu undz, di Keshi-Meshi kompani, un mir
    veln makhn a soyf fum im.

Subject: On visiting

One of the beautiful parts of networking is the surprise visit.

Yesterday, while speaking to Judy Blair, Dr. Allan Blair's lovely wife, I
mentioned 4 Yiddish contacts in France. They will be visiting there. One
of the names is Michael Rosenbush a native of Toronto and a member of the
Friends of Yiddish.

Twenty minutes later I received a call from Michael saying that he is in
San Francisco on a business trip. We'll be getting together later today.

When you travel, be sure to call/write others interested in Yiddish. You
both will truly enjoy the experience.

Subject: Value of chutzpah

The following article appears in the May-June 1995 issue of Harvard
Magazine. It may be of interest to members of the list.

        The Joys (and Rewards) of Yiddish

In "The  University: an owner's manual" (W.w. norton, 1990), Geyser
University Professor Henry Rosovsky cites a productive meeting with John
Loeb '24 as evidence oft the value of chutzpah* in fundraising.

As dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences during the $ 358 million
Harvard Campaign, Rosovsky was seeking $ 10 million to endow junior
faculty positions. He approached Loeb and in February 1981 had lunch with
him at a New york restaurant, accompanied by Harvard president Derek Bok.
Writes Rosovsky:

As the conversation gently evolved towards specific dollar amounts, our
host inquired: "Are you asking me for five million?" I replied: "Not
quite, sir. My hope is that you will agree to give ten million so that
others will be inspired to give five million". John Loeb frowned, his
face darkened. "Henry," he said, "that comes close to chutzpah", and then
he added rather unexpectedly: "By the way, do you know how to spell that
word?" I indicated my ability to do so by grabbing a napkin and reaching
for my pen. Suddenly the president of Harvard University snatched the
napkin from my hands and printed CHUTZPAH in large block letters on the
paper and gave it to Mr. Loeb.... After carefully folding the napkin into
a small square, Mr. Loeb placed it into one of his vest pockets. The meal
came quickly to an end and we shuttled back to Boston. A few days later
there arrived the most welcome news that the Loeb gift would ba around $
9 million. We had established that the value of chutzpah is approximately
$ 4 million.

* Defined in a Rosovskian footnote as "Yiddish for supreme self-
confidence, nerve, gall".

Subject: Ale yidishe oysyes zaynen vikhtik

The Coalition for the Advancement of Jewish Education in Silver Spring,
MD, issues once or twice a year a newsletter called "Hert Zikh Tsu! Hert
Zikh Tsu! (Hear Ye!  Hear Ye!) with items and announcements about Jewish
education and Yiddish. The factual publishers are Moyshe and Marcia
Gruss-Levinsohn, and the principal contributor and writer is Marcia,
known in _Mendele_ by her E-mail moniker Mashinke.  [In a post in our
Bulletin I inquired if the accent is on the first syllable (MAshinke, the
diminutive and endearing name of Masha) or on the second syllable
(MaSHINke, small machine, possibly a reference to her computer).  Her
answer:  My first guess was right, it is her name.]

The contents of "Hert Zikh Tsu!" are mostly in English with some notices
in Yiddish.

In The January 1995 issue of HZT there was a brief announcement in
Yiddish: "Di kumendike numern fun unzere Naysbleter veln hobn kurtse
oysdrukn mit vikhtike yidishe oysyes" (the next issues of our Newsletter
will have short expressions in _important_ Yiddish letters).

Well, _all_ characters of the Hebrew-Yiddish alefbeys (alphabet) are
important.

There is a mystique about each letter, lending it enhanced power and
value beyond its sound.  Herewith some of the legends:

When God was about to create the world, all letters of the alefbeys
rushed before His throne, each priding himself with some unique
attribute.  God decided to start the creation of the world, as described
in the first book of the Bible, with the letter beys /b/ -- Bereyshis (in
the beginning), because the word _brokhe_ (blessing) starts with a beys.
When alef, the first letter in the alefbeys, complained claiming priority
on the basis of his position in the alphabetical order, God promised him
that He will start the _aseres ha'dibres_ (the Ten Commandments) with an
alef -- Onoy'khi, starting with a komets alef.  (The legend treats pasekh
alef, komets alef, and the silent (shtumer) alef as equal.)

Another legend has it the other way:  Alef did _not_ push himself
forward, like all the other letters demanding a special position of
privilege, and God therefore gave him the position of first letter in the
alefbeys, as well as the position of first letter of the Ten
Commandments.

Every letter of the alefbeys has a numerical value, thus khes-yud (18),
Khay [as in "am yisroel khay," the people of Israel live], lamed-vov (36)
[lamedvovniks], tof-reysh-yud-giml (tar"yag) (613) mitsves
[commandments], and so on.

Kabalists read into the numerical value a single letter, and, especially,
in the sum of a word's component letters many mysteries and divinations.
The kabalists call it "begimatri'e," an Aramaic-Hebrew word, seeking to
foretell, by the numerical sum total of the letters in a word or word
combinations, future events or discover hidden knowledge and meanings.

In sum, all Yiddish-Hebrew letters of the alefbeys are vikhtik
(important), all major, none minor.

Subject: Tikn to'es

A number of sharp-eyed Mendelniks have pointed out that there is no Vol.
4.394 but two issues numbered Vol. 4.395.  The first of these, dated
April 20 (Zellig Bach's story), should be renumbered Vol 4.394.
Appropriate changes have been made to archived files.
