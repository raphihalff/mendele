Subject: G'VALD!

raboysaye: I have long doubted the value of the complimentary, often
flowery,
descriptions that characterize Congressional debates -- "the
distinguished
Senator," "my very good friend," and so on. It has all seemed like a
waste of
space and money in the Congressional Record.  But now I'm not so
sure. The
testy tone that sometimes characterizes Mendele postings adds
nothing to the
value of the messages and tends to detract from the intellectual
pleasure
offered to readers.  Please!

Subject: "Fonye"

Nadia Paladini, Wolf Krakowski and Pamela Parsky have commented
or asked 
aboutthe use of "Fonye" as a designation for Russian soldiers . I
heard 
it was a moderately derrogatory term taken from the Jewish usage of
the 
name common among Russian soldiers, "Ivan" which was given an F
sound. 
Any confirmations?

Subject: Fonye

About three-and-a-half years ago (May, 1994), there was a lively
discussion in
Mendele on whence arises _fonye_ or _fonye-ganef_ as a Yiddish
term for a non-
Jew in Russia.  See 4.005, 4.008, 4.010.  Suggestions were: 1) Ivan to
Vanya
to Fonye; 2) Afon (Athenian) to Fonye; 3) Agafon or Afanasii to Fonye;
4)
mitrofon/mitrofonia to Fonye.

I wonder if this was ever settled.

Subject: Shteeble

Re: Shteeble.  In the song, Afn pripichkl brent a fir'l, in der shteeb s'is
hais... etc, is there a significant difference between shteeb and
shteeble,
other than the one that perhaps connotes size of room? And in either
case,
isn't the shteeb or shteeble merely a room in a family dwelling? In the
song
it is little children who are being taught.  In my recollection of my
grandmother's tales, children so young as be taught the ABCs were
visited by a
person called a rabbi, sometimes, by the adults a Melamed.  But
rabbis are
also teachers.  For waht it's worth,

Subject: Can anyone help with this phrase?

In "khaneka (khanuka??) gelt" by sholom aleikhem there is a scene in
which two
brothers are about to begin a game of checkers (draughts) on a
board
consisting of black & white squares drawn on a piece of paper using
black &
white beans for the checkers. 

Before beginning the game, one says to his brother, benni:  "eyn
zakh vil ikh
dir beten, benni, - b'lo kharote u'blo d'ro'o, - dos heyst: a gang zol
zayn a
gang."

Can anyone help with a translation of the phrase "b'lo kharote u'blo
d'ro'o"? 
we know that 'b'lo kharote' is without regret or without remorse, but
are
stumped by '"blo d'ro'o" (spelled daled - reysh - eyin - hey).  Perhaps
it is
an aramaic form of "ra'a" with a daled prefix?  In any event, is this an
idiom
and what does the phrase as a whole mean? 

Looking for elucidation...

Subject: Farblondzhet af daytsh? Me shmuest vegn yidish.

Zenen mir gevorn azoy fartshadet az mir darfn farblondzhet vern af
daytsh
anshtot afn glaykhn yidishn veg?  Have we become so dulled by
smoke that we
get lost and wander off into discussion of German language as a
benchmark, and
forget that Mendele is about Yiddish?  I dare say, most of us,
fortunately, on
Mendele keep this well in mind.  But not everyone. 

Lance Garmer (7.118, 6) supports the translation of the German word
_widrig_
as repulsive.  Nu, iz vos?  So what?  German may be relevant, but
German is
_not_ the standard of comparison for Nomberg's use of Yiddish in
Tsvishn Berg. 

The relevant discussion, I vividly remember, was about what
Nomberg might have
meant by his use of _viderig_ as a _Yiddish_ word.  No matter how
Germanized,
he was writing Yiddish.  The _German_ word, widrig, may or may not
be
relevant.  It is inappropriate to claim to settle a discussion about
_Yiddish_
usage by pointing to a meaning in _German_ usage (which may not
even be a
universal usage among German speakers)?  Yiddish is not German. 

Consider this example: Yiddish _unterzogn_ means to prompt.  A
German word
that sounds much the same, _untersagen_ means to forbid.  Here,
depending on
German is no help at all in interpreting Yiddish, and will lead you
wildly
astray. 

Bin ikh gerekht, oder neyn, az do shmuesn mir vegn yidish: shprakh
un
literatur?  Sometimes I ask a rhetorical question.  Nu, iz vos?

Subject: 'Jews' and dictionaries

To assuage mendele's esteemed Germanist's bewilderment as to why
'some Jews
hate using reference works' (pronounce it 'dzooz', to rhyme with
booze, and it
becomes even more perplexing; try it, it works), it is all very simple. 

You see 'some Jews' are very weak and frail and they have nebekh no
koyekh.
Now, as we all know very well to use a dictionary that can be lifted
with one
hand is a terrible waste of time and 'some Jews', not having been
raised on
the basic staple of wurshtbraut and bier so common to Germans
(their cousins,
it sometimes seems), simply do not have the strength to raise a
dictionary
with both their hands. 

So 'some Jews' have to occasionally muster all the khutspe that 'some
Jews'
are renown for and ask terribly imbecilious questions, thus troubling
men of
impeccable knowledge, when all they had to do was look it up in
some
dictionary that they could have raised with a fork lift purchased, of
course,
with loads of money that 'some Jews' are in possession of. 

So simple and yet it could have missed so serious a scholar.
Perplexing
indeed...

Subject: Y. Dobrushin

Diane Rabson asked for information on Y. Dobrushin in her 7.117-9
posting. He
was arrested in late January, 1949 along with Itzik Feffer,  Dovid
Bergelson,
Peretz Markish, Leib Kvitko, Der Nister (Pinkhos Kaganovich) and
Samuil Galkin,
the cream of Soviet Yiddish writers and poets.  Although he was not
tried and
executed along with Feffer, Bergelson, Markish and Kvitko as a
member of the
Jewish Anti-fascist Committee, he was exiled to a Gulag where he
dies in 1953. 
One comment on Diane Rabson's post.  Dobrushin should not be
identified as a
"Russian writer ..." since he was primarily a Yiddish writer, playwright
and
critic. He directed Sholem Aleikhems "Wandering Stars" for the
Byelorussian
Jewish Dramatic Theater in Minsk and adopted together with S.
Mikhoels Sholem
Aleikhem's "Tevye der Milkhiker"  for the Moscow State Jewish
Theater. The
country we, in the USA, call Russia was the Soviet Union, a distinction
that
the people there are touchy about -- Russians are but one of the
close to 200
nationalities, albeit the biggest one.

Incidentally, Mikhoels, considered one of the greatest Yiddish and
world actors
and directors, as head of the Jewish Anti-fascist Committee  was
assassinated
50 years ago, on January 12, 1948 in Minsk on direct orders from
Stalin. That
murder signalled the opening of the campaign that lead to the virtual
destruction of Yiddish culture in the Soviet Union.

Subject: Yiddish linguistics vs. Yiddish amateur linguistics

Thanks to A. Manaster Ramer for the clear explanation of sound
changes and how
they work (Mendele Vol. 07.117).  I'd been thinking about posting
something on
this subject, but couldn't have done anywhere near as good a job. 

My only comment is that he's left out the one possibility that
linguists
despise - the sporadic sound change.  While it's true that sound
changes are
almost always regular and general throughout a language or dialect,
sometimes
things just change by analogy with some related word.  An example:
the word
for the number "9" in almost all Indo-European languages has /n/ as
its first
consonant - Eng. nine, Ger.  neun, Lat. novem, Grk. ennea, Skt. nava,
etc.,
etc.  However, the Baltic and Slavic languages have /d/ for this /n/ -
Lith.
devyni, Russ.  devyat', Srb./Cro. devet, etc., etc.  This doesn't fit any
other known, regular sound changes in these languages; it's just an
anomaly. 
I was taught that it was a sporadic sound change by analogy with the
number
for "10," which begins with /d/, another dental. 

I mention all of the above to relate it to the etymology of "davenen."
None
of the explanations I've seen posted to mendele on this subject
sounds very
convincing to me.  However, if I remember correctly, the only
objection to
OFr. "divinere" as its origin is the source of the /a/; it certainly
accounts
for the consonants and the other vowels.  What's so terrible about
saying that
the initial /i/ of "divinere"  became /a/ by analogy with Heb. daf
and/or
davav, given the additional fact that -i-i- isn't a particularly common
Yiddish vowel pattern? 

Be me everyone well and strong.
