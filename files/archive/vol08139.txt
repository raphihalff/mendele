Subject: Yiddish poetry on the radio

While I have not heard any of those radio broadcasts (08.135), I do know
that Dr.  Leon Berk (z''l) wrote a poem entitled "Di shikh" while hiding in
a barn waiting to be taken to join the partisans. It was later performed in
Paris in 1946 by Jonas Turkow as part of a performance in the Sarah
Bernhardt Theatre. Dr. Berk (originally Berkowicz) was from Baranovichi and
was the chief medical officer with the "Sovyetskaya Beloruss"  partisan
unit. He later settled in Sydney, Australia.

Subject: "Kumt tsu geyn"

The use of "Es kummt zu geyn" (08.134) serves in some instances to render
the idea of "it came to pass" though some juggling of tense agreement may be
required.

Subject: "Kumt tsu geyn"

Response to jacob Nussbaums "Kumt tsu geyn" (08.134)

One uses "kumt tsu geyn" to give detail about how one has come :

1. kumen tsu geyn : with the feet
2. kumen tsu forn : with a mean of tranportation
3. kumen tsi flien : for a bird or on a fly

Subject: indefinite article

Mikhoyel Basherives (8.135) asks about the word "ayn" as in "du host dokh
ayn altn feter".  My guess would be that his feter was saying: "look, I'm
your _one_ surviving uncle".  Similarly, "mir shikh im ale ayn gris/grus"
means simply: "all of us send him the same (i.e. one) greeting". 

In short, "ayn" means "one".

Subject: Mezinke tants

Dear Mendele,

We have just returned from the home of friends where we saw the video of
their son's wedding. Both he and his bride are the last children of their
respective families to be married. The parents were seated in the center of
a circle and the families danced around them waving brooms while the band
played "Di mezinke oysgegebn." I had heard of this custom but had never seen
it at the weddings of members of my family, all from Ukraine. Is this custom
from some particular part of Eastern Europe or an American Jewish custom?

Subject: lezn  oder leyenen

meine eltern zaynen gekumen fun Rusland und mein mame-loshen zugt arois
"lezn" far "to read". Ich hob oft gezeyn "leyenen" und oych "lezn" far dos. 
"Leyenen" is fremd bei mir. Harkavy hot beyde verter aber Weinreich shraybt
az "lezn" iz nisht (oder nit? an andere pilpul) "standard yiddish". Vey iz
mir! Ich un meine eltern zaynen geven "unstandard Yidn". NU? Ich veyn un
tsiter. Vos zogt men?  Mendeleyener macht mir a kosher Yid. 
        
Weinreich was trying to force us to adopt a "standard, modern, cultured"
yidish, which denies us our familiar, comfortable mame-loshn.I would like to
hear Mordkhe Schaechter's opinion.

Subject: Leyvik's poem

I've known the Leivick poem cited by Frayda Teitelbaum since (could it be?)
the 40s. I knew it simply as "Di gele late". We sang it to a hauntingly
beautiful melody composed by Mr. Rigelhaupt(sp?), the music teacher in the
Toronto Yiddish schools. Could it be that I'm the only one around who can
still sing it? I think I've actually taught it to two other people over the
years. The first two verses are as follows: 

Unter di gele late**
Makh dayne oygn tsu
In Dachou iz dayn tate 
Shlof mayn kind lyu lyu  ] x2

In Dachou vos tut er
Un vu iz Dachou vu?
Dayn tate iz a yid a guter ]
To zay a guter yid oykh du.] x2

**Note: I think Leivick actually wrote "Unter DI gele late" and not 
"Unter DER gele(R) late".
As fror the background of this poem, the reference to Dachau suggests it.
In the same vein, note the collection of Leivick poems published under 
the title "In Treblinke bin ikh nit geven"

Subject: Baltaxe

Concerning Jennifer Baltaxe's question: The name surely designates a tax
collector (although would that have precluded him from serving in the
rabbinical court?). And, Jennifer, was your father whom I met while visiting
the synagogue in Aix-en-Provence about two years ago? An anthropologist?
>From New Zealand? I was startled by the name at the time, and he was
surprised to find someone who knew what it meant.
