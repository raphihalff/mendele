Regarding es geht mir nisht im leben.  This is perfect-
ly ordinary Yiddish and means roughly "it has no inter-
est to me or no effect on me".  It is roughly equiva-
lent to the German es ist mir ganz Wurst. Regarding af
tslokhes.  My mother says it just means "out of spite"
or "for spite".  Who can argue with his mother?

Uh, yes.  But when you're dealing with a 7-year-old and
a 5-year-old,  that's the normal situation in which you
need to use "on purpose"!

Thanks for the al-pi-tues, folks.  I think we'll start
using that one.

Bob Berk recently mailed me a copy of "Kasrilevker
Restoranen" as written by Sholem Aleichem, after I
mentioned on mail.yiddish how much I enjoyed the skit,
which we have on a tape.  I was rather startled to see
Kasrilevke spelled kaph-saf-resh etc., rather than kuf-
alef-samekh-resh etc.  Obviously Sholom Aleichem was
(humorously?) drawing the name from Hebrew. What's the
etymology?  Kesser is a crown, right?  I suppose the
Slavicization of a Hebrew word by putting a typical
Russian ending on it is part of the game.  Can anyone
provide more background on this?

Mikhl: I'm willing to be led by you in virtually all
matters lexical, but draw the line at kapoyer/kapoyre. 
True, the spelling supports you but what's spelling to
a Podolian who cherishes the rhythm of Moyshe Kapoyre? 

Pronounced either way, the word is spelled with a kof
and is as you say in no way related to kapores.  Your
'darfn af kapores' has a typically clumsy-sounding
back-formation in Hebrew: 'ani tsarikh oto l'kaporot',
something I can just hear the children of Ethipian
immigrants saying a few years hence.  When something
fairly valuable was broken or lost there would be
(after the hand-wringing, blaming, etc.): Nu, a sheyne,
reyne kapore. If the object wasn't very important my
family skipped the mourning and cheerfully imitated the
Galician-Polish style: A shAyne, rAyne etc.  

Dept. of Clarification.  Shlogn kapores, Mikhl, doesn't
involve a _chicken_; it's a rooster.  'Ze tarnegol
oyleykh l'miso' (this rooster is going to its death) is
a line I'll never forget because when still quite young
I understood the words and stopped whirling that hap-
less bird in mid-expiation and burst into tears.  From
that time forward my family made donations to charity.

Finally, you're is right about 'taves'.  Should I con-
fess to a tin ear in matters Litvish?  I confess.

Yankel Kessler: you're right as well.  There is indeed
a thin sliver of Bessarabia on the east bank of the
Dniester.  So says the Times Atlas.  I'm afraid that I
spent too many hours over a wonderful set of maps of
Poland published by Rizzi-Zannoni in 1772, at which
time (according to R-Z) the Dniester was the border. My
Neue Brockhaus, liberated in 1945, says the same thing,
but I won't argue with you or the Times.  A small
detail even in the light of R-Z's map, the relevant
plate of which says: 'Carte des Frontieres de Pologne
depuis la Fin des Karpaks en Transylvanie jusques aux
Territoire des Tatars-Bessarabes'.  Tatars-Bessarabes? 
You bet.  This is where the expression 'optun af
Terkish' stems from.  And the towns are given in what I
suppose are the Turkic names though in Arabic alphabet.

So it's a neck of the woods where lots of redefining
has gone on.  (And will?)  In addition to von Rizzori
there's Shlomo Bickel (father of Alexander B., a lead-
ing constitutionalist at Yale Law School until his
untimely death) whose fond memoir 'A Shtot mit Yiden'
describes the shift in orientation from Vienna to
Bucharest following the first War in places like
Bukovina and eastern Galicia.
