Subject: Yiddish Grad and Undergraduate Programs

I am writing this message to share information that I have gathered
in the last few months with all those others interested in Yiddish
studies.  I know of Yiddish programs at Columbia, Harvard, McGill,
UCLA, U of Texas at Austin, Oxford, U of Tel-Aviv,the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem,Yeshiva U,  and the U of Ohio.  I believe
programs may also exist at Bar-Ilan and  UPenn (A professor just
wrote yesterday about Yiddish offerings there).  I believe that
Khana Kronfeld at Berkeley will be offering a Yiddish Lit program
one year from now, and I think it is possible to study Yiddish there
now in the Comp Lit Department.  Anita Norwich at U of Michigan
apparently teaches Yiddish literature there, but she is (I think) in
the English Dep't and I don't believe a Yiddish Studies program
exists there.

I am an undergraduate at Yale, where only a class entitled "Yiddish
for German speakers" is now offered.  This class provides an
introduction to Yiddish language, culture, and literature.  It is
taught by Howard Stern, a German professor here whose first language
was Yiddish.  Mr. Stern is also willing to do tutorials with
individual students or small groups in Yiddish Literature.  An
introductory language class is taught at the Yale Hillel by Sid
Resnik, who is the primary organizer of the Yale Yidisher Vinkl, a
Leyenkrayz meeting weekly.  Prof. Benjamin Harshav is also at Yale
in the Comp Lit Dept.  He is the author of several anthologies and
translations of Yiddish and Hebrew verse, as well as books such as
"The Meaning of Yiddish" and "Language in the Time of Revolution"
(By the way, I highly recommend both books.)

As far as I can tell, Columbia offers one of the more diverse
programs in Yiddish Studies.  It seems to provide training in
linguistics and ethnology, as well as history and literature.
McGill seems to concentrate in history and literature, and Harvard
mainly in literature with a multidisciplinary cultural background.
Both the U of Texas and UCLA offer dual masters programs in Yiddish
and German,and seem to offer much linguistics and folklore, as well
literature.  I have been in contact with all of these schools and
most express a good amount of willingness to mold their programs to
fit the needs and interests of students.  Hebrew is an absolute
necessity for those with more than a passing interest in history,
and a combination of German, Hebrew, and a Slavic tongue would of
course be beneficial for the study of Yiddish language and
linguistics.  Most programs expect you to know Hebrew before
entering or to master it very soon after admission.  These 5 are the
only programs which I have thus far researched in depth, so I don't
really feel qualified to comment on the others. I am glad to see so
many other inquiries about Yiddish from younger students, for I
feared that I was one of a few.

Blayb gezund,

Subject: Rachel Korn

I'm not sure if this is the proper forum for this, but I just read a
poem by Rachel Korn that I would like to share with other
Mendeleniks.  It is one of the most beautiful poems I have ever
read.  Unfortunately, I have only read the English version.  It is
entitled A New Dress:

Today for the first time
after seven long years
I put on
a new dress.

But it's too short for my grief,
too narrow for my sorrow,
and each white-glass button
like a tear
flows down the folds
heavy as a stone.

What do you think?

Subject: Yiddish Language & Literature at JTS

A well-kept secret, but since Mendele has already blown Philologus's
cover, I thought I might do one better.  The Jewish Theological
Seminary now offers a full complement of graduate courses in Yiddish
Language and Literature.  As of Fall 1993, Peysakh Fiszman offers
Introductory, Intermediate and Advanced Yiddish.  Each course meets
twice a week.  The core curriculum in Yiddish literature consists of
a three-semester course on the History of Yiddish Literature:
1780-1880, 1880-1918 and 1918-1976.

These courses are taught in Yiddish and are required of all students
studying for the MA or Ph.D.  We are currently completing the sequence for
the first time and will be starting all over again in the Fall of 1994.  In
addition, I am offering a course on I. B. Singer and the Yiddish
Tradition, taught in English, but with all the texts painstakingly
reproduced in PARALLEL TEXT EDITIONS.  (They are not for distribution
outside the classroom.)

I am also giving a course on the Literature of the Holocaust with an
emphasis on Yiddish writings in the ghettos and death camps  (for
instance, the writings of Yehoshua Perle).   The Department of
JewsLiterature, which offers specializations in medieval and modern
Hebrew literature and Liturgy as well.  Students with an interest in
combining literature and history can apply to the program in Modern
Jewish Studies.  Here, Prof. David Fishman offers numerous courses
on East European Jewish history and culture.  If anyone out there is
interested, s/he may contact me via E-mail or by phone @
212-678-8914.  The time to apply for next year is NOW.  Especially
for financial aid.
