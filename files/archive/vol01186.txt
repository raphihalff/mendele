Subject: (Generically) "Bundist" Schools

The Arbeter Ring (i.e., Workmen's Circle) schools in
America were patterned after the Bund schools of Europe.
Joseph Mlotek, who belongs to the Bund, went to Bund
schools in Europe, and was Educational Director of the
Workmen's Circle for many years, told me this in an
interview.  Many of us here, I believe, did indeed attend
Arbeter Ring schools.  So, I could accept the logic of
calling both the European Bundist schools and the American
Arbeter Ring schools generically "Bundist".  Doesn't seem
like too big a deal.

even sure it's used *elsewhere*. (and berkeley is
definitely not in the yinglish zone...)

Subject: Introduction

Dear Noyekh,

        Shalom colanu!

        I am a sophomore here at Connecticut College double
majoring in Psychology and Judaic & Israeli Studies.  As a
Jew, a student, and a curious individual, I am interested
in hearing about the views of others concerning Judaism,
Zionism, Israel, American Jews, Jewish Americans, etc.

Sincerely,

Lisa Leah Darginsky

Subject: rabonishe etimologyes

Meylekh V.: You splendidly illustrate what has long been
known in the Yiddish linguistic literature as _rabonishe
etimologyes_.  These ingenious construction s are of purely
homiletic value. If what is regarded as a religious truth
can be elicited from word-play, then for the believer an
occult "source" has been uncovered (or better, created).
But this is different from ordinary folk or "naive"
etymologizing.  A good instance of the latter is Israeli
Hebrew _frayer_ (from Y. _frayer_ < Polish _frajer_
'gull').  The meaning in IH is 'gull', but some Israelis
believe it is from Y. _frayer_ 'irreligious'. Rafael Sapan,
in his _Milon slang hayisraeli_ (Y-m: Kiryat-sefer, 1966,
p. 57) even gives 'porek ol' as a second sense besides the
primary one of 'tam'. He then adds regarding this second
sense that it arose due to a misunder- standing of the
Yiddish word.  In ordinary usage folk etymology means naive
or mistaken etymology, although there are surely
traditional "folk" explanation s of origins of names and
words which merit serious attention.
