Subject: Mr. Boym in the Closet

My student Ken Wishnia is working on a translation of
Sholem Aleykhem's short one-act play "Mister Boym in
klazet".  It depicts a confrontation between a veteran New
Yorker whose Yiddish is full of English and his "green"
sister, whose Yiddish is maybe a bit heavy on the Slavic.
We've managed to identify most of the obscure (to us, at
least, and to his father and my mother) words and phrases,
in some instances by consulting a Slavist friend, but there
are a few puzzles left.  Can anyone help with the
following?  We can guess, but does anyone know?

"holedrantses":  Some sort of insulting term; 'hooligans',
'good-for-nothings'?

kleytl: 'bar, barroom'.  It's a room within an inn or
tavern.

"shnaydn bay der neyditsh".  Sew with a machine?  Some
specialized form of sewing?

What's the feminine of the good Amero-Yiddish word
"lendlord"?  Sholem Aleykhem uses "lendlorikhe" -- what's
that -khe suffix?  I seem to remember some discussion of it
in Mendele last year, but can't recall the details.

Subject: consonantal shift

Is it just coincidence that there is a sound shift in
Sephardic/ Ashkenaz which appears to parallel one in
Indogermanic?  I think of emet/emes and das/dat, for
example.

Subject: Onkl/feter

To Eli Katz: although marginal to the point of your message
about your "onkl", it's an interesting
phenomenon--onkl/feter, that is--that has it Western
Yiddish parallels as well: younger people called their
grandpare "oma and opa" while they knew their great
grandparents by thje terms wit which their own parents
addressed them "fra:le" and "ha:rle". My own aun and uncles
were also "onkl" and "tante" (sometimes "auntie") while I
cal my parents aunts and uncles "mime" and "feter". You and
I seem to be of same vintage. Best regards.

Mikhl.

Shalom Mischa van Vlaardingen,

I tried to bitnet you directly but my e-mail was
undelivered, so I hope you read my message on the network.
I am the person who arranged for the Jewish Daily Forward
to send to you directly a subscription form for the
newspaper. I am curious to hear from you after you get the
actual newspaper and have made the time to read through its
contents. If you have any problems, I am only a local phone
call away from the New York Office of the Jewish Forward.
Mazel Tov on acquiring a second dutch Mendelnik. With
Yiddish regards,

Goldie

Subject: RE: Yiddish typesetting

There's a Yiddish font called Mordkhe that was made truly
Yiddish using Fontographer.  The process and some technical
issues, e.g., why a Hebrew font isn't good enough, were
discussed in an issue of the Yugentruf journal a year or so
ago by the font's creator, Adam Whiteman.

Dorothy Wasserman has a company, Wasserman Associates, that
sells this font.  They're in NYC.  She introduced herself
electronically as a mendelnik in Mendele Vol. 2 no.46,
giving her email address:

 71201.3150@CompuServe.COM

Nobody on Mendele responded a while back when I asked how
the Yugentruf journal and Afn Shvel were published by
computer, so I asked Gitl Schaechter myself recently.  I
was a little surprised by the answer: "We still take it to
the Hasidim in Brooklyn for typesetting." She indicated,
however, that they did expect to be able to do everything
by computer eventually.
