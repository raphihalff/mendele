Subject: Jewish/Yiddish Humor and Germany

The New York Times of Jan 25th this year had an article from Marburg, Germany
by Alan Cowell regarding a "Days of Comedy" devoted to humor and satire, etc.,
in Germany, one theme of which was that humor was in short supply and becoming
narrow and restricted in contemporary Germany.

The end of the article quoted one Harry Rowohlt, a speaker at the 'Days" as
follows: "Of course there's not much laughing matter." Mr. Rowohlt said.  And
one reason for that was about as serious as you can get. "German humor was
mainly Jewish humor, and the United States inherited that," he said.

Is it accurate that "German humor was mainly Jewish humor" and was this based
on Yiddish?  Certainly, Yiddish was the background to almost all of the
"Jewish" humor in the US, created by various immigrant Jewish peoples.  And
while I can think of many other immigrant groups that have contributed to
American humor -- Irish, Italian, French and Spanish/Latin (as well as various
black/African-American sources) easily spring to mind -- I  can't recall any
German-American comedians, humorists, etc., of vaudeville, radio and now TV
prominence.  Is this a blind spot in my experience?  I certainly recall that
German immigrants were the subject of vaudeville jokes, along with other
ethnic groups, but I can't think of German comedians.  My Borsht Belt days
dredge up lots of ethnic comics, but a German comedian in the Borsht Belt
seems inconceiveable...

Can any of the Mendeleners knowledgeable in these areas shed any light on
these matters, especially Mr. Rowohlt's assertion?

P.S. I exclude H.L. Mencken, who was an ironic satirist of aspects of American
life from the ranks of comedians as this was not his main claim to fame.  He
was no Peter Finley Dunne...

Subject: Yiddish for psychoanalysts

A dank Zellig.  A mekhaye tsu hern epes vegn a yidishn film, _Undzere Kinder_
fun 1948 nit lang oyfgedekt (5.310, 2) .

That it is to be shown and discussed at sessions of the American
Psychoanalytic Association reminds me of a quip I read a few years ago in the
L.A. Times.  As I remember it, a Beverly Hills psychoanalyst advised his
colleagues to apply a guiding principle to bolster the analyst's disciplined
maintenance of 1) proper social distance along with 2) emotional closeness (a
tricky job, I would guess).

He said: _Dress British; think Yiddish_.

Subject: Tsatskele

In Mendele 5.310 Zellig Bach discusses Wm. Safire's exposition of "tsatske" or
"tsatskele" -- with variant spellings.  I'd like to add a few words to this.
My great aunt had a considerable collection of small glass figurines --
horses, coaches, ballerinas, vays ikh vus.  My mother always referred to these
as "tsatskes" and dust collectors.  I understood that she meant something like
baubles, but the tone was derisive.  My kid sister's dolls and toy stoves were
also referred to as "tsatskes," but the tone here was protective and
indulgent.  Occasionally, I would hear of my youngest uncle as being my
grandmother's "tsatskele der mames"; the tone here was, depending on who made
the observation, envious or merely descriptive of my uncle being her favorite
child.  This very same uncle referred to one of his sisters-in-law as a "real
tsatskele," meaning a woman who expected to be, and was, indulged. From these
and kindred examples I don't think an attractive woman, who is called a
tsatskele, would necessarily be thought of, as Georg Simmel would say, as
having a wonderful past ahead of her.

Subject: Tsatske

This is with reference to a posting by Zellig Bach relative to the word
tsatske.  My memory of yiddish, though I have not spoken nor read it for many
years, is that a "tshotshke" is a toy and that "tsatske" is a dear, sweet
young lady.

Have I disremembered over the  years??

Subject: Tsaskele and tchotchkele

Safire in the NYTimes pointed out that there are 2 pronunciations of the term
tsaskele or tchotchkele, the first from the Polish and the second from the
Russian. Both occur in Yiddish as i pointed out about a year ago and are used
slightly differntly. Tsatske is more pejorative in some dialects than
tchotchke. For example: "Oy iz zi a tsatske!"   But, "Zi hot gekoyft nokh a
tchatchke!" Both expressions can occur in the same dialect.

Subject: Fonye

Fonye is a derogatory slang nickname distortion of the common Russian name
Ivan. Hence it was used to refer to the Tsar: e.g. Fonye Ganif.

Subject: Fonye

I have seen the word transliterated as "fonya" and believe it comes from the
Russian name "Vanya" and was used as a slang reference to Russia and Russians.
Example:  To avoid being conscripted into fonya's army.
