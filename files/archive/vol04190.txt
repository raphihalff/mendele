Subject: Patshi patshi kikhelekh

My 3-year-old can answer this one for you:

patshi patshi kikhelekh
di mame vet koyfn shikhelekh
der tate vet koyfn zekalekh
far <kid's name> fisalekh!

There are lots of minor variations.
One has the last line as "dos kind vet esn kikhalekh!".

Subject: Interpretation of "The Pious Cat" by Peretz

Our little leyenkreis has just read "Di Fruhmeh Kahtz" by Peretz.  It
does not seem to be "stam" a "meiseh", but rather an allegory.  We would
like to know if anyone on Mendele has an interpretation for this story,
or if anyone can lead us to a reference which discusses the meaning and
significance of the story.

Subject: Campaign for a New Edition of Steinmetz's Book

Sol Steinmetz, the well-known lexicographer and Executive Director of the
Random House dictionaries, is a "yidisher yid" in all respects.

He is a true "khoyveyv yidish," a lover of Yiddish, and his book _A
Century of Yiddish in America:  Yiddish and English_ is one of the few
books seriously treating the influence of Yiddish lexemes and usages upon
contemporary English.

The book demonstrates not only his scholarly research, but the care,
enthusiasm, and love he invested in his work.  It is an enriching,
_teacherly_, book, with a special chapter on romanization and a short
glossary of Yiddish words and their English equivalents, an excellent
reference work for anyone interested in Yiddish.

The book, however, published in 1986, is out of print.

I sent a letter to the University of Alabama Press, its publishers,
urging them to issue a new edition of the book.  Herewith a copy of my
letter:

May I respectfully suggest to re-issue Sol Steimetz'es book _A Century of
Yiddish in America_for the following considerations:

a)  There is a definite strong movement of interest and renewal in
academic institutions, offering courses in Yiddish and Yiddish
literaturte;

b) Many well-known universities and colleges are establishing in their
libraries special sections of Yiddish literature sponsored by the
National Yiddish Book Center;

c)  There is a wide movement of Yiddish Clubs all over the United States
fostering the maintenance and furtherance of the Yiddish language. These
Clubs just held in Toronto, Canada, their Second International Conference
(October 7-10, 1994).  Number of participans 184, an inctrease of 45
participants from the First International Conference of Yiddish Clubs a
year ago.

d)  The electronic E-mail group called _Mendele:  Yiddish Literature and
Language_.

The number of current subscrikbers to Mendele is about 600, and the
subscriber list increases every montn by 8 -10 new members.  It is to be
expected that this list will within one year's time reach ther 1,000
mark. And continue growing.

Mendele subscribers arer hundreds of plain folk, as well as from
different academic fields, not just Linguistics--faculty members, retired
academicians, instructors, students.

Mendele distributes to its subscribers 7 - 8 times a week its lively
bulletins, filled with rich materials about Yiddish, Yiddish literature,
history of the Jewish people and the recent past, scientific inquiries,
etc, representing a colorful exchange and lively discussion forum of
opinions and views.  All published matter in Mendele is written by its
members.

Please note that the Mendele list of subscribers consists not just of
members in the United States, but also from all over the world, namely
from:  Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany,
Great Britain, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand,
Poland, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey.

On the basis of all the above enumerated factors, it is evident that you
would now have a ready target audience, with a much greater buying
potential than when you published this book in 1986.

In a follow-up letter several days later I mailed to the University of
Alabama Press a front-page article from the  English _Forward_ (October
22, 1994), entitled "Reyd Nor Yidish"  (Speak Only Yiddish), a detailed
and enthusiastic report of the Second International Conference of Yiddish
Clubs in Toronto.

I called their attention to the last paragraph of the article: "With the
love that brings these neo-Yidishists together... the air was full with
joy at being in the bosom of the _mishpokhe_ and of being flagrantly
addicted to--Yiddish."

Let's hope this type of gentle pressure from the public will bear
results.
