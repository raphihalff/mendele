Subject: Yiddish use by the haredim

In  5.217 Steve  Jacobson asked  about the  use of  Yiddish among  the haredim
in America and Israel, especially in comparison with their use of English or
Hebrew respectively.

I can  only give some anecdotal  evidence.  My wife works  as a social worker
in our district hospital.  One  of the haredi women who came to her for
advice was in her  twenties, born in Jerusalem  and living in the haredi part
of Ashdod.  They spoke in fluent  Hebrew, and then my wife explained
something more technical  about a genetic  issue.  The woman asked  her if
she could  repeat it perhaps  in Yiddish  as that would enable  her to
understand  it better.   I give this,  *one* case "study" for what  it is
worth, but I still  remember the surprise with which my  wife told it  to me,
as she had  not expected this  of that sabra lady.

Subject: Jewish balalaikas

The great klezmer clarinetist Dave Tarras (1897-1987) played, among other
instruments, the balalaika (there is a beautiful photo of him playing his one
accompanying the notes to my CD anthology "Dave Tarras: Father of
Yiddish-American Klezmer Music" (Yazoo).

Also the prolific Yiddish bandleader I.J. Hochman (1883-?) in addition to his
klezmer/theater orchestra also recorded discs under the heading "Hochman's St.
Petersburg Balalaika Orchestra" (Emerson, 1924) and "I.J. Hochman and his
Russian Balalaika Orchestra" (Pathe 1924/25).

Subject: Badkhonim: a reply and a question

In response to Ariela Krasney's request for ideas about badkhonim in
Yiddish literature [Mendele Vol 5.229]:

Itsik Fefer's 1937 poem "a khasene in birobidzhan" includes descriptions of a
"marshalek," which seems to be a badkhn figure. But later in the poem, Fefer
says that there was no badkhn at the wedding. Here are the lines in question:

un undzer lets, der marshalek, shteyt oykh shoyn oybnon,
er kayet a tsukerkele shoyn mitn letstn tson.
tsezingt zikh undzer marshalek: "oy kale, kale, veyn,
un esn zolstu, kalenyu, gefilte fish mit khreyn!
un hobn zolstu kinderlekh, antikelekh a sakh,
zolstu zayn a gute mame zey. s'iz oykh a groyse zakh!
...
-- iz tut a shpil, klezmorimlekh, der kale a vivat,
keyn shadkhn nit, keyn badkhn nit, un khasene gehat!


Harkavy's definitions of "marshalek" (spelled "marshelik") and "badkhn" are
both: "joculator, jester (at weddings)," and his Hebrew definition of
"marshelik" is "badkhn." Weinreich's definition of "marshelik" is only
"jester," while his definition of "badkhn" is specific to weddings. What did
Fefer intend as the meanings for these two words?

Subject: Yiddish in English

Yetz kumt "The Wall Street Journal" un shraybt yiddish, un takeh ofn ershter
bl at.  In today's Journal, Joan E. Rigdon, writing about the World Wide Web,
obse rves that the Web, "groaning under 7.5 million daily users, is
increasingly flooded with cyber-dreck."

Of course, Ms. Rigdon is correct, and it's always good to see mame-loshn in
such a distinguished journal.  But wouldn't it be nice if somehow, some day,
we wo uld encounter some of its lovely words, rather than those such as
"dreck," "chutzpah," and the like, in the writings of journalists and popular
writers.  No d oubt we must thank vaudeville for the commonness,to put it as
politely as poss ible, or the vulgarity, to be more direct about it, of most
English yiddishisms .  Vaudeville is dead, but its spirit lives on in vulgar
Yiddish.  Can anyone c ome up with a way to introduce the beautiful spirit of
Yiddish to a wider public?  Can anyone come up with a list of words he or she
wishes were introduced into common parlance?  I can think of a few, but would
prefer to hear from others.
