Subject: Cat's cradle

Aha!!  Have I found a weak spot in Yiddish???!

Two weeks ago I posted a question about the Yiddish name for the string
game, cat's cradle.  I said that I knew the game only by the name "ettel
bettel" and would some kind soul tell me the origin of this name or if
these words were simply nonsense syllables?

The silence is deafening!

Does this mean that with all the resources at the disposal of the members
of this list, no one knows where the name of the game came from?

I did receive a private note from a man whose family came from the
Ukraine who told me that Ettel Bettel was exactly what his family called
the same game so from this I learned that the term may be universal and
not geographic to Poland (which is where my family came from), but it is
really too early to make that generalization.

From the absence of any response to my question will Philologos take this
to mean (and write an article in Forward) on how none of the Mendleniks
ever played cat's cradle = ettel bettel?  This would show that our youths
were very affluent for it was a game of the poor.  After all, to a poor
child, a piece of string was an hour's worth of entertainment.

Subject: Noyfes tsufim

I don't recall seeing any definitive responses to Paul Pascal's query re
Noyfes tsufim.  The following from the _Encyclopaedia Judaica_ indicates
that it is likely a version of the Ze'enah u-Re'enah: "a miscellany of
tales, homilies, Midrashim, and exegetical comments woven around a
Yiddish rendering and paraphrasing of the Pentateuch, the haftarot and
the megillot, written in a lively, simple, and flowing style. The
commentaries and Midrashim from different sources supplementing and
expounding the selected biblical passages were well known and popular.

"The various early editions show few linguistic differences, but in the
18th-century editions these became so numerous that Ze'enah u-Re'enah
became a kind of laboratory for the Yiddish language. The 19th-century
editions also contain textual variations, _which sometimes bear the
imprint of a particualr ideological trend in Judaism (mainly of Haskalah
and Hasidism_)."

Subject: eks-laks

I could imagine more savory subjects with which to make one's debut on
mendele, however, since I happen, quite serendipitously, to have the
desired information immediately to hand, here it is:

                        Eks-laks

                Tsigele-migele kotinke -
                Eks-laks iz a maykhl!
                Est men oyf a shtikele
                Tut nit vey in baykhl

                Tsigele-migele kotinke -
                Fun eks-laks filt men munter
                Est men oyf a shtikele
                Filt men bald gezunter

                        in ale drog stors.


This ad appeared in every (monthly) issue of the Kinder zhurnal (New
York: Sholem aleykhem folks-institut) in the bottom left hand corner of
the back cover from (at least - all to hand) April 1928 to March 1929. I
would expect the firm to have employed other poetasters to extol their
salutary product in alternative formulations on other occasions.
