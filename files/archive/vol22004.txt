Subject: bakhmalyet

My late uncle, from Kamenets-Podolsk, used the word bakhmalyet. I
think he meant  something like sad or disappointed. I haven't found
this word in dictionaries. Does anyone know what it means and its
etymology?

Could it be related to the Hebrew khemlah (khet mem lamed hay),
meaning compassion  or pity?

Thanks,
Alan Shuchat

Subject: Glikl Hamels memoirs

There is, in fact, an edition of Glikl of Hamlin that was published in
bilingual format in  Israel: with the original Yiddish text facing the
Hebrew translation of Chava Turiansky. It  ws published by Magnes
Press in 1996, under the title:

Glikl: Zichronos 1691-1719

I hope this helps.

Zayt gezunt,
Avi Gold

Subject: Glikl Hamel

In response to the Glikl Question / a tshuva tsu der "Glikl" frage:

The recently published Hebrew-Yiddish edition (edited by Chana
Turniansky, published  y Merkaz Zalman Shazar) contains the full text
of the original as well as useful scholarly annotation- including what
Glikl meant to say every time she misquotes a Sefer or what the actual
source is when she misattributes a reference.

This is by far the best edition published of Glikl due to
completeness, scholarship and translation + original (unlike the JPS
one).

Hello Mendele,

I propose a makher-shmakher.

Subject: Flukhkes

"Fluchkes" is the formal English title of a 2011 Israeli Documentary
film. In all the PR blurbs, "fluchkes" is described as "Yiddish for
flabby arms." The closest I can come to understanding that is the
possibility that the term is actually related to "platshke." I'd
appreciate any other suggestions or enlightenment.

Subject: gehakte vundn

For some time now, my family has been puzzling over a phrase my mother
used to use, something like "gehochte vinten" or "gehakte vinten,"
meaning some thing like "the far ends of the earth" or maybe "out in
the boonies." Now, we don't know whether this is Yiddish (or some
perversion thereof), or perhaps a family coinage.  We also may not be
remembering the phrase correctly.

Any ideas what this might be?

Thanks, and best,

Martha B. Helfer

Es loyfn, es yogn

Un es brumt di vind

Fun Siber shraybt dayn tate ......
...... eyntsik kind ...
that's all I can remember
