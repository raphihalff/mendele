Am I alone in thinking that in his posting of Jan 2 (Mendele Vol. 6.182)
about his search for _shvantz_, Gilad Gevaryahu overstepped the bounds
of propriety?  Is Gevaryahu possibly a non-native speaker of English who
doesn't fully appreciate the nuances of his closing remark? I'd sooner
believe that the formulation at the end of his posting was as
inadvertent as it was unfortunate, than think that he is, in fact, what
it makes him appear to be.  If it was intentional, he should have looked
for the _shvantz_ much closer to home.

It would not be to the honor of Uriel Weinreich, _olevasholem_, to cite
his particular personal or professional merits here, or to suggest that
they, alone, should have precluded such nastiness. I don't think that
the equal of Gevaryahu's remark has slipped past the watchful eye of our
editor in all the years of Mendele postings that I've read.

Perhaps, if Gevaryahu is as his name implies, perhaps he would
offer a public apology.

Subject: Yiddish dictionaries: a correction

Regarding my posting about the Weinreich dictionary (Vol.6.182), I
erroneously said that Harkavy's dictionary indicates genders.  I meant
just the opposite:  it seldom indicates genders--which is especially
misleading for a Hebrew speaker since any number of Hebrew/Aramaic nouns
change gender in Yiddish, and for a German speaker since an excruciating
number of cognate nouns in Yiddish have a different gender than in
German.  The best and--so far as I know--only safe source for Yiddish
genders is Weinreich's dictionary.  granted, with some nouns you have a
choice, but that's never been a problem for me.

On the plus side, Harkavy does provide plurals--but since, as I've said
before--he doesn't indicate the pronunciation of Hebrew-Aramaic
borrowings in Yiddish, we have no choice but to turn to Weinreich. And
within its limits, I find his dictionary close to excellent.

I have another Yiddish dictionary, this one a small paperback by D.M.
Harduf, printed in Canada and bearing a 1983 copyright.  Harduf seems to
have followed Weinreich at least in the absence of the word "tokhes."
Does anyone know anything else about this dictionary's biases?

Al Grand asked about the plural of "tokhes."  According to the Harkavy
1898 dictionary, it appears to be "tokheser" or perhaps "tekheser."
It's a Hebrew word, and its pronunciation is not given.  The spelling
ads Ayin-Resh to the singular.  Right after it is what appears to be
"tochesunim," meaning "trowsers."  The 1928 Harkavy dictionary gives the
pronunciation of that as "takhtonim."  It doesn't give the pronunciation
of the plural of "tokhes."

Regarding the expression "Patch zikh in tokhes un shray 'bravo'!"  my
mother said it too, and she said that her mother used to say it to her.
She pronounced it, "Patchekh in tukhes un shray 'Braba'!"

Subject: Yiddish dictionaries

Among the other pros and cons in the Weinreich v. Harkavy dictionary
discussion there is one that I find quite perplexing, not to say
annoying. The physical quality of the typography in my edition of the
1928 Harkavy Y-E-H dictionary is very bad. Words are blurred, letters
are broken and some passages are close to unreadable.

This seems to have been a problem with the version that was
photo-reproduced by YIVO for their reissue a couple of years ago. I
recall thinking when I saw it what a shame it was, and chalking it all
up to what I supposed must have been poor-quality printing back in the
20s. But I've since seen a friend's original copy of the same dictionary
and noticed that it is much clearer and easier to read, as well as
printed on apparently thicker paper stock.

Might anyone know the production history, or have a theory about what
circumstances resulted in such inconsistancy?

Subject: _Minskes' Yom Tov Bleter_

In rummaging through my father's manuscripts, I came across a pamphlet
entitles "Minskes' Yom Tov Bleter --- 20 yoriker yubileum albom", which
contains excellent photos of more than 120 Yiddish writers (From Sholem
Ash, Apatoshu and Olgin through Sholem Aleichem and Fradel Shtok) who
appeared in the Yom Tov Bleter from 1896 to 1916. There is no
introduction, no explanation, no place of publication --- just the
photos and the contributor's names. Can anyone enlighten me on the
background of this pamphlet?

A second mystery. One picture has been cut out. It was either the upper
right of page 21 (Probably someone between Dr. A. Kaspe and Z.
Kornblith) or its obverse, the upper left of page 22, which contains the
pictures of Morris Rosenfeld, Sh. Rosenfeld and Iun Rosenfeld. If anyone
has access to this pamphlet, I'd be curious to know whose picture it
was.
