Subject: Glikl Hemel's loshn koydeshdike un mayrev yidishdike oysdrukn

To Rick Gildmeister and other "gliklekhe meyvonim":

In my article on Glikl's zikhoynes in the journal "Yiddish" vol 8,
Spring,1992 I posit other possible factors  for the high percentage of
loshn koydesh in her work. --Her wide reading among the muser
verk, tkhines, Tsene-rene and other homiletic didactic works, many of
them direct translations from the Hebrew and her very frequent exposure
to the magidim whose lexis was heavily Hebraic and the constant presence
of at least one toyre melamid in her household. These latter sources are
oral and, as I point out Glikl's citations and their anomalies can be
frequently illuminated by reference to oral rather than written sources.

I hesitate to add anything to the ongoing makhloyke about editing Mendele
postings to conform to klal (read YIVO) standardization, but I would
volunteer to help if such an editorial "board" would be considered
viable. Zayt ir ale gezunt,

Dvosye Bilik

The form "shoufel" is as far as I know not found in Dutch and that is not
the only way in which I find myself misquoted. You may have read
something where I've stated that there are words in Dutch which are
generally said to be of Yiddish origin, but which actually entered the
language through thieves' cant. I didn't say that Dutch thieves' language
is based on Yiddish. That World War II would have affected the existence
or nature of Dutch thieves' language significantly is new to me. Are you
insinuating that the disappearance of 80% of Dutch Jewry meant the
extinction of the Dutch underworld?

I am not an adherent of the theory that Yiddish came into existence as a
crypto-language invented by secretive Jews only so the non-Jews wouldn't
be able to understand their dealings. Expressions which are used among
groups to exclude outsiders can be found in any language, I don't think
that the emergence of Yiddish can be sufficiently explained that way. I
thought we had moved on since J.W. and Itzik Feitel Stern.

Subject: rogelekh > rogal

For some speakers the pastry is a _ro'gal_.  (Is there such a pastry in
Polish or other Slavic language?)  You can imagine that Yiddish phonology
nativized it to _rogl_, reinterpretted this to be a diminutive to which
the further imminutive may apply, and created _rogele_.  (The non-litvish
form _rugelekh_, usually spelled _rug(g)elach_, seems to be the most
common form in American bakeries.)

If I remember correctly, _rogal_ is a form listed alongside _rogelekh_ in
Stutshkov's _Oytser_.  Don't have it at hand at the moment.

Subject: etymology of rogelakh

I have always assumed that the root is a Slavic rog, 'horn'.  My mother,
who baked the best rogelakh in the world for many decades, called them
'horns' when she wanted to be fency... (You know the kugel ~ kigel joke:
"in our house vi call it 'pudjing'...)  The crescent shape, is after all,
also the shape of the horn on a young goat or a European (?) fallow deer.
Which brings us to the term for carob my father always used, 'boksa', a
Yiddish preservation of the older German Bockshorn, later replaced (as in
other Western European languages) by Sanktjohannesbrod, not used by the
Jews for obvious reasons...

Subject: A letter from Sholem-Aleykhem to Mendele

I reproduce here a Yiddish letter from Sholem-Aleykhem in Boyarka (his
summer place) to Mendele Moykher Sforim in Odessa, I believe.  I think
Mendele was a principal in a Talmud Toyre there.  The letter is dated
Aug. 10, 1895.  Sholem-Aleykhem had lost the family money in 1890, and
was, no doubt, still suffering the effects.  However, the first Tevye
piece had already appeared in print.  He was back writing masterful work.
He had recovered a cautious confidence and optimism.

Sholem-Aleykhem here is acceding to an acquaintance's request for help.
He is acting as intercessor for someone who wants to approach Mendele for
help but is too shy.  It is an interesting bit of light on social customs
of the time.

There are a couple of daytshmerisms here which he had resolved to
eradicate a few years earlier.  His later letters and other writing
tended to have fewer.

Sholem-aleykhem aykh zeyde lebn, vos makht ir guts? Reyshes, kum ikh aykh

Subject: Yiddish on short-wave radio from Israel

The documentation accompanying the Grundig short-wave radio I just bought
lists a 15-minute daily broadcast in Yiddish from Israel.  Does anyone
out there know anything about it?  Is it beamed to the East Coast?  Could
it be received in Texas (where I reside)?
