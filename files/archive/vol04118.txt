Subject: "Az der bubbe vot gehat.."

Steven Pinker, a leading language scientist, professor and director of
the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, recipient of many research awards and a teaching prize from
M.I.T., published recently a book _The Language Instinct_ (William Morrow
& Co., Inc., 494 pp., 1994).

It won general wide acclaim from reviewers.  After reading in the New
York Times _Book Review_ an evaluation of the book, I went out and
purchased it.

It is of great interest to all lovers of languages in general, in which
category I humbly include myself, and in one instance cited below of some
concern to a proud lover of the Yiddish language.

The author's specialty is the study of language development in children,
an area in which I found great fascination in my own specialty, that of
psychology and psychoanalysis.

I always considered it a mark of intellectual achievement, akin to a
minor mental miracle, when a very young child said for the first time "I
Saw it."  How did he learn to use the past tense?  Did his mother or
father sit him down and teach him verb conjugation?  Not likely!  He just
figured it out all by himself from listening to, and apparently
analyzing, the speech of adults. Suddenly, and what seemed completely
spontaneously, he knew the correct verb usage.  At the same time it was
also indisputable evidence that he somehow gained a grasp of the concept
"recent past."

Pinker postulates the theory that language is a human instinct, that the
capacity for language has evolved with evolution, and that our brain
computes our grammar, syntax, vocabulary.  So I found his book absorbing
and fascinating.

But I came across one sentence in _Yiddish_ (p. 66) that almost threw me
for a loop.  The author discusses the subjunctive construction,  a
construction used to express "counterfactual" situations, "events that
are known to be false but entertained as hypotheticals."  Pinker then
states that anyone familiar with Yiddish knows "the ultimate riposte to
someone reasoning from improbable premises."  And he quotes in Yiddish
the following saying : "Az der bubbe vot gehat baytzim vot zie geven
mein zayde."

For those uninitiated in the cryptic meaning of "baytzim," let me
translate: "If my grandmother had balls, she would be my grandfather."

The expression itself is well known to me.  I heard it many, many years
ago in Vilne (Lithuania) when I was a very young man.  Indeed, on a
recent occasion, I heard two euphemistic variants.  Mikhl Herzog reports
from his youth in Toronto:  _ven di bobe volt GEHAT (long pause) volt zi
geven a zeyde_;  also _ven di bobe volt gehat redlekh, volt zi geven a
stritkar_ (street car).

Herewith my comments on Pinker's Yiddish sentence:

A.  The co-occurrence of several features reveal the speaker's dialect as
Central ("Polish") Yiddish.

B.  Word analysis:

        1. "Der" (bubbe).  Totally unacceptable in Standard Yiddish.
"Der" is the _masculine_ definite article.  Since the false premise
starts with the implausible "sex change" (<g>) of the grandmother, the
article should naturally be "di"-the _feminine_ definite article in
Yiddish.  The inap- propriate use of "der" nullifies so to speak the
entire counterargument.

The only possible co-occurrence of _der_ and _bobe is encountered in the
dative case in Standard Yiddish, thus:  TSU DER bobe(n).  In the nomina-
tive case _der_ for "bobe" is categorically wrong.

2.  "Bubbe"--This is apparently Polish Yiddish.  The literary form is
"bobe," and so romanized.  Yiddish does not take double consonants, as
Mendelyaner know so well.

3.  "Vot"--  The auxiliary verb _voLt_  belongs here.  The sound of the
consonant /l/ sometimes disappears entirely ("vot"), but in Standard
Yiddish it is "volt."   [ikh volt, du voltst, er/zi volt, mir voltn.]

4.  "Baytzim"--This is Hebrew for eggs and testicles.  Standard romanized
spelling is "beytsim" (baytsim, I believe, is a Polish-Yiddish variant).

Several generations ago words pertaining to certain body parts, or even
clothing, were considered indelicate and not fit for mixed company.  They
were taboo, and one could find them only in dictionaries.  Note the
ellipsis--the long pause--in the first of Mikhl Herzog's examples above
where the intended word is not even spoken at all.  These words have now
lost their shock value, and one finds them in newspapers and family
magazines spelled out and called by their actual anatomical names.  But
in the olden days people resorted to euphemisms or to words in a foreign
or less known language.  Thus the use of Hebrew for testicles was
considered the more "elegant" or more "delicate" way of naming them.

5.  "Zie"--Reflects a tendency to mimic the German spelling of "Sie," a
pattern naturally to avoid.  It should be _zi_..

6.  "Mein"--Ditto.  German spelling.  It should be_ mayn_.

7.  "Zayde"--Standard romanization calls for _zeyde_.

In his Preface Pinker expresses his thanks to a great many people for
their comments, suggestions, and generous advice while the book was still
in manuscript form.   Many of these people were clearly experts in
linguistics. Too bad he saw no need to consult an expert in Yiddish.

Subject: Kreplekh and crepes

For M. Herzog or other etymologists.  Is it farfetched to conjecture
connection between kreplekh (traditional food for 7th day of Tabernacles)
and crepes?

Subject: Sheva Zucker's book compared to Weinreich and Zuckerman/Herbst

Could someone (eg. a teacher) who has seen all three books compare them
wrt to level and comprehensiveness? Does Sheva Zucker's book really add
something to Weinreich (for someone who's comfortable with "Objects of
prepositions take the dative case")?

It certainly is a tempting book. With a tempting offer from
Stephen to boot.

To Khayem: suggestions for your list (a very good idea, btw):
- Birnbaums "Grammatik der Jiddischen Sprache" (the german version
  isn't very useful to most here of course, but I understand
  there's an english version from Toronto).
- Add some reading material: I found "Yidishe kinder giml" very
  useful for example (even if mayne kinderyorn are far away).
- Add the main dictionaries.
- Add some audio sources (radio programmes, tapes, films).

A wouldn't mind a comparison of the two grammars either (Katz & above). I
want to order one, but don't know which one.

As for Leybl's suggestions to organize periodic lessons: GREAT!

Subject: Yiddish/Hebrew Word Processing

I believe the word processor NISUS can handle right-to-left printing. You
also have to get a Yiddish typeface, of course; I believe there's one
called Perele, and a Hebrew one called Shalom.

I don't know where these can be bought, although you might try YIVO, Der
Arbeter Ring, the ads in Der Forvets, etc, etc.
