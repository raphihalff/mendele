Subject: The disparaging of Yiddish by Jews

Articles in a local UJA (United Jewish Appeal) newsletter sent to my home
recently make me sad about how much Jews routinely and casually
contribute to the disparaging way Yiddish is perceived.

Profiles of two Washington area UJA activists included photos and some
personal comments about each of them, including: favorite food and
"favorite Yiddish expression."  Given their ages and the general state of
Yiddish literacy in our community, it's likely that neither of them is a
native Yiddish speaker, or even understands more than a smattering of
Yiddish.  In fact, it's a fair bet that, as community activists, they
probably are much more familiar with Hebrew than Yiddish.

Why then cite their "favorite Yiddish expression," rather than their
favorite Hebrew (or English) expression?  My cynical view is that it
makes them sound more "heymish," connected to Jewish tradition, warmer
than the impersonal Jewish Internal Revenue solicitors that UJA
fundraisers are accused of being.

So what did they choose?  One chose the word "pushka"; the other: "Svayir
suit sain i yid" (sic), fortunately translated as "It's hard to be a
Jew."

In my opinion,the choice of "pushke" was a cheap transparent segue to
UJA's main role.  I guess the business of business is business....

But my real outrage came from the mangled, shamelessly misspelled phrase,
shver tsu zayn a yid.  Clearly neither the gentlemen cited, nor the
editors of the newsletter, gave any thought to the fact that Yiddish
might have spelling rules.  I'm not asking for YIVO standard here; I'm
simply saying that their version is virtually unrecognizable as Yiddish
except in context.

I can just imagine the conversation between editor and honoree, (if it
occurred at all): "Oh, go ahead, spell it any way you like.  You know
that there are no rules about Yiddish."

Furthermore, I believe that both the decision to include "favorite
Yiddish expressions, and the selections chosen, were simply cutesy,
convenient vehicles to make a "soft pitch."  From Salo Baron's
"lachrymose approach Jewish history," it's an easy move to the "nostalgia
through ignorance" approach to Yiddish.

Although I have strong (admittedly irrational) feelings about Yiddish, I
do not expect all my fellow Jews to treat Yiddish as either a "holy
tongue" or as a fragile heirloom to be handled only with the greatest
care and delicacy.  I do however ask that others, _especially_ fellow
Jews, treat Yiddish with the same respect afforded to any other language.

Note that my intention here is not to criticize the UJA in any way except
editorially; Mendele is not the place for such discussions.
