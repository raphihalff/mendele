Subject: Introduction

I am very new to Mendele and I cannot tell you how happy I am to have
accidentally run into this mailing through a good friend in Australia,
Marvin Feldman. I have read with great interest, a letter from Jeff
Neiman of Toronto, Canada, for I too, am the child of immigrants who
spoke only Yiddish in the home and also their native Russiaqn to each
other. I grew up in Los Angeles, California speaking Yiddish as my
primary language at home. However, as years went by and I left home, I
lost the use of the Mother Lanuguge as did Mr. Neiman. Now, thanks to
Mendele, which I am using as a re-learning tool, I am beginning to
recall words and phrases that have long been forgotten and it warms my
heart to read things that have so long been stored away in the far
distant recesses of my memories.

I regret that I have no contribution to make to the many brilliant
writings that I have read in Mendele, but I am reading them all with
great enthusiasm and really appreciate having the use of this wonderful
service. Here in Albuquerque, we have a new organization which is called
the Yiddish Cultural Association of which I am a member. We strive to
keep the old traditions alive with promoting the use of Yiddish. Mendele
has proven a valuable addition to this cause, as I have been sharing it
with all of them.

I am 66 years old and a retired electrical engineer. My parents were
from Russia and came here to the USA in the late 1920's to escape the
pogroms. Thank you again, for giving me the opportunity to participate,
even if only in a simple way.

Subject: Tautology/pleonasms

tautology or pleonasm?  I wonder if yiddish has a word like german
"doppelgemoppel"  How about "topl-shmopl" or "topl-tepl"--unless the
elements add up to three or more?

regarding pleonasms in yiddish, there are the double synonym names like
"ari-leyb" or "tsvi-hersh"--if I recall correctly, weinreich lists a few
of them in his history.

ultimately, however, there are the intrinsic structural pleonasms that
most languages use to reenforce grammar.  e.g. in italian:  "la bella
rosa" (the beautiful rose), the "a"-ending keeps confirming the fact
that this is a feminine singular--not necessary but required (like cases
and genders altogether).  similarly the double negative in the romance
and slavic languages (and viennese german) and in yiddish is generally
unnessary but required. it is as pleonastic as what is called a
pleonastic "non-negating negative" (french:  "j'attends qu'il ne vienne"
(i'm waiting till he comes"--the "ne" is no negation" (yiddish has a
similar usage)

in regard to case endings yiddish employs some pleonasms, e.g. "der
guter shrayber":  the "er" endings of the article and the adjective are
"unnecessary but required";  same in "di gute mame".

one major difference between english and a host of other european
languages including yiddish is that english hates plurals and tries to
avoid them where possible, especially in a noun modifying another word:

"ten feet long" but "a ten-_foot_-pole"
a "bookcase" (i'm sure the case has more than one book)
a "letter carrier" (i'm sure he carries more than one letter)
(but: "schools chancellor")

in yiddish, however, as often in german, the modifying noun is in the
plural:  "der bikhershank"--and even "der brivn-treger":  even though
the plural of "briv" is "briv" (a null plural) yiddish speakers felt
obligated to create a new plural for the compound.  depending on a
linguist's approach, such plurals might be deemed "unnecessary but
required."

I notice that many recent yidish neologisms that may have been coined
under english influence likewise keep the modifying noun in the
singular: "klang-bavornt" (sound-proof)--i'm sure that something that's
sound-proof keeps out more than one sound or "klang".

but then again, we're faced with the following traditional yiddish
synonyms for "childhood":  "di kindshaft" (perhaps because it refers to
only a single life) but "mayne kinderyorn"--even though it definitely
refers to a single life, unless you use some plural context: "zeyre
kinderyorn".

the reverse is true of, say, body parts in english and yiddish:

yiddish: ale hobn zikh geribn di noz (singular: one to a customer) but
english: they all rubbed their noses.

should we call the english plural in this usage "pleonastic" since it's
unnecessary but required?

my point is that the concept of "pleonastic" is buried deep within the
gestalt of any language and may not even feel tautological.

yiddish takes over hebrew/aramaic words with the article and then adds
the yiddish article.... and words going way back to arabic are taken
over by various languages, whose speakers don't realize that "al" is the
definite article:  the alchemy of medieval italy, but "the chemistry of
their first meeting" (same root), the alcohol content, the algebra
lesson, etc..... (dont forget alcatraz and alhambra).

and by the way, speaking of Arabic, English usage prefers "the Sahara"
to "the Sahara Desert"since "Sahara" means "desert" in Arabic. what is
the standard usage in Yiddish?

Joachim Neugroschel

p.s. my favorite yiddish pleonasm: "avade un avade".

Subject: Tautologies

My thanks to all the Mendelnikes who sent in items to add to my
collection. My special thanks to Reb Refoyl Finkel, who sent me direct
the best one of all: "k'doyme azelkhe". As to whether it's tautology or
pleonasm, well, actually it's mamesh a six of one and half dozen of
another memoneshekh; makhtese whatever turns you on.

All right, those don't count, but I have remembered a couple of others:
"finster khoyshekh" is one and "grober yungatsh" which I have heard
exactly twice, both times from women (not to me, khas v'sholom),
another. Finally, on Simkhes Toyre when everyone gets an aliya, I have
heard the guy calling us all up give one to himself, not as Ployni ben
Ployni" but as "Ikh mikh alayn".

Nokhemol a groysn dank,

Mechl Asheri
