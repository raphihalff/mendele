Subject: Philologus: a case study in _farmishn di yoytsres_

Dear Philologus,

Reyshis: Some months ago, Eliyohu (or, as I think he prefers, Eliyuhi
Juni) gave us an eloquent explanation of the Yiddish expression _farmishn
di yoytsres_ (in my version, _fardreyen di yoytsres_). Now, in your
column of 9/22, you have provided an equally eloquent example of the
process. Let me explain.

On January 21 1916 (sic!!), the New York daily, _Der morgn zhurnal_,
reporting on the introduction of a course in _yidish_ at Columbia
University (yes, that early), felt compelled to explain to its readers
the use of the term _yidish_ in reference to the language and its
literature, a term which it claims was hardly in use two decades earlier
as a designation for "_undzer mame-loshn_", better known as "_zhargon_",
a term first protested as derogatory probably only after the ideological
controversies of the 1908 Czernowitz conference.

Note the date: 1916! Sholem Aleichem died in 1916. In his own epithet, he
refers to himself, surely not disparagingly, as _a zhargonisher
shrayber_.

In other words, for a period of time, for whatever reason, the language
we call "Yiddish" (which many of us innocently called "Jewish" for the
longest time) was called "_zhargon_", perhaps by those you refer to as
"Eastern European intellectuals who looked down upon it" but, _more
important, and not disparagingly_ by its own speakers, its writers, and
literati; not "_a zhargon_" and not "jargon", but "_zhargon_". A girl
named "Rose" is not thought to be "a rose", nor is she necessarily
_sheyn_ if she's called _sheyne sheyndl_. Right?

Read Max Weinreich's _History of Yiddish_ on the "Names of Yiddish" but,
caution: I think the translators mistakenly and confusedly keep rendering
the Yiddish word _zhargon_ as English "Jargon", one of a number of errors
that merit correction in view of the news imparted by Zellig Bach that
YIVO is going to publish a translation of the remaining volumes of
Weinreich's work. The translation should be carefully combed for such
infelicities. (And, in view of the revelation that it's Reb Zellig's
generosity that makes this publication possible, a heartfelt _yasher-
koyekh_ to him.)

Finally, on your assertion that "jargons" are "what linguists call fusion
languages", I'd be grateful for any documentation you may have for the
use of the term "fusion language" by linguists, other than Max Weinreich
with respect to Yiddish.

Wishing you a _gut un gezunt yor_.

Mikhl Herzog

Subject: Interesting ambiguity of a Yiddish word

Az a mentsh iz a bisl genit af khotsh tsvey leshoynes ken men dershatsn
az iberzetsn eyn loshn af an andern iz take shver, ober oykh pedagogish,
voyl dertsierish.  Tsum bayshpil: dos Yidish vort _kukvinkl_ meg hobn
kimat di zelbe meynung vos hot der English oysdruk _point of view_, ober
men ken dershpirn an ander min gefil.

Translation:

If a person is somewhat experienced in at least two languages, he or she
can appreciate that translating one language into another is difficult
but also rather educational.  For example: the Yiddish word _kukvinkl_
may have practically the same meaning as the English expression _point of
view_ but one senses another kind of feeling.

Let me speculate further in English:

A point has no dimensions, its position is undefined, and because it has
no dimensions it has no boundaries.  As to the English expression, a
conceivable boundary is the skin of the person seeing from that _point of
view_.  He or she is unbound, free and clear to shift positions.

Kukvinkl stems from two Yiddish words: kuk meaning look, and vinkl
meaning corner.  A person with a _kukvinkl_ seems to be looking things
over from her or his position in a corner.  A corner presumably has two
boundaries that meet where the person is.  He or she is seeing the world
(or just the room) at leisure, comfortably positioned, snugly ensconced
in the corner. That is one way of sensing the compound word.  However,
there is an ambiguity raising interesting tension.  Is the person in the
corner not at all comfortable, but feeling backed into that corner?
Hasn't the Jewish experience backed Jews into rather uncomfortable
strictures from time to time.  Naturally, I don't know if the latter is
what inspired evolution of the word _kukvinkl_, but I can't help
wondering.  In any case ambiguity makes for added interest, and sharply
differentiates the Yiddish word from the English expression.

I love both the English and the Yiddish equivalent.  I'd love to be able
to fully translate one into the other.  Is it possible?

Subject: "A Sukele" (A Sikele)

There is a version of this song, sung by Fishel Beigel, on the recording
"Heymishe Yiddishe Gezangen," also called, in English, "Yiddish Classics,
Volume One."  (There is a Volume Two, as well.)  The recordings, on
cassette and CD, are produced by Suki and Ding, and are widely available
in Judaica stores.  The production, as with many of the current
recordings from the Orthodox community, uses a lot of synthesized sounds,
and the singing is _very_ heymish, if you get my drift.  It may be an
acquired taste for some, but I _love_ these recordings.
