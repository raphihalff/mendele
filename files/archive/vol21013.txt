Subject: farsmalyet

The word you ask about is probably "farsmalyet," which means "scorched."
The expression was commonly used in cooking (referring to searing meat),
and the author Tsvi Eisenman published a short-story collection called
"Bleter fun a farsmalyetn pinkes" (Pages from a Scorched Record Book),
which I translated and published.

Subject: farshmayet

If you look in Uriel Weinreich's dictionary, you will find that
"farshmayet" means busy, bustling.  In the English section you will also
find it under "busy."

Subject: farshmalyet/shibelnitse

"Farshmalyet" is a variant of "farsmalyet" (Harkavy) meaning singed or
burnt.
As for "Shibelnitse," referring to tall buildings, I wonder if the
derivation is from the Russian verb "shiebel" and its own derivative
"shiebelnit," meaning to rouse, to stir-up, applied to buildings that soar
into the sky.

Subject: farshmalyet/shibiltnise

I am happy to answer Jan Jonk:

"shibilnitse" is a word in Ukrainian, means a window pane

"farshmalyet" means dirty as a result of long use, rarely or never washed,
being in contact with grease, as an example - work clothes of a garage
mechanic

Subject: kolbatshikes/naberdikes/kutatshkelekh

I am in the process of editing the Byten Yizkor Book and have come across
several words related to horses that I can't find anywhere. Perhaps the
Mendelists can help.

 1) kolbatshikes
 2) naberdikes
 3) kutatsheklekh (some sort of decoration hung on the horse collars)

The context: fun farsheydne erter kumen on rimers un hengen aroys khomotes
mit kolbatshikes un naberdikes. Di khomotes zenen oysgeputst mit
kutasheklekh un tsatskes, loytn geshmak fun di goyish koynim.

A dank in foroys,

Subject: age of Yiddish

We frequently hear that Yiddish is a thousand years old. The reality is
actually more interesting and more impressive. Yiddish is well documented
as a written language after about 1400 but that time it had already
existed for about a thousand years. I sketch the early developments in the
language in my latest post at www.gothicyiddish.blogspot.com
