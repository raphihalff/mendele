I forgot to add in my previous posting that I enjoy Reyzl's
discourses, and would not discourage her from sending in long
postings.

reyzl, thanks--that was FASCINATING! one trivial little free
association: a few years ago i was in israel in mid-winter and
poinsettias were all the rage there. i found it really jarring at
first until i realized i'd endowed these tropical euphorbias with
the semiotics of christmas!

to reyzl:

my vote is a resounding no, you do NOT need to learn how to write
shorter postings!!! please keep up the type you've been doing!

Subject: Pseudonymity

I may be opening a can of worms, Pandora's chemidan, - or nothing at
all, but I propose that you  publish the following (you will see
why) strictly pseudonymously - under the pseudonym Alef Shtumer (not
to be confused with Lamed Shapiro).

Slobodjanskj has indeed given pseudonymity a bad name, some of you
finding not just Slobo but all the pseudonmymous irresponsible,
immoral, repulsive, and unnecessary. Reyzl K-W, and, earlier, David
Miller said something about  Yiddish pseudonyms, who used them and
why. Reyzl gives one cheer for pseudonymity; let me raise her to
two.

Mendele is not (just ?) a scientific journal, or - kholile ! - a
'journal of record'. Literary people, musicians, etc in many
traditions wrote and write pseudonymously, and anonymously. For good
reasons.  (See Kalifowicz-Waletzky and Miller for several.) Many
writers have reviewed themselves pseudonymously, and anonymously,
the pseudonyms being more and less transparent to the meyvens.
Someone told me last week that the Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid
rushed  into print six anonymous reviews of a collection of his
poems  then  about to come out.The poems were good, he must have had
interesting things to say in his reviews of them, and they would
have helped to advance his embattled career. For Mendelniks with
unused multiple Yiddish literary personalities, sheydim, alter egos,
second skins, etc, I for one would like to hear from, e.g., An
Andere Akhed Haam, Di Makhetey Nister, Khas & Sholem (the Yiddish
Penn and Teller), et al., if the shames is willing to entertain
their communications, and vice versa.

Or are we now beyond all this?

Sincerely,

Alef Shtumer

PS . Miriam Halkin's note suggests the fascinating picture of Lingua
Franca or whoever having their house 'Witch' of Endor call up the
ghost of the late Mrs Halkin to discover the 'true' identity of
Philologus. This, I learn from the last Mendele bulletins, is no
longer necessary. Halkin's dekl iz gut geblozn. Too bad. It's lucky
the National Enquirer isn't interested in Yiddish."

Subject: Memorial to Peretz Miransky

It is with deep sadness that I present here a memorial to the
Yiddish poet Peretz Miransky who passed away on Saturday, July 10,
1993. He was one of the two remaining intellectuals of Yung Vilna
(the other is A. Sutzkever who is living in Israel). Yung Vilna was
a famous group of poets and writers that flourished in Lithuania
before the Shoah. Miransky was the holder of many awards for his
poetry and fables. I have chosen to present here his poem "Main
Tatns Nign" followed by my translation into English. I was proud and
honoured to have worked with Miransky and to set some of his poems
to music.

Main Tatns Nign

(My Father's Chant) by Peretz Miransky

	main tatns nign fun fartogn / geit alts mir nokh mit frume
trit. / di psukim vortslen in zikorn, / nor s'zingt der nign in
gemit P a nign bloiz, nor sara khidesh, / er vert fun yorn nit
farblast, / ikh hob main mame-loshn yidish / tsum tatns nign
tsugepast. un s'zingen zikh di yidish-verter / azoy mir lib, azoy
mir voil, / punkt vi amol, an oisgetrerter, / der t'hilim in main
tatns moil. der zelber troyeriker nign, / der zelber betndiker ruf,
er flegt amol mikh zis farvign, / haint vekt er mikh fun kholem uf.
tsi veln maine kinder hern / dem nign, ven ikh vel avek? / der sofek
ruft zikh op mit trern, / di trern leshn nit main shrek. nor kh'brum
main tatns altn nign, / derkumendik tsu main fargein. / der nign vet
mikh shtil farvign / un blaibn af main keiver shtein.

Translation by Gurion Hyman

	My father's chant in early morning / still follows me with
pious steps. / The phrases rooted in my mem'ry, / but in my spirit
sings his chant P It's just a chant, but what a wonder, / the years
have still not bleached it pale, / I set my mother-tongue, my
Yiddish, / to my father's melody. And how they sing, my Yiddish
words, beloved, and wonderful, to me, / just as when, all filled
with tears, / the Psalms were in my father's mouth. The same sad
chanting, full of sorrow, / the same sad, yearning, pleading call, /
it used to rock my cradle sweetly, / today it wakes me from my
dream. Yet will my children ever hear it, / the melody when I am
gone? / My doubts respond with tears, / the tears can never quench
my fear. But still I hum my father's nign, / as I approach my last
dim days. / And then the quiet chant will rock me, and, silent, rest
on my grave stone.

self-addressed stamped envelope with a note and I'll send it along:
