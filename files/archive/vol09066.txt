Subject: Az and Vos

I'm a linguist working on Germanic languages with special reference to
Yiddish and interested in the distribution of "az" and "vos," subordinate
conjunctions introducing complement clauses just like English "that."  In
particular, my interest is in the question as to which of these two words
speakers of the language will use in what contexts.

I'd be very grateful if those subscribers who consider themselves native in
Yiddish would tell me which should go with the underlined part of the
following sentences, "az" or "vos" or both.  Please send your answers to me
at ytanaka@babel.ling.upenn.edu.  A hartsikn dank!

(1) Ikh frey zikh ___ zi hot mir dertseylt vegn ire khaveyrim in ir letstn
briv.
(2) Ikh veys ___ di Vilner manshaft hot zeyer oft gevunen dos letste yor.
(3) Ikh meyn ___ di fusbol-manshaft fun Vilne hot geshpilt kegn Varshe

(5) Ikh hob kharote ___ di fusbol-manshaft fun Vilner hot farloyrn nekhtn.

Subject: opatoshu

Since the response to my inquiry about an Index to the works of Sholem
Aleykhem was exactly what I was looking for, I shall pose the same question
regarding Yosef Opatoshu: whether anyone is aware of a master Index to his
writings, in Yiddish and perhaps in translation. I know that all of his
stories are not in his "Ale Verk fun Yosef Opatoshu." (Vilne, 1926, 10
band), and some of those volumes don't even have a table of contents, let
alone an index to all ten volumes.  Can anyone help?

By the way, it may interest other Mendelyaners to know that Louis
Fridhandler has compiled a magnificent Index to Sholem Aleykhem's stories,
including English translations. He is fine-tuning it at present, and when it
is completed he will no doubt announce how it may be accessed.

Subject: Bayke, Balte, Dayke

Regarding Lori Cahan-Simon's post on Mendele 09.061 perhaps I can solve at
least one of her questions. Bayke is a russian word which means a simple
dress or a piece of coarse fabric. I have not found the meaning of Balte,
but in russian it is one of the names of Scandinavia. Finally, no hint about
Dayke.

By the way: there is a superb "a capella" version of the aforementioned song
recorded by the Hazamir Jewish Choir of Helsinki, Finland. The name of the
CD is: "Der Rebe Elimelech". Don't miss it!

Subject: bayke

Lorele Cahan-Simon asks what is bayke.  The word comes from Polish: bajka.
It means fairy tale. I think it has also a yiddish (hebrew) synonim Mushl
(from hebrew Mashal)

Here is the citation for the Yiddish edition of the book on Yiddish in the
Yishuv, mentioned by Mikhl Herzog (09.061):

Subject: Yiddish sources on Jewish and Gypsy musicians

I recently received a query about the circumstances under which Jewish and
Romani (i.e., Gypsy) musicians worked together, primarily in Hungarian and
Transylvanian lands but also in Eastern Europe more generally.  While
there is no question that Klezmorim and Romani musicians gigged together
a great deal and had substantial mutual influence, I am not aware of any
specific sources that address this.  Is the Collective Mendelyaner Wisdom
aware of, say, any Yiddish sources or memoirs that deal with this issue
specifically?

Please reply privately.

A dank in faroys,

Jonathan Bellman

Subject: request for information - vilner baale-besl

tayere fraynde!

it is a great joy - a groyse simche - even for an illeterate of yiddish like
me, to partecipate to this new yiddishland which is Mendele, and first of
all I wish to deeply thank the people who, thanks to their work and
dedition, make it possible.

And now I wish to take advantage of this marvellous posisblity and to ask
for advise. Since, many years ago, in Oxford, I saw for the first time
Overture to Glory (Dos Vilner shtodt-khazn) I was fascinated with the figure
of the baale-besl. Does someone of the Mendele readers and contributors know
more about him? I was able only to find two pages about him in Idelsohn's
"Jewish Music". What fascinates me is not only his fiction-like and tragic
life, but also his artistic connection with the Polish world. I will be very
glad of any information.

A dank in faroys!
