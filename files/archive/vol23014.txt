Call for Submissions

The Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, MA, is seeking submissions for the 2014 Translation Issue of the “PaknTreger,” a digital edition of the Yiddish Book Center's magazine devoted specifically to works of Yiddish literary translation into English.

-Guidelines for Submission-
Submissions can be translations of any genre of Yiddish literature, including but not limited to poetry, prose, drama, memoir and “belles lettres.” Submissions should be no more than 5,000 words in length and should include a short introduction (approximately 150 words) providing essential historical, literary, and biographical context. The translator's name and contact information must be on each page of the submission. 

Translators whose pieces are selected for publication will receive $100 for their work. Please note that translators are responsible for securing the rights to translate the work and publish their translation. 

The deadline for submission is January 15th, 2014.

-Taytsh.org-
Translators are also encouraged to register for the Center's dynamic new online resource for Yiddish-to-English translators, available now at www.taytsh.org. On this site, translators can upload their works in progress for commentary and annotation, and access a wide range of community-enabled bibliographic and lexical resources.

Questions or submissions can be sent to translationissue@bikher.org.

Date: November 25
Subject: Ovntlid

In Response to Hirsh Perloff’s response to Helene B Katz's query about “Oventlid”:

Dictionaries translate butterfly as zumer-feygele, but also as flaterl and moth as mot or mol, so there is some variation when it comes to these species of insects.  I know in Danish it is also sommerfugl, and the name for moth in Danish is either moel or natsvaermer (literally nightswarmer) also known as just svaermer, which can also mean dreamer/visionary in Danish.  I, for one, have seen butterflies active at dusk if it is warm enough and if there are enough flowers that offer nectar.
So ruling out a butterfly because Manger is writing about evening is perhaps a little
premature.

Thanks,
Bernard Brasen
