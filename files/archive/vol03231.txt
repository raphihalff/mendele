Subject: Introduction

Sam Paley directs the Judaic Studies Program at SUNY Buffalo.
Although a field archaeologist working in Israel and Turkey, he has
a general interest in what Mendele is doing and will pass on
relevant info of use to his adjuncts (JDS at Buffalo is the director
and a crew of adjuncts). So I am happy to be here. All the best,

SMP

Subject: re: Schindler's List

Hershel Berman:

Hi. I'm probably responding in the middle of a long conversation
about "Schindler's List", and so if my comment has already been
addressed, sorry.

I was just interested in your comments about Jews during the
Holocaust not helping other Jews.  From stories that I have heard
from family survivors and from what I know about human nature and
survival instincts, I'm not sure that those scenes in the movie were
*so* unbelievable. I think that it is certainly important to
acknowledge the horror of the holocaust for what it was, but we need
to be careful not to create superhuman images of what were regular
Jewish people.  That is to say that in a sense I think people tend
to "idolize" (for lack of a better word, and a less grotesque
sounding one) the Holocaust.

Subject: Yiddish Pen Pals for Language Class

Steve Silbert:

Regarding your zeyde, I have some second year Yiddish students who
are quite advanced for 4th semester Yiddish. Since their first
semester we have written and received letters in Yiddish from some
"real live" Yiddish speakers and some from ficticious senders
(namely me, the instructor with some Yiddish alias, Soreh, Rokhl,
Moyshe, Zalman).  So, since I think letters and pen pals are a great
way to teach/learn some language....maybe your zeyde would be
interested in pen palling with my class...? I'm willing to assign
them each a brivele to send him...do you think he'd be into that?

Subject: A por verter

First, I think we might be wandering just a bit too far with
our discussions of genes, diseases, etc.  Maybe a moratorium?
It's not as though there's nothing left to say about Yiddish..  So
with your consent Mendele will hold back any further posts on such
matters.

Second, thanks to the new subscribers to Mendele who have
introduced themselves and a warm invitation to those who
haven't yet to do so soon.

Third, the shames will be editing Mendele from a laptop for
the next four weeks--and from a considerable distance at
that.  Whatever problems are already present in a slow
mainframe may very well get worse.  Subscribers are there-
fore respectfully reminded that Subject: lines and signa-
tures will be required.  Thanks for your cooperation.

Finally, many thanks to Molly Diesing as well as to Terry Langendoen
of the University of Arizona for making possible a guest account.
Internet schnorring lives on and a good thing too, else where would
Mendele be?

Zayt mir alle gezunt,

Noyekh
