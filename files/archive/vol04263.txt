Subject: Heymishe khasene

Andrew Cassel  asked for the meaning  of a few phrases  in Yiddish and
alas I cannot help with them.  Towards the end he asked:

>* four words I in (I presume) Hebrew, spelled: kof-lamed,
>daled-kof-fey-vov-nun, yud-vov-tof-alef, vov-yud-alef-kof-lamed.

Actually it is not  in Hebrew but in Aramaic, and it  is a phrase used
during  the Seder  service  (in sefardi  pronunciation): "kol  dikhfin
yetei veyekhol", every hungry one  should come and eat.  Sometimes one
uses just  the first two  words "kol  dikhfin" for everyone  who needs
some help, thus fitting the original Yiddish phrase "fray far alemen".

Subject: Heymishe khasene

Andrew Cassel's four words are: kol dikhfin yete ve-yekhol and are
actually in Aramaic and are taken from the beginning of the hagode, from
the paragraph which begins: Ha lakhma anya. They mean: let all who are
hungry come and eat.

Subject: Litve

I am astounded by the discussion of the status of the Jews of White
Russia. My mothe was from  Brest-Litovsk, and always spoke of herself as
a Litvak. Can it be that she was mistaken, or is there some sort of
particularism surfacing here?

Subject: Verbs in -nen

Dovid Braun:

Some random comments on your posting of December 29:

1. Without a better understanding of the etymology of "dav(e)nen", we
can't be sure whether the variants "davnen/davenen" are the result of
epenthesis or syncope.

2. In any event, it's probably not productive to group "davenen", THE
universal form in ALL of Southern Yiddish with "lerenen", at most, an
occasional variant.

3. The phenomenon you're interested in is NOT restricted to verb stems in
/n/; to wit, hargenen, daygenen, eytsenen, paskenen, darshenen, etc.

4. Still, of the verbs just cited, "paskenen" (and, perhaps, "darshenen")
can actually be said to have two stems, as evidenced by the third person
variants: "pasket" and "pasknt", "darshet" (Dutch Yiddish "darsht"!)and
"darshnt" (?).

5. Unlike the Litvish preference for the variant "davnen", in contrast to
SY "davEnen", Litvish says "leyEnen", in contrast to Central Yiddish
"laynen".

6. Although "ley(e)nen" is an "n-stem" today (always "ikh leyen/layen",
by the way (never *layn), it is not an "n-stem" historically; 3rd person
"ley-t/ley-en"--no thematic "n". Descriptively, we can speak of the
further inflection of the plural to yield the pleonastic
plural/infinitive "leyen-en".

7. This doesn't seem to be much different from the process of further
inflecting inflected forms to yield words like "vemen(en)", "alemen",
even "beydemen".

8. I have recorded the Central Yiddish forms "nayenen" 'to sew', "es
shnayent" 'it's snowing', and "zikh unti:nen" 'to get dressed' (in the
sentence "ints tinen mer zekh azoy nisht un").

9. In my study of Markuze's _Seyfer Refues_ of 1790, (Columbia MA Essay,
1960), I tried to explain the origin of this phenomenon as a consequence
of contact between Yiddish "n-dropping" and "n- preserving" dialects. I
won't have access to a copy till late next week to see whether I still
stand by what I wrote then.

Happy New Year.

Subject: Etiquette

In Mendele 4.261 Daniella HarPaz has brought up the issue of etiquette on
this list. I, for one, echo her sentiments. In German there is a word
"Herzenstakt" the courtesy of the heart, which is based not on a code of
manners or etiquette, but on the basic consideration for others'
feelings. I am shocked, yes, shocked, at the nastiness of some of the
curt messages "correcting" information in others' postings.

I've discussed this off-line, and someone justified this saying they
didn't want to be long-winded. When you consider how many more keyboard
strokes it would take to add the sentiments of courtesy and consideration
to some messages, I don't think Daniella, or I, or anyone else, for that
matter, if they think about it, would feel it was too much to ask and
would welcome a little more "long-windedness". I fear, though, that some
people may not know how to respond diplomatically. There are some people
who thrive on all-out lambasting. I don't think, though, that they
represent the majority. Daniella has done us a great favor by bringing
this up. I hope others will join me in saying, "What a relief, I thought
I was the only one who felt this way".

Subject: Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen [!]

The January/February 1995 issue of Congress Monthly has the following
article, which may be of interest to some of our more musically inclined
Mendelnikes:

"The Curious History of 'Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen'," by Marvin Caplan (pp.
13-16).  Mr. Caplan is a Washington-based writer who is working on a
series of articles devoted to great Yiddish songs.

This song has been discussed previously on Mendele, and I thought it
would be a good idea to add to the discussion by mentioning this latest
treatment.

The same issue of Congress Monthly has an article about the An-sky
expedition exhibit, currently on (until early March) at the Jewish
Museum, in New York:  "S. An-sky:  Preserver of Russian Jewish Memory,"
by Mark W. Kiel (pp. 16-17).  Mark Kiel is a congregational rabbi who has
a doctorate in Jewish history, as well as impeccable Yiddish credentials.
(His father is the writer Khonon Kiel.)
