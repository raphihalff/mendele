Noyekh:   Too much to deal with af eyn fus. Just note: the
suffix in rebitsn is NOT the same as the -in of lererin.
It's probably not Germanic. Note also the -tsn forms of a
number of Yiddish verbs of limited distribution:

As   for -te: it's Aramaic and in a number of words is
"redundant". So. tsadik--tsadeykes--tsadeykeste. There's
probably a stylistic difference between say, shkheyne and
shokhnte; some would say that the latter is more
"yidishlekh" In the case of khaveyre and khaverte there may
even be an ideological distinct- ion: members of the
Pioneer Women address one another as khaveyre; in the
Arbeter-Ring it's khaverte. The -ke suffix is surely Slavic
IN THE MAIN. Bit, don't write off the possibili ty of
Northern German at some point.

To add to your puzzles: Ber's wife is known as di berikhe;
Leyb's wife is di leybikhe; Menashe der royfe has a wife
known as Menashekhe di royfete; what would she be called if
she were a royfe in her own right. What about di
shoykhetke? Can a woman be a shoykhet in her own right?
What would we call her? Would you buy "Der doktor iz shoyn
do; zi vil mit aykh redn". How about Der professor heyst
Ellen Prince? As for the -nitse items: the gem is
"mefunitse".

A small note on the "ke" suffix.

Constructions like the nextdoorike are standard for
ghettoized yordim [ex-Israelis], even those who have no
[other] Yiddish.  So this is New World Hebrew [too?].
