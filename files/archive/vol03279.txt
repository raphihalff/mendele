Subject: Re: No KlezKamp

The 10th Annual KlezKamp will happen this year from December
25-30,1994 under its new parent organization, "Living Traditions".

After 9 years under the sponsorship of the YIVO, KlezKamp has gone
independent.  YIVO's emphasis on library and archives and its
pending move to a new location and KlezKamp's growth as a
performance oriented event meant that this was a good time to seek
new sponsorship. To that end we founded "Living Traditions"  so that
KlezKamp -- and other new programs and projects -- could be
sponsored by it.

To the over 2,500 people who have come to KlezKamp over the last 9
years, look for a membership mailing coming in the next few weeks.
To anyone who wants to be on our list send your address to me at
sapoznik@aol.com or to our new offices: Living Traditions/KlezKamp
430 W.14th St #514 NYC 10014.

Subject: jewish names

there is information on the spelling and hence by implication the
pronunciation of Yiddish names in rabbinic writers dealing with
correct divorce formulas, e.g., Bet Shemuel on Shulhan Aruk, Even
ha-ezer 129, Lebush in his equivalent of Even ha-Ezer 129.

Subject: Various

[Purim song]
	The text that Dvosye Bilik asked about on behalf of Miriam
Isaacs (a hartsikn grus!) seems to be the one included as #545 in
the YIVO edition of Y. L. Cahan's _Yidishe folkslider mit melodyes_:

		A gutn purim, malakh!
		Vu ikh gey, fal ikh.
		Di bord iz mir lang,
		dos vayb iz mir krank;
		nemt der tate a fayertop
		un makht der mamen a lokh in kop.
		Zogn di kinderlekh:  oy-oy-oy!
		Zogt der tate:  gut azoy!

[Take]
	Anatole Beck asked about the source of _take_.  It probably
comes from Czech, where _take'_ (acute accent to designate a long e)
means 'also, too' and functions as well as an emphatic particle.

[Chekhov's Jewish musicians]
	The Jewish musicians in _The Cherry Orchard_, cited by Joyce
Rappaport, are called simply "a Jewish orchestra" (_evreiskii
orkestr_).  The ensemble is described as consisting of four violins,
a flute and a bass.

[Homoseksualist]
	David Neal Miller argues by analogy (to _tsienist, bundist_)
that the Yiddish term _homoseksualist_ denotes (or ought to denote)
an advocate of _homoseksualizm_.  Based on another analogy (to
possible sources like Polish _homoseksualista_ or Russian
_gomoseksualist_), I would guess that the term would more likely be
used to refer to what David calls "an ontological state" rather than
"an ideological commitment."

[Kabak]
	The Russian word _kabak_ (diminutive _kabachok_) 'squash' is
indeed of Turkic origin.  The homonym meaning 'tavern' is of unclear
etymology, perhaps from Low German or perhaps from Turkic.  If the
latter is true, one suggested connection is with a squash or gourd
used as a bottle.

	The expression that was first cited, _a moshl kabak_, was
included in one of the "Shprakhvinkl" columns in the _Forverts_ by
the late Wolf Younin.  (Someone should collect his columns, which
started, I believe, in the _Tog_, and publish them; they are a
goldmine of information.)  His column of April 2, 1979 provided
answers to a reader's question:  "Vi drikt men zikh oys oyf eynem
vos redt nit punkt tsu der zakh un misht oys verter un gedanken, vos
hobn keyn shaykhes nit mit dem vos men redt?" Younin listed the
following possibilities:

	 1. Her a moshl!  Vos hot di atereyse tsu der arende?

	 2. Deriber iz vos?  Deriber iz vos?  Deriber geyen di
katshkes borves un gendz -- naket?

	 3. A moshl kegn di nekhtike varenikes -- me redt vegn
veter, kumt zi arayn mit zoyere ugerkes.

	 4. A moshl kegn a torbe fleker!  Mir redn dokh gor fun
hodeven kinder.

	 5. Eyns mitn dritn iz nit keyn mekhitn.

	 6. Vos hot (far a shaykhes) a patsh tsu a gut-shabes?

	 7. Gehert a moshl?  --Az tsibele iz tsibulye [Polish
_cebula_], iz knobl -- knobulye un Gershn iz Mitrofan.

	 8. A naye mayse -- az di shtub iz gel gefarbt, heyst di
kale meyte.

	 9. A moshl kabak.

	10. Iber dem blozt men Homen un me klapt shoyfer -- hert a
moshl.

[Di manse mit Walesa]
	I think it's been pointed out here before, but the nasal
vowel in the second syllable of the Polish president's name has
nothing to do with the nasalization in _manse_, _Yankl_ etc.  In
non-technical terms, Polish has two vowel letters with cedilla- like
diacritics under them that are read (under certain circum- stances)
as nasalized vowels.  The "English" spelling "Walesa" omits the hook
under the "e" and the slash through the "l".

Subject: Introduction

We have finally been able to find our way onto the Internet and of
course Mendele. By way of introduction, we are both active in the
Yiddish community in Melbourne Australia, Bobbi being a Yiddish
teacher at the Sholem Aleichem College and also conducts Yiddish
adult language and literature courses. I am active in the Bund, SKIF
and Yugnt Bund in Melbourne. We are always interested in receiving
information and we are happy to pass on this info. to our community.
I guess something to do with the tyranny of distance.
