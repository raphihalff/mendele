Subject: Trilled 'r'/curses

How widespread is the rolled r in Yiddish?  Is it found in South German
Yiddish as in coterritorial German dialects?  Does it vary regionally in
Eastern Europe?  Re: speech impediment: are some people physically
incapable of rolling their r's or is this merely a question of upbrin-
ging?  I have noticed that a rolled r is common in the Yiddish of
recent immigrants from Eastern Europe.  Is the current high frequency of
the rolled r in this group attributable to interference from the Slavic
tongues or does this reflect authentic traditions?

Another theme.  Yiddish has been a hobby of mine for quite a few years
now, and I _still_ know close to zero Yiddish curses.  I know "gey kakn
afn yam," "kak zikh oys!" and "a shtik drek!"  I also know "a pisher, a
pots, a shmok, a tsatske".  I imagine one can by analogy say "pisht zikh
oys!"  That about completes my knowledge of Yiddish curses.  I have heard
enough "ir zolt vaksn vi a tsvibl mitn kop in d'rerd!"  I want to see
some mamoshesdik shpet-loshn, some real Yiddish vulgarity on a par with
German Scheisse, English sh--, f---, etc.  No hyphens in Yiddish please!

Is Yiddish really such a pristine language?  All shmo and beytsim?  Lozt
hern khevre!  Git (shpet) loshn!

Subject: The [RR] proposal

I greatly appreciate Anno Siegel's comment (4.236,2) about my [RR]
proposal, and fully agree with the logic that the [RR] flag, for  Review
Requested, be published with the text proper and *not* deleted.

No shame attaches to anyone acknowledging, even publicly, that he or she
does not know a language they did not learn, but wish to learn.

The [RR] tag, at the beginning of the message, will serve as a useful
indicator that the text has been reviewed prior to publication, and (I
quote) "would thus make Mendele an even more valuable instrument in
learning (or picking up) some Yiddish."

Subject: Vi got in Frankraykh

Alan Astro asked:

>Also, how German do people feel "gliklekh vi got in frankraykh" is?  Does
>it have real yikhes in Yiddish?

I know that expression (in German, with German spelling) with a minor
difference.  Instead of "gliklekh" it says "lebt".  I took it to refer to
the  comfortable life and good  food of France.  Simply,  leading a
pleasant life.

Subject: Thieves' Latin or Kokhemer loshn

Eve Jochnowitz [Vol. 4.229] asked about _rotwelsch_. My answer may have
been too short. This vernacular of the vagabonds in German lands (similar
idioms must be found in Roman languages and in Anglo-Saxon as well) goes
back to the 13th century. One of the first studying and writing about it
was Martin Luther. Salcia Landmann published in her popular book about
Yiddish a small dictionary of this language, just to show the high
percentage of hebrew and aramaic words in it, of which quite a lot
changed or shifted their meaning. The best source and dictionary of this
language was published by Sigmund Wolff, the author of the dictionary of
Yiddish (just the words of german origin). Besides the oldest name
_rotwelsch_ the language has also a name  that stems from Yiddish:
_kokhemer loshn_, a German name: _kundenschall_ = sound of the
well-informed, and a gipsy name _jenische sprache_ = from the gipsy word
"dsan" - to know. It is this language which served as a canal for quite a
lot of idioms from the Hebrew through the Yiddish or directly into the
colloquial German, like the word Pleite (playte) from the Hebrew "pleyta"
for bankruptcy.

Subject: Hob und bin

Our Yiddish havorah has been discussing the proper use of the verbs hob
and bin for months now -- since many recall using one or the other for
the same verbs in the past tense.  Is there a rule of grammar which
governs here -- or is it purely a dialect variation.  Any help is
appreciated.
