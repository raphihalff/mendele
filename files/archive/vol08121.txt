Subject: Shtetl house

Alla Sokolova (08.105) asks about the words "Zol' - a kind of a sitting
room," and "Uz - a stable."  From Mikhl Herzog's helpful posting (08.108),
we learn that the word zol, in standard form is zal, and that the word uz,
in standard form, is hoyz. 

These two words, zal and hoyz, were discussed during my interviews with a
woman who was born in Ukraine in 1905 and lived in her shtetl until 1919. 
Although she lived in the neighboring Kiev province, not in eastern Podolia,
her experience may be of interest to Ms. Sokolova. 

She defined a zal in her shtetl as a formal living room; in other words, a
parlor, a room in which visitors are received and entertained.  Her poor
family lived in a duplex house, in two rooms-a bedroom and a combined
kitchen and dining area-without a zal, but her grandmother lived in a larger
house that had a zal.  [For the word zal, Weinreich's dictionary gives hall,
auditorium, and parlor (Weinreich, Schocken, 1977).  Harkavy gives saloon,
hall, and parlor (Harkavy,1928)]

The word hoyz had two meanings in her shtetl, as we also learn from Mikhl
Herzog.  One was the whole house, but she called that a shtibl.  The other
meaning was the entry chamber attached to the outside of the house-the
vestibule or foyer. 

The foyer was a large, almost barn-like structure attached to the house,
usually but not always on the long side nearest the street.  It served not
only as the chamber to be entered before opening the door to the interior of
the house proper, but also as a storage area, as the place of entry for both
the cellar and the attic, as a place to keep animals, and, in the houses of
some craftsmen such as shoemakers and tailors, as a work area. 

The floor had the shape of a long rectangle whose short side was wide enough
to allow a peasant to drive his wagon, pulled by one or two horses,
completely inside.  To allow the wagon to enter, the foyer had a large
doorway, a toyer in Yiddish, consisting of a pair of large doors, wide and
tall like barn doors, opening outward into the yard.  In contrast, a person
would usually enter the foyer through a smaller single door, which in some
foyers was separate, but in others was an inset in one of the larger doors. 
The foyer, having no ceiling, was in open communication with the attic of
the one-story house. 

She clearly stated that people in her shtetl called the foyer a hoyz.  She
suggested that a logical word for it would have been forhoyz (because it was
entered first), but nobody ever called it that.  This agrees with Mikhl
Herzog's information that the foyer was called hoyz in some areas but
forhoyz in others.  [Weinreich, for foyer, gives forhoyz, and for forhoyz
gives hall, lobby, antechamber; he does not list vestibule.  Harkavy, for
vestibule, gives forhoyz, and for forhoyz gives lobby, hall; he does not
list foyer.]

Some coachmen kept their horses in a large stable at the center of town,
while others had stables at their houses.  One prosperous coachman's house
was much longer than most houses, and attached to it was a stable sheltering
several horses and coaches.  She did not specifically say that his stable
was the hoyz, so it may not have been the hoyz, but instead an extra
attachment to the house, i.e., the stable may have been attached to the back
of the house, while the hoyz was at the front.  No mention was made of a
hoyz used as a stable, and unfortunately for the present question, I did not
ask whether any hoyz served as a stable for horses.  On the other hand, a
hoyz was so large that it probably could have been used as a horse stable. 

People commonly kept small animals in the hoyz.  Her grandmother kept six
goats in her hoyz.  Although dictionaries differ, one meaning of the word
stable is a building for lodging and feeding domestic animals, which would
include goats.  By that definition, her grandmother's hoyz, with its six
goats, was a stable. Thus,it might not be surprising to hear that in some
other shtetl, the word hoyz was used to mean a stable, although apparently
in her shtetl it was not.

Subject: nitl

It seems to me that nitl cannot be directly derived from a Romance (Latin,
Italian) source because the first vowel would then have 'a' in Yiddish. 
Wexler's proposal, as reported by Mikhl Herzog, that there was a
contamination with Hebrew nitla seems to me a sensible idea.  So the Yiddish
word should be viewed as having two sources, one Romance, the other
Hebrew--probably.

Subject: new movie

Dear Mendelanyers,

Many of you know me as a klezmer, documentary filmmaker who has done a lot
of research in Eastern Europe among the remnant Jewish communities and their
Rom neighbors. Recently I have begun directing my first fiction feature
film...a coming - of - age story about a subway busker who becomes a student
of the "king of the buskers" - our second lead actor. This actor (James Earl
Jones)  plays jazz, classical, and klezmer music. The klezmer music will be
music from the Bukowina region. Bukowina of course being the oblast where
much discussion has taken place here about the 90th anniversary of the
Czernowitz Yiddish conference. Look for the film ("Q.T.") sometime later
this year.  ale mentchen bleibn ruik.....

Subject: "A Meal for the Poor"

There is a short story which appears Irving Howe and Eliezar Greenberg's
book, A Treasury of Yiddish Stories, A Meal for the Poor by Mordechai
Spector.  I need some information about this story: 
        
- The name of this story in Yiddish (the name is different from the name
   that the translator gave it.
- The book that has the original story written in Yiddish.
- Where can I buy, or at least search for this book?

Subject: treyf, sreyfe, etc.

Perhaps someone can help with an etymological puzzle.  I am collecting words
that lost their final vowel in the transition from Hebrew to Yiddish.  For
example, 'treyf' and 'sreyfe' are derived from Hebrew words that are
identical except for the first consonant, but 'treyf' lost its final qometz,
while in 'sreyfe' the vowel was merely reduced.  Does anyone know why?  I
think the female given name 'Hadass' is another example.  (I haven't been
able to find anything about this question in M.  Weinreich or elsewhere.) 
Also, if you know of any more such Hebrew words that lost their final vowel
in Yiddish, I'd like to hear about it. 

Thanks.
