Subject: Introduction

Although I was born in Germany after the war, my formative years from the
age of 2 were spent in Newark, N.J. in a 3-decker neighborhood not all
that dissimilar to the descriptions provided by Philip Roth in some of
his novels. In the 4th grade, the wooden desk that I sat at had the
initials R.S. dug into its surface, which stood for our most famous
graduate at the time - Rod Steiger. My parents are holocaust survivors
from the town of Gombin in Poland and I grew up speaking a rich mixture
of English & Yiddish and often not knowing the difference.  This made
kindergarten a somewhat traumatic experience for me since my young
classmates would sometimes give me quizzical looks when I voiced words
they didn't understand ("Give me a handtuch, please.")

As the years passed my exposure to Yiddish only occurs on visits home to
see family and relatives.  My comprehension remains high, although when I
try to speak I often revert to Deutsch due to many years of studying it
in school.  At a relatively recent Yiddish Film Festival sponsored by the
Yiddish Film Institute at Brandeis University, I found that I could
understand much of what was being said on screen without looking at the
subtitles.  I'm currently working my way through Weinreich's book on
learning Yiddish.  I get a lot of pleasure when visiting my parents in
trying out my Yiddish or eavesdropping on conversations among the truly
fluent at their condominium complex in Florida.

I credit much of my renewed interest in Yiddish to Mendele.  Thanks to
one and all whose participation sustains this electronic journal.

Subject: Irving and Irwin; proverbs

1. Does anyone know what Yiddish name (if there is a direct connection)
   is for "Irving"?  or "Irwin"?

2. A colleague of mine is beginning work on Jewish proverbs (mostly
   Ladino) and would like to do *some* work with Yiddish proverbs.
   I gave him several references to consult, but it is not my forte'...
   Is there a quintessential work on Yiddish proverbs or list that he
   should consult above all others?

a dank in faroys,
Daniella HarPaz

Subject: More on kenen/konen & a personal note

I was out sick last week and had nothing to do but lie in bed and watch
movies. Two I watched were "Mirele Efros" and "Der Dybuk". I was
absolutely astonished; it was as if ear plugs had been taken out of my
ears. I no longer depended on the subtitles; what once sounded like
fonfevate nonsense (which I attributed to the particular movie print used
and the conversion to video) was suddenly fresh and clear. I was able to
detect lots of dialect variations to the point that the movies seemed
artificial, but then I said to myself, Rick, people do move! OK, she's
supposed to be from Grodne and she sounds like a Volinerke, but no one
said where she was born.

At any rate, what I'm trying to say is that the daily exposure to Yiddish
through this list, and my forcing myself periodically to write my
postings in Yiddish has resulted in a significant improvement in my
facility for the language. I was so delighted I wanted to shout it from
the rooftops! I cer- tainly couldn't have done it alone, and I want to
give my most hartsikn dank to my Mendelyaner friends.

Having just read Mikhl's posting on his underestimation of the spread of
konen, everyone in both films said konen. I thought that that might be
one area where the stage pronunciation may have had a normative influence
and required konen; but, if so, why is everyone speaking in their own
dialect? According to recent postings, I was led to believe konen was
isolated to North-East Yiddish. Mikhl's most recent observation seems to
make sense when applied to these movies as cases in point.

Subject: Gender of _emes_

A possible answer to Zishe Carlow's question about the word _emes_.
While Weinreich indicates that _emes_ is masculine gender, as a Hebrew
word it is feminine gender.  Why the change in gender when switching from
Hebrew to Yiddish, I don't know.  When all else fails, I usually pick up
my telephone and call Mordkhe Schaechter.  He always has a good answer!
