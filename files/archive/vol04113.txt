Subject: Introduction

A gutn tog freint.  After "lurking" for the past week or so, I would like
to intoduce myself to the folks on mendele.

I was raised in Los Angeles in a home where Yiddish was, at least for my
early years, the language most used.  (My father is from Vilna and my
mother is from Kovna.)  Unfortunately, now that I am 45 years old what
meager Yiddish skills I was able to acquire at the Workmen's Circle
school at the age of eight have long since withered. I am, however, able
to understand pretty well.

Listening in on the mendele postings this past week has been a true
delight.  There is little I can contribute to discussions about
Romanization of Yiddish or the obscure origins of Yiddish usages.  But if
you'll allow me to warm myself by the "sound" of mame loshen on email
(somebody pinch me) I look forward to being a part of the group and maybe
even adding a posting here or there when I have something worthwhile to
share.

Subject: Introduction

First let me state my credentials. I was born in Baltimore in 1917 of
Jewish parents who had emigrated from Russia. The first language I heard
spoken was yiddish. I learned yiddish by ear I never learned to read or
write yiddish.

My first impulse on reading Zelig's message was, I don't belong here.
However Axlerod's reply has encouraged me to add a thought or two. I
thought that Mendele would an opportunity to converse in yiddish though
not vocally at least I would feel it was. Yiddish is mir engebakn in de
beyner not so much the language as such, but the people who spoke it. es
darmont mir of mayn tate, mame, und bube, lang shoyn af de bessere velt.

So yetst darf ich reydn tsu zich aleyn. Which reminds of a little story
from Olsvanger's Royte Pomerantsn. If I may I would like to show it
here. Eyner a id iz amol gegangen tsun dokter un hot em gezogt azoy tsum
dokter "Dokter lebn, ich hob a zeyer shlechte krenk vos ich layd fun ir
Iyoyvs tsores, ich reyd tsu zich aleyn. "Zogt der dokter tsu-n-em:
"Meyle. es iz nit aza shreklache krenk: ot vi ir zet mich, red ich oych
amol tsu zich aleyn! Ma rash? Macht der id: "Ye, dokter ! Ober ir veysst
nit, vossara nudnik ich bin!"

I really dont understand every expression but I certainly appreciate the
yiddish. Incidentally that is the the yiddish is transliterated.
Olsvanger has credentials. Zelig zollst lebn biz hundert un tsvantsig,
und loz mich oych lebn. A sheynem daynk

Subject: Introduction and query

Well, I am a grad student in electrical engineering, and don't know any
Yiddish.  So perhaps I shouldn't be on this list, but I was interested in
learning, so if anyone has any suggestions for books and tapes that have
been found useful from personal experience I would be glad to hear about
it.  I haven't had any luck in meeting anyone who is willing to teach me
Yiddish.

ps: since my only experience with Yiddish has been observing its use
among relatives who wished for me not to understand what they were saying
no one should turn around and be surprised that i never did learn it.

Subject: In search of a Yiddish Text

A group of Yiddish teachers in Toronto has identified a need for a
primary level (Grades 1 to 8) textbook for teaching Yiddish.

Does a contemporary text exist? Information and ideas on the subjects
would be heartily welcomed.

A shainem dank,

Subject: Yiddish textbooks

Our shames has suggested to me that I put together a first version of an
answer to the FAQ (frequently asked question) "What book can I use to
study Yiddish?" So here's the information that I have readily at hand,
with my own comments on the books; additions are solicited from the
audience. The idea is to put together a list that Noyekh can send off as
canned answer when the question comes up, instead of reopening the public
discussion everytime.

Textbooks:

1) _College Yiddish_ by Uriel Weinreich, published by YIVO.

The classic, and still the usual textbook for college courses.
Unfortunately it was written (1949, revised several times) at a time when
college students could generally be assumed to have had a few years of
Latin, or the equivalent in terms of grammatical expertise, and as a
result the discussion of grammar is pitched at a level that many
contemporary students find inaccessible. Highly recommended, if you're
comfortable with statements like "Objects of prepositions take the dative
case." This book is also available in Hebrew (and other languages?).

2) _YIDDISH: An Introduction to the Language, Literature and Culture_,
   by Sheva Zucker.

Long awaited, and finally out. Comments to be added once I get my copy!

3) _Learning Yiddish in easy Stages_, by Marvin Zuckerman and Marion Herbst,
   published by Pangloss Press.

A much easier book than _College Yiddish_, although also much less
comprehensive. Particularly useful for those who don't know the Hebrew
alphabet, but want to learn. It has very nice alphabet charts, and almost
everything is given both in Hebrew letters and in Latin letters. There's
an accompanying tape, which I haven't heard. Comments, anyone?

4) _Der yidisher lerer_, by H. E. Goldin, published by the Hebrew
   Publishing Company, 1939 (and still in print!).

Useful for those with some knowledge of Yiddish who want to learn to read
it. Introduces the Hebrew letters gradually in the first few lessons.
Explanation of grammar is minimal, but it's cheap ;-)

5) _Yiddish for Beginners_, by Jean Joffen, revised edition 1982.

I've seen this, but haven't used it. It introduces the Hebrew letters,
but it's mostly in transliteration. More comments, anyone?

6) _Grammar of the Yiddish Language_, by Dovid Katz.

This is a reference book, rather than a text book. I haven't used it, but
I know people who find it helpful. More comments, anyone?

According to my latest information, these books are all in print, and all
can be purchased from the Workmen's Circle's Book Store, 800-922-2558
ext.285.

Advanced books

7) _Yidish Tsvey: a lernbukh far mitndike un vayhalters_, by Mordkhe
   Schaechter, publish by the League for Yiddish.

The only thing of its kind. A gold-mine of detailed observations on
grammar and usage. Hard to use on your own, unless you're prepared to
learn grammatical terminology _in_ Yiddish.

Subject: Motl

Bill Parker asks about the words to "Motl".  If you mean "Motl der
Oprayter", the words and music appear in "Pearls of Yiddish Song", on
page 248.  (The movie is also available on video from Ergo Media.)

Subject: "Mishpokhe Yiddish"

To Marcia Gruss Levinsohn:

1.  I was very happy to read in your introduction (4.109,2) that you and
your husband Meyshe hold in your home Yididsh classes  for 3 to 7 year
olds.  You call these classes _Mishpokhe Yiddish_.  I think that many
lovers and respectors of Yiddish might follow your idea, provided they
are pedagogically inclined and able to instill interest in and respect
for Yiddish.  What a lovely, warm example!

2.  I am a student of names, and have often lectured on stories and
histories of Jewish names.

The name _mashinke_in your E-Mail return address, caught my eye:

Is the stress on the first syllable,--MAshinke--, then it might be the
Yiddish endearing diminutive of the female name MASHE;  if the stress is
on the second syllable,--MaSHINke-- then it might be the Yiddish
diminutive of MASHIN (machine), a jocular but warm reference to the
computer after you found it user-friendly.
