There have been a couple of references recently to Bavarian
German being similar to Yiddish.  Can someone elaborate
more on this?

Several years ago we were visiting a provincial park and
went for a bit of a hike with our (then) two kids.  Some
German-speaking tourists were nearby, and I listened to
bits of their conversation. At one point, referring to our
3 year old having walked along some path we took, one of
the ladies said "Das kleyne meydl hat's gemakht" (I'm
transliterating into YIVO phonetics here).  I was surprised
at how that sounded more like Yiddish than German, and
asked her why she said "kleyne" instead of "klayne", and
why "meydl" instead of "Maedchen".  She answered that they
were from Munich and that was just how they spoke.  Having
studied "official" German for 5 years in high school and
university, I'd never been aware of these dialect
differences.

Is Bavarian German similar to Yiddish because of accidental
parallel development, or did the "original" Yiddish of 800
years ago develop in that part of Germany, and begin its
life as Bavarian German + Hebrew-religious vocabulary,
written down in the one alephbais that the people knew?

Subject: negative concord

i have been following the recent discussion of negative
concord in yiddish with great interest.  since ellen prince
mentioned that bavarian has negative concord as well, i
thought it would be interesting to see if there were any
differences between bavarian and yiddish.  below are some
data that a bavarian linguist colleague has kindly
supplied.  the asterisk stands for an impossible sentence.
in bavarian, apparently there is a big difference between
negative expressions that are "bare" expressions like
"koana" (no-one) and ones that modify a noun.  the bare
negative expressions can't appear together with "ned"
(not), whereas the modified negative expressions can
(though they don't have to).  this is different from
yiddish, right?

(1) Wea is'n kumma?
    who is then come
    'so who came?'

       Answer: 'no-one'
    a. Koa Mensch ned (no person not)
    b. Koa Mensch (no person)
    c. Koa oanziga ned (no single-one not)
    d. Koa oanziga (no single-one)
    e. *Koana ned (*no-one not)
    f. Koana (no-one)

(2) Wos host'n kafft?
    what have-you then bought?
    'so what did you buy?'

       Answer: 'nothing'
    a. Nix (nothing)
    b. *Nix ned (*nothing not)
    c. Nix G'scheids (nothing intelligent (= worthwhile))
    d. Nix G'scheids NED (nothing intelligent NOT)
       for some reaons, (d) is only ok if "ned" is stressed

(3) Wann werds in Noaweng finsta?
    when becomes-it in Norway dark
    'when does it get dark in Norway'

       Answer: 'never'
    a. Nia (never)
    b. *Nia ned (*never not)

(4) Wia oft bist'n scho z'Italien gween?
    how often are-you then already to italy been
    'so how have you been in italy?'

       Answer: never
    a. No nia (still never, i.e. never)
    b. *No nia ned (*still never not)
    c. Koa oanzigs Mai (no single time)

       i don't know about (d); bayer apparently forgot this
       sentence. i assume it is fine, but have sent him a
       message asking him.

    d. Koa oanzigs Mai ned (no single time not)

Professor Rothstein has beaten me to the punch.  We used to
sing this one in our family as well. I have the exact same
version by Adolph King.
