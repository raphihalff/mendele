>(zol zayn opgesheydt tsum lebn).   Sometimes one puts it even "lehayim
>aruqim" (tsu lange yorn).

in my family, lehavdl was never used for this, either. the standard thing
was _dir/aykh/im/ir tsu lange yorn_. in our 'yinglish/english', it was
_you/he/she should live and be well_.

Subject: Keeping the list together

My wish is that the list continue as it is. I'm not a professional
scholar, but I consider myself an intellectual (I'm a bibliotekar) and a
Yiddishist. I came to Yiddishkayt very early in life from a completely
foreign back- ground, and I feel that I can understand both "sides" in
this debate. I've never taken a course in Yiddish, but am self-taught.

Perhaps Ellen Prince's experience trying to have a radio program be both
a scholarly piece and an entertaining event is relevant here. I enjoyed
her program partly from the entertainment level, but I also was impressed
by the scholarship. I'm not a "scholar" but I understand scholars, have
been around them all my life, and what they have to say interests me a
great deal.

I think we should take a positive attitude toward the scholarly/technical
mission of the list. Are some people perhaps defensive about not being to
understand scholarly debate? Well, coming back to Ellen, the majority of
her audience probably did not understand her discussion of Bessarabian
Yiddish and dialect shift. However, I understood it very clearly and was
pleased to hear such a discussion interwoven into the more everyday type
of loshn. Maybe that's what we should do here: realize that it is a
scholarly list and _learn_ from the scholars.

Every time I post something -- "I read somewhere .... " I have had really
good responses to it, where one or more scholars has jumped in. A good
example was this: it dawned on me one day that I had never heard anything
about Jewish music in Western Ashkenaz, so I threw out a question and we
got a nice, lively discussion going. Did I have to be a scholar to wonder
about it, or ask about it? And if I didn't understand the meaning of the
responses, because Mendele is a "mixed list" would a scholar have been
taken aback if asked to clarify or explain technical language? I think
they need to expect it, and the "lay" members should ask it. To me this
is not a big issue. Mir zenen ale gelernte layt! Let's have _confidence_
in our intelligence and not worry too much about what we don't
understand. Ask! Freg! Hob a bisl khutspe do, ha!

Subject: Alte zakhn

Today, while taking my children to the doctor's in Tel Aviv I heard
the clop-clop of horse hooves and the call "alte zakhn" (pronounced as
best I could make out, 'alti zakn') from the mouths of a couple of men in
knitted caps, who I assume are the same gentlemen that an earlier writer
on Mendele referred to.  My kids had just been the subject of a
conversation in YIddish that a woman passer-by engaged me in moments
before -- and so when I pointed out the Arab wagon-drivers, their horse,
and their Yiddish, my children were puzzled and amused.  Thank you,
fellow Mendelnik and Tel-Avivian, for alerting me!

Subject: Explaining the exotic

Some of the discussion on mendele about the academy explaining its
mysteries to the laity calls to mind a story from the 1920's.

Father, puzzling over the newspaper, asks son:  "Irving, you went to
college, you know things, tell me what is this business about
Relativity?"

"Well, pop, it means that everything is relative to something else, that
nothing is absolute by itself.  Maybe I should give you better a for
instance.  For instance, say you are sitting down. Sitting is sitting.
But if you sit on a hot stove for one second it feels like an hour, while
if you sit with a pretty girl on your lap for one hour it feels like a
second.  So you see, everything is relative."

"Ah-ha?  Und fun azelkhen narrishkaiten klaibt Einstein parnosseh?"

Subject: Brandeis Institute and other venues for Yiddish Education

I beg the indulgence of my fellow Mendelniks for two postings in one day,
but this one is on a totally different subject.

Years ago I learned of the Brandeis Institute in California, which had a
wonderful reputation as a place in which Jewish culture was transmitted
to those whos e backgrounds were lacking, in one way or another.  My
question is as follows: Does it still exist?  If so, where is it and how
does one get in touch with it ?  And does anyone know whether its
programs contain any Yiddish content?

Finally, do any Mendelniks know of other sites where Yiddish instruction
might be available during the summer, or (perhaps) of Elder-Hostels aimed
at the Yiddish-speaking (or Yiddish wanting-to-speak) oylem?  I would be
most grateful for any feedback.
