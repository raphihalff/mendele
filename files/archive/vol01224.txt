Subject: some notes

Thanks, Knud Lambrecht, for making the correction about
quantity of the unit -- it's exactly the self-correction I
planned to make after reading my own blurb.

The editor of _Afn shvel_ is not Mordkhe Spektor.  It is
Mordkhe Schaechter, im tsu lange yor.  Spektor was a famous
Yiddish writer of some one hundred years ago.  A charming
mistake, though.

[Gevald, nokh a mol gezindikt!]

Yeah, I know of a Yiddish organization worth supporting:
Yugntruf - Youth for Yiddish.  It's a Yiddish student
organization with a quarterly magazine, branches on a
number of campuses (Columbia, Penn, Austin, Stanford) and
in a number of cities.  Provides info and material for
Yiddish students at all levels, as well as activities at
which Yiddish-speaking or -studying young people can get
together and socialize af mame-loshn.  Its office is the
same as that of the League for Yiddish, but the
organizations are different (i.e., don't send a
subscription/order form or check to one when you really
mean the other).  The address:

        Yugntruf - Youth for Yiddish
	200 West 72 St.  Suite #40
	New York, NY 10023
	(212) 787-6675

Do you know any Yiddish-speaking or -studying young people?
Parents who are raising their kids in Yiddish?  Send
Yugntruf your/their address and the office will send
you/them information.  I am "slightly" involved as a
co-chairperson of the organization and co-editor of the
magazine.  Questions can be directed to me as well:

braund@linc.cis.upenn.edu

I'll announce to Mendele the annual Yugntruf conference
tomorrow, bli-neyder, as soon as I have the info. in front
of me.

Subject: Yok

Yok is, it seems to me, clearly, goy "spelled backwards"
with the Southern Yiddish devoicing of final /g/ to /k/. A
similar phenomenon, lehavdl, existed in Chicago when I was
much younger: the term "wedge" was an in-term for Jew
(i.e., Jew "spelled backwards').

Subject: RE: Mendele Vol 1.223

Opgefrishte broyt (i.e., "freshened" bread) is the only
Yiddish word I know for "toast". Does that cast any light
on the subject of "(op)gefrishte matse"?

Mikhl.

Knud,

I agree with most of what you say about 'bis', although I
am just a plain yid and not a savant linguist.

The point I would like to make as a (non-native) speaker of
French is that you would say NEITHER 'un morceau de
chocolat' NOR 'deux morceaux de ...' but 'une bouchee de
chocolat' or ..., since 'un morceau' is just a piece,
whereas 'une bouchee' is a piece that is in your mouth.
More generally in French the 'bis' is said in a way that
depends on *what* you 'bays'. E.g. you would say 'une
cuilleree de confiture' or 'une gorgee de the' or 'un brin
d'herbe' (latter two not exactly a 'bis'). Furthermore the
notion of 'mass noun' is not exactly the same as in Englis.
But "dayenu", as one said a few days ago.

Subject: Introduction

I am an undergraduate student (in physics) at Harvard
University and Yiddish is one of my side interests.

(Although as a gute yid I can more or less understand the
language I'm afraid I can't write or speak it with any
competence..)

Regards,
Allon
