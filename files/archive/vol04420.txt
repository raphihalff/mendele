Subject: Gdzie tu mieszka krawiec?

I've fallen into the discussion without remembering the original
question.  But the Slavic line around which the song is centered means
"Where does a tailor live around here?"  (I wrote it in Polish, but the
line in the Yiddish song might be from Byelorussian.  Is _dzye_ the
Byelorussian form of Russian _gde_/Polish _gdzie_?)

So if you're ever in Minsk or Pinsk and you need a new suit, remember
this macaronic song.

Subject: Tzie tut kravitz mieshka

Another example of the Yiddish-Ukrainian cocktail:

Pane Mirovoi,				Honorable Judge,
Di manse vos dertseyl ikh is azoi:	Here is my story:
Vin mae kozu,				He has a goat,
A ia maiu dakh.				And I have a roof.
Yogo koza				His goat
Shpring na miy dakh,			Jump on my roof,
Ia yomu kazhu,				I tell him,
A vin ishche lakh.			But he is laughing.

Amateurish linguistic note: both Yiddish words in the second half of the
verse are verbs, which from my observations matches the speech patterns
of Yiddish speakers when they used their broken Ukrainian or Russian.

Subject: "Shtayg" from Yiddish slang for learning?

Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, the eminent Talmudic scholar and commentator, who
many equate with Rashi, was featured recently on a television hookup via
satellite for Jewish college students from a studio at New York
University to colleges in Canada and Australia

The global telecast was officially aimed at the study of ancient texts,
but the scholar roamed around matters that, to judge from the students'
questions, had more immediate relevance to their concerns.

The scholar's comments were quite salty (as befits his last name
Steinsaltz -- Steinsalt)  At one point he said:  "The study of the Talmud
cannot be passive.  It is like being passive in sex;  you get no
enjoyment of it."

The program was called _Steig '95 _ (note the German spelling), and the
term "Steig" was explained as "coming from the Yiddish slang for learn."

This is quite incorrect.  "Shtayg," from the verb "shtaygn," or
"shtayger" (noun), is more properly described not as slang but as argot,
that is a word, idiom, or concept strictly limited, in this particular
instance, to the world of the yeshi've or intense religious study.  It
does connotes learning, but its meaning is learning _af a hekherer
madrey'ge _ (on a higher spiritual level), of the type that elevates the
learner to higher horizons and perspectives .

The meaning of "shtayg" in this special sense is close to the terms
"ali'ye" (to be called up to the reading of the toyre), or "aliyah" (to
immigrate to Israel).  In both these instances the acts are considered
transcending the factual events.  One who immigrates to Israel is called
in Hebrew "Oleh,"  as having reached a higher rung in his spiritual life,
and one who emigrated from Israel is called in Hebrew "yored," an
expatriate, an impoverished man. ["Yo'red" is, of course, also used in
Yiddish in the latter sense.]

There are many synonyms in Yiddish for learning, but "Shtayg" does _ not_
come from Yiddish slang.

Subject: Tsar Alexander

Meyshe-Yankl mentioned an off-color phrase regarding Tsar Alexander (Tsar
Alexander, yafunyemat....etc).  Perhaps Bob Rothstein can fill in some
more phrases and/or verify the theory that this is part of a Jewish
soldier's (marching) chant?  I have a few others that may be of the same
(though tamer) rhythm...

	Tsar iz milavalsa
	I dal manifest
	Myort vi svaboda
	Zhivi po darrest
	Rasseye, Rasseye
	Zhal mnye tibya
	Blednaya gorkaya
	Uchistvaya

I'm sure my Russian transliteration is pretty bad, but my Bubbe led me to
believe this was a Jewish conscript's song though this one I believe
refers to Nicholas: freedom for the dead, prison for the living...etc.
Bob?
