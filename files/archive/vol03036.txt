Subject: scanning yiddish texts

i am looking to buy a scanner to read texts in yiddish (and
preferably german as well) and would appreciate any and all
information and tips.  the scanner needs to be compatible with a mac
IIci and/or a sun sparc station.

please reply to me privately---i'll be happy to summarize for the
list. thanks.

Subject: Yiddish -- The Fifteenth Slavic Language?

i'd just like to add a tragi-comic addendum to khaim bochner's
articulate and patient reply re wexler's claim that yiddish is
slavic.

wexler also has another 'theory': modern hebrew is yiddish.

therefore, following wexler (and aristotle), modern hebrew is
slavic. this has one wonderful implication: israel can save lots of
money by closing all the ulpans--the russian olim already know
hebrew! :)

Subject: Yiddish NPs and Basque

I recently examined noun phrase (NP) word order in about 20
genetically and areally diverse languages.  Included in this study
were  adjective phrases such as "a very good child," which my native
Yiddish speaker translated as "zeyer a guter kind."  This
construction occurred in transitive sentences, like "I hit a very
big truck, "  so it differs from the English "That was really a big
truck."  In English, we would not say "I hit really a big truck."
Rather, we say "I hit a really big truck."

Aside from Basque, which places its intensifier ("very") outside the
noun phrase [oso etxe ondia = very house big] no other language in
my study separated the intensifier from the adjective it modifies.
German does not have this construction.

My question is, does anyone know how Yiddish acquired this
construction?  (Hebrew doesn't have it either).  Did German have
such a construction earlier?  When?

Subject: Iddish

The following fashkal or proclamation, was handed to me by Gella
Fishman, who asked me to pass it on to Mendele and other
interested parties:

**************************************

[Hebrew] Histradrut ha-Admori"m
[In English] Histadruth Admorim
1605 - 48th St., Brooklyn, NY 11204/(718)327-0196/(718)327-8007
_________________________________________________
[Hebrew]A VOICE PROCLAIMS
LET US RESTORE PAST GLORY
LET US SPEAK ONLY AND EXCLUSIVELY IN "IDDISH"![SIC]
IT IS THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH OUR FOREBEARS AND OUR RABBIS NB"M [may
their spirits rest in the hidden places of heaven] ZY"E [may their
rights defend us] SPOKE IN
_________________________________________________ 
a)With all our hearts we call all our brothers Children of Israel
THAT THEY MAY SPEAK "amongst them" "and to their children" only and
exclusively a tongue that is acceptable to us, from our forbears and
our teachers of blessed memory through the generations AND IT IS THE
"IDDISH" LANGUAGE! that is a strengthening of religious belief to
stand against the temper and damages of time that are destroying the
pure spirit and the holy spirit of our holy people, hy"v [may the
Lord guard them and save them].

b]We do call all Roshei Yeshivot Shlit"a, and to all heads of
Institutions of Bet Ya'akov, Shlit"a THAT THE TEACH AND SPEAK TO
their students, male and female, ONLY AND EXCLUSIVELY IN THE TONGUE
WHICH WE RECEIVED FROM OUR TEACHERS, THE "IDDISH" LANGUAGE, to
fulfill an article of xz"l [our masters of blessed memory] (Ediot
1:3, TB Brachot 47a) A man "is required" to speak in his Rabbi's
"language."

The IDDISH language that our ancestors and rabbis zy'e [may their
rights defend us] spoke some "hundreds" of years, (even before the
generation of h"k [the holy] Ba'al Shem Tov -- and the Gr"a [Vilna
Gaon] zts"l [of blessed memory] who are the hold great ones who
sanctified the language and it is the true strengthener of religion
shey'z [that thereby] put a fence around themselves and the words of
Torah that they not yhy' [be] at the mercy lechv"m [of idol
worshippers] as Rabbi Ami said (TB Hagiga 13a vbthkv"z [and in the
Tikkunei Zohar] page 166a) that "it is forbidden to receive Torah
from those who speak foreign languages ble"z [in a foreign
language], AND IT IS LIKE PLACING AN IDOL [ashara] IN GOD'S HOLY
TEMPLE" eyy"sh [see there].

Come let us gather strength to restore past glory, and strengthen
our generation against assimilation x"v [God forbid] among hechv"m
[the idol worshippers], and to strengthen them by way of the holy
Torah, received by us from generation to generation.

IN THE NAME OF THE ADMORI"M
SAMUEL SHMELKA RUBIN, ADMOR FROM SOLITZA

*******************************************

While at first glance defenders of Hebrew are liable, as I was, to
see in this proclamation an attack on Hebrew, it is not meant to be.
Indeed this is an attack on the use of English in the Yeshivas, a
drawing back from Art Scroll and translations of Steinsaltz.  At all
events this seems to be a real, although strangely motivated, appeal
for revitalization of Yiddish.

My questioning of local sources shows that the signatory does indeed
exist and prefers to talk English in visits to Israel. Thus, he also
seems to be a non-supporter of Hebrew.
