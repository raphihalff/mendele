Subject: brief introduction

My name is Alice Nakhimovsky.  I teach Russian language and
literature at Colgate.  I've come to this through something
of a back door - that is, I have studied and written about
Russian Jews, 1860s to present (whatever I could figure out
as of last year is in a book called Russian-Jewish
Literature and Identity, Johns Hopkins 1992).  Last year
for the first time I managed to collaborate on a course
that included Yiddish lit in translation.  It was wonderful
and I hope to do it again if the educational establishment
here permits.  So I'm here mostly to listen, unless someone
has a question about Russian.  My Yiddish is pretty
primitive - if someone has information about worthwhile
language tapes (not lit on tape) let me know.

Subject: (') Sholem fun Varshe| (B) Tanakh in Yidish?

Varshe, ma'ariv, yom shishi, 27 Elul '752.
 
Sholem aleikhem ale Mendelnikn|
 
              *(')*(')*(')*
 
'Kh bin Shloime: a poilisher Yid in Varshaver Universitet.
Delighted to 've joined this great_fun@Noyekh.un.Co.EDU. So
diverse topics, so incentive conributors; last not least,
so energetic *THE* Moderator (|special thanx|).
 
Here at the U. of Warsaw, WAR-SAW I study for my majors
applied linguistics (@ the Inst. of Applied Linguisics) &
Hebrew philology (@ the Oriental Institute). Besides,
minoring in some extra subjects (Asia Minor included) at
other U.W. faculties. The still-bachelor marital status
allows me to spend more time for broadminded studies. (U
know, 'Dzieci nie placza' ã='Children aren't weeping'! --
as a polish-lg sayin' goes -- as I don't have any yet
ãanyway, hope the mitzva of kiddushin & procreation should
be fulfilled in a farther unspecified 'near Zukunft'!).
 
At present, engaged in the activities of DEGEL_HATORAH,
that I founded on the 24th yarzeit of the ill-famed Eight
of March, '68 (start of the anti- Semitic campaign in this
country). The unabridged name of D"H reads:

       (Hebrew:) Dales-Giml-Lamed Hei-Sov-Vov-Reish-Hei
       DEGEL_HATORAH Jewish Circle for Arts and Sciences
       (Polish:) Judaistyczne Kolo Nauk i Sztuk
       SHEMitologist Alliance.
 
The Circle is not sponsored & run totally on a voluntary
basis. Now performing the job of its secretary's I've got a
lot of challenges to face, of which the top one is (I'm
afraid unconquerable, at least for the time being) severe
time deficit. Pse don't treat this remark as a grumble of
mine, for one MUSTN'T grumble, kiMrivah k'yom massah
bammidbar (T'hillim TzH:Ch). One of D"H's main objectives
is to combat the anti-Semitism, the polish variety of that
pest in particular. On the whole the body is meant to
experience/study Yiddishkeit at large, incl. Middle Eastern
political deals.
 
Thus, whenever U were visiting Warsaw, pse feel free to
drop me a line beforehand, & I'd be happy to see U here
delivering a speech/interview  on a J- topic to U.W.
students.  Since the audience is supposed to be
prevailingly non- J, the topic's format needn't be
necessarily  high-brow. The J-lectures to that goishe
audience intend to deliberately enlighten the biased
uneducated pollacks on what Judaism is in fact. To combat
foolishdom effectively=give the foolish a chance to study.
 
In general, poles are a heavily lazy &
anti-self-educational people -- this is my 26.5-yr-old
personal observation, myself having been raised on (&
erased from) this soil. But the nineL taught, 'Study,
study, & once more study|' Lernen zikh iz
ai(|)-ai(|)-ai(|), n'est-ce pas? A curious bit is the
lectures due to take place at the Department of Arabic &
Islamic Studies, U.W. Myself being a student to this place
as well, I've been given the Dept.'s Director's permission
to rent their lecture hall. BTW, no securer place at the
Univ. as far as the safeguard against the P.L.O.'s gun
unpredictability is concerned. (Which one of those folks
should venture a bomb attack on a place meant for the study
of qur'an's lg, where some Palestinians apparently study as
well?).
 
               *(B)*(B)*(B)*
 
BTW, could any1 of U (nice people in Ha'aretz & over the
ocean) advise me on how I could get a copy of a cheap good
Yiddish translation of Tanakh (or Torah at least)? How many
different translations have been made so far? Any help
thanked much in advance|
