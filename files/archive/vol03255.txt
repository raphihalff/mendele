Subject: Feygelakh, nokh a mol

I have some doubt about Mikhl Herzog's contention, seductive though
it may be, that feygele is merely a "Yiddishoid" version of fag.
Firstly, per Feinsilver, it is a common term of endearment, with no
sexual connotation implied.  So it didn't have to be invented.
Secondly, in a strange coincidence, my partner is a DARE editor, and
he believes that he spoke to Jacob Mlotek, who told him it was
attested in Poland.  Thirdly, it is hardly to be credited that
same-sex emotional/sexual behavior was unknown among E. European
Jews, although balebatishe mentshen would have had that "bay unts iz
dos nit geven" response, there was, as we know, a rich underworld of
ganeyvim, nofkes, and other such "proste" folk, who must have had a
rich vocabulary of terms for sexual preferences of all types.
Naturally, the concept of gay or homosexual wasn't available to the
more rural and traditional people, who may have viewed what we would
consider a gay man as a type of eunuch (sores). Anyone out there
familiar with Yiddish underworld slang, any literature available on
that?  By the way, would love to hear why "Feygel" is not related to
birds.

Deeply shocked at Jascha Kessler's homophobic remarks.  A shande un
a kharpe.  He must be aware that a Roman male would cruise both
girls and boys with equal aplomb (cf. Amy Richlin's excellent "The
Garden of Priapus), as homophobia had not yet seized the West with
the rise of body-hating Christianity (see Brown's "The Body and
Society").  Don't know what kind of weird universe he inhabits,
where all the gay people are "depressed, unhappy, and angry"--this
is the most egregious sterotyping out of the '50s, much as
discribing Jews as "shrewd and avaricious" or blacks as "rhythmical,
shiftless, simpleminded".  I'd be happy to introduce you to many
reasonably happy, self-accepting, creative, life-affirming gay men
and lesbians, Jascha.  Many of them are also (oy vey!) Jewish, as
were, l'moshl, Gerty Stein, Aaron Copeland, Lenny Bernstein, Harvey
Milk, to mention be a few illustrious non-depressed feygelakh. As to
a group's right to name itself, I seem to remember that it wasn't
long ago that the then regnant WASPs referred to us as "Hebrews"--a
very distancing term indeed, which we correctly rejected for the
upfront "Jew".  Another example is naming the Tanakh from the point
of view of our historical oppressors the "New Testament"--that too
is rightly giving way to the neutral "Hebrew Bible." There are some
PC excesses, but I find that those who protest them the most are
really just deathly afraid of the changes in our culture threatening
their privileged positions.  End of droshe.

And what of the truly invisible Lesbian in Yiddish?  Weinreich
doesn't even include the word in his English section; it's
interesting that Harkavy, writing in supposedly less liberated
times, could include all sorts of real words for sexual and other
bodily functions that Weinreich eschews.  I've heard "Lesbiankes",
but that's probably a fairly recent coinage.

Subject: "Dialectical" Yiddishisms

In regard to [Zachary Baker's] question:

>Were there actually Jews who said
>"tokken" instead of takke [sic] for 'indeed'?  Or who nasalized the
>ayin in mayseh, a story or tall tale, so that it sounded like
>'manseh'?

My maternal grandfather was from Lodz, Poland.  My maternal
grandmother was from Yekatrinislav (sp?), if I remember correctly,
or anyway someplace that shifted back and forth between Russia and
Poland.  Both  of them said "Mayntse" instead of "Mayseh".  I can't
answer in regard to your other examples because I didn't know enough
Yiddish to know what they were saying or even parse the words.

Through the Center for Jewish Life at Princeton U., I'm finally
fulfilling my lifelong goal of learning Yiddish.

Zay mir gesint.  (??)
