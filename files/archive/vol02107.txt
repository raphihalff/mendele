Subject: khurbm/hobm

I'm having a hard time understanding the problem with the
pronunciation of these two words.  My experience has always
been that a final nun after a labial is always pronounced
as a mem.  I have yet to hear a native Yiddish speaker
pronounce the number seven as anything but 'zibm' or the
infinitive of 'shtup' or 'khap' other than 'shtupm' and
'khapm', regardless of how they're written.  In all cases,
the labials are not pronounced plosively; the lips remain
closed for the final nasal (I can't remember what this is
called), which is assimilated to a mem.

Subject: sneezes

What Shulamith Berger discribed as a variation on reactions
to sneezes by her father (gey shoin in drerd, du host a
kalt), I learned long ago as the punch line of a joke, to
be made as long as you want, by having the mother react to
each sneeze with a blessing (recited in a loving tone of
voice) until the last one (when the teller runs out of
blessings) with that line spoken in exasperation.

           says "huhbin" and Dad, "obin" (sort of like the
           English "oven" with a "b" sound instead of a "v"

Subject: RE: Sheygets

A recent inquiry was about words used to described
non-Jews.  I don't recall the exact rendering given, but it
seemed to me to indicate "Sheketz" and "Shiktza."  These
words comes from the Hebrew terms for male and female
"crawling things which make one impure through contact.

Dan Breslauer, University of Kansas

[This is as good a place as any to suggest that the use of
such terms is offensive and (unless there's some over-
riding intellectual issue at stake) that Mendele can do
without them.  Counter-arguments are welcome. nm]

In Joshua Fishman's "The Lively Life of a 'Dead' Language
(or, Everyone Knows that Yiddish Died Long Ago) from
_Language of Inequality_ (Fishman, ed., Mouton, 1985), it
says "(Yiddish) boasts five dailies, half a dozen weeklies
and literally scores of monthlies and quarterlies, a total
of 35 in the US alone."

Can anyone give me the current figures?

Thanks.
