Subject: Another Yiddish euphemism

I the old country every Jewish boy learned, even in his early infancy,
that _shmaysn_ [to slap or lash] had a direct association with _hintn_
[Yiddish for buttocks], the fleshy lower backside, as the natural and
unique "reserve" for shame and punishment for "unjewish" mischievous
behavior.

The Hebrew word used as a euphemism for "hintn" is tof-khes-sof
(to'khes), meaning under, below. (The euphemism for men's underwear,
specifically for _gatkes_ is "takhtoynim" from the same Hebrew root.]

For other Yiddish euphemisms see the discussion about vulgarisms in _A
Century of Yiddish in America:  Yiddish and English_ by Sol Steinmetz,
pp. 56-57;  also my recent post 5.198,3.

So far, "tokhes" or "tukhes" is not considered acceptable in polite
society or family-oriented magazines or newspapers.  At most, it would
likely be treated in print as the famous /f/ word, that is by printing
only the initial /t/, and for each consecutive letter a short dash or
hyphen /- - - - -/. The French _derriere_ , however, is for some resaon
found acceptable.

Alan Dershowitz, the celebrated Harvard law professor, recently submitted
a satirical sketch to the journal of the American Bar Association in
which the Yiddish expression "tokhes afn tish" (literally, put your rear
end on the table) appeared in a bit of dialogue.  The editors of the
journal objected to the expression and changed it.

The expression "tokhes afn tish" is a frequently used phrase among card
players when the game is for money, and simply means 'put your money on
the table,' i.e. in the "bank."

This word sometimes finds its way in a TV commercial (with a /k/ in place
of the /kh/), as in a recent Whoopi Goldberg commercial for a telephone
company ("I can sit on my tokis and do nothing to earn big savings").

The accepted substitute in English for "tokhes" has been _tushie_ or
_tushy_, apparently formed, according to Steinmetz, on the basis of a
baby-talk diminutive.  This word was then shortened to "tush," as in Mel
Brooks' classic movie "Blazing Saddles," where a women bar singer by the
name (I believe) of Von Push, in a satirical spoof of a Marlene Dietrich
seductive song, rhymed "push" with "tush."

I heard about an advertisement in the New York subways where a physician
by the name of "Dr. Tush" offered his services for size reduction or an
otherwise surgical procedure thereabouts.

And the _New York Times_ (12/17/95, p. 3), describing the white-gloved
men on the subway platforms in Japan who push passengers into the already
crowded cars and who are called in Japanese "shiri oshi," translated it
as "tushy pushers".

Is it possible that the expression "tokhes afn tish" in a card game is a
vulgar but somewhat innovative, playful Yiddish translation of the
English phrase "bare your assets," that is, show us your money and  put
it on the table, the word 'assets' here having a double entendre, and the
phrase gained in popularity on account of its vulgarity and because some
found it funny?

Subject: Hebrew fonts

Zavi Beer asks [5.195] about Hebrew fonts for Mendele. It's fundamentally
impossible without restricting access to Mendele to those who can support
the relevant software. Not everyone can. For example, I usually read
Mendele on a VT-100 compatible terminal (yes, a terminal, not a computer
running software that makes it emulate a terminal). Non-ASCII text just
won't work.

Now, it's possible to convert YIVO transcription to Yiddish with
reasonable accuracy (though the words from loshn-koydesh won't come out
right). Refoyl Finkl developed the concept a long while back, and I wrote
a "yiddish writer" stack for HyperCard on the Mac that does a nice job.
(I did it for an article I had to write for _Yugntruf_ magazine.)  I type
in YIVO transcription, click a button, and my program converts it to
Yiddish, using the Vilne font, in a separate field on the screen. Anyone
who doesn't mind the text being slightly mangled (most specifically re
the Hebrew-origin words) might run such a program on the transliterated
portions of Mendele, if they wanted.

(I'll be happy to send my HyperCard stack to anyone who wants it.)

Subject: Yiddish in American film

To add to the discussion from a few weeks ago about American films that
include Yiddish:

Watching "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" last week, I was
surprised to hear a bisl Yiddish. Willy Wonka (played by Billy Wilder)
says a few lines in Yiddish, in addition to other languages. I wonder if
the pygmy-like "Oompa-Loompa" characters are at all related to the
Yiddish word "umgelumperte," which means awkward.
