Yiddish was my first spoken language, but despite my education in IWO
Yiddish schools in the Bronx and despite having heard spoken Yiddish
into my adulthood, I am now struggling to retain the language. Retired
from a technical career for five years now, I've spent much of my time
trying to trace the eventful cultural and ideological journey taken by
a group of radical Lodzer (my parents and their friends) from the turn
of the century through the rest of their lives. Most of them emigrated
to the United States very shortly after the first World War.

My father, a learned man despite little formal education, was the
cultural director of the Jewish Culture Club of Co-op City (Yiddish
speaking) in the Bronx, New York for many years after he retired from
the needle trade. Literacy ran mainly on the male track in both my
parents' families in Lodz. My older aunts, those who had married
before World War I, stayed home during the war, raised families, and,
for the most part, remained illiterate for the rest of their lives.

My mother, born in 1900, did learn to read and write, but where and
when is an interesting question. Her earliest writings that are still
extant, date from 1916 and consist of brief identifying notes and
greetings on the backs of photographs. She often confused the mirror
image letters gimel and zayen, even in her own name. My conjecture is
that she had probably just learned to write during the war (and away
from home.) She did tell me that Aaron Bergman, a family friend, an
active Bundist at the time, and subsequently a Yiddish scholar active
in the IWO and Yiddish education in New York, taught her to read.
Unfortunately, I've found little biographical material about him thus
far. That would help establish where he was in 1915-16.

Both of my parents worked on construction gangs building military
roads in Grodno gubernia for the Germans after they had occupied Lodz
in November, 1914. They and their friends unvaryingly referred to this
experience as working "ofn shusey" (shin-alef-samekh-yud-yud: a
causeway or macadamized road per Harkavy, 1898, p.321. Weinreich
doen't have it, but it is common in German.) I am looking for evidence
of a Yiddish literacy program, formal or informal, among these labor
batallions, to support my theory regarding my mother's literacy. These
labor gangs are reported by the Germans to have numbered 700,000 in
Poland alone, in the course of the war. (I have no ethnic breakdown.)

Of course, my mother could have learned earlier at home and still
gotten the letters confused. But that kills a good story; it also
doesn't jibe with either her character, or with the fact that my
older, married aunts didn't learn to write.

Any memoir, oral history, remembered family story, no matter how
seemingly tangential, could give me the clue I'm looking for. It seems
that Bund accounts would be a logical place to look. But, although
I've seen several accounts of Bund activity in Poland during the war,
I've drawn a blank so far. Can anyone help me?

I have read about half a year's worth of Mendele since I started last
week. It has been an unalloyed joy! When I got to the exegesis of
'shvartz-kheynivdike' I was immediately transported home again to the
Bronx, listening my mother deliver that succulent, geshmake,
untranslatable phrase. I also discovered several old friends among the
Mendele contributors (Mendelians?) Serendipity galore! (also
untranslatable)
