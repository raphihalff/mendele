Subject: Hebreyizmen in der yidisher shprakh

I might add to Al Grand's useful information (Mendele, vol. 6.225) on the
availability of the 1957 book by Nakhmen Krupin that this book has the virtue
of including for each Hebraism a Yiddish orthographic rendering of its
pronunciation. As a further response to Bess Katz's inquiry, let me mention
another such dictionary that I have:

"Yehoyash" (Bloomgarden, S.) & Spivak, Khayem (Spivak, C.D.). (1926). Idish
verterbukh. New York: Ferlag Veker.

The title is misleading. The long subtitle makes it clear that it is a
dictionary of Semitic (Hebrew and Aramaic) words and expressions in Yiddish"

"Ale Hebreishe (un Khaldeishe) verter...velkhe veren gebroykht in der idisher
shprakh, mit zeyer oysshprak un aksent..."

Subject: Hebrew terms in Yiddish

Morrie Feller (5.180) asks about lists of Hebraisms in Yiddish.  Two
readily available collections are

1.  Steven A. Jacobson (a Mendelyaner),  "A guide to the more common
Hebraic words in Yiddish", 3rd ed., 1994.  This book lists alphabetically
according to their traditional spelling about 2000 hebraisms, together
with their phonetic Yiddish respellings (following the YIVO orthography)
and their English glosses.  A second section lists the same expressions
alphabetized by the phonetic respelling, together with the traditional
spelling and the glosses. Available from Steven Jacobson, P.O. Box 82849,
Fairbanks Alaska 99708.

2.  Nakhman Krupin,  "Hantbukh fun hebreizmen in der yidisher shprakh",
1957. This book lists hebraisms and their phonetic respellings (no
English).  There is also a brief section on words having hebraic roots
and non-hebraic prefixes or suffixes (e.g., _shadkhn, shadkhnte,
shadkhenen zikh..._), and finally examples of the use of hebraisms by _di
klasiker_ and others.  Available from the Jewish Book Center of the
Workmen's Circle, 45 East 33 St, New York NY 10016.

My own early Yiddish education gave short shrift to
_loshn-koydesh_-derived lexicon, and I've found both the Jacobson and the
Krupin quite useful in playing catch-up.

Subject: Hebrew terms in Yiddish

Morrie Feller asks for a reference to a book listing Hebrew words used in
Yiddish. The _Verterbichel fun hebrayishe-yidishe verter_, by Yacov Levin
(New York: Cyco Froyen Central, 1958) is one such book.

Subject: Tevye's quotations

Mechl Asheri contributes yet more substantial material (6.227, 3) to the task
of appreciating, in depth, Sholem Aleichem's genius in playing with language.
Reading Sholem Aleichem is rewarding even if the reading is only superficial.
However, go beneath the surface and explore glorious complexities.  But about
Tevye's clever mistranslation, most of us (who don't know Hebrew) need help
like that provided by Mechl Asheri (who is at home in both Hebrew and
Yiddish).  I would also draw attention to Shimen-Elye Shema Koleynu's
mistranslations (in Der Farkishefter Shnayder).  They are not at all clever.
Shimen-Elye is (in some ways) Tevye's cracked-mirror image.

Incidentally, as to Mechl Asheri's assumption that I know what his reference
means: I deserve maybe half the compliment, maybe less.  Further, this is how
I understand his comments which read "And that goes to show what I've been
saying all along: you can have Idishkayt without Idish, but you can't have
Idish without Idishkayt -- at least not the kind Sholom Aleichem writes".

That seems to say that only the religious life can provide a suitable
perspective for Yidishkayt.  Am I right?  For some that may be true.  I
cannot agree with it as an absolute.  We are no doubt a pluralistic and
individualistic group, and I celebrate that.  Ale brengen zeyere zakhn, fun
zeyere eygene kukvinklen.  Mir hobn fun vos tsu trakhtn, amol fun di
tifenishn, un s'iz a fargenign farn moykh, vos makht freylekher afn hartsn.

Yiddishism and Yiddish literature (both in Europe and Amercia) flourished in
a largely secular arena, but not exclusively.  At the same time it should be
noted that efforts in America (1890s and early 1900s) to absolutely disengage
Yiddishism from Judaism didn't work.  See Gerson Winer's article, _ The
religious dimension of Yiddish secularism_, in  Judaism: A Quarterly Journal
of Jewish Life and Thought, Winter 1992 v41 n1 p80-95.

Subject: "A keselgarten!"

Hershl Hartman disagrees (6.221) with an earlier post by Charlie Millman
(6.208) regarding the pronunciation of "keselgarten" or "kestl garden":

   Not quite.  Convinced that much of the immigration process was
   dominated by those who preceded them, the Yiddish-speaking immigrant
   flood at the turn of the century quite naturally and simply concluded
   that New York's reception center was named _kestl gartl_: a belted
   box or a belt for a box. Makes sense: immigrants were detained
   (boxed-in and "belted") there.

And as evidence he offers a line from _Motl-Peysi dem Khazns_.

I'm not sure from this whether khaver Hartman means that "kestl gartl" was
yet another nusekh or _the_ nusekh.  If the latter then it's my turn to
disagree.  For "keslgard" (or some variant thereof) was how I heard my family
and others refer to the place.

But one name or five, the more interesting question is how and why "keslgard"
got to have such a long post-mortem career.

Consider: my mother was 7 years old when Castle Garden ceased to be an
immigration center in 1890.  Some 30-odd years later she arrived in America.
To the child (me) she describes the arrival at For years afterward she talked
of her misadventures in "elisAYlond".  And for those same years she talked
about the advice she got when still in Europe: "ven di kimst un in keslgard
zolste zugn/tin azoy un azoy..."

I heard her too often to be mistaken about the names, particularly because I
erected my own childish notions about the awesome keslgard. Since I knew
where Ellis Island was it followed that keslgard was a way-station in Europe,
a redoubt on the river Rhine complete with guards wearing Kaiser Wilhelm
moustaches.

Blaybt fort a kashe: thirty years closed down and people in der heym still
didn't know about Ellis Island?  Of course they did.  Why then retain the
older name? Veys ikh nisht. Maybe because "keslgard" sounds germanic and
carries at least vague associative meanings and "elisAYlond" is an empty
name?  Or was the free and easy tradition of Castle Garden--whereby everybody
just walked off the boat--a happier one than the prospect of uniformed guards
segregating the steerage passengers for a further selektsie?

Maybe.  Then again, is such a thing unique?  How many New Yorkers call Sixth
Avenue the "Avenue of the Americas"?
