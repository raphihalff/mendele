Subject: Yekke in Yiddish

I just returned from Israel where I happened to read an article on Yekkim
in Eretz magazine, the monthly publication of the Israeli Society for the
Protection of Nature (Autumn 1993 issue, pages 29-33).

The article says"...the orgin of this name (yekke) is not known for
certain. Apparently, the Jews of Eastern Europe used it even before it
became popular in Israel {in the 1920s & 1930s}. It may relate to the
jacket (yakke in German) that was worn by the Jews of Germany. One
Israeli theory is that yekke is an acronym for yehudi kasheh havana
(Hebrew for "slow-witted Jew")...

The Jan.-Feb. 1994 Eretz magazine contains a letter to the editor on page
70 stating: "...I learned that yekke is derived from the old German word
Geck, which means "fool."In the Middle Ages, bishops and kings employed
fools, who were allowed to tell the truth. In the area around Cologne,
the word is pronounced "Jeck." This area is famous for a very special
carnival, and everybody involved is called a yek...considering the
"strange behavior of the German Jews after coming to Palestin/Israel, it
may well be possible that this word was applied to them..."

Do any Mendele readers have any more knowledge about the origin of the
word yekke, and does Yiddish literature mention the yekke? Did East
European Jews use the word yekke, and if so, for how long has it been
used? Was iit a way of answering the German Jews who called their
Yiddish-speaking brothers and sisters to the East "Oost Juden?"

Subject: "zhibe"

A student of mine recently heard the Yiddish word "zhibe" which is said to
mean something approximating hair coming down over the forehead. We've
found at least one Yiddish speaker who knows the word, so it appears to
be real Yiddish. The question arises, where does it come from? The /zh/
seems to clearly indicate a Slavic origin, but checking standard Russian,
Polish, Belorussian, and Ukrainian dictionaries reveals nothing. I
haven't checked dialect dictionaries yet. Perhaps some Mendelnikes/
Mendelnitses either know the term and/or know its origin.  Thanks.

Subject: Letters of Sholem Aleichem re: Tevye

First, grateful acknowledgment to Varda Ullman Novick for telling me that
my previous translations helped answer a family question revealing that
her grandmother was born and grew up in Boyarka, near Kiev.  Letters show
that Sholem Aleichem resided in Boyarka for many summers.  At least as
early as May 1889, as late as Aug. 1905.

Now, the series of Sholem Aleichem letters to Mordecai Spector re:
preparation of the first Tevye story: Tevye Der Milkhiker.  Letters
three, four and five follow:

Letter three.

     The third letter to Spector is dated Kiev, October 20.  It is in the
form of a contract detailing conditions both parties are to meet once the
promised piece is delivered.  Sholem Aleichem added the stipulation that
he may give away copies of the work to friends and acquaintances whenever
he wishes.  It is signed both as S. Rabinowitz and "my pseudonym, Sholem
Aleichem."

Letter four.

Kiev, November 4, 1894.

Dear Colleague!

     I understand you must be at your wit's end.  I'm writing to put your
mind at rest.  Be calm.  A few more days must pass.  The piece still
needs a little more polish.  It's not so easy to let a piece of work
leave my hands.  My legacy from the Zeyde Reb Mendele (may he live and be
well) teaches me that a work must be finely honed...  A little patience!
Your Sholom Aleichem.

Letter 5.

Kiev, November 7, 1894.

Dear Spector!

     See how after all I behave like a mentsh toward you.  For now, I
forward the first half of the narrative; the secretary is still at work
copying the second half.  He'll finish by tomorrow or the day after, then
I'll check it over and send it on to you.

     I send it because I believe you that a big congregation awaits me in
shul.  I hate to make the public wait.  So get ready to set the type, and
for God's sake send me the proofs as we discussed.

     Tell me, how do you usually deal with the censor?  Do you send
manuscripts or proofs?

     Answer me this very moment.

Your most devoted Sholom Aleichem.

Louis Fridhandler.

Subject: Dictionaries, again

This may have already been asked and answered, but I thought it would be
worth a try anyway.

I'm trying to locate for a friend who knows some Yiddish but can't read
it in the Hebrew script a Yiddish-English, English-Yiddish dictionary--or
either half of that.

Does anyone know whether such a thing exists?  I recall something of this
sort, but I can't put my finger on it.
