Subject: Pupiks

I am grateful to Shleyme Axelrod for providing me with the Rosenfeld
parody of T S Eliot's The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock. I agree with
him that the high point (or one of them) of Rosenfeld's poem is the 'Ikh
ver alt, ikh ver alt/ Un der pupik vert mir kalt/. It goes on: 'Zol ikh
oyskemen di hor/ Meg ikh oyfesn a flom ?/ .(Igelfeld has a slightly
different version 's'vert mir in mein pupik kalt'). Eliot has no
pupik-equivalent - whatever that might be, but 'I  grow old ... I grow
old .../I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled./    Shall I part
my hair behind ? Do I dare to eat a peach'.

The question is why should this be so apt and so funny ? I don't know of
another language in which such a translation - bringing in a pupik -
would be as hilarious. Rosenfeld is also providing a critical comment:
Eliot/Prufrock does have a serious kalte pupik problem. Timidity and lack
of physical presence - and clearly  (male ?)erotic force  are what
Rosenfeld's Prufrock's pupik is about. It is here - and elsewhere - a
euphemism, and diplacement, and what with the Kessler, Sweet, etc
anatomical interventions I am surprised that pupiks haven't  come up
sooner. There is certainly no real equivalent in English for 'pupik', one
reason why it is one of the few Yiddish words my children ever
learned.(Is it as common in childhood talk in other languages ?)Are there
(Eastern ?)European languages (Polish ? Hungarian ? Ukrainian ? Russian
?) with similar semantic associations ? The sound of the word
contributes, but there must be more than that. What are these
associations ? I assume 'pupik' is borrowed from a Slavic language.There
are - but, not, I would guess, in Yiddish-related material which seems to
be largely verbal not visual -  iconographic ramifications ( why Adam and
Eve did or did have navels in various renaissance paintings, the 'tree of
Jesse', lotus-in-the-navel (padmanabha) Indic traditions, etc.)

I would like to know what Yiddish idioms, sayings there are  with 'pupik'
in them. What comical routines does anyone remember (in English , Yiddish
) - Mickey Katz ? - along these lines ? Also wider semantic involvements
in the world's languages (Matisoff, Vishvanath ?), parallels, if any, in
Hebrew ? Talmudic allusions, etc Also (Sander Gilman ) psychoanalytic
connections. Enough. Thanks.

Anshuldig mir--

Khob fargesn a shtruneh fun Leybish Carroll's Yomervokhetz.
Insert the following stanza before "Eyns tzvey, eyns tzvey..."
(I posted the rest of the poem yesterday)

B'shas er shteyt in gedanken oyf
Dem Yomervokhetz mit eygeneh geflamben
Mit vifik durkhen tulgen vald, geburblt bas geflayngen.

This occurred to me some hours after posting the rest of the
poem yesterday evening.  HopefulSorry...

Subject: Rofn, rufn, dative or accusative?

Yonah Moshe Lakin of McGill asks about the case used following rufn (I
transliterate it so, not rofn).  When rufn is used in the sense of
calling someone by a name, or paging someone, it takes the accusative
case.  However, in Yonah Moshe Lakin's example "rufn" is used not in that
sense.  Rather it is used to mean ringing on the telephone.  Weinreich
prescribes the dative for the object of "telefonirn."  On the other hand
"clingen," which can mean the same, can take either the accusative or
dative. It's optional.  Perhaps, by extension, "rufn" when used to mean
to telephone may take either case.  Ikh bin nisht keyn groyser meyvn af
gramatike, ober ikh volt gemeynt as men hot take a breyre: oder dir, oder
dikh.  One of Sholem Aleichem's Railroad Stories is entitled "Ruf Mikh
Knaknisl."  Here, the accusative is correct.  Incidentally, the story is
one of the Ayznban Geshikhtes, volume XXVIII of the Folksfond Oysgabe.
Two translations are available.

I grew up in Montreal where all my higher education was at McGill.  It's
been a long time, and the campus has changed radically.  In my time, the
very thought of Yiddish studies at McGill would be as logical as
expecting the editor of "der keneder adler" to be chosen Governor-General
of Canada during a speech over the BBC in Yiddish by His Majesty King
George V. Foyglmilkh.  I'd like to hear more about the Yiddish program at
McGill.  I hope it is prospering.

Subject: Prufrock

I sent my father the Prufrock via Jerry Lettvin quote.  Since he and
Jerry are good buddies, I thought he might confirm it with Jerry.

Here is his (my father's) answers:

J Y Lettvin says the excerpt is from Isaac Rosenfeld's translation.  It
was never published BUT maybe Saul Bellow has a copy.  It begins
   "Nun zhe, komm zhe, los uns gehen
    vo die Obend shtait unter den Himmel
    wie a Golem an Tishe Bayov  (bwhov?)..."

The second line of Igelfeld's quotation should be
    "und mein pupik ist mir kalt"  according to JYL

Subject: Shmushkele

(a) The derivation of "shmushkele" from "smutshik" (or "smotshek", Polish
"smoczek", etc.) has been challenged by some, apparently because [sm]
does not normally become [shm] in Yiddish.  But this emphasis on the
initial consonants raises the question in my mind whether there might not
be a relation between "shmushkele" and "shmuts".

(b) In any case, I am unfamiliar with the word.  In my family, there was
another expression used affectionately to refer to a female infant or
child; it sounded like:  "aza kadilik!"  I have no idea what it meant.
Can anyone help?

Subject: Various

I'm trying to absorb ten days' worth of "Mendeles". It's getting to be a
more and more difficult job, borekhashem.

In due course, I will try to provide as comprehensive as possible
explanation of where "we stand" withg respect to the Groyser Verterbukh
fun der Yidisher Shprakh. Money is only part of the problem.

A word to Bob Hoberman: Try also: Am ta:nis ester, am Purim fres(h)ter. A
query for Rick (Henekh) Gildemeister: Do you have any idea of the
etymology of one of the words you used: "ze(:)g(e)"? Do you know the
expression: "shtike, di zeygestn shmeyet"?

Mikhl Herzog.
