Subject: Re: Counting Rhymes

Not exactly a counting rhyme, but here's a cheer my Dad created for
some kind of Purim competition my Hebrew school class was involved
in lo those many years ago...

	Two goes inta four
	Four goes inta eight
	Heh Team! Heh Team!
	Geh gazinta hayt!

I leave it to the transliteration mayvens to come up with the
correct Roman lettering. :)

Subject: the yiddish-vietnamese connection

noyekh, that's wonderful! i'm going to look for the recording here.
thanks! as to how it might have happened, here's one possibility. i
know of at least one russian song and one romanian song both
recorded by a (predominantly) yiddish singer that turned up as
french songs in the '50s: the russian  'pomn'iu, pomn'iu' turned up
in french as 'le galerien' and the romanian song 'el trineo' turned
into 'johnny, tu n'es pas un ange'. so we know that some eastern
european songs were known to some french songwriters. ok, now
vietnam was a french colony for a long time, the vietnamese must
have heard french songs. so my hunch would be to check whether this
particular yiddish song had a french version during the period of
indochina...

Subject: freg/frog
For Roslyn

You're saying:

in mayrev yidish iz geven der substantiv "frog" un in mizrakh yidish
iz geven der substantiv "freg" vi lemoshl ton a freg (oykh ba
Mendelen)

1. Why geven? "freg" in mizrakh yidish is still in use.

2. In what other turn beside ton a freg do you find it? and what is
the plural of this substantive?

In my view this is not a real substantive but an ad hoc stem derived
from the verb, just the "substantive" koketir is derived from
koketirn, and is to be found nowhere outside the
`stem-constructiuon' (Shekhter's term). These "substantives" have
some particularities of behaviour. Some of those I explained in my
paper "The development of aspectual auxiliaries in Yiddish", Word
1987.

Best,

Moshe Taube

Subject: Daytsh ba' Litvakes

Berl Hoberman pointed out correctly (mendele Vol. 3.183) that Lite
had a border with ostproysn (Germany). Stupid of me to forget.

After all, which Jew in poyln or lite was not an expert on German?

Like the Rov who travelled on a boat and was welcomed aboard by the
Captain in his best German. At which the Rov told his shames "gey
zog dem kapitan az ikh farshtey nor daytsh"

Or the German who was accused (in Lite!) of stealing a horse. Since
the magistrate spoke no German, who better to interpret than a Jew?

Judge: Tell the accused that he is on a charge of stealing a horse.

Interpreter (to German): der odn zogt az du host gelakhet a sus.

German: Was?

Interpreter repeats: der odn zogt az du host gelakhet a sus.

German: Ich verstehe nicht.

Interpreter (to Judge): der goy iz nisht nor a ganef - er iz a
ligener oykh. er iz bkhlal nisht kayn daytsh.

So presumably there are very few yiddish speaking regions which were
a significant distance from the (vast) German speaking empire of the
19th century. In which case it is hardly surprising that there is a
strong modewrn German influence on yiddish. After how long has
yiddish been spoken in America, and look at the influence that
English has had there. I suppose everyone has heard the story  of
the immigrant who (having forgotten? fenster) said "khvoyn shoyn
draysig yor in ameyrike un khveys nokh als nisht vizoy mzogt 'vinde'
oyf english".

That's different.  That's:
	patshi patshi kikhelekh
	di mame vet koyfn shikhelekh
	der tate vet koyfn zekelekh
	far <baby's-name>'s fisalekh

I've heard several variations.  We do this with our kids.
(Well, our youngest is almost 3 so we don't do it much anymore.)
