Subject: Yiddish, thousand year old language

Dovid Katz says Yiddish is a 1000 year old language.  Does any of the
original vocabulary survive?  How has the sentence structure changed?

Subject: Gikh

While on the subject of gikh, another nice expression with this word
which I did not see mentioned is "af der gikh."  It means quickly, "on
the double."  What is the gramatical history of this phrase?  Is there a
Germanic basis for it, or is this a Slavic formulation?  Does modern
German have a comprable formulation?  Another Yiddish synonym for quick
is /flink/.  What other expressions of speed and associated shprikhverter
are there?  For slow, I can think of pameylekh and pavolye, as well as
the daytshmerizm langzam.  Are pameylekh and pavolye differentiated?

Subject: Welcome

According to Uriel Weinreich's dictionary, the English welcome! may be
expressed two ways: "Borkhabo/Brukhabu" and Skotsl kumt.  I once spoke
with YIVO librarian Zachary Baker about the latter expression.  He
informed me that /skotsl/ was in fact a contraction of something like
"vos Got zol..."  and this form of greeting was generally used by a man
when welcoming a lady.  I don't think that I have ever actually come
across Skotsl kumt in reading or speech.  Has the form died out in
practice?  Is it gender neutral?  Is it reserved for the singular or can
it be used in the plural?  Is it formal or informal?  I welcome any
information on this unique Yiddish expression.

Subject: Kibitz/Doktoyrim/Shem-Hitl

Berel Leiser wonders about the origin of "kibitz", after a discussion of
"kibbutz" and "kabtsn".  Klein's Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of
the English (sic) Language has the following entry:

kibitzer, n. 1) looker-on at a card game; 2) a meddlesome person. >From
the German _Kiebitzer_(slang), 'a looker-on (at cards)', fr. _kiebitzen_,
'to look on', fr. _Kiebitz_, 'pewit, plover', whence arose the meaning
(used only in slang) 'a meddlesome looker on'.  The birdname _Kiebitz_
derives fr. MHG _gibiz_, _giwiz_, which is of imitative origin.

Further to the thread on the plural of dokter:  I am now wondering the
origin of the 'oy' in doktoyrim?  (Go ahead, take a cheap shot!)  I
imagine the pattern might be along the lines of kodesh-->kdoyshim, but
why dafke that pattern instead of, say, redakter-->redaktorn?

Lastly, regarding Kalman Weiser's inquiry about the origin of the
expression "zikh oyston dem shem-hitl", my guess is that it comes from
the old Yiddish (folk?) story about the ganef who was hiding in a crowd
when his wily pursuer shouted: "Afn ganef brent dos hitl!"  The ganef, in
a panic, grabbed at the hat on his head, thereby revealing his identity.

Subject: Malka Heifetz Tussman

To add to Jasha Kessler's moving tribute to Malka Heifetz Tussman, I'd
like to say that there has been and is being more attention paid to Malka
than he mentioned.  I had the privilege of being Malka's student (or
"pupil" as she liked to say) and friend from 1976 until h her death in
1987.  During my years as a doctoral candidate at Stanford University, I
worked with her every Friday, reading, translating, shmuesing, eating,
laughing, crying  -- all centered around Malka's great love, Yiddish
poetry.

During those years, I should mention, Malka showed me Jasha's
translations of her poems with pride and spoke of him with affection.
Since then, though, a number of other people, including myself, have
published translations of Malka's poems and have written about her: My
translations of her poems were published in Benjamin and Barbara Harshav
(eds) _American Yiddish Poetry : A Bilingual Anthology_ (U. California
Press, 1986); also in _Yiddish_ (No. 7, 1988, Queens College), and other
journals and books.  I also have dealt closely with a number of her poems
in scholarly/critical articles which appeared in in *Der pakn-treger*
(Fall, 1987), _Handbook of Jewish-American Literature_ (ed. L. Fried,
Greenwood Press, 1988), _Parable and Story as Sources of Jewish and
Christian Theology_ (eds. Clemens Thoma and Michael Wyschogrod, Paulist
Press, 1989), in _Studies in Jewish-AMerican Literature_ (Fall, 1990), in
_Gender and Text in Modern Hebrew and Yiddish LIterature_ (eds. N.
Sokoloff, Ann L. Lerner, Anita Norich, 1992), in _Encyclopiedia of Jewish
American History and Culture_ (eds. Jack Fischel and Sanford Pinsker,
Garland Press, 1992), in _Oxford Companion to Women's Writing in the
United States_ (1994).  Am currently writing on Malka, as well.

One must note Marcia Falk's  important book of translations of Malka's
poems, _With Teeth in the Earth_ (Wayne State U. Press, 1993).  Marcia
Falk also has published articles on Malka in Lilith (I think),
translations in American Poetry Review, article in _Shofar_, and her
translations were included in Irving Howe, Ruth Wisse, and Chone
Shmeruk's _The Penguin Book of Modern YIddish Verse_ (1987).

The late Yiddish translator of French poetry and critic, M. Litvine,
wrote a beautiful essay on Malka in Di Goldene Keyt; and I think that A.
Sutzkever wrote a strong  essay of appreciation after Malka died (in Di
Goldene Keyt, which he edits).

Another friend and student of Malka's Daniel Marlin, of Berkley, has
published some of his translations of Malka's poems, too.

And I have recently been in touch with a grad. student at Ohio State
University (Lisa Jenschke) who happens to be my _feder-fraynd_ who told
me that she intends to write her MA thesis on Malka's poetry in
comparison with Elsa Lasker Schuller's poetry.

This list is an informal (off-the -top-of-=my-head) list, not a complete
or scholarly list of works on Malka Heifetz Tussman.  Please pardon
the typos.

And thanks to Jasha Kessler for bringing up Malka's name and work. zayt
mir gezunt,
