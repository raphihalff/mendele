Subject: Hermetically sealed communities

In recent Mendele postings, there's been talk of pre-Holocaust Jewish
communities as hermetically sealed from the surrounding non-Jewish
world. I beg to differ. This is an especially important point because it
plays into stereotypes of pre-Holocaust East European Jewish life that
seem prevalent even among us Mendelyaner.

First of all, let's remember that by the 1930's, most East European Jews
did not live in shtetlekh but in the largest cities. So in Poland, for
example, no more than 40% of Jews lived in shtetlekh, while about 1/2 of
all Jews lived in the largest cities such as Warsaw, Vilna, Lublin,
Lodz, etc. where they made up about 1/3 of the total population. And
even in shtetlekh, they were going to Polish public schools, serving on
the town council, etc. So to speak of Jews being hermetically sealed off
from non-Jews in such situations clearly makes no sense.

But even in pre-modern Jewish communities it doesn't make much sense.
Look through Max Weinreich's "History of the Yiddish Language" and you
will find mountains of fascinating evidence documenting multi-faceted
interrelations between Jews and their non-Jewish neighbors. This is
important, I think, because it goes to the heart of what allowed Jews to
survive for so long, that is, what a successful diaspora culture is all
about. Diaspora is about carrying your borders with you wherever you go.
But these have to be permeable, that is, you have to let some of what's
outside in because if not you will stifle. On the other hand, if you let
too much of the outside in you will disappear. The trick, it seems, and
one the East European Jews were masters of, was knowing how to let just
enough in to adapt, to respond, to remain creative. What was allowed in
was then, of course, "faryidisht," so that, in one of endless examples,
the Ukrainian peasant song became a holy hasidic nign. So that taking --
just enough but not too much (not to mention giving, a whole other
story) from co-territorial cultures was, I would suggest, not just an
important aspect of traditional culture, but the key to its success.
This then can segue into all sorts of discussions about the
multi-cultural world we increasingly live in; that is, once again one
can do worse than learn from "undzere yidelekh."

Subject: Unions and the demise of the Yiddish theater

In the Sunday New York Times issue dated December 8th, 1996 (page City 3)
is an article written by Andrew Jacobs titled "The Last Act" and subtitled
"Voices Are Stilled at the Yiddish Actors Union."

In an associated side bar titled "The Yiddish Theater" and subtitled
"Healthy It Isn't" is a historical summary of the milestones of the
Yiddish theater beginning with 1882, when the first Yiddish production
in America opened on the Bowery, to 1996, when demolition began on
Second Avenue of the last Yiddish theater. While the writer eloquently
details the rise and fall of the Yiddish theater, he cites various
knowledgeable individuals who clearly place the blame for its demise on
the unions who, at a critical time in its history, "kept a new
generation of actors from its ranks."

I was simply wondering whether the blame can rightfully be laid at the
feet of the unions or whether there was simply a lack of the required
talent available abetted by a dwindling general interest on the part of
the Yiddish speaking public.

Subject: Nasalization

Eliyahu Juni [6.125] is quite right that nasalization in "daanges" (as
well as in "yaandes" and "kaansher" has nothing to do with "ayin"). Note
that these and other nasalized Hebrew words in Yiddish _except_ for
"daanges" have the sequence "patakh-khatef-patakh" which leads Max
Weinreich to suggest that Hebrew "d@aga" may well have been originally
vocalized with patakh-khataf-patakh as well.

Subject: Wallach

[Regarding Zev Kesselman's query (6.125):]

Wallachia was a region that, along with Moldavia to the east, became the
modern Rumanian state.  A "Wallach" (Slavic Vlach), then, is an ethnic
Romanian.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Walach in Polish

No idea about a connection, but 'walach' is a word in Polish, meaning
'gelding'. There is both descriptive (about horses) and contemptous
(about humans) usage. Letter `l' in 'walach' is `the Polish l' here,
pronounced as English 'w'. I do not know the word's origin. There is a
verb, too; to geld a horse: 'owalaszyc'.

Subject: Wallach: vayishkokhayhi

The answer to Zev Kesselman's question has to do with the practice of
playing poker or blackjack or ayn-in-tsvontsik (a yidish version of
blackjack, I am told) on khanike.

The rabbis didn't like to see youngsters whiling away their time (bitel
toyre etc.) and they probably also smelt haskolishe influences.

There are many condemnations of the practice in Chasidic literature
accompanied with the warning that there are klipes and other hobgoblins
whose sole resting place is on a pack of cards.

Shabes khanike almost always falls on Parshes Vayashev, so an acronym
was found in the last word of the sedre, 'Vayishkokhayhi'.

Velkhe Yid Shpilt Kurten or Kvitlekh KHanike Hayst Vallakh. The last
word is changed according to who was the biggest roshe in the area or at
the time. Another variation is Vasilyu and another one is plain
Vagabond.

I have a feeling that the saying originates from the yeshives in the
Carpathian/Transylvanian region where there was a strong Chasidic
influence, because the saying is popular with people from that area. I
have no means of verifying this but perhaps an historian would recognise
the names of the villains.
