funny, we called it pishe peyshe (each word ends with shwa). but i
guess this is the same shwa -> /i/ that you see in american yiddish
khale/khali, zeyde/zeydi etc. anyway, i don't remember the rules but
can ask the cousin who taught it to me. in my milieu, it was
considered a game for children, which is why it may be thought of as
a women's game--who else would play with children? btw, for what
it's worth, there was no association of the name with the verb
pishn, tho now i wonder why not. (as long as we're into this domain,
in my house the female genital organ was called the 'pishy', sort of
went with 'tushy', back vowel -> front vowel... since i had no
brothers, the male organ was not even acknowledged, much less
named.)

If you're talking about the game where cards are stacked by
consecutive values up or down, I refer you to Leo Rosten's _The Joys
of Yiddish_. He calls it Pisha Paisha (his spelling; it seems to be
pronounced Pisha Peysha) and says, if I remember (I don't have the
book handy), that the name appears to come from a nearly identical
English game called "peace and patience" or "pitch and patience",
"patience" being another word for "solitaire". Hope this helps!

In response to Leonard Pitt's question, I have no personal
experience with pishy pashy, but in my wife's family it was used to
refer to what in ENglish is called pat-a-cake, the old hand-clapping
game.

I played Pisha Poysha, as we said it, taught by my Bubba, on Second
Avenue in 1934-35, as near as I can figure it.  I can see us, the
whole other crowd, her daughters, son (my father) and others, so
many, it seemed, in the other rooms, busy at food, cards, drink,
laughter, noise, and the usual rowdiness of the same kind of Odessa
folks you will read about in Gorki's autobiography, Volume I, MY
CHILDHOOD.  Rough bunch.  But back in the kitchen, she made me
eggplant pancakes, dipped in an egg batter and fried, dozens it
seems, like the pancakes I read about later in Little Black Sambo,
and we ate, and played Pisha Poysha.  A sort of Go Fish, or kiddy
casino, as near as I can recall at a distance of 60 years.  I never
played it later, and my father used to kid me when I asked him to
play it with me, as infra dig, nonsense, etc, not fit for rummy and
pinochle players at the age of 8 or so, you see?  Beats a madeleine
any day, if you ask me!
