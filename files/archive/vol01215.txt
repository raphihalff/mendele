Subject: YIVO transcription

        The "YIVO transcription" can be found in Uriel
Weinreich's dictionary and his COLLEGE YIDDISH and also in
Dovid Katz's GRAMMAR OF THE YIDDISH LANGUAGE, with only a
few minor changes: Katz uses "j" where Weinreich uses
"dzh", and Katz distinguished unstressed inverted "e"
(shewa) from stressed "e", where Weinreich uses "e" for
both.  Weinreich uses capitals, except for the second
element in digraphs.  Essentially the same system is used
by the Library of Congress and the catalogues of most
university libraries, except the LOC distinguishes "h" with
a dot under it, for khes, from "kh" for khof.  (In order to
coincide with its transcription of Hebrew the LOC also uses
a dot to distinguish the v of tsvey-vovn from the v of
veyz, tes from tof, kuf from kof, sin from samekh, and a
grave accent for sof.)  So, the YIVO system is not only
extremely simple and easy to remember (from the English
point of view), it's quite standard.  Here it is, in
alphabetical order:

A O B V G D H V U OY Z Zh Kh T Y I EY

AY K Kh L M N S E P F Ts K R S Sh T S.

        By the way, the LOC transcription for Hebrew is
also extremely simple and intuitive; I'd urge everyone to
use it for most purposes.  For an even simpler version,
omit the diacritical dots.

        Here's the central line of my grandfather's version
of the "Daytsh in Rusland" joke, in YIVO transcription:
"der dayen (or even worse, orl) taynet, az ir hot geganvet
a sus."  Ah, another Yiddish self-deprecating joke!

[Bob Werman asks:]

i don't know the story but i infer it wasn't an innovation
in yiddish since swiss german also has /epis/ meaning
'something'. it must have been a germanic dialectal
variant, surviving as the standard in swiss german and
yiddish (and perhaps elsewhere).

maybe, but you don't have to go to the domain of incest to
see borrowed curses in yiddish--consider the venerable (and
very frequent, i believe) _kholyera_--it's from polish (and
maybe it's also the same in other slavic languages?).

perhaps for different reasons, perhaps not, modern hebrew
also borrowed important curses--i'm thinking of khara
'shit' and kusumak 'your mother's cunt', both from arabic.
the official story that i've heard is that modern hebrew
didn't have access to biblical hebrew curses, since they
weren't immortalized in the sacred texts. i'm a bit
skeptical, tho, since i'm sure the second one at least
could have been reconstructed. any thoughts?

to Hershell Bershady -- I think the expression is a
translation from the Russian -- I remember a 'dirty' song
that starts 'Tsar Nicholaev, Bit voyu mat' or something
like that.  vaf You will note that my Russian is as bad as
my Yiddish -- both pretty nil except for a few words
(probably remembered as malapropisms)./

Subject: Molly Picon

Here is my Molly Picon story. In the spring of 1968 I was
touring Israel with my husband and cousins. The old city in
Jerusalem had just become a part of Israel.  While walking
in the old city, I saw a familiar face. I couldn't place it
immediately, and assumed it was my husband's relative. My
cousin and I said hello and kissed Molly Picon. We took
pictures and I have them hanging in my home now. Molly was
visiting Jerusalem to celebrate her 70th birthday. Am I the
only one on this list to have kissed Molly?
