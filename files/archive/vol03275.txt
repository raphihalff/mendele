Subject: klezmer

As the term "klezmer" is a relatively new one to denote the genre of
instrumental music of the Yiddish speaking Jews, it's interesting to
see how it came about.

I haven't been able to locate an earlier reference to it than to the
first Hed-Arzi recordings (c.1975) of the Argentinian/Israeli
clarinetist Giora Feidman. His definition, of course, has shifted
dramatically over the years (he now claims that ALL music is
"klezmer", so long as one "feels" it...) but back then it still had
a vaguely "Ashkenazic" cast to it. Certainly, it was the success of
the California-based ensemble "The Klezmorim" which gave the term
its major frequency (c. 1976).

The linking of the terms "klezmer" and "music" -- kind of like the
growing popularity in New York area restaurants of advertising
French toast made with "Challah bread" -- is seemingly neccessary to
all those who don't know what a "klezmer" is and comically puzzling
to those who do. This "Department of Redundancy Dept." terminology
is  similar to the way the instrumental vernacular music from New
Orleans (and later, Chicago) was refered to in the early 1910s.
"Jazz music", (with the upper case "J" as it was then called) has
since lost the need for its "music" qualifier, even though the
origins of the term "jazz" (since the late 1920s spelled with a
lower case "j") has no music derivation (it's assumed to be a New
Orleans  vernacular for fornication). Musicians who played this
music were refered to (and in some places still are) as "jazzers".

Before the so-called "Klezmer Revival" began none of the old-timers
I interviewed ever thought of the term "klezmer" as denoting a
genre. They would refer to the music by its function or even tune
types (as in: playing the "freylekhs", "freylekh music" or playing
the "bulgars" or "khasene music"). Some, like Dave Tarras himself,
did refer to it--in English--as "Jewish" music, but in Yiddish
called it, of course, as "Yiddish" music. Perhaps the re-definition
of the term "klezmer"in the 1970s from its coarse and untutored
associations has something to do with the popular habit of refering
to "good" things as "bad" which was common in the 1970s.  This is
seen mostly in the country music movement (most specifically in the
Austin and Bakersfield, California scenes) with the rise of "outlaw"
C/W. This glorification of the "outlaw" has allowed the klezmer to
come to the fore as a one-time marginal personna, now endowed with a
kind of socially-marginalized musical identity (certainly "The
Klezmorim" played up the underworld associations of thier European
namesakes...)

I don't know if Feidman was originally trying to obfuscate the
ethnic derivation of the term by trying to "de-Yiddishize" it, but
it does seem take a bit of contextualization on the part of players,
fans,scholars, etc. to alert those who are not clear about its
origins that this is music of the Yiddish-speaking Jews and their
cultural descendants.

Subject: mail.yiddish archives

A number of people have asked me about the mail.yiddish archives,
which include, inter alia, all sorts of puns, ditties and other
low-class material not fit for MENDELE. (The archives also include
the original discussions between myself and Noyekh that led to the
formation of MENDELE by Noyekh.)

I've set up the archives on news.lsuc.on.ca for anonymous ftp, in
the directory "pub/mail.yiddish".  In that directory are 53 files,
numbers 01 to 53, one for each issue. mail.yiddish ran from October
1988 to March 1992.

As far as I know, this works, but I haven't set up files for
anonymous ftp before.  If you download the files successfully,
please let me know.

Subject: Crosslinguistic jokes

Ellen Prince refers to a Yiddish imitation of French "_avu tut ir a
vey..." A very similar line occurs in George and Ira Gershwin's "Of
thee I sing," in a song entitled "The illegitimate daughter." A
chorus of French soldiers sings:

Garcon s'il vous plait
Encore Chevrolet coupe
Papah, pooh! pooh! pooh!
A vous toot dir vay a vous?

(Incidentally, I suspect the "pooh! pooh! pooh!" is also from Yiddish.)

A note for Ellen Prince re: _avu tut ir a vey..._

I may be able to help you reconstruct it.  In Montreal where I grew
up, French was widely used.  A Yiddish phrase was constructed (when
or where I do not know) that was supposed to SOUND French, but was
Yiddish.  In nonsensical French, the first part might be spelled _a
vous toute dire_.  The VEY was added for effect.  It came out _avu
tut dir vey_  That is, where does it hurt you?

Subject: Gentile Yiddish

I liked what Leigh Lisker said about "Gentile Yiddish, a.k.a.
German." I'm a Gentile that speaks both, and I just want to share an
anecdote. One time I was speaking to an elderly Jewish lady, and she
said, "You know, those Germans use a lot of Yiddish words." I
thought she was referring to Mayrev fragments (a springboard for my
next posting) or loshn-koydesh words that have found their way into
German, but I suddenly realized that she meant the entire Yiddish
German component!  Men hot gekent platsn derfun.
