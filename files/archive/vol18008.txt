Subject: mukte butke

re: Matt Hoffman's "mukte bukte," I believe he means Matka Bozha, which is
the Polish pronunciation of "Mother of God," referring of course to Mary,
mother of Jesus. I assume at some point in the passion on the cross Jesus
would have uttered something like this.

Subject: Yiddish materials for holidays

Does anyone have any kind of Yiddish material related to Rosh Hashanah or
Yom Kippur? We need it for a Yiddish club in Skokie, IL.

A sheynem dank,

Subject: "Afn veg shteyt a boym" - original lyrics?

The comedic (?) version that is often sung is apparently not the original,
which was a song about yearning for the redemption. Does anyone have the
original? Thank you.

Subject: tsebalevet

Since there are relatively few Yiddish borrowings of long standing from
Russian, it is more likely that the etymon is Ukrainian "baluvaty."

Moreover, the Yiddish prefix is "tse-" (litvish Yiddish "tsu-"), not
"tser-," although it is certainly cognate with German "zer-." The standard
Yiddish phrase for "spoiled child" is "tsebalevet kind."
