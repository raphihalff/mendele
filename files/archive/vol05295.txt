Subject: Looking for a literary reference

In several of  Chagall's paintings in the current show at the Jewish Museum,
he depicts a fiddler on a roof. The docents at the museum have been told  that
Chagall may have been depicting something from a Sholom Aleichem story. Does
any know what this literary reference might be? Or if it is from some other
writer, that would be helpful. Thank you very much,

Subject: Mumps

Sorry, Zachary, your Vilna authorities are mistaken; _mandlen_ are 'tonsils'.
I'd tell you how to say 'mumps' except that Dovid seemed to suggest that
anyone who "knows" is not eligible. You have to "guess". So, let me give you a
hint. Think of what a child's face with the mumps reminds you of. Remember
that children's game involving fingers (and toes)?

Mandlen in Yiddish, as Zachary points out, but khazeret as in horseradish for
Pesekh.  A kosher, gezunt, un freylikh yontif alemen.

Subject: Mumps

Zachary Baker:

Mumps=mandlen?

I always thought that mandlen (almonds) meant "tonsils."  Is "mumps" yet
another meaning?  Mumps is a viral disease of the parotid salivary glands,
which do not look like almonds.  On the other hand (or throat), tonsils do.

Subject: Mumps (correction)

Correction:  Dovid Braun and Dina Abramowicz have informed me that "mandlen"
are tonsils, not mumps.  Dina recalls that the Russian word "svinka" was
probably the one used for mumps (at least in Vilna).

Mendel Hoffman, who is originally from Berehovo (Beregszasz),
Carpatho-Ruthenia, uses the word "shvinkes" for "mumps."

Subject: Times acrostic

In today's (Sunday's) Times acrostic the decoded message has relevance to
Mendele: The quotation is "I plan to continue as a proud Jew and a proud
American to speak out on every issue. Sha shtil did not save us from the
Nazis, it did not help Soviet refuseniks. We are full citizens and as such we
have an obligation to speak our minds." From the book "Chutzpah" by Alan M.
Dershowitz.  His use of "sha shtil" seems new to me or am I wrong?

Subject: Ikh bin mir a meydl

The verses that Bernard Katz cites sound to me like those I've heard on
record, I think by Theodore Bikel. The following text of the song is from
'Yidishe folkslider' by M. Beregovski & I. Fefer, Kiev, 1938.

        ikh bin shoyn a meydl in di yorn,
        vos hostu mir dem kop fardreyt?
        ikh volt shoyn lang a kale gevorn
        un efsher take khasene gehat.

        du host mir tsugezogt mikh nemen,
        un ikh hob af dir gevart;
        far vos zolstu, dushenyu, mikh farshemen,
        tsi hostu dikh in mir genart?

        un efsher geyt dir, ketsele, in nadn?
        di mame vet farkoyfn di shtub;
        mir veln beyde khasene hobn,
        vayl ikh hob dikh lib!

        un efsher vilstu visn mayn yikhes? --
        der zeyde iz geven a rov;
        lomir zhe beyde khasene hobn,
        un zol shoyn nemen a sof!

Subject: Du and aykh in English

Miki Safadi recently suggested that "[i]n the US, the formal address form
'aykh' is not used - 'du' is used almost exclusively," and asked "whether in
other countries where English is the dominant language, the formal and
informal forms are still used, or if only the informal 'du' is used." (Mendele
5.294).

I believe the premise of the inquiry is incorrect. The prevailing practice in
English is the reverse of the one suggested.  That is, the English word "you"
is the formal form of address, corresponding to "aykh," which is now almost
universally used when speaking to children, adults, spouses, animals, friends,
doctors or presidents.  In contrast, "thee" or "thou," which are used in
addressing the Deity, are the English equivalents of "du."  Except for their
presence in religious ceremonies and love poetry of an earlier age, "thee" and
"thou" are rarely encountered in English today.

Subject: Du and ir

It's mainly Hebrew and English monolinguals, or Hebrew-English bilinguals
(with no experience in other European languages) who have trouble with the
_du/ir_, _dir/aykh_ distinctions. On the whole, the "rules" remain the same in
America as they were. Saying _du_ to your teacher/professor, mistakenly
encouraged by some teachers, is a "sociolinguistic" error, no less (or more)
"egregious" than a mistake in grammar.

The major changes in matters of "address" probably involve direct as against
indirect reference. In my generation, in very traditional circles, one still
addressed one's parents indirectly: _Vos vil di mame_? _Efsher vil zikh der
tate avekzetsn_? Similarly, one may have avoided addressing the spouse by
name: _Her nor_! 'Listen'! or _Tsi herste_? 'Do you hear'? (Whence the
euphemism for 'wife':  _mayn tsihErste_.)
