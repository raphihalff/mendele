Subject: 1. Yakhne; 2. ets/enk

1. Gertrude Dubrovsky (8.001) suggests a possible connection between _yakhsn_
and _yakhne_. There is none. 

_yakhsn_: 'a privileged person', 'a person with _yikhes_'. Feminine
_yakhsnte_. 

_Yakhne_ is a woman's name, unfortunately stereotyped, pejoratively and, like
the pedigreed name _Yentl_, rarely bestowed in modern times. Harkavi, in his
Appendix of Names, suggests a connection between _Yakhne_ and _Yokheved_.
Perhaps, but more to the point is its probable derivation from Middle High
German _jachant_ 'hyacinth', 'jacinth' (< Latin _jacintus_ < Greek
_huakinthos_). The derivation of Yiddish feminine names from the names of
flowers is common. Take _Feygl_, for example. (SURPRISE!!!) 

2. Avromyaakov Amkraut asks about _ets_/_enk_ (add the possessive _enker_).
These words, rather than the second person pronouns _ir/aykh_ occur(red) in
Poland, westward from a point somewhat east of Warsaw, and are geographically
contiguous with their German cognates in neighboring Austria.  They are
usually associated with an imperative form that ends in _-ts_ rather than
_-t_: _kimts/gayts_, rather than _kumt/geyt_. Thus, _vihin gayts ets_? 'Where
are you going?' This _-ts_ paradigm is, historically, a "dual".

Subject: Yakhne

In responce to Gitl Dubrovsky (08.001): Regarding "Yakhne" it was very
different from Yente, it implied a person who was very coarse and
inappropriate, in other words, very uncultured. I learned my Yiddish in the
Bronx and the family spoke a very fine Yiddish, no Americanisms, and no "dirty
words" at all, not even putz.  I learned more Yiddish at Camp Boiberik , where
everything was in Yiddish and we had to write postcards to our parents once a
week in Yiddish. Any more folks out there who are Boiberikaner?  I would love
to hear from them.

Subject: Yakhne

My parents spent almost two decades in the Bronx before moving the family to
the Midwest. My parents, both Galitzianers, frequently used the term "yakhne." 
But my mother-in-law, who immigrated from Bessarabia, to Windsor, Ontario (and
never stepped foot in the Bronx), also used it.

Subject: yakhne

Gitl Dubrovsky inquires about the word "yakhne" and its affinity to the Bronx
(8.001). Although I grew up in the Bronx and "yakhne" was quite common, I
never particularly associated the two. My parents came from Lodz, but I'm
certain that the usage was much broader than that. Yakhne is: gossip, shrew,
also busybody, medler, coarse or slovenly woman, etc., all feminine and always
heavily pejorative. I cannot recall any instance of cutsey usage. ven zi hut

Subject: yakhne

I never lived in the Bronx. My family came from Poland by the way of Mexico
and moved into Detroit. My mother loved used the word "yakhne." It seemed to
designate all other women except herself. And indeed it meant a shrewish
woman. I can't say why it isn't in the dictionary, but I can assure you the
word was widely used.

Subject: ets and enk (and enker)

Avromyaakov Amkrau asks about the origin of these pronouns, to which we must
add the 2nd person plural verb ending -ts, and the answer is that originally,
in early Germanic, these were dual and not plural forms.  They do not
interestingly enough appear in any Middle High German texts that have come
down to us, but they survived in certain dialects.  There is a very small
island in Western Germany but the real stronghold is in the dialects of
Austria and Bavaria.  In all cases however they have taken over the role of
the plural.  As far as Yiddish is concerned, there is a controversy about
these.  Bob King tried to use the existence of these forms in Yiddish as an
argument for the theory he advocates (together with Dovid Katz and some
others) that Yiddish originated in Bavaria.  However, both Katz and
independently Meyer Wolf and I pointed out that the fact that these forms
occur in only a small part of Yiddish, which happens to be geogarphically
close to Bavaria and Austria suggests that they are not a feature of Yiddish
per se and of no significance for the origins of Yiddish.  Meyer and I suggest
that instead it may be reasonable to assume that Austro-Bavarian German
speakers exerted significant influence on the shaping of these PARTICULAR
Yiddish dialects, basically those of Bohemia, Poland, and some small
neighboring areas (Mikhl can certainly tell us more about exactly they occur
in Yiddish).  One last point: as I recall the German dialects usually have
forms which would be expected to correspond to *es and not ets in Yiddish, but
I believe that Franz Josef Beranek, an important scholar of Yiddish some
decades ago discussed some evidence for ets in Regensburg, Bavaria.  However,
this last point is somewhat vague in my memory.  If anybody wants, I can try
to check.

In many Austrian dialects (for instance in Ka"rnten) they use ENK for euch.

Subject: rural Swiss and Yiddish

manaster ramen: I appreciated what you wrote about yiddish linguistics but
was reminded of friends i knew years ago from a Swiss village. When the
sister, who then lived here in Berkley,  was visited by her brother they
spoke Swiss to each other that sounded very much like Yiddish.
Unfortunately, I didn't have the opportunity then to ask about their Swiss
village, but what is the relationship of rural Swiss to Yiddish?
