Subject: A footnote to Potocki

As a footnote to the Potocki stories, I recently learned from a friend in
Cracow that the family is alive and flourishing in the new Poland. The
old Graf Potocki died recently, and the current Graf has returned to
Cracow from California to restore the family palace on the main square of
the city, now that the palace has been returned to the family. (The name
has always had a personal connection for me, too, because my family came
from Uman--a part of Ukraine that belonged to the Potocki family in the
18th century.  The Graf Potocki of that time built a still-famous
pleasure garden in Uman for his sweetheart, Sofia (the Sofievka).
Whenever my grandmother wanted to refer to something as having happend
long ago, she would say:  "Dos is geveyn in Potocki's tsaytn.")

Subject: Pluperfect

I apologize for running the topic into the ground, but I am guilty of
forgetting the discussion of pluperfect and future perfect in Yudel
Mark's 'Gramatik fun der yidisher klal-shprakh' (281ff.). He provides
general geographic information on the variants of the form, considering
the pluperfect with invariant "gehat" the Central Yiddish (Polish
Yiddish) form.

Th earliest use of this form that I have uncovered is in Y. Perl's "Mayse
meyaveydas ben meylekh": "a mol iz gehat geven zeyer a sheyne nakht...".
Perl (1773 - 1839) wrote this parody of R' Nakhmen's tale after 1815,
probably before 1820. The quote is from p. 152 of "Joseph Perl, Hasidic
Tales and Letters", Ch. Shmeruk & Sh. Verses, Jerusalem, 1969.

Subject: Pluperfect

i thank meyer-leyb wolf for the references he provides on the pluperfect.
as for his question,

>Ellen Prince's question on the pluperfect ("when the current form of the
>pluperfect dates from?") might better be: who decided on the form she
>cites and when.

i'm not sure what he means. i did not presume that the form i am
interested in was the only way to express the pluperfect, in case he
believes i did. it is certainly _one_ way to express it and such things
are not 'decided on' -- they just happen.

in any event thanks for the references and also for pointing out the
similarity of the future perfect.

Subject: Hasofe

Noyekh [5.211] quotes Philologus: "az m'vil nit dem khazen, heyst er zikh
nokh gebn a hasofe", and queries the translation of hasofe as "encore".
Isn't a hasofe an additional aliye inserted into the Shabbos morning
leynen, so that the same parshe is covered in more than 7 aliyes? (Also
known as the bane of the balkore, if I can speak from experience.) I'm
not sure how that fits into the quote, however, unless the meaning is
that hasofes will delay the beginning of musaf (the khazn's traditional
major display is musaf kedushe), and thus force the khazn to speed up in
order to be finished by normal time.

[To those who don't understand a word of the above: sorry, it's
too involved to translate. Eliyahu Juni was right.]

Subject: Translation needed

David Argoff recommended that I contact you.  I have acquired a large
collection of old family letters, dated 1897-1945.  Most are in Yiddish.
I am having a hard time getting them translated.  There are too many to
consider hiring someone.  The few people at shul who read Yiddish have
shied away because I believe that much of the material may be Holocaust
related.  Mr. Argoff thought that you might be able to help.

I really appreciate any help you can give.  I think the letters may be
quite important, perhaps not just to me and my family. Thank you.

Subject: Language death

miki safadi [5.208] writes:

"Dying? No! Disappearing as a spoken language?  Yes, nebekh,..."

one little point. languages are said to die when they disappear as a
spoken language, or, more precisely, when they cease to be learned by
young children 'at their mother's knee' so to speak, i.e. in the normal
way. there are many dead languages that are in fact spoken by those who
have learned it in other ways and at other ages, e.g. latin and sanskrit.

one other semi-relevant note: something like 80% of the currently living
languages of the world will be dead in a hundred years, if the trends of
the last millenium continue. most of these are in places like new guinea
and indonesia but the forces at issue are the same all over: shift from
small tribal (ethnic) community to larger multi-tribal community, with
speakers shifting from their original tribal language to the language of
the multi-ethnic community. if anyone is interested, nancy dorian has
done some very fine research over the past two decades documenting
language death in western scotland, and i'd be happy to supply
references.
