Subject: dictionaries

I too, am very disheartened by the delay in the publication of this great
work.  As a recent inductee into learning the language of my parents and
forebears, I am often stymied by my inability to obtain enough
dictionaries to help me reading what is available.  One of the most
wonderful aspects of the language is that it is so phonetic, no matter
what the orthography.  However, the orthography does often reflect
regional variations in pronunciation.  I do feel that debates over
orthography often have their origins in dialectic differences and the
politics of the various regions at the various periods in history. Reading
M. Shechter's book, Yiddish II, one cannot help but be overwhelmed by
differences in spelling and regional pronunciations.  On the other hand,
his footnotes provide information on these regional/dialectical
differences, and so help a beginner such as I to make sense of what I read
when I read works in the original.

I applaud the sentiments of both Hugh Denman and Barry Goldstein.  I, too,
want such a dictionary (before my time is up) and in whatever form I can
get it.

Subject: Groyser yidisher verterbukh

The comments made both by Barry Godstein and Prof. Hugh Denman in Vol.
10.037 are right on target. A starving person doesn't want to wait until
others argue ad infinitum whether the fish should be pan fried or cooked
over the fire--it even could be eaten raw. Perhaps a little more of an
outcry will be enough to get the movers and shakers to start moving and
shaking. -- mit frayndshaft,

Subject: Yiddish Dictionary

I am writing in response to Gershon Winer's recent posting concerning the
Great Dictionary of the Yiddish Language, a project with which I was
associated for some years when its headquarters were located at Columbia
University.

What is the basis for Winer's claim that orthography, and not funding, is
the major obstacle to publishing new volumes of the dictionary? Who are
the people who are making it into an obstacle? Toward the end of his
notice, Winer writes: "Fearing that plastic surgery on the existing
dictionary will evoke a wave of criticism in Israel and abroad, the
present solution appears to be-keeping the project in deep freeze." Who is
the agent in this sentence? That is, WHO fears the repercussions for
publishing a new volume of the dictionary in YIVO orthography, instead of
the orthography of Volumes I-IV (which is what Winer means by "plastic
surgery" here)? It is true that orthography was an issue in the 1980s when
the project was receiving significant funding from the National Endowment
for the Humanities. What reason is there to think that this is still an
issue?

Subject: A strong case of confusion of the genus Allium.

In TMR volume 04.015 L. Prager writes:

Regarding the Rebbe of Lakhovitsh's saying, Assaf points out that "Kotik
wrote:  'az es iz faran a bazunder eyver [alef, bet, reysh] ba a idn, vos
hot nor hano'e fun tsibele um shabbes' [p. 16].  Now, _eyver_ means
'penis', but this is not just a dirty joke!  According to the sages, Ezra
ha-Sofer made this rule of eating GARLIC on Fridays to improve sperm count
(the Talmud recommends that scholars have intercourse on Friday night).  
So, Kotik has probably confused the onion with garlic, and made this
mistake, or maybe he understood Hebrew _shum_ to mean 'onion'?"  Assaf has
a strong case regarding confusion of onion and garlic, since the onion's
aphrodisiacal qualities were said to be second only to those of garlic.  
Also, the onion and garlic belong to the same genus Allium.

It is clear from the context that Kotik is speaking about onions and not
about garlic and that he is quoting his father. May be his father
misquoted the Rebbe of Lakhkovitsh or may be the Rebbe of Lakhkovitsh
misquoted Ezra ha-Sofer, but it is most unlikely that Kotik misquoted his
father or that his father told the story in Hebrew and that Kotik Junior
understood Hebrew 'shum' to mean onion. Interersting as Assaf's comment
may be, it hardly relates to Kotik.

Subject: Shomer revisited

Review by an experienced editor not only helps hone a contribution but
teaches valuable lessons to the contributor.  So it was with my
translation of Ravnitski's memoir about Sholem Aleichem (TMR 4:15).  My
footnote about Shomer's writing reflected Sholem Aleichem's vigorous
attack on Shomer (pseudonym of Nakhem Meyer Sheykevitsh) rather than a
balanced view.  Leonard Prager suggested a modification, and I agreed,
because he informed me that there is a body of scholarly work, mainly in
Hebrew, in which Shomer's contribution to Jewish literature has been
re-evaluated and found to be respectable in many aspects.  I can't read
Hebrew, but there is a Yiddish book by Shomer's children which adds to his
defense (_undzer foter shomer_ by Rose Shomer-Bachelis, ikuf farlag,
1950).  I have owned it for some years, have read some of it, but only
recently paid special attention to the following ink inscription on a
flyleaf: tsu mayn libn un trayern fraynt kalman marmor, rose shomer
batshelis.  Then, in English, Los Angeles, Cal.  May 31, 1950.  The
pseudonym had become the family name.

Despite their father's continuing success in America after Sholem
Aleichem's attack of 1888 (shomers mishpet), the family was still pained
more than 60 years later.

A Morgn-Zhurnal, 1940 Yiddish article by Yankev Glatshteyn (undzer
elter-feter shomer) defending Shomer is reprinted in the book (pp.
223-227).  This was to commemorate Shomer's 35th yortsayt.  I'll translate
the first paragraph because it sets the tone and displays the power and
charm of Glatshteyn's style.

(Glatshteyn writes)  When Sholem Aleichem pronounced his stern judgment of
Shomer in 1888, he surely must have thought he had completely eradicated
Shomer, but time is a more even-handed judge.  If not for this judge,
writers would simply eat each other alive.  The even-handed judgment of
time, however, transforms the untamed literary jungle into a serene
zoological garden; and each writer receives his due recognition.

Glatshteyn was right.

I also want to indicate an error in an anecdote told by Rose
Shomer-Bachelis on p. 184.  It leaves a puzzle, and the probable
correction suggests a possibility that may be especially interesting.  
Shomer died Nov. 26, 1905.  He was in the hospital for 2 months dying of
cancer (chest pain on one side). Rose spent many hours at his bedside.  
She writes in Yiddish:

(My translation) Once I read to him the news in a Yiddish paper that
Sholem Aleichem had become ill with consumption (shvindzukht), and was
then in a hospital in Italy.  "That is God punishing him for me," my
father called out softly.  All of us in our household knew the bitterness
father felt toward Sholem Aleichem.  However, he had never talked to us
about it; but, to the writers who visited us, he had often protested
against the injustice he suffered from Sholem Aleichem.

The puzzle: If shvindzukht refers to Sholem Aleichem's tuberculosis then
that began in mid-summer 1908, when Shomer had already been dead for over
two-and-a-half years.  The reference to a hospital in Italy seems to
firmly place the event in connection with Sholem Aleichem's life after the
summer of 1908, and that must be an error.  Rose Shomer-Bachelis probably
simply displaced some facts.  Her memory of 1905, 45 years later, may have
in fact concerned news of another traumatic experience suffered by Sholem
Aleichem.  In October 1905, Sholem Aleichem and his family survived the
perils and terrors of the pogrom in Kiev.  They escaped harm by leaving
their home and hiding in a hotel.  Perhaps it was news of this ordeal that
provoked Shomer's bitter death-bed comment.  The possibility that this
detail in the life of Sholem Aleichem of 1905 was covered in an American
newspaper is not surprising but interesting.  Sholem Aleichem did not come
to the United States until October, 1906.

Subject: "Chicago Yiddish"

I have kidded with others about the possibility of something we call
"Chicago Yiddish." I'm not sure how it came to be or whether the name is
accurate, so I turn to this list for advice and council. The current
definition of Chicago Yiddish includes those words that end with the sound
"ah" (as in matzah, challah, shivah, bubah, latkah, shiksah, pushkah, and
kishkah) and are instead pronounced as "ie"  (as in matzie, challie
shivie, bubie, latkie, shiksie, pushkie, and kishkie). Yet there are other
words that seem to qualify, but for some reason, don't ("mitzvah, mikvah,
bimah, t'fillah)--or maybe they do and I just haven't heard it. Is it
correct to assume that one who pronounces Yiddish/Hebrew words in this
manner has a Chicago-area connection. I don't know, but I'd love to find
out. I assume that this form of Yiddish had its origins overseas, but
where? And why was it adopted by only one (or a few) American cities?

Please help me add words to the lists of qualified and unqualified
"Chicago Yiddish" words. I'd also be happy to hear of those who use these
same pronunciations, but have no Chicago connection. I'd like to get to
the bottom of this and share the results with any who would be interested.

Subject: Review--Performance:Yiddish Songs and Tales from the Shtetl

On October 23, at Santa Rosa Junior College in Santa Rosa, Ca., Isabelle
Ganz, mezzo-soprano, and Craig Bohmler, piano accompanist, performed
Yiddish songs for an audience of students and staff of the college and
members of the community. Dr. Ganz, who teaches voice at the University of
Houston (TX), is best known in the field of Jewish music for her
interpretations of Sephardic music, especially in conjunction with the
group ALHAMBRA. Bohmler, who has composed Operas, songs, and award-winning
musicals, is a noted Bay area pianist and conductor, as well as composer.
        
Ganz's and Bohmler's program was warm, haymish, and superbly professional,
while it made accessible songs associated with Shtetl life to many in the
audience who'd had no contact with Ashkenazi cultural traditions, let
alone the music of Ashkenazi Jews. In presenting such songs as "Yome,
Yome, zing mir a lidl" Ganz first explained the context, and then
proceeded to sing the songs in a warm, resonant, and expressive voice. The
piano accompaniment and Ganz's guitar-playing gave the songs the feel of
Yiddish and a strong taste of the shtetl.
        
For the time of the program, the Shtetl visited Santa Rosa.
