Subject: "Get 'im" in Yiddish

In regard to how "get 'em" is expressed in yiddish-In Khasidishe
Williamsburgh, if a street crime is committed, the cry "khopt im" goes up
and all hearers unite in hot pursit, bekeshas and shetlakh flying. And,
khop 'em they do! Community action has taught holdupniks and other
nogoodniks to do their business elsewhere.

Subject: Tuition reduced for on-line courses

Hebrew College has responded positively to requests that tuition for its
new on-line courses be reduced. The courses, "An On-line Tour of the
Jewish Internet" and "One Hundred Years of Jewish Short Stories" will now
only cost $45 (45NS in Israel). Both courses offer eight weeks of
engaging on-line lectures and lively discussions that you can participate
in at the time, place and pace that is convenient for you. (If you live
in the Boston area you can also take advantage of our classroom based
course, "A Hands-on Introduction to the Jewish Internet".)

This tuition reduction will have no impact on Hebrew College's policy of
providing our on-line students with technical support in dealing with
Internet questions relating to their studies.

Due to the holidays, registration will be extended to Thursday, October
26. For course descriptions and registration forms please contact Nathan
Ehrlich, nehrlich@lynx.neu.edu (Tel: 617-278-4929).

Subject: Teaching Yiddish to children

Teaching Yiddish to Children - Songs for Girls Workshop

I've been following with interest the discussion on teaching Yiddish to
children.  I found that one of the most successful ways to introduce,
reinforce, and make language enjoyable is through songs.  There are a few
Yiddish recordings  for children. The latest one is Sleep My Child, a
collection of Jewish lullabies in Yiddish [20] , Hebrew, Ladino and
English,  by Blue Hill Recordings in Boston.  And for the last couple of
years the Workmen's Circle has presented a Yiddish concert specifically
for children.  On Sunday, October 29th, 1995, I will be presenting a
workshop on Yiddish Songs for Girls: Playsongs, Ballads and Lullabies as
part of a conference sponsored by the National Council of Jewish Women
New York Section entitled _Di Froyen: Women and Yiddish Tribute to the
Past - Directions for the Future_.   Geared to those who do not speak
Yiddish, the conference will take place on Saturday evening, October 29
at 8pm at Hunter College Auditorium, and on Sunday 9am-5pm at the Jewish
Theological Seminary.  For more information on the conference, call the
Jewish Women's Resource Center of the National Council of Jewish Women
New York Section 212/535-5900.

Subject: _A Child's Longing for Home_

I've just read and reread Zellig Bach' little book of zikhroynes.  Does
the word "zikhroynes" apply to the experiences of a nine-year old?  Maybe
not. Call it what you like, it's a lovely book.  The orphaned Zellig, a
prodigy, is sent away from home to study --not in the yeshive; he's too
young for that-- but to prepare for the yeshive.  The year is 1915.  Much
younger than most boys who leave home and attached to his mother besides,
sleeping in a strange bed and eating his meals in a different house every
day (er hot gegesn teg) doesn't come easy.  At any rate one day is not
another: some hosts are jolly and friendly, others depressed and
withdrawn.  About Zellig's schooling we read (a novele!) nothing--except
that he did well at it.  But the real story is about the child's inner life,
told as a child might remember it.  Beautifully done and quite powerful,
the last two chapters especially so.  Worth reading.
