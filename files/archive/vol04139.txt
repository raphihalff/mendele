Mendele's Archives
__________________

Since by now (10/94) there's a lot of Mendele to read it's time to
focus on making it easier for subscribers old and new to work their
way through the thicket.

This document deals with (I) getting back issues and (II) searching
the files.

******************************************************************************

(I) Getting back issues
_______________________

Most subscribers simply want to get (some or all) back issues.

The best way is to download files via "anonymous ftp" directly from
Mendele at Trinity.

For those who don't have full access to the Internet and thus cannot
use ftp, it is possible to get recent files via e-mail.

I.1. Back issues via anonymous ftp

The procedure sounds daunting but isn't.  Here is how it's done:

a. Begin by typing "ftp ftp.mendele.trincoll.edu"
b. At the request for Name, type "anonymous"
c. At the request for Password, type your e-mail address
d. At the message "Guest login ok, access restrictions
   apply", type "cd /pub/mendele/files".
e. The message "CWD command successful" means that you can
   now retrieve any file you like.
   1. For a list of the files, type "dir".
   2. To download a file to your computer, type "get
      filename"
f. When finished, type "quit" or "bye".

Below is an actual log of an ftp session.  In order to make it easier to
follow, the user's input is shown in upper-case. This is for illustrative
purposes only; in actual use, stay with lower-case.

I.2. Back issues via e-mail

This is described in a later section of this document [II.2].


******************************************************************************

(II) Searching the files
________________________

There are two ways of searching the files.  The first is via the
Table of Contents file, the second is by a "string" search of the files
themselves.

II.1. The Table of Contents file

Originally compiled by Bob Rothstein, it is a list of the Subject: lines
for all issues of Mendele.  The file, which is updated weekly, is
available via anonymous ftp (see above).  The holdings are:

contents.1 (May 15, 1991 to May 14, 1992)
contents.2 (May 15, 1992 to May 14, 1993)
contents.3 (May 15, 1993 to May 14, 1994)
contents.4 (May 15, 1994 to present)

The simplest use of the contents files is for browsing.  Any file
reader will serve.

It is also possible to search for a word or phrase.  This is called a
"string" search.  There are many software packages for doing searches.
If you have one, you might consider downloading all 4 files to your
machine and doing an offline search.

Here is an example of a search for posts dealing with "theater".  The
software used was grep.exe which is in the public domain.  It enables
not only a string search but prints any specified number of context
lines.  The command was: grep -i -B10 theat contents.*  and the results
are shown below.

___________________________________________________
Contents of Vol. 4.041

2) Festival of Yiddish Music and Theater (Henry Mullish)

Any or all of these files can then be downloaded.



II.2. "String" searches of the files

This kind of string search is not limited by the (always arbitrary)
words in the Subject: line.  It searches the entire text.  You can do
this easily by sending e-mail to the Yale listserver.  The procedure is
as follows.

Please bear in mind that you're dealing with a big beheyme of a computer
that doesn't know any khokhmes, which means that you have to do things
_exactly_ as described here.


II.2.a. The heart of the matter is what is called the "job skeleton".  It
looks like this.

//      JOB  Echo=No
Database Search DD=Rules
//Rules DD   *
select
/*

This is the basic stripped-down job skeleton.  Think of it as an envelope
whose contents (specific commands that you will write) will be understood
and obeyed.  Any search command to the listserver _must_ be written
inside the job skeleton.

If you intend to do a search it is _strongly_ recommended that you copy
the job skeleton to a separate file (you might name it "zukh.oys").  You
can then edit and reedit that file, making only the appropriate changes
without disturbing the envelope itself.

Here is an example of a command to search for every occurrence of the
name Asch.

//DBlook   JOB   Echo=No
Database Search DD=Rules
//Rules DD *
select asch in mendele
index
/*

Two commands are involved: search (select) for a string and list all hits
(index).  Mail this to:

listserv@yalevm.ycc.yale.edu

and if you've done everything right back comes the following.


> Select asch in mendele
--> Database MENDELE, 12 hits.

> index
Item #   Date   Time  Recs   Subject
------   ----   ----  ----   -------
000097 94/04/29 10:32  236   Mendele Vol 3.337
000126 94/06/10 16:29  192   Mendele Vol 4.019
000130 94/06/14 13:05  175   Mendele Vol 4.023
000132 94/06/15 19:52  158   Mendele Vol 4.025
000138 94/06/19 15:05  216   Mendele Vol 4.031
000140 94/06/20 16:14  169   Mendele Vol 4.033
000143 94/06/22 16:58  274   Mendele Vol 4.036
000144 94/06/23 14:02  267   Mendele Vol 4.037
000146 94/06/24 12:02  173   Mendele Vol 4.039
000152 94/06/30 14:24  199   Mendele Vol 4.044
000166 94/07/18 12:09  180   Mendele Vol 4.061
000200 94/08/26 18:30  204   Mendele Vol 4.094


The listserver has found 12 numbers of Mendele in which Asch's name
appears.  Now assume you want to see Vol 3.337 and vol 4.031.
Back to the job skeleton.  Here's how it looks now.

//DBlook   JOB   Echo=No
Database Search DD=Rules
//Rules DD *
select asch in mendele
print 000097
print 000138
/*

Note that you write the Item # (col.1 of the index) and not Mendele's
internal names.  Send this to the listserver and back come the two
numbers you asked for.

Suppose you'd wanted all 12 files.  Then you could have written this.

//DBlook   JOB   Echo=No
Database Search DD=Rules
//Rules DD *
select asch in mendele
print all
/*

Here's how to download any desired number(s) of Mendele.  (At the
present time (10/94) the earliest available is Vol 3.241 (2/22/94).
These numbers are subject to change; decisions are entirely in the hands
of the Yale Computer Center.

//      JOB  Echo=No
Database Search DD=Rules
//Rules DD   *
select "Mendele Vol 3.243" in mendele since 91/06/01
select "Mendele Vol 4.018" in mendele since 91/06/01
print all
/*



II.2.b. More complex searches

A string search is not limited to a single word or name.
Here are a few examples of what you can do.

//      JOB  Echo=No
Database Search DD=Rules
//Rules DD   *
select <habad>or<lubavitch> in mendele since 91/06/01
index
select <bashevis>and<singer> in mendele since 91/06/01
index
/*


These examples should take care of most of your needs.  If you want
information on how to do really fancy stuff with Boolean searches, send
this message to the listserver:

info database



If you have any problems with any of this (or if you find any of it
unclear, badly-written or plain incomprehensible) please let me know.
