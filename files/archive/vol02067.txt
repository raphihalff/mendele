I've encountered this construction often in reading, and I
would also appreciate tips about its use from native
speakers. My impressions:

a) "dos" can be used as well as "es". I don't know if this
   is a dialect thing, or if "dos" is perhaps stronger?

b) It seems to add some sense of immediacy to the
   information. For instance, I imagine some one reading a
   letter with terrible news, looking up and saying Mikhl's
   example (1). Is this on the right track?

None of the grammar books that I've seen mention this
construction. I know that Ellen Prince has done work on a
related construction with "dos" at the beginning of the
sentence:

5) Dos hobn zey gefunen aykhmanen.

She translates this as "It's they who have found Eichmann."
I haven't read her article yet (sorry, Ellen :-), so I'm
hoping she'll tell us more about this.

Subject: Mazl Tov, Katz

In Mendele 2.65,

[Berl Hoberman asks what is meant by b'mazl tov.]

I think this is to be understood in the original literal
meaning of b'mazal tov, that is, "who has been born to her
with good signs in the heavens"; we are saying that we are
anticipating that all will be well for this child.

[David Sherman asks if there are Yiddish acronyms.]

What about "schatz", which besides its usual Yiddish
meaning, is the prayerbook abbreviation for Shaliach
Tzibbur (Shin Tzaddi) (the congregational prayer leader).

Subject: Mazl-tov (mendele 2.65)

The answer to Berl Hoberman's final question is contained
earlier in his post: "...who has been born to her UNDER A
GOOD CONSTELLATION...."  I know it sounds a bit odd to late
20th-century ears, but that's the literal meaning.  It's
analogous to the Hebrew "be-sha'a tova," at an auspicious
hour, used, e.g., in wedding invitations.

maybe i'm confusing this with something else, but isn't
there a big dutch director named spetters? or was it
a dutch movie? somehow i seem to recall this in my
local video store in the dutch section. i'll check and
let you know.
