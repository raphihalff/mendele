Good point.

Pardon my imprecise language. In any case, I'm still
waiting for further comments on this theory(?) that Hebrew
is "becoming" Indo-European (using the term as convenient
short-hand for your more precise phraseology).  Given your
comments re the influence of french on middle english,
would it be more accurate to say that hebrew is "becoming"
more romance?  I could sort of hypothesize why hebrew,
arabic, japanese or any other language would be becoming
more 'english-like' but why romance-like (or french-like)?

since someone asked, i hasten to translate: russian _(idi)
k yabinoy materi_ means "(go) to the [qri: your] f*cken
mother" (yabini"y being a passive participle of the verbal
root which is also heard in russian _yap_ "f*ck".

ellen prince is totally correct: the roots of the shel
construction in hebrew are found in biblical le- as a
possessive (e.g. mizor le-david), with the help of asher,
shortened to she- as early as the mishna.

arabic has also developed such a "periphrastic possessive"
with mal "property", or beta"- (whose original meaning i've
forgotten if there was one), e.g. el-bayt mali "the house
of-me".  personal nouns so far resist this construction --
but the original suffixed form of these persists in hebrew
too: bni, biti, etc., are less literary than beti, susi,
??mekhoniti.

arabic shows few other signs of indo-european-ification.  i
don't know what wexler is saying, but arabic for ex.
preserves a tolerance for "non- aristotelian sets" such as
"people and children", and also non-chronological
conjunction, as "mohammed came and the arabs were in the
dark" (meaning, pragmatically, they were in the dark before
he came). older hebrew has equivalents.  E.g. "ma nishtana
ha-layla ... mi-kol ha- lelot" (from the point of view of
english and modern hebrew, it sounds better with "from
other nights"); and "ve-atem yeda'tem et nefesh ha-ger"
meaning "because you know ... (as a result of your knowing
...)", and other examples. (if anyone wants more, i've
published a few articles on these and related issues.)
