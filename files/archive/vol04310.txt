Subject: Introduction; a tchaynik hakn

Hi, My name is Dana Keren. Like many others I heard Yiddish at home, in
Poland. My parents didn't want us kids to understand what they were
saying, so we quickly learned. I also learned German, Russian and Hebrew
so understanding Yiddish was easy. When I try to speak it, it comes out
in German. Like at least one other person, I was drawn to the list by the
command: to unsubscribe "kholile" ... I was in stitches! Well, the list
certainly brightens my days. Some people are known to me from other lists
(Rick Gildemeister - Autocat). I am a librarian at the University of
Toronto Library. I took a two year Yiddish course in Montreal and enjoyed
it immensely, although my parents' Yiddish is galitsyaner, so it differs
from the so-called "received pronounciation".

And now for my question. I often say to my young child: hak mir nisht ka
tchaynik. I know what it means and when to use it (having heard it often
enough from my mother), but my son demands a translation. I only know how
to translate it into Polish (nie zawracaj gitary) but not into English -
not without stretching it into a mini-lecture. Can I get some help from
you, learned Yiddishists? Thanks in advance,

Dana Keren

Subject: Why study Yiddish?

In reference to Joseph Sherman's question re: marketing a Yiddish
course.

May I second Kathryn Hellerstein's comments to Joseph Sherman as
justifications for studying Yiddish.  She counters two false statements
about Yiddish: 1) that it is a dead language (it still is full of life);
and 2) that it is a ghetto language (laughably false).  Both
misconceptions persist.  It is hard to understand that.  The Nazi war
against Jews and natural assimilationist tendencies are the main causes
of the rarity of Yiddish speakers, readers, etc.  Mendele is (among other
things) a tool for successfully averting a coup de grace.  The coup de
grace threatens to come from those misconceptions so destructive to
Jewish (not only Yiddish) continuity.

Another asinine and offensive misconception noised around about Yiddish
is that it _should_ be forgotten because it was spoken by those who "went
like sheep to the slaughter."  That is an insult not deserved by the
helpless, disarmed, diseased, starving men, women and children herded by
heavily armed automatons.  I suggest that those who parrot such insults
consider this: it was the German soldiers and civilians who were
sheeplike in following orders.  They obeyed like sheep to go and
slaughter, to commit unspeakably inhumane atrocities.  Each one who
obeyed such orders sheepishly abandoned all hope to ever be a mentsh.
(Only Yiddish has such a word.)  We should consider ourselves fortunate
beyond our most miraculous expectations that we are in a position to
remember and advance the Yiddish culture so viciously interrupted.  To
deliberately forget Yiddish (language and culture and history) is
equivalent to pronouncing the horrible curse of yemakh shemoym vezikharom
on those who sustained that culture.  With Yiddish we enjoy and educate
ourselves while we reach back to take what they would have given us had
they had the chance.  And we follow Emil Fackenheim's 614th commandment:
do not grant Hitler a posthumous victory.

The study of Yiddish puts us in a position to do all that and more.

          LESS COMMONLY TAUGHT LANGUAGE GOPHER
================================================================

A new gopher has been established that you or your colleagues might be
interested in. Its aim is to present informatin on where where all Less
Commonly Taught Languages (all except English, French, German, and
Spanish) are taught at North American 2 and 4 year colleges, and
universities. Included is information on contact people at each
institution (addresses, phone and fax numbers).

At present we have about 250 languages (from Afrikaans to Zulu, with
entries for Cherokee, Evenki, Lao, Early Welsh, Middle Turkic, Japanese,
and Old Norse, to name a few).

We ask your cooperation in finding and bringing to our attention mistakes
and gaps in our coverage.  We continually update the information in the
gopher.

In the future, we will expand to include community education, and list
details of LCTL offerings at the secondary and elementary levels. Please
send information if know of any resources we do not list.

The Less Commonly Taught Languages Project is part of the Center for
Advanced Research on Language Acquisition at the University of Minnesota.
We are a National Language Resource Center, funded through the Center for
International Education, U.S. Department of Education.

The gopher is available at URL gopher://lctl.acad.umn.edu or by following
the path described below:

Subject: Blinde nakht/al di blinde/shvarts time

Mikhl Herzog (4.300) asked about a possible Slavic origin for the
Ukrainian Yiddish use of _blinde nakht_ for Christmas eve.  In Ukrainian
Christmas eve is called _sviatyi vechir_, lit. 'holy/sacred evening',
whence perhaps the same kind of distortion suggested by Eli Katz (4.298)
into _slipyi vechir_ 'blind evening'.

Khaver Katz's example was of the Vilna church called (in Belorussian-- or
[the now politically preferred] Belorusian) _usikh sviatykh_ '[The
Church] of all Saints', with its distortion to _usikh sliapykh_ 'of all
the blind'.   He also mentioned the Ukrainian town called in Yiddish
_shvarts time_.  It's usually known in English by its Russian name (the
fate of most geographical names from the former Russian empire or former
Soviet Union), which is Belaia Tserkov', lit. 'White [Orthodox] Church'.
The Ukrainian name is Bila Tserkva.

Subject: Lamed Vov and the term "reb"

My eyes seem to have improved for unknown reasons and I hasten to add
these bits to wonderful Mendele.

First, there was a novel published in France shortly after World War II
and translated into English in the late 50s called "The last of the
Just," by Andre Schwartz-Bart. The title should be self-explanatory to
those who have inquired about the lamed vov.  It is a painful and, as I
recall, beautiful book.  I don't know much about the author, but I gather
that his personal life runs or ran somewhat parallel to that of Moses
Hess.  If any Mendelniks know much about him or his other work this might
provide good material for discussion.

Second, on the form of address, "reb."  My father told me that _all_
adult Jewish males were called reb. This term does not simply mean
"mister," he explained.  Reb was a spinoff from Moshe Rabenu, Moses the
lawgiver and teacher, which is what all adult Jewish males are expected
to be for their children. To teach children the ten commandments, and to
enforce them, is a common duty. This is to be distinguished from a
learned man, a rebbe, who knows his way about the commentaries and, on
the basis of this knowledge, can settle disputes between members of the
community.  I don't think there's any debasing of the term "reb" when
used in the above sense. So, another 2 cents worth.

Subject: Curses and female double names

We have already received a fine response to the question about "kharomes"
as a curse:  i.e., that it's derived from "kherem"--ostracism or
excommunication.  I f anyone doubts that this is a mighty curse, I
suggest that you take a look at the vivid account of Boruch Spinoza's
kherem by the Jews of Amsterdam in Will D urant's "Story of Philosophy."
It's horrifying!

A couple of female double names come to mind that have escaped notice in
earlier postings:  Khane Zlateh and Golde D'vorah (one of the few in
which the Yiddish name precedes the Hebrew name).
