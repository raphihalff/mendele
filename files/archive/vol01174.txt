yeah, i've noticed the same thing. i think there are (at
least) two things going on. one is a general sense of
pejoration of the noun forms, as opposed to the adjectives,
as you note. my favorite are stupidities like 'female
person'.  i think the official rhetoric is that the noun
'defines' the individual whereas the adjective doesn't. as
a linguist, i find the whole thing rather silly, since one
defines words, not objects, and i don't feel any more
'defined' by being called a woman or a jew than by being
called a female/jewish person. on the contrary, the latter
make me think that there's something offensive about the
former, which i find very troubling. and that takes me to
the second point:

second, there may be, at least among some gentiles (and
maybe some jews), an association of 'jew' (noun) with
epithets like 'dirty jew'. ('dirty jewish person' just
doesn't cut it.) this has always made me even *more*
inclined to call myself a jew, rather than jewish or (gag!)
a jewish person. the same sort of thing happened in
france--after the war (or maybe even before), 'juif' was
felt to be too reminiscent of 'sale juif' (dirty jew) and
benevolent gentiles (and maybe some assimilated jews) used
'israelite'. in the past 30 years, 'juif' has made a
comeback, the point being to show that it is *not* in fact
a dirty word.

on the home front, there was a similar taboo on 'jew' in
america in the early part of this century, with 'hebrew'
being the euphemism chosen. cf. hias ('hebrew immigrant aid
society') and the ym/ywha (young men's/women's hebrew
assn).

obviously, everyone has to do what they're comfortable
with, but i believe jews who are proud of being jews should
show it by calling themselves jews, not jewish and
definitely not jewish persons. (this last one always
reminds me of the thank god now-defunct 'person of the
jewish persuasion'. i was persuaded to be a jew the way i
was persuaded to be a woman...)

megillah and meshugas are different, to my mind. there's
nothing necessarily crazy about a megillah. it's just a
long (and maybe long-winded) ultimately linguistic
object--a set of rules, a description, a story, what have
you. meshugas is not necessarily either long or linguistic,
e.g. the meshugas of college girls wearing men's underpants
as outer garments...

tsimes, for me, involves an exaggeration of sorts, an
exaggerated display or reaction, as in 'it's just a little
cold--don't make such a big tsimes out of it.'

for fuss/turmoil/..., i would use yiddish 'tuml'.

i'm not sure if this is your writing or a quote from
someone else, but the author hasn't been around the u.s. in
a while... enjoy, as an intransitive, is not limited to ny
and 'other urban centers'. on the contrary, it's all over
the country. you can fly delta airlines from atlanta to new
orleans and the flight attendant will tell you 'enjoy!' as
s/he serves you your chicken a la king... it's almost
always used for food, tho i have also seen it extended to
other things, as in the museum sign described above.
interestingly, unlike 'bagel' and 'shmaltz', which have
also made it all over the country but which are still felt
(by many) to be somewhat 'foreign', there is NO
consciousness that 'enjoy!' has any yiddish or even any
foreign origin, so far as i can tell: it is, believe it or
not, what you (?) call 'general english'. finally, i would
think the relation noted above to 'join' is purely
coincidental, i.e. there is no relation or pun intended.
the sign means simply 'visit the museum and enjoy it'. at
least, that's what it would mean today anywhere in the u.s.

Subject: Jewish vs. Jew

Dovid Braun's comment/query about the preference shown
today for saying that someone is Jewish rather than that
someone is a Jew may be part of what is acceptable for an
insider (a Jew) to say as opposed to an outsider (a
non-Jew).  The term Jew seems to me to evoke Shylock, the
"Jew of Malta" (another Renaissance play) and even Scott's
Rebecca, the `Jewess' in Ivanhoe.  My husband adds the
modern use of Jew in phrases like `dirty Jew' as also being
part of our negative reaction to the noun.
