Subject: tarelke

Dear Mendelianers,

This is my first attempt to contact lovers and knowers of Yiddish. A few
years ago I translated the book Stavisht, the yisker bukh of my late mother's
shtetl, from Yiddish to English. One of these days I shall publish it.
However, there is a word there, used quite often by people in their
reminiscences, which I have been unable to track down. The word is "tarelke".
It is obviously some kind of topographic term. It is similar to the word for
"dish." I tended to translate it as "basin," but in the descriptions of
people going to the "tarelke" it seems as if they are going uphill rather
than downhill. Mordkhe Schaechter responded to my request with the suggestion
that it was a localism. Are there any Stavishter out there who might know the
meaning of "tarelke"?  A groysn dank.

Subject: (h)oleveshke

In response to Mel Poretz' question: 

The word you seek is probably _(h)oleveshke_. I can't think of an appropriate
English lexical item. It's something like a (still glowing?), charred piece
of wood.

Subject: Yiddish as a foreign language

I had grappled with the dual status off Yiddish, not only as a native vs. 
foreign language in Israel but also as modern vs classical. I prefer to think
of Yiddish as a heritage language in Israel rather than foreign.  First
because it was brought to Israel centuries ago by pilgrims and has been used
there continuously for a longer time that Hebrew was ever revived as Ivrit.

But to look at Yiddish as a foreign language in Israel doesn't work at all,
because a foreign language would, I believe be more valued in Israel than
Yiddish. After all, a foriegn language would have with it a country and an
economy that would lend it some status. The metaphor that comes to mind is
that a foreign language is a chic Paris gown to Yiddish being mom's battered
housecoat. Of course this is not true for everyone but seems to be a common
attitude.

Subject: Yiddish as a foreign language 

Yosef Gilboa points out that 'academic' Yiddish opens the gates to the rich
Yiddish literature in the original. Well, teaching Middle English (as English
as a Foreign Language) would open the gates to the rich Middle English
literature (e.g. Chaucer). The question is:  at what point do we say it's the
modern language we want to teach, even if that makes the old texts archaic?
What would you think of a (non-English-speaking) country that taught
Shakespearean English in lieu of Modern English? See my point? (Btw, as you
may well know, Shakespearean English is Early Modern English -- and is
probably as far from Modern English as early 20th century educated Vilna
Yiddish, i.e. 'academic' Yiddish, is from turn-of-the-millenium Mea Shearim.) 

Fred Sherman asks what I see as an alternative to 'Victorian Yiddish'.  Good
question. I guess, if I were in the Yiddish-teaching business, I'd want to
start by involving the contemporary Yiddish speakers in Israel, speakers who
are living in a *Yiddish speech community*, who are raising their children in
Yiddish in a natural and non- self-conscious way, etc. I would try to make
bridges so that textbooks and dictionaries could be written that reflected
the modern language. I would try to hire some as teaching assistants and
native informants for Yiddish courses and Yiddish institutes. IOW, I would
try to find out what the language is that I'm supposed to be teaching and I
would try to make it possible to teach it. 

Luckily for me, I'm not in the business of teaching Yiddish. ;)

Subject: Reisen's poem

This is in response to the request for the text of Avraham Reisen's poem "In
Sooke" (the name of the poem is NOT "A sukkeleh a kleine", as listed in
Mendele).  It appears on page 94 in the 1951 volume of the collected poems of
Reisen, entitled "Di Lieder". However, the text there is incomplete, for the
full text, see "Anthology of Yiddish Folk Songs" published by Magnes Press,
Jerusalem, 1984, volume II, page 189.

Mention of the poem evokes a sentimental memory which I will relate after
recording the text since the one that appeared on Mendele was only the first
verse.

A sooke a klaine
Foon bretlech gemaine
Hob ich koim mit tzores gemacht;
Gedekt dem dach, 
mit a bisele schach
Un ch'zitz in der sooke bai nacht. 

Mit farzorgten gezicht
Dos ershte gericht
Es trogt mir mein veib bald arein;
Zi shtelt zich avek
Un zogt mit shrek
Der vint varft dee sooke bald ein!

Fun vint dem kaltn
Vos blozt duch di shpaltn
Mein lichtele leshn zich veel
Doch mach ich mir kiddush
Un -- zet nor dem chidush--
Mein lichtl brent roo-eek oon shteel.

And now for the personal story behind the poem.  Some years ago, my wife and
I were visiting Prague.  On the second day of Sukkot, we attended services at
the the Jubilee Synagogue on Jerusalem Street,-- a beautiful impressive
edifice in the traditional European house of worship style, with as many as
perhaps a thousand seats.  There was just about a minyan men and a few women
for the holiday service. Among them, and I don't recall whether he was
counted for the minyan, was a non-Jew who introduced himself as playwrite who
was working on the Schindler List, on the way to Israel.  There was a kiddush
in the sukkah following the service. We were seated around the table with the
leaders of the community present, when a woman, not known to the others,
asked permission to sing a Yiddish song appropriate for the occasion. She was
of course welcomed, and in a plaintive, somewhat broken voice, she rendered
this song, which I then heard for the first time. She was a holocaust
survivor. 
 
To hear the song in that setting, while remembering what took place in Prague
decades ago, the words and the melody assumed so much meaning, touching us
ever so deeply and continue to do so to the present day, as we sit in our
Sooke in Jerusalem. Here is a partial rendition in English: 
   
   The little Sooke, as I sit in it at night...
   While the winds threaten to break it all down
   And snuff out our little candle...
   I recite my kiddush, and lo what a miracle!
   My candle burns bright and secure...

Subject: Growing up Jewish on a kibbutz

I came accross the following report which I thought would be of some interest
to our khevre. I will forward it without editorial comment. 

Three year olds living in the childrens house on a kibbutz in Israel were
asked to describe what growing-up was like on the kibbutz.  One by one, each
child gave his input: 

1. You are born and then you go to live in the baby house.
2. When you get older, you move into the childrens' house.
3. When you get even older, you go to live and study at the
   regional high school.
4. After finishing high school, you go into the army.
5. After the army, you return to kibbutz.
6. You get married.
6. You have children.
7. You grow old and start speaking Yiddish.

Subject: skahbawveh or skarbawveh

Whenever I would ask about something fundamental and common knowledge in
Judaism, my father had a standard response: Doss iz skahbawveh--yehdeh. Ihd
fun a gantze vawch veysst dawss.That is a matter of common knowledge--every
every day Jew knows that. 

I never met anyone else who used the word skahbawveh. Many years ago I came
across the word in a book in English on Jewish art objects. As I recall the
author used the word skabawveh for anything that was a" traditional" art
form. 

In the COMPLETE HEBREW-YIDDISH DICTIONARY by M. TSANIN I found on page 304
the following entry: skarbawveh-shigrati ( routine, every day,custom, habit).
Can anyone give me any more information about the word skarbawveh.? 

My father grew up in shtetl Kuzmin in Vohlin gebernya, after his bar mitzva
left home to study in the yeshiva in Slonim. At age sixteen he left the
yeshiva, was a "moreh m'tukan"modern Hebrew teacher and an ardent Zionist and
some how came to Bessarabya where he taught until he was inducted into the
Tsar's army in 1900. I have no proof but I feel that theword skahbawveh or
skarbawveh has roots in the Vohliner-Podolya "pale". 

Zei mir gezint uhn loss zich herren!
