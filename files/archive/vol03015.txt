Subject: Glick (a response)

	Glick is also the last name of the composer Srul Irving
Glick, a Canadian who's wife was in one of my Yiddish classes.

	Glick composes a lot of music, some of it Jewish, some of it
even Yiddish. He's well known here in Toronto, but I don't know how
well outside Canada.

Hershl Berman.

Subject: Jerusalem Yiddish Culture Club, June Calendar

As is known, the "yiddishe Kultur-Gezellshaft" is Jerusalem's
Yiddish speaking club, with a very special level of activities and
events, including the publication of the "Yerusholemer almanekh"
(excuse my transcription but meanwhile ILAN-H has not agreed on a
standard Hebrew fix for internet - and mendele?).

Their schedule may be of practical news or at least of exemplary
interest to yiddish lovers everywhere - the capital club's doings
for June.  June may have more guest lecturers, academic friends from
abroad, but this is general high level of club, which meets year
round except in August. In part sponsored by the Municipality, their
monthly scheudle can also be picked up at Tourist Info offices.)

The following is quick abridged, translation of the June 1993
bulletin (apologies to mistrranscribed...)

Meeting place: Bet Naamat, 10 Sholem Alekhem St., Jerusalem 92148
Weekly meeting time: Monday at 5pm

Mon. 31 May, 5 p.m, Bet Naamat
  In close of the Yiddish month, a meeting with the "yiddish oditzia
in kol-yisrael" the yiddish radio staff (undzer Broadkast
djzzournalists, "aristocrats and artists of the air", each and every
one of them, an artizt.  By the way, I hear tell that they did not
tape the Sutskever evening at hebrew Univ. on Jerusalem Day, only
the prior Sutzkever party ... my mistake.  Still if you don't have
access to Yiddish radio, their shortwave broadcasts are valuable.)

Mon. 7 June, 5 p.m, Bet Naamat
  Evening devoted to Leibu Levin za'l, composer and reciter.
  Taking part;
  Yitzhak Artzi
  Meir Haratz  - the poet and close friend
  nahama Lifshitz, "zingerin and retzitorin"
  Zimra Orna, zingerin
  rut Levin, "zingerin"  and daughter

Mon. 14 June, 5 p.m, Bet Naamat
  Prof. Shikl Fishman, ... "who is among the founders of the club
in Jerusalem 22 years ago...", on "85 years since Chernovitz"

Mon. 21 June, 5 p.m, Bet Naamat
  Dr. Arthur Hertzberg, ... on "current problems of American Jewry"

Mon. 28 June, 5 p.m, Bet Naamat
  Evening with the poet Bracha Kopshtein, who will read
  Prof. Dov Noy will respond and discuss her poems
  an artistic part,
  "forssitser: Eli Beeder"

for those in vicinity able to make their Monday late afternoon
meetings, the gezellshaft is a warm and lively Yiddish place, where
the real thing can be heard from the mostly elderly native speakers.

Subject: A Short Introduction

	My name is Jay Lee and I am two courses away from completing
degrees (BA) in Germanic and Russian literature and an Area
Certificate in Russian and East European Sudies at Indiana
University.

	There are two reasons why I subscribed to Mendele.  First, I
am greatly interested in Yiddish folklore, but have had little ex-
posure to the literature.  I joined this list in hopes that I might
expand my reading list (So far I have read only Scholem Alechem,
Isaac Bashevis Singer, then branching off from only Yiddish
writings, Elie Wiesel and Bruno Schulz).  Secondly, I only have a
passive knowledge of the Yiddish language.  I understand it when I
read it or it is spoken to me, but I cannot reconstruct it or speak
it.  I hope that by reading it on e-mail, seeing it transliterated,
I might be able to turn my passive knowledge to active.

A sheynem dank,

Jay Lee
