Subject: Zemerl - Yiddish songs database

At the invitation of Inna Barmash [09.052:7] I visited the datatbase:
Zemerl - Yiddish songs [http://www.princeton.edu/zemerl]. Fraynd Barmash
deserves a hartsikn shkoyekh for diligence in compiling this admirable
resource which even in its present form is extremely useful. But why, oh
why, do so many mendelyaner still scorn the scientific (and therefore
predictable) YIVO-transcription in favour of some arbitrary mixture of
English/ German/ Polish etc. orthographies? It might seem churlish to raise
this issue in the case of many postings, but in a database of all things it
is no small aid to searching if one has some idea how a given word is to be
romanised!

Subject: Zemerl - Yiddish songs database

Inna Barmash has indicated her Web site contains lyrics, translations of
same into English, and links to sound clips.  This has a great potential for
copyright violation.  While some lyrics may no longer be protected under
copyright law, others are certainly protected.  A recent US court case has
also clarified that linking to a Web site that is in violation of copyright
by having posted on it illegaly various texts that are not yet in the public
domain, is itself a violation.  I sincerely trust that such concerns have
been carefully taken into account by Barmash and Princeton!

Zay gezunt,

Subject: patche patche kichelach

inna barmash asks for the words to the song patche patche kichelach..

This song is carried out more as a chant as one takes a baby's little
feet and gently claps them together and chants:

patche patche kichelach,
 der tate vet koifn shickelach
 die mama vet shtriken zechelach
 far der yingele ( di meydele) mit kleyne roite bechelach!.

translation:
 pat a cake little feet.
 papa will go to buy you shoes
 mama will knit socks
 for the little boy ( little girl) with pretty little rosy cheeks!
 
as one does the last lines one can lightly run ones fingers up to the
cheeks from the toes. Babies grin and wave their toes..in a way to say to
the adult playing this chanting game :" tu dos vayter und noch amol!").

Nu, go find a baby and enjoy together!.
 
Chane (Alice) Honig

Subject: ts/tsh

In response to Michael Meckler (09.050):

I am a native of Chernovtsy/Czernowitz, Bukovina, adjacent to Bessarabia. We
pronounced it "petsye" (stressed on the second syllable).

As to your second question: blondzen vs. blondzhen, Itsye v. Itshe (and
Sosye vs. Soshe, Leytsye vs. Leytshe, etc.), tsikave vs. tshikave, and many
more.

Sincerely,

Mordkhe Schaechter

Subject: ts/tsh

With regard to the "ptseh/ptshah" dichotomy, my parents ( and my brothers,
as I was the only member of the family born in the U.S. ) were born and
raised in Bessarabia.  They said neither "ptseh" nor "ptshah."  They said
"kholodyetz,"  which, I suspect, is probably derived from Russian.  I never
heard "ptseh" or "ptshah" until I married into a Litvak family.

From: Stan Levine <StanL@aiken.sc.edu>
Subject: ts/tsh

Michael Meckler asks about tsh / ts.  A linguist could explain the
phenomenon better than I.  I would simply point out that this is a common
variant, which can be observed in many entries in Harkavy's verterbukh.

I have noted a similar pattern elsewhere:  In Occitan (the language of
southern France), which is far less standardized than Yiddish, there are
consistent variations between the dialects spoken on the plains (sometimes
considered the more urban, prestigious and/or literate dialects) and those
spoken in "them thar hills" - in interior areas such as the Massif Central.
The latter consistently uses not only "ts" for "tsh" but also "sh" for "s"
and "zh" for "z" (often accompanied by "o" for "a").  This is prized by some
out of local pride or a search for authenticity, but many speakers consider
it a "hick" slurred pronunciation and consider the latter forms the
standard.

And don't forget the Yinglish (com.) "tsiken"!
