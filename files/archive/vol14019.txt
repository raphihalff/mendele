Subject: bakfolyes

I am currently translating the novel _brilyantn_ by Esther Kreitman into
English (to be published by David Paul Books in autumn 2005). I have had
some great help from various people in finding the correct English
equivalent for words connected with the diamond trade, but so far nobody
seems to know what exactly "bakfolyes" means. She describes the small-time,
minor diamond dealers as being those who deal in diamond-powder and
"bakfolyes", and at one point she describes one such dealer poking through a
little heap of it, trying to find tiny diamonds in it. She says that it
looks like a pile of loose tobacco. I think this is the waste or leftovers
from the process of either digging out the diamonds, or cleaving a rough
diamond, but I am not sure and would be absolutely delighted if someone
could tell me a) what exactly it is, and b) what the correct technical term
would be in English.

Joachim Martillo [http://shakti.trincoll.edu/%7Emendele/vol14/vol14.018]
refers to "Karaite Jewish Tatars."  It should be stated that Karaites are
not, in fact, Jews, but rather a sect that parted company with Judaism
centuries ago.  Traditional Judaism does not view them as Jews; le-havdil,
the Nazis did not even view them as Jews. I am not clear on how they view
themselves.

In answer to Aaron Taub's entry oct.22 [vol.14.017], there is section on
Esther Frumkin on pp.261-264 and p.269 (plus 2 rare photos) in Prof. Dovid
Katz's new book _Words on Fire: The Unfinished Story of Yiddish_.

Regarding Raysn, [http://www.shakti.trincoll.edu/~mendele/vol14/14.017],
Prof.Dovid Katz published 2 articles in the Forverts in 1996 summarizing his
own research on the word  (details at
http://www.dovidkatz.net/bibliography/bibliography1996b.jpg) A map showing
the region appears on p.55 of his _Lithuanian Jewish Culture_ (2004),  and
there is more discussion of the name on pp.54 and 254 of the same volume.

[A portion of Hugh Denman's post in
http://www.shakti.trincoll.edu/~mendele/vol14/14.007 was inadvertently
omitted. Mendele apologizes for the error.]

Reussen was the old German term for Russia, but in Jewish usage, and in its
Yiddish form "Raysn", it's meaning was restricted to those parts of Russia
accessible to Jewish migration since they lay in the the Grand Duchy of
Lithuania and not in the Muscovite lands from which Jews were excluded, i.e.
White Russia (meaning Western Russia, according the the scheme of chromatic
designations of points of the compass which the Slavs had borrowed from the
Mongols. n.b. this has nothing whatever to do with the political terms
"White Russian" and "Red Russian" that came to designate the opposing sides
in the Civil War).

Can anyone help me ascertain the birth and death dates for William Edlin,
editor of `Der Tog' in the 1930s?  Please cite your source[s] in any
response.  Thanks!

Subject: Online Guide to the Papers of Jacob Pat, 1935-1948

Back in 1994 [http://shakti.trincoll.edu/~mendele/vol04/vol04.030], a
regular contributor mentioned and excerpted  from the 1954 book by Jacob
Pat, _shmuesen mit yidishe shrayber_, as part of an ongoing  discussion on
Y. Y. Trunk.  At that time, a decade ago, relatively little was known about
Pat outside of small circles. I am happy to report that at the Tamiment
Library/Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives, at New York University, there is
now a collection of Jacob Pat's papers.  A rather decent finding aid can be
found online at --
