many of you know, moving to Washington, even for a not strictly observing
Jew, is a serious endeavor, and in this case it caused severe interruptions
in Mendele schedule. I would like to thank everyone who sent concerned,
critical and supporting letters and assure that Mendele will be gradually
returning back to normal mode.            - Iosif Vaisman]

It is true [vol. 10.032] that three volumes have appeared based on materials
in the Language and Culture Atlas and that two of these volumes contain maps
based on Atlas data. All credit should be given to their authors. It is also
true that these volumes are very expensive and are inaccessible to most
people. When one considers that the standard interview consists of 3245
questions and took fifteen hours to administer,one can see what a small
proportion of the data has been published. This sample is far too small and
unrepresentative, given the passage of the 30 years since the data was
collected. Cleally a better way of getting the data out is necessary.

At present, the unpublished written data is accessible only to people who
can travel to Columbia University and get personal permission from the
current editor-in-chief of the project.
    
Fortunately there is a solution. There are 488 interviews of East Yiddish
speakers. Of these interviews, 185 have been entered into a computer data
base. These 185 interviews represent a good sampling of the East Yiddish
area. This data could be put on line and made available to everyone very
quickly. With team work, the data from the remaining 305 East Yiddish
interviews could also be put on line in a matter of months
    
This idea may seem radical when one considers that Web was undreamed of in
Uriel Weinreich' day. Yet those who are familiar with the structure of the
questionaire, will recognize that Uriel Weinreich put in a feature (the
problem numbers) that is an astonishing premonition of the hyperlink.
    
An Atlas data base on the Web can form the core of a hyperdocument that 
will eventually include other Yiddish data bases. Such a hyperdocument might, 
for example, provide a venue for the long-stalled Great Yiddish Dictionary.

Subject: Yiddish at Columbia

I wish to correct a factual error in the letter of July 19, 2000, by the
Editor-in-Chief of the Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry. He
asks "why his [Charles Nydorf's, in a letter to the Forward of July 14]
gratuitous reference to what he considers a 'non-issue' ('Yiddish culture
alive or dead')".
     
First of all, the reference was not gratuitous--Charles Nydorf was alluding
to a statement in an earlier Forward letter, written by Dr. Rakhmiel Peltz.
     
Secondly, Charles Nydorf was actually stating, in his letter, an opinion
directly contrary to what is cited above. He wrote "Weinreich did not regard
the question of whether Yiddish culture was alive or dead to be a
'non-issue'. He dedicated his entire life to his language and culture." It
is clear from this, and from the rest of the letter, that the writer
supports and shares Uriel Weinreich's view that the life of Yiddish culture
is of enormous significance.
     
The Editor-in-Chief of the LCAAJ characterizes Charles Nydorf's comments in
his Forward letter as "misanthropic". Here it is not a simple matter of
correcting an error; but I have to disagree with the epithet he chose. It is
not at all misanthropic to do what Charles Nydorf did in his letter: point
out some serious shortcomings in the management of a project which he also
describes as tremendously important. The reason for such criticism is to
encourage people to think of ways in which things could be done even better
in the future. The great satirist Jonathan Swift wrote about himself, in
1745:
     "Alas, poor Dean! his only scope
      Was to be held a Misanthrope."
Charles Nydorf was not even attempting to be satirical--just helpful.
     
As somone who has also worked on the LCAAJ, I believe that access to Atlas
materials should be for everyone, not just the "reputable student or
scholar" whom the Editor-in-Chief has in mind as a suitable visitor to the
archive. The hard work, dedication, money and faith of large numbers of all
kinds of individuals have gone into the project over time, and this should
be reflected in a far more welcoming and generous approach than the current
one towards the general public, many members of which have good and
responsible reasons for researching the LCAAJ files in more detail than the
published volumes, however numerous and impressive, can make possible. To
name just a few kinds of people who cannot be described as "reputable
scholars" but who have serious reasons for Atlas research: people who are
learning Yiddish, people who need indepth information about their family's
town in Eastern Europe before the Holocaust (including people who are
public-spirited enough to share this information with the public), doctors
and Jewish chaplains who need specialized information about Yiddish to help
their Yiddish-speaking patients, teachers (e.g. in Yiddish night-classes,
where students often seek more detailed information than they can get from
their textbooks), writers and artists, and people of any age who are
qualified simply by wanting to learn. Admission to a science museum, art
gallery or library, even if it does subject people to a vetting process, at
least generally does so on a democratic basis e.g. someone might be asked
why he or she needs to use the library. A website would welcome everybody,
and I think this is the model that should be used for the LCAAJ, even
before, or if, it goes completely on line in addition to its archival
(partly paper, as well as tape) existence.
     
As someone who also worked on a closely related project at Columbia
University, the Great Dictionary of the Yiddish Language, I now have a
question for Mendele: what has happened to the archives of that project?
Four volumes of the dictionary, covering the letter alef, have been
published and are available in libraries. They are very useful books--but
what about the rest of the alef-beys? I have no idea even of the physical
whereabouts of the data, and I often worry about it. Mendele, please help!
     
One final note: as a member of Yugntruf, I wish to assure Charles Nydorf
that yes, I am proud of him for raising important issues that concern the
welfare of Yiddish culture and of those who wish to study it, or to make
Yiddish a part of their lives.

Subject: parve and daven again

Could anyone help me with the earliest known citations for the use of either
parve [in the food sense] and daven?

Could some one illuminate for me the custom of dancing around parents
who are marrying off their youngest child, and the term used?

Thanks.

Subject: Translation of Holocaust Yizkor Books into English

I am writing to you, as part of a somewhat eclectically put together
audience, regarding the issue of translating Holocaust Yizkor Books from
(largely) Yiddish and Hebrew into English. This message comes shortly after
an interesting meeting I had with Mark Swiatlo, Curator of Judaica, at
Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, on Friday, July 28, 2000.

The background to my meeting with Mark stems from my interest in providing
an English version of the histories of those towns and cities from which my
personal ancestors came. I remain vitally interested in assuring that future
generations of my family in North America, will not encounter a language
barrier, if their interests drive them to seek a better understanding of
their roots and origins. It manifests an implied concern, on my part, that
Yiddish is in danger of being marginalized, and relegated to the domain of a
shrinking pool of scholar-specialists.

Mark was able to provide me with a larger perspective on the issue, and
challenged me to address the concern on his mind that was raised by my
individual initiative.

While he is in complete sympathy with what I am doing, endeavors of my kind
are not central to his immediate professional priority. Mark is primarily a
zammler - a collector of original texts. In this sense his concerns are most
closely aligned with those of Dr. Aaron Lansky at the National Yiddish Book
Center in Amherst, MA. His only foray into translation relates to the 7,300
pages of eyewitness testimony of Holocaust survivors that he is in the
process of retrieving from Poland (the so-called "Voice from the Ashes"
program).

Mark is concerned that singular efforts such as mine, and those of other
individuals operating in similar isolation, do not address the larger task.
He estimates that there are perhaps a thousand such Holocaust Yizkor books,
of which he believes the most complete collection to be at Yad Vashem in
Jerusalem, Israel. He thinks he has about half of this body at his own
repository in Florida.

The question posed by Mark is a matter of concern. Do we know if there is a
concerted, global, effort to render this body of work into English? The
question is not meant to be linguistically parochial, but does take
cognizance of the fact that English is emerging as a global lingua franca.

Do we know how many of these books have been, or are being translated as we
sit today?.

If so: where is the focal point, and how do we know it receives adequate
resources?

If not: is this an issue that we, as a world community should be concerned
about? In other words, does the imperative to preserve ongoing access to
this historical record command some sort of priority that perhaps has been
overlooked to date?

I found these questions to be provocative and meaningful. I also have little
personal knowledge of `programming' in this area. I am aware that the
JewishGen.org website provides at least one focal point for such efforts,
but I think the initiative comes from individuals. Therefore, I told Mark
that I would make an effort to create a dialogue around this matter - and
certify that there was an overarching need - prior to entertaining the more
demanding question of how to get financial and intellectual resources to
address this seeming challenge.

I would appreciate your thoughts, and would encourage you to forward this
message to people whom you believe can add value to the give-and-take.

Thanks & Regards
Jack Berger

Subject: a horse of another color

Does anyone know of a Yiddish expression, used in the Ukraine in the early
1900s (or elsewhere), saying "That's a horse of another color," meaning
that's a different situation, entirely ?

Any help will be appreciated.

Subject: Gimpl

Could anybody suggest a possible meaning of Gimpl, a I. B. Singer's
personage? There is similar word in czech, sounding in the same way, but
written with y: gympl, meaning grammar school (it is slang). I don't think
the yiddish word has the same etymology. Thank You.
