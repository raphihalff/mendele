Quite unnecessary.

Not only is Mac OS X compatible with Unicode - there is also Mellel, a
Unicode-savvy word processor which handles Yiddish nicely. Mellel 1.7.5 is
available a shareware from

According to Mr. Deutsch at the Yiddish Forward newspaper - Mac OS X (10.3)
supports right to left including Yiddish. In fact, Yiddish produced via OS X
is fully interchangable with the Yiddish written on PCs. For more
information contact Martin Deutsch at deutsch@yiddish.forward.com

Re. Hershl's message: I'm not a Nisus user, but do have an OS X Mac: it
might be useful to add that OS X has a built-in capacity to simultaneously
run OS 9 (it's called Classic), and so far I've had success with getting
non-OS X compliant software to run on my new Powerbook in the Classic
environment. This may be a solution for the time being?

NB in OS X itself (including in Mail, which I'm using to write this email)
the language support seems to work well - you can change instantly between
English and Hebrew, the latter automatically going R-L, and the 'extra'
Yiddish characters are included in the character set.

Subject: tokhekha

Can someone refer me to a Yiddish story about a man whose function in life
was to received the aliyah when the tokhekha (the list of curses) is read
from the Torah?

Subject: Re: gogl mogl

Bernard Kouchel who initiated the first discussion about Gogl-mogl 6 years
ago brought himself the explanation given by Alexander Harkavy:

     "Gogl-mogl - Egg-flip. a strong drink mixed with eggs and naft.
     ("naft" = Petroleum). (Yiddish-english-hebrew dictionary, by Alexander
     Harkavy.

     [I wonder what 'petroleum' was used, perhaps mineral oil???[BK]]"

I hope in the meantime he relized that the hebrew NFT is not "Naft" -
Petroleum but "Nofet" - the hebrew word for liquid honey.

Subject: Rhyme inquiry?

 My father (born in Odessa and arrived in US 1906) sometimes recited a
Yiddish rhyme beginning with the words '"enge benge".  I don't recall the
rest of the words.  Is anyone familiar with these words or the full rhyme. I
am also curious about its origins and meaning.
