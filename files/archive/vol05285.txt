Subject: Apple Hebrew/Yiddish software

A word of caution about the new Apple Hebrew software which is supposed to be
Yiddish capable.  I ordered this package, and after a two-month delay it
finally arrived.  When I checked the keyboard layout, the only Yiddish key was
that of the double yud with a pahtakh under it.  There was no sign of any
other special Yiddish key such as a fey with the line over it, etc.  So I have
returned it for credit.  I forgot to mention that the price was $100 plus tax
and shipping.

Now I have received a catalogue from Davka in Chicago which is
advertising Nisus 4.1 for the Macintosh which comes with this same Apple
Hebrew/Yiddish kit.  If anyone has any information which indicates that I have
erred in judging this kit, please let me know.

Thanks to Mikhl Herzog for his detailed clarification of the pronunciation of
"zun" "zin" and "ziin" in different dialects. Is this kind of information
available in print?

Subject: Ruakh or rikh

Arre Komar heard the expletive as 'der roykh (smoke) zol zey nemen' and Zellig
says 'ruakh (meaning wind in Hebrew) zol zey nemen' was the curse.

My bobe (she was the hearty one in the meshpokhe who cursed vociferously - my
parents were too polite) used to explode, ' a rikh zol im nemen!' ('let the
devil take him!') or a 'rikh in zayn tatn arayn!' ('I wish he had never had
been born".) How about 'Pu tzu ale shvartze rikhes!' ?

Genug mit di rikhes. A zeesn, lebedikn, gezuntn Peysekh aykh alemen.

Subject: Roykh and ruekh

Kathleen Rose appears to be falling into the Volksetymologie-trap that
constantly awaits the unwary in our field. When I taught Yiddish in Ireland
"outreach"-students were often 'discovering' Gaelic words derived from Hebrew
(which some regarded as corrobation of their belief that the Irish were one of
the Ten Lost Tribes). Appealing as it might be to derive Bavarian 'ruach' from
Yiddish or Hebrew, the fact is that the Austro-Bavarian form is a regular
derivative from MHG 'ruch' from which comes the cognate NHG 'rauh' meaning
'coarse' or 'rough' [with which it is, of course, also (though more distantly)
related]. 'Rauch' and 'roykh' (i.e. 'smoke') are from MHG 'rouch'.

This is not, of course, to deny the frequency of convergence phenomena. There
exists a way above average number of instances where Yiddish words have double
etymologies, i.e. they are simultaneously derived from etyma in more than one
component. In such cases it is not fruitful to attempt a determination. The
reciprocal reinforcement should be regarded as a further illustration of the
fusion character of the language. However, the recognition of this phenomenon
does not give us carte blanche to derive words in one component language from
another.

I recall Louis Ginsberg's writing someplace that they would ice-skate with
head lowered on the arm and call it the vayomer David maneuver.

Subject: Diminutives

Jason Payne (5.258,6) asks:  "Does anyone know of instances where the
diminutive -ele- is used to feminize a male?  For example, referring to a male
secretary named Moishe as 'Moishele' in order to give [it] a pejorative,
decidedly feminine slant."

The answer is no.  The diminutive _endearing _ suffixes -ele- or -nyu-, as in
Yosele or Yosenyu, do not "feminize" the bearer, nor do they in and of
themselves carry pejorative intent.

Quite the contrary:  To have the suffix -ele- added to the diminutive of one's
name is an expression of endearment and respect.

In an exceptional case, if the man called "Moyshele," in the example above,
happens to manifest some effeminate characteristics, he is most likely so
called _not_ on account of these particular features.

No one could ever imagine that our very own and revered _Mendele_, whose name
we proudly bear on the masthead of these pages and as members of the
Mendelyaner khavruse, was ever intended to be pejorative.

Although as a rule one outgrows the endearing names of childhood and
adolescence, and a "Yosele" or "Yosenyu" usually becomes Yosl or Yoysef, an
interesting phenomenon in this respect exists in the world of _khazonim_
[cantors].  In many cases the diminutive endearing names remain attached to
them  throughout their adulthood and careers.  For instance:  Yosele
Rozenblat, or Leybele Waldman.

This fact may, in part, be explained that, prior to becoming world-famous
khazonim, they manifested their extraordinary musical gifts while still very
young children, that is when they quite naturally were known by a child's
diminutive, and endearing, name.

They usually started out as members of a cantor's choir, soon to be singled
out by being entrusted with long and sometimes intricate _solo_ numbers
delivered from the choir loft, to the great oyneg fraytic and oyneg shabes
delight of the congregations. [Oyneg -- joy.]

As they grew up and became full-fledged cantors in their own right, they
happily retained their past status with -ele-, with the admiration, approval,
and great love of the people.

I remember when during an international concert tour Yosele Rozenblat
performed, in the 1930's, in Kovne (Kaunas), Lithuania.  He was, indeed, very
tiny, almost like a child, as befitting his name Yosele, and the thought
occurred to me then that if a stage hand had placed him on a chair, as is
often the case with a performing child, the audience would have understood and
accepted it.

But his voice!  A divine golden thread to behold in one's mind for almost half
a century, a supreme natural phenomenon beyond words of description.

The case of the diminutive-endearing name lasting a lifetime is also found in
the khsidishe world.  Thus we have Reb Aizikl fun Komarne, R' Arele Tversky,
R' Itsikl Vurker, R' Borukhl fun Mezbizh, R' Mendele Kotsker, and many, many
others.

While the love and devotion that khsidim have for their rebes would in part
explain their disciples referring to them by the diminutive-endearing names,
the dynasty factor may also play a role in such nomenclature, since a rebe's
son, if gifted, is often talked about, while still a child, as the heir
presumptive.

I grant you that the dynasty factor is not a sufficient explanation for the
diminutive-endearing names of the khsidishe rebes, but in this case it is more
of a speculation on my part.
