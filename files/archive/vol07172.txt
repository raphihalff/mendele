Subject: Morning Freiheit

Microfilm runs of the Morning Freiheit can be found at YIVO, The New York
Public Library, and perhaps in other libraries.  When the Freiheit closed,
about ten years ago, its editor Paul (Peysekh) Novick donated the newspaper's
office correspondence and other materials to the YIVO Archives.  Other,
related materials are also available in the YIVO Archives and in other
repositories.

Subject: Leo Rosten

Concerning the late Leo Rosten, I would like to bring to the attention of
Mendelyaner two articles that appeared in issue no. 185 of the YIVO News /
Yedies fun YIVO (Fall 1997).  The first, entitled "The Joys of Leo Rosten,"
describes the donation to YIVO of 53 volumes from the author's personal
library of books written by him.  The article describes Rosten as a "humorist,
novelist, cinephile, journalist, and magazine editor," and it is in that
perspective that his works on Yiddish should be appraised. 

The second article, entitled "Yiddish:  A Word Defined," responds to a
reader's inquiry concerning the word "doppess" (dapes), which Rosten defines
as a "useless but commiserating bystander; [an] ineffectual observer who is of
little help."  In the article I am quoted as disputing Rosten's contention (in
"The Joys of Yiddish") that the word is "not Hebrew but Ameridish:  a local
coinage of the garment center in New York. This Yiddish word, known only in
America, was born in New York's garment center, of unknown parents, in some
obscure loft -- possibly as a more scornful version of 'dope,' schlemiel,
shmegegge."  Instead, I proposed that doppess/dapes is related to the German
"Taps" (meaning "clumsy oaf"), or "Dapps," a dialectal variant that is cited
in Grimm's Deutsches Woerterbuch.  I leave it to our Germanisten to either
sustain this hypothesis or shoot it down. 

The point I am making is that Rosten's writings on Yiddish must be handled
with extreme caution, to put it very gently. 

Incidentally, for what it's worth, the first editions of "The Joys of Yiddish"
_and_ Uriel Weinreich's "Modern Yiddish-English, English-Yiddish Dictionary"
were both published in 1968 by McGraw-Hill!

Subject: A Guide...Hebraic Words In Yiddish

I haven't seen a response to Neil Jacobs' query about how to obtain copies of
this work, since said query (and plea for help) appeared in Mendele 07.162. 
Assuming my "getting older" eyes haven't missed it, I'll pass the following on
to him and to anyone else who might like the same info.  Steven Jacobsen's
book, A Guide To the More Common Hebraic Words In Yiddish, 4th edition, was
published July 1995.  I purchased a copy directly from Steve Jacobson that
same year.  he may be up to a 5th or 6th edition by now!  The cost *then* was
$17 (U.S.), including postage within the U.S., I believe.  Steve's address
*then* was P.O. box 82849, Fairbanks, Alaska 99708.  It's a wonderful book!

Subject: Guri's "1000 Yiddish Idioms..."

I see that Yosef Guri has had his "1000 Yiddish Idioms and Their Equivalents
In English, Hebrew and Russian" published by the Hebrew University Press (169
pp., softcover).  Has anyone on Mendele had the opportunity to see this book
and if so could we have some comments about it, please and thank you?  A
shaynem dank derfar!

Subject: Hare hunt in Hagodes

Diane Wolfthal (07.162) and others may be interested in an entirely different
understanding of the "hare hunt" illustrated in _hagodes_ of the Middle Ages.
I believe it was Max Weinreich who pointed out that this is a case in which
Yiddish was used for liturgical purposes. As I recall it, the cartoon was a
mnemonic for the order of the first seyder when it coincides with _shabes_:
Yayin (wine), Kidish (blessing), Ner (candles), Ha-Zman (blessing of
thanksgiving)= YaKiN HaZ = yogn hoz (chasing rabbit/hare).

Subject: shmusen

William Safire (March 15, 1998) missed the chance to tell us that "German
_schmusen_" 'to wheedle', 'smoodge', 'cuddle' (designated as _burschikos_
'student-like', 'unmannerly', and slang, in Wildhagen's German-English
Dictionary),  is derived from Yiddish _shmuesn_ 'to talk', 'to discuss',
'to chat', probably derived, in turn, from Ashkenazic Hebrew _shmuos_
'rumor(s)', 'news', 'gossip', etc.

(Hebrew root _shin, mem, ayin_ 'to hear', 'to listen', 'to obey'). In our
salad days (Toronto in the 40s), when we spoke of_shmoozing_ 'necking', we
thought we were speaking English. When we did it, we knew we were speaking
a universal language.

Subject: kurva

Thanks to Ellen Prince, we now know that Church Slavonic, the written form of
Old Bulgarian, had kuruva 'adulteress', which seems to be a more reasonable
source for kurva in in the Slavic languages than a doubtful H/A etymon. Since
Church Slavonic goes back to the ninth century, it is difficult to believe
that kuruva or the like got to passed on to Bulgarian from Yiddish by way of
other Slavic languages -- but perhaps I have misread Hugh Denman's etymology
and he is saying that the Slavic languages got the H/A form from some other
source language and passed it on to Yiddish.

Subject: "Shayn khaseneh gemakht"

Sounding that phrase triggered the memory of a related expression which I know
has several variants. When something was too late for redemption, my mother
was as likely to say "Fahrshoren der kalen un shayne" as much as Americans,
using a popular advertising slogan of the twenties and thirties, might have
said "Too late for Herpicide!" The bride's hair having been cut, it was too
late for anything to happen other than that which was bahshert. I recall
hearing several different "correct" versions a lifetime ago, but can't
remember how any of them went. In any case, this is what my own mame-lushn
tells me in the here and now. A shaynem dahnk.
