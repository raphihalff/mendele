Subject: Khushim

In non-litvish Yiddish (I know of it from speakers from the Bucovina
region) _khushim_ [khishem] is used as a predicate adjective meaning 'out
of it, momentarily not clear-minded',  e.g. "ekh bin khishem".  In
litvish Yiddish (and perhaps all the other Eastern Yiddish dialects as
well), _tsekhusht_ is an attributive adjective with the same meaning:
"nokhn aropgeyn fun eroplan hobn di tsekhushte pasazhirn opgekhapt dem
otem -- zey zaynen gefloygn sakhakl tsvelef sho on ufher."

Subject: "Academic" Yiddish

Currently, the number of university courses taught in Yiddish throughout
the world (non-language-instruction classes, I mean) is probably no
greater than 5 per year, if even that.  (Note that this number is
probably greater than that taught before WWII, since courses in Yiddish
Studies barely existed at the university level at that time.)  The number
of Yiddish publications produced by academies or on an academic level is
probably the same.  The number of Yiddish academics, i.e. professionals
or students in the field which has come to be known as "Yiddish Studies"
who speak to their (respective) students/ professors in Yiddish is
probably the same.  It is, then, unclear to me what those who talk of
present-day academic Yiddish usage are referring to.  More precisely,
they're probably referring not to a "what" but to a "who":  they know
some people or have read the works of some authors who use such-and-such
a word, phrase, or pronunciation.  (And perhaps the works consulted are
from 20-30-40+ years ago.)  These speakers/writers become representative,
in their minds, of the "world" of Yiddish academics.  _World_ is in
quotes because a group of 5 (let's be generous and say 10) people who
conduct their scholarly work in Yiddish is not a "world" in the usual
sense.  It's 5 or 10 people.  (These comments only refers to "academic
Yiddish"; there are a few tens of writers and journalists out there, of
khareydi and non-khareydi belonging, who write -- unsurprisingly -- in
the style of their trade -- belletristic Yiddish, journalistic Yiddish,
etc. So too actors and other Yiddish professionals.)

Subject: Three million Yiddishes

If there are (or were in 1980 -- if I remember the statistics correctly)
three million mother tongue claimants of Yiddish, there are 3 million
Yiddishes, not just two (frum vs. fray or academic vs. khareydi or
whatever other binary divisions have been proposed).  Within the khareydi
world there are the different dialects, depending on the provenance of
the community; then there are the various registers and sociolects of
each group (language of kheyder-yinglekh; language of women; language of
shokhtim vs. that of businessmen).  And finally the idiolects -- each
individual with his language peculiarities.  And what meanings a word or
idiom has for one person as opposed to another depend on everything about
the person in question.  Someone heard uttering the phrase "ekh bin
khishem" *may* have the association of this word to the character
Khushim, or s/he may not.  This may correlate with his/her steepedness in
traditional Jewish study, but a voyl-kenevdik (learne`d) person who *is*
familiar with the character *and* the adjective simultaneously may not
have made this connection (if indeed the connection to the character is
what gave rise to the adjectives discussed above).  It may simply never
have have occurred to that person.

We don't hear from a large number of Mendelyaner, so we don't know the
background and life stories and thoughts of each one of them.  But if
there are 700+ Mendelyaner who know Yiddish in some form or other, there
will be that same number of Yiddishes, given the varying backgrounds and
varying associations and varying thoughts of each one of them.  (I'm
assuming that no two Mendelyaner -- and no two people, for that matter --
are exactly alike.) To talk about the world of Mendele or the world of
Mendelyaner or the Yiddish of Mendelyaner or the worldview of Mendelyaner
isn't very meaningful, in my opinion.  Some generalizations, as long as
they are taken as generalizations, are helpful; those of a gross
character are, however, meaningless.  (Imagine someone from a different
country saying:  "Americans are Democrats".  S/he has proof, after all:
Americans elected a Democratic president!)

Subject: Name pairings

In Mendele Vol 4.298, reb mikhl herzog wrote:

    Traditional pairings for which I don't know the rationale: _Itshe
    (=Yitskhok)-Mayer_, _Yekhiel-Mikhl_ , _Yaynkef-Yitskhok_ (pairing of
    the "fathers", perhaps).

Itshe-mayer comes ( as alluded to by another post) from the Chidushei
Horim who effectively established the khasides of Ger. Consequently
numerous gerer khsidm (as well as many other poylishe) named their
children Itshe_Mayer.

Likewise Reb Yechiel-Mekhl of Zlotshev was one of the early khsidishe
rebbes. The name Yankf-Yitskhek is after -two- of the founders of khsides
in kongres poylen, namely the khoyze of lublin and the yid hakoodesh from
pshiskhe, who both carried this name. In fact, the latter was originally
one of the senior khsidim of the former; because other khsidim could not
call him by name (being the name of their rebbe) they gave him the name
yid hakoodesh.
