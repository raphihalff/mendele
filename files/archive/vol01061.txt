Subject: Who said ...

in a properly jewish manner, i shall begin the year with a question.

the LINGUIST bulletin board has been 'mitching' over who said 'a language
is a dialect with an army and navy.' just about every european male linguist
who would today be over 70 has been named, but the highest number of votes
(mine included) have gone to max weinreich. does anyone have any knowledge
of the source? if weinreich, does anyone have a reference?

a hartsikn dank aykh. un a gut yor!

Subject: Brukhes un kloles

A story of a Yiddish curse or expression of good will.
 
Told by Israeli leftist Knesset member Yosi Sarid.  He
has some new relatives who have arrived from out of the
blue from Russia.  These had successfully eliminated all
remnant of Jewish identity, and for two generations carried
passports and identity cards stating that they were Russian
[not Jewish].  Israeli immigration authorities begged for
some form of Jewish identity to allow them to come.  No luck.
Finally, they were asked to try to remember something Jewish
from their childhood, perhaps a prayer.
 
They were allowed to immigrate to Israel when one remembered
such a "prayer."  He said that he remembered his mother, when
arguing with his father [thus W by your classification] say,
"Kish mir in tuchas."
