Aren Abramson and Robert Hoberman: Your comments on ayin
and nasalization are enlightening. Thanks.

Sissle / Thistle. Imagine that. Great!

Dave:   ni(sh)t alone can negate a verb: ikh vil nisht esn!
 When esn is treated as a noun 'food', keyn is compulsory:
 ikh vil nisht keyn esn. There are some contexts in which
 nisht alone can serve: er redt nisht (keyn) daytsh. We've
 yet to map the data. There is probably no context in which
 keyn can serve alone.

"Keyn" without "nisht" can be found in old songs and
proverbs; the example that comes to my mind is "Un az me
tsolt keyn dire-gelt" from the song "Dire-gelt". A proverb,
where rhythm is less important, would be a better example,
but I don't have time to dig around for one now.

There may be dialects in Eastern Yiddish where "Keyn"
without "nisht" is normal, but my impression is that it's
archaic almost everywhere.

Subject: sissel

Before we issue a collective hekhsher on Bob Hoberman's
derivation of sissel from thistle, it's useful to remember
that the latter are eaten as far as I know only by birds,
especially the goldfinch.  The German name for the European
Goldfinch (carduelis carduelis) is in fact distelfink,
thistle finch.  I have a vague recollection that Goethe was
fond of the bird and mentioned it in his conversations with
Eckermann. Aber nisht dos bin ikh oysn.

However, since thistle _is_ about the same shape as caraway
and since _some_ of the bakers call caraway sissel, I tried
the backyard test.  Bob, I don't know about your thistle,
but any baker who tried to put the stuff I've got on a rye
bread would lose most of his dough.  Sorry about that.

On another front, I heard that a baker in a town nearby
uses genuine cherneshkes on his black bread and tells his
customers that they're (get this) wild onion seed.  Apart
from the question of whether a plant is wild when its seeds
are sold commercially and in bulk is the issue that engages
us. Tomorrow I'll make the trip and report.
