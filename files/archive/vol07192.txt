Subject: "Yiddishland" Request

Tayere Fraynd,

I am a graduate student in English, with some Yiddish background, doing
research on the concept of "Yiddishland," of which Harshav writes in his
anthology, American Yiddish Poetry: "Literature was 'everything.' It was a
substitute for religion and statehood, it was a state in itself,
'Yiddishland'; to abandon it was to abandon the whole culture" (22).  I
imagine there must be many references to "Yiddishland" in a variety of Yiddish
and English texts (and in a variety of registers).  If any of you could point
me to some of these references (or to any essays that might actually deal with
the concept, in whatever way), I would be very grateful.  Please feel free to
write me directly, if you would prefer.  A sheyem dank. 

Ayer,

Malkeh Bachman

Subject: haytukhn

In 07.189, Isak Shteyn asked about the word "haytukhn."  It stems directly
from Hebrew.

The form "yitakhen" in modern Hebrew is a rather formal way of saying "it is
possible."  The more colloquial form in Hebrew is "yakhol li'hyot." The letter
he at the beginning of the word is the "he-ha'sh'ela," a particle that
transforms the following word or phrase into a question, much like the word
tsi in yiddish (or czy in Polish, I believe). 

Thus, haytukhn, or its Hebrew ancestor hayitakhen, means:"Is it possible?
Could it be?"

Subject: "Hesse Bed"

J. Nussbaum asked about the origin of "Hesse Bed" [07.181].

I have just seen this query, but no posting answering it. zayt mir moykhl
if I've missed the response.

The expression is actually *hesv bet*

hesv is the Hebrew for  reclining, the prefered mode of seating at the seyder.
bet because reclining normally takes place on a couch. Indeed it was the
custom gfor the head of the family to use some form of couch (the hesv bet)
for conducting the seyder.

Subject: -te feminine suffix

Harvey Spiro asked about the Aramaic-origin words in Yiddish that maintain the
"tov-alef" suffix

It is a general rule of Yiddish that unstressed final vowels in words of any
origin whatever (except some very recent ones) change those vowels to schwa. 
This is true of Hebrew words and Aramaic and Slavic and other ones.  This
schwa is written ayin ('e' in transliteration) in words of non-Semitic origin
and in those few cases where a word of Semitic origin is nevertheless written
"phonetically" (as we know, words of Semtiic origin are usually written
accordinmg to the spelling rules of the language of their origin, Hebrw or
Aramaic).  This is why there are not more examples of a Hebrew or Aramaic alef
being replaced by the Yiddish ayin (which isbeing used "phonetically" to
represent the schwa sound).  Most Hebrew or Aramaic words are written
etymologically in Yiddish.  But if they were written "phonetically" (as was
done for a long time in the former USSR), then all their final unstressed
vowels would be written with an ayin.  For example, adrabe is written with a
final alef, just as in Aramaic, but it is proncounced with the same schwa
vowel as in the suffix -te, and if Yiddish were written "phonetically", then
this word would also get a final ayin. 

Alex Manaster Ramer

P.S. I put "phonetically" in quotes because in modern linguistics (since the
turn of the century roughly)  this term has acquired a different meaning than
it has in normal usage (which was current in linguistic itself before the turn
of the century or so).  What I mean by this word here is what it means in
normal usage in English, not the technical usage in modern linguistics, which
is not relevant here.

From: "Mikhl Herzog" <mherzog@bestweb.net>
Subject: the -te suffix

Of course, Mordkhe Schaechter and Harvey Spiro were right to point out that I
misspoke in claiming (so confidently) that the suffix -te occurs ONLY with
words of Hebrew origin. _poyerte_, for example, was staring me right in the
face. It was proof enough.

From: Arnie Kuzmack <kuzmack@cpcug.org>
Subject: The suffix -nitse

Harvey Spiro's statement about the Slavic origin of the feminine suffix
-itse is 90% right.  It is of Slavic origin, but it's -nitse, which is the
feminine of -nik.  For example, nudnik/nudnitse.

B'sholem,

From: Robert Werman <rwerman@vms.huji.ac.il>
Subject: Difference between "poylish" and "paylish"

What are the main differences in pronounciation between those people who say
they are "poylish"  and those who refer to themselves as "paylish?"  [Has this
been discussed before?]

And are there other differences in custom and behavior?
