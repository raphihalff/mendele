Subject: Help with a poem

As a child I was reared by my grandparents who spoke only Yiddish. I have
not spoken the language since.  However, I remember a line of poetry which
began, "S'iz geven a kalter, finstere nakht in Bronsville un...." I
wonder if someone out there remembers the remainder of the poem and who
authored it. Thank you very much.

Subject: Hebrew fonts

Just in the last couple of days I downloaded a couple of special hebrew
type fonts (Ariela and Mosaic.fixed) that enable the transmission of
hebrew on the World Wide Web. Somehow the characters, when typed in are
coded in a particular way that show up as hebrew at the receiver's end!
Are there any computer mavens out there that know how this can be
implemented for Mendele? It would certainly solve many problems that are
of continual contention here.

Subject: Kukvinkl ambiguity

Anno Siegel:

I appreciate your etymological analysis of German words that seem related
to the Yiddish _kukvinkl_.  I wish I knew more about linguistics than I
do. However, I do know something about historical and ongoing Jewish
experience. When considering the evolution of a word's meaning(s) my best
guess is that, in this case, I should give more weight to folk experience
than to etymology.

My speculation about possible ambiguity of _kukvinkl_ is all speculation.
If one thinks about German and Yiddish, one may think about the language
of those who cornered, and of those who were cornered, and the different
thought associations and the emotional tones they may evoke.  Then it is
clear that Jewish experience (at least among the Yiddish speakers) could
lend an entirely different tone to the idea of a corner as a
word-component.  Is it a comfortable place from which to look out? Or is
it a restricted place into which one was backed?.

Again, thanks for your analysis.  Mendele is an education.  Mendele iz an
arumnemiker toyre.  A mekhaye.

Subject: L.A. Yiddish Choruses

I'm delighted to advise my good friend, Eric Gordon, that the Arbeter
Ring Yiddish Chorus is not an eyn-eyntsiger (a solitary phenomenon) in
Los Angeles. The Sholem Yiddish Singers--the chorus sponsored by the
Sholem Community Organization--will perform this Sunday morning at the
Community's _khanike_ celebration at the Crossraods School, 21st St. and
Olympic, Santa Monica. For further information: (310) 277-0849.

Subject: The US census and data about mother tongues

Paul Ritterband mentioned a few postings back that the "mother tongue
question" was asked *routinely* by the US Census since 1910. This is not
precisely so.  Although the "mother tongue question" was introduced in
1910, the Census assumed that only immigrants and their children would
speak other languages, and so they did not ask the question "What
language was spoken in this person's home when he or she was a child" of
the entire white population until 1940.  I'm not sure in what year the
census first took stock of the nonwhite population. In 1980, the question
was changed to "Does this person speak a language other than English at
home," a question which the Census found received 15.4 million positive
responses in 1979,in comparison to 32.4 million positive responses to the
"mother tongue" question asked of the same group, experimentally, at the
same time. My point is that the census data may be the best quantitative
information we have about mother tongues in the US, but it needs to be
taken with a grain of salt.  The best source I know for this kind of
information is Dorothy Waggoner, who wrote on the 1970 Census in Ferguson
and Heath's _Language in the USA_ (Cambridge UP) and on the 1980 Census in
McKay and Wong's _Language Diversity: Problem or Resource_ (Newbury House).

Subject: Maven/meyvn and its plural

A.  The humorist Jeff MacGregor, who writes for and about television,
published in the Arts & Leisure section of the _New York Times_ (December
10, 1995, p. 37) a rhymed satirical piece about pundits on television
channels who are always at the ready to "pontificate, educate,
elaborate... illuminate, corroborate, and ruminate..."

The title of the lengthy satire was "The Maven," and the subtitle read
"(With Apologies to Edgar Allan Poe)."

Usually, when I see a yiddishism in an English newspaper, my first
reaction is:  "I wish they had spelled it in accordance with the standard
YIVO romanization, in this case "meyvn," thus reflecting more accurately
the pronunciation and derivation of the term (although English
dictionaries still do not do so).

But the mention of Poe in the subheading, and the refraining last line of
each verse ending with "more," "nor," and "furthermore," alerted me
naturally to the literary allusion of "The Raven."  My eyes and mind
therefore gladly accepted the spelling m-a-v-e-n, realizing that in this
special case it must -- letterly -- parallel the spelling r-a-v-e-n.

B. In the _New York Times Magazine_ of the same date William Safire wrote
in his language column (p., 38) "As one of this paper's resident language
_mavenim_..."

As the mother of a sailor who came home on leave said:  "By them he may
be a captain, but not by me..."

By the _Times_ he is, of course, a maven on English, but not when it
comes to Yiddishisms.  The plural of maven/meyvn is mevInim, not mavenim,
with a shift of the accent from the first to the second syllable, and the
non-syllabic /e/ in the singular changes in the plural to an accented
/i/.

Subject: Handlen Mit a Yid

A shaynem dank dem shames far di mayseh. Ikh in man vahb hobn zayer fil
gelakht fin dem.  The strengths and weaknesses of transliteration are
beautifully illustrated by this piece.  The ability to reproduce special
accents is excellent.  However, when it comes to looking up any words or
idioms in a dictionary, the lack of a correct Yiddish spelling makes this
an almost impossible task.  I am going to distribute this piece to my
leyenkrayz, and we will work it out together.  Then maybe I can persuade
one of the members to perform this piece as a monologue.
