Subject: Ravel's Chants Hebraiques

Daniella HarPaz asks about the text of two songs set by Maurice Ravel.
This deserves a longer answer, since we have here to do with one of the
greatest masterpieces of jewish music. With the term Jewish music I mean,
music dealing with jewish themes and motives regardless of the composer`s
descent.

The first encounter of Maurice Ravel with jewish folklore was 1910 as he
wrote his "Chants Populaires" with folksongs of dif- ferent languages,
one of them he called "Chanson Hebraique" though its main language was
Yiddish. It is the popular song "MEYERKE".

The text of the song is:

Meyerke mayn sun, Meyerke mayn sun!
zi weystu far vemen du shteyst?
-Lifney meylekh malkhey hamlokhim, tatenju.

Meyerke mayn sun etc.
vos vestu oysbetn bay im?
-Boney, khajey, mzoney, tatenju.

Meyerke mayn sun etc.
oyf vos darfstu boney?
-Bonim oyskim batoyre, tatenju.

Meyerke mayn sun etc.
oyf vos darfstu khajey?
-Kol hakhayim joydukho, tatenju.

Meyerke mayn sun etc.
oyf vos darfstu mzoney?
-ve`okhalto ve`sovoto uvejrakhto, tatenju.

The original song contains another strophe:
Meyerke mayn sun etc.
zi veystu ver du bist?
-Hineni he`oni mima`as, tatenju.

4 years later Ravel again dealt with jewish motives writing his "Deux
Melodies Hebraiques" and again the term hebrew was not the correct one.
The first "Kaddisch" is mainly aramaic and is the original text of the
Kaddish prayer. The second is this wonderful philosophical meditation
"Fregt di velt di alte kashe" - a mid- stage between a song and a
wordless Nigun, conserving the riddle in the intonation of the answer
without words.

Fregt di velt an alte kashe:

Tra-la tra-di-ri-di-rom - -
entfert men: Tra-di-ri-di-rey-lom,
oy-ey, tra-di-ri-di-rom!
Un az men vil, ken men oykh zogn:
Tra-i-dim?
Blaybt dokh vayter di alte kashe:
Tra-la tra-di-ri-di-rey-lom.

Do I have to write the translation or interpretation? I believe they are
clear. You find the text and partiture in:

Fritz Mordechai Kaufmann: "Die schoensten Lieder der Ostjuden",
Berlin 1920, 1935, Jerusalem 1971.

Menachem Kipnis: "Hundert Folks-lider" Buenos Aires 1949.

And I believe also in the 4-volume "Anthology of Yiddish Folksong"
edited by Aharon Vinkovetzki and others, Jerusalem.

Also, at least one of the two (Meyerke) in: Nathan Ausubel`s
"A treasury of jewish folklore", New York.

If more information or details are needed I shall be glad to
add.

Subject: Yiddish software

Many thanks to Mordechai Steve Seidman for the fine catalog of
Hebrew/Yiddish software sources. This emboldens me to ask him or others
the following question. I have an old Yiddish word processing program
called Mouse-Write which came out of the Hillel at Harvard (I think). It
worked fine on Mac system 6. Now I have a Power Mac with System 7.0.2, on
which the program writes fine on the screen, but does not print out. Is
there some way to get the printer to function? Grateful for any help.

Subject: The Film: Ivan and Abraham

The film "Ivan and Abraham" by the French director Yolande Zauberman was
recently shown in the Bay Area.  It is described by Leah Garchik in a
review in the SF Chronicle as a "movie about the friendship between two
boys in a shtetl near the Polish border in 1930 (in which) a full picture
of life in the Pale emerges."  I found the film to be an exceptional
achievement in many areas, and would like more information about it.

Where was the film made?  Has Yolande Zauberman made other films?  What
is her background?  Was the shtetl totally recreated, or were existing
buildings used?  None of the actors or actresses were familiar to me.  I
would like to know who they were and whether they were professional or
not.

Parts of the story were difficult for me to follow.  This could result
from the fact that I don't know very much about the culture pictured, or
that the subtitled English version was badly cut, or that the film maker
is at fault.

For example:  what is Ivan's relationship to the Nachman family?  The
subtitles indicate only that he is an "apprentice" and must leave the
family because he is too old.  I didn't understand the spoken dialogue at
that point and was not able to recognize the original word translated as
"apprentice."  And if he was indeed an apprentice, what was the skill he
was learning in the Nachman household?

I was somewhat confused by various scenes and dialogue related to the
Mother.  She seemed too young to be the Mother of Rachel.  What was the
significance of her statement that she like men, but not her husband?  I
did not understand the the reference to the dress by Rachel and her
Mother.

I would appreciate information about the film, the players, the maker,
and the specific points I have mentioned above concerning the story.
