Subject: David Opatoshu

I regret to have to announce that the American actor David Opatoshu, whose
father was the Yiddish novelist Joseph Opatoshu, died in Los Angeles on
Tuesday, April 30.  He was 78 years old and died after a long illness.

David Opatoshu began his long career in the Yiddish theater and did not make
his Broadway debut until 1938.  In 1939 he went back to the Yiddish theatre
playing Fishke, a lame boy in love with a blind girl in the Yiddish film, "The
Light Ahead" as directed by Edgar G. Ulmer.

He also wrote Yiddish short stories and a collection of them are to be found
in his book, "Between Sea and Sand" published in 1946.

Opatoshu served with the Air Force in WW2 and served in the South Pacific.
The theater credits include the musicals "Silk Stockings," "Bravo Giovanni,"
"Once More With Feeling" and the dramas "Flight Into Egypt," "The Wall," and
"Lorenzo."

He made his Hollywood film debut in 1948 in "The Naked City" and later
appeared in "The Brothers Karamzov," "Party Girl," "Cimarron," "The Best of
Enemies," "Torn Curtain," "Enter Laughing," and "The Fixer."

Using a novella of his father, he wrote the screenplay for "Romance of a Horse
Thief" in 1971 and also appeared in the film.

His best known film role was that of Akiva, a scholarly Jewish resistance
leader in the 1960 film "Exodus."  He also acted in numerous television
productions including Studio One, Philco Playhouse, and Playhouse 90.  He was
a guest star on Perry Mason, Kojak, Star Trek, and other series.  In the
mini-seiries "The Trial of the Chicago Seven" he played Judge Julius Hoffman.

(Material for this summary was taken from the obituary found in the New York
Times, West Coast edition, of Friday, May 3, 1996.)

Subject: Yiddish actors/actresses on 78s

The rise of Yiddish theater and the development of recording as an industry
occured simultaneously in the late 1880s and there are some wonderful records
which document this tradition.

While head of the sound archives the YIVO I collected several thousand Yiddish
78s among which were numerous discs by famous Yiddish theater actors (and
those not well remembered). Among those who recorded were: Sholem Aleichem
(1915), Rubin Goldberg (1918-1928), Gus Goldstein (1916-1929), Luba Kadison
(1928), Abe and Gussie Karp (1918-1922), Noach Nachbush (1946-1955), Maurice
Schwartz (1922-1928), Elihu Tenenholz (1924-1929), Boris and Bessie
Thomashevsky (1924-1927). This list, of course, doesn't include the numerous
musical comedy stars like Molly Picon, Aaron Lebedeff, David Kessler. etc.

Subject: Goyish nakhes

The current _Nation_ has what I think is a misuse of this phrase: "New York
Jewish intellectuals are finally getting some _goyishe naches_: great prizes,
triumphal banquets and conferences . . . ." p. 11.

I always thought _goyish nakhes_ was used ironically -- to refer to violence,
drunkenness, or something else that Jews would avoid but that goyim supposedly
enjoy. But a friend tells me it can refer to anything that Jews avoid but a
non-Jew would enjoy -- for example, a ham and cheese sandwich.

If anyone could enlighten me about the use of this phrase, I would shep (or
shlep) nakhes from reading his answer.

Subject: Fonye

I believe Fonye is the diminutive form of Afanasy, which is the Russian form
of the Greek name Athanasios, and is, or at least once was, a fairly common
name among Russians.

Subject: Fonye

As a child I remember hearing a Yiddish ditty that went like this: 'Ix, mix,
drix, Fonye mitn langn bix'.  I also believe that the term Fonye relates to a
Russian or Polish soldier.

Subject: Yinglish lists

The recent colloquy re: Safire's use of "tsatskes" leads me to ask if there is
a dictionary or other comprehensive listing of Yiddish words which have been
adopted into English.  I'm sure I could come up with several dozen quickly,
but I suspect there are several hundred.

Can any of you Mendelyaners help?  A sheynem dank.

Subject: Pinkes

My wife claims that her mother used to refer to the pin-feathers of a chicken
(those left over feathers that you have to plunk out with tweezers) as
"pinkes" (or similar spelling in Yiddish.) I could not find this word in
Harkavy, nor in Weinreich nor in Stutchkoff. And I know that it is not Hebrew
or Russian. Did anybody else hear this word before?  My wife's parents were
both born in the USA and the grandparents came from Minsk and Pinsk
respectively.
