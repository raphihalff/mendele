Subject: Diminutive plurals

In resonse to Ellen Prince [12.002]:

An interesting speculation, but -erl diminutives exist all over
Southern Germany and modern Austria.  In those dialects where the
-erl/-rl diminutive exists for a word often the -el/-l diminutive is
not found.

M=E4derl for M=E4del is the common example among Austrian dialects.

I am not convinced of the common exclusion in West- or Ost- Yiddish of
word forms because of associations with Christianity.  Sometimes, we
find specifically Jewish uses of Christian terms, e.g. menikh (from
monachos) instead of parve.

I am also dubious that every modern apparently Hebrew morpheme
genuinely is an Hebrew-Aramaic morpheme and not just an apparent
Hebraization of a Germanic form.

Khasdimlekh could easily be a reinterpretation of khasidenlekh.

Subject: Jacob Gordin's "Sappho"

Does anyone know of an English translation of Jacob Gordin's play
"Sappho"  whether in published or unpublished form, and where such
might be obtained?  Does anyone have knowledge of English-language
productions of the play?

Subject: Ikh bin a kleyner dreydl

Re: information about "Ikh bin a kleyner dreydl" [12.002]

Can anyone else corroborate this information (which jibes with my
earlier suspicions) so that I may proceed with my research?

One thing that would be very helpful is if any of you could let me know
when you first remember hearing the Yiddish and/or English versions.
This will help establish when the songs appeared, information which I
have not been able to locate yet.  The earliest I have been able to
place either version is in the mid 1940s.

I have a 1928 edition of Goldfarb's The Jewish Songster, which does not
contain the song.  My guess is that if he had already "written" it, he
would have included it in the book.  The earliest printed version I
have found so far from Gelbart is from 1946.

If any of you have some old Gelbart song books, would you look and see
if the song is included, and what year that book was published?

If you have old books with the English version, I would like to know
about that, too.

Lastly, would you email me privately so I could hear from you as soon
as you reply?  I will post my findings to Mendele.

A dank in foroys,
Lorele Cahan-Simon

Subject: Alphabet songs and love-handles/spare-tire

I'm hoping that someone can refer me to a source for two Yiddish
alphabet songs.  My hunch is that they both have their origin in the
Arbeter-Ring school system.  A teacher at the Weinreich Summer program
mentioned them ages ago.

    The first starts:

Aleph-beys-giml
A shtern shaynt in himl
Dalet-hey-vov
Shlof, mayn kind, shlof, shlof...

The second one is to the tune of Do-a dear, a female dear...  I don't
remember the beginning of the second one; I only recall two letters,
tes and fey:

Tes (Tess)<a girl who lives next door

Fey (Fay):  a friend of little Tess

Also, is anyone familiar with the word "blunkies" for
love-handles/spare-tire?  I heard this word used by a friend's family,
and I suspect that the word may have a Yiddish origin, perhaps
originally as "blonkes" or the like (although a derivation from blonken
zikh seems a stretch).  The friend's family generally anglicize Yiddish
final shwas to "ie", e.g. , khale-->khallie, yarmulke-->yarmulkie.  In
any case, is there a Yiddish word for love-handles/spare-tire?

Mit a dank in faroys,

Adam (Yerme-Leyb) Levitin

Subject: Sheyn bin ikh sheyn

In the October 4, 2001 issue, Claire Siverman asked for the full lyrics
to subject song, which has been recorded by 8 different artists. Here
it is:

 Sheyn bin ikh, sheyn,
Sheyn iz oykh mayn nomen,
Redt men mir shidukhim
Mit groyse rabonim...
Rabonishe toyre
Iz dokh zeyer groys.
Bin ikh bay mayn mamen
A likhtike royz!

A sheyn meydele bin ikh,
Bloye zekelekh trog ikh,
Gelt in di tashn,
Bir in di flashn,
Vayn in di krigelekh,
Kinder in di vigelekh
Shrayen vi di tzigelek:
Me, me, me! ...

Subject: Passage from Mendele Moykher Sforim

In an autobiography I am translating, the author writes:

"Ikh gedenk ikh hob amol geleyent far zey [zayne amerikaner-geboyrene
kinder] a blat Mendele un es fartaytsht ts.b. a kugl mit a ganef iz
kugl veysn dokh ale vos es iz un a ganef meynt az derbay iz do a

Zey hobn gelekt di finger. Derbay is es ober geblibn."

Can anyone direct me to the "blat Mendele" to which he is referring?

Thanks.

Subject: Sacco and Vanzetti

In response to Larry Rosenwald's request for Yiddish works about Sacco
and Vanzetti, Nathan Asch's novel 'Pay Day' may be of interest.

Asch (1902 - 1964) was the oldest son of Sholem Asch. 'Pay Day', whose
action unfolds during the hours leading up to Sacco and Vanzetti's
execution, was his third novel, published in New York in 1930.

A year later, it appeared in Yiddish, translated by L. Hodes and
published by Kultur-lige in Warsaw.  The Yiddish title is 'Der
tsvayuntsvantsikster august' [22 August], referring to the execution
date of 22 August 1927. Thus, the multiple resonances of the book's
English title have been replaced by one presumably thought more likely
to appeal to the Yiddish reader.

David Mazower.
