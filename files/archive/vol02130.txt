Subject: Regarding emet/emes --

  With the prevalence of people of linguistic understanding
on Mendele, and the recent airing of the questions of
stress and vowel changes in segholate [eh-eh pairs of
vowels in Hebrew] words, I'm hoping Mendele can clear up my
confusion about something in modern Hebrew. In fact, the
question was alluded to briefly in one of this week's
issues. The earlier remark alluded to the fact that one
says b-eMETT in modern Israeli Hebrew, meaning `for sure',
`certainly', `of course.' But the rule for segholates says
that even in modern Israeli Hebrew, the accent falls on the
first of the two segholate syllables. Thus, according to
the rule, one *should* say b-EMet, `in truth.'

And, in fact, one *does* say EMMett in the phrase "ha-emet
v-tzedek" at the end of the Haftarah blessings (as a poster
noted on mail-jewish, in another context). So why *can't*
the Hungarian (I think it was) pronounciation of EMMes or
EMMett pass without raised eyebrows in modern Israel?

Shalom aleichem, people!

I am sitting here in the livingroom listening to Jan Bart
singing "Yiddish Favorites."  I don't know the title of the
song, but it has a line which goes "Die raeder drehen sich;
die Juden gehen sich/Ich bin schoin alt un greis un gru."
I think it's called "The Miller's Sorrow," or something
like that.

At any rate, I'm intrigued by the reflexive verb "to go."
The wheels turn themselves.  Ok, no problem.  But "die
Judenhe really says Juden, not Jiden) "go themselves" seems
a little strange.

I remember when I was living in Germany hearing people say
jokingly of someone from the East that "Er kimmt sich von
dribben," an imitation, I presume, of East German.  I
wonder if there is a connection.

Any ideas?

I did see the article in the Book Review on Zukunft.  Can
anyone out there supply subscription information?  What
about other Yiddish journals? Thanks.

Subject: nouns

Do any Mendelnikim know the origin of "boychik"?  I've
heard this word, and used it this way myself, as referring
to one's son, to a male friend, or in irony, to someone not
close -- "boychik" as in buddy-boy, pal.  Is this an
American-Jewish term?  Are there equivalent terms for
daughters, women friends ("girlchik" doesn't sound right,
and besides, I've never heard it).  I don't think this term
is ever used to refer to a shaygetz or goy, however close
the relationship.  Is that correct?

Subject: Hebrew computing lists

In #2.128, Mark David asked about lists dealing with
Yiddish or Hebrew computing.

Here is a list of several Hebrew-related lists, but I'm not
sure how much they will help you. In the time I've been
subscribed, there's been no activity.
