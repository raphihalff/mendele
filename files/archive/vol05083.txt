Subject: Feldsher

A minor correction. Gaston Schmir writes, "Among the duties of the
feldsher were the withdrawal of blood by application of heated cups
("cupping") or leeches..."  Shteln baynkes does not not entail the
withdrawel of blood. The vacuum created in the cup (say, by lighting a
match in it before it is set on the skin) draws the blood to the surface.
The action is that of a mustard plaster.

My father, who was not a feldsher, used to shtel baynkes regularly to any
of us kids when a cold went in di brust.

Subject: Me and my feldsher

We were a family *zalbe zibn* -- a family of seven:  my widowed mother
and six children -- five girls and a boy.  (Sometimes I made a
_tshikaves_ a jocular puzzle:  "A strange thing happened in my family:
all my sisters had a brother, but I didn't have one"...).

Unable to afford visits of a real doctor for the various illnesses of her
young children, my mother would naturally call our neighborhood feldsher
who made house calls, as even real doctors would do in those days. Our
feldsher was a frequent visitor in our home, and he made my
"acquaintance" on too numerous occasions.  (I was too young an infant to
say that I made _ his_ "acquaintance.")

My afflictions apparently were too numerous for the ministrations from
his limited assortment of powders and varicolored bottles of drops, and
his prognosis was dark.

Many years later, when I was already grown-up, mother--zol zi hobn a
likhtikn ganeydn -- told me that this trusted family feldsher often
hinted gently at the hopelessness of my condition by asking her whether
she thought that there wouldn't be room enough on the cemetery.  [He may
have been an honest professional, and hoped to spare her the small
expense for his visits.]

Fortunately, whether thanks to his efforts or to my mother's tear-soaked
supplications to the Almighty to spare the life of the only male in her
family, I am still alive and kicking, and soon, I hope, to make a
_brokhe_ (blessing) on my book to be published within the next few weeks
(a childhood memoir but nothing about feldshers).

Subject: A mayse fun a feldsher

By way of illustration, here's a maysele that my zeyde published in his
landsmanshaft bulletin, The Keidaner, in January 1941, entitled Keidan
fun Amol, and translated by me this year ...

----------------------------
by B. Cassel

Reb Avrohom Einhorn, the Rabbi in Sukhovole, in the Grodno district,
barely made a living from his job. Therefore the rebbitsin, his jewel of
a wife, made a business shipping linen to Riga.

Once, when Reb Avrohom's son, Mordkhe, a youth of about 15, traveled to
Telszh to study in the yeshiva, he had to travel to Riga on a mission for
his mother's linen business.

Now the Libau-Romne train on which he traveled stopped at the Keidan
station. And since Keidan was the home of his father's brother, Reb
Meishl Ortziks Einhorn, Mordkhe stopped for a day to visit him.

His uncle, Reb Meishl Ortziks, a wealthy shopkeeper, received him in fine
style. His aunt, Sore Rive Tzviehs, made a lovely breakfast, and their
guest felt right at home.

But that night, after supper, after everyone had gone to sleep, the
visitor began to complain of a stomach ache; the pain grew worse and
worse, and really scared his uncle and aunt. Just then Keidan was
experiencing an outbreak of dysentery, which, because of the conditions
of the time, had claimed many lives.

They immediately summoned Dr. Layne. But when he didn't come quickly
enough, they called for Reb. Gabriel the feldsher, who came right away.

Reb Gabriel, a very wise man whose kind words and gentle manner could
ease the suffering of the sick, often carried his medicines with him,
especially during a time of epidemic. After examining the patient and
giving him a "powder" to take, he advised the sick man to lay warm
compresses on his stomach.

A few minutes after Reb Gabriel left, the doctor arrived.

Doctor Layne, a converted Jew whom people continued to call by his Jewish
name, Levit, was always in a foul mood, and spoke what few words he did
in an angry fashion. After interrogating the sick man, he wrote out a
prescription and told them to lay cold compresses on his stomach.

When the doctor had left, the worried aunt and uncle confronted their
quandry: What kind of compresses should they apply ? Cold, as the doctor
had ordered? Or warm, as Reb Gabriel had advised?

Reb Meishl, a pious, learned man, weighed whose advice he should follow.
With all his respect for the learning of the doctor, whom he nonetheless
despised as an apostate, he had confidence that God would help through
Reb Gabriel's advice, and he decided in favor of the warm compresses.

And God did help: thanks to the warm compresses Mordkhe recovered his
health. In fact Mordkhe grew up and became the famous stomach-specialist,
professor Max Einhorn of New York.

And thus Reb Gabriel, the Keidan feldsher, saved the life of the famous
stomach specialist, professor Einhorn of New York....

Subject: Feldsher

May I add another aspect to the feldsher story.  My wife works here in
Israel in a general  hospital and she had told me  that among the many
new Olim  from the ex-USSR who  work in the hospital,  nurses, doctors
etc., there are  also feldshers, or rather they were  feldshers in the
"old  country".  Her  impression  was  that they  were  there a  stage
between nurse and physician, and in  order to be recognized as a nurse
("qualified", or "registered"), they have to pass  exams (after taking
some courses).  BTW also physicians,  especially those who do not have
long experience,  have to pass some  exams before they are  allowed to
practice in Israel.

Subject: Yiddish in translation

I learned the Yiddish I know from my grandmother, my mother and my shule
days (1955-67), the Yiddish songs we sang being especially useful.  As a
very non-fluent, slow-reading student of Yiddish, I agree completely with
Hershl Hartman.   I began reading Sholem Aleichem stories in translation
when I was 11, and have loved them ever since; their beauty has
encouraged me to attempt reading them in the original.  But if I had to
look up the meaning of every single Yiddish word I don't know in every
single text I wanted to read (to say nothing of the Hebrew ones) while
trying to apprehend the ideas contained in the text, it would take
forever and be an exhausting experience.  Making Yiddish a kind of holy
tongue that must not be translated was a mistake before, as he points
out, and would be a worse mistake now.  Let's not insist that only one
kind of Yiddishkayt is valid; let us rather foment love for it on as many
paths as we can find.

Subject: Klor-vays tsigele

The klor-vays tsigele appears in the lullaby Rozhinkes mit Mandlen. Emil
Cohen, in one of his (two) Yiddish comedy/song albums, goes into a fairly
lengthy (and serious) discussion of the imagery in R mit M, including the
tsigele. I believe he says it represents Israel. I'd have to dig out the
record and listen to it, which I can do if people are really interested.

(It would be a good excuse to listen to the albums again.  The Gettysburg
Address, for example: "when our forefathers ... ven unzere fir tates ...
conceived in liberty ... zi hot geshvenget in Liberty -- a kleyn dorf
lebn Monticello ...")
