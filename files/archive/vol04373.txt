Subject: Introduction; Singer in Gaelic

My name is Roberta Saltzman, and I'm a librarian in the Jewish Division
of The New York Public Library. I catalog books in Hebrew and Yiddish and
I also work at the reference desk. I've completed a bibliography of I.B.
Singer's Yiddish works from 1960-1991, which will (I hope) be published
this year. And this brings me to my main reason for writing, which was a
query in Mendele Vol. 4.372.

Jonathan Dembling asks about the origin of a Gaelic translation of a
Singer story "the title of which translates into English as 'Jealousy'
... The title could also mean 'Zeal.' I've only just started to read the
story, but so far there is a Zalman and a Rabbi Meir in the village of
Radoszyce." I know of no Singer story that has "jealousy" or "zeal" in
the title, but I believe Mr. Dembling has a translation of one of the
stories that involve Zalman the glazier (who always tells about his
village, Radoszyce) and Meir the eunuch. I know of five stories in which
these characters appear:

1. "Dray mayses" appears in Yiddish in book form in "Der shpigl"
(Jerusalem, 1975). It was translated into English as "Three tales" in
"Short Friday, and other stories" (NY, 1964)

2. "Mayses fun hintern oyvn" appears in book form in the collection of
the same name (Tel Aviv, 1971) and in "Der shpigl". It was translated
into English as "Stories from behind the stove" in "A friend of Kafka"
(NY, 1970)

3. "Tayves" appeared in the journal "Goldene keyt", no. 87 (1975), pp.
16-26. It was translated into English as "Passions" in the collection of
the same name (NY, 1975)

4. "Tsvey hasenes un eyn get" appeared in the "Forverts" on April 24,
1977 (pp. C1, C2 and C19). It was translated into English as "Two
weddings and one divorce" in "Old love" (NY, 1979)

5. "Moon and madness" in "The collected stories of Isaac Bashevis Singer"
(NY, 1982). I haven't been able to identify the original Yiddish of this
story.

Of course, you need more plot details to determine which of these stories
was translated into Gaelic, but this is a start.

Subject: Isaac Bashevis Singer's story

Response to Jonathan Dembling.  The story appears in "The Collected
Stories" of Isaac Bashevis Singer under the title: Passions.  Published
by Farrar, Straus, Giroux - 1982, p.485.  I may have the Yiddish version,
but it may take a while to locate it.

Subject: The Russian medal

[Larry Rosenwald:]

The "accent" marks you referred to in your posting concerning the medal
you are trying to decipher are commonly used to indicate abbreviations
and numbers.  I 'm at a loss to explain the first set of characters (non
vov lamed resh vov), but the rest is fairly straightforward:

The second word is certainly Cheshvan.  This leads me to wonder:  Could
the first word be alef lamed resh ches?  This would stand for "Or lerosh
chodesh," the day before Rosh Chodesh.  Or if the first letter could be
ayin, it would be "Erev Rosh Chodesh," the day or evening before Rosh
Chodesh of the month of Cheshvan.

The next "word" is easy:  It's a date, using the numerical equivalents of
the letters: tav (400), resh (200), kaf (20) zayyin (7) = 627.  The
millennium is customarily omitted, since it hasn't changed in a sakh
yoren.  So the year is 5627, or 1866-67 in the common calendar.

And the last word is Slutsk (Pol. Sluck), a town in the area of Minsk in
Belorus.  It was occasionally part of Lithuania, at other times part of
Russia, and during some periods under the Radziwills.  Among its more
notable figures were Yosef Baer Soloveichik, a renowned rabbi, and many
Hebrew and Yiddish writers and prominent members of the haskalah and
Khibat Tzion movements.  According to the Encyclopedia Judaica (vol. 14,
pp. 1682-83), there was a Jewish settlement there from about 1583.  Its
ghetto was completely liquidated by the Nazis in 1942, and in 1970, very
few Jews lived there and there was "no semblance of Jewish life."

In any event, the medal evidently commemorates something that occurred in
Slutsk in Cheshvan, 1866-67.

Subject: The Russian medal

The town inscribed in the Russian medal is definitely Slutsk, which is my
mother's birth place and which I visited last summer.  It is 101 km south
of Minsk, with co-ordinates of 53 degrees 01' N./ 27 degrees 33' east.
The Yizkor book of Slutsk makes one mention of a Liberman, but only in
the index of the (small) English section only--a Bluma Liberman--but for
some reason the name does not appear on the page referred to.

Subject: HaKotev software

A friend demonstrated for me some Hebrew-Roman bilingual word-processing
software called HaKotev, for Windows. While not supporting Yiddish
specifically (no tsvey-vovn, pasekh-tsvey-yudn, etc.), it was quite
versatile, allowing the creation of side-by-side columns and switching
back and forth between left-to-right and right-to-left. Anyway, I decided
to buy a copy. But the company's listed number (in Provo, Utah) was
disconnected. Does anyone know if they are in still in business, or
whether the software is still available?

Subject: The Future of Yiddish -- Statistics and Opinions Needed

I am a university reference librarian trying to help out a student
interested in the future of Yiddish.  In particular, she wants statistics
on the numbers of speakers/writers of Yiddish and is also interested in
your opinions on the future of the language.  People can either post
(with the shames' permission) to this group and/or may e-mail me at
zimmerma@lib.uwo.ca with their (1) personal opinions or (2) citations to
not-too-obscure journal references or other bibliographic citations she
might want to use.
