Subject: Reb Engel's words

Khaver Engle zikht a pur 'shtarke' verter in Yidish, un ikh hob moyre...
khotsh men lost zikh arayn in sheltn....

Nu, zol es take nemen a _kholerie_, un a shvartze kholerie oykhet, az es
du a tzol vertlekh, un avade shelt vertlekh: 

'a shvartze mapule'
'oysgerisen/farbrent zol er/zi vern'
Zol trefn:'a miese m'shine';
'a make'
By the way, an animal does not die (shtarb), se 'peygert'...."Mayn ferd
hot 'gepeygert'...The word has been used in other (un-nice ways)...

 Men ken oykhet farmakhn dem pisk (crude for: shut your mouth);
Di markziters dortn in di alte tzaytn hobn di verter gekent gantz gut, un
es iz take gegangen vi vaser...(The market women in the old days knew the
crude words quite well, and they really flowed like water)

Other Mendlyaners may want to translate...or have other choice ones.

Does anyone remember: hinyekes fun gepeygerte ferd??? That may be what
this little post is worth!! And there are also some choice
Polish/Goyish/Russian words...

Subject: Dovid Greenberg or David Ben Yishay

Having been unable to read Mendele postings in recent weeks, we are unaware
if our note and poems we printed by Dovid Greenberg in our column "Perl fun
der yidisher poezye" were acknowledged in Mendele.  This was in response to a
grandson's query about his grandfather's biography.  If not, let us inform
that such an item appeared in the Sept. l2th issue of the Forverts.  
Azoy vi mir hobn nit gezen di mendele-post zint etlekhe vokhn, veysn mir nit

Subject: Anarchism in Yiddish

This is a follow-up to Hugh Denman's response to John Patten's query re
Anarchism in Yiddish.  There was an anarchist colony in New Jersey called
Stelton, whose papers are at Rutgers University, Special Collection. These
anarchists, almost all Russian Jewish immigrants, did not want to be 
identified necessarily as Jewish, but their main publication was Der Frey
Arbiter Shtimme, edited by Sam Freedman, who also lived in Stelton.. It was a
completely Yiddish publication, the only language its subscribers could read.
Its pages are full of Anarchist ideology and news of the American anarchist
colonies, which, like Stelton, had many Jewish members. Stelton deserves a
book, in case someone is looking for a topic.

Subject: Summertime

Song lyrics time again!  Ever since I read that the great composer Sholem 
Secunda refused to accept George Gershwin as an assistant, I've felt Jewish 
music potentially lost many jazz influenced classic songs.  Still, many of 
Gershwin's tunes sound, to me, to have that 'Yiddishe tam', especially the 
minor key ones.

Since Yiddish words have been written for The Anniversary Song, then maybe it
would be as fitting to have some of Gershwin's melodies similarly treated.
For instance, Sefra Burstin from Melbourne has described an Australian summer
in her original words for Gershwin's Summertime:

Zumer teg, s'brent di zun vi a fayer
Aza veter, me ken oysgeyn fun hits
Khotsh s'iz 'dushne' iz es nokh a mekhaye
Zikh tsu vayln farbrent un farshvitst

I'd love to know a second verse, or any other singable Yiddish words to this 
tune, whether translations of the original English text or not.

Subject: Dr. M. Reznikoff

An acquaintance (parents of kids in our kids' school) was recently in Israel
and returned with a message for us: they met a Dr. M. Reznikoff, who (in their
words) "promotes Yiddish worldwide", and he was interested in hearing from us
(given that we're raising our kids in Yiddish). 

I have neither the time nor inclination to start new paper-mail correspondence
at present, but perhaps someone knows Dr. Reznikoff? If he's interested in our
family, he'd no doubt be interested in everything going on on MENDELE, not to
mention Yugntruf and its activities. (Speaking of which, Yugntruf's annual
yidish-vokh, which just finished Sept. 2, was wonderful as usual.) Then again,
maybe he's on MENDELE already; the name is vaguely familiar.

Subject: a fargreserter vebsblat

Mendele's website, http://www2.trincoll.edu/~mendele is now considerably
enlarged from what it was at its inception.  It now includes links to the most
recent issues as well as all of Volume 7.  The contents of Volumes 1 through 6
are also available and links to _all_ individual issues will be installed over
time. 

Other additions will be showing up in the near future.  Suggestions and
comments are welcome.

As before, warm thanks to Iosif Vaisman, Victor Bers and Leonard Prager for
their help and encouragement.  And a special thanks to Paul Miller, who has
been particularly helpful to his html-phobic father.

Subject: Yiddish phrasebook for travelers - again!

Remember the frustration when you were looking last time for that elusive
Swahili-Yiddish or Yiddish-Basque phrasebook? Young Berkeley physicist
Michael Martin designed a remedy for such frustrations. His website "Foreign
Languages for Travelers" (http://www.travlang.com/languages) provides the
on-screen phrasebooks for any pair of 52 languages, including Yiddish. 
Acknowledgements page suggests that Michael Martin shares the credit for the
Yiddish part of the collection with Shlomo Lerman. All 102 phrasebooks
containing Yiddish come in both Yiddish letters and reasonably good (although
not standard and not completely consistent) transliteration. Renderings of
some words and phrases might be questionable, but the traveler using this
phrasebook will be understood. There are some other shortcomings in the
Yiddish pages. Unlike many other languages in Travlang, Yiddish lacks
soundfiles, associated with all the words and phrases. Hopefully, they would
be added. The site uses state flag icons as logos for all languages and as
the page background for the respective pages. Assignment of the Israeli flag
to Yiddish pages provokes certain ambivalence. Even more importantly, all
languages on Travlang site are accompanied by a brief geographical description
(e.g. "Finnish is spoken in Finland", "Galician [not Galitsianer - i.v.] is
spoken in Spain and Portugal", etc.). Yiddish is the only language where this
remark uses past tense: "Yiddish originated in Germany, Poland, Lithuania, and
Ukraine", and does not mention any current status - effectively classifying
Yiddish as a dead language. (Even the Latin page says: "Latin is officially
spoken in the Vatican"). The necessary improvements can be made (suggestions
from the Mendele subscribers might be very helpful for the site authors) and
the Travlang-armed travelers would not have to resort to gesticulation in
expressing simple "Ikh farshtey nisht".

Subject: "strong" language

I'm responding to Marvin Engel's query about "strong" language. My
contribution to this category is "cholerieh," clearly a reference to cholera,
and no doubt the ultimate metaphor of random evil and disgust.

Subject: Verterbukh

I am interested in the dictionary that was edited by Yitskhok Neborski and
Shemen Noyberg, Vorterbukh Bibliotheque Medem.  It was mentioned in one of
the messages on Mendele....I would like to see the book to see if it would
help me in my studies.  If anyone has the e-mail address of the publisher
please e-mail it to me.  

Thank you,

Subject: Need Poem for Headstone

I am writing to ask where I might look for a short, appropriate Yiddish poem
to be put on my mother's headstone.  She passed away in April, and my father,
though fluent in Yiddish, is not a poet.  My Yiddish skills are nowhere near
good enough to even consider writing something myself.

Yet my mother loved poetry, and we both feel that the right Yiddish poem would
be an appropriate way to memorialize how we felt about her.

Any suggestions or pointers are much appreciated.

Thanks
