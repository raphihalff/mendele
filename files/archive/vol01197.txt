Ellen,   Edward Stankiewicz, at Yale, would be particularly
interested in your critique of Wexler. I don't know if he's
on E-mail.

Subject: Yiddish incomprehensible to German speakers

My father told me the following joke related to the German
occupation of (then Russian) Poland during the First World
War:

A German soldier asks a Jew: "Sprechen Sie Deutsch?" The
Jew replies: "A Shalah?"

The story attributed to Sam Norich at YIVO is to be found
in Olsvanger's ROYTE POMERANTSN--in an anecdote called
"Daytsh". If there are any of you who are not familiar with
this book (a Schocken paperback) I'd strongly recommend it.
It's a collection of jokes and anecdotes in latin-letter
transcription  of the author's Kurland (Northwest Latvian)
Yiddish dialect. Try it, you'll love it.

Subject: Introduction

I am a professor of religious studies at the University of
Kansas.  I have a 1974 Ph.D. from Brandeis University on
the theology of Abraham Joshua Heschel.  I have published
several books on modern Jewish thought, on Hebrew
literature, and on Jewish ethics.  Most recently I have
published a book on Hayyim Nahman Bialik and a Modern
Jewish Theology.  I am continuing to work on Bialik
focusing now on his view of Hebrew culture.
 
I have an interest not only in Hebrew literature but also
in Yiddish literature which, however, I usually read in
translation (either in Hebrew or in English).

Subject: Ben Ami

I know this is a question that shows my ignorance, but...
Can anyone tell me about the writer Ben Ami.   Shalom
Aleichem's sketch "Arba sheyashavnu" describes a meeting
between himself, Bialik, Mendele, and Ben Ami, but I know
very little about Ben Ami.

Thanks.
