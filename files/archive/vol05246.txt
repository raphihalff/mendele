Subject: Pluperfect

thanks, meyer wolf, for that crystal-clear summary [5.245] of the tense
situation! your post is a 'keeper', as they say. my only addition is one that
i personally believe impinges on some that you've mentioned: the loss
throughout eastern yiddish of the germanic 'sequence of tense' system,
replaced by the slavic style. i mean the difference exemplified below between
english and yiddish:

said on friday:
montik hot er gezogt az er VET kumen mitvokh (ober er iz nit gekumen).
monday he said that he WOULD come on wednesday (but he didn't come.)

[notice you can't say in english 'monday he said he will come on wednesday' if
you mean a previous wednesday.]

anyway, once the sequence of tense system changed, the frequency of all these
'fancy' tenses (pluperfect, future perfect, past conditional...) had to drop
enormously -- and i would bet that that's what inspired all these changes. one
possibly irrelevant note: french has effectively also lost the preterite, at
least in the spoken language-- but its pluperfect seems to be alive and well.
and it has a germanic-style sequence of tense system rather than a
slavic-style.

btw, goldwasser (for whom i publicly thank the very kind jerry sadock, a
discreet lurker in our midst :) ) also relates the changes in the pluperfect
to the changes in the sequence of tense system but, if i understand him
correctly, sees the causality the other way -- that the loss of the pluperfect
killed the sequence of tense system. while i can't see that, i _was_ thrilled to
learn from his paper that both hungarian and modern hebrew have a 'poorly
developed' pluperfect _and_ have a slavic-style sequence of tense system. re
modern hebrew, would you know if this is a recent development? what kind of
sequence of tense system did biblical hebrew have, would you know? and what
about its pluperfect? the plot thickens... :)

nokh a mol, thanks for that great summary!

Subject: Pluperfect, conditional, auxiliaries, hobn/zayn distinction

To answer Meyer Wolf's question [5.245], there's a bit more to be said about
the conditional.  Sorry, I haven't the time maarikh tsu zayn, but here's a
kitser-hadover:

ven ikh het gevust... mekht ikh ... (still around for some speakers -- I know
of litvishe and Bukovinan)

ven ikh zol/visn geven visn (where I think *gehat is totally out) -- our
beloved moderator Noyekh Miller is a consistent user of this type of
conditional, where a plain old counterfactual conditional is intended, not
necessary a perfect conditional (i.e. the form means 'if I knew,' not
necessarily 'if I had known')

ven ikh zol visn -- a counterfactual conditional using the typical subjunctive
auxiliary _zol_.  Coupled with _ven_, it gives you a counterfactual reading.

ven ikh veys dos volt ikh (ge)kumen frier -- where the verb in the if-clause
is in the present tense and the conditional is crucially introduced _ven_.
(There are other 'if'-words in Yiddish, e.g. tomer, oyb, az, but curiously
only _ven_ can be used in this context.)

Subject: Gevald

Shoshana Balaban-Wolowicz (5.244,2) questions my coinage "Gevald Nayn-Elf" in
the sense of an emergency and "gevald geshrien" (or geshrign) as a scream for
help.

She bases her questioning on the meaning of the word "gevald in the folk
song:

Sha shtil,
makht nit kayn gerider,
der rebe geyt shoyn tantsn vider;
sha shtill makht nit kayn _gevald_
der rebe geyt shoyn tantsn bald...

I believe that in this instance "gevald" should be interpreted contextually
within the described event.  "Makht nit kayn gerider" says 'do not make a
tuml' [tumult] and 'makht nit kayn gevald' conveys a plea to the rebbe's
followers to give him spatial room and air for his joyous dance, and not to be
carried away with it...  So, I suggest, "gevald" here is a kind of poetic
license, rhyme-induced by _'bald'_, and not to be taken literally.

On the other hand, it may well be a lyricist's dittological device to repeat
in different words the line 'makht nit kayn gerider' but with several decibels
higher, namely 'makht nit kayn gevald,' since _gevald_ is indeed a 'geshrey'
(or 'gesgray'), that is a loud, warning call, but here not an emergency plea
but rather, again, a poetic way of raising the level of 'tuml'...

And what if the anonymous writer of the song was a _misnaged_, an opponent to
khsides, and the intent of the ditty was to make fun of the khsidim, of their
unrestrained responses at the rebbe's every gesture and motion, and their
interpreting them in "holy" ways, meanings, and messages?...

According to this tentative suggestion, 'makht nit kayn gevald' would mean a
plea to the khsidim not to get, at the sight of their rebbe's dancing, in a
state of "hispayles" [enthusiasm], and, for no rhyme or reason (in this
misnaged's view), lose their senses to the point of a "gevald"...

Thus, it is all in the eye and ear of the reader...
