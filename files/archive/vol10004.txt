Subject: science fiction in Yiddish

David Hewitt asks about science fiction in Yiddish. Although I've made the
argument in a book review once that Yosef Perl's Megale tmirin is a kind of
science fiction (if you're willing to accept practical kabole as a kind of
science...) science fiction proper owes its start, like so much of our
literature, to Mendele Moykher-Sforim, who translated a Jules Verne novel
into Yiddish in the late 1860s, then parodied parts of his translation in
the balloon sequences of Di kliatshe.... I know that works by Verne, Jack
London, and H.G. Wells were translated into Yiddish during the glory days of
Yiddish publishing (from about the 1890s until the 1930s). Keep in mind that
articles on science, and science as a general topic of discussion was of
enormous interest in secular Yiddish circles of that era; an article about
Darwinism is, for example, the only really memorable entry in the first
number of Di tsukunft (1892).

As far as original science fiction novels in Yiddish, I know of only one
genuine example: Af yener zayt Sambatyon, by one L. Borodulin (1929).
Borodulin was a Yiddish journalist who wrote mostly science articles for Der
Tog. His novel, by the way, earns a footnote in Irving Howe's World of Our
Fathers (p. 546). My wife and I have read the first 50 or so pages together;
it's mostly pretty entertaining--about a journalist in search of a mad
scientist who has found his way to the land of the Red Jews after having
invented a death ray. The Sambatyon river, it turns out, is made of a series
of geysers--hence the regular eruptions that have prevented travelers (all
accept this scientist and journalist, apparently) from crossing it all these
years.... An intriguing mix of (Jewish) mythology and contemporary
problems--like all the best science fiction in other languages.

Subject: Ry(h)pishche

Dear Mendele:

Percy Mett inquired about the name rifishtsches or ripishtshches. Possibly
it is the Jewish name for a village Ry(h)pishche or Ry(h)bishche.  I would
be able to say more if the name of a nearby shtetl was given. Regards to
all.

Subject: More on pamelekh

Dear Mendele Editors,

Only recently have I seen for the first time this oytser of yiddisher
folklore, and what not. Yisher koekh!

Roaming through the 1998 issues I noticed numerous speculations about the
source of the word pamelekh. To my knowledge it comes from the Hebrew
'pa'amei melekh', meaning "steps of a king". To move pamelekh means,
therefore, to move with the pace of a king, i.e. slowly, but with
confidence. A freilekher Pessakh zu alle.

Subject: Ferd-fus-podkeves an eynikl

When this expression was queried on Mendele some weeks back, my friend,
Lilian Dubb in Cape Town, remarked that the common form of the expression as
used in her home, was: "Ferd-fus-podkeves an eynikl" - ' Grandchild of a
horse's hoof's shoe. '

The other day reading Chaim Grade's, "Di mames Shabosim," I found Grade
using exactly that form of the expression on p. 163, where Maraisha says:
"Es darf haynt kumen tsu undz a gast, mayn mans a kroyve, ferd-fus-podkeves
an eynikl." In the English version it is on p. 136: "I'm expecting a guest
today, some distant relation of my husband's - some 'grandchild of a horse's
hoof's shoe.'"

This of course is not surprizing considering that Grade came from Vilna in
Lithuania, the country where most South African Jews originate.

Subject: Lev Berinski

Born 6.4.1939 Kauschan/bessarabia now Rumania, since 1991 in israel, 1997
Itzig-Manger-Award, his adress in 1997 was: Rehov Golomb 39, 24721 Akko,
Israel Lev Berinski took part in the February 1997 Congress in Berlin "100
Jahre Juedischer Arbeiterbund", which had been the "11. Jiddische
Kulturtage" In my article in "Allgemeine Juedische Wochenzeitung" Vol 52:03
(6.2.1997) you can get a little impression of him and this.

In the congress' little brochure you will find two small texts from Berinski
which previously had been published in "Naje Wegn" 1995. Contact /booklet
thru:
    
Centrum Judaicum, Oranienburger Strasse 29, D 10177 Berlin, Germany, Tle:
0049- 30 - 28401242 (ask for Andrej Jendrusch or his deskmate)

Berinski published a very fine text in 1997:

     Rendsburger Mikwe

result of his visit 1995 there is this poem, published in jiddish with
hebrew and "latin" transcription and a german translation, accompanied by
pictures of the than current exhibition. The "Rendsburger Mikwe" itself is
now a little jewish museum in this northern german baltic sea coast town,
hosting jewish artist every year. the poem/brochure could be ordered as
"catalog 17" at

    Juedisches Museum Rendsburg, 24768 Rendsburg, Germany

Biographical information about berinski you will find also in an article by
Juergen Serke in DIE ZEIT 2.12.1994, Page 71 which is reviving his time as
the "Wandering Accordeonist" in opposition to the soviet youth Komosomolsk
and as a "Zero-mensh":
    
"He, panurge!" werden zetern di Jiddn oifm Markt "Wus farkoifsti?"
"Meridn!" "Host a jiddischn kop! Wejst wus? Baschnaid sech und t„uf sech
zirik!"

Subject: farreysht

In the newsgroup soc.genealogy.jewish, Sharon Cooper asked about the word
"farreysht", but no one has come up with a definition:

   In a story of someone's reminiscences from Poland, they talked about the
   potato soup "farreysht mit mel un grivn".

What does this word mean and how is it spelled?
