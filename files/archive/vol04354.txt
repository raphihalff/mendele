Subject: Songbooks with Yiddish lullabies

In answer to the query by Sam Abrash, _ Mir trogn a gezang_ (available
from the Workmen's Circle)  has the words and music for "Rozshinkes mit
mandlen" and other lullabies.  I'm sure that others on Mendele will
recommend the other songbook available fromthe Workmen's Circle (I don't
recall thename just this moment and my copy is far away across the
ocean). B'sha'a tova, to the father-to-be and the mother-to-be, as well
as the daughter-to-be!

Sam Abrash bet undz far vig-lider.

The Workmen's Circle Song Books, "Mir Trogn a Gezang " or "Favorite
Yiddish Songs" by Eleanor Mlotek are the same book and contain "Rozhinkes
mit Mandlen," "Patshe Kikhelekh," "Yankele," "Oyfn Pripetshik" and more.

Jewish Book Center/Workmen's Circle, 45 East 33rd Street, New York, N.Y.
10016.

"Jewish Folk Songs" compiled with English adaptations by Ruth Rubin
contains "Amol Iz Geven A Mayse," which is one my mother would sing
to me. Also "Bay Dem Shtetl Shteyt a Shtibl," "Dremlen Feygl Oyf Di
Tsvaygn," "Mayn Yingele" "Shlof Mayn Kind, Mayn Treyst, Mayn Sheyner" and
more but no "Rozhinkes..."

"The Yiddish Song Book" by Jerry Silverman contains "Rozhinkes..,"
"Unter Dem Kinds Vigele," Shlof, Mayn Feygele," "Shlof, Mayn Kind,"
"Vigndig a Fremd Kind," "Bay Dem Shtetl..." & more.

All three books can be gotten from the Workmen's Circle or the National
Yiddish Book Center, I'm sure.  Often a local Jewish Book Store will have
the book or can order it.  All three contain the words in English and
Romanized Yiddish, the melody notes with chords.  Silverman has guitar
chords but no Yiddish with Hebrew letters.  Rubin contains delightful
illustrations with the Yiddish in the back;  Mlotik fine illustrations
and the Yiddish printing with each song.

Subject: The young shtifer, Sholem-Aleykhem

My family's Yiddish was shaped by Sholem-Aleykhem's Yiddish which is my
favorite.  When I read Sholem-Aleykhem I seem to hear my family speaking
again.  No wonder I am curious about the character and personality of
Sholem-Aleykhem.  Others probably have a similar curiosity.  His writing
is so widely loved.

In childhood he was a shtifer (a mischievous prankster).  A charmingly
mischievous child often receives adults' encouragement, and sometimes
grows up to try similar shtiferay.  An anecdote by J.H. Ravnitski offers
a glimpse of Sholem-Aleykhem's shtiferish bent in young adulthood (age
29).  In 1888 Sholem-Aleykhem walked into Ravnitski's printing shop in
Odessa and...

Ravnitski writes:

Beshas drukn *Stempenyu* hob ikh zikh dos ershte mol perzenlekh bakent
mit Sholem-Aleykhemen.  Ikh zits in druk, kumt arayn a yungerman un git a
freg dem druker, vu men ken gefinen Ravnitskin, un yener vayzt im on af
mir.

"Ikh kum itst fun Kiev," zogt mir der yungerman, "Un ikh hob aykh
gebrakht a frayndlekhn gris fun a gutn bakantn."

"Avade fun Sholem-Aleykhemen."

"Glaykh vi getrofn."

Ikh nem zikh derfregn baym yungenman vegn Sholem-Aleykhemen, un er
entfert mir af eynike shayles, nisht af ale, vayl er ken im eygntlekh nor
fun dem vos er bagegnt im oft, kemot yedn tog, af der berze.  Azoy
dertseylt er mir un bavayzt nisht derbay keyn simen fun a shmeykhl.  Biz
ikh hob fun eyn tshuve zikh ongeshtoysn, az dos iz nisht mer vi a shpas,
un der yungerman iz take Sholem-Aleykhem aleyn.

Ikh muz zikh moyde zayn az tsum onheyb bin ikh geven a bisl antoysht. Der
shpas iz mir nisht ingantsn gefeln, un bikhlal hob ikh zikh nisht azoy
oysgemolt Sholem-Aleykhemen.  HaZot na-ami? [Hebrew interjection?] Ot der
oysgeputster, frantisher yungermantshik mitn kaylekhikn hitl in a zayt,
mitn gantsn oyszen fun a halb berze-soykher halb artist -- dos iz
Sholem-Aleykhem, der barimter shrayber?

My translation:

I met Sholem-Aleykhem in person for the first time while printing
*Stempenyu*.  I'm at the printing shop when a young man walks in and asks
the printer where Ravnitski might be found.  The printer points to me.

"I've just come from Kiev, and bring you warm regards from a confrere you
know very well," says the young man.

"That must be from Sholem-Aleykhem."

"Right on target."

I begin to ask questions about Sholem-Aleykhem, and he answers some of
them, not all, of course, because he knows him only through meeting him
almost every day at the stock exchange.  That was his story, told without
the slightest trace of a smile.  Finally, I gathered from one of his
replies that this was just a prank.  The young man was none other than
Sholem-Aleykhem.

I must admit that at first I was somewhat disappointed.  I was not
entirely pleased by the trick, and I hadn't visualized Sholem-Aleykhem
like this.  So elegant?  This here well-dressed, foppish young guy with a
round little hat cocked to one side, all in all appearing to be half
stock merchant, half artist -- this is Sholem-Aleykhem, the famous
writer?  [Tsum Ondenk Fun Sholem-Aleykhem (In Memory of Sholem-Aleykhem),
ed. I. Zinberg, and S. Niger, Petrograd: I.L. Peretz-Fund, 1917, p. 50]

Because of length I didn't set the two languages side by side.

Subject: Selma Meerbaum-Eisinger

Selma Meerbaum-Eisinger was like her second cousin Paul Celan a most
talented poet from Czernowitz in the Bukowina. She died just 18 years
old in the Concentration Camp Michailowka, Ukraina in July 1942. Just 57
poems could be saved: 51 originals in German, 6 translations. One of a
Rumanian poet, one by Paul Verlaine translated into Yiddish "Harbst-lid"
and into German and two translated from Yiddish into German: Itzik
Manger's "Ikh bin der veg keyn mayrev" un H. Lejwik's "Shloflid". In the
printed facsimilie just the two first stanzas in Selma`s own hand-writing
are given:

                      Leyg dem kop(f) oyf meyne kni,
                      s`gut azoy tsu lign.
                      Kleyne kinder shlofn shoyn,
                      groyse muz men vign.

                      Kinder hobn shpilekhlekh,
                      shpiln ven zey viln.
                      Groyse shpiln nor mit zikh,
                      muzn eybik shpiln.

Who knows the last two stanzas of this wonderful song of Lejwik?

Ruben Frankenstein
