Subject: word comments

re shmoolyares:  I've never heard this word, but after thinking about the
various theories other Mendeleans have supplied, I wonder why the
American slang term of unknown origin "moolah" hasn't been tossed into
the picture. moolah ~ shmoolah, in the well-known formula, would get us
almost there, and the rest could be influenced by "dollars..."

re nebbish.  Although "toosh" is used for "tokhes", they may not be
connected at all.  My friend and colleague Peter Maher once did a
brilliant treatment of "toosh", pointing out 1st, that the consonant
alternation is NOT yiddish, 2nd, tokhes of course is good hebrew, and is
not widespread among non-Jews, whereas 3) "tush" has a good independent
etymon and IS well-known among non- Jews:  it is the German (borrowed
from French) "Tousch" (not sure of German spelling), meaning "flourish",
and refering to the saucy gesture of raising the skirts while ppointing
the fanny.  This gesture in turn conceals an older and widespread
European ppeasant custom (and not only European!) in which women
displayed contempt (usually for a man) by actually displaying the part in
question (they didn't wear anything under their long skirts, so it wasn't
so hard).  Note how we use the rather affectionate "tush" for the child's
bare fanny.  And this is not only Jewish usage! The association of this
word with Yiddish tokhas < Heb tokhat may be a secondary false
etymologization.  There are English words that are felt to be Yiddish,
like "tumult", and Yiddish american words that look English but aren't,
like "derma" for "kishke".

Subject: Wexler and Jewish genetics

Some time ago Mendleniks got into a wandering discussion on Jewish
genetics. Our shames felt (and I believe rightly so) that it was taking
us too far afield from the purpose of this Yiddish group. However we
recently heard a report of a new book by Wexler claiming that Yiddish
really comes from a Slavic substratum  rather than via the immegration
route from the Mediterranian up through France into Germany and hence to
eastern Europe. At the expense of reopening the genetic discussion I
would like to point out that modern genetic analysis of Jewish poulations
in Europe, North Africa and the middle east makes Wexler's scenario
highly unlikely.

I have managed to track down the references to the DNA analysis of the
Jewish population of central Europe, the middle east and North Africa.
The original reference is:

Samuel Karlin,Ron Kebet and Batsheva Bonne-Tamir, "Analysis of
Biochemical Genetic Data of Jewish Populations" American Journal of Human
Genetics 31 (1979) pp.341-365.

In that paper Karlin,et.al. (Stanford Univ.) presented data describing
the gene frequency distribution for 14 different genetic markers among 9
Jewish and 6 non-Jewish populations. The conclusion reached was that
Ashkenazic and Sephardic populations (from Germany, Poland, Russia,
Libya, Moracco,Iran Iraq,Yemen and Egypt) were similar to each other in
genetic profile and distant from the non-Jewish populations with whom
they were compared (i.e. Germans, Poles,Russians, Iranians, Arabs,
Armenians). To quote Karlin: the data is consistent with the thesis that
"the present day Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews were the remnants of several
small Jewish populations of the 14th and 15th centuries.... Since the
Christian reconquest at the end of the Middle Ages, the contribution of
non-Jews to the Jewish gene pool has been extremely small."

I'm not sure where this leaves any linguistic considerations, but what
seems clear is that langauge seems to mix a lot more easily than genes.
It is also clear that the Slavic input into the Jewish gene pool is as
miniscule as that of the Arabs. In fact the genetic markers demonstrate
that the North African Sephardim are much closer genetically to the
central European Ashkenazim than either group is to their immediate
European or Middle eastern neighbors. It is also quite consistent with
the scenario of the Ashkenazim stemming from those comunities who fled
north to the Rhineland while the Sephardim fled south and east to the
Ottomans. Of course there were already Jewish communities existing in
France and the Rhineland at the time of the Christian reconquest, as well
as Jewish communities existing in Palistine, Georgia and the former
Khazaria. It is a puzzlement as to how those few and widely seperated
communities retained their distictive common genetic identity without
positing considerable interaction between them.

For those who might want further references (as well as a discussion of
the Falasha Question which may lead us too far afield) I refer you to:

Karen Bacon, "A Biochemical Response to an Halakhic Challenge: The Case
of the Ethiopian Jews" The Torah U-Madda Journal,3 (1991-1992) pp.1-7.

Subject: muz/darf nebish/nebakh

Searching the inner resouces which guide my usage I find that "muz" is an
unequivocal "must" while "darf" is closer to "have to" with a slight
tinge of "ought". Of course a full blown "ought" is "zol". e.g.

Ikh muz gehn.  I must go.
Ikh darf gehn. I have to go.
Ikh zol gehn. I ought to go.

The problem of course is that the demarcation of the boarders among the
three modals is not sharp.

Nebish - nebakh iz a gants andere zakh. Kuk mol: Zayn zun iz nebakh a
nebish. Vos mer darf men zogn? Vos mer zol men zogn? Vos mer muz men
zogn?

Subject: poem "Aliles dam"

A friend tells me that she used to read a poem entitled "Aliles dam"
(about blood libel) around Pesach time when the Sholem Aleichem shul
still existed in Madison.  She asks me if I know who wrote it and where I
could locate it.  Does anyone know?

Subject: Feygelakh un andere

A dank alemen for wonderful facts and speculations re "feygele."  Don't
understand though how it could be related to "feig", another word
entirely, despite its coital reference.  D. HarPaz came up with two
important pieces of evidence--her bobe's attestation of use in Poland
(admittedly anecdotal, but maybe others will come forward), and perhaps
more significantly, her cite of the Hebrew slang term "parpar."  It
occurs to me that this may translate Yiddish zumerfeygele for butterfly,
with feygele a shortening or a misunderstanding by the majority (?) of
Yiddish speakers not familiar with this regional term.  Butterfly of
course from metaphorical associations with sterotypical gay traits, as in
Spanish "mariposa" for gay male.  Vos denkt ir fun dos?

In Stutchkov's "Oytser", #105, in between words for impotent and eunuch,
he has yishen al (ayin lamed) bayso (bay yod sof vov)--not in standard
dictionaries--anyone know what this means?

Is Ellen Prince's "Lekish Ber" a relative of "Leka Speya (zie fliet ahin
on ahea)" also a nonsense answer to who's there?

What was Bashevis Singer's story about two young men, yeshiva bokherim,
who fall in love and move off to a large Polish city, where one of them
dresses as a woman in order for them to remain together, until he dies
and the khevre kadisha discovers his true gender.  Appeared in the New
Yorker maybe 8-10 years ago, have never seen it in any collections of his
stories, let alone in Yiddish.  I'd be take a freylikher yid to get this
reference from some good Mendelnik[este].

Subject: Mail.Yiddish Archive

Thank you David Sherman for creating the wonderful archive of
mail.Yiddish materials.  I successfully and easily was able to download
several of the issues and am already sad that there were so few.

And to think, "nisht a hin, nisht a hare" was in the first issue in 1988!

Bob Hoberman: Add to your list: patlezhan(es) a/baklezhanes etc. and,if
you will pardon the expression, pots.

Kathleen Noe: Nope! fayg won't work. Wrong vowel. It's fayg/fa:g but
feygl/faygl. Sorry.

Subject: Addendum re Turkish words

Bob Hoberman, Concerning my last suggestion that "pots" is a word of
Turkish origin, I will readily concede that it may be Greek instead. It's
generally well known in the Aegean area.

Without going into the long spiel once again, I'd like to try to put to
rest the oft-repeated myths about Yiddish "pots" and German "Putz and
between "shmok" and German "Smuck". There is no credible connection in
either case.

Subject:  Anski exhibit

Lewis Leavitt asks about an Anski exhibit in Europe.

The exhibit is currently at the National Museum in Jerusalem and is
clearly of interest to all who want to know what life was like in
pre-World War I Galicia and the Ukraine.

It is difficult for the viewer to factor out elements of prejudice and
argumentation on the part of those who arranged the exhibit and on
Anski's part, himself.  The impression gained is that the Jews of the
small towns of this area at that time lived a life heavily suffused with
primitive superstition, fear, dirt and ignorance.

And of course all this is a subjective judgement made 75 years after the
material was collected.
