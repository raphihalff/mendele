Subject: Rogelakh

I know this was discussed not too long ago, but can't find it in my
Mendele files, so--could someone remind me of the etymology of "rog," in
rogelakh. Also, whence the --lakh diminutive plural ending?  Slavic or
what?  Thanks in advance.

Subject: Marketing Yiddish :: farkoyfn yidish

Mr Joseph Sherman asked about ideas for 'marketing Yiddish'. We've heard
many excellent reasons from some of our mendele subscribers. I'd like to
add some information for Mr. Sherman's PR work which might be useful:

* In Israel, Yiddish is recognized by the Ministry of Education as a
language which may be studied for high school matriculation.  There are
now 55 schools offering Yiddish to about 3000 students at the elementary
and high school level.  This number is growing steadily.  Some of the
students are Israeli born 'Sabras', some are new immigrant children.
Most are of Ashkenazic origin, but many Sephardic students are enjoying
the richness of Yiddish.  There are also excellent faculties at the
Bar-Ilan, Hebrew (Jerusalem) and Tel-Aviv Universities.

* There is now a proposal awaiting its 3rd hearing in the Knesset
supporting the creation of an official government overseeing body to
support Yiddish Language and Culture. The first two hearings passed
almost unanimously. - about 40 out of 120 (?) members of the Knesset were
present. (A parallel Ladino proposal was also passed). Presented by Dov
Shilansky it was supported by both Sephardic and Ashkenazic Members of
the Knesset, by both Left & Right, the Ultra-Orthodox and Arab MKs. The
proposal was initiated by the Dor Hahemshekh Ohavei Yidish.

* At a recent meeting of the World Council for Yiddish in Tel Aviv, the
chairman Prof. Warshavsky made a startling announcement: He has received
assurances, that all Israeli Shlikhim negating or otherwise doing harm to
Yiddish will promptly be reprimanded and called back. Furthermore, all
future shlikhim will be prepared in advance to understand their role in
promoting Yiddish in the Diaspora.

----------------------------------------

Those last two are still dreams for me, and haven't been put into effect
yet. What is important, is the ground work which has been put in in the
last ten, or so, years is beginning to wake people up.

Subject: Expanded definition of mentsh

A current thread has been attempting to find one word equivalents for
"mentsh" in other languages. Let me take the opposite track and provide a
very expanded definition in English. The origins of the following
"definition" are unknown to me. If anyone knows, please let us know so
appropriate credit can be given. I have taken the original wording and
brought it up to date by making it more politically correct, gender
neutral, and more widely applicable to people of any religion. Hope you
like it.

                          Mentshlikhkayt

I grew up under a slogan - zay a mentsh.

My mother pleaded. zay a mentsh, by which she meant carry a handkerchief,
wash your neck, comb your hair, dress properly. She tried to make a
civilized human being from a kid who really couldn't care less.
Cleanliness, order, appearances were important to her. A diamond in the
rough was to her a nothing until it was cut, polished, and set. She had a
point. She, in her own way, was advancing a civilization, a culture, a
more developed society. She tried to instill in me a self-respect - not a
pride, mind you, but an awareness of the dignity of human beings. After
all, a person is not an animal. Zay a mentsh.

My father shouted in despair. Zay a mentsh, by which he meant do your
chores, be kind to your siblings, respect your elders. He tried to make a
disciplined, conscientious, thoughtful provider from a kid who had more
interest in toys, sports, and fun with friends. Work and dependability
were more important to him. Slothfulness and self-indulgence were
abhorrent and somehow sinful. Even an offense against God. Six days shalt
thou labor, on the seventh you'll rest. After all, a person is not an
animal. Zay a mentsh.

Amongst my dearest memories are those of my grandparents. My grandmother
sighed and smiled and fed me chocolate cake. Zay a mentsh, she said
indulgently, patting me on the head. By which she meant many things. Like
remember birthdays and anniversaries, don't hurt other people's feelings,
help the less fortunate. Sensitivity to other's feelings were more
important to her than her own position or comfort or wealth. A person was
nothing if he or she did not in some way recognize and contribute to the
needs of society. She had a point there. After all, a person is not an
animal. Zay a mentsh.

But perhaps the wisest was my grandfather. He would raise his forefinger
and his eyebrows, nodding and say firmly zay a mentsh, by which he meant
many things: read, study, think, question, observe, and defend your
beliefs against all who would destroy them. Be a free human being. He had
a point. He knew that the strength of a person was in his or her
willingness to be different, that conformity was spiritual and
intellectual death. And he had a point there too. After all, a person is
not an animal. Zay a mentsh.
