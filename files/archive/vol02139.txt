Subject: Our busy readers

Further to the "our productive members" thread in November,
the reason I've been so silent on MENDELE for the past few
months is that I've been busy being productive.

David M. Sherman, "Income Tax Research" (Toronto: De Boo,
	1989, 179 pp.)

        Boo/Carswell). 1st edition, July 1991; 2nd edition,

        (4th edition in production)

        the Goods and Services Tax, 6 volumes, updated
        every 2 weeks, 1991-93; Carswell)

        production.

-----, "Quebec Sales Tax Service" (Carswell).  2 volumes,
        looseleaf, updated monthly, 1992-93.

(I won't bore you with the rest.  Nothing in Yiddish unless
you count my article in the current issue of Yugntruf on
raising children in Yiddish.)

By the way, do you know of anything written in Yiddish on
the subject of income tax (presumably U.S.)?

Aside from what's available from the NYBC, if it's seforim
you want, there are lots of options if you go to the right
places -- seforim or Judaica stores, especially on 13th Av.
in Boro Park (Brooklyn).

I have a complete set of the Beys Yehuda, which is a
"Mikraos Gedolos" style chumash (five volumes), plus
another 10 volumes of Nakh (the rest of what you call the
"Old Testament"). Each page of the chumash has the text;
the onkelos (Aramaic); Rashi; the Beys Yehuda, which is the
Rashi repeated and translated into Yiddish after every few
words; Peyresh L'Toyras Avraham, which is a straight
Yiddish translation of the text; three other commentaries
in Hebrew; and one other commentary in Yiddish.

My 8-year-old daughter uses the Beys Yehuda when she's
doing hew chumash homework (at an Orthodox day school, but
one where no Yiddish is spoken -- my kids are the only ones
in the school who are fluent in Yiddish).  If she's having
trouble understanding a word or understanding the Rashi,
the Yiddish is right there to explain it.  I find it a
great help myself, since my Hebrew vocabulary isn't that
extensive.

For a 15-volume set that fills a shelf, it was surprisingly
inexpensive.  Of course, it an uncopyrighted commodity that
many in the Chassidic world buy and use for regular
learning, so the price is for the paper, printing and
binding.  I forget how much I paid for the set, but I think
it was about US$80.

Don't overlook the stores in Boro Park for other Yiddish
materials, including cassettes, children's books and adult
books.  Of course, most (but not all) are religious in
content and orientation.

Subject: Kleyt and -khe

"kleytl" dimin of "kleyt" which is the largely SEY word for
'store' (elsewhere, "krom" and "gevelb").

"-khe": for feminine derivatives largely of masculine
proper names. Thus He is "Leyzer" and his wife is "di
Leyzerukhe"; He is "Ber", his wife is "di Berikhe".

Subject: Sneezes and ... Philologos

Our mysterious friend and fellow mendelnik, Philologos,
cites Mendele, and a number Mendelniks personally, for
their contributions to the subject of what one says after a
sneeze.  As always, an enjoyable article.  See the English
Forward, January 15, 1992, page 11.

Thanks, Philologos, wherever you are!!!
