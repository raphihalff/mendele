Subject: Zamenhof and Yiddish

Mention of Zamenhof reminds me of a bit of comic verse my
father used to enjoy quoting.  If I remember correctly, it goes
like this:

        Hista bokhe le Zamenhofe
        Meyks mi lakhe on a sofe.
        Donerveter!  Sacremento!
        Eto sfoso Esperanto!

I'm sure some of you linguists can help identify the languages
represented in this kashe and botshvene. (I think my dad got it from Der
Groyser Kundes.)

Subject: Translating Yente Serdatsky

Hello, it's me again.  I'm preparing a second paper on translation
issues and early 20th-century American immigrant Yiddish writings, this
one for the AAPY panel at the MLA Conference in Washington, DC, in
December, and I plan to work on one or two short stories by Yente
Serdatsky.

I am considering from among the following, so if anyone is already
working on a translation of one of these, I will refrain and choose
another.  As always, speak now or...

"Es dreyt zikh dos redel"
"Khavertes"
"Di enderung"
"Zeyere liebes-sekretn"
"A simkhe"  (transliterations reflect the original spellings)

And I look forward to seeing you at the MLA.

Ken Wishnia

Subject: Menke Katz, Yiddish poet and vegetarian

It is with pleasure that I answer Pawel Brunon Dorman's search for a
Yiddish poet who was vegetarian, for his question gives me pause, in
this "world that's too much with us", to remember a unique friend whose
love of words, and of life, was most hearty and contagious.

For Menke, I researched a recipe for 'chopped liver' made of green beans
(S'iz take a maykhl) and listened to him read his poems that were
sensitive, spontaneous and lyrical.

To receive a gift of his new book was like a holiday, for with his pen
he "embroidered" little huts (to honor his Lithuanian town, Michalishek)
and curlicued flowers around his inscription which named you, at the
very least, "a lover of all things just and beautiful".

In addition to 18 books of poetry (9 in Yiddish and 9 in English), many
literary awards, editorship of "Bitterroot" Poetry Magazine, he
dedicated himself to freeing poetry of rhyme and creating new forms in
Yiddish and in English.

Menke left a legacy above and beyond the printed page - many students
who loved him in the Ordn and Arbeter Ring Shules, and an illustrious
son, Dovid Katz, who heads the Yiddish program at Oxford University.

Menke's daughter, Troim Handler, who teaches Yiddish, relates that the
night of Menke's death in 1991, she awoke with a completed Yiddish poem
(her first) on her lips, and has been writing poetry ever since. She
lectures and writes of, and is interested in, erotica, making her
Yiddish poetry quite unique.

Always avant garde, Menke has a home page:

Mirl Schonhaut Hirshan
Boynton Beach, Florida

sh. f. - shir fargesn
Roberta Kalechofsky, the publisher of Micah Press in Marblehead, Mass. is a
Jewish (not Yiddish) writer who is vegetarian and has published her book
about it.

Isaac Bashevis Singer was a "notorious" vegetarian comparing our
treatment of chickens with Nazi treatment of Jews in Treblinka.

i know that you will probably receive about ten thousand letters telling
you this, i will respond nonetheless. I.B Singer was a vegetarian yiddish
writer, probably the most famous one of all.

Subject: Theater song

One of the actors of the world touring Travelling Jewish Theater has
written a little lullaby for a work in progress and is soliciting
different translations for the last line. Any suggestions are greatly
appreciated.

Sleep, my shining little one,
Shine your light on me;
I will be here
like a glass
and you will always be seen.

She has witten so far:

Shlof, mayn sheyn likhtik kind,
shayn dayn likht af mir;
ikh shtey bay dir vi a gloz
????????????????????.

a sheynem dank aykh alemen,

Mikhoyel Basherives
