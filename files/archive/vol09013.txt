Subject: Sholem Aleykhem and Charlie Chaplin

As many of you know, towards the end of the second part of Motl Peyse dem
khazns there's a wonderful scene where Motl and his friends and family go to
see a Charlie Chaplin film.  It's a very resonant scene, I think, and I was
wondering about a couple of background matters.  Do any Mendelyaner know
what works of Chaplin's SA knew, or what he thought of them, or more
generally what he thought about American silent films?  (There's a striking
account, in Marie Waife-Goldberg's _My Father Sholom Aleichem_, of SA's
describing how he imagined the stories of Motl should be told on the screen
- "he dictated a scenario of every story of Motel in great detail, as though
he were telling me of an actual movie he had seen. I saw him now in the
great combination of his talents, acting the roles of his characters, as
though he was performing before the lights in the studio, and yet being the
observer of it, enjoying it all immensely.  When he turned his forefinger
into the air to indicate a hand moving over the screen, writing the words
'Elihu, the Inkmaker,' I could see the screen and had the complete illusion
of a movie scene. . . . If a stranger saw us then he would think we were
touched in the head.  Two men sitting and bursting into laughter, like two
kids at a Charlie Chaplin movie" (292).)  Did other Yiddish writers who came
to America leave vivid accounts of what it was like to see Chaplin or other
American film artists? 
        
And finally, though not covered by the subject header - the scene in _Motl_
is marked also by the actions of Big Motl, who is among other things a
ventriloquist (a boykhreder).  Are there other works of SA's that treat this
theme? 
        
Thanks in advance, 

Larry Rosenwald

Sholem aleykhem!

My name is Lori Cahan-Simon.  I teach Jewish culture through the Arts in
Sunday school at the I. L. Peretz shule at the Workmen's Circle in
Cleveland.  My areas are Art, Drama (I write and direct the spiln),
Music, Cooking and whatever else I'm needed to do.  I sing with our
Klezmer Orchestra and am beginning a project to collect and record
children's songs games and rhymes in Yiddish from those who learned them
as children.  My everyday job is as a Middle School Spanish teacher.  I
am from Philadelphia, but live in the Cleveland area now with my husband
and 4-year-old son.

Iberlebn, alevay. But does anyone know where the 2 million figure comes from?

Subject: Lists, word & name

Dear Mendelianer,

Translators from Yiddish to English share some common problems:  What
spelling to use for words not translated? (matses or the better known
matzoth). How far to go giving explanations in footnotes or special word
lists? ('shabbes' the general reader should know, but 'khazn', 'tfile'?).
How to render Yiddish personal names? (Moyshe-Moshe). Do we have to explain
all Jewish holidays again and again?  Are there any ready made lists with
some authority available on the Net that could solve all or some of these
problems? 

Thank you for sharing your information,

Lucas Bruyn.

Subject: Feet and legs

Vulf Plotkin mentions that there is no distinction between "foot" and "leg"
in Yiddish and attributes that to various slavic languages.  But I believe
that Hebrew, also, has no such distinction. 

Milt Koosman says that there is no differentiation in Yiddish between
"finger" and "toe."  I think there is.  I've heard a "toe"  referred to as a
"fusfinger."  This, too, is consistent with Hebrew.

Subject: Founding MENDELE: a correction

In his remarks on the provenance of our members (Vol. 9.001), Iosif
Vaisman writes of the time "When Noyekh Miller and Victor Bers started
Mendele eight years ago..." This is a kovid to which I have no right
whatsoever. Noyekh is the one and only Ur-Shames. My official (and truly
minor) role began some time later when MENDELE was searching for a more
commodious mainframe computer and I agreed to become the "local owner" at
Yale. Now Iosif does the real work and I try to handle requests for help
subscribing, unsubscribing, and postponing.

Subject: Founding MENDELE: a correction 

As long as we're getting into Mendele-history, I have an addition, not a
correction: In the beginning there was mail.yiddish, thanks to David
Sherman. And mail.yiddish begat Mendele.

There is a great irony in WHY Mendele was begat in the first place --
David, your motto must be 'He who laughs last laughs best', right? ;)
