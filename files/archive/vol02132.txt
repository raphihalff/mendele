Subject: reflexives

Many thanks for your responses concerning my question
involving "Dem Milners Trern."  I was, indeed, guilty of a
misunderstanding of the lyrics when I heard "Juden" instead
of "Yurn." I have a real problem with lyrics in any
language.

At any rate, the question of reflexives becomes even more
interesting.  Of such things are dissertations born, I
suppose.

Subject: Reyzele dreyt zikh

Khaver Khaim Bochner, in connection with a discussion on
reflexives, quotes a line from the song Reyzele as "Gey
zikh nokh a por mol iber" --but the way I remember it
fromthe record is "DREY zikh nor (nokh?) a por mol iber,
bald vel ikh zayn fray..."

Subject:Reflexives/Yiddish goats/Ukrainian goats

    The examples discussed by Messrs. Lantz, Finkel,
Axelrod and Bochner (Mendele 130-31) warm the heart of a
Slavist since the Yiddish _zikh_, like the corresponding
element in the Slavic languages, has a multitude of
functions, only one of which is the etymological, reflexive
(object = subject) one (hence the quotation marks in my
title).

    1) In "di reder dreyen zikh" the otherwise transitive
_dreyen_ is made intransitive and a possible object
("someone or something turns the wheels") becomes the
subject.

    2) In "di yorn geyen zikh" the "reflexive" element is
really dative and the line is parallel to a different line
from "Reyzele" than the one quoted by Khaim Bochner,
namely, "gey ikh mir a freylikher."  In both examples the
dative (like Polish _sobie_ or Russian _sebe_) adds the
meaning of casualness, of doing something for oneself
without any attention or interest in what is going on
around one.  In a song by the Russian bard Bulat Okudzhava
a solider says, "Idu sebe, igraiu avtomatom"--"I just walk
along playing with my machine gun."

    3) When Reyzele tells Dovidl "Gey zikh nokh a por mol
iber," she's using a "reflexive" verb _zikh ibergeyn_ 'take
a stroll', which is not in Weinreich or Harkavy, but is in
the _Groyser ver- terbukh_, and which is probably a calque
from Polish _przejsc sie_ [diacritics missing] or Russian
_proitis'_.

    4) "Se davnt zikh nit" is also a Slavic-like
construction.  I would expect that you could add a dative,
e.g., "Mir davnt zikh nit."  Here the "reflexive" element
serves to present the action as happening (or rather not
happening) independently of the subject, which can only be
expressed as someone experiencing (but not causing) the
action:  it's not that I'm intentionally not praying, but
that the not-praying is happening to me.

    5) One of the classic examples of Slavic influence on
Yiddish is the replacement of separate reflexive pronouns
for first, second and third person (as in Germanic and
Romance) by a single reflexive pronoun:  cf. French je me
lave, tu te laves, il/elle se lave; German ich wasche mich,
du waschest dich, er/sie wascht sich vs. Yiddish ikh vash
zikh, du vashst zikh, er/zi vasht zikh like Polish myje
sie, myjesz sie, myje sie. The original text of Zalman
Shneour's "Margaritkelekh" (1909) shows the older Yiddish
construction in the verse where the boy asks the girl if
she's bashful/embarrassed: --Du libst mikh?  --Ikh lib
dikh! --Du shemst DIKH? --Ikh shem MIKH! --O lib mikh un
shem DIKH un shvayg... Most modern editions have --Du
shemst ZIKH?  --Ikh shem ZIKH! --O lib mikh un shem ZIKH un
shvayg... [emphasis added].


[More about Yiddish goats]

    In Mendele 110 Seymour Axelrod asked about Bernstein
#362: "Oyf a yungn boym shpringen ale tsign" and Yitzhak
Kertesz later suggested that the proverb may really be
about "gentlemen, who also prefer to jump on the 'yunge
boymelakh.'"  He may well be right, but since proverbs
rarely have only one reading, let me propose another, based
on international parallels.   Polish has a proverb
(attested as early as 1527) that states that even goats
climb or jump onto a tree that is leaning:  "Na pochyle
drzewo kozy laza" (or:  "Na pochyle drzewo i kozy skacza").
There are also parallels in Russian and Ukrainian.  The
1527 attestation is from a collection of Polish proverbs
with Latin parallels, and the Latin version for this one
is:  "Arbore dejecta quis ligna non colligit." (With my
minimal Latin I make of this:  "Who does not collect the
wood of a fallen tree?").  The Oxford Dictionary of English
Proverbs cites (2nd ed., p. 837):  "When the tree is
fallen, every one runs to it with his axe (hatchet)," with
parallels from classical Greek (Menander) and a variant of
the Latin proverb just cited.  In the Kosciuszko Foundation
Polish- English dictionary the Polish proverb cited above
is translated 'people will walk all over you if you let
them.'

    Of course leaning trees are not young trees, but the
Ukrainian variants do include versions with low, crooked
and small trees as well as leaning ones.  Now what we
really need is to find someone who actually uses the
proverb or remembers hearing it used.


[More about Ukrainian goats]

    Reb Noyekh and Elliot Gertel (120-21) recall a
mixed-language story about a Jew and a goat:

      Panyuh maruhvoy, duh mansuh iz uhzoy:
      Yah mahyu shookhn Heyrsh Beyruhluh
      Tu vihn mayoot para izim.
      Tu shtikhum krikhum nah mayu dakh.
      Yah yeymu skazaluhm tu vihn shelakh.

I was stumped by the _maruhvoy_, but finally realized that
this is the Russian _mirovoi_ 'justice of the peace'.  So
the Slavic component of the text is a somewhat less than
grammatical mixture of (mostly) Ukrainian, Russian and
Polish:  _panie mirovoi_ 'Mr. Judge', _ia maiu_ 'I have',
_ta vin maie_ 'and he has', _na moiu dakh_ 'onto my roof'
[incorrect feminine accusative _moiu_ for masculine _mii_],
_ia iemu skazal ta vin_ 'I told him and he' [with what
seems to be the Polish 1st person singular ending (_-em_)
on the past tense form of the Russian verb _skazal_
'said'].

Subject: Reflexives

1. You misheard some of the words. It is "di yurn geyen
zich" `the years go by' 2. The zich is not exactly
`themselves'. It is the Dative reflexive, sometimes called
`ethic dative' or `sympathetic dative', of the kind you
find in : gey ich mir shpatsirn.
