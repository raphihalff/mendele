Subject: Yiddish in the European Educational Network Encyclopaedia

Dear Mendelyaner,

I will appreciate your help with the following matter.  I have succeeded in
including Israel in the EUN (European Schoolnet)  network. It connects all
of the national educational networks of the European Union countries.  One
of the new project of the EUN is the European Encyclopaedia. It is a
multilanguage project in which schools, colleges, universities and other
educaitonal institutions adopt a Word and develop it in its language using
Web based tools. The Word can be defined using texts, graphics, video clips,
sounds and the like. 

I have insisted that Yiddish is the truly European Jewish language and
should be represented among the languages supported by the Encyclopaedia. 
I am doing the translation of the 4 HTML pages and the Word (one and half
page) requested by the EUN organizers of the project. I would appreciate
very much if you could find somebody to provide the Yiddish translation. I
will be able to put it in graphics if you are able to send me the translated
pages in an RTF document. The only way to garantee that everybody, with or
without support for Yiddish/Hebrew characters be able to read it is to
publish it as graphics.

The deadline is tight but I received the materials only in the beginning of
this week.

Best regards,

Dov Winer

Subject: _man_ the guns!

Wow! What a furor. And what an exhaustive list that Mordkhe Schaechter
provides. The point about such lists, however, is that much as they
represent the considerable efforts of the dictionary maker, such lists never
repesent the lexical inventory of a normal speaker. As the response to my
assertion demonstrate, there must be some individual variation in the
matter. 

Concerning the matter of Yiddish _man_ and _mentsh_ and English 'man' and
'husband', It would be instructive to examine the data that he and I, among
others, collected from hundreds of native Yiddish speakers, in the US,
Canada, Mexico. You can be sure that _man_ 'man' is largely a US-Canada
phenomenon. Being a native English speaker myself, you can imagine my own
surprise in interviewing dozens of speakers in Israel, to discover that the
translation of Hebrew _ha-ish im hayayin_ was (universally?) _der mentsh
mitn vayn_ (/_vaan_/_van_). Of course, the point of the question (designed
in America) was to elicit the conrast between long /aa/ and short /a/ (der
man mitn vaan) in Poland, and between /a/ and /o/ (der mon mitn van) in the
Southern Ukraine. IT JUST DIDN'T OFTEN WORK

_man un vayb_/_froy_ 'husband and wife'
_manen_ 'husbands'
_mener un froyen_ 'men & women'

_mentsh_  is, of course, human being--perhaps for all speaker. For some, 
as I've noted, it means _man_ And,  _dos mentsh_ is female.

Subject: man - mentch

Having read the various inputs, I believe the examples of 'man' as man (as
opposed to 'husband') are exemplary, and I recognize them all (I just didn't
think of them!). 

It appears to me that 'man' can be EITHER 'man' OR 'husband,' depending on
the context (Feigel Glaser's point, although I am more taken by Norman
Buder's examples than what it says in a dictionary). 

'Mentch' (or 'mensch') can certainly be 'man,' but I cannot bring to mind an
instance where it COULD BE husband. 

Regards
Jack Berger

Subject: man - mentsh

I cannot believe the dispute over the matter of man and mentsh.  Yiddish
is fortunate, unlike English or French, but in company with Latin and
German, to have a word for human being which is not specifically
masculine(homo and Mentsch as compared with vir and Mann).  This is
exemplified in the concept of mentshlikhkayt (Mentschlichkeit in
German), which tranlates as humanity, not masculinity.  Of course, like
the German from which it comes, man also means husband, as froy means both
woman and wife.  (Interestingly, in German, Frau means woman or wife, but
the more common word for woman is Weib, which does not mean wife.)  I
thought EVERYBODY knew this.

Subject: lodzer dialekt

In response to Mikhl Herzog:

According to my knowledge, people in Lodz said:  di (or de)  piter (puter)
and in dative mit der (or de) piter (puter). Yes, yes, puter or piter are
vayblekher min (feminine)  I cannot answer for everyone in Lodz, because
Lodz was a young city, and many inhabitants came from different provinces
and many people from the surrounding provinces are claiming that they are
from Lodz. My grandparents were also NOT natives of Lodz; they came from
Piontke (Piatek), Dzhaloshits (Dzialoszyce) and Pintshev (Pinczow). I do not
find in any decent dictionary that puter (or piter) is of neuter gender
(zakhlekher min). 

Di poshete, nit-kulturele aynvoyner in Lodz, hobn aropgeshlungen di reysh
(R) baym sof fun vort.  Zey hobn gezogt aanvoyne (nit aynvoyner), mese (nit
meser), tele (nit teler), pite (nit piter oder puter), de (nit der), un azoy
vayter.  Bimeyle hobn zey aroysgeredt "mit de pite arup"  (nit mit der
puter/piter arop/arup). Khotsh es iz shver, darf men kenen untersheydn
tsvishn "DE" (di) un "DE" (der). Oyf dem darf men nit geyn lernen in di
universitetn; a Lodzer veyst shoyn! 

Nokhamol, beste grusn,

Subject: hurrah for Yiddish

It gives me greatr pleasure to hear of Yiddish music  festivals,
and exchanges of individuals onthe Yiddish language, but I am saddened
that so many of these happen outside of Israel.  I want Yiddish music and
the Yiddish language to thrive but even more so I want the people who
make  Yiddish music and talk and write in Yiddish  to be in Israel.  I
want to hear that Jews are in Israel  are making music and using Yiddish.
 
Although I was born and raised in America I am wretched thinking of the
horrors that Jews lived through in Europe.  That Jews are building Jewish
communities in Europe gives me mixed feelings.  That they are alive and well
delights me , that they are not planning to leave Europe for Israel
perplexes me.  My heart dreams of Israel while I can live in an America that
has been good to Jews. 
                           
Shalom

Subject: 1000 years Yiddish

Many communities are getting ready to celebrate one thousand years of
Yiddish.  Can somone inform me if there is actually a date or an event or
series of developments on which we base the beginning of Yiddish one
thousand years ago.

Subject: "Muter Rucjel"

Has anyone heard of a song called "Muter Rucjel" or "Keyver Ruchel".  The
woman who asked me learned this song in third or fourth grade when she was a
student at the Bais Yaakov in Williamsburgh, Brooklyn, which was in those
days a trilingual school.  The melody is quite haunting, sad and dirge-like. 
The words she remembers are: 

Tvishen Khevron un Bais-Lekhem
ligt a keyver in der midbar
dortn ligt die muter Ruchel
in der midbar gans aleyn
dorten ligt die muter Ruchel
in der midbar gans aleyn.

Refrain:
Muter Ruchel, muter Ruchel
dayne kinder vaynen zeyer

I'd appreciate any help with this.
A hartstign Dank
