Subject: Khushim ben Dan

Reb Noyekh wrote recently on the obscurity of Khushim ben Dan and his
deafness.  He found a reference to Khushim in Breishis, but says "Rashi
has nothing to say".

Rashi says nothing on the spot.  But elsewhere, Rashi _does_ make two
terse references to that g'more in Soyte--once near the end of Toyldos
(27.45), and once in the middle of Vay'khi (49.21).  In neither place
does he mention Khushim by name--but he doesn't say much else either.
Standard practice, when learning or teaching either Rashi, is to go over
the mayse from the g'more;  if you don't know the rest of the mayse, the
Rashi is meaningless.  So Khushim's deafness is widely known among those
who learn khumesh with Rashi.  My own immediate reaction to just the
*title* of Reb Noyekh's post was "it's about Khushim, it probably has
something to do with deafness"--and I've never learned m'sekhte Soyte.
(I did a small informal survey, just to make sure--asked three people
"What do you know about Khushim ben Don?";  two immediately responded "he
was deaf."  The third said she felt very sheepish, she had learned the
story, and that Khushim was deaf, but she didn't remember it when I
mentioned his name.)

I agree with Reb Noyekh that a theatre-going audience would not be
expected to know details of an agad'te in Soyte.  But would it be
unreasonable to expect them to know something which came up regularly in
the course of the usual khumesh instruction, in droshes, and in shul
small-talk?  Granted that not everyone in the shtetl was "steeped in
learning", how many of them didn't know khumeshrashe, even if only
through the Bays Yide?

Nokh mer, Khushim isn't a character in the Talmud itself;  he's a
character in an agad'te, a story quoted in the Talmud.  Agad'te was later
collected separately in the Eyn Yankev, and widely learned and read by
poshete yidn who weren't on the level to learn the legalistic stuff.  The
agad'te became known widely, and many of them remained a part of Jewish
folklore, even by people who no longer had any connection to learning.
Maybe the story of Khushim ben Don losing his temper and socking one to
Eisov was one of the ones that "made it"?

The g'more in Soyte says about Khushim that "his ears were heavy to him;"
Reb Noyekh took this to mean that he was hard of hearing, and I think
he's right.  But I've always known Khushim as "deaf";  I didn't notice
otherwise until I checked the g'more for myself last night.  I have a
hunch that most people who know the story know Khushim as deaf, not as
hard-of-hearing;  if so, this may be a difference between the poppular
version and the g'more's.  Which meaning is being referred to in the
play? I can't tell.  If it's clearly deafness, then maybe that indicates
that the allusion is to the popular version, and not the g'more's.

Regarding khushim's status as a word, it doesn't surprise me that it
didn't quite make it into all the dictionaries--my intuition is that
"khushim" in Yiddish is not an independent word, but a comparison to an
historical figure with a particular attribute.  Sort of like the way in
American English, to call someone a Benedict Arnold is to call them a
traitor, but "Benedict Arnold" doesn't mean "traitor"--he's an historical
character, whose most notable trait is his being traitor, and the
comparison is being made to highlight that trait.  (The missing vov is
not a misspelling, nor is it a mystery;  most words spelled khoser in
T'nakh are moley in Shas and subsequently--khoser/moley is arbitrary, and
moley makes life easier;  Yankev sometimes gets a vov too.  And given the
vagaries of copyists, even if it were wrong, it couldn't be blamed on
'the sages'.)

To follow Reb Noyekh's tangent a bit, the entire story in the g'more has
no concrete basis in the psukim.  The association between Khushim's name
and deafness via "senses" is possible, but in the context of a story
which must be either a received tradition (m'soyre) or speculation, I'd
prefer to say that the source for Khushim's deafness is the same as the
source for the story.

As for an association between Khushim and foolishness, bear in mind that
in Shas, a deaf-mute (kheresh) is assumed to be incapable, a non-adult,
along with a shoyte and a koton.  [Maybe the only type of deafness they
knew was connected to some sort of mental deficiency (I believe there are
some types of deafness which are like that), or maybe the social
structure did not provide a way for deaf-mutes to develop normally;  if
anyone wants to look into it, I know R. J.D. Bleich has written
extensively on this issue.]  And the story portrays Khushim as a
simpleton:  Eisov was arguing with Yankev's sons, and he didn't
understand what was going on, so he asked his uncles, and only then got
upset that his grandfather's funeral was being held up.  So the
foolishness may be an association with the deafness, or the deafness an
association with the foolishness;  we do not need to resort to the
confusion with "khusham".

Subject: Khushim, also toyber lokhman!

Although I have never heard the expression:'khushim ben dan'(assuming the
Hebrew), I _have_ heard my parents, o.h.s., say: " Er iz a toyber
lokhman", vos meynt take az er iz nisht nor toyb, ober er hert amul ven
er vil! (in a derogatory sense)
