Subject: Searching for an-sky

I am in Kyoto, Japan for this year as a visiting professor of history
and I have indirectly begun to make the acquaintance of a Japanese
professor here who has thus far unsuccessfully been trying to track down
a copy of the text of Sh. An-sky's famous play, _der dibek_.  He has a
copy of the classic film and wanted to get a copy of the text.  If
anyone out there has the text and they'd be willing to make a copy of,
we'd be more than happy to reimburse you for copying and mailing.
Please respond to me at: fogel@humanitas.ucsb.edu

My mail is being forwarded from my home university.  Many thanks.

Subject: Anti-Yiddish sentiment in Israel

Unfortunately I  am not  a great  "meyven fun yidish",  but I  love the
language within my limitations, and follow Mendele with much pleasure.
Still I was really shocked to see to what extend "love" of Yiddish can
bring some people as I read  in Mendele Vol. 6.035 what Sylvia Schildt
wrote in connection with the status of Yiddish in Israel.

I  do not  think that  she was  quite correct  with: "hitler  un zayne
antisemitishe mithelfer hobn gevolt  farnikhtn dos yidishe folk bkhlal
-- un  yidish bfrat".  I  do not think  that Hitler yimakh  shemoy was
concerned with killing  Yiddish, he wanted to kill  all Jews, whatever
language  they spoke.   But  this is  a  minor point  and  I can  even
understand, and *almost* accept her "mir torn im nit opgebn a nitzokhn
nokhn krig. ven men shtitzt mame  loshn shpayt men di sonim in ponem".

But I wish to protest strongly against wild comparisons like her: "ven
men harget yidish (azoy vi es tut der burg) iz men a shutef mit di ale
natzis un andere antisemitn vos  hobn im azoy frayvilik aroysgrholfn". I
know that sometimes Yiddish  publicists like exaggerations to make a
point, but I consider it fairly  disgusting to compare "der burg" with
"ale natzis" by  being their shutef.  I can well  understand that some
people are very  upset about what they consider some  actions of Avrum
Burg, but  I always thought  that one  should remember that  yiden are
yiden and natzis are natzis.  Never forget that!

Subject: Unwed mothers

Could anybody on Mendele tell me about the situation of the jewish unwed
mother in Galicia at the end of the last century. Prof.Fuks told me that
they were no longer accepted by their family. Therefore they often had
to live in great poverty in another shtetl.

Are there any studies on their situation?

Are there yiddish writers who treated this theme in their novels or
poems? Salamon Dembitzer wrote in short stories on the life of his
mother, who was unwed, however without saying explicitely that she was.

Subject: Akeda in Yiddish literature

Daniel Soyer should check the introduction to the Penguin Anthology of
Yiddish Verse (bilingual), eds. Irving Howe, Eleazar Greenberg and Khone
Shmeruk.  If I remember correctly, the writer in question was H.
Leivick, who later included a wonderful discussion between Job and Isaac
(and the ram!) in his verse play "in di teg fun iov" (1953).

If anyone knows of other Yiddish akeda writings (poems, stories,
commentaries, etc.) I would be very grateful to hear about them.  I have
Manger's akeda poems from the "khumesh lider" but am most interested in
anything else anyone may know of.
