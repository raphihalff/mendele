Subject: Sutzkevers lid

Avrom Sutzkever's long poem on the death of his mother, "Mayn 
mame," is dated "Vilner geto, oktober 1942."  It can be found in
the first volume of his _Poetishe verk_ (Tel-Aviv, 1963), pp. 
265-69.  The eighth and last section of the poem, the second half
of which Miriam Schonhaut Hirsham quoted in translation (7.063),
reads in the original as follows:

        Redstu tsu mir
        azoy vorhaftik ekht:
        --Nite, mayn kind,
        s'iz a zind, s'iz a zind,
        un undzer tseteylung
        nem on far gerekht.

        Az du bist faran,
        bin ikh do say-vi-say,
        vi der yoder in floym
        farmogt shoyn dem boym
        un di nest un dem foygl
        un alts vos derbay.

Subject: fisnoge

A contributor to the Oxford Food Companion, R. Harris, inquires about
_fisnoge_, a "peculiar term consisting of the word 'foot' in two languages"
(7.066).  It is unclear to me whether he seeks a recipe or an explanation
for the curious repetition in two languages.  Both topics have been
discussed on Mendele within the year by Mikhl Herzog (Vol. 6.133), Elye
Kats (Vols. 6.139, 6.141), Khane Faygl Turtletaub (Vol. 6.148), Fishl
Kutner (Vol. 7.067), and Stephen Berr (Vol. 7.067).  Mr. Harris needs to
know that Mendele's website <http://www2.trincoll.edu/~mendele> provides
information on accessing the archives, and though I am no maven on either
the culinary or the linguistic, I think a systematic summary of the
information would be helpful.  For his benefit, I will point out I am
romanizing Yiddish words using the Standard YIVO Orthography.  Though one
does encounter other systems, such as that of the Library of Congress, the
YIVO system is now used by nearly all scholars in the field of Yiddish
studies.

_Fisnoge_, or jellied calve's feet, is a cold appetizer.  In his post on
Vol. 7.067, Stephen Berr offers to make his recipe available.  The dish is
also called _p'tcha_ in Russian (another romanization discussion could take
place here); and _kalte fis_ (cold feet) among Yiddish speakers in Poland.

The word _fisnoge_ occurs only in so-called Lithuanian Yiddish, or Litvish,
which was spoken in the Baltic lands, the present Belarus, and the extreme
northeast of Poland.  The Litvish speaker would characteristically
pronounce the sounds /s/ and /sh/ in the same way, as /s/.  Thus the word
_fish_ (fish) would be pronounced /fis/, becoming a homonym with  _fis_
(feet).  To distinguish between the two, the Litvish speaker attached a
second Slavic component, _noge_, also meaning feet.  (I am not sure if this
is Russian, or Polish, or both.)  Correspondingly, both _fisribe_ (using
the Slavic _ribe_) and _fisdogim_ (using the Hebrew _dogim_) mean fish.

I hope that is of help; I hope I have not omitted the names of any relevant
contributors; and I trust that our respective experts will rush to correct
any factual errors I may have introduced in my effort to summarize their
correspondence.

Subject: zog es mir 

tayere, mendele, Alexander Maxwell hob gebet die verter for a song by the
Andrews sisters. I wonder if it is a take off on the Yiddish song below:

chorus: 
Zog, zog, zog es mir, ich vil es heren shoin fun dir
Di kleine sheine verte fir
un an entfer mir shneler gib.
Zog, Zog, Zog es gich, 
oy zog un zai mechaye mich
Nu zog vos ken es harn dich
Zog shoin zog : ICh hob dich lib!

Verse:
Mit dir is lichtik a gan eidn
On dir main lebn iz shvartz.
Un vet men unz cholile sheidn
Raist men arois main hartz.
  
Chorus: 
Zog, Zog Zog es mir,
Ich vil es hern shoin fun dir
Di Kleine sheine verter fir
Zog shoin zog " Ich hob dich lieb".

Di verte und di muzik zaynin in "Popular Jewish Songs simplified" put out by
Metro Music COmpany.54 Second AVe. New York, NY 10003. This collection also
has wonderful oldies such as Shayn vi di levone and the lilting tango "Ich
hob dir tsufil lib" all arranged by William Scher with words and chords. If
you cannot find the music,i am willing to sing this on the telephone and you
can tape it!.  vos far a mechaye..!  

Zai alles gezunt und a gute neye yor tsu alle mendelyaners!..

Subject: Frage

Tayere Mendelyaner,
A quick frage: does anyone know the publication date of Morris Rosenfeld's
"Mayn Rue Plats". I've seen it alternately as 1887 and 1894. I'll bet it's
neither. 

And while I'm at it, lomir aykh ale vintshn a zisn, gezintn un mazldikn naye
yor. A gite yor!

Subject: question
     
I work at Macro International Inc. and put out an employee-education German
contest each week.  I want to make an allusion with a word I remember from
the comic strip called Katzenjammer Kids.
     
The word is ferschluggene(r).  A few people here at my company say that they
understand the word to mean slob, sloppy, absent minded, poor slob, not well
put together.  None are 100 percent sure of the spelling.  (Are endings in
Yiddish the same as for German, e.g., -e when describing a nominative fem.
word?)
     
I appreciate any help you can give me.
     
Linda Egan

Subject: Sutzkever's Poem: "Mother"

In response to Marjorie (Mirl) Schonhaut Hirshan and Louis Fridhandler's
requests for the Yiddish original of last stanza of Sutzkever's poem "Mother"
which appeared in English translation in _Burnt Perls_:  The poem is from his
volume of poetry, _Di Festung_, New York, 1945, pp. 33-37, and reprinted in
his _Poetishe Verk_, band ayns, Tel Aviv, 1963, pp. 265-269. The poem is
called "Mayn Mame" and was written in the Vilna ghetto in October, 1942. The
last verse reads in Yiddish (my transcription): 

az du bist faran,
bin ikh do say-vi-say,
vi der yoder in floym
farmogt shoyn dem boym
un di nest un dem foygl
un alts vos derbay.

If anyone wants more of this beautiful poem, please let me know,

A gut, gezunt, un freylekh yor an ale mendelyaner
Lisa Duhl
