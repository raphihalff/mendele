Subject: Introduction

ikh heys Estelle Souche, un ikh voyn in France. ikh bin a matematike
talmide in Lyon, un ikh lern yidish oykh (mayn melamed is oykh a
talmid, zayn tate is a yidish lerer vos arbet in dem medem-bibliotek
in Pariz).

My name is Estelle Souche, and I'm a 22 years old mathematics student
in Lyon (France). I started learning Yiddish in january, thanks to a
schoolmate who speaks Yiddish fluently (his father is a Yiddish
teacher in Paris, and works at the Medem library) and who had the
excellent idea to create a class. Di talmidim are not numerous (only 4
now), but are enthusiastic! And I'm also enthusiastic about the high
quality of this list... Perhaps I should also precise that my mother
tongue is French.

A sheynem dank to Larry Rosenwald thanks to whom I discovered Mendele.

Zayt gezunt un shtark,

Estelle Souche

Subject: A yidishe had gadya

This must be done quickly - before my wife wonders why the steady flow
of boxes from the basement has been interrupted. I didn't manage to do
this the last couple of years and vowed (bli neder) to post before
peysekh this year.

Growing up, the custom at our sdarim was not to end with "Had Gadya,"
but to add a yiddish version, called "Shikt der haar.." My father
learned it at his parents' table in Warsaw. I'm curious to know if
it's known by any other Mendelyaner.

One tries to sing it faster and faster; once my sister and I reached
proficiency, my father's greatest enjoyment was to purposely mix up
the lines as he sang, to keep us from finishing smoothly. (From time
to time we also tried to examine the underlying theology...)

Subject: Stempenyu in English

In answer to the query by Jana Branch [6,288:6] concerning
translations of "Stempenyu", I can report that one of the earliest
translations into English from the works of Sholem Aleykhem was
precisely "Stempenyu" published in London in 1913. Unfortunately, I
have never seen a copy and don't know who the translator was. Some
time in the 1920s a translation was done by Samuel Meisels, published
(together with some other stories) by the Benjamin Harz Verlag in
Berlin/ Vienna (in the Ostjuedische Bibliothek series), n.d. This
version is much too free and cannot be recommended. On the other hand,
a post-war German translation, "Stempenju, ein juedischer Roman",
translated with afterword by Hubert Witt (and with 12 lithographies by
Anatoli Kaplan) was published in Leipzig by Reclam in 1993 [ISBN:
3-379-01482-6] and is very good and definitely still in print. Then,
best of all, we have the version by our esteemed fellow mendelyaner,
Joachim Neugroschel, 'Stempeniu, A Jewish Romance' on pages 287-375 of
his marvellous collection, "The Shtetl, A Creative Anthology of Jewish
Life in Eastern Europe", NY: Richard Marek, 1979. Whether Joachim's
version is still in print I don't know. Perhaps he can tell us.

Subject: Stempenyu in English

Stempenyu is available in English translation by Joachim Neugroschel
in Volume II of The Three Great Writers of Modern Yiddish Literature
-- Sholem-Aleykhem by Zuckerman and Herbst published by Joseph Simon.
It is available from Jack Roth, telephone # (310) 305 1229  -- FAX #
(310)306 6219. I believe it is also available from the Workmen's
Circle Bookstore and the National Yiddish Book Center.

Subject: Stempenyu in English

Jana Branch (in _Mendele_ 6.288 (6)) asks about English translations
of Sholem Aleykhem's _Stempenyu_.  As indicated in Uriel Weinreich's
still very useful SA bibliography in _The Field of Yiddish_ 1 (1954),
p. 287, Hannah Berman is credited with the "Authorized Version" of
_Stempenyu_, London:  Methuen, 1913.  This translation is --
deservedly -- out of print.  SA and his family sweat blood for years
because of that "authorized translation" seal, which Berman squeezed
out of SA.  There is a painful correspondence on the subject at Bet
Shalom Aleychem (Beys Sholem Aleykhem) in Tel Aviv.  There must be
later and more competent translations of this short novella, as well
as mss. of dramatized versions.

Subject: Ignats Bernshteyns _Erotica and Rustica_

Just wanted to point out that a special edition of the 200-plus
"erotica and rustica" Yiddish folksayings  in a "privat oysgabe" by
Ignaz Bernstein was published by Perivale Press, edited by Gershon
Weltman and me (Marvin Zuckerman) about 20 years ago.  It contains a
photographically reproduced copy of all the sayings in the original
Yiddish Bernstein edition, including Bernstein's comments; a
transliteration (YIVO-style) of each saying; and a translation of each
saying.  It is called "Yiddish Sayings Moma Never Taught You." It also
has an  introduction.  It is, unfortunately, out of print, but copies
may be found in libraries or elsewhere, perhaps, since about 5000
copies  were printed in three printings.

Subject: Feldafing

I wonder if I could draw on the collective geographical knowledge of
Mendele for help with a place-name reference in a short story I am
translating from Yiddish. The author refers to a displaced persons
camp that was located after the war at Feldafing. Feldafing is
supposedly the name of a small town in Germany near Munich. I need to
know the name of the lake on which this camp was located.  If anyone
knows, please contact me privately. I have looked everywhere, and
asked several holocaust survivors, and no one seems to know.

With thanks,
Goldie Morgentaler
