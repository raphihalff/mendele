Subject: "Dear Schmucko..."

As a respectable media outlet with the headquarters in the United States,
Mendele cannot stay away from the burning issues of the day. At the same time
Mendele is not a tabloid, so in covering this topic we will strictly limit
ourselves to the Yiddish linguistics aspect of the story.

Here is the story: young public relations specialist M. allegedly addressed her
co-worker (and possibly friend) B. in a private letter as "Dear Schmucko" (*).
Now, "Schmucko" is not our hero's real name, it is made up using the
anglicized form of Yiddish root _shmok_ and an endearment suffix -o. And here
we cannont fail to see a felonious perjury against Yiddish grammar: there is
no such suffix in Yiddish! It should have been -ele, or -chik, or even -enyu,
but not -o (**). We hope that Mendele subscribers will join other concerned
citizens in expressing their desire for better ways of exchanging greetings
between consenting adults. We also suggest that every honest Mendelist, who
has in her or his posession tapes with the recorded samples of Yiddish suffix
usage, voluntarily submit those tapes to the special investigators for this
case. 

(*) "Dear Schmucko, thank you for being, as my little nephew said, it was
great to meet the principal of the United States." -- Michael Isikoff, Diary
of a Scandal, Newsweek, January 26, 1998 (http://www.newsweek.com/ or
http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/digest/daily/jan98/21/newsweek.htm)

(**) -o sounds more like an Italian (tuleyne) suffix, which suggests a
possibility of a certain Brooklyn-originated serious conspiracy.

Subject: Fisnoge, petcha, petse

Az me redt fun esnvarg arum a moltsayt iz avade zeyer an ongeleygter inyen.
Iosif Vaisman git tsu a por verter fun Russell Harris (7.137, 7) vegn fisnoge
oder "petcha" vos klingt enlekh tsu petse.  Dos vort _fisnoge_ hob ikh keynmol
nisht gehert fun mayne eltern, un oykh nisht fun feters oder mumes.  Ikh
gedenk dos vort petse.  (Accent on the second syllable, first e is the schwa,
second e retains the full value of ayen.)  Der tam fun petse gedenk ikh nisht.
Mistome hob ikh nit gegesn keyn petse (jellied calves' feet).  In mayn zikorn

Az dos vort, petse, shtamt fun terkish iz avade interesant un, far mir,
umgerikht.  Efsher iz dos a yerushe fun amolike tsaytn ven der terkisher
imperie hot geveltikt iber di balkanishe lender un ibern shvartsn yam.  Ikh
shtam fun Kishinev. 

[English translation]
Talk of food around mealtime is a welcome topic.  Iosif Vaisman contributes a
few words from Russell Harris (7.137, 7) about fisnoge or petcha which sounds
similar to petse.  I never heard the word fisnoge from parents or uncles or
aunts.  I remember the word petse (Accent on the second syllable, first e is
the schwa, second e retains the full value of ayen.)  I don't remember the
taste of petse.  Probably, I did not eat petse (jellied calves' feet).  I have
a picture in my mind: a cold jelly that looked rather strange.

That the word petse comes from Turkish is quite interesting and, for me,
unexpected.  Perhaps it's a legacy from those times when the Ottoman Empire
ruled over Balkan lands and the Black Sea.  I come from Kishinev.

Subject: Check UYIP Re: Yiddish Computer Program

In answer to Feygl Infeld Glaser's request for a Yiddish capable word
processor, which I think of as an issue for many people on Mendele: as
moderator for the UYIP (Understanding Yiddish Information Processing) 
discussion list, I am maintaining a web page with various Yiddish computer
information.  At the top of the page, I list the various browsers and word
processors that can handle Yiddish.  Please visit for the facts: 

http://world.std.com/~yv/

(Or e-mail me if you can't access this and want it sent to you.)

Several firms are revising products and/or developing new products. 
Occasionally, some products go off the market.  Checking this page from time
to time should help you stay on track.  Of course, I'd appreciate any
information others have, and I welcome new members to join the list to discuss
and/or hear about all the technical developments.  The web page has
information on subscribing.

Es meynt azoy:_ mekayim_ - to come to pass; _pask_ - a judgement.  In other
words: to pass judgement (on) - a warning - a 'day of judgement' for a person.
The 'pask' terrified me!!

Subject: sweater, sveter, shpenser

Thanks Joachim for clearing up a long standing confusion for me. My father
(Apt and Varshe) has always used the word shpenser for sweater (explaining
that Spenser was a British firm that imported sweaters to Poland), and Harkavi
defines shpenser as jacket. Probably the German use of sweater for knitted
jacket helps explain the cross over.

Subject: bagel lore

I am a recent lister and hope that this post is appopriate. It involves the
history of the bagel. It started on a trip to Beijing where I came in contact
with a people called Urghur (Ouighour), a Turkic Muslim people, origin in NW
China Xinjiang province. They have a bread remarkably like the bagel, same
consistency but with a depression rather than a hole and often covered with
sesame seeds. I subsequently visted bakers in the area. Gerdas, as this
bagel-like bread is called are made in ovens reaching about three feet into
the ground-- the ovens made of reed, salt, water and clay. The gerdas are
place in circular patterns around the walls of the oven. Wood or coals are
placed at the bottom and doused with water through the baking so that the
gerdas are baked in steam. I also discovered there is a bagel-like bread
called a Guangbing in Fukien province, China. 
        
There are interesting questions: There were many contacts between East
European Jews and Xingiang province through the Silk Route; the only article I
know of links the bagel to the history of the pretzel, which is also boiled;
there are linguistic links in the work for oven, tonar, which turn up in
variations in various languages, for example, Tandoori, and similar ovens are
found thoughout the region. On the other hand, there are no examples, as far
as I know, of bagel-like breads between Xingiang and Eastern Europe. Such
"drop-offs" could be expected if there were a connection. 

I am in the process of collecting papers on the subject and would appreciate
any speculations, thoughts, stories, myths. The prime myth involves variations
on the "invention" of the bagel by a Jewish Viennese baker as a thanks for
Prince Sobieski's saving of Vienna from the Turks.

Subject: /id/ for Yid

No one seems to have answered this question.  I am not especially
knowledgeable about the dialects in question, but yes the spelling and
pronunciation without 'y' are features of some eastern European Yd dialects
a   ave nothing special to do with the words for 'Jew(ish)'.  Any word
starting with yi- should have a dialect variants with i-.  Since, as I say I
know more of Yd dialects elsewhre (esp. Western Europe), I have put my foot in
my mouth, someone will I am sure correct me.
