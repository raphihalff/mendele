Subject: Ya-tebe-dam

Louis Fridhandler's question about _ya-teb(y)e-dam_ in Yiddish (7.181) has
elicited several responses, but some questions remain.  The Yiddish
expression functions as a noun:  one can describe someone as _a gantser
ya-teb(y)e-dam_.  In standard (albeit colloquial) Russian the expression, as
has been pointed out, is a threatening sentence, 'I'll teach/show you!'
Apparently in Odessa the nominal use is possible:  _tselyi ia- tebe-dam_. 
Could any of our native speakers of Russian comment on whether this is
possible in other varieties of Russian?  Would they care to speculate as to
whether the nominal use is a Yiddishism in Odessa Russian? 

Incidentally, Yudel Mark, writing in _Yidishe shprakh_ 12 (1952):72,
suggested the Russian expression as the source of the Yiddish word _yat_
'guy':  "A ponim az dos iz a kirtsung fun dem lengern ya-tebe-dam vos men hot
ibergenumen fun rusish oder ukrainish un gebitn dem batayt:  der vos strashet
az er vet gebn a matnes yad, der vos hot koyekh tsu derlangen dem emesn
patsh, a rekhter khevre-man, a bokher mit beyner, a gezunter yung, a voyler
yung, a brat fun breter."

Subject: Mezuze

To continue the discussion on _mezuze_:  In Shloyme Bastomski's 1920 Vilna
colllection of proverbs, comparisons, curses, etc.  _Baym kval_, he includes
the expression "Zi iz a mezuze," adding the explanation:  "d.h., zeyer
oysgelasn, ale kushn zi" (49). 

And a slightly different comparison (from a 1942 list of "proverbs worth
using" in _Yidishe shprakh_):  "Yenems vayb iz vi a seyfer-toyre:  es iz a
mitsve a kush tsu ton."

Subject: Rondel and a finsterer sawf

I thing a rondel is a "randel"or "rajndel", diminutive of saucepan. "a
finstere sawf" is a "finsterer sof", from hebrew "sof',samech, vaf, fej, and
means end. a finsterer sof is, naturally a course, and means the opposite
of"happy end'.

Subject: a finsteren sof

As a more severe alternative to " a finsteren sof" I suggest "a misse
meshine" or Mitah meshunah in hebrew, a curse used for enemies only. It
means:  an unusual death

Subject: Nose

I seem to remember by mother using the word "Nyunya" for the word "nose". 
She would say of a man with an extremely prominent nose, "look at the nyunya
on him!". This was said in an amazed tone of voice with the barest hint of
laughter just under the surface. My mother was born in Warsaw and came to
America as a child of thirteen.  Does anyone else have knowledge of this
wonderful word?

Subject: Der Bay Article About Rochester

In the recent issue of "der bay", Boris Kopit describes a meeting of
Yiddishists in Rochester, New York at my house.  Unfortunately I need to
temper his enthusiasms with a dash of reality: The so-called committee has
yet to go beyond the enthusiasms of the afternoon... Mr Kopit himself will be
a very vital member of such a group when and if it comes to fruition!  The
most touching moments of the meeting did indeed come from the devotion and
emotion that the recent Eastern European Jews brought to the gathering. 
        
In a very noteworthy moment for Yiddish in Rochester, Rob and Roey Mendel,
upon the occasion of their recent wedding, have established the Mendel
Foundation for Yiddish Culture in Rochester.  They were the moving force
behind a Yiddishkeit Festival here a year ago last June.
        
It is certainly true that Rochester now has at least two families of recent
residency, (Steyn, of Mendele, and Kaminker mentioned in Kopit's article in
der bay ) who are masters of Yiddish! 
        
Sincerely,   
Leah Zazulyer

Subject: Disappointment in Yiddish

I am sure this discussion must have occured before on Mendele, but I don't 
know when.

I was at Grand Brass, a lamp parts store on the lower east side of Manhattan
and speaking to Karl Muller about yiddish matters, when he commented that
there was no yiddish word for disappointment.  The only thing he could come
up with was "oifgerekt" which we both agreed had more arousal in it than
disappointment should have.  I promised Karl that I would put it as a
question to the list.  Are there any suggestions out there? 

If the discussion has taken place on Mendele before, let's not waste time 
and space in public, but do address me at dk19@columbia.edu with information.

Thanks.

Dolores Kreisman
