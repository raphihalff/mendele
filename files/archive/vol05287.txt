Subject: "beys" oder "beyz"?

Viazoy darf men aroysredn dem nomen funem tsveytn os inem yidishn
alef-beys/[beyz]?  In _College Yiddish_ (4th ed., 1965) git U. Vaynraykh
_beyz_; azoy oykh Sheva Tsuker in _Yiddish:  An introduction..._ (1994).  Ober
der nomen iz dokh oysgeleygt beys-yud-sof, un in Vaynraykhs verterbukh (1968)
shteyt take _beys_.  (Un in shtub vu der rebe lernt kleyne kinderlekh iz dokh
heys, nit heyz.)

So why is the final sound sometimes voiced, flying in the face of the
spelling?  Does it have to do with the fact that the next letter in the
alphabet, _giml_, begins with voiced /g/ and not /k/, making
"_alef-beyz-giml..._" easier to say than "_alef-beys-giml..._" when reciting
the alphabet?  In any case, Weinreich's disagreement in 1968 with himself in
1965 is curious.

Subject: Help needed on finding a publication

A few years ago, a little booklet written by Nicholas De Lange, translator of
Amos Oz, crossed my desk.  It was about the problems of translation from
Hebrew into English, and I remember it as being fairly shrewd and sensible.
But I've misplaced it, and no library that I've checked seems to have a record
of it.  Does anyone recall seeing it and remember who published it?  Could it
have been the Jean and Samuel Frankel Centerfor Judaic Studies at the
University of Michigan or the Judaic Studies Program at the University of
Cincinnati?

Also, does anyone know if Mendele's "Fishke the Lame" has ever been translated
into English before now?  I've been reading an advance publication copy of
"Fishke," which Schocken is publishing as the fourth volume of its "Library of
Yiddish Classics" series, edited by Ruth Wisse, and am having some difficulty
with the translation.  It would be helpful if I had another translation
alongside it for comparison.  But again, no library, including the Library of
Congress, seems to  be aware of a previous translation of "Fishke."

And finally, is anyone aware of any published, in English, observations on
S.Y. Abramovitsch's (Mendele's) literary Yiddish?  It is treated as an archaic
and mannered Yiddish that deserves translation into an archaic and mannered
English, and reading it sounds to me like "Huck Finn" in Tuneyadevke.  If I
had some references to Mendele's Yiddish, and how it sounded to his readers
alongside of, say, Peretz's and Sholom Aleichem's, I might be able to get a
handle on this.

Thanks in advance,

Mark Shechner

Subject: "Der Farkishefter Shnayder" in Lviv

From The Ukrainian Arts Monitor v.3, #2, March 12, 1996, by Anthony Potoczniak

**Premiere in Yiddish**

Lviv.  The premiere dramatization of Sholom Aleichem's work "Zacharovanyj
kravets" [The Enchanted Tailor] will take place in the First Ukrainian Youth
Theater (Hnatiuk, 11) on March 17th at 4 p.m.  The author and producer of
this production is Moysei Batsian, director of the Jewish dramatic theater
studio "Maska".  The play will be performed in Yiddish with simultaneous
translation in Russian.

Lviv has one of the oldest Jewish theater traditions in Europe. In addition to
the theater "Maska", there were at least three major Jewish musical and
dramatic theater companies functioning in Lviv until the Second World War. The
theater company "Maska" was disbanded in 1949 and re-established in 1988.

Contact: Moysei Batsian, Telephone: +38 (0322) 743-090,
Ivan Franko Street 44-3, Ukraine.
