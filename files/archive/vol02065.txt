Subject: Mazl-tov

In his comments on mazl-tov (Mendele 2.05, from May -- I've
been catching up on reading) David Braun parenthetically
suggested that the expression means 'good luck' in Hebrew,
and is not used in Israeli Hebrew.  Not exactly.  The
expression does, of course, mean 'good luck' or 'a good
constellation', but that doesn't necessarily imply it means
'Good Luck!' i.e. 'I hope it will turn out well for you'
(which is, as David says, be-hatslakha).  It would be
interesting, and not difficult, to check the uses of the
phrase in pre-modern, i.e. pre-Yiddish, Hebrew.  In Israeli
Hebrew /mazal-tov/ (stress on the /-zal-/) is indeed used,
in just the same way as in Yiddish and English, to mean
'congratulations'.  I wouldn't be surprised if that meaning
is from Yiddish.  But to be sure, we'd have to check how it
was used in Hebrew earlier, and in non-Ashkenazic Jewish
communities.

I always wonder about the expression in the "mi shebeyrakh"
prayer said for the welfare of a newly delivered mother and
child, "...may [God] bless so-and-so and the son/daughter
who has been born to her be-mazal tov...".  What does this
mean?  '...who has, luckily, been born to her...', or
'...who has been born to her, and congratulations to the
proud parents!...'?

Subject: Derivation of "frum"

What's the etymology of "frum", which means (today)
observant of Orthodox Jewish law?  Did it ever have a
different meaning?

Subject: RE: 80-90

The discussion of 80-90 for "putz" reminds me of the origin
of the surname Katz.  As I understand it, it's kuf-tsadi,
the acronym for Kohen Tzedek.  Katz's are generally
Kohanim.

Are there other names or words in Yiddish that have come
into existence through this kind of acronymming?  (In
modern Hebrew there are plenty, like Tzahal for the army;
and of course it's common for the names of sages, such as
Rashi, Rambam, Ramban and the Gra.  What about in Yiddish,
though?)

Subject: Pan/pani/panie

Pani Aleychem would have to be Sholem's wife.  The
masculine term is Pan, and the feminine is Pani.  A
possible vocative for the masculine is Panie, so a man
could be addressed this way.

Subject: Yold

From J.J. Trunk's _Poyln_:

     ..di n'gidishe yungelaytlekh vos zenen--mit
     di yoldishe taleysim-zeklekh untern arem--
     gegangen in shtibl arayn davenen.

I'd never known "yold" to mean amything other than fool or
twerp.  What then does Trunk mean?  Lost zikh oys az in
Harkavy shteyt take: "son of a wealthy man".

Thus a word whose older meaning has just about disappeared
_and quite recently_.  Is that a correct inference? If so,
does anyone have a proposed explanation?  Are there other
words whose meanings have changed that drastically in the
last 50 years?

And the etymology?  Yeled?  I somehow don't think so.
Scandinavian maybe?
