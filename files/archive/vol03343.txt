Subject: Introduction

Having just become aware of Mendele, and being impressed by the quality
of its  exchanges,  I thought I'd  subscribe. Presently I catalog fine
art materials here but earlier I also did some Hebrew and Yiddish
cataloging.

My interests are broad, generally historical, and they include Eastern
European--especially Galician and Lithuanian--Jewish life and culture.
(Another interest is the American relationship with the Holy Land. Plug:
see my book TO SEE A PROMISED LAND published in 1993 by Penn State
Press).  That's about it.

Subject: Introduction

I'm Peter Stark, and I'm currently principal of the Kadimah / Worcester
Community Hebrew High School.  My field of scholarship (ABD) isn't
Yiddish, but rather Hebrew Bible and ancient Semitic languages. However,
I grew up in a bilingual home (English and Litvishe Yiddish) and have
made it a point of introducing the teaching of Yiddish in educational
institutions I've headed, including the International Summer Leadership
Training Programs for B'nai B'rith Youth.

Vos nokh?

B'nai B'rith sent me to the Soviet Union a number of times to run camps
for Jewish kids, in cities ranging from Vilna and Riga to Ufa to
Birobidzhan.  Without Yiddish, this work would have been much more
difficult, since my Russian is fairly rudimentary (though strong enough
to get by on the street or in shopping, but not in teaching).

It quickly became clear that when one let it be known that one spoke
Yiddish, one met a whole different population from those met by Hebrew
speakers with no Yiddish, so that impressions of the community in a given
city might vary wildly.  Israeli representatives (official and unofficial)
and American Jews who spoke Hebrew but no Yiddish tended to meet the same
folks, an activist, Zionist population, but not always a representative
population.

I had the wonderful experience in Ufa, a city closed to foreigners for
many years, of speaking in Yiddish to a group of elderly folks at a
public meeting, when the Russian translator was called away.  A
snowy-haired woman in the front row listened to me say a few sentences in
Russian and asked, "Ir redt Yiddish?" When I said that I did, she told me
to speak in Yiddish.  I described the Soviet Jewry movement in the US to
this group, which was pretty much unaware of the movement, and she began
weeping about 5 minutes into my talk.  Afterward, I approached her, and
she said that she had been very interested, but that she wept because she
hadn't heard Yiddish spoken in a public meeting "in 60 years."

I started a program as principal of Kadimah / Worcester to continue
working with Jews in Vilna.  Our high school students may take a training
course during which they plan a Jewish-cultural camp for Jewish kids in
Vilna, and each December, a group of our students goes and runs the camp.
We are the only counselors; we are the organizers.  In Vilna one still
finds some Yiddish-speaking children - though not many, sadly.

Final note: I speak Litvishe Yiddish because my dad is a native of Tartu
in Estonia, and my mom's folks were from Yanovich near Vitebsk.  My mom
grew up speaking Yiddish and attended a Sholem Aleikhem Shule in Sioux
City, Iowa.

Subject: Introduction; Courland

I've been on the network for about a year in silence. So here I am: I am
a retired Professor of Physiology in the College of Medicine, and Oral
and Maxillofacial Surgery in the College of Dentistry at The Ohio State
University.  I have also retired from my private practice.  What do I do
with all that time on my hands, now?  I'll tell you.  I am now a
non-degree track graduate student in the Dept of Yiddish at Ohio State.
Never had so much fun in my life!

   Nu, vos nukh, ir fregt.  Ikh vil aykh zogn:

   My mother's family came to the U.S. from Riga, Latvia (then part of
Tsarist Russian Empire).  They decribed themselves as "Courlanders" and
spoke "Courlandishe Yiddish" and "Courlandishe Deutch" as well as some
Letish.

   Does anyone know the origin of "Courland"?

   Does anyone have ANY information about a shetl or market-town called
VOROZHILOVKA?  There is a place called Vorozhilovgrad which is anondern
plotz.

Subject: help w/ translation, H. Leivick

I am puzzled by a word in an article of H. Leivick's, reprinted, in Di
Yidishe Gas (Ivriskaya Ulitsa) published in Moscow, 1993, Vol. 1

The article is called "Tsi hot di yidishe literatur a tsentrale ideye?"
The word I can't translate is spelled 'shin vov lamed lamed' and occurs
in the following phrase:

ver es iz 'sh-v-l-l' di lebedike role fun undzer literatur un fun undzer
yidish, iz 'sh-v-l-l' undzer koym-ideye umetum.

How would you translate this phrase?

Thanks

I suppose that it is not coincidental that the retail store

	"Ava Botelle Fashions"

is located in Newton, Massachusetts?

Subject: Galicia -- Etymology

>From vol. 3, p. 16 of the Slownik geograficzny Krolestwa Polskiego
(Warszawa:  1882), the authoritative historical gazetteer of
Poland:

"Halicz (zepewne od halka 'kawka'), niegdys stolica ziemi ruskiej
i siedziba ksiazat halickich, od ktorego dzisiejsza Galicya
(Halicya) otrzymala swa nazwe."

Iz der taytsh:
"Halicz (certainly from [Ukrainian] halka = 'jackdaw'), [was] for-
merly the capital of the Russian [Rusyn] land and the seat of the
Halicz duchy, from which today's Galicia (Halicia) received its
name."

Subject: Blondheim

Blondheim was an important Jewish / Judaica scholar, specializing in
Romance philology with a particular interest in the French glosses in
Rashi. He was seriously considered for appointment to the Miller chair at
Columbia, a postion which ultimately went to Salo W. Baron. Blondheim
taught at Hopkins and the University of Illinois.

Blondheim's personal life took strange and tragic twists. His affair with
Eleanor Dulles, the sister of John Foster Dulles, ultimately led to his
taking his own life when Eleanor became pregnant with his child.

This is but a brief note. For more, see Jewish Learning in American
Universities: The First Century, Indiana, forthcoming by Harold S.
Wechlser and the undersigned.
