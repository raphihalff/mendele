Subject: Introduction

I recently joined Mendele list.  I currently work at a museum, have
background in Hebrew and Russian, doctorate in history and various graduate
degrees in history and library science, and am a fabric artist and singer. I
decided to learn Yiddish because I feel that I need to know the language to
sing the songs, although it is very much an uphill battle after a certain
age.   I found your list when I was looking for the difference between
various handguns used by resistance fighters (I needed to know that for a
song program), and found a post that dealt with precisely that subject.  And
I was hooked.

Subject: Re: shnorer

I want to thank all who have clarified the meaning of shnorer and suggested
English equivalents. I feel I've shnored quite a bit of information, which
suggests yet another twist to the term.

Subject: re: shnodern

As has been mentioned "shnoder" is a corruption of Hebrew "shenodar". The
practise was rife in shuls in the UK up to and post WW2 especially in the
smaller more orthodox communities. It now seems to have died out to avoid
ostentation by wealthy congregants although some smaller congregations
continue. I can remember about 45 years ago attending a small shul on
Shabbat and the only Levi was a barmitzah boy who had no money to donate,
which caused a lot of discussion on the bima to his embarrassment. The
practise ceased soon afterwards. It always irritated me to see the smug
self-satisfied looks bestowed on the congregation by the more affluent after
being called up.

Subject: Re: meshulekh

The Habad movement calls its emissaries "sheluhim" [see Mendele 13.022], not
"shelihim"--the word used by the Zionist movement. The first actor to play
the meshulekh in Ansky's Dybbuk was the late Noah Nachbush. For many years
he personally recorded and packaged and mailed  his records to people who
ordered them. Not long before his death his recordings were purchased by CBS
and produced as a three record album.

Subject: Moyshe Kulbak, Vilne

I am seeking material on Moyshe Kulbak's poem "Vilne".  It can be found in
Yiddish, and in translation in "The Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse",
edited by Khome Shmeruk, Irving Howe, and Ruth Wisse.  Has anybody written
an analysis of this poem, penned by Kulbak?  I want to understand the poem,
and its description of Vilne.

I also would like to know if there is a university course in North America
on "Jewish Vilne", Yerushalayim D'Lite, or a university course on "The
Multi-Ethnic Make-Up of Wilno/Vilnius".

Subject: Re: mat'im zayn

Sholem Beinfeld's and Moshe Taube's answers [Mendele 13.023] to Martin
Green's question about the meaning of "iz mat'im yeder svore" in Peretz's
"Monish" seem conclusive, since they not only fit the context but have the
authority of Yitskhok Niborski's dictionaries behind them.  These answers
are also supported by two entries in Nahum Stutchkoff's "Oytser fun der
yidisher shprakh."  On page 328, right-hand column, among verbs with the
general meaning "to express," he lists "batonen, mat'im zayn, mamtik zayn;
aroysheybn, untershtraykhn."  On page 399, right-hand column, among verbs
with the general meaning "to indicate importance," he lists:
"untershtraykhn, mat'im zayn, aktsentirn, aroysheybn."  In both lists,
"mat'im zayn" is surrounded by verbs meaning to stress or emphasize.

Evidently as a guide to pronunciation, Stutchkoff has a pasekh under the
initial mem and includes a yud between the ayin and the final mem.

The answers pointing to the association of the word with "ta'am" (taste or
savor) and "te'amim" (cantillation signs) seem to enrich the poet's meaning.

Subject: News about Yiddish

Some Mendele readers may not yet know that it is now possible to keep
effortlessly in daily touch with Yiddish in the news.  Here's how: open
Google in your browser, click "News", then click "News Alerts" which you'll
find in the left margin.  Enter Yiddish and your email address and you're
set.  That takes care of news items in English.  You can also have mailed to
you items in French, German, Italian and Spanish.

Here are two items from a recent mailing.
