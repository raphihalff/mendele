Yiddish at Oxford: February 1995
================================

The unfortunate dispute between the Oxford Centre for Hebrew Studies and
the Oxford Institute for Yiddish Studies will hopefully be resolved by
compromise very shortly to the satisfaction of all parties concerned. The
issues have been somewhat clouded by inaccurate reporting in the British
press.  Suffice it to say that the financial side of the dispute concerns
the institutional ownership of disputed bank accounts, not any
accusations of personal abuse of funds.

Current activities at the Oxford Institute for Yiddish Studies
==============================================================

This term (Oxford Hilary term, Jan-March 1995), the Institute established
by Dovid Katz, is offering six courses ranging from "Elementary Yiddish"
to "Christian Studies in Yiddish, 1514-1913".  Five of the six are taught
in Yiddish.

The Institute publishes the world's only Yiddish literary monthly, "The
Yiddish Pen" and we am happy to offer a complimentary copy of a recent
issue to any teacher of Yiddish. We are on the lookout for new talent in
Yiddish poetry and prose.  The closing date for our first annual prose
prize (1000 pounds Sterling, about $1500) has been extended to the end of
February (FAX your entries now!).  The magazine also accepts short
reviews of recently published books.  The editor is Dovid Katz, who
founded Yiddish studies at Oxford and continues to direct Yiddish studies
at the University of Oxford. The editorial staff comprises Dov-Ber
Kerler, Johannes Brosi and myself, Gennady Estraikh.

The 1000 column folio volume, "Oxford Yiddish III" (forty papers in
Yiddish literature, linguistics, folklore, history and more, edited by
Dovid Katz) has just come off the press.  Three new literary books (by
Yonia Fain, Moshe Shteingart and Boris Karloff) are in production.

Any questions about the magazine, our new books and the annual prose
prize can be addressed to me at the Oxford Institute for Yiddish Studies,
Golden Cross Court, 4 Cornmarket, Oxford, OX1 3EX. Tel 01144 1865 798989.
FAX 01144 1865 798987.

Subject: Tevye

My class has "finished" *Tevye* (because we must go on, we could likely
talk about the book much longer) and so I wanted to just respond briefly
to a couple of comments about my posting (which presented some issues my
class had considered): Larry Rosenwald talked about Tevye and Chava.  He
said that "Tevye has to confront in her his own curiosity and has to come
up against what turns out to be in him the limits of that curiosity--the
place where his curiosity is bounded by dogma." I think this is a nice
reading of the process Tevye goes through. In my class, though, the
general consensus was that Tevye did not come up against "dogma" exactly.
Perhaps this was a utopic look at Tevye on our part but, he seemed, at
least in our reading of the text to be "faithful" rather than "dogmatic".
What do you think?

Louis Fridhandler talked about the historical significance of Chava's
intermarriage and the idea of a "dorf" (village) vs. a shtetl.  The issue
of dorf living vs. shtetl living was interesting in class.  It was clear
to me that *Fiddler on the Roof* had _so_ permeated the culture in which
my students grew up that despite my discussion of shtetl vs. dorf (ie.,
what is a shtetl?  a dorf?  who lived there?  etc.) the class continued
to ask questions like, "Why weren't there other Jews persecuted along
with Tevye?" and I would continually remind them to look at the text and
see where Sholem Aleykhem's Tevye lived.  It was very interesting.
Showing the film "Tevye" was helpful in this regard.  For some reason the
visual image of a kind of dorf was very helpful to them. The historical
significance of the intermarriage (and of each of Tevye's new eydems
(sons-in-law) was not lost on the group, although we tried to get away
from talking _only_ about the novel in the context of history and to react
to it as literature for the sake of literature.

We are on to Peretz!  First "Between Two Mountains" and then "In the
Mailcoach"  both from Ruth Wisse's _The I.L. Peretz Reader_.

Subject: Mentsh words

Neyekh Zide asks:

> How about (Meylekh Vishvanath ? ) Urdu insaan ?

Of course.  And since Neyekh brought that up, I started to thinking, and
in Tamil, too, 'manithan' means both human being and mentsh.  Perhaps
this is a not uncommon phenomenon, once one goes past the western
european indo-european languages.
