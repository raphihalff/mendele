Subject: The death of Yiddish

My colleague Anatole Beck (I am a Professor of Mathematics at the
University of Illinois in Urbana) announces the death of Yiddish in
Israel.  I am sure that most Mendelniks are well aware that nothing
could be further from the truth. Not only are there substantial
pockets of population where Yiddish is the language of everyday
life, there are also healthy audiences for Yiddish theater,vigorous
programs in the universities, etc.  Oyf uns gezogt!

Subject: Henry Roth's latest book (per Philologos)

In his Feb. 25th "On Language" column in the English "Forward,"
Philologos devotes himself to the derivation of the pejorative term
"mockie," which has been variably traced to the Yiddish "make" ("a
make oyf dir") and the name Mo (from Moyshe).  Henry Roth, in his
new book "Mercy of a Rude Stream," gives another explanation: "But
now on 119th Street, among all the goyim jeering at Jews: 'Mockies:
Make money, oy.'  Some even had learned how to say it in Yiddish:
Makh geldt [sic]..." Philologos broadens Roth's etymology to include
the Yiddish verb "makhn" in general.  This alone might make for an
interesting -- nay, interminable -- discussion on MENDELE.  Nor nit
dos bin ikh oysn, as it says in the good book.

Philologos then proceeds to discuss other Yiddishisms in "Mercy of a
Rude Stream," beseeching his readers to explain whether Roth was
"confused or if he is accurately quoting dialectical [sic?] uses
(his parents came to America from Polish Galicia) that have
subsequently disappeared.  Were there actually Jews who said
"tokken" instead of takke [sic] for 'indeed'?  Or who nasalized the
ayin in mayseh, a story or tall tale, so that it sounded like
'manseh'?  (Such nasalization does occur in a small number of
Yiddish words, as in the name Yakov, commonly pronounced as Yankev.)
Or who instead of ikh hob, 'I have,' said 'ikh khom'?....  The
strangest word I came across in Mr. Roth's new book is 'shmoolyaris'
(singular, 'shmoolyareh'), used by his Jewish immigrants to mean
'dollars.'  Do any of you remember such a word from your childhoods?
Could it possibly come from 'Shmul,' the Yiddish form of the Hebrew
name Shmuel or Samuel -- that is Uncle Sam?"

Any takers, MENDELnikes?

Subject: 1.Names of Yiddish 2. Maybe the same

1. Names of Yiddish. Even in Yiddish, the name 'yidish' must be
considered a relatively late appelation. An article in "Der Tog" of
January 21, 1916 (!!) announces the following little known event:
"In der barimter Kolombiye yuniversiti vet men in gikhn onheybn tsu
gebn a kurs in yidish". The author, B. Gorin, then feels compelled
to explain, at considerable length what he means by "yidish", for
what he  estimates is more than 50% of his readers, who know only
the terms "mame-loshn" or "zhargon" (then still a non-offensive
designation) for the language they speak. I, too, spoke "Jewish"
before I spoke "Yiddish", and my Yiddish loving uncle never
understood why some people were incensed when he boasted to his
friends in the "shop" that his "plimenik iz gevorn a profeser fun
zhargon".

The decision to differentiate "Jewish" from "Yiddish", in American!!
English seems to me to be an acknowledgment of the fact that there
are other "Jewishes", Judezmo among them. Of course, the split in
English, which makes us feel that "Do you speak Jewish?" is a bit
off key, has also led to even less acceptable collocations like "I
don't like Yiddish cooking?"

The problem is reflected in the title of the Yiddish dialect atlas,
and I expect to say more about it in the Introduction to Volume III
(Volume II is now in press). In all of Uriel Weinreich's (and my
own) references to the Atlas in Yiddish, the work is entitled
"Yidisher shprakh- un kultur-atlas". The title in English is
"Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry". Weinreich felt
that "Jewish Language and Culture" would be staking too broad a
claim, and that "Yiddish Culture" was a bit off the mark in English.
"Yiddish verbal culture" would have been OK, if awkward. Hence
"ASHKENAZIC JEWRY".

Furthermore, the original plans for the Yiddish Atlas foresaw the
possibility of a subsequent "Jewish Language and Culture Atlas" that
would examine the geographic distribution of Jewish language and
culture features across Jewish language boundaries. Keith Weisser,
take note!

Unfortunately, even those who should know better (YIVO-bleter, for
example) have made the mistake of translating the English title back
into Yiddish as "Shprakh- un kultur-atlas fun ashkenazishe yidn". No
way. Librarians and bibliographers beware!!

I may be repeating myself but, I think that English, in Britain and
Ireland, continues to use "Yiddish" to mean 'Jewish'. I've heard "a
Yiddishe (sic!) boy" and I know that several years ago, the New York
Times carried an obituary for a former employee who, having been
born in Dublin, had been the president of the "Yiddish Sons of
Eire".

Let me add, by the way, that Anatole Beck may be right. There were
none too friendly publications about Yiddish in 18th century France
entitled, "Argot juifs".

2) Yitzhak Kertesz: P.S. Even Shoshan's use of "lashon meduberet"
seems to me to be a euphemism for "Yiddish" (see, for example, the
entry "davar akher" s.v. "davar"). Do you think, by any stretch of
the imagination, that references you to "spaetrabbinisch" can ever
have the same euphemistic connation?
