For Holger Nath:

I too have been using Nota Bene 4 till I switched to a Mac recently, but I'm
no Spets. Why don't you address your problem to the Notabene list, where
there are lots of Mayvins? To subscribe, send to listserv@taunivm.bitnet the

Subject: Pishe Peyshe, and a welcome

Neach Zide:

My source for the rules of Pishe Peyshe is Leo Rosten's _The Joys of
Yiddish_, which I believe (I'm not at all sure) has been republished
as _The Joys of Yinglish_. He spells it something like Pishe Paishe
or Pisha Paisha, and gives only the rule I posted here previously,
namely that the game is played simply by placing a card higher or
lower by one than the current top card on the discard pile, e.g. if
the top card of the discard pile were an 8, one could play a 7 or a
9. Rosten describes it as basically a game of luck, often played
with convalescent children.

Meyshke Alpert:

I have really enjoyed hearing you play and sing, and (the more so
since I'm also a musician) am very excited that you are on this
list. Welcome! (sorry if that sounded too sappy ;> )

Shalom un zayt mir ale gezunt,

Marnen Laibow-Koser

Subject: Amolek

Mikhl Herzog (Mendele 3.232) suggests the possibility that "except
for its occurrence in the Bible (referent unknown), the term
Ashkenaz probably appears for the first time in Europe as a
designation for Jewish merchants from the East (Armenia?) who moved
westward and gave their name to the western Jews among whom they
settled?" I was told a long time ago by the late Arcadius Kahan that
many of these names for European countries (Ashkenaz, Sepharad,
Kna'an, etc.) came from a medieval Hebrew atlas and that the name
for Armenia there was "Amolek." Can anyone provide details or give
the name of the author? Thanks.

Subject: Zamenhof's grammar of Yiddish

Zachary Baker asked about the text of Zamenhof's Yiddish grammar.
According to Ulrich Lins, La dangxera lingvo (1990-Progreso edition,
p. 19, note 2), the Russian manuscript was pubished with an
Esperanto translation in: Adolf Holzhaus. "L. Zamennhof, provo  de
gramatiko de novjuda lingvo"   "Alvoko al la juda intelektularo"
Helskinki 1982, p. 9-36. I unfortunately have seen neither of these
yet.

Zamenhof published an article in 1909 in Yiddish in Lebn un
visnshaft, no. 1. 7/9. This has been translated into Esperanto and
appears (under the title: pri jida gramatiko kaj reformo en la jida
lingvo/ de d-ro x "On Yiddish grammar and reform of the Yiddish
language / by Doctor X") in "Hebreo el la geto: de cionismo al
hilelismo. 1976, Eldonejo Ludovikito, vol. 5 of the "iam
kompletigota plena verkaro de l. l. zamenhof, pp. 36-50. Esperanto
translations from Yiddish of Zamenhof's "examples of Yiddish
versification--iambic, trochaic, dactylic, amphibrachic, anapest are
given on pp. 50-51 of the same volume.

(An interesting aside: the Esperanto word for "wife": edzino is said
to come from Yiddish, specifically from the ending in reb-etsn
(i.e., rebitsn).
