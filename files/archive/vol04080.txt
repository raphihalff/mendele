Subject: Fun shames

At long last the logjam is broken.  Mendele is running again.  I hope
no one's feelings will be injured if I say that none of this would have
happened if the person with whom one was forced to deal had majored in
French or botany--anything in fact but computer science.

Yednfals, mir zenen do.  Me vil fun aykh hern!

Subject: Introduction

I am a new user.  My name is Janice, and I would like to learn more about
Yiddish.  My grandparents speak Yiddish to each other when they want to
tell secrets, but I really understand very little.  I hope this is a good
place to learn.

Subject: Introduction

My interest in Yiddish arises out of research on the marxist economist
Henryk Grossmann who was one of the founders of the Jewish Social
Democratic Party of Galicia in 1905, before he embarked on his main
academic researches and came to prominence as a member of the Institut
fuer Sozialforschung in Frankfurt am Main. In order to find out about
Grossmann's early activities I started to read some Yiddish language
material on the Bund and JSDP, and to seek out his Yiddish publications,
notably through YIVO.

If anyone can make suggestions about research in this area I would be
grateful for advice.

I teach courses on Australian Political Economy, German and Austrian
Political Economy, and Classical Marxism. I have conducted research and
published on social democratic economic policy in Australia, economic
crisis in Australia, the Australian Labor Party and contemporary fascism
in Germany. As well as Grossmann I am currentlyworking on the history of
class analysis in Australia and a comparison of economic restructuring in
Germany and Australia.

Subject: Introduction

Hi!  My name is Debbie Bailin, I grew up hearing Yiddish regularly from 4
Russian-born grandparents, and I understood it but couldn't carry on a
conversation in it.  Like many others on this list I suspect, I'm really
feeling the loss of my grandparents' generation and with them the Yiddish
language.  I've never learned to read Yiddish, I never hear it anymore,
and I'm afraid of losing the little bit I've retained.  So, when I
accidently ran across this list, it seemed like a pretty valuable
resource to plug into. I'm looking forward to seeing these commuications
and to participating at whatever level I can.  Is this enough info to
begin with?

Thanks.

Deb Bailin

alevay! that's wonderful! one suggestion: what you propose is very
ambitious and would of course be wonderful. however, you might think of
streamlining your goals and leaving out, for the first stage at least,
the dialectological tagging/addressing. while i realize it's very dear to
your heart, there's a lot of use that could and would be made of such an
archive that is not concerned with dialect issues. (i for one would much
prefer syntactic tagging--but raw text would be fantastic all by itself.)

good luck!

Subject: Netiquette

Zellig Bach may be silently forgiven for having missed the word play in
the subject line of my gentlest of corrections, sent to him by private
e-mail, but riposting [to] that message in a public forum is, to my mind,
an unfortunate (and probably uncharacteristic) lapse in judgment. How
many of us would like to see our MENDELE-engendered e-mail reposted,
without permission, to the net?
