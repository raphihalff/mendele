Subject: Source of Yiddish poem "Oysn shtetl, nebn weldl"

My mother used to recite the following poem (roughly transliterated).  Does
anyone know the author and source?

Oysn shtetl, nebn weldl, in a pustn tol,

Vu di shvartse kroyen krekhtsn mit a heyzerikn kol,

Dort iz do a zump, a tife, un say fri, say shpet,

Kvakn, krekhtsn dort di zhabes vi mit a gebet.

 

Un m'zogt di kleyne kinder vern dort gebrakht

Vos der Ashmoday, der shvartser, ganvet tsu banakht,

Un zey vern bald megulgl un tsu zhabes glaykh,

Un zey kvakn un zey krekhtsn funem tifn taykh.


A dank,

Peter Belenky

Subject: Seeking Yiddish Teacher for Washington University, St. Louis

Washington University in St. Louis is seeking a Yiddish teacher with an advanced degree 
and/or prior college-level teaching experience in Yiddish.  The class would be taught as 
part of the University College, so the class would be an evening course (likely once a 
week for 2.5 hours).  It would be open to both WashU students and community members. 
Contact Arielle Ross at Arielle.ross@wustl.edu for more information.

Subject: shtrikverter

Can someone help me with authentic Yiddish vocabulary for knitting terms?  Or did 
Russians use Russian terminology, Germans used German vocabulary, and so forth? Yes, 
I know the words for knit and purl.  Increase and decrease and some other terms are 
probably obvious enough.  But there must have been words for ribbing, for example.  
Maybe it is "rips," maybe it is "ripn," or maybe something else entirely.  Does someone 
know?  Continuing in this vein, there must have been a word for a popcorn, for a bobble, 
for a cable stitch (along with terms used for a cable, including front and rear crosses), for 
a drop stitch, for cast on, for a slip stitch, and for the various decrease and increase 
methods; in other words, serious knitters must have had a specialized vocabulary for 
knitting.  I've asked many native Yiddish speakers, but most of those to whom I have 
access were crocheters, not knitters.  I've asked at trimmings stores in Monsey, but ultra 
Orthodox communities in the US seem to have adopted American vocabulary for 
handwork.  To date, knitters I've met with fluent Yiddish had never thought about doing 
their knitting in Yiddish.

Subject: tekse

Michael Sweet asks about a word "tekse" but in spelling it he adds an ayin after the koph. 
Teke (pl.s) is a portfolio or briefcase. Could the old friends possibly be referring to his 
new high status in which he carries such a case habitually?

I am only guessing.
