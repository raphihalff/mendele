Subject: Festschrift for Alexis Manaster Ramer: Call for Papers.

My name is Fabrice Cavoto, and I am contacting you to announce you that I 
have decided to edit and arrange publication for a Festschrift for Alexis 
Manaster Ramer.

As Alexis has worked in many different disciplines of linguistics, the book 
will be divided into several sections, including the following:
-Mathematical Linguistics
-Theoretic. linguistics
-Comparative/Historical Linguistics: papers on any aspect of historical 
linguistics are welcome, but I particularly hope to represent the areas in 
which Alexis has been active, such as Indo-European (especially Armenian), 
Yiddish, Uto-Aztecan, and wider constructs, such as Nostratic and its 
daughter language families.
-Anthropological Linguistics and Anthropology
-Phonetics and Phonology
-Misc./Other categories. (pidgins, creoles, computational linguistics, 
etc.)

I am currently trying to contact potential publishers. However, in order to 
approach some important publishers more easily, I will need to have a list 
of potential contributors as soon as possible.

The deadline for the receipt of all papers is 1 July 2000.
It is of crucial importance that you let me know as soon as possible 
(before Monday 4 October 1999) if you plan to contribute to this 
Festschrift.

Given the wide variety of the subjects in which Alexis Manaster Ramer has 
worked, we would like to have as many contributions to this Festschrift as 
possible. Needless to say the number of contributions will also be relevant 
for finding a publisher.

I hope you will accept to contribute to the Festschrift, which is meant in 
a spirit of loyalty and gratitude to Alexis Manaster Ramer, one of the 
leading figures in every linguistic field he has been working on.
Looking forward to your answer.

Subject: MLA Bibliography

MLA International Bibliography
Call for Bibliographers

The MLA Bibliography is in need of bibliographers to index Hebrew- and
Yiddish-language material in the subject areas of language, literature,
linguistics, and folklore. 

The bibliography is compiled by MLA staff members and by a network of over
120 scholars worldwide.  Bibliographers cover a group of periodicals in
their own fields and submit their indexing to the MLA office. The MLA staff
fosters a cooperative working arrangement with bibliogaphers that allows
them to offer work based on their individual specialties. Those who
contribute to this effort provide an important service both to individual
scholars and to the international scholarly community. 

To acknowledge bibliographers' contributions the MLA sends the printed
volumes of the bibliography for the years that they have contributed. 

For information on contributing to the bibliography write to Terence Ford,
Editor, MLA International Bibliography, 10 Astor Place, New York, NY 10003;

Subject: Yiddishisms in Russian

For an essay about a Russian-Jewish writer, I need information about certain
Yiddishisms as they filter into Russian (particularly its Odessa variant). 
Are there any essays I could read?  Articles on Yiddish-to-English would
also be helpful.  I'm interested mostly in syntactic borrowings and
translations of idioms and set phrases.  If you like, reply directly to me.

Subject: dybbuk

To Michael Steinlauf:

To find out more about the original production of The Dybbuk by the Vilna
Troupe - you should read the book On Stage, Off Stage, Memories of a
Lifetime in the Yiddish Theater, written by the last surviving member of the
company Luba Kadison. You can order it from Harvard University Press. In
addition to appearing in the world premiere, Luba Kadison is the daughter of
Vilna Troupe cofounder, Leib Kadison and the widow of actor Joseph Buloff. 
She has a chapter about the Dybbuk in her book.  Miriam Orleska died in a
death camp with the business manager and cofounder of the Vilna Troupe
Mordechai Mazo after being transported there from the Warsaw ghetto. 

Sincerely,

Caraid O'Brien

Subject: Learn the Alef-Beys.

Recently Noyekh Miller has urged the readers of the Mendele List to learn
the Alef-Beys. [Vol. 9.026: Now's the time to learn the Yiddish alef-beys]
Are there really such people who cannot read the Hebrew characters which are
used to write Yiddish, but know how to read and write Yiddish in the Roman
alphabet? Who are they? Why did they never learn the Hebrew equivalents of
the Roman alphabet? Should they learn the Hebrew Alef-Beys? 

I think that there are probably two groups of people who know Yiddish, but
not the Hebrew script.  The first and probably most numerous group consists
of people who had Yiddish as their 'mame-' or 'bobe-loshn', but who were
never taught the Hebrew script or how to read and write the language.  The
second group consists of people who took up the study of Yiddish at a later
age and fearing the difficulty of learning a new script decided to make do
with Yiddish in Roman script. This group might include people of the first
group. 

There is no way that someone knowing spoken Yiddish could read or write
Yiddish in Roman script, when only educated in reading and writing the
English language. The spelling system used for Yiddish, in Hebrew or Roman
script, is, as in most European languages, quite regular. One sound is
basically represented by one letter or combination of letters.  If more than
one sound is attributed to one letter, the sound can be determined by the
position of the letter in the word. This fundamental idea is only partially
realised in the English spelling system.  Someone who has not studied the
Yiddish spelling system can not correctly encode the spoken word or decode
the written word. 

Those who have mastered reading and writing Yiddish in Roman script, who
know the spelling rules and what pronunciation goes with the Roman script
when it is used to write Yiddish, only have to learn the Hebrew equivalents
of the Roman letters in order to use standard dictionaries, get access to
Yiddish literature in Hebrew script and to correspond with Yiddish speakers
who don't know the Roman script. 

Is it hard to learn the Hebrew script? Is it hard to learn to use the
script? Not really. There are 24 basic characters plus 5 variants indicating
a different letter, plus an additional 5 characters that double other
letters, but are used at the end of a word. As in our Roman script, there
are 'printed' characters and 'handwritten' characters, but there are no
capital letters in either. The Hebrew script is written from right to left,
which normally causes some problems reading Hebrew text in the beginning.
The eye of the reader who is accustomed to reading Roman left to right
script might have some problems finding the next line in a text.
Scan-reading or looking for a particular place in the text remains
difficult.  Learning to read and write Hebrew script is not more difficult
than learning the Russian or Greek script. Since all alphabetic writings in
existence have a common ancestor in the Phoenician script, the idea is
clear, it just takes some practice. With the aid of a primer one could learn
five or more characters a day, get the alef-beys down in a week and become a
'mayven' within a month - a bit depending on the time available. 

The advantages of learning the Hebrew script are obvious, are there
disadvantages? Yes, in non-Soviet Yiddish publications the 'loshn-koydesh'
words are given in the standard Hebrew spelling, without vowels. Unless one
recognises the word, there is no way to determine the pronunciation.
Moreover, six characters of the alef-beys (veys, khes, kof, sin, tof, sof,)
are exclusively used in writing 'loshn-koydesh' words. In Roman
transliteration and in Soviet spelling these letters are identical to six
others, (vov, khof, kuf, samekh, tes, samekh).  For those who don't know
Hebrew this is a difficulty. On the other hand, these words can be looked up
in standard dictionaries, that give the pronunciation in Roman script. To my
knowledge there is no dictionary that gives all words of this type either in
romanised form or in Soviet Hebrew script spelling. 

As indicated above, the contents of the Hebrew Alef-Beys as used for Yiddish
and the Romanised Alef-Beys are not exactly the same. Six letters are
'missing'. The YIVO Roman transcription, the standard for 'Romanised
Yiddish', is further not a transcription whereby each Hebrew character is
replaced by a Roman character. For instance, the 'khof', 'tsadek' and
'shin', single characters in the Hebrew script, are represented by the
combined characters 'kh', 'ts' and 'sh' in transcription. The initial 'alef'
as vowel support is omitted in transcription. The 'combined vowels' of the
Hebrew script are not transcribed as originally written: 'tsvey yudn'
becomes 'ey'; 'tsvey yudn mitn pasek' - 'ay'; the sequence 'vov-yud' - 'oy'
etc.  Apart from these differences in transcription, the YIVO spelling or
'oysleyg' is the same, whether one uses the Hebrew or the Roman characters. 

The YIVO transcription or Romanisation is, as witnessed by many contibutions
over the years in the Mendele list, misunderstood by some.  Some people find
fault with the YIVO transcription because one has to write some words in a
different way than they are pronounced. An example is the spelling of 'oyf',
pronounced 'af'. Spelled in Hebrew characters the same problem exists, if
one spells correctly. Hebrew script is not better to represent alternative
pronunciations used by certain groups of Yiddish speakers. The YIVO
transcription is not 'phonetic' in more or less detail than the Hebrew
script.  It certainly is not a system based on the American spelling rules,
as some people seem to think.  The Hebrew script is not basically better
than the Romanisation - the YIVO transcription is at least fully compatible
with the Soviet system to write Yiddish in Hebrew script.  The only thing
one could say is that Yiddish is Yiddish, a language of old written in the
Hebrew script. The only reason not to use Hebrew script is not having a
Hebrew typewriter or a computer that can handle it. (The YIVO transcription
was thought up in pre-computer days and clearly aims at making it possible
to type Yiddish on a Roman script typewriter, without using diacritics. A
solution for computer use would aim at automatic transcription from Roman to
Hebrew by changing fonts).

Subject: translation

I am not having any luck finding a fund that will pay a translator to 
translate Joseph Schein's book on S. Mihoels. Is there anyone willing to 
translate for free so that the book can be shown to a publisher. In this way 
the translator would have the fee later. Of course this is a risk. But it 
means  we can read about this vitally important Yiddish actor
Please let me know

Subject: Jewish Haikus

Regarding the quotations previously submitted from David M. Bader's book,
_Haikus for Jews_, probably the most meaningful haiku to those
subscribing to Mendele is the one appering on the last page of the book:

Yenta, Shmeer, Gevalt,
        Shlemiel, Shlimazl, Tochis,
                Oy! To be fluent!

Yours truly,

Subject: "shmoktelyakes"

In response to Jason Payne [09.027]. Might this be  "shmokhtelyakes" ?

I recollect "shmokhteh" as a variation of "shmatteh" in my household.  In
which case, I would think that "shmoktelyakes" might be knick-knacks on the
desk (i.e. objects without any intrinsic utility). 

A related concept is, "shmontzkehs" which I have heard aplied to costume
jewelry aka "the better-type cheap junk" (a Myron Cohen sobriquet).

Subject: Introduction

Friends,

It is my first encounter with the Mendele group. My love for Yiddish is
still there, even after more than 50 years since I live in Israel. 

Along the sad reality of the decline of the Yiddish language, it is a great
confort to see the interest it raises among young scholars. 

I will of course follow with great interest your publication and would like
to offer my assistance in any way I can. 

Mit a fraindlichen griss
