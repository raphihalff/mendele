Subject: farreysht

Alan Shuchat asks "What does this word mean and how is it spelled?".

From the context, I would hypothesize that the word means "enriched," in the
sense used by cooks, and is related to German "reich", meaning "rich."

Subject: farreysht

My father used the word to mean fried until brown and crispy and pronounced
the word "farraysht." My father preferred to use onrayshen rather than
farrayshen; for example, a brown crispy piece of potato was "an ongerayshte
shtikle kartofel."

My father came from Zdunska Wola which is near Lodz.  My mother who comes
from a town near Vilna was unfamiliar with the term until she married my
father.

Subject: Waiting for Mendele

In der mittel-alter yohren, iz geveyn in der amolliker Bavel an hekherer
Yiddisher amt, der Goyen, vus iz  derkennt un untershtitzt gevoren fun der
Makhmodenisher Sultan.

Zayn oytoritayt vegn der Yiddish din iz anerkent in alle farvorfene Yiddishe
kehillos in Ayropa. Iz geveyn a vikhukh tzvishen tzvey ortiker rabbonim,
flegt men shrayben a briev tzum Goyen in Bavel, un varten oyf zayn entfer.

Six weeks ago, we had a disagreement in my household concerning the
interpretation of a passage in Yiddish literature. I wrote a letter, posted
it to Mendele, and waited. Two weeks later, my letter appeared. Two weeks
after that, the next volume of Mendele appeared, but without any response to
my question. So I waited for the next volume of Mendele, which came a few
days ago. Although there was still no answer, I still had hope, because this
week's volume consisted of letters that were originally posted back in
mid-April.

Finally, today, I received the two latest volumes of Mendele. Since today's
volumes consist of correspondence from the month of May, I conclude that my
original question has in fact gone un-answered. It took me six weeks to find
this out. The point is, if someone HAD chosen to answer my letter, and done
so as soon as he read my original posting, it STILL would have taken me six
weeks to get an answer.

I subscribe to several mailing lists on the internet. Most of them provide
"instant gratification". When a letter is posted, it appears immediately,
with no human intervention. In the words of an old TV commercial for the
Patty Stacker, "your hands need never touch the meat".

Why is this mailing list different from all other mailing lists? Do the
subscribers prefer to keep our  present system, out of a kind of nostalgia
for the days of the Babylonian Gaon? Or do they find it as frustrating as I
do? I look forward to hearing an answer to this question some time around
August.

Subject: Another Copyright Question

Khaye Davis asks whether copyright protection still applies to stories by
Leah K. Hofman ("Kleyne in der Groyser Velt") published by Farlag Leben and
with a copyright statement: (c) 1920 by Noach Steinberg. Nothing I say
should be taken as legal advice, and I'm not as familiar with US copyright
law as with Canadian law (I'm the chair of the Ontario Library Association
Copyright Task Force and a member of the Canadian Library Association's
Standing Committee on Copyright). It is my understanding that any work for
which copyright was received (it required registration back then) before
1923 is now in the public domain in the United States and can be freely
re-published, translated, etc., etc.

Subject: chremslach

This is in response to the enquiry from Paul Ilie dated Apr 22 and appearing
in your June 2 issue re chremslach which I spell in capitals because I enjoy
them muchly.

My mother died in 1970 at age 86 and part of my inheritance,in addition to
her committment to Yiddish culture and language. was her recipe for
chremslach which I made many times since.I also picked up from the Internet
a recipe from "Jewish Cooking in America" by Joan Nathan , which naturally
is not as good as my mother's,in my estimation, and does differ in that mine
puts a filling in a sort of flattened pocket,whereas Nathan's mixes it all
together into a pancake.

So Fania Cherniack's recipe is:1.  mix in the following order to form  a
pancake; 6 eggs,1/2 cup shmaltz{for which I substitute vegetable oil},1/2
cup sugar, 2 1/2 cups water and Matzah meal sufficient to thicken it to the
proper consistency.2.  Prepare:  1 lb. cut cooked prunes,1 cup raisins,1
lemon rind & juice ,and grind them all for the filling,and fold the filling
into the pocket of the pancake.So now it is a chremsel,which should be
browned in a skillet in oil,drained on a paper towel,and then dipped in warm
honey and served and devoured as a side dish, at any time but of course at
Pesach time.

Subject: chremslach

Paul Illie has asked for memories regarding Chremslach, to the best of my
knowledge it was and is used in the Chasidic community to mean small round
"latkes" - potato pancakes made of cooked potatoes which is then fried in
oil. (Regular "Latkes" are generally made out of raw potatoes.) It is
generally perceived as "a pesachdiche meichel" (since potatoes was an
essential staple) though it also would be appropriate on Chanukah.

I suppose that "chremslech" like other Yiddish names for various cooked
foods may have had different meanings in different times and places. In any
case to those that wish to make chremslech I say "ess gezunterheit mit a
guten apetit"

Subject: chremslach

In response to Paul Ilie, our chremslach were and still are very much a
Pesach only delicacy.  The chremslach are round discs of a matzo-meal
mixture about a centimetre or two thick and maybe 4cms in diameter, fried on
both sides till nicely browned and then served with a topping of cinnamon
and sugar.

Subject: chremslach

I love this list! I've been a dedicated lurker for a number of years, and
it's great just soaking up the information and trying to remember the little
bit of Yiddish I picked up from my grandparents and parents as a kid.
Finally, I have something to contribute!  My grandmother ran a boarding
house in Atlantic City and considered herself a professional cook.  If she
gave out recipes, she usually left out an important ingredient, but I did
manage to get her recipe for chremslach, a delicacy that was only for
Pesach.  Hers were more like chubby, oval patties than pancakes, and they
were about 5 inches long, 3 inches or so wide. The main ingredients are
matzo meal, honey and chopped dried fruit -- raisins, apricots, prunes,
whatever's available.  A real patzkeh (sorry about the spelling if it's
wrong)to make because they stick to your hands when you're making them into
patties. My grandmother fried them, but they're not bad baked for the health
conscious.  If anyone would like the recipe, you can contact me at
wutmeworry@aol.com.

Best,

Deb Bailin

Subject: slivkes; hitsl

Lucas Bruyn in Vol.10.005 writes that it would be unusual to use a plural
form in Yiddish ("slivkes") where it is singular in other European
languages. Slivkes can actually only be plural in Russian ("slivki"; there
is no "slivka"), but this example notwithstanding (here it is simply a
calque) - as soon as the word is borrowed it can be used in any way peculiar
to the borrowing language. Thus, in a recent article by M.Tsanin I
encountered the phrase "in di vayte tayges", whereas the word "tayge"
(taiga) can only be singular in Russian. Slivkes are not necessarily whipped
or sweet, and it is common to use them with either tea or gebeks.

Sholem-Aleykhem in "Dos meserl" uses the word hitsl: "A, du hitsl eyner!
Krikh shoyn arop, krikh, vest shoyn leyzn! Du, hintshleger, du kolboynik
eyner, ...". The Sovetish Heymland edition (#7, 1989) in an explanatory
footnote translates: "hitsl; hintshleger - gitsel', lovets bezdomnykh
sobak". We called someone of this specific profession "der gitsl" (not
"hitsl"), or in Russian - "gitsel'". However, this word is dialectal in
Russian (restricted to the so-called Malorossiya) and I met it only once in
the literature (A.Kuprin "Yama"/Di Grub) as a description of this
profession. V.Dal' in his "Tolkovyj slovar'" explains "gitsel'" as
"zhivodyor" (der shinder), which to me is a figurative meaning. Does anyone
know where this word comes from?
