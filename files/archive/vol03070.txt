Subject: Reyzl's analysis of non-jewish sukke decorations

Reyzl's analysis of the khasidic woman using non-jewish decorations
is interesting indeed.  However, I would like to raise one question.
If she, and khasidim, in general, realize the non-jewish
associations of these decorations (as they presumably would if it
says so clearly on the label), I think they would have to worry
about the implications regarding the doraysa iser on 'khukas ha
goyim.'  There is a big rabbinic responsa literature on the subject,
and its certainly not clear cut; so the decorations in question
might in fact be muter, but I would think that the question would be
raised and resolved, considerations of practicality and aesthetics
aside.

Meylekh.

Subject: Translation help needed

I have heard that this group specializes in Yiddish literature and
history. I am currently working on a dissertation involving the
Objectivist poet Charles Reznikoff, who was born of Russian
immigrant parents in 1894.  His parents worked in the garment
district in New York.  Among Reznikoff's papers is a lengthy
manuscript written by his father, Nathan, entirely in Yiddish. There
is a typescript manuscript accompanying it that we believe is a
translation/editing by Charles.  My work deals with a single page of
this Yiddish manuscript, and I am trying to find a way to get it
translated, so that I can compare the typescript with Nathan's
original manuscript to discover to what extent Charles reshaped the
typed version. The translating may be difficult, because it was
written such a long time ago, by someone who was probably not
well-educated.

The manuscript as a whole is extremely interesting and important, I
believe, because it is an autobiographical account of the father's
life starting from his childhood in a Russian village, and including
his emigration to New York and work in the garment trade.  The page
I am concerned with deals with a very emotional moment for Nathan,
when his own father and mother arrived from Russia, together with
their young daughter, some fourteen years after Nathan had left
Russia.  The manuscript itself is held in the Archive for New Poetry
at University of California, San Diego. Some of your members might
be interested in having a copy made for further research. There is
also a memoir written by Reznikoff's mother, in English, as she was
teaching herself to read and write English.  The family story of the
arrival of the grandparents was later incorporated into an
autobiographical poem written by Charles Reznikoff, who drew
extensively on his parents' accounts, constructing, in effect a
communal, family memory. I have published an article in the
Fall/Winter1992 issue of Sagetrieb on this subject.


If anyone is able to suggest a possible translator, or would like
more information about the Yiddish manuscript, I would be happy to
correspond via the email address below:

Subject: Hillel Halkin

Dear Ms. Halkin,

      It is interesting that you don't bother to refute the contents
of the message, just its source.  Like Zachary, my source also said
that Philologos is Hillel Halkin; but my source's original source
was not your deceased mother, o'ley'a hasholem.  Since your posting,
I have not only rechecked on the health of my source but have found
another, irrefutable one for the same info.  I assume that you have
been letting your brother read all the Mendele postings on
Philologos and Wexler. Now I won't bother sending Philologos copies
of them as I had planned to do.  You can assure him that the
Forwards is not giving out this information; but on the other hand,
it's as my mother said to me last month, "zolst visn, mayn kind, in
leybn zenen nishtu keyn soydes".   No one on Mendele or anywhere
else that I know of has ever pursued Philologos's identity until
now.   And no one would have pursued it had his soft-pedalled Wexler
write-up not involved someone who gave pseudonymity a bad name.  He
otherwise writes a very interesting column. With this I go back to
Khaim Bochner's advice --polite silence.

      On another note, does anyone know what plans are being
prepared for the Jerusalem One Yiddish News line?  Some one here got
excited about it when the news came out, ober men hert nisht un men
zet nisht zint demolt.  Is anyone considering posting any articles
or texts on there?

Reyzl

[The shames can help on that last question.  The Jerusalem One
Yiddish account was both a list and a personal account.  Faran
a posuk: adam asher lo yoda ben-yemino lismolo (vegn kompyuters
veysn zey nisht) ubehema rabba (a ferd farshteyt mer).  Di
untershte shura: the list is no longer in operation.]
