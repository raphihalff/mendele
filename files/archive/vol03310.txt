Subject: Linda Richmann

	Despite the annoying tendency of Saturday Night Live to repeat
programs half-way through the season, palming them off as "encore"
presentations, I enjoy Mike Meyers' "Coffee Talk" shtik.  For those who
are unfamiliar with it, he portrays a Jewish woman who hosts a
cable-access phone-in TV show where they talk about "daughters, dogs,
whatever, no big wup."  The comedy is formulaic, but as I progress in
Weinreich, I understand more of the Yiddish Meyers uses.  There is one
stock phrase, however that I cannot translate.  Linda Richmann is only
filling in for the regular host, who is out, undergoing medical treatment
for shpilkes af der ginekhte gezoynk.  Is this real Yiddish, or is it
glossalalia?  He uses Yiddish in other places that makes me think maybe
he isn't making it up. (For example, a caller  asked if any of Barbara
Streisand's houses burned in the (then) recent brush fires.  Linda
replied, "Halt dem Mund.  Di shvartse ponim hobm es shwer, un itzt brenn
di shtot."  Then got choked up, exclaiming, "I'm getting beklemt!")

Subject: Isaac Babel

Does anyone know if and when Isaac Babel's stories were translated into
Yiddish?  If so, were they read widely?

Subject: Introduction

Sholem Aleyekhem ! My name is Vadim Altskan. I'm working for US Holocaust
Memorial Museum.I graduated from Moscow University 3 years ago and came
to States  18 months ago. In Moscow I used to work for Jewish Historical
Society. Subject of my research is "History of Jews in Podolia" Actually
I was born in Proskurov in Podolia,  and as you know Podolia is
South-West part of the Ukraine. I'm fluent in Ukranian and of course in
Russian, and trying to learn Yiddish myself. Zayt gezunt.

Subject: Introduction

I've been lurking on Mendele for over a month so let me tell you some-
thing about myself.  I lived on Chicago's West Side, the largest Jewish
neighborhood, for 20 of my first 30 years finally leaving there in 1950.
The community's adults were almost all bilingual, English and Yiddish.
Some spoke more than the two languages.

I learnt most of my Yiddish in Talmud Torah, translating Chumash from
Hebrew to Yiddish.  Some Hebrew grammar was taught but I think we were
too young to be much helped by it.  Most of my adolescent friends learnt
their Yiddish either at Workmen's Circle or Poale Zion schools.

I subscribe to one Yiddish magazine but still feel uncertain in my read-
ing.  I need a good beginning Yiddish text.  Any suggestions?

Subject: Wanted-Tapes of Yiddish language radio shows

Having a sub to the Yiddish Forvarts, I have seen ads for Yiddish shows
on WEVD. If anyone out there, in the New York area, is familiar with
these broadcasts, please give me a schedule. I'm interested in shows
where the broadcast language is Yiddish, not shows about Yiddish or about
Yiddish music. Also, news programs in Yiddish would really be exciting.
Ultimately, I'd like to have tapes made of these shows to develop my
listening skills and would send the tapes and postage to anyone who could
do this for me. Also, if Mendelniks are aware of shows of this type in
other cities or towns please inform me or the Mendele network as a whole.
Blank cassette tapes and postage are cheap, but living, spoken Yiddish is
at a premium, even in Yiddish groups (in mine, much to my regret, over
50% of the conversation is in English).

Subject: Ver zogt az yidn kenen nor leynen?

To all of you who responded privately to my posting of Dzhankoye, a
hartsikn dank and a half!

However, my intention was not to merely post the lyrics of this quite
well known song, but to pass along the song in the format I received it:
as a printout of a file in a (music?) program called Qbasic. I offered it
as something Qbasic users might run and hear (?) the song (and read the
lyrics?), as well something that might tickle the Fonye bone of other
readers. This all important detail of my post, which might have provided
a bit more context to what otherwise was a jumble of characters on the
screen, was apparently mistakenly omitted by me, or by Reb Mendele (a
lebn em in di beyner!) somewhere in the depths of the redaktsye process.

And then there's Grandma's cream extractor, as Blumke Kirshenboym points
out, also glaringly absent from this version of the song. . . That's what
you get with Qbasic. . . Ver darf zukhn naye glikn. . . ?

Meyshe Alpert

(A red-faced shames promises an unredacted version.)

Subject: A Table of Contents for Mendele

Bob Rothstein to the rescue!  Mendelniks and Mendelnitses are once again
indebted to him, this time for comipiling a complete table of contents
to Mendele.  It is available on request.

Please write to: nmiller@starbase.trincoll.edu

There's something sobering about an archived table of contents.  We
suddenly realize that our every cough and wink may be scrutinized by one
of our no-nonsense children as years from now they peg away  at disser-
tations and studies of the rebirth (alevay Gotenyu) of Yiddish in
America.

If for no other reason, may this also serve as a reminder to writers that
a _usable_ subject line, one that contains information, makes a difference.
If Bob has gone to all this trouble, surely the rest of us can do better
than "various" or "farshidns".  That applies to my own subject lines
which I now repent.
