Subject: Ashkenaz

[see 6.285]

Not to be too contentious about it, but perhaps knowledge of the
coterritorial languages of the countries and regions where Ashkenazic
Jews have resided over the centuries should also be a prerequisite for
a scholarly research on topics subsumed under "Ashkenaz."

Subject: Nibl-pe

In Mendele 6.287 Dovid Braun asks concerning "nivl pe" in Tsansin's
dictionary: "Is the word unequivocally spelled with a veys and not a
beys there?"

I have just looked again. It _is_ a veys, that is to say the second
letter of the alphabet with a little horizontal line over it.

Subject: A lost line from Y.L. Peretz

The quote Paul Miller [6.287] is looking for may be found in the
_Haggadah for a Secular Selebration of Pesach_,  pp. 20-21 (5th
edition,1993) published by the Sholem Aleichem Club of Philadelphia
and available from them at P.O. Box 27648, Philadelphia, PA 19150.
Unfortunately they do not cite the provenance of the Peretz quote in
the hagode, but I know some of them are Mendelyaner and surely would
be able to provide it on request.

Subject: The cause of misreading "laib" for "leyb"

Liebe Denner's query (6.281) about "Layb-Leyb" promptly elicited
several replies (6.282 and 6.293).  All were interesting and to the
point.

However, none indicated the cause of the misreading, and such
explanation may serve to prevent misreadings in the future when the
tsvey yudn [two yuds] are similarly positioned.

The names of these letters are: 1) Tsvey yudn;  and 2) _Pasekh_ tsvey
yudn.

When the  two  contiguous  tsvey  yudn  denote  the  diphthong /ey/,
they do not take the Hebrew vowel sign  called _tseyre_, a colon
placed horizontally, like this [. .], because it would look as if each
yud, individually, had a _khirek [dot] under it and are therefore not
conjoined into one.

But when the tsvey yudn denote the diphthong /ay/ they take the
diacritic _pasekh_ under them to signify their conjointness.

Thus we clearly distinguish the Yiddish homonymic words spelled alike
but with different meanings in the following two lines:

Tsvey yudn [ey] -- eyl, (kh')meyn, (kh')ney, sheyn, (kh')veyn, and
other such words;

Pasekh tsvey yudn [ay] -- (kh')ayl (zikh), mayn, nay, shayn, vayn, and
so on.

This is written from the viewpoint (or earpoint, if you will) of a
litvishn (Lithuanian) dialect.  Other dialects may complicate matters.
And our good friend Mikhl Herzog will  cedrtainly help us out.

Subject: The plural of "hon"

Mendy Fliegler wrote (6.233,3): "Mayn mishpokhe hot gehat a farm in
New Jersey, un mir hobn gehat a sakh yidishe shkheynim [neighbors],
mit a sakh hiner un vintsige [few] honer."

(If memory serves, the instructor of my undergraduate course in Animal
Psychology, who happened to be from the U .K., taught us that
exhaustive studies established conclusively that there is  no honour
among honer...)

For the correct plural of "hon," see glossary below:

    1.  Hon (rooster), plural hEner (also honeN);

    2.  Fon (flag), plural fener (also fonen);

    3.  Man (male), plural mener;

    4.  Man (husband), plural mener, also manen;

    5.  Of (from Hebrew ayen, khoylem vov, lange-fey) fowl;

    6.  Eyfele (diminutive from Yiddish "of"), a reference to he
        helplessness of a tiny human baby;

    7.  Hindl (diminutive from "hun"), a scrawny chicken, just
        "hoyt un beyner" [skin and bones];

    8.  Hinde (female given name), Hindl (its diminutive and
        endearing form);

    9.  Mindl (diminutive and endearing form from Mi'ne);

   10.  Zundele, also Zindele (diminutive and endearing forms
        from zun [son];

   11.  Gezind (family),  as in Avrohom Reyzn's famous song "A
        gezind zalbe akht;"

   12.  Gezindl (neither diminutive, nor endearing), a pejorative
        reference to an organized mob or, in contemporary terms, a
        gang.

Subject: Stempenyu in English

I'm looking for an English translation of "Stempenyu" by Sholom
Aleichem. Does anyone on the newsgroup list know of a source?

Any ideas are appreciated.

Thanks.
