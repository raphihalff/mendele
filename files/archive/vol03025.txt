Subject: translation job

I've just been in touch with someone in the Boston area who's
looking for a Yiddish to English translator. He's got 300 pages of
letters from his grandfather to his father, written between 1921 &
1941. The sample I saw was in difficult (very cursive) but legible
handwriting. The style is the educated "daytshmerish" of the time;
the sort of style where I end up using a German dictionary more than
the Yiddish ones.

I turned down the job because I don't have time to take on a job
that large. Even 30 pages would take a long time :-(, and he wants
the entire collection translated. He's willing to pay, although I'm
not sure he's realistic about how much it will cost: he was clearly
taken aback by my suggestion of $15/page. (By the way, in this case
what I mean by page is one side of a legal-sized sheet.)

If anyone's interested in pursuing this, let me know, and I'll put
you in touch with the owner of the letters.

Also, I'd be interested in getting some idea of what other people
charge for translation work. $15/page sounds high to the customer,
but it's low compared to what I make as a programmer. Maybe I'm just
a slow translator?

Subject: funem yarid

Dovid Braun suggested in (3.014) that I was finding Sholem
Aleykhem's "Funem Yarid" dull because he (S.A.) didn't live long
enough to revise it. Well, I suspect he might have shortened the
early childhood chapters if he had lived long enough!

I've finished the second volume now, and I can report that I liked
it much better than the first. But there hasn't been a outpouring of
interest in talking about this book, so I won't go on.

Would anyone else care to suggest a topic for literary discussion?
I'm open to suggestions as to what I might read next ...

Subject: Noah Pandre

Someone recently asked whether there was a novel called Noah Pandre.
The answer is that the Yiddish-Hebrew writer Zalman Shneour wrote a
novel called Ha-Dod Zyame, a sequel to his Anshei Shklov.  The hero
of the sequel is Noah Pandre, a Jew who fights back.  These books
were published in the late 40's.  In the early 50's, when Shneour
moved to Israel, he made the latter story into a play that he called
Pandrei ha-Gibbor.  If I'm not mistaken, the sequel was translated
into English as Noah Pandre.

I know how difficult it is to interpret silence, but should I
understand the lack of response to my question of whether anyone is
teaching Yiddish literature outside of specific Yiddish literature
courses to mean that no one is?  That would be a shame.  The
literature deserves to be taught.

Subject: toytn bankes

        I think the correct syntax is "toytn" is in the dative,
i.e., it would help as much as "cupping" (=bankes) would help a dead
man. Anyone else encountered a "frozen", archaic dative that looks
like this?

        A propos the other shprikhvort, dimly, I remember: he should
be like a X? lamp, hang, burn, stink and people should makhen a
brokho over him. X cannot be shabbes, but what the adjective should
be, I can't remember.

Subject: Learning Yiddish

Diane:

  I'm sure that you'll get many suggesstions, but I was in a similar
position as you are. The books that I used to rejuvenate me Yiddish
were:

     1. College Yiddish (Weinreich)
     2. Learning Yiddish in Easy stages (Zuckerman & Herbst)
     3. Modern English-Yiddish/Yiddish-English Dictionary (Weinreich)

  I would start with #2. Weinreich's dictionary is a MUST! All of
these are available at the National Yiddish Book Center or the
Workman's Circle bookstore.

  Good luck.  Keep in touch, I'd like to hear how you're doing.
