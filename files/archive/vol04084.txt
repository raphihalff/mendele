Such reading groups already meet in Toronto and Boston.  I think we should
have one in New York.   This group will probably meet monthly.

Subject: YIVO-standard pronunciation

Rick Gildemeister (4.077) recalls that there have been criticisms of
YIVO's "standard" pronunciation, based in part at any rate on the
decision to make a minority pronunciation the basis for the standard;
more native speakers, writes Rick, would say "meshige" than would say
"meshuge".  Indeed, Solomon Birnbaum (in _Yiddish: A Survey and a
Grammar_, U. of Toronto Press, 1979) estimated that in the 1920's-30's,
there were 8.649 million speakers of what he calls the Southern [meshige]
dialect of Eastern Yiddish, and only 3.226 million Northern [meshuge]
speakers.  I have no idea how far to trust his specific estimates, and I
know that the dichotomy is a simplification, but I assume that he and
Rick are at least approximately correct.  (Incidentally, Birnbaum says
that the three _klasikers_ were all Southern speakers, Perets and Sholem
Aleykhem having been southern-born, and Mendele having adopted the
Southern dialect after moving south in his youth.)

I'm one of those who think that having a standard serves a good purpose.
And I am personally delighted at YIVO's choice; my parents and most of my
relatives of their generation came from around Vilna, so that the
pronunciation I grew up with is close enough as makes no difference to
the standard.  But how did the standardizers *justify* their choice?
Birnbaum writes:  "The original proponents of this 'standard' were
speakers of the Northern dialect and so, without further ado and without
discussing the matter or giving any reasons, they decided that their own
pronunciation was the 'standard.' ... It is ironic that the partisans of
the 'standard'--all convinced democrats--should ask the majority of
Yiddish-speakers to switch over from their own pronunciation to that of a
minority, comprising only a quarter of all Yiddish speakers." [p. 100]

Did the YIVOnikes really base their decision on such a parochial basis,
and did they really give no reasons?  There must have been a heated
contemporary debate ("discussing the matter") around what was obviously
seen by many as arrogance on the part of YIVO.  Can someone familiar with
the history of the standardization provide some details?

Subject: Bernstein's proverb collection

This and the next forwarded message seem to have gotten lost after being
sent on August 4, so I'm sending them again.

The best edition of Ignaz Bernstein's _Yidishe shprikhverter un
rednsartn_ was published 25 years ago in Germany:  Ignaz Bernstein,
_Juedische Sprichwoerter und Redensarten_, ed. Hans Peter Althaus,
Hildesheim:  Georg Olms Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1969.  This edition is a
reprint of the 1908 Warsaw edition with its facing pages of text in
Yiddish and in a German- based transcription.  Althaus also included
Bernstein's collection of "oysgelasene un grobe shprikhverter" ("Erotica
und Rustica") and added an introduction and an extensive bibliography.
This edition also reproduces the index and glossary of the 1908 edition.

Subject: Children's songs

Two answers to Paula Teitelbaum's inquiry about the composers of some
Yiddish children's songs:

	1. In their 1974 book _Perl fun der yidisher poezye_ (p. 198)
Yosl and Khane Mlotek identify the composer of the music to Yehoash's
"Kumt a foygl tsu mayn shoyb" as S. Golub.

	2. In _Unzer gezang:  lider zamlung far der yidisher shul_
(Montreal:  Yidishe folks shuln, 1929) Y. Zaslavsky is listed (in the
table of contents) as the composer of the music to the same poet's "Dos
lid fun der frosh."
