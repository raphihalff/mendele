Subject: The Freedman Archives

I had the privilege of visiting the Freedmans in Philadelphia and seeing
a bit of his amazing Yiddish music archive.  I cannot begin to relate how
exciting it is to see.  Welcome to the Mendele community Bob and Molly!

Subject: Romanization

Charles Jones asks in the latest issue of Mendele (Vol 4.105) about the
romanization of Yiddish and Hebrew in Libraries and according to the
"Yivo system."

He asks why the Yiddish "mekhaber" is spelled by major libraries as
"mehaber" with the a dot under the h.  He questions whether this is not
an authentic romanization system given its wide use.  The answer is
unequivically that the word mekhaber should NOT properly be romanized
with the h-dot.  In Hebrew the latter word should be written with h. but
in Yiddish--never.

The reason why is that Hebrew is a Semitic language and Yiddish is an
Indo-european Germanic language.  Hebrew like Arabic, possesses a
distinctly Semitic consonant which sounds like a heavily aspirated h.
Although largely dead in modern Hebrew spoken use the sound continues to
be written in Hebrew with the letter h.eth.  It is certainly still
pronounced in Arabic.

Yiddish is not a Semitic language and its phonology is Indo-european.  In
modern Yiddish words of semitic origin such as mekhaber the h.eth is
articulated as khes.  Thus the khes is identical to the kh sound in the
Germanic-Yiddish word gerekht (right). Although Yiddish (excluding
Soviet-Yiddish orthography) writes words according to their Spelling in
the Semitic stock language (Hebrew, Aramaic), no Yiddish speaker
pronounces Beth-'olam, but rather Beys-oylem, and it is inappropriate to
transliterate the Yiddish word according to the reconstructed
pronunciation norms of the Hebrew of the Masorites who standardized
Hebrew pronunciation of religious texts hundreds of years ago.  No one
would suggest that when transliterating English to the Cyrillic alphabet
that we transliterate flower according to the norms of the root French
fleur--it would be absurd.

Without question, the YIVO guidelines do immeasurably more justice to
Yiddish pronunciation than do the guidelines noted by Mr. Jones.  The
system which he mentions perpetuates the idea that Yiddish is a jargon to
be broken down etymologically rather than to be taken as a fused unity.

This having been said, di gantse toyre is nokh nisht oysgeshept gevorn:
It is not always clear how to romanize the Semitic component of Yiddish:
adayem/adayom/ad-ha-yom?   What if a book has a title in Hebrew--ie. the
Loshn-koydesh title is not part of general spoken Yiddish?  E.g. a book
titled ma'amaqim (to use Hebrew orthography).  I recently saw a book thus
titled.  If I have vocalized the title correctly I may now pose the
question, how should one transcribe this?  In Ashkenazic whole Hebrew,
the title would be vocalized maamakim.  But in Yiddish, to look at the
example of Hebrew ma'ariv, the two a's fuse into the dipthong ay, thus
maymakim.  Thus we face the question, should we transliterate maymakim or
maamakim or maamakem, etc.?  In view of these spelling difficulties, the
idea of spelling the Semitic component according to Hebrew romanization
standards is suddenly attractive.  On the  other hand, davenen ma'ariv
verses mayrev leaves a Yiddish speaker with a bad taste in his/her mouth.

Subject: Macaronisms

Evelyn Feins asked (4.104) about the term "macaronisms."  That term, or
its related adjective "macaronic," is used to refer to texts containing a
mixture of languages.  (It is apparently derived from an Italian dialect
word related to "macaroni," and was used to suggest the random arrangement
of pieces of macaroni on a plate.)  The term was first used in connection
with writers in various European vernacular languages who peppered their
texts with Latin words and expressions, presumably to show off their
erudition.  I used the term in an earlier posting to Mendele to refer to
what are known in the Yiddish linguistic/folkloric tradition as _mish-
shprakhike lider_.  It is clear, however, that Yiddish mixed-language
songs are often highly structured and bear no resemblance to macaroni on
a plate.
