Subject: Dictionaries

	Here is some information about dictionaries of
the Semitic component in Yiddish.

1. Yehoash and Dr. Khaim Spivak (S. Bloomgarden
and Dr. C. D. Spivak), Yidish verterbukh.  New York:
Veker, 1926.  340 pp.

2. Nakhman Krupin, Hantbukh fur hebreizmen in der
yidisher shprakh.  Buenos Aires:  IKUF, 1957.  256 pp.

3. Yankev Levin, Verterbikhl fun hebreish-yidishe
verter. New York:  Cyco Froyen Centrale [their
transliteration], 1958.  103 pp.

The Yehoash-Spivak dictionary is the most useful.
Despite its title it is a dictionary of semiticisms,
not a general Yiddish dictionary. Almost half of
Krupin's dictionary is taken up with a separate listing
of examples from literature.

The late Wolf Younin also published a "Kurtser
verterbukh fun hebreishe verter in yidish" in
installments in the _Forverts_ in 1978. He was
apparently planning to publish it in book form with
additional notes and bibliography.  I wonder whether he
had a literary executor and whether someone might be
interested in reviving his publication plans.

Nu. so what should I say besides: Ich bin a yid. I am
an engineer/physicist who now does policy work for the
Ministry of ENvironnment and Energy in the province of
Ontario. And I am a graduate of the Midrasha L'Morim in
TOronto (which along with fifty cents won't even get me
a cup of coffee anymore). I have a great love for
Yiddish humour instilled in me by me grandfather and I
know what's green, hangs on the wall, and whistles, as
well as the difference between Minsk and Pinsk.  SO do
I get in?

Subject: Yiddish theater/show/camp?

Hi Mane liebe mentche! -- My parents are coming from
Brazil for a visit, and I would like to take them to
see a play, or a show, or even to spend sometime in a
camp (something like the KlezKamp of YIVO which I
loved, last Chanukah). Does anybody know anything about
something going on in the East Coast? I live close to
Washington DC and would not mind travelling somewhere
with them for a few days. They will with me from
Memorial Weekend to the end of June. My Mom and Dad are
vibrant seventies and eighties. THey are really well
for their ages and love people, going places, etc.,
Baruch Ashem.

Thank you in advance for any recommendation, address,
phone # which I might contact for reservation,
informations, etc. Far Simches und Naches!

Subject: Skirt (noun)

When we first got married, my wife (who is the native
Yiddish speaker in our family) swore up & down that the
Yiddish word was "skoyt".  I finally convinced her
otherwise, and we settled on "rok" (which seems to be
what her parents use, but I haven't checked lately).
It's identical to the modern German "Rock".

Subject:      Skirt (noun)

In response to Annette Safer question, the yiddish word
for skirt would be ASPUDNICHE, and I think it's from
polish origin.
