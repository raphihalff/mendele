I emerge from seclusion, briefly, to recommend to one and
all the book by James A. Matisoff "Blessings, Curses, Hopes,
and Fears: Psycho-Ostensive Expressions in Yiddish". ISHI,
Phil. 1979. Jim is a Professor of Linguistics at Berkely,
fluent in Yiddish and Lahu, writing a Lahu Dictionary in
which he uses Yiddish as a source/model for innovation, The
book has received far less attent ion than it deserves and
will be of interest  in the context of Mendele's most recent
concern. A gut un gezunt yor to all. I resubmerge. MH.
