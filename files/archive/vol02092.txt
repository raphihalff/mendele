3. Host aym inergets gezeyn?

I hope this is of some use.

Subject: Poylen & Galitsye

(Regarding Leonard Prager's post (Mendele 2.88):)

 

I find this a little confusing. The part of Galitsye
between Kruke, Sosnovtse and Rozvadov is W Galitsye (where
the boundary with kongrespoylen includes part of the Vaysel
(R. Vistula). Belzer khsidim and Tchortkver khsidim lived
mainly in Ost Galitsye.

As far as dress is concerned I presume the writer is
referring to weekday clothing. The shtramel  (a cap trimmed
with fur tails)  is the shabbes headgear worn throughout
Galitsye; in kongrespoylen the shtramel (a) was designed
differently being fashioned from a single beaver fur (b)
worn by khsidim only (c) rarely seen on the street. The
vochedige headgear of the galitsyaner was a pale fur hat
(at least in winter - I don't know about the summer) called
a kolpek. I have been told that it fell into disuse after
the first World War.

The description of the payes is surely correct. In
kongrespoylen the payes were tucked under the hat and not
worn loose.

(I was born in England and have never been to any part of
Poylen - so none of this is first hand.)

Subject: Mood in Yiddish

A student here in Osnabrueck thinks of writing his
Ph.D.-dissertation on mood in Yiddish (esp. conjunctive and
conditional), and I want to encourage him to do so. Here's
my/our query: If anybody knows of related studies on
Yiddish or has bibliographic information of interest,
please let me know. I'll pass it on. Although there is (as
you know) an immense bibliography on tense, aspect, and
mood in general, there doesn't seem to be very much on
Yiddish in particular (at least to my knowledge). So,
please help!

Thanks in advance,

Martin Haase   mhaase@dosuni1.bitnet

Subject: Shoin Yidish bim computer!

Ich ken nit bliben az s'iz efsher tzo shriben a yidishe
brive ein'm Brown Unive rsity Computer Center!  Vos nokh, a
studente fun Oregon vos lernst yidishe? It seems to be all
true.

I am a senior at Brown University with a passion for Yid
dish.  I grew up in Eugene, Oregon (un ya, mir hobn a bisl
Yidish oich dortn!) hearing kine verter nisht.  My journey
into the Yiddish world began only two su mmers ago, when I
interned at the Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, MA.  Since
th en I have been studying wherever I can:  with a
Providence-resident, a Brown pr ofessor, and, luckily, in
both Israel and Oxford.  I attended the Oxford progra m
this summer and sat in on a Yiddish class at the Hebrew
University in Jerusal em during a "semesters leave" this
spring.

Currently, I am using my Yiddish to do research for a
senior thesis for Brown's history department, on the
ethnogr aphic expedition of Solomon Rappoport (better
known as An-sky) in the nineteen- teens.  I am attempting
to piece together the intellectual history which places
this expedition in some context, and thus am working
largely inter-disciplinar ily, reaching into the fields of
folklore, literature, ethnography and history. If any one
has advise on this topic, I would certainly welcome it
with open arm s: it is not exactly a thoroughly researched
one!

I am also beginning to teach a hour a week Yiddish course
through a community education program sponsored b y
Brown's Hillel--though I claim to be no adequate
replacement for the much nee ded Yiddish scholar Brown
ought to recruit.  I am hoping to continue with Yiddi sh
Studies when I graduate, and am currently investigating
graduate schools wit h related offerings.  Certainly I
will write more when I am certain there is re ally an
audience receiving this, it is only with shyness that I
can fuse my pas sion for Yiddish and my access to such
sophisticated means of communication.

I close with a question: is there anything written  about
the history of illustra ted Yiddish books?  I have zammled
a small collection of such works from the 19 20s and 30s
but know frightfully little about them. A shaynum dank-
