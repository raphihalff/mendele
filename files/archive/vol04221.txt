Gershon Margolis:

"a kleyne velt". I, too, am a Canadian who lived in LA in the early 50's
and, get this, performed in a dance pantomime of Peretz's "Zibn gute yor"
directed by ????? a colleague of Benjamin Zemach. Could his name have
been Nathan Vizonsky?  Would you or your parents know?

Subject: Ohser among the Yekes

Michael Shimshoni mentioned the term "ohser", which I would prefer
to spell "osser". It is one of a long list of words german jews,
though refraining and rejecting yiddish, still used in their german.
I can remember the way my grandmother used it, when she thought the
talk would harm the children: "Osser, die Kinder..." - meaning, this
is forbidden to talk as long as the children stay in the room. In
another context it would come as "osser-khaser". I am quite sure it
stems the hebrew word "assur" (= forbidden).

Subject: ohser

"Ohser" does ring a bell.

Apparently among maskilim there was a strong habit to quote Friedrich
Schiller, especially from _Don Carlos_ "Geben sie Gedankenfreiheit, o Sir"
(Give us freedom of thought, oh Sir).  This latter quotation seems to
have been so popular that is developed a short form "Oser zogt Schiller"
which was further shortened to just "oser".  These two forms were probably
not used by maskilim, but in a rather ironical way by their adversaries.

If this be true -- and for the life of me I can't remember where I think
I read that -- "oser" has a rather bizarre etymology:  An English phrase
made its way into Yiddish via the quotation of a German author and it's
ironical contraction.

Subject: Western Yiddish term in Swedish

Michael Shimshoni recently asked for responses on how far east certain
Western Yiddish terms have spread.  Among other words he mentioned was
"something like barshes" for khale-bread ("challah" in English).  Swedish
has a word--in two variants--denoting a white bread, braided: *barkis*
is the general term, with the variant *bergis* used in the Stockholm
area.  This braided bread loaf is sold in most food stores, bakeries, and
markets, and is not generally perceived of as "Jewish" by Swedes.  The
first legal settlement of Jews in Sweden proper dates to the late
eighteenth century; they were WY speakers from Mecklenburg.

Subject: Barches

This is again a yiddish term preserved in the colloqual german of the
yekes. My father used it always instead of "khala". But imagine my
surprise strolling once in the medieval town of Rothenburg ob der Tauber
and discovering in a bakershop in the main street, not far from the
Judengasse, a bread with the sign reading "BERCHES". The jewish name of
this bread remained though the jews disappeared. This is course the case
with about 300-400 original hebrew words, which found the way to the
german language, either through the Yiddish or the Rotwelsch or both.

Subject: berhkes/barkhes

Michael Shimshoni:

Volume I of the Yiddish Atlas has a map which displays the distribution
of "berkhes/barkhes" (abstracting from the variants of the medial
consonant). It occupies the entire area west of the Polish-German border
plus the Transcarpathian area in the South. Volume III will present it
again in greater detail, in conjunction with maps of "d/ta:tsher",
"khale", and other words for the Sabbath loaf (koyletsh, shtritsl,
kitke).

The Hebrew phrase you cite is the usual one offered in explanation, but
note: While the vowels of "berkhes"/"barkhes" are easily derived from the
"i" vowel of "birkat"--lowering before "r" is the rule--not so the
consonant. It's easier to derive the consonant from the construct plural
"birxos" (birxot). Would you agree? Furthermore, I think the earliest
documentary record is actually spelled "birkhoskukhn".

As for "d/ta:tsher", "taashir" is a reasonable source, given the usual
neutralizations that take place in the small area of its distribution in
western Germany (where, for example, we also find the merger of "dales"
'poverty' and "tales" 'prayer shawl'. Sorry, we're not finished yet.
"Some" say that "berkhes" AND "khale", both BRAIDED loaves, however much
they "sound like"/"look like" they're of Hebrew origin, REALLY derive
from the names of the braided-haired Teutonic goddesses, Berchta and Frau
Holle (note also the Western Yiddish naming ceremony "holekra:sh",
presumably from "Holle" and "kreischen" 'shriek'. I don't have the
reference at hand but Max Weinreich has an article on "holekra:sh").

I won't go on.
