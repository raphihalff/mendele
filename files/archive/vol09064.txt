Subject: Jabberwocky

In response to Itsik Goldenberg's request for a Yiddish version of
"Jabberwocky" (Vol 09.059) khaver Rafoyl Finkl had his scintillatingly
"brillig" rendition published in the February 1976 edition of _Yugntruf_.  
I suspect it may be a copyrighted work and thus would hesitate to set forth
the entire poem.  But on the premise that it's o.k. to quote briefly from
protected material - here is Finkel's effulgent Yiddish restatement of Lewis
Carroll's first stanza [my transliteration]:

YAMERVAKHETS

S'iz brilik geven, di shlikhtinke toves
Hobn gevirt un gevimlt in vabn.
Gants mimzishe geven di borogoves;
Di mame ret hot oysgegrobn.

In response to Itsik Goldenberg's query -- if you go to
http://www76pair.com/keithlim/jabberwocky/translations/index.html you will
find Raphael Finkel's Yiddish translation in a GIF which prints out very
well.  For your collection you will also find many other translations
including Hebrew, Klingon and koine Greek.

Enjoy!

In response to Itsik Goldenberg's inquiry about a Yiddish version of
Jabberwocky:

Funny you should ask that. "Yomervokhets" is a favorite of mine. Raphael
Finkel's translation in alef-beys may be found at
http://www.cs.engr.uky.edu/~raphael/yiddish/jabber.html

You might also find http://www76.pair.com/keithlim/jabberwocky/translations
interesting. Translations of this poem in many languages.

Subject: right to ask a question

In taking exception to any statement made by a contributor to Mendele I
would normally write to such person off the list.  However, the anger and
scorn displayed publicly by Professor Wolitz toward Marjorie Shonhut Hirshan
requires, I believe, a public reply.

The professor's anger is raised by Ms Hirshan's question if Professor Wisse
is entitled to express an opinion.  Note here Ms. Hirshan asks a question
(albeit with the possible answer being in the negative) but only a question.

Professor Wolitz defends Professor Wisse's right to express any opinion
she chooses.  Does not Ms. Hirshan have at least the right to ask a
question?  The very action Wolitz condemns he is guilty of doing himself.

Subject: Is this "Freedom of Speech" valid?

I have no access to the article by Prof. Wisse that raised much ire on
Mendele. However, having read news items concerning Prof. Wisse's opinions
over the years, I am not at all surprised.

It is not my purpose to question Prof. Wisse's competence to be an academic.  
All I know of her activities is that a graduate student of hers, while she
was at Mc Gill University, Aaron Lansky, has done a stupendous service to
Yiddish literature by having created and is still leading a movement that
rescued hundreds of thousands of Yiddish books from destruction and built an
imposing center in Amherst, Mass. for the study of and spread of interest in
the literature of the Ashkenazi culture.

My question concerns Professor Wolitz's defense of Wisse's right to use
"academic freedom" to spew forth whatever is on her mind, regardless of its
potential impact on her students, her position or her professional
colleagues. It smacks of the tactics of those extremists who use the
protective blanket of the First Amendment to protect their right against the
rights of those they are defaming.

Does Prof. Wisse have the right to denigrate the name of the chair she
occupies, the Peretz Professorship?  Peretz, after all, was the first
literary figure to put his pen at the service of the feminist movement in
any of the Western literatures with which I am familiar and, I suspect, in
world literature.  His "A Kass fun a Yiddeneh" is a devastating exposure on
the state of women in Ashkenazi society.

Does Professor Wolitz think that Wisse will stimulate many of her graduate
students to become Aaron Lanskys with her negative position on the viability
of Yiddish?  Is her purpose as Peretz Professor of Yiddish Literature to
make it part of Harvard's Classics studies instead of being independent or
part of Germanic studies?

I don't think so.

Subject: Fir kashes vegn a shayle vegn Ruth Wisse

Di ershte kashe iz: 
Why would the Gale Chair of Jewish Studies be "astonished" and wish to
stifle or censor the knowledgeable, democratic, open-minded shames of
Mendele for posting this shayle regarding responsibility? 

Iosif Vaisman is certainly, at least, on a par with, if not a tad above
"Wisse ....one of the most articulate members of the Jewish diasporic
community" - for our venerable shames welcomes and allows the exchange and
gloriously free expression of meyisheve Yiddish-lovers, scholars, teachers,
learners, linguists, translators, writers, readers, speakers, hasidim,
orthodox, secularists, atheists, humanists, professors, un azoy vayter..

Di tsveyte kashe iz:
If a professor expresses an opinion unrelated to her field of expertise,
should she not responsibly distance herself and her statement from the
Peretz Chair she holds?

In this instance, a Professor whose Chair bears the name Peretz made an
opinionated statement which did not deal with Jewish studies, with Peretz's
name fluttering on a banner overhead. Did this implicate him as ally, or
sully his name? his idealism? his compassionate, uplifting politics? might
we call this irresponsisbility? 

Di drite kashe iz:
In the year 2000, would Wisse assign all women to bow low their heads and
meekly ask for a warm roll when granted one final request? Would she have
all women turn into foot-stools for their husbands?

Di ferte kashe iz:
Doesn't disparaging feminism belittle all that we treasure in Yiddishkayt?
Isn't Yiddishkayt synonomous with mentshlekhkayt anymore?

Lastly, to the Gale Chair of Jewish Studies in Austin, I bequeath an old
axiom:

The difference between a prejudice and a commitment, is that you can voice
a commitment without hitting out in violent anger.

Subject: Test of Mendele's new home page

At Noyekh Miller's recent request (1/28/2000), I tried my version of AOL to
try out his suggested test for AOL users of Mendele's new home page at

http://www2.trincoll.edu/~mendele/index2r.htm

I was able to read the Yiddish because (apparently) I have the latest
version of AOL which is AOL 5.0.  This version uses (I believe) Internet
Explorer 5.  It may be that AOL users who can't use this new version of
Mendele's home page should upgrade to AOL 5.  It is free, either by
downloading (long, long time for download), or request (on line) a CD-ROM
disk by mail.  The new home page seems still to be under construction, but
it is very nice to see the yidishe oysyes appear on screen.
