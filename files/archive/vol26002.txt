Subject: shogn oder a shlafn

In 26.001, Martin Jacobs asks about "shlogn oder a shlafn."  This is the practice of bloodletting, or bleeding, to cure a sick patient, nominally to release demonsbring the humors back into balance/ etc. etc.  In the "Groyser verterbukh" is also to be found the synonym "lozn an o[der], lozn (shlogn) tsu der o[der] = aynshnaydn a vene un lozn oysrinen blut vi a heylmitl, ven men iz in hinerplet, ba a shlak-onfal, un stam peryodish vi a profilaktisher mitl."  Just a reminder that whenever there’s an important element of the phrase begining with an alef, it doesn’t hurt to check the Groysn Verterbukh!  And now that Refoyel Finkel has an OCR version on his site [https://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/yiddish/searchGroys.cgi], one can even check for usage on words not beginning with alef.

Subject: shogn oder a shlafn

Martin Jacobs asked [26.001] what "shlogn-oder a shlafn" means. "shlogn oder" or "shlogn tsu der oder" means to let blood (lit. strike the veins). "a shlafn" is the accusative masculine singular form of the adjective "shlaf", meaning "in a weakened state". "a shlafn" belongs to the entire last half of the sentence, and not just "shlogn-oder".

So the second half of the sentence would be translated as "applying cups and leeches, and even letting blood for a weak (sick) person". All three of these activities were thought to cure sickness, and particularly bad blood.

Subject: mitzvah

This is a response to the inquiry of Hershl Bershady [Vol. 26.001]. Although this incident definitely is an expression, however I am, as well as you, unaware of a clear Yiddish expression for it. I do know of an expression which I can assure to you was used by more learned people, and is used till today in Yeshiva circles, which is in fact an expression from the Talmud. Its validity into Yiddish (if you'd like) could be from the fact that Stutshkov brings this expression as well in his thesaurus. The expression is-"makhshove toyve, hamokem metsaref lemayse". That is, a positive thought (as in our incident, a thought to do a mitzvah) is attached to an action by G-d. In other words, G-d deems the positive will of wanting to act with a mitzvah as if the person actually did the action as desired (and is hence rewarded accordingly). But this expression is not used as you worded it-a mitzvah that hasn't been fulfilled, because then it could to an understanding that if someone decided to be lazy in the middle and didn't fulfill it will also get the same reward, but rather it's percisely what your friend had meant-that it was no longer possible for you to fulfill it because you were stopped and the like, and that's when this expression is used, so here is an expression for you.

Subject: lapn

In the 1908 song "Zumer bay nakht oyf di dekher," there is a phrase "a moyd vi a lapn" (to rhyme with "khapn" in the previous line.) The translation in the songbook gives "a sturdy girl" but it is not a literal translation. None of the dictionaries I consulted were helpful. Any suggestions on a precise translation in this context?
