Subject: RE: Acronyms

Another acronym:  Segal is 'Sgan Leviyim', that is,
'lieutenant of the Levites', I believe. Segals are usually
Leviyim.

Another oddity is that the name Dreyfus has two confluent
origins:

1.  Troyes [Rashi's town] = Treverus [Latin] => Dreyfuss.
        The Dreyfusses often claim to be Rashi's
        descendents.

2.  Shalosh Regalim [three pilgrimage festivals: Sukos,
        Peysekh, Shevues] => Dray Fuss [pun on Hebrew
        'Regel' = foot or pilgrimage festival or custom
        (the triple meaning explicit in the Kotsker nign)]
        => Dreyfuss.

Off the main point, but neat.

Subject: RE: Acronyms

A friend whose last name is Schub told me it's derived from
the initials of "SHoykhet U-Boydek" 'slaughterer and
inspector [of meat]'.  He also mentioned that the name
Brill ifrom "ben Rabbi Yom-Tov Lippmann".

Subject: ES

to those who have wondered about "es" and "dos": in mynativ
mameloshn "es" is like "it",or better still like the german
"es";e.g. "es felt mir wos" is identical with "es fehlt mir
was"litteraly translated "it's missing me something".
similarly, "dos" means "this",as e.g. "dos felt mir"
meaning "i am missing this".

Subject: Quebec and a query

I enjoyed very much Zachary Baker's article about Montreal
& Quebec (Mendele Vol. 2 no. 49).  However, I'm interested
in knowing how much Yiddish is still taught at the Montreal
day schools these days.  Are there any non-Hasidic children
still speaking and learning to read and write the language
there?  The article only says, "there are about two dozen
Jewish day schools in Montreal (a majority of Jewish
children and adolescents attend day schools), including the
Jewish People's and Peretz Schools and Bialik High School."

Is there any way to find IB Singer's children's stories in
the original Yiddish?
