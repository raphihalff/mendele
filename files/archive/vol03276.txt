Subject: ekel, feygl/faygl

picking up dan kirschers inquiry conc. 'eklet', yes, the same is
used in modern german 'es ekelt mir/mich'. but i would like to
contradict arre komar's classification of the word as "pure german"
- what does that mean? the word ekel is derived from the germanic
stem *aikla, i would therefore expect it to be present in some form
in other germanic languages (as it is manifested in yiddish!)

just as an aside, nazi-propaganda  caused later problems in the
usage of these same words (which before the 1930s had been neutral),
they had become, so to speak, tainted by ns-ideology.

the fact that hitler used the word 'ekelt' to express disgust is not
especially surprising, given that german was his native language -
and that he expressed anti-jewish sentiment from the word go doesn't
strike me as a revelation either.

so i guess my point is that i don't get your point.

conc. feygl/faygl (or mikhl herzogs back formations feyge/fayge) i
am pleased to be able to further confuse the issue: instead of a
bird, how about a fig? 'fayg' (dialectical variant 'feyg'?) sounds
plausible, too, espec. given the connection to 'faygnblat'. any
takers for this one?

Subject: ekl: recent citation

From the Forverts of March 4, 1994 (p. 22):  "in a rede far der
kneset hot premier rabin oysgedrikt ekl iber der shkhite in
khevron."  As others have pointed out, the word may have come
directly from contemporary German; Weinreich apparently considered
it daytshmerish.  The Forverts has not been noted for its avoidance
of unnecessary imports; its advertising still includes a section
labelled "klasifayd eds".  I recall seeing an account, years ago, of
demonstrations at the Forverts building (on East Broadway in NYC?)
by Yugntrufnikes carrying signs calling for "derekh-erets far
yidish."

Subject: Ansky exhibit in Europe?

I was told by someone that that there is to be an exhibit "somewhere
in europe" of recently recovered material from Ansky's ethnographic
expedition of 75 years ago.

-Does anyone have some information about this?

Subject: Brillnshlang

Dear Wise Persons of Mendele,

Brillnshlang in German is the equivalent of "four eyes"--a
pejorative for someone who wears glasses,particularly an
intellectual woman or bluestocking. In a strange and wonderful
Sutzkever story "A Shmeykhl in ek velt" it appears to be an
exotic--not to say grotesque, vaguely fishy delicacy. Yes, I fully
realize the multiple meanings. However, does the word in Yiddish
have the same taytch as in German?

Philologists, folklorists, critics, etc. --any answers?

Also to our beloved shames--a thousand pardons for forgetting the
subj.  Amol hot mayn moyekh nit ken koyekh.

[Un amol amol shteyt oyf der shames af der linker zayt..]

To Anatole Beck a hartsikn grus from me and from Barbara whom I see
at folk dancing.

Subject: "Nebbish"

I always believed that the word "nebbish" in Yinglish was just
nebekh, in the same way "toosh" is used for tokhes. Well, it's
probably a coincidence but nebekh in Mayrev-Yidish comes out as
nebish, the way some Germans pronounce Ich as Ish. Bay Yidn in
Daytshland zenen kinderlekh geven "kinderlish". There is a
distinction in that this "Ich-laut" doesn't "shush" as much as the
true "isch" but it sure is different than "kh".

Just a little footnote dangling eyninker aleyn. A shtikl funem
oytser fun mayrev-yidish.

Subject: Ashkenazik

To add another dimension to the issue of the name of my mother
tongue, I would say that the name  Yiddish  makes the same claim of
Jewish universality as  Jewish, only in our own speech.  I stand by
my memory that it was a kind of Zionist PC which propelled the name
into currency, and after all, most Yiddish-speakers in the 40s & 50s
were Zionists. In fact, any desire to specify accurately the scope
of our language would denote it as Ashkenazic or Ashkenazish, in
keeping with the community in which it was spoken.

I am interested in running down the question of whether Daitch was
ever widely used and a synonym for Yiddish.  There seems little
doubt that the source of Yiddish was the Rhenish of the 10th or 11th
Century.  It is more than possible that those who took the language
with them when they went to E. Europe thought they were speaking
German, notwithstanding the liberal use of certain Hebrew words.
The language antedates the strangling of formal German by the
scholastics who locked it into the Procrustian bed of Latin grammar,
and may in some sense be a more authentic German than is
Hochdeutsch.  I find the street German of Vienna & Prague closer to
Yiddish than to Goethe.

But I find no difficulty in designating myself as an Ashkenaz, which
I do sometimes on forms asking my cultural heritage for purposes of
pigeonholing me.  Let them figure it out themselves, I say.
