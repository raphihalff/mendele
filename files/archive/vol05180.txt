My shul, the Dix Hills Jewish Center, would like to establish a

Any suggestions?

Subject: Transcription (2)

Here are some more transcription-decoding questions I have to deal with
while translating this I.B.Singer biography (I mentioned it yesterday)
from Hebrew, and I hope someone will be able to answer.

-The name of the former editor of the Forwerts - was his name spelled as
Abe Cohen, Cahen, Cohn, etc? And maybe the first name isn't Abe at all,
but something like Yves?

-Is the name of the other Jewish newspaper 'Der Jiddische Wert' or '..
... Wort'? and if it is 'Wort', will 'Der' than become 'das' as it does
in German?

-The name Faingwirtz, is it spelled like this? What I need here is the
name of Singer's close aid Bessy Faingwirtz.

Thank you all,

Daniel Bugel

Subject: Bawdy Yiddish

Ethan Minovitz (5.179) brought up the subject of bawdy Yiddish.  How
about some literate person providing a little lexicon of vulgar Yiddish
expressions?

About thirty years ago, there was a book called _Loxfinger_ that was a
spoof of James Bond novels.  My father told me it was full of vulgar
Yiddish words, but he didn't tell me what they were.  (He was too
embarrassed.)  Can anyone enlighten me?

Subject: Got fun Avrom

I've thanked individually those who responded privately to my inquiry
about the text of "Got fun Avrom" and would now like to offer public
thanks to those who responded on Mendele.

Had I but world enough and time (to say nothing of the necessary
erudition), I would be tempted to embark on an analysis of the available
textual variants, of which I've now seen quite a few.  Perhaps someone
reading this lines will take up what could be an interesting contribution
to the study of religious folklore (or will suggest the topic to a
graduate student).

Just impressionistically, the "official" text (as printed in the
Artscroll Siddur and elsewhere) contains more words and phrases of Hebrew
origin and more theological language ("...az di vokh zol undz kumen tsu
emune shleyme..., tsu dveykes haboyre..., maamin tsu zayn bishloyshe
osher ikorim shelkho..." ["that the coming week may arrive to bring
perfect faith..., attachment to the Creator..., to have faith in Your
thirteen principles..."]). The folk variants tend to use a more limited
vocabulary of Hebrew origin (_mazl_, _koved_, _parnose_, _hatslokhe_
etc.).  In addition to ask for these blessings, they tend to ask that,
e.g., "di kranke fun dayn folk Yisroel zoln gezunt vern..., un di nakete
zoln bakleydt vern..." ("the sick among your people Israel become
healthy..., and the naked be clothed...").  They often mention the
Prophet Elijah and express hope or confidence in the imminent coming of
the Messiah, as in the lines borrowed from (shared with) the religious
folk song "Shnirele-perele" (referred to by David Herskovic in his
posting).

The way I've just formulated the differences raises another question
related to the ongoing discussion about different understandings of
_yidishkayt_.  It would be interesting to know about the extent to which
liturgical/biblical/talmudic semiticisms are and were part of the Yiddish
vocabulary of speakers who did not have yeshiva training.  The various
dictionaries of semiticisms in Yiddish, naturally enough, show only what
the compilers considered frequent enough in the literature.  They include
both everyday words and items that presumably were much less familiar.

Subject: Got fun Avrom

On March 10th of this year, my husband Yosl and I wrote in our column in
the Yiddish Forward about Reb Leyvi Yitskhok Berdichever's "Got fun
Avrom."  Here is a part of the article.

     A. Volf-Yasni writes in the Zhelechover Memorial Book that "the
     later rabbi, Reb Leyvi Yitskhok, came to Zhelechov in 1772 and
     exerted a strong influence on the spiritual education of the town.
     The sobriquet 'Zhelechover'  was hurled at the great Rabbi
     Leyvi-Yitskhok as an insult. 'Yitskhok the Zhelechover' the great
     rabbi of Brest and opponent of Hasidism, Rabbi Avrom Katsenelnboygn
     called him with sarcasm during his debate with Reb Leyvi-Yitskhok,
     who lived in Zhelechov from 1772 to 1784. His [Rabbi
     Leyvi-Yitskhok's] love for simple Jews is expressed in the 'God of
     Abraham' which he composed and which every Jewish woman understood
     and recited:  (Here follows Leyvi-Yitskhok's 'Got fun Avrom.') Dr.
     S. Horodetski who includes this 'Got fun Avrom' in his volume
     _Hakhasidmus vehakhasidim_ writes that Reb Leyvi-Yitskhok created
     this prayer while he lived in Berdichev.  The Jews of Zhelechov
     recall, however, that this 'Got fun Avrom' was always recited by
     their mothers and grandmothers.   One should therefore assume that
     Reb Leyvi-Yitskhok created the prayer while he still lived in
     Zhelechov, and brought it later to Berdichev and from there the 'Got
     fun Avrom' spread to Jewish communities in the Ukraine."

Noyakh Prilutsky defended the inclusion of the "Got fun Avrom" prayer as
a folksong, even citing a few that were in verse, against the criticism
of S. Ansky and others.

Subject: Hebrew terms in Yiddish

In my leyenkrayz the question came up about the existence of a book or
booklet which lists Hebrew terms which occur as part of Yiddish.  I
recall seeing such a book, or booklet, mentioned on Mendele, but I could
not find it in my index of tables of contents of Mendele.  I would
appreciate it very much if anyone could direct me to the proper reference
so that I may get the name of the author, etc.

Subject: Mordecai Rivesman

Mordecai Rivesman, (1868-1924), the author of "Khanike, oy, khanike", was
a Russian and Yiddish writer, translator, playwright, folk poet.  He was
a teacher in Vilna and later in the Society for the Dissemination of
Enlightenment in St. Petersburg, publishing humorous stories, fables and
plays in book form and in anthologies.  In the anthology _Lider-zamlbukh
far der yidisher shul un familye_ edited by Z. Kiselgoff, which was
published in 1911, the editor singled out Rivesman in his preface, not
only as a member of the Editorial Committee, but also for translating a
number of songs and for writing a few songs of his own for the
publication. There "Khanike, oy, khanike", based on a Hassidic tune, was
published for the first time.  It was reprinted in the _Anthology of
Yiddish Folksongs_, vol. 2 (1984), edited by A. Vinkovetzky, Abba Kovner
and Sinai Leichter.  The song was adapted in the Yiddish schools. (See
_Yomtevdike teg_ and _Lomir, kinder, zingen_).

For further information see _Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur_ ,
vol. 8, p. 446; also Albert Weisser, _The Modern Renaissance of Jewish
Music_.
