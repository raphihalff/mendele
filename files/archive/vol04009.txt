Subject: Fonye

An amusing sidelight on this impolite term for the Russian is that the
WWII Russian army slang (and probably WWI as well) for the Germans was
"Fony".  This of course is nothing more than the 'von' that was so common
in German last names.  I wonder if any Jewish soldier ever reflected that
he was fighting the "Fony" along side "Fonye".

Subject: vern-constructions

Thanks for your comments, Dovid.  I had noticed and mentioned those
inconsistencies in word order.  Still, it came up several times in a
relatively short list of Russian aspectual pairs, so there must have been
some reason behind these choices.  When I have more time, I'll check
some more aspectual pairs.

The change in word order is not the only way the compilers of the
Russian-Yiddish dictionary used to express aspectual differences, besides
prefixation.  Some of the glosses distinguished between a ZAYN vs. a VERN
construction, imperfective the former, pe rfective the latter.  Others
used VERN + Positive (shvakh vern, imp.) vs. VERN + comparative (shvakher
vern, perf.).  But again not completely consistent.

The explanations you gave for shift in focus, follows patterns in Yiddish
with regard to prefixation.  I noticed that the more the author is
interested in stressing a certain event in a story (i.e., the more 'in
focus' it is), the more the verb is marked, usually by prefixation.
Changes in word order then would be another way of doing that.

Salomon A. Birnbaum _Grammatik der Jiddischen Sprache_ has an appendix
containing lists of the most common eastern Yiddish first names, female
and male names being listed separately.  The names are given in Hebrew
characters.  I don't have the book with me, but I think no further
explanations or equivalents in other languages are given.

This may not be exactly what you are looking for, but maybe it helps.

Subject: Jewish/Yiddish names

There have been a number of queries regarding sources for first names
among Eastern European Jews.  Here are some suggestions:

Alexander Harkavy's "Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary," 2nd ed. (New
York:  Hebrew Publishing Co., 1928; reprinted by Schocken and YIVO,
1988), includes a section on Jewish names and their English equivalents
(pp. [525]-530).  His explanations are not 100% reliable and his list is
incomplete; nevertheless, it is the most widely available source that I
know of, on Yiddish forenames. Under "Zishe," for example (p. 527), there
is a cross-reference to "Zisye," whose "English" equivalent is given as
"Zissia," without any further glosses.  Another name that is close in
sound to Zishe and Zisye is "Zusye" ("English" equivalent:  Zussia; also
unglossed by Harkavy).  And then there is the masculine name "Zisl," an
apparent diminutive of "Ziskind" (since they are listed together by
Harkavy) -- "English" equivalents:  "Zissl" and "Zisskind." These are
glossed by Harkavy:  "Zisl un Ziskind vern tsugegebn tsu dem nomen
Aleksandr" -- i.e., they are associated with that name (but may not
actually derive from it).  Is it possible, then, that Zishe, Zisye and
Zusye are variants of the masculine Zisl?  The feminine name "Zisl" and
its variants "Zisle" and "Zise" are not glossed by Harkavy but are given
the following equivalents: "Zissl," "Zissla," "Zissa (Dulcia)."  The last
item does bear out the seemingly obvious connection of the feminine Zisl
with Yiddish "zis" (sweet).  Harkavy, however, distinguishes between the
masculine and feminine names without discussing whether they share a
common etymology.

"A Dictionary of Jewish Surnames from the Russian Empire," by Alexander
Beider (Teaneck, NJ:  Avotaynu, 1993), deals -- as its title indicates --
with surnames.  But since many of these are formed on the basis of
forenames this can be a useful source for explaining them.  Beider's
"Dictionary" is a work of prodigious scholarship (close to 800 pages of
very small print); it should be pointed out that Beider is not a Yiddish
specialist, and some of his glosses may be erroneous.  (I did not have a
chance to check his book for "Zishe," etc.)

"A Dictionary of Jewish Names and Their History," by Benzion C. Kaganoff
(New York:  Schocken Books, 1977), is unfortunately not very strong in
its coverage of traditional Eastern European Jewish names.

For Hebrew names, there is the famous "Idish verterbukh" by the poet
Yehoash and Dr. Khayim (Charles) Spivak (New York:  1912; 1926).  The
title is a misnomer; it is a dictionary of Hebrew elements in Yiddish,
and among these elements are Hebrew first names (pp. [319]-325) and
family names (pp. [326]-330). While the Yehoash-Spivak dictionary is in
some ways dated (as is, for that matter, the 1928 Harkavy), it deserves
to be reprinted, with a new introduction (since the story behind it is
probably quite interesting -- the co-authors met, I believe, in Denver,
where Dr. Spivak was on the staff of a tuberculosis sanatorium and
Yehoash was one of the patients); it is not widely available these days.

There is much more to the bibliography of Jewish and Yiddish names than I
have listed here; this was just a forshpayz.

Subject: first names

Yiddish first names:

Harkavy's amerikanisher brivnshteler (New York 1902), pp. 227-236 lists
first names in Yiddish/Hebrew and the English equivalent (however no
pronunciation of the Yiddish).

Stankiewicz, Edward.  1980.  "The derivational pattern of Yiddish
personal (given) names"  in : _The field of Yiddish: studies in language,
folklore, and literature.  Fourth collection_.  Herzog, Marvin I.;
Kirshenblatt-Gimlett, Barbara;  Miron, Dan;  Wisse, Ruth <ed>
Philadelphia: ISHI, pp. 267-283

It has list of names and derivations of first names, although no Hebrew
spelling.

Subject: Priziv vs. priyut

Alice Honig (4.007) is right in understanding _priziv_ (from Russian
_prizyv_) as 'draft' in the song "Yoshke fort avek," but she is wrong in
identifying it with the word _priyut_ (also from Russian) cited from an
Iza Kremer song by Rick Gildemeister (4.006).  The song Rick referred to
is known variously as "Dem ganefs yikhes" or "Vos bistu kotenke/ketsele
baroyges."  The last line of the version in Kipnis's collection is "Un
genumen bin ikh fun priyut" ("And I was taken from the orphanage").

Subject: Er freyt zikh in Kovne

One of the curious phenomena in Yiddish is the element of superstition.
Because it Northeast Yiddish voynen is pronounced veynen, you find the
keyn-aynore formulation replacing the "unsafe" term. Ikh veyn in Kovne
becomes Ikh frey zikh in Kovene.

This phenomenon is well-known, but among what sector of the population
did this occur? There is possibly a class distinction, too. I know a man
who speaks Polish Yiddish, but it doesn't sound at all grating, as it
usually does when a shadkhen from Galitsye is parodied on the stage. His
family was quite balebatish, and his parents had assimilated names but
not anything relating to Christianity. His words come out soft and clear.
But the Litvaks have their "coarse" language, which is done to the hilt
by Menashe Skulnick

To get back to the main point, among whom did one find these
superstitions?
