Subject: Origin of Mozl-Bozhits?

Re Henryk Duda's post in Mendele 11.026:  In his article "Yiddish Place
Names in Poland," Edward Stankiewicz deals in depth with the
phonological issues connected with these toponyms (The Field of
Yiddish, Second Collection, ed. by Uriel Weinreich; Mouton, 1965, pp.
158-181).  I do not know, however, if Modliborzyce / Mzl-Bozhic
(=Mozl-Bozhits?) is mentioned within Stankiewicz's article.  His
footnotes lead to lists of and other articles about Yiddish place
names, and these are certainly worth pursuing.

Berl Kagan's book Sefer haprenumerantn (Hebrew Subscription Lists; The
Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1975), which
contains the most extensive listing of Yiddish place names, gives the
phonetic transcription "Modlibozhits" (entry no. 4620).  This is the
spelling that Kagan presumably found in the rabbinic books that he
consulted.  Of course there may also have been other versions of this
name in spoken Yiddish, for one or another of the reasons suggested by
Mr. Duda:

 >1. taboo - Jews try to avoid the Modli- which means to pray (Yiddish: 
modlen zih),
 >2. Volksetymologie,
 >3. phonetical adaptation of Modli- into Yiddish.

Subject: Jewish Braille Institute seeks Yiddish readers

Since 1931, The Jewish Braille Institute of America (JBI) has provided
the visually impaired and the blind of all ages with books, magazines
and special publications in braille and large print.  In 1960 JBI began
the production of audiocassette, further enabling full participation in
educational, cultural, religious and communal life of the Jewish
people.  Our individualized services--that are free of charge--enrich
the lives of over 30,000 people worldwide, most of whom are seniors.

JBI is in need of Yiddish readers willing to generously volunteer their
time to both narrate and direct books on tape.  At this time we are
unable to offer many wonderful Yiddish works to our Yiddish speaking
clients who are eager to hear materials in their mama loshen.

Located at 110 E 30th Street in Manhattan, the JBI sound studio has
many available time slots during the day, and occasionally during the
evening.  Please consider tzedakah by way of sharing the richness of
language with our clients.

We look forward to working with you.

Sincerely,

Ellen Wertheim

Subject: Male Ending for Female Nouns in the Plural

I have been thinking about this for quite some time, and finally found
a forum in which I am optimistic about receiving an answer. In Yiddish,
many of the words adopted from Hebrew take Hebrew endings when in
plural form. For instance, the plural of der Otser (the treasure) is
die Oytsres; Kos, cup, becomes Koyses; Beys-Midresh, study house,
becomes batei-midroshim. Generally, nouns that are "feminine" in Hebrew
take "os" endings, and masculine ones take "im" endings. Usually this
translates into Yiddish. The cases of Shabbos, Talis, and Tonis,
however, have always been puzzling to me. In Hebrew, they are feminine
nouns: Shabbos, or Shabbat, becomes Shabbatot (in Yiddish, Shabboses),
Talis, Talit, becomes Talitot, and Tonis (Ta'anit) become Ta'aniot. In
Yiddish, they instead take the male ending, become, respectively,
Shabbosim, Taleysim, Toneysim.

I had a theory that Hebrew nouns that ending with a Tof took the "im"
ending because perhaps Shabboses, Talises, Toniyes, sounded awkward to
Yiddish speakers, or at least the first two with it perhaps being hard
to separate the two s-sounds, but I realized that many nouns, like Os,
take plurals like Osiyes, even ones that do not take an "iyes" ending.

Anyway, that's one question of linguistics. Another related one: Why
does Kaysar become Kaysarim.

Any insight into these would be much appreciated.

A sheynem Dank,

Dovid Moshe Jacobson

Subject: Diminutive plurals

In resonse to Peggy Afuta [12.001]:

I believe the nonexistence of *kindl is unique -- and the reason is
likely the fact that, as pointed out to me by Beatrice Santorini, the
word _Kindel_ is/was used to denote the Christ child in at least some
varieties of German. And perhaps -- tho this is much more speculative
-- the nonexistence of *kindlekh follows from the nonexistence of
*kindl -- 'too close for comfort', so to speak. _Kinderlekh_ might then
be a sort of last resort, on the analogy of the Hebrew loanwords
(khasidimlekh, etc) that David Perlmutter's account explains.

Subject: Mikh Gelbart 

This is in response to Lori Cahan-Simon [11.026]:

Mikh Gelbart died childless.  He always said that the children of the
Arbeter-Ring (Workmen's Circle) Yiddish schools were his children.  He
was the music teacher of the Arbeter-Ring mitlshul (supplementary
high-school) when I was a student there (1942-1946).  We all "knew"
that he was the composer of "Ikh bin a kleyner dreydl."

When I worked in the national Education Department at 175 E. Broadway,
NYC , during the early 1950s, the primary secretary to the then Ed
Director, Nokhem Khanin (Chanin), Millie Melnick, once indicated that
Gelbart had written the song that was now being claimed by someone
else, and that he, Gelbart, thought seriously of suing the interloper,
but did not have the financial means to sustain what could have been a
long, and costly trial.  It is a "sod far gantz brod," that teachers in
the AR Shuln were not people of means. And so he decided not to resort
to the legal system, and let the matter rest in no-man's land.

It occurs to me that the music division of YIVO might be of some help
in your search.

Subject: sacco un vanzetti

Tayere mendelyaner,

Here is one title (a play, not a poem) in response to Larry Rosenwald's
query about Yiddish materials on Sacco and Vanzetti, and a follow-up
question.  In 1933, Mikhl Weichert directed the play Boston (Weichert
says the censor forced him to change the original title, Sacco un
Vanzetti), which he had adapted from an unpublished German text by
Bernhard Blume.  Boston, the first production staged by Weichert's Yung
Teater, was a critical and popular success.

My question: Boston has not been published, but if anyone knows where I
might find an archival copy, I would be grateful.

A sheynem dank,

Joel Berkowitz

Subject: Sacco and Vanzetti

Larry Rosenwald asks about works in Yiddish about Sacco and Vanzetti.

In 1930, Farlag I. A. Cukier (Warsaw) published Upton Sinclair's
"Boston" in Yiddish translation by Marek Fogelman. On the title page,
after the title, is : (Di tragedye fun sako un vantseti.  Roman.)

Subject: Query re luakh stories

Tayere Mendelyaner,

Does anyone know of a Yiddish story or even a joke that involves or
possibly refers to the intricacies (or otherwise :-) of the luakh?
Alles in besten,
