Subject: What song is this?

Marvin Engel inquired in 6.271 about a song containing the word
"zagranitshne."  The word comes from the Russian "zagranichnyi"
meaning "foreign(-made)," from "za granitsei" meaning "abroad."

Hope this helps.

Subject: What song is this?

The song Marvin Engel is asking about has been published in:

Skuditski, Z. 1933.  Folklor-lider: naye materyaln-zamlung.  Vol. 1.
Moscow: Emes, p. 143, # 15   and in

Slobin, M.  (ed.). 1982. Old Jewish Folk music: the collections and
writings of Moshe Beregovski.  Philadelphia: University of
Philadelphia Press, p. 231, ##107-108.

I don't have those books at hand right now, but the beginning verses
(which may actually be all) are the following:

Shimke Khazer iz keyn Stambul geforn,
er hot gevolt farbesern di yorn,
I: er hot gevolt dos lebn makhn beser
hot men im arayngerukht a zagranitshni meser :I

Mistome iz dos im azoy geven bashert
er zol lign tif bagrobn in Stambuler erd.
I: Er hot gevolt zayn glaykh tsu di geter,
hot men im oyf morgn geleygt in di bleter :I


Zagranitshni means foreign.

Subject: What song is this?

In 6.271 Marvin Engel mentions a line from a song:

   "er iz gevaldig tsufridn vos di mame hot im gehat"

which appears to be an abbreviated form of the expression:  "Er freyt
zikh vos di mame hot im gehat un nit keyn fremde yidene."  This was
also one of my mother's favorites and was used to characterize some
one who was too stupid to realize that cheerfulness was not always
appropriate.

Dos ershte lidl, hob ikh gehert, iz a tsinishtik por verter vegn dem
mord funem tsar alexander (II?): "er hot gevolt dos lebn makhn beser,
hot men im arayngerukt a zagrenitshne meser."  Iberzetsung: He wanted
to make things better; so, they slipped a foreign knife into him. [Who
the "they" were I do not know.]

Dos tseyte lid hobn mir oifpaser (counselors) in arbeter ring kemp

   ikh bin gevaldik tsufridn vos di mame hot mir gehat;
   ikh bin gevaldik tsufridn vos di mame hot mir gehat --
   un nit kayn fremde yidene."

Iberzetsung: "I am tremendously happy that my mother gave birth to me;
I am tremendously happy that my mother gave birth to me; I am
tremendously happy that my mother gave birth to me -- And not some
strange Jewess."

Marvin Engel's query brings to mind a camp song of yesteryear:

ikh bin gevaldig tsufridn vos di mame hot mir gehat (3 times) un nit
keyn fremde yidene.

Subject: What song is this?

The song that Marvin Engel is seeking is "Simkhe Khazer" . It is found
in the Beregovsky collection which was issued in paper back a few
years ago by the Univ. of Pennsylvania. The second set of lines does
not appear to be from the same song.

Subject: Did Sholem Aleichem play the violin?

Re the question as to whether Sholem Aleichem played the violin, I
quote the same source as L. Friedlander: Volf (Vevik) Rabinovitch,
"Mayn bruder Sholem-Aleykhem", Zikhroynes, Kiev, l939, pp. 26-27.  But
I cite a more complete passage:

"Di tekhnik fun shpiln hot er gekont shvakh... Derfar hot er ober
geshpilt mit neshome, arayngeleygt inem fidele dos gantse harts,
shtark tsugetulyet zikh mitn gekroyztn kop tsu der brust funem fidele,
geboygn zikh nokhn takt nokh, - dos fidele un zayn harts hobn zikh
tsunoyfgegosn un zaynen fargangen. Zayne oygn hobn gekukt vayt-vayt,
in an ander velt arayn, un s"hot zikh gedukht, az nit nor er hert di
tener, not er zet zey."

I also wrote "Zayne ershte lektsyes fidl-shpiln hot er genumen bay
zayn khaver Motl Tribner, dernokh bay Ben-tsion klezmer, un shpeter,
ven er iz shoyn alt geven 17 yor hot er vayter zikh gelernt bay Avrom
dem klezmer in Rzhistshev."

Perhaps L. Friedlander is right that Sholem Aleichem didn't possess
much of a technique, but he was able to play something, just as he
could improvise on the piano. Sholem Aleichem's daughter Marie Waife
Goldberg writes about his piano playing twice, in "My Father Sholem
Aleichem," N.Y. l968, p. l4l, and "As I Remember My Father" in "Melech
Grafstein's Sholom Aleichem Panorama," London, Ontario, l948, p. 208.
