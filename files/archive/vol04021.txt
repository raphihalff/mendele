Subject: Introduction/query

I am a newly-hatched member of the Mendele list (as of this morning) and
have been having a great time all day reading some of the past issues. I
do not speak Yiddish, understand it fairly well (my parents, Polish Jews
from Warsaw and Wieruszow [Western Poland, near Wielun] spoke it
constantly at home and had to resort to Polish to speak "over our heads")
and read it with more or less facility, depending on the material. I can
handle historical publications, e.g. about the Holocaust, with relative
ease, but have appreciable difficulty with more literary works.

I would like to ask for help with the following.  Some years ago, I read,
possibly in the now-defunct magazine Present Tense, a humorous anecdote,
of which I unfortunately remember only the punch line, which I cite here,
in the hope that one of your readers will recognize it and be able to
supply the rest of the story (and possibly also the source):

At a meeting in China between a western traveler and a group of local
inhabitants, the visitor makes somes remarks at the end of which one of
the incredulous Chinese members of the audience leans over to the visitor
and murmurs "emes?"

As I recall, the point of the story was to emphasize the ubiquitous
utility of "mame loshn".

Can anyone recommend to me some Yiddish stories in transliteration, for
my friend who wants to read the stories aloud to her mom. Sheyna dank.

Subject: Kinship terms/update

I may have farblondzhet on the use of plemenek in Romania. I had sent
Shleyme Axelrod directly my first posting, and it is quite possible that
his litvish family's use of these words for niece and nephew may have
obtained also in Romania. The library I work in now does not have a copy
of the book Stefanesti, so I can't verify it. Maybe someone else can give
us the scoop on this from *direct* experience. Oy, s'iz shver tsu zayn a
goy! :)

P.S. Shleymele, zol ikh hobn a refue shleyme! Es zhuzhet mir der kop,

Subject: Plemenek\Plemenitse

In Mendele 4.020, Rick Gildemeister expands the discussion of kinship
terms to uncles, aunts and cousins and mentions that in Romania the terms
plemenek and plemenitse were used, he claims, for "cousin."  I would just
note that plemyannik and plemyanitsa are standard Russian for nephew and
niece, respectively, and come from plemya, tribe, suggesting a root
meaning of something like "kinsman\woman" in a general sense perhaps.

Subject: eynikl; unoka

to Dovid Brown:

This sounds to me more like a connection to Slavic.  The Ukrainian term
for `eynikl' is onuk, the corresponding Russian one is: vnuk, Polish
wnuk.

Subject: Tz'enah ur'enah in English

I have used a version of the Tzene urene in my research on Yiddish
women's literature at Ohio State University.  The following is the the
catalog information from OSU's library on the work:

Tz'enah ur'enah, Ashkenazi, Yaakov ben Yitzchak, 1550-1628:  the classic
anthology of Torah lore and midrashic comment/ [jacob ben Isaac of
Janow]; translation from the Yiddish by Miriam Stark Zakon; introduction
by Meir Holder, with illustrations from the 1726 Frankfurt am Main
edition.  Brooklyn, NY : Mesorah Publications:  Jerusalem: Hillel Press,
1983-1984.  3 vols. Ill. 24 cm. BS1245J2841983

I found it very helpful, and a lovely work.  I hope it will be helpful to
you.

Subject: airplane/ship hold

Odem Vaytman asks how to translate "[cargo] hold [of an airplane]" for
his daughter.  Harkavy's *english-yidish verterbukh* (1893, 1910, p.
266), gives "last-roym fun a shif".  I wouldn't be surprised to learn
that Mordkhe Schaechter has dealt with the word somewhere in his _laytish
mame-loshn_ series.
