Subject: Praven and "Bejaher"

If I understood him right Perets Mett assumes [7.131] that prav (or praven, as
I transliterate it) is of Hebrew-Aramaic origin.  As far as I know it is pure
Slavic: Russian: "pravit'"  has the same meaning.  As for bentshn (mentioned
in the same post -- I missed the previous thread as I was traveling) -- it
comes from the latin "benedicere."

And Joachim Neugroschel [7.131] must have missed the German "Bejaher."  In the
form "Lebensbejaher" I have seen it in many places.

Subject: kabosh

I just read a convincing exploration of this term (including its false Gaelic
etymology) by a linguist I respect--Peter Maher.  To summarize:  Spellings
like kibash and resulting pronunciations are due to mis- (or re-) 
interpretations of the word.  The term in lower-class British slang is
attested in Dickens (1836).  The ultimate source is French caboche, an ancient
hunting term glossed in Skeat and Mayhew (A Glossary of Tudor and Stuart
words...) as "to cut off the head of a deer..."  Caboshed heads were hung
around to demonstrate hunting success, presumably...
  
Re the streets of Brooklyn:  before ethnics--Jews, Irish, Italians,
etc.--walked the streets of Brooklyn, there were actually people there whose
ancestors came from England!  and who brought *English* slang with them!!!

Subject: broyges

I would be interested to know the origin of this word. It is not spelt 
phonetically like words of Germanic or Slavic origin and therefore assume 
that it might be of Hebrew or Aramaic origin. I have heard  South African 
Jews pronounce it 'breyges' and I have seen it spelt beys reysh hey 
gimmel zayen as well as beys reysh vav gimmel zayen.

Subject: Geyt a goy in shenkl arayn

The only published source that I know for the song "Geyt a goy..."  is
_Yiddish Folk Songs:  50 Songs for Voice and Piano_, collected by Sarah
Pitkowsky Schack, piano arrangement by Ethel Silberman Cohen, first published
by Bloch Publishing Company in NYC in 1924 (a time of less multicultural
sensitivity), with later editions (e.g., third, revised edition in 1927). 

Andrew Cassell's comment, prompted by mention of this song, that perhaps the
stereotype of the sober Jew is a bit exaggerated, finds additional support in
my paper, "'Geyt a yid in shenkl arayn':  Jewish Songs of Drunkenness," _The
Field of Yiddish_, 5th collection (1993), ed. David Goldberg.  One observation
from that paper (which may, in fact, be due to an oral comment by Michael
Steinlauf, to whom I hereby apologize for the lack of any published
acknowledgment) is that applying phrases like _shiker/trinken vi a goy_ to a
gentile would be tautological; in fact they are used to describe the habits of
particular Jews. 

The text of the song, as published in the Schack-Cohen collection (but not as
printed there since, as Pitkowsky Schack writes in her preface, "[i]n the
transliteration, the German orthography was used as a basis") is as follows: 

GEYT A GOY IN SHENKL ARAYN

Geyt a goy in shenkl arayn,
in shenkl arayn, in shenkl arayn.
Trinkt er dort a gut glezl vayn,
a gut glezl vayn, a gut glezl vayn.
Oy, shiker iz a goy, shiker iz a goy,
shiker iz er, trinken muz er,
vayl er iz a goy.

Geyt a yid in bes-medresh arayn,
in bes-medresh arayn, in bes-medresh arayn.
Khapt er dort a kdushele arayn,
a kdushele arayn, a kdushele arayn.
Oy, nikhter iz a yid, nikhter iz a yid,
nikhter iz er, davnen muz er,
vayl er iz a yid.

Geyt a goy fun shenkl aroys,
fun shenkl aroys, fun shenkl aroys.
Brekht er dort a por shoybelekh oys,
a por shoybelekh oys, a por shoybelekh oys.
Oy, shiker iz a goy, shiker iz a goy,
shiker iz er, brekhn muz er,
vayl er iz a goy.

Geyt a yid fun bes-medresh aroys,
fun bes-medresh aroys, fun bes-medresh aroys.
Kusht er dort a por mezuzelekh oys,
a por mezuzelekh oys, a por mezuzelekh oys.
Oy, nikhter iz a yid, nikhter iz a yid,
nikhter iz er, kushen muz er,
vayl er iz a yid.

(The word _muz_ in the penultimate line of each stanza is presumably
pronounced  _miz_ [as the dialect basis of theater Yiddish would dictate]
to make the internal rhyme work.)

Subject: Anglicization

A frequent topic on Mendele is that of transliteration into the Roman
alphabet.  There appears to be widespread agreement that the YIVO system is
the standard for Yiddish and should be supported and encouraged. 

But that's for Yiddish.  What about (say) English?  The same standard does not
necessarily apply to the growing number of English borrowings from Yiddish. 
Indeed, it might be thought presumptuous for Yiddishists to dictate the proper
spelling of English words.  On the other hand, the spellings that abound in
English contexts are extremely variable, following capricious notions of
phonetics, and offensively (in my opinion) imitating German spellings in many
cases.  (I can forgive the contorted efforts of writers to suggest the
pronunciation of Yiddish words through the use of English "phonetic" spelling,
but there is no justification for using the orthographic conventions of a
third language.) 

So perhaps there is a useful role that Yiddish scholars, speakers, readers,
writers, and other interested and informed parties can play in influencing the
spelling of Yiddish words in English.  Any thoughts? 

In general, English practice is pretty good about maintaining the original
spelling of foreign words that are quoted or otherwise used as explicit
borrowings.  In the course of time, foreign words sometimes penetrate deeply
into the English language and become thoroughly naturalized.  When this
happens, the pronunciation and spelling may change.  But at least in the first
phase of this process, the foreign spelling is usually maintained. 

This hasn't happened with Yiddish.  The main reason, surely, is the difference
in the alphabets:  It is much easier to maintain a foreign spelling when no
transliteration is required.  There is also the special way in which Yiddish
is regarded by many people--as a funny, cute vernacular belonging to comedians
and anyone else who lays claim to it, rather than as a real language belonging
to a real people and having a real spelling. 

Should we urge the YIVO spelling on English writers, editors, and publishers? 
Or is it really too late to fight this battle, since so many Yiddish words
have been spelled differently for so long in English?  For instance, can we
expect anyone to write `ganev' in an English sentence?  It would look very
strange to the average reader, who would probably not even be able to
pronounce it.  But do we have to accept `goniff'?  Is there some compromise
that we can advocate?  Or should we acknowledge defeat with regard to the
older and most common borrowings, on the notion that these words are
thoroughly anglicized by now, and try to hold the line on newer ones?

Subject: L.A. "Times" Uses YIVO Standard Transliteration

moshiekh'es tsaytn! Yesterday, Dec. 23, 1997, in its "Life & Style" section,
the Los Angeles "Times" ran a "First Person" column by its staff writer, Matea
Gold, which opened with the first two lines of the second stanza of "Oyfn
Pripetshik," transliterated in full accordance with the YIVO standard, rather
than the quasi-Germanic style usually followed in the popular press. In the
body of the column, the song's opening lines were also quoted, also (almost) 
correctly.

This encouraging development was somewhat marred, however, by the attribution
"Yiddish folk song." Via the "Times'" web site, the author and editor were
advised of the song's authorship, words and music, by Mark Varshavski
(1848-1907). 

(Incidentally, the full text of _oyfn pripetshik_ in Yiddish, transliteration
and singable English translation, appears in "Apples and Honey: Music and
Readings for a Secular Humanistic Observance of the Jewish New Year Festival." 
For more information: <rifke@earthlink.net>.)

Subject: hegdesh

Regarding the word, "hegdesh", I remember the word as "hegnish", and it meant
"a mess".  I remember being told not to do something or other because "you
will make a hegnish out of it". 

I assume that the word I remember is the same as the one being discussed. 
I'm not sure of the word that I know.  Is it?

An error in pronunciation?  A pronunciation peculiar to a region?  An error in
my memory? 

I'd appreciate enlightenment.

Subject: Shiker Iz a Goy

Way back in the 30s and 40s one of my favorite 78's in Yiddish was a Green
Label Columbia record Shiker Iz A Goiy sung by the famous cantor Chazan
Mordechai Hershman It lost its popularity some thirty-forty years ago and
later I will present my interpretation why. A few months ago I bought a
compact disc featuring 15 selections in Yiddish. Selection 12 is Hershman's
rendition of Shiker Iz A Goy (Yiddish Masterpieces I.M.-Israel Music) 

Here is my transliteration of the song. Despite the twenty times or more that
I played the second stanza there are 2 or3 words that "ikh hab nisht gekent
khapen!" 

Geht der goy in shenkel arein,
In shenkel arein, in shenkel arein
Trinkt ehr dort a glayzele vayhn
A glayzele vayhn, a glayzele vayhn
Oi,vahl shiker iz der goy
Shiker iz ehr trinken miz ehr vahl ehr iz a goy (2)(

Geht der goy funem shenkel arauss
Funem shenkel arauys,funem shenkel arauys.
Klapt ehr ayza(?) YiddenA pastel auys
A pastel auys, a tobele auys
Oi, vahl shiker iz der goy
Shiker iz ehr klapen miz ehr, vahl ehr iz a goy (2)

Geht der Yid in beis midrash arein,
In beis midrash arein, in beis midrash arein
Khapt ehr dort a minchele arein ,a kedushele arein
A brochole(?) arein, a perek mishnayess arein.
Aha, vahl nikter iz a Yid

Nichter iz ehr, davenen miz ehr vahl ehr iz a yid (2)

In the tradition of the Yiddish orator who opens his oration with the
introduction "ayder ich vel reden vel ich zogen a pohr verter", Before I speak
I want to say a few words. In this case before I render my translation from
Yiddish to English. (1) The second stanza is almost incomprehensible because
despite my playing the stanza twenty times or more I could not "khap" three or
four key words (2) I made no attempt to render a translation according to the
rhyming couplets of the Yiddish text. 

The "goy"(non-Jew)goes into the tavern,
Into the tavern, into the tavern
There he drinks a glass of wine, a glass of wine
A glass of wine Oh! because the goy is a drunkard
Drunk he is, Drink he must because he is a goy.(2)

The goy goes out of the tavern, 
Out of the tavern, out of the tavern
He beats up Yidden (Jews)
(I could not translate two phrases that follow the above)
Oh! because the goy is a drunk
He is drunk,he must beat up, because he is a goy (2)

The Yid (Jew) goes into the study hall and prayer room (beis midrash) There
he grabs in an  
afternoon service(minchah), a Sanctificationof the Lord prayer(kedusha) a
blessing praye
And a study of a chapter of the Mishna
Aha, because he is sober
Sober is he praying he must because he is a Jew(2)

There is something especially interesting for me with this song. I must have
heard it may be some hundred times and I do not recall a stanza with the words
of the goy beating up Jews. I recall a stanza which is something like the
following: Geht der goy fonem shenkel arauys, fonem shenkel arauys fonem
shenkel arauys. Warft ehr a shtayn in beis midrash arein, in beis midrash
areinand then the refrain Shiker iz a goy. 

The goy goes out from the tavern , goes out from the tavern, goes out from
the tavern.
He throws a stone into the beis midrash, into the beis midrash.

How come a song which enjoyed such popularity 40-50 years ago disappeared ? 
Second, third and fourth generation Jews who grew up in the USA and Canada and
experienced an entirely different relationship with the goy than his parents
and grandparents experienced in Eastern Europe. The song is based on
stereotypic thinking.  Also I believe the passivity and non-violent response
of the Jew as illustrated in the song is foreign to todays Jews.

Subject: Yiddish self learning programs for PCs

My name is Charlotte Frajman and I live in Melbourne, Australia.

Do you know of any self teaching software available for absolute beginners
wanting to learn Yiddish?  I am thinking of something similar to the
excellent "Tripple Play Plus" series that teaches basic language, alphabet
and pronunciation.
