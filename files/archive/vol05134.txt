Subject: Request info on nabbing or getting

I am asking help on the following.  What is the colloquial Yiddish for
"get" in the sense of "get 'em"  --i.e., to grab, nab, apprehend, do away
with, etc.

I am looking for the way people say it, not merely the literal
translation.

Thanks.

Neil Jacobs

Re: Arre Komar's frage in Mendele Vol 5.130

Your repeatedly unanswered question about the meaning of standard Yiddish
with regard to current demographic realities, the question is indeed an
excellent one.  What is a standard when, as in this instance, native
speakers, and especially khasidim, don't use it.

It is appropriate to ask whether standard Yiddish reflects a historical
need more than a present one. The small but dedicated cadre of
Yiddishists certainly adhere to the standard with vigor. But, as you
point out, the khasidim pay no attention.  They still put out Yiddish
language newpapers, using their own way of writing. They speak a variety
of dialects, some of which reach back to historical European dialects and
some of which are fusions yet again.

The silence to your question, is, I think, possibly the silence of
denial? Since Yiddishism was founded in the rejection of orthodoxy, that
only the very orthodox have vibrant Yiddish speaking communities may be
an unpleasant reality - but reality nonetheless.

For instructing Yiddish (in Yiddish as a Second language,  YSL) - the
standard is as good as any, and is incorporated in the available secular
language texts.  However, learners then have trouble understanding
Yiddish films, which are largely in the "lowbrow" dialect and who knows
if they could converse with the khasidim that speak the other dialects?
When I was a child in Montreal I was taught Parisian French and therefore
could not communicate with my French Canadian neighbours. I later
realized how offensive that must have been to them.

Dialect issues are complex and emotionally charged. I have personnally
had to struggle with them.  As a speaker- yes, and a proud speaker, of a
dialect, i face the queston when  I teach Yiddish. I have taken a
compromise position, explaining that I will try to accommodate the
standard, which I use more for simplicity than ideology, I hear myself
speaking what sounds to me like the Yiddish equivalent of an American
trying to put on a British accent.  It sticks in my throat. Besides
which, if you ever listen to Lebedeff or Dzigan and Shumakher, much of
the joy of Yiddish is in the dialects.

I would recommend reconsideration of attitudes towards dialects. The time
for purism - is past. I find that there are many who know Yiddish and who
might speak it, but do not because of fear of making mistakes. In
elevating the status of Yiddish, we must not inhibit those who might hold
back with Yiddish. The cirle of the Yiddish elite is ever fewer and fewer
and prescriptivism will not help efforts to keep Yiddish alive.

In YSL- Yiddish as a Second Language, we should try to catch up with
current ESL methodologies and think in communicative terms. This is
especially true for developing Yiddish oral language. For writing, the
standard does already accommodate significant dialect differences. I hope
that sheds some light.

Subject: Shilumim

In response to Steve Jacobson (Mendele 5.132), the word "shilumim" does
mean "reparations".  This definition is in the Meggido Modern Dictionary,
in the Hebrew-English volume.  It is related to the words "shiluey" and
"shilum" which mean payment or bribe.

Subject: Shilumim

Reuben Alcalay, _The Complete Hebrew-English Dictionary_, has an entry
under shilum (shin-lamed-vav-mem), defined as "reward, requital, payment;
bribery." Under the subentry "shilumim," the following definition is
given: "reparations (especially from Germany), reward, remuneration,
retribution, restitution." An additional subentry, "shilumim mi-germanya,"
is defined as "German reparations."

Subject: Yiddish Left

My name is Eric Schoenbaum.  I live in LA, teach high school history and
I'm a grad student in history.  I'm working on a project about the
Yiddish left and want to contact some kindred souls.  I grew up in that
milieu in NY.  My mother's teacher was Itchie Goldberg.  I'd also like to
get bibliographic info.  Please write back at above address.

thanks

Subject: ICOR

I am currently researching the American Jewish organization known as the
ICOR, which flourished in Canada amnd the United States between the
mid-1920s and 1950. It was a Communist-led movement, comprised largely of
first-generationJews and it supported the ill-fated Soviet project to
establish a so-called Jewish republic in Birobidzhan, in the far east of
the USSR. Would anyone know where I might obtain their literature or
other documents? I have already read a number of issues of their
bilingual (English-Yiddish) magazine Nayleben, published in the 1930s and
1940s.

I'm somewhat behind in my reading and have only now gotten to the
_Forward_ of Sept 29. Better I shoulda skipped it.

Page 14. "With Kerouac and Yazierska on the Boardwalk" by Lisa
Lipkin: _"Er mentch drakht un gut lakht"_.

If ever there were a case of _shraybn Noyekh mit zibn grayzn_
this is it.

_Im ba-arazim nafla shalhevet_ what hope is there for the rest of
us? Is no one minding the store?  Whence will our salvation come?
Philologus, where are _you_ when we really need you?
