Subject: posuk/verse

Maybe I haven't really understood the question, but a posuk is
rather like a sentence. So I suppose I would happily say zats.

If a verse means a verse or stanza in a poem what about 'fal'. We
certainly use 'fal' for the parts of a song or tune (not found in
Weinreich).

Subject: onkl, tante and the whole family

Whilst I am busily pontificating to the mendele readership, here's
another thought of mine.

I was brought up on mume and feter (I can't remember any more whether
tante was used), and shvesterkind (not kuzen) but ... nefe (for
nephew). In fact I only became aware of another (Russian?) word for
nephew when I came into more contact with litvaks (real and
naturalised) who started talking about plumenik. I am reminded about
this because my (Polish born, mame-looshn speaking) uncle was in
Israel a couple of weeks ago and of course he visited my son there.
When they went to the beysmedresh together he was asked by some of
the 'locals' whether Efrayim (my son) was his 'plumenik'. He had to
find out what plumenik meant!!

"Latin v.Yiddish: 'Oys" Have It
by James Barron

Oyez! Oyez! Make that oy, vay! oy, vay! All persons are requested to
draw near and give their attention.  A linguistic tribunal is now in
session, Judge Alex Kozinski presiding.

	The Verdict: Yiddish may be replacing stuffy Latin phrases
"as the spice in American legal argot."

	Judge Kozinski, a Federal appeals court judge in Pasadena,
Calif., and Eugene Volokh, his former clerk who is now clerking for
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor of the U.S. Supreme Court, used the
Lexis information-retrieval service to count Yiddish words in court
decisions.

	Their tally, just published in the Yale Law Journal, shows
that judges have a lot of chutzpah.  That word turned up in 123
opinions, all but 11 since 1980.  The scores for its English
counterparts were 200 for "temerity" and a mere 10 for "unmitigated
gall."

Schlemiels and Nebbishes

	Five judges used shlemiel.  But as Judge Kozinski and Mr.
Volokh noted, "One is in a quote from testimony, which doesn't
count, one is in the name of a book and two are descriptions of
Woody Allen's screen persona." (The authors relegated their own
semantic footnote, "Woody Allen's characters have always struck us
more as nebbishes than schlemiels," they wrote opting for the
Yiddish term for "pitifully inept" over the outright "bungler.")

	The judge said the search began when he caught a law clerk
sticking the work shtick, a "piece of misconduct," into one of his
decisions.  That led to some in camera kibitizing, or joking, and
when the judge realized that the clerk in question was
Irish-Catholic, to a finding of fact: "You don't have to be Jewish
to use a little Yiddish," he said in a n interview.

	With that, judge and clerk hit the computer.  Judge Kozinski
said that because Yiddish is written in its own script, based
largely on Hebrew, some allowances were made for English spelling.
Chutzpah, for example appeared as chutzpa, hutzpah and hutzpa, while
shmooze, to chat, turned up as schmoose.

	The Lexis search found Yiddish to be particularly popular in
Georgia, where an appelant's tsoris, or troubles, was mentioned in a
1974 opinion.  That was two years after the first reported use
anywhere of "chutzpah" in a decision from Georgia's top court about
a robber who broke into a sheriff's office to steal guns.  that
"qualifies as chutzpah in our book," the authors said.

Subject: A retenish vegn a lidele

I recently found myself in a Vietnamese establishment (fregt shoyn
nisht) and after a while realized that I was listening to a Yiddish
song.  That is to say, it _wasn't_ a Yiddish song, it was Vietnamese,
but it was exactly to the last detail a Yiddish song of the sort we
used to hear on Yiddish radio in the 30's: pre-Mantovani Russianoid
shmaltz.  There was even a singer who specialized in it (not
Sheyndele di Khazente) but I forget her name.

Anyway, for those who might want to check it out, here are the
facts.

Disc: Diem Xua
Singer: Y Lan
Song: Chia Khoa Tinh Yeu (Key of Love)

And to Mendele's musically-gifted who of course have known about
this (and much more) all along: please explain.
