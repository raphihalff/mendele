Subject: eysex; nitl

Re Mendele 08.106:

_eysex_ is, decidedly _veys ikh_. It's the only case I know of in which
word-initial [-v] is dropped. Intervocalically, [-v-] loss is frequent in
Southeastern Yiddish in words like _keyvero'(v)es_, _malekhamo'(v)es_,
_gutno(v)nt_; interconsonantally, in _ts(v)ishn_, _ts(v)ogn_; _tsishn_
occurs throughout Central Yiddish, as well. (Atlas, Volume I: Map 75.) 

The emergence of a non-etymological [v] (i.e., prevocalic fricativization]
is frequent in SEY and in southern NEY: _novnt/nuvnt_ 'near',
_nevnter/neyvnter/nivnter_ 'nearer', _tuves_ 'error', _blov/bluv_ 'blue',
_zaver/zover_ 'sour'. Exclusively SEY: _boven_ 'to build'; Almost
exclusively NEY: _ever_ 'ear', _tever_ 'gate'. And more. (Atlas, Volume I,
Maps 20, 26, 31, 40, 41). 

_nitl_(-nakht) is the most frequent Yiddish word for 'Christmas (eve)';
[definitely NOT Easter!!]. _nitl_ has been variously derived from Latin
(_dies) natalis_ (M. Weinreich 1973, Volume III, p. 204), and from Italian
_Natale_ "reformed in Yiddish under the influence of Hebrew _nitlah_ '(the
one who was) hanged'" (Wexler 1988:125). Western Yiddish _tole-nakht_
(_tole_ 'image of the crucifixion') seems to favor the latter
interpretation. Map 118, Atlas, Volume III (in press) lists more than 15
designations for Christmas.

Subject: nitl

Interesting. I always (?) thought nitl was derived from natal=birth. 
Nitl-nacht being the night of the birth of Jesus. 

Can one of our professional linguists shed some light on this?

Subject: Yiddish music of Birobidzhan

There are several collections of Soviet Yiddish folk songs, all of which
have substantial sections on songs of Birobidzhan.  The best of these (and I
believe the collection in which "Dortn in sovyetnland" can be found) is
"Yidishe folks-lider" by Moshe Beregovskii and Itsik Fefer (Kiev: 1938).  I
would also recommend "Yidishe folks-lider" by Yehezkel Dobrushin and A.
Yuditsky (Moscow: 1940); and "Yidishe folkslider" by Moisei Khashchevatskii
and Der Nister (Odessa: 1940).  Ruth Rubin's "Voices of a People" (New York:
1963) also has a small section on songs of Birobidzhan.

Subject: Poems by Itzik Fefer

I am currently preparing the American edition of Nepravedny Sud (An Unjust
Trial), a volume for Yale University Press' Annals of Communism Series that
will feature the transcript of the secret 1952 Moscow trial of fifteen
Jewish figures, including five prominent Yiddish writers.  Itzik Fefer was
one of the defendants; 13 were executed on August 12, 1952.  I am looking
for the texts of two of his poems; I have come across references to them in
secondary literature, but have yet to find direct references to where they
were published or where I could find them now.  The two poems are: 

1)  "A Bullet in Your Head, Sholem Asch," which I believe Fefer wrote after
Asch received an award from the Pilsudski government.

2)  A poem in honor of the Mufti of Jerusalem, presumably written after the
1936 riots in Palestine.

Subject: Di Lererin Mira

I just wanted to thank those Mendelyaners who suggested that I set
Sutzkever's "Di Lererin Mira" to music for my project a few months ago. I
did set the poem, and I recorded it with a guitarist and performed it live
for the event. It was a big success. Now my band (Klezamir) has slated it
for our next recording project. 

A sheynem dank!

Subject: Joseph Roth et al. in Yiddish

Re Noyekh Miller's question on translaitons (08.107): I am afraid I have no
references on hand, but I am willing to bet that Zweign, Heinrich Mann, and
possibly some of Musil's books were tgranslated into Yiddish.  There was a
hunger for translations into Yidfdish of European masters, and it was one
one isure way for some people (e.g., Bashevis) to make an extra zloty.  Some
Yiddish libraries ought to have those books.

Subject: finstere gelechter

Dear list,

A friend of mine writes to me  the following:

May I ask you a favor?  I need to know the Yiddish words for the kind of
laughter one has because if one weren't laughing, one would have to cry --
as I was doing when telling people about having a kid in a nursing home in
Seattle and a parent in a nursing home in Indianapolis, a sister with
pneumonia, etc., etc, that ironic, rueful laughter, because life's too
absurd.  Candidates are belacht mit yashikes (that source thought yashikes
were prickles or thistles) and a finstere gelechter.  One person suggested,
"In my family a circumstance such as you describe would use the expression
'a fin-ster-eh gelechter,' literally a laughter of darkness or 'zie lacht
mit yash-chert-kes' -- literally she laughs with lizards."

Can someone help out? If you could post your responses both to this list,
and cc fordham@geology.ucdavis.edu (Evelyn Verosub), I would be very
grateful. (Evelyn is seeking a title to a book of poetry she is finishing;
she would like to use "A finster gelechter," but worries that it is not
authentic/ appropriate.
