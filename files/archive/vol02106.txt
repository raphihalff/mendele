Subject: Sneezes

If we speak about sneezes, my mother (who doesn't
speak Yiddish, but German) told me after the first
sneeze "Zur Gesundheit!", after the second time "Lebe
Wohl!" and after the third sneeze "Donnerwetter!!
Wo hast du dich wieder Verkuehlt?"

Subject: RE: Khalerya

A short medical note on cholera.  The disease is almost
unknown in the States but we had some here in Israel, 60
cases at one go, a few years ago.

The disease is characterized by severe acute liquid
diarrhea, accompanied by dehydration, often enough to be be
fatal.  The disease is self limiting and is almost never
fatal now, with intravenous fluid replacement.


Cholera, lo aleynu, is bacterial in origin and spread from
waste products ingested.  In our case, it arose from the
use of waste water for irrigating crops on the West Bank
and Gaza. This has been stopped.

Subject: RE: khalerya

More on khaleria:  My grandmother was nominally Jewish,
traveled with a band of Tzigane in Hungary.  My
grandfather, also nominally Jewish had faked his way into
the Hungarian army, and with his handlebar mustache was the
veritable epitome of the Magyar offizier.  They had a
collection of curses in an argot of Yiddish, Hungarian, and
whatever language the Tzigane spoke, Rom, I think.  When
they encountered my other grandparents, grandfather a
British anarchist and grandmother, an Orthodox Russian Jew,
they took on even more curses, and eventually became
skilled in translating them into English so the
grandchildren would fully understand them.  I wish I had
access to their rich vocabularies now.

Subject: S'iz geven erev nitl

Can anyone in Mendele Land help me with a most important
query?  I am looking for a humorous Yiddish translation of
'Twas the night before (you should pardon the expression)
Christmas.  I saw such a translation somewhere about 20
years ago (?Yugntruf) but can't find it anywhere, and I'd
like to use part of it in connection with a Chanukah party
in a few weeks.  If anyone knows of same and can post it,
I'd sure appreciate it... und tsu aleh, a gute nacht!

Subject: Khurbn of goyim

I was the one who asked about khurbm, but I did not hear
it. It first appeared on Mendele in early November,
apparently in the Ohio-dialect (Midwestern Yiddish), and
several others repeated it. I have no doubts that A.
Abramson was phonologically correct, but I still think that
it is almost impossible to pronounce, at least with my
Hungarian lips. Imagine the difficulties that I have with
my e-mail address, and how I envy M. Herzog/ZOGUR. (Did he
ever reveal how much one has to pay for such a custom-made
electronic license plate?)

Speaking of M. Herzog, his question (2,104#3) on Sege (fem
Segte) turned out to be very interesting. Werner
Weinberger: (Die Reste des juedischdeutschen.) knows these
word, but is so unsure about the origins, that he would
even suggest Hebrew: zeh goy (!!!)  But in an old
dictionary I found under Se›gen: sign, esp. sign of cross,
from Latin signum. How is this? The next step would be to
check the Grimm multi-volume dict., to which I don't have
access here.

I was puzzled by fellow-Itzhak Jeff Finger's comment about
censored and uncensored books. The Rabbis did use various
words to describe non-Jews, some used these as synonyms,
others had a system for nokhri, akum, oved elilim, Edom
(Rome), arelim, etc. I am not sure that writing for a
Jewish audience there would be too much self- censorship.
On the other hand, censorship by "goyim" only appeared in
the 16th century in Western Europe. The importance of the
Medieval manuscripts, incl. the ones in the Vatican is that
they show a more reliable, uncensored text. In order to be
fair, the mss. of the Vatican are accessible to scholars,
and many Jewish scholars researched them over the past
hundred years. Considering how much more the Vatican could
do on behalf of the Jewish "goy", I don't think it would be
wise to let them off the hook with returning a few
manuscripts.

The opposite of goy is, of course, "amkha" meaning a Jew.
This shift in meaning results in a very interesting reading
of the Chumash, when God tells Moses (after the golden calf
incident) "Ki amkha ha-goy hazeh".
