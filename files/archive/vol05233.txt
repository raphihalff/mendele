Subject: Mayn shtetele Belz

While, like Bob Rothstein, I am under the impression that the Belz that is the
subject of Alexander Olashanetzky's song is the Bessarabian Beltsy, rather
than the Galician Belz, the landslayt of both localities have staked a claim
to the song.  The "Belz yisker-bukh" (Tel Aviv, 1974), for the Galician
shtetl, and "Sefer Beltsi Basarabiah" (Jerusalem, 1993) both include it,
though the version in the Belz (Galicia) book is the more complete one -- for
what that's worth.

Subject: pluperfect

to meyer-leyb wolf: i hope you don't think that i think that all litvaks have
merged the two auxiliaries! as i mentioned to dovid braun, for olsvanger
(among others) the distinction is alive and well.

that's very curious that yehoash uses _gevest_ only as the pluperfect particle
(while olsvanger uses it only in the past conditional) but it's even more
curious that he uses it only in one part of the book. do you have any ideas
why that might be?

i'm also very interested in why you refer to it as the 'pluperfect PARTICLE'.
in fact, that's what my very speculative little story says it is, a particle
rather than a real verbal item, so i'd very much like to know if that's what
you meant and if this has been discussed anywhere in the literature. a dank!

Subject: Soviet Yiddish songs

In Vol. 5.219 Iosif Vaisman gives the words of a Soviet Yiddish song:

lomir trinken a lekhaim,                let's drink
ai-ai-ai, ai-ai-ai,
far dem leibn ayer naye,                for your new life
ai-ai-...

far oktiabr revolutsie,                 for October revolution
ai-ai-...
un far stalin konstitutsie,             and for Stalin's constitution
ai-ai-...

Vaisman  asks for  possible more  of  it and  its author.   I have  no
knowledge about the author.  To my surprise, I the yekke know one more doublet
which surely is later than the late 1930's Reb Vaisman gave as the date of the
song (leaving out the ai-ai..):

Romenien hot gekhapt a shvartsen sof
for dos sol leben khaver molotov.

Otherwise the version I know is the similar with just minor changes.

Subject: dead/dying languages

to arnie herschorn: as for whether the passing of the last speaker of some
language brings a tear to my eye, it depends on a number of things.

1. as a linguist: it brings a tear to my eye if the language has not been
adequately documented, which, given today's technology, would include
compiling a vast database of the spoken language in a variety of registers and
social contexts, uttered by the full range of speakers (with respect to age,
class, geographic origin, etc etc etc).

2. as a person: it brings a tear to my eye if the reason that this is the last
speaker is that all the other speakers have been killed. if, on the other
hand, all the other would-be speakers are alive and well but have chosen (or
their parents/grandparents/... have chosen) to speak another language, then i
see nothing to cry over. i value the freedom to speak whatever language you
like and to raise your children in that language over the survival of a
language. don't you?

>Adjust now to the fact that Yiddish no longer lives and avoid the bitter
>disappointment later.

up till now, i have carefully avoided discussing yiddish per se in this
discussion. but let me now say what i think, for what it's worth. of course
none of us can see into the future, but, if the present trends continue, i
would predict that yiddish is _not_ dying but will remain alive in certain
ultra-orthodox speech communities in various parts of the world. now of
course, all living languages are in a constant state of change, and therefore
yiddish will change too. i would predict that it will change at an
above-average rate from the yiddish of pre-war eastern europe or the maurice
schwartz era, since the new speech community will be very different
demographically, socially, and linguistically from the old ones.
(demographically and socially, the new one will be a proper subset of the old
ones; linguistically, the 'coterritorial language' will be different -- modern
hebrew, new york/london/melbourne english, what have you.)

interestingly, if this comes to pass, the new yiddish will have one thing very
much in common with the old yiddish: it will be an in-group language of a
community living in the midst of a larger and different community but
interacting with that larger community in only restricted ways.

one other thought. it is very easy to think of the holocaust as the reason for
the uncertain status of yiddish today, and surely the annihilation of millions
of speakers _is_ an inescapably important point. at the same time, there are
millions of jews in the world today who do not speak yiddish and whose
ancestors did and their story has nothing to do with the holocaust but rather
with assimilation (or 'self-deghettoization' -- choosing to stop living apart
from the larger community around them), migration (both from the villages to
the cities of eastern europe and from eastern europe to the rest of the
world), and the concomitant language-shift. i happen to be such a person and i
suspect that most mendelniks who are not fluent yiddish speakers are also such
people. it is even quite possible that the same discussion would be taking
place today if the holocaust had never occurred, tho with a few million more
people, may they rest in peace.

Subject: Life and death of language

Reading the recent contributions about the living and dying of languages, I
merely wish to point that life or death of a language has nothing to do
whatsoever with the number of persons who speak it.

A language is dead only when it becomes monolytic, preserved, no longer alive
in the very meaning of that word, no longer reacting to outside stimuli, no
longer changing, no longer acquiring or shaping new words, no longer
developing dialects, etc. Living is a proces, and as soon as language isn't in
proces anymore, it's dead.

This can happen despite the fact that a language is being used for ritual
purposes, prayers etc. A language can be dead years, even centuries, before
people stop using it to those ends. Continued usage, on the other hand, may
make a later revival more probable, easier perhaps, but that's another story.
A language can even be dead in a time when books are published in it, should
those books be out of touch with time.

Sitting here at my computer and reading Mendele, I did not get the impression
that Yiddish is in acute danger, that is, as long one doesn't try to hard to
preserve it as it is, or was.
