I regret to have to make the following announcement:

Prof. Nathan Susskind, a retired teacher of German and Jewish studies at
City College and an authority on Yiddish, died on Thursday in Overlook
Hospital in Summit, NJ.  He was 87 and lived in West Palm Beach, FL.

Professor Susskind taught at City College from 1932 until his retirement
in 1974.  He was also a director of the Institute for Yiddish Lexicology
at the City Univ. of New York.  The institute was founded to create the
Great Dictionary of the Yiddish language of which 4 volumes have
appeared.

His death was announced in the west coast edition of the NY Times today,
July 20, 1994.  A complete obituary is contained in the paper of that
date.

Subject: Zeroing in

Dovid Braun tells us that the now famous saying "Heri Peysakh Novik" or
"Heri zayn ondenk" were uttered by a speaker from Lomze. Zachary Baker
congratulates the winners for recognizing the expression as "Southeastern
Yiddish". They can't both be right. Lomze is in northeatern Poland,
essentially an outpost of Litvish Yiddish. Who is right?

Inferring from the features of the expression, we have to conclude that
Dovid's information is correct. There are two features to be considered:

i) the "non funcional 'h', a feature of a channel which run along the
Polish)Lithuanian)Belorussian border, from about the East Prussian border
in the Northeast, an area which incorporates Lomze, southeastward into
the Ukraine to about Odessa (see Atlas, Vol.I, Map 66). On the basis of
this feature alone, both Dovid and Zachary could be right. However, we
mustn't overlook

ii) the quality of the unstressed vowel in "heri". The "i" is a dead
giveaway of the "Womzi" (Lomze = Womzhe) area. Likewise a neigboring
shtetl "GrajEwo"))Yiddish "Grajvi". This is NOT a feature of Southeastern
Yiddish.

Meyshke Alpert:

You DO get around. On the matter of Oyberland and Unterland, see i) Uriel
Weinreich "Western Traits in Transcarpathian Yiddish" in the Festschrift
_For Max Weinreich_; and ii) M. Hutterer in _Field of Yiddish_ III.

I have a tape recording of Hutterer explicitly illustrating the
phonological differences between the two areas. The Atlas has recordings
of a couple of dozen native speakers of this rather unusual linguistic
area.

And, speaking of Womzi/Grajvi, as we were, perhaps you could elicit a
copy of that recording we spoke of. I called the person you referred me
to, thus far to no avail.

Subject: Zawel Kwartin

I guess I've been elected to be the local expert on Zawel Kwartin.

Kwartin was one of the pivotal luminaries of the Golden Age of Chazzanuth
(cantorial singing) in the 20's and 30's, whose center was not Warsaw or
Vilna, but New York; more of the great Cantors wound up there than not.

Zevulun (nickname "Zavel" in English orthography, "Sawel" in German,
"Zawel" in Polish) Kwartin was born in either Novoarkhangelsk, or
Chonorod (depending on your source) Ukraine, in 1874.  Apprenticed to a
bookbinder and a locksmith, he was working in the grain, feed, and
textile businesses with his family when his brother-in-law urged him to
become a Chazzan.  He first was discouraged from being a Chazzan, and
encouraged to seek opera and concert appearances.  A year after his
marriage at 22, he went to Vienna to study Chazzanuth.  He took a
position as Chazzan in 1898 in Yelizavetgrad.  He officiated in Vienna
and St. Petersburg, and for ten years at Budapest (he left Russia because
of the antisemitic atmosphere).  In 1919 he came to Temple Emanuel, Boro
Park, Brooklyn, and made his reputation and many recordings.  In 1926 he
moved to Israel.  He gave concerts and conducted services there, and
acquired property.  In 1937, he returned to the US and took a position in
Newark, New Jersey.  He published three volumes of cantorial
improvisations, -Zemiroth Zebulon- (1928, 1938), and an autobiography in
Yiddish, -Mein Leben- (1951), which seems pretty hard to find (I couldn't
at the Hebrew Teacher's College Library, Brookline/Boston).  He died in
either '52 or '53, depending on source.

So much for Encyclopaedia Judaica and the carefully-photocopied backs of
ancient record albums.  Kwartin, Josef Rosenblatt, and Mordecai Hershmann
were the three biggest names of the Golden Age of Chazzanuth.  There were
many others.  NY Jews of my parents' and grandparents' generations (in
the 20's and 30's) would admire and adulate these precentors as people do
today's rock stars.  Each had their own advocates and partisans.  While
Rosenblatt, surely the most famous (Jewish) Cantor of all time (I can
think of a more famous person who held that title in Leipzig once), was
without doubt the possessor of the most dazzling array of virtuosity and
techniques, I, for one, find much in Kwartin's recorded legacy I find
lacking in Rosenblatt's, and earnestness, directness, and
from-the-heartness which cuts right to my center.  Kwartin was a lyric
bass-baritone who sang with great strength, sincerity, and majesty,
sounding more like sincere Jewish prayer where Rosenblatt sounds more
like art music. Kurt List wrote in -Commentary- in 1946 that Kwartin had
"the best voice of the three and the best followed cantorial style."

There is plenty of Zawel Kwartin on record, although, like all recorded
Cantorial repertoire, shoddily-produced re-issues provide for much
disappointment.  In particular, the 1961 release "The Days of Awe"
(S'lichot, Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur selections) (surely a collection
of early 78's), Collector's Guild CG-620 (available on reissue tape but
wholly without the excellent documentation of the original), is rated (by
other recent CD liner notes!) as one of the most magnificent of all works
of recorded Cantorial art and still an inspiration to all aspiring
Chazzonim; it is surely my favorite of my many Cantorial recordings.  His
composition/rendition of the -very- theologically difficult Aramaic
S'lichoth prayer, "Moron d'Vishmayo" (which addresses the Deity as one
holding Israel hostage), starting on G in Basso and climbing up the G
minor scale with increasing fury and harmonic intensity is a
gut-wrenching piece worthy of any opera; His setting of Psalm 24
("L'Dovid Mismor") following, drenched in the pain and agony which are
the bitter fruit of the Diaspora, relates the plight of Jewry in
unmistakable musical terms.  Others of his most famous compositions fill
out the disk.  His "Umpnej Chatoeijnu", one no-less theologically
difficult text ("on account of our sins we were exiled from our land and
cannot pray in our Temple") appears on several collections, and once more
gives the feeling "this is what Chazzanuth is about," an ineffable
mixture of awe, fear, and sadness that arises only when Chazzanuth is
IMHO "done right."

Unlike Rosenblatt and Hershmann, Kwartin seems to have recorded no folk
songs or secular repertoire -- one thinks of Palestrina, Lasso, and the
intense mystic Victoria in almost the same relationship.  If Rosenblatt
was Nat King Cole, Kwartin was Ray Charles.

OK, you get the idea, I really like the work of Zawel Kwartin and have
collected quite a bit of it.

I will be incommunicado for about a week, and will not be able to follow
up on this discussion until then, so keep it warm for me.  For a
discussion of "why is this style of Chazzonuth no longer popular", wait
until then.  Anyone with more info or corrections or improvements or even
first-hand recollections, please contribute...
