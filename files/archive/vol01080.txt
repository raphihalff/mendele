re calves' foot aspic, in my house it was always 'fisl'.
the word 'ptsche' (rhymes with 'feh', which was my opinion
of the dish) was known but not used. i never heard
'ptscha'.

re the nuts and honey candy, it was 'nuent' chez moi. two
syllables. 

as long as we're on food terms, how about some ENGLISH
ones? i have no idea what the following fowl parts are
called in english (since no one has served them to me since
i've upward-mobilized into english): gorgl and pupik. and
of course tukhes, tho i could figure that one out.

stuffed cabbage was kholeptshes. (first vowel as in
'hull'.)

here's a yinglish one: what's the singular of 'lozenges'?
on my block it was pronounced 'lozengeh', three syllables.

other food questions. where is the turkish connection from?
i used to think 'halvah' was a yiddish word (of course it
is, but...). and why was turkish delight (aka loukoum) so
big in brooklyn? as were dried apricots and figs and dates
etc. i asked a polish (gentile) colleague once if these
things were popular in warsaw and he said of course--but
you had to go to a jewish neighborhood to buy them... did
jews shlep these maykholim all thru their wanderings from
the middle east? or did they discover them only when they
were already in eastern europe, thru trade with turkey?

Which reminds me of the hazan who - in training his
choir - tells them how to sing "l'chodo dika la."
 
And since we are talking about food, could anyone
help me with the origins of the term _parva_ or
_parve_?
 
And since I am asking for the origins of a word
associated with religious practice, how about the
origins of _daven_ [pray]?
 
Before my associations take me too far astray, I
will sign off.

Introduction:

I was born in Berlin, Germany, grew up in the United States
and live in Jerusalem since 1967.  I am married to Robert
Werman, Professor of Neurophysiology at the Hebrew
University. We have four children.  I have a Ph.D. in
English Literature and Jewish Studies [my dissertation,
much of which is published in MILTON STUDIES, deals with
the midrashic sources of _Paradise Lost_].  During the
trial of Ivan Demjanjiuk, which was broadcast live on
Israel TV, I developed an interest in Yiddish and in
preserving Yiddish literature, the only surviving remnant
of the rich Jewish life that had existed in Eastern Europe.
I have since published translations of stories by Peretz
[in the PARTISAN REVIEW and in _A Peretz Reader_, ed. Ruth
Wisse] and have translated an entire book of Anski:
stories, history, folklore and a new translation of _The
Dybbuk_, which will soon be published by Schocken Press.  I
teach Yiddish in English Translation at the Hebrew
University.
