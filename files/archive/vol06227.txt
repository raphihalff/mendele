Subject: Di mezinke oysgegebn

The song referred to is by Mark M. Warshavsky (varshavski) and appears in
Ruth Rubin's "A Treasury of Jewish Folksong" (p. 104, Schocken Folio Edition,
1964) with the following introduction:

"Morris (Mark) Warshavsky (1848-1907), 'discovered' by Sholom Aleichem, is
author both of text and tune of this song. He was a true folk poet and
composer; most people are unaware even today that he was author and composer
of so many of their beloved songs. Some of these are: _Oyfn pripetshek brent
a fayerl, Der becher, Dos lid fun broyt, Der zeyde mit der bobe (or Achtsig
er un zibetsig zi), Dem milner's trern._"

The song also appears (with one verse missing in the Yiddish, but retained in
the singable English translation by Henry Goodman) in _lomir kinder
zingen_Let's Sing a Yiddish Song, Kinderbuch Publications, NY 1970. I'm sure
it's available in many other collections.

Subject: Tevye's quotations (see Shul memories)

As for David Herskovic's [6.224] and Louis Fridhandler's [6.226] discussion of
a typical mangling by Tevye of Rashi, contrary to Mr. Fridhandler, you don't
have to te a buki b'shas to find it. Rashi always makes his comments right
after the text, in this case Shmois 20:3, and the text says exactly that. Im
b'gapoy yovoy, b'gapoy yeytsey (if he comes by himself he goes by himself).
But what Rashi says has nothing to do with Teyve's mistranslation -- that's
of the posik itself. Rashi simply explains that if he's unmarried when he
comes, he goes out the same way. The humor is in the fact that Tevye thinks
the posik reads, "Im m'geyfo yovoi, m'geyfo yeytsey" and that's how he
(mis)translates it: If he comes with a m'geyfo (plague) he leaves with a
plague. In writing the difference between b'gapoy and m'geyfo is one letter,
the first one.

The quotation, "M'zanavto d'chazirto loy machant shtreimilto" is worth
quoting in its entirety. Tevye attributes it to what Onkelos had to say about
Lovon Ho-Arami (a paskudnyak from the word go) and then he says that the
fellow he's addressing "kukt er oyf mir vi a hon in Bney Odom".

Now that's what you call a geshmakn Idish and the question is, how many
Mendelenikes know what it means? David Herskovic probably, although being
modern if he shlogs kaporo at all he probably does it with money. And the
point is that when reciting Bney Odom nothing has happened to the poor
chicken yet: he's just hanging in someone's hand waiting for it to happen.
What about Louis Fridhandler, does he know what it means? I'd bet a hard
round dollar he does, but I'd bet the same mayontek that 90% of Mendelenikes
don't. And that goes to show what I've been saying all along: you can have
Idishkayt without Idish, but you can't have Idish without Idishkayt -- at
least not the kind Sholom Aleichem writes.

Subject: Scholem Asch and bullfighting?

I wonder if this list can help me with my problem. I am currently working on
Hemingway's Death in the Afternoon (1932). Towards the end of this book, in a
chapter detailing "Some Reactions of a Few Individuals to the Integral
Spanish Bullfight," Hemingway mentions S.A.

S. A. is described as an "Internationally famous novelist writing in Yiddish.
Had luck to see excellent bullfight his first time in Madrid--declared there
was no emotion comparable in intensity except first sexual intercourse."

A few people have suggested that S.A. is Scholem Asch. I wonder if you agree?
My problem is that in order to make a plausible identification I need
evidence: evidence that Asch was in Spain, that he saw a bullfight, or that
he made remarks of any sort about bullfights.

Any help, including suggestions for further reading, would be much
appreciated.
