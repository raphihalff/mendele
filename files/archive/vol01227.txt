Subject: re matzah bray

Our matzah bray was good for a cool morning, but it really
is not for Californi a or past the age of 40, when a person
should, as the French say, know what is proper to eat and
what is not. matzah broken in pieces, soaked in water to
soft en, then simply fried in butter with a mixture of
scrambled eggs, nicely pepper ed and salted, or paprika'ed
(my wife's hungarian side). a fluffy heavyish brea kfast
results, which children love,as a variant on pancakes, if
one troubles to make them after they are 10, etcetera.
Simple and easy, and it gets rid of the box of the usually
tasteless American matzah. (I prefer what they called matza
h in the ghetto of Rome, something more like, well, what
the fat euchraist brea d probably was before they made
miniportions for individual communicants, perha ps. A big
round platzl? LIke the 12 inche halo sized breads used in
an Armenian movie about he poet int he monastery I caught a
midnight last night on PBS loc ally. Static set of
pseudo-byzantine scenes, mixed with early Dali techniques fr
om the Chien andalou. Surrealism has been recently catching
on in East Europe, as I learned to my surprise in Bulgaria
(I have two big etchings brought back i n 1982 from Varna).
What a debacle for art that criminal society was! Anyway, t
here is your matzah brie/bray, without sweetness. Save the
prune jam, lekvar, for noodles, perhaps?

Subject: RE: the joke Davis tells

Joke about ham? Here is true story. I read it in ENCOUNTER
more than 2 decades ago. There was a first feeler towards
rapprochment between Madrid and the Jews, after Franco, and
the Mayor, or was it King and Mayor, held a great reception
in Madrid, with many dignataries invited, including the
grand rabbi of Scotland, I believe it may have been.
Someone very important, and sephardic of course. Many
speeches, preparing in advance for 1992, I guess, and
perhaps helping to undo some of the deep scarring of Opus
Dei perhaps under Franco, although that worldwide
pseudomasonic group may have been benevolent?
technocratic/banker/catholics?

At any rate after the formalities, a grand luncheon was
announced, the doors flung wide in the palace, and grand
rabbi led the procession. Suddenly a cry of horror rang
out: the entire company was halted in its tracks, the rabbi
flung himself backwards arms outstretched and was caught by
the Mayor and King, say, or Prime Minister. What had he
seen? A vast buffet table confronted him at the other end
of the grand room, and its centerpiece was a gigantic mogen
david made out of ice...and shrimp, lobster, crayfish,
eels, mussels, clams...you name it! As the essayist
remarked: nearly 500 years is a long time.

Subject: A question of importance

William Safire has a piece in today's New York Times
Magazine on the use of the word "suit" to connote an
Important Person. This, says he, is a metonymy since the
I.P. is identified by something he wears as distinguished
from a synecdoche where the part represents the whole.
Well and good.

I thought of writing him about a word that has intrigued me
for some time but bethought myself that since Safire's
Yiddish isn't all that ay-ay-ay while on Mendele we have
emesse meyvinim (he calls them mavens) both in Yiddish and
language generally.  Here's the question.

The expression "hoyekhe fenster" is without doubt a
metonymy and means pretty much the same as "suits".  But
what about "pney"?  Is it a true synecdoche?  My own guess
is that it isn't, that like "hoyekhe fenster" it's a
metonymy since it doesn't at all refer to "faces" but
rather to the likelihood that prominent people occupy the
most prominent seats as it were.  Does this make any sense?

There's a second request.  Would someone please sort out
the changes in meaning that the word has undergone from
biblical Hebrew to Yiddish and back to modern Hebrew?
