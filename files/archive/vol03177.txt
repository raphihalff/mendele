Subject: Bibliography

In response to Ellen Prince's solicitation of bibliography, I offer
the following notes.

	1. A. Zaretski, the foremost Soviet specialist on Yiddish
syntax, published two articles on the question of verb position in
the Yiddish sentence in the Kiev journal _Di yidishe shprakh_.  The
first, in no. 1 (March-April, 1927), was entitled "Tsu
Sholem-Aleykhems verter seyder" (pp. 5-10).  The second, in no. 3
(May-June 1928), bore the title "Tsu Mendeles verterseyder [sic]"
(pp. 19-26).  Zaretski shows that in the overwhelming majority of
the examples in his sample, the personal verb form occupies the
second position in the sentence, but cites examples in which the
verb occupies the first or even the third position (as in
exclamations like "Vi sheyn, vi likhtik dort iz!").  His conclusion
is that the subject requires more study, but that there are both
justifiable and unjustifiable deviations from the verb-second
principle.  (The "errors" are a problem in contemporary newspaper
practice; here Zaretski refers to his "bikhl" _Grayzn un sfeykes"
[Kiev, l927].)

	2. The late editor of the American _Yidishe shprakh_, Yudel
Mark, published an article entitled "Dos ort fun beygikn verb in dem
zats" in that journal (vol. 6 [1946], no. 1-2, pp. 1-14).  He also
points out that verb-second is the statistical norm, but verb-first
and verb-third are also normal in appropriate circumstances.  One
justification for verb-third is extra stress on the second element,
as in "Vos ER hot ibergelebt!"  Before introducing one set of
examples, Mark points to the importance of intonation and stress by
asking his readers to read the examples out loud:  "Mir betn bloyz
nit leyenen ot di vayterdike doygmes mit di oygn, nor zey aroysreydn
oyfn kol."

Subject: 'daytshmerizms'

just have to stick in my two cents. i agree with khaim that a bunch
of different things are going on under the rubric 'daytshmerizm'. as
i see it, there are:

1. orthographic influences of new high german: still occurs in the
classified ads in the forverts, for example, e.g. in the most recent
forverts, 12/17/93, p. 10, ad for palace hotel: shin-vov-he-lamed
for /shul/. (btw, the same ad has an english borrowing, baths,
spelled beys-alef-tes-he-samekh.)

2. self-conscious use or citation of nhg words not otherwise used in
yiddish, e.g. hokhtsayt in harkavy's earlier dictionary mentioned
previously.

3. nhg borrowings fully entrenched in central yiddish but unfamiliar
or at least marked in other varieties of eastern yiddish, e.g. kuzin,
tante, le(y)zn, geve(y)zn, onkl, aynladn, yetst, etc etc etc. since
most 'grammarians' of yiddish were not of this dialect, they seem to
have had trouble distinguishing this class from type-2 hokhtsayt-type
borrowings. as the grandchild of a very simple polish jew who left
his goat and chickens in his village and came to america in 1890 at
the age of 14, where he was hitched to a pushcart on the lower east
side, and who barely knew the latin alphabet, much less german, i
find it alternately amusing and infuriating that his lexicon should
be labeled 'daytsmerish' by the litvak and bukovine mavens. the fact
is that new high german was a coterritorial/contact language for
much of the area where central yiddish was spoken (e.g. all of the
austro-hungarian empire) and there was lots of movement back and
forth (e.g. i recently learned that my other grandfather was born in
hamburg of polish-jewish parents; they moved to slovakia when he was
a small child), and you find the same sort of borrowing from german
in this area that you find from other coterritorial languages in
other areas. to all those who are STILL ranting and raving about
these borrowings, i'd like to quote my students and say: 'get a
life!'

Subject: Jewish languages

For an opening lecture for an adult education course on "Yiddish
language and culture" I would like to give a brief overview of other
jewish languages such as Ladino, Judeo-arabic, Judeo-persian etc.

I would be grateful for suggested references.

(My knowledge to date is based on Weinreich's chapter in his
"history of the Yiddish language"}
