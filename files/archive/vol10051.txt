Subject: Project Onkelos: call for volunteers

Our effort to bring modern and readable copies of the Yiddish classics
continues.  We now have about a dozen stories on the Web, the English
translations of which are found in Howe and Greenberg's _A Treasury of
Yiddish Stories_. http://shakti.trincoll.edu/~mendele/onkyid.htm

We could of course continue at a faster rate if there were more people
willing to transcribe (romanize) texts for conversion back into
Yiddish--which seems a clumsy way of doing things though experience
suggests otherwise. If you think you may be interested, please write
nmiller@trincoll.edu or lprager@research.haifa.ac.il for further
details.

Subject: Weinreich quote

"A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot"

It is from a speech Max Weinreich gave in honor of the 20th anniversary
of
YIVO, titled "Der Yivo un di problemen fun undzer tsayt" published in
Yivo
Bleter, bd. 25, num. 1 (Yanuar-Februar, 1945) p. 13. He is telling
an anecdote about a course of lectures he was giving at YIVO in 1944
and:

"Eyn mol nokh a lektsye geyt er [a student] tsu tsu mir un fregt: 'Vos
iz
der khilek fun a dialekt biz a shprakh?'  Ikh hob gemeynt, az es ruft
zikh
op in im der maskilisher bitul, un hob im gepruvt aroyffirn oyfn
rikhtikn veg, nor er hot mikh ibergerisn: 'Dos veys ikh, ober ikh vel
aykh gebn a besere definitsye: A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un
flot".

Subject: Books in Yiddish on prosody

Regarding Sholem Berger's inquiry about books in Yiddish on prosody
(Mendele Vol 10.048) - I own a copy of Nokhm Stutchkof's "Yidisher
Gramen-Leksikon"  with the English title "Yiddish Rhyming Lexicon."  It
was published in 1931 and I was fortunate enough to find it at the
Workmen's Circle book store in New York. Although it is essentially a
Yiddish rhyming dictionary it does have an extensive 26 page Yiddish
introduction wherein Stutchkof discusses metrical structure in relation
to
Yiddish verse.

Concerning Sholem Berger's query [10.048], see _The Field of Yiddish_
(1954), edited by Uriel Weinreich. It includes the following, possibly
relevant, articles:

"Stress and Word Structure in Yiddish," by Uriel Weinreich;
"On Free Rhythms in Yiddish Poetry," by Benjamin Hrushovski.

From: Leonard Prager <lprager@research.haifa.ac.il>
Subject: Bohemian Yiddish

In reply to Peter Melman's query in _Mendele_ 10:049, Item 7, my first
request is that he not use the confusing term "shtetl-ized yiddish."

Two standard sources on Bohemian Yiddish are listed in Uriel and
Beatrice
Weinreich's well known _Yiddish Language and Folklore_ bibliography
(found
in many Judaica libraries)

Beranek, F. [Yiddish in Czechoslovakia]. _Yivo-Bleter_ 9 (1936), 63-75.

Pavel Trost, "Yiddish in Bohemia and Moravia: The Vowel Question,"
_Field
of Yiddish_, The Hague, 1965, 87-91.

Trost writes

 : 'In Bohemia and Moravia Yiddish continued to be spoken after the
legal
opening of the ghettoes, in 1848.  It is said to have still been spoken
at
the beginning of this century by a small number of old people in some
country towns. The mass of Bohemian and Moravian Jews by this time spoke

only standard German or Czech; however, most of them still knew, and
sometimes used, a great many "jargon" words and phrases.' [p. 87]

By "jargon" -- in quotation marks -- Trost either means 'Yiddish' in a
neutral sense , the term _zhargon_ having been a common name for Yiddish

for many decades, or -- more likely -- is alluding to the pejorative
attitude of many towards the language.

Subject: Levi Yitzchak's kaddish?

Hi -

I'm wondering whether any Mendelyaner could help me locate the Yiddish
text of the kaddish of Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev.  I'm interested in
two
things:  first, in a high-minded way, I'd like to know where to find it,

bibliographically;  second, more urgently, I'd love to have a copy by
this
Friday!  So if anyone's feeling very generous, and has access to this
text, and would be willing to type it into a message either to Mendele
or
to me (lrosenwald@wellesley.edu), I'd be most, most grateful.

A sheynem dank,
Larry Rosenwald

Subject: the song "her nur Gotinyu"

I am looking for the text of the song that starts:

"her nur Gotinyu
ikh wil mit dir epes reden
Es zol mir unshtein der zkhis fin daynem zegen.
Vus ikh bin geshtorben oif kidesh hashem
bin ikh zefriden
un far dem zkhis fin daine kinderlekh..."

My mother in law heard this song from her brother in Berlin, around
1932.
Does anybody remember or know the origin and the complete song?

Many thanks for her

Sabine (Sabina) Cohn-Piltz
