They said it couldn't be done! A record of children's songs that didn't
include "Afn Pripechik" or "Yome, Yome" but they were wrong! "Grine Katshke"
(The Green Duck) is a wonderful new CD of Yiddish songs for children, all on
an animal theme. There is no need for discussions about whether these
singers--Paula Teitelbaum, Lorin sklamberg, Adrienne Cooper, Henry Sapoznick,
and a delightful group of Yiddish-speaking (not just singing) children can
pronounce Yiddish correctly!  They can!  The material is fresh and lively and
the style is a wonderful mix of authentic and original. You don't have to be a
kid to enjoy the Grine Katshke, you just have to be young at heart!

[Moderator's note: those interested in automotive Yiddish should visit our
fellow Mendelist Andrey Bredstein's page at
http://www.glasnet.ru/~anbredstein/text/avto/avto.htm

Also a book translated from Russian might be useful:
Mikhail Il'in, Viazoy der avtomobil hot zikh gelernt geyn / Moskve: Tsentraler
felker-farlag fun F.S.S.R., 1931

BTW, should it be "gelernt geyn" or "gelernt forn<furn>"?

Subject: Oyto-avto-auto.

My recent excursus into automotive terminology reminded me of the difference
in the standard rendering of the prefix auto- between the Soviet and YIVO
styles: oytomobil=avtomobil, oytobus=avtobus, oytor=avtor, oytograf=avtograf,
oytomatish=avtomatish (but oyto-da-fe=autodafe, oytentish=autentish). It
comes to the point when Boris Sandler exploits the word "oytogen" for the
Russian "avtogen" (meaning autogenous cutter, "Erev dem groysn yontev",
Forverts, may 8, 1998), which I'm sure he pronounces as in Russian.

The issue may be broader, though. Some other words fall in the same ballpark:
yanuar=yanvar, oygust=avgust, astronoyt=astronavt (Forverts habitually uses
"astronot"), cosmonavt, argonavt, oystralye=avstralye, etc. Here there is even
less consensus, for N.Stutchkoff lists "aeronavt", not "aeronoyt". 

V - tsvey vovn, rather than U - vov, obviously reflects a Slavic influence,
but it looks that all the native speakers, who did not study in either
secular prewar Poland or Arbeter ring schools, do tend to pronounce V - tsvey
vovn. (My father, who went to the Yiddish school in Czernowitz till it was
closed in 1948 "po pozhelaniyam trudyashchikhsya" - "by the working people's
requests" - was instructed to use V: avtoportret and yanvar.)  Moreover, in
dialectal speech avto- remains unchanged, despite the usual metamorphosis of
Slavic words to make them more palatable for Jewish tongues. Except for the
written language, Yiddish speakers do not seem to be uncomfortable with avto
(otherwise they would have adjusted it naturally). 

The thing is also complicated in Russian, - some words (usually older
borrowings) use avto-, while other (newer borrowings) - auto-:  avtonomiya,
avtoklav, avtoritet, avtoportret, avtograf; but autotrening, autogennaya
trenirovka, autopsiya, autoimunnyye zabolevaniya; some exist in both forms -
avtokhtonnyy=autokhtonnyy.  Avto- may sometimes sound archaic, e.g.  Leon
Pinsker's famous brochure "Avtoemansipatsiya" (in contemporaneous Russian
translation) now would be called "Autoemansipatsiya".

So, what exactly were the considerations in choosing between the two variants?

Subject: Meire

Chaim Lieberman addresses the origin of the word "meire" in one of his volumes
of "Ohel Rokhel."  (I believe it is in volume two.)  Firstly, "meira" is a
word used strictly in the process of baking matses.  Each new batch of kneeded
dough (made every 18 minutes) is called a "meire."  Lieberman mentions a
rabbinical source which states that the origin of the word "meire" is from the
Hebew "m'heiro," meaning "quickly" - as the matses need to be needed and baked
very quickly.

Subject: maireh

My guess is that the word "maireh" is derived from the Hebrew "ma'arokh"  (mem
'ayn resh vav khaf) meaning rolling-pin or (occasionally)  rolling-board and
is borrowed in the baking trade to refer to the batch of dough that is rolled
out. (A pot of soup refers to the soup, not the pot.) In Yiddish, it would be
pronounced "mairekh" and should be spelled as in Hebrew. I suppose that the
guttural ending and the Hebrew spelling evaporated at some point. 

I checked a few Yiddish dictionaries in the sparse collection (=2) at the
Weizmann Institute library, but could not find the word 'maireh' in any
spelling. I assume from what you wrote in your query that the spelling on the
matza box was phonetic (mem yod yod resh 'ayn). Right?

Subject: chalah and maireh

As far as I know (probably not very much) the word mayre is used only in
connection with baking matses, and means a dough. (Traditionally matse is
made from small batches of dough, not exceeding about 4/5 lbs of flour, so
that they can be handled easily. Nowadays with machinery things are
different.)

Subject: Schlemiel

Just after the emancipation of the Jews of Germany, a stock character called
schlemiel was developed or created by those Jews as a focus for negative
attitudes towards them.  He became a stock comic character, the butt of a
satire, a scapegoat. 

In the opera "The Tales of Hoffmann" by the Jewish composer Jacques Offenbach,
the character "Schlemiel" (with accent over the first "e")  appears briefly
only to have his shadow stolen. 

Until recently, I knew of the word's use only in Yiddish; i.e., a dolt, a
fool, a nebbisch, an idiot. 

Is it possible that the adoption of the term by the German Jews of the 1860s
might have come about by their choice of a Yiddish word, or does this word
have no Yiddish origin at all? 

I'm doing an article for a magazine on antisemitism in Wagner's operas
specifically, but the presence of this term in "Tales of Hoffmann" (which is
derived from three stories by E.T.A. Hoffmann)  caused me to explore other
composers besides Wagner.  And I am wondering about the use of Schlemiel and
why that name was taken for that specific character.

Subject: Adrabe - Aramaic or Hebrew? 

The word adrabe is clearly not Hebrew. If nothing else, the initial pasakh
aleph  followed by -de- gives it away.

You can find this in numerous places in shas - spelt with a final aleph.

I was very intrigued by Mikhl Herzog's description of the name "feygele"
as coming from a flower [08.003]: could he tell us more?  thanks
