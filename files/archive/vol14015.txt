Subject: Re: prost un grob

Is gemeyn truly in the middle between prost and grob?  An examination of a
German dictionary gives its meaning as "vulgar, nasty, mean, dirty." Harkavy
gives its meaning "base and mean."  Weinreich says, "vokhedik." If you were
going to be eydl or gebildet in your discourse would you use gemeyn instead
of prost or grob or vokhedik?

I would personally opt for the German use of the word in that it isn't class
ridden.  A very sophisticated, gebildet, well spoken person can be mean and
base and not at all vokhedik.  To call someone a vokhediker yid has in it
the assumption that eydlkeyt only comes about on shabes when one doffs the
weekly garb for the shabes costume.  Does what one has in his heart change
on shabes?

Subject: Re: prost un grob

Just to add to Reb Noyekh's discussion (Mendele 14.014), the word "grob"
always had negative social connotations to my grandmother, even in seemingly
innocuous usages. What immediately comes to mind is my grandmother's dislike
of "grobe lokshn," which referred to noodles that were thick and/or wide.
Leaving aside the fact that thick noodles can be a bit chewy, what we all
understood from this comment was that homemade or "homemade-style" noodles
were inelegant, not refined. Thin noodles were classier than "grobe"
noodles. In expressing her preference for thin noodles, my grandmother was
marking (or, trying to mark) a social distinction. (She also used "grob" to
refer to other uncouth foods, such as tsholnt.)

Noyekh Miller makes a very interesting and nuanced distinction between prost
and grob (Volume 14 number 14).  Stutchkoff sort of lumps them both together
under the entry UMEYDLKEYT (Der Oytser fun der Yidisher Shprakh, page 632,
entry # 557.)  As nouns he offers such synonyms as shlekht dertsoygener,
grober nefesh, grober yung, vilde tskig, and barbar. In his adjective column
Stutchkoff lists (among others) taktloz, hart, umgalant, umkultivirt,
umtsivilizirt, berish, klotsik, eydl vi in yatke, eydl vi a kneydl, prost vi
a balegole, un azoy vayter.  While Stutchkoff is all-encompassing and often
humorous Miller offers subtle shading and gradations.

Subject: Re: pareve

[In response to Meyer Zaremba's query, Mendele 14.013]

Professor Herbert H. Paper once suggested that etymologically pareve may be
related to French pareil ("same, similar"; the final L is not pronounced as
an L but as a y glide). Other Romance words in Yiddish also occur in the
religious sphere: bentshn, tsholnt, orn ("to pray" in Western Yiddish),
leyenen (which would include reading from the Torah). In modern French,
c'est pareil is commonly used to mean "it doesn't matter which one."

Subject: Construction with 'ton'

I was wondering if anyone had information on the following construction:

ton + [infinitive]

where ton ("do") is used as a helping verb before an infinitive.

It does not seem to be very common at all, but I have seen it in a couple
different places. One is the song Dona, Dona:

bidne kelber tut men bindn,
un men shlept zey un men shekht.

Itsik Manger uses it twice in a row in "Vashti's Kloglid" in Megile-Lider:

kh'hob im nisht gefolgt,
kh'hob im nisht gehert,
itst tu ikh lign
nayn eyln in dr'erd.

kh'hob im nisht gefolgt,
itst tu ikh batsoln.
farnemts mayn geveyn,
ir berg un ir toln!

Does anyone know about the origin, meaning (as opposed to just using the
verb), or acceptability of this construction?

A dank,

Yakov Blum

Subject: forts in rosl

When I first heard the word "rosl" mentioned it fell from blessed
grandmother's lips as "er dreyt zikh arum vi a forts in rosl."  Does anyone
else know of the expression and how does it relate to the meaning of "rosl."

Subject: James Cagney's Yiddish

I've often heard that James Cagney spoke Yiddish fluently and I always
thought that to be somewhat of an exaggeration.  So when I recently acquired
two of Cagney's old films on video I was astonished to hear him engage in
two brief Yiddish conversations with total ease and rapid-fire fluidity.  In
fact the rapidity with which he delivered the lines made me want to replay
them a dozen or so times so that I could write them down with as much
accuracy as possible.  I believe I was able to transcribe them with at least
95% accuracy.  I would be grateful to hear from anyone who has a more
complete or accurate text of what I'm about to reveal.

In the 1932 film "Taxi" a man anxious to get to Ellis Island to meet a
recent arrival approaches a cab being driven by Cagney.  Man (breathlessly):
"Ikh muz zikh aylen un geyn arunter tsu Elis Aylend!"  Cagney (poking his
head out the window):  "Shvay, Shvayg!  Ikh farshtey!  Vilst geyn tsu Elis
Aylend.  Di vayb iz do??"  Man:   " Vo den! - (With surprise) Bist a
yidisher yung!?" Cagney -  " Nu vos den - a sheygets!?  Khap zikh arayn."
The man quickly enters the taxi.

The second film is "The Fighting 69th" [1940]  A group of World War 1
recruits are in formation for inspection and Cagney is standing next to a
short Jewish soldier who just finished telling the sergeant that his name is
Murphy.  Sergeant "Did you say your name is Murphy?"   Jewish Soldier:  "I
did your worship; save in your presence."  Sergeant:  "What were you born?"
Soldier:  "I was born a boy!"  The sergeant walks away in disgust to peals
of laughter from the other soldiers.  Cagney (turning to the soldier next to
him):   " Vos veys er!  Er veyst fun gornisht!" Soldier: "Vos veyst er - er
iz der balebos!"  Cagney:  "Nisht far mayn gelt!"  While this may come
across rather trite in print it is refreshingly cool to watch Cagney as the
words come trippingly on the tongue in a glatik, varem, heymish yidish!
