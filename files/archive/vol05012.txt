Subject: More about "melupm kind"

Re: final n>m

I am a physics major who has been dabbling with languages since about
birth, having been raised in a yinglish speaking house with many
[puertorrican] spanish [spanglish] speaking babysitters and family
friends.  Anyways...about the final -n becoming -m, I think it is
probably due to some kind of post-bilabial assimilation of the
syllabicated nasal "-n".  This exact same phenomenon is found in the
speech of most Germans, as in the word "haben" usually pronounced "habm",
and by some simply "haamm" [say two m's there...] This at least is my
analysis of their pronunciation, as best I can approximate it via ascii.
As far as m before t becoming n, I think that is quite a common occurence
in every language...even in english, where, especially within words, a
nasal preceding [especially] a stop [whether voiced or not], assimilates
to that stop.  [In english, I believe it is particularly common for the
following stop to disappear if the stop is voiced.] Enough of my
conjecture.

Subject: Yiddish at Yad Vashem

I recently received a packet of brochures, a letter, and a membership
card requesting that I join the American Society for Yad Vashem. Since
the letter was written by a Mr. Ben Lerman, I returned the application
and membership card explaining why I felt that I could not join this
organization at this time, and I enclosed my translation of Dovid Braun's
letter on the subject of Yiddish at Yad Vashem which appeared in Oyfn
Shvel, No.297, P.19, Jan-March, 1995.  I think all Mendelniks should be
made aware of this remarkable letter which I would like to post here and
now. (Dovid has graciously not only agreed to my posting of his letter,
but he has also supplied me with background material and a transliteration
of his Yiddish version.)

First, some background.  A number of issues ago, _Afn Shvel_ printed a
letter by historian Dr. Adina Cimet de Singer as an editorial.  In this
letter, Dr. Singer, a native speaker of Yiddish from Mexico and mother of
two young girls whom she is raising in Yiddish, expressed her outrage
over the fact that,upon a recent family visit to Yad Vashem, her family
could not go on a guided tour of the grounds conducted in Yiddish because
such did not exist, nor was there any willingness to provide it or to
realize the value of such a service if it were made available.  (Guided
tours were available in a whole host of other languages, including
English, French, German, Hebrew, etc.)  A subsequent issue presented a
letter in response by an anonymous writer who stated that the "Language
War" (i.e. between Hebrew and Yiddish) was over, and one dare not rock
the boat, i.e. the issue should not even be brought up.  Dr. Singer's
reply was printed thereafter, to which Braun's letter is a further reply.
Herewith, Braun's text:

With regard to Dr. Adina Cimet de Singer's summons [_Afn Shvel_ No.291,
pp.1-2; No. 295, pp. 19-20] not to exclude Yiddish from Yad Vashem, allow
me to add the following to her rebuttal to the anonymous critic:  The
very existence of Yad Vashem is based on ideology, philosophy, ethics,
symbolism, morality -- that is to say, "non-practical things".  No one
was forced to erect a memorial to the victims of the Holocaust for
"practical" reasons, let alone a whole institute dedicated to them.  This
was purely an act of the spirit.

As such, the question is then: how is Yad Vashem fulfilling its spiritual
duty if it denies a certain segment of Jewry access to the Holocaust,
namely, Yiddish-speaking Jews?

Of course one might argue that all contemporary speakers of Yiddish know
some other language anyhow, so one may ignore Yiddish.  Then a further
question arises: how is Yad Vashem fulfilling its spiritual duty when it
discriminates (even if "only" symbolically) against the language of those
murdered (whose memory it is Yad Vashem's goal to preserve) and against
their heirs -- us?

Herewith is Braun's original Yiddish text:

In shaykhes mit Dr. Adina Tsimet Zingers ruf [_Afn shvel_ 291: 1-2;
295:19-20] nit oystsushlisn yidish fun Yad-vashem, derloybt mir tsu
derleygn ot vos tsu ir opentfer dem anonimen kritiker:

Di etsem eksistents fun Yad-vashem iz bazirt af idealogye, filosofye,
etik, simbolik, moral -- s'heyst: "nit keyn praktishe zakhn".  Keyner iz
nit geven geneyt tsulib "prakishe" taymim uftsushteln an ondenk di
korbones fun khurbm -- shoyn opgeredt fun a gantsn institut.  Dos iz
hoyle rukhnies. Un vi bald az rukhnies, fregt zikh:  vi azoy derfilt der
yad-vashem zayn gaystike ufgabe, az er farshtelt dem tsutrit tsum khurbm
far a teyl yidn, dehayne:  yidish-reydndike?

Ay, ale yidish-reydndike yidn kenen ba hayntikn tog an ander loshn say
vi, meg men bekheyn ignorirn yidish?  Fregt zikh vayter:  vi azoy zhe
derfilt der yad-vashem zayn gaystike ufgabe, az er diskriminirt (afile
ven "nor" simbolish) kegn dem loshn fun di umgekumene (vemens ondenk s'iz
dokh zayn tsil uftsuhitn) un kegn zeyere yorshim -- undz?

I also indicated to Mr. Lerman that I would consider joining the society
if it would take steps to correct this mistake in a proper and suitable
manner.  If any Mendelniks would like to add their voice to Dovid's and
mine, they can write to the chairman of the American Society for Yad
Vashem, Mr. Eli Zborowski, 48 W. 37th St. - 9th Floor, New York, N.Y.
