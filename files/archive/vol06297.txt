Subject: Transliteration and pronunciation

A brief note about the CONtroversy (in England it is pronounced
conTROVersy) about Yiddish transliteration and pronunciation.  I
resonate with Zellig Bach's insistence (6.296,2) on mentsh (Yiddish)
rather than mensch (German). I am appalled when I note that error,
especially around Yom Hashoah.

A recent disappointment:  I attended a service marking Yom Hashoah.
Despite the fact that the Yiddish words to the Partisan Song (Zog nit
keynmol... ) were included in the liturgy, they were unceremoniously
skipped without comment.  It was especially hurtful in light of the
fact that about two thirds of the Jewish victims of the Nazis were
steeped in Yiddish language and culture.  Yom Hashoah is a time when
the memory of those missing Yiddish speakers (and teachers and
transmitters of Yiddish culture) should be marked. Pronunciation
matters little then.

Many Yiddish words allow for more than one correct pronunciation .
Probably, all languages accept more than one pronunciation style.
E.g., both English pronunciations of controversy are considered
correct.  By the same token, so are alternative pronunciations in
Yiddish.  Still, use of the YIVO system of transliteration, widely
published, makes sense as a tool facilitating communication among us
with the Roman alphabet.  This has again become relevant through
recent inquiries on Mendele.

On a lighter note: Leonard Prager's story (6.296,4) about "The khreyn
in Spain is mainly on the plane" reminded me of Professor 'enry
'iggins, and the two actors who have portrayed him in movies.  The
Jewish Leslie Howard (the first movie Professor Higgins) might have
been able to pronounce khreyn correctly, and may have had some
experience with this bitter herb.  Now, what about Rex Harrison and
his unfamiliarity with this tangy condiment.  Would he have sung to a
Latin beat in his Queen's English, "This pain from khreyn is rather
inhumane"?

Subject: The English Forward and Yiddish

Zellig Bach [6.296] criticizes the English Forward for the
transliterations in it Personals ads. I'd like to ask him which
newspaper, in any language, corrects the spelling in Personals ads?
(I'd like to know so I can make sure never to read them...)

As for the transliterations in the English Forward's own articles, I
am much more struck by one *English* word the writers seem to love, a
word I've never seen anywhere else: _big_ as a singular noun, as in
_Pentagon Big Investigated_. I suspect this is a loan translation of
_groyser_ -- alas, English doesn't work that way... But it's not
without a certain charm... ;)

Subject: The English Forward and Yiddish

The recent posting on the "maiming" of Yiddish by the English Forward
[6.296] brings me to voice a concern about another kind of maiming of
Yiddish that goes far beyond adherence to Romanization rules but goes
far deeper. There are occasions, most notably at a Holocaust related,
perhaps Yom Hashoah services where there may be a token or more than
token Yiddish song or poem inserted. Sometimes the pronunciation is a
bit off, but that is understandable and forgivable; perhaps there are
children performing, it is cute or moving. Meyle.

But---I attended one event fairly recently where the Yiddish sung
might as well have been Chinese, and it didn't seem to matter to the
audience. It was as if Yiddish was a made up language and so one could
do with it what one pleased without any sense that this attitude might
give offense. And this was not some small event in an out of the way
place!

A solution?

What I recommend is that those involved in organizing events that use
Yiddish be sure to call on someone who really knows the language to
help the singers or speakers not only with pronunciation but also to
understand the meanings of the words. Call people to task when they
mangle the language. I am not speaking about dialects or the
occasional grammatical blip but serious mangling.

Un far undzere Yidish reders, es vet zayn a flikht az mir vos kenen
Yidish zoln tsuhelfn un zikh araynmishn vu men ken.

Shtoltsirn mit di shprakh.

Subject: The English Forward and Yiddish

I also used to be puzzled by the uncouth or sloppy Yiddish
transliterations in the Forward until I realized that they are
continuing in the tradition of the original Forverts which always
scorned calls for refining their orthography and avoiding
Yinglishisms, in favor of championing the Man In The Street and his
street Yiddish.  This "in your face" attitude towards Yiddish is of a
piece with the English Forward's nauseating mix of high-flying values
and vile yellow journalism. I have noticed letters to the editor in
the past on the subject of their treatment of Yiddish.  As with the
constant barrage of letters repudiating their reporting, don't hold
your breath for any change real soon.

Subject: The English Forward and Yiddish

Due to a technical error, the _last_ word of the subject line of my
recent post (6.296.2) was lost, and should have read in its entirety
"The English _Forward_ maims Yiddish _Words_ (and not "maims
Yiddish").

My intent was specific and, in this instance, delimited to a word
("kinderle" without the lange-khof at the end), and not generalized to
Yiddish as language.

Such a generalization would have been totally unjustified in this
case.
