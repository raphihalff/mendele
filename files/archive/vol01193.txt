Subject: Yiddish Music Anthology

I have an anthology of Yiddish music called "Yiddish
Anthology" Vols I-IV which contains everything from Nechama
Lifschitz to Paul Robeson(!). Where it originally came from
I do not know, but I heard that it was from Hebrew
University.

I would love to get the original, pay the appropriate
person rather than continue to enjoy my purloined copy,
etc. Also, the quality on mine is pretty bad, including, I
think, a 50 cps to 60 cps speedup that results in poor Ms
Lifschitz sounding like a bird.

Does anyone know what anthology this might be?

Thanks a lot.

Subject: Introduction

I am Associate Professor of Communication, NY State
University College at Buffalo.  I teach college students
how to stand up in front of an audience and not embarrass
themselves or the audience.  I also teach them how to
program computers (as a secondary appointment).

I grew up in a home where Yiddish was spoken, and they
spoke it to me, but did not bother to teach it to me.  I
learned to understand enough that I could tell if I was in
trouble and the nature of that trouble so that I could
refute it; but I refuted it in English. I joined the list
to learn.

In Joshua A. Fishman's _Yiddish:  Turning to Life_ (1991,
John Benjamins, Philadelphia) the author has an article
which addresses the questions:  what are the reasons and
what is the significance of the switch from printing
Yiddish in vaybertaytsh to printing Yiddish in oysyes
meruboes ('square letters', loshn-koydesh letters)?

"der orl iz meyvn beloshn" ('the goy understands [our
Germanic] language [= Yiddish]') is usually the formula
that introduces the switch into this code. But is the code
actually called _targem-loshn_?  I think it's referred to
as _loshn-koydesh_ (another formula, I think, is:  "lomir
dabern loshn-koydesh").  Naturally it's not real
loshn-koydesh.

ikh tsi tsurik, ikh tsi tsurik!  I take it back, bad
hypothesis!  (Was this your attempt at a purim-gram, by the
way?)

ven ikh volt ober geven an akshn... I'd say that notice
most of these /u/#-words (i.e., the /u/ is at the end of
the word) are not nouns, so maybe it's marked with nouns?
Or maybe ikh drey mitn grobn finger.  Be that as it may,
what struck me and motivated me to look for an answer from
phonology was the following:  have you ever heard
English-speaking kids imitate Chinese? (Or, as a native
English-speaker yourself, do an imitation of Chinese.)
Some of the most favorite consonants are /sh/, /tsh/ and
/j/ and as for vowels -- /u/.  (A Yiddish song which
imitates Chinese [and would now be deemed politically
incorrect] begins "tshing tshang tshu / ver veys vu", from
a children's poem written by Rifke Galin.)  Somehow I feel
the combination evokes something in English which _Joe_,
_cat_, or _negotiate_ don't.  Something foreign, something
marked, something je ne sais quoi.

>(convert from/to Judaism); and bukh/sefer (the latter
>referring to a religious book; are the terms mutually
>exclusive, or is sefer a subset of bukh?).

seyfer is, I guess, a subset of bukh/bikhl (in your
dialect:  sayfer and bi:kh/bikhl) in the sense that, when
talking about book production for example (and not
specifying what kind of books) you'll talk about
bikher-produktsye. Otherwise they're mutually exclusive
(relatively speaking). If you know the book you're talking
about is a book of a Jewish-religious nature, you'll refer
to it as a seyfer and not a bukh/bikhl.  If you see a book
laying on the table and don't know what it is, you'll refer
to it as a bukh/bikhl (until someone corrects you in the
case that it's a seyfer).

With the meeting of Yiddish and Ivrit ('Modern Hebrew', as
opposed to loshn-koydesh) in Israel, you'll often see
seyfer and maymer ('article') used in Israeli Yiddish
publications.  In Mod. Heb. these terms are purely secular
as are the English _book_ and _article_, but in non-Israeli
usage of Yiddish, they mean 'book/article of a specifically
religious nature'.  As for seyfer, perhaps Yiddish authors
in Israel are using it figuratively to exalt the book being
discussed, i.e., raising it to the spiritual level of a
religious publication.  But maymer (Mod. Heb. maamar) is
used in reference to any newspaper/magazine article, no
matter what its subject matter or importance.
