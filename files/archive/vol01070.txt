Subject: Query on a distinction; note to Ellen Prince.

Between curses, I would appreciate it if anyone could
clarify for me the distinction, if there is any, between
"baroigiss" and "een kass".

For Ellen Prince:  A Yiddish version of the sentence
"Everyone died in each bat tle" finally percolated into my
consciousness:  Yeder aner ist gestorben in yed er kamf. If
the English were "Everyone was killed in each battle," my
sense of the Yiddish would be: Yeder aner ist gerharget
gevorn in yeder kamf.  Well... it's a version, anyway.

Subject: Curses and Character

Dear Noyekh, In remembering, reading Mendele's wonderful
contributions to, and gleefully using Yiddish curses, it
occurred to me that many such -- e.g., "kholehrya" --
were also used, with a few minor shifts, to refer to
character types Thus a "kholehrya"  (my orthography stinks,
but is nevertheless decipherable, I hope) is a bitch, or
the equivalent thereof -- in any case, a feminine type.
(Just because I write in declarative sentences doesn't mean
I know what I'm saying.  It's simply easier to write this
way.)  So too, I would think, are many other "curses" also
descrip[tive of undesirable character types.  To call some-
one a "pferd" is to insult him (although sometimes it can
be a her).  Not quite a curse, of course, but definitely
insulting.  In any case, although I'm sure we can keep
going for a long time on Yiddish curses, wouldn't it also
be fun to begin to enumerate the various personality
nuances and types which Jews have been so brilliant and
prolific in capturing?  Let me suggest a few which I actu-
ally silently think of in faculty meetings:  1. A "proste
(Yid, Goy, whatever)" 2. Kelbelle or Shafelle (literally
little calf or sheep, but in some contexts, referring to an
adult, whiner, to a child as "dear child), 3) of course,
"bolagoola" 4) chochem 5) shvitser -- i.e., a prevaricator
6) chaim knyack -- big deal, showoff, 7) My bubbeh used to
say of one of her landsleit: "A pferd geht ibber die welt
und bleibt a pferd," which puzzled but also tickled me as a
child.  Later I found the same idea in Freud: character is
fate. 8) poskudnyack -- I hope this is deciperable 9)
poskutsti -- vile female, I think 10) lemmishki, 11)
vantz, shvatnz, putz, shmuck are ubiquitous and virtually
English (ex cept for some of my demographer colleagues who
are semi-literate) 11) luft mensch --- and so on and so on
and so on.   Something to consider?  Mit leib, Hershel.
