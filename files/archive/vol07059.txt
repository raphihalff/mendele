Subject: Yiddish Anarchism

With reference to John Patten's query concerning Anarchism in Yiddish
[7.058:6]: He says he has already been in touch with YIVO, so the chances
are that he already knows about Rudolf Ro(c)ker and the _Arbayter Fraynd_,
so I will make this brief. I notice that he has a UK address. If he is in
London, this is the perfect source for him, and it will lead into everything
else, Roker's translations of Kropotkin, Johann Most, Emma Goldman, the lot.

Subject: Yiddish in the news 

The 'Night of the Murdered Poets': the truth about August 12, 1952. (Soviet
executions of intellectuals and writers). Joshua Rubenstein.
The New Republic, August 25, 1997 v217 n8 p25(6).
Near the end of his life, Josef Stalin's thinly veiled anti-Semitism overran
him, and he ordered a crackdown on Yiddish culture. His execution of five
Yiddish poets and writers, along with ten others, is described in detail
following unearthing of previously secret Soviet archives.

Anniversary
Dateline: World Jewry, August 1997 p4
In Chernovtsy, Ukraine, _Dos Yidishe Vort_, a Jewish radio program, has
celebrated its 50th anniversary. The program's mixture of folk music and
translations have made it popular among Jews and non-Jews alike.

Ashkenazi is jazzy: Yiddish culture is on a global upswing. Ilona Biro
Maclean's, Sep 1, 1997 v110 n35 p79(1)
The second annual Ashkenaz festival will be held in Toronto, Ontario,in late
August 1997. The festival is part of a worldwide revival of interest in the
culture of Ashkenazi Jews, originally from central Europe. Interest in klezmer
music and Yiddish are both part of this trend.

Subject: New authors

I was most interested in Leonard Prager's introduction to the Mendele Review
Vol 01.018 concerning the state of Yiddish book publishing and distribution.
One question I would add is, "What about new Yiddish authors?" Not only is 
it difficult to find already-published Yiddish materials, but how does the
unknown Yiddish author, eager to contribute something new, go about finding a
publisher for his manuscripts? In particular, I have edited, with four
assistants (who are Mendele subscribers) from around the world, a preliminary
version of an English-Yiddish chemistry glossary, including a complete list of
all the chemical elements, an attempt at nomenclature rules for chemical
compounds, and a full list of Yiddish metric-system words. The number of terms
in this "khemye-reshime" probably exceeds 4000, and is culled from nearly two
dozen Yiddish scientific works (yes, they do exist), plus general Yiddish
dictionaries. Without going into detail, when the the "Forverts" every week
carries stories about space missions, global warming, medical breakthroughs, 
the Internet, nuclear proliferation, etc., we Yiddish users need such a list.
We cannot accept "speys-shotl" for space shuttle". The idea is similar to 
Yankl Hapern's list of computer terminology in Yiddish, but much more 
extensive.

I am not a published Yiddish author, nor am I a world-famous Nobel-prize-
winning scientist, just a young (age 34) postdoctoral researcher in chemistry
who wants to promote Yiddish for our generation. I have a one-year old son to 
whom I speak only mame-loshn. Obviously I'd like to be able to describe my
work to him, and him to others. Where, dear Mendelists, would I go to publish
this list? Dr. Mordkhe Schechter told me he is interested in my work, but he 
asked me who would publish it?

This is not a rhetorical question. Any specific publishing houses, with names
and addresses, would be appreciated.

A sheynem dank in foroys,

Dr. Stephen (Shloyme-Khayim) Cohen

Subject: Strong language

This may have been covered previously, in which case I'd appreciate the
reference(s). The Yiddish milieu in which I was raised bore a heavy
burden of prudishness. This extended to both language(E.g.: I.B. Singer
was too earthy) and behavior. Nevertheless, es zenen dukh du ayntselne
gesheyenishn ven men must nitsn shtarke verter. (there are though
singular circumstances when strong language is mandatory) Memory almost
fails me. I can recall one good example and the grand, histrionic
passion that always accompanied its use: PASKUDNYAK (masc), PASKUTSVE
(fem). I'm not looking for the Yinglish words like 'alrightnik,' the
sexual one's like 'kurve,' or the rest of the scatological menu, but for
words used on those rare extremely charged occasions when cutely ironic
metaphors and similies just won't do.
 
P.S.: Shoin a gantz vokh on mendele. An umglik oyf der velt!
