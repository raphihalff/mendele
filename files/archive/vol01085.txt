i've had the same problem. at least in my recollections,
tho, there are some more variations:

>YIVO Vowel          Standard (litvish)   Galitsianer
>---- -----          ------------------   --------------------
>o    kometz-aleph   "aw" as in law       "oo" as in pool
>                                         (and kometz is
>                                         pronounced "koometz")

not all komets-alefs are u, tho--nokh 'still' is always
nokh (tho nokh 'after' is nukh), zol/volt/hob/hot/... are
always o, mir/zey hobn is o but ikh vil hobn is u... (it
depends on what the vowel was in old yiddish/middle high
german.)

>e    ayin    "e" as in led      same

but some ayins are ey, no? e.g. avek is e but ikh meg is
ey; bet 'bed' is e but shtetl is ey, ikh ze 'i see' rhymes
with ikh gey 'i go', etc.

>ay   yud-yud-patakh English long I     varies: long A or I

this was often a:, as in father, no? e.g haynt as ha:nt,
tsiga:ner 'gypsy', bla:bn 'stay', dra:tsn 'thirteen'...
when a couple remarried, each with a child from a previous
marriage and then had a child together, it was 'ma:ns,
da:ns, in inze(r)s'! (mayns, dayns, un undzers', for you
litvaks out there.)


>u    vov     "oo" as in pool     i or ee

some vovs remained u: nu! 

>Thus, in Galitsianer, "nokh a mol" is pronounced "nukh a
>mul" (using YIVO transliteration). Similarly, "du bist do"
>(you are here) is pronouced "di bist du".

no, i don't think nokh a mol was ever nukh--unless it meant
'after a time'. what i remember for 'again' was
categorically 'nokh a mul'.

>Perhaps due to the effects of Litvish assimilation on my

stigmatized regional dialects are VERY RARELY consistent
when the speakers have some contact with other, more
prestigious dialects, in any language. i bet they were more
consistent with ey for ayin than with ay for yod-yod--for
some reason, ey for ayin was much less stigmatized.
likewise u for komets-alef was pretty unstigmatized and
therefore relatively consistent.

>Another difference in pronunciation that I have noticed is
>an interchange of "oy" and the Hebrew long O "oh", as in

>	moyl (mouth)		mohel (rhymes with "coal")
>	mohel (circumcisor)	moyl
>        boykh (belly)           bohekh ("oh" is long O, and
>                                        two syllables)

yup. also fro for froy, of for oyf, but never shon for
shoyn, right?

it's not easy to be a galits...

Bob Goldberg: you've got a good ear; some problems with
your interpretations but too much to deal with off hand.
Designations like "galitsyaner yiddish" are quite inexact
but we "know what you mean". The very work for you to see
for a systematization of all of this will be "in press" as
of November 1: Volume 1 of "The Language and Culture Atlas
of Ashkenazic Jewry"  (a dialect atlas--maps and all). In
the meantime, read Herzog, "The Yiddish Language in Northern
Poland --Its geography & History" (Indiana, 1965); Max
Weinreich, "History of the Yiddish Language" (Chicago,
1980). More, after November 1.
