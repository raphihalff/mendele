baltimore, maryland

the world is full of yiddish, and we are getting ready for yet another year
of learning in the universities, adult ed. courses, and other institutions
where people come to learn mame loshn. young and not so young.

and certainly there afre far more starter ... how to make it happen that
more beginners move onto a higher level.  I speak of america, france,
israel, canada, south america, south africa.

perhaps it would be a plan to start a thread to discuss a little all the
problems that teachers go through in our times, not only pedagogy, but also
practical problems, creative materials for today's students.

perhaps it's also a plan, dear shames, to create a list of classes on
mendele review, into which one can submit info in a timely manner.

the general public (even lovers of yidish) must understand that the first
problem is timely registration -- if not, there is no class.
administrations do not wait until people begin to wake up from their summer
vacations

for example, here in baltimore, classes begin the 4th of september, so
people need to register by the end of august

so many subjects we need to discuss. texts. questions. overviews of new
teaching materials. advice on how to bring students over the hardest
beginner exercises, that they should arrive at the treasures of mame loshn.

where can we find people with enough preparation to be able to conduct classes?

how do we get classes going for young people?

And perhaps we can, from all this information, create a special homepage
for yiddish teachers and the subject of pedagogy.  write, write, teachers,
students, school administrators, etc. whatcha think?

Subject: Mendele Moykher Sforim dislikes liberals in mitn derinen?

Az me redt Yidish un me fregt, "Vos iz a Yidish bukh? iz der entfer mistome

The Amboy Dukes, The Metamorphosis, Delmore Schwartz's bashraybungen, un azoy

Dortn iz faran nor eyn shmues vegn a bukh af mame-loshn.  Ruth Wisse hot
ongshribn an interesantn ibershmues vegn Di Kliatshe fun Mendele Moykher
Sforim.  Ober di diskutsiye iz untergegrobn az zi shlaydert arayn fun droysn
mit gevald a modnem peyresh: in Mendele's 1871 bukh gefint zi politishe
taynes kegn hayntike "liberals."  Vos?  Ver?  Vemen?

Baleydikn "liberals" mit nit-shayekhedike taynes iz bay ir, aponim, a
klogekidke banemenish.  Zi shlept es aroys funem arbl oder funem linken
pyate, un es klept zikh vi an arbes tsu der vant.

When speaking Yiddish and you ask, "Vos iz a Yidish Bukh?" (ambiguously
understood as What is a Jewish book or What is a Yiddish book) the answer is
most likely quite simple: some book written in Yiddish.  The same question in
English: What is a Jewish Book? evokes another kind of answer.  Just see the
articles in the latest issue of the Book Peddler from the National Yiddish
Book Center.  There are discussued Ulysses, The Amboy Dukes, The
Metamorphosis, Delmore Schwartz's writing, etc.

Only one discussion is about a Yiddish book.  Ruth Wisse has written an
interesting overview about Di Kliatshe by Mendele Moykher Sforim.  However,
the discussion is undermined when she forcibly pitches in a strange, exotic
interpretation: she finds in Mendele's 1871 book political arguments against
today's liberals.  What the....!

Insulting liberals with outlandish arguments is, apparently, her pathetic
obsession. [Now, an almost a literal rendering of Yiddish] She pulls it out
of her sleeve or from the left heel, and it sticks like a bean to the wall
[that is, wildly irrelevant and off the wall].

Subject: Green's Yiddish Films.

To the inquiry on how to obtain information on Joseph Green's films, I
would recommend a book I have just purchased entitled "Visions, Images and
Dreams: Yiddish Film Past and Present" by Eric Golman. Put out by Ergo
Media Inc.

Subject: Drimpln and Joseph Green

Tayere Mendelyaner,
Many thanks to all of you who wrote to answer my question about the
derivation and meaning of the word drimpl. (and my humble appreciation for
the kind words about the current state of my banjo "drimpln"...)
Re: Joseph Green. One need go no further than the monumental book by J.
Hoberman on the history of Yiddish film "Bridge of Light" (Museum of Modern
Art/Shocken, 1991). Thoroughly researched, lavishly illustrated and
eloquently written, it is a cornerstone work which should be in the library
of any lover of Yiddish culture.

Subject: Electronic dictionaries

Marvin Glasser's query re: a Yiddish-English electronic dictionary (7.043, 4)
recalls a Mendele colloquy some time ago about the possibility putting
Yiddish literature on CD-ROM.  I don't think a Yiddish-English electronic
dictionary exists but it, too, should be possible.  After all, Encylopaedia
Judaica including supplemental volumes, videos and sound files is available
on one Compact Disc.  Incredible, but true!  Then there might be room for all
the works of Sholem Aleichem, Peretz and Mendele on one disc.  Imagine!  Look
up almost anything, compare and contrast, follow chronologies, etc. by rather
simple searches.

Now about dictionaries.  How nice it would be to have Harkavy's
Yiddish-English- Hebrew dictionary on CD-ROM.  In book form you must start by
looking up the Yiddish word.  On a disc the dictionary would also be usable
as an English-Yiddish-Hebrew dictionary.  Weinreich's and other dictionaries
(incl. Yiddish-French, French-Yiddish, etc., e.g.) could probably fit on the
same CD.  Heady fantasies?  These days, they are no longer pipe-dreams.  One
potential problem: the type in Harkavy may not be clear enough to be scanned.
 If data entry by hand is necessary, expense rises markedly.

Big questions: Where is the fund-raiser who can successfully pitch this idea
to a willing entrepreneur?  Would there be a market?
