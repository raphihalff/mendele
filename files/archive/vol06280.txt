Subject: Helsinki University Library

Dovid Braun's message (Mendele 6.279), regarding Ignaz Bernstein's
collections of Yiddish proverbs, evokes fresh memories of a trip that
I took last month to Helsinki and Vilna (Vilnius).  During the Vilnius
segment of the trip I was one of three Judaica librarians who, with
the support of the Andrew Mellon Foundation and traveling under the
aegis of the National Foundation for Jewish Culture, were paying an
extended visit to the Bibliographical Center of the Lithuanian
National Library, where we examined that library's extensive Hebrew
and Yiddish collections at close range.  (I will have to defer any
further discussion of those collections until our report is submitted
to our sponsors next month.)

Since the travel agent booked us on Finnair I took advantage of the
situation to schedule a three-day stopover in Helsinki, where I was
able to see the much-discussed Hebrew (and Yiddish) collection at
Helsinki University Library.  During Tsarist times, the University
Library was designated as a legal depository, to which all
publications appearing in the Russian Empire -- in whatever language
-- were to be sent.  The last published report that I had seen,
written in 1991 by Dr. Tapani Harvianen (a Bible scholar who was
supervising the collection's cataloging), noted that most of the books
in the Hebrew collection were actually published between 1890 and
1914, and that (I'm recalling this from memory) about 90% of the 5,000
or so titles are in Hebrew.  Not all of the books were cataloged as of
1991, a situation that has since been remedied, and it appears that
the bulk of the new additions to the catalog are for Yiddish books,
thereby increasing the proportion of Yiddish titles in the Hebrew
collection in Helsinki. (I can confirm Harvianen's report that
holdings of Hebrew and Yiddish journals and newspapers are very
patchy.)  The overwhelming majority do indeed date from the
two-and-a-half decades before the First World War, and while
admittedly I was able to have little more than a cursory glance at the
catalog I do not believe that major surprises are likely to be found
there by Yiddish literary scholars.

A special collections librarian gave me a quick tour of the area where
the Hebrew and Yiddish books are housed in archival containers
(together with all non-Slavic-language imprints that were printed in
Tsarist Russia -- the Slavic books are kept in a separate facility),
and I asked if I might open up a random box to see what was inside.
She agreed to my request, and when I opened the box that I found
several paperbound items, among them portions of a pulp novel by Abner
Tannenbaum and the four fascicles of the 1908, Warsaw edition of Ignaz
Bernstein's Yudishe shprikhverter un redensarten -- with pages uncut
and in fine condition, although printed on inferior newsprint paper
stock.

In the Helsinki University Museum, next to the Special Collections
division of the University Library, portraits of five 19th-century
Russian Tsars occupy honored spots on the walls.  To this day the
three Alexanders are held in rather high esteem in Finland (so I was
told) -- and the two Nicholases rather less so.

Subject: Ezra Lahad receives Pinski Prize posthumously

The late Ezra Lahad received the Pinski Prize for 1996 on the 18th of
March. His wife, Naomi, received the prize in her late husband's name.
The prize was awarded for a lifetime devoted to Yiddish
bibliographical scholarship in general and for the compendious
bibliography of printed Yiddish plays which Lahad managed to complete
shortly before his death -- an  important research tool which,
hopefully, will be published within the next year.

Subject: What song is this?

The lines "Ikh bin gvaldik tsufridn, etc." come from a song by Yosl
Cutler, music by Jacob Schaefer.  It is called "Nishka."  The words
are are follows:

Treft zhe ver er iz?
Ir kent nisht?
To khapt nisht,
S'brent night.

Fregt zikh a frage
Vos i' dos far a fish?
Vel ikh aykh derklern
Vos er iz - nish.
Er iz nishka stolyer,
Er iz nishka poyer
Er iz nishka shnayder,
Er iz nishka boyer.
Er iz "nishka"
Un fartik.

Un khotsh er iz nisht
Ot di ale zakhn,
Fun dest vegn ken er
Aykh altsding makhn.
Ven a forier, lemoshl,
Darf makhn a pelts,
Nemt er a felkhl
Un makht es.
Ven, ober, nishka
Darf makhn a pelts
Nemt er a felkhl
Mit a forier
Un makht es.

Er ergert zikh derfun
Afile keyn hor nisht,
Er makht aykh altsding
Un kenen ken er
Gornisht.

Aleyn gornisht kenen
Iz dokh gornisht sheyn,
Ober esn, zogt men,
Ken er aleyn.
Fregt zikh a frage,
Vos iz er fort?
Vos iz er nisht?
Er iz vos in der kort!

A yoger, a zoyfer,
A lakkhn, a koyfer,
A khaper, a vikher,
A nemer, a krikher.
S'geyt nishkan, nishkoshe,
S'lebt zikh im glat,
Er iz gevaldik tsufridn
Vos di mame hot im gehat.

The song, text and choral piece (4 voices and piano) is published in
Jacob Schaefer's "Ikh her a kol" - 22 Selected Songs of Jacob
Schaefer.  The melody of the last two lines is the same as the one we
sang in Camp Boiberik. Apparently campers or counselors added the
line: "Un nit keyn fremde yidene."

Subject: What song is this?

The line appears in a song based on the poem Nishke by Yosl Kotler, a
staple of the Ordn Mitlshul's musical repertoire.   (It's the last
line of the poem, and in the 4-part arrangement that the Mitlshul
chorus sang, it's repeated over and over at the end by the basses and
tenors - a very funny moment).

The  song containing the line about the zagranitshne meser, by the
way, was included in Yankev Sheyfer's (Schaefer's) Bunt Mit A
Statshke, which was an arrangement of songs from the Beregovski
collection- also a favorite of the Ordn Shuln. There the protagonist
(and recipient of the zangranitshne meser) was called Meyer Khazer.
