Subject: how is "lamed yud" pronounced?

I note with some surprise that that so far nobody has responded to
Andrew Firestone's interesting and important question in Mendele 12.013
(19-02-03), or at least not publicly. The simple answer, of course, is
that lamed yud is normally pronounced as a palatalised [l], i.e. IPA
[lj] or YIVO-Romanisation [LY], eg. 'lyang', 'lyade', 'lyokhe',
klyatshe', plyese' etc. This is to be contrasted with the uvular [l]
sound that is the normal realisation of lamed. In some narrow
transcriptions this distinction is made clearer by transcribing the
uvular sound by means of the Polish barred l (which was pronounced in
the same way at an earlier stage in the development of Polish - Today,
of course, it is pronounced [u]).

In reality, however, the situation is somewhat more complex. First we
need to note that lamed alone is occasionally given the same
[lj]-realisation. This is recorded in _College Yiddish_ by
transcription with an italicised upper-case [L] and in Weinreich's
dictionary by means of a subscript crescent under the lamed. Thus we
have words such as 'lyedvitse', 'lyeptshikhe', 'lyepke', 'mol' ("moth")
which, though pronounced [lj], are spelled with lamed alone. In
prevocalic position there appears to be no better justification for
this anomaly than that this spelling may be suggested by the
orthography of the cognate words in Polish etc. Not surprisingly, these
two spellings are often regarded as free variants.

On the other hand where lamed yud is followed by a vowel and the yud is
a khirek yud the pronunciation is [li], as in 'tlien', 'tlie' ('Soviet'
orthography), 'bliung', 'bliekhts', 'flien'. Unfortunately, there is
another category of 'international' words which, though spelled lamed
yud (without a khirek in the YIVO-orthography) are nonetheless also
pronounced [li]. In my view this represents a regretable inconsistency
in the YIVO-orthography. Vaynraykh's comments on the topic in the
introduction to his dictionary are unhelpful and I have failed to draw
Mordkhe Shekhter, the doyen-arbiter of such matters, on this question.
But the problem was evidently recognised in the USSR, since Shapiro,
Spivak and Shul'man in their _Russko-Yevrejskij (idish) Slovar'_ (1989)
do consistently spell with khirek yud in such cases, e.g.
'bibliografye', 'bibliotek' etc.

Subject: kugel vs. kigel pronunciation/kashe varnisches

Could you advise me about the difference between these two
pronunciations, that is, what kind of variation is "kigel" and which
speakers are apt to employ it over "kugel"?  I am wondering if it is a
Polish variation as I heard a speaker from Luboml say it in the
documentary "Luboml: My Heart Remembers."  I am working as a dialect
consultant for a play based upon Isaac Bashevis Singer's "Meshugah" and
a character speaks of potato kugel and kashe varnisches, which we have
been saying KAHSH-eh-varNEESHez.  I am wondering about both, we have
been saying an -u vowel in "kugel" so far.  The character is Polish,
and I noted that the town had been given an unofficial name of
"Libivne" and I wondered if this is related to the "kugel/kigel"
difference.  Naturally we would like to be authentic!

Many thanks,
K.C. Ligon

Subject: Solon Beinfeld Interview on The Yiddish Voice Radio in Boston

The Yiddish Voice, a weekly Yiddish-language radio show, will feature
an interview with Solon Beinfeld on its Wednesday, June 14, 2003

Sholem Beinfeld, as he is known in Yiddish, lives in Cambridge, Mass.,
and is Professor Emeritus of History at Washington University in St.
Louis, where he taught modern Jewish history and specialized in the
Vilna Ghetto.  He has been a consultant on many important projects
related to Holocaust history, including the documentary film Partisans
of Vilna and the Kovno Ghetto Exhibit at the US Holocaust Memorial
Museum.  Recently he was the translator, from Yiddish to English, of
the book _Girl with Two Landscapes: The Wartime Diary of Lena Jedwab,
1941-1945_ by Lena Jedwab Rozenberg.

Since retiring from active teaching and settling in Cambridge several
years ago, Beinfeld has been active in Boston's Jewish and Yiddish
cultural circles, notably as a lecturer, in Yiddish and in English, on
various aspects of Jewish cultural history.

The interview was conducted by the cohost of the Yiddish Voice, Hasia
Segal, a native of Lithuania.  The Yiddish Voice is heard each
Wednesday from 7:30 to 8:30 p.m. on WUNR 1600 AM, Brookline, Mass.,

Subject: Abraham Ber Gottlober

I am compiling information about Abraham Ber Gottlober, who was my
great-great-great-grandfather, in addition to a leading maskil and the
teacher of Goldfaden and Mendele Moykher-Sforim.

If anyone has copies of ABG's works (other than those in the Yiddish
Verk collection), or obscure sources on his life and works, I would be
pleased to see and/or purchase them.

Subject: Friedrich Schiller in Yiddish

Dear Mendele-friends,

does anyone know if the little text of Friedrich Schiller "Ueber die
aesthetische Erziehung des Menschen" ever was translated into Yiddish.
I wonder if his idea to preform a nation aesthetically by a
"Nationalliteratur" had any outspoken influence in the yiddish context.

A shainen dank!

Subject: anti-Hasidic humour

Tayere khevre,

I am looking for jokes and parodies that mock Hasidic tales, especially
Hasidic miracle stories.  While all humour of this kind is of interest, I
am most interested in material published before the First World War.  I am
also looking for information on the dates of composition or first
circulation of Yiddish folksongs that parody Hasidim ("Az der Rebe
tantst", "Kum aher du filosof", "Makht dos Khosidl bim bom").

with thanks for any leads,

Justin Lewis
