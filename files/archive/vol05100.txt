Subject: Kinehore

I am still basking in the pleasantness of Zelig Bach's article on
superstitious expressions in Yiddish and realized that I had two small
things to add, both with respect to "kinehore," the expression used to
ward off the evil eye.  (Ptew, ptew, ptew!)

The first item is that the west coast slang expression, "Don't give me a
canary!" is derived from that word and is intended to mean the very same
thing.  Mostly I hear it in Los Angeles and hardly at all in San
Francisco.

The second item is a joke based on the word itself.  It is an old joke
and is probably known to 90% of the people on the board, but for the
other 10%, they should not pass another night without hearing it.

An elderly Jewish man appears in court for some purpose and is asked by
the judge, who happens not to be Jewish, "How old are you?".

The elderly man replies, "I am 92 years old, kinehore."

The judge, not understanding what he meant, repeated the question.

The response was the same: "I am 92 years old, kinehore."

The judge becomes more heated.  "Why aren't you being responsive?" he
demands.  "Now answer my question without embellishments!  How old are
you?"

The old man looks frightened and says, "I am 92 years old, kinehore."

The judge is furious, but before he can explode with anger, one of the
attorneys in court approaches and asks if he might put the question to
the witness.  The lawyer understands Yiddish and realizes what the
problem is.  He says to the old man, "Kinehore, how old are you?"

To which the immediate response is, "I am 92 years old."

Subject: Puzzling proverb

I am sometimes at a loss in understanding proverbs, a difficulty my
psychiatric/psychological friends will doubtless attribute to the ravages
of age.  _Yidishe shprikhverter_ are a special problem--as I recall, even
Ignatz Bernstein, in his famous collection (1908), admits being puzzled
on occasion. Can some clever Mendelyaner explicate the following, cited
by U. Weinreich on page 206 of _College Yiddish_?  "_Beser dray teg
gezunt eyder eyn tog krank_." When is this startling insight appropriate?
All that occurs to me is that it might be said right after someone has
uttered something entirely obvious.  (I believe that "Queen Anne is dead"
often serves this function in Britain.)

Subject: Shnirele Perele

We recently heard a Yiddish song "Shnirele Perele" (String of Pearls?)
whose words and music we would like to acquire.  If anyone could tell us
of a source, we would greatly appreciate it.  A sheynem dank in foroys.

Subject: Visgemirgedakh

Sam Abrash, I rather suspect that your horse's name [5.099] was
nishtbamirgedakht, that nisht-bay-mir-gedakht, i.e. unheard of
(approximately). I hope that you didn't try betting on him.
