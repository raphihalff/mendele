Subject: Forwarded: Poor-folks foods

My wife's aunt, a Galitzyanerke, also used to make nunt.
It seemed to me like tayglach, but with nuts instead of
balls of dough.
 
The litvak part of the family makes retach un shmaltz,
sliced red (or better, diced black) radish, diced onion and
chicken fat, salted and peppered to taste and eaten with
challah as forshpeis for shabbos lunch.  We generally
referred to it as 'instant heartburn.'  It does wonders for
the coronary arteries!  Talk about poor-folks food!
 
The correlation of geography with dialects and cooking
style allows a convenient shorthand.  Lokshen kugel is
seasoned with salt and pepper, and is best made with added
sauteed onions;  the stuff made with sugar and raisins we
call "kigel".

Bob, you sound angry. Sorry! The onus in such matters,
though, is really on the claimant. There are a number of
ways in which one can demonstraste with some degree of
certainty that features in different languages are related,
either as a result of common origin or borrowing. Requiring
(sic!) proof that there is no relationship is not very
reasonable. In fact we can't prove that ANY two languages
are NOT related. If we believe in the monogenesis of man,
we might also assume the monopgenesis of language, but the
evidence for such relationships doesn't lie in accidental
sound-meaning relationships of the sort we've been
discussing. Native Yiddish speakers, almost by definition
bi/multlingual have always been prone to the kind of
word-play that yields such tantalizing pairs as
Heirat/harey at. I see that there is room for several more
"sics" in this message so I'd best sign off.

Subject: Mashed potatoes

What do MENDELE readers call mashed potatoes?  The kids
asked us yesterday.  Weinreich calls them "kartofl-kashe",
ober s'klingt uns nisht gut.  Weinreich also says "mash" is
"tsekvetshn", but "tsekveshte kartofl" past oikhet nisht.

There must be a good answer here.  This is one word where
the standard line "in der heim hot men dus nisht gehat"
surely doesn't apply.
