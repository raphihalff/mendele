Subject: Introduction

So I did not realize that I was supposed to introduce myself. I am sorry that my
Yiddish is not up to this, I am only a beginner at Yiddish and it is for me a
tenth language (of which I only claim fluency in the first six).

So I am 47, live in Vancouver, work in a hospital and am largely an autodidact.
I am unconventional in my views on most things. Why an interest in Yiddish. If I
go back five generations (via Australia and England), my ancestors who I think
came from Gostynin spoke the language, so in part it is to recover part of my
ancestral past. Partly because the language is interesting in and of itself both
for its idioms and for words that do not seem to translate very well into other
languages. I am slowly working my way through Uriel Weinreich's textbook. My
only other Yiddish books are a complete set of Shalom Aleikhem in the original.

Subject: Introduction

Shalom Chaverim!  This is to introduce myself.

I grew up in a home in Chicago where no Yiddish was spoken and always felt that
I was missing something.

For many years I was a Group Tour Co-ordinator for KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,
organizing and encouraging Ministers to take the members of their congregations
on a Holy Land Tour.

I have returned to Yisroel 21 times since 1960 and on many occasions have felt
the need to converse in Yiddish as a substitute for Hebrew.

A few years ago I joined a Yiddish Literature Class at Santa Monica Emeritus
College and through this group discovered "Mendele".  What a mechiah!  I signed
on just a few months ago and think I have learned more Yiddish through your
contributors than in the classroom.

Its been a "lebideke velt far mir, und far dos, Shames, a shanem, hartzikn
dank".

Subject: Pluperfect

On Ellen Prince's mention of the pluperfect in Yiddish:

I don't know when it "dates from" in Yiddish (written? spoken?).  The "extra
gehat (German *gehabt*) construction is found in Southern German dialect speech,
however.  Thus, see, for example, Werner Abraham's (1991) article "How much of
the German tense system is 'Aspect' and 'Aktionsart'", in the volume
*Perspectives on Aspect and Aktionsart:, Carl Vetters & Willy Vandeweghe (eds),
pp. 133 - 150.  Thus, Abraham (141ff) writes in section 4 "Double perfect and
double pluperfect in Upper German":

"Upper German ( = Bavarian, Austrian, and Alemannic) provides another example of
strict dependency upon Aktionsart and aspect.  It is a well known fact that
preterite forms are missing in upper German (this is the so-called "Upper German
preterite deletion").  In some rare cases, Upper German uses double preterite
constructions; see examples in (24) and (25) ...

(24)  Sie haben es auf ihn abgesehen gehabt
(25)  Er ist schon angekommen gewesen

See also Charles V. J. Russ (ed), *The Dialects of modern German: A linguistic
survey* (1989), Stanford University Press, for examples from various Upper
German dialects.

Subject: More on the pluperfect

Since the subject of the Yiddish "pluperfect" has come up (the quotation marks
will be justified later), I wish to throw in a couple of ideas/questions for
those far more knowledgeable than myself to provide enlightenment on, if
possible.  My first point addresses the original question posed by Ellen Prince
of origins, though from a somewhat different angle.

I do not have access to many Yiddish grammars and I futhermore speak as an utter
layman, but it strikes me that the phenomenon of the Yiddish "pluperfect" tense,
including the apparent variations (or confusions?) regarding the choice between
auxiliaries _zayn_ and _hobn_ (for both conjugated and participial parts of the
construction), very likely reflects Slavic influence in Yiddish.  Does anyone
agree (or disagree)?

My reason for suggesting this is as follows.  If you will kindly make allowances
for a gross over-generalization, then perhaps I will be permitted to say that
the "hardware" of Yiddish is Germanic while quite a bit of its "software" is
Slavic in inspiration.  (And who knows, maybe the "operating system" is Semitic
:-) !)  If a language is characterized by what it does with its raw material as
much as by the identity of that material, then Yiddish is quite strongly
Slavicized.

One example, tangential to the main point here (the "pluperfect"), is the way
Yiddish, although remaining Germanic in the way it forms the past tense with
either _hobn_ or _zayn_ plus participle, acts more in concert with its Slavic
neighbours in the way it has generalised just one past tense, the periphrastic
one, eliminating the older simple past, getting rid of (this way of expressing)
the aspectual distinction found e.g. between standard German _war_ and _ist
gewesen_.  Yiddish has not assimilated to Slavic to the extent of generalising
the use of the _zayn_ auxiliary here (so _ikh hob gezungen_ rather than *_ikh
bin gezungen_), making the form closer to Germanic; yet the resulting set of
available tenses and the values of each tense are closer to the Slavic model
(and then there is the Slavic-style incorporation of aspectuality into the
system, of course).

Regarding the Yiddish "pluperfect", _ikh hob gehat gezungen_ etc. (with the
variants mentioned in other recent contributions), I think there are closer
parallels and paraphrases in Slavic languages than in German, and so am led to
suspect that it was formed on, or at the very least re-formed according to, the
Slavic model.  But then the question would arise, in the process of
(re)formation, which auxiliaries the Yiddish construction should contain.
According to the Slavic model it ought to be _zayn_ (and _geven_) throughout,
e.g. ??_ikh bin geven gezungen_.  On the other hand, internal grammatical
consistency within Yiddish would probably favour using _hobn_ with verbs taking
_hobn_ in the past, e.g. _ikh hob gehat gezungen_, by extrapolation from the
past tense model (_ikh hob gezungen_).  Thus conflicting motivations for one or
the other formation would naturally arise.  Does that explain the variety of
forms actually found?

Next I want to ask whether someone can clarify the uses and meaning of the
Yiddish "pluperfect".  On the one hand there is the question of how common it
is, and related to this, of its stylistic standing.  S.A. Birnbaum (1979:269),
for example, describes it as "not much used".  Is it possible to expand on this
information?  Is it more common in some sorts of context than others?  Is it, by
any chance, a feature of literary rather than colloquial Yiddish?

Also, I wonder whether it might be considered in any way an artificial
construction from the point of view of the spoken language?  If so, then
Meyer-Leyb Wolf's statement, "Ellen Prince's question on the pluperfect... might
better be: who decided on the form she cites and when", would make a bit more
sense to me than otherwise.

Lastly, what, I'd like to know, is the real meaning of this so-called
pluperfect?  The label "pluperfect" seems to suggest that _ikh hob gehat
gezungen_ means the same as "I had sung" in English.  Is that exactly right? It
doesn´t seem to apply for some of the uses I have noticed in Yiddish literature.
Here is one such example from Sholem Aleykhem's short story "Vekhalaklakes"
(_Gants Tevye der milkhiker_, New York, 1937:223-230), and the same few pages
also contain another two examples of a similar kind:

"Ikh hob aykh shoyn, dakht zikh, a mol gehat gezogt, az..." which I think means
"I think I (have) already told you...", not ??"I think I had (already) told
you...".

In such cases the so-called "pluperfect" appears to have the meaning of a
special variant of the past tense, not of a pluperfect as normally understood.
How common is this kind of usage, and does it too have Slavic precedents, I
wonder?
