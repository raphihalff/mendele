everywhere. This post was solicited. nm]

Subject: Der Bay

To increse the effectiveness of Der Bay specific issues
will be geared to teachers, clubs or bands.  The months
those issues will be published, that segment may receive
the issue even if they do not contribute.

Another important activity was to be highly selective in
the database.  While over a thousand names are in the
database and a larger number have been removed, it is the
acccuracy that is critical.  TYN contacts and contributors
receive each issue of der bay and may receive lists upon
request.  Other key people will receive issues periodically
in order to keep the mailing list current.

My financial resources no longer permit me to totally
finance my wonderful "hobby" of networking Yiddish around
the world.  All mailings outside of the US will continue to
be sent without solicited contributions and are highly
selective.

Areas still needing to be represented are in South America
and the CIS. It is essential that contacts not only be
interested in Yiddish, but must understand some English.

The first ever International Calendar of Yiddish Events is
now published in der bay.

Yiddish teachers, Yiddish clubs, and Klezmer bands, this
newsletter is your clearinghouse.  Philip "Fishl" Kutner,
1128 Tanglewood Way, San Mateo, CA 94403, (415) 349-6946 is
your editor.  To receive a list or to be listed, send Fishl
a self-addressed stamped envelope (SASE).  Gigs and
teaching positions are handled only by the parties
involved.  Fishl does not get involved in financial
arrangements, nor is there a fee.

The Yiddish Network (TYN) now has contacts in 102 cities.
Every state, Puerto Rico, and 14 foreign countries are
covered. When you move or travel, the contact person will
send you a list of Yiddish activities and names of several
Yiddish speakers.  All you need do is send the contact a
SASE.

        Checks for der bay's  support should be made
        payable to Peninsula JCC (PJCC).

Subject: RE: tahars hamishpoke

[In response to Hersh Basser's query:]

It's a common term in Orthodox speech today.   I hear it
quite often. One might refer to someone else as "keeping
taharas hamishpokhe" just as one might refer to someone
else as "keeping Shabbos" -- i.e., they follow the relevant
halachic requirements.  Of course, because of the subject
matter it tends to get mentioned less in the context of
one's acquaintances, since it's intrusive and immodest to
discuss it. However, it's quite normal to hear a rabbi
discuss it, for example, as one of the core halachic
requirements.

[For those who don't know what this is all about: it means
"family purity", and deals with the religious requirements
for a husband and wife to separate during the wife's
monthly period; after a number of "clean" days and
immersion by the wife in the mikveh, the couple reunite.
The laws of taharas hamishpokhe mandate no physical
contact, including touching, during that time. Aside from
being very efficient at producing large families (!), the
system is widely considered to do wonders, psychologically,
for the relationship between the husband and wife.]

Subject: Pani Sholem Aleykhem

Thinking about translations of Sholem Aleykhem, I was
wondering about the way in which the story-teller in the
Tevye der Milkhiger stories (and maybe some others)
addresses the higher-level narrator, Pani Sholem Aleykhem.
Why did Sholem Aleykhem use the Polish (also Ukrainian?)
word for Mr.?  What did this mean to Yiddish readers in
Eastern Europe at the time?  I could guess that it implies
social distance, and perhaps a deferential attitude of the
simple story-telling character to the secularly-educated
writer-Sholem-Aleykhem-character, that Reb or other Yiddish
titles wouldn't have.  Does anyone have a more educated
guess?
