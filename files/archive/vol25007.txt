Subject: opshikn dem khoyv

Re: Martin Jacob's inquiry [25.006]. "opshikn dem khoyv" means, simply, paying off (or liquidating) the debt.

Subject: Mayn kales apetit

Khoshever fraynt,

In 1994 Sheldon (Sholem-Ruveyn) Benjamin asked on this list about the song Mayn kales apetit. I don't know if he is still with us, but I have just recorded that song on youtube:

The box of Yiddish broadsides he found in the basement of Hebrew Union College has now been digitized and all 202 songsheets are now available as a paperback book (or digital download) here:

I'm finding the tunes and recording the songs. You can follow my progress at the companion blog, http://YiddishPennySongs.com

A dank,

Subject: "Noyekh" lyrics
My late father used to sing a ditty about parshas Noach, of which I can remember only the refrain and two verses.  :

Eyle toldos Noyekh
fun bronfn hot men koyekh
A bisele vayn iz der iker
Un fun bronfn vert men shiker.

Eysh iz fayer
Fayer iz eysh
Fayer iz eysh
Un boser iz fleysh

Bosor iz fleysh
Fleysh iz bosor
Fleysh iz bosor
Un chazer iz oser.

Does anyone have complete lyrics to this?

David Bienenfeld

Subject: nadegele fayer

In his 1869 story "Der ba'al shem in di zornes" Ayzik-Meir Dik recounts the tricks played by a charlatan who, pretending to exorcise demons from a house, orders the members of the family to hold half a havdalah candle in one hand and a nadegele (nun alef daled ayin gimmel ayin lamed ayin) fayer in the other.  

Any ideas?  Thanks!
