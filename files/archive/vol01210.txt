The death at 94 of this grand dame of Yiddish stage and
screen was reported in today's NY Times. "A bisl zin, a
bisl regn ... abi gezind tsu zayn."

Martin Davis

[It would be fitting on this sad occcasion for those who
remember Molly Picon or who know something of the history
of the Yiddish stage and/or screen to share their thoughts
with the rest of us. nm]

question: since the system you suggest is 'mostly' yivo (in
fact, it's entirely yivo, at least one of the options you
suggest when you suggest more than one), why not simply
adopt the yivo system? a little conventionality never hurts
when it comes to writing systems...

Subject: Yiddish news from Moscow

My friend Moisey (Moyshe) Wolf arrived last month as a
refugee from Russia. I visited with him and his wife in
Moscow last fall.  Moyshe is a longstanding activist in
Jewish cultural affairs in Russia.  He is working to
establish links between Yiddish cultural activists here in
North America and his colleagues in Moscow.  At the end of
this message, I've attached a letter of introduction from
Aaron Vergelis and the editorial board of "Sovyetish
Heymland", the Moscow-based Yiddish monthly.  (The
translation is mine.)

About Moyshe Wolf:  he was raised in prewar Warsaw, where
he had both a traditional and a modern Jewish education.
He is fully fluent in Yiddish, Russian, and modern Hebrew,
and has given several talks here in English. He is
interested in visiting your community to speak about
Yiddish cultural life in Russia, from Stalin's time until
the present, and to help build support for Yiddish literary
efforts in Moscow.  You can contact Moyshe at the following
address:

               Moisey S. Wolf
               6111 SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Highway #6
               Portland, OR 97221

			ATTACHED LETTER                   
      ---------------------------------------------------
  From the Editorial Board of "Sovyetish Heymland" (Aaron
       Vergelis, editor in chief)

  To Yiddish readers, writers, and friends of Yiddish in
  America:

  The editorial board of the Yiddish monthly "Sovyetish
  Heymland" announces that, beginning in 1992, in its place
  we are founding a new Yiddish journal called "Di Yidishe
  Gas".  We must also tell you that conditions for Yiddish
  literature in Russia are very difficult and that there is
  a danger that it will disappear altogether.

  We ask your help in assuring the continuation of Yiddish
  literary life in our country.  We need paper; a computer
  with a printer; and any related technical equipment.  We
  also need new energy and new ideas.

  We're not after charity or a handout.  We need interested
  people to work with us in establishing a Jewish
  publishing house where we can jointly publish literature
  on Jewish themes, whether in Yiddish, Hebrew, Russian,
  English, or other languages.  We're ready to get started:
  we have a building, and we have a talented core of
  energetic individuals.

  Our American representative, Moisey Wolf, is ready to
  meet with you. Professor Wolf has full authority to
  engage in any discussions with you on our behalf toward
  the establishment of this publishing venture.

  Moisey Wolf is one of the best known Yiddish literary
  critics and scholars in Russia.  His writings about the
  Yiddish literary tradition, about the first Yiddish book
  "Seyfer Anshel", and about contemporary Hebrew literature
  in Israel have often appeared in our pages.  He is the
  editor of the anthology "Ineynem" (1988), author of the
  column "Shmuesn vegn di etishe problemen in tanakh", and
  contributor of several articles that appear in the final
  1991 issue of "Sovyetish Heymland".

  Please help Moisey Wolf to fulfill his mission:  to
  secure the future of Yiddish cultural life in Russia,
  Ukraine, Belarus, and other republics.  We hope that you
  will respond to our plea and help us carry out this
  sacred work.

  With great respect,
  The Editorial Board
  Aaron Vergelis, Editor in Chief
