Subject: Canadian Yiddish dialectology

To Mark Flumerfelt's question -- "Why is it that Jews in Toronto use the
pronunciation Bubbi and Zedi, while Jews in Montreal use the
pronunciation Baubi and Zeda[?]" -- I recall an observation made a number
of years back by Prof. Eugene Orenstein (of the Jewish Studies program at
McGill University) that the core population of Jewish immigrants to
Toronto came from certain districts of pre-1914 Congress Poland
(specifically, Radom and I believe Kielce gubernii), while Jewish
immigrants to Montreal tended to come from the Pale of Settlement proper
(Belarus and Ukraine, from Podolia eastward) and Romania.  As a
non-linguist, I do not propose that this explains the specific variant
pronun- ciations (Mikhl Herzog, as a native Torontonian, might be able to
help in this regard), but the more general principle of migratory
patterns does, I think, apply.  And naturally, in 1920 there were a fair
number of Polish Jews in Montreal and "Russian" Jews in Toronto -- the
patterns were not uniform, obviously.

And now a question to Mark Flumerfelt:  In light of the large-scale
influx of Jewish immigrants to Toronto from Quebec, are Jews in Toronto
more inclined than previously to say "Baubi" and "Zeda," are the
ex-Montrealers now saying "Bubbi" and "Zedi," or are these two language
communities retaining their specificity?

Subject: The comprehensive Yiddish dictionary project

Someone asked about the present status of the comprehensive
Yiddish-in-Yiddish dictionary project. I'd very much like to find out
more about it too. I do have a little information.

A July 2, 1993 Yiddish Forwards article one the recent death of one Saul
Ferdman said that he had worked on the dictionary in question in
Jerusalem from 1980 to 1989 preparing two and a half further volumes
(after the first four volumes which have already been published and which
go through alef). The two and a half additional volumes go through gimel,
dalet, and hey. Since this is approximately one third of the way through
the Yiddish lexicon (as judged by the amount these letters take up in
Harkavy and in Weinreich) one can see that the original projection of
twelve volumes total is pretty much on target.

The article goes on to say that the project was halted for financial
reasons -- which must be why the fourth and fifth volume haven't been
published. The article does not say whether anyone has continued to work
on the project, nor what form the work is in -- old fashioned card files
still, computerized or what, nor what plans if any there are to complete
it. I would like to hear more about this if anyone knows. The article I'm
referring to starts on page 20 of the July 2, 1993 issue, if anyone wants
to look it up, and it is signed by a Dr. Yosef Guri.
