Subject: YIVO transcription

I have just read, with much sympathy, Nissen Goldberg's plaintive
note in Vol. 3.080. Of course, we want to be able to represent the
various dialects of Yiddish in roman transcription. (By the way, I
regret the continuing confusion of transcription and translitera-
tion; they are not the same!) What puzzles me, as one who is far
from being a scholar in Yiddish linguistics, is why Nissen sees a
problem in the Yivo transcription system. Am I wrong in understand-
ing that it can be used without much trouble to represent the
various regional and social accents of Yiddish. Hasn't Nissen
himself demonstrated that by writing both oyf and af, etc.? That is,
we must distinguish between a regrettable practice, on the one
hand, of assuming that any Yiddish text, including song lyrics,
must be writen in Standard Yiddish only, and, on the other hand,
the aability of the Yivo transcription to handle other accents and
dialects.

   When Nissen writes, "Ba mir bisti sheyn," is he not writing a
form of Southern Yiddish in Yivo transcription.

   As a phonetician, I cheerfully manage, both for narrow phonetic
transcription and for broad "phonemic" transcription, to get along
pretty well with the phonetic alphabet of the International Phonetic
Association, of which I am, of course, a loyal member, but I know
that the special non-roman letters and diacritics of this system are
impractical for widely based publications,so I cheerfully accept the
Yivo system in the absence of anything that I know to be better.
Another of our members recently commented that we should view
writing Yiddish in a conventional roman orthography just as we do
writing, say, French or Polish in roman script, each according to
its own orthographic rules. The only emendation needed to that, in
the case of Nissen's complaint, is that the possibility of writing
non-standard dialects or accents is important; happily, the Yivo
TRANSCRIPTION enables us to do that better, if my knowledge of
Yiddish serves me well enough, that the orthographic rules of
English enable authors or scholars to write regional or social
variants of that language. Witness the orthographic contortions that
novelists and the like go through, with misleading results, in an
attempt to do that. (Note, by the way, that a TRANSLITERATION system
simply can not handle this, since it is simply a set of rules for
going, letter by letter, from one alphabet to another.)

Subject: Standardized transcription

Bob Goldberg complains about the "standardized" (YIVO) transcription
of Yiddish.But the YIVO transliteration is a one-to-one Latinization
of the Hebrew letters used to write Yiddish. It really doesn't
reflect any dialect, since, e.g., transliterating giml-vov-tes gives
a sequence of letters "gut," which just as giml-vov-tes is
pronounced either /gut/ or /git/. But to -transliterate-
giml-vov-tes as "git" is impossible--giml-yod-tes is /git/. I can't
see any reason to oppose the YIVO transliteration. As for the YIVO
orthoepy--it's wierd. I know of no other language where the only
acceptable stage pronunciation (a Southern Yiddish) is diametrically
opposed to the "literary norm," self-proclaimed by YIVO. As a
Litvak, I'm very happy that YIVO arbitrarily chose basically a
Litvak norm for their "literary norm." And as a teacher of Yiddish
I'm even happier, because, unfortunately, there is -no- way of
arriving at a stage pronunciation (Galitsyaner yidish) from the
orthography.

Subject: Cultural Borrowings/Sukkah lights

Zum ersthens- Not only is the Christmas/sukkah light an interesting
phenomenon, but I am also intirgued with the fact that many of the
Jewish groups who adamantly retain dress codes of an earlier era
consciously (beyond the requirements of tzinies- are rapidly
adopting American food culture- The retainig of the strieml and
spodik is important, but we all need glatt kosher moo goo gaipan-.
Cholent many be Jewish soul food, but kosher fast food (with all its
mediocrity) is on the rise. Wouldn't you have expected to see
franchises of Cholent Express and the Gala (p'scha) Gallery. Hiner
Fislech Delight and Helzele Take-Away. What does preserving a
cultural heritage mean for the glattniks. zveytns- I have discovered
the perfect sukkah light- they are strings of lights that come in
the shapes of fruits and vegatables. they look great and drive the
wasps, bees, and squirrels mishigeh.

Subject: Motl Grubyan

In response to Dovid N. Miller's posting about Motl Grubyan, I would
like to mention that according to Berl Kagan's (z"l) *Leksikon fun
Yidish-shraybers* (1986), Motl Grubyan was born in the Ukraine 1909,
and died February 9th, 1972 in Moscow.

Subject: grubian

On the etymology of grubian. Vasmer's Etym. Dict. of Russian
mentions, without preference, the possibility of derivation from
the Slavic adj. `grubyj' as well as the possibility of a loan from
German `Grobian' (first attested in 1494 in S. Brant's
Narrenschiff), which is in German a jocular derivation a la Latin,
`grobianus'from `grob'. Polish `grubian' too is considered to be a
borrowing from German. The Yiddish word, then seems to be a
borrowing from Slavic of a word which possibly was earlier borrowed
into Slavic from German (notwithstanding the place of the accent).
