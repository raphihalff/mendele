Subject: Works by Yehoshua Perle

Regarding Dafna Clifford's request for copies of three of Perle's
books (MENDELE 3.197), I can report the following:

(1) Yidn fun a gants yor.  The 1936 edition has been microfilmed by
    YIVO (reel no. Y90-1352) and is currently on back order by
    Harvard.  The 1951 edition (no. 76 in the series "Dos poylishe
    yidntum", Buenos Aires) might be available from the National
    Yiddish Book Center.  That edition was reprinted by I. L. Peretz
    Farlag in 1990 and is probably available from the publisher (14
    Brener St., Tel-Aviv, Israel); possibly from CYCO (25 E. 21st
    St., New York, NY 10010) or the Workmen's Circle Bookstore (45
    E. 33rd St., New York, NY 10016) as well.

(2) Mirl.  The 1921 edition is listed in the YIVO catalog but has
    not been microfilmed.  The 1926 edition (also Warsaw, same
    pagination, different publisher) is available from YIVO on
    microfilm (same reel as no. [1]).

(3) Mayses fun der groys-shtot.  This is not owned by YIVO, and is
    not listed under Perle's works in the articles on him in the
    Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher literatur or in Berl Kagan's
    Leksikon fun yidish-shraybers.  More details would be greatly
    appreciated.

YIVO microfilms are available at a per-reel cost of $35.  All orders
should be directed to my attention and will then be referred to our
microfilm laboratory, which handles all the processing and
invoicing.

Subject: Yiddish music in recordings

Not having much of a background in Yiddish, I have been "lurking" on
this list for many months without having the confidence to
contribute. I am neither a Yiddish-speaker nor a scholar, but rather
a musician specializing in Renaissance and Baroque music. My one
competence in the field of Yiddish is in the music; I have arranged
two collections for early instruments.

In general, recordings of Yiddish music are found in record stores
in the "International" section. Usually, Klezmer and other Yiddish
music is mixed with Israeli music, Ladino music, etc. in the bin
labeled "Jewish" or "Israeli." It is rare for music stores to have
very much of this music unless they are located in Jewish
neighborhoods. I suspect that Jay M. Lee is going to have real
trouble finding much Jewish music in Bloomington, IN. My daughter
spent five years there, and was constantly complaining that it was
almost impossible to find anything Jewish, including Menorahs,
candles, and matzah. (Perhaps IU Hillel would have some advice?)

The best place to get Yiddish recordings seems to be in Jewish
bookstores. For instance, the Israel Book Shop in Brookline, MA has
a very large selection of many different kinds of Jewish
music--Klezmer, Yiddish show tunes, Ladino, cantorials, Israeli, and
recordings intended for children.

There are a few re-issues of old recordings; there are also
contemporary Klezmer groups that have re-recorded the old songs.
Some of these groups are the Klezmer Conservatory Band, the Maxwell
Street Klezmer Band, Kapelye (which has done an interesting song
about the Chernobyl explosion), the Mazeltones, and the New York
Klezmer Ensemble. This is by no means an exhaustive list--it is just
a few of the many groups now recording the Yiddish repertory. Their
records include both songs and instrumental music. There are also
recordings of Yiddish songs by people such as Theodore Bikel.

There is a mail-order Jewish record store in LA called, I believe,
Hataklit.  They sometimes advertise in the English FORWARD with an
"800" number, but I can't find an ad right now. When I find the
number, I will post it. I have to add that this is not a
recommendation, because I have never done business with them, due
the fact that such recordings are readily available near my home.

Subject: Learning Yiddish

What would you recommend as the basic beginner's course in
learning Yiddish as a *language*.  I know that there are
courses at JCCs, colleges, and summer camps, but are there
tutorial books, etc.?
