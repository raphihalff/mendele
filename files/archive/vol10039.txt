Subject: Introduction

I am 34 years old and live in Antwerp, Belgium. My interest inYiddish
dates from when I first read Philip Roth's "Portnoy's Complaint" at 17 and
wanted to understand all the dirty bits. Only recently have I undertook to
learn to read and understand Yiddish with the amount of seriousness needed
to make the effort pay off. Thankfully there are a lot of Yiddish texts to
be found on the internet, because the Yidish books I find in a local
Jewish bookstore are a bit heavy for my size -even the lighter stuff like
"Kedoshe in der Yidishe familie-lebn". That's why, useful or not, I would
very much like to subscribe to a Yidish periodical in the Netherlands.
Could Lucas Bruyn please tell how I can contact the publishers of Grine
Medine (vol.10.036), I haven't succeeded in tracing them myself?

Respectfully,

Tom De Brabander

Subject: yiddish-maybe down, but not out

Oyfn Shvel(#319-July-September 2000) is proof positive that yiddish may be
down, but not out! It is alive and well, and page 5 fulfills a dream I used
to have that a poem would call forth deep desires to learn Yiddish and make
it live on.

Leye Shlosman speaks eloquently and funem hartsn for all zeyde-bobes in
2000. At least in my Vinkl here in Florida, the group wished to learn all,
all the new Yiddish words to identify more deeply with her and this emotion
which all had experienced.

I present the poem to speak for itself.

Subject: Yiddish dictionary

So we can't have a new Yiddish dictionary (10.038) because of professional
animosities? How painfully Jewish. Tell us. Are the parties en cas or
broyges? And how do you spell it?

Why doesn't YIVO and one other faction each publish its own edition? Then
we would have, besides to a shul we don't go to, a dictionary we don't
read.

Subject: Groyser yidisher verterbukh

In the latest issues of the Mendele list a discussion is developing on the
Groyser yidisher verterbukh and Yiddish orthography. It seems that none of
the participants has read the recently announced work by Mordkhe
Shaekhter: The Standardized Yiddish Orthography with the History of the
Standardized Yiddish Spelling - Der eynhaytlekher yidisher oysleyg, fun
folkshprakh tsu kulturshprakh, an iberblik iber der historye funem
eynhaytlekhe yidishn oysleyg. [see Mendele vol 10.003].

I would strongly recommend this fascinating and well written work. It not
only sheds light on the fate of the Groyser yidisher verterbukh, it also
shows that the battle for a standardized Yiddish orthography is over -
there is nothing left but following YIVO's 'takones'. SYO is here to stay,
and so is SYR.

What is so great about a Great Yiddish dictionary. Who wants it? Who needs
it? Once it is there, either in published form or just as a card system,
very few people will have use for it. What is important is the eventual
offspring of such a dictionary: handy, one-volume dictionaries for the use
of students of Yiddish, readers of Yiddish literature - explaining the
meaning of words, giving examples from literature. Who needs, say, the
complete Oxford Dictionary of the English language? A few scholars. Not
the average reader of English literature; even translators make do with
the Concise Oxford.

If the material brought together for the Great Yiddish Dictionary is
complete and accessible, let's forget about printing it and proceed to the
next stage. To hear that beginning students of Yiddish can hardly live
without the Great Yiddish Dictionary sounds like an exaggeration.

In Mordkhe Shaechter's "The History of the Standardized Yiddish
Spelling", recently published as part of the work "The standardized
Yiddish Orthography," we find three facsimiles of handwritten text.
1. First page of the minutes of the Yiddish Spelling Committee, New York
City, April 1921. (p. 38),
2. Letter from the Yiddish poet Rukl Fishman, dated February, 1967,
asking for orthographic guidance (p. 75),
3. Fragment of a letter from Max Weinreich concerning the "Guide to the
Standardized Yiddish Orthography", New York, 1961 (p. 83)

The first item is written in a very clear hand and easy to read; the
second is written in a more personal hand that the reader has to get
used to, but readable; the third is rather hard to read.

I give here a transcription of what I made of it. Corrections would be
appreciated.

Subject: Walter Matthau research

We are researching a biography of the actor Walter Matthau, to be published
by Taylor Publishing.  

We know that Matthau (whose original surname was Matthow) grew up on the
Lower East Side, where he was born on October 1, 1920.  When he was eleven,
he began to work as a concessionaire selling ice cream and soft drinks at
the Second Avenue Yiddish theaters.  He also began to play bit parts, and
appeared in the Yiddish musicals THE DISHWASHER (with Herman Yablokoff) and
SERGEANT NAFTULA (with Leo Fuchs).  

We are looking for additional information on Matthau and the Yiddish
theater -- and perhaps even individuals to interview who worked with him or
remember seeing him on stage, or who might recall him from the neighborhood.

Can anyone help us in any way?  Please feel free to contact us off-list.

Subject: Translation of "Di Moral"

Hello!

I am looking for help in translating some of the verses from the song "Di
Moral" ( the Moral) from the Abraham Goldfaden play Meylitz Yosher
("Righteous Advocate").  My Yiddish is quite weak!

I only have the verses in YIVO transliteration.  The verses that are
giving me difficulty are below. I have also indicated below them my rough
translations. If any one could respond with a translation, or at least
direct me to a resource, live or on-line, I would be very grateful! Thank
you!

The verses:

A yunger man geyt shpeyt bay nakht,
vayl fun shokhins vaybel halt er,
Arayn in shtub, vayl er trakht,
"In der heym iz nishtu ihr alter".
Der alter hot zikh oyfgekhapt,
Un nehmt zayn shtok aroys,
Un knakt ihm nor vu er dertapt aleh beyneh oys.
Un ven der yunger man vet kreynken,
Un zikh a tap tohn iberal,
Oy vet er gedenken di veynerneh moral...

A dameleh frizirt nit shlekht,
Nor vil zikh gornit shemen;
Zi loyft arum di gantse nakht,
Der riakh veyst zi mit vemen.
Ihr man fun kas iz shoyn zat,
Er khapt zi ohn baym tsop.
Un rayst ihr aleh hor kh'mat moralish oys fun kop.
Un az dos dameleh vet zikh friziren,
Un doh vet zayn glat iberal,
Oy vet zi damols shpiren di oysgetsupteh moral...

Rough translations:
A young man goes around late at night,
while he takes a fancy to his neighbor's wife.
In his room, he thinks:
"Her husband is not at home!"
The husband is suddenly awakened (?)
and he takes a stone(?), floor(?) outside. (Aroys=expell)??
He cracks him where ever unexpectedly, all of his bones out (??????)
And when the young man is feeling ill,
And when he gets his feeling back (?) afterall,
Oh, then he will consider the venerable moral of life.

A wife (hairdo?) is not bad.
??????
It blows around the whole night
The wind is .....??????
Her husband is full of anger
He grabs her by the braid.
He pulls out most of her hair????  The morals out of her head???
And then the wife has her (hairdo?)
And now it is smooth(?)
And then she comprehends the ??? moral.

Does anyone know who's written the song "di yunge gvardye", and what's
the origin of the melody?

Subject: George W. Bush

Without of course wishing to be seen endorsing any of the candidates Chave
Respitz's note (10.038) set me thinking.

For a start there is a yiddish saying for those cognately challenged:
az got vil shtrofn a min ho'orets leygt er im arayn an orn koydesh vort in
moyl.

But just imagine Bush speaking yiddish.
di velt darf mikh hobn vi a lokh in top
Florida far Gore? a make un a poyker
On his drink driving aveyre: s'iz geven yom kipurim.

blabt gezint,

Dovid Herskovic
