Subject: Shabash

[Reply to inquiry in Vol. 24.001 and Vol. 23, passim]

Moyshe Valdman makes good points but nevertheless it appears that Persian shabash referring to money given to musicians at a wedding was borrowed via some Turkic language into Yiddish where over time it became confused with shabes.  Unfortunately the recent Yiddish French and yiddish English dictionaries list shabash as a word of modern Yiddish which plainly is false.

I don't have the energy to write all this up but if someone were interested in helping it might make an interesting story.

Subject: Homer in Yiddish

[Reply to inquiry in Vol. 24.001]

Golde (Golda) Patz, who was murdered in Ponar in 1941, had written a children's illustrated version of the Odyssey and the Illiad that was published in Berlin in 1924.

Subject: Dizhdig/vizhdig 

My grandmother who came to the USA from Siedlce Gobernia in Russia/Poland used the term “dizhdig” or “vizhdig” to describe atmospheric conditions which “were heavy on the chest”/ ”made it difficult to breathe comfortably”.  I cannot find either word in any of the three Yiddish/English dictionaries I have.  Can anyone tell me the actual meaning and derivation of the term(s)?

Link answering Marjorie Hirshan’s questions about Biro [see Vol. 24.001]. Alas all in French as are Biro’s books! But, Marjorie, I believe Bernice Buckstone could help you with the translation.

With best regards,

Subject: French horn

[See Vol. 24.001]

As the German term for French Horn is Waldhorn, I think it is safe to assume that the Yidish will be the same.

Subject: About words in Yiddish that begin with "אוי" [oy]

There are many words in Yiddish that in English begin with "au" and in Yiddish is generally therefore “oy” as in the following words: "oyto,” “oytomatish,” “oytonomye.” There seems to be a dialect however which instead of using ”oy” the use of “av” [pasekh-alef + tsvey vovn] is used instead. In Harkavy's dictionary, all the above words are found as that dialect, and are therefore spelled as follows: "avto,” “avtomatish,” "avtonomye.” I wanted to know who can help me with the dialectics-in which neighborhoods/regions was it more acceptable to use this dialect? Is it perhaps more acceptable in the Lithuanian areas? Who knows enough about this to perhaps guide me in these questions I have?

Subject: “Kitchen countertop”

Does anyone have any source of how to say kitchen countertop in Yiddish? I haven't found a word in any of my dictionaries, and I've made extensive searches outside of the dictionaries too. Would anyone perhaps know?

Malky and Yonason Felendler

[The moderators suggest “tombank.”]

Date: December 14
Subject: Malkhes-broyt

In my grandfather Louis Sugerman's novel "Der Getlicher Ben-Tziyon" (c.1948), in connection with Purim preparations in late 19th-century Ukraine he mentions “Malkhes-broyt" (lechem malkhut), apparently a form of baked goods. I have been unable to find any description of this bread. Can you help, or suggest where I might look?

Many thanks,
Laurence Libin
