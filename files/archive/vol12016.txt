Subject: Call for Papers: 6th Symposium for Yiddish Studies in Germany

6th Symposium for Yiddish Studies in Germany

Trier, 22-24 September 2003

The Sixth Symposium for Yiddish Studies in Germany will be held
September 22-24 at University of Trier. This annual Yiddish Sym-posium
is organized alternately by the Yiddish programs at the universities of
Trier and Duesseldorf and is intended to offer students and scholars
the possibility to present their research, exchange ideas and put
forward questions for discussion.

You are invited to submit abstracts for 20 min. papers until June 1,
2003. Presentations can be held in Yiddish or German.

As usual, we have decided not to devote the symposium to a single topic
in order not to exclude any of the fields of research within Yiddish
Studies. Interdisciplinary papers with a connection to Yiddish Studies
are welcome.

The symposium is open to all those interested in Yiddish Studies. There
is no conference fee. We do ask participants to register as soon as
possible at the address below.

Regularly updated information can be found under:
http://www.uni-trier.de/uni/fb2/germanistik/jidd_start.html 
We are also happy to answer questions by mail, fax or e-mail.

Dear Mendelyaner,
    
Does anyone know if we have equivalent expressions in Yiddish to the
English, "de jure" and "de facto?"  I'm looking for something with the
same legalistic connotation as these Latin phrases, maybe something
from Halakha or Talmudic terminology.  I would appreciate any
suggestions very much.  You can write me directly via e-mail, and many
thanks in advance.

Subject: New Yiddish book and CDs

This is to announce the publication of an exciting new resource for
students of Yiddish, fluent readers of Yiddish and people who would
like to improve their Yiddish reading skills:

Mit groys fargenign: hundert yor yidishe literatur/ With Great
Pleasure: A Century of Yiddish Writing. Compiled and edited by Heather
Valencia.

The book consists of prose pieces and a selection of poems in Yiddish
from the past hundred years, providing a mix of stimulating texts in a
variety of styles - humorous, dramatic, moving and lyrical.  Writers
from the classic Yiddish canon are included as are contemporary writers
from Israel and Europe. Women writers are particularly well
represented. The texts are short (ranging from about two to about ten
pages) and each text is provided with a short introduction in English
to give the reader an idea of its contents and footnotes which appear
on the relevant page for ease of use. These notes explain Hebrew
terminology and specific idioms, give suggested translations of phrases
which may cause problems for the less experienced reader of Yiddish,
and comment on items of religious, social or historical significance.
There is a 30 page glossary, short biographical notes on the authors,
photographs of almost all the writers and suggested further reading.  
The book is designed to be used by individuals, reading groups or
Yiddish courses.

Eight CDs accompany the volume, on which the stories and poems are read
by Khayele Beer, Barry Davis, Pesakh Fiszman, and Jeremy Grant. The
book and the CDs are published by the Oxford Institute for Yiddish
Studies, now part of the London Jewish Cultural Centre.

The book and eight CDs are available from: The Jewish Book Center of
the Workmen=B9s Circle, 45 East 33rd Street, New York, NY 10016 tel:
(1) 212-889-6800 x 285 fax: (1) 212-889-8519 email: book@circle.org

Price:$38.00 plus $7.00 for domestic US purchase or plus $11.00 for
