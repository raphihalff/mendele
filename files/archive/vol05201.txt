Subject: Sakoneskik nudnikes

A dank Peter Kluehs:

Ikh hob gehat a sakh hanoe fun di nutslekhe lektsies vegn nudnikes, un vi
azoy me ken gefinen a nudnik umgerikht in mitn gas, in bod, in kantor,
untern shtetl, afn boydem, un azoy vayter.  Es iz take sakone-nefoshes.
Kh'ob geveynt mit heyse treyrn leyenendik di umetike mayses.  Ikh hob
gelakht oykh. Nisht gehaltn bay di zaytn lakhndik, ober take gelakht.

Ikh vil nor visn eyn zakh.  Ven a nudnik heybt on redn un redt un redt on
a sof, on an oyfher, meg men im iberhakn?  Ikh hob moyre. Es iz meglekh
az ven me hakt im iber, vert fun eyn nudnik tsvey nudnikes.  Azoy iz es
geveyn mitn kishef-makhers lernyingl (Sorcerer's Apprentice).  Ir
gedenkt?  Nisht azoy? Un az me hakt iber di tsvey oysgevaksene naye
nudnikes, ken vern fun tsvey fir.  Un azoy vayter.  Oy vey, me tor nisht
trakhtn fun dem.  Me ken meshuge vern, nisht ruen baytog, nisht shlofn
baynakht!

A hint to some still only partially conversant with Yiddish.  The pun
rests on the word component, hakn (to chop) in iberhakn (to interrupt).
Puns are often untranslatable.  A prosaic lesson.  Farvos nisht?

Subject: "Tush"

Regarding Zellig Bach's post on "tokhes" and its American variants, I'd
like to report that I own a useful cushion for the use of those afflicted
with a sore tail-bone. A semi-circular piece at the rear is missing so
that when one puts the cushion on a chair and sits on it, one's tailbone
does not touch the chair.

The manufacturers call this item a "tush-cush."

Subject: Shamus

In today's (Sunday) Times acrostic,  the word "shamus" is listed with the
connotation of "dick," "snoop."  In Webster's Dictionary, the definition
for "shamus" reads: [prob. fr. Yiddish shames shammes; prob. fr. a
jocular comparison of the duties of a sexton and those of a store
detective[!]  This seems a little farfetched to me.  Does anyone know
more?

Subject: I.B.Singer complete works

When discussing a given story by Bashevis Singer, there is often a
problem in finding the story.  He has written so many stories, many of
which can be found in single volumes.  Although there are sets of the
complete works of Sholem Aleichem, Peretz, Mendele, etc., I am not aware
of a set of the complete works of Bashevis Singer - either in Yiddish or
in English.  My question is: Have the complete works of Singer been
published in a single set of volumes?  If not, is there a complete
bibliography of his works available anywhere?

Subject: Eliyahu Hanovi

I'm beginning these days  a research: "Eliyahu Hanovi's Revelation in
Yiddish Literature".

If anyone can help me with any references or ideas about this subject, I'd
be grateful.

Subject: Counting rhymes

Does anyone know of any books on counting rhymes, play rhymes, and very
simple songs for very young children in Yiddish?

Thanks,

Shayndel Tallan
