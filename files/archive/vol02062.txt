Another theory holds that Mendeleniks go to Yidish-vokh in
August, thus spending their time oif shvimn, netsbol,
shpatsirn in vald un kolerlay yidishredndike zakhn, rather
than at their computers.  However, this theory was been
disproven by the low Mendelenik turnout at yidish-vokh.
Plan to be free for the week leading up to Labour Day next
year!

I saw Mordkhe at the Yugntruf yidish-vokh this past week,
and asked him about the new food dictionary, which he's
been working on for some time.  He says it'll be out in
April or May. In the meantime he's getting the revised
edition of Yiddish II published.

You might check with him at the yidish-lige (212-787-6675,
in NYC) to see if they can rustle you up a copy or more
while you are waiting for the second edition.

Yidish-vokh was great, by the way.  65 people this time
around. There's been a big change since we started going
three years ago: everyone's kids are growing up!  This year
there were lots and lots of kids running around, all
speaking Yiddish with each other. A shame more MENDELEniks
couldn't make it (Dovid Braun and Meylekh Viswanath were
there).  Simone and I ran a Yiddish version of the game
show "TalkAbout", which went over very well.

Subject: re: schmuck and putz

The "On Language" column by Philologus in the Forward (by
itself worth the price of admission) has discussed these
words in earlier columns.  Now, on Aug. 28, an interesting
item: someone overhearing Brooklyn yeshiva students
referring to someone as an "80-90".

    In response to his inquiry about this arcane
    expression, he was informed that 80 and 90 are the
    numerical values of the Hebrew letters Peh and Tsadi,
    which spell _potz_.  This is in effect.. a cryptogram
    of a cryptogram.  Since in Yiddish a _peh-tsadi_ is a
    slang word for "a putz" in its own right, we are indeed
    an ingenious, let alone mathematically-inclined people.

Peh-tsadi.  In my (orthodox yet) family it was pronounced
peh-tsadik and in case you didn't get the drift there were
peh-tsadikim: over-aggressive pishke collectors, self-
important shul turkeys and other such Tartuffes.

Thus "80-90" is not only ingenious but an interesting
counter-spin by some of the very people who just might have
been targets of the original taunt.  One could even argue
that "80-90" constitutes avoidance-behavior on the part of
those who well understood the unflattering reference to
peyes and other marks of conspicuous yet somehow suspect
religiosity.

Sociolinguistic note: peh-tsadik was used--at last in the
U.S.--at a time when orthodoxy was nominal to begin with
and on the wane.  A young man openly wearing tsitses in say
1930 or 1940 would have been bizarre.  Now that the world
has changed, I wonder if anyone--even one strongly opposed
to the present climate of competitive frumkayt--would say
it.  I think not.
