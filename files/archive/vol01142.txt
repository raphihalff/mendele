Subject: Introduction

Dear Noyekh,

   I found your note adding me to the Mendele list this
afternoon. The address is correct.  Full name is Margaret
E. Winters - my Hebrew name is Malkah, but I don't have any
occasion to use it, so let's leave it at Margaret.

   I am on the faculty at Southern Illinois University -
chair of the Department of Foreign Languages and
Literatures where I teach French.  My specialty is
historical linguistics - I work in French and Latin.  I
spoke Yiddish at home as a young child and then attended a
Shalom Aleichem (I am *not* good at transliteration)
Folkshul for several years.  Since I live in a hidden
corner of the Midwest, I rarely speak Yiddish, but am
interested in what other people are doing - some day I'll
want to combine it with my training as a linguist. I hope
this does as an introduction.  I look forward to re-
ceiving the list and (efsher) participating.

Margaret

Subject: A raysenish mit faygel (tsum tsveytn mol)

Long stretches of road between swamps and marshes are
conducive to thinking Yiddish thoughts.  Such as: how the
hell do I describe what I'm doing right now to my elderly
ladies at the Hebrew Home?  (I say elderly and I mean
elderly.  When I reached 70 I thought that maybe at last
they would treat me as one of them.  A nekhtiker tog.  By
them I'm still a boytchik in mid-career.)  Hershel Bershady
advises a frontal assault: bird-watching is feygl-kukn.
But much as I want to accomodate my old friend, I just
can't do it.  Here's why.

First, feygl-kukn ain't got no class; it has, as they say
auf Deutsch, no schmiss, no verve.  Second, it's an
Americanism that would probably be misunderstood wherever
American ways are not well known (this just might include
sections of Brooklyn).  What would a Yiddish- speaker in
Buenos Aires or Antwerp make of a feygl-kuker?  That such a
person is some sort of mashgiach. But who ever heard of a
woman mashgiach?  Un vos gor mboydek zayn geshlokhtene
oyfes mit binoklen?

So we're not there yet.

What's needed are terms that are ekht-Yiddish and which if
possible set off reverberations, give us pleasure.  And
where do we find these words?  In Hebrew or Aramaic
naturally.  And it turns out that we already have a long
list of models, viz. the 'bal/bar' constructions (bal dikduk,
bal tshuve, bal khoyv, bar mazel, etc.).  So my nominees
are: bal oyfes and bar shemoys.  An added interesting thing
about both terms is that they involve allusions to a quite
different sort of character, i.e. a bal moyfes or bal shem.

But in fact there may be much that the bird watcher and the
miracle worker have in common.  Most of the ones I know
aren't really watchers at all, they're bird _namers_.
Anybody who has ever spent any time with emesse farbrente
birdists knows what I'm talking about: they're compulsive
collectors of something called a life list and they have
next to zero interest in anything outside of that list.
(Here are two ounces of feathers born north of the Arctic
Circle and bound for as far as Antarctica before making the
return trip.  Interesting?  Fascinating?  Not to a life-
lister unless he never saw it before.)  The bal shem knows
names and incantations that presumably keep us out of
trouble.  The typical bird watcher believes somewhere in
his pinhead brain that if she can only get to see every
species there is to see he'll live forever.

Therefore another expression to describe what a bal oyfes
does.  Take the remarkable passage in Tanakh that tells
of the creation of the birds: ..vayovey el-ha'adam lir'ot
ma-yikro-lo v'chol asher yikro-lo ha'adam nefesh chayo hu
shmo.  Adam did the naming!  (He too must have felt
overwhelmed and maybe scared by all that exotic stuff in
the garden.  To name is to control.)  So my suggestion is:
khazeres maase bereshis.  Or, if the cabalists among us
object, how about khazeres maase Odom?

That way, when my ladies ask me again: 'vu geyt ir'? I can
answer: 'ikh fur af khazeres maase bereshis'.  That's got
a kling to it, Hershel khaver.

I don't imagine for a minute that these suggestions will
please most of you.  Maybe Hershel Basser can come up with
some Talmudic or Mishnaic terms that will work better.  My
more serious motive in all of this is, as seditiously as
necessary, to start a counter-movement to the prevailing
method by which Yiddish terms are coined.  I'm thinking for
instance of what some have suggested for "word processor",
a term which even in English ought to have earned its
inventor 3 life sentences followed by the garrote and being
boiled in oil.

Ikh hof az ir vet zikh alle meyashev zayn un oystrakhtn
khotch a por gute verter.  Anisht vel ikh aykh dergeyn di
yorn.
