Subject: Introduction

In response to the request from our shames, I would like to introduce
myself (actually, I had been meaning to anyway; I've been on Mendele for
several months and have been enjoying it greatly).  I'm a historian; I've
written about women's movements and movements of the left, in the US. I
teach at UC Santa Cruz.  I began learning Yiddish on my own, as a
teenager, from the Weinreich textbook, which I found in a bookstore on
New York's Lower East Side.  My father, whose first language had been
Yiddish, refused to teach it to me, and I wanted access to the culture
that he wanted to leave behind. I am now trying to actually become
literate in Yiddish; following Mendele is very helpful.  I am enormously
impressed by the level of the discussion, not only the erudition and wit,
but also the warmth and generosity - in fact, comradeliness - of
exchanges. I hope that at some point I will know enough to be able to
participate.

Subject: Yiddish publishing and 'language death'

Is Yiddish a dying language?  Not from where I sit.  I'm in the middle of
writing an article for the National Yiddish Book Center's
"Pakntreger/Book Peddler," on "Yiddish Book Publishing Today," and will
be devoting a significant amount of space to the burgeoning Yiddish
publishing "industry" (40 to 50 titles per year, probably an
underestimate) in the Hasidic sector.  I believe that publishing can
serve as one indicator of a language's vitality -- it is certainly one of
the more visible such indicators.  In any event, perhaps the most
striking thing about the "Hasidic Yiddish" genre is that it is primarily
aimed at young people, even toddlers, who possess a native command of the
language.  There is some evidence that those who write these books are
aware of the need to reinforce the quality of their readers' Yiddish.

I believe that Joshua Fishman has discussed the sociolinguistic side of
this issue, though I do not have a ready reference for that.
Demographically speaking, one can posit that the number of native Yiddish
speakers, far from declining, though small, may actually be increasing.
Consequently, I hardly believe that what goes on in Jerusalem, Bene
Berak, Antwerp, Williamsburgh, Borough Park, New Square, Monsey,
Outremont/Mile End, Boisbriand, and elsewhere, is of no significance, as
we contemplate the present and future of Yiddish.

In short, on the basis of today's publishing trends in Yiddish, I suspect
that future generations of doomsayers will continue to be baffled by the
tenacity of mame-loshn and its speakers.

Subject: Is Yiddish Dying?

How amusing. As I sit here reading Stan's assertion that the survival of
Yiddish is artificial, I'm in my kitchen and my four kids (ages 11 down
to 4) are eating supper. Except that instead of eating, they're yammering
away at each other at high speed, in Yiddish. I guess Yiddish is dead,
but we never noticed. Yiddish is the first language of each of them.

And no, we are not among those "who demonstrate in every possible way
their attachment to Jewish life in 16th-century Poland". But Stan's
description of chassidim as "rather pathetic groups" is uncalled-for,
insulting and inaccurate. Quite apart from whether one admires their
lifestyle, it's a fact that there are thousands of chassidim in Brooklyn
alone (leaving aside Jerusalem and Bnai Brak) who use Yiddish as a daily
language of life and family. These are large communities, growing larger
exponentially (averaging perhaps 6-8 children per family), and this
community of Yiddish speakers, rather than "pathetic", is growing.
(Simple evidence is found in the market: the number of kids' books, tapes
and board games available in Yiddish, for this community, is steadily
increasing.)

Subject: Is Yiddish Dying?

Here, in golis in Boynton Beach, which less than thirty years ago was
Yudenreyn, (now inundated with Jewish and Yiddish culture - a miracle?)
it behooves me to answer an Israeli on Mendele about the state of
Yiddish, with a cherished quotation by his earliest prime minister.

      "Any Jew who does not believe in miracles is not a realist."

An article in the Forward by Michael Skakun, "Yiddish Will Rise Again"
tells of the changes (miracles?) we know so well where this despicable
"jargon" has risen to academic study status in universities worldover.

Another miracle is the 10-year old Rena Costa Chair for Yiddish Studies
at Bar Ilan University. For many years, Israel was the least hospitable
place for the acceptance and growth of Yiddish. When the chair was
established, only three grade schools in our Jewish homeland taught
Yiddish. Today, 52 schools have 24 separate courses taught only in
mameloshn. 3,000 students are learning Yiddish in Israel's grade schools,
and its director, George Cohen, speaks of the Center's presence in Russia
and Ukraine via seminars for teacher training in regional schools.
(Another miracle in view of Stalin's murders and murderous policies?)
"Yet even amid these lively stirrings of educational restoration, one can
still hear the naysayers who nurse an active malice toward Yiddish or the
soothsayers cum-undertakers who, sounding a one-note dirge over and over
again, cannot bury the language quickly enough."

Perhaps, the reports of its imminent death, are greatly exaggerated.
