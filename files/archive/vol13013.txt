Subject: Re: vos heyst 'a mentsh'

Faced with a fellow immigrant from her home town (Sokolifke, near Kiev) who
was essentially a "proster yid" but had done well in business and  was
parading about, bragging of his success, demeaning his competitors  and
"putting on airs,"  my grandmother would sometimes mutter:  "Ekh mir a
mentsh>"  There was no mistaking her meaning: this man was the antithesis of
the decency, composure and respect for one;s fellows that are among the
hallmarks of a genuine mentsh.  Is it not possible that in "A Mensh fun
Buenos Aires" Sholem Aleichem used mentsh in just the same ironic sense?

Re:  Mechl Asheri's interesting comment on Sholom Aleichem's use of the word
"mentsh" to refer to a procurer in the white slave trade:

Since, in the story, the reprehensible, non-mentsh-like character refers to
HIMSELF as a mentsh, maybe we can conclude that the author is using the term
ironically.  This would be in line with Sholom Aleichem's practice generally.

Subject: Questionaire: The use of Yiddish in America

I'm Bianca Feenstra. I live in Holland and I need people who are willing to
fill in a questionaire about the use of Yiddish in America (topic I'm
rsearching).Please help me! I really need some people who can tell me some
things about their use of Yiddish and I've tried to find people in all
possible ways, but nothing worked for me until now. It will take about 10
minutes to fill in and you will be of great help to me.

If you are willing to fill in the questionaire, please mail me at:
feens100@iec.nhl.nl.

Thanks very much.

Subject: Chemical literature in Yiddish

Dear Mendelists (or maybe, Mendeleveyens?),

I wish to let you all know that my article, "Khemye: Chemical Literature in
Yiddish", has just been published in the _Bulletin for the History of
Chemistry_, the official journal dedicated to chemical history by the
American Chemical Society, Vol. 29, Number 1, 2004, pp. 21-29.
Interestingly, the editor chose one of my figures, that of industrial uses
of shvebl-zayers (sulfuric acid), as the cover picture.

To find out more about the article, contact

Dr. Paul R. Jones, Editor
University of Michigan
Department of Chemistry

Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1055
USA
prjones@umich.edu

I believe my article is the first survey of scientific literature in
Yiddish. It covers 20th-century chemical literature, from complete textbooks
to teachers' guides, news for the layperson, references (e.g., dictionaries
and thesauri), and propaganda, from both Eastern Europe and the USA.

Subject: oy iz dos a riml

Here's a question about the meaning of a Yiddish expression: "oy is
dos a riml"  Are any of your subscribers able to help?

Subject: Der Emes and Minkhen

I work at the National Yiddish Book Center and I'm trying to learn more
about our collection, particularly books published in the Soviet Union just
before and during WWII, and books published in Europe directly after WWII.
I'm having trouble finding information about the two Yiddish publishers who
seemed to be the major printers in these locations during these times:

Der Emes- the Soviet press edited by Leyb Strongin during WWII.

Minkhen- A post-WWII German D.P. camp press.

Any information on either of these publishers would be very helpful.

Thanks,

Aaron Rubinstein
