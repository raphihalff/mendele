Subject: Nebbich

Disclaimer:  While I am certainly no linguist I believe that some of those
participating in recent discussions concerning the word "nebbish" -- or
"nebbich" (its German spelling) -- have been barking up the wrong tree.  It
is not "Yinglish" at all -- or rather, that form was by no means "invented"
in America.  Rather, "nebbich" (with "ch" probably sounding closer to "sh"
than "kh," to American ears) was likely brought to America by 19th-century
German-speaking Jewish immigrants.

See, for example, the following lexicons of Yiddishisms in Western European
countries:

(1) Hans Peter Althaus, Kleines Lexikon deutscher W”rter jiddischer Herkunft
(Mnchen: C. H. Beck, 2003).  On pages 150-151 Althaus lists the following
entries, followed by copious examples of their use by German-speaking
authors and in both specialized and general German dictionaries:

nebbich (interjection).  Two examples among many cited by Althaus:  Der Mann
hat newwich sei(n) ganz Vermeech >Verm”gen< verlore (source: Frankfurter
W”rterbuch); Der Jngste ist nebbich ungeeignet (source:  Karl Kraus, Werke
7, 147).

Nebbich (noun), with various definitions.  Attested to in Frankfurt, Berlin
and Vienna dialects; literary example:  du Nebbich (Karl Kraus, Werke 5,
313).

Althaus also lists, separately, [das] Nebbich (defined as "'Nichts,' ad
hoc-Ausdruck"); [der] Nebbich-Philologe (citing correspondence between Betty
Scholem and her son Gershom); [die] Nebbichkeit; [der] Nebbichthiosaurus.

(2) H. Beem, She'erit; resten van een taal (Assen: Van Gorcum, 1967). Beem's
spelling is "nebbisch" (p. 83) and he describes it as an interjection while
also noting the Dutch spellings "nebbisj" and "nebbis."

Subject: alef-beyz lid

A while ago there was a question about alef-beyz lider and I posted asong I
had by Nat Zumoff of Cleveland.  In going through other material, I see I
also have a version that fits to the same "Do, a Deer" melody, although I do
not know if it was intended for that tune.  It is from Frida Grapa de
Cielak's Book 3 of her wonderful Arele series of texts for children,
published in Mexico.  It is still in print and available.  If any of you
teach Yiddish to children, I highly recommend these three volumes.

Subject: Mendele mit yidishe oysyes

Over quite some time I have received and appreciated the mateials from
Mendele, however the Yiddish in Roman alphabet is almost impossible for me
to follow.  I feel that I am standing on my head trying to decipher the
transliteration.  Is it possible to send Yiddish in Hebrew alphabet and
continue the English in Roman Alphabet?  For those of us who are Yiddish
readers, I believe it would improve our intellectual comfort.

Thank you.
