Subject: Beheyme

Having just waded through a three-week accrual of messages after
getting home from a short trip abroad, I would like to enter a
brief, if belated, comment on this topic.

I was intrigued by the Arnold Kuzmack's question as to when the
Hebrew term "b'hemah" was first taken out of its literal sense of
"beast, most usually a herbivorous domesticated animal" and  applied
figuratively to a stupid human being.

What I came up with was an injuction in the Talmud (Pesakhim 49b)
against marrying the daughter of an ignoramus (`am ha'aretz), citing
Deuteronomy 27,21: "Arur shokhev `im kol b'hemah (Cursed be he who
lieth with any manner of beast)".  Rashi explains: `Since they are
like a "b'hemah" in that they have no understanding'.

From: Seymour Axelrod <PTYAXEL@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu>
Subject: Uses of *haynt*

The usual meaning of the Yiddish word *haynt* is "today".  But there
is another usage, in which *haynt* is a kind of transition word,
something like the English "now" in "Now, [given what has already
been said,] imagine what would happen if ..."   A Yiddish speaker
might say *Haynt shtelt zikh for vos volt geven az ...*   Another
usage implying a type of transition is given in _Yidish Tsvey_ by
Mordkhe Schaechter, who translates *haynt* in a poem by Kh. N.
Bialik as "furthermore, moreover".  Neither of these definitions is
given by Harkavy or Weinreich.

My question: Is either usage related to the *haynt* meaning "today"?
The first has at least some possible temporal sense, but the second,
none.

Subject: Help for a Yiddishist

Ikh lern zikh tsur tsayt yidish, un I was thinking of asking thru
MENDELE for someone who might be willing to help me with questions.
The post would

- explain what I expect: answers to questions about grammar,
  sentence structure, vocabulary, context, ...; a few a week; I was
  thinking of including a few questions I currently have as examples
  of the sort of tortuous questions I might have

- explain what level I'm at (I can read YKg and understand 80% of it
  without a dictionary); add that I speak German fluently, a great
  help

I'm looking for someone fluent in Yiddish of course. German skills
would also be welcome. I would [try and] write the post in Yiddish
of course!

A groysn dank,
Pierre[le]
