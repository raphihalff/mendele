Date: June 4, 1991
From: Golda Werman
Subject: A translation from I.B. Singer

I'm delighted to announce that Golda Werman, who has
published translations of Peretz and Bergelson as well
as a forthcoming volume of Ansky, has sent us a beauti-
ful translation of Isaac Bashevis' first published
story, "Old Age".  Published in 1925, it won the young
author a prize in a newspaper competition.

Mendele and editor are duly grateful.  The story has 
been archived and will be sent to anyone who asks for
it.

Dear Friend,
 
I would like to call your attention to a new scholarly
journal devoted to the study of Yiddish language and
literature of all periods.  Initiated by members of
Haifa University's Department of Hebrew and Comparative
Literature and of its Yiddish Studies Program, the new
periodical will be called "Chulyot; dapim lemechkar
sifrut yidish vetarbuta" ('Links; for the study of
Yiddish literature and culture').  Its format and
character will parallel "Dapim lemechkar besifrut"
('Journal of Literary Research'), seven volumes of
which have appeared to date.
 
The proposed journal will include scholarly articles
and texts in the areas of Yiddish literature, language,
folklore, children's literature, theater, press, bibli-
ography, literary history, as well as of comparative
literature; it will be hospitable to letters, archival
materials and neglected texts. The journal will be in
Hebrew and will be directed especially to the Hebrew-
speaking reader eager to learn about the world of
Yiddish culture.  It is hoped, too, that more and more
Israeli scholars will themselves join in the study of
this large part of the Jewish cultural heritage.  The
journal should bring to the Hebrew-reading academic
public, general reader and lover of Yiddish the best of
Yiddish scholarship from the world over.  

Contributors will write in the language they customari-
ly use.  Articles submitted in languages other than
Hebrew, if accepted, will be translated into Hebrew. 
Abstracts of all articles will appear in both Yiddish
and English.  Articles should be between twenty and
thirty double-spaced typewritten quarto pages long. God
willing, the first issue will appear at Passover 1992 -
- assuming, too, that contributors submit their arti-
cles by the end of 1991.  

Shalom Luria will be the first editor of
"Chulyot"  Many colleagues have already indi-
cated their willingness to serve on the journal's
Editorial Council and to referee submitted articles.
The organizational and procedural details will surely
fall into place as plans go forward.  Unfortunately, it
will not be possible to make payment to authors.  It is
hoped that this will in no way deter researchers from
sending us their work.

It is vital that as wide a circle as possible share in
this endeavor. I invite you to join us in building
"Chulyot" ('Links').

I will be happy to hear your comments and suggestions
and to answer any of your questions.
 
Yours truly,
 
Shalom Luria
 
P.S.  Would you be kind enough to post this letter or
pass it on to a colleague.

I believe that Mendele would be a good place for re-
views and also for announcements of new books and of
reviews of new books.  I hope to be active in Mendele 
next semester. I expect it to be a lot of fun.
