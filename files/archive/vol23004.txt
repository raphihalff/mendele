The shamosim regretfully announce the death on June 28 of Mikhl (Marvin) Herzog
(1927-2013), accomplished linguist and longtime professor of Yiddish at Columbia
University, at the age of 85. He was buried on July 1 in his native city, Toronto, Canada.

Among his many achievements, Herzog devoted his life to completing the Language and
Cultural Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry (LCAAJ) after the deaths of his mentors Max and
Uriel Weinreich and to furthering the field of Yiddish Studies. He was also, in the words
of Mendele founder Noyekh Miller, "...the very first subscriber to Mendele and was for a
number of years a very active contributor.  He helped set the tone for Mendele as a
serious list."

In the words of Sam Norich, publisher of the English Forward and the Yiddish Forverts,

"Mikhl was the great strategist and impresario of Yiddish studies as an academic
discipline in the last third of the 20th century. A student and colleague of Uriel and of
Max Weinreich, he took on the most important research projects they left undone: the
Great Dictionary of the Yiddish Language and the Language and Culture Atlas of
Ashkenazic Jewry. But it was as an academic organizer that he had his greatest success
and impact. In a field that had no undergraduate majors in any American university, he
created the Uriel Weinreich Summer Program in Yiddish Language, Literature and
Culture to identify and inspire young scholars to go into the field of Yiddish studies. He
marshaled the resources of Columbia's linguistics department and of YIVO to create an
area studies program leading to a Columbia PhD. The Linguistics Department at
Columbia could have been a procrustean bed for most of his students who were more
interested in literature and culture than they were in linguistics. YIVO was chronically
short of funds and a kind of academic structure better understood in Europe than it was in
post-war America. But it had the spirit, legacy and agenda of Max and Uriel Weinreich
and scholars like Raphael Mahler, Isaiah Trunk, Shlomo Noble, Lucjan Dobroszycki,
Bina Weinreich, Shoshke Erlich, Chane Mlotek (tsu lange yor,) librarians and archivists
like Dina Abramowicz, Bella Weinberg, Zachary Baker, Pearl Berger, Marek Web,
Fruma Mohrer and Roz Schwartz. Mikhl augmented that singular band of teachers with
visiting scholars from Israel, Europe and America: Dan Miron, Benjamin Harshav,
Barbara Kirshenblatt Gimblett, Avrom Nowersztern, Ruth Wisse, Robert Seltzer and
others. The result: most of the senior professors in the field of Yiddish studies teaching in
American and European universities today were students Mikhl brought to the field. Of
all his achievements as legislator, diplomat, architect, author of the Declaration of
Independence, third president of the US, Thomas Jefferson chose only one credit for his
tombstone: founder of the University of Virginia. Mikhl can rightly have on his keyver
the title of founder of the field of Yiddish studies as an academic discipline in the
American university."
