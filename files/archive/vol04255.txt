Subject: Gefonfet

I must agree with Abe Bloom (Mendele 4-284) that gefonfet is equivalent
to the expression "muttered in his beard." My parents, two people with
very opposing viewpoints, would read the Forvitz in the evening and have
discussions on every topic. When my mother ran out of a logical reply,
she would start to hum and my father would say "in beardl aron". Now,
after all these years, I realize he was saying she lost the argument, and
was fonfenen. :-)

Anno Siegel:

Most likely an entirely different word, i.e. "gedabert". "dabern" is
loshn-koydesh word; Weinreich says: 'babble, (contemptuous) talk', which
seems to fit your context pretty well.

The trilled "r" is presumably a stylistic nuance of Bikel's, adding the
stigma of the less-common version of "r" to the stigma of the word.

[Mikhl Herzog:]

Could "seyg" be an abbreviated form of our old friend "shegets"?

Subject: Zhe

Dialogue between Ellen Prince and the undersigned:

Zellig Bach  (quoted by Ellen Prince):  "_Zhe_ is not a word in its own
right, nor is it a suffix.  It cannot begin or end a sentence.  Nor can
it stand alone.  Unlike marine barnacles that attach themselves
permanently to ship bottoms or floating timber, _zhe_ is a "floater," and
is usually tacked on to one or another word, according to the speaker's
choice, occasion, and mood" (from Mendele, Vol. 4.251, 2).

Ellen Prince:  That's what it means to be a particle or a clitic, which
is what we've been calling it.

Z.B.  Yes, but _der khilek_ [the difference] is that what I wrote can be
understood by many, while particle or clitic is understood by specialists
only.  Linguists need, of course, a precise and concise terminology, but
I wonder:  Could not the two styles be combined where a general
readership is concerned?

End of dialogue (reprinted with permission).

As I stated on several previous occasions, I sense in the Mendele
khavruse a strong, unquenchable desire to learn Yiddish--grammar, syntax,
etymology, history.

It should therefore be helpful if specialists, when using technical, or
even semi-technical terms, would explain them, if I may say in "chewable"
prose, for lay members on our list (and I count myself among them).

By way of example:  In his recent column _On Language_  in the New York
Times Magazine (12/25/94), William Safire used the term "enclitic," and
promptly explained it:  "An 'enclitic' is an attachable word-element,
like a suffix, from the Greek _klit_, slope." Although I believe I
defined _zhe_  correctly in non-technical terms, as shown in Ellen's
quotation from my posting and in her comment, Safire's explanation of
'enclitic" helped me even to get a better grasp of 'clitic.'

I firmly believe that the suggestion to explain technical terms should,
in the long run, be reciprocally beneficial.

Subject: Lemberg/Lemberik

In a previous posting I called Lemberg the Yiddish and German name for
Lviv/Lvov/Lwow.  According to Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter (_Laytish
mame-loshn_, vol. 1, pp. 34-35), however, there is a tradition for using
the form _Lemberik_ as the Yiddish name and considering _Lemberg_ as an
unnecessary Germanism in Yiddish, i.e., as being _daytshmerish_.

Al kheyt...

Subject: Wish for the New Year

Convention?  This electronic phenomenon is a kind of convention.  Mendele
is a meeting ground for a wide range of personal involvement with Yiddish
language and literature.  A healthy variety.

Now at this latter end of 1994, I wish all on Mendele a freylekhn, a
gliklekhn nayem sekularn yor.  Anshot "New Year's Resolutions" vil ikh
tsugebn epes andersh.  I'd like to share an impression, and a wish.

Impression: I see many introductions, but not so many follow through with
contributions.  Some seem to be intimidated by those who display great
depth of knowledge and insight.

Wish: More participation by learners at all levels.  I want to see more.
Let's have contributions, more questions, more trials, and (inevitably)
more errors.

Let the errors fall where they may.  I will hope for corrections of my
own. That never feels particularly good, but so what!  The errors will
get straightened out, the ruffled feathers soothed.  Advice is not always
welcome, it may even at times be erroneous.  But questions, questions,
trials and errors make for interactions that transmute lead into gold.

Sometimes I feel we are in a desperate struggle for survival, but Yiddish
language and literature has a number of vigorous allies.  Sometimes that
feeling of struggle against great odds gives way to a glorious sense of
victory against all odds.  Listen to the fourth movement of Beethoven's
Fifth Symphony, or the coda of his Egmont overture, and you'll know what
I mean.  The more introductions, the better I feel.  Best of all, when
the new people participate.

[A fine way to end a forgettable year.  Best wishes to all from the
shames. nm]
