For Leonard Prager:

I am quite sure that I have a copy at home of Khaym Grade's
essay, "Mayn Krig mit Hersh Raseyner" in the original
Yiddish. If you give me your postal address, I'll make a
copy and send it to you.

Subject: bloyz

I would like to make a suggestion with regard to the use of
the word bloyz.

I believe it derives from the german word BLOSS ( usually
seen with the sharp s) which in the dictionary is
translated as only, just, merely, simply.

The example that was given: bloyz ikh bin foyl ouftsushteyn
in german would be: Ich bin bloss zu faul um aufzustehen or
in English it follows: I am just too lazy to get up.

Subject: many things

In reply to the query posedby a no. of people :  David Gold
prepared a guide to {the fifth ed. of UW's College Yiddish,
1971 It is entitled Yiddish 101; Elementary Yiddish I and
Yiddish 102; Elementary Yiddish II -- two brochures which
we re published by the Dept of Hebrew and Semitic Studies,
U. of Wisconsin-Madison in 1973 and 1976.  There is a
two-page Note to the Student appended to my copy of the
Yiddish 101 text -- David Gold's list of corrctions and
additions). Yiddish 101 is copyrighted by U of Wisc. and
YIVO, whereas Yiddish 102 is copyrighted only by the U of
Wisc.
 
 Another bibliographich matter in answer to my own query!
I dug into my files this weekend and found a brochure
publ. by the Heb Univ. Yidd. dept. in 1969 containing
Grade's marvelous Musernikes and his "Mayn krig mit hersh
rseyner".  The latter was originally published in Idisher
Kemfer 32:923 (1951).  I also ran across my notes in which
I mark the places the famous English translation just
skips over whole passages of the original!  I recommend
both the above works to all lovers of Yiddish literature.
