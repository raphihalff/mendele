Subject: Khas ve-sholem and similar wishful thinking

In Vol. 5.017 Harvey Spiro discusses this subject.   I have no expert
knowledge and can add only one minor reference:

*** Skipping most of Harvey's learned and interesting response ***

>I couldn't
>find a pertinent reference to kholile..

I  do not  have  Jastrow's  dictionary and  perhaps  the following  is
mentioned in it.  Anyhow kholile (or  halila as I would normally write it
in Hebrew)  can be found already in the  Torah in Breshit (Genesis) 18,14
with essentially  the same  meaning it  is used  these days  in Yiddish
and Hebrew.

It might amuse some readers to learn  how in the land of the Jews many
life insurance are (roughly) formulated  : If has vehalila the insured
person dies... etc.   I wonder if in goyishe medines  they are equally
"tactful" in their insurance policies...

Subject: Khapt/Shleyer song(s)?

Re "Khapt un Nemt", words kindly supplied by Milt Eisner.... It seems
that my mother perhaps combined two  songs in one. "Khapt...." doesn't
seem to have a line about the Bubbe's alte shleyer....  Comments?

Subject: Letters in Yiddish

I have access to a series of letters written [between 1910 and 1940] by
my great-grandfather who lived near Dvorick (sp) outside of Riga, Latvia.
These were written to his sons who had immigrated to the United States
and continued until 1940.  All contact was then lost.  All are in
Yiddish.  I would willing to loan these letters to anyone researching
that era in exchange for that person scanning the letters for family
history. I may be contacted via email or at 703-351-9816.  Thank you.

Subject: Need Yiddish publisher/typist

My father is the Yiddish poet and author David Wolpe.

He is attempting to publish some new Yiddish literature but because of
his age he is having difficulty typing and editing his work.

Is there anyone out on the net who knows of a publisher or person who
would be able to take on this task and assist him.

I would be grateful for any help in this matter.

Herbert Wolpe
