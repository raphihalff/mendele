Subject: esrog, fadists, et.al.

There may not be a Hindi word for persimmon  but there is an English word
for esrog. It is Citron. That would be the correct translation. Of course
the subtle emotional overtones which led to the choice of that fruit in
the context of the story require a feel for the culture. But is that all
so very different from reading James Baldwin or Ann Beatty in English.
(not to mention James Joyce!)  Surely it's time to climb down from the
Ivory Tower and try to communicate with us proste mentchen, fadists if you
insist.

I am in complete disagreement with Mechl Asheri when he dismisses the 
importance of translation--for translation is not just necessary, but a must.  
A Torah scholar like Asheri (or at least he seems so to me) ought to remember 
that all languages are acceptable in liturgical literature, halakhically 
speaking (with a few exceptions).  When one translates Sholem Aleykhem there 
is no treason involved, only the needed internationalization of worthwhile 
thought.

However, translation leaves a funny aftertaste in the mouth of the Yiddishist,
and it doesn't only have to do with snobbism.  Let me explain:

Let's compare the modern Spanish-language literature (to take the example of
Martha Krow-Lucal) with its Yiddish counterpart.  If you want to get involved 
in Spanish-language literature and you don't know enough Spanish, your 
ignorance of the language doesn't matter--you can read through the entirety of
Spanish-language literary history, past to present, with the help of expert
translations.  It's remarkable: you can read not just translations of the old
classics (Cervantes, Quevedo, Tirso de Molina), but also the modern "classics"
of Garcia Marquez and Vargas Llosa.  (This faithful representation through
translation of the millennial spread of a language's literature is so 
remarkable to those of us in the Yiddish literary community--see below for an
explanation--that I fear Dr. Krow-Luca takes it for granted and imagines that
the same automatically applies in the case of Yiddish.)  Translations from
Spanish, I've been told, are these days remarkably faithful, no matter what
school the translator belongs to.  Thus translation is a magician--one is
transformed through it into something Spanish.

Do what's the difference with translations from Yiddish?  Two differences 
bother me.  First, these translations into English are often unbearable. 
I don't mean here the unavoidable inexactitiudes and imperfections that any 
translation is subject to, but rather the apparently widespread notion among 
publishers that someone who knows Yiddish from home is perforce able to 
faithfully render a novel of Sholem Aleykhem.  "Not all translations are as 
good as they might be" is certainly true, but in regard to Yiddish it seems to 
me (with certain exceptions, of course) that many translators set themselves 
lower standards than those who work from other languages.  Therefore my first 
complaint: when one reads Yiddish literature in translation, and thinks that 
she's becoming (so to speak) "Yiddished," just as with other translated 
literatures she might be Russianed or Chinesed, she might be making an 
unfortunate mistake--the very essence of the literature is in many cases 
poorly transmitted.

The second difference has to do with modern literature in Yiddish.  It does
exist, but from the modern translations (not just the translations themelves,
but from what _gets_ translated at all) one might think, for example, that 
Isaac Bashevis Singer was the last Yiddish writer on the face of the earth.  
(And such was indeed written in the eulogies of many an English-language 
newspaper.) From translations of Spanish literature one gets the (true) 
impression that there is still a creative community in Spanish, that the 
writers from long ago continually influence those of today, that what one 
reads in (for example) Cervantes can help in the interpretaton of a difficult 
passage in Cela.  With Yiddish it's not the case, and I don't mean "it's 
not the case because there aren't living Yiddish-language authors," which 
I'm sure would be the first resopnse of many a Yiddish professor. From Yiddish 
translations, rather, one gets the (false) impression that Singer was the one 
and only postwar novelist of note, and that Sutskever (im tsu lengere un 
sheferishe yor) is the last postwar poet.  It's not true, but the readership 
of the present unrepresentative selection of translations from Yiddish doesn't 
know that.  The true continuity of Yiddish literature, which is present even 
today, is unfaithfully--not just unfaithfully, but irresponsibly--presented to 
the readership.

Once I thought that the situation would improve.  Now it seems, unfortunately,
that I was mistaken--Sholem Aleichem gets translated over and over, Singer 
also, Mendele too, Peretz.  The modern literature, on the other hand, is barely
touched.  I have nothing against a devoted lover of Yiddish culture as Martha
Krow-Lucal, who's probably better trained and better read than I am in our
literature, and probably better able to interpret what she has gleaned from 
that culture.  But one should ask: which Yiddish culture does she love, which 
Yiddish culture has she gleaned from her reading in translation?  An ostensibly 
dead thing, or the true culture, which strives with every fiber of its being, 
though it languishes in untranslated exile?
