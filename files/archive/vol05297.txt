Subject: Mumps

Despite stale seder table jokes, Modern Hebrew khazeret 'mumps' is not as in
horseradish -- their pointed spellings are different. The plant name goes back
to the mishna; the illness perhaps only to the 18th century. Khazeret 'mumps'
is constructed on a popular derivational pattern for illnesses -- its root is
taken from khazer...

Subject: Tkhine nokh kapores shlogn

Several thoughtful Mendelyaner have commented that "kapores shlogt men erev
yonkiper batog," having understood the introductory line I quote (note bene:
_quote_) as asserting that this ceremony is performed in the morning. The
author of "Tkhine nokh kapores shlogn" saw fit to write an introductory
sentence to guide her readers as to when to recite the prayer.  The title
alone indicates it is said _after_ the ceremony.  The question is when does
the ceremony of _shlogn kapores_ take place.  The sentence in question is
ambiguous: "Di tkhine zogt men erev yonkiper in der fri eyder men davent nokh
kapore shlogn." This seems to mean 1) 'me shlogt kapores erev yonkiper in der
fri', but it can also mean 2) one says the prayer in the morning of the day
before yonkiper ( = yonkiper Eve), the day following the ceremony of _kapores
shlogn_.  There is apparently no universal uniformity as regards the timing of
_kapore shlogn_.  At my hand I have Simkhe Pyetrushke's _Yidishe
folks-entsiklopedye_, where I read under _kapores_: " Mineg ba yidn tsu shlogn
kapores.  In der nakht far erev yonkiper oder a tog frier."  Note that
Pyetrushke says _night_.  But what is night in some places to some people is
perhaps just late afternoon elsewhere.  In any evert, _morning_ is wrong, so
we may have to just look at the author's syntax, since it is not conceivable
she didn't know "ven me shlogt kapores."

Subject: Etymon of _mayne loshn_

Peter Kluehs suggests a German etymon meaning 'bad' (cognate to English
_mean-) to explain why one of the transferred senses of Yiddish _mayne loshn_,
namely "expletive', is apparently exclusive to Yiddish, the Hebrew cognate
_maane lashon_ (as pronounced in Modern Hebrew) sharing all other meanings
with Yiddish except this one.  This fascinating explanation gives us a Yiddish
word which derives from two different etyma with similar sound, by no means
impossible.  Any more ideas?

Subject: Good news, bad news

The good news, dear friends, is that it's peysekh.  On behalf of the
Mendelyaner who've sent greetings and from me as well, a freylikh yontef aykh
ale.  And may you miraculously avoid the annual 15-pound weight gain from all
that gefrishte matse..

The bad news is that the Trinity machine is still in bad shape.  If anything,
it's slower.  As a result I have to announce emergency measures.

First, be assured that Mendele will _not_ be affected since it's edited
offline.

However, I won't be able to answer any of your letters.

If your post doesn't appear, the reason is likely to be one of these:

1. As you know, Mendele asks that all posts be signed and that they have a
_meaningful_ Subject: line (this is to help those who wish to search the
Contents file).  In the past I've sent boilerplate (recorded) messages to
those who momentarily forgot.  No longer.  I'll continue to hold the post for
a day or two.

2. A few posts arrive tacked on to an entire back issue of Mendele.  This is a
gross waste of resources, space, etc.  These messages are deleted unread.

3. The post has nothing to do with Yiddish.

4. The material has already appeared.

5. The post is a personal message to another reader and of no interest to the
list.

All of this bothers me a lot more than it may bother you and I hope it won't
last much longer.  One of the main pleasures of doing Mendele, after all, is
that of corresponding one-on-one with such rare friends.

Mendele resumes on April 7.
