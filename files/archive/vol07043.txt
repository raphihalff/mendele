Subject: Drimpln

With reference to Heynekh Sapoznik's question in Mendele Vol. 7.042,
Harkavy's Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary gives "drimblien" - meaning to
jingle or to scrape,  and the nouns "drimblie" - meaning drone or crembalum
(perhaps the "r" is a typo and should be deleted) and "drimbelke" - meaning
rebeck (a three-stringed precursor of the violin).  Harkavy is a great
resource, but often seems to need in addition an English dictionary to help
with obscure or archaic terms in the definitions.

Tsu Mendele hob ikh amol arayngetaynet azoyne gedanken: Az Mendele shikt mir
nisht keyn briv etlekhe teg ver ikh oys mentsh.  Ikh drey zikh arum on a kop.
 Ikh shray, Gevald!  Vu iz mayn Mendele "fix?"  Nu, hayntike teg bin ikh,
layder, gevoynt gevorn tsu lebn vokhn lang on a shum briv fun Mendele.  Nisht
azoy tut men in a Yidisher mishpokhe.

Haynt hob ikh bashlosn az ikh bin oykh a bisl shuldik un vel araynshikn briv
a bisl ofter.  Efsher vet dos helfn.  Un efsher nit.  Tsum bayshpil: Leybl
Botvinnik's yedies vegn "Radio Programs" zenen ongekumen tsu shpet.  Farvos
hobn di Mendele redaktors zikh farshpetikt mit aza vikhtiker meldung biz der
gants vert iz farshvunden gevorn?

I once directed such musings to Mendele:  If Mendele sends me no letter for a
few days, I feel adrift and bewildered.  I cry out, help!  Where is my
Mendele "fix?"  Well, these days, I am, unfortunately, used to living for
weeks without a single note from Mendele.  That's not how it's done in a
Jewish family.

Now I've realized that I too am somewhat guilty, and I will send letters a
bit more often.  Maybe that will help.  Maybe not.  For example: Leybl
Botvinnik's news about "Radio Programs" came through too late.  Why were the
Mendele editors so late with such an important announcement until all value
disappeared?

Subject: Ikh gleich

Having enrolled in Yiddish classes this past year, I have been getting a
large dosage of grammar which enables me to now  not  be embarrased to speak
Yiddish.  Like many people of my generation, my parents spoke Yiddish to the
grandparents or when they didn't want us to understand what was going on.
  One thing many of us remember is saying "Ikh gleich" for "I like."  In my
class, however, I learned that "Ikh gleich" is not really grammatically
acceptable and we should instead be saying "es gefelt mir" or other
appropriate substitutes.  "Ikh gleich" is supposedly an Americanism and a
true Yiddish speaker would not be using it.  Yet I have spoken with many
people who are sure that their  yiddish- speaking parents did indeed use
"gleich."  Could any of the mendeleyaners enlighten me on the status of "ikh
gleich?"

By the way, I have also have missed getting Mendele on a regular basis.   It
is truly a wonderful "fix."  I remember when I first joined and was
overwhelmed with the frequency of   postings.  And now  I can't get enough!

Subject: electronic  dictionary

Does anyone know where one can get an electronic  Yiddish to English
translator? (Assuming they exist). Would greatly appreciate knowing this
because it is obviously very tiring looking up words in the dictionary. 

Thanks,

Allevay one could also travel to Israel at then end of December-January for
the YIDDISH FESTIVAL which takes place in Jerusalem (for details write
neve-ilan@kibbutz.co.il)

But even in August one can find what's going on in Israel about Mame Loshn.
One shouldsurely visit Beit Sholem Aleykhem (a museum full of books,
portraits, minutiae of the life of our beloved classicist) which is located
in Yel Aviv. One can perhaps visit the Yiddish departments in the 5
universities. The publishing houses are surely open. Very likely there are
also some concerts. Perhaps Leybl Botvinik can write for us what is going
on at the moment. And I call on representative of other Yidish
organizations in Israel, let them make the effort to regularly give out
such news.

I believe that the subject "Yiddish in Israel" is a subject for all of
"Israel."

Yiddish may have been born in exile, but even Yiddish is "coming home."
It's time to say kaddish over the false notion that there is no Yiddish in
the state of Israel.

Subject: Celia Zylbercweig 

Celia Zylbercweig, who passed away earlier this month in Los Angeles, was
long a mainstay of the Yiddish theater. As a student in Poland before the
war, she performed in Goldfaden plays, often in the lead roles because of
her fine soprano voice. She studied drama and voice at the Warsaw
Conservatory, then in Germany as well. She toured with Yiddish
theater companies throughout North and South America. In 1948, she settled
in Los Angeles, along with her husband Zalmen Zilbercweig, the historian
of the Yiddish theater and editor of the 6-volume "Leksikon fun yidishn
teater." For twenty years,the Zilbercweigs had their own daily Yiddish
radio program in Los Angeles. Ms. Zilbercweig also continued to perform in
Yiddish at the Wilshire Ebell Theater, and lectured for many years
throughout the LA area. Koved ir ondenk.

Those interested in sending condolences to her family may contact me
directly.
