Subject: Zschokke, kapores, and "sealed communities"

Joachim Neugroschel's comments [6.129,4] on "A vayse kapore" heroine's
(poor woman! it all started from an innocent liubistok) choice of German
reading versus Russian, Yiddish, or Hebrew raise another interesting
question: in which language she read Goethe, Schiller, and, yes,
Zschokke?

All three authors were readily available at that time in translation to
all three above-mentioned languages, e.g. (I am omitting examples of
Russian translations):

Goethe

Neveh ha-tsedek, maskil shir yedidot (Varsha, J.Lebensohn, 1857; tr. in
Hebrew by Marcus Rothberg), Verters leyden (Vilna, 1910, tr. in Yiddish
by Solomon Yudson).

Schiller

Di Royber (Varsha, F.Kantarovich, 1912, tr. in Yiddish by David Kassel),
Kesher Fiyesko be-Genoa (Drogobych: A.H.Zupnik, 1888; tr. in Hebrew by
Samuel Abely Apfel), Shelihut Mosheh (Lemberg: K.Bodvayzer, 1878, tr. in
Hebrew by Meier Stockmann), Miryam Styuart, malkat Shottland (Vilna,
1879; tr. in Hebrew by Solomon Kovner), Vilhelm Tell (Vilna: Romm, 1882;
tr. in Hebrew by David Radner).

Zschokke

Lel shimurim (Varsha: Sh.A.Peshes, 1883; tr. in Hebrew by Mordecai Aaron
Ginzburg), Har-Zalmon (Vilna: L.L.Matz, 1878; tr. in Hebrew by Isidor
Margolis).

By the way, this list can be added to the Michael Steinlauf's argument
[6.128,1] about the hermetically sealed Jewish communities (and here we
are talking about 19th century!).

As to Zschokke, he does not seem to fit a profile of a regular
supermarket novelist. Being an author of "Abaellino, the great bandit",
he was also a poet, historian, and theologian, whose selected prose and
poetry in 17 volumes was published 11 times between 1830 and 1880 (plus
countless single editions). A separate ten-volume set of "Stunden der
Andacht" with titles like "Gott in der heiligen Schrift", "Gott in der
Natur", "Gott in leben der Volker", "Gott in der Familie", "Christliche
liebe", etc. was apparently quite popular as well (judging by a number
of editions in different languages, including Russian). And I don't know
what was closer associated with Zschokke's name among Sholem Aleichem's
contemporaries: Abaellino or Jesus?

Subject: Aron Tsaytlin ("Zeitlin") and _his_ father

In Michael Steinlauf's note about the distance from the tradition of
some of Perets's readers, (and of our own post Holocaust secular world
all the more so), he mentions that Bashevis could always go to a remote
settlememnt to dip into the old ways.

It's an interesting coincidence that Bashevis came to mind. His good
friend and _lantsman_ (and cosurvivor) Aron Tsaytlin wrote ruefully in
the 1920's (if memory serves) in Warsaw of his own ignorance of the
tradition in comparison to the knowledge of his father Hillel Tsaytlin.

I've often thought in response that I would gladly settle for what the
younger Tsaytlin had managed to absorb in his day in Warsaw.  I've also
wondered if Tsaytlin wasn't recording a feature of judeo-filial
psychology as well.  There is a kh'sidic story about how the first
generation after the BESHT forgot the words he sang when he lit a fire
in the forest, and the next generation forgot the melody, the next
generation forgot how to light the fire, and the next generation did not
know the place in the forest, and our generation is left with
remembering the story, and that has to be enough.

Meyle--but I find this a limited consolation).

Subject: Tautologies

I have compiled a short list of Yiddish tautologies and would be
interested in hearing from other Mendelenikes on this subject. The
classic tautology is, of course, "gut yomtov", but minhog oyker din,
even the laws of syntax, and centuries of usage have made it acceptable.
Others, as often as not jocose, are "gute besures toives", "mayim
akhroynim vasser", "a por vert divrey toyre", "katori vos" (or even
"katori vos velkher") and "tomer efsher". Friend of mine once told me
about a particularly unctuous rabbi who insisted on giving a sermon
every Shabbes. He would start by addressing the suffering members of the
congregation: "Raboysay, ladies and gentlemen".

Other examples will be gratefully reveived and acknowledged. I should
add that narsty ethnic slights like, "Litvak tselemkop", Yekke Potz",
"Rumener gonef" etc. while they are considered tautologies by some are
not by me, probably because I would have to include "Poileshe dripke"
which is too close for comfort.
