Subject: Introduction

I am a computer program at NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, in Silver Spring, MD.  I heard Yiddish as a child and
studied it for 3 years at the University of Maryland.  I am a member of
Yiddish of Greater Washington.  Enjoy reading the Forvetz (especially
Miriam Hoffman's articles) and the Forward (Philologus).

Subject: me tut fregn...

the question was about the origin of the use of 'ton' with the main verb.
i don't know if this is used in slavic languages, but it is common in
german dialects (south- und southwestern germany, austria, switzerland i
think also). Ex.: "Was tuste?" - "ich tu lesen." or "lesen tu ich".

i thought that in yiddish the corresponding idiom was to duplicate the
main verb? ie., "vos tut er?" - "singen singt er."

is this correct usage? if not i would love to be put on the right track.

Subject: Miami Beach Fiction

One of my students is working on a documentary film about the migration
of retired Jews from the New York area to Miami Beach in the 1950's and
60's. She is particularly interested in what one of the participants
described as a "Yiddische Gan Aiydn," which is to say the re-creation of
a sense of Yiddish cultural life in the warm climate of Florida. She is
interested in fictional treatments of Miami in the period 1950's to the
present. She is aware of Bashevis Singer's story A PARTY IN MIAMI.

Subject: "dona" and "a groyser goy"

Two questions:

1.  Does anyone know what "dona" means in the song "dona dona"? Doea
anyone know if the song was originally written in Yiddish, and/or what
text might be a good source for such info.?

2.  I heard a native Yiddish speaker say, in a "complementary" way to the
parents of my cousin at his Bar-Mitzvah "az er zol zayn a groyser
goy"....I'm almost positive that's what she said...anyone know what that
means?
