for mendelehn: in case some missed the recent letter in the
NYT, it may amuse y ou to see what a rabbi from (pace James
Joyce! Phoenixville) writes about the U S national bird (if
I can upload it): It May Help Be Jewish to Love Turkey

To the Editor (NYT) 12/14/92):
May I add another linguistic note to the colorful "One
Strange Bird" by Margaret Visser (Op-Ed Nov 26)? The
concurrence of the voyages of Columbus and the expulsion
from Spain of its J ewish population after cneturies of
mutually advantageous co-existence has been widely aired
in t his 500th year of commemoration of both events. One
of the key personnel making the first voyage was Luis de
Torres, employed by Columbus as interpreter since he had
wide knowledge of Chaldean and Arabic, the languages of
the areas they expected to reach. A "Converso," one fo the
Jew who had converted to Catholicism under the pressure of
the Inquisition but remained a secret adherent of his own
faith, de Torres al so knew Hebrew well. It was natural
that de Torres was in the first boats sent to shore on
October 12 , 1492. In a letter written to a friend in
Spain, he described the strange bird seen in this new lan
d. As Ms. Visser notes, during the courting season the
bird gobbles, struts and puf fs, and his tail feathers
display in the manner of a peacock. De Torres gave it the
name that app ears in the biblical book of I Kings, 10:22,
the Hebrew word for peacock: tuki. Surely a much more di
rect line to "turkey" than the various other speculations
at hand.  Rabbi Harold M Kamsler

Subject: Concerning "a sheynem dank"

The simple answer is that Yiddish has merged the dative and
accusative, in the case of the masculine, in favor of the
historically dative form in all of Eastern Yiddish and, in
the feminine in favor of the accusative in most or all of
Central Yiddish and in parts of Northeastern Yiddish as
well.

Subject: Philosophers, Fiddlers and Fools

For those within reach of KCRW-FM, 89.9 FM in Santa Monica,
California:

Don't miss "Philosophers, Fiddlers and Fools," the 13th
annual Chanukah celebration hosted by Ruth Hirschman, to be
aired this year from Noon to 3:00 on Monday, December 21.
Hirschman writes,

    Yiddish is a language that has outwitted history.  It
    is as miraculous as the flames that burned through the
    eight days and nights of the first Chanukah.

    For the past 13 years I have hosted and produced a
    three-hour program that is an open love affar with
    Yiddish, the language of my childhood.  It is always a
    very personal and emotional experience. By now, my
    trusted Board Operator, Mitchell Harding, has mastered
    the strange phonetics.  These days we even have latkes
    with apple sauce and sour cream for the staff.  And
    every year, I play a mix of favorites and new songs
    that inexplicably present themselves just before
    broadcast.

    The audience includes seniors in retirement homes,
    young mothers trying to pass on some of the magic to
    their children, the sons and daughters of that
    extraordinary generation that spoke Yiddish everyday,
    and a rainbow mix of listeners for whom this program is
    an evocation of their own culture.  Over the years they
    have become regulars.  This year I hope you will join
    them.


KCRW is carried by several cable systems; email me for a
list if you are interested.

Subject: segol

to: Meykhl Herzog (bad pun, zey mir meykhl!)

the besorah question confused me, because we have gevure
(might) on one hand, but Devoyre (as in Dorothy Billik,
whom I met in Boston along with others from the Mende-list,
perhaps at AJS next year we should have a session devoted
to mendele), or Sechoyre (trade, merchandise) on the other.

My real questions are about your recent note on the segol,
and its relatives (124#2). Is "ay", as in Central Yiddish
"A yiddisher maylekh" a tsere, or a diphthong? If the
latter, then Eastern Hungarians are a special category,
because they pronounced these segolates with a tsere, as in
me'lekh, ke'ver, or (pardon me for using a pejorative
!?!?!?!? term) she'gets. This led to the Hungarian/Yiddish
pun in: "Ke'rem is a weingarten". (Ke'rem in Hung. means
*please*=*bitte*) A second question: does it make a
difference that the first group (Elul, emes) has a short,
unaccented vowel?

Both of these are accusative, I think: Adjectives modifying
masculine nouns don't distinguish dative/accusative. The
ending is -em for adjectives ending in "n", and for "nay";
for other adjectives it's -n.

"Ikh hob gezen dem sheynem, hoykhn binyan." -- accusative.
"far undzer nayem, frayen dor" -- dative (< "Shtil, di
nakht")

-- Khaim
