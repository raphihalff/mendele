Subject: The Origins of Yiddish

An interesting and provocative article by the NY Times science editor
George Johnson "Scholars Debate Origins of Yiddish and the Migrations of
Jews" was published today in New York Times (pp.B5 and B10 or
http://www.nytimes.com/). The later version misses the map, that
accompanies printed edition, having instead hyperlinks to the Spoken
Yiddish Language Project Web site at the Columbia University and to the
Virtual Shtetl. Due to the link, Shtetl enjoyed a huge influx of new
visitors (in normal days Shtetl has average of 450 hits, today - 2,200
by 5 p.m.). It shows that NYT is still a popular newspaper, despite some
sluggishness: in this particular case "the news that's fit to print"
appeared in Mendele more than a year ago ("Origins of Yiddish" thread in
Vols. 5.062, 5.065, and others).

consider the consequences); 'klern' iz nit geven a teglekher vort -- men
flegt mer nitzn 'derkler' (tz.b. derkler mir vos du meynst -- explain to

Subject: Premature burial for Yiddish?  Why?

Let me try to connect a few dots from past contributions to Mendele on
this topic in hopes of clarifying parts of this fuzzy picture.

Life and generational continuity are supreme Jewish values and so most
of us find it impossible to remain indifferent to assaults against and
discouragement of continued life for Yiddish, and, by extension,
potential interference with enjoyment and transmission of Yiddish
cultural treasures. Hershl Hartman asked (6.058, 5) "Can any mental
health worker out there explain the apparently urgently felt need to
bury Yiddish? (Ruth Wisse, perhaps?)". Did he imply that this
_apparently urgently felt need_ is pathological? I am not a mental
health worker, but I would say it is more than possible.

Leybl Botvinik brought to us (6.014, 1) a particulary spooky quotation
from a 1986 article in which Ruth Wisse is purported to have said, "I am
certainly not one who mourns the decline of Yiddish in America..." and
further, "It's a crime to be sentimental [about the decline of
Yiddish]."

It is true that sentimentality can interfere with judgment and so
mislead. But it is also true that sentiment is also feeling, passion,
and can work to hold one firmly to a good, creative path, in spite of
great difficulty. To suggest criminalizing (even metaphorically) a
passionate attachment to a Jewish language and culture is nothing short
of bizarre.

I think some people are frightened about feeling strongly about
_anything_. That is a kind of self suffocation driven sometimes by a
wish to fit into a social and political environment perceived as
threatening, hostile to one's natural feelings.

Leah Zazulyer last June suggested (6.017,2) a political subtext for this
general phenomenon. She referred to the association of Yiddish with the
left, the Bund, etc. which frightens the orthodox. I would add the
secular dimension as an aspect of Yiddish that repels them.

I also believe that association of Yiddish with the left drives some
self haters to recoil from Yiddish as a way to hide from and/or appease
the right wing whose ominous stock in trade is scapegoating. [e.g.,
Don't hate us, Pat Buchanan! We are just like you. Ain't nobody here but
us right wingers.] I think Leah Zazulyer raised a core issue when she
said: "I fear that we have learned nothing in the 20th century if self
hate is fueling statements on the death of Yiddish, and the insistence
on that death!"

A quotation from Modern Yiddish Culture, by Emanuel S. Goldsmith. New
York: Shapolsky Publishers, 1987, p. 68 is rather apt:

      In Germany, Richard Loewe, a Germanics scholar, published an
      important article in a German Jewish journal in 1904 in which he
      analyzed the hostility toward Yiddish of his fellow German Jews.
      In it he wrote: The antipathy of the Christian European
      environment to the Jews evoked anti-Semitism on the part of the
      Jews themselves and the detestation which this environment
      cultivated towards the language of the Jews also became part of
      the Jews.  It is noteworthy that even in the circles where Jewish
      identity has been reawakened, this hatred toward the Jargon (as
      the East European Jew himself refers to the language) continues.

I am encouraged, however, by the passion for Yiddish evinced by the
young and not so young among Mendelyaners.

[Passion? Gevalt! Call the sentimentality police!]

emes bay der bord") has appeared in the most recent issue of _Afn
Shvel_.  If we could say "required reading" we would. nm]
