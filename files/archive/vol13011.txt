Alexander Belousov, a prominent Yiddish poet and essayist, passed away on
January 27, 2004 at his home in Maale Adumim in Israel.

An ethnic Russian with no Jewish background whatsoever, Alexander Belousov
was born in 1948 in Kuibyshev (Samara). In his early teens, he developed a
keen interest in Judaism, Hebrew, and Yiddish, a very unusual avocation for
a Soviet child in the Russian heartland in the 1960s.

The Rabbi of the local synagogue introduced young Alexander to one of the
congregants, who volunteered to teach him Hebrew. Belousov started visiting
the man on a daily basis and learned Yiddish at his home.

He was inspired to write poetry in Yiddish by Shmuel Halkin's book of
verse, "Mayn Oytser". He showed his poetry to Nekhama Lifshitz when she was
visiting Samara on a concert tour, and word about the young Russian man
writing in Yiddish spread quickly in Yiddish circles.

While Belousov was a student at the Kuibyshev Pedagogical Institute, his
Yiddish poetry was first published in Sovetish Heymland in 1969. His poetry
was Jewish not only in language but also in spirit: with a remarkable
sincerity, he expressed deep sorrow for the world of Jewish shtetls that is
no more, for the victims of the Holocaust whom he calls his brothers and
sisters, for the "dreams of the far-off days of yore". His work was
recognized and highly acclaimed by many poets and critics in the Soviet
Union and abroad. His poetry was translated into Russian, English, and
Hebrew.

In the late 1980s, Belousov was one of the founders of the Society for
Jewish Culture in Samara. He moved to Israel in 1990, where he taught
Hebrew to immigrants and worked for the Yiddish and Russian press. He
received the Dovid Hofshteyn literary prize for his Yiddish poetry. Until
the end, Belousov remained optimistic about the future of Yiddish culture;
he believed in its inherent ability to survive.

In one of his poems, Belousov writes about the Yiddish speakers who
perished in the cataclysms of the 20th century: "And they want to scream -
they no longer have a voice!" Alexander Belousov dedicated his life to
giving them voice.

Subject: Glatshteyn in English

Glatshteyn's novel Ven Yash is Gekumen was translated into English as
Homecoming at Twilight by Norbert Guterman (1962, Thomas Yoseloff).  His
other novel, Ven Yash is Geforen, was translated into English by Abraham
Goldstein under the title Homeward Bound (l969, Thomas Yoseloff).

Although these are out of print, they might be available through Judaica
booksellers or libraries.  Hope this helps.

Subject: Glikl Haml's language

Last summer I made a project of reading Glikl's Zikhroynes in the original.
I bought a nice copy that had belonged to a rabbi in Baden.  Anyway, I
found it rough going, because there were so many pure loshn-koydesh
passages, which I can't read.  I also couldn't help noticing, though, that
the Germanic component seemed, on the surface, to be very New High German,
but I don't feel qualified to make that a firm conclusion.  Can anyone
recommend a good book or article(s) that would explain/explore this?  I'd
of course be interested in the opinions of any Mendelyaner who have
knowledge they'd care to share.

I have read some of the literature in/on Southwestern Yiddish of the 20th
century (I assume Glikl would have spoken Northwestern Yiddish).  The SWY
dialect of Endingen and Lengnau seems definitely to be Yiddish in the ense
that most Mendelyaner would understand.  It has a lot of correspondences
with the klal-shprakh, and not just in the Semitic component, i.e. you
don't feel like you're just reading a German dialect with Hebrew words
mixed in. Things in Glikl's language which did look "Yiddish" were "Mir
zenen" "un" and "aakh" (oykh), among others.  Robert Rosen, who wrote the
1977 introduction to the Schocken English edition, on the other hand,
refers to the language as "Judeo-German" and gives a list of Romance words
"used by Glueckel and typical of the German of her century".  He also says
that the original 1896 edition by Kaufmann has "footnotes rendering some of
Glueckel's words, which betray the Hamburg dialect, into modern German ..."
Was the 17th century Yiddish of Hamburg really in such a dynamic
relationship with NHG? What bugs me about Rosen's statement is that my
(Gentile) family is from that area, and we were always told that our
ancestors had spoken Low German.

Any comments or help?

Subject: Jonathan Fast-Sholem Aleichem

First, I would like to introduce myself.  I work at the National Yiddish
Book Center and am just starting to learn Yiddish and explore Yiddish
literature.

Second, I have a question I'd like to put out there.  I recently heard a
rumor that author Jonathan Fast (son of Howard Fast and former husband of
Erica Jong) was related to Sholem Aleichem.  Is there a Sholem Aleichem
scholar who can give me an idea whether there might be a shred of truth to
this rumor?

Any information would be very helpful!  If you think your answer to this
question is not of general interest, please feel free to email me directly
at arubinstein@bikher.org.

A dank,

Aaron Rubinstein
