Subject: Re: Dzigan and Shumacher

Perhaps more than was asked for, but here's something from the forthcoming
YIVO Encyclopedia of Jewish Life in Eastern Europe. As you can see, they were
not quite Abbott and Costello. The author is Natan Gross.

Their performances typically opened with skits culled from the daily
newspapers, aimed at antisemites and government functionaries, but also at
themselves and their public. Routines based on domestic life would follow.
Dzigan's persona was that of a hyperactive and sloppy "happy beggar,"
endlessly complaining about his life as he darts about the stage with his
signature red handkerchief hanging from his neck. The bespectacled Shumacher,
in fundamental contrast, was phlegmatic and restrained, glossing his Jewish
troubles with subtle gestures of the shoulders and hands. Melekh Ravitsh spoke
of them as incarnating the eternal spirit of Polish Jews via the decidedly
unliterary medium of Lodz Yiddish. He also described them as two Don Quixotes
sitting on a park bench (perhaps each hoping for a Sancho Panza in the other),
one dreaming of Palestine and the other of Birobidzhan. Their routines were
written by writers such as Broderzon, Moyshe Nadir and Itsik Manger; they also
adapted older material from Sholem Aleichem and others.

Subject: Re: Dzigan & Szumacher

I knew both of them personally since 1950 and also played with Dzigan in
Buenos Aires in 1972 in one of his revues. Szumacher was the impatient and
nervous one and Dzigan was definitely der tam, but  not always did he play
the tam; he had many roles that covered the highest level in acting.

I believe I have all of the recordings that were made by Dzigan & Szumacher
and the ones made later by Dzigan alone after Szumacher died. I don't believe
that the Abbott & Costello analogy is accurate. Dzigan was the tummler and
Szumacher was more laid back. Dzigan usually initiated the exchanges pulling
Szumacher along.

I am a great fan of this wonderful duo (Dzigan's solo stuff was only a weak
continuation of their style). The first time I heard one of their recordings,
I was in a "mixed" group (galitsianer and litvaks); the  galitsianer were
rolling on the floor with laughter and litvaks couild hardly understand a
word!

Subject: Re: Dzigan and Szumakher

Comparing Dzigan and Szumakher to Abbott and Costello does the yiddish duo a
disservice.  Their humour was far more sophisticated and diverse. Political,
economic,social and other issues were covered by Dzigan and Szumakher in an
intelligent manner.  Their roles are not as readily defined as the Americans.
In the dialogues Dzigan does not play the simpleton that Costello excelled in.
His character is often a clever experienced adult, unlike the childlike
endearing moron that Costello played.

Subject: New website: Yiddish for historians

I would like to let you know i have put a website online entitled "Yiddish
sources in historical research". It can be found at:
http://www.iue.it/Personal/Researchers/Zaagsma/Yiddish/

The idea of the site is to provide people who wish to use Yiddish sources in
historical research with links to materials, institutions etcetera and it grew
out of my own collection of links and it seemed a good thing to turn them into
a site. The site is very much a work in progress and this is the first basic
version, i will be adding more things over time. I would like to invite
everybody to take a look and send me any comments, criticisms or suggestions
you might have.

Subject: Yechiel-Michl Guzikow

Around 1940, a Soviet author penned a Yiddish novel based on the biography of
Yechiel-Michl Guzikow, a 19th Century klezmer virtuoso on the xylophone. Does
anyone know the name of this author? Or the title in Yiddish? Please help!
