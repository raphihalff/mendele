Subject: bet hemder

In the context of the given text it seems clear that bet hemder is Yiddish
and not Hebrew. In Yiddish it simply means bed linens, and obviously not
house of delight [see 6.213].

Subject: bet hemder

Isn't "bet hemder" night clothes, i. e. "hemder vos men trogn in bet",
that is, "nakht hemder" in modern Yiddish?

Subject: bet hemder

Now that  Joy Kingsolver asks in  6.218 about the corrected  term "bet
hemder" and with the example given, it  is IMO clearly the plural of a
"hemd" worn in the "bet", i.e. a gown worn, mainly by women, in bed.

Subject: bet hemder

In reply to Joy Kingsover's two queries [6211:1 & 6218:4] concerning the
expression 'bet hemder' which occurs on p. 36 of the Kaufmann edition of
"Die Memoiren der Glueckel von Hameln" (Frankfurt am Main, 1896), I
would say that seen in context there can be very little doubt but that
the meaning is 'night shirts' or 'night gowns' and this is indeed how it
is rendered in the excellent Bertha Pappenheim translation (Vienna,
1910, p. 34): 'Die Betthemden'. The '-er' ending was and is the normal
Yiddish plural.

What is more curious is the misleading note offered by Kaufmann: 'die
Anzahl'. Clearly, he later thought better of this and under the
'Berichtigungen und Ergaenzungen' on p. lxxi corrects this to
'Bett-Hemden'. But why did he write 'die Anzahl' in the first place? It
is my belief that he intended to allude to the anomalous use of the
neuter singular articles and relative qualifying the expression in
question. In other words he meant to say that Glikl had used 'doz'
rather than 'di'' because she was thinking of a singular quantity or set
of night shirts. Recognising that some might interpret his cryptic note
as a translation, he subsequently opted on reflection for the rather
obvious, but at least unambiguous 'Bett-hemden'. In fact, Glikl's use of
the singular is not so egregious. I am no expert on Yiddish syntax of
this period, but there are certainly parallels in Middle High German.

By the way, may I just add that I hope that by now no one who lacks the
patience to persevere with the beautiful Kaufmann makes do with the
inadequate Lowenthal translation (itself not based on the original, but
on Feilchenfeld's travesty), when one can choose between the faithful
renderings of Beth Zion Abrahams's English (London, 1962/ New York,
1963) and Bertha Pappenheim's German translations. There is, of course,
also the Bernfeld and Rozhanski Modern Yiddish version (Buenos Aires,
1967).

Subject: Shul memories

I would like to invite all mendeleniks to search their memories of shul
experiences that featured yiddish apikorsishe mistranslations of certain
siddur phrases.  The only example that comes to mind at the moment is:

bli rayshis bli tachlis : es fangt zich nit ayn un es lost zich nit oys.

I know that there are many others.  Please contribute.

Subject: Avrom Reisin's "Zog, maran"

I have two questions about A. Reisin's "Zog, maran":  1) Does anyone
know when he  wrote the poem/song, or when it was first published?  2)
What might be the sources of his knowledge of the existence of a Marrano
tradition?  Was there any Ashkenazic folk tradition containing stories
of the Iberian crypto-Jews?  Is it more likely that Reisin was
acquainted with high-culture nineteenth-century German histories of the
Jews (like that of Graetz, for example) that might have furnished the
inspiration?

I realize that possible answers must be highly speculative, but if
anyone could give it a try, it would be most helpful.

A sheynem dank aykh.

Subject: Jewish Labor Committee materials

I am posting two exerpts from Arieh Lebowitz's article on the JLC.  The
archives of the JLC reside at the Wagner Labor Archive at New York
University.  Many of the documents are in Yiddish.  Recently, work was
done on the Vladeck papers by Dan Bender, graduate of the YIVO Yiddish
summer program.

For an email of the complete article please contact Arieh at:

                         The Jewish Labor Committee
                  A History, and Resources for Researchers
                              by Arieh Lebowitz

     The Jewish Labor Committee (JLC) was founded in February 1934 on
     New York's Lower East Side by leaders of the International Ladies'
     Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU), the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of
     America, the Workmen's  Circle, the Jewish Daily Forward
     Association, the Jewish Socialist Verband and other kindred groups
     in response to the rise of Nazism in Germany.  Before and during
     America's entry into World War II, the JLC raised emergency funds
     for partisan forces, rescued over a thousand political and cultural
     leaders -- Jews and non-Jews -- and organized an American
     coordinating committee of leaders in exile of European trade -
     union and social - democratic movements....

     The JLC collection at the Wagner Labor Archives, New York
     University In early 1985, the non-current records of the JLC were
     transferred to the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York
     University in New York City. This vast collection, comprising some
     800 boxes of material  covering the period 1934-1980, includes
     manuscript and printed documents in English, Yiddish, Polish and
     other languages, as well as photographs, scrapbooks, posters, and
     films.  Here researchers can find the whole story of the JLC, from
     its earliest struggles against the rise of Nazism to its post-war
     activities in the fields of civil rights, labor justice, and human
     dignity everywhere.

Subject: "Yosl, Yosl"

I am looking for the words to the song "Yosl, Yosl".  I have exhausted
every possible songbook that I have at my disposal and was only able to
find the refrain in a Russian anthology of Yiddish songs.  I was hoping
that someone could post the words to the entire song.

Subject: Need words for "Ikh Benk Aheym"

Our band is planning to perform the song "Ikh Benk Aheym" by Rumshinsky
on our upcoming Klezmer concert at the Vancouver Jewish Community
Centre.

We came across this song through a recommendation we got from a Mendele
participant.  We then heard the song on Bruce Adler's superb recording
with Zalmen Mlotek.

Now all we need are the words (...and the music).  Can anyone help? In
the worst case scenario we will extract the words and score from the
recording.  But we sure would appreciate if anyone has them handy. In
return, we promise to send you a recording from the concert. Please
help!
