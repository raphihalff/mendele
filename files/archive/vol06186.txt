Subject: Serdatsky's "Lilien"

I am translating Yente Serdatsky's "A simkhe" for the journal _Yiddish_.

The story was first published in the _Forverts_ in May, 1912.  At one
point, a woman is sitting in a dark room with a shaft of moonlight
streaking her hair and the author writes, "un zi hot oysgezehn vi
Lilien's kenigin der nakht" ("and she looked like Lilien's Queen of the
Night"; all spelling reflects the original orthography, including the
unnecessary possessive apostrophe).

Does anyone know who Lilien is?  I am inclined to believe that it is the
name of a prominent opera or stage singer of the period (or earlier) who
performed in _The Magic Flute_, or perhaps a fine artist who created
such an image.  Any ideas or alternative suggestions would be welcome.
Because of the poor quality of the text, it is possible that the final
nun is a giml, but "Lilyeg" does not seem likely as a proper name.  Any
help would be appreciated.

Subject: Kheshbon and *!@%

Joachim Neugroschel writes [6.182] that according to Weinreich kheshbon
is pronounced kheshbm.

Is this so? As far as I am aware it is kheshbn.

About the plural for the posterior [6.182, 6.183], writing hesitantly
while wriggling on mine, I think it is tukhesn, which would refer to two
pairs of them rather than a single pair. Anatomists may be interested
that in certain circles it is now refered to as a tush or a tushi.

Genig on this. I'm already feeling like Homon after waste was emptied on
him by his daughter.

Subject: A ganev

I seem to have a problem that mail goes missing from my post box. From
time to time I find volume numbers missing and must resort to the
comradeship that exists here to get others to fill me in.

Do other mendelistn have the same problem? Does it have anything to do
with Compuserve? Or is it a shed leshites reb Zeylig Bach [6.078] and a
dibek leshites reb Eliyuhi Juni [6.080]?

If my address adds up to minyen, as Pleter Kluehs suggests [6.131], ken
gor zan az a khelbene hot zikh bay mir arangekhapt in er ganvet tsi di
sforim.
