Subject: Introduction

I teach (among other things) Jewish Studies at Cornell.  I have
taught Yiddish and Yiddish culture here and have had as my focus
19th and early 20th century Jewish cultural studies.

Subject: Introduction

My interest in Yiddish is real but uninstructed. Please allow me to
be a "lurker" - a passive kibitzer. I teach Latin and Greek. I have
some German and Hebrew. I remember going to the store and buying
"Der Tog" for my father. He claimed it was superior to the other
Yiddish newspapers. Was it?

Subject: Re: yamike

Bob Goldberg asked about the pronunciation  /yamike/. For what it's
worth, here in Chicago, when I was a kid, ages ago, the 'standard'
-English- pronunciation was /yamilke/ (stress on 1st syllable; final
syllable varying between the /e/ of English 'get' and the
traditional Anglo-Litvak /ij/, e.g., as in 'party,' or 'holly' (not
the wreath, but the bread),although it seems to me that a
pronunciation with out the /l/, i.e., /yamike/ was also possible. In
any event, the /r/ was never pronounced.

Subject: Re: Yehupets

Dovid Braun suggests that  "Yehupets is, ... purely oysgetrakht....
I don't know whether Yehupets was a creation of Sholem-Aleykhem, but
it's used idiomatically to mean 'some far off place', 'some random
geographical location' (like Podunk).

I must respectfully disagree. Yehupets is, I am certain, a
Yiddishization of the Ukrainian Yehypet "Egypt," i.e., Mitsroyim.
The final /ts/ may be due to the Ukr. adjective, yehypet'skyj. Why
Yeh/u/pets and not Yeh/i/pets. Two possibilities come to mind: (a.)
a deliberate hypercorrectism, similar to "Lutwak" for "Litwak," or
(b.) a possible Ukrainian variant, since historically /h/ (/g/)
didn't occur before /i/> /y/. Since the reference is to (Biblical)
Egypt, Yehupets doesn't mean some far off place, "Podunk," but the
major cultural center of the local universe, i.e., for
Sholem-Aleykhem a metropolis such as Kiev.
