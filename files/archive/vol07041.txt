Subject: Joseph Green's movies

I have watched a few films made in Poland, around 1938, by Joseph
Greene.  Do you know where I could get more information about the
filmmaking of Joseph Greene, and what as well as how many films were
made.   Most notable among the films was: Tevye the Milkman and the
Dybbuk.  thanks

Yes, I have seen the Forverts childrens' corner with its nicely illustrated
children stories.  I am sure that children will not be the only ones reading
it.

...But did you see the letter from the managment?  Along with the first
childrens' corner, they printed a notice (really a warning) that if it
becomes useful, if mother and fathers or grandplarents are reading the
material to their children, they should write letters to the Forverts letting
the Forverts know.  If they do not receive such letters, the Forverts will be
obliged to terminate the childrens' corner column.

Ayer,
Ruvn Millman

Subject: az me lebt...

I'd like to challenge undzere khosheve mendelyaner to come up with a
sharp, elegant English version of "az me lebt, derlebt men." Ha-Shem
knows, I've tried. It's for a translation I'm working on; if I wind up
using your suggestion, I promise to put your name in a note.

A sheynem dank foroys

Subject: Fraytik oyf der nakht

Regarding Gerald Behling's inquiry [7.040] concerning the song "Fraytik oyf
der nakht iz ayeder yid a meylekh" there are many words (too many to print
here) - that can be found in our new book "Songs of Generations - New Pearls
of Yiddish Song"  - which can be purchased at the Workmen's Circle Book Store,
at 45 East 33 St., NYC (212-889-6800).  We wish to remind the  readers again
that some of these songs in our book originally appeared in our Yiddish column
"Perl fun der yidisher poezye" (Pearls of Yiddish Poetry) that is published
biweekly in the Yiddish Forward.  I know that many of you are subscribers
already,  others may be interested in knowing that we print poetry, songs,
letters that readers send us about songs they remember, and they can subscribe
very easily, by writing to the Jewish Forward, 45 East 33 St., New York, N.Y.
l00l9, or by calling 212-889-8200.
As for the song requested, we will print the refrain of the song here, just
to whet your appetite for more:
Oy, fraytik oyf der nakht
Iz ayeder yid a meylekh,
In yedn vinkele lakht,
Di gantse shtub iz freylekh.

Subject: Song in Yiddish

Gerald Behling asks in Mendele 7.040 about a shabes song. It is called
FRAYTIK AF DER NAKHT. The music and lyrics can be found in Chana and Yosl
Mlotek's wonderful new Yiddish song collection, "Songs of Generations." It
is available from The Workman's Circle Book Center in Manhattan.
Interesting historical notes accompany this and all the other songs in this
300+ page book, as well as in the previous 2 song collections by the same
authors.
