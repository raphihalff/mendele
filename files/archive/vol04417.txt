Subject: Romanian Jewry - more

I received a request for the citation of the book on Romanian Jewry I had
mentioned in connection with my admiration of YIVO and the klal-shprakh.
The book is very valuable, since we think of the shtetl as more of an
east-central phenomenon, and shtetlekh in Romania really were different
from the mold. This book dovetails beautifully  with Ghitta Sternberg's
book _Stefanesti: portrait of a Romanian shtetl_ (Rick mentioning that
book *again*?)

Sternberg explains the relations of Jews with the peasantry, and says
that they were better than in Slavic Eastern Europe because of the
"easygoing Latin temperament" of the peasants. The book I'm about to cite
confirms that it was the boyars (groyse pritsim) that were down on the
Jews, would not allow them to become citizens and generally wanted to
make life unbearable. The upshot was that all of rural Jewry in Romania
decided literally to walk out of Romania, and took to the roads. The
peasants greeted them along the way, begging them to stay, providing them
with food for their journey, and literally crying heyse trern. The reason
that this is of general interest was that the western powers, including
the U.S. were suddenly flooded with refugees, and it was a good
opportunity to get the world community to do something about the pogroms,
lack of access to citizenship and generally the autocratic system of
government, which was perpetuating what seemed to be an antiquated
problem, defined as the "Jewish Question". Fascinating reading (and
again, I'll plug Sternberg's book about the "douceur de vie" among the
Romanian shtetl-dwellers). If one considers also Bessarabia, a
Moldavian/Romanian speech-area, do we maybe have a clue to the plethora
of "Romanian" songs that Ellen Prince mentioned on a program she
sponsored on WEVD? There seemed to be a lot of songs with Bessarabia and
Kesheniver in the title (with lots of freyd "In Romenie iz dokh gut"
"Mayn Shtetl Yas"  "Ikh benk nokh Besarabie"). Sternberg leads us to
believe that life indeed was better than in Poland, since the Jews lived
a middle-class life. Ah yes, in Romenye iz geven take zis dos lebn.

One caveat to what I am sure is an oversimplification: Bessarabia was
the part of Moldavia under czarist Russian control, and Kishinev was
the site of a notorious pogrom.

And now the citation:

Subject: The Forward needs an in-house Yiddish consultant

For purposes of ready identification, I suggest to hold to the folllowing
distinction:  _Forverts_ for the Yiddish-language paper;  _Forward_ for
the English-language one.

1.  "Meydl" un "Mentsh:"   The _Forward_ carries an advertisement section
where people looking for mates advertise their "personals."  This section
is headed by a small banner "Matchmaker, Matchmaker" (very likely from
the popular song in "Fiddler on the Roof") and underneath it the phrase,
all in capital letters, "Meet a Meydl, Meet a Mensch."

I doubt very much if a woman reader of the _Forward_ would look for a
"bashertn" in a German "Mensch," but would rather opt gleefully for a
Yiddish "Mentsh."

2.  Questioning the Forward's Yiddish:  In a Letter to the Editor, Susan
Saender Rogol, from New Haven, Conn., wrote:  "My husband says, since the
Yiddish-language mistake was not in Philologos, it does not matter.  I
say, if you cannot count on the Forward for the most correct use of
Yiddish, well, where are we to look? So I want to note that in the Feb.
24  " 'Coffee Talk' Leaves Fans Farklempt" the writer speaks of "shikses
and sheygetzes."  I know of no "shegetzes," only "shkotzim."

Well said, but with a big _however_ in capital letters:  To "count on the
Forward for the most correct use of Yiddish," is highly questionable.
Philologos notwithstanding, he is not an in-house staff member, so he is
not around to settle problems of Yiddish usage or spelling in the last
hours before the paper goes to press.  At times, the romanized spelling
of Yiddish words in the Forward is simply outrageously _ameratsish_
(ignorant), and leaves the reader who knows Yiddish "farklemt" (sad,
depressed), not "farklempt" [_sic_].
