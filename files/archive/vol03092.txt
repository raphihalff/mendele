Subject: Yehupets

free association to zachary baker's _yehupets_:

when my father didn't like some perfume my mother was using, he
would ask if she was wearing 'evening in yehupets'. i still think of
that when i smell a perfume i don't like.

Zachary Baker asks where Boiberik, Kasrilevke and Yehupets were
located.  Don't know about the first two, but wasn't Yehupets
understood to be Kiev?

Subject: Rhymes

to dave sherman:

question: how come you don't say /kumets alef u/? that's how i
learned it.

re rhymes and dialects, as part of the study i did of the dialect in
singing of sarah gorby, i studied her treatment of rhymes. it seemed
as tho she enjoyed breaking rhymes in general but, in any event, she
would very frequently break the rhyme when it was not a rhyme in her
(bessarabian) dialect and she always broke the rhyme when the rhyme
depended on some other regional dialect (e.g. central yiddish).
examples:

	rhyme			rendition
        _____                   _________
	avek/teg		avek/teyg
	shpet/magnet		shpeyt/magnet
	blumen/kumen		blumen/kimen
	mekhutonim/sonim	mekhitunim/sonim
	shtraln/faln		shtraln/foln
	lang/bank		long/bank
	zayn/shtayn (CY)	zayn/shteyn, zan/shteyn

frankly, i find it laughable when a singer maintains a rhyme at the
expense of their language, e.g. kate smith rhyming _more_ with
_sure_ in the song 'more'; she does not otherwise say /shor/ for
_sure_. or what about the nursery rhyme about the lady who went to
the cupboard to get her poor doggie a bone; when she got there, the
cupboard was bare, and so her poor doggie had none? you wouldn't
want your kids to rhyme _none_ with _bone_, now would you? see what
i mean?

Subject: on orthography and dialects

to nissen:

while the galitsianer in me often balks at what has been chosen as
'standard yiddish', i do think SOME arbitrary choice of dialect is
inevitable for a writing system. for quite a few hundred years now,
every language that has a writing system has a conventional
orthography. (and it goes without saying that every living language
has dialect variation.) so i really don't think we can ask of a
conventional orthography that your grandmother's or my grandmother's
pronunciation be faithfully reproduced.

re how you would differentiate your grandmother's pronunciation of
mouth and moel in a yivo-based PHONETIC system, it would be /mol/
(or /mowl/, depending on how detailed you want it) vs. /moyl/. i
would suggest that we use slashes when we're representing the actual
sounds rather than the conventional orthography to avoid confusion.

re having an orthography that would teach semi-speakers or
non-speakers how to pronounce a regional dialect, i think that's
really too much to ask. the way you learn a regional dialect is to
grow up speaking it or to study it in depth. to invent sound changes
on the assumption that the odds are that you'll get it right
produces a truly absurd (in my humble opinion) product. i had a
yiddish instructor once who attempted to recreate central yiddish
but came out with /er iz NUKH nisht gekimen/--she went with the odds
that _nokh_ 'still' should become /u/ (as in fact is the case with
_nokh_ 'after'), and she lost. and it sounded like a bad joke. for
those who wish to retain their ancestral dialect, i would suggest
that they use the regional variants when they're sure of them and
the standard otherwise. in fact, most native yiddish speakers in the
yiddish diaspora (i.e. today) switch between their native dialect
and a/some standard quite a bit, so it's not that bizarre. plus, for
us semi-speakers, it has the added benefit that we won't
'hypercorrect', i.e. create a pseudo-standard form by mistake. (for
example, i can never remember if the standard yiddish word for
'cheese' is /kes/, /keys/, /kez/, or /keyz/, so i just stick with
the central yiddish /keys/ that i grew up with. it may be jarring to
the purists but at least it's yiddish and consistent with the other
nonstandard things i say. of course, when writing yiddish in the
hebrew alphabet, i have to consult a dictionary to know how it's
spelled. my yiddish spelling is atrocious, as you can imagine, but
/vus ken men tiyen/? :) )

Subject: Peretz

I am an Adjunct Professor at Washington University (St. Louis), in
the Dept. of Asian & Near Eastern Languages & Literatures.  My field
is Modern Hebrew Literature.  I am on this list for now because I am
interested in seeing the issues that are discussed here.  How much I
can contribute remains to be seen.

Now a query: can anyone tell me anything about the sources or
possible sources that underlie Peretz's story titled in Hebrew "Bein
shenei harim"? I'd be grateful.

James Diamond
