Subject: Berkhes

Western Yiddish "bEerkhes" or "bArkhes"; definitely NOT "bOrkhes" and NOT
"milkhik". It MAY be that one or another of the non-Jewish languages has
borrowed the word with "o" or bakes the bread with milk, but this is NOT
the case in Yiddish. Cf. American English "holly bread".

By the way, doesn't anyone rise to the suggestion that both "berkhes" and
"khale" may derive from the names of Teutonic goddesses?

Subject: Lib hobn/holt hobn

I never intended to suggest that "ikh hob lib" was the northeastern form.
I may have used the expression in order to illustrate the
dative-accusative case merger in NEY: "ikh hob IR lib" (no "ZI"). In
fact, the characteristic NEY form IS "holt hobn".

Subject: Nit/nish(t)

Decidedly regional variants: the former is NEY form. On the other hand,
it's very likely that contact AND the literature has yielded much mixture
that speakers find difficult to disentangle. German dialects reveal a
similar split and, considering German and Eastern Yiddish (in the Slavic
countries) as a geographic continuum, the relative distribution of the
variants with respect to one another gives us much to think about. Wait
patiently for Volume IV!

By the way, in Transylvania, the Yiddish word for 'not' is "niks", not to
be confused with 'niks' in Dutch Yiddish, where it means 'nothing'
(Eastern "gorni(sh)t".

Subject: Pain in the whatever

Distinctively Litvish: "es iz mir tut vey di (sic!) kop/di hant, etc."
Also, "ikh hob a tut-veyike hant". Howzat?

Subject: Thieves' cant

What/who is the source of the suggestion that "jenisch" is of Gypsy
origin?

Consider that, along with German "Gauner" (of non-German origin), it may
derive, instead' from Hebrew-Yiddish "yavan" ('Greece', 'Russian
soldier' [as in "a yovn in suke"]). The "Griechisches Beisl" ("bayis!")
in Vienna is said to have been a meeting place for thieves. Does anyone
know whether, in fact, "grec" in French serves as does "terkish" in the
Yiddish expression "opton af terkish"? Does anyone know where I may have
picked up that suggestion?

Subject: The Yiddish "r"

Atlas Volume I, Map 68 shows the distribution of the two major
articulatory variants of Yiddish "r", described as "lingual tap or trill"
as agains "velar or uvular, generally untrilled". I'll leave it to
someone else who has seen a copy of the map to describe the geography.

See David L. Gold "Towards a study two Yiddish synonyms of unclear
origin: pareve and minikh," in _Jewish Language Review_, Volume 5 (1985):
128-139.

Subject: Dav(e)nen

See Philologus, Dec 9. The proferred "Yevanic" etymon is no more or less
convincing than the many that Birnbaum considers and rejects (see
Birnbaum in the above-cited _Jewish Language Review_, Volume 5 (1985),
and Gold in the same issue). Still, we should be grateful for one more,
no less unproven, possibility.

Of course, it's not necessary to find a "dav" etymon in any other
language to explain this Yiddish word. We have numerous instances of
prevocalic "fricativization" WITHIN Yiddish: NEY "novnt/SEY nuvnt"
(noent) 'near', "e(y)ver" (oyer/eyer) 'ear', "ever" (toyer/teyer")
'gate', "zaver/SEY "zover" (zoyer!) 'sour'; also, SEY "gedovern"
(gedoyern) 'to last', "boven" (boyen) 'to build'. See Atlas Volume I,
Maps 20, 26, 31, 40, 41. When we actually find instances of "doyenen" 'to
pray' in Belorus, (Atlas, Volume III), it gives one to think. Are these
back- formations or do they point to an etymon from which
fricativized"dav(e)nen" emerged in Yiddish? We probasbly still "don't
know".

Subject: Help Wanted from Germanist or German speaker

With respect to their stressed vowels, what other pairs of German words
relate as do "Schnee" [e:] 'snow' and "schneien" [ay] 'to snow'? Yiddish
has either "shney"/"shneyen" or "shnay"/"shnayen". What gives?
