Subject: IWO/YIVO

In MENDELE 4.022 Gaston L. Schmir comments on the use of IWO to represent
the Yiddish acronym YIVO.  It should be made clear that the Buenos Aires
YIVO has used those letters as the YIVO acronym, and not the New York
YIVO.  The "Musterverk" series, published by the "Literatur-gezelshaft
baym YIVO" in Argentina, contains the following Spanish name on the
versos of many title pages: Ateneo literario en el IWO.

On the added title pages, the following publisher's name usually appears:

Ateneo literario en el Instituto cientifico judio.

The two YIVOs in New York and Buenos Aires could once have been described
as branches of a single organization, but as time and the generations
have passed they are effectively two separate organizations.  I have
heard through the grapevine that the Argentine YIVO is considering a
merger with other Yiddishist groups, such as the Argentine branch of the
Alveltlekher yidisher kultur-kongres (like the two YIVOs, there are two
of these).  If there are any MENDELnikes with decent Argentine
connections, it would be interesting to hear more details about this
possible combination of forces.

Back to the name IWO/Instituto cientifico judio for a moment:  It IS
striking that our counterparts in Argentina choose to use the acronym IWO
-- not only because of the "W" (used only in loan-words in Spanish) but
also because of the "I."  Think about it -- the implication is that
"Yidisher" (with tsvey-yudn) should be pronounced "Idisher" (as indeed it
often is, depending on one's geographic origins).  And, as Dr. Schmir
pointed out, the original English name for YIVO was Yiddish Scientific
Institute.  That name goes back to the days of the Vilna YIVO.  "Yiddish
Scientific" has always been problematic, because (a) YIVO is not
exclusively (or these days even primarily) a Yiddish-oriented institute,
and (b) "Visnshaft" (=Wissenschaft; Nauk) has a broader connotation in
Yiddish (and other European languages) than it does in English, where
unless "science" is qualified by "social" it refers to biological,
chemical or physical sciences.  Hence the change of name to YIVO
Institute for Jewish Research.  Our hispanophone readers can perhaps
comment on the precise connotation of "cientifico" in "Instituto
cientifico judio" (though note:  judio, not yiddish, is used in Spanish).

I have not seen the spelling YIWO, though on pre-war Polish editions I
have seen JIWO.  One last "tshikavest":  During World War II, the acronym
YIVO was used by Jews in some ghettos as shorthand for "YIdn Viln Azoy."
This is explained by Yisroel Kaplan as follows:  "A bakante
'nays-agentur' geven bay di yidn in Baltikum." (See "Dos folksmoyl in
natsi-klem," Tel Aviv, 1982, p. 110.  I have also seen it used in the
same context for "YIdn Veysn Alts.")

A friend who now resides faraway from both New York and Buenos Aires used
to refer to the institute as YIVO-knivo.

Subject: Help needed with Yiddish handwriting

A colleague of mine asked whether I'd translate some Yiddish letters
written by his grandmother.  So I said I would, and got the letters,
and would I believe have no trouble translating them - if only I could
read them.  I have almost no experience in reading Yiddish handwriting,
and wondered whether the Mendele-collective could offer me any advice.
For example, are there books with samples of Yiddish handwriting
transcribed into print?  Or any particularly useful techniques?  I'd
be grateful for any and all help - thanks,

Larry Rosenwald

Subject: jewish comics

The 1914-1915 comic strips of Abie the Agent (aka Abe Kabibble) by Harry
Hershfield was published in 1977 by Hyperion Press, Inc.  45 Riverside
Avenue, Westport, CT 06880.  I recommend them for their picture of
"yiddish" in America in those times.

Another book to look at is Michael Corenthal's Cohen on the Telephone, A
History of Jewish Recorded Humor and Popular Music 1892-1942, published
in 1984 by Yesterday's Memories, 5406 West Center St. Milwaukee, WI
53210.

By the way, was Will Eisner of "an Opmach mit Got" the same Will Eisner
who penned The Spirit during the 40's?

Subject: Shabbatai Zvi

I'm sure that most Mendelniks have heard of Shabbatai Zvi, the false messiah
who lived in Salonika and Smyrna in the 17th century.  His "colorful" story
is well known around the Sephardic world and is a subject of literature in
Ladino.  I'm curious to know whether Shabbatai's fame spread to the
Ashkenazic realm either during his lifetime or soon afterwards, and whether
any mention of him is found in Yiddish literature.  Also, was there ever a
false messiah in the Ashkenazic world who achieved as much fame (or
mischief) as did Shabbatai?

Subject: Mayn Kaleh's Appetit

Perhaps one of Mendele's Musical Mavens can answer this query....

Years ago in the basement of the HUC library in Cincinnati I came across
the words to a Sani Shapiro broadside, Mayn Kaleh's Appetit.  Then
reference to this song (without reference to music or recording) showed
up in Marc Slobin's wonderful book, Tenement Songs.  Does anyone have
sheet music or know a melody to this?  I have the words and, atonal as I
am, I can't quite fit them to a melody.  Maybe there is a Sani Shapiro
collector out there?

I take no political responsibility for the song's title.
