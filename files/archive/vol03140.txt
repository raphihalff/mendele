Subject: Starting with a verb

For Noyekh Miller,

Of course you're missing nothing. Sentences in Yiddish can and do
begin wit verbs, and the examples you gave are but a few of the
various functions this word-order has in Yiddish.  Someone must have
read too much grammars instead of literature (this coming from a
linguist).

Subject: lezn/sch/leading with verbs

Subject: past participle of lezn

mea culpa, i was wrong about 'remembering' /geleyznt/. the
subsequent posts have had their proustian effect on me and of course
it was /geleyzn/.

Subject: Yankel Lantz's _sch_:

the problem with writing _sch_ for yiddish shin is that _sch_ always
has the value /sh/ only in german and not in any known international
phonemic transcription system and not in english. most english words
i can think of which _sch_ are in fact pronounced /sk/ (school,
scheme, schedule...). so, given that we're writing english here (if
not yiddish), why use a german system? it is as strange as using the
french one would be, where we'd represent /sh/ as _ch_. unless, of
course, you think yiddish is a variety of german... ;)

Subject: reb noyekh's 'caper':

well, you won't get any chiding from THIS linguist, just some
additions to your list:

3. bin ikh mir a shnayderl...
4. forn mekhutonim...
5. hob ikh a por oksn...
6. zitst a shnayder, neyt un neyt...

>So what am I missing?

not a blessed thing. yiddish (like icelandic) has a very productive
verb-first declarative form, only very incompletely (and,
apparently, misleadingly) described in weinreich.

Subject: Leyenen/lezn

I am a bit puzzled about this. In fact I have always assumed lezn to
be a germanism. We certainly use leynen (not *leyenen* !) for "read"
whether it be koydesh or khol. When I started to hear people use
Leyenen for "reading the toyre" as an =English= expression it took
me a long time to get used to it. Maybe the distinction is  a purely
litvishe one.

Correct me if I am wrong, but my feeling is that the difference
between koydesh and khol uses of words with otherwise similar
meanings is rstricted to nouns, and in any event, the koydesh use is
a word of Hebrew origin e.g. seyfer - bukh.

Subject: Leyenen un lezn (un lernen)

Using my  German Orthodox background, I can support the statement of
Marion Aptroot.  In Germany (at least in the early  1930's) leinen
(I spell it as if it was a German word) was used for reading at shul
from the  Torah Scroll.   As far as I recall, it was not used for
the Haftara.  Lesen was used for any other form or reading.

There was also an unusual use of the word lernen (learn).  If
applied to an ordinary subject, it was  like the English to learn or
learning. When on  the other hand one  said about someone that  "er
kann lernen" (he can learn) it did not mean that he was no imbecile,
and could be taught, but that he was *knowledgeable*  in the Talmud
etc.  Is that the same also in Yiddish?

Jeremy Stern explains and at the end he asks:

>Ellen's question reminds me of a problem I had when I read Katz's

>years and vocalizing them, he chose the example of 5748, or 1987/8.

>"tisdam" to avoid tashmad."  Does anyone remember if Israeli papers

>did so?

To the best of my recollection, in general, outside the Orthodox
world, tishdam was not much used and that in spite of the added
danger that that year corresponded mostly to 1984! I remember that
four years later,  5748, tismah with its implied happiness was the
year the intifada started :-(.

In my first year in Palestine, 5696, many looked forward to it as it
could be read tirtzu, "if you want", reminding one of Herzl's motto at
the beginning of Altneuland, "if you want it is no fable".  When that
year turned out pretty badly, the me'ora'ot starting (the Arabs called
it the Arab  Revolt) lasting till 1939, this was  "explained", that
these four letters also stand for tzarot (tzores).  One should not try
to beat numerologists, they will always win.
