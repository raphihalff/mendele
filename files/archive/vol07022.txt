Subject: boyuvke

in response to M. Engel's query about the word "boyuvke" [7.021], it means 
"armed band" and comes from the Polish noun "bojo'vka" (pronounced
"boyuvka--since the acute accent over the "o" changes the pronunciation to
"u").  The Polish word can be found in the Polish-English dictionary
published by the Kos'ciuszko Foundation--anyone seriously working with
Yiddish, especially as spoken in Poland, ought to have a copy.

Subject: Thomas Mann on Bergelson

Does anyone know anything (such as source, date, etc.) about Thomas Mann's
review of the German translation of Bergelson's "Nokh Alemen" (the German
title is:  "Das Ende vom Lied")?

Subject: boyuvka

With reference to Marvin Engel's query [7,021:1] concerning the word
'boyuvka', I can inform him that the meaning is 'assault squad' or 'storming
party'. I am replying to Mendele rather to him personally, because there is
a general principle here which some Mendelyaner seem to overlook, to judge
at least from the frequency of requests for elucidation about the meaning of
lexical items derived from the 'coterritorial' languages. Yiddish, as we all
know, borrowed hugely from the Slav languages and a large number of these
borrowings which became 'naturalised' Yiddish words are to found in Yiddish
dictionaries. However, as anyone knows who has lived for any length of time
in an environment in which a language other than his/ her native tongue is
prevalent, it inevitably becomes convenient to borrow terms on an ad hoc
basis. Such words then become candidates for permanent adoption, but most of
them are used so infrequently that they never reach the dictionary of that
native tongue. Yiddish for obvious reasons is an extreme case in this regard
and it would be unreasonable to expect such nonce borrowings to appear in
even the most comprehensive Yiddish dictionary. Serious Yiddishists just
have to face the fact that, in addition to the familiar (and notoriously
inadequate) Yiddish lexicographical resources, they need to equip themselves
with at least Polish and Ukrainian dictionaries (Stanislawski and
Andrushyshen respectively are the ones I would recommend). You don't need to
learn Polish or Ukrainian, if you don't want to. It really doesn't take very
long to work out from the introduction to a good primer how the orthographic
system of each of these two languages function and then you have vast
supplementary lexical resources at your disposal. In this instance you would
quickly learn that 'boyuvka' is the Polish word 'bojowka' (spelled with an
acute accent on the 'o' which makes it sound like [u]) and that it is
derived from 'bojowy' = 'fighting' which in turn comes from 'boj' (likewise
with acute) = 'combat', 'struggle'.

Subject: boyuvka

"bojowka", from the Polish word with a dot over the "o"--fight, struggle.  
a fighting unit or group, usually made up of a dozen or so young people 
either to attack Jews or to defend them.  The Endeks had bojowkas in 
Poland, so did the Bund and other left-wing Zionist youth groups.

Subject: Bashevis, demons, and typos

While reading the NY Times article about the typos on Bashevis' tombstone, "A
Too Noble Epitaph", I was suddenly transported into a Singer story - two
lovers demonically chained in death to the irate husband for eternity, and
the story printed with multiple typos. Were Bashevis' imps and demons at work
here, even after his death?

Janet Hadda, his new biographer, tells in the spring issue of the Pakn Treger
how she felt waylaid by demons as she sought interviews with people who had
been part of his crazy world; she was becoming transformed into a character
wihin his fantastic tales. Doors mysteriously swung open and shut, strange
stories appeared on demonic microphones, uncanny encounters with birds
appeared normal, as she sought the truth for her recently published
biography.

Next I remembered Singer's tales of his woeful suffering of typos and
misspellings at the hands of the Forward typesetters. One story told of how
the printers went so far as to have published one edition, that was missing
the final paragraph of his submission. Lo and behold, his closing sentences
turned up in a competing newspaper, "Der Tog".

I could not help wondering if these gravestone typos were Alma's carelessness
and  irresponsibility in checking what was ordered to be cut, or did imps
shove the tools in the hands of the stonecutter, or was the "h" omitted from
Bashevis merely because the stonecutter was a Litvak!
