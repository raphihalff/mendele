Subject: Ruth Rubin

I regret to announce to my friends on Mendele, that Ruth Rubin, a
folklorist of Yiddish songs, died on Sunday, June 10 in the Sarah R.
Neumann Nursing Home in Mamaroneck, NY at the age of 93.

An obituary of some length may be found in the New York Times of June
17, p. A 11 (west coast edition) in which it is suggested that her work
was an important cornerstone in the revival of Yiddish that is currently
occupying all of us.

Subject: "shikt arayn a boyer"

Does anyone know the lyrics to a song my grandmother used to sing to me?  It
started off like:

Shikt arayn a boyer in vald arayn, a boyer in vald arayn, zol dem fayer leshn.

The meaning is that there is a fire in the woods and it goes on to say that
the boyer (peasant) brings a stick, which brings water, which brings
something else, etc. etc.

Thank you.

The Polish word komorne means rent. Hope this is useful.

Subject: komerne

My parents who were in the real estate business..as am I....used the word to
describe a bill collector who made periodic visits to homes...in order to
collect insurance payments, rents..etc.

I was told that the expression came from...  the invitation to "come in"
kum arayn.

Subject: Yiddish in the camps

For a journalistic project, I am looking for information about the use of
Yiddish in concentration camps. Does anyone have any figures, or
approximations, or guesses about the percentage of inmates who spoke
Yiddish? Were any new Yiddish words coined?  I am assuming that Yiddish
functioned as a common language among inmates, and that Nazis spoke German
only. Is this correct?

Many thanks.

Arre Komar (10.019) wrote:

     With regard to the very interesting report (10.011) that Glik's use of
     three different words for gun in the same song (Zog Nisht Keynmol) had
     a specific political intention, the anecdote suffers from a small
     difficulty: In that song only the word "naganis" is used. The Glik song
     that uses 3 different words for gun is "Shtil, Di Nakht Iz
     Oysgeshternt." I hope that apart from this detail the essence of the
     story is reliable.

If Arre Komar will go back to my original post (10.006), he will see that
this WAS in reference to "Shtil, Di Nakht", not the "Partizan Hymn" or "Zog
Nit Keynmol".

Subject: "oyb men vil fleysh.."

In Marjorie Hirshan's posting (Mendele Volume 10 Number 13) in the
translation discussion, she writes

     Beyond the compulsive cry for exactitude, I remember, and want to note,
     the anti-translation era of the secular Jew. When a parent asked our
     beloved shula teacher, Yankl Blank, to respond in English, he answered
     idealistically and passionately, "A ki git bloyz milkh; oyb men vil
     fleysh muz men es derhargenen." (A cow gives only milk; if you want
     meat, you must slaughter it.) The survival of Yiddish then was to
     speak, read, write Yiddish!

Am I the only one who doesn't understand the drift of the teacher's answer? I
understand the literal translation, and the last sentence makes sense in the
context of the paragraph and the discussion. And I agree.

But an explanation of the metaphor/proverb/whatever would be very welcome to
me in my denseness.

a dank.

Subject: orl

In Mendele 10.019 both Martin Davis and Paul Gasser refer to Motl Peysi dem
Khazns, Chapter VII, "mayn bruder Elyes getrank", hey, in relation to 'orl'.
Martin Davis says: "A bystander refers to the cop as the orl, and advises
Motl to make tracks". In the Melukhe Farlag version of 1947 I find no 'orl'
but a 'yovn' (a word earlier discussed on the Mendele list):

     Sholem Aleikhem, motl, peysi dem khasns, Chapt.VII, 'hey': "daber
     nisht, du narisher yodl, af dayn okhi!" zogn tsu mir etlekhe yidn ale
     mitamol. ... ruft zikh on tsu mir eyner, an alter yid mit gneyvishe
     oygn, farshtelt, af loshn koydesh: "Motl, rays aroys dem yad funem yovn
     un heyb uf di raglayim un makh pleyte!" (geshribn in yor 1907).

Subject: Lovitch and some more

About ikh hob dir in Lovitch:  It was an expression heard often in Varshe
(Warsaw) and vicinity.  In Vilne it was said "Ikh hob dikh in Trok" (I am
not sure about dir and dikh).  Both places signifies remote localities, hard
to get to. Lowicz was a district town some 50 miles from Varshe.  About
18-19 thousand people before the war with some 4.5 thousand Jews.  Yes,
there was a cemetery dating back to probably 17th century.  In olden times
it was hard to access the place.

Trok (Troki, Trakai) was much smaller.  it was a town about 3 thousand
people with about 300-325 Jews and many more Karaites.  Only about 17 miles
from Vilne, it was hard to reach, not only in those olden times but even in
the 1930's.  Located among lakes and off the main track, Troki in Wilno was
a synonym of remotness (and certain dislike on account of the Karaites).

If somebody wanted to get rid of an unwanted interlocutor and didn't want to
use some of the expressions mentioned in the previous postings, he would say
"Ikh hob dikh in Lowicz (when in Varshe), or in Trok (when in Vilne).  The
meaning  was the same:  get lost in that Godforsaken place that no one can
reach easily. After all, some Jews tried to be polite not only to the goyim.

Regards to all who try to disentangle and understand our old folk sayings.
