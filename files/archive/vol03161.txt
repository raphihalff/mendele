Subject: Pavolye

A request has come in for the words to a song taught to this woman
by her immigrant mother early this century.  She thinks the title
may have been PAVOLYE meaning SLOW.

She recalls a line:

IN AMERIKE IZ GEVEZN A REVOLYE...........

She is from Pasadena, CA, and mentions her Yiddish club has 5
members under 35.  I'll pass along any info you have.

Reyzl wrote (in 3.158):

        "But what has not been clear in the recent leynen/lezn
        discussion is that lezn is a daythmerish word.  Despite the
        fact that lezn is an old term in Western Yiddish and one
        that reached a wide distribution in Eastern Yiddish since
        the late 19th century (but never in my immediate family),
        it's still daythmerish in Eastern Yiddish.  It is therefore
        not recommended in Standard Yiddish."

       This appears to imply that Yiddish may borrow words from
Polish, Russian, Hebrew, English, etc., just as all languages whose
speakers know other languages borrow, but no German word may be
accepted in Standard Yiddish no matter how long and how widely it's
been used in Yiddish.  You can't mean that no borrowing at all is
permitted since the mid-19th century, though I think some people do
feel that way.  It's natural that there's a certain easy tendency
(yeytser hore?) to borrow from German, and correspondingly a
preference to resist excessive replacement of native Yiddish stuff
(vocabulary, grammatical patterns, spelling habits) by elements from
German, but why does this have to be pushed to the extreme?

       After all, the leyenen/lezn distinction is semantically
useful and fits right in with bukh/seyfer and all the other
"Jewish/Goyish" pairs, and so the distinction itself is very Yiddish
indeed.  After all, German doesn't have this particular distinction!
In this connection, here's my very favorite quote from Max Weinreich
(who, incidentally, is probably the one who first said that a
language is a dialect with an army and a navy).  It's from "The
Reality of Jewishness versus the Ghetto Myth: The Sociolinguistic
Roots of Yiddish", in TO HONOR ROMAN JAKOBSON, reprinted in NEVER
SAY DIE! A THOUSAND YEARS OF YIDDISH IN JEWISH LIFE AND LETTERS, ed.
by J. Fishman:

"This applies to any field of culture: More often than not, it
appears, the distance between Jewish and non-Jewish patterns is
created not by a difference in the ingredients proper but rather by
the way they are interpreted as parts of the given system."

       By this criterion, the leyenen/lezn distinction is as Jewish,
and Yiddish, as anything could be.

Subject: Ufruf

Reyzl asked for specific places where modern Orthodox Jews say
_ufruf_. The point I was trying to make is that it is a
pronunciation that surpasses geographical divisions.  (I would add
that I believe modern Orthodoxy to have a _havore_, or several ones,
all its own.)

But, as Reb Yishmoel says, "Vekheyn shney ksuvim hamakhishim ze es
ze, ad she yavo hakosev hashlishi veyahkria beyneyem," I decided to
conduct some research of my own.  So I asked members of the Orthodox
community at Princeton, which contains Jews from cities as diverse
as Chicago, LA, Dayton, what we call it when a man gets an aliah the
week before his marriage. (One person responded, "Don't you mean the
week _after_ the marriage?"  She is of Sephardic ancestry, and her
family calls it shabat hatan.)  I did not hear a single instance of
_ofrif_, _ifrif_, etc.  True, I am not using sophisticated
linguistic methods, but that was what I heard.  There was variation
in vowel-length, with some pronouncing the first "u" as in "foot"
and some as in "food".  I will try the same experiment in writing,
though I suspect it will yield "ufruf" universally.
