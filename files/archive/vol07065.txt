Subject: Asking for Gems

Sholom Aleichem,

Allow me to introduce myself.  I am a Yiddish speaker born after WWII. I live 
in St. Paul, Minnesota.  Besides Jewish history and culture, my interests,
generally, lie in the Ancient Near East and I moderate a mailing list devoted
to the study of ancient Egypt.

Today I have a question and a request.  I do have a Yiddish dictionary here,
but it is not very comprehensive at all.  Has anyone ever heard the word
"haspel"?  It is a surname, but what does it mean?  Also, can anyone give me
the names of some gem stones in Yiddish?  I don't mean commonly-known items
like diamant or rubenstein, but some that are a bit more obscure, including
the semi-precious stones.  Some chutzpah, eh?  It's like saying to a complete
stranger "My name is so-and-so and now will you kindly walk to the corner
grocery and buy me a loaf of bread, please? Thanks."  Ah, well, nisht kein
kishkes, nisht kein kovod.

Marianne Luban

Subject: Internatsyonal

The great poet H. Leivick also translated the "Internatsyonal:"

Shteyt oyf, ir knekht fun ale lender,
Fun klem, fun hunger un fun noyt;
Roymt op dem shinder un dem shender,
Tsum kamf oyf lebn un oyf toyt.

Di alte velt fun gvald un leydn
Tseshtern veln mir biz grund,
Un fray, un glaykh in glik un freydn
Farshnaydn veln mir a bund.

  Dos vet zayn shoyn der letster
  Un antsheydener krig,
  Mit dem internatsyonal
  Veln mir geyn un kumen tsum zig.

Mir kumen on mit gvure-trit;
Mir ale arbeter armeyen,
Der raykher shnaydt vos mir farzeyen,
Itst monen mir oykh undzer shnit.

Der ruf un kamf git mut dem midn,
Un makht im shtark tsum alem greyt;
Tseblozt dem flam un lomir shmidn,
Kol-zman dos ayzn flakert royt.
   Dos vet zayn...
(Printed in "Lomir zingen", compiled by Michel Gelbart, Workmen's Circle,
l938-9)

Subject: Taking Yiddish seriously

Please help. When it comes to Yiddish learning, let's start at home. It has
become increasingly apparent to me that even those who care about Yiddish
don't care enough to keep up a proper front. For example, more and more people
think that Moyshe Kapoyer was really Moyshe Kapore. I actually heard this
repeated twice at a public conference. Someone else recently told me of
someone "shleping Nakhes" from his kids. The saddest blow was to see, in a
letter from YIVO, of all places the new Executive Director signing his Yiddish
name upside down on the one paragraph in Yiddish tagged on the the very end of
a very long letter that was largely pretending that Yiddish was returning to
Poland. As if... Yiddish goes from right to left, not upside-down. My Yiddish
students here know better after two weeks of study. Moyshe Kapoyer.

Subject: az me lebt

Az me lebt, derlebt men in Mendele on a shir hokhmes, interpretatsyes,
hamtsoes...

Having gone away on vacation for some weeks, I've only just slogged my way
through old mail, including the stacks of Mendele responses to my request
for help in translating the above. I've responded personally to personal
responses, but would like to take this opportunity to thank all the
participants in the fascinating Mendele thread this question produced. 

Un vi azoy vel ikh dos iberzetsn sof kol sof? Fort a shayle...
