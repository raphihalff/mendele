Subject: RE: Mendele Vol 1.236

Please help!  My grandmother used to refer to me as "a bis
verrickt" and my grandfather told me I was "meshugge."
There were other words they used on me like "vertummelt"
and "verblundget" which were clearly not compli- mentary.
Does anyone have a declension of the Yiddish words
referring to various "confused states of mind," a Yiddish
DSM/III, if you will.  Thank you for any assistance you can
give.

1) To Vicki Fromkin:

I'm glad to be in touch again too!  As for "Hold the Fort"
in Yiddish, I'm chagrined to realize that I only know the
refrain. Here it is:

Halt zikh fest, mir kumen on,
Yunyenlayt in krig.
Zayt bay zayt, un hoykh di fon,
Kumen vet der zig!


2) To Mikhl Herzog:

Hooray for volume I of the Atlas!  I am getting ready to
make a shekheyonu.


3) To Vicki and Mikhl:

Without in the least questioning the authenticity of the
Chagall story, I'll point out that it's an exemplar of a
folklore type (not necessarily catalogued).  The version
that I heard (at least 35 years ago) tells that Gorky and
Chaliapin grew up together in Nizhni Novgorod.  They both
auditioned for the cathedral choir. Gorki was accepted;
Chaliapin was not.


4) On formulaic greeting/responses:

I have no idea of the earliest attestation of the sholem
aleykhem/aleykhem sholem formula, but I can offer two
further examples of extended responses: sholem
aleykhem/aleykhem vealbneykhem (i.e." to you and to your
children") and leshonetoyve tikoseyvu /tikoseyvu
vesikhoseymu ("may a good year be inscribed/inscribed and
sealed").

Again to Arnold Band:

My message about Hrushovski's book was garbled because of a
computer problem. What I originally wrote in my second
paragraph was that it is perhaps inaccurate to call
Hrushovski/Harshav a Yiddish writer because he has
published little in Yiddish and not for many years because
he assumes the readership to be dead.

Subject: RE: "Introduction Revisited (Cal Pryluck)"

Unless there were 2 Camp Kindervelts along with 2 Unser
Camps, your recollectionas to who sponsored the camps
doesn't gel with the facts.  As a Kindervelt alum who also
made numerous visits to Unser Camp with my parents, I
remember quite clearly that Kindervelt & Unser Camp were
sponsored NOT by Arbeter-Ring but by Farband, Labor Zionist
Organization.  The camps were located near the town of
Highland Mills, (Orange County), New York.  Ironically, I
currently reside in Orange County, California.

I'd be very interested in finding out how many others out
there reading these lines went to Kindervelt &/or Unser
Camp at one time or another.  Di tate-mames vi vayt ikh
gedenk hobn ale geredt mame-loshn beshas ven mir kinderlekh
hobn norgenitst english tsvishn zikh.  In 1989 bin ikh

Vist, pust, shtil.  Alts farshlosn.  Zet oys nor khurves.

Subject: Yiddish vaudeville query

Now that Bob Rothstein has offered the final and definitive
Yiddish version of the Internationale, perhaps someone can
help me with a song from Yiddish vaudeville that has
floated around my mind for fifty years.
 
Schvartze castelach rissed maen
un greeneh loest maen shtein
Sheine meidelach nembt maen
un meise lost maen gein
 
chorus:
 
Oi veyus tsu mea, veyus to meine yur
a leibe mebiche feur
        [the last two words are only approximate]
freilich dri fertel shuer
 
Vos teug mir dos polka mazurka
az tancen tance ich mir nicht
Vot teug mir dos meidele fun Mirka
        [appoximate place name]
az leiben leibt ze mir nicht.
 
chorus:
 
My memory and the form of the song suggest that there were
many more verses; I would also like to be clearer about the
middle line of the chorus.
