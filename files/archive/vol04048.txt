Subject: ets, enk, un, knibbers

I believe that it was I who recently broached the topic of ets and enk on
Mendele.  I have never heard of un and unz but I imagine that these serve
the same function as ets and enk.  Although my exposure to ets and enk
and enker has been limited as far as I know they are not used to express
dual number.  What I mentioned in my letter on ets and enk and Bavarian
German was that these forms derived from an ancient duel.  As far as I
know today they simply are a variant form of Ir, Aykh and Ayer, having
lost their ancient dual significance.  If in fact I am mistaken and a
dual form lives on in the West Germanic languages I would be grateful to
hear more about this.

A new topic: on rare occasions, my father, a native of Brooklyn uses an
expression "a little weak in the knibbers," to mean a bit out of it, not
feeling all there, "nisht mit alemen."  This strikes me as coming from
that same Brooklyn goldmine that gave us "to make a shimilekhl."  I
cannot fathom the etymology of knibbers.  Any suggestions Mendelniks?

Martin Davis informed us:

>For whatever interest it may have, my father's family name in Poland was
>Hershel Davidowicz. In the US it became Harry Davis. I believe this was
>his own decision. "Davis" had been chosen by my father's younger brother
>who had immigrated somewhat earlier.

It seems to be a very  good choice.  I understand that Davidowicz (and
its many spelling variants) means Son of David, so does Davis mean in
Welsh usage.  After his Aliya may I suggest Ben-David or Davidi? :-)

Subject: Germans and Yiddish

To: S. Schapiro

What you say about your wife is true for Germans in general (I'm one
myself, American-born), who feel that Yiddish is not a language, or if it
is, then it's a lower-class patois that comes out of a corruption of
medieval German.

In Endingen and Lengnau there is a native Yiddish dialect which is like
the Alsatian dialect. Very few Slavicisms, more Hochdeutsch than
Alemannisch and in the samples I've read, completely uncorrupted by
Schwyzerduutsch, with which it lives side by side but not mixed. And it
really has that Yidishn tam!

In shul does the rabbi use the Litvak pronunciation? All the Lubavitchers
I know do.

The Endingen/Lengnau book was written ca. 1964, when there were already
mostly old people speaking Swiss Yiddish. Drive over, check it out, and
tell us what you found! I think the title of the book is Jiddisch in
alemannischen Sprachgebiet.

Subject: German attitudes toward Yiddish

I think that this thread may have died out by now, but i see my original
post fell victim to the internet dybbuks, so here goes again...

i had been interested to read how many people felt germans/swiss/etc were
negative or indifferent to yiddish, since this was not my experience at
all.  it may be simply a question of sampling population, since as an
exchange student in germany most of my contact was with high school kids
up thru parents born between 1935 and 1945.  i hadn't planned on making a
big deal out of the fact that i was jewish, since i was living in an
extremely small bavarian catholic town.  (in fact, when i put on my forms
that i didn't eat pork, some german office worker somewhere processing my
form marked me as a muslim!)

BUT.  as soon as i got to my family and was settling in, my yiddish was a
matter of great curiosity and respect.  maybe partly because they saw
that it helped me with bavarian, but also because they really wanted to
learn a lot more about judaism and yiddish.  they of course had never
heard yiddish spoken at all, and had great fun having me speak it to
them.  in school, one girl i met told me that her grandmother had spoken
yiddish, and later i also met her mother who told me she wishes times had
allowed her to learn it as well (but she had been taken in by a catholic
family and raised as a catholic).

most germans i talked to were amazed how much yiddish was like bavarian
(since the prevailing vague notion seemed to be that it was a lot more
like hebrew...)

i'm sure that mendelniks in germany know a lot more about this subject
than i do, but all in all my experiences in this area left me pleasantly
surprised and hopeful-- was i being hopelessly naive, or does this signal
a new trend among many younger germans? (i'm not sure how many yorn
tsurik Yude Rozof's 'etlekhe'is.)

i'm sure that it must have had a lot to do with the fact the my
"informants" were too young to have lived through a time when being
nonplussed by yiddish was advantageous. also their interest may have been
higher because of the tremendous interest in maintaining bavarian as a
cultural language, so i stood out as an american also preserving a
cultural language.

or is this indifference mainly among german-speaking _jews_?? but now
i've said way more than i intended to -- but i felt like i had to make a
small defence for at least some germans here  :)

Subject: Adaptation/Translation:Semantics

     Oy, I think we are into a semantic problem, at the very least!  The
words translation and adaptation mean different things to different
mendelniks.  Some people write as though translation is MERELY word for
word transliteration.  For them adaptation has come to mean rendering the
poem, etc., into an artistic entity in the second language.  Thus for
these people, translation is a "bad" word and adaptation is a "good word.

     For others, adaptation implies cavalier, wanton, and/or egoistic,
opportunistic unfaithfulness to the original text. For them, translation
is a "religous" act of cultural reincarnation, intrinsically good,
faithful and true. (But they always are the first to claim translation is
impossible.)

     No, no, no.  A good, talented, conscientious translator is as
faithful to the language of origin as possible, but adapts as
conservatively and carefully as possible when necessary. Adaption,
however, should never be a substitute for ineptitude or indolence, or
whatever!  Translation is not a political act, it is an art.  That
translation has political overtones is beside the point in this
discussion, though decidely not irrelevant to such issues as "elevation".

     Besides, translation or adaptation of WHAT....content, form or
structure, format, rhyme, assonance, local or dated dialects, quotations?
ETC.  For example, a translator may make adaptations in rhyme scheme or
punctuation in order to more accurately translate the ideas, the mood.

     Jascha Kessler briefly describes the necessary process in good
translation: " Paraphrase,... then metaphrase. Not idiom, not metaphor,
not image....Logemes".  My original post talked about how important it is
not to short-cut or leap over any of this process even if one is
translating with the assistance of a native speaker.  But this is also
true for the singular translator.  Note we speak of translator, not of
adaptors!

     Further:  tranlations are not for eternity; they need to be redone
as our language, or any language changes.

     Fact is a lot of so-called adaptations have been opportunistic on
the part of translator, publisher, or even writer.

     Hope my thoughts are clarifying.  it's a big issue.

South German Origin of Yiddish (answer to Yude Rozof)

Robert King has suggested in a paper some time in the last few years that
the origins of Yiddish are more correctly in southern Germany -- Bavaria,
e.g., -- than in the Rhine region, as Max Weinreich would have it.  I'm
sorry I don't have the paper or paper title handy.

Subject: Vilna YIVO archives

Could anyone tell me what has come of YIVO's efforts to recover or at
least to microfilm the sizable part of the YIVO archives which had been
believed to have been irretrievably lost in the Holocaust and which were
recently found to have been preserved in Vilna?

The last issue of the YIVO journal Yidishe Shprakh to reach me is volume
38, no. 1-3, 1984/1986. Could anyone (like, for example, Zachary Baker)
let me know if there have been any later issues, or, for that matter,
whether this journal still exists.

Subject: RE: Yiddish correspondence

To Leybl Botwinik re: your letter of 6/29/94

  I read with interest your call for Yiddishe Fedder-Fraynt [pen-pals].
We are beginning just such a program.  We are in the embryonic stage
right now, and I am in the process of collecting American and European
names.  I am starting this program through Fishl Kutner's "Der Bay" and
it would be terrific if I could use the good offices of Mendele to
communicate with even more people.  The first thing we must start with is
the European correspond- ants.  If you are currently writing in Yiddish
to anyone in Europe or Israel (or ANYWHERE), ask them if they'd like to
correspond with someone in the USA.  I currently have four Israeli and
European fedder-fraynt.  It's a wonderful experience.  I'm going to
Latvia this Fall to visit a pen-pal in Riga.

  About the Yiddish Resource Center:  everyone agrees that we need one.
But where?  I have contacted the National Yiddish Book Center 0twice and
they to "host" it, and keep it headquartered in their offices.  So far, I
haven't heard one word from them (except a request for money)!

  Nu, herr zakh ein, Mendelniks! Be sure to get yourself to the Toronto
meeting October 7-9, 1994.  It will be a terrific meeting and much of the
above stuff will be discussed. For more info about THE SECOND
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE OF YIDDISH CLUBS, contact:
