Subject: Shnayd durkh dem shvartsn plonter fun mayn zel

I share my colleague Neil Jacobs' interest in the recent discussion
of daytshmerish, and concur that

  	It is important [ . . . ] to keep in mind that there are
        several issues at work here:  linguistic registers of
        individuals and speech communities, geographically-patterned
        variation, and time frame, etc. Furthermore, the issue of
        written vs. spoken language can also be important. . . .

The literary/non-literary (not precisely coterminous with
written/spoken) axis is of particular importance to the study of
daytshmerish and, more broadly, to that of the influence and place
of New High German in modern Yiddish letters. While the topic begs a
book-length discussion, I shall note here the unmarked availability
of borrowings from New High German in (especially, but not
exclusively, pre-khurbn) Yiddish literature generally, and
especially poetry.

Nor were these borrowings the exclusive prerogative of authors
wishing (nusekh early Glatshteyn) to distance themselves from Hebrew
or, conversely, to invoke or participate in the (predominantly
germanophile!) world of socialist discourse. Consider, for example,
the poet Mani Leyb (Brahinski), surely as careful a stylist as
Yiddish literature possesses. A line such as "Shnayd durkh dem
shvartsn plonter fun mayn zel"--beautiful, vintage Mani
Leyb--bespeaks neither stylistic laxness nor antipathy toward Hebrew
(or at least toward recherche elements of the Hebrew/Aramaic
component of Yiddish): what is asked to "shnayd durkh dem shvartsn
plonter fun mayn zel" is, after all, "pashtes klore."

Indeed, one might well assert that literary borrowings from New High
German such as Brahinski's are anything but unmarked. Consider, for
example, the tantalizingly complex issue of Yehoyesh's translation
of the Hebrew Scriptures. Though Bloomgarten's elevated Germanic
style owes much, as is generally acknowledged, to the sacred
penumbra of ivre-taytsh, it owes, I submit, no less to the notion of
NHG as Kultursprache.

In literary terms at least, borrowings from NHG are not only
typical, but even defining, of much of American Yiddish poetry of
broad cultural and ideological provenance.

Subject: More about Tante/Mime//Onkl/Feter

Michael Shimshoni shraybt:
:
: While all these terms *are* German kinship ones, both Vetter and
: Muhme are used less and less.  Anyhow in German Muhme was never a
: term for a cousin but  for and *aunt*.  Vetter  is exclusively used
: for  a *male* cousin, the  female term being  Base.
: for people known less intimately.

Hmmmm....I thought "Muhme" meant "cousin" since I saw it used that
way in an opera translation (and in a place where "Tante" would have
fit the meter), but those can be notoriously inaccurate. As for the
sex of "Vetter", I think I've heard "Vetterin" or some such for
"female cousin"; I don't think I've ever encountered "Base". Was
"Cousin" used for male, female, or both? (Incidentally, in Danish,
"faedre" is male cousin and "cousine" (or maybe "kusine") is "female
cousin".) Sorry if I've opened up a can of daytshmerishe worms
here....

and then points out that this dictionary gives words like
"hokhtsayt" and "broytigam" as translations for "wedding",
"bridegroom", etc.

The question is, what should we make of this?

Here's an interesting point of comparison. The same Alexander
Harkavy wrote another Yiddish dictionary, his "Yidish-English-
Hebreisher Verterbukh", published in 1925, revised in 1928 (and
reissued in 1988 by Yivo). This dictionary contains many more
Yiddish words than his earlier dictionary, since it doesn't have the
English to Yiddish section. And in the foreword he says
(transliterating his spelling): "Mit dem verk iz geven mayn kavone
tsu geben a verterbukh fun yidish, vos zol bafridign unzer oylem in
a fil greserer mos, vi di yidishe verterbikher, velkhe zaynen
aroysgegeben gevorn frier." Since the most popular Yiddish
dictionary in America at the time was his own earlier dictionary, I
would conclude that he must have meant the new dictionary to be more
complete than his earlier one.

And the interesting thing is that the newer dictionary doesn't have
the words "hokhtsayt" or "broytigam" at all.

Now, when the older dictionary translates wedding as "hokhtsayt,
khasene", giving "hokhtsayt" first, while the newer one by the same
author doesn't even list "hokhtsayt" as a Yiddish word, I have to
think there was something artificial about the style of the earlier
dictionary.

Unfortunately, Harkavy's brief introduction to the newer dictionary
doesn't address this issue. The new introduction by Dovid Katz (of
Oxford) does mention it; interestingly, the Yiddish text on the
bottom of page xxxiii says more than the English translation on page
xv. Since it's a modern opinion, I won't take time to quote it here.
If anyone knows that Harkavy did discuss it in his other writings,
and can supply a reference, I'd be interested in looking it up.

By the way, I first learned to read Yiddish from the introduction to
my parent's copy of the old Harkavy dictionary.

I'm off to Klezkamp tomorrow; zayt mir ale gezunt un shtark!
