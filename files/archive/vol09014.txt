Subject: Yiddish - Dead or Alive?

I have not been a frequent participant in this forum.  As a matter of fact
my last posting was sometime back in November.  At that time I spoke about
an Elderhostel program I was planning to attend under the auspices of the
University of Arizona at Tucson, the subject of which was "In Love With
Yiddish."  I also participated in a discussion concerning an article by
Prof. Ruth Wisse on the subject of....."is Yiddish a dying language?" 

As I read all these current scholarly comments and postulations concerning
the past, present and future of Yiddish, I get the feelilng that it is "deja
vu" all over again.  It is almost as though that discussion never took place
and I am reading the same thoughts and arguments, even by some of the same
people, that were directed toward or against Prof. Wisse.  All of this is by
way of saying I think we are guilty of obsessively studying our collective
navel.  I do not write in academic language and with respect to those who
do, I will say plainly, enough already...."hok nit kain tchynik!" Let's stop
talking ABOUT Yiddish, and just start TALKING Yiddish wherever and whenever
we can.

Subject: Hasidic Yiddish

One of the more unusual questions that I fielded over the years was in a
letter that I received about 18 months ago, from a Habad (Lubavitcher)
Hasid in Israel, who was requesting the date of Isaac Bashevis Singer's
death, so that he and fellow Bashevis-appreciators in his community might
recite Psalms on the author's yortsayt.

Subject: Haredi idish vs. Haredi literatur

Bruce Mitchell's comments on the Hadda/Vaisman discussion are very valuable,
but primarily from a sociolinguistic point of view. They do point to a
growing population, using Yiddish not only in their everyday lives, but also
to create imaginative literature.  However, behind Prof. Hadda's poorly
phrased question about who will read this literature is an assumption about
the lack of quality of this literature, one probably shared by most
Mendelyaner.  Suggestion: Khaver Mitchell should propose the three most
interestingly written stories or poems he has read during the past few years
to Prof.Hadda and her quality seeking colleagues and to other Mendelyaner.
If he can fax copies of these works, I would be happy to distribute them.

PS. Khaver Vaisman is to be congratulated on retracting his yellow
journalism claim that Prof. Hadda said anything about Yiddish being dead. 
However, the results are already evident in some of the language of the
responses (meshugas? azoi redt men vegn gelerne mentshn?). A moderator's job
is not to arouse frenzied discussion; his job is to MOD-erATE. I would hope
that Mendelyaner would follow Khaver Mitchell's tone and diction and "speak
to the thing itself".

Subject: Lebens-Fragn

Dear Mendelianer,

I would like to draw your attention to the publication of the Bund in
Tel-Aviv, named 'lebensfragn'.  I just received the May 1999 issue, number
565-566, 49th year, 28 pages.  It has several interesting articles and
colums, among others 'oyf der bikher politse'. Also a note 'tsum 110-tn
geboyrntog fun dovid hofsteyn (dem 21-tn yuni), with the poem 'ikh gloyb!' 

For those who thought Yiddish 'dead', here is a spring of life!

Details:  "lebens-fragn" aroysgegebn durch dem "arbeter ring" in Yisroel
redaktor: b. tsalevitsh, y. arturski, yitskhok luder.  Redaktsye un
administratsye:  Rkh' Kalisher 48 [48 Kalisher Str.], Tel-Oviv 65165 -
Yisroel. tel.  03-5176764. 

One pays a 'baystayer', which I think is a voluntary contribution. I sent
mine in an envelope, folded in a card. I received a receipt and the
publications (by slow mail - sometimes an issue gets lost in the mail). 

They also have a wonderfull video about the Bund, made at their latest
aniversary, for $20 (without mail).  Send in your 'baystayer' and get the
answer!

Subject: Never say die

I am glad that Janet Hadda's essay, originally published in the Jewish
Quarterly and posted in Mendele (08.153 and 08.153a), inspired such a lively
discussion (09.006, 09.009, and this issue). Although I hardly agree that
my response to Janet Hadda's article contained any "reductive, distorting
and insulting interpretation" or that I practice "yellow journalism", I
respect the strong feelings expressed by the authors of these comments.

To clarify my point I would like to reiterate two major causes of my
negative reaction to any explicit or implicit suggestion that Yiddish is
dead or dying, especially when such suggestions are coming from renowned
Yiddishists. 

The first is ethical. Traditional Jewish medical ethics did not allow to
talk about death in the presense of a patient, even in a despondent clinical
state. From the Prophet Elisha answering "Go and say to him, you will
recover, however the Lord has revealed to me that he will die" (Second Kings
8:10) to Hirsh Glick and his fellow partisans singing "Zog nit keyn mol az
du geyst tsum letsn veg", this approach was strictly endorsed by many
codifiers and interpreters of the Jewish Law. Even if the physician beleives
that the patient's death is imminent, "he should still order him: eat this
and do not eat that, drink this and do not drink that; but he should not
tell him that the end is near" (Midrash Rabbah Eccles. 5:6). Somehow (maybe
irrationally) I beleive that Yiddish now is far from being _goysesdik_. I
also beleive that the Yiddish language and culture, and all of us, who will
benefit from their continuing existence, deserve an attitude on the part of
Yiddish academics similar to one prescribed by the Midrash for the
physicians.

My second reason to dislike arguments about the death of Yiddish is
practical. In an introduction to the recently published volume "Politics of
Yiddish" (AltaMira Press, 1998) its editor Dov-Ber Kerler wittily paralleled
the situation with anti-semites and Jews equally "consuming" anti-semitic
literature to the situation with "those who continue the vexing notion of
Yiddish as a "dying" or an altogether "dead" language." He limits the arena
of "thanatological" discussions to "Yiddishists, anti-Yiddishists and
seemingly informed well-wishers of different walks of life". In reality,
there is another important group in the audience - a group that includes
philantropists and executives of various Jewish organizations. At the moment
this group is seriously concerned with problems of Jewish identity and
continuity. This group is looking for new ways and means to augment these
declining values and may be prone to beleive that Yiddish culture is one of
the answers. If appropriately advised, they may fund Yiddish classes in day
schools and Sunday schools, adult education, community events... However,
all they hear from the foremost experts - people who occupy Yididsh chairs
in many of the finest universities - is that Yiddish is dead. Very sad and
very unjust.
