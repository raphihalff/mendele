Subject: Yiddish at Columbia

The following letter to the Editor should be of interest to all readers of
Mendele. It is meant to serve as a corrective to the misinformation
published in the Forward of 7/15.  

To the Editor:

The Forward hardly serves the cause of Yiddish scholarship by failing to
check the accuracy of the wild assertions made by some of its
correspondents. Reading Charles Nydorf's letter "'Stupendous Vision' of a
Savior of Yiddish", Forward 7/14/00, one may ask if Mr. Nydorf is truly of
this world; and why his gratuitous reference to what he considers a
"non-issue" ("Yiddish culture alive or dead")?

Can he be totally ignorant of the recent appearance of Volume III of the
_Language and Culture of Ashkenazic Jewry_ , a gigantic Volume of some 400
pages, including about 180 maps, and of the fact that Volume IV of the
series is in press? That preparations for Volume Vff. are in progress?
Surely he also knows that any reputable student or scholar can be granted
access to the field-notes of the Atlas, which are housed in Butler Library,
at Columbia University in New York. I have acceded to all legitimate
requests for access that have been directed to me. Would he, too, like
access? As for the thousands of hours of taped field-recordings, NONE have
been allowed to deteriorate. Indeed the condition of each tape has been
professionally evaluated and, in order of perishability (some were recorded
as early 1959), all the tapes are now being preserved in digital format at
Columbia University's music laboratory, and are being converted to CD's as
well. Indeed, they are, even now, being incorporated into a digital
data-base in Europe, and will be made available, thereby, on the Internet to
scholars and researchers throughout the world. Mr. Nydorf misanthropic
comments hardly serve the memory of Uriel Weinreich, to whom he tries to pay
tribute, or the cause of Yugntruf of which he is "proud to be a member".  
Has he hereby given Yugntruf equal reason to be proud of him in return?

Subject: Help with Yizkor Book translation

I apologize at the start for my unfamiliarity with YIVO transliteration
standards. I have done the transliterating as best I could and I hope it
will be understood by all.

I am working on a translation of the Yiddish sections of the Radomsko
(Poland) Yizkor Book. I have come across four words that I cannot find in
Harkavy nor in Weinreich. I have also tried a German-English dictionary, but
without success. I am hoping that among the many learned Mendele subscribers
someone will be able to help me. The words are listed below and are followed
with the context in which they appear.

oiszidlungen (I have found it to mean 'to scold' or 'to curse' neither of
which is appropriate in the context of the sentence) Tsvisn di Radomsker,
velekhe zenen gevn oifn 'Hagar' biz di letste oiszidlungen habn zik gefunen:

platzvukes--a groiser teil fun di virtshaftlekhe platzvukes is gelegn in
Radomsker hent

ainern-dinst/aprovizatsie--in ainern-dinst, in der aprovilatsie iberal zenen

A sheynem dank,

Subject: yizkor book translations

Dear Mendele,
        
My name is Mark Froimowitz.  I was born in Europe after World War II and
came to the U.S. when I was 4 years old.  My first language was Yiddish
which I continued to speak at home and in yeshiva.  While I am reasonably
fluent in Yiddish, my vocabulary is more limited.  Recently, I have become
coordinator of the Kielce-Radom (south, central Poland) Special Interest
Group which puts out a genealogical journal and I have begun to translate
sections of yizkor books from Yiddish to English for the journal. However,
there are Yiddish words that are not in any of the Yiddish-English
dictionaries that I have.  I am hoping that members of this group will be
able to help me fill in the blanks.  Below are Yiddish sentences from the
yizkor book of Kielce and my translation.  I have included whole sentences
to make sure that the context is correct.

1)  Das Yiddishe leben hut zikh daw mare antvikult underen aynfloos fun di
falanizatzia-stremungen.

Here, Jewish life developed more under the influence of the [                ].

2) Das iz der nakhkumender dor foon di oysvorfen vas haben tzenynliker
kvorim oyfen bais-olum tzegdubben une beroybt di guldene tzeyn fune di
maisim.

This is the next generation of the human rejects (no exact translation
possible) who [           ] tens of graves in the cemetery and robbed the
golden teeth of the dead.

3)  Ven tzoom letzten transport fallen-tzu 600 yiden - veren zei dergentzt
fun di farblibene arbeiter un in Keltzer arbitzlager veren farshpart 1500
yiden.

When 600 Jews blunder to the last transport, they become the complement of
remaining workers and in the Kielce work camp are locked up 1500 Jews.
        
If you are able to help with with these, I have additional words
from the yizkor book of Chmielnik.  Thanking you in advance.

Subject: Searching for a few errant references

Dear Mendele'niks:

I am just finishing a bibliographic listing, and at the last moment, seem to
have some information missing.  Any assistance from you on the few
queries/lacunae below would be most appreciated.  Please respond to me
directly.  Thank you in advance!

Tcherikover, Elias (1929), Der Ohneyb fun der Yiddisher Socialistisher
Bavegung (Liberman's Tekufeh), Warsaw

   Who published the above item, and is the citation correct?

Bentwich, Norman (1960), The Social Transformation of Anglo-Jewry,
1883-1960, London

   Was this was an article? - if so, in which journal, volume and issue
   number, and date - and if not, but it was published as a book or
   pamphlet, who published it, and is the above information accurate?

Howard, Walter S (????) Jews in the Furniture Trade, 1880-1921, M.Phil
thesis, University of Southampton

   What year this was completed/published?

Samuels, Maurice (1945), Jewish Encyclopedia

   Was this ever published, and if so, who published it (city,
   publisher)?  If it WAS published, was there an entry by Rogoff, Abraham
   Meyer, on "Jewish Labor in the American Political Scene"?

   What was the volume and issue number of American Heritage 8 (1957), and
   did an article on "The Terrible Triangle Fire," by Tom Brooks, appear in
   it?

   What was the issue number of American Jewish History Vol. 82 (1994), and
   did an article by Gerd Korman on Sidney Hillman appear in it?

   What was the volume and issue number of American Scholar 18 (1949), and
   was there an article by C. A. Sherman [was this Charles A. Sherman?) on
   Sidney Hillman in it?

Thanks so much.

Subject: "Der Rebbe Mit Di Bloe Oygen"

I was recently told that there is apparently a story written by either
Sholom Asch or Sholom Aleichem, titled "Der Rebbe Mit Di Bloe Oygen" - "The
Rebbe with the Blue Eyes", which was supposedly based on a Chasidic Rebbe.
If anyone knows who wrote this story and where it can be found I would
greatly appreciate them contacting me at BinMoses@Juno.com

Thanking in Advance,
Abraham J. Heschel

Subject: yiddish learning resources

In response to Laurel Shugarman's request for Yiddish learning resources,
may I reccomend "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Learning Yiddish" by Rabbi
Benjamin Blech, and published by Alpha Books. Sorry Laurel, I'm not calling
you a klutz! I'm about half way through it at the moment and it is funny as
well as informative. The book is written in English with Romanised Yiddish
(ie like Mendele) so is easy to read if your Hebrew isn't too good. The book
also introduces quite a bit of Jewish culture, which makes for an
interesting read. The book (published this year) costs about seventeen US
dollars, and you can even order it through Amazon.com.

A glik af dir!

Subject: connecting with heritage beyond bagels/challah

In response to Laurel Shugarman (10.031):

I saw your email on Mendele.  I cannot help you with Hebrew.  But if you're
interested in Yiddish (as you must be if you subscribe to Mendele), I can
recommend a fine book (if I do say so myself), called "Learning Yiddish in
Easy Stages" by Zuckerman and Herbst.  It is for rank beginners and has much
cultural materials (songs, proverbs, conversations, etc.).

The new, revised, paperback edition (5th printing) is now available from its
publisher, the National Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Massachussetts.

Good Luck,
Marvin Zuckerman.

Subject: khotch, zhe, tau

When reading Yiddish, I often come across the words "khotch, zhe (as in zug
zhe kinderlekh), tau (tes, kometz aleph)  I'm not sure how these words are
used since they don't seem to have an exact English equivalent.  Can anyone
help?
