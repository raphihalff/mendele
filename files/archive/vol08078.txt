Subject: der bay website

How does one keep a secret today??

I wanted to work on the site and try to develop it and clean up the errors. 
Therefore I told only 3 people to check it. After reading an article in the
paper about megasearches, I put in Yiddish club. Lo and behold up comes
my
secret website. It isn't fair. Anyway, if you get a chance to do some
browsing, stop by and say hello. Please be sure to put in suggested
additions, deletions, and corrections.

Can she be surrounded by so many bigots at Harvard as to feel personally
threatened?  Maybe it is simply an irrational fear of hers.  She seems to
take on some kind of protective coloration which may not be necessary.  I
can't think of it, but I dare say Yiddish does have a word for right wing
authoritarian personalities who suffer such unbearable, irrational fear for
themselves as to escape into so cowardly position as "Identification with
the Aggressor" (in Anna Freud's apt insight); and at the same time feel
driven to violate Emil Fackenheim's suggested 614th commandment: "Thou
shalt
not afford Hitler a posthumous victory."  She knows very well that Yiddish
language and culture were direct targets for annihilation.  But.... 
Professor Wisse: "Hey!  Listen!  Good news!  They've been licked!  You
don't
have to join them!"  She does sound to me to be rather a pathetic
personality.  How thoroughly irrelevant SHE is!

From: "R. Hoberman" <rdhoberman@ccmail.sunysb.edu>
Subject: Translation in Forward

Leah Zazulyer wrote about the poet/writer Rabandranth Tagore.  "The
Victorian translators of Tagore, who were British, thought that there was a
need to "ELEVATE"  his language.  By the same token, some translators
are
still trying to elevate Yiddish along the lines of some Victorian concepts." 
The irony of it is that the Victorian translator of Tagore was: Tagore.  He
himself selected among his own poems those he thought would go over in
England, and "translated" them into acceptable style.  People who know
his
poetry in Bengali say the English versions are a pale imitation. 
Translating is always full of difficult choices, always questions of what to
sacrifice for what and whom to please.  To do a great job takes creative
genius on the level of writing great original work, at least linguisticly,
and then the next generation might not think it was such a good job after
all. I too wish the English Forward didn't translate beautiful Yiddish into
English jingles.

Subject: translation in Forward

I tend to agree with Leah [08.075]. It disturbs me to read the translations
and realize that the Yiddish worrds in mayny cases are completely
different.
In my opinion two translations should be given the literal one and the
poetic one.

Subject: translations in Mendele

Dear People,

I tried sending this message privately to Sylvia Schildt but it bounced. So
I am resending it to all of you with some alterations to the text. 

Except for an occasional exclamation or remark, I did not hear Yiddish
spoken in my childhood home.  My Lower East Side father heard and
spoke it
in his family, but my mother didn't in her Cleveland home. .  In fact, like
many other middle class Jews of German or French background, she
thought
Yiddish was a debased form of German.  Yet, when she grew very old, she
used
a lot of little Yiddish expressions which I think she learned not from my
father so much as from the Hadassah ladies she worked with.  Also, from
some
source, she got the notion that Yiddish was an " antique" form of German,
not really a debased one, which gave it a certain "cachet" in her eyes. 

I joined the Mendele mail group out of curiosity.  In the beginning I made
great efforts to translate every message, and then, every other message,
and
now, I seldom read through but one of the messages in each compilation. 
What I had to do and still must do is translate a message mentally into
German, which, alas, I do not know very well, and then imagine what the
Yiddish would sound like.  Since my father and I stopped going to Brooklyn
to visit his Yiddish-speaking sister and mother when WW II broke out, (he
had to give up his Buick because of the gas shortage) my idea of what
Yiddish sounds like is ridiculously vague and is not much aided by comics
who shpiel their jokes with New-York- Brooklyn-Yiddish intonations. 

So I appreciate it very much when people in this mail group bother to
translate what they write in Yiddish.  This helps me and maybe some other
equally ignorant subscribers very much.  As I muddled through the Yiddish
paragraphs of Ms. Schildt's message today, I was delighted to see that I
was
not mistranslating greatly what I was reading, as I corroborated what I had
done mentally with Ms. Schildt's own English paragraphs. 

One of these days I will begin making a greater effort to re-learn the
Hebrew alphabet so that I can read certain books, especially Yizkor books.
I did take some Hebrew lessons as a little girl, but I hated going to Hebrew
school since I had very little free time as it was.  I had several piano,
singing, and eurythmic dancing lessons at Juilliard School of Music, and
later weekly ballet and art lessons. When my Hebrew teacher told me that
Hebrew rarely used vowel signs, which I had learned, that was the last
straw. I rebelled, and my mother gave in. She didn't like Ansche Chesed
anyway.  She preferred Temple Emmanuel, where I was bas-mitzvahed
without
having learned anything there about Judaism or Hebrew for that matter!. 

But now I am struggling to teach myself Russian (I learned modern Greek
fairly well when I was in my thirties.)  Trying to teach myself both the
Hebrew alphabet and the Russian is rather difficult for me, as I am sure
you
can understand.  Still I wonder how my grandfather's first cousin managed
to
teach himself Bulgarian within a few months well enough so that he could
assume a professorship at Sofia University, at a time when he wasn't
permitted to teach in Odessa, where he had been educated, unless he
converted. 

So this is just to tell you, in my windy way, why I am so grateful to Ms.
Schildt for having taken pains to do her own translation.  If more people on
the list would do this, I would learn Yiddish, at least, transliterated
Yiddish much faster, and obliquely, I might even improve my knowledge of
German.

Subject: Defining Galitsyaner and Litvak

For a lecture I'm working on for Brandeis Groups, I would appreciate it if
our illustrious Mendelyaner would create defintions for _Galitsyaner_ and
_Litvak_ including the geography, the linguistics, their warfare, customs,
attitudes, etc.

I've seen the gefilte fish boundary line that Roskies reports. Any other
culinary distinctions of note? 

Thanking you in advance for helping me with my homework; this sounds
like
fun,
