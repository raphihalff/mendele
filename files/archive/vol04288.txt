Subject: Introduction

Post-WWII baby (from the left-over Jews' baby boom).  Parents Polish,
Hungarian, Carpathian, Czecheslovakian, Russian, Belgian, Roumanian
(imagine if they had an air-miles program then).

Orthodox hasidic-like early upbringing in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
Educated in mainstream yeshiva in N.Y. went on (left turn) to Brooklyn
College, YU, SUNY at Buffalo. PhD in clinical psychology, specialize in
differential diagnostics (no, don't know what that means).

Spoke only Yiddish until I was able to reach the top shelf of our
ice-box.  Read all Yiddish language books in the N.Y. Public Library Boro
Park Branch until I left for boarding yeshiva at age 14. I am fluent in
Yiddish, and hope to become fluent in English (If I can break my Internet
addiction and get some time to study).

Eek out a meager living being a psychology professor at NYU, which makes
my mother proud (but also sad, since I'm not a rabbi). I she would rather
I was a rabbi, in which case she would be really proud (but sad that I
was not a professor). My career has precious little to do with Yiddish,
and my diagnostics practice has precious little to do with Jews.

I also subscribe to Mail-Jewish and Psy-Jewish. Given my subscriptions
and occasional meals and purges, I have roughly 9 minutes left daily to
go to minyan at the local shtibl and to settle world crises with the
person in charge (my mother).

There is a term used in the Carpathian Yiddish circles "shalaten
shames."  It pertains to one who is basically a gopher, a shames who is
not even a (quasi)important shames. (No offense to our dear moderator,
who seems to wear this badge with distinction.) It may relate to an
underling whose job it is to prepare shalaten (lettuce of some sort?). My
nephew is a budding linguist in Toronto who was curious about this, and
he annoyed my mother (who, as a mother, is a linguist by definition), and
neither knows the true deriva- tion of this term.  Is there perhaps a
shalaten shames on the list who can help us with our dire family problem
before my Mexican brother and his sons get involved and make it an
International affair?

Subject: Glatshteyn, Mozart, Sholem-Aleykhem

Another translation of Yankev Glatshteyn's _Mozart_, this one by Ruth
Whitman, in her bilingual _An anthology of modern Yiddish poetry_.  New
York:  October House, 1966:

I dreamed that
the gentiles crucified Mozart
and buried him in a pauper's grave.
But the Jews made him a man of God
and blessed his memory.

I, his apostle, ran all over the world,
converting everyone I met,
and wherever I caught a Christian
I made him a Mozartian.

How wonderful is the musical testament
of this divine man!
How nailed through with song
his shining hands!
In his greatest need
all the fingers of this crucified
singer were laughing.
And in his most crying grief
he loved his neighbor's ear
more than himself.

How poor and stingy--
compared with Mozart's legacy--
is the Sermon on the Mount.

----------------------------------------

The middle stanza, specifically as it alludes to laughter through pain,
reminds me of the epitaph that Sholem-Aleykhem wrote for himself:

do ligt a id a posheter
geshribn idish-daytsh far vayber
un farn prostn folk hot er--
geven a humorist a shrayber.

dos gantse lebn oysgelakht,
geshlogn mit der velt kapores.
di gantse velt hot gut gemakht,
un er--oy vey--geven oyf tsores!

un davke demolt ven der oylem hot
gelakht, geklatsht, un fleg zikh freyen,
hot er gekrenkt--dos veys nor got--
besod, az keyner zol nit ze'en.

(Was this actually inscribed on his gravestone, can anyone say?)

Subject: More Glatshtayn

Before the Glatshtayn discussion wans, I want to share my favorite poem.
The text and translation are as they can be found in "An Anthology of
Modern Yiddish Poetry," selected and translated by Ruth Whitman, and
published by October House inc. (1966.)

"Vi Mide Baymer"

Di nakete khave hot mir getaylt
dem letzten bis fun epl.
A farshemter hot got zikh farshtelt
far an elektrish knepl.
Ich hob es gegebn a barir,
s'iz gevoyrn likhtik
tvishn mir oon ir.

Gebentsht zolstu zayn,
hob ich ir gezogt.
Kh'hob farcholomt in zich a mider

vos hobn zich  bislekhvayz genoomen zamlen
mit yeder trit oyf oondzer veg

foon yene nogoondike shtamlen,
vos zenen gevorn bateyt.
Dermonst zich?

Dermonst zich,

ober gott hot shoyn far oondz

Vi fri mir zenen gekumen,

Mir hobn tamid gefregt:

Mir hobn shoyn gehat

Oon ale mol iz er tvishn oondz

Dermonst zich?
Mir zenen gezesen oyf der erd,

Geplaplt. A pardrimlter
hot er zich tsugehert.
S'iz geven koym, okersht ersht,
s'iz zikh nokh gornit farlofn.
Vi mide baymer zenen mir
ayner in andern
shotndik arayngeshlofn.


"Like Weary Trees"

Naked Eve shared the last bite
of the apple with me.
God, bashful, disguised himself
as an electric button.
I touched it
and there was light
between her and me.

Blessings on you,
I said to her.
Wearily, with my limbs
full of first darkness,
I dreamed of a single moment
out of the treasure of those numbered days
that, with every step of the way,
slowly gathered
into pieces of time; dreamed
of those crude stammerings
that became eloquence.
Do you remember?

Do you remember
how we rose early
and came, in our newness,
but God had already prepared
everything for us?
No matter how early we came,
he came a little earlier.
We always asked:
Who was first, he or we?
We already had
a whole forest of singing birds,
strong beasts, faithful light.
And all the time he kept turning up
unexpectedly between us.

Do you remember?
We sat on the ground,
ate the first fruit of our sweat.
Prattled.  Drowsily
he listened.
It was just barely first,
nothing had yet happened.
Like weary trees,
interlaced,
shadowy we fell asleep.

Subject: Tseylem kop

A polyisher id hot zach a mol tsukrigt mit a litveshen. Hot er em gezidlt
kol mine zilzulim. Nor der litvak hot geshivign. Iz der polyisher gor
shtark in kas gevorn un aussgeshrien: "Du shvaygst? treyfener beyn
eyner! Bist doch treyf vi chazer! Host doch a tseylim in kop!" Entfert
zich der litvak gelasn: "A tseylim in kop? nu, nu! To kush mich nit in
kop."

(From Royte Pomerantsn by Immanuel Olsvanger)
