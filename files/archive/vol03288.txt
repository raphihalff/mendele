Uh, am I missing something here?  As I understand it, "taytsh" is from
"ibertaytshn", meaning the same as "iberztsn", to translate. We use
"ibertaytshn" for any form of language translation, though I would also
use "vus is der taytsh?" to mean only Hebrew->Yiddish, in the context of
learning.  (When I help my daughters with their Chumash homework, they've
learned to read the Hebrew and translate it into English on the fly.
When they're learning with me, I insist they translate it into Yiddish on
the fly, which is how it comes up. We use the Bays Yehuda chumash for
this purpose, so they can check the Yiddish if they get stuck.  But I
digress.)

Is "taytsh" derived from "daytsh"?

Subject: Rosenfeld's Prufrock

Neakh Zide asks about Isaac Rosenfeld's parody of Eliot's "The Love Song
of J. Alfred Prufrock".  The following is the version given by Gene
Bluestein in an article entitled "Prufrock-Shmufrock" in the journal
*Yiddish*, published by Queens University Press, 1987, Vol. 7, No. 1.  I
have made a few minor changes to conform to the YIVO transcription
scheme.

Nu-zhe, kum-zhe, ikh un du
Ven der ovnt shteyt unter dem himl
Vi a leymener goylem af tishebov.
Lomir geyn gikh, durkh geselekh vos dreyen zikh
Vi di bord bay dem rov.
Oyf der vant
Fun dem koshern restoran
Hengt a shmutsiker betgevant
Un vantsn tantsn karahod.  Es geyt a geroykh
fun gefilte fish un nase zokn.
Oy, Bashe, freg nit keyn kashe, a dayge dir!
Lomir oyfefenen di tir.
In tsimer vu di vayber zenen
Redt men fun Karl Marx un Lenin.

Ikh ver alt, ikh ver alt
Un der pupik vert mir kalt.
Zol ikh oyskemen di hor,
Meg ikh oyfesn a flom?
Ikh vel onton vayse hoyzn
Un shpatsirn bay dem yom.
Ikh vel hern di yam-meydn zingen Khad Gadyo.
Ikh  vel zey entfern, Borekh-abo.


It's forced in places of course, but the renditions of the "In the room ..."
and the "I grow old ..." sentences alone make the piece worth preserving.

Subject: Schmuck and Tolkien

	In a previous issue Yude Rozof asked about Schmuck in Polish. I'd
like to start round-about with my answer.  In J. R. R. Tolkien's _Hobbit_
the dragon is named Smaug, which, according to Tolkien's key in the
Silmarilion, should be pronounced /smok/ (long o).  He claims it is an
Indo-European word for serpent.  This brings me to Smo'k, the legendary
dragon that guards the Vistula at Warsaw (as represented in the municipal
coat of arms).  How far is it to assume this root meaning serpent in
Indo-European came to be a slang for penis in Yiddish?  A bit of a
stretch, but not for Freud.

Subject: Shmuchki

i don't know how shmuchkele came up, but when i first heard shmuchki (as
a verb) on radio (and thought i remembered it from yiddishisms heard in
childhood) i tried to think of a source, and easily came up with Polish
s/mia,c/kac/  (using / and , for Polish diacritics), "to soften", like
the Russian myagkiy (myahhkiy) "soft"
