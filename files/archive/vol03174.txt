i'm afraid you have me confused with someone else. languages remain
alive so long as they have a speech community that grows up speaking
them as a native language. i doubt that your singing will keep
yiddish alive, and i can assure you that mine would only make it
want to die faster... :)

btw, what i DID say is that yiddish grammar is no 'looser' than any
other. and that includes german. if you have evidence to the
contrary, i'd love to see it.

I know of no source, alive or printed, according to which "Muhme"
means "cousin" in German.  Two old-fashioned and even obsolete terms
are "Vetter" (male) and "Base" (female); modern German uses
"cousin/cousine". "Muhme" can be traced back to Middle High German
("muome") and even Old High German ("muoma") and was originally a
term of endearment for mother, and subsequently for the mother's
sister.  Around 1700, under the influence of French, the French word
"tante" replaced "Muhme". Interestingly, "tante" comes from a Latin
word for the _father's_ sister. In any case, there was no shift of
meaning you're asking about.

Subject: Daytshmerish, Yiddish, & Jewish German

The recent discussion found in Mendele concerning daytshmerish has
been interesting.  Concern over the issue of New High German
influence on Yiddish is not new, as pointed out by others in this
current discussion (citing, e.g., Max Weinreich's article from the
1930s).  Linguistically, Yiddish and German clearly have enough "in
common"--enough of a resemblance, for whatever historical
reasons--that Jews and non-Jews have long been concerned with issues
of "why A is/isn't more/less like B" (on history of Yiddish
linguistic scholarship, see Borokhov 1913, or Max Weinreich's
dissertation, recently brought out in published form thanks to Prof.
Frakes).  In some of the recent Mendele debate, there is argument
over what is "really Yiddish", what is "really" daytshmerish, etc.
It is important, I believe, to keep in mind that there are several
issues at work here:  linguistic registers of individuals and speech
communities, geographically-patterned variation, and time frame,
etc. Furthermore, the issue of written vs. spoken language can also
be important; Max Weinreich (1928, "Di yidishe shprakhforshung in
17-tn yorhundert", in *Tsaytshrift*) notes a difference in the
amount of German influence in written documents versus what must
have been the spoken Yiddish of the time.

It may also be fruitful for us to distinguish between borrowing of
New High German elements into Yiddish, versus the process of
language attrition in post-Haskole Western Yiddish.  I am scheduled
to present a paper on this point at the upcoming LSA meeting in
Boston (title of paper:  "Borrowing vs. language shift among
19th-century Yiddish speakers").  Basically, I try to use the model
of Thomason and Kaufman (1988) to distinguish between the massive
influx of New High Germanisms into Jewish speech in the 19th century
in the West vs. in the East.  In the case of Western Yiddish, Jewish
speakers' increasing use of Germanisms was part of a process of
language shift (WY > German), whereas, the daytshmerish in EY was
*borrowing*, and part of a process of language consolidation,
expansion, etc.  According to Thomason & Kaufman, language shift and
borrowing leave behind different types of identifiable linguistic
residue. I think this to be, at least to some extent, at least part
of the total picture we are all after.  A few articles of value are:
Lowenstein (1979) "The Yiddish written word in 19th century Germany"
(Leo Baeck Yearbook, 1979), Shpirn (192-6-?) "Di yidishe shprakh in
ungarn"), and Y. Matras (1991, ZDL) on Jewish German of the
"Judendoerfer".  Also:  Anton Ree's 1844 work on Jewish German
speech, discussed as well in Max Weinreich, and elsewhere.
