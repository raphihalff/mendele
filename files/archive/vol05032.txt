Subject: The meaning of 'fest'

In a recent conversation, a 10-year-old cousin of mine, whose native
language is Yiddish, referred to a certain sauce as 'a feste maykhl.' In
standard Yiddish, this would mean "a stiff food," which isn't exactly
what I'm looking for in a sauce; but from the context he plainly meant
it in a highly complimentary way--he meant it was great.

Among American yeshivishe non-Yiddish speakers, (who often pick up and
use quite a lot of Yiddish words,) 'fest' can mean strong, good, or
excellent.  I imagine the switch came about by non-Yiddish speakers
hearing 'fest' used complimentarily in reference to things in which
firmness is a desired attribute, e.g. 'a feste shtik holts.'  Thus 'feste
shikh' in standard Yiddish are stiff (presumably uncomfortable) shoes,
while in American Yeshivishese they are excellent (presumably soft)
shoes.

I've noticed this use of 'fest' by American Yiddish-speakers as well--but
until now, it was only by *non-native* speakers who picked up their
Yiddish in a yeshiva setting (with no formal instruction), and it was
often an object of ridicule among native speakers and those of us who
knew better. The cousin in question is an Israeli native speaker, and
from a khsidishe (not yeshivishe) home.  It would seem that this
yeshivishism is spreading much further than I had thought.

If by some stroke of luck someone has had the patience to bear with me
through this, my question is:  how far has this use of 'fest' spread? Has
anyone come across it in the secular Yiddish community?  Has it made it
to Israel faster than I thought, or is my cousin's usage an aberration?

Any insight would be appreciated.

Subject: Bote = bot?

As for the 'bote' in Eliyahu Juni's recent posting 'bot' in Hungarian
actually does mean a stick. I wonder if there really is a connection.

I am not a scholar in this area and will readily accept correction from
those who are.

While Yiddish and German both derive from medieval Middle High German, I
think that actually modern Standard German is considerably more
conservative in preserving older elements.  Examples of grammatical
elements that remain in Standard German and have disappeared in Yiddish
include:

1.  The simple past tense.
2.  Conjugated present and past subjunctive.
3.  The genetive case.
4.  In Lithuanian Yiddish, the dative case as well.
5.  A full system of strong and weak adjective endings.
6.  Declension of nouns (with a few remnants in Yiddish).

With respect to "stabilizing" earlier, I am not sure that "stabilizing"
has any linguistic meaning.  In any case, I think a lay native speaker of
German would have an easier time reading a 17th century German text than
a Yiddish speaker would with a similar Yiddish text.

B'sholem,

Arnie Kuzmack

Subject: The name Bessie

Howard Sage asks about the "translation" of his grandmother's name.  He
implies that she was called Bessie by English speakers [in the US].

>  I was told that the only name matching "Bessie," my
> grandmother's name, was the German/Yiddish (?) "Elsa."

> My question: could/would Elsa actually be translated as Bessie?

I'm providing some non-scholarly responses to this question.

The answer he received from officials in Vienna assumed that Bessie was a
version of the name Elisabeth, a variant of which could be Elsa or
Elsabeth in German.  A respondant in Mendele 5.031 suggested Basya or
Batya as a more likely Yiddish name connected to Bessie.

The problem is that names don't simply "translate" from one language to
another.  If his grandmother lived in a German-speaking area, she may
have been called Elsa; in coming to America, the name may have been
interpreted as Elizabeth, which might then have been abbreviated to
Bessie. (Had she come to this country at a different age, in a different
era, she might equally have chosen to be called Liz or Liza or even Betty
or Betsy.)

On the other hand, if she came from a Yiddish-speaking environs, a more
likely name may have been Basya, or even Basha.  Then again, the name
Pessie or Pesha was not an uncommon woman's Yiddish name (I'm not sure of
the derivation of that name).

Name transitions or "translations" are not always obvious, whether in
Yiddish or another language.  Aleksandr from Moskow may wish to be called
Al or Alex or Sandy or Sender if he moves to Brighton Beach, NY, but may
choose Avrum or Alon or several other options if he chooses to make
aliya.

My suggestion is that Howard Sage should take into consideration his
grandmother's social environment and cultural affiliations in determining
what her name was in "the old country."  An urban, middle class,
assimilated young Jewish woman from Vienna or Budapest is likely to have
chosen a different name from that chosen by a poor, religious woman from
a Polish shtetl.
