Subject: Yiddish books on tape

Yankl Sachs asked about Yiddish books on tape. The Jewish Public Library
in Montreal has a large collection. At one point, the National Yiddish
Book Center had announced that it would sell the recordings in the U.S.
I haven't heard anything lately. They do sell copies directly. The
collection includes entire books of material, read by native speakers.
At one point, I believe Zachary Baker had something to do with the
project.

For those planning to take advantage of the Mame-Loshn '97 early-bird
price, time is running out! Reservations have to be received by the end
of February. Prior attendees will have additional time and will receive
a flyer shortly.

Subject: Tevye's quotations (see Shul memories)

David Herskovic (6.224, 1) quotes Tevye  who quotes Rashi (in the first
of three) then challenges anyone to find the Rashi citation. Although I
know nothing of Talmudic scholarship, I suspect it's like going on a
mission to find a left-handed teacup.  Tevye was prone to make up
citations to fit his jocular mood, or even an aggressive mood to addle
his competitor in a debate.

The first of Tevye's quotations comes from the second Tevye story, "A
Boydem" (Ale Verk fun Sholem-Aleykhem, Folksfond Oysgabe, New York: Vol.
5, Gants Tevye der Milkhiker, 1918, p.51): begapoy yovoy begapoy
yeytsey, az me leygt arayn a krenk nemt men aroys kadokhes. David had
Tevye's Yiddish (mis)translation the other way around, but it sounds
just as good.

The third of Tevye's quotations comes from the same volume, but it's on
page 185 in the story entitled "Tevye Fort Keyn Erets-Yisroel".  There
he was making up a blend of syllables, some from Yiddish, that sounds
Aramaic.  He bamboozled a Jewish ignoramus who, through his money, was
trying to lord it over Tevye.

I can't find the second quotation given by David Herskovic.  Where is
it?

Subject: An onion and a feather

Regarding Mikhl Herzog's "homework" question in 6.223: "Why do German
Jews hang an onion and a feather in the _suke_?"

Onion = batzal (Hebrew)

B'tzel k'nafekha = in the shade/protection of Your wings (Divine protection
is recalled by the shelter of the sukkah).

A German Jewish friend's account of this pun once inspired us -- this
was almost ten years ago --  to attach paper wings to an onion before
hanging it in the Harvard Hillel sukkah.

Subject: Mezinke/mezhinikel

In 6.224 David Lidsky asked about a word that he transcribes as
_mezhinikel_.  Weinreich offers _mizinik_ 'youngest son; pinky' and
_mizinke_ 'youngest daughter'.  Both are from Slavic:  cf. Ukrainian
_myzynka_ 'youngest daughter'; _myzynets'_ 'youngest child; pinky';
Russian _mizinets_ 'pinky; youngest son; younger brother'.

Friend Lidsky's form is presumably an example of Litvak
hypercorrectness.  Knowing that those speakers of Lithuanian Yiddish who
manifest _sabesdiker losn_ pronounce [z], [s] etc. instead of [zh], [sh]
etc. (e.g., _fis_ for _fish_), one might assume that _mizinik_ is
dialectal for the "correct" _mizhinik_.

Such hypercorrectness can probably be found in every language. Note, for
example, English "between you and I" from speakers who feel that
"between you and me" must be wrong since they've been told that one
should say "it is I" and not "it's me."  In Polish, where there are
dialects with a phenomenon like _sabesdiker losn_ (called _mazurzenie_
from the northeastern region of Mazury), the older word for a heron,
_capla_ [tsapla], was replaced in standard Polish by the hypercorrect
form _czapla_ [chapla] (cf. Russian _tsaplia_), whence perhaps the
family name Chaplin.

Subject: New publications

Since my name has been raised in a bibliographical connection, I would
like to say that I will be glad -- on an occasional basis (as in the
past) -- to inform Mendelyaner of new publications in or about Yiddish,
as they cross my desk.  Here are two new (or newish) titles:

(1) Sutzkever, Abraham.  Laughter Beneath the Forest:  Poems from Old
and Recent Manuscripts.  Translated from the Yiddish by Barnett Zumoff;
with an introductory essay by Emanuel S. Goldsmith.  Hoboken, NJ:  KTAV
Publishing House, 1996.  xix, 179 p.  ISBN 0-88125-555-6 (sorry, I do
not have price information)  The poems, which originally appeared in
Sutzkever's book, Fun alte un yunge ksavyadn (Tel-Aviv:  1982), are in
Yiddish and English (facing pages); the introduction and translator's
preface are in English.

(2) La Rassegna Mensile di Israel, vol. 52, no. 1-2 (Gennaio-Agosto
1996) [special issue, entitled]:  Il mondo yiddish:  saggi.  A cura di
Elena Mortara Di Veroli e Laura Quercioli Mincer.  503 p., illus.
Publisher's address:  Unione delle Comunita Ebraiche italiane,
Lungotevere Sanzio 9, 00153 Roma, Italy.  The issue includes 27 essays,
19 in Italian (by both Italian and foreign scholars, including some of
the most prominent specialists in the Yiddish studies field) and 8 in
either English or French, on the following topics:  La letteratura
yiddish antica; Cultura e presenza yiddish nell'Italia rinascimentale;
La letteratura yiddish moderna in Europa e negli Stati Uniti; Ritratti
d'autore; La tragedia della Shoa; Cinema e mondo yiddish;  Incontri e
testimonianze; Situazione contemporanea:  in Francia e in Israele; Lo
