Subject: Seasonal greetings

In mendele vol. 5.113, Keyle Goodman signed off by kindly wishing all of
us a gmar khasime toyve.

Seasonal greetings usually are ksive va'khsime toyve from the beginning
of Elel (from the 15th of Ov for some) until the first night of rosh
hashone when you wish leshone toyve tikosayv vesaykhaym and the rest.
From rosh hashone by day one starts vinching a gmar khasime toyve or a
gmar tov until after yom kiper. It is still acceptable until after
hoyshane rabe.

This is based on the gemore that our cases are heard on rosh hashone
we're then put on probation for the aseres ymay chive and the sentence is
signed on yom kiper.

zol bay aykh ale megiyem veren vos ir vincht zikh alayn.

Jay Fleischer, you're in luck (sort of)!

WBFO-FM 88.7 (at the University of Buffalo) is the National Public Radio
station you're looking for.  I don't know its wattage, but you should be
able to receive it in Hogtown ("Chazershtot"??).

If you have a Web browser, you can access a partial program schedule by
keying in http://wings.buffalo.edu/services/wbfo.  Unfortunately, I
couldn't spot a listing for Leonard Nimoy Yiddish stories -- or an e-mail
address.  However, an on-line comment form is available at
http://wings.buffalo.edu/services/wbfo/comment.html.

Hope that this is of assistance.  A happy and kosher Rosh Hashana to
all!

Subject: An alt lid

I would like to find the complete words and score to an dirgeful Yiddish
song my mother sang to me in the early 30's. I just remember the first
line.

Kim tsu mir my kint, tsu mir, a nit vel ich gein tsu dir.

I believe that this song might be a mother's lament at her son's
kidnapping by a "chapper" for delivery to the Russian army under the 25
year draft of Jewish children (Little Contonists) instituted by
Nicholas I.

Subject: Yiddish software for children

For those who are looking for material in Yiddish for young children, you
are invited to download the shareware version of "Aryeh to Zebra" - a
Hebrew/English/Yiddish interactive picture dictionary for Windows.

If this sounds familiar, it's because Saul Berman has posted already a
message about it, but he asked me to do it again and correct a few typos
in the www and ftp addresses. So here it is:

If you have a graphical WWW browser check one of these:

1. http://www.execpc.com/~rtls/hebrew
2. http://shamash.nysernet.org/computers/rtls-software

If you want to use ftp, try one of these sites:

1. ftp.magic.ca  /rtls/hebrew/aryeh.zip
2. shamash.nysernet.org  /israel/computers/rtls-software

Subject: Yiddish on mendele

I have noticed a number of messages written in Yiddish transliterated
into English. I assume that this is done not from choice but from lack of
software that can deliver Yiddish through e-mail.

I have developed a Hebrew Message Viewer for reading Hebrew messages on
Compuserve (for those without Hebrew Windows). You can check it on
Compuserve Israel forum in the software library (hebmvi.zip).

If there is enough interest in this forum and if most of the readers use
Windows to read these messages, I can modify it to handle Yiddish and
send yiddish text through e-mail in an encoded form.

The viewer program is free software. For composing messages you could
either use Hebrew software (such as Hebrew Windows or Dagesh) or a
Yiddish writer that I would supply for a small registration fee.

Let me know what you think.

Subject: Shlak

I liked Zavi Beer's explanation (5.116) of _a shlok [shlak] zol dir
[dikh] trefn_ (from a falling suke cover), but there's a more likely
source in Polish _niech cie szlag trafi_ 'damn you; may the devil take
you' (literally, 'may you have an apoplectic fit [i.e., a stroke]').
Polish _szlag_ is in turn from German _Schlag_, which can also mean 'a
stroke'.

Lomir ober redn fun freylekher zakhn:  ale mendelyaner berosh mit dem
shames vintsh ikh a gezunt un zis yor.
