Subject: Forverts

Let us assume that Dan Leeson was writing from the midst of a bad
dream about a world without the _Forverts_.  I am probably repeating
some of what I posted to Mendele a few years ago, but even if one
has time to read only Chana and Yosl Mloteks' "Perl..." (every other
week), Yosl Mlotek's "In der velt fun yidish" (on alternate weeks) and
Miriam Hoffman's weekly columns (and now the occasional piece by Shikl
Fishman), the _Forverts_ is well-worth the small subscription price
($36/year in the US).

My first encounter with Yiddish was the attempt to puzzle out English
cognates in my grandmother's _Forverts_ some fifty or so years ago,
and I've been a subscriber for as long as the Mloteks have been
publishing their wonderful column (if not longer).  It's a present I
give myself every year, and I would encourage as many as possible of
the Mendele _khevre_ to do the same.  It's a much better way to
celebrate the 100th anniversary of the _Forverts_ than by reading
about it in the _(English) Forward_ or the _(Russian) Forverts_ (which
I'm doing too).  The address, for those who don't have a copy handy,
is 45 E. 33rd St., New York NY 10016. In 1966 Poland launched a
campaign to build 1000 schools in celebration of the millenium of the
Polish state.  Surely Mendele can produce at least 100 new
subscriptions to the _Forverts_ in honor of its centenary!

Subject: Forverts

I'm joining a monastery

I have not had this much guilt heaped on my since my mother told me
that it was my fault that the dinosaurs died.

With respect to the Yiddish language Forward, I haven't seen it for
years and assumed that it had been completely replaced by the English
language version.  So I said so as if it were true.

The pains inflicted in my body as a result of that faux pas will be
with me for years to come.  Someone called me a trumbenick and I had
to check to see exactly where that put me in the social scheme.  It is
2.3% of the way to being a putz!

So much for being a hoo-hah famous writer.  My first fiction story
gets published and 38 people jump on me.

I'm joining a monastery and I know exactly which one: the Abbey of New
Clairvaux in the northern California town of Vina, halfway between
Chico and Red Bluff in Tehama County.  And the reason why I have
chosen that one is that they have a resident rabbi, Charles Arian.  No
joke!!

Arian has said that it is very difficult to be an observant Jew in a
monastery because they have 7 services a day and he was davening three
times a day on top of that and going crazy from the effort.

So I will start a small Yiddish club in the Abbey of New Clairvaux and
your guilt will be unable to reach me there.

Subject: Yiddish possessive

Modern Yiddish texts indicate that the possessive in Yiddish  is
formed by adding a "samekh" to the noun without using an apostrophe.
In older writings, e.g., in Sholem Aleykhem's stories, the apostrophe
is used with the "samekh" to show possession.  Can anyone tell us
when, and why, the apostrophe was dropped?
