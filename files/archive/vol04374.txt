Subject: Expressions

[A]nother amusing direct translation of a Yiddish expression:  Sit
yourself away.

And a Latvian-immigrant acquaintance of mine, on being asked "vos hert
zikh?" sometimes answers either "kayn bris nit" or, in the absence of
mixed company, "az m'shtinkt on, hert zikh."

Be me well.

Subject: Expressions

My father, who was born in Kamionka-Strumilova and grew up in
Zamarstynow, a suburb of Lwow, (both shtetls in Galicia) used to answer
to "Vos Machst Du" with "Ich mach in di hosen," which roughly translated
means "I make in my pants."  But that seems to be more an answer to "Vi
machst du?" or "How are you doing?" and maybe that was the question.

A belated thanks to those who gave me information about Zamartynow.

Subject: Are shtrayml and sheytl diminutives?

_Dos shtrayml_ 'fur-edged hat worn by some khsidim' and _dos sheytl_
'Jewish woman's wig' look like diminutives.  Are they?  Neither _shtraym_
nor _sheyt_ appears in Weinreich's dictionary.  A dank.

Subject: Statistics of Yiddish-speakers

For statistics of speakers of Yiddish and for analysis thereof, Khaver
Zimmerman's student should consult the works of Joshua A. Fishman. The
two most recent, up-to-date and germane are the volumes he has authored:
_Reversing Language Shift_ (the chapter comparing the statuses of
Yiddish, Navajo and Spanish in the USA) and _Yiddish:Turning to Life_.
The latter is a collection of the author's essays on the sociology of
Yiddish written over the past two decades.  Both volumes are from the
early 1990s; the former published by Multilingual Matters and the latter
by D. Benjamins.

Does Miriam Isaacs also have a paper out on statistics of
Yiddish-speakers in Israel?  If she's reading, maybe she'll provide us
with some info.

This probably exhausts non-anecdotal treatment of the subject.  (Of
course, I hope I'm wrong.)

Subject: Pultusk (Poland) and the drink "bavarka"

We've had talk in Mendele about "words only my family uses," and how they
often turn out to be regionalisms.  My submittal in that category is the
term "bavarka," referring to a "hot toddy" that my mother and grandmother
prepared frequently.  It was simply very hot water spiked with an inch or
so of milk.

My mother's family is from Pultusk, a town about 60 miles due north of
Warsaw. Her Yiddish was native and fluent, but I no longer can remember
enough of it to describe it or characterize it.  In particular, her
pronunciation of Hebrew (e.g., when davnen) was quite distinctive and
like none I've heard except from her immediate family.  I'd appreciate
any comments from readers about the Yiddish from that region, and why the
Hebrew might have been so distinctive.

I've looked in vain for references to the drink bavarka, but have found
none.  Might it be a Polish word?  Anyone else use that word?

Subject: Watson fellowship, 1995-6: a request for help

I'm a newcomer to this list, and I feel somewhat self-conscious about
asking for advice when I've only posted once.  But here goes.

I've received a Watson Fellowship for 1995-6.  The Watson Foundation
awards stipends for projects during the year after graduation from
college (Caltech, in my case).  These projects must be undertaken
overseas, and they are often off-the-wall.

My project?  I plan to spend the first six months in Spain, studying how
minority languages and cultures (in particular, Gallego, Catalan, and
Vasco) are furthered and supported under Spain's autonomous region
system.  I want to focus on language education.  How are parents
encouraged, convinced, or otherwise caused to transmit a minority
language to their children--especially in a majority culture as pervasive
as Castille's?

For the second six months, I'll be in Eastern Europe (Russia, the
Ukraine, and Lithuania), investigating Yiddish education and the
language's future (yes, that old saw).  What Catalonian, Galician, or
Basque institutions can shed light on what needs to be done in order to
transmit Yiddish through the generations?  What does cultural planning in
Spain tell us about Yiddish revival in Eastern Europe?  The histories of
Spain's minority languages have more in common with that of Yiddish than
one might expect (the differences, of course, are also numerous, but
perhaps less significant).

I would greatly appreciate

	(a) any information regarding organizations in Eastern Europe
	specifically concerned with the preservation and revival of
        Yiddish culture, and in particular with Yiddish-language
        education (names, addresses, telephone numbers, would they mind
        having an ignorant Yiddishist drop in for a few days?, etc.);

	(b) any information about libhobers fun yidish in Eastern
        Europe who would be at all willing to put up a (paying) visitor
        for a couple of months;

	(c) equivalent help regarding the Spanish side of the project
	(if there's a subscriber with those interests);

	(d) any general comments about my project, advice regarding
        travel in Europe, recommendations for stops on the way;

	(e) any answers to the following question: "Which is better:
        Der Nister's 'Di Mishpokhe Mashber' or Moyshe Kulbak's 'Di
        Zelmenyaners'?" (this question has no relevance to my project,
        I'm just curious).

In short: who should I talk to? where should I go? what shouldn't I miss?

If you have any ideas, post them here if you think they're relevant,
e-mail me at zdb@cco.caltech.edu, or snail-mail me at MSC 115, Caltech,
Pasadena, California 91126-0001.

A sheynem un a hartzikn dank.

Sholem (Zack) Berger

Iker shokhakhti: Ordinarily I would have posted this in Yiddish, but I
wanted to reach as many people as possible.
