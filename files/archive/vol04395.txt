No, but it sounds like a promising beginning.

Back to the subject of Yiddish/Hebrew first names and pairings thereof,
any reason for the pairing _sholem-shakhne_?

Subject: Hagode songs

For Mikhl Herzog:

The Workmen's Circle seder Hagode is rich with Yiddish songs about
Peysakh happenings. In Yiddish translation, from the traditional Hagode
was Dayenu:

Voltn mir nor fun Mitsrayim
Gliklekh oisgeleyzt gevorn
Nor der yam zikh nit geshpoltn - Dayenu.

Volt der yam zikh shoyn geshpoltn
Nor im durkhgeyn in der trukn,
Volt undz demolt nit gegoltn - Dayenu.

Voltn mir im shoyn ariber
Nit gekent nor iberkumen,
Fertsik yor in groysn midber - Dayenu.

Voltn mir di fertsik yor shoyn
In dem midber durkhgekumen
Un keyn man dort nit gefunen - Dayenu.

Voltn mir dort man gefunen,
Nor dem shabes nit bakumen,
Un tsum Sinay nit gekumen - Dayenu.

Voltn mir tsum Sinay kumen,
Nor di toyre nit bakumen,
S'folk fun toyre nit gevorn - Dayenu.

Back in the late '30s in East Flatbush elementar shul, I remember the
first stanza we used to sing was:

Volt Yekheved nisht gevezn
Volt kayn Moishe nisht gevezn
Voltn Yidn knekht gevezn - Dayenu.

(Even Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem would tap-dance to that one,
today)

Subject: Pesakh Songs

Here's an odd little Pesakh song fragment my Bubbe used to sing:

Pesakh tsum seder bin ikh frelakh
Mayn vayb a malka, un ikh a meylakh
Mayn zun, di natsleznik, in a kurtse irmak
Un mir tantsn a hopak.

Shrayen shray ikh mit mayn gorgl
Zingn zing ikh vi an (? orgl)
Dray'n dray ikh vi a rak
Un mir gayen a hopak.

Mayn vayb is a sheyne, a glater
Fun kop biskl pyater
Koshere kinder ?  ?   ?
Heyle pupkes oys geshtelt.

I believe the tune to be a version of the hopak.  The above is from
memory. I would have to listen to the tape to glean any other words.

Subject: Petimeti

Re Dovid Braun's query (31 March) on the origin of "peti-meti", which
occurs is Sholem Aleykhem's works as a slang term for "money", the
following may be totally irrelevant but is offered for what it's worth.

"Pentimenti" is used in reference to paintings, to denote the presence or
emergence of earlier images, forms or strokes that have been changed or
painted over.  Revelations of this kind may sometimes greatly enhance the
value of an important work.  An imaginative dialectician might connect
such pentimentic enhancement with the potential for getting more money
unexpectedly. (That might be "stretching" a bit too far!)

In French, "petit-maitre" refers to a "dandy"  who dresses lavishly in
the latest or most "in-vogue" styles, perpetuating  an impression of
grandeur or, at the least, conspicuity.  One would need a good deal of
money to live up to a petit-maitre's expected standard, and perhaps the
dialectical connection in this case might be a little less implausible.

As I'm sure you would agree, I would prefer a more direct path to the
origin of "peti-meti" in Sholem-Aleykhem's time.  I hope you get better
responses than this one to your very interesting question, Chaver Braun.
