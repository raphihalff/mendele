Subject: buyze vyetchera

My mothertongue-fluency Yiddish speakers here at work
(from Poland & Russia) tell me that it means "a bad
supper". While they weren't familiar with the full
phrase as such (but liked it!), they say the ring of it
is concerned less with the culinary value of the meal,
but rather with its expected relaxing value in the
evening after a hard day's work.

Subject: Irregular plurals

1. Let me add two more non-hebraic names with a hebrew
plural suffix. They are used in the synagogue, at the
summoning to Torah reading, indicating the pledge of
the summoned. karboynim from karb/n kerbl, and
gildoynim from gildn. BTW the first one was mistaken by
Wexler 1991:43 for korbn korbones and glossed
'sacrifices, victims'.

For those who have not seen it, the full Reference is:

Yiddish - the fifteenth Slavic Language. A study of
partial language shift from Judeo-Sorbian to German. in
International Journal of Sociology of Language vol. 91
(1991) 9-150. See also reviews following immediately in
same issue.

Subject: YIVO Yi(d)dish Orthography

My wife, Gitl was recently writing up an announcement
for 'yidish-vokh' the summer retreat that yugntrug
sponsors each year (which david sherman has frequently
mentioned).  She started out writing 'Yidish-vokh' with
one 'd' as would be appropriate in YIVO orthography.

Then she decided that a commonly used yiddish word such
as 'yidish', which is commonly written with two 'd's
should be written 'yiddish', even though YIVO
orthography might dictate otherwise.

Such a commonsensical approach is, in fact, common in
transliterating other languages.  Commonly used
spellings are retained even if they might conflict with
the particular transliteration system used elsewhere in
a given article/book.

I wonder what folks think about this issue.  Should one
adopt commonly used spellings even in 'standard'
transliterated yiddish?  Or perhaps only in a subset of
writings?

Subject: Idioms

More for Elye Katz's collection:

1.  "folg mir a gang" = [it's] quite a distance (U.
Weinreich).  The distance can be temporal:  Yudl Mark's
introduction to his *Gramatik fun der yidisher
klal-shprakh* begins "Fun 1921 biz 1975 iz folg mir a
gang."

2.  "gey kakn afn yam" = approximately "go to hell."

3.  "gey kebeyne [kebeynye?] matere".  This one is a
problem for me in two ways.  First, what I give is the
way I remember the expression, and may be wildly
off--fun di kinder-yorn biz haynt iz folg mir a gang.
Second, and much more important, I have been told that
the words after "gey" are bad Slavic of one kind or
another for something like "screw your mother."  My
mother, who used the expression, came from Vilner
gubernye, and must surely have known what she was
saying.  But she was quite modest and respectable, even
prudish. Are there any other Mendelenikes whose
parents, though otherwise orntlekhe layt, used this
one?

4.  "gey veys" = who knows?  who would have predicted
this outcome?

5.  "zikh arumdreyen vi a forts in rosl" = to wander
about aimlessly

6.  "oder dray, oder draytsn [dray hundert]" : said to
(or about) someone who expresses widely disparate views
or plans of action, or is uncertain about them.

7.  "a farshlepte krenk" = a drawn-out (non-medical)
unpleasantness

8.  "a glik iz mir getrofn!" :  ironic, said in
response to a report that something supposedly good has
happened.  "The Democrats have retained control of the
Senate."  "A glik iz mir getrofn!"  As with "es bayst
mir in beytsim", the meaning is "Who cares?"

Subject: Introduction

I am a professional musician, and a past student of
german.  I have an interest in yiddish because of my
husband's slight knowledge of it, wanting to share a
bit of that heritage with our 10 year old daughter, and
because of my (not entirely fluent) knowledge of
german.  I also am interested in yiddish folk songs.
