Bob Goldberg says about 'geven' and "geveyzn':

I have noticed exactly the same distinction in my
mother-in-law's usage.  I'd been planning to ask this
question to MENDELE, in fact, but Bob beat me to it.

I've adopted the same distinction in my daily speech, and I
find it very natural in terms of the rhythm of a sentence
-- which might in fact explain the origin of the
distinction.  I don't know if the linguists & phoneticians
have a word for this, but it seems to me that in the middle
of the sentence, the word has less stress and there's more
of an incentive to "get on with it" and progress to the
meat of the sentence (that is, WHAT or WHERE were you
geven'ing).  On the other hand, if you're putting the word
at the end of the sentence (for reasons other than having
learned too much German grammar:-), then (a) you've already
covered the important stuff and explained what or where you
were gevezn'ing, and (b) you are deliberately stressing the
having-been part of the sentence for whatever reasons, so
why not give it another syllable?

Comments from the professionals?

I'd disagree. Kenehora certainly isn't a sentence or
a clause, but just an expression or fragment.  The
full expression (no longer used) would be 
"keyn ayin horo zol nisht ...", wouldn't it?

Subject: tsu-rik and d-ort

While we're on the subject of etymologies, folk or
otherwise, there are a couple that I didn't notice for a
while, but now seem obvious.  Can anyone confirm whether
the etymologies are legitimate?

1. tsurik (back, as in direction), seems to come from tsu +
   rikn (back, as in anatomy).

2. dort (there) seems to come from d + ort, "the place".
   (Actually, I first noticed this was saying to one of my
   kids who was trying to fit something into some place
   that didn't fit, "s'iz nishtu ka or't dor't".)

There are a couple in English, incidentally, that sort of
caught me by surprise when I first noticed them.
"painstaking" is, of course, pains + taking, but there's a
tendency to think of it as pain + staking, which doesn't
contribute anything to the meaning. Second, "dishevelled"
is from the French deshabille', and is dis-helleved, not at
all related to the dish.

hi melekh. of course you're right on (1)--it's not being
wrong that makes it a folk etymology. it's just that the
wrong ones are the 'cute' ones that linguists mention. but
i disagree with (2)--historical linguists (i.e. those that
worry about positing etymologies) do NOT use the same
'methodology'--they study old texts, where available, and
do comparative and internal reconstruction, a description
of which is even too tedious for *me* to subject mendele
to. there is no way their methodologies could ever come up
with sparrowgrass for asparagus or the like. and it's
exactly the methodology of looking at a single word and
hypothesizing an etymology on the basis of sound or
spelling similarity to other words that makes it a folk
etymology, whether it's right or wrong. better?
