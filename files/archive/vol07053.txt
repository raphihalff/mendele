Subject: Yiskor Bukh far Bobruisk un Umgegent

I am a beginning Yiddish student and the Coordinator of the Bobruisk Interest
Group (BIG) under the auspices of JewishGen (http://www.jewishgen.org). My 
interest in learning the Yiddish language came as a result of the search for
my ancestors, virtually all of whom are traceable to the city of Bobruisk,
Belarus or its surrounding shtetlekh (as far back as the great-great-
grandparent level, or about 1830).  I was lucky enough to be able to find and
purchase a copy of the "Yiskor Bukh Far Bobruisk un Umgegent" published in
Israel in 1967 and written mostly in Yiddish with some Hebrew. The book is 872
pages and contains virtually the collective memory of the town's Jewish
community.

I have begun translating the Yiddish version of the 107-page historical
monograph by Yehuda Slutzky (deceased).  I have gotten far enough (23 pages)
into it to realize that the project deserves the loving attention of a
professional, ideally a Bobruisk native.   I have not yet polled the members
of my group for an exact dollar amount, but some have indicated a willingness
to contribute limited funding for professionally translating this and other
segments.  Of particular interest to me are chapters about the fate of the
Jews in Parichi, a town south of Bobruisk, during the nazi terror.  These
efforts will have direct consequences on the research efforts of Anglophone
Bobruisker researchers in my group as well as yielding specific ancestral data
for some members. 

Our intention is to publish the translated segments on our Bobruisk website
at http://www.jewishgen.org/shtetlinks/bobruisk/bobyskor.html.  As far as I
know, this will be the first time the information will be made available to
a wide audience of Anglophone Jewish researchers 

If you are a Bobruisker or descendant learned in Yiddish and/or are interested
in helping us, please contact me at mophandl@txdirect.net

Subject: M. Litvin and Simkhe Shvarts

M. Litvin: Further to Al Grand's question about M. Litvin (7.050) and Iosif
Vaisman's reply (7.051), the Leksikon Fun Der Nayer Yidisher Literatur (vol.
5, 1963) gives the following:

Mordkhe Litvin was born in Shavel [Shiauliai] Lithuania in 1903. He studied
humanities at Kovno University and moved to Paris in 1939. During the Nazi
occupation he was a partisan in the French Resistance in southern France.
Returning to Paris after the war he was active in left-wing cultural
institutions and in their publications.  A number of works of translation are
referenced, until 1962.  He also wrote under the pseudonyms M. Valder and M.
Dinkes.

I presume that additional and more up-to-date information might be available
from Bibliotheque Medem in Paris, http://www.col.fr/yiddish/medem.htm
 
Simkhe Shvarts: Iosif Vaisman can refer to vol. 8 (1981) of the Leksikon for
an informative article, with references, about Simkhe Shvarts, apparently a
highly creative man. A link of sorts with this publication is his 
dramatization of Mendele's "Fishke der Krumer".  He was born in Podeloy,
Romania in 1900 and died in Buenos Aires on August 14, 1974.  He established
and operated a theater in Tshernovits (1930 - 1935), for which he wrote the
material, directed, and acted.  He went to Paris in 1936 where he studied 
theater and sculpture, and established a successful marionette theater.  Moved
to Buenos Aires in 1952.  A noteworthy sculpture is evidently his memorial to
the fallen fighters for Israel, in the B. A. cemetry.

Subject: Neither Aleykhem, nor Sforim is the writer's last name

In the _Yiddish Vinkl_ in the English _Forward_ (May 9, 1997, p. 11) its
compiler wrote:  "Recently [the writers] Seforim and Aleichem [double sic]
have been publicly honored."  

The first is a reference to the World Wide Web site named after our own
_Mendele_ whose name we proudly bear on our masthead.  Of course, the name is
not Seforim -- the plural of the Hebrew "seyfer" [book] is sforim, without an
/e/, and  it is not the writer's last name (nor is "moykher" his middle name
(Mendele M. Sforim?...).  

The second is a reference to the fact that a section of East 33rd Street in
New York City where the Yiddish _Forverts_ is being published, was named
Sholem Aleykhem Place.

"Aleykhem," too, is not a last name.  While "Sholem" was the writer's given
name, he chose to combine his first name with the popular and traditional
expression of greeting _Sholem Aleykhem  [peace be unto you].

The combined  pen name "Sholem Aleykhem" carried a singular, deeply emotional
meaning, a genuine message of fellowship between the writer and his readers,
an ever-present warm-hearted reaching out, and a symbolic gesture of a strong
and friendly handshake.

His readers, the Jewish masses all over the world, responded with a joyous
sense of _"aleykhem sholem"_, the traditional and popular   answer to the
greeting sholem aleykhem, and embraced him with unbounded love and respect.
 When he died in New York in 1916 at the age of 57, he was mourned all over
the Jewish world as if he were a beloved member of one's own family.

His name therefore was, and will forever be, the combined Sholem Aleykhem,
and not a falsely, unjustly truncated "Aleykhem" that dishonors the essential
meaning of his choice of pen name symbolizing the intimate bond between
him and his readers.

Subject: az me lebt

I recall an article (published some 15 years ago) by Leslie Fiedler in the New
York Review of Books describing, among other things, being busted for
smoking/possessing pot at a party in his home. The essay began with the
expression "Az me lebt...," which Fiedler translated roughly as "If you live,
sooner or later everything happens..." It certainly seemed witty, jewishly
ironic and apropos, and close to Ellen Prince's interpretation of the phrase.
(I think the charges against Fiedler were dropped, but obviously Buffalo
was--and is--a hot spot to be in.)

Subject: Inappropriate usage

Regarding Mirl Schonhaut Hirshan's posting in Vol. 7.050:
Much as the author of the posting did not intend to offend, I think we'd do
well not to give a _hekhsher_ to the Nazi term _Judenrein_ (whether spelled
Judenreyn_ or _Yudenreyn_) by applying it as she did. I wasn't spared the
wrath of my listeners some years ago when I made the mistake of using the
same word in a similarly inappropriate way. We needn't look for new contexts
in which to apply it.

Subject: Yiddish translations of Verlaine

Sholem aleykhem!
I come into the conversation belatedly re. Verlaine translated into Yiddish,
so what I write may be redundant.  Surely you know of the work of M. Litvin,
_Frantseyzishe poezye:  Iberzetsungen un komentarn_ (Paris:  1968 and 1986),
2 vol.  In the 1986 volume, on pp. 85-87, Litvin presents 3 variant
translations of Verlaine's poem, "Il pleure dans mon coeur."

Subject: "boychikl"

In zayn diskusiye vegn libe terminen dermont a. yosif ross (7.051-7) dos vort
"boychik". A vaytere farklenerung, "boychikl" is a vunderbarer, ober efsher
eyntziker, bayshpil vi azoy yiddish zapt arayn elementn fun di arumike shprakhn

endearment, A. Joseph Ross (7.051-7) mentioned "boychik". A further diminutive,
"boychikl" is a wonderful, perhaps unique, example of how Yiddish absorbs
elements of the surrounding languages and creates a new word with more charm
than the original! It took "boy" from English, the Russian (Slav?) diminutive,
"chik" and added the a diminutive "l" to make it sound Yiddish --- is there
another language that can so easily adopt itself to three different languages
at once? Are there other examples of such three-language words used in the
various countries that Jews settled in?

Az men lebt...My preferred take on this is the very common "What goes around
comes around."  If you've seen it once, you'll see it again.

From: Hugh Denman <h_denman@maier.vol.at>
Subject: Lithuanian & Yiddish
 
With reference to David Herskovic's query concerning the relationship between
Lithuanian and Yiddish [7.052:9], I believe that, in fact, a small number of
Lithuanian words were indeed borrowed into the varieties of Yiddish spoken on
Lithuanian-language territory and I recall reading brief lists of such items
somewhere [I'm sorry I can't cite examples off-hand]. However, such lexical
items do not seem ever to have gained more than very local acceptance. It is
important to realise that Lithuanian was never spoken in an area much bigger
than the tiny, newly independent republic on the Baltic and that until the
Romantic revival of the nineteenth century its social status was extremely low
and its use confined to rural areas, whereas the Grand Duchy was a vast
political entity extending from the Dvina to the mouth of the Dnepr whose
official administative language was not Lithuanian but a type of Belorussian
and within whose confines there were far more speakers of Belorussian and
Ukrainian than speakers of Lithuanian. Incidentally, it is something of an
over-simplification to say that the Grand Duchy was "absorbed" by Poland under
the terms of the Union of Lublin (1st July 1569) since inter alia the dynasty
at that time was of Lithuanian origin.

As one of the few Brits who participate in Mendele, I might add that the
"Jewish Chronicle" is not only just about the oldest of all surviving Jewish
periodicals, but still one of the best. However, alas, when it comes to
commenting on Yiddish almost any fool feels qualifed to rush in where angels
fear to tread and in this respect the "JC" is unfortunately no exception.
