Subject: Der ershter yidishist

In Louis Fridhandler's post, Sholem-Aleykhem's Zhargon standards, of
Mendele Vol. 4.274, he mentions that "Sholem-Aleykhem seems to have been
one of the first modern Yiddishists (before there was such a word) to see
a complete language in _Zhargon_."

This brings to mind one of the forgotten, though undoubtedly vital,
characters in the history of the Yiddish language, namely Yehoyshue
Lifshits. Lifshits was a writer for kol mevasser, the first Yiddish
newspaper to appear in Russia (Oct. 11, 1862) and was best known for his
articles defending and promoting the Yiddish language. One of these
articles, di fir klasn (km, issues 21, 23-25, 1863; also reprinted in
Shikl Fishman's, Never Say Die, p. 259-265), laid the basic arguments in
defense of Yiddish in the face of its many detractors. In di fir klasn,
Lifshits conceived that Yiddish (mame-loshn) must be the language in
which the Jewish people should be educated (at the time, the Jewish
intelligentsia promoted either Russian or German for the purpose of
education) and that the language should be built up to accomodate
culturally and scientifically elevated terms in order to enlighten a
people that no one else wanted to enlighten.

Unlike the vast majority of19th century maskilim, Lifshits felt that
Yiddish had, just as any other language, unlimited potential and that any
limitation it did have was due only to lack of proper cultivation. In the
introduction to his Russian-Yiddish Dictionary (1869, and the first to
appear), he wrote that his initial proposals (late 1850's) on behalf of
Yiddish language and modern mass culture in Yiddish were at first laughed
at by his maskilic peers. One of those who mocked him was none other than
Aleksander Tsederboym, editor and publisher of kol mevasser, who pinched
Lifshits' idea of publishing a Yiddish newspaper to prop up his
economically flagging Hebrew weekly, ha-meylits.

It might also be added that Lifshits is said to have convinced mendele
moykher sforim to begin writing in Yiddish (dos kleyne mentshele was
first serialized in km). If that hadn't happened, we just might be
subscribers to an e-journal named shloymele.

Subject: Prakes

One of numerous regional designations for 'stuffed cabbage'. Others are
of the the _holeptses_, and _geviklte kroyt_ variety and, for those who
love a mystery, at some locations in Southwestern Poland, the word is
[ta:belekh].

Subject: Fedder-Fraynt

Mayne tayere Fedder-Fraynt:

Our project is coming along very nicely.  We have folks from all over the
US, Europe, Israel, Australia, and other far-away places.  I have six
Fedder-Fraynt myself, and all seem like, close, dear friends (sounds
corny, but it's true).  The Fedder-Fraynt project sprang from my own
Fedder-Fraynt.

Being a Fedder-Fraynt hardly takes any time at all.  Your only investment
is writing a few lines of Yiddish 3-4 times a year.  The dividends are
terrific! How about some of you khevre signing up as Fedder-Fraynt.  We
have only one from New York City (shem zakh!), _nobody_ from Canada.  I
know there are trillions of Yiddisher shrayber there. C'mon neighbors!

This is our line-up so far:

Sergey Berkner(Russia)             Leon Janis (Alaska)
Minna Blayer (New York)            Kaylee Goodman (California)
Sheldon Clare (Pennsylvania)       Robin Sasson (South Africa)
Raphael Finkel (Kentucky)          Abram Fleischman (Latvia)
Katrin Hellerstein (Pennsylvania)  Lisa-Leah Jenschke (Ohio)
Kirsten Hoge (England)             Chaja Arolowisch (Lativia)
Jonathon Einhorn (Ohio)            Penina Finkel (Kentucky)
Celia Jones (Australia)            Debra Halper Biasca (Colorado)
Jay Lee (California)               Colleen McCallum (Ohio)
Rosa Linger (Latvia)               Brian Zumhagen (California)
Jason Payne (Ohio)                 Elliot Gertel (Californis)
Rose Shlecker (California)         [unmatched at this time]
Seymour Shaffner (New Jersey)      Pamela Abramson (California)
Aviva Tal (Israel)                 Sean Martin (Ohio)
Anna Verschichik (Estonia)         Matthew Daily (Ohio)
Leah Zazulyer (New York)           Harvey Friedman (Arizona)
Francesca Zuniga (California) unmatched at this time
                              Tranliteration only

Well, now you see our great little group.  Great, but we need, especially
for overseas.  I have an 8 Year-old who would like to correspond with
another youngster about her age.  You non-participators out there don't
know what you're missing. Please! Zayt azay gut.......lozt heren fun
aykh.
