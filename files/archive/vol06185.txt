Subject: Uriel Weinreich

Mikhl Herzog (vol 6.183) wonders whether he was alone in his shocked
reaction to the posting of Gilad Gevaryahu (vol. 6.182) about the
Weinreich dictionary. Let me assure Mikhl and you others that I was
upset by those remarks too.

Uriel Weinreich, olevasholem, my teacher in graduate school and later my
friend, was a man of recognized scholarship in the field of linguistics
as well as the narrower topic of Yiddish linguistics. I also remember
him as a kind person who always felt concern for his family, friends,
and students. Whatever the shortcomings of his dictionary, he hoped to
handle them in a new edition. Alas, his early death, which dismayed us
all even though it was expected, ended his work on that and other
projects. I find, with others, that the Weinreich dictionary is
lexicographcally superior to the other Yiddish-English dictionaries;
however, I sometimes have to go elsewhere, usually Harkavy, to look up
this or that word. When I do, I miss Weinreich's more sophisticated
treatment of gender and other grammatical details.

I would like to believe that Gilad was just too hasty in dashing off his
remarks. Of course, I hardly need say that he has every right to discuss
somone's work on its own merits.

Subject: More on the dictionary

Mr. Herzog missed the pun when I said "What a shvantz" since this word
doesn't exist in the dictionary. No offense was intended. Whatever
happened to the sense of humor of native English speakers?  I still
think that it is a shande that the dictionary does not include many body
parts, body functions and other "offensive" words. A language is dead if
you cannot go to the bathroom with it, nor is it alive if you cannot
cuss in it. It was certainly a big mistake to censor the language. Jews
suffered enough from censors throughout history and we should not do it
to ourselves. However, I am not sure if it was Mr. Weinreich himself who
did it, as the dictionary came out posthumously.

Der Otzar fun der Yiddish Schprach by Nahum Stutchkoff included many of
the censored words with an asterisk (*). Some of the banned words (in
English and in Yiddish) are: tuches, shvantz, shmuck. drek u.s.v.

Even if Mr. Weinreich wanted to censor "improper" words, a word like
"shvantz" which has both kosher and vulgar meanings, it should have been
included with at least the kosher meaning of "tail".

Mikhl Herzog is quite right in attacking the gross verbal assault on
Uriel Weinreich.  The person who complained that th dictionary doesn't
list the word "shvants" ought to compile his own yiddish anatomical
dicktionary--or do something equally useful.   I wont hold my breath.

I chose to respond by ignoring it and simply explaining how useful
Weinreich's textbook and dictonary have been to me and by hinting, in my
discussion of "anthology", that the only useful critique is one that
adds something instead of simply gripes.  compiling a dictionary is a
back-breaking corvee and a thankless one--perhaps more so in Yiddish
than in other languages, whose speakers are more open to standardization
and who have more respect for their native tongues.

over the years my first copy of the Weinreich became so dilapidated that
I recently bought a new one--same for my Harkavy.  I believe that speaks
volumes.  and whatever quality my translations have, I could not have
done them without both dictionaries--and a host of others as well.  I
sometimes read around in the Weinreich just to imbibe words that i've
forgotten or haven't come across or that I didn't realize have a
different meaning than their cognates in other languages (e.g. German
"Belletristik" means "belles lettres"--i.e. "prose and poetry";  Yiddish
"beletristik" means "fiction" only).

No one is required to believe everything they read in a lexicon--but if
people who claim they care about Yiddish would stop sniping at the
movers and shakers and do something productive, then I could take them
far more seriously.  For instance: it would be wonderful if th Groyser
Verterbukh could be completed.  Considering the low quality of the
Yiddish in some (many?) mendele postings,  a thorough reading of
Weinrich's College Yiddish would do those subscribers a world of good.
I constantly consult the paradigms in that textbook whenever I write
anything in Yiddish--if only to shove anyway the German paradigms that
keep forcing themselves on me.

If you'd like to see a really mediocre dictionary, try the American
Heritage Dictionary, and if you'd like to see a really sloppy book of
grammar try the famous standard Duden (Deutsche Grammatik).

If your Yiddish is so excellent that you don't need Weinreich's
dictionary when reading a modern Yiddish novel, then I'm highly envious
of you.  But I have a sneaking suspicion that certain subscribers don't
need the Weinrich dictionary because they seldom read Yiddish.

which is too bad, because there are some truly wonderful things in
Yiddish literature--not that they'd ever find out.

Andrew Cassel asked [6.183] about the production quality of Harkavy's
1928 dictionary.  Well, I don't know about his, but I have no problem
with blurry print in my copy.  I don't have the recent reprinting, I
have my grandfather's original 1928 edition

Incidentally, my mother got quite nostalgic when I told her about Al
Grand's question about "Patch zikh in tokhes un shray 'bravo'!"  She
certainly remembers her mother saying it.  She didn't quite remember
saying it herself.  I thought we both said it to my 9-year-old niece a
month or so ago, but she didn't remember that either.
