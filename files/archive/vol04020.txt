Subject: Introduction

I'm new--my name is Frank Boches. I hail originally from Boston
(Dorchester area) and now live in Baltimore. I'm at the Univ. of MD three
days a week. I'm interested in finding out if anyone knows where I can
get hold of an old 78 record by Al Jolson entitled "Ich fuhr aheim." The
beginning goes something like this: Ich fuhr aheim, ich fuhr aheim. zu
Palestine, zu Palestine, ungepluchten yahren dadadadada, a Yid bin ich
geboren voren dadada, Ich fuhr aheim, ich fuhr aheaim. And the rest
escapes me. Also, anyone from the old Dorchester area--Franklin Field,
Nightingale Street Shul, Beth El Hebrew? Shanen dank.

Does anyone know if there's any connection between the Germanic root
and the Hungarian?

Subject: Political culture and frumkayt of NY Jews

In thinking about Paul Ritterband's question regarding the relative
frumkayt of Brooklyn Jews versus Bronx Jews I would agree with your
assumptions.  While I do not know how to tap into the circulations of the
various Yiddish newspapers, it occured to me that the Bronx had a number
of Jewish worker housing projects/coops - the Amalgamated Houses and the
Sholem Aleichem Houses near Sedgwick Ave. and the Coops on Allerton Ave.
All three home to many Yiddish speakers. This housing stock is in the
midst of Jewish neighborhoods that remain more or less intact to this
day.  I am not sure if Brooklyn fostered similar worker coops though from
personal experience Brighton Beach in Brooklyn - Russian emigres aside -
appeared to have more secular Jews than religious.

Subject: Yiddish Comics: Corrections and additions

Mendelniks:

I humbly stand corrected on a variety of details re: Jewish comics:

1) I did indeed inadvertantly omit Art Spiegelman's monumental work
"Maus". My mistake.

2) The Marvel series was in fact, the "Invaders" and not the "Avengers"
and it was published in 1976 not1986.

3) I also left out the wonderful work of Ben Katchor whose Yiddish named
character "Julius Knipl" features numerous insightful Yiddishisms and
Yiddish cultural allusions. "Knipl" is a weekly feature in the New York's
Village Voice and has been anthologized under the title "Cheap Novelties
The Pleasures of Urban Decay" (Penguin 1991) . He also created a
sequential art series in the English Forward called "Jews of New York"
after Spiegelman completed his "Maus" series.

This will teach me to write responses at 3:00 a.m.

Subject: Yiddish Comix, nokh a mol

I was very interested in Pavel Miladinovic-Cernoch's posting on the Will
Eisner "Opmakh mit got" comic.  Think I may have missed a further posting
on this subject, but would appreciate address of German bookstore where
this can be obtained, Yiddish and comics being among my favorite
recreations. Was this recently published?  If so, it could probably be
obtained from the publisher: Lambiek, Kerkstraat 78, 1017 GN
Amsterdam--the best comics shop in Europe, if not the world.  Also, on
comics in Yiddish, good article "Abie the Agent, Gimpl The Matchmaker,
Berl Schliemazel, et al., by John Appel, in *NEMO--The Classic Comics
Library*, no. 28, Dec., 1987.  Does anyone know of any plans to reprint
*Gimpl Beynish Der Shadkhan* or other of the fascinating sounding Yiddish
comic strips of Samuel Zagat?

Subject: Kinship terms

To: Shleyme Axelrod

You ask if there is any information on etymology of German Enkel. I
thought I would raise the question in general of kinship terminology.
There are a lot of cognates which have different meanings in Yiddish and
German. One thing is for sure, that Enkel and Onkel are definitely not
related.

Vetter means cousin in German, whereas the corresponding Yiddish word
means uncle. In older German the word for uncle was Oheim, hence also
Dutch oom, (and Afrikaans "Oom Paul Kruger"). Muomme was a medieval
formula for aunt in German, Onkel and Tante, from French, ousted the
older terms. At one point the Germans seriously thought that "Deutsch",
which actually means "vernacular" was not a suitable language for
cultured speech, and there was a francophile movement which brought the
words into German. As we all know in the last century among many Jews
there was a corresponding germanophile movement, hence all those
daytshmerizms (but that's a complex issue beyond the scope of this
message, what with 19th century notions of "pure" languages)

Anyway, in Yiddish we now have the word Tante for aunt alongside
mume/mime.

I read a beautiful book, which I really *loved* called Stefanesti, about
a Romanian shteytl with that name. It's an ethnography done after the
town Jews had been dispersed during and after WWII. The terms they used
for cousin were plemenek and plemenitse. Conservative aunts were
addressed by nephews and nieces as mime, whereas more assimilated ones
were addressed as tante.

To come to the final point of what has become, I see, a collection of
anecdotes is: where else in the Yiddish language do plemenek and
plemenitse occur? By the way, I believe the town used "tote-mome" loshn,
and were moving towards bilingual full dominance of Romanian.

I can't resist one more shtikele: their word for Romanian gentiles (the
way we discussed fonye a little while back) was: Vulekh!
