Subject: Error-free yidish

I'd like to clarify something about my request for correct Yidish in
Mendele. It's not standard Yidish I'm looking for - I can cope with
dialectic variations in usage and orthography, and I imagine we all enjoy
them and learn from them. It's just gross errors of grammar and syntax
that I'd like eliminated, if possible, and I think that's what Zellig
Bach's proposal aimed to do, no more.

Subject: Hebraicization

Dovid Braun and Arre Komar have discussed Hebraicization in Yiddish and
discuss its presence in religious or academic discourse. I'm not a formal
scholar, but I've done a lot of reading about the presence of the
loshn-koydesh component in Yiddish. I can't overlook what I read once
about Glikl Haml's Zikhroynes, that the vocabulary used was about 30%
words from loshn-koydesh. I've found in reading Western Yiddish, older
and more current alike, that the language does indeed seem to use much
more loshn-koydesh vocabulary. I would guess that this can be explained
by the fact that cryptonyms needed to be used in order not to be
understood by gentiles. Die Reste des Juedisch-Deutschen contains scads
of loshn-koydesh words that never went East.

This raises the question of whether cryptonymic jargon phrases can be
called "Yiddish". If we see that these forms start carrying over into
everyday speech, I'd see a case for it, which would explain Glikl's
usage. I remember words like "ferkhileft" and countless other words now
not used by speakers from Central and Eastern Yiddish, which she used
routinely. "Ferkhileft" is perhaps not a good example, since the whole
method of money-lending related to this word no longer exists, but, trust
me, you see words like "shoufel", which Mendelyanern Marion Aptroot
pointed out to me could have gone into Dutch through thieves' argot,
which contained a lot of this crypto-language that existed up till World
War II.  An interesting trade-jargon made up of crypto-Hebrew words was used by
the cattle-traders of Alsace/SW Germany/Switzerland.

To bring this long message back to a focus, I'm trying to say that "low"
context words of Hebrew/Aramaic origin are very plentiful and not at all
literary or religious, and probably came into the Yiddish language to
prevent Germanic Gentiles from understanding Yiddish conversations.
Resorting to Hebrew/Aramaic cryptonyms was simply not necessary further
East, where the H.-A. component is smaller. Catholic and Eastern Orthodox
Poles couldn't necessarily understand German any more easily than Hebrew.

Subject: tshepn

[Mottel Lakin wrote in vol. 4.208:]

>I find no such word in Weinreich.

Tshepen (no sch!) is certainly in Weinreich: "bother, touch, handle,
tamper with" tshepen zikh (tsu): "badger, bother pick on, annoy, bully."
I'm sure the various other words which Mottel listed are also in
Weinreich.  I doubt the origin suggested: tzepeetsa does not sound enough
like tshepn, first of all.  Second of all Yiddish has absorbed relatively
few words from Russian at all thanks to the restrictions on residence
imposed by the pale of settlement.  The principal Slavic languages which
influenced the development of Yiddish were as I recall from reading
Czech, Polish, Ukrainian, and Bellorussian.  I've listed them in
chronological order reflecting the pattern of Jewish migration east.

From what I understand, although I do not speak Slavic languages, Polish
has been by far the dominant Slavic language in its contributions to
Yiddish; Jewish migration east was accomplished under the political
auspices of the Polish-Lithuanian empire, thus the preeminence of Polish.
It is noteworthy that modern Yiddish preserves original stress patterns
of old Polish pronunciation.  Again though I am not a speaker of Slavic
languages, my friends who speak Russian have impressed on me the
remarkable closeness of this language group. That is, Polish is much
closer to Russian than Yiddish is to Icelandic or German is to English.
Thus it seems possible that the Russian source suggested for the Yiddish
tshepen is _related_ to the actual source word in another Slavic language
from which the Yiddish word may be derived.  I turn further discussion
over to the Slavicists.

Subject: Re: Tshepen

I found it hard to believe that Weinreich did not have this common and
tamevdik word.  Lo and behold, on page 202, second column, a little more
than half way down:

tshepen: touch, handle; bother; badger.
t' zikh (tsu): tamper with, bother, pick on, annoy, bully.
