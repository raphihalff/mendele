Subject: Introduction

I grew up in Munich; relax - I am Italian; I cannot help to notice how
much Yiddish resembles the Bavarian dialect, more so than high-German.
Since I attended the Volkschule and was immersed in that dialect many
years ago, I couldn't help notice the phonetic resemblance.  Anyone else
can relate to that or give me some feedback?  I find it utterly
delightlful being able to understand so much Yiddish, I almost feel right
at home! <g>

Subject: Introduction; Jewish film

My name is Jonathan Decter and I am writing to introduce myself to
mendele. I will be starting a PhD program at JTS next year in Medieval
Jewish Studies but am primarily writing about my current place of work,
which I am trying to bring into the world of modern telecommunications. I
work at the National Center for Jewish Film which is a unique
archive/distribution center for films of Jewish content.  I imagine a
number of you are familiar with us and our work already.  The Center was
established 18 years ago to restore a collection of about 40 Yiddish
feature films. The Center is now the largest archive of Jewish film
material outside of Israel.  We distribute films and videos and have lots
of information on the material and the people who made it.  For more info
on any of this, please respond.

Also, we are always looking for relevant film material and information
concerning it.  If you have any film rotting away, of Jewish rituals,
holidays, Israel, etc., we'd love to know about it.

Subject: Shabbatai Zvi

The query about Shabbatai Zvi in Yiddish literature -- has anyone
mentioned Isaac Bashevis Singer's novel, "Satan in Goray" (translated by
Jacob Sloan, pub. by Avon, 1966).  Now out of print, but I've found
copies in libraries and used bookstore.  Originally published in Warsaw
in 1933, I think.  The Yiddish is very difficult.  The translation is
good, although Seth Wolitz has written an essay on the Yiddish text, to
the detriment of the translation.

Subject: Shlimazl

How can anyone doubt that shlimazl, however that be correctly spelled in
German, was a borrowing from a Jewish language--the word "mazl" is
undeniably of Hebrew origin, and would hardly have been taken from German
into Yiddish?  It is also a colloquial Dutch word (mazzel), meaning good
luck, doubtless also from Western Yiddish.  Incidentely, do any of the
Dutch speakers out there know of a book about Yiddish influences in the
Dutch language?

Subject: shlemiel and shlimazl

Yitzhak Kertesz refers to Mark Devlin's "Chuzpe, Schlamassel, Schlemiel"
and says:

> what is your proof that the last two were borrowed Y>G and not G>Y?

Am I missing something here?  shlim+mazl=shlimazl.  "shlim" could be
German or Yiddish, meaning "bad", but "mazl" is unquestionably Yiddish
(from Hebrew), not German.  And shlemiel is from the Hebrew shlumi'el
(ben tsurishadday), one of the Bnai Yisroel tribal princes in the
Chumash.  How could either of these gone G>Y?

Subject: shlemiel/shlimazl

In mendele 4.031 Yitzhak Kertesz questions the direction of borrowing of
shlemiel and shlimazl between Yiddish and German.

My understanding of the etymology of shlimazl is shlim + mazl, i.e., a
person with bad luck.  Since the second element of this word is of Hebrew
origin, it's pretty clear that the borrowing was from Yiddish to German,
not the other way around.  Similarly, I think that shlemiel is somehow
related to the Hebrew name shlumiel, leading to the same conclusion for
this word.

When I studied German in college, I remember reading a book or story (I
can't recall which) containing the following quote: "Bist du meschugge,
Mensch?"  Since meshuge, too, is a Yiddish word of Hebrew origin, I
inferred that there was a small but significant level of borrowing from
Yiddish into German, most likely as a result of the sizeable prewar
population of Jews in Germany who were more assimilated into the
mainstream culture, where they would have the potential to affect the
language.  Similarly, any good Polish dictionary also contains a small
number of words obviously derived from Yiddish, which I assume got there
via the same mechanism.

Subject: Shlemiel, shlemazel, gonif, khilek

The Yiddish roots of shlemazel seem clear in the last syllable, Mazel,
however the first syllable, shlim, is clearly of germanic origin,
although it is also a perfectly good Yiddish word. Hence overall I would
rate shlemazel as Yiddish to german rather than contrarywise.

Shlemiel iz eppis an andere zakh. I was always puzzled by the name of the
classic work of von Chamisso, "Peter Schlemihl", an early Faustian
legend. There was nothing particularly Jewish about it. Could anyone shed
light on the relationship, if any, to the current Yiddish (and German)
usage of the word?

Another Yiddish intrusion into German to be noted is found reasonably
commonly in Austrian pulp detective fiction and slang: Gonif.
