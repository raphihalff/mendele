Subject: Weinreich's phrase book

In reply to Rick Turkel's irate response to Al Grand's discussion
of the piece on the 'Say It in Yiddish' book -- you really have to
see the book! It HAS to be described as 'witty'! Yes, there were
street signs in Yiddish and all the other things you mention, but
that's NOT what this book is about. This book is a *tourist's* 
phrase book -- and gives the Yiddish equivalents of what you'd 
find in a tourist's phrase book for Paris or Rome. I can't find
my copy now but it's got things like what you say to the custom's
official, what you say to the traffic court judge, how you buy 
airplane tickets -- a million things that NO ONE ever said or had
to say in Yiddish. It's really very funny and I'm sure it was 
written with that as the goal. Take a look!

Subject: Weinreich's phrase book

I salute Rick Turkel for his gutsy and intelligent verdict on the author of
the Weinreich phrase book essay which Rick says he has never read and, what's
more, never intends to read.  "The author of this piece should be excoriated"
exclaims Rick.  Right on!  What this web site needs is more fair-minded and
clear thinking subscribers like Rick Turkel who have the courage to rend the
air with their resolute and penetrating judgments without resorting to the
absurdity of reading the piece in the first place.

Subject: Uriel and B. Weinreich's phrasebook

The "humorous" article in Civilization was not funny, but ridiculous. 
No, an ignorant  insult to the World of Yiddish.

The author of that article has already apologized to B. Weinreich.

Sincerely, 
Mordkhe Schaechter

Subject: National Yiddish Book Center

Itsik Goldenberg (7.024) condemns my display of ignorance and ill-will with
regard to the NYBC.  At least the second half of this charge is untrue.  I am 
a paying member of the organization and have derived great benefit from its
discount-book programs for students (through which I've amassed the bulk of my
Yiddish library) and reliable bibliographies, as well as from its helpful and
scholarly staff.  As I emphasized, the organization's concrete and undeniably
successful efforts to save Yiddish books cannot be gainsaid.  The organization
-- with Aaron Lansky as its leader--has earned for itself an honored place.

What I complained about in my post was the NYBC's arrogating to itself the 
title of savior of the Yiddish language and culture entire.  It is not doing 
that, pace its propaganda, cannot do that with its present program, and 
doesn't in my opinion have the correct approach in any case.  I do not deny 
the value of its present cultural activities, nor their popularity--I merely 
deny their applicability to our current problem, the dearth of secular 
Yiddish-speakers. The problem is not an easy one and no one is doing the 
right things to solve it at the moment.  There's a strong probability it can't 
be solved.  But making exaggerated claims (and replacing Yiddish with English 
as the language of a so-called Yiddish Culture) doesn't help matters either.
