Subject: rekude potash and "der yid vos hot khorev gemakht" ...

This is in response to two entries in vol 13.006.

In volume 2 of the Anthology of Yiddish Literature (Hyman Bass, ed;
Congress for Yiddish Culture, pub, 1976), you can find a photo of Rekude
Potash and three poems by her.  There is no other biographical
information there, however.  This book was popular and should be fairly
easy to find online or at one of several Yiddish book venues.

The story, "der yid vos hot khorev gemakht dem templ," written by Avrom
Reyzen, can be found in "From our Yiddish Literature," published 1983 in
Israel by the World Council for Yiddish and Jewish Culture. Chava
Turniansky was the editor.  I'm pretty sure that you can find it
elsewhere as well, e.g., in collected works volumes.

Hope this helps.

Subject: Re: Rikuda Potash

Since people seem to be interested, here are some more details about Rikuda
Potash: she was born in Czestochowa, Poland in 1906, began publishing Polish
poetry in her teens and Yiddish poetry in the aftermath of the 1918 Lemberg
pogrom.  In 1924 she moved to Lodz, married the poet and writer Khayim-Leyb
Fuks and had a daughter, and was active in the vibrant local Yiddish
cultural scene.  Potash immigrated to Palestine in 1934, where her brother
Mordecai Narkis was Director of the Bezalel Art School Museum.  She lived
and worked in Jerusalem until her death in 1965, and was a participant in
the remarkable artistic and poetic culture of the city in the 1930s and
1940s.  Her personal and artistic relationship with the major painter
Mordecai Ardon was especially significant for both artists (an article on
this relationship is forthcoming in the Jerusalem journal "Et-Mol").
Potash's daughter now lives in the US; other family members live in Israel.
Potash published three volumes of poetry in her lifetime: "Vint Oyf
Klavishn" (Lodz 1934), "Fun Kidron Tol" (London 1952) and "Moyled Iber
Timna" (Jerusalem 1960). A collected volume of poems, "Lider," was published
posthumously in Tel-Aviv (1967). A volume of her short prose sketches, "In
Geslekh fun Yerusholayim," appeared in 1968.  Her modernist poetry is quite
remarkable, shifting as it does between cultures, centuries and continents.
As far as I know, my (rather literal) translations of her poetry are the
first.  At least five of her extremely interesting short stories have been
translated; they are published, with a biographical note (which is not
entirely accurate), in "Found Treasures: Stories by Yiddish Women Writers"
(1994, Ontario: Second Story Press).  The discussion of her work in my
forthcoming book (twhich will appear in English and Hebrew versions) deals
with some aspects of the poetry she wrote in Jerusalem.

I hope this will spark enthusiasm for this unique poet.  My current work
focuses on her European poetry; I would be grateful for any comments,
suggestions etc. that  fellow Mendelyaners might have.  [Note: I will be
away from e-mail between the afternoon of Dec. 26 and Jan. 10]

Subject: Re: Jews and the Spanish Civil War

In Mendele Vol 13 number 7 H. Srebrnik writes:

I had some material on the Botwin company in my article "Salud di heldn:
Jewish Communist Activity in London on Behalf of the Spanish Republic,"
Michigan Academician 16, 3 (1984): 371-381.
Henry Srebrnik

Look into the Pakn Treger (The magazine of the National Yiddish Book Center)
Fall 1997 Number 26.  There's an article titled, "Troublemakers" that deals
with Jewish veterans of the Spanish Civil War.

Subject: A Yiddish translation question

The following query appeared on another list dealign with Judaica - but
clearly this is the list to get an answer!  Please reply to Mr. Schine
directly.


Arieh Lebowitz

From: Robert Schine  schine@middlebury.edu

In a letter I am translating, there is a verb of which I can make no sense
in the context.  It is not in Weinreich's dictionary, and there is no copy
of Yudel Mark's dictionary in this valley in Vermont:

..... zollstu mir glaych entfern un mir fun alles OISROIBEN.

From the context, in which a brother is begging his sister in America to write
back, I'd expect a verb meaning "to report," but "oisroiben" looks like German
"ausrauben", to rob or plunder.

 I'd be grateful for some help.
