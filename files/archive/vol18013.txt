Subject: amatshiner parkhes

With reference to Kalman Weiser's query about "amatshiner parches"
[18.012:2], I think there is a fair chance that the locality concerned is
Mszczonâ‰¤w, 45 km SW of Warsaw, which is often called either Amshenev or
Amshinov in Yiddish.

Subject: terminology for female genitalia

My name is Elissa and I am a freelance journalist in the New York area.

I am currently researching a piece about Yiddish words for female
genitalia, as well as issues of female modesty in Yiddish culture over the
20th century.

I have a few questions I would love feedback on.

What were the terms used in your households? How were they used?

Also, what and how did grandmothers and mothers refer to female genitalia?

What level of modesty was exhibited by non-religious Yiddish speakers when
discussing this?

Any stories on this topic would be greatly appreciated.

Best,

Elissa Avery
