Subject: Introduction

I am writing to introduce myself. I am currently a PhD candidate at Brandeis
studying both Hebrew and Yiddish literature. I spent two summers at the YIVO
institute. I study Yiddish at Harvard with Ruth Wisse and Marcus Mosley. I
have also studied with Avram Novestern and David Roskies. My specific area of
interest is late 19c Hebrew and Yiddish literature written in E. Europe. I am
looking forward to participating in Mendele.

Subject: Izi Kharik

a hartsikn yasher-koyekh shaya mitelmanen, ershtens far di vunderlikhe sheyne
lider izi khariks, un tsveytns far undz dermonen -- un nokh mit aza shtokh --
vegn a tragishn kapitel fun di geshikhte undzere.

Izi Kharik's lyricism and that (literally) deadly prose of Der Shtern.  I
suspect that a lot of us on Mendele had our hearts broken long ago over this
dreadful and even worse shameful period; now comes Shaya Mitelman to do it
all over again.  But if after heartbreak comes a deeper understanding,
makhtese.  And for that understanding what we need is what we outside
Stalinist Europe have never had, a _full_ account of what Jewish life was in
those years.  I hope that the Mendelistn who are in a position to provide the
necessary will be unstinting in the matter.

More: if a minute fraction of the money spent on "Holocaust" extravaganzas
were devoted to the publication and worldwide distribution of the largely
unknown Yiddish literature of post-1917 Russia (and for good measure the
better-known but unavailable Yiddish literature of interwar Poland), _then_
we'd have a monument worthy of the name.  That takes leadership and I doubt
whether since Joshua's time there has ever been a Jewish leadership that has
not consisted largely of fools and knaves.  But I wander.

CANTOS ACERCA DE CANTOS
Para que habre aprendido a componer canciones,
no me bastaba con la inquietud del viento?
Ven cabeza mia, tonta y agobiada,
voy a acunarte como a un ninio.

Tu padre no sabia nada de poesia,
leia dificultosamente letra a letra;
hubieras podido ser como el, un simple zapatero
huesudo, sano y sencillo.

Y cuando la maniana se atragantara de colores
y el viento hamacara tu casita,
cantarias como el, trabajando,
sin darte cuenta tu mismo...

Y andarias ligero, con miembros cansados,
y siempre llevarias despejada la cabeza,
para que habras aprendido a componer canciones,
cabeza mia, criatura inquieta!


NOVEDADES GOLPEAN LOS VIDRIOS...
Novedades golpean cada maniana los vidrios;
arrojo afuera mis dos inquietas manos
y que en alguna parte ya arde otro pais
estoy listo a escuchar confiado.

El corazon comienza a echar fuego;
siento que un tiron me arranca de mi casa;
en cada plaza roja vuelve a hablarnos Lenin
y cada plaza roja hierve y llama...

De nuevo esta ardiendo el horizonte.
Levanto mi cabeza iluminada, y la llevo.
El calor empuja; el clima es de fiesta.
Y asi todas las noche y cada dia nuevo...
                                                          enero, 1925


SOBRE LA TIERRA
Coloquen cuanta mas carga sobre mi nuca;
tal vez apriete un poco mas los dientes,
pero cuanto sea que carguen voy a decir: -Es poco!
Y por pesado que sea, voy a gritar: -Mas!

Que hacer si me siento ligero
y cualquier tarea me resulta digna.
Necesito cantar, me pongo de pie y canto,
y, mojada de rocio, me responde la Via Lactea.

Creo que toda una vida podria andar sobre la tierra
con el primer rocio y la juventud sobre los labios,
y cuando se me haga pesado... pero como puede hacerseme pesado
si energias juveniles manan todavia y manan.

Subject: Yiddish in Canada

David Sherman's highly informative discussion of Yiddish in Canada in V. 
8.025-1 revived my interest in a project needing to be finished. 

While David's information concerned the total population, my interest is in
the key people in the non-khasidik community. With very rare exceptions, the
contact between the Haredi and the non-khasidik community is zero--when we
refer to interest in Yiddish literature, music or theater. 

If one were to deal solely with the group who are the Mendelyaner type,
non-Haredi, then how many key people are there in Canada who are keenly
fostering Yiddish? Using the definition of key people in Yiddish clubs,
Yiddish teachers, Klezmer band leaders, Yiddish radio announcers and
translators and Yiddish performers, my Canadian database shows 267. 

In a conversation with Phil Givens o"h several years ago, he felt that given
my definition there would probably be well under 1000. When current mailings
are sent to Yiddish key contacts, there is not one list, but as many as four.
These total around 1000. In my opinion a central clearinghouse needs to be
developed for the Canadian Yiddish community. 

Addresses, phone numbers and e-mail access are important data to be
centralized. Mailings should be sent at least yearly and preferably
semi-annually. This can be in the form of a small newsletter or even a postal
card with return address requested for those who no longer reside there. 

With a very small community in the East Coast islands, there is essentially
none until one approaches Montreal. Here is where the Westward migration
begins. Montreal was the center of Yiddish speakers and the Yiddish cultural
center of Canada. The move has been Westward and now the Toronto Jewish
community outnumbers Montreal. The movement seems to have bypassed Winnipeg
and the smaller communities in the West and instead is moving to Vancouver. 

It is hoped with the new leadership that there will be an effort to fulfill
Given's plan to have a good database of the key people in the Canadian
Yiddish community.

Subject: Yiddish in Israel

Re: Yiddish in Israel Vol 08.026

I would like to object against Sylvia Schildt's suggestion to have 1500
mendelyaner write protest E-mail to the Israeli Knesset, demanding Yiddish
instruction in Israeli schools.  It seems to me a political issue and not a
literary or linguistical one.  We might protest against the plans of the
Sholom Aleichem Memorial Foundation to bring out a 25 volumes Sholem Aleichem
Library in English translation at a time that we don't even have a dictionary
containing all words used by Sholem Aleichem or against the fact that the
Penn Un. on line dictionary was closed down because of the copyright on the
EYYED.  By the way, what is the E-mail address of the Knesset?

Subject: pejoratives

Last week I called a friend to ask if he could recommend an electrician.  His
reply was 'kh'ob a gite elektrishn, a shvartse, er arbet far landn
elektrisiti in er's nisht tayer'. Had it been an Indian he probably would
have said 'an idniyaner'. However, had it been a white Englishman he may have
said nothing or simply 'a goy' since I find the use of goy is often used to
mean a chap or a fellow. Someone recommending a good builder might say 'kh'ob
a gite goy' rather than 'a gite bilder'. 

Goyte on the other hand is mostly used for cleaning ladies. Goytes are traded
and swapped; a good goyte is one who does under the fridge and the couch and
leaves no water marks in the kitchen and bathroom while a geferlekhe goyte is
one who never turns up, doesn't dust the top of the doors and has the khitspe
to tell you on erev paysekh that falls on Good Friday that she has to go to
church. Where the goyte knows she is being referred to in this way the term
araylis is sometimes used, which though anatomically meaningless is the
feminine of orel. Orel and araylis are used for goy/goyte in the same way
that shokher is used for shvartse. 

A true geferlekhe goyte, or yidene for that matter, like the one who won't
let you on the airline with excess baggage or won't fit you in for an
emergency appointment at the doctor's surgery is known as a klafte, makhsayfe
or reshante. 

A shikse in English or Yiddish implies commonness as in 'a proste shikse' or
has sexual connotations. If a friend were to tell me 'ikh bin gezesn leybn a
shikse ofn ereplan' I would take it to mean an attractive young girl rather
than an old hag. But if you hired a woman architect or solicitor then I think
you would say simply a fro rather than anything fancy. 

But we needn't look for pejoratives to our references to non-jews. The use
of frenk for a sphardi is deeply insulting in any language but unfortunately
is widespread. I have no idea where the word comes from but it is on the
offense level of referring to a black man as a spade. 

Another term I find offensive is 'a farkalekhte' for a senile person.  Again
I know not the source of the word but it is always used with a derisory tone.
My father uses 'over ibotel' which translates roughly as a goner, and
although perhaps not ideal is still kinder especially because of its Mishnaic
source.

Subject: Muselman

This is a quotation from a Swedish book, "Utvald att leva" ("Chosen to
live"), Bonniers 1996, page 268, written by Jerzy Einhorn, born in 1925 at
Czestochowa, Poland, Yiddish-speaking from birth: 

"Some are worse off, the worst ones are called Muzelmans in the camp -
prisoners who due to malnutrion or other causes cannot go on anylonger, who
resign, don't wash up in the mornings, don't mend their clothes. We know that
a muzelman will die soon. The term is derived from a similar expression in
yiddish - _a miser man_ - and has nothing to do with muslims." 

Einhorn writes this in connection with his memories from the Hasag-Pelcery
Camp where he was a prisoner between June 1943 and January 1945. I don't know
what his explanation is worth, but I cannot see that this interpretation has
been mentioned here before.

Subject: Stuffed K'neidlach

In response to Howard Aronson's query about Kneidlach stuffed with something
sweet my family have a Yom-Tov tradition of kneidlach with cinnamon and sugar
inside.  They are quite large and the family calls them 'bombs'.  I think
this may also have originated in Lithuania.  My Zaide o''h used to have his
bombs roasted in the oven before being put in the chicken soup.

Subject: "Der Amerikaner" weekly

Dear People,
   
In 1941, a few years before his death, Gregor Zvi Belkowsky, who was my
grandfather's first cousin, wrote to my grandfather, saying, in part, that he
was compiling a book concerning his life and Zionist activities.

(Gregor was educated in Odessa, taught law in Bulgaria, was a lawyer in St.
Petersburg and wrote several books and articles on law. Although he had a
falling-out with Herzl over the Uganda question, he remained an ardent and
active Zionist, for which he was arrested several times.  In 1924, he escaped
exile by getting himself deported to Israel (then Palestine) in 1924, where
he became a municipal court judge in Tel-Aviv.) 

Gregor wanted my grandfather, Dr. Isidor Belkowsky, to find an article for
him that was published in the "weekly review in Yiddish, under the name of
"Der Amerikaner', published in New York , 77 Bowery, Telephone: Canal
6-7200."  The article might have been called "The Jubilee of Professor Zvi
Belkowsky,"  but Gregor Zvi was not certain when it appeared.  He thought it
might have been in October or November of 1940. He remarked (with some
gleeful pride), that "it was the 17th article published about [his] jubilee
in this country [Palestine?] and Bulgaria." 

I have been told by Rachelle Rubinstein, archivist at WZO, that there was no
such article in Gregor's archive there, so I am asking in this forum whether
anyone knows where the microfilms or the original issues of "Der Amerikaner"
might be found.
