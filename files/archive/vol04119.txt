Subject: Introduction

I am a third generation American, whos parents left the Jewish ghetto of
Boston for the suburbs of New York.  Also left Yiddish behind and rarely
used what little they did know.

For some reason not quite known to me (but it seems to have a political
root) I've always had some interest in Yiddish.  Studied German in high
school, the closest thing offered  (and besides my sister was doing
French, and I didn't want to do what my sister was doing, (no way)) and
by the time I left college I was reasonably bad in it.  Wrote occasional
letters to my grandpa (from Poland) in German and he answered in the
same.  Studied Yiddish briefly at Gratz College in Philadelphia, with an
interesting melange of people who could read it fluently from their
Hebrew studies, but didn't understand a word, people who couldn't read
but knew a lot of phrases from their childhood but mixed it with so much
"Yinglish" that it was incomprehenisible to most and then me who
understood the lion's share due to my german knowledge, but I couldn't
read a word (never studied Hebrew.)

I then moved to Amsterdam and studied Dutch, intensively.  So now what
little Yiddish I was learning is trashed, my German is seriously
compromised and spoken with a Netherlandish accent. Go figure.  I also
play clarinet but not nearly well enough to do any serious Klezmer. Would
like to meet people in the New Haven area to actually pursue the spoken
and written part of Yiddish, so that I can add that too to may array of
confused languages.   Wouldn't mind jamming with some equally bad klezmer
musicians as well.

Mark (Motl) Aronson

P.S.  I'm totally new to the Internet and email as well.  Learning this
language as I go along too.  Wish me luck.

Subject: "Az der bubbe vot gehat.."

In 4.118, Zellig Bach analyses Steven Pinker's transcription:

	Az der bubbe vot gehat baytzim vot zie geven mein zayde

in great detail, finding evidence in the spelling of a Central Yiddish
dialect (loosely and ungrammatically recorded).

Clearly, Pinker is unaware of the YIVO conventions and is employing an
ad-hoc romanization, based on phonetics and influenced by German
spelling.  But I would argue against the CY classification.  The spelling
"mein" for "mayn" is Germanic and indicates Pinker's choice for a
romanization of the "ay" diphthong.  Therefore, I think it probable that
when he uses the "ay" spelling, he intends it to represent something
else--presumably the "ey" diphthong, but rendered according to *English*
phonetics.  Thus, in a YIVO-like transcription he would have written (I
believe):

	Az d[i] bube vo[l]t gehat beytsim, vo[l]t zi geven mayn zeyde.

This is consistent with Northeastern Yiddish, except for the sub-
stitution of "bube" for "bobe".  This last consideration would seem to
indicate a Southeastern dialect (except that "mayn" would tend to be
drawled, as "ma:n", but that detail could easily have been overlooked
under the weight of the German cognate).  So I vote for SE.

On a related note, if the original source actually had "di bobe",
shouldn't it have had "der zeyde", instead of "mayn zeyde"?  In general,
under what circumstances do Yiddish speakers use the definite article,
rather than the possessive pronoun, or *both* ("di mame mayne")?

Subject: As der bubbe vot gehat...

I stopped reading Mendele a while back  because I was sick of the
grammarians. Visions of correctniks with rulers in their hands hovering
over me and my barely legible scrawl crept into my head.

Today I decided to give it another try and, boy, things are getting
worse. Poor Pinker, the MIT linguist, gets slammed for gender errors,
romanisms, germanisms, you-name-it-isms. All because of a few words in
Yiddish about grandmothers, grandfathers and balls. A shande, I tell you.

Now there's talk of a "Correct Yiddish" for Mendele contributors. I say
it's time for a schism: Let those whose only joy is gerunds, past tenses,
flogging others and answering such questions as "does anal retentive have
a hyphen" form one group. The rest of us can be on our merry way as
language free spirits, literature enjoyers, joke tellers. So, what do you
say?

Subject: Workshop on Yiddish in the Computer Age

On Sunday, October 9, as part of the Second International Conference of
Yiddish Clubs, I will be leading a workshop titled "Yiddish in the
Computer Age".

I will be describing some of the many different ways in which Yiddish
Language and Culture has adapted to computer technology. I will be
demonstrating a Yiddish word processing system using WordPerfect, talking
about other software which can be used for Yiddish, and introducing the
workshop members to the idea of the Internet; in particular to the
Mendele list.

We will be connecting live to the Internet, as part of the workshop, and
accessing some issues of Mendele that have some interesting content.

If anyone has any suggestions for the workshop or would like to send a
salutation or message to anyone at the workshop, please reply before next
weekend.

Thank you for your help.
