Re: Scott Meyer's query
The Yiddish song played on the YouTube video is "Dos yidishe lid," sung by
Mordechai  Hershman (1888-1940). It is over 7 minutes long.

The rest of the soundtrack is largely comprised of music from the Kol
Nidre service (Eli Eli), as well as music from Simchas Torah, etc.

I hope this helps.

Subject: R. Shimen

In Lesson 24 of "College Yiddish," Rambam's famous Eight-Stepped Ladder of
Tsedakah is attributed to R. Shimen.

Can anyone explain who is this R. Shimon and why does the textbook
attribute the teaching to him?

The lesson begins on page 224 of the textbook:

"Mit iber tsvey toyznt yor tsurik hot in erets-yisroel gelebt a groyser
yidisher lerer.
Geheysn hot er R. Shimen....."

Thanks,
Fegl Timna

Subject: tshipik

Could anyone inform me of the meaning of the word "tshipik"?  My mother,
who came from Pinsk, used this word, smiling, when she saw her small grand
daughters sporting a hair style with a curl clasped by a bow or clip.
Recently, reading a memoir in Yiddish by a writer who also hailed from
Pinsk, I again encountered this word.  She described her aunts, at a
festive family dinner, all dressed up with "tshipiks" in their sheitels.

Many thanks,
Sylvia Liff

Subject: Yiddish in the University

Can anyone tell me the earliest reference of when and where Yiddish was
first taught at an American university?

A sheynem dank,
Henry Sapoznik

[Moderator's note: As far as I am aware, the first for-credit courses in
Yiddish were
taught by Max Weinreich at City College, NY, in 1947. The brochure
"Deutsch, Polnisch
oder Jiddisch?" by Germano-Judaeus, which was published during the German
occupation of Poland in World War I, translates an article from the
"Varshever tageblat"
(17 February 1916). According to the article, a Yiddish language course
was introduced
at Columbia University that year - the first such course at an American
university. "The
well-known Professor Margullis" was appointed to teach the course.]

Subject:  kusher

This word reminds me of  "kutsher." which is the driver of a horse-drawn
taxi or coachman.  The Harkavi includes it but not Weinreich.

Subject: Jewish names used on early sound recordings
Date: April 10

I am doing research on early sound recordings (1890s-1920s) and their
relationship to ethnicity and race. Many of the songs and skits of this
period play on ethnic and racial stereotypes, including the use of certain
names to specify identity. I have a question about the Jewish names that
were used on these early sound recording. By far the most common name
assigned to Jews in recordings about Jews is Cohen. I assume the name was
used
because few, if any, non-Jews would have the name Cohen. *Can anybody
offer any other reason why the name Cohen might have been used to
designate Jewishness?*

I also have a question about names used in recordings by Jews. It seems
the two most popular names the authors employed were Mendel and
Yente/Yenta. Yente/Yenta makes sense since it is associated with a gossip
or busybody. "The Online Etymology Dictionary" states that Yenta/ Yente is
a "'gossip, busybody,' 1923, from Yente Telebende, comic strip gossip in
1920s-1930s writing of Yiddish newspaper humorist B.
Kovner (pen-name of Jacob Adler) in the 'Jewish Daily Forward.' It was a
common Yiddish fem. proper name, alt, from Yentl and said to be ult, form
It. gentile 'kind, gentle,' earlier 'noble, high-born.'" I assume that the
association predates Kovner's use since the Yiddish recordings employ the
name Yente/ Yenta at least as far back as 1916.
*My questions are: Does anybody have any information about when
Yente/Yenta became associated with a gossip and busybody? Does anybody
know whether there is a similar association with Mendel?*


Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Eric Byron
