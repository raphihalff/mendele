Subject: European Jewry

your question is far from elementary--in fact, it's very
controversial! the official weinreichian story is that jews migrated
from the northeast of france into the german rhineland, from where
they spread throughout german-speaking territory and ultimately east
to slavic/baltic-speaking territory. then there is a more recent
(and, imho, more plausible) story argued by bob king that they came
up into bavaria from the south, then moved east. (hopefully, bob
will tell us the details himself and correct me if i'm wrong). oh,
there's also a farkakte theory put forth by arthur koestler about
mass conversions to judaism of the khazars, but, so far as i know,
there is not one shred of linguistic evidence for it and all the
linguistic evidence imaginable against it.

re the 'european' genes in great evidence among european jews, my
own personal hunch, which i have no direct evidence for, is that it
was primarily men who did the migrating, taking local wives into
their communities after migration. this would explain why such basic
mother-child terms in eastern yiddish are from slavic, e.g. tate,
bobe, zeyde. (max weinreich notices this with some embarrassment and
suggests jewish children got them from slavic maids. this would be
the world's first known instance of maids having an impact on their
masters' language. besides, how many jews had maids?) furthermore,
we know that it was entirely male migration in the case of the jews
of india, and yet these communities have managed to keep a strictly
jewish identity to the present day--so we know it's possible.
furthermore, this is a very common pattern in many other groups,
e.g. norsemen settling iceland, who apparently stopped off in
ireland and took irish wives. furthermore, it would suggest a
motivation for the word order changes in eastern yiddish (almost
identical to the changes in icelandic!), but that's more than you
want to know. finally, this would also show us that the
well-attested exogamic inclinations of jewish men is not of recent
vintage. (tee hee, just kidding. well, sorta kidding...)

the only alternative hypothesis that comes to mind is much less
plausible, imho, i.e. massive instances of rape of jewish women by
non-jews. of course, this sort of thing is attested in the
african-american community but what i know of the social structure
of the european jewish community is totally different--jews were
never slaves of europeans and did not typically live in their houses
as servants and concubines. (free association: in the early '60s,
when malcolm x visited brooklyn college, some fool in the audience
asked why he persisted in calling himself black when in fact he was
very light-skinned. malcolm x replied: 'just because your
great-great-grandfather raped my great-great-grandmother, it doesn't
make me any less black.') btw, note that, if it were jewish men
impregnating weinreich's slavic maids in large numbers, the
offspring would have been largely raised as slavs, not jews, and
thus couldn't account for the genetic makeup of today's european
jews.

in any event, i personally find your questions fascinating and far
from elementary! perhaps someday genetic studies will give us some
answers...

Subject: Purim in Rome

Can any mendeleniks suggest an interesting shul in Rome where Purim
could be celebrated.  I expect to be in Italy during the week of Feb
21, and would like to experience the Italo-Yiddishe way for Purim.
If there are "better" shuls in Venice or Florence, please advise.
Thank you.

Subject: Khazars

Ted Steinberg's question about the origins of East European Jewry
reminds me of a dilemma I had after reading Arthur Koestler's book
The Thirteenth Tribe. I re ad it while I was in high school and I
thought Koestler presented an interesti ng case but I could not
understand why the Jews of Eastern Europe spoke Yiddish instead of
Khazarian (I assume that was the name of their language).  Koestler
never really addressed this issue.  Upon further reflection, and
after reading another book on the subject by Dunlop, I came to the
conclusion that Koestler's entire theory was bunk.

PS - I am no authority on Russian history but was there not also a
"Judaizing" sect in Russian during the 16th or 17th century.

Birnbaum's "Yiddish: A Survey and a Grammar" has a pretty nice list,
pages 276 - 281. It organized by type of vowel change, instead of
alphabetically, but pages 284 - 286 have an alphabetical index of
the sort you're looking for.

Birnbaum doesn't say anything explicitly about comprehensiveness,
but he's got a lot of interesting dialect forms, as well as other
forms that aren't familiar to me.

His transliteration is rather hard to get used to, but if you look
at the Yiddish rather than the transliteration, it's pretty clear.
