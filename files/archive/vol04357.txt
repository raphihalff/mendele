Subject: Amusing translations of Yiddish idioms

I enjoyed very much Dovid Braun's final wish (4.355), "Be me well and
strong."

I've gotten into the same habit, learned from a very Litvish,
American-born uncle who is fluent in Yiddish.  He used to (and still
does) say things like "What makes a Jew?" or "What hears itself?" for
"How are you?" and "Know I what?" when he didn't have a clue. Also, "And
is my soul a raisin?" when he felt he was being treated with less than
the appropriate level of respect.

Has anyone else encountered this?  Is it done only with questions?
Inquiring minds want to know.

Subject: Another bi-lingual coincidence

Anent the Hebrew-Yiddish puzzle, many years ago I learned a
Spanish-Yiddish sentence which made sense in each language - if one
allowed for a little poetic license.  The Spanish sentence is: Aqui esta
una mesa?  Which means: Where is a table?  The Yiddish sentence is: A key
est un a meser. A cow eats without a knife.

Subject: Poet and poem?

In preparation for a program in Yiddish at his senior residence, my
father, who is 99? years old, is trying to find the name of the poet and
the balance of the poem of the following. (Please forgive the lack of
knowledge of standard transliteration usage.)

	Nit keyn farbetene, aleyn gekumen
	Take an oreme ober dokh a mume
	Orem iz nisht gut, orem iz nisht gut
	Tu lomir zich nit shemen mit aygen blut

A dank aykh ale.

Subject: How many Mendelniks?

I note with satisfaction the improved last page of each issue of Mendele
which gives complete instructions for dealing with Mendele.  I feel that
it would be nice to know how many Mendelniks (Mendelyaner?) subscribe
to this list.  This information would be a welcome, occasional addition
to the bulletin. It might be a way of judging the increase, if any, of
interest in Yiddish here and elsewhere in the world.

Subject: Zellig

Zellig Bach's many admirers and friends have probably been wondering
why nothing has been heard from him lately.  The answer is: flu.  Zellig
has, however, been recovering pavolyinke and is writing again.  He has
promised Mendele a lot of new material.  Sooner the better.  All
Mendelniks wish Zellig a refue shleyma.
