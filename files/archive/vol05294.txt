Subject: Rozhinkes mit...?

My Vilner informants (Dina Abramowicz, Dr. Yulyan Rafes) tell
me that the Yiddish for "mumps" is "mandlen."

Subject: Yiddish periodicals

Regarding the recent query concerning a list of current Yiddish periodicals, a
couple of years ago, the Congress for Jewish Culture published such a list in
its newsletter (of which only that issue has appeared so far). Copies may be
obtained by writing to the Congress for Jewish Culture, 25 East 21st Street,
New York, NY 10010.

Subject: Formal/informal distinctions

In die faraynikte shtatn nitst men nit die formale address-forme 'aykh' - men
nitst kimat nor 'du'. Ikh volt gevolt vissn, oyb in andere lender vu english
iz di hoypt sprakh, men nitst nokh die formale un die umformale formen oder
nor die umformale forme 'du'.

In the US, the formal address form 'aykh' is not used - 'du' is used almost
exclusively.  I would like to know, whether in other countries where English
is the dominant language, the formal and informal forms are still used, or if
only the informal 'du' is used.

Subject: Closing remarks

[Herewith the closing remarks of Ruth Barlas, Chair of the recently
concluded Third International Conference of Yiddish Clubs and Friends
of Yiddish.]

This is the last official session.  After lunch, we will part. But, this is
not the beginning, and it is not the end....it is only a continuation in the
serious tasks that lay ahead: to organize and carry out our resolutions to
further Yiddish education.

These last few days, we've heard a lot, we talked a lot....And just like you,
I've been doing a great deal of thinking about this matter.

Why are we doing this?

Most of us live in an open, comfortable environment.  We could probably lose
ourselves, our Jewish identity, in the large general community in which we
find ourselves.

What propels us?

Each one of us must find his or her own answer.

For me, there are two thoughts that keep rumbling through my mind.

First, I remember an unforgettable scene in a book by Mendele Moykher Sforim,
"The Wishing Ring".  After an absence of several years, the protagonist,
Hershele, returns home to the Jewish Pale, clean-shaven, stylishly dressed,
and finds his shtetl ravaged, his home gone.  Mendele doesn't recognize him
and wonders why this European stranger is so distraught by the Jewish
troubles.

Hershele answers, "I am a child of the people - a Jew like all my parents and
grandparents.  I am a little thread interwoven with them in the Jewish fabric
- from time immemorial - that goes under the name, "Jew".

And then, I recall the words of Yitskhok Leybush Peretz.  When the Haskole
movement, the Enlightenment in Eastern Europe, stirred up the Jewish
intelligensia and they wanted to escape from the ghettoes and assimilate,
Peretz wrote:

"I am not talking of enclosing ourselves in a spiritual ghetto. We should get
out of the ghetto, but with our own spiritual treasures,  and interchange:
give and take, not beg.

"Ghetto is impotence;  cultural cross-fertiliztion - the only possibility for
development of humanity."

In these two excerpts, I have found _my_ answer.

Tonight is Purim, a holiday in which we exchange gifts, "shalakh-mones", with
friends and relatives.

Let us learn, absorb, internalize our unique Yiddish cultural heritage and
offer it with love and pride as "shalakh-mones", as a gift to our children and
to the world.
