Subject: Introduction/ Rokhl Korn

   After reading Mendele for a few weeks, I decided to introduce
myself and make a request regarding the poet Rokhl Korn. What do you
know but there was a poem by her--thanks, Mark. And when I'm over
this flu I will look for the orignal for you, if somebody hasn't
already by then.

   Anyway, my name is Rebecca (aka Rifke, aka Rif) Lillian. I am in
my (hopefully) penultimate year as a student at the
Reconstructionist Rabbinical College near Philadelphia, but spending
this year in Jerusalem at Hebrew U. Among other things I am studying
women in Yiddish literature with Chava Turniansky, which is a
mekhiye. (Unfprtunately the faculty is on strike now so it's been a
while...) Hopefully next sememster I will also be studying with
Avrom Novershetern, who was my teacher when I did the YIVO/Columbia
zumer program in 1988.  In my spare time I enjoy translating from
Yiddish to English, and also working with tekhines.

   Currently I am writing a paper on the poetry of Rokhl Korn,
particularly the poems regarding her mother's death. It is for a
course on place and displacement in modern Yiddish literature (with
Sidra Ezrahi at Hebrew U) and I was wondering if:

1. anybody knows of any critical articles on Rokhl korn's poetry, in
English Yiddish and/or Hebrew

2.anybody knows of articles on Holocaust survivors writing of the
death of their parents, in general

3.anybody has biographical information on Korn beyond what is
available in S. Levitan's PAPER ROSES and her Yiddish anthology HEYM
UN HEYMLOSKEYT

4. anything else you may know of that could be relevant

I would greatly appreciate any information at all, un shik a groysn
dank fun erets yisroyal.

Mark, by the way, I suggerst you find that volume editied by Seymour
Levitan, PAPER ROSES. It is a lovely bilingual book. She was a
phenomenal poet, I think, and I for one would love to learn more
about her (paper or no paper, that is.)

So I appreciate the opportunity to seek some etses over this forum,
and will gladly help out anyone who would like info on Jerusalem's
yidishe svive.

zeyt gezunt, alemen, un nokh a dank

Subject: Re: "poter vern"

As to "poter vern" getting rid  of, one could also remember the
brakha (brokhe?)  one says  at a  bar  mitzva: barukh  shep'tarani
etc.  i.e. released me of paying for his sins.  In spoken Hebrew we
often use the phrase "barukgh shep'tarani" for good riddance.

Well, that's not as bad as the "Understanding Yiddish" lessons on
the Rechnitzer Rejects albums, which are given first in Yiddish only
and then with translation.  Selected excerpts:

Ikh darf shoin bentchn.
					"I need a nice seat."
Fur gezunterheit.
					"Go away sneezing."
Ikh hob gemakht havdulah.
					"I've made fifty cents profit."
Zug mir nokh a mol.
					"Tell me after the bris."
Gay in a gite shu.
					"Go out in a good pair of sneakers."

(I have the full transcript if anyone wants it... maybe for Purim?)

Subject: New Member seeks Yiddish course

Hi.  I'm a new member of this list.  My name is Marshall Levin and
I'm a student at Middlebury College in Middlebury, VT.

I really don't know any Yiddish at all.  I've taken both German and
Hebrew, and, with the help of my Grandmother, I have trudged through
a few paragraphs of a Yiddish textbook and learned a few rudimentary
phrases from her.

I was hoping to ask the other list members about how I can learn
more Yiddish. Are there any good e-mail or snail-mail courses, or
good and easy-to-use textbooks, which would not require me to have
another Yiddish speaker here to work with?  I'm in a rather remote
location, and I can't really go anywhere to take a course.

Do you have any suggestions?

Thanks very much,

Marshall

Subject: Poem and Yiddish at UMCP

Tayere Mendlniks un nikes,

The University of Maryland at College Park has offered courses in
Yiddish Language and Literature since 1978. As of this year I have
students who have been studying Advanced Yiddish for ca, four years.
Since our Jewish Studies program does not, as yet, have a MA degree,
we teach mainly undergrads and grads in history and comp.lit. Yes
Mark the Rokhl Korn poem is a fine one.

Mit vareme grusn,

Dvosye
