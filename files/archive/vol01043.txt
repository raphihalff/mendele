Subject: Intensive study programs

Can anyone tell me if they know of any Yiddish inten-
sive study programs OUTSIDE of New York.  (I like New
Yorkers but I seem to really hate New York, or rather I
really hate being IN New York. I used to work there and
still have nightmares).

In the latest issue of Afn Shvel, the publication of
the  League for Yiddish, there appears a reproduction
of page 1 of the 2/22/91 of Di Presse of Buenos Aires,
the Yiddish equivalent of La Prensa, which claims now
to be 'di eltste  yidishe tog-tsaytung in der velt'. 
The lead story is headlined  'Saddam's tsvue-rede farn
inerlikhn gebroykh' and continues as  follows: 'Der
irakisher diktator hot antoysht der velt mit zayn 
gornisht-zogndikn messedzsh'.  In Argentina?  What
happened to 'onzog'?  Talk about cultural hegemony.  

Gramsci aside, I have a query for the loshn-mayvinim
amongst us. Yiddish contains of course many loan words
that it has acquired at second hand, e.g. urbane Galli-
cisms (trotwar, chosey, zhilet, commis-vwayazher) via
Russian or--among French Jews--Americanisms (sveteyr,
pyuloveyr) via the French.  But where is the carrier
that brings 'message' to Argentinian Yiddishists?  Is
this only one of a class of non-intermediated loan-
words, and if so what are some examples?
