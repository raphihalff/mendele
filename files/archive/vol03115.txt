Subject: Gut yontiff pontiff

I am not sure of the date of the joke but I first heard it quite
early as part of the double barrelled "Gut yontiff pontiff, vos is
nayes Pius" so it comes before the recent spate of John's and Pauls.

And gut yontif to all

Subject: pinchas vs.pinkas

Pinchas is a Hebrew name (perhaps of Egyptian origin). The most
famous Pinchas has a portion of the Torah named for him, He was the
zealous grandson of the first High Priest, Aharon.

A pinkas is a Hebrew word for record book (or chronicle). These
pinkasim are valuable records of communal affairs of many varied
European Jewish communities. A yiddisih diminutive of the Hebrew
"Pinchas" is Pinye or Pintche.

Subject: re: Northern Exposure: "smaykl/shmaykl"

Now that I've got Pinchas and pinkes straight (thanks, everyone),
what about last week's Northern Exposure episode?  It was about an
apparent connection between Yiddish and the Native American language
spoken by the Alaska natives on that program.  The word which piqued
the doctor's interest was "smaykle" which was supposed to be close
to "coax" in Yiddish (maybe "shmaykle", but the Alaskans didn't have
"shm. ." so it came out "smaykle")  .

Although there were some other Yiddish words involved (rather
humorously, in fact--"halta coka as the Native "Old Venerable One",
which the doctor implied was a near cognate!), I don't think this
one was authentic.

Would  anyone correct me on this?   With so many great Yiddish words
to use, why would they make one up?

Subject: Introduction

I became aware of this list by seeing a mention of it in the recent
issue of Lilith.  I am not sure I should stay on it because my
interest in Yiddish is in no way professional.  But I am curious.

I grew up with my grandmother who spoke tsebrohkene English.  I was
the only kid in my generation of cousins that understood the adults
(mostly) when they spoke Yiddish so that the children wouldn't
understand what they were saying. I enjoyed Yiddish jokes and the
very infrequest Yiddish shows that would come through my home town
(Columbus, Ohio).

At graduate school (Northwestern Univ.), I attended a Yiddish class
at Hillel taught by Jeff Mallow and there learned more about Yiddish
and also enjoyed the songs.  Jeff gave a lecture once on modern
Physics in Yiddish (He's a physicist) and also took a group of us to
a lecture by Isaac Bashevis Singer in Skokie.

Since graduate school days, opportunities have not been many.  About
a dozen years ago, Oberlin College (where I work) brought in a
Yiddish teacher for a Winter Term class.  He stayed for semester and
met with some faculty and staff members informally.  I was in a
small group that tried to do some readings of Yiddish authors.

That's about it.  I never have really learned to speak Yiddish,
understand just some home-spoken language, and can read a bissel.
