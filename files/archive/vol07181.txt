Faran an oysdruk af yidish: ya-tebe-dam.  Af English (Vaynraykh): big shot. 
Fun vanen ken dos shtamen?  In Harkavy shteyt ya-tebye-dam. 

There is a Yiddish word, ya-tebe-dam, which Weinreich defines as big
shot.
Where can that come from?

Subject: "Glob" and "No use talking."

Shleyme Axelrod's funniest macaronic couplet imaginable [7.180]:

        _Ire fislekh un ire zokn_,
         I tell you, people, it's no use talk'n'...

(Her feet and her socks -- I tell you, people, it's no use talking), which he
points out appears in the Barton Brothers' "Cockeye Jenny," is the couplet I
was referring to [7.107] as taken directly from Jacob Jacobs words to "Oy, I
Like She" (music by Alexander Olshanetsky, sung by Aaron Lebedeff).  In
"Cockeye Jenny," the Barton Brothers were drawing upon the canon.  This
may
not be exactly what contemporary academics mean by intertextuality, but
it's
pretty close. 

Shleyme is reminded of this couplet in the context of answering Fred
Sherman's
inquiry [7.173] about the pronunciation /glob/ instead of /gloyb/, /gleyb/,
or
/glayb/ (believe) in a different Barton Brothers classic, "Joe and Paul." 
Interestingly, that pronunciation of that word also appears in a subsequent
chorus of "Oy, I Like She" -- followed by a non-standard pronunciation of
_emes_, fortuitously rhyming with _tsimes_.  I hear the words thus: 

        Ikh shver:  Akh, mentshn, glob in imes.
        Zi iz geshmak vi a melen tsimes.

(I swear:  Oh, people, believe in truth.  She's tasty as a fruit salad.)  For
those troubled by my translation of _melen [melon] tsimes_ as "fruit
salad,"
please be aware that Jacobs and Olshanetsky wrote the song for their
1927
musical _A nakht in kalifornye_.  Out here, that's how we say it.

Subject: Barton Brothers

Shleyme Axelrod, in Mendele 07.180, credits The Barton Brothers with the
couplet: "ire fislekh un ire zokn, I tell you, people, it's no use talk'n." 
If it is indeed in one of their songs, then they pliagiarized it from Aaron
Lebedeff's "Oy, I Like She."

Subject: Evil eye transliterated

Dan Leeson asked [07.180] about the transliteration of the yiddish word
for
evil eye, whether it is "ahora" or some other similiar spelling.

The correct word for evil eye is, from the Hebrew, ayin (eye)  horeh (evil). 
Ahora is only one-third of the three-fold word "kaynaynahoreh,"  without
(kayn)  an evil eye.  In Hebrew it would be "B'li Ayin Harah." 
  
How did the word become shortened to "kaynehoreh," leaving out the
ayne
(ayin), and thusly, according to Dan Leeson, ahora standing in for both
words
(ayin horeh)?

From: AJ Gilboa <bfgilboa@weizmann.weizmann.ac.il>
Subject: transliteration of "evil eye"

The question of transliteration of the Yiddish for "the evil eye" could well
begin at the source, the Hebrew expression. It seems that the evil eye in
Hebrew is correctly "ein ho-ro" (the eye of evil) and not "ayin ro-o" (an evil
eye). Then, depending on the Yiddish dialect that you are using
throughout
your narrative, it should be "ain horo" or "ein horo". A possible variant on
the second word could be "ho-re".

Subject: transliteration of "evil eye"

Re: Dan Lesson's query about the Yiddish word for evil eye: My
grandmother
always referred to this as "di gutn oyg."  Why 'gutn oyg?' I asked my
mother. 
In order to fool it, I was told.  "It," however, was never referred to
directly, never defined.  One had to infer.  Were my grandmother to be
alive
today, she would be 117 years old and likely be in an old folks home
where,
I'm sure, the evil eye would still be referred to as di gutn oyg.

Subject: Kurve and Old Church Slavonic

Kurva is ubiquitous in modern and older Slavic languages and dialects. It is
undoubtedly the source of the Yiddish word. Old Church Slavonic is a well
defined corpus of texts from the 10th-11th centuries, whose lexicon is
known
in detail. In spite of what any etymological dictionary of English might tell
you, Old Church Slavonic does not attest kurva or kuruva.
