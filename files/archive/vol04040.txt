Subject: Bintel Briv letters

My experience with the Forwards as a one-time contributor and my ongoing
work at its radio station WEVD, leads to me to conclude that the
original Bintel Brief letters have either been tossed long ago (most
probably) or hidden so well in the building's basement that it is not
worth their time to dig them out.  (I infer this because 5 years ago I
was planning to have some Yiddish speaking actor/actress pals of mine
come on my radio program DER FORVERTS SHO and read the old letters.
Despite numerous request I received no replies or encouragement to seek
them out. None.

Lots and lots of irreplaceable materials were dumped when the paper moved
from its breathtaking East Broadway building to its current less-aestheti-
cally pleasing home.

YIVO got a little bit they didn't manage to trash, but in my twelve years
there I never heard about the Bintel Brief letters.

(Even if they were at YIVO, finding them now during their move would not
produce immediate results either.)

uh, dave, if someone reads that their father isn't their father
or that their fortune came from underworld dealings or that their
parents were never married, you don't think they'd have a case?

Subject: Further thoughts on synonyms

Some thoughts (and an appreciation) on a recent comment of Khayem
Bochner:

In a language such as English or even more so, Yiddish, derived from many
disparate linguistic sources many words occur of almost the same meaning.
This not only adds to the richness of the language to the extent of being
able to avoid monotony of expression, but also as the synonyms diverge
subtly in nuance the modalities of the thoughts can be subtly modulated
as well. Yiddish  is particularly blessed with this sort of variey which
gives the language a particular charm.

As a simple and rather common example consider the words efsher,
filaykht, mistame, ken zayn. As a first go around they are all
essentially the same in meaning. However if we take in to consideration
the modalities  I sense the following distinctions:

Filaykht = perhaps
Mistame = most likely
Efsher = maybe
Ken zayn = it's possible

The most Germanic of the words, Filaykht, is the most neutral in modality
and thereby serves a valid discriminatory function. I do not know whether
the ideologs object to this particular word or not , nor do I care. I
find it silly to have to look up in a book to determine whether some
authority  gives me permission to use it. The richer the language the
more wonderful it is. By the same token khilek and untershied,  fenster
and vinde, a zakh and fiel, lezn and leyenen, etc. should all belong. The
speakers will eventually find a way to sort out the modalities.

As a case in point in English we make the subltle distinction between
much and many (one for continuous and the other for discreet sets,
similarly as with less and fewer, etc.). I sense a similar distinction
occuring in Yiddish between fiel (tsu essen, tsum bayshpiel) and a zakh
(zakhn, l'moshl).

To the best of my knowledge, the word "mies" comes indeed from Hebrew and
became part of the Yiddish vocabulary, from which it was borrowed (in
19th C only) by the dialect spoken in Berlin and subsequently spread to
colloquial German in other regions of Germany.  (Just like in the case of
the German "Ganove" ("ganef"), the borrowing of "mies" from Yiddish into
German occurred via the underworld jargon.)

Subject: East Side/Thieves' cant; translation; Pique

I. Joseph Sherman (South Africa):

1. Concerning the Jewish penchant for settling on the "East Side":

For New York City, Jewish settlement on the Lower East Side has sometimes
been explained in terms, of the following succession: The first settlers
(for whatever reason) were the Irish Catholics. Their settlement proved
attractive, for religious reasons, to a wave of German settlers who, in
turn, attracted waves of Jewish settlers for linguistic reasons.

2. "ganef" in Dickens, etc.: The relationship of Yiddish to "thieves'
cant" (German "Rotwelsch"), and to a variety of specialized trade
jargons, is a fascinating subject, first mentioned in the literature by
Martin Luther. In the late 60's, a linguist working in British prisons
reported that he still required access to Yiddish to interpret much of
what he heard.

If our good shames can tell you how to access the relevant early issue of
"Mendele" where I posted more extensive information on the subject, you
might find it helpful.

II. Bob Rothstein:

Your piece on Russian to Yiddish translation is a beauty. I wonder if it
reflects the "khumesh-taytsh" tradition of adding commentary to
translation. Some time ago, I posted a citation from Shlomo Noble's book
"Khumesh-Taytsh", concerning Esau, that you might find interesting. I
don't have the book at hand.

III. Respect for one's language. ANY LANGUAGE!

As an old hand in the teaching business, I'm usually very tolerant of
student error in the use of Yiddish. After all, there is so much for an
English speaker to learn: gender, case, tense, aspect, prefixing, what
have you. The pleasure a teacher derives from a student's progress as he
comes to grips with these things repays all his investment and
constraint.

A teacher learns, soon enough, how to detect when a student is learning,
and how to guage his progress. It shines through in many postings on
Mendele, for example. By the same token, there are numerous postings in
which it is equally apparent that no effort to learn is taking place and,
perhaps worst of all, that the speaker or writer doesn't care. This can
unnerve the most tolerant of souls.

A topic for a sociolinguistic study: Would those to whom these words
might apply permit themselves to make the same bizarre errors in writing
Hebrew, English, French, Russian? Why not? Why is it permissible in
Yiddish to write the equivalent of "Yesterday me will came" or "I didn't
could understood" and expect polite silence in response? Why not simply
write in English, instead?
