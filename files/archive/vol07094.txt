Subject: Shmooze

Regarding a recent inquiry about the meaning of "shmooze", I always assumed
that it is an American English corruption of the Yiddish verb _shmuesn_
meaning to exchange pleasantries in a friendly informal chat.  I haven't had
occasion to use the word "shmooze" but in hearing those who do use it I get
the impression that it still has the same meaning as the original.  I did,
however, once hear someone use it in the sense of buttering someone up as in
"You gotta shmooze him [referring to a supervisor, for instance] so he'll
give you a new computer."  This, of course, veers drastically from the
original Yiddish and it really grates on my ears.

Subject: Yiddish version of "The Merchant of Venice"

Peter Gutmann asked about Yiddish version of "The Merchant of Venice" [7.093].
At least one translation exists:

Subject: shmooze

FWIW, the only _shmuz_ I know in Yiddish or _shmooze_ in Yinglish means 
roughly 'chat', both as a noun and a verb (shmuzn in the infinitive in Yiddish
of course). Never heard it used with the meaning 'kiss up'. Where I come
from, one who kissed up was a _tokhes lekher_ or, as it was abbreviated in
our Yinglish, a _T.L._  This, btw, was occasionally the source of
inter-cultural confusion as the non-Yinglish speakers among us called a
kisser-upper an _A.K._ (from _ass-kisser_), while _A.K._ for us meant 'old
fogey' (from _alter kaker_). Frankly, for picturesque imagery, I think 
standard English wins hands-down here with its _brown-noser_, a term I never
even heard till I left Brooklyn. ;)

Subject: Quoting in Mendele

I shall take advantage of Louis Fridhandler's plea for accuracy in quoting to
ask whether the Mendelyaner at large still want to ban direct quoting. I
personally have never understood the motivation for it and have never come
across any other list or newsgroup with the same ban. As long as we have to
paraphrase what we're replying to, there'll be instances of misquoting, at
least from some people's point of view. How about allowing direct quotes?

Ellen Prince

[Note from the moderator: Mendele does not ban direct quoting. Examples can be
found in the recent issues. However, Mendele strongly discourages excessive
quoting. Many other lists and all Usenet groups have similar policies, that
prevent the snowballing of multilayered quotations. Mendele's founding fathers
modeled the list as "the Letters to the Editor page in any quality newspaper".
Quotations in Mendele should be formatted accordingly to this model.   - i.v.]

Subject: A lange davenen

I am one of those who get extremely iritated with too a long davenen when the
bal tfile shleps in der velt aran. So what should I say when we haven't even
started and we are only discussing the word?!

If davenen would only take a fraction of the time we have spent over the word
then not only would moshiekh have been here by now but he might even have been
gone again.

May I humbly suggest a discussion of the word 'khiperen' which means a snappy
davenen, but please don't take a yor mit a mitvokh over it.

Subject: Is there a Yiddish version of "The Merchant of Venice"?

I don't have a specific answer to Peter Gutmann's query. However it may be of
some interest that circa 1948, I attended a performance on Second Avenue in
New York of "Shylock's Tokhter" with the great Maurice Schwartz as Shylock.
Some of Shakespeare's language was there "Hot nit a yid ... " but the plot had
some key changes. In the climactic courtroom scene, Portia's sophistries are
answered by a bright young talmudic student.  Reluctantly, the judge tells
Shylock to take his pound of flesh. Shylock takes his knife, raises it, and
then, Maurice Schwartz's shout reverberating through the theatre, calls out:
"Ikh ken nit, ikh bin a yid"

It was wonderful!

Subject: schmooze

-shmuesn- in Yiddish, is to converse, discuss, chat.  -ot dos iz a shmues-
means  whatever was said is worth thinking about.  a-shmueser- iz a chatty
person. I suspect that the English "schmooze"  borrowed this Yiddish word
upon which to build a new meaning and pronunciation.

Subject: Sneezes, superstitions and shmues

Re: sneezing. My in-laws, a"h, Litvaks both, used to say "tzu gezunt" on the
first sneeze, "tzu lebn" on the second, and "tzu lange yorn" on the third.

Re: David Herskovic's list of superstitions. When you're being spoken about
your ears burn. This one isn't restricted to Jews.  In English we talk about
ears ringing under such circumstances.

To scream 'mazel tov' when a glass or plate breaks: This one obviously comes
from the wedding customs of (a) the mothers of both bride and groom breaking a
plate together at the signing of the kesuba, and (b) the groom breaking a
glass at the end of the ceremony.

Re: schmooze. There is a third meaning that no one has yet mentioned: a
lecture, usually by a rabbi.  A subset of this is the musar-shmues.

Subject: Kaczerginski and Shakespeare

In reply to the request for titles of books by Shmerke Kaczerginski, here are
the titles of several books in Yiddish,
 (1) Ikh bin geven a partizan (2 vol.) 1952 
 (2) Lider fun getos un lagern. 1948
 (3) Khurbn Vilne. 1947
 (4) Tsvishn hamer un serp. 1949 
 
They may be available from the National Yiddish Book Center, in Amherst, Mass.

Regarding The Merchant of Venice (in Yiddish) try the same source. They do
have a translation of Hamlet and of Shakespeare's Sonnets, as well as a volume
of plot synopses of all of Shakespeare's plays. I'm not sure whether The
Merchant .. was translated or if they can supply it.
