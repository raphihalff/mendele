Subject: Introduction

I'm at Wellesley college. I am translating a story by Y.L. Peretz, and I
can not find some words. Could someone help me? If anyone could tell me
about a book that would help me that would be wonderful. I would like to
apologize in advance... I do not Know how to transliterate, so this is
the best I can do. The story is "A Yingele"

Subject: Thoughts on a Mendele convention

The more I imagine what a Mendele convention would be like, the more
attractive the prospect.  All would enjoy the face to face meetings with
fellow Mendelyanerim (is that a neologism?!).  But what do you say after
you say hello?

The first and most obvious answer is: Some of what is now being debated
on Mendele.

1. E.g., the necessity of an inclusionary policy whose logical
consequence is a liberal acceptance of non-standard Yiddish in
non-standard romanization.  (Part of a larger panel discussion?)

2. That being said, there is certainly room for those who would argue
that high, consistent standards facilitate communication and that such
standards support Yiddish continuity.  Future generations of Yiddishists
(halevay) deserve to work on the firm base that high standards provide.
(Another panel discussion?)

3. Has anyone on Mendele been writing original Yiddish stories or
articles or memoirs?  If so, a session devoted to that would be exciting.

4. Mendele is newsworthy in my opinion, and Yiddish needs better press
and public relations.  IMHO that ought to be an overt goal of a Mendele
convention, or at least a subtext of a Mendele convention.  Among other
results, it may have an impact on one minor but gnawing annoyance.  In my
personal experience, those who know the least about Yiddish are the most
certain they know what Yiddish is or is not: e.g., Yiddish is not a
language, Yiddish has no grammar, Yiddish is bad German, etc., etc.  The
dogged certainty of the ignoramus in all fields is legendary.  The field
of Yiddish is no exception.  Does anyone agree that this is a problem at
all, or worthy of discussion?

5. Ashkenazic Jewish history is a vast field yet still closed to most
Jews and non-Jews.  Therein is the dramatic saga of the vicissitudes of
Yiddish culture and its miraculous survival.  I believe an exploration is
worth the effort.  I have no idea whether this is currently a serious
part of academic research.  If so, should Mendele take a little bite of
that vast subject?  Can we start a discussion on line in preparation?
Are there any academic specialists in that field on line?

6. The linguistics professors will note that I have essentially ignored
their passionate interest.  That's only because of my ignorance.  I
really would like to learn, but I can't frame a sensible question.

7. A Mendele convention would surely overlap, in subject matter, a
Yiddish Club convention.  However, I suspect it would turn out to be
rather different, as it should be.

In a guter sho, a Mendele tsunoyfkum vet undz shafn groys fargenign.
Dervayl lomir zikh freyen mit vos mir hobn in Mendele.

Subject: "oyssheygetsn"

In the Yiddish Forverts of Nov. 25, 1994, in the column "Azoy shraybn
'zey'!", the writer K. (kuf) comments on an advertisement placed
somewhere by a group of rightists who identify themselves as American
supporters of Likud.  The ad takes to task Binayamin Netanyahu, David
Levy, and Aruk Sharon for joining with the Rabin government in betrayal
of Israeli national interests. "Inem oyfruf vern 'oysgesheygetst'
[quotation marks in original] di dray frier-dermonte perzonen ... ."

"Oyssheygetsn" apparently means something like "to exclude from the
Jewish fold."  Is this expression familiar to anyone here on Mendele?
The quotation marks suggest that it might have originated with K.
(Understand, my question is not whether "sheygets" is in bad taste when
applied to non-Jews; Weinreich labels it "contemptuous", and that's good
enough for me [although I seem to recall it being a non-evaluative term
in my youth.]  Also irrelevant here is Israeli politics.)

Subject: Lodz ghetto

I am doing research for an upcoming interview, and I was wondering if
anyone had any stories or information about the Lodz ghetto that they
would be willing to share.  I'm looking for the kind of images that "you
can't find in books," in order to give me a better background.  Anything
can be sent to me directly, or posted; whichever is preferred.  A dank.

Subject: More Shostakovich

Ruben Frankenstein had perfect timing with his question about
Shostakovich's work "From Jewish Folk Poetry," Op. 79.  Today I spent
some time at YIVO researching this subject.  With the help of YIVO
archivist Chana Mlotek, I found several articles in Yiddish and English
about Shostakovich's relation to the Jews.  I must tell you about one in
particular.  In a May 2, 1956, article in the Morgn Freiheit, Ber Green
wrote a *glowing* review of the American premiere of "From Jewish Folk
Poetry." Here are some excerpts in approximate translation (Chana Mlotek
helped with the translation as well):

"From the rich multi-colored treasury of our Yiddish folk music,
Shostakovich selected and wove together a rarely beautiful wreath of
flowers, eleven folk songs in his own interpretation and concept. . . .
He put wings on the "Oy" of the needy tune of suffering folk masses. . .
. The music seeps with sadness but also the strength of hope. . . . How
deeply the composer could control the Jewish themes."

So far I'm finding that Shostakovich's Jewish work was well received by
the Jewish community.

According to Joachim Braun's essay ("Shostakovich's Jewish Songs," World
Council for Yiddish and Jewish Culture, 1989), these are the Yiddish
titles for all the songs:

I. Plach ob umershem mladenste - Lament for a dead infant -
	Zun mit a regn/Di kale gelegn
II. Zabotlivyie mama i tyotya  - Fussy Mummy and Auntie -
	Shlof, shlof, shlof!/Der tate foren vet in dorf
III. Kalybelnaya - Lullaby -
	Shlof mein kind, mein kind, mein sheiner
IV. Pered dolgoy razlukoy  - Before a long separation -
	Oy, Avram, ikh ken on dir nit zayn
V. Predasterezhenye  - A warning -
	Her zhe, Khasia! men darf nit geyn
VI. Broshennyi atets - The deserted father -
	Elie der shenker zitst in khalat/Di tokhter zayne, zi hot zikh
        geshmadt
VII. Pesnya o nuzhde - A song of poverty -
	Af dem boydem shloft der dakh
VIII. Zima  -  Winter
	Es ligt in bet Sheyndl, mayn Sheyndl
IX. Kharoshaya zhizn  - The good life
	Vegn rokhves fun felder, Oy brider getraye
X. Pesnya devushki  -  A girl`s song
	Af a lonke ba dem veldl/Vos shteyt shtendik vi fartrakht
XI. Schastye  -  Happiness
	Ich hob mayn man genumen untern hant

> Who has the source Shostakovich used, namely Y. Dobrushin & A.
> Yuditsky: Yidishe folkslider, Moscow 1940?

I think that Shostakovich used the Russian translation of that work,
which was published in Moscow in 1947.  (The piece was composed in 1948
and published in 1955.) YIVO has this version.
