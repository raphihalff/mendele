Subject: Yiddish & Yisroyl

One of the banes of my life seems to be that people attribute meanings to my
words and then shoot those meanings down. Dear Noyekh, I too celebrate the
diversity of Yiddish culture, not only the intelligensia. And I too
participated in the davenen discussion. And others. But if Yiddish culture
does not survive, vet nit zayn mit vemen tzu redn. 

The clarion call I am trying to send out, very much sober zeal not shrill
zealotry, is that the survival of Yiddish in the Israeli schools (among the
young) is key to the continuing viability of Yiddish in the secular world. 
Yiddish in the world of orthodoxy will go on as always. The endangered
species is secular Yiddish. In what other country can we demand (underscored)
Yiddish as a limud in the schools if not Israel. In other lands we politely
request. (And please note, that in a climate of 50%+ assimilation rates,
Yiddish is not a top budget priority in the lands outside Eretz YIsroyl) In
Israel, now that the Rock Ivrits (love that!) are not the way of things, the
teaching of Yiddish to the young, is critical.  And the law, thanks to Leybl
Botvinik and his friends and associates, has been passed. (His last
communication provides enough "protim" for immediate action.) 

Pressure needs to be judiciously applied now, so that the number of Israeli
schools teaching Yiddish is increased. The number of hours given to Yiddish
classes needs to be increased to produce students who speak Yiddish well, who
can pass Yiddish on. Yiddish is not a shtifkind in Isroyl - not a "safah
azit" -- it is the mother tongue of Ashkenaz and of the founding generation
of Khalutzim and the literary generation that preceded them. We don't have to
be shnorrer about it -- Yiddish has as much right to exist and be supported
in the Israeli school curriculum as any other subject. And more importantly
for those of us outside Israel, the respect accorded Yiddish in Israel helps
reinforce our efforts. 

I would like to underscore Dr. Miriam Isaac's underscoring of my call for
voicing concern. Between her shures, you see that there are many writers,
poets, academics and others, as well as working people and retirees who came
in their busloads, from all over Israel, to the Conference. There is a love
and support in many parts of Israel for Yiddish. Among the new Russian
immigrants, it is expressed through Yiddish folksinging, as the Ashkelon
"Freyd fun Yidish" festival, an annual affair, testifies.  And they sang
their songs by Warshavsky, Gebirtig, Anonymous, etc. with such love and zeal.
And to get to participate meant they work at it all year long. Every year. 

I was at a Kibbutz (Beit Zera) where the people came to see me and talk with
me in a zis, unsullied Yiddish over a glezele tey and kikhelekh. Some
younger, many old grey heads, some in walkers.Some had admittedly been Roick
Ivritniks in earlier years, but had changed their thinking over time.

Yiddish in Israel has a key role to play in global Yiddish. Example: I note
that the current pages of the Forvertz are filled with the writers Israel has
nurtured. Yiddish is yeasting and cooking in Israel despite the aparatchiks.
But for the continuation of this, education of the young is a necessity. 

Thank you Sholem Berger and Mendy Fliegler, for the eloquent ways in which
you also voiced support. 

There are other serious issues that came out of the Conference that also need
to be aired. But this is a fire call and precedes the others which can be
later pondered, studied and produced as appropriate reports and manifests.

Subject: Some thoughts on the nature of Yiddish

I'm sorry that I misundertood Sylvia Schildt and glad that we're in general
agreement. 

When I wrote that Yiddish as such is just another language. I also worried
even as I wrote the line that it might be misunderstood.  So I'd like to
amplify my remarks on this point.  There has been considerable debate over
the years as to the "nature" of Yiddish, interesting debate, but not too long
on conceptual clarity. 

In an effort to figure out where I stood I wrote down --primarily with myself
as client-- a few ideas.  These in turn metamorphosed into fables, known in
some quarters as "thought-experiments".  Here they are.  May they not be
misunderstood. 

                                  ******

1. In all the formerly Yiddish-speaking lands of eastern Europe an astounding
change has taken place among its remaining Jews, particularly the young: an
infectious wave of enthusiasm not only for Yiddish but for other (secular)
aspects of Jewish life that had flourished before Stalin, Hitler and Stalin
once again intervened.  Jewish life has been constituted after a fashion. 
The same music, poetry, dancing as before.  An unprecedented outpouring of
first-rate Yiddish writing, not only fiction but in all intellectual spheres:
physics, philosophy and plumbing, a khalyastre of Yiddish deconstructionists
has taken over from Paris and Yale. There are of course no synagogues, no
yeshivas.  No one learns or uses Hebrew and the vocabulary has changed to
that extent.  No shabes, no kashrus, no pesekh.  But Yiddish is very much
alive. 

2. In all the formerly Yiddish-speaking lands of eastern Europe an astounding
change has taken place.  First, every single remaining Jew has converted to
Christianity.  Not only converted but sincerely and enthusiastically.  The
rest of eastern Europe is first amazed, then impressed, finally ecstatic. 
Synagogues are converted to other uses (including monasteries), former rabbis
and shokhtim take up posts as priests and deacons. The Jewish problem solved! 
Former Jews move into positions of prominence and power in all spheres, from
President of Poland to Metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church.  Indeed
their hegemony is so pervasive that Yiddish becomes first a lingua franca
from Krakow to the Bering Strait and in short order the official language of
this vast area.  From being declared moribund, Yiddish has become a world
language.  Intellectual life is very rich. Every couple of months a Yiddish
Dostoievsky or Gogol comes out with a masterpiece. The Yiddish chanting in
Orthodox churches brings visitors from all over the world.  And Yiddish
itself changes, acquiring Kalmuk legends, Polish jokes, Cossack proverbs; at
the same time the Semitic component connected to Judaism atrophies and
disappears.  Only Hebrew words such as "shoyte", "ganef", "meshuge" and oddly
enough "meshumed" remain. 

3. In all the formerly Yiddish-speaking lands of eastern Europe an astounding
change has taken place.  The Jews in those countries have all decided to drop
Yiddish in favor of Hungarian. The old Germanic word "Yiddish" is replaced by
the Magyar word for "Jewish". Just as in prewar Poland, a full-scale and
multi-faceted Jewish life obtains, but every word, every song, every novel,
every session of Talmud study is in Hungarian.  Orthodox Jews had all along
felt more comfortable in eastern Europe.  They head for Transylvania, in the
process emptying Williamsburg, Antwerp and Bnai Brak of their
Yiddish-speakers.  Yiddish may be in trouble.

Subject: Yiddish and Knesset

Although I wish to see Yiddish grow and prosper I think it is wrong to insist
that the Kenesset endorse it. Hebrew is the Lingua Franca of the Jewish state
and the lovers of Yiddish should do as they do in the U. S., grow Yiddish as a
private enterprise.

Subject: Veltrat far yidish un yidisher kultur

The August 2, 1998 issue of the Montreal Gazette has an interesting, if
rather impressionistic article about the recent Yiddish conference held in
Israel under the auspices of the Veltrat far yidish un yidisher kultur
(World Council for Yiddish and Yiddish Culture).  The citation: 

"For the love of Yiddish:  a recent international conference billed itself
as a celebration of the old language, but served as a lightning rod for
anger and fear that Yiddish is in danger of disappearing."

The author, Irwin Block, is a reporter for The Gazette who attended the
conference, which took place in Ashkelon (as has been described in recent
weeks by various Mendelyaner).  The article can be found on The Gazette's
web site:

Subject: Yiddish in baroque opera

Dear Mendele list,

I am a musicologist completing an article on the use of Yiddish in a group of
early 18th-century operas by Reinhard Keiser.  The author of the texts was
not Jewish and seems to have gotten his Yiddish vocabulary from a number of
sources.  There are some words in these operas that I have not been able to
identify, and wonder if anyone on the list can help me.  Remember that the
librettist often doesn't hear the words quite correctly from his putative
informants. 

The most vexing of these has been:  "Leiser humeck".  The context is a card
game between several Gentile characters and the Jew Schmuel.  After a play by
one of the Gentile characters comes the following line by Schmuel (as an
aside):  "Der Leiser humeck hat bald aus geprahlt."  Leiser is in German
type;  humeck is in Roman type (which usually means a Hebrew-derived Yiddish
word in this libretto).  If anyone can help me, there are a few other words
I'd like to check before I submit this.  It's been a fascinating study. 

Many thanks, 
Jeanne Swack

Subject: lachen mit yashtsherkes

The translation of the phrase "lachen mit yashtsherkes " that I know is
laughing with (bitter) tears.I learned from Clara Rapp that yashtsherkes is a
lizard(s). In the COMPLETE YIDDISH-HEBREW DICTIONARY by M. Tzanin, page 234
two entries (1) yashtshereetze(s) l'taah, chardon, zachalit (three synonyms
in Hebrew for lizard) ahnakah (groan, cry, moan)  (2) yashtsherke(s) l'taah,
s'mamit (night lizard). 

I never came across the translation "grin and bear it" that Clara Rapp
presents.. It was most often the tragi-comic situation where one is laughing
but with bitter tears. I have no idea from where the phrase comes. From what
language is the word yashtsherkes? I would guess that it is from some Eastern
European language. It does not sound like a word that would come from German,
Dutch or French Yiddish. Knowing the origin of the word might tell us more
about how the word was used and in what contexts.

Without any connection except for the word laughing I am reminded of a
Yiddish phrase which I do not understand and perhaps I have garbled the
expression beyond recognition. Maybe someone in Mendele land can make me the
wiser--Vawss lacht ehr? Dee Mameh hat ihm gehat! Freely translated -- Why is
he laughing? His mother had him (or gave birth to him). Fifty years ago I
asked a rabbi in whose home I was boarding what was the meaning of the above
phrase. He replied:"Fregt mir a b'cherem ich veyss nit vawss dos maynt "You
can ask me and even put me in excommunication for not helping you, I do not
know what that means. 

Zei mir gezint un a gringen tawness tzu alle vawss fasten on Tisha B'av.

Subject: A. Manaster Ramer

I just want to say a word about A. Manaster Ramer. I have enjoyed his
thoughtful postings on Mendele, and have learned a few things as well. I did
not know he was in poor health. I can not provide the kind of help he needs,
but I do wish him a speedy recovery. The world needs his reasoned approach to
linguistic problems.
