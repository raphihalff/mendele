Subject: tomid vs keseyder

Felicitas Payk asks if they are different in meaning.  In Yiddish tomid
can mean "often, constantly, etc.," whereas keseyder signals more of a
repeated action at regular intervals.  Harkavy says "seriatim, in
regular order."  It is sometimes used when something is annoyingly
repeated, whereas tomid does not carry such a charge.  Keseyder is a
Hebrew word spelled Khof, Samekh, Dalet, Resh.  If someone goes to a
place often it is tomid, but if a child asks questions constantly it is
keseider.

I believe "keseyder" is from the Hebrew "seder," meaning "order."

Subject: badkhen

Does any one have any information about a badkhen.  It was a jester
who entertained at shtetl weddings in Eastern Europe. Or would there
be any recordings of this?

Subject: Klezmer

In reference to Goldie Milgram's list of Yiddishisms: to the best of my
knowledge, "klezmer" (or its plural "klezmorim") means itinerant
musicians who played at various simkhes in various shtetlekh.

Subject: Yiddish Terminology Sought

Concerning Goldie Milgram's query on Yiddish culture-building terms: I
am a little unclear what sort of culture-building she means. Is this
what people in "der alter heym" did? If so, our ancestors would be a
little confused as to the purpose of "Yiddish culture building." If she
means what we do TODAY, in the modern non-shtetl world, then there are
all sorts of people who build Yiddish culture.

As an example, may I add what I do to further Yiddish culture (in
addition to teaching my young children Yiddish)? That is, calligraphy
in Hebrew and Yiddish (as well as English and a bit of Greek). A
calligrapher is a kaligraf in Yiddish (but I am unclear as to the
feminine form; others can add this). The art of calligraphy is
kaligrafye. I am also the president (as well as music writer and
arranger) of a local independent Jewish choir, Sharim v'Sharot, whose
members sing high-quality music in all Jewish languages. A choir would
be a khor in Yiddish.
I am sure others have ideas on this topic.

Subject: More on kvetsh

In Yiddish kvetshn means crush, press or squeeze like the the German word
quetschen.  In Yiddishized English (Yinglish) kvetch means complain or
complainer.

I doubt that the English word kvetch is related to the German word
quetschen.  Here is my thought.

Polish has the following two words.

kweczec (the first e, e-cedilla, is nazalized; last c is a soft ch-sound)
means grumble, groan, complain, bitch (sl), be ailing.

kwekala (the first e is e-cedilla pronounced with nasalization; the l is
crossed pronounced like l in the English word ball, an old-fashioned stage
pronunciation, or like English w) means grumbler, complainer,
hypochondriac.

kweczec and kwekala seem to correspond more closely to the Yinglish
meanings of kvetch than the Yiddish dictionary meaning of kvetshn.

E-cedilla is nasalized in Standard Polish, but the (semietymological)
orthography of Polish is a concession to the loss of nasalization in some
dialects and in other Slavic languages.or  to the development of
nasalization, where it did not exist historically.

A pronunciation of kweczec withount nasalizing the first e is quite
probable in some places or in the past.  In any case because Yiddish does
not have nasalization, loss of nasalization in a borrowing from Polish or a
related Slavic language is quite probable.

It is unlikely for the Yinglish meaning to have passed back to Polish in
Poland. Now it is possible that the Yinglish meaning of kvetch was
generated in a place like Chicago or NY where Polish and Yiddish speakers
were in close proximately and both groups were learning English(*), but I
suspect it probably existed dialectically in Eastern Europe among Yiddish
speakers (either as a borrowing from some Slavic language or dialect other
than Polish or perhaps as an inheritance from Judeoslavic) and just never
made it into the dictionaries as an acceptable usage.

(*) The English language slang use of nuts for no or nothing doing may be a
similar example -- it was common among American Jews where I grew up, but I
think it comes from Polish nic z tego, nothing doing.
