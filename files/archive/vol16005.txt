Subject: gilgul

In one of the Yiddish discussion groups I attend in the Chicago/Skokie
area, a member mentioned growing up hearing the word "gilgul" which, he
said, was used in  his Yiddish circles to refer to a  person with
devil-like attributes.

I am unclear as to how gilgul came to mean a devil?

If this epithet comes from the kabbalistic concept of gilgul, of
Transformation and metamorphosis and entering different life spheres, how
did it end up being a pejorative term?  Is there not a positive take on
gilgul hanefesh(soul transmigration), which refers to the passing of a dead
person's soul into another being to atone for sins committed in the soul's
previous "gilgul"(life sphere)?

Or does the term gilgul, without its kabbalistic inferences, simply  refer
to a person who has turned and turned like a galgal(wheel, in Hebrew) into
some terrible person.

A shaynem dank,

Subject: Multiple questions in Yiddish

It seems to me that the sentence "Moyshe hot gekoyft fish un Arn hot
gekoyft fleysh; itst veystu ver vos hot gekoyft un vos ver hot gekoyft."
Should read, "...itst veystu ver hot vos gekoyft un vos hot ver gekoyft."

In regard to Chaim Pevner's "Yiddish is a dying language", it seems to me
that the views expressed therein are egocentric and exclusivist.  I do not
believe that "modern" Yiddish, as taught in universities is any less
legitimate than that spoken in 19th century Poland, any more than "modern"
English is a bastardization of the "King's English" I learnt at school some
70 years ago.  I accepted, with great pain, the blurring of the use of
cases in sentences containing personal and relative pronouns: the use of
"who," "whom," "I," "me," etc., but they are the reality and a signal of
the continuing evolution of the language.  The "split infinitive," anathema
in my day, deserving of a rap on the knuckles, is now completely
legitimate. Yasher koyekh, I say to the Universities who are struggling
against unspeakable odds to keep Yiddish alive!

Subject: query about words

I came across several words that perhaps you could shed some light on.

There is a verb "durkhtn" in "Loz zikh im durkhtn az a porits iz gekumen
mit a ekstra papir, volt er gemuzt shpanen, azoy zol er yetst shpanen
ferd."

There is apparently a rain coat or something called a "svita" which is not
merely a "suit."

Then there are a couple of Russian words that seem to relate to a person
who is a postman (because "post" in Russian is "potchta" and the endings
are Russian), and his horses used to deliver mail.  He could harness his
wagon and transport people.  He is called a "Potshtor."

And then this sentence: "Es farshteyt zikh az er muz heysn shpanen potsht
un opfirn mikh tsu der grenets."  The "potshtor" also made use of "3 ferd
potshtove."

Thanks,
David Goldman

Subject: Judeo-Slavic

Martin Jacobs may want to have a look at the following artifact, a Torah
mantle with Czech rendered in Hebrew letters from Susice, early 20th
century, on the web site of the Jewish Museum in Prague
http://www.jewishmuseum.cz/en/apredmet_04_11.htm. There is an informative
caption that may provide some assistance with further research into the
topic.

Subject:  Chaim Pevner's "Yiddish, a Dying Language"

I live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, and never lived on the Lower
East Side.  I never heard Yiddish as a child.  I am not a Hassidic Jew.

And yet, it tugs at me to learn it, so I do.  I study in classes with
Weinreich's College Yiddish. I am going to Vilna this August for the
Vilnius Yiddish Institute of intensive Yiddish studies.  I love even the
grammar.  If we study YIVO grammar and pronunciation with native speakers
as teachers, our Yiddish too will soften into that fluidity and be
recognizable and welcome to all Yiddish speakers, no matter how they got
there.  And then we latecomers will also be "native" speakers.  I want to
be so fluent that Yiddish is what I talk to myself in all day (I already do
that but I'm not so fluent).

And in a couple of years, I will write stories in Yiddish.  I don't really
care how many or how few readers there will be.  An artist (I am an artist)
hopes that at least one other person will kvel about her paintings, so if
one person likes my stories I'll be happy.  And then I might teach a course
in drawing, all in Yiddish.  Why? Why not? I love this language.

Subject: Yinglish and Hebrish

Jack Berger's posting, referencing the incursions of English and Hebrew
into Yiddish, reminds me of a family story. While I was spending a year in
Israel, my father a"h, came to visit me and also his sister, a"h, who
resided in Ramat Gan. The two siblings had grown up together, speaking
Yiddish as their first language, in Poland. Post-war, they had found one
another in D.P. camps and later separated to live in the U.S. and in
Israel. Now it was some twenty-five years later, and as we all sat in my
aunt's living room, Dad asked his sister, "efsher hostu a kaltn trink in
der 'fridge'?". She responded, "Nu, nem dekh a 'mits' fun der 'mekarer'."
Until I pointed out the non-Yiddish in each's speech, neither even realized
the corruption of their mame-loshn!!

Is there a listing anywhere of Yiddish Radio Broadcasting Programs that can
be accessed on the internet?  I'd be much obliged for this information.
