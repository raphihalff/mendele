Subject: meshugener ritekh

Last Sunday I have attended with great pleasure a YIVO lecture in Yiddish
by Rivka Blau "Kafka in Yiddish, Kafka and Yiddish". Unfortunately, I had
to leave early due to a prior commitment. During the part that I did hear,
there was some commotion in the audience, when Ms. Blau quoted Kafka's
father using an expression "meshugener ritekh" - nobody, including the
speaker, seemed to know the meaning of the word "ritekh". The only
explanation Ms. Blau had, was that it must be of Hebrew origin. I wonder,
maybe it has been discussed later, when I have already left? In any case,
does anybody know exactly what or who this "ritekh" is?

Subject: shmendrik and shmegege

I was wondering about the etymology of the words
"shmendrik" and "shmegege."

Subject: mezinke

Can anyone provide the etymology of the word "mezinke" meaning "youngest
daughter" which my Yiddish speaking neighbour born in Belz (then Poland now
Ukraine) tells me should really be pronounced more like "mozhinke". It
sounds to me like a Slavonic loan word but I could not find it in the
Polish or Russian dictionaries which I consulted. Is it possibly originally
Ukrainian? The song/dance of that name was composed by Max Warschawsky who
was born in Odessa in 1840 and died in Kiev in 1907, which might suggest
this origin.

Subject: Zog nit keynmol

Dear list-members,

As part of my dissertation project I am researching the post-war reception
of Hirsh Glik's song Zog nit keynmol (in English often referred to as
"Never Say" or "Partisan hymn", in Hebrew Shir Hapartisanim).

It would be great if you could answer me some short questions and/or
forward this message to friends.

Here are the questions:

1. When did you hear / sing Zog nit keynmol for the first time and in which
context?

2. On which occasions did you sing it / do you sing it or listen to it now?
In what ways has it been performed (choir - soloist; as march or as a folk
song.) An in which language/s?

3. Which have been the most moving/impressive performances you attended?

4. If you are a musician - is the song part of your repertoire? How do you
interpret it, on which occasions do you perform it and how does your
audience relate to it?

5. And last but not least: What does this song mean to you? Which events,
memories, stories, people, emotions, moods, images, political ideas etc. do
you connect with it?

Please indicate your age, place of birth and current place of residence,
and if you have a background in Yiddish.

*****

I am also grateful for all information on contemporary adaptations of the
song (or references to it) in Jazz, Contemporary Music, Nu-Folk etc.

Thank you all very much in advance for your help - mit a hartsikn dank un
vareme grusn.

Anna Lipphardt

Subject: Re: spodek

"Spodek" in Polish is a saucer.  Also, in Yiddish, a fur cap -- perhaps
because the cap looked like a saucer?  "Don't bang on my head."

Subject: Saul Bellow and Yiddish

In the discussion of Saul Bellow's relation to Yiddish, a question not
discussed is the extent to which Yiddish influenced his writing, either in
the stories told, his language patterns, or his logic, among other possible
influence that a second language can have on a writer. I would be
interested in anyone's thoughts on this matter.

Cyril Robinson
