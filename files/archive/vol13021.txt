Subject: RE: yovn

Sylvia Schildt's remarks (Mendele 13.019) are very interesting, however I
am skeptical about her allusion to the Russian-Greek interplay. The
counter-example is 'Fonye Ganef', the marvelous epithet that was first
applied to our Good Friend Czar Nicholas I (zoln zayne beyner farfoylt
vern).

Subject: Re: yovn

In my mame-loshn (litvakish) "yovn" was the standard designation of a
soldier, which accounts for its use in the saying "Ale yevonim hobn eyn
ponim" (All soldiers have the same face, i.e. look alike). The plural
clearly indicates the Hebrew provenance of the word. That is why the linkage
to "Ivan" is rather spurious. The identification of soldiers with Greeks
most probably reflects the historic reality of Greek rule in Eretz Israel.

Subject: Re: shnorer

a schnorrer is eyner vos klept zikh tsu tsu an anders tish oder keshene mit
on farbetung.  Given that a "leech"  and a "parasite" klepn zikh tsu mit on
farbetung makes both words good english equivalents for "schnorrer."  A
mooch or moocher also fits the category.  Flexner in his dictionary of
American slang says "one who begs, chisels or depends on the generosity of
others for his living.."

Subject: Re: shnorer

I've read the various "definitions" of "schnorer" but they don't include an
element that distinguished the "schnorer" from other who were seeking
handouts. The schnorer looked at himself as one who was doing you a favor.
It was a "mitzvah" to give to those in need.  However, some people did not
want to give. The "schnorer", by his insistence and persistence" was,
therefore, helping you fulfill the commandment and was, therefore, doing you
a favor.

Subject: Re: shnorer and yovn

I had written to Dr. Bershady distinguishing between a shnorer and a betler,
but I gave a different definition of each. In essence, a man who stands on
the street and sticks his hand out is a betler. A shnorer always seeks a
nedove. This doesn't means anyone seeking a nedove is a shnorer: one who
does so for an institution or a chevre (hakhnoses kala, for example) is a
sh'liakh. I, like many Jews who live in a traditionally Jewish ambience have
a personal shnorer. He comes about once a month to my door and I give him 20
shekels. He is poor and begs to support his family; that is his profession,
so to speak.

As for Yovn, this word has the meaning of goyim in general and not in a
friendly sense. There is a Yiddish proverb: "Ale Yevonim hobn ayn ponim".

I find that inquiries regarding Yiddish words in Mendele tend more and more
to focus on their occasional use in English. Their use among Jews whose
everyday vernacular is Yiddish  is often different and, it seems to me, more
clearly defined, with less ambiguities.

Subject: New book: Yiddish glosses

If the call for announcing one1s own books isn1t followed by authors, others
will have to do so.

Last year an edition of Yiddish glosses to the book of Job from the
14th-16th century appeared. The volumes are edited by Walter R”ll with the
assistance of Gabriele Bruennel, Maria Fuchs, Liliane Gehlen, Heidi
Stern-Schulze and Carla Winter (Tuebingen: Niemeyer).

Yiddish glosses in Hebrew codices are important for research on early
Yiddish language and Ashkenazic culture, but editions are few and far
between. This edition is a milestone and although it comes at an
understandably hefty price, the edition - based on  9 manuscripts and two
printed books - is a must for every university library with a Yiddish
collection. The edition is published in two volumes. The first volume (381
pp.) contains introductory chapters as well as a series of word registers,
the second volume (835 pp.) contains the edition proper. The concise and
clear introductory chapters deal with the texts from which the glosses were
taken, but also with topics like vocalism, morphology, lexicon, Yiddish
Bible translation language, etc. The editor gives the glosses in their
original spelling in square characters, but also in a transcription which
not only makes the glosses accessible to Germanists and scholars in Jewish
Studies who don1t know Yiddish, but also gives Yiddish scholars an informed
interpretation of the pronunciation based on the current state of research.
The division in two volumes makes it easier for the user to consult the
edition and the registers simultaneously. It is also enjoyable just to
browse either the registers in the first volume (which, like the registers
in other editions, are extremely useful even for those not interested in
glosses but in Old and Middle Yiddish literature as long as we don1t have an
Old Yiddish dictionary) or the glosses in the second and immerse oneself in
the world of Old and Middle Yiddish and traditional ashkenazic Bible study.

Subject: Lebedoff's "Rumenye"

I had two versions of his 78 rpm recordings back (I believe) in the late
1940's.  One recording was on one side of the disc and the other was on both
sides.  I was enthralled by the longer version on both sides and took the
trouble to listen to it over and over again while attempting to write down
the words.  I was not totally successful because some of what he sang was in
very rapid Rumanian - a language I don't know.  For the Rumanian words I
wrote down what I heard but it is only an approximation of the correct
lyric.  I did much better with the brief Russian segment [KHOTCHET LYUBIT,
KHOTCHET DYEVKA, NI KOPEKI, DYENGI NYET!] inasmuch as I'm moderately
familiar with the language.  The bracketed segment in the previous sentence
can be loosely translated as "I have love, a young girl, no kopeks, no
money!"  Incidentally - this longer two-sided version was ultimately put
onto an LP and possibly on a CD.  You can check that out with Robert
Freedman who runs this marvelous website
http://oldsite.library.upenn.edu/etext/collections/freedman/index.html by
writing to him at yidsong@pobox.upenn.edu.

As for the Yiddish words - even there I had to guess, in one or two spots,
as to what he was singing owing to the rapidity of his delivery and the
primitive nature of the recording.  But I'm fairly certain that the Yiddish
words that I transcribed are at least 95% correct.  Finally - in one spot,
following the "HOP, HOP, HOP, HOP, HA" he sings something that was, to me,
totally unintelligible {SHTATN YATN HAPN PAPN, CHIDL DI PAPN - HA}.
Wherever something was _that_ bad I put it into brackets { }.  I had to do
that in only two other places: TANTST MEYDLAKH HULYET HOPET {nem dem lopne
nombe shaye}, MAZL TOV {es rule shoshe, fan dar maydl} KHAYIM YOSEF.  This
will make much more sense if you can obtain (or if you already have) the
longer version and you try to follow my transcription as you listen to it.
I am relaying the transcribed lyrics to you both in an attachment to this
message and also pasted below.  My transcription is a labor of love (done
when I was about 18 years old) rather than an academic exercise.  I leave it
to the academicians to correct my _toesn_ and to fill in what I couldn't
hear in the unintelligible spots.  If any Lebedoff lover in academia would
indeed fill in what is missing here I would be supremely grateful to receive
a copy of a corrected text.
