Subject: A Clarification and a Technical Refinement

1.  The review suggestion I made in my "Friendly Critique and a
Pracical Proposal" (Vol. 4.197) is applicable only to text in
Yiddish.

This was self-evident since the friendly critique referred to a posting
in what the writer naively, albeit innocently, assumed to be Yiddish.
Still, it is necessary to make this absolutely clear to avoid wrong
interpretations.

2.  To obviate the need of an E-mail back-and-forth exchange between
Mendele's moderator and the writer of a posting--first requesting
permission to review and, in return, granting it--I respectfully suggest
that the author of a communication who wishes his or her Yiddish text
reviewed prior to publication, start the message with a double R,  for
Review Requested, in square brackets, thus [RR].

This will flag the moderator of the author's wish and _permission_ to
proceed in such a fashion.

3.  The flag [RR] will promptly be deleted, so nobody, except the author,
will know that a review was done.  Thus no stigma whatsoever will attach
to an [RR] request.

New or even published authors constantly consult and confer with editors
about style, ideas, or suggested changes.  (Personal: In my lifetime I
always learned from my many editors, and to this day I often consult a
very dear friend for editorial advice.)

A request by a Mendelyaner for an anonymous review might be considered in
a true sense part of our ongoing learning process, a commendable
characteristic of our khavruse.

Subject: Zellig Bach's "friendly critique"

I didn't find this critique at all friendly; in fact, it was painfull (to
use Bach's own spelling).  The purpose of language should be
communication, not gate-keeping-- certainly not gate-keeping in a
voluntary association of people with common interests.  If Bach finds it
"painfull" to read Yiddish with "errors" let him skip through to the
messages written in English.  When I received letters in English from my
grandmother, I cherished them for their content, and recognized her
Yiddishized English as a sign of who she was--an immigrant who learned
English in night school and in the give-and-take of everyday life.  Many
of the participants in Mendele are such immigrants to Yiddish. Let them
express themselves as they will and can, rather than submit their
correspondence to a board of judges and editors before they can be heard
in their own voices. Mendele--of all public organs--certainly does not
need to stamp its submissions "dozvoleno tsenzuroyu" as in the days of
the czars.

Subject: Re: A friendly critique and a practical proposal

Zelig Bach almost certain intended his comments on someone who submitted
a poorly written Yiddish posting to be helpful, but I'll bet two groschen
that that person is now sufficiently embarrassed not to try and post
again. So no matter what Zelig's intentions were, I think it turned out
to be a negative act.  Embarrassing a person is like shedding blood...

Perhaps I empathize because every now and then I get zinged for doing
some damn fool thing or asking a dumb question about Yiddish, aber ich
hob beitzim vie eisin (I don't know the word for "brass") so I don't give
a damn if I do it clumsily or elegantly.  I just want to keep trying and
if it comes out lousy and someone wants to help me privately, that is
terrific.  But to do it publicly on the board like it is some kind of
humiliating disgrace is unworthy and unnecessary.

I think the action of this board should be to accept anything at all,
anything and _everything_ that some brave soul tries to put into clumsy,
halting Yiddish and reach out a cooperative hand rather than make that
person feel like a schmuck, even if the intent was not to make that
person feel like a schmuck.

How else will people trying to learn, do so?

It is no disgrace to speak Yiddish badly, write it poorly but, with all
that, to keep on trying.  I can no more see criticizing someone for a
poorly constructed Yiddish posting than I would comment on the English
language capability of some of our Russian immigrants.  I spend half my
time telling them how terrific they are, not crushing their spirits by
saying I can hardly understand a word they say.  What useful purpose is
served by such a klopf to the zeitim?  And if this last sentence is not
gramatically or orthographically correct, correct me privately and I will
love you for it.  Zing me in public and we shall have troubles.

It seems to me that, from time to time, some of the people out in Mendele
land must be my brothers and sisters because they toss guilt around like
my mother did.  Thus they must have learned it from her and have to be
related to me.

In the final analysis, one learns better with encouragement, not with a
chamalye in punim.

Subject: The minyen

Zellig Bach:

One rainy Friday evening, many years ago, while walking past a one of a
number of "shtiblekh" on Cecil Street in Toronto, I was literally
hijacked for a minyen. This time, I volunteer. If we can really  several
others wCount me in. I'd simply ask that my service be delayed for a few
months. I'm working against a deadline to finish Volume III.

Subject: Help with Yiddish

There is much merit to Zellig Bach's proposal that there be a means for
some of us to improve our Yiddish in our written communications to
Mendele. (Obviously, alas, we cannot concern ourselves here with the
niceties of a good, native Yiddish accent in our spoken Yiddish.) As one
who built up whatever competence he has in the language rather late in
life, I, for one, am very much aware of my deficiencies and would be
grateful for help.

The problem is not so much in spelling, one item emphasized by Zellig.
(We have had much discussion on YIVO roman transcription and
transliteration, and an outline of the system is now readily available to
all of us.) What we observe quite often is distortions in morphology
(word-structure) and syntax. That is, some of our contributors bravely
write messages in Yiddish while suffering considerable interference from
their native languages or, perhaps, other languages that they know.

I am, then, in favor of taking advantage of a few volunteers who are
willing to give some of their time to helping us with our Yiddish. I am,
however, very much _against_ the notion that _all_ messages written in
Yiddish should be submitted to a panel for possible editing before being
sent out to the list. I propose that submission to copy-editing be purely
voluntary. Let some kind of flag be attached to a message by a writer who
wants Shames Noyekh to have the item edited. I hasten to add that I do
hope that the kind editors will not be overwhelmed by too much work.

At the same time, let the policy be that all relevant and civil
contributions, in English or Yiddish, edited or unedited, will be
welcome. That is, anyone who wishes to write in Yiddish without the help
of an editor shall be entirely free to do so.
