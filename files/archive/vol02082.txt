Subject: Pesye - Pesach?

Mikhl Herzog asks about the origin of the name Pesye: I
don't know, but my intuition is that the origin is Pesah
(Pesach).

Subject: For M. Herzog: pessl/bessl

The new book of Heinrich Guggenheimer on Jewish names
(Ktav: 1992) hasn't arrived yet, so the only information I
have:

Among German Jews the "bessl" name is quite frequent. Some
believe that it comes from Hebrew "bas" ==> "basl" little
daughter. You decide whether this is relevant. The
unscholarly "Jewish names and their History" by B. Kaganoff
(Schocken books) on p. 184. mentions the pesl/bessl
connection.

Subject: RE: Germans

Dear NMiller, Many thanks for the citations. The first
chapter of Di Brider Ashkenazi also has that well known
wonderful description of the German & Jewish weavers
entering Lodz.Your help is greatly appreciated.

Subject: germans in y. lit.

for dvosye (2. 79): there are a lot of Germans in Y.Y.
Zinger's _Di brider ashkenazi_   Of he German balagule on
p. {74 of the 3rd ed. (1951), the merrymaking khsidim who
are overcrowding his coac and  hurting his horse, say
"Veyser vos a goy a beheyme redt...."   The author doesn't
flatter the khsidim, as you recall.  The novel begins with
the Saxon weavers moving East towards the village that
becomes Lodz.    I presume you want to know about real
Germans and not about "Germans" -- Jews who wear short
coats,no beards, etc.

Subject: scatological
 
"Ich bin von drueben."
 
When asked "Woher sind Sie, Herr X.?" ('Where are you from,
Mr. X.?'), a Galician Jew, X., in the pre-World War years
might have playfully replied: 'Ah, ich bin von
hollandischen Adel" ('I'm from the Dutch nobility').
"Wieso denn?" ('How is that?').  "Ich bin von drueben."
 
This "joke" was told to me in September 1992 by Ernst
Redlich, now of Haifa, Israel, formerly of Berlin, whose
father was from Krakow and whose mother was from Przemysl.
E.R. doesn't know Yiddish very well and until recently was
somewhat hostile towards the language.  I had just returned
from Galicia, which is what sparked his recollection of
what he thought a witty bit.  He thought the humor came
from the sound resemblance of the German words _von_ and
_drueben_ to a hypothetical Dutch name like Van Dribben.
The German is pleonastic, e.g. 'I'm from on the other side'
-- one normally wouldn't use von + drueben.  What E.R.
wasn't aware of and what has now occurred to me is that G.
_drueben_ puns fairly well with Yiddish _dripen_, 'to
shit', whether or not the bilabial in _drueben_ is devoiced
or not.  The contrast between blue blood and defecation
couldn't be starker (or shtarker!).

This joke seems to laugh at Jewish attempts to pass as
non-Jewish or to put on airs.  Thousands of Galician Jews
moved westward, to Vienna especially.  Ost-Juden collided
with native German-speakers.  A vast number of jokes was
born of this contact.  But the linguistic play may be
partly lost to us. Will somebody who knows the above comic
turn, or any like it, comment. Can the linguistic atlas
tell us something about the distribution of _dripen_?  Is
there necessarily a scatological connection here?
 
Dictionaries consulted:
Harkavi:  dripen = drisken = 'to shit' , p. 179.
MEYYED :  dripen 'drip, ooze'
Oytser :  dripen* = kakn*  p. 406, # 417 oysshaydung
