Subject: Bokser

Daniella HarPaz:

I'm afraid you were misled in school re the word "bokser" for carob.  It
is not English.  The West European languages have 2 names for this fruit,
one is "Saint John's bread", "pain de st. Jean", "SanktJohannesbrod",
etc. since that  is what he supposedly ate in the desert (NT), the other
is a traditional term, English carob, etc.  The older German term was
"Bockshorn", the "Bock" (English ~ 'buck') apparently a specific  species
of European deer.  (I think it's the same 'bock' as in bock beer [how to
say that in Yiddish?])  The latter term for 'carob' wound up in my
father's Yiddish as 'boksaw'.  I don't know how it is spelled in Yiddish
or what the literary pronunciation is.  All I know is that my father had
an enormous Yiddish vocabulary that I hardly ever heard him use, and he
often used the term for the carob shed every year by the trees on our
street in Riverside. He told me he and his fellow steet urchins from
pre-WWI Chicago used to chew on the 'boksaw' they found there.  It was
definitely a Yiddish, not English word, in his vocabulary.  By the way,
he pronounced 'bok' like buck, 'saw' like saw (midwestern open o!).

Subject: A Yiddish/Hebrew Typesetting Machine

About three years ago I tried to place the Yiddish Book Center in touch
with a man in Detroit who was trying to give away a Yiddish/Hebrew
typesetting machine along with about 75 trays of various sized Hebrew
type.  So I wrote the YBC in Massachussets a letter at a fortuitous time
because they had just published a thing in Pakn Treger about their find
of such a machine in NY and how they shlepped it up to Massachussets. I
figured, at a minimum they could use spare parts.  Besides these things
cost a fortune and I was trying to give it away.

Never got an answer from the YBC, so I wrote again saying, "Do you want a
free Yiddish typesetting machine that works?"  No answer.  Not, "No, we
don't want it."  Just no answer.

So I gave up.  But I just saw reference to the YBC on this board and
figured maybe somebody on the list knows if they might want such a thing,
though I have not spoken to the guy who owns it in three years.  I don't
think he's had a lot of offers but how do you junk something that weighs
a million pounds and only speaks Yiddish?

Subject: Kristlen un yidlen

Moshe Waldoks may be right in attributing the proverb "Es yidlt zikh vi
es kristelt zikh" to Heinrich Heine (4.219), but the German proverb and
quotation dictionaries that I was able to consult list it, if at all,
only as a German-Jewish proverb: "Wie es sich juedelt, so christelt es
sich."  (One refers to Abraham Tendlau's collection, _Sprichwoerter und
Redensarten deutsch-juedischer Vorzeit_, Frankfurt/a/M, 1860.)

Yisroel Furman's collection _Yidishe shprikhverter un rednsartn_
(Tel-Aviv, 1968) includes the Yiddish version cited above as #800 and
explains:  "yidn tuen nokh di nisht-yidn fun zeyer svive (shprakh,
kleyder, minhogim, nemen ukhdoyme."  Furman traces the proverb to a
quotation from the _Sefer khasidim_ of Reb Yehude Hekhosid [R. Judah
he-Hasid of Regensburg, c. 1150-1217]:  "Kemo sheminhag hanokhrim keyn
minhag hayehudim" ("Vi azoy s'iz der minheg bay kristn azoy iz der minheg
bay di yidn").

Subject: Vi es kristilt

I have used this expression to summarize the sociological view that the
behavior of the Jews in diaspora communities mirrors the behavior of the
dominant Christian society.

Subject: A lied

Does anyone know about the song "Oy,ir kleine likhtelekh" which I found in
the back of a chanukkah anthology? It is written by Morris Rosenfeld and
Sonia Cheifetz, but no dates or bibliographical details are given. It is
quite a pretty little song.

Subject: Yakov Berliner

In reply to Sheine Mankovsky's inquiry, there is a brief article about
him in J.S. Hertz, "Doyres Bundistn", Undzer Tsayt, New York, 1956, pp.
271-272.

Subject: Apology to Marion Aptroot

I've been out for a while and am just checking my mail. A couple of
people have written me and I'm unable to answer because my disk
accidentally got purged. Fortunately, what khaverte Marion wrote was in a
posting, so I was able to retrieve the message and now I can reply. What
I think I'm most guilty of here is carelessness in general, and
especially about attibuting a confused statement to her. Marion is
clearly right about where the logic of what I said takes one, to the
conclusion that the disappearance of 80% of Dutch Jewry meant the extinc-
tion of the underworld. Obviously I'm wrong, if I meant that!

As far as origin theories for Yiddish, maybe I should reemphasize that it
seems *plausible* that *part* of the reason there is more loshn-koydesh
vocabulary in Western Yiddish is the connection with cattle trading and
the desire to hide meaning from gentiles through a sort of "jargon" (and
I don't mean the East European use of "zhargon" to name Yiddish).

What I think is happening here is that there are many different sorts of
folks on this list, some of whom are scholars, others in the beginning
stages of learning, who are not necessarily of an intellectual bent. I
suppose in my case a little knowledge can be a bad thing, because I don't
know what Marion means when she says "since J.W. and Itzik Feitel Stern".
We have, as I said, a mixed bag on this list. This sort of thing is going
to happen. Myself included, we need to be more cautious and tentative
when we assert something in a moment of enthusiasm. I must say, for me,
that I am of a romantic temperament and that's going to go on no matter
what, realistically, but I can curb it. The danger, obviously, is that
someone will take what I say as gospel and add it to their repertory of
Yiddish knowledge.

Well, I'm going to end this message by saying, Marion, I'm sorry I put
those words in your mouth. What I was remembering was a while back when I
made I made a connection between the Dutch "sjofel" and the Yiddish word
"shoufl" and that you had said to me that it may have come into Dutch
through thieves' jargon. I no longer have the text at hand, unfortunately.
My motivation was actually the other way around, that I wanted to give
you credit for something you had said to me off the list. I put my foot
in my mouth and I apologize.

Let's all try to be more careful in our communications, especially with
the diverse group we have here.
