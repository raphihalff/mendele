Subject: Di nevuret

I'm jumping into the discussion without context (I've been away and
haven't caught up with all the recent Mendele postings). M. Herzog
refers to Neiman's question about "nevura" in Polish Yiddish. This must
be _di nevuret_.  The _vuret_ part is clear:  vorhayt--> vurhayt with
neutralization of -hayt as in a number of other words with this no
longer productive suffix in Yiddish (the woman's name _frumet/frimet_ >
_frumhayt_).  Where the _ne-_ comes from is beyond me.

Subject: Nevura

I will venture a guess that nevura is from the daitshmerish vare
(feminine) meaning reality. In Yiddish the a becomes o in
Litvish/standard Yiddish, and u in'Polish" yiddish. In some words, the n
from the indefinite article  a/an gets stuck onto the folowing word that
it was supposed to modify; thus neveire is a form of aveire - sin.
Thephenomenon can go the other way as well, as in the word naranja,
which was assumed to be 'an orange' (spanish). Dr. Schaechter in
'Laitish Mame-Loshn', page 110, lists emes, voret and nevoret as
synonyms for truth

Subject: Nevura

Here's another try at answering Jeff Neiman's inquiry about the word
_nevura_ (6.187).  In commenting on _daytshmerizmen_ in _Yidishe
shprakh_ 33 (1974):55, Mordkhe Schaechter mentions two words used in
Polish Yiddish:  _vuret_ and _nevuret_, from _vorhayt_ 'truth' (cf.
German _Wahrheit_).  Is this perhaps the word that JN's parents brought
with them from Lodz?

Subject: Poetry of Yehoash and Zukofsky

Lisa Tomlinson's inquires about the influence of Yehoash and other
Yiddish poets on Louis Zukofsky [6.169].  Perhaps there are some clues
in the unpublished papers of Zukofsky's Objectivist colleague Charles
Reznikoff, which are housed in the Archive for New Poetry in the Special
Collections of the library at University of California San Diego.
Included is a Yiddish manuscript of the memoir of his father, Nathan
Reznikoff, which provided the basis for the poet's "Early History of a
Sewing Machine Operator" (1936).  The archive also apparently contains
Reznifkoff's correspondence with Zukofsky and an unpublished article
about him.  I have taken my information from the UCSD Special
Collection's website:

<http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/speccoll/testing/mscl-fa1.html>

Reznikoff was married to Marie Syrkin, daughter of the early socialist
Zionist ideologue Nachman Syrkin.  In addition to a distinguished career
as a journalist and academic, Marie Syrkin published English
translations of Yiddish poetry (according to Encyclopedia Judaica --
I've never seen her translations).  Besides a substantial body of
poetry, fiction, and family memoirs, Charles Reznikoff was co-author of
a history, "The Jews of Charleston" (Philadelphia:  Jewish Publication
Society, 1950).

Subject: Serdatsky's "Lilien"

Ephraim Mose Lilien (1874-1925) was a very 'productive' artist. Many
books and magazines contain his drawings, most of them are inspired by
biblical persons and jewish daily life. However I have never seen one
titled :The Queen of the Night", a title somewhat unusual for him.

Dr.Mark Gelber of the Ben-Gurion University, Beer-Sheva, Israel did a
lot of work on Lilien. You could ask him about this Queen.

Independent of the question, whether Serdatsky' Lilien has anything to
do with E.M.Lilien, one could wish to see Liliens beautiful drawings and
book illustrations. Two recent books contain many of them:

. Ostjuedische Geschichten, edited by Ulf Diederichs, Eugen Diederichs
Verlag, Muenchen, 1988 4th ed. ISBN3-424-00953-9.

. E.M.Lilien: Briefe an seine Frau, 1905-1925. edited by Otto M.Lilien and
Eve Strauss. Juedischer Verlag Atheneum, Koenigstein, 1985. ISBN 3-7610-0369-2.

Subject: Serdatsky's "Lilien"

Thank you for all your responses.  I have no doubt that the artist is
the person I'm looking for (I just wanted to narrow down the
field--other possibilities included Lily Pons and Lilio, a renaissance
Italian painter).  Mendele is certainly an excellent tool for this sort
of query.

Subject: Serdatsky's "Lilien"

It is possible that the Lilien refered to by Yenta Serdatsky is not the
famous artist E. M. Lilien at all. The _Leksikon fun der nayer yidisher
literatur_ lists two Liliens: Izidor Lilien (1882-1960), an actor and
"farfaser fun 1- un 2-aktike 'sketshes," tsu velkhe er hot aleyn
geshribn oykh lidlekh tsum zingen, di azoy gerufene 'liriks'." He sounds
like a good candidate. There was also a poet, R.Z. Lilien, pseudonym of
Lilien Robinzon-Zangvil (b.1900). She was from Omaha and started writing
in Yiddish in 1930. Also possible. Unfortunately, I deleted the original
query, so I don't remember the entire context of the reference to
Lilien.
