Subject: a zisn pesakh?

Lee Dembart writes in [07.183]: "And regardless of what you think about
transliterated dictionaries, a zisn pesakh to all." 

"A zisn pesakh"? I admit that I have heard this expression before but can
anyone tell me its origin? Fraylich, kosher ... OK. But how is sweetness
associated davka with pesakh? Rosh hashono is associated with sweetness, as in
"shana tova u-metuka", but pesakh? 

Pesakh kasher v'sameakh to all.

Subject: nokh a mol kurva: yidish un portugalish

Ellen Prince shraybt: "the Bulgarian word for 'whore' is _kurva_. Will it now
be claimed that Yiddish may have infiltrated Bulgarian as it's been claimed to
have infiltrated Old Church Slavonic?"

Efsher iz do an andere farbindung.  Etlekhe yor tsurik ikh bin geveyn in
drom-portugal. In der gegnt s'iz geveyn a beyg in veyg. Bayem beyg iz
geshtonen a hoyz mit a shild, "Casa de la Curva." 

A freylekhe un gezinte peysekh tsu alen.

Alan Shuchat

PS As I recall, this was near the town of Tevira. In the same general area,
there was a road sign indicating the way to "Sinagoga." We went in that
direction for quite a distance, but found neither a shul nor a town named
Sinagoga. Any ideas as to what this could have been?

Subject: Yiddish in the Ukraine

Many of Bob Poe's questions (07.183) are answered in my article "Yiddish in
the Ukraine" which appeared in _The Field of Yiddish III_, edited by Herzog,
Ravid, and Weinreich (Mouton & Co. 1969). A series of maps depicting the
distribution of numerous features will help locate the areas in which
particular towns are likely to be found. The same volume includes articles on
Belorussian Yiddish (Uriel Weinreich), and Western Yiddish (Steven
Lowenstein), and a major work on regional variation in the Yiddish case and
gender systems (Meyer Wolf).

Subject: Olaskov

Bob Poe asked about the dialect in Olaskov [07.183].

I was delighted to find a landsman! My mother was also from Olaskov, but fled
with her family in 1918 after some terrible pogroms and they eventually made
their way to USA in 1921 after many adventures. Since you gave no dates or
names, I have no basis for comparison. We were the Bilmes-Anbinder family.
Olaskov was on the Bug river (pronounced Beeg) across from Krivoye Ozera (in
Yiddish: Krivozere, changed by the Soviets to Pervomaysk) in the region near
Uman.

Most of your observations are correct - toteh, momeh, but - af der politse,
afn tish;  arifgeyn - but - tsenoyf;  ekh for oykh; gleyb for gloyb.  If it
weren't for my husband Dr Mordkhe Schaechter I wouldn't have found you!  Hope
to hear again soon.

Subject: "wiped off the map"

A recent posting on Mendele contains the following:

"the village no longer exists!  (It was called [...] and was destroyed in 
WW II.)"

I've heard this said innumerable times by innumerable people re Eastern
European places of Jewish origin (not by Eastern European-born individuals,
but by their children or grandchildren).  Also the phrase "this town/shtetl/
village was wiped off the map."  I've always struggled to understand exactly
what these mean, i.e. what people believe is the actual status of these "no
longer existing" places. Anyone who uses these phrases, please enlighten me.
(I understand that the Jewish population and Jewish institutions of those
places were destroyed, no longer exist, or that areas that once had dorf or
shtetl status have been incorporated into other villages/towns/cities since
WWII, but these are different statements.)

Subject: ABC versus alef-beyz

Im Mendele 07.182 Sylvia Schildt laments that people who profess an interest
in Yiddish are not prepared to learn to read the original script.  I agree
with a lot of what she says, BUT: 

She was responding to a request for suggestions for transliterated
dictionaries and I would maintain that there is a need for these dictionaries.
Let me say why I am also looking. 

My interest in Yiddish has no obvious cause; I am not, for instance, from a
Jewish family. In order to read it I spent a lot of time looking for good
dictionaries. Most of what bookshops wanted to order for me was in
transliteration and I more or less turned my nose up, even if I did buy one or
two. 

Then I started subscribing to Mendele. I also received the Mendele Review,
complete with literature. Suddenly I needed transliterated dictionaries
because even with quite a lot of imagination and a lot of work trying out all
the alef-beyz spellings I considered possible, I still couldn't find all of
the words I needed in my alef-beyz dictionaries. Not so long ago I would
probably have needed such a dictionary a couple of times to be able to read
Sylvia Schildt's letter. 

Incidentally, in reading transliterated Yiddish I have come to realise how
many words I can read in Hebrew script without knowing how to pronounce them
because I understood them in context but never looked them up, because I found
them in a dictionary without a guide to the pronunciation or because my memory
fails me. Transliteration does me good! 

Since reading electronic Yiddish I have come to value the not particularly
comprehensive paperback dictionary published by Duden which is only
Yiddish-German. It omits most of the vocabulary that is easily understood by
the German-speaking readership it was produced for in order to make room for
more words of Slavonic and Semitic origin. The transliteration is very
"German", but you get used to that. (Loetzsch, Ronald: "Jiddisches
Woerterbuch", Dudenverlag 1992, ISBN 3-411-06241-X).

I would like to find information on who holds the copyright for the Yiddish
works of the following Yiddish writers: Yankev Glatshteyn, Itsik Manger, and
Kadye Molodowsky.  I also wonder if anyone can tell me who would hold the
copyright for hertz Grosbard's recordings.  The one I have is published by
EAV--Educational Audio Visual in Pleasantville, NY but I can't seem to track
them down. 

Since none of the likely organizations seems to keep a list of these things, I
would be quite willing to keep a list of who holds the copyright for various
Yiddish writers.  It seems silly to have to reinvent the wheel each time we
need such information if someone has already gone through the often
complicated process of finding out.  Do send me any information you have on
copyrights for any Yiddish writer, good, bad, or indifferent, and I'll see
that the proper institutions have a copy so that people needing this
information can readily find it.  Happy Peysakh to all.
