Subject: balebos and boss

Concerning baleboste and bal(e)bos it would be interesting to investigate
wheter they have some link to the international word, also in colloquial
Hebrew word "boss". The common etymology is though from the Dutch "baas"
(master). But would it be too far-fetched to maintain the English "boss"
and/or the Dutch "baas" stemmed from the false part of the Hebrew-Yiddish
of "balebos" (the part meaning "house" instead of the part meaning
"master")?

Subject: baleboste and other ladies

An interesting aside was something that I once heard from a chassidic
friend of mine (he's a Belzer but from a Spinker family) who referred to
one of his customers as being very nice for an areyliste (or in his
Galitzianer/Hungarian pronunciation arayliste). I asked him what that was?

It seems that a term for gentile is "orel" or "urel", from "aral" ayin
resh lamed in Hebrew, which means "uncircumcised". This has been
feminized in their dialect to arayliste like balebos to balebuste or
mekhutn to makhteyniste. So there is actually a Yiddish word for a
"female uncircumcised person".

Actually, I believe the standard account is that it's from bal-ha-bayis
(<ba'al ha-bayith), 'master [of]-the-house', plus the Aramaic feminine
suffix -te. The lack of an overt term for 'of' is very common in many
languages and the phrase-type is generally known as the appositive
genitive.

Subject: Re: kayn shum hant

I disagree with Gertrude Dubrovsky [Mendele 14.036]. here is my take on the
verse:

Hant is a broad pronunciation of haynt = today [or here used as today =
now]. Lots of Yiddish speakers pronounced it that way. So "unemployment is
absolutely not in existence now/today" in this new free land.

Subject: "Greetings From Home"

We have a question about the following Yiddish play: "Greetings from Home"
by Sam Auerbach and Heshel Schor.  It was performed at Glicksman's Palace
Theater in Chicago January 6-10, 1926(?).  Cast: Bertha Gersten, Sadie
Shoengold, Morris Kranech and Sam Auerbach

Does anyone know of the location of a manuscript for this play?

This is Miryem-Khaye Seigel writing with an inquiry about two poems:

"Nakht" fun Moyshe-Leyb Halpern
(Published  in 1916, 1919 un 1927)

"A mayse fun a hundert" fun Arn-Glants Leyeles
(Published in 1921)

I have already looked in books in YIVO and CYCO and not found them. If you
happen to know where to find these two poems I would be very grateful.

Please answer me at this address:
yidassist@yivo.cjh.org

Thank you,
Miryem-Khaye Seigel

Subject: kuni-leml

After searching the Mendele archive (via Google, since the Archive page
didn't work for me), I believe this question has not been addressed
previously.

What is the meaning/derivation of "kuni" in the term for innocent
fool/dope/dupe, kuni-leml? (Leml is a little lamb, of course. The term
kuni-leml appears first in the additional words section of Harkavy's 1928
edition.)

One suggestion I've received: "kuni" is a synonym for "lom," lame. Which
might make sense, since a synonym for "kuni-leml" is "leymener goylem,"
lame fool.
