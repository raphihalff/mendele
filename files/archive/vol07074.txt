Subject: Di Grine Akvaryum

I've been attempting to find the words to *Di Grine Akvaryum* by Setzkever. I
would be most indebted to anyone who could post it (hopefully both in Yiddish
and in English) on Mendele.

Subject: davenen 

In reaction to Gitl Dubrovsky's note on davenen [7.073] I should like to say
that daven does not stem from Hebrew, but from german 'daune' which comes from
the Middle High German word 'don' (or Low German 'dune'). This means: song, 
melody. The word is related to the Dutch word 'deun' which has the same  
meaning. In Dutch this word is still in use. From 'don' also stem the German
word 'Ton', English 'tone' and Dutch 'toon'.

Subject: davenen

The great Yiddish linguist and philologist (sic!) Solomon Birnbaum not too
long ago wrote a wonderful analysis of the etymology of davenen,in Origins of
the Yiddish Language, edited by Dovid Katz (Oxford and NY: Pergamon Press,
1987), pp. 11-14.  He analyzes nine different etymological sources which have
been proposed over the years: Hebrew daf, Lithuanian davana, English dawn,
Latin devovere or divinus, Arabic diwan, Hebrew-Aramaic d-ovinu (all of which
he calls "bizarre, absurd and phonologically impossible", plus Arabic da`wa
and Middle High German doenen, plus a few others tossed in along the way. In
the end he finds every one of these hypotheses to be false and impossible, and
concludes that "The problem of davenen is still waiting to be solved."

I seem to remember a similar discussion somewhere of parev, but can't remember
where or by whom.

Anyone who's got an idea for the etymology of davenen (or other Yiddish words
of mysterious origin) ought to check out Birnbaum's concise discussion, which
I think should be comprehensible to non-specialists, to see what kinds of
factors need to be considered when one wants to evaluate any hypothetical
etymology.

Subject: Food in song

Here is a children's song with a single food in a pivital role. Mayn mame hut
es mir gesungen ven ikh bin geven a kind. I can sing the simple tune, but
alas, not transcribe it. I don't know its title or provenance, but _nisl_,
_niselakh_ or _dray niselakh_ would be my guess for the title. (Why, oh
learned ones, does my ear dictate the insertion of an e in the plural form?) I
may have the words a bit muddled, but the gist is here. (It is that truncated
third stanza that looks suspect.) As food songs go, it doesn't hold a candle
to Roumania, but it is a nice childrens' song. 

mayn mame hut dray niselakh,
dray niselakh gehat.
dray gute, shayne niselakh,
dray niselakh a prakht.

iz ayns geven far berele,
dos tsvayte far khayem shmerele.
dos drite beste nisele,
hut zi gelozt far zikh.

ir vundert zikh bisl,
farvos nisht mir a nisl?

ikh hub aykh opgenart,
ikh hub gevust ir vart,
vayl nisl, nisl, nisele, 
dos nisele bin ikh!

Subject: Yiddish Anarchist songs 

Re David Edelstadt's songs are still sung by Anarchists [7.073].
Well, not sung, but listened to, certainly. My copy of 'Vakht Oyf' and 'In
Kamf' comes from a tape called "Songs of Anarchism and Revolution" (which also
had a Russian [tsarist era] song, titled 'hey! hey! down with the police')
that was produced in the mid-1980s by Spectacular Times (London). I have no
idea about where the sound recordings originally came from (maybe the CIRA
archives in France or switzerland). I think a new compilation of Anarchist
songs (including the ones by Edelshtadt) is in the pipeline. The main source i
have for information on Edelsatadt is an article on the Freie Arbeter Shtime
(of which Edelshtadt was the first editor) in the Cienfuegos Press Anarchist
Review. it gives translations of the two songs listed above.

In Kamf (In Struggle)
We are driven and despised, we are tortured and persecuted, for we
cherish the poor and the weak. We are shot and hanged, robbed of our
lives and our rights, for we demand truth and freedom for downtrodden
slaves. Cast us into your iron chains, tear us apart like bloody beasts
- you can only kill our bodies, you will never destroy our spirit.
Murder us, tyrants, but new fighters will come and we will fight on and
on, until the world is free.

Vakht Oyf! (Awake!)
How long will you remain slaves and wear degrading chains? How long will
you produce riches for those who rob you of your bread? How long will
you stand with backs bent - humiliated, homeless, and weak? It's
daybreak, awake, open your eyes, and see your own strength. Ring the
freedom bells everywhere, gather together the suffering slaves, and
fight for your sacred rights!
[source: Eleanor Gordon-Mlotek Mir Trogn a Gezang (NYC workmens circle
1977, 2nd ed. p80)]

Another possible source is M. Goncharok's 'tsu der geshikhte fun der
anarkhistisher prese ayf Yidish' (1997). In the course of preparing my Yiddish
Anarchist bibliography i've come across a memorial book and what looks like a
standard agitational pamphlet, but no collections of songs. One of our Mendele
subsribers has come across David Edelshtadt befriending his great-grandfather
in Cincinatti in 1883. There's doubtless more information - about his life and
songs - waiting to be tracked down. Any further information would be
appreciated.

Subject: Stalin's applied linguistics and Bund

Both Alexander Maxwell [7.071] and Stan Nadel [7.073] failed the test on an
important linguistico-philological topic: correct dating of the seminal work
by the great linguist and big friend of Yiddish, Comrade Stalin "Marxism and
the National Question" (originaly entitled "Social Democracy and the National
Question"). The essay was written and published in 1913, long before Stalin,
first as the commissar of nationalities and later as the commissar of
everything else, started practical implementation of his and his friends'
linguistical and other theories.

Stalin's definition of nation from this work seems to be well known. Another
excerpt from his article might be of greater interest for this list. It is
also appropriate to quote it now, because Stalin's demagogic attack on Bund
serves as an excellent tribute to the organization, whose 100th anniversary is
celebrated this year.

  Social-Democracy strives to secure for all nations the right to use their
  own language.  But that does not satisfy the Bund; it demands that "the
  rights of the Jewish language" be championed with "exceptional persistence",
  and the Bund itself in the elections to the Fourth Duma declared that it
  would give "preference to those of them (i.e. electors) who undertake to
  defend the rights of the Jewish language."

  Not the general right of all nations to use their own language, but the
  particular right of the Jewish language, Yiddish! Let the workers of the
  various nationalities fight primarily for their own language; the Jews for 
  Jewish, the Georgians for Georgian, and so forth. The struggle for the
  general right of all nations is a secondary matter. You do not have to
  recognize the right of all oppressed nationalities to use their own 
  language; but if you have recognized the right of Yiddish, know that the
  Bund will vote for you, the Bund will "prefer" you.

  But in what way then does the Bund differ from the bourgeois nationalists?
  
The question remains unanswered. Perhaps forever. The Bund was never given a
chance to fully realize its ideas. However, the role Bund played in the Jewish
history of this century in general and in the Yiddish in particular is
difficult to overstate.
