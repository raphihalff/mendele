A plumber by any other name: Maybe someone has another way to express
"plumber" in Yiddish?  We already have rehrenshlosser, instalator and
plumber.

Subject: Graf Potocki (Ger Teysek)

Addendum to questions about Count Valentin Potocki, the Ger Tseydek,
first posed by Norman Rosenblatt [5.207] and answered by Charles Jones
[5.208]:

According to Israel Cohen's, "Vilna" (JPS,1943), Count Potocki, while in
Paris, encountered an old Jew studying Hebrew texts while awaiting
customers in his wine shop. Potocki was much taken with the Jew's
exigesis of the religious texts and convinced him to teach him Hebrew,
afterwhich he left for Amsterdam to convert to Judaism. He returned to
Poland as Avrum ben Avrum, and wandered from town to town, an itinerant
student until he was informed upon in Ilye. Apparently, while he was
studying in the Beys medresh, a child  disturbed him and despite
Potocki's entreaties to stop, the boy continued making a racket. Potocki
threw him out of the Beys medresh and told him that any child who behaved
like that couldn't have been a Jewish child and would surely be baptized
later. The boy ran and told his father,a tailor, who informed the Polish
authorities of Potocki's whereabouts.  After hiding out at an inn, he was
turned over to the Polish authorities, who imprisoned him and eventually
burned him alive for refusing to renounce his conversion. His ashes were
bought on a bribe by a Jew, who arranged to have them buried in the
Jewish cemetery. Many Jews made pilgrimages to the grave and an iron shed
was built over it to protect it from Polish vandals, who apparently had
hacked off branches of a giant tree which grew over the site. There is
also the legend, chronicled in "Mayse Ger Tsedek" (Yohanisberg, Praysn,
1862) and dramatized in Alter Kacyzne's, "Der Dukus," that Potocki cursed
the informer and his descendants, that they should all be stricken with
some deformity. According to A. Litvin, who visited Ilye in 1930 (Ephraim
Jeshurun's Zamlbukh, pp. 841-7), all of the tailor's descendants were
indeed afflicted with some deformity. Though I have seen no mention of
it, it is obvious that any mid-18th century convert to Judaism, who
desired to wander from Beys medresh to Beys medresh in Poland, would have
to learn Yiddish. Since Yiddish wasn't "taught" to the Jews of that
period, it would be most interesting to know how he, or any other
convert, went about learning it. Is any documention available on the
acquisition of Yiddish by converts of that period?

Subject: Hasofe

Philologus's most recent column in The Forward (Jan. 5, 1996) is one of
his very best and should be of particular interest to our company.
Entitled "Splitting Hooves", it lists a number of Yiddish expressions
that can't be fully understood or appreciated without a knowledge of
Jewish religious practices and religious lore.  Examples:

a yor un a mitvokh
azoy vi a hon bney-odom
er trogt zikh arum dermit vi der riboyne-shel-oylem mit der toyre

Then comes the last paragraph:

        I could go on but I wouldn't want you to say, "az m'vil nit dem
        khazen, heyst er zikh nokh gebn a hasofe".  "It's when no one
        wants any more of the cantor that he goes an gives an encore".

Vos mir "encore"?  Surely hasofe means a raise in pay?  Nu, nu.  Zol
shoyn zayn "encore".  If Philologus can repeat such a performance we can
forgive him the occasional wrong note.

Subject: The Yiddish canon

Those Mendelniks who haven't yet seen Harold Bloom's _The Western Canon_
will be pleased to learn that Yiddish has received a hekhsher from the
formidable critic.  Those with long memories might especially enjoy the
fact that this is toyre mi-new-haven, where english literature used to be
in the hands of humbugs like William Lyon Phelps and of whom it can
safely be said az in itstikn moment treyslen zikh mit im di beyner.

Iz dokh gut?  In general, yes.  But the list of canonized writers doesn't
include Sutzkever.  And --more puzzling-- only one book is listed for
Asch and that book is _East River_.  _East River_!!?  Of all the trashy
things Asch wrote, surely only _Uncle Moses_ is worse.

Anyway, Bloom is a fine broth of a lad, but it's a safe bet that he
has read less and thought less about Yiddish literature than have
many of our own readers.  So I propose that we put our collective heads
together and produce a _definitive_ list of canonic works that we can
propose for the inevitable second edition.  The list, wrapped together
with a herring in a copy of the Forverts, will then be delivered to Bloom
at a time and place to be announced (the Yale Faculty Club?).

Nominations are now in order.
