Subject: LC practice on dates

     In response to Zachary Baker's note on 666 wherein he states
that  "The Library of Congress, in  its wisdom,  no  longer  uses
Hebrew letters to represent Hebrew dates ..."

     LC  uses "Western-style arabic numerals for numerals in  the
vernacular" not only  for Hebrew, but  also  for Arabic alphabet,
Far  Eastern, Greek,  Indic,  etc., materials.  This practice  is
based  on Anglo-American Cataloging Rules,  Second Edition,  1988
Revision, rule  C.5A  and  rule  C.5D  which  was adopted by  the
Canadian  Library Association (Ottawa),  the  Library Association
(London), and the American Library Association (Chicago).

     "The above reflects my personal opinion, and not necessarily
that of my employer."

Subject: yiddish shayles, cont.

to all native yiddish speakers:

molly diesing has pointed out a potential problem with the sentences
i asked about, so please substitute the following, in which the 'es'
is optional in 2, 4, and 6. (you can put it in or leave it out,
whichever sounds better--that's not what i'm concerned about.) so,
nokhamol, are the following ok? do some sound better than others?

1. ven/az es geyt a shney, fort er in arbet.

2. geyt (es) a shney, fort er in arbet. (to mean the same as 1)

3. afile ven/az es geyt a shney, fort er in arbet.

4. afile geyt (es) a shney, fort er in arbet. (to mean same as 3)

5. nor ven/az es geyt a shney, fort er in arbet.

6. nor geyt (es) a shney, fort er in arbet. (to mean same as 5)

(i don't care whether it's ven or az; take your pick. also,
as mentioned above, i don't care whether there's an 'es' or
not in 2, 4, and 6; take your pick.)

vi alemol, a sheynem dank.

Subject: Reb and Snow

Reb:

	I don't know the feminine version if there is one, but reb
is only used when you know the person. It is a sign of earned
respect, not just politeness.  You all wouldn't call be reb Hershl,
but someone who knows me might...

Geyn a shnei (I hate transliteration):

	One thing that I have to make clear is that the VERB must
always be the SECOND SENTENCE UNIT. therefore it has to be "es geyt
a shnei" It can not, I repeat NOT, be "geyt es a shnei".

	Secondly, es geyt a regn un es FALT a shnei. So the whole
sentence needs reworking.

	I hope that things are a little clearer.

Hershl Berman.

None of the real Slavicists here have spoken up, so I'll give it a
shot: (mevinim zoln farshteyn az ikh pruv do tsu derklern mit
poshete verter, nisht dafke pinktlekh ...)

While the nasal sounds in certain Polish words are indicated only by
an accent mark in standard Polish spelling, this doesn't mean that
those sounds appeared mysteriously or by themselves. In most cases
the history of the word is known, and the nasal sound has always
been there (although it's been lost in most of the other Slavic
languages). So, for instance, "five" in Polish is "piec" (with a
hook under the 'e', and an accent mark on the 'c') pronounced
roughly "piench". Compare that "n" with Greek "pente" (or Yiddish
"finf"), and you can see that there has been a nasal sound in the
Indo-European word for "five" (reconstructed as *penkwe) for LONG
time.

The point is that Polish doesn't particularly add nasals when they
weren't there already. And so this doesn't help us explain how these
Hebrew words, which didn't originally have nasals, acquired them.
