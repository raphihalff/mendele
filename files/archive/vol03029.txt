Subject: frozen datives

OK. My curiousity has got the better of me. Could one of the
linguists kindly explain to the lay folk when a dative counts as
"frozen."

I've certainly never studied Yiddish grammar, but I did notice the
feminine dative even during my pre-Mendele existence in the title of
Joseph Green's wonderful film: A brivele DER mamN

re: Kathryn Hellerstein.

thanks, bob. her account is not listed in the on-line or the hard-
copy directories here, but i did find a listing for david (on a
machine that i thought was no longer in use). i've sent him a msg
asking if she has an account. she should definitely be a mendelnik!
a dank.

Subject: Nekhtiger tog

	Arnold Kuzmack's suggestion that nekhtiger tog may mean "a
day like night" comports with the usage I've heard.  Usually it
follows some outrageously unlikely proposition, e.g.: "Shulamit in a
sheytl?  A nekhtiger tag!"

Subject: Adon olam

You'll probably get this mild reminder from Bob Werman, as well: The
words to _Adon Olam_, that protean song sung to a variety of tunes,
including Jeopardy [a quiz show in US/North America, with
distinctive theme music] are in Aramaic, rather than Hebrew.

Subject: Translation costs.

	My mother has been translating Yiddish to English for some
time now, and she usually works for a translating company. They pay
HER $30 per 8.5 by 11 page, written. The consumer probably pays
more. I know it sounds like a lot but my mother can often spend 2
hours on less than a full page, and when you work it out on a per
hour basis, it doesn't appear that expensive.

Subject: Translator is worthy of his/her hire


Reb Khaim: you have raised a difficult question and I pass my
solution along to others who may find it useful:

        The unit, 1 page, is essentially meaningless - is is small
type, large type, double column, very technical requiring a lot of
dictionary looking up, if handwritten - is it hard to read etc. What
I do is ask the holder of the text to send me xeroxes of 2 - 3
non-consecutive, but full pages. Then I see how long it takes me to
do a page. Outfits like FBIS in DC. have very complex format rules
for the translation, which of course adds to the time you have to
spend on a page. Once I have figured out how much time it takes to
produce final copy of a page - perhaps 1.5 hours - then I can
multiply that by his no.of pages and then multiply that by what I
would want for an hour of my time. Only at that point can I give a
figure on the job. I tell them exactly what I have done so that if a
page, from start to finish takes 1.5 hours, $15/pg. works out to
peanuts. I would be interested in hearing from others how they deal
with this problem.
