Subject: Yiddish purists

One could write volumes on the issues brought up by Meyshe Yankl Sweet in
his Tsey Kashes. There are the dialects and context-dependent forms of
speech, and then, as I think Weinreich said in the preface to College
Yiddish, that there must also be a language of culture. In a sense all
refined languages are languages that no one has ever spoken, at least in
their initial stages. What's so tragic about Yiddish, in my mind, is that
this process was cut off by the Holocaust. Masha Leon of the Forverts
once mentioned that even though she was from Warsaw she spoke the
standard Yiddish of Vilna-Bund-YIVO, but how many people willingly
yielded to it? Most prefer the language of heymishkeyt and varemkeyt.

Zachary Baker of YIVO steered me to Mendele; my comments to him were that
I admired YIVO-Yiddish so much for its purity, harmony, and pristine
qualities; every word carefully chosen and refined. Maybe it depends what
mood you're in. Someone once told me that Yiddish is a catch-all word for
any German-based patois spoken by Jews. So where's the middle ground?

I spoke to a noblewoman of Mallorca once about Mallorcan linguistic
autonomy and the possible adoption of Catalan or standardized Mallorquin.
She was pro-Castilian for the following reason: as long as we all speak
Castilian in formal situations, Mallorquin is safe, because if we adopted
some sort of Mallorquin as an official language, whose would we choose?
Would we accept some sort of Catalan? She feared that the local patois
would wither away. Let Castilian prevail, and the language of each
Mallorcan village and class would prosper in the hearts of the people.

I hear her voice in this debate. The difference is that Yiddish never
reached the point of having a standard (like Castilian) that was widely
accepted. If anything is widely accepted it's the stage pronunciation.
Anyway, too many cups of coffee, but I resonate with the issues brought
up by fraynd Sweet.

Subject:  Lewis Carroll in Yiddish

As a Yiddish bibliographer I am embarrassed not to have the answer to a
question posed to me once by a devout member of the Lewis Carroll
Society, to wit:  Has anything by Carroll appeared in Yiddish
translation?  (This question is spurred by recent references in MENDELE
to T. S. Eliot and J. R. R. Tolkien.) A search of the YIVO Library
catalog revealed that we had no books by Carroll, but burrowed in my
failing memory (too much sherry after hours) is a rendition of
"Jabberwocky" in Yiddish, which begins with the words, "S'iz gevorn
brilik" (or "s'iz brilik gevorn").  Can anyone help me locate the full
text -- with proper bibliographical citation, mind you, so that I can
pass it on to my Lewis Carroll khosid -- assuming such exists?  A slithy
dank.

Subject: Di fir kashes

Not surprisingly, all of the Yiddish versions of Di Fir Kashes that have
appeared so far perpetuate the error in the usual english translation of
the opening line.  It is not, in fact, a question, but rather an
expostulation. It should be: Vi andersh is di nacht fon alle andere
necht!

Subject: An introduction and a frage

   My name is Yonah Moshe Lakin and am currently studying Yiddish at
McGill University.  My professor mentioned Mendele, and being the
computer freak that I am, I thought subscribing to Mendele would be a fun
way to learn things about Yiddish that I wouldn't learn in my class.

Now the frage.  In my class we were going over some sentence
translations.  One of the sentences we had a big debate over.  Here it
is:

      Were you at home at when I called you?

We came up with a translation of:

      Bistu geven in der haim ven ich hob dir/dich gerofn?

Now the frage is the use of rofn in this case accusative or dative?

Subject: List of Yiddish periodicals

Does anyone have, or know of, a list of periodicals in Yiddish, including
newspapers, journals, newsletters, and giving addresses and subscription
costs? I would like to see such a list, and it would be useful to others
-- for example, the editor of the "From the World of Yiddish" pages in
the Yiddish Forward expressed surprise at being informed that there is a
second weekly Yiddish newspaper, Naye Tzaytung, in addition to the
soon-to-be-closed down Letste Nayes. So far I've found out about Yiddish
periodicals just by stumbling upon them so to speak

Steven A.Jacobson

[This is a question that the shames should have asked long ago.  He
now asks that replies be sent to the list for editing.  A summary will
then be printed.  nm]

Subject: Shmushkele

Allow me to clarify--I hardly meant to "malign" my dear mother (ze zol
zaan a gute bayter) by suggesting she may, even inadvertantly, used a
term for the female genetalia in an endearing way to my infant sister.  I
was merely suggesting the possibility of code switching, very common in
bilinguals, in which certain subjects or sentiments are only expressed in
their mother tongue, and not in the 2nd language of the common culture.
This is a quite commopn sociolinguistic phenomenon, and I've known a
number of people who were quite prudish in their English and passionate
in their mamaloshones, whether Spanish, French, Hindi, Russian or
whatever.  Whether my mother "meant" to use the diminutive of "shmue" can
hardly be ascertained, as she's in yene velt, but it sounds more likely
on both phonological and semantic grounds than "smotchik", of which the
diminutive would be something like "smotchkele."  And wouldn't it make
far more sense to refer to a cute girl infant as "beautiful little
pussy", rather than "beautiful little pacifier?"
