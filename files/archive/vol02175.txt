Subject: Khomets-shtern

Yesterday evening, motse-peysakh, my wife recited the
following jingle from her Juedischdeutsch tradition:

	Chometz-Stern seh' ich gern,
	Butterbrot dann ess' ich gern.

Roughly, 'I'm happy to see the Khomets-star [the appearance
of stars that defines the legal onset of nighttime and the
end of Peysakh], then I'll happily eat bread and butter.'

My wife doesn't know whether this was a widely known rhyme
or whether her great-grandmother, who recited it, maybe
even made it up herself.  Anyway, it expresses my feelings
precisely--I like it!  I don't know any analog in Yiddish.
Anybody?

Subject: Hebrew/Yiddish fonts

My father, a retired linguist (do they ever really
retire?), has created a Hebrew and a Yiddish font for the
Macintosh. He created it for a few reasons:

1]      So that there would be better correspondence
        between the sounds of the English keyboard and the
        Hebrew letters than the conventional fonts

2]      When used with PalPhon (a phonetic font system
        created at the University of Toronto Linguistics
        Dept.) - all the subtilties of the language can be
        written.

3]      He is writing an advanced Etymological Yiddish
        dictionary (we haven't found a good one that was
        ever written), and decided that transliteration
        alone was not good enough and wanted to included
        the lexography of the word

If you are curious about any of this, ask I will tell...

Subject: Tsvey kashes vegn Mangers a lid

A moving sonnet by Itsik Manger, "Di `oyeve yisroel' baym
toytnlager belzhets" (included in the Howe-Wisse-Shmeruk
Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish Verse), has three Hasidic
rabbis surveying piles of ash at the Belzhets death camp.
One of them invites God to "take a good look" (Leonard
Wolf's translation):

	--Na, nem un ze, akh gotenyu *ti nash*.

The poem ends as the third calls upon the others to join
him in striking God's name from the list of true Lovers of
Israel:

	R'meyerl fun premishlan oyf zayn altn shtekn ongeshpart
	Shteyt un vart, fiberndik un *tsart*[?]:
	"Raboysay, lomir zogn ale oyf a kol:

	Bashefer fun di veltn ...
	... mir di galitsianer mekn dikh oyf eybik oys
	Fun der eyde emese `oyeve yisroel'."

Can someone help me with the expressions enclosed in
asterisks?

1.  What does *ti nash* mean?  It sounds Slavic to me.

2.  I've transcribed as *tsart* the word written
tsadek-ayin-reysh-tes.  What part of speech is it?  Verb?
Adjective?  Related to "tsar", grief?  Wolf translates the
three lines as

	Trembling and feverish, Reb Meirl of Przemyslan
	Waits, leaning on his old stick.  "Gentlemen,"
	He says, "Let us in unison call

	etc.

A dank.

Subject: Elderhostel Courses

A central clearinghouse for the compilation of current
Yiddish data is non-existent.  The obvious place, YIVO, is
unable to act in this role. Mendele can be the vehicle to
collect and disseminate these data.

One area of interest is the location of Yiddish courses.
Since this tends to be so fluid, the location of Yiddish
teachers was under- taken.  This list is available and is
constantly being updated by quarterly mailings.

A possible Yiddish course classification:
	Formal Schools - Year around
		Universities
		High Schools
		Elementary shules,
	Summer Institutes
		Universities
                Others (NYBC, Charlotte, Workmen's Circle,
                        Chicago JCC , etc.)
        Adult Education
		Jewish Community Centers
		Temples/Synagogues
		Private Homes
	Elderhostels

The last listing Elderhostels is the newest, and may be an
area of great growth in the future.  Its low cost,
camaraderie, and publicity make it available to seniors who
utilize them as vacations.  Some are beginning to offer
Grandparent/Grandchildren programs.

Since the Elderhostel programs are published seasonally,
listings of Yiddish courses is merely a matter of scanning
these catalogs. Unfortunately, their national office does
not have a search service availability to scan by subject
area.

The Spring and Summer issues show 25 locations with
substantial Jewish-interest programs.  Of these, the
following have substantial Yiddish content.

        U of Arizona
	U of Arizona - Mountains
	Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins U
	Berkshire Community College/Lenox Hills
	Western New England College
	Midrasha/Fresh Air Society
	College Misericordia
	B'nai B'rith Beber Camp

Corrections or additions would be appreciated.

If you are interested in assisting "der bay" with
compilation of lists of Yiddish teachers, Yiddish clubs,
Klezmer bands, Yiddish radio programs, Yiddish Ham Radio
Operators or acting as a contact for The Yiddish Network
(now located in 112 cities) please let us know.
