Subject: oyf un af

I have a question as to the pronunciation of vav, yud, fey.  I generally see
it written as oyf, but have been told that it is generally pronounced  af.
Nu, who says what in what dialect?  And then, what about vav, yud, fey, nun?
Is it oyfn or afn, as in oyfn pripetshik (or is it pripitshok?)  I know it
is not this simple, but what does a "standard" Yiddish "du" speaker say as
opposed to a "di" speaker?  Help me, please!

A hartsikn dank in foroys,

Lorele Cahan-Simon

Subject: opkirtzungs leksikon

If khaver Sterlin is specifically interested in the opkirtzung Alef, Alef,
Vov, Vov, I believe it to be for "Un Azoy Veiter," which might be the
equivalent of writing "etc." in English.

Subject: Peretz in Spanish

I am very thankful to Mr. Taube for the information about Peretz' works
translated into Spanish. About the IWO library in Burnos Aires: as far as I
remember, this library was at AMIA building. Once, in 1957, I have been one
ofthe readers there, not Peretz, but Chemistry. If it is so, I am afraid,
what has been the fate of that library, when the AMIA building was blown by
an explosion, some years ago.

As far as I have been kindly illustrated by Mr. Taube and some other
khaverim, I assume that either Peretz has been translated into Spanish long
time ago, or/and his translated works are a small part of his writings.My
intention is to go on and to translate his works, as far as I am able to,
into panish. The contexts of Peretz' stories and tales is akin to the
metaphysical and social atmosphere of the writings of many South American
writers and authors, specially the modern ones.

Subject: purimshpil

The translation of khaver Steinlauf's excerpt (10.025) is pretty
straightforward.

The interpretation is not evident without some further context. I have not
seen this before, and would like to know what some of the preceeding
dialogue was leading up to this exchange.

Subject: Alter Esselin web page

"Honey and Arsenic" is the title of the web site devoted to the Yiddish poet
Alter Esselin (1889-1974) The site was created by his son, Joseph: features
75 of Esselin's poems in both English translation and the Yiddish originals.
Selected from the hundreds of bittersweet lyrical poems that appeared in his
three books, including the 1954 Kovner Prize Winning volume, Lider fun a
Midbarnik (Poems of a Hermit). Plus critical commentary, biographical
memoirs, significant documents, portrait gallery, and audio interviews. The
site address is http://www.esselin.com.

Subject: etymology of "dalfen"

I am not a linguist and the discussion below is a speculation.

Dalfon in modern Hebrew is a poor person. According to both Gur and Even
Shoshan dictionaries this is a relatively new word to the Hebrew. Even
Shoshan dates it to the haskala period (~1700s) and Gur to 'sifrut
me'ucheret' probably referring to the same haskala period. I suspect that in
the haskala period the term 'dalfon,' with the meaning of poor person was
borrowed by the Hebrew from Yiddish. Even Shoshan suggested that the meaning
is based on a folkloric Midrash of Megilat Esther (9:7) based on 'Dalfon'
the name of the second son of Haman, and because it has the 'dal' (=poor
person) prefix to it. (Even Shoshan in 7 Volumes, Jerusalem 1966, 1st Vol.
p. 435) I speculate that because poor Dalfon not only was hung (or
crucified) in the story, he was decapitated first according to the Tosafot
based on the Targum (Yoma 31a, s.v. amah.) So he had all the trimming to
depict a real poor person, a true loser. Weinreich list it on page 655 as
'poor man,' but Harkavy, Yiddish-English Dictionary, 1898, as 'poor devil.'
The 'devil' in Harkavy is to give us that extra dimension of the true loser,
he was decapitated and hung. Note that Harkavy explained the other three
terms: 'evion,' 'ani,' and 'orim' as poor or needy man without the 'devil.'
So initially 'dalfon' might have had an extra dimetion of poorness.

Note that 'dalfon' is not only Haman's son, but it was also used for the big
fish. Today this fish is called 'dolphin' in Hebrew and in English, but
Rambam called it 'dalfon' (Yad, Ma'achalot Asurot 2:12). But this meaning
has nothing to do with the discussion.

In modern Hebrew a person who leaks information is a 'madlif,' but this one
comes form 'dolef,' (=leaks), a word used for leaky liquids. In Aramaic it
is used also for leaks (Jastrow, p. 311.) I do not think that the 'leak'
meaning has anything to do with the 'poor' meaning.
