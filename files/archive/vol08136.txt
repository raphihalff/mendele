Subject: Young Bashevis

Dear Mendele,

I am Larissa Privalskaya, graduate student of Judaics, Russian State
University for Humanities, Moscow. The subject is my diploma paper is
"Bashevis' fiction:  variety of motives". Due to the lack of nesessary
material in Russia, I'll highly appreciate all information concerning this
writer's beginnings, the Yiddish literary life in Warsaw 1920s uo to his
emigration in 1935, the Yiddish rewiews of his early work, his own
non-fiction publications in Warsaw Yiddish magazines, his fellow writers
from the Yiddish literary world, and relevant material. 

Thank everybody who could help.

Subject: G. Winer's discussion of Grade

It's interesting that Schwartz felt Khayem Grade's failure to write poetry
after coming to New York was an economic decision (Gitl Dubrovsky,
Mendele
Vol 08.132). I hadn't heard or considered that possibility during my
research for the stage version of "The Quarrel," which closed this past
weekend (after being extended by popular demand). 

After one performance, Alan Nadler (a protege of Grade's, formerly of
YIVO,
now at Drew University), Duvid Fishman (also a protege, from Jewish
Theological Seminary) and Jacqueline Berke (from Drew) held a
symposium to
discuss aspects of the work. I hope I don't mischaracterize, but I recall
them saying that Grade turned to prose because he was unable to
continue
writing his nature poetry after the Holocaust. 

I will forward this exchange to Miriam Hoffman, who also knew Grade
and
teaches his work (and also writes for The Forward), to see if she has
any
comments. 

By the way, the debut production of "The Quarrel" at Playwrights
Theatre of
New Jersey sold more tickets than any production in the company's
thirteen-year history. Reviews and audience response were wonderful
and some
tentative discussion is underway to mount the play elsewhere, including
Off-Broadway (where raising money will undoubtedly be the concern).

Subject: Gershon Weiner vegn Chayim Grade

Be'emes geven interesant tzu lezn Prof. Gershon Weiner's bamerkungen

hilf tzu Yiddishe shrayber in Yisroel. 

Derloybt mir tzu tzitirn etlekhe shires fun main bukh: "Autumn Travels
Devious Paths" (Dryad Press, 1992, Washington, D.C.) In mayn essay:
Chaim
Grade - 1910-1982, dort dermon ikh fogendes: 

I remember him on a visit with us to Baltimore. We sat hours past
midnight
lisening to him speak with anxiety and affection about Zalman Shazar,
about
Israel, about the Jewish community in the Soviet Union being destroyed
spiritually and about his friend Abraham Sutzkever. His lecture at the
Brith- Sholom Hall in Baltimore was eloquent, cool, to the point,
wonderfully phrased. But in the three hours after the lecture that we
spent
together, all the hidden hurt confined in his heart came out. 

He talked aboutdisunity in the Jewish world, how we forsake the
struggle of
Russian Jewry, the same way that part of American Jewry forsaked
European
Jewry during the great calamity of the Holocaust.He called on us not to
give
up the struggle''.... 

When we mentioned to Grade that Sutzkever was here, in Baltimore,
Chaim
became emotional: "I am older than Sutzkever, he told us. Our
backgrounds
differ, though we have a lot in common: the powerty in which we grew
up, the
struggle to keep alive.  Our families were crushed by the Nazis and our
deep, stron love for the Yiddish language. Abrasha (Sutzkever) was a
unique
character, different than many of us in "Young Vilna". He was in love
with
nature, always searching in his nature poems the source of creation. In
the
depressing reality we all lived in Vilna, Sutzkever escaped to writing
about
nature and searching for treasures of Yiddish in the "Yivo".  Even when
hiding in a wooden coffin, Sutzkever imagines that he is swinging on a
boat
carried by the waves. This is the secret of his survival of our survival".

Chaim Grade hot erlikh fardint az zaine werk, poezie un proze, zoln

Subject: Chaim Grade, intellectual property, and the U.S. Congress

On January 6, 1999, when the House of Representatives adopted the
resolution
appointing managers for the impeachment trial of you know whom for
you know
what, another largely unnoticed piece of legislation was introduced by
the
Honorable Eliot L. Engel (D-NY). Mr. Engel suggested to grant to Inna
Hecker
Grade and her successors all rights for Chaim Grade's works and
translations
for a term of 50 years from June 26, 1982 (the date of death of Chaim
Grade). This bill was first introduced by Rep. T. Weiss (D-NY) in the
101st
Congress (H.R.1332, Mar 8, 1989), and then reintroduced by Rep. Engel
four
times (103d - H.R.2329, May 27, 1993; 104th - H.R.524, Jan 13, 1995;
105th -
H.R.377, Jan 7, 1997; and 106th - H.R.320, Jan 6, 1999). (Side note: 
Congressman Engel has been persistant in this particular matter, may
be his
constituents from the 17th Congressional District in NY could help him to
direct his energy and good will for the benefit of Yiddish at large.)

The bill is unique in many respects, here I would like to point out that as
far as I know this is the only bill in the history of the U.S. Congress with
half of its text written in Yiddish (or, for that matter, probably in any
language other than English). The bill is a public document, and I am
taking
the liberty of reproducing part of it here since it may be of interest to
many Mendele subscribers.

HR 320 IH
                               106th CONGRESS
                                 1st Session
                                  H. R. 320

Subject: konkordantsie far _vi kumt di kats ibern vaser?_

Thanks to Stephen Dowling for pointing out to me my shortsightedness.

I have now posted the Qtext files for the concordance (Mendele
08.133(6)) 
on my FTP site: ftp://ftp.shore.net/members/bag
file:  Concordance.zip

for those who want it electronically and who have Qtext. The zip
contains 
two files:
     REFS.QTW has the raw data
     REFSTBL.QTW has the same information re-formatted into tables for
easier
reading.

Be warned: Qtext is more than a little flaky when dealing with such
large 
files and large tables.

As mentioned in the earlier posting, copies are available by regular mail
for the cost of postage (5.2 oz.) sent to Barry Goldstein, 124 Otis
Street,

From: "Leonard Koenick" <lkoenick@erols.com>
Subject: Parody

My father, Tzvi Hersh, z"l, and his brothers and sisters used to sing this
song, usually at Pesach after consuming four cups of wine (at a
minimum). 
It is, of course, a parody of the well known song 'Az Moshiach Vet
Kumen'
(pardon my illiteracy in Yiddish). 

The words they sang, increasingly animated, with much pounding on the
table,
will give you an idea of the age in which it was created.  I would greatly
value any additional verses or variations and the words as they would
be in
Yiddish. 

So as not to make matters too confused, I will state only my English
understanding of the verses. 

Rebynu, what will we do when the Moshiach comes?
When the Moshiach comes, we will have a banquet.

What will we eat at the banquet?
Hot dogs (sung as hot doggies), Hot doggies
Hot Dogs we will eat.
At the banquet

What will we drink at the banquet?
Coca Cola, Coca Cola
Coca Cola we will drink.
Hot dogs we will eat.
At the banquet.

Who will teach us Torah at the banquet?
Jack Dempsy will teach us Torah.
Coca Cola, etc.

Who will dance at the banquet?
Gilda Grey will dance at the banquet.
Jack Dempsy, etc.

Subject: name in question

While browsing (in Virginia) the www, I came across a reference to the
name
Baltaxe in your Volume 4.008.  Turns out that someone had met my
father (in
New Zealand- isn't technology amazing!) and was asking about the
meaning of
the family name.  I vaguely remember my grandfather (his father)
telling me
that Baltaxe meant "head tax collector" not "bailiff in rabinnical court"
as my father apparently remembers.

Any answers?
