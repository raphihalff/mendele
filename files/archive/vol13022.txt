Subject: meshulekh

I remembered a word I hadn't thought of in years, "meshulekh". It doesn't
seem to be used here [Israel], but it certainly was in the Americas and
means a man who shnors for a yeshiva, cheder etc. on a commission basis. In
other words, his parnosseh is the commission he takes on every dollar he
shnors for the institution he represents. It is not a very respectful word.
The word "sh'liakh", which I mentioned, although from the same shoresh, is
far more respectful, since it implies that that the man is sent directly by
the rebbe, rosh yeshiva or institution and is paid a salary or its
equivalent, but that the money he collects does not give him a commission.

Lubavitch, for example, had and I imagine still has, an extensive army of
sh'likhim, but it is well known that they are paid a regular salary and are
not to be classified as meshulokhim.

In any event, meshulekh should certainly be included among the terms meaning
shnorer. The lower type of meshulekh was often referred to by his victims
(all of us) as representing "The Nehmer Yeshiva".

Subject: Re: shnorer

I've read the long and short discourses about shnorers. I believe that
two aspects of shnorer-keyt have yet to be laid on the tish. One is the
gender of the shnorer. Surely there were (and are) female shnorers.
Second, being called a shnorer, as some might reflexively believe, does
not automatically mean that the shnorer is poor, indigent, a luftmensh or
a nokhshleper. Many people of means shnor. Whatever the reason or
motivation, the act of shnoring by a shnorer may be more related to a
personality or psychological component, than to the thickness or thin-ness
of the shnorer's wallet or how much money may be stuffed in a female
shnorer's bosomkestl. Also, some shnorers enjoy shnoring. Some
shnoring is socially acceptable. I am a notorious food beggar, whether
it's cadging lollypops in medical offices, or chocolate chip cookies at
Publix which are intended for kids. (I tell the clerk I am an orphan and am
big for my age. Never fails!)

Has anyone heard of the word lepeturekhe as describing a person who flits
around from one social activity to another?

Subject: Peretz's "Monisch"

I am encouraged by the recent upsurge in activity on Mendele to post an
observation that might provoke some discussion. I believe that Y. L. Peretz
first became known as a Yiddish writer with the publication of his epic
ballad "Monish" in the late 1880's. One of the striking features of this
poem is the use of the Poylish-Galitsianer pronunciation in the rhyming
couplets, e.g.

"Monish iz a voyler ying
Mit a kepl fayer-flink."

In later years, Peretz rewrote the poem several times, and among other
changes he got rid of all the "dialect" rhymes: in fact, over two dozen of
them. I wonder why he did this? Was there pressure/snobbery from literary
critics of the day? Was he trying to cultivate more of an intellectual image
for himself or perhaps for the Yiddish language?

As a side issue, I have trouble with one word in the poem: after Monish
hears the Christian girl singing and is captivated by her voice, he goes to
kheder and sings from the gemorah with the same melody:

"Zingt dernokh er di gemore
Un is m'taim (?) yeder svore"

What is the word spelled mem-tes-ayin-yod-mem? I am guessing that it might
be a typo in my edition. either "metamim" (satisfying, pleasurable) or
better still "metama" (contaminated) would fit, but either of these are a
bit of a stretch to justify as mere typos. Any ideas?

Subject: Re: yovn

I don't know if anybody suggested this previously but there is a Yiddish
expression that suggests that somebody is completely out of place in a given
situation or even like a "bull in a china shop".  It asserts, "er iz azoy vi
a yovn in Suke". (He behaves like a soldier in a suke".

Joseph Opatoshu - O"H

"He has taken his bright candle and is gone
into another room I cannot find,
But anyone can tell where he has been
by the little lights he leaves behind."
         / The Lamplighter/

Fifty years since you are gone,
your face lives in our memory,
we hold dear our visit with you,
we cherish the letter you wrote,
that gave us courage to go on.

             We still remember our visit at your
             home, you kept asking questions,
             you said; "I thank God you survived,
             you are a witness to our sorrow,
             an affirmation to our endurance".

From the Stupsk forest, Mlawa,
you carried a bright candle of
light, ubder the 'shadow of the
generations', through ruins and
destruction to Israel warriors.

                 You led through 'Bar Kochba'
                 to 'The Forests of Poland',
                 from 'Rabbi Akiva' to Ghetto
                 uprisings, claiming through out;
                " The Jewish  People Lives Again!"

In your novels and short stories
you sought the fusion between
our peoples struggle for survival,
the fiber that binds us to Yiddish,
the believe in 'Netzakh Yisroel'.

                  Your 'little lights' reached all the
                  corners of our globe, wherever
                   Yiddish was alive. You left us a
                   flaming inheritance, a demand;
                   My people, march on. Keep going!

Subject: A town of horse thieves

A friend of the family once said of the town of Butrimants (50 miles or so
south of Kovno and Vilna), "Butrimants, a shtot fun ferd-ganovim" - in
english "Butrimants, a town of horse thieves". I'd like find out what that
meant exactly. Were there such towns in the old country? Or was this a kind
of teasing/joke? Would anyone out there know anything on this topic?
