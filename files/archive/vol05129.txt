Subject: Teaching Yiddish to children

In Mendele 5.127, Ellen Cassedy asks: "...what goals are appropriate for
a child learning Yiddish?  There's no Torah reading at the Bas Mitzvah to
aim for.."  It seems to me that Ellen must have had some purpose in mind,
however vague, when she started to teach her daughter Yiddish.  Be that
as it may, her question is a good one.  There are those who believe that
the prime reason for learning Yiddish is to carry on conversations with
others in normal, interactive situations.  This school of thought is well
represented by exponents such as Mordkhe Schaechter and the League for
Yiddish, Yugentruf, Workmen's Circle, etc.  They sponsor activities which
encourage, and are conducive to, conversation. However, in Ellen's
situation, unless Yiddish is spoken in her home, this would not be a
practical goal.

In my own case, whether teaching children or adults, my goal has always
been, and will continue to be, the creation of literate students who can
read and write in Yiddish.  I want them to be able to partake of our
Yiddish literary treasures from original versions of Sholem Aleikhem,
Peretz, Singer, etc.  I want them to be able to correspond with friends
and relatives  who live far away.  The ability to truly converse in any
language requires a knowledge of grammar and vocabulary far greater than
most people realize.

Ellen has enumerated several books and tapes which she has used.  Two
that she has not mentioned, but which would be good for her, are:
"Yiddish" by Sheva Zucker, and "Learning Yiddish in Easy Stages" by
Zuckerman & Herbst.  Both of these emphasize conversation as well as
reading and writing.

If Ellen wants further justification for teaching her daughter Yiddish, I
recommend that she read the post on Mendele by Matt Dailey entitled "Why
Study Yiddish".  I will be happy to send a copy by snail mail to Ellen
(or anyone else) if I am given an address.

Subject: Yiddish books For kids

I want to echo the recommendation of the "Arele" readers from Mexico and
Leon Elbe's "Yingele Ringele" (really delightful for those of us who
prefer silly to preachy) and to suggest a couple of other things.  One is
Y. Kaminski's "Ikh lern zikh yidish" (Workmen's Circle, 1945), which has
a lot of two-tone, red and black, and blue and black, pictures, coloring
and cutout exercises, and an afterward with advice on making learning
fun.  It's basically an alphabet primer and a beginning reader, but it's
more fun than the usual "Serele geyt.  Berele geyt.  Serele accuses
Berele of sexual harrassment." etc.  I got my copy from the National
Yiddish Book Center.

Another, more recent, primer is the "Yiddish Alphabet Book" by Frederica
Postman (Adama Books, 1988; first published in 1979).  It gives two or
three Yiddish words (not necessarily the most common ones: for yud, it
gives "yingl, yam-fleyts, yam-multerl" [the last two translated as "tide"
and "sea shell"]) and a two-tone, black-and-sepia illustration for each
letter.  The choice of words is really curious.  Under samekh, you get
Uriel Weinreich's neologism "stashkeshmir" (supposedly meaning peanut
butter), along with "sendvitsh" and "sloy" (jar), but under tof, you just
get the statement that no Yiddish words begin with tof, only words "taken
directly from Hebrew".  (Secularist that I am, I'm still astonished the
author apparently couldn't bring herself to say "Toyre".) Adama Books
lists its address as 306 W. 38 St., NY, NY 10018 (it may also be
available through the Arbeter Ring [tel. 1-800-WC-CALL-US] book center).

For small children, Chaya Burstein's "Hebrew Alphabet Coloring Book"
(Dover, 1986; $2.50) and "The Jewish Kids' Hebrew-English Wordbook"
(Jewish Publication Society, 1993; hardcover, $16.95) may also be worth
looking at.  Yes, they concentrate on Hebrew vocabulary, but there's at
least one Yiddish word (albeit one "taken directly from Hebrew") on
almost every page and they're certainly up-to-date.  The Hebrew print
could be bigger in the "Wordbook", but I liked the picture of the mouse
saying "Mazl-tov!" to the mother cat with the four kittens.  (Too bad
there's nothing like the Renyi picture dictionaries for Yiddish!)

Subject: Teaching children Yiddish

In Mendele Vol 5.127 Ellen Cassidy recommends for young beginning Yiddish
learners, "ARELE," a 3 volume workbook by Frida de Cielak, my storybook,
"Di Dray Bern, Mirele-Goldherele Antshuldikt Zikh," and "Yiddish 30, a
Berlitz-type vocabulary for teens and adults.  The later three include
text/tape/English translation.

For this school year Yiddish of Greater Washington has subsidized the
purchase of the "ARELE" workbooks for the aleph/beys/gimel classes of
Chaim Weitzmann Yiddish/Hebrew Folk Shule.  They meet Sunday mornings in
Rockville, Md.  For more information you can call the Yiddish teacher,
Sarita Zimmerman at 301-384-5136.  She says the books have been very well
received.  I believe they are a welcome alternative to the standard
"Berele geyt in Shule."

Ellen asked about goals for a "non-Torah reading Bas Mitsvah."  A Bar/Bas
Mitsvah is a 'right of passage'- an acknowledgement of the youngster's
'coming of age.'  When they show they can be responsible for their
continuing education and participation in Jewish life, they deserve a
celebration.  The party should include "a droshe" a speech by the
celebrant (a research paper on a Yiddish writer or a significant Jewish
event, and/or about a Jewish/Yiddish project the celebrant is doing) and
a program of songs, poems, and possibly a "maysele." The 'mitsva' of a
Bar/Bas Mitsva is generally considered to be the Torah or Haftorah
reading.  It might therefore be misleading to call the above celebration
thus.  Do Mendelyaners have a suggestion?

I have begun the practice of presenting a Yiddish 'lid' at the bar/bas
mitsvas I've recently been attending, either to the assemblage, if
appropriate, or when the video photographer comes around to ask you to
say something.  The poem/song follows;  (Several guests told me their
parents would sing this at the Bar Mitsvas they used to attend.)

Der Nayer Yid  words and music by Lipa Feingold (I've translated it and
changed some spelling)

Fraynd, haynt iz do a simkhe        Friends, today is a celebration,
A bar/bas mitsva bay a Yid          A Bar/Bas Mitzvah for a Jew.
Vil ikh zogn a por verter           (Therefore) I will say a few words
Tsu dem/der yungen/r nayem/r Yid.   To the young, new Jew.
Vos ikh gey atsind dir zogen        What I will now say to you
Vet dos zayn gants kurts un sharf.  Will be altogether short and poignant,
Zolst fartaydekn dem Yidn          "You should defend the Jews
Ven s'iz noytig, ven men darf.      When it's necessary, when one must."

Chorus:
Tsugekumen haynt iz a nayer/e Yid   A Jewish son/daughter has come here today
In der groyser Yidisher mishpokhe   To join the larger Jewish family.
Lomir ale vinshen dem/i nayem/e Yid Let us all wish the new Jew
Lange, gute yorn mit hatslokhe      Many good years and success.

2.
Zolst nor imer kind gedenkn         (My) child, (you) should always remember
Ver dayn yikhes iz geven            From whence you came.
Du zolst visn az mir Yidn           You should know that we Jews
Zaynen imer shtoltz geven           Have always been proud
Un mir viln az di kinder            And we want our children,
Fun dem altn eybik Yid              Descendents of the eternal Jew,
Zoln undzer fon nor trogn           To carry our banner forever.

Chorus...
For my granddaughter's Bas Mitsva we printed the Yiddish and
English translation in the program, I recited the verses and a younger
granddaughter sang the chorus with me.  (oy, hob ikh geklaybt nakhes!)

ikh vintsh aykh ale a yor mit gezunt, sholem, un libe!
