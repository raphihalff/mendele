Subject: Silvering a window

        There's a story that is told by the hassidic Rebbe
in The Dybbuk -- at least in the 1930's Warsaw movie, I
don't know whether it's in Anski's play too.  It also
appears in College Yiddish.  Why do the rich think only of
themselves?  Through a transparent window one can look out
into the street and see other people, but add a little
silver and make the window a mirror, and one can see only
oneself.  Does anyone know whether Anski made this story up
himself, or whether it he had a source in folklore or in
tales of some hassidic magid?

Subject: Klezcamp

A friend of mine, a singer who knows no Yiddish (and is not
even Jewish), has recently discovered klezmer music and has
begun learning some songs.  I think she would enjoy going
to Klezcamp, but I don't know when it takes place and who
runs it.  Are there any other programs she could attend, as
a way of learning songs and singing them together with
other fans?

Subject: YIVO for sale?

In brief, the message is: The YIVO Building is up
for sale by Sotheby's. Does anyone know what is 
going on?

Best regards,

re rozhinkes mit mandlen, i didn't know that it was remade
into a love song--all the many renditions i've heard have
been of the original lullaby. do you know of any recording
of the love song version?

yes, there are thousands of yiddish songs, including many
many love songs. (my favorite is a very sexy one called 'in
der fintster', with great lines like: 'in der fintster
klapt dayn harts alts vilder, vilder.') somewhere i read
that over 10,000 yiddish records were produced in america
alone before world war 2! (these would have been basically
singles, of course.) if you're interested, you might want
to look at ruth rubin's very readable book, voices of a
people.

perhaps the reason why our shames feels the way he does
about borscht belt stuff is that that's what most people
think yiddish music/culture consists of, since that's all
they've heard. (my own pet peeve is the current born-again
shlock like country yossi and the shteeblehoppers. next to
them i find menasha skulnik terribly witty--a regular noel
coward.)

one anecdote about rozhinkes mit mandlen--a local
artsy-fartsy fm radio folksong show played someone's
rendition of it once. afterwards, the disk jockey, in
proper hushed breathy tones, informed us that the singer
had 'personally collected' the song! obviously, she didn't
realize that it was not a 'true' folksong but was composed
for an operetta by the very well-known and definitely
'non-folk' playwright/composer, avram goldfaden. of course,
the line between 'true folksongs' and 'other' is often
blurred in yiddish, if the former are songs whose
authorship is unknown (jews are just too scholarly--many
folk poets/songwriters are known and credited, e.g.
gebirtig), but rozhinkes is no more a folksong than
gershwin's 'summertime' is, and the idea that someone
thinks they 'collected' it still makes me howl with
laughter.
