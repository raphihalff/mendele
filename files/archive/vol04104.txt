Subject: Maven

to: zellig bach

one specific (and trivial) point in response to your critique. _maven_ is
an english word. and that's how it's spelled, tho the ahd also lists
_mavin_.

more generally, i for one would be more sympathetic with your position if
you substituted the word _conventional_ for _correct_ with regard to
orthography. but then of course one could argue 'whose convention?',
since there are in fact several... by the way, i thought the yivo
orthography in the hebrew alphabet and its offical romanization were
pretty young, as spelling conventions go.

and here's a question i have about yivo romanization. what is the
official position on upper case (assuming one is using upper case at
all!)? should a sentence begin with an upper case letter? what about
proper names? that is, which is the officially accepted version, 1, 2, or
3 (or something else):

1. farvos vil moyshe redn mit got? 2. Farvos vil Moyshe redn mit got? 3.
Farvos vil Moyshe redn mit Got?

a dank.

Subject: Kitchen Yiddish: Where did sons pick up their Yiddish?.

RE:  4.081.3

If you were a needleworker's child in New York City in the 30's, it would
be very unlikely that you had a room of your own.  In a normal household
where parents had aspirations for their children, it would have been
likely that you went to bed before the adults in the house. This would
most likely have been in a folding-bed rolled out and made up in the
living room. If there were guests, you would probably be put to bed
temporarily in your parents' bed in the one bedroom of the apartment.
The nature of the construction of these apartment did not provide much of
a barrier to eavesdropping on the conversation of the adults in another
room. The opportunity of hearing so much that was normally withheld from
you provided the effective incentive for you to learn to understand
spoken Yiddish.

Subject: Proper spelling

I resonate with Zellig Bach's prescriptions. I, too, feel that there is
such a thing, or time when a language is taken seriously and is worked on
to make it normative, a medium for cultural expression. I think many of
us are uncomfortable with liberal notions of pluralism, that prescriptive
grammar is elitist, and that culture should be inclusive of all practices
of "the people". As I've said before here, at first, a standard is
necessarily a medium of expression that is no one's native dialect, no
one's "mother" tongue. The standard does oust dialects in many cases. For
example, in Germany no educated person uses Plattdeutsch and most middle
to upper-class people are no longer able to speak it. In Switzerland, a
conscious decision was made NOT to oust Schwyzerduetsch, for political
reasons; however, one always writes in Hochdeutsch. We're talking here
about a compromise known as diglossia, where one masters both the
standard and one's native dialect. This is my feeling, for whatever its
worth, about how to handle this problem in Yiddish.

I worked on a cataloging project in which we cataloged newspapers and
periodicals written in Yiddish. We encountered a number of problems
with daytshmerizms in titles. How should they be romanized? Very often
there was a parallel title in "German" i.e. Yiddish but romanized by the
publishers according to German orthographic standards. I decided that I
would romanize the title exactly as I found it but make an added title
entry under current spelling conventions, even though the vernacular form
I based this entry on did not appear on the item itself. We did, however,
have special problems. Many titles were total daytshmerizms and had no
equivalent, e.g. Die Wahrheit, which had a vernacular title lacking the
komets or the pasakh to indicate how this should be transcribed. In those
cases I made entries under vahrhayt, vorheyt, etc. I'm sure fellow
librarian Zachary Baker knows what I'm talking about.

Forgive me Zellig on one point, after which I'm going to sign off; isn't
to wish, in Yiddish vintshn, not vinshn? I accept your good wishes with a
friendly wink of an eye! A gjt yuer aakh alemyn, fjl mit mazl jn
parnuusy!

Re: Zellig Bach's posting in 4.102.

A sheynem dank, tayerer Zelig.  Ikh pleske bravo.  Nor eyn zakh.  Anshot
"kh'vinsh aykh..." baym sof fun ayer brivl zol shteyn "kh'vintsh aykh..."
Azoy meyn ikh, khotsh ikh bin nisht aza groyser meyvn af oyslege oder
gramatike.

Now I must switch to English for my next thought.  Among the worst
offenses re: inconsistency in transliteration of Yiddish is the
following.  Sometimes we read mensch (or mensh) when the original sounded
mentsh.  Mentsh is Yiddish with all its attendant richness of meaning and
implied nobility.  Mensch is German, different in sound, and carries only
part of the meaning in mentsh, one of the finest creations that the
Yiddish language hammered out during its long, arduous evolution.

Subject: Zellig Bach's comments on spelling & Romanization

I have three comments:

1. I personally, as one guilty of slovenly spelling of Yiddish (double d
OK in English!), am grateful for the care taken and will TRY to take the
advice given. This is just the kind of constructive criticism that is
helpful.

2. I can't help remarking that in earlier days English spelling was not
at all standardized and that no disrespect to the language was implied by
the habit of Elizabethans to use whatever spelling occurred to them.

3. I repeat an earlier plea that those of us who know and love Yiddish
from our having learned it aurally not be made to feel that our
contributions are not wanted in Mendele because of our unsystematic
spelling and grammatical errors.

Subject: Correct Yiddish spelling

To: Zellig Bach re: Vol. 4.102

Thank you for your excellent letter.  Being a strictly Kitchen Yiddish
learner (Russian Yiddish, yet), I found your information to be very
informative, and interestingly presented as well.

I am printing it out to refer to, and would appreciate seeing more on
this topic from you, in the future.

With most of the posts I have read on Mendele, I find I am quite often
somewhat out of my depth, and if I might, I would like to ask, what is
meant by "macaronism"?  And, most of the spellings given are based on
German, Polish or Lithuanian interpretations. Would the variations I've
learned from my parents (Russian Jews), be an incorrect dialect, or are
they another correct version of Yiddish?

One more little footnote. <G> I just made an interesting discovery. I
remember hearing my father saying, disdainfully about someone, that he
was a "puste bucher." Now, after all these years, I realize he meant the
man was a shallow person. (Am I right?)

Subject: Zellig Bach's Teachings

I thought Zellig Bach's posting about correct tranliteration of Yiddish
into the English alphabet was excellent.  I keep trying to spell
according to the accepted conventions, but when I read the Mendele
postings, I sometimes become dazed and confused.  Z's notes were not
exhaustive, but were a good summary of the most common types of mistakes.

Also, I appreciated the tone of Z's posting.  It did not seem overly
elitist, or highbrow, or snobbish, or critical to me, even though Z
obviously has the credentials to be as judgemental as he likes.  As a
beginner in Yiddish myself, I can testify that having enough respect for
the language and the culture to try to learn it correctly does not
automatically cause the kind of self-consciousness/psychological blocks
associated with intimidation.  Mendele is not intimidating. Thank you.
