Subject: Yosl Birshteyn o"h

Yosl Birshteyn who died in Jerusalem last week was a bi-lingual
Yiddish-Hebrew writer with a sharp eye and mind and was a keen observer of
the lives of ordinary Jews. In the 1940's he lived in Melbourne and served
in the Australian army during the war. He emigrated to Israel in 1949 and
settled on a kibbutz where he worked as a shepherd for many years. He
published 17 books and his novels and short stories were well received in
Israel and around the Jewish world. Adam Gruzman in Jerusalem interviewed
Yosl Birshteyn after his book of short stories "On the Streets of
Jerusalem" was published in the mid '80's.

To hear the author read two of his short stories from that book, go to

Subject: Introduction

You requested some biographical information.  I am the youngest son of the
Poet Chaim Leib Fox and Lea Greenbaum Fox.  Yiddish is my first language,
although I never developed it to the literary level that I wish I had.  
Still, I maintain an active Yiddish cultural life.  I am a
sometime-Yiddish folksinger. I am also one of the authors and performers
of the successful Yiddish-English show "Kids and Yiddish" at the
Folksbiene.  I have performed with the Joseph Papp Yiddish theater and
have co-directed the Yiddish Theater Workshop in the Oxford Summer
program.  For several years I taught the Gezang class at the Columbia
summer program. Among my other interests, I am a practicing child
psychologist.

Subject: Rikuda Potash

[Editorial Remark: This note has been slightly abridged. For the 
full text, please contact Michael Fox directly (foxolini1@aol.com).]

I have been forwarded several notices posted on Mendele that refer to
Rikuda Potash.  Several years ago Yael Chaver, who was then writing her
dissertation, contacted me about her because of my father's connection to
the poet.  It raised many questions in me about the intertwining of
feminism and personality, especially in those early days. It also
rekindled my efforts to find Rikuda's daughter, Aviva. Alas, to no avail.

You see, my father, Chaim Leib Fuks, the poet, was introduced to Rikuda by
his sister Manya, who was Rikuda's close friend.  He married Rikuda in
Lodz, around 1929-30.  Aviva is my father's daughter.

When the couple separated in 1934, Rikuda took Aviva to Palestine.  My
father followed them there that same year, I presume to maintain at least
some contact with his daughter.  He stayed in Palestine until 1938, I
believe.  I suspect that Rikuda would have little to do with him and he
finally gave up. I am fairly certain that he wrote letters to his daughter
when he returned to Poland. Whether she got them, I don't know.

I do know that after the war, my father repeatedly tried to contact Aviva.
When I was old enough to understand that my father had had a previous
family, when I was eleven, I saw my father write letters to her.  I also
saw them returned unopenned. Aviva was living in America by then. He knew
her address because his sister Manya maintained contact with her niece. At
one point aunt Manya came to visit us in New York. She went to see Aviva
(somewhere outside Philadelphia, I think) and brought her a letter from my
father.  She refused it, and she could not be persuaded to have any
contact with him.  But he would not be disuaded by this rebuff. He kept
writing to her, for how long, I do not know. At one point when I was about
fourteen, he asked me to write to her in his behalf. It was a kind of
letter of recommendation to my half-sister to give our parent a chance.  
My letter was also returned unopenned.

A few years later, my cousin Arthur, the son of my father's sister Freyde
Guteh, visited Israel and went to see Rikuda at her office in Jeruasalem.
Twenty years after her separation from Chaim Leib, she was cold with rage at
the intrusion by his nephew, and she showed Arthur the door.

My father kept up with Rikuda's activities through their mutual cultural
contacts.  When Rikuda was honored in New York, about a year before her
death, my father, who was on the executive board of the Yiddish PEN Club,
brought her a bouquet of flowers, infuriating my mother, who was there
with him. Yet, my mother understood the old flame in my father's heart and
also his desparate attempt to gain favor in order to see his lost
daughter.  I don't know how Rikuda received my father or his flowers. He
died in 1984, shortly after he received the National Yiddish Book Award
for his last volume of poems, never having seen Aviva again.

Subject: Yiddish at the movies

I'm wondering what the quality of the Yiddish spoken in the film "Ivan
and Abraham" is?  Are (any of) the actors native speakers?  I ran across
a review that mentioned that although much of the dialogue is in Polish,
only one of the actors is a native speaker of Polish, and wondered what
the situation is with respect to the Yiddish speakers in the film.

A sheynem dank,

Kevin Cohen

Does anyone know where I can get the answers to the exercises in 
Weinreich's College Yiddish?

A Dank,
