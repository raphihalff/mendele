i'm getting a demo disk from Nisus: its creators like it.
does anyone have experience & knowledge of it?

My wife uses Nisus, as does Dovid Braun (he'll perhaps
respond to your query also).  As far as I know, Nisus is
quite good, except that there are still a lot of bugs.
However, my wife was able to speak to somebody at Nisus,
who has been, upto now, able/capable of figuring out
solutions to the bugs.

I have, myself, used Nisus for Tamil wordprocessing and
have found it decent--it's sufficiently similar to
Microsoft Word, with which I am more familiar.

Does anyone know how far back the sequence "Sholom
aleichem...Aleichem sholom" is attested?

Subject: In re: Maykholim made with matse mel

One of my favorite childhood memories is my grandmother's
wonderful kneydlekh. But when I tell friends that they were
stuffed with -- raspberry preserves-- everyone is either
shocked or incredulous. But, af an emes, these pukhike
kneydlekh were served in good chicken soup. Are there any
other mendelenikes out there (litvakes, of course) who know
of similar stuffings of kneydlekh?

Subject: The complete Internatsional

[Here, because it's May Day, is the absolutely last time
that the Internatsional will be reproduced on Mendele.  It
is also not improbable that this is the last time it will
_ever_ be reproduced for a Yiddish-speaking audience.]

[I'm sure also that Bob Rothstein meant to mention that the
song is from a collection co-edited by the poet Itzik
Fefer, the same Itzik Fefer whom Stalin caused to be
murdered a few years later.]

1) [Internatsional]

        As with most anthems--and the "Internatsional" was
the Soviet national anthem until the "Groyse foterlendishe
milkhome"--people tend to know and sing the first stanza
and the chorus.  For my fellow pedants, however, here is
the full Yiddish text, as printed in Beregovski and Fefer's
_Yidishe folks-lider_ (Kiev, 1938): Shteyt oyf, ir ale ver
vi shklafn In hunger lebn muz un noyt! Der gayst, er kokht,
er ruft tsum vafn, In shlakht undz firn iz er greyt.

                Di velt fun gvaldhaytn un leydn
                Tseshtern veln mir, un dan --
                Fun frayhayt, glaykhhayt a ganeydn
                Bashafn vet der arbets-man.

                        Dos iz shoyn undzer letster
                        Un antsheydener shtrayt.
                        Mit der international
                        Shteyt oyf, ir arbetslayt.

                Neyn, kinder, vet undz nit bafrayen --
                Nit Got aleyn un nit keyn held,
                Mit undzer eygenem kleyzayen
                A retung brengen mir der velt.

                Arop der yokh!  Genug gelitn!
                Genug fargosn blut un shveys!
                Tseblozt dos fayer, lomir shmidn,
                Kolzman dos ayzn iz nokh heys!

                        Dos iz shoyn...

                Der arbets-man vet zayn memshole
                Farshpreytn af der gantser erd,
                Un parazitn di mapole
                Bakumen veln fun zayn shverd.

                Di groyse shturem-teg -- zey veln
                Nor far tiranen shreklekh zayn,
                Zey konen ober nit farshteln
                Far undz di hele zunen-shayn.

                        Doz iz shoyn...

[My transliteration reproduces some peculiarities of Soviet
orthography and punctuation.]

2) [To Dovid Braun, from no. 219]

        Yes, the line you quote is presumably Polish _moja
z.ona Ro'z.yczka_.

Subject: hrushovski's book

To Arnold Band:

Very minor comments (haven't even read part 2 yet):  Max
Weinreich's _History of the Yiddish Language_ has only been
translated in part.  The first two volumes of the Yiddish,
i.e. the text, have been translated (by Shlomo Noble with
the assistance of Joshua A. Fishman) but the last two
volumes, the footnotes, have not been
translated.ovski/Harshav writes in Yiddish.  He never did
much of this and hasn't done it for a long time, probably
because, in his estimation, the readership is already dead.
