Just to add to Dr. Glasser's etymology of "tsholent": The word would not be
derived directly from the Latin "calentem," but rather by way of a French
derivative from the latter, since it begins, not with /k/, as in Latin, but
with /tsh/.  "C" before "a" regularly became "ch" in French (pronounced
/tsh/ in Old French, in Modern French /sh/); thus "canis" > "chien,"
"cattus" > "chat," "caput" > "chef."

Subject: tsholnt

Commenting on my suggestion that "petsha" may be a corruption of the French
"pied chaud" (heated foot), in analogy to the more familiar derivation of
"cholent" from "chaud lent" (slowly heated), Hershl Glasser rejects the
former in favor of Max Weinreich's derivation from the Latin "calentem"
"(approx.) being heated,", and adds: "to prove that "petsha" derives from
"pied chaud," you would have to explain, for example, why the final /o/
sound in French yields /a/ in Yiddish."

Not being a philologist, I do not presume to "prove" anything. However, I
can't see why transformation of  the "ca" in "calentem" to "cho" in
"cholent" is any more (or less) reasonable than that of "chaud" in "pied
chaud" to "tsha" in "petsha," which - for all I know - may well have been
pronounced "petsho" several hundred years ago.

Hershl Glasser  is certainly right in arguing that "you cannot ascertain an
etymology merely from a chance phonetic resemblance," but isn't it equally
true that you cannot reject an etymology merely from a chance phonetic
variation?

Subject: -lekh

re: Felicitas Payk's query concerning the diminutive plural suffix "-lekh"
[17.006:8], the simple answer is that the Slavic and Semitic components are
not involved here. The suffix is totally Germanic and exists to this day in
certain Bavarian dialects.

Subject: -ekh

-ekh is a plural ending in Franconian and related dialects of German.
Probably, it is related to a plural form that is something like -es because
s and some sort of aspirated consonant often interchange in Indo-European
languages. In Slavic languages we often come across instrumental plurals
like -ych/-ich which are probably related to Latin dative/ablative in -is.
In Ostjiddisch one might speculate that the Slavic plural forms in -
ych/-ich might have reinforced an imported Franconian ending.

Subject: krasny bilet

Vegn Krasny bilet:  I know it in two meanings:  a)  in the modern sense of
the red ticket for a soccer infraction and b) as a "scarlet letter"= a
ticket given to prostitutes by the authorities.

Subject: krasny bilet

I don't have anything solid, but I can think of 2 aspects of the term which
I think have been unconsidered:  (1) "Krasny Bilet" as "Red Card" might
refer to membership card in the Communist Party.  (2) "Krasny" (in Russian
and in Slovak, at least) means both "red" and "beautiful."  Also, what
other meaning exist for "bilet"? In French (billet) and Russian (bilyet),
it could mean "ticket."  Looking forward to some Mendelyaner's solution(s).
Keep up the good work.

Subject: loksh

Regarding Mike Hirsch's comment (July 20) on "loksh": in  my own experience
with Litvishe kitchen-Yiddish, the word "loksh," in reference to persons,
appeared only in conjunction with  "lang," as in "Er is geven a lange
loksh."  In my family's lingo, I took "lange loksh" to be the equivalent of
American "string bean," to describe a tall, skinny fellow.  I never heard
the word "loksh" used as a substitute for "an Italian" (as Mike Hirsch
reports).  That usage, bv  the way -- a national food substituting for
personhood -- is similar to an earlier American usage, "Kraut" (cabbage)
for "(a) German."  Not pretty in the latter case, and maybe not in the
former case, either ("spaghetti" as an epithet for "Italian").  And then
there's "frog" for the French.

Does anyone know of any Yiddish food words that are used in reference to
ourselves, generically?

Subject: loksh

On July 20, Mike Hirsch asked wether a loksh was a slang term for Italian
in Philadelphia.  Well, lokshn (literally noodles in Yiddish) was a slang
term for Italians in New York City, in Toronto and in Alberta. So I assume
that this usage was universal in English-speaking North America. I don't
know about Mexico or Quebec.  This usage was part of New World Yiddish.
Quoting directly my father, "When we were in Russia, we didn't even hear of
Italians."
