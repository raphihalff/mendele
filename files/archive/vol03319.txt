Tsum shames iz ongekomen dos folgendes:

Dear Mikhl Herzog,

  I don't know which I am more, shamed by the dressing down that you gave
me over my recent column in the Forward about the Yiddish variants
"mayse/manse", or pleased to be told that you are among the column's
"loyal readers", but probably it's the second of the two. In apology for
the mistakes that I made there, mainly my overlooking the fact that
nasalization takes place in Western Yiddish too, I can only say that
unfortunately, in the conflict between the need to meet journalistic
deadlines and the duty to doublecheck what one thinks one knows, dead-
lines sometimes win out. My situation would be better if I indeed were
writing from the "perch in Jerusalem" that you mistakenly think I occupy.
I actually live in a small rural town far from both Jerusalem and
adequate libraries, my lack of access to which makes things difficult.
Indeed, one of the reasons that I chose to use a pseudonym in writing the
column, which originally appeared in a short-lived Israeli English
newspaper called The Nation, was that I am only too conscious of being an
amateur in the field of Jewish linguistics. In The Nation, where my
columns largely had to do with Hebrew, which I am fluent in and have a
good literary and historical knowlege of, the chutzpah was perhaps not so
great, but in the Forward, where writing for an American Jewish audience
obliges me to deal frequently with Yiddish, a language that I taught
myself to read freely but never stu- died formally and do not speak well,
I may occasionally get in over my head. I trust that you and other
contributors to Mendele will keep letting me know when I do. And I would
also like to say how much I enjoy Mendele's pages, from which I have
learned a great deal. When it comes to loyal readers, you have one in me.

To M.Y. Sweet

About the quote from ''Grine felder'':

Ikh volt nit sdonzhen aza zakh tsu dzhvingen oyf di pleytses" sdonzhen:
to manage to cf. polish zda,zac (I dont have the proper diacritics, it is
read: zdonzhatsh: " to manage" dzhvingen: to lift, to carry, cf. Polish
dzwigac (,dzhvigatsh') I encountered the same sentence years ago when I
started yiddish, and it also puzzled me to see these two slavisms in one
sentence.

Good luck for your reading.

Subject: Sholem Aleichem's letters re: Tevye

As I indicated in my last posting, I'm sending my translations of
Sholem Aleichem letters to Mordecai Spector, editor of
Hoyz-Fraynd regarding preparation of the first Tevye story.

These are the first two letters in a series.

        Letter One:

Kiev, September 21, 1894 (5655)

To Mordecai Spector (who was in Warsaw)

Colleague!  May a Happy New Year be inscribed and sealed for you.

     First, as our ancient tradition teaches us, I wish you, at the dawn
of this brand new year, good fortune and happiness. Second, I confess I
have sinned against you.  Now listen to this! Your second letter came
when I was away in Boyarka in a country home.  So I was away from my Kiev
home when your first letter arrived.  It reached me later.  Only then did
I understand that I had falsely suspected you of failing to write, and
conceived a false accusation against a righteous and utterly honorable
person.  Merciful God, save us!  God may forgive me because I am not
actually responsible.  And you will surely forgive me.  The eve of Yom
Kippur nears.  We must not put on airs, and must forgive each other all
sins....

     Well, then, why did I not answer you?  Because I did not accept your
proposal [concerning a contribution to the Yontef Bletlekh, Spector's
publishing venture in partnership with I.L. Peretz.], and I have not yet
been able to comply with your request for a story for volume four of
Hoyz-Fraynd.  To promise and not come through, now that's really a sin.
And so it is better for me to delay my response to you.  But when all is
said and done, I will give you a story if you have space and time. Space:
a full printer's sheet.  Time: one month.  The title will be Tevye Der
Milkhiker.  I composed it in Boyarka.  That is, I heard the yarn from
Tevye himself as he stood beside his horse and wagon, weighing cheese and
butter for us.  The story is interesting, but Tevye himself is a thousand
times more so.  I transmit his story in his own words, and I don't have
to describe him for he describes himself.  I say a full printer's sheet:
maybe more, maybe less.  My honorarium shall be a couple of hundred
copies on vellum paper, bound in soft paper covers, nicely cut, elegantly
wrapped.  Also, you should forward the two hundred copies before the
Hoyz-Fraynd appears.  It's understood that I don't need the copies to do
business.  This won't interfere with Hoyz-Fraynd sales.  If these
conditions are agreeable to you, reply right away; and I will sit down on
the spot to write it all down.  In any case, please answer my letter
conveying full forgiveness so that "if my sins be as threads of red silk,
they shall become snow-white."  Again, I wish you a good year with a heap
of blessings from the bottom of my heart.

Your constant friend, Sholem Aleichem.

P.S. My brother (Vevik Rabinowitz) and sister-in-law from Berdichev send
warm regards.  I was their guest not long ago.

        Letter Two:

Kiev, September 26, 1894.

Dear Colleague!

     Lucky for you, your letter caught up with me while supper is not yet
ready, my wife and children are still out, I'm starving to death and
can't get down to work.  No dancing before dining! So I take pen in hand
to answer your letter.

     Agreed.  Your wish is granted.  In one month, that is, by October
20, God willing, you will receive the piece I promised entitled Tevye Der
Milkhiker, the story of how he suddenly made good.  It is told by Tevye
himself, reported word for word by Sholem Aleichem.

     As I've already mentioned, I will not sell the 200 copies I want
from you, but to put your mind at ease, send only fifty copies for the
time being.  The other hundred and fifty, later. And so, my friend, be
inscribed favorably for 5655, which is the wish for you from Sholem
Aleichem

Subject: The Telzer Yeshiva

I am currently edited my great-great-uncle's autobiography.
He wrote that his father was a student in the Telzer
Yeshiva in Poland in the last century.  My limited collection
of Judaic history has no information on this yeshiva.
Does anyone have any information on the Telzer Yeshiva, such
as location, date of founding, which family ran it, any
famous students, and descendants of the yeshiva in the US
today?

Email or posted responses will be gratefully read.

Misha Auslin
