Subject: Moyshe-rabeynus kiele

Spanish and Italian also have names for the ladybug that are connected
with the Virgin Mary.  If anyone has access to volume 6 of the Spanish
journal _Revista de Dialectologia y Tradiciones Populares_, there is
apparently a relevant article on pp. 625-39.

If there are any Mendelyaner in Zurich, they might be able to report on a
1932 dissertation by Dora Aebi, _Der Marienkaefer, seine franzoesischen
Namen und seine Bedeutung im Volksglauben und Kinderspruch_.  Otherwise
I'll report back when (if) I get it through interlibrary loan.  (Such is
the degree of stimulation that Mendele provides!)

Subject: mit lib aykh ayer gast

Joseph Sherman:

_mit lib aykh ayer gast_ is said by a person entering the house of
another who happens to be hosting a guest at the moment.  The host
replies _mit lib zolt ir lebn_.  I don't know of any such custom in
English (besides, perhaps:  "Sorry for bothering you, I didn't know you
were having company" -- but the greeter in the Yiddish scene may actually
have known before entering that the house owner is entertaining at the
time).

Subject: Greetings

The expression that Joseph Sherman is inquiring about should probably be
rendered:

"(got) lib aykh mit ayere gest!"

It is said _to the host by the person arriving_ when another guest is
present.

The host's usual reply is "mit lib zolt ir lebn".

That should help in understanding, if not in translating, it. No?

Subject: Recordings of Misha Alexandrovich

In Mendele Vol. 4.413, Meyer David mentioned that Misha A. has made many
recordings including some in Yiddish.  Does anyone know who produced the
Yiddish recordings, and where they can be obtained?

Subject: Yiddish to Russian Dictionary

In answer to the question about the existence of a Yiddish to Russian
dictionary, there is one published after the one that was published in
Minsk in 1941. This is Gennady Estraikh's Kratkiy Idish-Russish Slovar'
(Short Yiddish-Russian Dictionary) which was published in two parts in
the supplement to Sovietish Heimland, #6, and #8 for 1990. I have heard
rumors about another even more recent Yiddish to Russian dictionary, but
whenever I inquire about it, it turns out to be Shapiro's Russian to
Yiddish dictionary and not one in the other direction.

Subject: Query re Columbia/YIVO Summer Course

I'd very much appreciate hearing from anyone about this 6-week course,
especially about its quality given the cost.  I already have a curriculum
outline and so am familiar with the content.  Please reply directly to me
as there's no need to burden the list, and also for confidentiality. A
shainem dank dertzu,
