Subject: Transcription and rigidity

Just took a look again at Uriel and Beatrice Weinreich's Say It in
Yiddish (Dover) (the National Yiddish Book Center sent it) and
noticed that it uses a completely non-YIVO phonetic transcription,
undoubtedly the uniform system of Dover's series.  So we shouldn't
get too far up on our linguistic high horses. E.g. # 288 ZIT (I with
a macron) ah-zoy GOOT, FORT pah-MEH-leh-khehr.  Though that sure
looks ludicrous to me.

Subject: "kamershpil", "kleynkunst-teater"

The entry for the writer-photographer Alter Kacyzne in a Yiddish
biographical dictionary mentions his "kamershpil" _Esther_, and also
his poems (or songs) for Yiddish "kleynkunst-teaters".  Can someone
tell me how to translate the terms in quotation marks?  A dank.

Subject: Introduction

This is my first communication to Mendele.  Mendele happens to be my
father's name, he being deceased for quite a while.  Opening up ny
Yiddish  memory brings up the times when we used to travel on the
subway from Brooklyn to Manhattan, when he would speak to me aloud
in Yiddish while I answered him in English.  He could speak in
English but wasn't comfortable in it.  I found this embarassing, but
I never told him not speak in Yiddish. My grandfather lived with us
and communication with him was strictly in Yiddish.

Subject: a yidisher oysdruk?

I've seen, in several places, the expression "kol koyre bamidber,"
which comes from Isaiah.  But is this a genuine Yiddish expression
(whatever that means) or a borrowing from Christian sources.  I ask
this because, according to the Jewish tradition, the verse in Isaiah
is read, "A voice calls out; in the desert . . .," a reading that is
attested to by the _trop_, or cantillation.

Subject: European Jewry

I have what must be a really elementary question, but since I don't
know the answer, I'll ask.  Where did European Jewry come from?  I
know that there were Jews in ancient Rome, of course, but I don't
see how they could have grown and spread throughout Europe.  I
clearly look European rather than Middle Eastern (excuse the
stereotyping), but where did my ancestors come from?  It only
recently occurred to me that when I think of, say, Rabbi Akiva, I
think of him looking European.  Talk about ethnocentrism|

Thanks in advance for your answers.

Ted Steinberg
