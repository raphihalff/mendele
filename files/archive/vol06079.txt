Subject: Gedempt and dampf

Zellig Bach discusses [6.077] the adjectival participle "gedempt."
Actually the etymology is as `follows.  The root word is the medieval
German noun "dampf" (modern German "Dampf") meaning "steam."  The German
verb "daempfen" (my internet keyboard has no umlauts) meaning "stew,
braise," etc. was formed in late proto-Teutonic and is still used in
modern German.  Yiddish has "damf" for "steam", but the derivatives
"dempik" (humid) and "dempn" (stew, braise) do not have an "f"--so the
noun may have been taken over at a different place or time than the
adjective or the verb.  The modern Yiddish formations "dampfer"
("steamer") and "dampfshif" may have originated in Yiddish, but I would
suspect that they were taken over wholesale from modern German "Dampfer"
and "Dampfschiff."

Subject: Yiddish courses and libraries

I believe that in Metropolitan Toronto both the University of Toronto
(was reported on the list) and York University (not listed) teach
Yiddish.

Subject: Floppy disk with Yiddish

Those Mendelyaners who also receive Fishl's Der Bay may remember the
Bible scenes by Edward Goldman which Fishl published in transliteration.
I have converted more than a dozen of these stories into Yiddish on my
Macintosh using my Nisus Hebrew program.  I am interested in seeing if a
floppy disk is a good way to send Yiddish material.  If any of you have
the Nisus Hebrew capability, I would be happy to send you a floppy disk
with these stories.  Just send me a request with your snail mail
address.  All I ask is that you let me know if you were able to bring up
the stories on your Macintosh screen.  I have had no problem doing this
on my system.
