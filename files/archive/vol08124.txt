Distinguished Lecturer Series, The Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center,
The Department of Slavic Studies and The Center of Eastern European and
Eurasian Studies with the support of the Hillel House

Participants: internationally distinguished scholars of Yiddish literature
and specialists of Isaac Bashevis Singer's works

The international Conference on Isaac Bashevis Singer taking place at the
Harry Ransom Center is gratis and open to the public.  This conference
brings together the world's leading scholars of Yiddish literature and the
specialists of Isaac Bashevis Singer (1908-1991), the Nobel Prize Winner.
The setting is most appropriate for the HRC is the major center of Bashevis
Singer's manuscripts. The scholars will lecture in English on various
aspects of his accomplishments. Bashevis Singer will be studied from
literary, biographical, psychoanalytic, linguistic and cultural
perspectives. 

One of the purposes of this congress is to emphasize that this master writer
created in the Yiddish language and from the inheritance of the traditional
Jewish Eastern European world.  The meeting will reveal how and why Isaac
Singer was the creator of his pen name in Yiddish, Isaac Bashevis, adding
his mother's name, by which he was always known in Yiddish and how he
created his English language persona, Isaac Bashevis Singer. His literary
masterpieces which are so appreciated in English translation are in fact
often quite different in emphasis and in endings from the Yiddish,. This
meeting will clarify the reasons for his literary, cultural and ideological
manoeuvres which make this great literary figure so fascinating both as a
Yiddish and English writer and as a person. 

Scholars from as far away as Israel, South Africa and Poland, besides
France, Great Britain and Canada are coming to Austin to participate in
these meetings. It is one of the most historical gatherings of Yiddish
specialists in the world. Certainly it is the first time that Austin and the
University of Texas at Austin has ever presented such a gathering devoted to
Yiddish literature and culture. Bashevis Singer visited Austin many years
ago and the University has always been a center of Yiddish cultural studies
and so it is appropriate that a major conference on this Nobel Prize winner
takes place here in Texas. 

The public is welcome and invited to attend.

Thanks,
Seth Wolitz
