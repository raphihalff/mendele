Subject: Havdala

I would appreciate receiving suggestions of readings (prose and poetry)
in Yiddish (and/or English translation) about havdala for a program
that I am putting together.  Thanks in advance for your suggestions.

Subject: Children's Street Rhymes and Games

For this year's family festival in early October, Yiddishkayt LA is
using a Lower East Side theme.  I'm trying to track down some research
materials on what games were played and perhaps, ideally, find some
songs, nonsense and jump-rope rhymes (Yiddish is fine, but
English-Yiddish intermixed is ideal - one can dream).  I've got the
Ruth Rubin/ Folkways recording, but that is definitely alte heym and
I'm looking for naye alte heym.  Any suggestions are welcome.

I would also be interested in hearing from anyone who remembers
children's songs, rhymes or play games in Yiddish or in combined
English and Yiddish from their own pre-WWII NY childhood.  Any
recollections of the games played on the streets of the Lower East
Side, Bronx or Brooklyn pre-WWII are also welcome.  Please feel free to
contact me off list (with the street games) or on the list for the
Yiddish and Yiddish/English children's rhymes.

a sheynem dank!

Subject: Almi poem

Dear Mendelyaner,

I'm looking for information about a poem attributed to Almi in a
recording recently donated to our archives.  The text begins (as best
as I can determine): "fun land tsu land, fun shtot tsu shtot, es faln
shver di oygn tsu."  Thanks in advance for any help,

Subject: Yiddish 'pig Latin'

My mother and uncle, who grew up in Galicia during the 1930s-1940s,
told me that as children they used to speak in a kind of pig Latin when
they didn't want their parents to understand them.  It was somewhat
similar to American pig Latin:  the first consonant of a word was moved
to the end, and the suffix -tye was added.  Thus, the word VUS became
US-V'TYE (the accent fell on the V', and the ' was pronounced like a
schwa).  Have any Mendelyaners heard of this or any other type of
Yiddish 'pig Latin'?

Subject: translation question

Mendelyaner-

I'm desperately searching for the translation of a word that appeared
in the title of an article from a 1926 Soviet Yiddish newspaper,
Yidisher poyer The headline reads

Corn + Pigs = farzhankes

Any help on the last word would be of great assistance.

Thanks,

Subject: Spinoza in a yiddish context

Dear Mendele-friends,

as requested at your homepage a few lines about me: I am a solicitor,
working at the municipality of Hanover, Germany. I am working in my
free time on philosophical and yiddish issues. Hopefully I will compled
my doctorad in this field in future. Actually I work on a bibliography
"Spinoza in Yiddish Language" wich shall appeare in autuum at the
"Studia Spinozana", an academical yearbook published by the german
Spinoza-Society.

In context with this bibliography your site was recomended to my by
Jerry Kalpan from the Anarchist Arcive Project whom I asked if he knows
about Spinoza discussed among the anarchistic workers movement in there
yiddish publications. Since he does not read yiddish he could not help
me but suggested to ask you.

In difference to hebrew yiddish as a cultural context of discussing
Spinoza is not explored yet and I hope my bibliography will provide a
base for that. Untill now I found 175 titles/articles e.a. but I am
sure this is just a accidental part of a much larger field. The
anarchistic context is neglected a well. Perhaps you know someone who
can give me a hint on that.

All the best and shana towa!
Kay Schweigmann-Greve

Subject: Yiddish Theater Forum

To Leonard Prager and Joel Berkowitz re: TMR v6, no8.

Your Joint Issue of TMR 6.0081 and YTF 1.001 is superb. It is an
excellent start. There is a very impressive list of Honorary and
Advisory experts. In may cases they are for prestige and showcase, but
have not been utilized. A publication, organization, company and
especially political parties can be compared to a triangle. There must
be a large base to have a solid foundation.

First, no note was made of current centers of active Yiddish theater in
Canada, New York and Israel or their leadership. Second, there are
still a few Yiddish thespians around, like Chayale Ash, who are a rich
resource. Third, I do hope you will also be publishing a hardcopy. It
is wonderful to keep it on an academic plane, but to have a broad and
lasting base, you must articles which could be used as a basis for
discussion by Yiddish clubs.

With Dr. Gottesman aboard you will have good coverage. there will be
future notices in Der Bay. We hope to have a future Conference where
the theme would be The Yiddish Theater.

Once again, to both of you, all the wonderful wishes for success in
your venture. Hot a gezunte yor. Az es vet zayn a gezunte yor, vet es
zayn a gute yor.

mit frayndshaft,

Subject: Yiddish Theater Forum

I support with great fervor the establishment of the Yiddish Theater
Forum as introduced by Leonard Prager in Vol. 6, No. 8 of the Mendele
Review.  The early Yiddish theater was certainly an expression of the
culture of a people spreading out from Eastern Europe in the late
1800's, and an exchange of views on this medium would be of great
value.

I would like to point out to the membership that there already exists a
Yiddish Theater and Vaudeville (YT&V) Research Group, hosted under the
kind auspices of the JewishGen web site.  While some of the messages
already distributed (and archived) in the group's file relate to the
history and highlights of the Yiddish stage, the thrust of the YT&V
group is to assist members in locating family and friends who
contributed to Yiddish theater and Vaudeville. Besides the playwrights
and actors, the YT&V members are concerned with those who ran the
theaters, composed the music, worked backstage to make the production a
success and formed the leadership of the Hebrew Actors Union, Yiddish
Theatrical Alliance, etc.

My involvement with the YT&V stems from family roots that include
"Professor" Moshe Hurwitz HaLevi, and brother Aaron (my great
grandfather), adopted daughter Charlotte Hurwitz, and son-in-law Sezar
Greenberg.  Reading about their lives as written by David Lifson and
Nahma Sandrow and reported on the pages of Die Yiddische Bihne, Jewish
Theatrical News and even the New York Times, helps recreate an
environment gone for nearly 100 years..  Match that with plays about
blood libels (Tissa Esler), pogroms (Hurban Kishinev), natural
disasters and social consciousness such as the Johnstown Flood and the
Homestead strike, you understand more about the audiences that
apparently craved those "emotional" productions, until replaced by more
"sophisticated" material.

I hope the Mendele--YTF membership joins the moderated JewishGen--YT&V
group and contributes to both lists as appropriate. I certainly
encourage the YT&V members to be aware of the new YTF and to be active
in its success. More information about the goals of theYT&V can be
found at http://www.jewishgen.org/infofiles/ytheatre.txt

Subject: help with tzimmes

Dear Mendele: 

Some kind soul reading the ganse megilla site gave me your name as one
likely to be enough of a maven to answer my query: what is the origin
of the word tsimmes, or tzimmes -- I don't need an explanation of the
culinary concoction or the meaning of the expression machen a ganse
tzimmes -- I grew up on both -- what no one ever told me or any friends
and neighbours here in Jerusalem is where the word comes from --
etymology etc. Can you help. Anyway, shanah tovah to you and your
colleagues,

Dvorah Getzler
