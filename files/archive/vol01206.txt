I'm a new subscriber to MENDELE, and every issue git mir a
tzitter un iz fahr mir a machiah. My problem is that I
learned Yiddish as a child and have never seen it
transliterated from the Hebrew orthography, as can be seen
from the above attempt. Until BITNET/INTERNET acquires a
Yiddishe Kop, where do I find the appropriate rules about
transliteration.

Subject: please and ay/aa

In re Zev Bar-Lev's questions:

> Is _ish
> bet_ ever used to request something, and/or that someone do
> something?

Sure, "ikh bet dikh" can be used for "please".

> (2) Is the diphthong _ai_ always contractable to _aa_ (long

That's a fair approximation.  I think some dialects are
more likely to preserve the y-glide word-finally, but
that's a detail.  One could also cite a few words where the
-y- is originally intervocalic; words like "khayel" sound
rather like "khayl" even in the southern dialects. "fleysh"
of course is a different matter; words pronounced "ey" in
Yivo-loshn are "ay" (flaysh) most places in the south.  To
make things interesting, *some* of these "ey" words,
"fleysh" among them, are pronounced "aa" in West Yiddish
(e.g., Germany, etc.), but the correspondences are more
complicated (it works only of the MHG was "ei").

Ikh hob fargesn tsu dermonen dem vikhtikstn yoytse min
haklal tsu reb Zevs oyfdekung:

Any word borrowed in relatively recent times from a foreign
language will keep the /ay/ sound in all the dialects:
words like 'may' (the month) and 'pay' (the food) would be
pronounced /ay/ even by a southerner.

Subject: introduction

Hallo, es iz sheyn zu sehn az es zaynen do mentshen
farinteresirt in Yidish. Mayn nomen iz Dorota, ikh voyn in
Belgie un lern zikh Yidish  shoyn dos zvayte yor.

I am not sure what kind transkription you use, German and
Dutch language prefer to use sch instead of sh.

I am most intrested in literature. At the moment I'm
collecting everthing about early years of Dovid Bergelson.
Biografy, translations, articles, phd.thesis . I will be
glad to see more of your "dialog" so that I can see if I
can be useful. The texts of Bergelson, read in Yiddish, I
have to comment in Dutch of german, mostly in German. Once
a month I see prof. Niborsky in Paris, he gives the best of
Yiddish that you can get in Europe, I supose. But you don't
have something like you have in Oxford around him and
that's a pity.

I am a Polish national, living in Belgium, fron 1980 and
I've learned Yidishe oysyes for the first time about three
years ago.  Greetings.

Re the 'song' -- my mother used to alternate between 'hop
mayne homentashn' and 'hop meyne gretchaniki'.

Subject: Introduction

I teach Judaic studies and am chair of the Department of
Religion at Concordia University, Montreal, Canada.  I am
presently working on a book entitled _A Kabbalist in
Montreal: the Life and Times of Rabbi Yudel Rosen berg_
which deals, among other things, with the publication and
dissemination of "Hasidic" tales--in Yiddish and Hebrew--in
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
