Subject: Social justice as a Jewish value

Tayere Mendelyaner,
I'm looking for a poem with a theme of social justice as a Jewish value.

Preferably Yiddish with an English translation.  This is for our Boston
celebration of the 100th anniversary of The Workmen's Circle/Arbeter
Ring, a
gala event that will be held on April 29th.

Do you know of any such poem and where I can find it?

A sheynem dank.
Libe Gritz

Subject: Birobidzhan

Dear Mendele,

I am working on a project about the "Jewish Autonomoous Region," in
Russia
better known as Birobidzhan. There was an organization established in
the
United States in the mid-twenties by pro-Soviet American Jews
interesting
in promoting the agricultural settlement of Jews in the Soviet Union.
This
organization was "Association for Jewish Colonization in the Soviet
Union.
Known as ICOR, many Jews from the US who went to live in Birobidzhan
often
ended up living and working on the ICOR commune. I am looking for anyone

who was a member of ICOR, or is a child of a parent who belonged to ICOR

in the 20's and 30's. And I am interested in speaking to anyone who went

to Birobidzhan that came from outside of the Soviet Union.

a shaynem dank,
Yale Strom

Subject: Eliot parody

Hello:  I am looking for the Yiddish text of the famous parody of
Eliot's
Prufrock (by Bellow?)  Have you any idea where I might find it?

Many thanks,
Ezra Mendelsohn

Subject: oif kapores

The figurative meaning of "oif kapores" is that: once you used it, you
cannot use it again, so it is worthless. Or as Ignatz Bernstein puts it:

"An opgeshlogene kapore, toig oif kapores" worem an opgeshlogene kapore
ken men shoin nit mer banutsn.

Subject: oif kapores

To chaver Levine:  The usage of kapora, aside from the acte of "shlogen
kapores" is that someone or something "toyg off kapores"  meaning
his/hers/its only usefulness was as a kapora chicken. In other words,
worthless. There was a joke current where someone was invited to your
house before Yom Kippur. When the invitee asked "how come", the reply
was
"I can use you to "shlog kapores"

Hope this helps, mit harzige gruss,
Al (Avrum) Miller

Subject: timtum

Micheh Bazant asked for a source and information regarding the term
'timtum'.  I recommend that he look at the last chapter in the Tractate
Bikkurim.  The last chapter deals with the status of the androgynous
under
Jewish law and the last Mishne in the Tractate mentions tumtum.

Subject: dibbuks, golems, and other creatures

hi!

i thought i might introduce myself. my name is sarah and i'm a
first-year
college student hoping to study american culture. i'm also teaching
myself
yiddish and am interested in singing/playing klezmer.

i had a genral question--i am doing an independent study in yiddish
literature in translation, and am focusing on elements of the fantastic
(dybbuks, golems, people going crazy). i have rad a large amoung of i.b.

singer and many other authors, but i am afriad i'm missing someone or
something huge. the focus of my thesis is probably going to be these
fantastic elements and how they relate to women's sexuality and/or
madness.

any suggestions are greatly appreciated

Subject: gender-neutral names?

A friend asks, "Is there such thing in Hebrew as a 'gender-neutral'
name?"

I replied that I have met two women named Yonah, like the prophet Jonah,

and one named Simcha.  In both cases these are feminine nouns which have

mostly been used as male names.  I don't know, however, if their use as
female names is only a recent phenomenon.

In Yiddish, we have a woman friend named Frume-Berl; I've otherwise only

encountered Berl as a man's name.

Any other examples or information would be appreciated!
