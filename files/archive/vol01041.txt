mikhl,
slogn kapores?  I always understood shlogn (shlugn)
kapores (kapures). I am 99% sure that this is a typo,
but this being mikhl, there's a chance there's another
explanation (i.e. that slogn is completely bekivn).

I can't really give a good answer to the question of
WHAT variety of Yiddish is spoken in Antwerp. I assume
the variety is at least primarily based on geographic
origin. There are various relligious groups, but I
don't know whether it matters. Another determining
factor, I have been told, is whether the language used
to converse with the non-Jewish Flemish population is
primarily French (older generation and some of the
younger) or Dutch (part of the younger population). I
am afraid I am neither a Yiddish dialectologist nor a
sociolinguist nor a Yid. Last year, we had a graduate
student from New York visiting, who was all three, and
who was here to study the contact Dutch-Yiddish situa-
tion, but he found it very hard to get enough contacts
to do the work.

Dear Mendele: I rescind my halfbaked remarks on oif
tseluckhes, and on Kapoyre too. I got them straightened
out at a wedding on Saturday, by a professor who is
bringing out this year an anthology of Mendele himself!
translations. A big one. Marvin Zuckerman, and the book
will be from Joe Simon, a private publisher,  formerly
Ward Ritchie, the art books man of Santa Barbara. It
will be good to have a lot of that in new English.
Marvin is Chair at Valley City College in Van Nuys.
More of that later. JK
