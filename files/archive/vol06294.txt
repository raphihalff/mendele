Subject: Yom HaShoah

Today is Yom HaShoah, the Holocaust commemoration day. On the
Internet, in lieu of lighting the candles I am posting a poem by
Moyshe Teif "Af Gitke Taybeles Zavulek". I post this poem in memory of
my great- grandparents and their children, and all other victims of
the Holocaust.

Subject: Shund

A friend of mine would like to know the etymology of the word shund,
and how this particular word came to be applied to trashy theatre and
trashy literature.

With thanks,

Subject: Same word, different meanings

A clear distinction should be made between the Yiddish word _ali'ye,
with the stress on the second syllable, and the modern Hebrew word
_aliyA_, with the stress on the last syllable.

Both words are spelled the same in Y. & H. (ayen, lamed, yud, hey),
but in addition to be pronounced differently, they have distinctly
different histories and meanings.

The Yiddish _ali'ye_ is strictly a reference to a religious act, when
a man is honored during services in the synagogue to  come up to the
reading of the Law before the open Toyre scroll;  the Hebrew _Ali'yA,
may also be thought of as a religious act if one thinks in terms of
immigrating to the Holy Land as a  good and proper deed.

The  Zionist movement used the term in a politico-psychological sense:
An immigrant to Israel is called _olE_, one who ascends to a higher
level of Jewishness; while one who emigrates from Israel, an Israeli
expatriate, is called _yo'rEd_..

In Yiddish, a yOy'red means an impoverished Jew, one who lost his
fortune; but in modern Hebrew, yo'rEd carries the new notion of
spiritual impoverishment, one who descended to a lower level of
Jewishness.
