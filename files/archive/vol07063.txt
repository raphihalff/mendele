Subject: Poem for a Gravestone

I was moved by Barry Megdal's sensitive request for a poem for his mother's
stone. The first thing that came to mind was Byalek's "Nokh Mayn Toyt"  (the
gender might be changed); the final stanza reads: 

               "Iz der veytik groys, oy, zeyer groys!
               S'iz geven a mentsh - un nito im mer,
               Un zayn lebenslid iz opgehakt in mitn.
               In vey, er hot dokh nokh eyn lid gehat -
               Un farloyrn iz dos lid oyf eybik
               Farloyrn oyf eybik."

A poem more powerful comes to mind, an elegy written by Sutzkever on the
death of his mother in the Vilna Ghetto in 1942 . The book, a very slim
volume, is_Burnt Pearls:Ghetto Poems._  translated by Seymour Mayne, Mosaic
Press, Valley Editions, 1981, P.O. Box 1032, Oakville Ontario L6J 5E9

Who can help and present the Yiddish version of the following lines of the
last stanza?

              "If you remain
               I will still be alive
               as the pit of the plum
               contains in itself the tree,
               the nest and the bird
               and all else besides."

Subject: About the International

Far di yunge Mendelistn, a point of information.

All secularists of that day, both the Socialists and the Communists, sang the
same words to "The International." But - you could always tell the linke
(IWOniks) from the rekhte (Arbeter Ringniks). When reaching the last stanza,
"Dos vet zayn shoyn der letster..." the Socialists raised their right arm
straight up into the air while making a
fist; the Communists held their arm out and up only from the elbow, also
making a fist.. 

I could add my voice to Mikhl's, but we won't quit our day jobs.

Subject: De Internatsional

I am chagrined at myself for allowing an intervening phone call to cause me to
omit the second verse to the Kinder Internatsional/ (Don't tell anyone.)  The
children's version  goes like this in its entirety:

Mir zainen kinder aleh glaiche.
Mir zainen aleh ains far ains.
Nittoh kein oremeh kein reiche.
Mir boyen unzer velt alein.

Mir veln yedes kind derkonen
Vos gait mit unz un arbet gut.
Mit zainen gantze millionen.
Mit shtarkeh hent un haiseh blut.

Zolen leben di kinder
Zolen vaksen biz grois.
Tzum shafen. Tzum boyen.
Mit lieder gait farois. ( Repeat)

We sure made a shenereh un  besereh velt...didn't we.

Subject: Yiddish epitaph for a gravestone

Some comments on _Mendele_ vol 7.061, items 3 and 4:

The request [_Mendele_ vol. 7.060, item 10] was for a Yiddish poetic epitaph
for a woman; the Yehoyesh selection relates to a male.

The quoted lines are sentimental and bathetic.

Yehoyesh wrote at a time when daytshmerisms and "ornamental" diction were more
acceptable than they later became.  Yehoyesh's greatest achievment was his
translation of the bible.  Not all of his lyrics are memorable.

It is fairly lame to plaint that one wept at the loss of a loved one and 
ghoulish to add that one's eyes turned bloodshot.  A burial epitaph presumably
memorializes and is centered on the deceased.  Our four lines concentrate on
the physiological discomfiture of the narcissistic mourner and mention nothing
but the body odor of the dead -- was Yehoyesh a smell fetishist?

It is inelegant to move from the plural 'tears' in line 3 to grammatically
singular (though perhaps semantically collective) 'tear' in line 4.

If one wants a Yiddish epitaph, it should surely be good Yiddish in correct
orthography (unless one has a special reason for a "diplomatic" orthography).
The romanization of the recommended verse is correctible:

1.  not _tsusheydn_ but _tsesheydn_
2. _duft_ and _geduft_ are pure daytshmerizms; not _hut_ but _hot_
3. and 4.  not _farlufn_ but _farlofn_

It is surely no easy task to select a tombstone inscription for a total 
stranger.  Wouldn't one need to know a good deal about the deceased?  Or at
the very least be counseled as to the emotional tenor of the desired 
selection?  There is no language in the world richer than Yiddish in the 
poetry of filial loss and longing -- Khayim Grade and Avrom-Nokhen Shtentsl
are two masters of this genre.  Selections that are moving and right are
possible, but call for great care, much sensitivity.

How meaningful can a specifically Yiddish inscription be if the primary force
of its use is not total form and content, but its linguistic envelope alone?
We must either not choose or do so responsibly.

The Perets suggestion is, of course, better, but how apposite is it? Would one
really want to write on one's mother's grave: "Makh [not mach] tsu, mayn kind,
di eygelekh [not eygelech]/ A brokhe af dayn kepele"? Parents in Yiddish call
their children _tatele_ and _mamele_ but children do not -- normally --
reverse this practice.

Subject: Future of Yiddish

Abraham Brumberg's letter brings back memories of City College circa 1947-49
when I was a freshmen.  I hope he doesn't mind my adding a few details to his
modest description of his activities.

It was obvious that he loved what he was doing.  I remember his puppet shows
and as chairman of the Yiddish Club at the Hillel Foundation he brought an 
array of writers and artists, the like of which I was never to see again.
(Leyvik, Glants-Leyeles, Sh. Niger, Maurice Schwartz, Ruth Rubin, among 
others!).  Brumberg WAS the Yiddish Club at that time.  As far as I know, no
other New York college, public or private, had such an organization at that
time.

Subject: International

Sheet music of The International for mixed voices, published in 1917 by
Joseph Katz, arranged by Henry Lefkowitch reads as follows:

[antshukdikt dem daytshmerishn oysleg!]

Shteht oif ir ale, ale shklafen
Fun hunger umetum tzushpreit
Der kampf, er ruft uns tzu di vafen
In shlacht uns fihren is er greit

Un entshiedener shtrait

Subject: Robert and Molly Freedman Archive 

We want to congratulate our dear friends Robert and Molly Freedman upon 
today's celebration of transferring their monumental sound archive to the
University of Pennsylvania.  We are proud that we were among the first to
acknowledge their unique contribution to the collection of Yiddish recordings,
which by now includes over 25,000 song items.  They collected the records
throughout the world, devised their own computer program, and data base,
making the materials instantly accessible.  It is a tremendous achievement and
all scholars and students are forever in their debt.  They have always given
information unstintingly and every honor accorded to them is well deserved..
May they continue to inspire all of us involved in the preservation and
popularization of the Yiddish and Jewish song repertory.
Kol hakovod ! - Molly and Bob!  

With love 
Chana and Yosl Mlotek
