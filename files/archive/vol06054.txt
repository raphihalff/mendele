Subject: Song "Yidish redt zikh azoy sheyn"

We are looking for the song: "Yidish redt zikh azoy sheyn". Can anyone
steer us to the words and, hopefully, music also?  A sheynem dank in
foroys.

Subject: Translating Moishe Nadir

I am preparing a presentation for the AJS Conference in December which
will include discussion and translation of two or three early satires by
Moishe Nadir, to be culled from a list that currently includes
"Geratevet," "Halt op di pres!" "Git im finferlekh," "Stsenkes in a
tsaytungs-ofis," "Laptash," and "Ferfelshlinger" (all selections are
from Vols. 2 and 3 of _Humor and Satire_ (NY: 1912).  If anyone out
there knows of a compelling reason why these works are not available, or
with whom the translation rights can be negotiated (this is a non-profit
purpose), speak now, or--as the saying goes--forever hold your peace.

Subject: Yiddish and Basque: a suggested relationship

On Jewishgen, a list devoted to the study of genealogy of people with
Jewish ancestors, a question arose relating to a possible connection
between Yiddish and Basque.  Personally, I could not care less, but
someone posted a website, a serious website by the way, that makes
exactly that assertion.  In fact, it relates Basque to a number of
languages.

For those of you with access to the web, the address is:

	http://www.islandnet.com/~edonon/yiddish.html

Going backwards from this page with take you to the homepage as well and
on that there is information about the author of the page.

I am quite unable to judge the author's statements because I am confused
about several of his details.  This is not entirely ignorance but due,
perhaps, to his layout.  For example, he has several hundred Yiddish
words that he asserts were looked up in a Basque dictionary.  He gives
the words but it is hard to find out where he has the Basque-English
equivalent.

Nonetheless, the author is not a nutcase.

The web page is worth exploration.

Subject: Spinoza and Yiddish

Yet another instance of Spinoza in Yiddish literature [see Allan Nadler's
query in 6.049] is Khaym Sloves' play _Borekh fun amsterdam_, performed
(by the way) in New York in the early sixties.
