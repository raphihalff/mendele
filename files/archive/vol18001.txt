According to my aunt, who speaks a very fine Yiddish, "shtroynislekh" means
"straw nuts."  Exactly what straw nuts are, is anybody's guess!

Also, here are the words to "Ikh for aheym." She says she has the sheet
music to it:

Ikh for aheym
Ikh for aheym
Ikh voyn nit mer
Bay dem un dem

Opgeplagt zikh ale yorn
Un oyb oysgefirt mir mayn
A yid bin ikh geboyrn
Un mit yidn vil ikh zayn

Ikh for aheym
Ikh for aheym
Ikh for aheym
Ikh vil nit mer
zayn a ger
vi geven biz aher

Ikh for aheym

Ikh for aheym

I hope this helps.

Best wishes,

Larry Friedman

Ghivelder and Itsik Goldenberg, who adds that the song's words and music
were written by David Meyerowitz.]

Subject: Yiddish encounters with Roma

With reference to the request for a text on Roma and Jewish music, I am not
familiar with actual texts but discussions of Roma and klezmer musicians
are frequent: they lived in the same areas, played at each other's
weddings, or dances, and often supplied musicians to each other's bands
when a replacement was needed. In other words, they shared the same
culture. No doubt, some of the numerous books on klezmer music contain
references to this phenomenon.
