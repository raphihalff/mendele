Subject: Goylem

The word _golem_ (pronounced goylem or geylem) appears in Tehilim
(Psalms) 139,16. golmi rou eynekho, Your eyes saw my form. The word
appears a lot in the Gemoro meaning planks of wood.  Although the word is
used in yiddish for a moron or an idiot the yiddish translation of the
word is klotz.  While you won't hear goylem used for wood these days
klotz is used for wood and for humans.

The plural is not goylems but goylomim.

Subject: More on Nitl

It's hard to know, at this distance, just what Reuven Frankenstein means
when he says that my reference to the absurd suggestion that German
_Heirat_ is related to Hebrew _harey at_ "goes back to him [i.e. me] as a
boomerang". Assuming that it's not meant to be an unfriendly comment, let
me return to the matter of _nitl_. Perhaps I should add, at the outset,
that I have no ideological committment to one or another of the proposed
etymologies. My committment is to preserving a degree of rigour when
engaging in etymological speculations.

Reuven Frankenstein cites a number of authorities who should be held to
the same standard of rigour--Siegmund Wolf and Moses Iserles. Let's add
Max Weinreich who also suggests the possible connection between Yiddish
_nitl_ 'Christmas' and Latin _(dies) natalis_ (or Italian _Natale_). As
Wexler points out, Weinreich also notes a possible connection to the
Hebrew root _nun, tes, lamed_ 'to lift up' (note the Hebrew form _nital_
'to be taken, lifted up', 'to be removed'.)

As for the problem that Reuven Frankenstein sees in the spelling of
Yiddish _nitl_ with _tes_, as against Hebrew _nitla_ with _tof_, are we,
therefore, to assume that Yiddish _shekhtn_, spelled with _khof_ can't be
derived from the Hebrew root _ShKhT_ with _khes_, or that Yiddish _mekn_
can't be derived from Hebrew MKhH? In any event, note that Wexler cites
"early 14th century Judeo-French, [where] the _t_ in _nitl_ IS spelled
with _tav_ rather than the expected _tet_".

As for other features of the spelling, the _e_ in Siegmund Wolf's _nitel_
signifies little. Are we to credit Yiddish spellings like _leben_,
_hoben_, etc. with any significance? Furthermore, there are early
spellings that _do not_ have a vowel letter before the _l_ of _nitl_.

There has been _no_ suggestion that the form _nitl_ might be derived from
_hataluyi_, however much they may both be derived from the same Hebrew
root; Yiddish _tole_ yes, _nitl_ no. That's an instance of
_fardreyen/farbaytn di yoytsres_.

Nor have I attempted to derive Yiddish _nitl_ from the "Hebrew root TLH.
Hebrew _nitla_ is derived from that root.  Yiddish _nitl_ MAY, in turn,
be derived from Hebrew _nitla_.

Although this would be a subject for an entire different chapter, it may
also be worth mentioning that the specific grammatical form of the word,
_in Hebrew_, is often irrelevant to its function in Yiddish.

For me the central question remains how to account for the _i_ in Yiddish
_nitl_. Possibly in support of the Latin etymon: There IS an area in the
Northern Ukraine, where a group of words with _i_ derive from an early
low front vowel, perhaps a "Proto-Yiddish *[ae], the front morphophonemic
alternant of modern Yiddish back mid [o/u] in  _shtot/shtu(i)t_, plural
_shtet/shteyt/shtit_. They are generally cognate with German words like
_leben, Regen_, Pferd_, and a group of Hebrew segolates that include
_khesed_ and _makhateneste (but not __emes_ or _pesakh_). In MHG
dictionaries, the German cognates are usually spelled with the _e_ with
two dots over it.

In Western Yiddish, traces of this _i_ can still be picked up in a Hebrew
word like [bal-sign] 'the person who stands next to the reader in the
synagogue', primarily at a cluster of locations just to the Northwest and
Southwest of Nuernberg, and at one or two locations far to the West of
them. I've also run across an entry for the German-origin Yiddish word,
_mel_ 'flour' spelled _mem, yud, lamed_, in a 17th(??) century
dictionary.

If this phenomenon can really be invoked to account for the
correspondence _natalis_/_nitl_, we would still have to account for the
universalization of the _i_ variant in Yiddish. Perhaps, we can all have
our cake and eat it, too, by thinking of Hebrew _nitla_ as having become
implicated, as folk- etymological support for a Latin etymon, _after_ the
change of some kind of [a]([ae]??) to [i] in Yiddish. Is there any other
evidence for such a sound change affecting words of Latin origin?

Having come this far, I still fail to understand the "boomerang" analogy.

Subject: Looking for a poem

There is a poem I recall and cannot find written after the holocaust
where the poet tells that after seven years she has bought a new dress
but it is too short for her grief, cannot fit her sorrow.... Help,
anyone?

Subject: Indexing Mendele

My thanks to the shames for his comments in response to my inquiry about
the possibility of creating an index for Mendele.  At present I do not
have the personal expertise to carry out the accessing methods he has
described.  I think David Sherman's posting (5.074) does does an
excellent job of pointing out why an index would be the most useful tool
to accomplish what I had originally posed.
