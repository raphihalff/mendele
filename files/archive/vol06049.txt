Subject: Spinoza and Yiddish

I am currently completing a study on the image of Spinoza in 20th
century Yiddish culture.  WHile I have found numerous Yiddish mongraphs
and several essays and plays about Spinoza, I have found very few
references in Yiddish poetry and literature. Any help in locating such
sources would be much appreciated.

Subject: Chasha

hi, folks. i'm forwarding this -- if you have an answer, could you please at
least cc it to the original sender, dportman@netvision.net.il? meanwhile,
perhaps s/he would like to join mendele. :)

      I am looking for the Hebrew equivalent (or English literal translation)
      of the Yiddish name, "Chasha" I think that it is spelled chet, shin,
      heh.

      Any help would be most appreciated.

Subject: Yiddish in Sunday Times puzzles

This week the Sunday Times had Yiddish definitions in both its crossword
and acrostic puzzles.  The crossword had "tsuris" - for "Trouble, in
Yiddish slang"; and the acrostic had "nosh" for "Snack on".  We are
definitely making an impact in the goyisher velt!

Subject: Professional translators needed

Last year I took over as Editor in Chief of the Library of Yiddish
Classics, published by Schocken Books (through Random House).  This is a
well-kept secret.  Volume 4 of the Library, devoted to Mendele, has just
appeared, and you will be hearing more about it at a later date.  Now I
am turning to you for help.

Our pool of professional translators is exceedingly small.  We are
therefore asking qualified translators of Yiddish to submit their CV.
If you are a published translator, please send me your vital statistics:
Name, Mailing Address, e-mail address, a list of your publications, your
particular areas of interest, and, if at all possible, a sample of your
best work.  You may forward the CV to me via e-mail: daroskies@jtsa.edu.

My mailing address is The Jewish Theological Seminary, 3080 Broadway,
New York, NY 10027-4649.  A sheynem dank.

David G. Roskies
