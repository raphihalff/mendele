Subject: How to pronounce khurbm

To Yitzhak Kertesz:

Your Hungarian lips need not keep yopu from pronouncing
khurbm, hobm,etc. In addition to reading what I wrote in my
phonetic explanation, try this: Say the Yiddish syllable
hob. Now do it again, but right after pronouncing the final
/b/, keep your lips closed and do a brief,quick hum.When
you first do it, it may sound like hob+pause+mmm.Now do it
quickly so that there is no pause between the /b/ and the
hum.YOU MUST KEEP YOUR LIPS CLOSED THROUGH THE /bm/CLUS
TER.

Subject: Neger, shikse/sheygets

Although it is sometimes difficult to convince people that
it is not derogatory, the Yiddish *neger* appears--or at
least used to appear--as a purely descriptive term.  E.g.,
in Itsik Manger's version of *Di goldene pave*, and in
Yos[e]l Cutler's poem *Nekst*, about lynching, published in
his book *Muntergang* (1934).  Cutler was a communist who
in NYC in the thirties would certainly have avoided a
racist term.  (He was, by the way, also the artist who did
that terrific poster, reproduced some years ago by YIVO,
for the *Idisher Kunst Teater* production of Goldfaden's
*Tsvey Kuni-Lemels*.) Weinreich gives the word, without a
usage warning.

ellen prince's argument with respect to *sheygets* and
*shikse*, that it's not the word that offends (or delight)
but what is predicated about those to whom the words are
applied, is surely correct.  But, just as surely, there are
circumstances in which it would be downright rude to apply
such words to those who are likely to be offended by them.
In particular, it would be graceless to refer to a
non-Jewish woman in her hearing as a *shikse*, if for years
she has heard the term used only derogatorily, never mind
the intended neutrality this time.  And in the special case
of the woman who has undertaken the intellectual and
emotional work of converting to Judaism, the term seems
especially likely to distress, and of dubious validity into
the bargain.

Ellen Prince, despite looking a shikse, and perhaps even
being right (for what it is worth, I tend to agree with her
feeling) when she says that the words shikse, sheygets and
goy are not intrinsically evil, I think her sociological
explanation, when she writes as follows, is wrong:

>....... (a friend of mine teaches kindergarten in a black
>inner city school. the tiny little girls refuse to play in
>the yard in the spring--for fear of getting darker from the
>sun. taking the dominant group's esthetic metric is not
>unique to jews...)

**********************************

Having lived among the Japanese, I found that matters are
much more complex.  They are certainly dominent and totally
intolerant of foreigners; they will not allow their
children to marry Koreans who are descendents of families
that immigrated in the 17th century or even Japanese
descended from tanners or butchers of that century.  Or
allow them good jobs.

They hate Americans but name their "best" imitation Scotch
whiskey, "America."  Their fine women walk with umbrellas
to keep their skins light.  They admire a tribe of supposed
aborigines living on the northern island of Hokkaido, the
Inu, who are supposed to have blue eyes and more developed
beards (they saw the differences but I could not).  They
will undergo plastic surgery to make their eyes "round."

What is the dominent esthetic metric here?

And Jews are still hedging their bets, siding with today's
powerful in diaspora, and being forced to come to grips
with tomorrow's powerful.  The Jews of Quebec who identified
with Anglos suddenly found themselves almost disenfranchised
by an emergent Francophone population.  Amusingly North
African French speaking Jews do much better there now.

And the Jews of Pressburg who spoke Hungarian as their non-
Yiddish tongue while the natives all spoke Slovak and the
Jews of Satmar who spoke Hungarian while the locals spoke
Roumanian?  "When will they ever learn?", says the song.

...and an aside on the topic of shikse/schwartze.  My wife's
aunt understood shikse to mean servent girl in her native
Germany; when she had to contend with a black cleaning lady
in the States she felt the necessity of noting the change.
She referred to her, without additional prejudice, as the
shwartze shikse.

****************************************

For those who may have forgotten, OTHER is not always
pejorative.  Has this not been the debate that Jews
have engaged in with their neighbors these thousands
of years?

If my memory serves me, the Jews defended their otherness
as a very positive quality.  Not a pejorative.

On the other side of this matter, there is affection and
love: i.e., meine shikseleh, a susse sheygetseh, etc.
