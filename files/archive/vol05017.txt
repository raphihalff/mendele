Subject: Introduction

I, like more than a few other subscribers, apparently, am a mathematics
professor.  I teach at Mount Vernon College in Washington DC.

I grew up in Brooklyn, in the Bay Ridge area, where there are few Jews.
My parents understood Yiddish but didn't teach it to me.  I'm fairly
ignorant of Yiddish.  What I know are mostly songs: I have long had
_Great Songs of the Yiddish Theater_, which I enjoy very much, and I
recently got the two song volumes from the Arbeter Ring.

Last fall, I took a Yiddish class at the JCC of Northern Virginia with
Lee Goldberg, who told me about Mendele and showed me some printouts.  I
also found Mendele in the Internet Yellow Pages.  When I got on line, I
subscribed.

I particularly like when you publish parallel Yiddish and English texts
so I can study them word by word.

By the way, I don't think any of my ancestors belonged to an
"Aysinerfareyn" (see Mendele 5.003.1), but perhaps they should have.

Subject: Mayn Geneydn

This poem was composed and translated by my mother, Clara Y. Rosenberg,
during May 1995

Mayn Geneydn

Ikh ken nisht shpatsirn,
Di mosquitoes baysn mikh,
Ikh ken gornisht rien,
Di Kindr zuraysn mikh.

Ikh fergin zikh nisht esn,
Ikh ver braytr vi lengr,
Ikh loz ales loyfn,
Ikh miz vern shtrengr.

Ikh ken wenig shlufn,
Ikh khap nor a driml,
Ikh ver nisht sunburnt.
Nor Volkn bleibt in Himl.

Far wus bin ich gekimn?
Die Kindr viln shvimin?
Or just to talk to women?

Ikh bin shoyn du a pur Vokhn,
A geneydn - Ikh darf nisht kokhen!

- - - - - - - - - -
(A loose translation of the above poem)

I can't go a-walking,
The mosquitoes bite me,
I can't even rest,
The children incite me.

I can't afford to eat,
Gained more width than length,
Everything is neglected,
'til I gain my strength.

I sleep very little,
Snatch a wink bye and bye.
I'm not getting sunburnt,
Clouds occupy the sky!

Was driven here by a simmin  (clue)
The children liked swimmin,
Or my yen to talk to women?

I'm here two weeks says my daily book,
It's Paradise - I don't have to cook!

Subject: Khapt un Nemt

The song referred to by Marsha Berman in Mendele 5.014 is "Khapt un
Nemt."  I have a recording on the album _Theodore Bikel on Tour_.  Bikel
provides the text and an English translation:

Khapt un nemt un zekst im ayn
Tomer vet er moyde zayn,
Oy gevalt, a ganef
Hot er mir baganvet
Ales hot er tsigenemen
Bay mir in der shtib.

Ziben hemder vi di becher
Dray mit lates, fir mit lecher
Oy gevalt ...

Un dos tishtukh finm tish
Un dem koyletsh fin di fish
Oy gevalt ...


Stop thief!  Arrest him!  Put him in jail!
Maybe he'll confess.
A thief, alas,
Has robbed my house.
He took away everything,
Everything in the house.

Seven shirts, like goblets they were
Three with spots, four with holes.

The tablecloth from the table
And the white bread from beside the fish.

Subject: Multi Lingual Scholar program

Is there anyone out there on Mendele who works with the MLS (Multi
Lingual Scholar) program for Yiddish or Hebrew? I have been working with
this program for quite a while but still have many problems with it. I
was told that MLS is not convertible, which means I shall have to keep
working with it. But I am unable to activate many of the functions which
are theoretically available (according to the User Manual). Are there
others with this problem?

Subject: Shviti

[re: Joseph Sherman's inquiry (5.016)]

The source of "shviti" is Psalms 16:8. The verse is inscribed on paper or
other medium and is placed before the shtende of the person leading
services. It is a reminder of the obligation to focus the prayer on God.

Subject: Khas ve-sholem and similar wishful thinking

Leybl Goldberg fregt a por etymologishe kashes.  Ikh ken onhoybn mit a
halbe tshuve oyf zayn ershte frage, ober zikher az s'do emese
lingvistishe mevinim tsvishn uns vos kenen im beser entfern.

>> Fun vanet shtamen di oysdrikn, "kholile," "khas ve-sholem"
>> un azoy vayter un "halevay"?  Un vos meynen zey take?

All three words come from the Semitic element in Yidish.  Kholile and
khas ve-sholem are Hebrew.  I believe that halevay derives from Aramaic,
based on its alternate spelling, alevay (although I'm willing to stand
corrected).  All three are in common use in modern Hebrew, the first two
more often among religiously observant Israelis.

Both kholile and khas ve-sholem mean roughly "God forfend," or "it
shouldn't happen to you/me/us."  They are used as deflective terms when
speaking of something undesirable (be it cancer, war, or bankruptcy), to
ensure that even mentioning such topics does not bring down similar evil
upon the speaker.  Halevay has the opposite meaning, namely "if only," or
"it should only happen to me/you/us."

In terms of their origins, Jastrow's Dictionary of the Talmud cites both
halevay (alevay) and khas ve-sholem as being used back in the rabbinic
period: the former is cited in Targum Yonaton (circa 4th century CE), and
the latter in both Mishneh (Eduyot) and Gemara (Baba Metzia).  I couldn't
find a pertinent reference to kholile there with the meaning used in
Yiddish, but that may more reflect my lack of understanding of the format
of Jastrow's book.

Presumably, these expressions were part of the Talmudic or possibly even
medieval Hebrew vocabulary that entered into Yidish at its earliest
stages.  I'll leave those conjectures to those more qualified than I am.

For a wonderful study of similar Yidish wishful thinking, blessings and
curses, I'll repeat a reference that I cited here over a year ago. The
title is: "Blessings, curses, hopes and fears: Psycho-ostensive
expressions in Yiddish," by James A. Matisoff, published in Philadelphia
sometime after 1978 by the Institute for Study of Human Issues.
