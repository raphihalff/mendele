Subject: Leg Dayn Kop

In response to Gie Laenen who is looking for the words to the lullaby:  Put
your head on my knee.  Leg dayn kop af mayne Kni, here they are. 

Leg dayn kop af mayne kni

Subject: Leyg dayn kop

The lullaby Gie Laenen is looking for, was written by H. Lejwik (Lewi
Halpern) (1888-1962) 

SHLOFLID                                         SCHLAFLIED
Leyg dayn kop oyf mayne kni,             Leg den Kopf auf meine Knie,
gut azoy tsu lign;                       so ist es gut liegen.
kinder shlofn ayn aleyn,                 Kleine Kinder schlafen schon,
groyse darf men vign.                    grosse muss man wiegen.

Kinder hobn shpilekhlekh, -              Kinder haben Spielzeug viel,
shpiln ven zey viln:                     spielen wann sie wollen.
groyse shpiln nor mit zikh,              Grosse sind sich selbst zum Spiel,
muzn eybik shpiln.                       muessen ewig wollen.

Hot nit moyre - ikh bin do               Musst nicht fuerchten, ich bin da,
kh 'vel dir nit farshtoysen;             werd dich nicht verstossen.
host genug geveynt shoyn haynt,          Hast heut schon genug geweint,
vi es past a groysn.                     ganz wie alle Grossen.

Ongeveynt un ongeklogt -                 Hast geweint und hast geklagt,
kh 'vel dir itst farvign;                nun will ich dich wiegen.
leyg dayn kop oyf mayne kni,             Leg den Kopf auf meine Knie -
gut azoy tsu lign.                       so ist es gut liegen.

                                         11.VII.1941

The German translation is by Selma Meerbaum-Eisinger, the young poet from
Czernowitz, Bukowina, cousin of Paul Celan, born in Czernowitz on the
15.8.1924 and died 1just 18 years old on the 6..12.1942 in the Concentration
Camp Michailowka, Transnistria. Tomorrow in our "Oneg Shabbat" literary
series in Freiburg Ursula Fritsch, a young composer and singer, is going to
sing accompanying herself with guitar her own tuned songs by Selma
Meerbaum-Eisinger, including this translation of the lullaby by H. Lejwik.

Subject: Lullaby

The lullaby that Gie Laenen asked about (8.151) is H. Leivick's "Shloflid". 
The text can be found in the Mendele archives (issue 4.385) and in the most
recent songbook by the Mloteks, _Lider fun dor tsu dor_, together with the
music.

Subject: Nitl (yet again)

Another contribution to the discussion of _nitl_, this time from Rev.
Abraham Hirshovitz of Pittsburgh, whose commentary on Jewish customs,
_Seyfer (oytser) minhogey yeshurun (yidishe minhogim)_, was published 
in a third edition in Vilna in 1914.  (It also had four Hebrew editions,
published successively in Vilna, Warsaw, St. Louis and 
Lemberg/Lvov/Lwow/Lviv.)  The quotation below is also a good illustration 
of the _daytshmerish_ style of the time. 

        Simen 271:  Vorum mir lernen nit in di nakht fun "tkufes-
        teyves" velkhe mir rufn di nakht "nitl"?

                Vayl in di alte tsaytn hobn di antisemitn un di 
        yidn-freser in dize nakht geloyert oyf di yidn, un vemen zey
        hobn gekhapt hobn zey geshlogn makes-retsekh, un file mol 
        hobn merere yidn oysgehoykht zeyere neshomes fun di klep 
        velkhe men hot zey geshlogn, un azoy vi dize nakht iz geven a 
        nakht fun lebens-gefar un kayn regirung hot nit gekent dem 
        hamoyn ophaltn, vayl der hamoyn hot gedeynkt dos shlogn yidn 
        iz a mitsve in dize nakht, hobn darum undzere rabonim fun di
        alte doyres mesakn geven dos men zol tsumakhn di khadorim vu
        kinder lernen vi oykh di yeshives un yeder zol zitsn bay zikh 
        tsuhoyz (lekutey pardeys), oykh nit tsu gebn dem meysis-
        umediekh kayn shum zkhus fun undzer lernen toyre.

        Why we don't study [Torah] on the winter night that we call 
        "nitl" [Christmas]?

                Because in the olden days the anti-Semites and 
        Judeophobes lay in wait for Jews, and whomever they caught 
        they beat with murderous blows, and often many Jews breathed 
        their last from the blows that they were struck, and since 
        this night was a night of mortal danger and no government 
        could hold back the mob, since the mob thought that beating 
        Jews on this night was a virtue, so therefore our rabbis of 
        old made a rule that the heders where children study and the 
        yeshivas should be closed and everyone should sit at home 
        (_Lekutey pardeys_ [a rabbinical work?]), also so that no 
        merit should accrue to the instigator/the misleader [a 
        reference to Jesus?] through our Torah study.

Subject: Rhyming pairs

My husband's family (two strands -- one Litvak and one Polish) uses the
phrase "a ruzhe-buzhe" to mean "a big to-do," a big fuss.

Subject: Yiddish doggerel

When my mother said "bleh-shmeh" it was her critique of something I was
going to do which she thought was hasty and totally devoid of merit; that it
was a waste of my time/money/energy. My rabid Socialist father was not above
adding his scatological two-cents worth: bleh-shmeh un kock awfn yam. What
could be more counter-productive than that? I'd be happy to swap (privately)
the bottomless fount of my Poppa's LIthuanian bawd.

"Hutch-plutch" , meaning "before you knew it", "quick as a wink" or "before
you could say "Jack Robinson"  has be used by both my Russian (Ukraine) and
Polish (Pabianicz) sides of the family

For my mother (Malke) on her forthcoming 95th birthday, I want to teach my 3
non-yiddish speaking grandchildren the words to "Tayere Malke (Gezunt zolst
du zein) as a surprise gift.  I now know only 3 verses, but I'm certain
there are lots more.  Could readers please share their knowledge with me ?

Subject: Sissel revisited

I have reviewed the Mendele discussion of sissel bread between 1991 and
1993. I would be interested in any further clarification Mendele readers
would care to add. 

Sissel bread is noted in various sources for the turn of the century period
in the United States as a "Galician" speciality.  It was baked in the New
York City area and elsewhere in the country, not only (or even mainly) in
New England. During the period 1880-1904, most of the Jewish bakers were
from Roumania, while those from Russia, though fewer, were considered the
most skilled.

A Jewish baker in California, born in 1921, remembers sissel bread being
made by all the Jewish bakers in Los Angeles. It was made as follows. 
First, the ratio of rye flour to white was higher than in ordinary Jewish
rye bread--more like 50% than 30% rye. This made the dough heavier.  Second,
the dough, after being formed into a round loaf (about 1.5 pounds), was
proofed and then placed in a wooden box with 1/4 " of water in the bottom. 
The dough soaked up the water. The baker and his helpers would pick up the
dough--it was wet and mushy on the bottom--to smooth the bottom with their
hands. They then dropped the loaf in a bed of cornmeal. Third, from there
the dough would be placed on a peel and into the brick oven--an American
Standard Oven.  They heated this oven with a gas flame thrower. When the
temperature was right, they removed the flame thrower and baked the bread
using radiant heat and, I assume (I can check) that they baked the loaves
directly on the bricks (no pans or trays). Fourth, regarding the seeds, my
baker said they were caraway, but a colleague who is a food historian and
specialist in edible plants suggests that the seeds (small, black, pyramid
shaped) may be Gith (Nigella sativa), which is used in white Armenian
cheese, or onion seeds--they are indistinguishable to the eye.  More than
one kind of seed may have been used by various bakers. The crusty bottom of
this loaf was specially prized. 

The baker explained further that they made and sold rye bread (If you wanted
rye without caraway, you needed to ask for plain rye. If you asked for rye,
you got caraway seeds.), light rye (less rye flour, more white flour),
pumpernickel (with raisins), sissel, and khale. 

This account differs in some details from the one provided by Robert D. 
Hoberman on June 23, 1993, but is basically consistent with it. As for the
seeds (see Mendele Vol. 1.98 and subsequent issues), there are several
possibilities. I recall the flavor of the little black seeds on certain
kinds of Jewish rye bread as something akin to caraway, fennel, cumin. 
Different bakers may well have used different seeds.  What are tsherneshkes? 
Can someone describe them--appearance, flavor, use? 

If anyone can illuminate this topic further, I would be grateful.
