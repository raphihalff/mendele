Since French - Yiddish has been mentioned and we

Any other Mendel-niks going to the National Yiddish
Book Center's summer Yiddish camp, July 4-11?  (We just
succeeded in making day-care arrangements on-site for
our little two, so we'll be there.)

i don't know the story with initial vav, but one
doesn't have to merely *say* that initial aleph/ayin
were consonants, one can observe that they ARE--in
arabic and in the hebrew of oriental jews (i.e. jews
whose ancestors have never left semitic-speaking
lands)--i believe they are glottal and pharyngeal
fricatives, respectively. (right, phonologists?) (i
think kurdish jews have also retained these
distinctions in their hebrew--at least i have heard
they've retained the whole series of pharyngeals, not
just ayin.)

interestingly, it's not only the original yiddish
speakers that couldn't hear these consonants--when
greek adapted/ adopted the semitic syllabary, they also
couldn't hear the consonantal constriction and took
aleph as the vowel /a/, called 'alpha' (which became
the letter _a_ in the latin alphabet), and ayin as the
vowel /o/, called 'omicron' (which became the letter
_o_ in the latin alphabet). they likewise couldn't hear
the /h/ sound in he and took it as the vowel /e/,
called 'epsilon' (which became the letter _e_ in the
latin alphabet).

re: Jewstudies (196#4)

Good luck to you, but let me ask, do we really need a
new list for Jewish Studies since the Association for
Jewish Studies has a very active list already
(Judaica@uminn1)?

re: convention (201#5)

This sounds very interesting, please tell me more about
it! Is one allowed to sell Hungarian books at this
convention?

re: Narr/naronim

Didn't the expression "hazonim - naronim" help the
spread of this irregular plural? Or even originate it?
and what about the meaning of the word? namely, isn't a
word with the meaning "narr" allowed to show a little
"narrishkeyt"?

-------
to: Arnie Kuzmack
re: Yid/id (203#3)

You conclude by claiming that yid is written with a
shtumer aleph because it was pronounced by many as
"id". But couldn't the writing precede and influence
the pronunciation? Namely, written with an aleph for
some mysterious reason, and that would cause people to
start pronouncing it as "id"?

-------
to: Noyekh shames,
re: Happy B'day, mendele

did your call for foolishness (narrishkeyt) imply that
only once a year are we allowed to submit such
material?

[Entfert der shames: Purim meg men oykh.]

In any case here is one from Dov Sadan's collection
(quoted from memory - not verbatim) related to the
recent discussion about "dutzen - ihrtzen":

How do we know that King Salomon's bride spoke to him
in the more formal way?

Because it is written (Cant 4,9) "libbavtini akhoti
kallah" - "Du host mir geertset"
