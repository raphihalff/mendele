Subject: shmuzn

Can you stand one more contribution concerning the Yiddish word "shmuzn"? The
word has entered German, too, but in the meanings of: 1) to soft- soap or
butter up; and 2) to smooch, spoon, pet. In German, a "schmuser" can be either
a flatterer or a flirt or smoocher.

Subject: talking turkey; back to India!

Kathleen Rose tsitirt [07.103] Norman Berdichevsky ("the mother of languages"
_ariel_ 104 1997), loyt vemen de torres, a converso, hot di akhrayes farn vort
'turkey' meynendik indik, vos er hot bazirt dem nomen afn hebreishn _tuki_. 
Oyb azoy iz turkey sof-kl-sof fun indiye, vayl Bishop Caldwell, in zayn
'Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages' halt az _tuki_ shtamt fun
alt-tamil 'tOkai' 'sheyn foygl; pave.' Keday tsu dermonen az _tuki_ gefint
zikh in tanakh in seyfer melokhim un in seyfer divrei hoyomim, baym
dershraybung fun di skhoyres vos shloyme ha meylekh's shiffn hobn
tsurikgebrakht fun indiye.

Kathleen Rose cites Norman Berdichevsky as being of the opinion that De
Torres, a converso was responsible for the use of the word _turkey_ to refer
to the bird, and that it was a corruption of Hebrew _tuki_.  If so, then it
ultimately comes from India!  Bishop Caldwell in his 'Comparative Grammar of
the Dravidian languages' says that hebrew _tuki_ comes from Old Tamil _tOkai_
meaning beautiful bird or peacock.  It is worthwhile to note that the hebrew
word occurs in tanakh in Chronicles and Kings in connection with a description
of items brought back by King Solomon's ships from India!

Subject: baleytn & banugenen

I am grateful to Hershl Glezer for providing us with further examples
[07.103:5] of the differential development of 'ge-' from MHG on the one hand
to NHG and on the other hand to Y. In my view, what he says serves to amplify
rather than to refute my earlier remarks on this topic [07.099:3].  Let us try
and systematise. We seem to have 4 or 5 categories: 
1. Y has retained 'ge-' where NHG has not: 'gefinen', 'gedoyern'
2. NHG has retained 'ge-' where Y has not: (are there any such cases? I know
of none.)
3. Y shows greater Bavaro-Austrian influence than does NHG: 'glustn',
'gring', 'grod', 'g(e)vald'
4. Y has conflated two MHG prefixes (where NHG has not): 'dergreykhn'
5. NHG has conflated two MHG prefixes (where Y has not): 'begleiten',
'begnuegen' (This last example is particularly interesting, since it
represents an exact parallel of the case previously under discussion: 
'begnuegen' < 'benueegen' X 'genueegen'; 'banugenen' < a Middle Bavarian
cognate of 'benueegen' lacking Ablaut. There is even a NHG influenced 
parallel to 'bagleytn': 'bagnugenen'.) 
But, in any case, there is no evidence for any general Y (preconsonantal?)
'g'-dropping rule (a fortiori in borrowings from NHG) pace [07.098:2].

Subject: Forverts book review

In the October, 17 issue of the Forverts, Yosef Fridlender reviewed an article
by Dovid Asaf that appeared in a journal called 'Alafim' no. 14 1997. Some
time ago he reviewed another book published by 'Mechon Yisrael'. 

Can someone please provide me with more information on the above journal and
publishing house. 

Many thanks,

David Herskovic

I do not have access to the original yiddish of Singers stories. Could you

Subject: Joe and Paul

Oh boy!  I do remember it!.. but I think that the penultimate line went "a
suit, a coat, a gabardine".  This is the tiniest change!  I also remember
"coat" being pronounced something like "koyt".  The beat was quite infectious.
A driving syncopation with klzmer like sound.

Subject: Joe and Paul and KlezKamp

In response to fraynt Dembart's frage about Joe and Paul's: Yes, there was a
store by that name (billed as "The Aristocrats of the Clothing Industry") 
which sponsored Yiddish radio broadcasts in the NYC area from the middle 1930s
until it closed sometimes in the late 1940s. Their catchy jingle was written
by Sholom Secunda.

The song quoted in Lee Dembart's posting was a popular parody by the Barton
Brothers in the early 1950s made for the Apollo label aptly named "Joe and
Paul".

Secunda's jingle went as follows:

Joe un Paul a store a fargenign
Joe un Paul dort kent ir bilig krign
A suit a coat a gitn zolen perfect
Nor fregn darft ir, koyfn nor bay Joe un Paul 

Speaking of commercials, many Mendelyaner have e'd me asking if there is still
space at this year's KlezKamp: the answer is yes, but not for long. Please
don't delay, if you are interested in attending don't postpone returning your
application and if you'd like one please drop us an e at: livetrads@aol.com.

Subject: Some general reflections

Some of the recent discussions on Mendele seem to me to suggest that some
(many? most?) of the participants seem to forget that (a) 'Yiddish' is not
just the language of the Jews of Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine in the
19th-20th century, but was also the language of the Jews of Alsace,
Switzerland, Holland, Germany, Northern Italy (some of these into our times,
some earlier) and that it goes back uncontroversially to the Middle Yiddish
texts of the 15th century (whether 'Old Yiddish' going back a couple of
centuries earlier is also Yiddish is controversial), and (b) Max Weinreich's
big book is not the only nor by any means THE authoritative work on the
history of Yiddish (the works of Birnbaum, Fischer (Bin-Nun), Mieses, Beranek,
Sapir, and others are at least as important and on some points obviously
superior; moreover, there has been a lot of work since Weinreich's death, by
people such as Katz, King, and Wexler, which one cannot ignore even if one
disagrees with them on many things, as I do). 

Let me give some examples of why these two points are important to remember. 
First example: many of the questions and points made here make sense only with
regard to modern Eastern Yiddish, but not with regard to Yiddish generally. 
One may wonder about Slavic influence on the syntax of modern Eastern Yiddish
but not on that of Yiddish, because Yiddish as a whole has very very little in
the way of Slavic of any kind: the words nebekh, koyletsh, khotshe, khapn, and
at most one or two more are the limit of the Slavic influence on Yiddish as a
whole (and indeed until my recent paper, I believe that the antiquity of even
these few Slavicisms in Yiddish was not accepted).  Thus, as far as syntax
goes the only thing we can say is the trivial observation that nebekh seems to
have the same syntax in Yd as in Slavic (by the way, for those who still do
not accept that nebekh is Slavic, the fact that this word occurs in sentences
in the places where it does seems to me to prove the Slavic origin, even if we
had no other arguments).  Second example: in deciding where a word like
dav(e)nen (or any other) could come from, one needs to have some sense of what
we do know about the evolution of different Yd dialects (and of course one
needs to know which dialects the word occurs in).  It is difficult, for
example, to agree that a Turkic origin makes sense given that this word occurs
in large parts of German Yiddish.  Also, my own view (this might be
controversial) would be that dav(e)nen must have replaced orn (a word of
Romance origin) in the more easterly dialects of Yiddish (orn survives
throughout the more westerly dialects), and that the dynamics of the history
of Yd suggest that the more easterly dialects often replaced words of Romance
or German origin with either Slavic or Hebrew-origin ones.  Since Slavic has
nothing for us to derive dav(e)nen from, Hebrew seems the obvious working
hypothesis (although with adequate evidence one COULD show that this is not
so).  Third example: the idea that Yiddish originated among French Jews who
migrated into the Rhineland was to be sure common to Birnbaum, Fischer, and
Weinreich (although the latter also mentioned the Bavarian city of Regensburg
as a non-Rhineland place where the 'Earliest Yiddish' was spoken, and I dont
think ever said where those Jews came from).  But as far back as the 1920's,
Mieses offered very good arguments (which later writers mostly ignore) that
almost all of the Romance vocabulary in Yiddish comes not from France but from
Italy.  It is too early to be sure, and no one has done any serious work on
this, but my own research tends to bear out almost everything Mieses said.  In
addition, the nasal realization of the Hebrew ayin which (I think) we must
assume for the earliest forms of Yiddish in words like mayse, gayve, mayrev,
etc. are consistent with the nasal pronunciation of ayin in Italian Jewish
Hebrew pronunciation, and so on.  (This too is a topic where more work is
needed, and is now being done).  The bowdlerized version of Weinreich's theory
that Yiddish originated in FLoter' (meaning the Rhineland, not Lorraine, by
the way) was not even the whole of his actual theory (though it may have been
Fischer's and Birnbaum's), and it certainly is not sufficiently supported to
be held up as established fact.  Nor is it even today the received theory,
since in particular Katz, King, and Wexler all reject it (for their own
reasons). 

In short, I think that the history of Yiddish is a fascinating area of study
where much more remains to be done than has already been done, and the true
joy of Yiddish to my mind is in the doing.  Such problems as the etymology of
dav(e)nen are in this picture very small beer indeed, but it is precisely
against the background of this bigger picture that we must seek to solve such
problems.  But much bigger questions to which we do not yet know the answers
are how old Yiddish is, where in Germany it originated, what kinds of German,
Hebrew, and Romance entered into it, where exactly it gets its small Slavic
component (we do know it cannot be Polish, contrary to "common sense"), and so
on.  And all of these problems are being actively worked on, with every hope
of the answers being found in the next 10 years so. 

If we restrict our notion of Yiddish to the language of Mendele (i.e., recent
and modern Eastern Yiddish) and/or if we assume that the history of Yiddish is
a done deal and to be found all conveniently laid out in the one more or less
popularly accessible book (and the only one available in English or Yiddish),
we will miss the whole point of Yiddish historical linguistics. 

Alexis Manaster Ramer

PS. Lest I be misunderstood, none of this means for example that my preferred
etymology for dav(e)nen is right.  It is the overall approach to ANY problem
of Yiddish historical linguistics that I am concerned with here.
