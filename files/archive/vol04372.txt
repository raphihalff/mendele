Subject: Mameloshn 95 kids rates

When I made my original post about Mameloshn 95, I was unable to quote
children's rates. We had to finish settling that part of the Weekend with
Circle Lodge. They are as follows:

First two children: $20.00
Each additional child: $35.00
Proceeds will be used to cover the cost of the children's program.

If it isn't clear from the above, let me spell it out: We wants kids! Zey
zaynen undzer zukunft un mir darfn zey shtitsn! Ikh hof az ale vos viln
un kenen kumen veln kumen un oyb ir hot kinder, breng zey. Mir veln zein
zeyer zufridn zu hobn 50.

The other thing we want to emphasize is how much we want college
students. We have deliberately made our college rate, $85.00 for three
days, as low as we could. If you are afiliated with a college Yiddish
course and would like us to send you flyers to hand out, please feel free
to contact me.

Subject: Singer in Gaelic; Yiddish fonts

I wonder if anyone can help me with a few unrelated questions.

1. I have a (Scottish) Gaelic translation of an I.B. Singer story, the
title of which translates into English as "Jealousy".  No information is
given as to the original title or from what collection it comes.  I would
like to get a copy (in Yiddish) of whatever collection it is.  The title
could also mean "Zeal".  I've only just started to read the story, but so
far there is a Zalman and a Rabbi Meir in the village of Radoszyce.  Ring
any bells?

2. I read with interest the information on Yiddish fonts for the
Macintosh. Can these be used on an IBM-compatible?

3. I also read with interest the discussion of Yiddish names.  I had been
wondering what my name, Jonathan, was in Yiddish.  How is Yoynosn spelled
in alef-beys?

A sheynem dank for any help.

Here the "reysh" is really a dalet and thus it is "NOLAD", i.e.  BORN.
The vav with the accent stands for 6 (or in this case the sixths).

>accent aigu, then hey-shin-vav-vav-langer nun (I'd guess this is
>Heshvan/Khezhvn, so probably the hey is a khes).

I agree that it is Heshvan, the second month of our calendar.

This is the year (with the five thousand missing) 400+200+20+7=5627.

>samekh-lamed-vav-tsadek-kuf.

This sounds like  Slutsk.  There is such  a town of which  I had heard
before, some 40 miles south of Minsk in Byelorus.

So what  we got  is that  this Mr  Li(e)berman was  born in  Slutsk on
Heshvan  6,  5627 which  equals  1866  October  15 (by  the  Gregorian
Calendar).

Subject: The Russian medal

I don't mean to disappoint the latter-day Liberman too deeply, but if the
transcription of the medal's Hebraic obverse is correct (the reysh
mentioned in the first word should be a dalet), it says merely, "Born on
the sixth of Kheshven, 1867, in Slutzk."

Subject: The Russian medal

That's nun-vav-lamed-daled. "Nolad", meaning "born" in Hebrew. The vav
with the stroke is the standard way of showing it's a number: the 6th of
Kheshvan.

Tof-reysh-khof-zayin = 400 + 200 + 20 + 7.  +5,000 is implied,
so this is the year 5627.  That's the year 1866 (since Kheshvan
is in November).

The last line is likely "Slutsk", the town where he was born. I know
people in Toronto named Slutski and Slutzky, who presumably have their
origins in Slutsk.  Mikhl Herzog can probably tell us where Slutsk is.

Subject: The Russian medal

Larry Rosenwald asks about a bilingual medal belonging to a mutual
colleague of ours. I've seen the medal and believe I can explain the
Yiddish/ Hebrew side, but have a question about the Russian side.

nun-vav-lamed-reysh is probably nun-vav-lamed-daled, nolad (born)
vav'-kes-shin-vav-vav-langer nun is 5th of Heshvan
sof-reysh-khof-zayin (with accents?) is the year tarcaz, 5627 = 1867??
and samekh-lamed-vav-tsadek-kuf is probably where he was born - Solotsk???

I don't recall the exact wording on the Russian side but it mentioned a
coronation. Alexander III became tsar in 1881. Would he have been crowned
in 1883? Would some Jews have received personalized medals? Would these
have been souvenirs? royal gifts?

Mikhl Herzog asks:

> gits mir a groshn

I remember it as:

	Haynt iz purim,
	Morgn iz oys,
	Git mir a groshn
	Un varft mikh aroys.

We used to chant it:

Haynt iz Purim
Morgn iz ois
Git mir a groshn   (or a peni)
Un varft mir arois.

I guess Galitzianer were too dignified to say "gits mir" or "varfts mir"
even when behaving comedically. Gut yontef, a freylekhn Purim ale.

Subject: Purim doggerel

In no. 4.370, Reb Mikhl Herzog asked about a "bit of doggerel."  My
grandparents have often sung something similar, to wit:

A giten Pirem ale-kh
vi ikh gay fal ikh
d'burd iz mir lang
n'dus vab iz mir krank
haynt iz Pirem
morgn iz oys
gits mir a groshn
n'varfts mikh aroys

I imagine it originated as a ditty for a small child delivering
shlakhmunes in costume to ask for a tip.

Weinreich, in College Yiddish, lesson 12, p.113 gives us:

 Haynt iz purim, morgen iz oys.
 Git undz a groshn un varft undz aroys.

Which, while not identical to the lines Mikhl Herzog asked about,
must have some connection, no?
