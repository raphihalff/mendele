Subject: moyde ani

A propos M. Herzog's mention of MOYDE ANI: When saying
MOYDE ANI, the pronunciation (from Yiddish-speakers) that I
have heard is, no surprise:  mo'yde a'ni le'fane'kho etc.
etc. When calling the tfile by its name, I know of it (fun
der heym -- Yiddish from Grodne/Byalistok, "White
Russia/Northern Poland") as moydeni'.  In fact, there's a
children's rhyme:

        moydeni'
	kurtse kni.
	moyshe yokhes,
	kush in tokhes.

(I'm not sure what the context is for this rhyme to be said
in.) Does anyone else know of this pronunciation for the
prayer's name?  Or of this rhyme, for that matter?  And:
If I remember correctly, moyshe yokhes comes from the sider
as well, only I've forgotten from where.  Anyone know?

I suggest the people on the list who ganged up on me for
daring to use non-'standard' (*whose* standard?) yiddish,
write furious protests to the editors of
 
Lifshe Schaechter-Widman {Lifshe Shekhter-Vidman} _Az di
furst avek_ {Az du forst avek}, A Yiddish Folksinger from
the Bukovina. New York: Gloval Village Music, 1987, 1990

including the the ridiculous example of Lady Prince; but as
the saying goes "Le ridicule ne tue plus..."

[Margaret Winters writes about 'standard Yiddish':]

>When I studied at the Sholem Aleichem Folkshul, I was told
>that we were being taught a `standard Yiddish'
>pronunciation and spelling, based on the standard of the
>New York Yiddish theatre.  Is this a random choice, or was
>the theatrical Yiddish pronunciation consciously
>standardized (in the early part of the century, I would
>imagine)? 

hi margaret. yes, it was consciously standardized. at least
one guy, prilutzki, proposed a standard, and it in fact is
what you hear on the stage. for all intents and purposes,
it's basically volhyner yiddish. the reference is:

Prilutski, N. 1927. Di yidishe bineshprakh. Yidish Teater
2.129-44.

Subject: Addenda

1) Leonard, one thing I forgot to mention: You refer to the
Yiddish material in the Cairo Genizah as having "migrated
to Cairo". Doesn't that question still remain open as far
as the 14th century "Cambridge Codex" is concerned? As for
the 16th century epistolary material that Khave Turnianski
published, we know that that it was an exchange between
Jerusalem and Cairo.

2) Dovid Braun: As for "emetser", vocalic variation is
e/ey/i with "imitser" occurring outside the area normally
associated with i from "E5". The same holds for the words
gikh (gekh/gey(e)kh--gyakh/gikh) and im (em/eym/im). As for
the alternants with tsh, I may actually have a map, but I
don't think you'll find any correspondence to the
phenomenon of "sabesdiker- losn". I don't know what
connection it might have to variation in local
Slavic-language phonology but, in the case of shmate/smate
I think the answer does lie there. The variant eymitsha,
where "a" is the reflex of "r"-dropping is very
characteristic of the area of Brisk (i.e., Brest Litovsk):
tsika, pita, futa, etc.

3) Hershl Bershady:  you're referring to the "haccent" of
the so-called "tote-mome" area (which is also
"haich-dropping").

The expression, by the way, is "Moyshe-kapoyer" (not
"kapoyre"). Why Moyshe? Who knows? Literature? Theatre? Why
"yente" from a name with such "yikhes"? Theatre? Yente
Telebende? Which came first?

4) Berl Hoberman: a propos of the relevance of
pharyngealization, your point about the absence of
nasalization in the presence of khes seems very well taken.

On the subject of nasalization in Yiddish, in the absence
of etymological n, there is a case of a non-Hebrew-origin
word as well: may(n)ster/maanster 'master (craftsman)'.
Both Weinreich and Harkavy have separate entries for
"maynster"; only Weinreich varies the gloss.

By the way, I haven't forgotten my promise about the
reader. My office is being packed for a move. IF I have it
will surface next week.

5) Ellen, concerning your reference to "drerd". In Litvish
"drerd" and "dreykh" function as substantives which get
their own (pleonastic?) definite articles in such
expressions as "leyg es avek AFN drerd" and "der reykh
('smoke') geyt aruf INEM dreykh".

6) Moyshe-Nosn, whatever the case in Alsatian German, my
tapes of Alsatian Yiddish speakers shows that the mergers
(d/t, b/p) favor the lenis variant. It would be interesting
to confirm the coterritorial contrast. Alsatian Yiddish is
alive, if not entirely well, in Alsace. If you'd like to
pursue the matter, I'll refer you to people (in Shtrasborik
and elsewhere) who can be of help.

7) Finally, a propos of a recent reference to the absence
of the definite article after "in"; i.e., "in hoyz" (like
"inem hoyz"), means 'in THE house'. Notice that this is
true of prepositions "fun" and "lebn" as well; ("arum",
too, perhaps?): " a shtern iz aropgefaln fun(em) himl"; "er
shteyt lebn (dem) tish". Two possible explanations:
1)"grammatical/semantic"--these are all locative
constructions; cf. "er iz in hoyz/in shul/in Shikago"; ii)
"phonological/morphophonemic": All Yiddish prepositions
take the dative (unlike German); in the dative, preposition
plus article contraction is permissible only in the
masculine and neuter (again, unlike German). The form of
the contraction (of preposition plus dem) is NASAL, its
precise form phonologically determined: after
vowels--"m"--baym, tsum; after dentals--"n"-- mitn; after
labiodentals--(supply the symbol)--afn; after velars- -
-"ng"--noxn, farn; after nasals--"nasals", as follows:-m+N
= -men or zero (arum tish), -n+N = -nem or zero (in hoyz,
fun himl). The fly in the ointment? The feminines: shul,
shtot; in shul, fun shtot. The definite article is implicit
but an explicit article would be either fem. dat. "der" or
where fem. dat. and accus. have merged, "di": fun der
shtot/fin di shtuit.

Enough.

Yude-Leyb writes "Weinreichs and Mortkhe Shekhter";

Weinreich is in the usual romanized spelling, but Mortkhe
Shekhter is not; Is this intentional or a slip?  If
intentional, could you throw some more light on this?

Meylekh.
