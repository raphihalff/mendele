Subject: klezmer for the pure joy of it

I recently was contacted by a reporter from Canadian Press who is doing a
story on klezmer music.  She is interested in knowing about
persons/groups that get together and make music for the pure joy of it
(vs professional performers).  She is particularly interested in hearing
about this in Canada.  Her name is Diane Menzies and she can be contacted
at (416) 364 0321 ext 378 or 36 King St East Toronto Ontario M5C 2L9.

Subject: E. Stankiewicz's comments on Philologos

Permit me to add my comments to those of Edward Stankiewicz concerning
Philologos.  Stankiewicz offers concern about Philologos "growing lack of
responsibility towards his readers and about his subjects." In this case
the matter deals with Philologos' presentation of a theory about the
origin of the word "kurve."

I add to Sankiewicz's concerns my own and my comments have to do with
journalistic responsibility also.

More than a year ago, The Forward printed an article on the front page
with a large heading that contained the word "JEWESS."  That is to say,
The Forward was using the word as if it were an accepted part of the
English language, forgetting completely how pejorative it is and ignoring
the fact that it was a medieval anti-semitic word that has no place in
contemporary usage.  It reminds one of Ivanhoe when the text spoke of
"Rebecca the Jewess."  It makes one shudder to hear it.

I tried to think of a way to respond politely to this slap in the face,
and then it dawned on me that I had the perfect way to do it.  I would
write to Philologos and ask him to comment on the use of that ugly word,
and in the Forward no less.  And that is what I did.   Mind you,
Philologos was not the party that used the word.  I simply wanted to use
him to publish on the inappropriateness of its use in the very paper that
used it!

I suggested that he contrast the use of the word Jewess with that of
Catholicess, or Protestentess, or even Baptistess.  It might even be able
to be handled with style making light of an ugly situation. He could
comment that Christian or Moslem women do not, in English, have a special
form for women.  So why should Jewish women have such a special form.

I looked earnestly at Philologos' column each week for issue after issue.
He appeared to ignore the entire matter.

I could not figure out how it was possible for him to ignore a linguistic
issue that was, simultaneously, an anti semitic slur.  But he seemed to
do so.

Under the possibility that he might not have seen my first letter, I
wrote him a second imploring him to address the issue.  As far as I know
he never did, and I looked for months.

I can only conclude that he did not wish to offend his employer by being
critical of their ignorance in the use of that word.  But in doing so, I
stopped reading the column.  If he was unwilling to take on that issue
head first, of what value were his clever ripostes to matters such as the
origin of the word "kurve"?

Apparently he did not see the matter as one of "Physician, heal thyself."
I, like Stankiewicz, considered his action one of journalistic
irresponsibility.

Subject: Translation

Re Translation and Adaptation.  Robert Werman is very cogent, but I think
he has introduced yet another little problem, for all his clear remarks.
I have been responsible for a good number of books of poetry and fiction
translation, all collaborative work, from the Hungarian, the Persian, the
Bulgarian, the Serbo-Croatian, and several have been national
prizewinning volumes, with good cash, too.  Mendele has my biography, so
I dont offer titles.  I have also given many papers on the subject and
published them.  Anyone who has ever been a member of ALTA, American
Literary Translators Assoc.,and attended their congresses, will know how
many hundreds of papers have been devoted to arguments ont he subject,
which always come down the vexations Werman cites.  (I will also observe
that I seldom translate from languages I have studied, French or German,
or Italian , but always from exotic tongues, meaning languages I have not
got.)  HIgh risk on the highwire, indeed.

But...I do not make adaptations.  I make translations out of paraphrase,
and then transform these into metaphrase, or translation. People look for
the original adjectives and adverbs in comparing texts.  That is
nonsense.  The problems of bad translation versus good ones almost always
arise from the lack of professional practice as poet, or fictionwriter
or even essayist in the language one is making into a translation of a
foreign text.  One has to be, I always say, a practitioner in one's own
language.

I hate to say it but I dont mind offending: most professors and
scholars are incompetent writers of their own language, and most have no
experience in making poetry or fiction, and even less in clear
exposition.  Even less talent for reading and construing texts or ideas.
I speak as an academician of sorts, PhUD and all that for 44 years, 2/3rd
a lifetime.

I once heard a Rumanian writer/professor give a simply impatient talk
about translation, in Belgrade.  He made a good remark, which I am
reminded of because he may have found it in Benjamin.  He said,
Translation is impossible.  But, it can be done, because what's
translated are "logemes."  Not phonemes, not idiom, not metaphor, not
image.  A logeme is a unit of thought, as it were, contained in each
word, of course.  How is it said in one's own language.  Flavors do not
travel.  I pointed out in one of my many tedious discourses on the
subject that a rabbit is a word denoting a certain rodent.  But the
rabbit in W. African folktale is not the rabbit, not the jackrabbit in
the Americas.  Nightingales do not travel at all, as they are
nonexistent in this hemisphere. A rose in Persia is not a rose in
Scotland and not a rose in Virginia, nor in Dante, nor in Rosicrucianism,
nor in Marioltry, etc.  The thing itself is not the thing itself
elsewhere.  A rattlesnake is not a cobra.  A snake is a snake is a snake?
Only in the blank worldview of a dull writer like Gertrude Stein, and I
think she is very boring indeed, mostly, 95% so. That is off the
issue,however.

But, adaptations are usually very bad versions. Robert Lowell wrote
terrible things he called imitations, out of respect for his originals.
Pound wrote adaptations perhaps, such as his Sextus Propertius poems, and
called them translations.  Adaptation is usually a way of avoiding
responsibility for accuracy or faithfulness to the logeme.  But,
everything is said differently elsewhere, and nothing is the same.  I
have often been very bored by the translations Singer permitted in
English in his name.  His collaborators had tin ears.  I always winced at
the New Yorker stories.  But, gelt is gelt.  He shrugged: he had written
it already once, and that was it.  No, to repeat, pace Werman, A
translation is more or less a good thing in its new language; it is not
excused, if bad, by being called adaptation. that is Rats alley, where
the dead men lost their poems, to paraphrase (is it?) Eliot.

Subject: Yiddish and German

     It would appear that the UNIX/VAX counterpart to Malakh ha-Moyves
has done in my original submission to Mendele, hence this reposting.

     After reading a couple of opinions on the linguistic interactions
be- tween Yiddish and German speakers, I have decided to interject my two
Rappen's worth (SFr. .02).

     I have a passing familiarity with spoken Yiddish, acquired during my
childhood; my Swiss wife, both of whose parents are Swiss Jews and whose
native language is schwyzertuetsch, claims not to be able to understand a
word of Yiddish.  We usually attend one of the Lubavitcher shuls in
Zuerich, where the rabbi (from Brooklyn) delivers his droscha in a
mixture of English and Yiddish.  My wife (and her parents, on the few
occasions they frequent a Lubavitcher shul) say that they are TOTALLY
unable to decipher the Yiddish content.  In fact, even when I show my
wife Yiddish transliterated into Latin characters (as in some Mendele
postings), she looks at it for a few seconds and tosses it back at me
with a comment that it is indecipherable, even when the resemblance
between it and Schriftdeutsch is unmistakable.

     This leads me to suspect that there may be a strong psychological
component vis-a'-vis native German speakers who claim a total inability
to understand Yiddish, even when the latter is spoken clearly and slowly.
Restricting my comments now to Jews, I suggest that many (this being,
nowadays, a relative term) German-speaking "Westernised" Jews regard
themselves as culturally superior to Yiddish-speaking "Ostjuden" and,
embarassed by the "unenlightened ways" and historic fate of the latter,
(unconsciously?) turn a deaf ear to Yiddish, whilst rationalising this
behaviour with the excuse that Yiddish is simply a foreign language with
which they are ipso facto unfamiliar.

     I would be interested in any thoughts that fellow Mendelniks may
have regarding this speculation.

Subject: Re: Americanization

The incident of Americanization of immigrant family names that I like and
is true, occurred to my wife's great-grand uncle. His family name was
something like Kunniminskaya, The immigration officer had some difficulty
in writing it, and told him that Cohen would be more functional. He
adopted and gave that name to his children who did the same unto now
great grand-children. When the male descendents visit other synagogues,
they are regularly offered the first aliyah, or to dichen. They respond
with a thank-you, and an explication.

names, no further posts along these lines will be used.  nm]
