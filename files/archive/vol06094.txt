Subject: Bathhouse women

There's a fascinating description of a bathhouse and mikvah and its
attendants in Bella Chagall's memoir of her childhood (which has been
translated into English). It's an East European rather than an American
case, but perhaps it could prove useful.

Subject: Russian baths and mikves

In response to the recent query about Russian baths and mikves, I
recall that when I was growing up in Denver, the Lake Russian Baths on
the west side of town, where the largest Jewish populations was
concentrated (spreading out from Colfax Avenue), advertised itself as a
Russian and Turkish bath house, and had a mikve which was heavily used
by the Orthodox community, which was quite large and had numerous shuls.
Yiddish, of course, was the language of choice for the old-timers, who
naturally sprinkled heavy doses of English into their conversation.
Even young fellows--teens and twenties--repaired to the Russian bath for
a good "shvitz" and a fine corn-beef senvitch with a bottle of Big Chief
pop (soda to you easterners), which, incidentally, was produced by my
Zeyde, Harry (Hershel) Leiser.  It was a wonderful communal club where
chaveirim from all walks of life would come together to shvitz and shuz.
Wrapped in enormous towels, it was hard to distinguish the rich from the
poor-- a levelling experience if there ever was one.  I can't comment on
what it was like on ladies' days, but my friends and I have fond
memories of the shvitz-bud.

Subject: Bialik Yiddish class

On 10/17/96, we published a letter concerning a yiddish project that we
are working on. We asked for as many responses as possible, so that the
students in out yiddish class could each find one person to reply to,
and to talk to over a period of time. Unfortunately, however, we have
not gotten as many responses as we would have liked to get, and so we
are  republishing the letter one more time, in the hope that we will get
at least 10 more responces, so we do not have to cancel the project.

For those who have already written to us, we have gotten your letters,
and have not forgotten about you. We thank you for being as patient as
you have been, and we will respond to you as soon as all the letters
come in. If for some reason we don't get enough letters, and we have to
cancel the project, rest assured that we will get back to all that have
written to us, and let you know. Thank you again. The letter that I am
republishing is as follows:

We are a senior high school class at Bialik High School in Montreal,
Canada. As many of you know, Bialik High School is the only one of its kind
in North America, where Yiddish is part of the core curriculum. There are
700 students in the school, approximately 130 in the senior class. Some of
the students in the school have been learning Yiddish since grade 1 in the
Jewish Peoples' and Peretz School, the elementary branch of the High school.
Others only began studying Yiddish at the high school Level.

Our particular class of 18 students are relative newcomers to the
language. Our teacher, Anna Gonshor, has embarked on a project with us
entitled, "Why Yiddish?" We have already studied the history of the
Yiddish language and the beginnings of modern Yiddish literature in
order to be able to understand the role of Yiddish in the shaping of
modern Jewish identity. Part of our project also includes interviews
with individuals who are involved in some way with Yiddish. This brings
us to you. We would like to have you participate in our project by
responding to our invitation via Mendele. It is our hope that we will
meet people from various backgrounds and ages with varied interests and
reasons for being interested in  and committed to Yiddish. We hope to
find approximately 20 interested individuals to respond with on an
ongoing basis. We plan to post a summary of the project on the list for
all Mendelyaners to enjoy. We are quite excited about this project and
hope that you share some of our enthusiasm. If you do, please respond to
the list. We will then choose from among the responders to ensure as
varied a sampling as possible, and then communicate with you
individually. A groysn dank. (Secretary) E-mail address to:

N.B. Please respond in English, as some of us are still only learning
Yiddish.

Subject: Help needed in learning Yiddish

Is there anywhere within the Mendele domain that someone such as myself
can learn Yiddish? My knowledge is limited to but a handful of words. My
parents were fluent but only spoke it when they did not want my sister
and I to know their conversation.

I'm interested in conversation and reading (in Yiddish or English
transliteration). Any help will be appreciated.

A dank!

Jay Meyer
