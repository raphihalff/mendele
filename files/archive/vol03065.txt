Subject: Hershele

A widely used textbook of Israeli Hebrew, produced by Americans and
Israelis in the US, includes a couple of stories about a character
named Hershele, an impoverished, conniving guy who manages to trick
people into giving him something for nothing.  My feeling is that
the stories as retold in the textbook, together with some other
elements in the book, demonstrate a very low Jewish self-image, one
reason I'm reluctant to use the book in teaching.  (I wish we had a
Hebrew textbook with the combination of cultural and linguistic
sophistication of some of the Yiddish books.)  I wonder about the
source of these stories: is this Hershele Ostropolyer, or some other
character from Yiddish folklore?  And who is Hershele Ostropolyer,
anyway--a character from fiction or folklore?  And where can the
original stories be found?

Subject: Introduction

Hello, I'm very happy to be a new Mendele participant! I am a
University of Michigan doctoral candidate in the Program in American
Culture.  My thesis is on Jewish immigrant women's Yiddish and
English autobiographies.  I began my study of Yiddish in the summer
of 1989 at YIVO, and then continued for two years at Michigan.  My
mother, who spoke Yiddish as a child, is thrilled that once again
she has someone to speak with.

Subject: Kollegh

I think it means a geflochtene challe used in celebrations and
chasidic gatherings.

Subject: bukh or bikhl?

Shloyme Axelrod asks:

>2.  Bukh oder bikhl?  The first edition of *Yidish Tsvey" was
>subtitled "a lernbikhl far mitndike kursn."  The subtitle of the new
>edition is "a lernbukh far mitndike un vaythalters."  Somewhere
>(maybe in the first edition, maybe in *Afn Shvel*?) Schaechter notes
>that the ordinary word for "book" is "bikhl", not "bukh".  Sounds
>curious to non-native-speaking me.  Apparently it's not a matter of
>size:  The second edition [the lernbukh] has 586 pages; but the

>zikh di frage in any case, Why the change from lernbikhl to
>lernbukh?  Melekh Viswanath, can you help us here?

I'll check with Dr. Schaechter.  And since we are speaking of Yidish
Tsvey, I think it would be appropriate to provide some details on
this book, which should be very welcome to many Mendeleniks.  I am
reproducing the press release (in English; as Shloyme noted, the
Yiddish version is interesting in its own right, but the English one
may be more useful in getting the information where it needs to go).

Meylekh.

Yiddish II: An Intermediate and Advanced Textbook (henceforth, Y2) by
Dr. Mordkhe Schaechter (Senior Lecturer in Yiddish Studies Emeritus at
Columbia University) has just come off the press.  It has been eagerly
awaited everywhere by students who have completed a beginner's textbook,
or have equivalent background, and wish to continue their progress in the
Yiddish language.

 Y2 is the first continuation level Yiddish textbook ever written
for speakers of English.  However, speakers of other languages with
only a passive knowledge of English can use this book with equal
profit.

 Y2 is unique in giving particular emphasis to the sounds and
patterns of authentic spoken Yiddish, at the same time enriching the
student's knowledge of the written language as well.

 Y2 is the first Yiddish textbook to enter the age of technology.
Its text materials incorporate the Yiddish terms for computer
science, to input, tape recorder, burglar alarm, answering machine,
photocopier, FAX machine and skyjacking.

 Y2 is also rich in its inclusion of proverbs and aphorisms from the
traditional Jewish world.  Such sayings are encountered in the seech
of religious and secular Jews alike.

 Y2 contains valuable informaton on the major dialects of Yiddish in
its Eastern European heartland.  Geographical areas are identified
with their traditional Yiddish names and located according to both
historical and 1993 political boundaries.

  Y2 has 586 pages and serves as both a textbook and a reference
grammar, covering topics never before treated in any Yiddish
grammars or textbooks published anywhere.

  Y2 is a must for all teachers and students of the Yiddish
language, literature and folklore.  It will also be of great benefit
to Yiddish writers, editors, proofreaders, actors and
musicians--whether scholars or laymen-- as well as to Yiddish book
collectors and anyone else who loves the Yiddish language.

  The price is $36 per copy for the hardcover edition and $28 for
the softcover.  (For members of the League for Yiddish, whose dues
are current, prices are $30 and $24 respectively for the hard and
soft-cover editions.) If ordering by mail, please add postage and
handling ($4 for the first copy ordered and $2 for additional
copies).  All orders must be prepaid in US funds (made out to the
League for Yiddish) and sent to:

  Yiddish Language Resource Center
  League for Yiddish, Inc.
  200 W. 72 Street #40
  New York, NY 10023-2824.
