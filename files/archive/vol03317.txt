Subject: re: dana

I don't really know the meaning of the word "Dana"  (Yiddish song books,
published in Germany, generally explained it as an abbreviation of
"Adonay", but I don't find it convincing.)  However, I can give you some
information about the origin of the song (Khane Mlotek pointed this out
to me a few years ago):

It was written by Aaron Zeitlin, music by Sholom Secunda.  It was
originally part of the play:  Esterke un Kazimir der groyser.  Zeitlin
published the play in the journal *Globus* (Warsaw, 1932).  In 1940, the
play premiered in New York in a revised version by Zeitlin.  The words
to "Dana" have frequently been attributed to Yitskhok Katsenelson, but
this has proven to be untrue.  BTW, YIVO has the program of a performance
of "Esterke un Kazimir der groyser" with a reference to and the words of
"Dana" in its archives.

Subject: Dona, dona

In response to Daniella HarPaz's inquiry about the song "Dona, dona": The
song is included in Khane (Eleanor Gordon) and Yosl (Joseph) Mlotek's
collection, _Pearls of Yiddish Song/Perl fun yidishn lid_, published by
the Arbeter Ring in New York in 1988.  In their introduction to the song,
which was written by Aaron Zeitlin (1889- 1973) with music by Sholom
Secunda (1894-1974), they point out that it was originally entitled
"Dana, dana, dana" and was written for Zeitlin's play _Esterke_, which
Maurice Schwartz produced in 1940-41.

The word _dana_ is a joyful exclamation used in Polish and other Slavic
folk songs, often in formulas like _oy, dana, dana_.

Subject: Feygele

I remember the expression "toom-tam" being used "by mir in der heim", I
never heard "feygele" until I came  to the USA.

Subject: Petsha redux

Devorah Sperling, who is not currently on the net, asks about the
etymology of the gastronomic term _petsha/petshe/petsa_. The dish itself
was the subject of various opinions pro and con some time ago on Mendele.
Incidentally, Stutchkoff (in his _Oytser fun der yidisher shprakh_) gives
many synonyms (or regional variants):  fus, fis, geshtelte/fargliverte
fis, krazlfus, grayshlfus, fusnoge, fusnohe, drilye/drelye [perhaps from
Ukrainian _drahli_], galyer(te), ishkes, kholodets, shtuding, zhele,
geliverts, gegliverekhts, kvashene.

Subject: Ton/tin and verbal repetition

Kathleen Rose Noe brings up an interesting aspect of verbal construction
in Yiddish. In Yiddish as opposed to German, I think the main divergence
is in the purpose of ton/tin used with the verb, and that has to do with
aspect. It's a hard thing for English speakers to grasp; compare it to
French or Spanish, where there is a distinction between perfect and
imperfect. Example: Ikh hob gelernt; Ikh hob oysgelernt. Ikh kuk; ikh tu
a kuk. German lacks this entirely.

"Zingen zingt er" doesn't exist in German. This repetition of the verb
requires that the stems be phonetically the same, which is why you get
"Izn iz er".

And now, I'll say what Kathleen said, Someone please correct me if I'm
wrong or have missed something.
