Subject: PAC and PJ

PAC, Project: Accredited Courses, started with the column on the
Yiddish program at UCL in the September issue of der bay.  Ohio
State will be PAC 2 in the November issue.  Each month another
college will appear.  The aim is to have a clearinghouse of current
catalogs and a description of the programs.  There will be no
evaluation, only facts.

These will appear in the order in which they are received.  Please
send the article online so that it can be easily formatted.  A
catalog listing the current courses is needed.  It is hoped that
B'nai B'rith will list these programs in their annual GUIDE TO
JEWISH LIFE ON CAMPUS.  This list will be available on request.

PJ, Project Journals, is an effort to update the list of Yiddish
periodicals, newspapers, magazines, newsletters and Yiddish
organizations.  The starting point is Dina Abramowicz's listing in
JUDAICA LIBRARIANSHIP, the Journal of the Assn. of Jewish Libraries,
Spring 1984 issue.

Please send additions, deletions, and corrections online to Fishl.

Subjwct: Nasalized "ayin" and payger

The name Yankel for ya'kov drives from the notion that the original
pronounc- iation of "ayin" (preseveresed in Yemenite and
high-Sephardic ("Shemang Yisrael " as heard in the spanish-portugese
rite) entered into Yiddish oyssprakh dos heisst that Yiddish
presereved the distinvction between shtumer Aleph and nasalized
ayin- no alepg beys permits two letters to serve only one function.
I am fascinated by this Shephardic/Ashkenazic nexus and propose that
it had an Italian interface- in the renaissance anf later- (e.g. the
Bovo book, (bobe mayseh, etc.) Yankel is of course only one of the
many nasalized ayins that have been discussed recently in these
messAges.

Peyger- has I beleive a Hebrew opshtam and is used only with the demise
of animals and as a slur for a non-Jews.  Jews use the verb nifter
for a Jew and histalek for a tzaddik.

Subject: Pinchas

	I once did miluim (reserve army service) with an
Egyptologist, who informed me that the name Pinchas is ancient
Egyptian in origin (after all, the original Pinchas was in the
Exodus).  The P is the definite article, equivalent to Hebrew's
prefix 'heh', and the n-ch-s means black.
