Subject: Pluperfect

thanks, dovid, for the long post. i see i didn't make myself clear. (or maybe
you didn't. :) )

first, i don't know why you say olsvanger uses _gevest_ as an 'invariant
auxiliary in the pluperfect' -- all the tokens of _gevest_ i see are in the
past *conditional* (i.e. with _voltn_). for the pluperfect, i've found about 6
tokens and he uses _geven_ and _gehat_ as one would expect, e.g.:

zey hobn beyde gehat gedint in soldatn, hobn zey gekent shisn. (RP51) 'they
had both served as soldiers, so they knew how to shoot.'

az der yid iz geven avekgegangen, fregt der toyber dem zun:... (RP168) 'when
the guy had gone away, the deaf man asks his son:...'

but now to more serious misunderstandings. of course you're right that SOME
northeast yiddish (ney) speakers have leveled the hobn/zayn distinction in
general. obviously, they are therefore of no relevance whatsoever to the form
of the pluperfect i'm looking at and so i haven't considered them at all. the
ney speakers i was referring to are those like olsvanger who still have a
hobn/zayn distinction in general AND keep the earlier pluperfect, with _geven_
as the past participle of _zayn_, e.g. the second example cited above, rather
than use _gehat_ with both _hobn_ and _zayn_ verbs in the pluperfect. ok, is
this clear now? sorry for leaving so much to inference.

>If being a litvak is significant to auxiliary selection, and given that
>_some_ levelling in _some_ areas of Lite and Vaysrusland has taken place,
>wouldn't we dafke expect instances of _gehat_ with _zayn_-verbs?

[i know noyekh doesn't like such quotes -- but this question is too
complicated to paraphrase! zayt mir moykhl.] this is a slight restatement of
what i just said: so far as i can tell, those ney speakers who retain a
hobn/zayn distinction in general do NOT use _gehat_ with _zayn_ verbs in the
pluperfect! it's the central yiddish speakers (and maybe southeast?) that do.
which is very interesting and in fact fits in with my little story that what's
going on is a syntactic reanalysis, not a lexical confusion. thanks for
bringing it to my attention!

Subject: Gewesst/gevezt

The Olsvanger book [see 5.216, 5.218] was first published in German. I have a
copy which was given to me as a gift by colleagues at NYU who knew that I had
a real interest in Yiddish (I also cataloged most of their old Yiddish
newspapers and perio- dicals). The supplementary material and footnotes are in
German, texts are in Yiddish.

The book claims to use Northeastern Yiddish. "Oy" is rendered <circumflex> ej.
Double s is used to render Yiddish samekh, and single s is for zayen. W is
used for v, so you get "gewesst". There are some gender conflicts, and I think
the texts don't use neuter, so you get "di kop" instead of der. The hobn/zayn
usage is like the klal-shprakh. But the gewesst always attracted my attention
since my first excursions into Yiddish were I.B. Singer (btw, Der knekht was
the first Yiddish novel I ever read, and I highly recommend it to beginners),
and he uses "iz gehat gegangen".

In Dutch you get geweest, and in Schwyzerduetsch you get gzi (gesein). Is
there an attested Yiddish use of gezayn, I wonder?

1996 Columbia/YIVO Yiddish Summer Program accepting applications

New York City--January 9, 1996--Applications are now being accepted for the
Uriel Weinreich Program in Yiddish Language, Literature and Culture, which
will take place on the Columbia University campus from June 24 to August 2,
1996.  The program, jointly sponsored by the Max Weinreich Center of the YIVO
Institute for Jewish Research and Columbia University, is a six-week,
non-matriculating, three-credit college course offered on three levels:
elementary, intermediate and advanced.  The program proper will be preceded by
an optional two-week review session for intermediate and advanced students
beginning on June 10.  Elementary students with no reading or writing
knowledge of the Yiddish alphabet are required to attend a one-day reading and
writing workshop on Sunday, June 23. People worldwide have discovered the
importance of Yiddish as a key to understanding a significant component of the
Jewish heritage.  Every summer for the last twenty-eight years, several dozen
people from diverse backgrounds, professional pursuits and places as
far-ranging as Russia, Poland, Lithuania, Argentina, China and Australia make
their way to New York City to study Yiddish in the world's first and most
acclaimed, college-level Yiddish-language program. Many summer program
students have gone on to become fellows of the Max Weinreich Center, an
accredited institute for advanced study of East European and American Jewish
history and culture.  Others have entered graduate programs in Jewish studies
offered by major universities throughout North America, Europe and Israel.
The program has thus served as an essential stepping stone in the careers of
such prominent scholars in the field of Yiddish as Janet Hadda, Michael
Stanislawski, Jack Kugelmass and Irena Klepfisz. Participants in the program
not only learn the fundamentals of Yiddish grammar and read Yiddish literary
classics, but also explore the riches of East European and American Jewish
culture through lectures in Yiddish and English, Yiddish films, Yiddish
conversation groups and a variety of workshops in translation, theater,
folksong and traditional dance. As a means of expanding the opportunities for
verbal practice and creating a feeling of camaraderie, out-of-towners are
given the option of staying in single rooms in  Yidish hoyz, a Yiddish
dormitory suite on campus. Excursions to Jewish points of interest in and
outside of New York City add depth and immediacy to subjects covered in the
classroom. Dr. Allan Nadler, Director of Research at YIVO, has called the
program "an intensive, intellectually stimulating experience, whose rewards
remain throughout one's lifetime."   For an application including information
on housing and partial scholarships, call, fax or write to Jeffrey Salant,
Director of Yiddish Language Programs, YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, 555
West 57th Street Suite 1100, New York, NY 10019, (212) 246-6080, fax (212)
292-1892.  The deadline for scholarship applications is March 28.
