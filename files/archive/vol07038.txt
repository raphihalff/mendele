Subject: Professor Chone Shmeruk's funeral in Warsaw 

The Yiddish world already knows the sad news about Professor Chone Shmeruk's 
death. The funeral took place on Tuesday, July 8th, at 1 p.m. in the Jewish 
Cemetery in Warsaw. It was attended by Professor Shmeruk's family from Israel 
and Poland as well as by many of his friends, coworkers and students from 
Poland and abroad. It is worth remembering that Professor Shmeruk received the 
State of Israel Prize in 1996. In the same year he received the Krzyz 
Kawalerski Orderu Odrodzenia Polski, one of the highest insignias awarded to 
people whose services to Poland and Polish culture are particulary 
outstanding. At the funeral both awards were symbolically displayed and the 
ambassador of Israel in Poland and a representative of the Polish president 
spoke about Chone Shmeruk's contribution to Jewish and Polish culture. 
Eulogies were also given by his close friends: Marek Edelman, the last living 
insurgent from the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Jozef Hen, a well-known Polish 
Jewish writer, and by others. 

Professor Shmeruk was honoured by the Polish government through the attendance 
of a large honorary guard of the Polish Armed Forces including a military 
orchestra. The honorary guard fired three volleys in the air as the coffin was 
lowered in the grave. Rabbi Joskowicz, the chief rabbi of Poland spoke about 
the deceased and said Kaddish. The grave was covered with wreaths and bouquets 
of flowers and symbolic stones brought from Israel.

Up until his stroke of last year Professor Shmeruk was an extremely energetic 
man, and his sharp mind remained with him until the end. He parted when he had 
so much left to offer. He will remain in the memory of those who loved and 
respected him and his work will be continued by those who owe him so much.

Subject: Chone Shmeruk 

Such sad news about Chone Shmeruk. I had the pleasure of being one of his
students at a seminar in Yiddish literature which he gave at the Columbia/Max
Weinreich program. It was held at the YIVO Institute circa 1970. He was a
wonderful teacher, a warm human being, and a most considerate man. It was he
who first directed me to the profound influence of Walt Whitman on the poetry
of I. J. Schwartz; he also introduced me to a remarkable literary Yiddish
journal JUGEND, of which only three issues were published. Nevertheless, it
expresses the quintessential creative power of 'di yunge.'  As that
publication remains with me, so does the memory of Chone Shmeruk, whose gift
for teaching and love of Yiddish benefited and enriched my life. May his
memory be a blessing for generations to come.
