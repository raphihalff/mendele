interesting that you should mention it, because 'matzah pizza' is one of
the staples of passover foods available at our dining halls here at
cornell.

i never would have imagined the stuff before coming here, but now that
i've been living off it for the greater part of the week, it seems as
natural as gefilte fish and matzah brei! :)

actually, i think cornell dining must have asked someone once what one
eats for passover and got the response, "gefilte fish and horseradish,
hard-boiled eggs, matzah, and chicken soup" because for the entire week
they show up at every meal as the "passover option."

it makes the pizza (whose name is distressingly like "macchu picchu"!) a
welcome break -- a naye pesakh maykhl farn 'nineties' i guess... (will it
be a new seder course in 100 years, right after the hillel sandwich??
maybe with some maror???) :) but now back to our regularly scheduled
programming...

1. More s and z

Eli Katz:

a gezunt dir in di beyner! That's the most convincing. that's the ONLY
explanation I've ever heard for Yiddish say(dn). Can I cite you in Volume
III (Eli Katz, personal communication)?

2. Learning Yiddish, particularly (but not exclusively) for German
speakers: There is an unusually good dictionary, number 24 in the series
Duden Taschenbuecher (1992), "Jiddisches Woerterbuch, mit Hinweisen zur
Schreibung, Grammatik und Aussprache" by Ronald Loetsch. I met Loetsch in
what had recently been "East" Berlin several years ago, and his obvious
sensitivity to the specificities of Yiddish provided dramatic evidence of
how permeable even that wall had been.

3. Mendele subscribers in Germany: If you make yourself known to me
directly, I would like to acquaint you with my work in Germany. I expect
to be in Marburg, Mannheim, and Duesseldorf later this month, and will
take the opportunity of sending you a separate message.

4. Shnayder-loshn: If I'm not mistaken, "trenen" in its familiar usage,
derives from shnayder-loshn, where it simply means 'to rip a seam'.
That's also the source of such terms as "damske shnayder" and "botn
hol-makher" ('button hole') for 'father of girls'. Does anyone have more
to add to this treasury?

In the same vein as "George Brent and Helen Trent", there' another that
stems from a personal sojourn in a place called Cream Ridge, New Jersey.
Anyone who knows where that is will probably know why and when I was
there. In any event, we'd go into Trenton, from time to time and, if my
memory serves me, there were two hotels there, the Stacy Trent and the
Hilda Brecht. Can anyone confirm that.

When I lived in Cream Ridge, the rousing Yiddish songs from the Soviet
Union were popular, including Zhankoje. The English version thereof had a
sequence which we later learned referred to "the cream extractor". For
years we wondered how they could have been referring to our "Cream Ridge
tractor". To be added to the list of Mondegreens".

Subject: Amerike ganef

We receive many inquiries from readers in the YIVO Library, in person, by
phone and by mail, and we try to answer them ourselves as best we can.
Today, however, a letter arrived which I will excerpt in the hope that
MENDELnikes might be able to throw in their two cents' worth, thereby
helping us to answer the reader's questions.

It has to do with the phrase "Amerike ganef," "which [our reader
continues] Rosten defines or rather describes as a phrase of 'admiration,
awe, gratitude, and a declaration of possibilities beyond belief and
without limit.'  He continues, 'To say "America gonif" [sic] was to say:
"Anything is possible in this wonderful land".'  My question concerns its
usage.  Rosten suggests that it is used to comment on the nature of the
place, rather than the abilities of an individual.  I wonder if it is
possible, whether it has been used in this latter context."  The reader
cites an example, "Grandfather writes from Poland, How is my America
gonif?" (which she composed and proposes to include in a poem).  "I find
myself in a quandary regarding the phrase 'America gonif,' find myself
caught between the need and responsibility of adhering to correct usage
and my attachment to my own apparent misreading.... So I am turning to
you for help, first in determining the possible and correct usage of the
phrase, and second, finding a possible alternative, if necessary and if
one exists."

The reference to Rosten is p. 139 of The Joys of Yiddish, by Leo Rosten
(New York:  McGraw-Hill, 1968).

For my part, I would be interested in hearing what MENDELnikes have to
say about our reader's poetic quandary, and any and all concrete
illustrations of the use of the phrase "Amerike ganef" will be most
appreciated.

By the way, a former colleague of mine from Ukmerge (Vilkomir),
Lithuania, once corrected me when I uttered the words "Amerike ganef,"
and said that, properly, it should be "Ameritshke ganef." (I assume that
this is how he heard it in his youth; he remained in Lithuania until the
1970s and eventually made his way to Montreal, where I met him in 1981.)
On another occasion, this same colleague informed me that the use of
Yiddish "takae" was prost -- "non-U," as our English friends might say.
I wonder where he got THAT?  (His father taught in a Yiddish school in
Ukmerge and he himself studied in a Yiddish gymnasium in Kaunas/Kovne,
just before World War II [where one of his teachers was the lexicographer
Yudel Mark].)

Subject: Gefrishhte matse

Mendelnikes un nitses, I have no wish to initiate a lengthy discussion
since culinary makhloykes are only second to linguistic ones in their
intensity. However, bay unz in der heym hot men gegesn "gefrishte matse"
which our correspondent described as " steamed matse" as well as matse
bray (brei) which is then fried after the boiling water has been quickly
drained from the  gebrokte matse. My ten year old grandson made a batch
for the assembled multitude this Peysakh. Mit a gutn apetit,
