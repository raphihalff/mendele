Subject: Moshe Rabeynu

In response to Yankel Kurtzman's request, I have the Yiddish primer "Dos
Idishe Kind", which contains the poem that Yankel mentioned. I used the book
in a Yiddish class at a Talmud Torah, which explains the religious themes in
the stories and poems.  The author is Pinkhas Rodoy and the book was
published in 1929. This is the poem: 

                       A BEYS HAMEDRESHL

Moyshe Rabeynu af yener velt
Varf mir arop a zekele gelt!
Tsu vos darfstu a zekele gelt?
A ferd un vegele tsu koyfn!
Tsu vos darfstu a ferd un vegele koyfn?
Shteyndelekh tsu firn!
Tsu vos darfstu steyndelekh firn?
A beys-hamedreshl tsu boyen!
Tsu vos darfstu a beys-hamedreshl boyen?
Dem foter in himl loybn,
On im tuen mir gloybn!

Menakhem Karp

The rabbi whom the Kurtzmans queried (08.038) obviously didn't know the camp
song we used. (Sorry I can't convey the melody): 

Ikh bin gevaldik tsufridn vos mayn mame hot mir gehat (x 3)
Un nit keyn fremde yidene!

Subject: From zealous clarion

It's distressing to find myself in opposition to someone I respect as much as
I do Lucas Bruyn, but I must explain certain things, both to him and any
others who share his opinion. 

"Interference" from world Jewry helped create modern Zionism and the state of
Israel, help her build the land, the hospitals, the Histadrut, reforest the
dry places, build up the universities, defend her in times of danger, and so
much more. The boundary between Israel and the Jews in the Diaspora is fuzzy
at best. 

Non-Israeli Jews have long expressed their support and/or criticism of
various aspects of the Israeli government and the Sokhnut. It's a grand old
tradition, whether met with approval or not. If it were not so, why do
members of the Israeli government and other entities need to come calling at
all those $1000 a plate dinners? 

Correction - a Yiddish curriculum does exist, texts, testing and materials do
exist, teachers are being prepared at places like Lewinsky (no relation to
Monica?) College. Budget is for expansion of activities from 40 schools to a
much greater number -- I believe there are around 200 to 300 schools in the
land. I hope that clarifies this situation. 

If I seem zealous, it's because here is an opportunity being squashed to
achieve something very important in the Israeli schools. Just as the
so-called dead language of Hebrew was revived by fiat of clarion call Rock
Ivrit Zealots, so must Yiddish be saved from destruction by making it
available to Israeli kids, K through high school and beyond ,not to replace
Hebrew, but as an important part of their Jewish Heritage.  All the love and
nostalgia in the world for Yiddish, and I agree, all the university programs,
be there 50 or 100, will not be enough. It must be nurtured in the young. 

Yiddish is still in the mouths of Orthodox children -- but what about Yiddish
in the mouths of kids from secular homes?

Subject: Inventory of Teaching Materials

Now the Mendelists seem to be at the point of taking political action with
the aim to have Yiddish taught in Israeli schools (The E-mail address of the
Knesset is still a secret) I would like to make an inventory of teaching
materials for Yiddish in existence. 

First of all I want to collect a list with biographic details: Writer, title,
sub-title, publisher, place and year of publication, number of pages,
ISBN/Library of Congress number;

Because a title does not tell much I would also like the following
information.  Type of book, e.g. course book, reader, grammar with/without
exercises.  Language of instruction, group the book is intended for (very
young children, primary school, college, university, self instruction, short
intensive courses; level aimed at (beginners, intermediate, upper
intermediate, advanced).  If possible information about the method used
should be added as well, e.g. grammar-translation method, integrated course.
If the course is supported by other materials, such as audiovisual materials,
computer programmes, this should be indicated. 

I also would like information from teachers who have taught courses using
certain materials or combinations of materials. What works, for whom? What
dictionary did you use? Are there any educational posters? Flashcards? 
Information from students who loved a certain course is also welcome. 

Information from teachers and students outside the United States/ Canada -
Israel, Europe, CIS countries will be most welcome. 

If this information has already been collected, please let me know how to
find it. 

Lucas Bruyn.

Subject: Nokhem, Nakhem

In 08.037 my friend Yosef Gilboa brings an explanation from his Rabbi about
Nokhum and Nakhum, claiming that the latter should be used for prophets while
Nokhum is appropriate for humans. 

I have a serious disagreement with that as in the Bible we have a book Nakhum
after a prophet by that name, who in spite of being a prophet was still a
*human* being. 

The whole matter reminds me of a story I heard or read many many years ago. 
In a town the name of their Rebbe was Nokhem and he held very strong views on
most matters trying to impose them on his flock.  One person who disagreed on
something with Reb Nokhem quoted the khumesh Shmos(=Shmot=Exodus) 13,17 were
it said "loy nokhem eloyhim", i.e. Nokhem is not God.  Reb Nokhem replied
quickly, quoting the next three words of that verse: "derekh erets
plishtim!", i.e. something like show some respect you Philistine.  The word
Philistine here referring essentially to that unpleasant (for the Jews)
nation of Delila and others, and not to its modern usage. 

To clarify matters, I have tried to use here the Ashkenazi (Yiddish) 
transliteration of Hebrew words and names, and hope that I have not made too
many mistakes.

Subject: feygl

What's in a name?

Sounds like a fair exchange - Shprintse the Bird-girl for Feygl the Blossom.

Shayle for Mikhl: What is the English name for the flower from which the name
Feygl is derived? My favorite niece, Feygele, has been calling herself
Tsipora...

Also my apology for my dyslexic reversals in transliterative 'ay' and 'ey'. I
should have written 'peyde' and 'treyf' in Mendele 8.038.

Subject: Yinglish

Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan has raised a valid point regarding English words
in Yiddish.  There were many words that Yiddish speaking immigrants used that
were only in English.  For example, in akosher butcher shop there would be a
sign in Yiddish letters, chickens.  I remember asking for the Yiddish word
and few if any remembered a hun. 

It is true thet our lerers in shule wanted us to use the old country Yiddish. 
In part to preserve it, in part because many of them were poets and writers
and they wanted to insure a future audience,in part because the classic
Yiddish literature which they were teaching had no English and in mostly
because people who teach language are usually resistant to change. 

This is true in France where the Academy is fighting against the constant
growth of English words in everyday French. There is recognition among many
of Spanish speaking New Yorkerds that there is a spoken language called
Spanglish. 

Where Yiddish is an everyday language in the Hasidic community then there are
English words.  For example, nobody seems to use any word for ball as in varf
dem ball. 

If as Yiddishists want and Yiddish is to be a living language the it has to
include English derived words.
