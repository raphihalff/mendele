Subject: u - i

In connection with the u - i connection mentioned here, I am fascinated by
the letter upsilon in Greek which serves as a v (Evropa, Evripides) or a u ,
just as the vaf does (David, dudi), but also as a y (ygrec in French) and is
pronounced as an umlauted u in German (analysis).  Without any philological
backup, it seems to me that Ukraine, being the nearest to Greece of all the
Ashkenazic lands, might still retain this triple (quadruple?) pronunciation
in the cognative letter.

Subject: u - i

Tayere Mendelyaner,

In response to Ben Fogel:

Several of my friends are from Lodz, Poland, or are the descendants of
people from that city, and they all regularly pronounce /u/ as [i] and [I]
in Yiddish, as do speakers from other areas of Poland I know (and so do I
now, thanks to extensive exposure to their "accents," though I usually write
"u" in Romanization).  So, obviously this feature is in no way unique to the
southeast of the Ukraine.  Do not dialect maps also indicate that this is a
very widely spread feature?  Surely Mikhl Herzog had additional linguistic
features or perhaps non-linguistic clues in mind when he surmised we were
dealing with Southern Yiddish, perhaps of Southeastern Ukraine.

With regard to the discussion of "diln/duln a spodik", I would like to say
that: man futer 'n miter, hobn nit gezugt say diln say duln.  Ba ins hot men

Subject: "real" geography & "dialect" geography

Ben Fogel (9:032) take me to task for considering Yiddish in Lublin part of
Southern Yiddish. The Southern Ukraine, yes, obviously; but Poland? 
Horrors! 

Well, I'm actually grateful to Ben for giving me the opportunity to sound
off on this subject, although some of you may remember, better than I, if
I've already done so in the past. So here goes (again?): 

All of the following may be relevant to the question:
There is no precise correlation between the following entities:
1) language names;
2) the boundaries of specific linguistic features;
3) the boundaries between what we generally refer to as "dialects";
4) political boundaries;
5) linguistic and geographic directions, or linguistic and geographic 
topology.

Re 4: Barring wars, etc. political boundaries are fixed. We know where 
France ends and Italy begins.

Re 1: Language names are often politically, NOT linguistically 
motivated. Language boundaries are fluid. In France, one speaks French, 
ostensibly; in Italy, Italian. As many speakers on the French-Italian 
border can testify, the problem is more complicated. Unless they are 
speaking the languages of Paris aand Rome, the presumed differences in 
their languages may be difficult to discern, regardless of what they 
name tham..

Re 2: The boundaries of specific linguistic features (e.g., between 
_zogn_ and _zugn_)can generally be plotted quite accurately on 
linguistic maps, but may actually shift in the course of time.

Re 3: What we call "dialects" are linguistic entities whose boundaries 
are often arbitrarily selected from among the items described in 2) 
above. If a single feature is taken as criterial, 2 dialects will 
emerge. Two feature may yield 3 dialect areas: X, Y, and XY. You can 
figure out where to go from there.

Re 5: The following will illustrate this and all of the above.

Yiddish Lite = Lithuania, right? Litvish = Lithuanian, and a Litvak = a
Lithuanian, no? NO! 

On the Jewish map, Lite is the area where Litvish Yiddish is
spoken--Lithuania, Latvia, Belorussia, and the Northern Ukraine.  Lite is a
Jewish language-and culture-area--not a political one.  A Lithuanian
(no-Jew) in Yiddish is a Litviner. A Litvak is a Jew from Lite (see above). 

The area in which Litvish Yiddish is spoken is known as Northeastern 
Yiddish in the dialectological literature.

Together, Yiddish in most of the Ukraine, in Rumania, and in all of 
Poland is called Southern Yiddish (a term I did not invent). Southern 
Yiddish is itself divided into Southeastern Yiddish (essentially, 
Rumania and most of the Ukraine), and Central Yiddish (essentially 
Poland, including Galicia). In other words, the fact that Poland is not 
"South" doesn't preclude us from considering it part of the "Southern 
Yiddish" dialect area.

In a similar vein: Many speakers of Yiddish entertain a stereotype of the
"Galitsyaner" and the way he speaks. A closer look reveals that there is no
defineable "Galitsyaner" dialect. Galicia is an easily defined historical
area but, as it turns out it is divided by important linguistic features
that distinguish Yiddish in Poland from Yiddish in the Ukraine. The most
important of these is the border between _geyn/gayn_, _shteyn/shtayn_,
_heym/haym_. 

To belabor the point with an additional illustration. The "Jewish" map 
of Hungary consists of two major language and culture areas:

"Oyberland" 'Highland' and "Unterland" 'Lowland'. These terms, which reflect
the topography of Hungary, are calques of Hungarian terms for "Highlands"
and "Lowlands". So the Yiddish and Hungarian terms have the same referents,
right? WRONG! 

The Jewish map and the Hungarian map of the same Hungarian territory DO NOT
correspond. The Hungarian division is a North-South one, and actually
corresponds to the topography. The Jewish division is essentially an
East-West one, and DOES NOT, despite the terminology. It refers to strictly
Jewish language and culture areas. Same words, different music. 

I might be able to go on, but perhaps I've said enough.

Subject: Courtly romance literature, King Arthur

In Mendele Vol 09.032 Norman Simms asked about "medieval Yiddish traditions
in courtly romance literature, troubador and trouvere traditions, and
Yiddish responses to the Arthurian fad from the 12th-15th centuries." 

Of course the first place to start looking for this topic, apart from the
MLA and RAMBI bibliographies, are the works of Chone Shmeruk and the two
prewar literary histories of pre-modern Yiddish literature, Zinberg and
Erik. (Those who read French can also find valuable information in Jean
Baumgarten's introduction to older Yiddish literature which includes a long
bibliography.) Shmeruk discusses the "shpilman" theory put forward by Erik
in detail. 

There are quite a few articles on on Yiddish adaptations of the Arthurian
tradition, notably by Robert G. Warnock and Wulf-Otto Dreessen. I have
listed a few below.

Since Yiddish literature should not just be seen in its relation to
non-Jewish literatures, it would also be interesting to look at Hebrew
adaptations. Curt Leviant has published on one or more Hebrew adaptations
of the Arthurian tradition.

Institute for Poetics & Semiotics, Tel Aviv University 1978.

Subject: Yiddish in Jerusalem

Rukhl Eissenstat refered to " lots of Yiddish being spoken, in the Romema
area, not just Mea Shearim, and among little kids -- some were hasidic in
appearance, others modern orthodox". 

Throughout the northern areas of Jerusalem, especially through Gush 80,
Ezras Toyre, Unsdorf and Matersdorf, you will hear some Yiddish spoken. 
There is a fairly new Beys Yakov "Chasidi Yiddish" which uses Yiddish as its
main language of instruction and attracts girls from all these areas.

Subject: Il dibuk

In response to Shimen Kass's question (MENDELE, 09.032) concerning the opera
"Il dibuk," attached is one of two catalog records found in the RLIN Eureka
database, for the score of the opera based on Sh. An-ski's "Dybbuk": 

                Rocca, Lodovico, 1895-1986.
                [Dibuk. Vocal score]
                Il dibuk : leggenda drammatica / di Scialom An-Ski ;
                ridotta in un prologo e tre
                atti da Renato Simoni ; [musica per] Lodovico Rocca ;
                riduzione dell'autore
                per canto e pianoforte.
                Milano ; New York : Ricordi, c1934.
                1 vocal score ([14], 319 p.) : port. ; 27 cm.
                Simoni, Renato, 1876-1952.
                An-Ski, S., 1863-1920. Dibek.

The score is available at Indiana University Library (which cataloged it) 
and in about a dozen other research libraries in the U.S.  In addition,
among books in the YIVO Institute's Sutzkever-Kaczerginski collection there
is a copy of an Italian translation of An-ski's play, also published in
1934.  The Sutzkever-Kaczerginski collection contains books that were hidden
in the Vilna ghetto by Jewish forced laborers working under Nazi supervision
sorting books in the former Vilna YIVO building (outside the ghetto), circa
1942.  Perhaps they were struck by the fact that it had been possible for a
Yiddish play to be mounted (in translation) in Mussolini's Italy just a few
years earlier.
