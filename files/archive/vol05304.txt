Subject: Di Bundishe Shvue

Re Rick Kuhn's query (Vol. 5.301), _di bundishe shvue_ appears on a 1972
recording (Stereo JS 11049) issued by the Jewish Students' Bund. "_yidishe
lider fun arbet un kamf_/Yiddish Songs of Work and Struggle," featuring the
Yiddish Youth Ensemble, most of whom remain prominent in the field of Yiddish
music. I'd check with the Arbeter Ring bookstore and with the Bund Archive as
to current availability.

_di poyle-tsienistishe shvue_was recorded by Theodore Bickel, but I'm afraid I
can't cite the recording.

Subject: Tsu zayn oder nisht tsu zayn

I would be interested in knowing if the Yiddish translations used toward the
performance of Shakespeare are still in existence.  Also, is there any good
scholarship on the performance of Shakespeare by European Yiddish acting
troupes?

Subject: "Shleymele mayn kind"

I have a vague impression that in the long ago I heard a song starting with
the words _Shleymele mayn kind_, but do not have the vaguest idea as to the
remaining lines.

Any help with the text of the song, also the names of the author and composer,
will be deeply appreciated.

Subject: Of jails and prisons, horses and goats; rishes

Reb Zellig writes about "slang" words for "prison" in Yiddish and cites three,
in particular: _xad-ga'dye_, _ko'ze_, _khey'der_. The last of these is new to
me--the only variation I know on the meaning of the word _kheyder_ is in
Western Yiddish (Alsace) where it refers to the place where the horses were
kept. The Jewish school in Alsace is called _eygo'l_.

But we were talking about "slang" and "prison". I hope Zellig can agree to set
aside the word "slang" for lack of an appropriate definition. Perhaps he will
also agree to make a distinction between "prison" and "jail".

Ask a Yiddish speaker where _aresta'ntn_ were held, and he will likely tell
you that in the big city there was a _tfi'se_ or a _tu'rme_--unambiguously
'prison'--but that in his shtetl, _aresta'ntn_ were held in a . . . . any one
of a dozen or more terms for 'jail', perhaps 'lockup', or 'hoosegow'. Most of
these are regionally well-defined, local terms for 'jail', not "slang". (See
Atlas, Volume III, Map 120. Max Niemeyer Verlag, 1997!!)

So, in all but southeastern Central Yiddish, the word iz _koze_. Southeastern
Central Yiddish, along with the contiguous western part of Southeastern
Yiddish has _krimina'l_. Northeastern Yiddish and the adjoining eastern part
of Southeastern Yiddish is defined by _astro'g_. All of Western Yiddish says
_to:'fes_.

Shall I go on? There's _kitshn_, _vyenzhne_, _bergi'tkes_, _vakh_, are'st_,
_xaps_, and more.

In places where several terms cooccur, it seems that _astro'g_, _krimina'l_,
_ka'terge_, and _mureva'nke_ served to house the more serious offenders.

As for _khad-ga'dye_, it does appear to relate to _ko'ze_ which is 'goat' in
both Yiddish and Polish and, at least in Yiddish. 'jail'. Do we know for sure
that it doesn't mean 'jail' in (some regional form of) Polish too?

And, for good measure, a reference to the word _rishes_ which Zellig mentions
in his interpretation of the _khad-ga'dye_ song. As it happens, _rishes_ has
variant meanings in Eastern and Western Yiddish. Along with several other
words, it's generally considered criterial to the definition of the two major
dialect areas. In Eastern Yiddish, it means 'malice' (or 'meanness', as Zellig
suggests); in the West, it refers explicitally to 'antiSemitism'. A _ro:she_
is an antisemite, its feminine form, _reshante_.

Finis.

Subject: Prison

My father (a minkacher) uses the word 'dotye' for prison. It may be a
Hungarian word originally or a yidish word from that area.

The term used most often to say 'He's in prison' is 'er zitst' or 'er
yoyshevt'. The word for Prison is more likely to be 'tfise' rather than
'turme'.

As reb zeylig provided the paysekh connection to prison by mentioning 'khad
gadyo' I'll add something to it.

a yid hot amol bazikht a khaver in tfise of khol hamoyd paysekh. er freygt eym
viazoy der sayder iz geveyzen. entfert yener az er hot borikh hashem mekayyem

Subject: Slang terms for prison

I regret having to disagree with _fraynd_ Zellig Bach, from whom we have all
learned so much, but there is indeed a Slavic antecedent for the Yiddish use
of _koze_ to mean 'prison'.  One of my favorite examples of the subtlety of
Slavic influence on Yiddish is the expression _araynyashvenen in khad-gadye_
'to put in jail', which is built out of Germanic and Semitic elements, but
whose meaning arises from a component-by-component translation of Polish
_wsadzic' do kozy_.  Both phrases contain a verb built on the root meaning
'sit' or 'seat' with the prefix meaning 'into'. This is followed by a
preposition meaning 'to' or 'into'.  The Polish noun _koza_ 'goat' is a slang
term for 'jail', whence presumably Yiddish _koze_ and, more elaborately (or
more conspiratorially, since _koze_ would be recognizable to non-
Yiddish-speaking Poles), _khad-gadye_.  Perhaps the verb _araynyashvenen_,
with its Hebrew root, was also intended to be less transparent than the purely
Germanic _araynzetsn_.

Subject: Yok

I have heard that 'yok' is derived from Yorkshireman. To many, Yorkshiremans
epitomise the Englishman especially in their penchant for straight dealing
(beloshen sagenoher).
