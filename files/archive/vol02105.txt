Subject: RE: khalerya

according to a polish (non-jewish) former colleague,
kholyere is straight polish, where it literally means
'cholera' but is figuratively used as a curse (a very
strong one).

Subject: khalerye, hobm/khurbm

Gerald Phillips remembers the pronunciation *chaleria* (or
*khalerye*), which I`m sure means "cholera".  That's the
pronunciation I remember, too.  U. Weinreich's Dictionary,
though, gives *khoLyere* [where the Ly means the
palatalized l].  Eykh mir a verterbukh!

Benson Ginsburg notes that /khes-vov-reysh-beys-langer nun/
and /hey-komets alef-beys-langer nun/ both end in nun.  But
the pronunciations produced by my parents (from around
Vilna) were *khurbm* and *hobm*.  Indeed, anything like
*khurben* or *hoben* would have marked the speaker as
non-native, probably American.  But *khurbones* would have
been the plural of *khurbm*; and, conceivably, *hobenish*
might have appeared as a translation of the gerund
"having":  "Ma, I have a nickel, but I can't find it."
"Vos far a bobenish is dos?" or "Eykh (oykh) mir a
hobenish!" (What kind of "having" is that?)

Subject: RE: khurbm and hobm

I thank my friend Benson Ginsburg for his reply to my note
on khurbm and hobm. I would respectfully remind him that my
comment was prompted by one of our members who cited the
pronunciation khurbm in the first place and asked about
it!.(I've forgotten who it was.)He may have heard people
pronounce it or write it that way.I do not recall hearing
it myself, but I drew an analogy to hobm (=the infinitive
hobn), which I have indeed heard from at least a few native
speakers in relaxed conversation. I don't know what they
would do in reading a text aloud formally. (I am not, as
Comrade Benson knows, a native speaker.) It is perhaps also
interesting that at least one of the Yiddish teachers at
the Summer Session of the National Yiddish Book
Center, Reyzl,insists on hobm as the normal pronunciation in
Standard Yiddish. Given all this, I wanted to help our
member, who was distressed over the "unpronounceability" of
such a form, by giving a phonetic rationale.

Subject: RE: doggerel

Norman Zide inquires about Yiddish doggerel. There was, of
course, a rather droll English verse that preceded the "tsu
whom you speakin' tsu whom?"

Standing on a corner,
Minding her own business,
Tsadie Cohen was waiting for a tsrolley car.
Her arms vas full from packages,
Her mind it vas on bizzniss,
When along comes a bimbo in a Chevrolet coupeh.

Isn't it interesting that back then, Bimbo was a term
applied to a crude male rather than a crude female.

There were also "take offs" on the liturgy, like the
chorus...

In de Torah, ist geschrieven,
Mit ein shikse, du muss liegen,
Oh main...

There are dozens more of these.  We were midwestern and I
discovered they were different in small ways from the
chants used in Philadelphia and New York.
