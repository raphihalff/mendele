Re   'kitkes' etc.: Dissertation in progress on "Regional
variation in the occurrence and meaning of Yiddish food
terms associated with holidays". Will probably restrict
itself largely to baking, with special emphasis on "Sabbath
Bread" (NOT universally "khale", by the way). Author:
Elinor (Leah) Robinson, Columbia University.

Dave Sherman's query about how to refer to autumn
colors evoked a proposed solution which in turn evoked
old memories.  

In brief, my proposal is: oysgegrint.  It has the
distinct advantage of not being a translation from
English, said translations being almost always infelic-
itous.  

But while we're on the subject of oysgegrint, older
readers especially will remember when this was a taunt
that immigrants used on one another.  I recall vividly
how some landsman or visitor (himself barely arrived)
would sneeringly ask: "shoyn a bisl oysgegrint"?  To
which my mother would snap back: "Yo, shoyn pinktlikh
azoy geyl vi aykh!", or in a less feisty mood: "Afile
oysgegeylt!".  They never bothered her again on that
subject.

So why use the word for autumn?  Because happily or
alas we no longer have very many Yiddish-speaking
immigrants with whom we can adopt lofty attitudes
(farisene neyzer).  But it's a pretty word, it's Yid-
dish, and now its use even involves ironic overtones.

p.s. My (mostly) ladies at the local Hebrew Home vote for
ibergebitn.  I think they're right.

We were out for a drive in southern Ontario yesterday, and
wanted to point out the leaves turning (changing colour) to
the kids.  What's the right verb?

On Herzog's reply to Bob's 'demand' for proof and Aren's
later addition to the discussion:
 
Requiring (sic!) proof that there is no relationship is not
very reasonable. In fact we can't prove that ANY two
languages are NOT related.
____________________________________
 
Whereas Herzog's above statement is certainly true, an
alternative derivation such as Aren later provided would
certainly have gone a long way in satisfying Bob (I
believe).  Certainly, it would have satisfied me.
 
Also, when a non-linguist like Bob (I presume) or me
ventures a statement such as 'heirat < harey at'  I submit
that we should not be asked to produce proof; rather it
should be taken as a null hypothesis that then needs to be
refuted (in the manner that Aren refuted the harey at
hypothesis).
 
Finally, can even a positive statement such as Bob's
actually be proven? The best we can do, it seems to me is
to pile on the evidence as much as we can.

Since a number of subscribers have raised the question
of back numbers, I thought a note to the entire list
might be in order.

The easiest way (for the shames at least) is to make
all files available via anonymous ftp.  It may also be
the simplest procedure for subscribers as well.  Unfor-
tunately, the people who run the local show (firen or
praven di melikhe, as we say at home, is even closer to
describing the situation) don't know or pretend not to
know how ftp works.  As a result, ftp is out unless
someone on the list knows of an installation that would
be willing to play host to our files.  

The next best solution is for me to ship files by mail. 
Files are best sent in compressed _and_ encoded form. 
There are two options.  1) If the files are to be
stored on your pc, you will need two pieces of soft-
ware.  The first (UUDECODE.COM) decodes the compressed
file, the second (such as ARCE2.COM) decompresses it. 
2) If the files are to be stored on your mainframe, it
should have the equivalent software.  Check with your
local hommes-papier and hope for the best.

You say you haven't got UUDECODE.COM  or ARCE2.COM? 
Mendele has and will gladly send them to you as *.BAS
files.  You need only download them to your pc, then
use the BASIC software that came with your operating
system to convert the two files into *.COM files.

Finally, if none of the above are right for you, let me
know and we can try to work out an arrangement.
