Subject: Introduction

I am a Yiddish music historian with a specialty in klezmer music and
Yiddish-American popular and folk culture. In 1979 I founded the
"Kapelye" klezmer ensemble (still VERY active!) and then designed
and directed (until quite recently) the Max and Freida Weinstein
Archives of Recorded Sound at the YIVO Institute. In 1985 I founded
and continue to direct the Yiddish FolkArts Program ("KlezKamp") now
under its new aegis of"Living Traditions". Currently, I am
co-researching a National Public Radio documentary and book on the
history of Yiddish radio in America (1925-1955) and am host and
producer of the all-Yiddish radio show on New York's WEVD, The
Forward Hour.

Subject: cross-linguistic jokes

From Polish Jews living in Paris, I heard the following story:  Two
women, one French, the other a Polish Jew, are in a public restroom.
They both happen to approach the sink at the same time, to wash
their hands.  The Jewish woman yields to the French woman, saying,
"Vash!"  The French woman, insulted, replies "Qui?"  They both leave
in a huff, each thinking she has been called a cow by the other.

Subject: No Counting

Delphine Bechtel  asks about the  tradition not to count  people.
The Talmud  states that  matters  counted  have no  blessing  on
them  (en habrakha shruya al davar hamanui, as  far as I remember
the text).  It may be  based on the story  in Samuel II  24 about
the "sin"  of David that he ordered a counting of the Israelites and
the resulting plague.

There  are all  kind of  explanations  why counting  keeps away
God's blessings, but  anyhow it is  an old  tradition, actually more
than a minhag.

Subject: re: shmoolyaris

Anyone catch the automotive-interest radio show "Car Talk" this past
weekend?  The hosts made passing reference to "simolians,"
mentioning that the term comes from the Italian "semolino" (English
"semolina" - our best natural source of macaroni).  According to
their authority (I didn't catch who it was or what, though the hosts
also remarked that Damon Runyon did much to popularize "simolians"
as slang for dollars), semolina was a common barter item in Sicily
and other parts of Italy, and use of the term to denote money found
its way, with the great wave of Italian immigrants, to the lower
east side of NY at the end of the last century. No need to go over
what a hothouse of interethnic mingling that place was at that time.
So, to Mikhl Herzog (et al): What process(es) known to linguists
could transmute the Italianate "simolians" into the slang Yiddish
"shmoolyaris"? Is this link even possible?

A sidenote:  According to Klein's etymological dictionary (1971),
the Latin source for semolina ("simila") is a loan word from the
Semitic.  Meaning, we should welcome the derivation
"simolians/shmoolyaris" as a wandering kinsman, back, so to speak,
to the billfold.  Myself, I'm pulling for this derivation, even if
it isn't correct..

Dan Leeson and Moyshe-Yankl, respectively: Philologos has dealt with
both "Moyshe-Kopoye" and "Shimelekh" in his English Forward columns.
Does anyone know if Ph intends to publish a collection of his fine
essays in book form?

Subject: Legislating Neologisms

A colleague posted a note some time ago in which he described the
sinking, "here-we-go-again" feeling he gets when reading the
oh-so-earnest and apparently inevitable periodic postings on
_shmok/Schmuck_. I admit to similar feelings whenever MENDELE is
used to contemplate neologisms.

Neologisms survive by natural selection. Some--the wonderfully apt,
child-coined _shneykishn_, for example--enter the folksmoyl (!) by
acclamation; others--recent suggestions for e-mail, for
example--have yet to sort themselves out (my candidate: Neil Jacobs'
elegant _elpost_); most will simply fall, unmourned, by the wayside.

There are, nonetheless, a very few classes of neologism which I
would fain see legislated: fakhverter, perhaps, and words which
carry ideological weight. The eventual Yiddish word for gay
rightly--and exclusively--belongs, I would assert, to the yiddophone
community to whom it refers: I am content to speak as they bid me.

_Homoseksualist_ will, I suppose, have to steal off into the night,
tarnished by its English near-homophone. Before it takes its leave,
however, I'd point out that _homoseksualist_ is most definitely not
the ideological equivalent of the English _homosexual_. A
homoseksualist is an advocate of homoseksualizm, much as, say, a
tsienist is an advocate of tsienism, a bundist an advocate of
bundizm, etc. This makes of gender identity an ideological
commitment, rather than an ontological state. Whether this is the
aspect of gay identity the language should chose to valorize over
other aspects is not for me to say, but _homoseksualist_ is anything
but downputting: perhaps Yiddish could retain it in the sense of
"gay activist."

All this is by way of preamble to my next post, on a remarkable poem
which would appear to canonize _lezbianke_ for "lesbian."
