On the subject of nasality as represented by the letter
'ayin, I remember that as a student of Uriel Weinreich I
read on article by him on the subject, but I can't find the
reference without going to more trouble than I have the
time for. Ssurely Mikhl knows the paper. I would like to
add a phonetic note to the discussion. The nasality in the
relevant Yiddish dialects may appear not only as an
akveolar or vellar nasal consonant but also as a nasal
vowel. Thus a colleague on my campus always pronounces
/mayse/ 'story' with a nasalized diphthong.

I seem to remember reading somewhere that nasals in those
Indo-European languages that have them are derived from
Proto-Indo-European gutturals, which would represent a
similar process acting on the Hebrew `ayin in Yiddish.  I
think the nasalization of a Hebrew aleph and he in similar
environments is probably a formation by analogy with the
`ayin.  I have an older acquaintance who was born near
Lublin, Poland, who nasalizes at least his alephs in this
way.

Subject: Schwa endings

Ellen Prince writes:
 
for some reason which escapes me (but which i'm sure mikhl
herzog knows), a bunch of schwa endings become /i/ in
american (not just boston) yiddish--khali, bobi/bubi,
zeydi, i think suki (the thing you sit in on sukes), feygi
(the girl's name), maki (plague), pulki (especially for the
human thigh, for some reason--in my house at least, the
drumstick on a fowl was always pulke)...--but not shmate
(*shmati), tante (*tanti), tshatshke (*tshatshki) (but
maybe tsatski, meaning 'bimbo'?), tate (*tati), moyshe
(*moyshi), shikse (*shiksi)... what's the story, mikhl? (or
anyone else who knows!)
 
I observe that almost none of the words that undergo the
schwa > /i/ transformation have a xxxccv (c=consonant,
v=vowel) structure, whereas shikse and tshatshke do.
According to this rule, pulke shouldn't become pulki, but
don't l and r have quasi-vowel status? Also, shmate should
become shmati, by this rule.  So maybe a modified rule: If
the word is cvcschwa, it becomes cvci. Now that I read my
hypothesis, it occurs to me that I may have no degrees of
freedom left to test it!  (on the other hand, bobe, chmare,
late, kale, etc.) In any case, I don't understand why ellen
has an asterisk before moyshi and tati: I constantly hear
them pronounced thus.

Subject: Double negatives/positives

There's an old joke that in Yiddish the double positive --
"Yah, yah" -- is a negative (of course inflection is all).
However, as a friend pointed out to me in Yiddish there are
"double negatives" that do not mean a "positive," as would
be the case in English.  E.g."Ich hob nisht kein gelt" (a
refrain often heard). Is there a true double negative here?
If so, why doesn't the logical rule apply in Yiddish as it
does in English?  This is a minor conundrum for me, which
doesn't interfere with comprehension, yet I'd appreciate a
solution. Apropos of inflection, doesn't "Bubbi" also mean
something like "dear," or "sweet" -- which one's Bubbeh
often is, but is not often called?
