Subject: Zin/Zun

A personal and wholly unscholarly contribution on this issue:

My maternal grandmother would, in bursts of affection, squeeze me and call out
"mei' sheyne _zin_!"  Not in the plural, and filially slightly incorrect, as I
was her grandson.  I remember this very clearly; it happened many times.

Grandma was born and raised in Proskurov; she spent one year as a 17-year-old
working as an au pair for a well-off family in Poland.

Are we sure that the zun-zin homonym is only limited to one small district of
the Polish-Lithuanian border?

Subject: Prezhnitse

Stuart Noah asks [5.280] about "Prezj'nyet'seh" for fried matzo. While fried
matzo to me is matse bray (pronounced "braa"), I've heard prezhnitse used by
Shmuel Rudzhinski in a taped skit of Sholem Aleykhem's "Kasrilivke
restoranen": "Makht mir a prezhnitse fun a por eyer". I looked it up at the
time (no Weinreich handy at the moment) and found it was an omelet, or
scrambled eggs.

The skit is a riot to listen to, by the way.

Subject: Prezhnitse

pre'zhnitse (this is the way I know it; U. Weinreich's _Modern English-Yiddish
Yiddish-English Dictionary_ lists the form pre'zhenitse) is 'scrambled eggs'.
I've never heard of it being restricted to fried eggs with matse (i.e. what
most of the rest of us call matse-bray) -- that's curious.  Btw, cf. Mendele
archives for interesting discussion (perhaps some recipes too) of matse-bray.
I recall some interesting discussion of it a few years ago.

Subject: Tel-Aviv street named after Mortkhe Gebirtig

Today, the 13th of March 1996, at 11:30 A.M. at 4219 St. in Kfar Shalem, on
the fifty-third anniversary of the destruction of the Cracow ghetto, in the
presence of Mayor Ronnie Milo, a street in Tel-Aviv - Jaffa will be named
after Mortkhe Gebirtig, the Yiddish poet and composer (as advertised by the
Municipality of Tel-Aviv -Jaffa) on p. 13 of _Ha-Arets_ of 13.3.96).

Subject: "Az me git..."

Pinyeh Weichsel (5.277) asks about the addition of "men" to the end of this
saying.  I too found the lack of this word jarring and at odds with the
Yiddish I learned from both my central Polish and Galizyaner meshpokhe. Lo'mir
zogen azoy: Az me git, nemt men!

Subject: "A libe iz an umglik af der velt"

Is anyone acquainted with the song _a libe iz an umglik af der velt_?  I have
all the words and half the music, but I am missing the second half, and I
would like my Yiddish chorus to be able to sing it.  In the truncated copy I
have, it is listed as a folk song.  If anyone could tell me of a songbook in
which it appears, I would be very grateful.  A sheynem dank aykh.

Subject: CLusters and voicing

I have a follow-up question to my posting on syllable onsets and voicing.
Again, my concern here is NOT about varieties such as Northeastern Yiddish
which have anticipatory voicing assimilation when obstruents collide (e.g.,
NEY *ikh shik dir*  >  shi[g] [d]ir ).

In these non-NEY-like varieties, what happens to, say, the /g/ in *der
kligster* ?  In some material I'm working on, I am so far assuming that it
gets devoiced, based on the phonological cycle in which there is no
inflectional ending after the superlative marker, that is, /klig/ + /st/ -->
[klikst]. (Again, this is a cyclic approach, and ignores, at least here,
whether or not a "base superlative" occurs by itself.)  In such non-NEY
varieties of Yiddish, we normally wouldn't expect anticipatory voicing
assimilation in, say, *tog-seminar* to to[k s]eminar.  So, my question is
mostly about what linguists out there might have heard from native informants
in inflected superlatives, where the adjective base ends in an underlying
voiced obstruent, i.e., klig - ster  or  klik-ster ?  (Of course, a further
complication concerns the fact that some varieties are going to have a
voiceless [k] here due to a final-devoicing rule, anyway.  But there are some
varieties which, presumably, lack both anticipatory voicing and final
devoicing [SEY-types]).

Thanks in advance for any thoughts on this.
