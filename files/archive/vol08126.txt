Subject: Nouns and adjectives of nationality

The recent discussion of geographical adjectives has raised a problem that's
puzzled me for some time, namely, how to use nouns and adjectives of
nationality, especially when they occur in predicate position.  Just this
morning I noticed, in a Forverts article about the next king of Jordan, a
sentence beginning "Zayn froy iz a Palestiner, un dos ken ... " 

Since Weinreich gives "Amerikaner" and "Amerikanerin", I assume that the
form "Palestinerin" must also exist.  So why wasn't it used?  I know, of
course, that nouns and adjectives, when they occur in predicate position,
often obey special rules.  But is that what's going on here?  It seems to me
that there are at least two possibilities: 

1.  It's a mistake.  Any adjective of the "Amerikaner" type, when used in
predicate position, is treated as a noun, and therefore should be in its
feminine (noun) form, like "Amerikanerin". 

2.  You have a choice.  You may use either the noun "Palestinerin" or the
always uninflected adjective "Palestiner", even when the subject is a woman. 

I assume that the existence of other alternative forms, such as "daytshke" 
and "daytshish(e)", must be causing problems for other learners of Yiddish
as well, at least when it comes to predicate usage.  So, could one of the
grammarians on the list perhaps give us a lesson on this topic?

Subject: yoshke-pandre

In response to Gershon Friedlin (vol 8.123):

I assume that his "etymology" of Yoshke-pandre was meant in jest. Pandre
does not mean 'panther'. The Yiddish word for panther is: der panter, and
has become part of the Yiddish zoologic terminology only in the 20th Century
while yoshke-pandre is much older. 

Ber Borochov has called this kind of folk etymology disparagingly
"besmedresh- etimologye", but in this case it would be a misnomer.
Besmedresh-yidn hobn nisht geredt vegn keyn roymishe legyonern un nisht vegn
Yezuses mame. Oyb di kloymershte "etimologye" fun Yoshke-pandre iz gemeynt
vi a vits, iz es nisht keyn gerotener vits, gikher a Purim-etimologye,

Subject: Tumbalalaika

Re Itsik Goldenberg's request for additional lyrics to Tumbalalaika (8.113):

Here are lyrics which we also sing, in addition to the three usual verses. 
Some have slight variations of their own, indicated as alternatives in
parenthesis. 

Vos is hekher fun a hoyz
Un vos iz flinker fun a moyz
Roych (A koymen) iz hekher fun a hoyz
A katz iz flinker fun a moyz.

Vos iz teefer fun a kvahl
Un vos iz biterer vi gahl
A hartz (a moyekh) iz tifer fun a kvahl
Un toyt (libe, libe) iz biterer vi gahl.

(Now come North American  Zionist youth movement additions)

Ven ven ven ven, zingt a khalutz
Ven ven ven ven er iz in kibbutz
Er  arbet gantz shver
Vil er dokh esn
Zingt er a lid, er zol dos fargesn.

Ven ven ven ven, zingt a shomer
Ven ven ven ven er arbet gor shver
Ven er arbet gor shver, vil er dokh esn
Geyt er arayn in delekatessn.

Subject: olevesholom

My mother was talking to me about a dear, departed friend named Tamara. She
mentioned her name and then remarked, "olevesholom."

Why would my mother use the male "alav ha'shalom" rather than the more
appropriate "aleha ha'shalom?"

My mother is from Lodz. In her circle of Holocaust survivors from Poland, the
only blessing I've ever heard in conjunction with a deceased person has been
the male form. Is this common? I'd like to hear from the experts.

Lynda Kraar

[Moderator's note: James Matisoff in his "Blessings, Curses, Hopes, and
Fears" explains (p.54):

  ... oleho ha-sholoym ... is not easily pronounceable in Yiddish, where 
  the whole expression is treated as a single word with strong primary
  stress on the penult -sho-, so that the first few syllables get weak
  stress. This has led to haplology of the two successive -ho-/-ha-
  syllables, yielding olehasholem, or even olesholem. The phonological
  similarity between this feminine formula and the corresponding masculine
  one has led to a breakdown of the distinction for many speakers, so that
  olevasholem can be used indiscriminately for a dead man or woman.

Subject: Huldah and Bor - "Whence the weasel?"

Mikhl Herzog asks: "Whence the weasel?" in the story of Hulda and Bor since
he played it himself, and the animal was really a cat. Well, the weasel was
replaced by a cat in some of the variations of this story. For example, the
Persian version has a cat and not a weasel. I believe that the replacement
has to do with the relative difficulty of identification of the weasel
animal as compared with the simplicity of the known cat. For citations see
my post from in Mendele Vol 08.123.

Subject: khulda

Mikhl Herzog is correct in noting that Goldfadn's Shulamis and Avishalom
make their oath before a cat (kats) and a well.  In the original fable,
however, the oath is made before a well and a "khulda."  I believe that
"khulda"  is properly translated as a rat, but most English translations of
the Talmudic legend have rendered it a weasel.  It was for this reason that
I used the term weasel.  In fact, though, I think that Goldfadn was
right--it should be a wildcat, as a weasel is unlikely to eat a human child.

Subject: Rozhinkes mit mandlen

Regarding Rozhinkes mit mandlen, firstly, Avisholem does'nt sing it to
Shulamis, but to himself.  Regarding the lines of the railroads that will
engulf the earth, Goldfaden admitted that it was anachronistic to mention
such things in a Biblical play, however, he said, the audience liked it so
much, that he left it in. The quote appears in a footnote to the play.

Subject: tkhoyr

Thanks to Hugh Denman for his correct discussion of the etymology of
_tkhoyr_.  The facts are also socio-historically enlightening:  they
indicate that, just as today, their have been skunks among Jews since the
16th century, if not earlier.
