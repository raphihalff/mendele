Subject: Re: Chaim Zhitlovsky in translation

How exciting that Tao Yee Lau is writing a thesis on Dr. Zhitlovski! As a
13-year old student in the Secular Yiddish schools of the International
Workers Order, in 1943, I was chosen as an honor guard at Zhitlovski's
coffin which lay in state in New York's Manhattan Center while many
thousands filed past. I hope Tao's final work will become available via
Mendele.

There is useful material by and about Dr. Zhitlovski in:

Kogel, Renee and Katz, Zev, eds. Judaism in a Secular Age, Intl. Institute
for Secular Humanistic Judaism, 1995., pp. 90-95 (excerpts from his essays
"Death and Rebirth of Gods and Religion," "The National Poetic Rebirth of
the Jewish People").

Rosenfeld, Max, in Jewish Currents Reader, Jewish Currents, Inc. 1996,
"Zhitlovsky: Philosopher of Jewish Secularism (essay)."

Dawidowicz, Lucy S., ed. The Golden Tradition, Beacon Press, 1967, pp.
411-422, "The Jewish Factor in My Socialism" (essay by Zhitlovsky).

Leftwich, Joseph, comp. and trans., The Way We Think, A. S. Barnes & Co.,
1969. pp. 76-98, Zhitlovski essays: "Job-A Poem of Jewish Free Thought,"
"What Is Secular Jewish Culture?"

While I cannot undertake to translate all or most of the Yiddish essays
cited in Tao Yee Lau's post, I might be able to fit in one or two -- at
most -- if supplied with clear photocopies or pdfs of the text(s).

Subject: Re: kaprosh and other dances

The only thing I can offer in connection with the game/dance "kaprosh" is a
guess about the origin of the word : it probably comes from the Romanian
"caprus(h)", a diminutive of "capra", i. e. goat. (Is there a game/dance
you know of which might be called "tsigele" ?)

Subject: Textbooks

Might anyone know of a textbook for university students studying Yiddish
whose interest is in acquiring  reading knowledge for both scholarship and
literature.

Subject: megayer zayn

I once read in a German book about conversions to Judaism that communities
who were willing to accept a wish to convert, or more precisely this
willingness, was referred to as "megijer sein". Is this a Western Yiddish
expression? And is it still used in Yiddish today? I also heard that
convert to Judaism in Yiddish means "zikh megayer zayn". Is this correct?

One often hears this "zikh ... zayn" structure in religious contexts. Why
is that so? How did this structure develop? I'd be grateful for any
answers.

Subject: Julian Tuwim

Do any Mendelayners know if Julian Tuwim translated his own work into
Yiddish? I have a copy of his poem "Lokomotywa" in the original Polish,
with a Hebrew translation that appears to be his (no one else is credited),
and Yiddish as well, with a secondary translator. I know he was
ideologically opposed to using Yiddish, but he probably knew the language.
Can anyone point me in the right direction?
