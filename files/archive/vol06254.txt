Subject: Haya Elbaum Dorembus

In Memory of Writer Haya Elbaum Dorembus
On The Yiddish Voice, WUNR 1600 AM, Weds., March 5, 1997

Boston's Yiddish-language radio program, The Yiddish Voice (WUNR-AM,
1600 in Brookline, MA), will dedicate its upcoming (March 5, 1997)
program to the memory of Chaya Elbaum Dorembus upon the occasion of 30
days after her death.  Mrs. Dorembus began her writing career in
Warsaw in the 1930's.  She survived life in the Warsaw Ghetto for
three years, and then escaped the Ghetto's final liquidation by
escaping to the "Arian Side" and hiding with non-Jews.  She
immortalized this period in her book, "Af der Arisher Zayt" ("On the
Arian Side"), published in Israel, where she lived after the war.
Excerpts from this book recently appeared, in English translation, in
Moment Magazine.  In recent years, she lived with her daughter in
Boston.  She continued to write almost until the end, contributing
nonfiction and fiction prose as well as poetry to the Yiddish Forward,
as well as to the Letste Nayes in Israel and other newspapers.  She
recited from her original poetry for a broadcast of The Yiddish Voice
in 1995. This broadcast will feature that poetry, as well as excerpts
from an interview that was originally aired on The Yiddish Hour (WBRS,
Waltham, MA) in 1993.  In addition, Zalmen Srebro, chairman of the
Yiddish Culture Club in Boston, will deliver a eulogy and appreciation
of her work.

The Yiddish Voice is a weekly Yiddish-language radio show in Boston
that features music, poetry, comedy, interviews, news, commentary, and
announcements of current events.

Subject: Hebrew words in Yiddish

a. joseph ross claims (6.252) that french words in english retain
their french spelling. perhaps he is thinking of the handful of
*recent* borrowings (lingerie, liaison, memoire, etc), but surely not
of the 40% of the english vocabulary that came in from french at
around the time that the vast majority of semitic borrowings came into
yiddish -- if not later. in fact, they are so well integrated into
english spelling conventions that you probably have no idea that
they're from french, so here's just a baker's dozen (from french
_douzaine_) that come to mind:

	english			french
	_______			______

	beef			boeuf
	cherry			cerise
	chestnut		chastaigne (old french)
	flower			fleur
	laundress		lavandiere (old french) + -esse
	mountain		montagne
	mutton			mouton
	palace			palais
	pawn			pan ('hock'); pion ('chess-piece')
	perfume			parfum
	valley			vallee
	very			vrai
	vine			vigne

isn't it lucky for us english speakers that no one endows french spelling
with divine inspiration?

Subject: Tsadik

I don't know how old the phrase 'tsadik in pelts' is, but M. Weinreich
states that it's a pun, meaning: 'he's as much a tsadik, as the final
letter in pelts (in other words, not a righteous person at all)'.
Somewhat like: er vaizt mir a hay  - in sider (in answer to someone
requesting hay for his horse - and is shown the letter hay in a
siddur). For the pun to have become entrenched in the language, I
would asume that it's been there for 150 years at least. A logical
assumption?

Subject: Ivan Franko (was: Place names)

Bob Rothstein pointed out [6.249] that Ukrainian writer Ivan Franko
"was a friend and supporter of Yiddish literature".

Indeed, Franko, who apparently was fluent in Yiddish, translated
Yiddish poetry (including also M. Rosenfeld and V. Erenkrants), wrote a
famous lyrical cycle "Zhydivski melodii" (Jewish Melodies), and
devoted a significant part of his publicistic efforts to various
Jewish problems.

However, it would be unfair to forget that Franko's major prose - a
series of two novels "The Boa Constrictor" and "Borislav is Laughing"
- is one of the most viciously antisemitic works in the Ukrainian
literature. In both novels the author describes the family of Herman
Goldkremer, a poor weaver who rises into a powerful oil magnate. Even
official Soviet Ukrainian critic feels somewhat uncomfortable
discussing certain aspects of the novel (that was in general highly
praised and studied in schools): "Herman's wife Rifka, and his son
Gottlieb are transformed into parasitical monsters. In the description
of Rifka and Gottlieb, it is not the social aspect that prevails, but
the biological motivation of their conduct. This seems a bit
far-fetched and, besides, their [mental and moral] deterioration takes
place too fast - within a single generation" (P. Kolesnyk, Ivan
Franko. Kiev, 1977). I remember a joke that was popular among some of
my classmates in the Ukrainian Literature class: Q. What is Ivan
Franko's major literary innovation? A. In the Ukrainian literature
before Franko all Jewish characters were exploiters, in Franko's works
all the exploiters are Jews. As some other jokes, this one contains a
good deal of truth.

So, what was the real face of the "great Ukrainian writer"? Probably,
the answer can be found in the political situation in Eastern Galicia
in the late XIX - early XX c.  Like in other parts of Austro-Hungary,
the political arena was divided along the ethnic lines. Major (and
polar) forces were Ukranians and Poles, but Jews, who constituted in
1910 13% of the population, often served as a swing vote. Since most
of the Jews did not have strong allegiances to either side and had
difficulties in deciding which of the evils is lesser, both parties
fought for Jewish votes.  Franko was a prominent political figure and
may be his literary works sometimes pragmatically reflected his
current political goals. Or in his own words: "Ukrainian radicals are
not antisemites.  We are not enemies of the Jews, just because they
are Jews... We are enemies of Jewish financiers, millioners,
speculators, and traders".

So familiar motif... Such a precarious friend and supporter...
