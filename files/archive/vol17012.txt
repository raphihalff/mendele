Is there any one who knows precisely which years Kadya Molodowsky wrote for

Subject: farshteler

I am an artist and film-maker from NY but living in Berlin, and am writing
because I am looking for the meaning of a Yiddish word (farshteler) which
probably is no longer in use, as it relates to a phenomenon of early 20th
century film.  My mother speaks Yiddish but was not familiar with this
word, and I wonder if any of the list members of Mendele might be able to
help me. Below is the context in which I found this word, from a book
called Kafka geht ins Kino from 1996.  I am wondering if any Yiddish
speakers and/or scholars would be able to confirm the meaning or usage of
this term. Any help or information about whereIi might inquire with such a
question would be greatly appreciated.

Best wishes,
Anita Di Bianco

Zu den seit 1896 weit verbreiteten ambulanten Kinovorf^(n)hrungen in
Prag und
B=F7hmen gesellte sich 1907 das erste st?ndige Kino im Haus 'Zum Blauen
Hecht' (U modr? stiky) in der Karlsgasse 180.  Es wurde geleitet von Viktor
Ponrepo, der zusammen mit seinem Bruder mit phantasievollen Postkarten
f^(n)r
seine Vorstellungen warb.  Versprochen wurden den Besuchern 'Bilder aus dem
Leben und der Welt des Traums', die zu nichts weniger angetan seien, als
'alle Bed^(n)rfnisse des Zuschauers zu befriedigen'.  Den Pragern blieb
dieses
kleine Kino vor allem dadurch in Erinnerung, da? die beiden Ponrepo
zwischen den Filmen Zauberk^(n)nste darboten und w?hrend der Filme als
routinierte 'Erkl?rer' oder 'Rezitatoren' auftraten.  Sie waren
Schauspieler des Schauspiels, das auf der Leinwand zu sehen war.  Sie
waren, wie es im Jiddischen hei?t, 'Versteller'. The widespread ambulatory
film showings that took place in Prague beginning in 1896 were joined in
1907 by the first permanent cinema, located in the house known as the Blue
Pike (U Modr? Stiky) located at Karlsgasse 180.  It was run by Viktor
Ponrepo, who together with his brother advertised the performances on
fanciful postcards. They promised their visitors "scenes from life and the
world of dreams" that were capable of nothing less than "satisfying all the
spectator's needs." What made this movie house memorable for the citizens
of Prague was, above all, the fact that the two Ponrepos put on magic shows
between film showings and accompanied the films as practiced "explainers"
or "reciters."  The Ponrepos were participants in the action that was shown
on the screen. The Yiddish term for them is Versteller - a word that plays
on both the German verstellen, to distort or disguise, and vorstellen, to
imagine or present. Text: Hanns Zischler, Kafka geht ins Kino/ Kafka Goes
to the Movies, 1996 Anita Di Bianco

Subject: krasny bilet

I can't find any of the recent posts about the term "krasny bilet" (red
ticket) in the Mendele archive so I can't say for sure whether a definitive
definition of it has been posted yet, but yesterday I came  across this in
Abraham Cahan's "Yekl":

"As the only son of aged parents he had been exempt from the duty of
bearing arms. Jake may have forgotten it, but his mother still frequently
recurs to the day when he came rushing home, panting for breath, with the
'red certificate' assuring his immunity in his hand.  She nearly fainted
for happiness."

Subject: krasny bilet

In Ukraine, about ten years ago, I was told that Jewish communists often
spoke about "a royter bikhl" or a "royter bilet," little red book or red
ticket, meaning their Communist Party document. My hunch is that is what is
being spoken about in the original context.

Subject: "The Menhunters"

Has anyone ever heard about a Yiddish play called "The Men Hunter" or" The
Manhunters"? Can anyone tell me what this play is about and who wrote it?

Many thanks for any clue,

Subject: Max Reinhardt's stage

I'm researching the history of Jewish theatre in Berlin. For now, my
interest is in Max Reinhardt's performance of the Merchant of Venice in
1905. I know that he invented a revolving stage for this new production of
Shakespeare's famous play, with a disc revolving at the center of a round
stage. I've learned that "Max Reinhardt's stage measured 20 square meters
and had a revolving disc at the centre, with a diameter of 18 meters," but
physically that is impossible. Is it that the disc was larger than the
base? Or, maybe it is an error of the translator to say "20 square meters,"
when it was really "20 meters on each side of the square"? Does anyone know
the truth, or has anyone seen that stage? Please help me answer this
question.

Thanks a lot in advance,

Anne-Marie Du Ch?tel

Subject: Yiddish word for "can"

Is there an official Yiddish word for "can" (as in a can of  vegetables)?
I was given the word "blekh" by someone who said his mother used that word.

Subject: Itsik Kipnis' "Untervegns"

I would like to know the date of composition of Itsik Kipnis' novel
"Untervegns," published together with Di shtub in Tel Aviv in 1977.
Unfortunately, the Lexicon of Yiddish Literature does not provide this
information. Web sources, which are often unreliable, give conflicting
dates: some say Kipnis wrote this work before his imprisonment in 1948, and
some say after. The work is set during the Russian Civil War, but when was
it written?

Thank you,
Harriet Murav

Hymne du Bund
La Shvue (Le Serment)

Paroles de Sh. An-Ski

Freres et soeurs de travail et de misere
Tous ceux qui sont disponibles disperses
Ensemble, ensemble, le drapeau est brandi
Il claque de colore, il rouge de sang
Faisons un serment, un serment ? la vie et ? la mort!

Refrain

Le ciel et la terre nous entendront
Notre temoin - l'etoile claire
Un serment, un serment de sang et de larmes
Nous jurons!  Nous jurons!  Nous jurons!

Nous jurons de lutter pour la liberte et nos droits
Contre tous les tyrans et leurs laquais
Nous jurons de vaincre les forces obscures
Ou de tomber en heros dans la bataille
Faisons le serment, un serment ? la vie et ? la mort

Refrain

Nous jurons de garder notre haine intacte
Envers les assassins et les voleurs de la classe ouvriere
Le tsar, les ma?tres, les capitalistes
Nous jurons de les aneantir et de les detruire
Faisons le serment, un serment ? la vie et ? la mort!

Refrain

Nous jurons de mener la lutte sacre
Jusqu'? ce que le monde soit transforme
Plus de pauvres, de riches, de ma?tres ni d'esclaves!
Que tous deviennent egaux - les forts et les faibles!
Faisons le serment, un serment ? la vie et ? la mort!

Refrain

Nous jurons fidelite sans bornes au Bund
Lui seul peut maintenant liberer les esclaves
Son drapeau rouge est largement deploye
Nous jurons fidelite, ? la vie et ? la mort
Faisons le serment, un serment ? la vie et ? la mort

Refrain

Le ciel et la terre . . .
