Subject: phonetics of Telser

Responding to question, why the Telsher spells themselves that way
instead of Telzer.  I assume they are trying to represent the Lith
phoneme 'zh', which in Lith spelling is 'z' with a hachek on it.  Lacking
the 'zh' convention, which is still mostly learned in English usage, they
have to chose between 'z' and 'sh'.  Maybe they settle for the palatal
fricative rather than showing the voicing because they don't want people
to think they belong to the 'sabs-losn' dialect, which was stigmatized
and was gradually disappearing after 1900.

Subject: choop

Jay Fleisher's memory of Brooklyn rabbinical concern with "choops"
growing on the front of yeshiva bokhers' heads is doubtless also of
Polish origin, just as the earlier-mentioned "zhibe" from "grzywa."  In
this case the word is "czupryna" [tshuprina] and now we're really close
to what I mentioned some days ago in jest: the 50's Brooklyn
"ramalamadingdong" that hung down the forehead of guys known as "rocks,"
whose allure was that they were about as far from a yeshiva bokher as it
was possible to get.  So that choop/czupryna tracks the invasion of
grease into Brooklyn yeshivas. My own JHS 234 in the late 1950's boasted
the perfect example: the notorious Nat Schulman, a rabbi's son who hung
with Italian "rocks," and  acted like he was Kookie from 77 Sunset Strip.
Given how things work nowadays, I wouldn't be that surprised to have him
step out of some corner of the Internet...

My memory played me wrong: the rabbi's son was named Nat Schind; his best
buddy, in case anyone's interested, was a rock she-be-rockim named Johnny
Tutino (the comb never left his hand).

Subject: Choop/forehead curl

In response to Jay Fleischer's puzzlement over choop...may I suggest that
this is a shrotened version of chupchik.. a Russian word for a forehead
curl, and thus related to the Yiddish word for mane.  In one rcord of
Theorore Bikel he sings a song called CHoopchik, about a handsome young
lad with such a forehead curl.

Subject: Medical text in Yiddish

If there is anyone out there who is familiar with any books/texts, etc.
on medicine/folk remedies, etc. IN YIDDISH, from the 18th century onward,
the information will be appreciated.

Subject: More on Yiddish movies

I recently discussed on Mendele my reactions to Mirele Efros, which I
enjoyed tremendously. I bought that and The Dybbuk both from Ergo Media.
One of the movies they previewed, which I saw years ago was The Light
Ahead (Fishke der Krumer) with Helen Beverly and David Opatoshu, filmed
on location in Poland in 1939. The juxtaposition of the subject matter of
the film with the date and place of its creation disturbed me deeply. The
focus is on a very backward shtetl, where two orphans, one lame and one
blind, are married off by the shtetl to avert bad luck. In the end the
two decide to leave the shtetl, and on their way they are greeted by a
wonderful old man who tells them that they are leaving this superstitious,
backward shtetl to enter a world based on tolerance, and on rational
principles. In the final spectacular scene they look up to a hill flooded
with light, and the old man bids them farewell, to go up over the hill
toward "the light ahead".

The disturbing fact was that 1939 was the year when Jews started getting
rounded up for extermination. What tolerance is this? In whose eyes is
this a world based on rational principles? That's what struck me like a
blow to the head when I saw this movie. The optimism of the movie was
beautiful, and who knew just how low the world was about to sink? I know
this may sound cliche'd, but it really blew me away at the time, and it
did again the other night.
