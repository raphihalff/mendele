sheynem vs. groysn sure looks like dissimilation to me.

Subject: Book Peddlar

Dear Noyekh, A friend dropped off a copy of the magazine of
the National Yiddish Book Center, BOOK PEDDLER.  Did you
ever mention this on Mendele? The issue I have is Summer,
1992/5752 Number 17.  It's got lots of good stuff in it,
funny stories, poetry, news, scholarly articles, among
other things.  Mendele readers should be alerted to this if
they aren't already. In this issue there's a lexicon of
Yiddish names for zoo animals -- fascinating.

Since I've only recently become interested in Yiddish as
more than a particularly juicy collection of curses and
sighs, I was excited to learn that there is a Yiddish
translation of the Old Testament available by Yehoash.  I'm
sure you knew this, but do all Mendelnikim know this?  This
is available in 4 different editions, all translated by
Yehoash:  Tanakh, 8 vols., NY, 1926/36, Yiddish text only
$64/$48 per set. (Cat #6340); Tanakh, 2 vols., NY, 1938/39,
Yiddish text only, $18/$13.50 per set (Cat. #6355); Tanakh,
2 vols., various printing dates, 1941ff, Hebrew/Yiddish,
$25/$18.75 per set (Cat #1191) The two prices represent,
first, the standard price, second the price to members of
the National Yiddish Book Center. When ordering, include
postage and handling: U.S. and Canada: 1st vol. $2.25,
additional vols. $.55.  Make check payable to national Book
Center P.O. Box 969 Amherst, MA 01004.

Hershel

[Not to mention thousands of other titles.  I'm practically
certain that everyone who reads Mendele is already a member
of the NYBC, but just in case.. nm]

Subject: Yiddish Day

Answering to the important questions aroused by Dan
Breslauer in relation to the Yiddish Day at the Knesset, I
would say that this event that will take place the 4th of
J A N U A R Y 1993, is  a big achievement.

Now , more specifically. The official position of the
Zionist Movement and the State of Israel towards Yiddis
Culture did not change at all. It is negative as it allways
was. But here and there we are witnessing some hints that
things can change in a desirable direction.

Answering to the second question. Official linguists are
still worring about corruption from Ashkenazic influence,
and this is the main problem. In the future I will write
more extensively about it. In any case, our cooperation and
ideologic understanding with iddishists from abroad can be
crucial in order to change official positions in Israel and
ultimately also in Jewish Communities over the world.

The Hemsheck Dor Kybhobers fun Yiddish is the central
organization that tries to debate this and other themes
concerning the Yiddish Revival.

Subject: phila. inquirer, sunday, dec. 20

the magazine section in today's philadelphia inquirer has a
long article on molly and bob freedman, a wonderful couple
that some of you know, who happen to have what may well be
the largest private collection of yiddish music (records,
tapes, cds) in the world. and the article is not bad at
all, with only a few sillinesses (above average for an
article pertaining to yiddish, imho).

Subject: -e -ey and -ay

For Mikhl H:

1. I have no objection (especially since you're so polite
about it !)

2. It has been worth spelling it this way just to have your
useful summary. Although I am generally familiar with what
you said, I probably could not have set it out so neatly. I
suppose my original choice of spelling reflects (a) I have
recently become apprised of the "official" transliteration
(b) 'ey' looks odd in English anyway and gives little clue
to the uninitiated (c) many people here (in England)
trnsliterate using Germanised spelling with "ei" which
causes the same problem - German and Central Polish
speakers pronounce it the way you pronounce "ay". I hope
this makes some sense.
