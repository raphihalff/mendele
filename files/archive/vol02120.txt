Subject: Goy, sheygetz, etc.

To Ellen Prince, et ux:

If the term hurts, it must be pejorative.  I agree with
Paul Weixsel (even tho I have probably not spelled his name
correctly!)  I note an excerpt from a local synagogue
bulletin, quoting the "Bulletin" of Congr. Agudas Israel in
Saskatoon, a piece written by a female convert to Judaism.
After noting and acknowledging her acceptance by most Jews,
she says: What I do not appreciate and do not understand
are overtures of acceptance of Jews by choice that lack
integrity.  I don't like to be told, on the one hand, that
I am as accepted in the Jewish community as any other
member and then, on the other hand, to hear the same person
make unnecessary remarks comparing a "real " Jew and a
convert.  ___I find words like "goyim" and "shiksa" in the
context in which I have heard them as offensive as the word
" "Jew" when used as a verb.  I have family and friends who
are gentiles."

Noting, for you Ellen, how much controversy this subject
has invited on Mendele, and the comparison with the
controversy over use of the word "Jew" unmodified on the
Linguist List, I think pejorative is as much perception as
it is production.

Subject: oi/u/i vowel shift

Mikhl (?pronounced Mekhl) Herzog suggests a double vowel
 shift bsoiro -> psure -> psire. Another example is the
 mesechta of gmore called yoma in Hebrew and yume/yeeme in
 Yiddish.

Might it not be more easily explained by observing that the
Hebrew spelling -- beys, seen, vov, reysh, hey --
automatically invites the yiddish pronunciation psure/psire?

Subject: Sneezing and an introduction

It's difficult to imagine why sneezes seem to go
uncommented-on here in the midwest unless you consider the
fact that the region (especially Kansas and Missouri and
Nebraska) was "host" to a rather large influx of German
immigrants in the 1800s.  For a time there were
German-speaking churches and schools and German newspapers.
All of this changed rather dramatically after the turn of
the century in response to Nativist initiatives (such as
the "English-only" laws in Nebraska (1911, I think) and of
course the anti-German sentiment associated with WWI and
WWII.  Most German Americans in the region went out of
their way to assimilate and I would imagine that giving up
such German-sounding words as "gesundheit" would have been
an element of this effort.  Of course this doesn't explain
why there was no substitution of English equivalents, but
it's a start.

By the way, I was at a meeting the other night and someone
sneezed and I said "Bless you" (figuring noone would
appreciate tsu gezunt) and everyone looked at ME!  Oh,
well.  Gotta test the situation every so often.

Oh, yes.  I never introduced myself.  I'm here at Kansas
State University (have been for 22 years) teaching
Anthropology and (for the past five years) directing an
interdisciplinary American Ethnic Studies Program.  I grew
up in Brooklyn and although I was one of those "good kids"
who never learned Yiddish because it was my parents'
"secret" language, I know some of the more commonly used
words and phrases.  I still sometimes feel like an "other"
here in the midwest and I find reading Mendele quite
comforting.

Subject: Re: tsatske

I am reminded of a minor scandal in one of Israel's recent
elections, 1981 I think.  A famous [Ashkenazi] comedian
here, at a large election rally for Labor held in Tel Aviv,
referred to the supporters of Likud as tshak-tshakim.  This
slang expression implies non-intellectuality, vulgarity and
bad taste.  It was immediately taken up as a rallying cry
by Likud supporters and may have been a factor in their
victory.

I wonder if the expression is derived from the Yiddish
tsatske.

Subject: Tsatskes/tchatchkes

Since I'm not a linguist but plenty of Mendele's readers
are, I hope that there is enough in what follows to merit
the attention of those who know something.

"Tsatske" (which appears to be the same as the Polish
"cacko") is defined by Harkavy and Weinreich as a trinket,
bauble, plaything, toy. As for "tchatchke", Harkavy simply
treats it as a variant spelling of "tsatske" and Weinreich
lists it but treats it as having the same meaning.

Thus it would seem that whatever differences the two words
may now have are of fairly recent origin.  Maybe American?

Is it possible that "tchatchke" was once simply the result of
American difficulty in pronouncing the initial ts?

If that fails I have another theory.

In the 1930's my mother gave up going to the Yiddish
theatre in favor of the movies. The major reason was I
think that the movie houses gave out dishes. So, whereas in
the theatre days she would come home with reviews that
ranged from "shmate" through "als heyst a shmate" to
"shmate sh'b'shmate", her movie reviews ranged from "a
groys teler" (pretty good film), through a "tchoshke"
(so-so) to "a kleyn telerl" (terrible).

But what's a "tchoshke"?  It's Russian for cup and is used
by some but not all Yiddish-speakers.  Weinreich that
Litvak doesn't even list "tchoshke" but gives "shelekhl"
instead.

[To confound the confusion, those who say "tchoshke" use
"sholekhl" to mean _saucer_.  And where one places a
"shelekhl" on a "tetsl", "tchoshke" users think that a
"tetsl" is a tray.  Gevald, Mikhl, roteve!]

[You want even more confusion?  Would you believe that the
Polish word for saucer is..spodek?  So if I were to suggest
a connection with Spode you have even more reason to groan
that Noyekh dreyt (oder dilt) a spodek.]

Back to business.  Is it possible that those for whom
"tchoshke" was an unfamiliar word might have altered its
pronunciation and given it new meaning?

Noyekh
