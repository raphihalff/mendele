Subject: geveyn un geveyzn

What is the difference (if any) between "geveyn" and
"geveyzn"?  As far as I know, both are the past tense of
the verb "zayn" (to be), as in "ikh bin geveyn eyn aleyn"
(I was all alone) or "ikh bin dortn geveyzn" (I was there).

I believe Weinreich has them as alternative forms, but my
grandmother used them both.  I think she used the longer
"geveyzn" at the end of a long sentence, perhaps for
emphasis: "ikh bin dortn in varshe tsvey vokhn geveyzn" (I
was in Warsaw for two weeks), while the shorter "geveyn"
was used immediately after the helper verb:  "ikh bin
geveyn in hospital" (I was in the hospital).

ok, melekh, vendryes said it more elegantly than i did, but
the gist is the same--one pulls apart some word and notes
that its PARTS sound like (or, sometimes, are spelled like)
some other words and then concludes that the original word
is made up of those (smaller) words. the larger (i.e.
original) word would be the ARBITRARY part but breaking it
down into smaller, known parts makes it NONARBITRARY. (of
course, the smaller parts are themselves arbitrary--a
sparrow is called a sparrow for arbitrary reasons and the
same for grass--but sparrowgrass is nonarbitrary.)
(asparagus, of course, is arbitrary.)

(minor point--it's raimo--he's finnish, not hispanic.) ok,
same thing--except 'unfamiliar' is not a good term--he
means 'arbitrary'. and then you'll see that dreydl, while
familiar, was arbitrary--unanalyzable--until it was recast
as di reydl. ok?

here's another example that may help clarify it. the melted
cheese dish 'welsh rabbit' was folk-etymologized (by some
very literate folk) into 'welsh rarebit', since they
couldn't figure out what it had to do with
'rabbit'--'rabbit', tho familiar enough, was totally
unmotivated as a name for melted cheese and hence
arbitrary. 'rarebit' somehow made sense. now, it was in
fact 'rabbit'--apparently (or so the story goes), if welsh
hunters came home empty-handed (without some nice juicy
rabbits), their wives would make a meal of melted cheese
and call it welsh rabbit. so you see, folk etymology
involves reanalyzing some apparently arbitrary/unmotivated
string of sounds into one that 'makes sense'.

back to yiddish--my father had a wonderful folk etymology
for 'nebekh'--he insisted it was an acronym for 'nisht bay
aykh gedakht'. i kid you not.

Dave:   re ober . . . ober--I'd have to check to be sure,
but offhand, its use as 'either . . . or' is probably
Southeastern anyway. I'll check it out in due course. In
any event, "ober" continues to mean 'but'.
 
Bob Berk: I've discovered the article I mentioned to you:
"Pasta", The Atlantic Monthly, Jul;y 1986: "Other Arabic
sources of the time [the 10th century], refer to fresh
noodles as 'laksha', a Persian word that was the basis for
words in Russian, Hungarian, and Yiddish." The author,
Corby Kummer. Quote him, not me. Anyone, test your teeth on
1) the etymology of 'gra(y)zn' 2) the origin of the phrase
'noyekh mit zibn gra(y)zn'. Happy New Year
