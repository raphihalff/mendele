The (English) Forward's pseudonymous language meyvn, Philologos, has
lately attempted an etymology of "the Yiddish and Israeli slang word
frenk in the sense of a Sephardic or eastern Jew."  In the August 25th
issue he reports about a letter received from Dr. Perry Brickman, of
Chattanooga, Tenn., who writes:

        My wife was born in Atlanta, where her Polish-born parents
        settled and spoke a southern Polish Yiddish to her.  To this day,
        whenever she sees someone who looks different or old-fashioned,
        she calls that individual an alt-frenkisher mentsh (i.e., 'an old
        frenkish person'). ...  I asked her 93-year-old mother the
        derivation of the term and she said that it was just a phrase she
        had heard in Zamosc, where she grew up.  There didn't seem to be
        a Sephardic relationship, but based on your research, it probably
        did originate from the 'Sephardic Other.'

Philologos begins his response to Dr. Brickman as follows:

        I have never heard the expression an alt frenkisher mentsh and
        wonder if any of you have.  Presumably, as Dr. Brickman implies,
        the explanation for it is that Sephardic Jews from the Ottoman
        Empire traveling in Eastern Europe, especially if they were
        dressed in Turkish fashion, would have struck Yiddish speakers as
        strange and even antique, so that in some regional varieties of
        Yiddish the adjective frenkish eventually lost its meaning of
        'Sephardic' and came to have the sense of 'outlandish.'"

As a non-native speaker and reader of Yiddish, I can attest that I have
come across the expression "alt-frenkish" frequently in my reading of
Yiddish literature.  I suspect that many of our Mendelyaner khevre can
say the same.  And it surprises me that Philologos has apparently not
bothered to consult the standard Yiddish dictionaries, where the words
"frenk" and "alt-frenkish" (if not their etymologies) are indeed present.

"Frenk" is found on page 279 of Alexander Harkavy's Yiddish-English
Dictionary (copyright 1898), where it is defined as "Spanish Jew (in
Turkey)."  In the same dictionary, "frenkish" is defined as "of the
Spanish Jews; old-fashioned."  On page 62, there is a cross- reference
from "alt-frenkish" to "alt-modish," which is defined simply as
"old-fashioned."  These words and definitions are repeated (with some
minor nuances) in Harkavy's Yiddish-English-Hebrew Dictionary (1928),
which was reprinted by Schocken and YIVO in 1988 and is still in print.
Uriel Weinreich's Modern English-Yiddish, Yiddish-English Dictionary does
not include "frenk" or "frenkish," but its definition of "altfrenkish"
(page 746) is "old-fashioned, quaint."

"Altfrenkish" is indexed in Nahum Stutchkoff's Thesaurus of the Yiddish
Language (Der oytser fun der yidisher shprakh) in two places:  Section 75
(Fargangenheyt, Altkeyt), where it appears as an adjective (page 56),
between "altmodish" and "altshteygerish," and Section 369 (Shprakh),
where it appears -- again as an adjective (page 350) -- in a sequence
that reads as follows:

"dyalektish, idyomatish, mundartlekh, arkhaish, zeltn, koydrish,
oysterlish, opgelebt, altfrenkish."

From the foregoing it is apparent that the pedigree of "frenk,"
"frenkish," and "altfrenkish" is reasonably venerable in Yiddish; serious
research (as opposed to checking a couple of dictionaries) would probably
shed more light on these words' history and usage. Perhaps some of our
Mendelnikes might care to put in their own two cents' worth.
