Subject: finger in fist

If I remember correctly, this gesture, called `a fayg' in Yiddish, is used to
express simple defiance, etc., like the middle finger in mainstream America, 
and does not necessarily have a superstitious association.

Subject: the protagonists in Sholem-Aleykhem's "Dos porfolk" 

As Thanksgiving approaches, the turkey controversy gets hotter.  As chief
inciter of the fray, I want to express my agreement with _both_ sides.

The Yiddish text suggests but never declares that the protagonists of
Sholem-Aleykhem's "Dos porfolk" are _indikes_ 'turkeys', whose Hebrew 
correlate is _tarnegolot Hodu_ 'chickens of India = turkeys'.  In the Yiddish,
with a single significantly ambiguous exception, they are always called
_indianer_ 'Indians' (five times).  They are not ducks, or chickens, or geese,
or people -- just "indianer."  The _kareln_ ('beads') mentioned by the male
protagonist may be taken as a figurative term for the female protagonist's
_wattle_ ("A fleshy lobe {usually bright-coloured} pendent from the head or
neck of certain birds, as the domestic fowl, the turkey, etc."  [SOED])  Or,
on the other hand, as ornaments called up as part of the wooing strategy of
the hero.

The relationship of the heroes to turkeyness is in some ways parallel to that
of Swift's Houynhmns to horseness -- I strongly suspect Sholem-Alekhem knew
_Gulliver's Travels_.  The Yahoos in that great and complex work attempt to
reduce the noble Houyhnhnms to mere horses. A more radical reduction is
experienced by the heroes of "Dos porfolk."  The key sentence appears at the
very end of the story:  "In etlekhe minut arum zenen undzere shtoltse
_indianer_, dos gelibte porfolk, gelegn oyf der erd, vi tsvey poshete
gekoylete _indikes_." ('In minutes our brave Indians, the beloved couple, lay
on the ground like two plain butchered turkeys.'  [In Shlomo Katz's
translation, this becomes 'A few minutes later our loving pair, the prisoners,
lay on the ground'.  (Irving Howe and Eliezer Greenberg, _Treasury of Yiddish
Stories_, New York:  Viking, 1954, p. 205].

Sholem-Aleykhem understood that people are defined by society in many ways and
that these definitions have a determinative force.  In a series containing
three constructions, the protagonists are 1) "shtoltse indianer" (the term
suggesting ethnic particularity, the courage to "be oneself"), 2) "dos gelibte
porfolk" (creatures with a private life which is ground down by an
institutional mechanism, 3) "vi tsvey poshete gekoylete indikes" ('like two
plain butchered turkeys').  Under the guise of ritual (ideology, religion) an
elaborate system (transports, slaughter houses), at least in part
economically-motivated ("Na dir gelt, na!"), transforms feeling creatures
("lyubenyu... harts mayns... lebn mayns") who wish to live their own lives
into kosher-slaughtered carcasses ("gekoylete indikes").  This is no simple
allegory -- as evidenced by the fact that we can argue over whether or not the
protagonists are turkeys.

Subject: Litvak ditty

Reuven Fraser's (Vol. 07.077) recalled Litvak-accent ditty is related to the
one that my Lithuanian-born shver (father-in- law) recited with great glee,
though it seems to be a mockery of his landslayt and their speech. 

It went: "sabes nokh s'vues hot a siker gesosn a sikse in tsikage." (shabes
nokh sh'vues hot a shiker geshosn a shikse in shikage/Saturday after the
Feast of Weeks [Pentecost] a drunk shot a non-Jewish woman in Chicago.) 

BTW, my father-in-law, khayem shteyn (Hyman Stein) came from the shtetl of
Yanove on a tributary of the Nieman River and he bragged about two of its
accomplishments: it was the birthplace of Morris Winchevsky, the "zeyde" of
Yiddish labor poetry and prose, and one of its major Jewish occupations was
rafting logs down the river to Germany. Other than in his speech, I have
never encountered the term "plitn" for log-rafts.

Subject: tongue-twisters

Reuven Fraser writes about rhymes and tongue-twisters, giving the example of
the Bostonian "park your car in the Harvard yard". I used to listen to hockey
games on radio from all over the Eastern U.S. when I was a teenager (in
Toronto), and used to marvel at the Boston (WBZ 1030) pronunciation of
"Bo-eston goal scoh-ed by number foh-eh, Baabi Oh-eh" (which in 1972 was a
regular occurrence).

Back on topic, I sometimes give our kids this tongue-twister as a genuine
instruction: "shpil shtil in shpil-shtib" ["Play quietly in the playroom"]. 
Try that 3 times fast. Or even "shpil shtil mit shpiltsayg in shpil-shtib"
(dray mol shnel). Any other contributions?

Subject: indianer and sneezing

Re _turkey_ and _indianer_, I've missed much of this discussion so, for all I
know, this has already been mentioned, but the French word for 'turkey' is
_dinde_ (f.), _dindon_ and it comes from _d'Inde_, meaning 'from India'. I've
never heard of _indianer_ to mean 'turkey' -- but we ate goose in my house, so
what do I know. ;)

Rita Falbel's recollection of sneezing during someone's statement being
evidence for its truth matches my own. And it reminds me of another -- 
anything with the number seven in it -- of course, when uttered by someone
despised -- would elicit 'Zibn! Shoyn a lign!' (Of course, this was usually
said behind the person's back, so to speak.)

Alexander Maxwell's anecdote about his teacher's having seen Tum Balalayke
attributed as a 'Russian folksong' reminds me of something I heard on an artsy
FM folk music program, when the disk jockey, in the hushed reverent tones one
finds on such programs/stations, announced, 'And the next song is an ancient
Yiddish folksong which was collected in the field by the singer herself' --
and she then proceeded to play a rendition of _Rozhinkes mit mandlen_! I'm
sure Goldfaden would have been amused to hear that a song from his operetta
was 'collected in the field' a century later... ;)

Subject: zol mir zayn far dir

(Or, as my grandmother used to say, "Mir zol zayn far dayne beyner"). There
are similar expressions in Turkish.  "Kurban olayim" (may I be a sacrifice) 
can be used as a declaration of love or strong affection; similarly, "Canim
sana feda olsun" (may my soul be a sacrifice to/for you). I would expect this
wish for self sacrifice to have more general Middle Eastern origins.

Subject: dukhenen

In reply to query about dukhenen.  Dukhen in hebrew means bimah or stage. In 
Shulkhan orukh there is the expression Olim L'dukhon which means going up to
the stage for the blessing of the Kohanim. The Kohanim stood on the stage
while benching the people.

Subject: tum balalayke - a Vietnamese song

The discussion about tum balalayke reminds me of an incident a while back
that I have been meaning to pass on to Mendele. A couple of years ago I sang
tum balalayke for my Jewish Literature class. My Jewish students, having all
been brought up on English, French and Hebrew had never heard of it. My
Vietnamese students (the course fit their schedule, what can I tell you?)
recognized it instantly and were surprised and delighted that I knew a
Vietnamese song, even if the words were strange -- stranger even than English.
One of them came up to me after the class to tell me that while he liked my
singing and guitar (all three chords) very much, he felt I had got the spirit
of the song all wrong. "You must sang it much slower," he said. "Vietnamese
songs very sad. Very sad, Vietnamese people."

der emes!
