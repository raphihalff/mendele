Subject: Introductions

Sholem aleykhem.  I'm Sheldon Benjamin from Boston.  I
practice and teach neuropsychiatry at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School, a practice that seldom
involves Yiddish, except for the occasional proverb
popping up in a lecture.  My particular interests
include Yiddish folksongs and shtetl culture.  I came
to these interests from having spent years interviewing
my grandmother (from Streshin, Byelorussia) and record-
ing her songs prior to her death 10 years ago.  I
issued a cassette collection 7 years ago of 101 songs
of the 350 or so she recorded, have been trying to
write a  book on the subject, and enjoy exchanging
folksongs with others.  I feel that  folksongs were
often a repository for feelings that often were not
adequately  expressed in history books and stories. I
have parallel interests in genealogy, folklore, prov-
erbs, and utilizing old Russian map resources to learn
about the  shtetl.  My Yiddish isn't quite fluent but
my heart is in the right place. 

I was thrilled to be given the opportunity through
Mendele to read the translation of I B Singer's "Old
Age" and am excited at the possibilities of  this
network.

Hats off to our shames, reb Noyekh. 

[Reb Noyekh gebt tsu az koydem kol iz er aleyn nisht

syntactic question on 'vos bistu mir far a mekhutn?':

this is an interesting construction, syntactically. in
the german syntax literature, it's called the 'was fuer
split'--i.e. 

          vos far a mekhutn bistu mir 

becomes:  vos bistu mir far a mekhutn.

i've noticed that, in yiddish, it's used with an in-
variant 'a(n)', even when the following noun is plural,
e.g. from olsvanger's royte pomerantsn:

vos iz den dos far an ashires? (#135)
ikh farshtey nit, vos iz dos far a verter. (#152)

question for all you native speakers: is this always
the case? or could one also say:

vos iz den dos far ashires?
ikh farshtey nit, vos iz dos far verter.

if, in the original mekhutn sentence, you were talking
to several people, how would you say it, 1 or 2 or
either or neither?:

1. vos zent ir mir far a mekhutonim?
2. vos zent ir mir far mekhutonim?

a dank aykh!

Subject: RE: Vol1.12 "Old Age" by I.B. Singer

       "Move a little closer to the wall, Tatte," she   
       whispered in a firm and businesslike tone, as if 
       she were discussing an illegal transaction with  
       an accomplice.  "Do you hear me or not?  Lie     
       just like that until I tell you that you can     
       move.  That's  the way...that's it."

Does the story just stop at this point, or is there
more to come?
