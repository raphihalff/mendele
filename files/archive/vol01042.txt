Melekh (viswanat@draco.rutgers.edu), you're right, of
course; it was a typo; thanks! On the other hand,
"slogn", with slightly palatalized "s", (but, NOT
"slugn"), would be a fair representation of so-called
Litvish.
You never did reply to my query about the origin of
your name.  
2) To: auwera@ccu.UIA.AC.BE
Sorry to have burdened you with so many questions. Can
you stand a few more?
 
Do you happen to know the name of the visiting graduate
student from New York who was studying Dutch-Yiddish
contacts? Did he work in The Netherlands, too? Was he
interested in Dutch Yiddish, too?
 
To: BERK@ZODIAC.BITNET
Bob, I'm replying via Mendele, because the material may
be of general interest.
 
I'm grateful to your friend in Israel for supplying
Chapter and Verse: (Judges 5: 28) "bead hekhalon
nishkefa....". Let me know what he says about "derekh
hekhalon".
 
As for the Bialik pun about the "tarnegol", i.e. about
the "khosn" under the "khupe":
 
"mise" (as in "mise meshune", by the way) is from
Aramaic and means 'death'. It's spelled with "sof",
pronounced as Ashkenazic [s], traditionally transliter-
ated "th", but prounced [t] in Ivrit. So, the
"tarnegol" with which one shlogs (!) "kapores" is going
to his death.
 
Yiddish "mIte" (with initial stress), spelled with
"tes", is from Hebrew "mitA" 'bed' (with final stress).
In Yiddish it means 'stretcher (generally for carrying
a corpse)'. In this case, the (about-to- be-married)
"tarnegol" is (about to be) going to bed (in Ivrit) or
to the 'death-carrier" (in Ashkenazic).  
Bialik's Hebrew poetry relies on an Ashkenazic stress
pattern for much of its beauty. I think that's true of
much of his punning as well. In any event, both options
yield reasonable puns.
 
Finally, it was the SPELLING of hebrew words that was
taken into Yiddish faithfully, not their pronunciation
(which was adapted to the sound patterns of the borrow-
ing language). The words underwent all subsequent sound
changes without reference to their origin). Even the
traditional gender of Hebrew-origin words was often
changed. Originally, all/most? were treated as neu-
ters!!--dos seyfer, dos ponim, dos mes. Furthermore,
tradition was "dissed" (how's that for being up-to-
date?) in such anomalous Hebreoid formations in Yiddish
as "shabosim" (Heb. shabatot), "taleysim" (Heb.
taluyot), etc. So . . .

From Mikhl Herzog and Noyekh Miller:

MH: (of Viennese Jews)..it was an effort of the Jewish
community, nebekh, (do you know the expression
"meshteyns gezogt" or some variant? What does it mean
to you?) 

NM: Doesn't 'meshteyns gezogt' derive from 'um shteyn
gezogt'?  To me it's something like 'as it were', an
ironic even sarcastic  signal that what has gone before
is more pathetic than imposing. It might be said of
someone who teaches l'moshl sales techniques and is
billed as a professor of distributive education.  So
with the Viennese Jews no doubt.  Getrofn?  Tsu neyn?

MH: 'meshteyns gezogt' seems to derive from a warding
off formula "zay es dem shteyn gezogt'; i.e., 'may it
(the evil) be upon the stone'(nisht af mir nor afn
shteyn gezogt). Something like "nisht mir/dir gedakht".
The fact that the etymology is not at all transparent
has led to many variants: "imshteyns gezogt",
"nishteyns gezogt", etc. Its meaning varies, too: 1)
It's an expression of serious concern: er iz krank,
mishteyns gezogt; 2) It's an expression of derision: er
iz krank, mishteyns gezogt 'you call that sick?' So,
lot's of room for interdialectal misunderstanding (and
joking). This is your usage.  

NM: Thanks about the first meaning of meshteyns gezogt. 
I don't think I ever heard it, although the etymology
is a more exact version of what I remember reading,
hence 'um shteyn'.  As for avoidance-incantations, is
it your experience as well that most of them are used
exclusively by women?  I'm thinking of 'nisht aynt
(sic) gedakht, nisht itster gedakht', etc.  

But corned beed for a nickel?  I don't remember that
even during the Depression.  Oy did you have it good! 
Meshteyns gezogt.

(later)
It seems to me, having written that last line, that I
_did_ hear meshteyns gezogt in the first sense as well
but it was always  with a wry tone.  So not so much
avoidance as rejection or distaste. Something like the
American yeah, as in: 

Avrom (remembering what it was like to be young): Ay,
were those the days!
Berel (thinking instead of what it was like to be
poor): Yeah.

Reminds me of Morgenbesser's famous double-positive
yeah,yeah. There'll always be a Yiddish.

 
MH: As for "meshteyns gezogt" and other Yiddish "ward-
ing-off" expressions, it never occurred to me that
there was a sex difference in their usage, although
there may well be. It's a good subject for Deborah
Tannen. You'd be interested in a book by James
Matissof, "Psycho-Ostensives in Yiddish" (ISHI, Phil.)
which classifies and discusses the innumerable verbal
formulae that characterize Yiddish folk-speech and
often yield calques in English as well.
