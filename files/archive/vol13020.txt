Subject: Dov Noy wins Israel Prize

Professor Dov Noy, one of the world's foremost authorities on Jewish
folklore and a long time Mendele subscriber has been awarded the 2004 Israel
Prize.

Dov Noy came to Israel from his native Poland in 1938. He served in the
British army during the WWII and after the war continued his education at
Hebrew University, Yale, and Indiana University. In 1956 Dov Noy founded and
until 1983 served as a director of the Haifa Ethnological Museum and
Folklore Archives, including the Israel Folktale Archives. In 1968 he
founded Hebrew University Folklore Research Center. Dov Noy taught at Hebrew
University, where he was the chair of the Hebrew Literature Department and
at Bar Ilan, where he was a Distinguished Professor of Yiddish. Dov Noy was
a visiting professor at dozens of universities around the world, including
Toronto, Harvard, UCLA, Berkeley, Pennsylvania, Oxford, Boston, Sao Paulo,
Melbourne. He wrote and edited more than 200 books and papers in several
languages. In the last several years Dov Noy organized Yiddish summer
courses and expeditions in Ukraine and Moldova.

I would like to congratulate Dov Noy on this occasion and wish him many more
years of new achievements.

Before looking into some arcane definitions, can we rule out the benign term
"fundraiser" - which is unquestionably one meaning for schnorer? Are you
looking for something that is "severely negative," as you indicated?

We always translated it as "beggar."

Subject: Re: shnorer

Maybe we should distinguish between a betler and a shnorer. The betler begs;
the shnorer wheedles and manipulates. The betler's demands are backed by the
positive commandment (mitsve) to help the poor; the shnorer goes for a
gmilus khesed, an interest-free short-term loan which he will in all
likelihood never repay. The betler's status is by definition lower than that
of his patron; the shnorer's status can be and often is the same or higher
(watch the verbs: men shenkt a nedove, men derlangt a gmilus khesed).
Finally, the relation between betler and patron is brief and limited; the
shnorer seeks to establish a more lasting set of ties.

In short, shnorers come in all shapes and sizes, from perhaps the world's
most famous, Don Quixote de la Mancha, and his compatriot Menashe Da Costa,
hero of Zangwill's delightful _The King of Schnorrers_, to the large
assortment of scroungers, freeloaders and users in Shakespeare, Moliere,
Dickens and Henry James.

Michael Meckler's remarks in 13.009 are right on target.  Here's my
definition: a shnorer is one who considers it perfectly proper to be
supported by others with little or nothing offered in exchange, which claim
in turn is rejected by others.  Rebishe eyniklekh, for instance, or yeshive
bokhurim--especially married ones--have their detractors. Who is not
familiar with the old Yiddish vertl: farlost a bord un vil nit arbetn?  (I
grieve to report that even academics are thus labelled but that is obviously
malicious slander and requires no further comment.)

We run across shnorers in Mendele Moykher Sforim and indeed throughout
Yiddish literature (think of Sholem Aleykhem, I.J. Singer and Chaim Grade
for instance) but the most perceptive literary portrait I know is of the
sleazy gemore-melamed in Dovid Bergelson's great story, "Yosef Shur"
http://shakti.trincoll.edu/%7Emendele/onkelos/shur.pdf though I'm always
eager to read of other kandidatn.

More about the Passover Haggadah published by the Jewish Bund in 1900 in
Geneva, published by "Chulyot" Journal of Yiddish Research in the
Universities of Haifa and Tel-Aviv, No. 2, Summer 1994, according to the
abstract written by Haya Bar-Yitzchak: This Bund Passover Haggadah
constitutes a rewriting of the traditional Seder in an ideologically secular
and socialist mode.

It was published in this periodical in both the yiddish original and in a
hebrew translation. It was emphasized that it was not an entirely fresh
creation, since it was preceded by two similar attempts: a socialist
Haggadah published in London in 1887, another that appeared in New York in
1896. The London Haggadah, apparently the first of its kind, was composed,
according to Zalman Reizen's 1928-29 lexicon, by Leon Zolotkoff and Benjamin
Feygnboym. The most acerbic of the three, it is openly hostile and
contemptuous toward the "brutal oppression" of the captalist system.

The author of this hebrew article compares the texts of these three
late-19th-century socialist Haggadahs, analyzes their diversions from the
traditional liturgy, and comments on the ways in which they influenced the
subsequent development of non-tradtional kibbutz Haggadahs in Palestine.

Subject: Re: Recorded classics

In Mendele Vol. 13.018, George Katz asks for a source of recorded classics
of yiddish literature. An excellent online source for quite a few yiddish
stories is THE WORLD OF YIDDISH / DI VELT FUN YIDDISH:
(http://yiddish.haifa.ac.il/ ). You can read the text of the stories as well
as listen to them being read.
