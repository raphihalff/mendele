Subject: "shnek"

In German "Schnecken" refers to two long braids started above or over
the ears which are then each turned in a spiral over the ear (and then
fastened with pins) so that they look a little bit like snail shells or
like rolled-up snakes.

Subject: shnek, a frizur

The german word for snail is 'Schnecke'.

The german Wahrig dictionary says that Schnecke also means: Haartracht
mit gewundenen Zoepfen ueber den Ohren. Hair style with wound braids on
the ears. It was also called the headphone-style.

Subject: shnek

In 6.049 Joachim Neugroschel asks about the word "shnek" for a female
hair-do.  The word is most probably from German, where "Schneckenfrisur"
or short "Schnecke" (snail) was used for a hairdressing that was popular
in the twenties.  The characteristic part of it is a large curl covering
both temples.  The curl is such that it almost forms a spiral and thus
reminds of a snail-shell.  I'm convinced that this is the reason the
hair-do is called that, though I haven't found the etymology for this
particular meaning of "Schnecke" in a dictionary.

Subject: A race against time

An international register of those individuals who were involved in (or
are presently involved in) any of the several types of secular Yiddish
schools in America--as teachers, farvalters, parents and\or students--is
being assembled by Gella Schweid Fishman, Director of "The Secular
Yiddish Schools in America Oral History Project".

Mrs. Fishman is also Special Consultant to the newly-established
archival collection "The Secular Yiddish Schools in America Collection",
at The Stanford University Libraries, Department of Special Collections,
Stanford, CA 94305.

One of the purposes of the Register that is now being assembled is to
better inform those who are interested in the process and progress of
the two above-mentioned projects.

A "starter list" of more than 300 individuals (many of whome have
participated in one or both of these projects) has already been put
together, but there are thousands more out "there"--and we should be in
touch with one another! Those who would like to participate are asked to
give the following information about themselves: 1. Your full name,
including Yiddish and maiden name 2. Your present address and telephone
number 3. Name(s) of the shul(n) with which you were (or still are)
involved, its (their) location (city and state) and its (their)
organizational affiliation (Arbeter-Ring, Farband, Ordn, Sholem
Aleichem, or other/none) 4. The type(s) of involvement (teacher,
farvalter, parent, student) 5. The precise years of your involvement (of
each type) 6. If you were a student (the most common type of
involvement), describe the extent of your Yiddish education (folkshul,
mitlshul, hekhere kursn, lerer seminar) and the precise years spent at
each level.

This endeavor is a "race against time". it is an effort to document the
names of those individuals who participated in (and may still be
participating in) "the golden age of Yiddish education" in America. When
most of the shuln closed, most of the records, pedagogical materials,
documents, photos, shul journals, etc., that described their varied and
vibrantly creative inter-generational activities were lost or discarded.

Those remaining must now be collected and preserved against the ravages
of time and forgetfulness. Together we can, at least partially,
reconstruct some of that glorious history so that future generations
will be able to study it and integrate it into their own individual and
collective Yiddishkayt. Pass the word!

Subject: Spinoza and Yiddish

There are many references to Spinoza in Singer's writing. The most obvious
is the story "The Spinoza of Market Street," about a man who is an expert on
Spinoza and who constantly broods on Spinoza's ideas. Singer himself seems
to have done exactly the same thing: in his autobiographical novel _The
Certificate_, for example, he is prevented from praying when he thinks about
Spinoza's idea of God.
