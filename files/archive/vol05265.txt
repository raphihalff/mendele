Subject: Nit Gedayget

While examining the very first issue (in 1938) of the YKUF periodical Yiddishe
Kultur, I came across an advertisement for a summer camp called "Kemp
Nitgedayget." I momentarily forgot the exact meaning of this expression, so
commonly heard amongst native Yiddish speakers. I tried to look it up, without
success, in Weinreich, Harkavy, Stutchkov and other sources. What threw me was
that it was spelled in Yiddish exactly as it sounds, so that is how I tried to
look it up. Eventually I realized that the root is Hebrew, and spelled daled,
alef, gimel, hey, whereas I was looking for daled, tsvey yudn, etc. I thought
that it was only in the Soviet Union that Hebrew words were spelled
phonetically in Yiddish. How common was this practice in the U.S? I would
guess that the onset of YIVO standardization did away with this. It seems like
a twist on Yinglish!

Incidentally, did any Mendelyaners attend this camp? It might be interesting
to hear something about it from an ex-camper. How did it compare with camps
Boyberik and Hemshekh? (Love those names!)  Ikh hob gehert vegn di letste
tsvey, ober nisht fun Nitgedayget.

Subject: Articles in the dative case

I'm a little embarassed to be posing such basic questions to this assemblage
of scholars, but I have been unable to resolve these ters on my own:

1) Is the neuter artice "dos" inflected in the dative case, as
     "der" is to "dem," and "di" to "der"?  If so, what is the
     dative form?

2) Does the plural article "di" inflect to "der" in the dative
     case, following the example of the feminine "di"?  Or does
     it remain the same?

Subject: YiddishNet

Noyekh reminded me at least two months ago that it's already time to post
another YiddishNet announcement on Mendele.   I am finally getting around to
it.  Here is an info file on YiddishNet along with instructions of how to
subscribe to YiddishNet.

              ________________________________________

      Welcome to Yiddishnet, a moderated news and announcement
          list dedicated to the field of Yiddish language and culture.

What is Yiddishnet?

          YiddishNet is a non-discussion mailing list dedicated to Yiddish
language and culture.  The purpose of the list is to gather and disseminate
news and information about Yiddish language and culture in America and
internationally to both speakers and non-speakers of Yiddish. It covers
Yiddish literature, media, computers, language instruction material and
programs, e-mail, services, conferences, news as well as performances,
meetings, events, and activities sponsored by various groups and organizations
around the world.  We hope that the list will serve as an informational
clearinghouse in a manner and breadth not available in any other single
publication or forum.   The list should be useful to all lovers of Yiddish,
whether the interest be of an ideological, popular or academic nature.  The
sponsor of YiddishNet is The Workmen's Circle. There is no schedule for
posting, but roughly between 65,000 and 100,000 k is posted each month.

         One of the benefits of the list will be to increase awareness of how
much takes place in Yiddish across generations and religious affiliation all
around the world. This community of interest is geographically diffuse and we
believe that this kind of network will not only help connect Yiddish-lovers
all over the world but also aid in the further growth and development of
Yiddish cultural activities.

          The Workmen's Circle also publishes a quarterly bulletin "Global
Yiddish" in print in a complete bilingual edition in an 11"X14" 12-page
two-color format. "Global Yiddish" is dedicated to the same aims as
YiddishNet, but space and time requirements limit the amount of material that
can be published. The Yiddish version of the bulletin (6 pages), called
"Alveltlekh Yiddish", is published together with the English (6 pages).
YiddishNet will publish the English version of the bulletin ("Global Yiddish")
minus the photos, graphics, and color. Publishing the Yiddish version
("Alveltlekh Yiddish") will be possible in the next few months as well.   Once
the technical aspects of this are mastered, the software necessary to receive
and send Yiddish e-mail will also be available on YiddishNet for simple
downloading (for IBM's and MAC's.)

         YiddishNet will also publish the English parts of newsletter of other
Yiddish-oriented clubs and organizationse, i.e., YIVO Institute of Jewish
Research and Yiddish of Greater Washington.  In fact, all Yiddish clubs,
choruses, theaters, klezmer bands, and organizations are invited to to publish
its events, notices or even entire newsletters on YiddishNet.  Just send an
ascii text or even an html file and it will be posted or placed on our
upcoming website. YiddishNet welcomes all informative postings about present
and future programs, performances, meetings, events, activities, publishing,
and products.  Please let us hear of your latest news or interesting finding
from anywhere in the world which you feel may be interesting to others with an
interest in the field of Yiddish.   Please e-mail your posting, comments, or
questions to Reyzl Kalifowicz-Waletzky, the YiddishNet moderator/owner.

Subject: The Montreal Yiddish Theater

Dear Friends,

I am writing to inform you of the Montreal Yiddish Theater.  We are one of the
largest and most productive Yiddish language theaters in North America; we are
a volunteer organization.

I am a new member.  My name is Warren Alexandre, and I will be appearing as
the lead character in our new musical production of Sholom Aleichem's "Shver
tzu zayn a Yid".

Our theater is currently undergoing a time of flux; the spiritual and artistic
director of our troupe, the inimitable Dora Wasserman, has recently taken
quite ill.  I have only known this woman for a short while, and she has left
an indelible impression on me.  She came to see me at a show I was performing
in town last June, and I was caught up in the infectiousness of her
enthusiasm.

Through my brief experience with her and the theater, I have started to
rediscover Yiddish, the language of my very early childhood.  I have also
begun a personal quest to learn about my roots; to even face the Holocaust,
which I have found so difficult to learn about.

I have discovered that Yiddish holds the answer to so many questions I have
asked about myself, and the empowerment attained for me by being part of the
continuation and forward advancement of our Mame Loshn is overwhelming.

Our troupe is a theater of passion, and of joy.  Our past productions have
been critically acclaimed.  As a professional actor myself, to be working
among such dedicated, talented amateurs is humbling.

I look forward in hearing from any of my fellow "mendele" subscribers, and I
offer you a personal invitation to attend the show at the Saidye Bronfman
Theater, late May and June 1996.  If you would like to correspond to me
personally, I may be emailed at "Winkelman@medcor.mcgill.ca".

Sholom Aleichem

Warren Alexandre
