Subject:  A confession of my own

That l'shone tayveh in ASCII-crude-graphic form that our honest and
noble shames has attributed to me is something I myself was sent by
a certain Valodya Lumelsky, robotics engineer at Wisconsin. But
maybe he was *also* a gonif?

Subject: Introduction

I'm a new subscriber, but I've been reading someone else's copy of
Mendele for a while now.  (Thanks, Harold!)

My mother was a native Yiddish speaker, but she taught us only a few
isolated (but colorful) phrases.  After I took a year of German in
college and perceived the obvious relationships, I tried to learn
some Yiddish in various ways:  from my mother, from friends, from
folk songs, etc., eventually from Weinreich's _College_Yiddish_.
That was about 30-35 years ago, and I was not terribly successful in
the effort.  How I wish that Mendele existed at that time . . . or,
rather, that I was 30 years younger today!

My mother's uncle, Pinkhus Rudoy, was a Yiddish scholar.  I believed
he participated in a YIVO project to assemble an etymological
Yiddish dictionary (analogous to the Oxford English Dictionary).
Does this exist?  Is it what I have seen referred to here as the
Weinreich dictionary?  He also wrote novels, that were serialized in
the Forvert, I believe, under the name Pinye Bal-loshn; at least one
of them, _Oyf_Amerikaner_Erd_, was published in book form.

In response to Martin Davis's comment in Vol. 3.108, my mother and
her family also said manse for mayse, but they mostly spoke a
typical SEY dialect.  (They lived in Olaskov--which has
disappeared--, Golta, and Odessa.)  Where does the `n' come from,
and was it prevalent in CY and SEY both?

Subject: Re: Mayse

Martin Davis (mendele 3.108) states that his family (from Lodz) said
'manse' for 'mayse.' My family, from Bendin (Bedzin), south of Lodz,
said something intermediate between the two - 'may~se.'  (I'm using
'~' to represent nasalization of the previous vowel.)  I always
thought this nasalization was restricted to a Hebrew `ayin. However,
an acquaintance of mine, from somewhere near Bialystok in eastern
Poland, also nasalizes those alefs that are punctuated with a
khataf-patakh - when he davens, he says 'a~sher' for 'asher'.

Subject:  "Shas"

Re E. Portnoy's question about the acronym "sh's" pronounced "shas":
it is "shisha sedarim" - the six orders of the Talmud.

Subject: Regarding yontif

Actually, the phrase "Gut yontif to the Pontif" was used when the
Pope arrived in New York on Yom Kippur sometime in the late
seventies/early eighties. ... probably 1979.

Subject: Introduction

	My name is Robert D. King, and I teach at the University of
Texas at Austin.  I work on Yiddish linguistics and, especially
recently, on the ways that linguistics tells us something about
Jewish history.  Right now I'm a bit more into research on India
than anything else--my work on India being mainly historical and
having nothing to do with Jewish matters.

Regards,
Bob King
