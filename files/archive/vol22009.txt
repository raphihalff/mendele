Subject: Findjan

Helen Katz asks about the source of the "Findjan Song" in Yiddish. I'm afraid I haven't 
come across it before, so can't answer her question directly, but the Hebrew version was 
written by Hayim Hefer (Feiner) in 1947 and according to him
http://onegshabbat.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/blog-post.html
he wrote the words (rather than translate them). It is sung to the tune of an Armenian folk 
song which was already known in the Palmach at that time. In other words, it seems 
likely that the Hebrew version preceded the Yiddish one.

Date: Findjan to Helene B. Katz
Subject: November 10

In Mendele Vol. 22.008, Helene B. Katz raised a question about the song
Findjan. 

Here is my response to the question. The Yiddish version has almost nothing to do with 
Hebrew contents of the song written by Khayim Khefer who was then in the Palmach, in 
1947, to the melody of an Armenian shepherd folksong.
Yaakov Shonberg, in Berlin, collected Hebrew songs sung by those who came to Berlin 
from the Land of Israel in 1935 and printed the notes to the songs.
The melody in his notes is the exact melody sung by Israelis whereas the
Armenian melody is slightly different. 

The assumption is that a young man in the Palmach heard the song in his parents' house 
in Germany and introduced the melody to his friends.

Subject: Froyim (Ephraim) Kaganowski

As a volunteer translator for the Yiddish Center in Amherst, I am seeking information of 
a more personal nature about this fine Yiddish author.  I have translated several of his 
short stories from FIGURN. (Warsaw 1937) and feel that I am actually beginning to 
know him.
But it occurred to me that there may be others out there who REALLY knew him, of him, 
about him???    Perhaps family or friends??
There is a comprehensive description of him in the YIVO encyclopedia website.....but I 
would greatly appreciate more personal memories, mayselekh and recollections.

Subject: Zusman Segalowicz

Does anyone have any family information on the poet/writer Zusman Segalowicz from 
Bialystok? My cousin, whose great-grandfather was a Segalowicz from Bialystok, is 
interested to learn if there is a family connection.

This person who is also searching features your song (Prison Song)-- although it looks 
like a 'lost' melody.

Subject: Yiddish translators wanted (sine pecunia!)
Date: November 28

Good morning!

My name is Gwen Glazer, and I work at Cornell University Library. We recently 
announced a new project involving Yiddish-speakers helping to translate journals and 
newspapers, and we thought you and your readers might be interested to know about it.

Details about the project can be found in our press release

http://news.library.cornell.edu/news/121127/YiddishCrowdsourcing 

and we would be happy to discuss any questions you may have.

Thank you!
Gwen Glazer

Subject khores/kheyrus 
Date: November 25

In reply to Ruth Murphy's question (Mendele 22.008) about the term khores/kheyrus:

There are two Hebrew words, one being "chorus" (ch for ches, not kh, which usually 
represents a khof), meaning "carved" or "engraved," and the other "cheyrus," meaning 
"freedom" or "liberty." I'm not a literature person but from the context the latter seems to 
make more sense.

Subject: A Yiddish Song project

Samuel Vladimirovich Polonski was born in 1902 in Ukraine; from 17-20 years old he 
served in the Red Army, and by his early 20s was already leading musical ensembles and 
choruses. He died at the age of 52 in 1955, two years after Stalin died. In 1931, there 
were Yiddish schools, theatres, choruses, the autonomous republic of Birobidzhan had 
just been founded, and the Songbook, comprising 19 separate numbers, was presumably 
prepared for use in the Yiddish school system and by Yiddish choruses. The lyrics, many 
of them, are by the most respected names in the Soviet Yiddish pantheon: Itsik Fefer, 
Perets Markish, Izi Kharik, and others. Subject matter includes pastoral scenes and 
village life, collective farming, a woman who becomes a tractor driver, the death of 
Lenin, the Red Army, the machine rhythms of a shoe factory, and seamstresses.
Yiddish culture enjoyed a spotty and often tragic career in the USSR, but we can 
understand these songs by Shmuel Polonski as a record of a fleeting, uplifting moment in 
time, and as a legacy to the future for us to discover and cherish. The CD will render the 
whole set of 19 songs faithfully, creatively, and professionally, with name vocal talent 
and fresh instrumental arrangements. Klezmer musician, composer and ethnographer 
Yale Strom and Eric Gordon, Director Emeritus of SoCal Arbeter Ring, are the 
producers. If you are interested in being one of the singers for the Polonski project,
please submit one example  of you singing a Yiddish folk or art song. Send your just one 
MP3 to Yale Strom. _yitztyco@aol.com_ (mailto:yitztyco@aol.com) 
We hope to begin recording sometime in the fall 2013 and release the CD in 2014.
