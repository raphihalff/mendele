Subject: I.B. Singer's "Shadows on the Hudson"

Does any one knows whether it is possible to get the original Yiddish
version of  "Shadows on the Hudson," which was published in 1957 in the
New York daily Forverts  under the name of Yitskhok Varshavski or perhaps
D.Segal?

Sincerely,
Alice Dazord

Subject: Israel Rosenberg

Hello,

My name is Helene, I'm French, and I have been learning Yiddish for a few
months (by  myself). I'm currently making a new website of Yiddish songs,
in French, and I  subscribed to this mailing list thinking you could
sometimes help me with difficulties in  translations (Yiddish to English,
at least...). The site address: http://rama01.free.fr/yidlid

For the moment, I've got another kind of question:  I found this
information - obviously copied from a record cover - on a Youtube post for
the song "Vu iz dos gesele": Du bist  mayn harts/herts, mayn glik and Vu
iz dos gesele from the Musical Mashe, oder Margarita Ros. no. 10677 Copr.
no. E637791; Mar. 1/May 15, 1926 Mus.: Samuel Secunda Lyr.: Israel
Rosenberg Prop./pub.: Samuel Secunda; Hopkinson Theater Piano and voice.
Two songs: "You are my heart, my happiness" and "Where is the little
street (where you live)" from "Mashe or Margarita (heroine's both names)."
Libretto: Israel Rosenberg. Sheet music: sold as souvenir at the theater;
cover design (unsigned), with photos of Rosenberg, Secunda, and perf. Lucy
German and Misha German; cast roster (in Heb./Yid. char. and Eng.) and
verses in Heb./Yid. char., all on back cover.

When I looked for information about Israel Rosenberg, I only found a
Wikipedia page about an "Israel (also Yisroel or Yisrol) Rosenberg (ca.
1850-1903 or 1904)" who "founded the first Yiddish theater troupe in
Imperial Russia." Although a very young Secunda could have met this
Rosenberg during one of his tours in Kherson Gubernia, I suppose it
couldn't be the same man who wrote "Mashe oder Margarita"? Or could
Secunda have brought the play with him when he travelled to America?
So, my question is: has anyone got any information about the Israel
Rosenberg who actually wrote this song, "Vu iz dos gesele?" (or part of
it, as it seems to come from an old Polish or Russian folk song), and the
musical? Or else, do you know where I could look for such information?

Thanks,
Helene Courtois

Subject: zhulikes

In answer to Martin Jacobs,

"Zhulikes" is based on the Russian "zhuliki," meaning cheaters, petty
swindlers, rogues.
Sorry, I can "t help with the other words.

Subject: zhulikes

As far as I know, "zhulikes" were crooks. Interestingly, Crooks is also a
not uncommon American name.

Subject: (h)alevay

I want to know the derivation of  "Alevay."  It may start with a "hey."
Is it related to "Inshallah" and/or the Spanish  "Ojala"?

Subject: shtetl nicknames

For Martin Jacobs:

Tsigeln - cradles; cribs.  Nicknames were also used in my mother's
hometown, Chrzanow (near Cracow).  I don't think they all had meanings.
My grandfather's was Skutch. We knew of Pipek, and Zhimnovotska (variation
of cold water in Polish).
Strange that use of nicknames was not necessarily regional.  I don't think
towns neighboring Chrzanow used them.

Best,
Miriam Holmes

Subject: kirzhner

The dictionaries give "cap-maker," "hat-maker," and "furrier" for this
word. Does anyone know which meaning was most prevalent in the vicinity of
Pinsk, Belarus?
I need it for an article I am translating on the history of the Jews in
Ivanova (Janow) near Pinsk (not to be confused with other towns named
Janow).

Subject: patsher/fatsher

What is the meaning? The old-fashioned orthography makes it impossible to
know if the word is patsher, fatsher, potsher, or fotsher. It would seem
from the context that this is some sort of teacher, but what sort? Then
again, maybe this is not a word for a sort of teacher, but an additional
title this particular teacher has. From the history of Ivanova (Janow), a
list of teachers in the local Jewish school: "Alter der melamed un Khayim
der patsher - onfangers, nokh zey - Zalmen der lerer, Berl der melamed un
Mordkhe Hersh der melamed. In di shpetere yorn zenen shoyn geven lerers,
vos hobn  fartaytsht ivrit af ivrit un men hot oykh ongehoybn lernen
rusish."

Subject: liser sider/siddur

The word "liser" looks, from its form, to be an adjective based on the
name of a city (Lis/Lys/Li se/Lyse?). "Sider," of course, means a prayer
book.  I have two questions:
1. What does "liser" mean?
2. Is there a city of this name?
3. What is so special about a "liser sider" that it should get a special
mention?

"loynt nisht dem altn balebos uftsuheybn di oygn fun altn liser sider."
"the old man did not consider it worth his while to raise his eyes from
the old liser sider."

Subject: kheshbn

Alan Shuchat asks about regions where "kheshvn" vs. "kheshbn" were used.
I don't know the answer, but I can add that my parents pronounced it
"khezhm," meaning calculation or accounting, both literally and
figuratively. They were from Buczacz, formerly Galitsiye, then Poland, now
Ukraine.
