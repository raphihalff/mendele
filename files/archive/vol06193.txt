Subject: Kheshbn/khezhbm

Disputes about correct transcription are completely otiose unless one
makes a clear distinction between a _transliteration_, on the one hand,
which aims to represent in one alphabet (as reversibly as possible) the
actual spelling in another alphabet and a _phonetic/phonemic
transcription_, on the other, which attempts, with varying degrees of
detail (as required), to render the sound of a word.

And here a further distinction is called for between a "narrow"
transcription, on the one hand, which records every allophonic nuance
(useful for the outsider, but tediously overloaded for someone already
acquainted with the language or dialect in question) and a "broad" or
"phonemic" transcription, on the other, which restricts itself to giving
the bare phonemic outline (which has the virtue of comparative
simplicity, but may be inadequate for the outsider).

Thus a "transliteration" might need to make it clear to the unitiated
reader that the word in question begins with a khes and not a khof and
that first vowel is not (normally) written, but is supplied. It would
also need to record the presence of the vowel letter in the second
syllable which is silent in the Yiddish (merged) pronunciation (=
something like h(e)shbon, with dot under the initial h and otherwise
depending on the precise conventions adopted). In a broad transcription
it will suffice to write [kheshbn], since native speakers automatically
retrogressively assimilate [with a few specific exceptions] in
consonantal nexi involving plosives, fricatives and affricates and
accommodate nasals to the quality of an adjacent consonant whether
dental, labial or palatal and these rules are known to adult learners
formally trained in Yiddish.

If, on the other hand, one is writing for readers who neither know nor
subconsciously apply such rules, then a narrower, more allophonic
transcription will be necessary, e.g. [khezhbm]. In fact, Uriel
Weinreich is not 100% consistent on this issue (and probably doen't need
to be) in his (superb) dictionary.

The bottom line is simply that it is a question of horses for courses,
not right and wrong. However, for purposes like our own the broad
transcription is normally the most appropriate, particularly since it is
possible to smuggle into it elements of transliteration which can convey
(when relevant) spelling variants in the original [e.g. oyf/af/uf].

Subject: Yiddish dictionaries

I have not read the original attack on Uriel's Weinreich's dictionary,
nor what was aparently a very spirited comments by--im biz iber hundert
un tsvantsik--Mikhl Herzog, but perhaps I can put in a few words on this
subject as somebody who has done a fair share of work in Yiddish, and as
a close friend of Uriel Weinrech to boot.

Uriel was --though some may consider this irrelevant or nit eydl--
something of a "square," not exactly a prude, but someone who was
careful to keep sexual terms, however ribald or explicit, distinctly
apart from  shund, or jeujune toilet humor.  It is altogether likely,
therefore, that he bristled at the idea including 'shvants,' tokhes,
vekhedoyme in his dictionary.  The idea was: s'past nit.

Second, Uriel (like his father) was very concerned about preserving di
khshives fun yidish.  Again, including coarse expressions, however
often they are used in daily language, was not exactly his idea of
endowing his dictionary--the first scholarly dictionary of the Yiddish
language--with the proper khshives...

Finally--and this must be understood whether you lke it or not--Uriel
was a normativist (hope that's the right term, mikhl-lebn?): some words
are _right_, kosher, inviolable, however they may be shunned in daily
intercourse or even modern lierature, and others are wrong, treyf, not
to be used under any circumstances, however much they _are_.  The worst
offenders, of course, were daytchmerizmen--he once wrote a very amusing
article on this subject for _Yugntruf_.  He clearly suffered when
somebody used an englishizm--even though there seemed to be no other
word with kosher Yiddish-Hebrew or even old Slavic roots.  (I recall one
of his admirers, Leybl Kahan, once coining the term "kukuridze
sphrinkelekh", for corn flakes.  s'hot nebekh nit oysgehaltn dem
geshikhlkhn egzamin, but we had a lot of fun with it...)

Uriel's near-obsession also extended to the _pronunciation_ of certain
terms.  I must confess I can't remember what they were, but I do
remember they drove me up the wall.  I think they were words inherited
by Uriel (via his father, of course) from kurlendishn yidish and
may--again, my memory isn't too clear on it--related to diphthongs
particularly.

For all that, Uriel's dictionary is a masterpiece probably never to be
excelled.
