Subject: LCAAJ map with place names

Published versions of the base maps used in the Language and Culture Atlas 
of Ashkenazic Jewry have had few place names. In the 1980's Leye Robinson 
wrote in the place names of the eastern base map (the one that contains 
most locations) in YIVO transcription. The names she used are the Yiddish 
names supplied by the interviewees.
Bob Scott has now scanned this map and put it online at

Subject: bezhentses

Does anyone know what "bezhentses" are?  Bezhenets is the Russian word for 
refugee, but the piece that I am looking at is talking about a burning 
shul:

men hot geshosn tsvey bezhentses tsuzamen in orn-koydesh.

Someone suggested this means "grenades" but I can't find that anywhere. 
Perhaps it means that there were two people who had escaped from the 
roundup and were hiding in the orn-koydesh only to be discovered and shot. 
But that doesn't really make much sense. Efsher ken eyner fun di 
mendelyaner mir helfn.

Subject: Shira Gorshman's "Lebn un likht"

I have a copy of this book that was published in Moscow in 1974. It is 
written in Soviet Yidish orthography, which spells phonetically all 
loshn-koydesh words. I just wanted some more information about this 
writer. The book is full of stories of Soviet life and about the 
connection between grandparents and grandchildren whose love remains 
unbroken despite that their lifestyles have parted ways. Yiddish is spoken 
by all

Subject: Correct spellings for Yizkor Book translation

I'd like your input on a discussion our Yizkor book project coordinator is 
having with the translator of our Zambrow Yizkor book into English.
The subject is diminutive first
names. The translator would like to use apostrophes as in Shmul'keh, 
Binyom'keh, El'yeh, Shmer'l, and Avrem'l. His argument is that if you 
remove the apostrophe, we then have to open up a consideration for 
standard spelling concerns:

1. Is it Binyomka or Binyomkeh?  There is no 'right' or 'wrong' here, but 
we would have to standardize.

2, Is it Avrumel or Avruml? The Yiddish pronunciation does not call for a 
vowel between the last two consonants.

He also favors the apostrophe form on the basis that it makes the identity 
of the underlying name root more clear, especially to a non-Hebrew 
speaker.Whereas the Yizkor book coordinator prefers using the more common 
spelling without any apostrophes, I could go with endings of ka, keh, kah, 
el or l. The above names would be rendered as Shmulka, Binyomka, Elya, 
Shmerel, and Avremel. Furthermore, all of the genealogical databases don't 
use the apostrophe form.

Is this an arbitrary decision?
