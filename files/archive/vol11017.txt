of Eastern European Jews and their descendants. The YIVO

From: Irwin Mayers <imayers@yahoo.com>
Subject: Feminine Form of Mentsh

Does anyone know of a word for "mentsh" that would be used
to describe
a woman?  The word "eyshes-khayil" has been suggested but I
am not
certain it has the same connotation.

Thank you,
Irwin Mayers

From: sazarrow@vassar.edu
Subject: Short Plays

I am looking for short plays (one-acts) in Yiddish that have a
political or socio-political edge for a political theatre troupe.
Any
names would be appreciated.

Thanks

Subject: Request for Assistance -- Proletpen

The Dora Teitelboim Center for Yiddish Culture is currently
developing
a book of translations of the Proletpen, the left-wing rebels
poets of
the 30s, 40s and 50s (the poets and poems that Howe and
Greenberg
assiduously left out).  We are looking for individuals interested
in
contributing their literary skills to the work including
introductory
materials in Yiddish and/or English.  Please contact me as soon
as
possible at director@yiddishculture.org or (305) 774-9244.

From: Iosif Vaisman <iiv@ibiblio.org>
Subject: Make your own Yiddish webpage! (and more)

Zaytl-makher, a new web-based tool designed to create
Yiddish webpages,
greeting cards, short text documents, and email messages is
available
in Shtetl at http://www.ibiblio.org/yiddish/zm

Zaytl-makher has a built-in Visual Yiddish Keyboard, which
means that
it does not require installing a special keyboard driver or any
other
software. All what is needed is Internet Explorer browser
(version 5 or
later). Unfortunately, Netscape does not have Yiddish support
and
cannot be used with Zaytl-makher. Internet Explorer is
installed on
most computers and is freely available from 
http://microsoft.com/ie

Current version of Zaytl-makher allows users to type Yiddish
text which
can be saved in HTML format or copied and pasted into another
application (e.g., into Outlook to send an email). If the text
saved as
HTML file (a web page), it will be stored on the Zaytl-makher
server,
where it can be accessed by anybody notified by the page
author. The
web page can be also downloaded for further web editing
(adding images,
etc.) and then posted to the author's own web space.

Visual Yiddish Keyboard is also used in another tool, SHML
(Shmuesn in
mame-loshn) - the first Yiddish bulletin board on the Internet:
http://www.ibiblio.org/yiddish/shml

SHML has been already tested by several Mendelyaner last
year, the new
version includes support for typing the poster's name and
subject in
both English and Yididsh, and full support for multilevel threads
- a
perfect opportunity for elaborate online discussions in
mame-loshn! As
is with Zaytl-makher, Internet Explorer is the only program
needed to
communicate in Yiddish on SHML.

From: Goldenberg <rgoldenberg@sympatico.ca>
Subject: Khasye di yesoyme

In Volume 11.014 there were several postings about Yankev
Gordin's
"Khasye di yesoyme." For anyone seeking this play, an edition
was
published in Buenos Aires in 1973 (#57 in the Musterverk
series). It is
titled: "Yankev Gordin - Dray Drames." The other 2 plays in
this
collection are "Mirele Efros", and "Got, Mentsh un Tayvl."
Copies may
be available from the National Yiddish Book Centre in Amherst,
Massachusetts.

From: "Donn O'Meara" <donnom@netvision.net.il>
Subject: ruk un hant

Halz-und-Beinbruch is all right in its way [11.015], but its
etymology
appears to be unquestionably German. A really interesting
etymology is
that of the Yiddish expression "brechn ruk un hant". Why "back
and
hand"? The answer seems to be that the Ukrainian word for
hand is
"Ruka".
