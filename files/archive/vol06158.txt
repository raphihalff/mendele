Subject: Missionary source of a B'rit Chadash

I received my copy of the B'rit Chadash from a street-corner missionary in
Miami Beach about twenty years ago. There was nothing secretive about him.
He was distributing English-language copies of the New Testament and was
displaying a sign that invited "Jewish persons" to receive a copy in
Yiddish. Well, I was and am a "Jewish person," and so I asked for a copy.
Like many another in this world, he asked whether I "really" read Yiddish
and whether I would read it. I accepted the copy and have done some
reading in it. It is the Einspruch translation and seems to me to be a
pretty good translation -- not great, but pretty good. I may add that a
Yiddish vinkl I belonged to enjoyed hearing the Sermon on the Mount in
mame-loshn, and I have gazed with envy on the fine, clean type, quality
paper, and sturdy leatherette cover. Oyf unzere yidishe bikher gezogt
gevorn! Thank you for the reminder.

Subject: Der B'rit Chadash

Authors, translators, and publishers of the evangelical texts,
commentaries, and fiction in Yiddish constitute a fairly diverse pool:
assorted Christian missionaries and spiritual ancestors of Jews for
You-know-whom,  Jewish scholars (religious and secular) and Yiddish
writers, halakhic authorities and self-appointed solvers of the "Jewish
question".

The New Testament itself has a long history in "Hebraeo-Teutonicum"
language. I don't know about the earliest translation, but by the end of
the 17th century it was already around:

Sifre ha-Berit hadashah: Dos naye testament in di Yudishe shrift,
Frankfurt an der Oder: Sumptibus Michaelis Gottschalckii, 1700.

That edition was followed soon by:

Novum Iesu Christi testamentvm Iudaicogermanice redditum maxime a
Ioh. Mullero & H.C.I. Frommanno; ed. Io. Henr. Callenberg.
Halae: Instituti judaici, 1736

In the 19th century The Church of Scotland became seriously concerned
with the salvation of poor Jewish souls. In 1839 it has sent a mission
of inquiry to the Jews. Andrew Bonar wrote a "Narrative of a mission..."
(Edinburgh: William Whyte & Co., 1842 and other editions). The book
presents a very interesting account of Jewish life in various parts of
Europe and Middle East, written by the quite sympathetic outsiders
(ironically or not they were significantly less biased (i.e.
anti-semitic) than their non-missionary fellow travellers of that time).
According to Bonar, his expedition distributed many books in Yiddish. He
does not give references, but quite likely those were from the 1820
London edition:

Naye Testament fun dem mashiah [New Testament in Judisch-Deutsch],
London: A. Macintosh, 1820

England was a fruitful soil for the scriptural production. Formed in
1804, the "British un Oyslendishe Bibel-gezelshaft" for the first 100
years of its existence distributed 25 million copies of Bible in 350
languages. In 1907 alone they sent out 6,435 Bibles in Yiddish. Besides
the major fare translated by Mordekhei Shmuel Bergmann, they served a
choice of side dishes: "Di heylige bsoyre toyve nokh Yohanan" (1920),
"Di apostelgeshikhte" (1954), etc. In Germany Trovitsh und zohn, printed
"Di bikher fon neyen bond: neyes testament (ney iberzetst)" (Berlin,
1901 and other editions), as well as separate "Dos evangelyum fon
Markus" (Berlin, 1928) and "Dos evangelyum fon Matyah" (Berlin, 1931).

Other examples include: "Dos naye testament fun dem moshiah" (Vien:
Adolf Holtshoizen, 1899), "Der briv tsu di Yidn" (New York: New York
Bible Society, 1900), "Sefer Torah, neviim u-ksovim, dos izt Di gantse
heylige shrift" (Chicago: Chicago Hebrew Mission, 1904), "Di heylige
psure toyve fun Matya" (Vien: Adolf Holtshoizen, 1906), "Di gute bsoyre
loyt Yohanan, a naye iberzetsung" (New York: American Bible society,
1927), "Di gute psure loyt Matai, fun Grikhish ibergezetst un farglikhn
mit andere mershprakhike iberzetsunge" (Philadelphia: American Scripture
Gift Mission, 1940), "Leopold Cohn memorial edition of the New Testament
in the Yiddish language" (New York: American board of missions to the
Jews, 1947), "New Testament in Yiddish, translated by Aaron Krolenbaum"
(Philadelphia: Million Testaments Campaigns, 1950).

Henry Einspruch's translation was published 5 times by the Lederer
Foundation: first edition in 1941, fifth in 1977.

There was never a deficit of the "secondary sources" in Yiddish. Early
examples include:

Francisco Haslbauer, Gerindlikher berikht fun der emunas ha-Notsrim,
Prag: Carolo-Ferdinandaeischen Buchdruckerei, 1719

Francisco Haslbauer, Kurtser inhalt des Kristlikhen gizatsis, Prag:
Carolo-Ferdinandaeischen Buchdruckerei, 1729

and later on:

Hananyah Berliner, Ha-Podeh u-matsil, a beshreybung fun dem leben di
maasim un di toros fun yeyshua hamashiah, Leipzig: J.C. Hinrichs, 1898.

D. Landsmann, Yeshue Hanoytsri izt der meshieh emes : eyn bezukh bay
eyner beshnaydung, New York: American Tract Society, 1899

Y.V., Di drayeynigkeyt, eyn tsvigeshprekh (vikueh) tsvishen eynem Yuden
und eynem Kristen, London(?), 1890

Y.V., Yom ha-Kipurim, London(?), 1897

Y.V., Di zohnshaft, London(?), 1897

Meyer Lerman, Velkhe iz di vahre religyon? New York: New
York Gospel Mission to the Jews, 1900(?)

There was even a monthly magazine in Yiddish "Roeh Yisrael" (Brooklyn,
Sar Shalom Association) that lived for 54 years (1919-1973).

Probably, the most malignant manifestation of this kind of literature
are books for children, e.g. "Der Idisher artst un der kleyner tambur"
by "Dr. Zeckhausen" (New York, 1890).

Each poison calls for an antidote. Famous Karaite thinker and polemist
Rabbi Isaac ben Abraham Troki (1533-1594) wrote his famous "Chizzuk
emunah", where he conclusively proved that Jesus was neither son of G-d,
nor messiah, and, in general, no-goodnik. The book was translated in
many languages, including Yiddish: "Hizuk emunah, ibergezetst oys loshen
ha-koydesh in Taytsh" (Amsterdam, 1717).

Other books from both sides and from above the fence include:

Joseph Holt Ingraham, Sefer Tiferet Yisrael, meyusad oyf di kitve kodesh
(tr. by Benedix Benzion), Odessa: A. Shultse, 1883

Well, I am not 100% sure that it was an appropriate topic to discuss
between Shabes Vayigash and December 25, but...
