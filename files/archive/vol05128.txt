Subject: Yiddish literary translations

About a month ago I alerted Mendele that I would be researching and
translating to lesser-known works by well-known writers, a short play by
Morris Rosenfeld, "Rent Strike," and a short story by Jacob Gordin,
"Jesus Christ and Karl Marx on the Streets of New York," for a
presentation at the MLA Conference in December in Chicago.  Since my goal
is academic, non-commercial publication, the issue of securing the rights
to translate these works should not be a problem.  However, if anyone
knows of a significant reason why either of these works may not be
published in translation, please let me know.  I expect to begin the
actual translations shortly, and I look forward to being able to turn to
Mendele for help if I need it.

Subject: On hearing Yiddish dialects

Ikh vil a dank gebn Sholem Yafen [5.124] vos er hot a git vort gegebn
vegn Yidishe dialektn. Thank you Sholem Yafe. I am relieved to hear
someone happy about Yiddish dialects. As a speaker of Galitzianish, I am
weary of prescriptivists telling me that I need to sound like the Yiddish
equivalent of an Oxford don if I am not to be considered a "yahoo". My
parents came from the Carpathian mountains, which, in many ways were not
unlike the Ozarks. When I try to speak standard Yiddish it sounds like I
am being a grade A phony.  The only other time I ever was encouraged to
sound like myself in Yiddish was, happily, by Avrom Sutzkever, who looked
at me in surprise when we met and said, "Du redst an emesn Yidish?"

I once pointed out to our esteemed editor that electronic mail, as a
medium lies, somewhere between speech and writing, according to scholars
of the communications medium. Let us enjoy the benefits as well as the
limitations. For instance, some students of Yiddish, who were limited to
"standard" cannot understand the classic Yiddish films or songs sung by
people who did not learn Yiddish from YIVO. Yiddish dialects are rich and
lovely and, happily, still spoken by those who learned their Yiddish from
their homes.

Subject: Y'kum purkan min shamaya

Shleyme Axelrod asks about several phrases in "Rumenye", mostly related
to food, but there is one I do know:

       Y'kum purkan min shamaya

is from the siddur.  It means "may salvation arise from heaven" in
Aramaic and is the beginning of several prayers said Shabes morning after
the blessings following the haftore.

Subject: kashtaval?

i too thank milt eisner for the lyrics to _rumenye, rumenye_. one
question: is the yiddish word really _kashTaval_? there is a cheese
popular in the eastern mediterranean named /kashKaval/. my husband ate it
while growing up in egypt, where it was imported from bulgaria, but he
believes it was made elsewhere as well, romania being one likely site.
and it's available in the middle eastern groceries in brooklyn, don't
know from where.

anyway, this is the pronunciation i've always thought/assumed i heard in
the song.

Subject: Rumania,Rumania

I too wish to thank Milt Eisner (5.124) for the words to Rumania,
Rumania. Having been brought  up in a Rumeynishe household I can help out
with but 2 of your queries.

Karnatsele is a 1/2 to 3/4 inch round,hard dried out vursht-like
delicacy.Usually comes in lengths of 6 to 8 inches. One bites off a small
piece and chews and chews Take a mekhaye. It could almost be called a
Jewish version of beef jerky, however I think it predates the latter.

Patlozhele in our house was primarily eggplant, roasted over an open
flame-the insides removed and mashed, oil,onion and vinegar
added;depending on taste. However a red tomato was also called
patlozhele. I guess you just had to be there.

A thanks too to Ariane Zwiers for also sending the words to my third
natsionaler imen. 1 Hatikvah.2 O Canada. 3 Rumania Rumania.

Subject: "Rumenye, Rumenye"

One correction (based on sheet music from Metro Music) to the text of
"Rumenye, Rumenye," as posted by Milt Eisner (5.124): instead of In
Rumenye iz dokh gut, fun keyn zorgn veyst men nit; Vayn trinkt men
iberal, me farbayst a kastravet.

the third line should be:

			Vayn trink men, s'meg zayn shpet.

This rescues the rhyme that Shleyme Axelrod was worried about (5.127).
Of course some of the rhymes work in theater-Yiddish (SE) but not in
YIVO-Yiddish (NE):  git/nit, mamelige/meshige.

Reb Shleyme also asked about some words in the song: _karnatsele_,
_kashtaval_, _kastravet_ and _patlozhan_ [probably should be
_patlazhan_].  Romanian _carnat_ [diacritics missing] means 'sausage'; at
Moscowitz & Lupowitz, the long-departed Romanian-Jewish restaurant in
Manhattan (and I don't mean Kansas) _karnatslekh_ were the grilled
sausages that Romanians call _mititei_ (a national specialty).

Romanian _cascaval_ is a sheep-milk cheese that is sold in this country
as "kashkaval."  Romanian _castravete_ means 'cucumber'; _castravete
murat_ is 'pickle'.  Finally, _patlagea vanata_ means 'eggplant' and
_patlagea rosie_ is 'tomato'.  The word _patlagea_, like Russian
_baklazhan_ 'eggplant' come from Persian via Arabic and Turkish.  The
same Arabic etymon gave Catlan _albergina_, whence French _aubergine_.
