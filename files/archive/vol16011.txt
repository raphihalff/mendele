Subject: balas and Old Czech in Hebrew letters

My thanks to Leyzer Gillig and Dimitri Ponomarenko for their answers to my
inquiry concerning the architectural term "balas," and also to Arieh
Lebowitz.  I did some more research on my own and discovered much the same:
"balas" is a Polish word; in English, "baluster" (accent on first
syllable).  Balusters are the columns or posts which support the top of a
railing or balustrade.  I also posted this question on a translator's forum
(www.TranslatorsCafe.com) and got just one reply, from a Portuguese
translator who consulted some Polish friends of hers working on civil
construction in England.  They said there was no English translation, "Not
even some similarity."  So poor are we architecturally outside the
Continent?!

[M. Ruta refers us to the explanation of the word "balas" in the Polish
version of Wikipedia: http://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balas]

On another matter, I asked if anyone knew a reference to an old Czech
grammar written in Hebrew letters.  (My thanks to Roberta Newman for her
very interesting contribution of a recent use of Hebrew letters to write
Czech.)  The reference eventually came to me.  In "The Field of Yiddish"
[vol. 1], ed. U. Weinreich, Judah Joffe, basing himself on information from
Roman Jakobson, says that Abraham ben Azriel of Prague (13th cent.) wrote
the earliest known treatise on Czech grammar, and this centuries before any
non-Jewish writer.  Now he does not explicitly say that the grammar was
written in the Hebrew alphabet, but what other alphabet would the author of
"Arugat Habosem" use?  We also know that at about the same time that Rashi
was writing glosses on Bible and Talmud in French, Isaac ben Moses of
Vienna (author of "Or Zarua" and originally from Bohemia) was writing
glosses in Czech  (see "Jewish Encyclopedia").  I cannot imagine that he
would have used any alphabet other than the Hebrew.  Still, I would
appreciate any further information on either of these writings.

Subject: -enyu

In response to Felicitas Payk's question about the term of endearment
ending -enyu: although I can't shed any light on its etymology, I can't
resist reacting to the inquiry with a sort of anecdote.  Growing up in East
New York Brooklyn in the thirties was like living in a shtetl that was
transplanted into the New World.  When I was about six years old there was
a kid on my "block" named Martin.  Each year, when the days began to
shorten as they are now, his mother would appear at her front door at dusk
while we were in the middle of a street game and call out "Martinyu!
Martinyu! s'iz shoyn shpet un es vert fintster.  Kum shoyn arayn!!"  Today,
seventy years later, I still hear that voice whenever they announce a
musical piece that's about to air on the classical music station WQXR by
the Czech composer Bohuslav Martinu.

Subject:  transcription

In reading a transcript of an oral history interview with a Lithuanian
Holocaust survivor, I've repeatedly come across the expression "dos oh."
Sometimes "un dos oh."  Sometimes "dem oh."  Or "dos ah"?  "Oh" is spelled
alef hey.  Any ideas?

Subject: Multiple Queries

khaveyrim,

What a wonderful community this is!  So many of my questions about authors
and composers have been answered.  You are an inestimable resource and so
generous!!

I still have a few unanswered questions and hope that there is someone out
there who can help me.  I am looking for:

The name of the composer who wrote the music for Y. Kaminski's "Khanike iz
freylekh";

Biographical information on M. Lifshits, (not Max Lifshitz, who is working
currently), composer of "Ven kh'tsind di likhtelekh on, di akht," from
Avrom Reisin's Jubilee Booklet (from the 1960s?);

Biographical information on Moyshe Yvker, 20th c. composer in Mexico, for
the Jewish day schools in Mexico City;

Biographical information on Malke Gottlieb;

Death date for Yisroel Goykhberg;

Whether there is any attribution for "Tsindt on di likhtlekh" other t han
"folk song."

I look forward to hearing anything from any of you mavens.

A sheynem dank,
Lori Cahan-Simon

Subject:  Western Yiddish

My name is Harris Engelmann and I was interested in knowing if there are
currently any Western Yiddish speakers. I assume that Western Yiddish was
wiped out as a result of the Haskalah and the Holocaust; however, the
language site ethnologue (www.ethnologue.com) states that there may be as
many as 50,000 speakers left. I look forward to all of your responses!

I'd like to alert readers to an article on the cultural continuity of the
MORGN ZHURNAL, the TOG, the TOG-MORGN ZHURNAL and the ALGEMEYNER ZHURNAL
that appears in this week's ZHURNAL.  The online version is at
http://www.algemeiner.com/generic.asp?id=2318. The print version (Sept. 15)
has a number of fascinating images.

Subject: Psivitshevski

I recently came across a mention of the play "Der emes" (The Truth) by
Psivitshevski.  I have just transliterated the spelling of the author's
name.  No first name was listed.  Does anyone know who this is?  Is it a
Russian writer in Yiddish translation?  He is not listed in the Leksikon
fun yidishn teater.

Thanks,
Caraid O'Brien
