Subject: "Big"

Sam Weiss [6.299] suggests that the Forward's weird use of 'big' as a
singular noun is from 'godl' rather than from 'groyser'; otoh, he
likens it to American headline styles yielding things like 'Red med to
wed fed'. Re godl, possible -- I THINK I've seen this done with other
adjectives, which would argue for 'groyser' as the model, but I'm not
sure. Will keep an eye open for it... One reason I thought 'groyser'
was the model is that in fact the English rule for forming a noun from
an adjective is close enough to the Yiddish rule that a Yiddish
speaker may mistakenly think they're identical and operate with the
Yiddish rule. (In English, the bare adjective can be a noun -- but
only in the plural, e.g. 'the good, the bad, and the ugly'; 'The good
die young' but not *'The good dies young'... In Yiddish it can be a
singular or plural noun, depending on inflection -- der groyser, di
groyse.)

As for 'Red med to wed fed' -- it's not quite the same since it's
totally grammatical (except for the lack of articles, which is in fact
grammatical in headline style). But 'Big resigns' is not grammatical
for native speakers, even in headlines. Also, the Forward uses 'big'
as a singular noun within articles as well as in headlines.

It's no big deal, btw -- I just mentioned it as something that strikes
me a lot more than their spelling of Yinglish words.

Subject: Camp Hemshekh

My regrets to George Fogel (6.296) and to all Hemshekhistn for having
failed to mention the Bund's camp in my previous post. I was reminded
of it before George's note appeared, but didn't get to my computer in
time. In addition to the less-than razor-sharp memory that accompanies
age, my other terits (excuse) is that the four Yiddish camps I did
mention were each associated with a (tragically) separate secular
Jewish auxiliary-school network, while Hemshekh did not have a
non-summer children's program.

Subject: The English _Forward_ maims Yiddish

Zelig Bach's (6.296) complaint about the subject publication's failure
to check romanized Yiddish spellings with the next-door experts of the
Yiddish _Forverts_ misses the point. It's not for lack of
caring...it's a deliberate denigration of Yiddish to prove the
"sophistication" of the English weekly. Az okh un vey!

Subject: The English _Forward_ maims Yiddish

My post was totally misread by Ellen Prince (6.297,2) when she assumed
that I criticized the _Forward_ "for its transliterations in Personal
Ads."

This was not the gist of my criticism.

As an old, practiced hand in journalism, I would never have made such
a suggestion.

What I did suggest was that the _Forward_ change one single word in
its design over the Personal Ads section, namely: from "Meet a Mensch"
(German spelling) to "Meet a Mentsh" (Yiddish spelling & meaning).

Such a change would have been highly appropriate as shown in the text
of the ad I cited as an illustration.

Jewish mothers' eternal admonition to their boys "zay a mentsh"
conveyed the need and hope that their male child will grow up _far got
un far laytn_ [respectful of God's laws and respectful of people], and
grow up a God-fearing and respected man.

Subject: A vertl af yidish

I just received a request for this to be translated into yiddish:

God loves the poor and helps the rich

Anyone have it on the tip of the tongue?

Subject: Der Dubner Magid

For Mothers' Day:

In my post about oyfruf-nemen (6.295), the names by which Jews were
called up, during services in the synagogue, to the reading of the
toyre, I briefly mentioned the magid from Mezritsh, whose name was
Dov-Ber, a ready-made Hebrew-Yiddish oyfruf-nomen.

I actually meant to mention Reb Yankev Krants, the famous _Dubner_
magid, the preacher from Dubno (a town in old Russia, after World War
I in Poland).

He was an extraordinary preacher, a fiery orator, who sprinkled his
dro'shes with wonderful, exciting fables, a superb verbal
"illustrator" of the tortures in gehe'nem that await those who forsook
God's ways in _this_ world.

Every time a well-known magid came to Vilne, my widowed mother would
take me with her to listen to him.  I was then about seven-eight years
old, her ben-yokhid, and she singled me out for this special treat
from among my five sisters.  She would pre-arrange with a neighbor, if
he too went to the same meeting, to watch over me in kloyz.

Her parting words, before taking the stairs to the vaybershe section
of the synagogue, were always: "Her zikh gut tsu! Lern!"

I felt doubly watched -- by my mother upstairs, and by my guardian for
the day, -- and listened attentively.

However, I failed to see how all the sins delineated by the preacher
and the corresponding tortures in the next world applied to me.

Was I even then, in my tender age, "in denial" of my misdeeds?...

My unacknowledged youthful transgressions of those days apparently
dimmed my memory, and wishing to write about the Dubner Magid I
mentioned instead the magid from Mezritsh...

Vi ir zet, a mamen darf men folgn.  Kh'hob zikh gedarft beser tsuhern
tsum magid, azoy vi zi flegt mir onzogn farn arufgeyn tsum vaybershn
teyl fun der shul.  Itster iz mayn zikorn fartunklt, un velndik
shraybn vegn magid fun Dubno, bin ikh farforn in Mezritsh...
