Subject: aderabe: +/-

In 5.145, Eliyahu Juni takes issue with Zellig Bach's gloss (5.125) of
_aderabe_ as `Why not?  By all means!', arguing, with examples, that the
word indicates `a denial or rebuttal of an assertion or a suggestion.'

_A modne vort, "aderabe", mit tsvey kimat-farkerte meynungen_.  Harkavy
(1898) gives both `all the better' and `on the contrary'; similarly,
Weinreich (1968) has both `not at all, on the contrary' and `in fact; by
all means' [also `you are welcome'.  For the intensified
_aderabe-v'aderabe_, Weinreich has `by all means, with the greatest of
pleasure'.]  So it appears that both the emphatically affirmative and the
emphatically negative are kosher glosses for _aderabe_, making both
Zellig's and Eliyahu's usages correct.  Go figure.

Subject: aderabe, khevraye

Sorry but I must demur with Reb Eliyahu once again.

While 'aderabe' in the gemore, from where the word originates, is always
used to say 'pinkt farkert' in yidish it is usually used in the way reb
zelig used it and that is to enforce and strengthen the interlocutors
statement or question.

For eg. if I say to friend 'efsher kimst di aran far a teler cholent?' he
may answer 'nu, aderabe efsher host di abisl kigl okh?'

Just a small ditty on the subject of aderabe. There is an Israeli tour
company called Hoffman Travel which mainly services the Orthodox
community. The founder, a Hungarian jew, would sometimes come on the
buses to collect the fares and instruct the driver. By the time I
remember him he was an elderly person (he may still be alive) in er
fleygt zikh brekhen ale tsayn over his ivrit. He once wanted to tell a
driver to make a U-turn so he says to him "nu, titapekh aderabe". (BTW
aderabe here is used as Mr Juni's assertion.)

I agree khevraye is used as reb eliyahu describes it though I have never
heard the term rosh khevraye. rosh hakhevre is a commonly used term and
would be suitable for reb noyekh if only he agreed. In belz the head of a
group (khevre) that gathers to discuss khasidishe toyres and mases is
known as a rosh hakhevre.In ger they are known as komendanten. Also in
belz the head of the kitchen is known as der rosh hakhevre. men fleykt
afile zogen as a rosh hakhevre (the food one) hot a vort in himel.

In defence of reb noyekh I would say this. yehoyshie ben nin was a shames
of moyshe rabayni. Legend has it that rashi's father was zoykhe to such a
son because he was a shames in a shil and would sweep up in front of the
oren koydesh with his beard. I also believe that the bal shem tov was a
shames at some time in his life. So reb noyekh is not in too bad company
after all. Let us also remember that this week is parshes noyekh which
has in it 'noyekh ish tsadik'!!!

Subject: Yiddish and the O.E.D.

Every now and then, the subject of Yiddish is discussed on a very popular
board named _Jewishgen_ or the Jewish Genealogical Bulletin Board.  Most
of the members of the board do not speak Yiddish or even know more than a
word or two.  One member of the board decided to post a list of 123 words
that he remembered and even made a contest out of it.

I thought that you might find the  variant spellings interesting because
the submitter appears to have looked up these words in the Oxford English
dictionary.
