Subject: Moyshe Rabeynu's ki'ele

Zelig Bach notes:

>> A ladybug is called in Yiddish "meishe Rabeynu's ki'ele" -- the little
>> cow of Moses our Teacher ...

Not that this explains the Yiddish etymology, but the Hebrew term for
ladybug is a direct translation: "parat moshe rabenu."  Although I don't
know, I'd bet that the Yiddish expression came first.  Does anyone know?

Subject: Moyshe Rabeynu's ki'ele/meshiekhl

From my family (also 'of the backwoods of Grodner gubernye' but from a
town which has a name -- and its own name, Sukhovolye), I know the form
_moyshe rabeynus kiele_ ([kiali], of course).  I noticed _meshiekhl_ in
U. Weinreich's dictionary (alongside _m. r. kiele_) and always wondered
where it came from until i recently read a piece by Miryem Shmulevitsh
Hofman (Miriam Hoffman) in the Forverts (Forward).  (I'm almost certain
it was her and it was there.) She, a speaker of Central ("Polish")
Yiddish, wrote of local children inspecting the ladybug and counting up
its spots, for the number of spots was indictive of how many years it
would take for moshiekh to come.  Thence the name.  (I hope I'm not
misremembering -- creating a folk explanation that I would *want* to
exist.  Someone would do well to check with a native speaker of poylish
yidish.)

Ver volt zikh gekent forshteln az 40 yor nokh der khasene, lern ikh meyn
man vi tzu shpiln etl betl, un mir hobn an etl betl olympics iber
frishtik?

Mikhl Herzog's name shpigl for one of the configurations rings a bell
somewhere in the recesses, and wasn't one called a sher or a sherele?

Subject: Name tages ready to go

So that Mendelniks can readily identify each other.

To be ready for Mameloshn '95 in New York at the end of May, Ashkenaz in
Toronto in July, or meetings, lectures and conferences where Yiddish is
the keynote, we have devised a nametag: a simple, black and white,
computer-enhanced likeness of Mendele poring over a book, under which is
printed "Ikh heys________." We have copied them onto Avery adhesive
labels. Just peel and paste.

We offer them to anyone on the list who will snailmail to us an SASE
(self- addressed stamped envelope):

               Marj and Bob Hirshan
               4643 Sextant Circle
               Boynton Beach, Fl 33436-1546

We are happy to donate the nametag in fraynd\frayndine-shaft (is there a
word like meshpokheshaft?) for all the hours of warmth and pleasure (and
the insights) received from being a part of Mendele.

Look for the nametags next year at the Third International Yiddish
Conference in Miami, March 1-4, 1996 at the De Lido Beachfront Hotel.
