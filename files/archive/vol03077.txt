Subject: Boro Park and Old French

The subject line is to be taken disjunctively:

1. It is not the least surprising to me that G&Sons in Boro Park
should have Christmas decorations as well as everything else.  When
I was growing up about 4 blocks from the store, the neighborhood was
about half and half, Jewish and Italian.  It is heavily Chasidic
now, as many of you know, but the Italian population is still
around.  It would be a bit of a surprise, therefore, to find Sukkahs
decorated with Christmas decorations right there, since there are
many blocks where the Christmas decorations are very visible at
Christmas time. As for costumes for Purim, I certainly would try
G&S, both at Halloween and before Purim - it is an ecumenical store,
even if it is closed Saturdays and open on Sundays.

2. Old French, to change the subject, was written by scribes who had
been trained in Latin.  The amount of spelling variation, even for
the same word in two consecutive lines, is quite large, wherever a
spelling had to be found for a sound which did not exist in Latin;
the palatal /n~/ for example (as in the Spanish `sen~or') comes out
as `nn', `ign', `gne', etc.  This state of affairs lasted for
several centuries, with some variation which showed dialect dif-
ference and some which seemed to be a question of personal taste.
The transcription of Yiddish is somewhat similar, although it
involves two alphabets - it seems to be at least in part a question
of how to transcribe sounds not captured by the Latin alphabet as
used in English.  Even as a linguist who has been trained to use a
transcription system for pronunciation, I would hesitate to insist
on a standardized transcription for Yiddish - even phonetic
transcription, despite what is taught in baby linguistics, has its
national variants! - An opinion!

I agree complete with this (essentially political) reason for
standardization. But for me, practicality comes first: ven s'iz
nishto keyn sistem, dreyt zikh mir der kop. Yo, me darf zikh a bisl
metriekh zayn, zikh oystsulernen a sistem, ober ven me nutst nisht
keyn sistem, darfn ale leyeners brekhn dem kop, tsu trefn vos me vil

No? Why not?

I can understand having objections to the YIVO standard, but I can't
imagine being against standards in general. Please explain.

Subject: Emergency - Jewish lists down!

Unfortunately I have some bad news for those of you who subscribe to
some of the Jewish lists @Israel.nysernet.ORG (mail-Jewish,
JewStudies-Judaica, Kol-Isha, scj, cj-l, ...)

The server has crashed and none of these lists are available.
Hopefully this situation is temporary, but they're not sure. Please
let people know about this.

[Mendele] is largest working Jewish interest list working
now.

Subject: Grobian

In German there is a term "Grobian" which refers to a rough,
impolite, unsophisticated male.  It seems to me that the suffix -ian
can be used to form nouns from adjectives such as "grob," meaning
rough and tough.  -ian would correspond with the Yiddish -nik.  I
wonder if the syllable -ian in German might not also be related to
the name "Jan".

Subject: Sukkah Lights

I first saw "Sukkah Lights" in the sukkah of the Bostoner Rebbe 20
years ago. They were the large sized, colored version that I saw on
Christmas trees in my gaygent when I was growing up in Milwaukee. It
seemed very strange to see these "Christian" lights in such a Jewish
place.  When I asked the Rebbe about this he said that his family's
tradition was to make the sukkah a beautiful and wondrous place.  He
had oriental carpets hanging from the walls and numerous sparkling
ornaments hanging everywhere.  It was truly an experience to be in
that sukkah.

When I married and began making my own sukkah, my family naturally
put lights throughout it.  In fact, all of the Rebbe's community in
Brookline, MA sparkled with the blinking "sukkah" lights.

When we moved to Baltimore 3 years ago, we ,of course, continued to
string our lights.  Our neighbors all made comments that first year.
We just said that it was a "Bostoner tradition".  During our second
sukkos, neighbors brought friends by to see the "sukkah"
lights...and their children were fascinated.  Last year our street
began to twinkle.  I wonder what it will look like this year?

BTW...I've heard it said that a child who has experienced a
beautiful sukkah could never be jealous of an Christmas tree.
