Subject: Englishisms in Yiddish

zellig bach proclaims that '[we] must now, before it is too late, put up clear
and firm barriers against the flood of Englishisms that threaten to water down
and corrupt correct Yiddish.'

1. what does 'our' authority to erect 'barriers' derive from?
2. what is 'correct yiddish' and how did you come to discover it?
3. how much exactly do you think the contemporary yiddish speech community will
   obey our 'barriers'?

inquiring minds want to know...

Subject: Khasidish or misnagid

Has anyone else noticed the similarity between "Der rebbe elimeylech" and "Old
King Cole"?  Merry old soul, fiddlers three,etc.

Reb Hershl Hartman and Reb Anno Siegel wrote (v. 5.248) about misnagdishe
songs which satirize khsidim (in reply to a post by Reb Zellig Bach in v.
5.246).  Hershl said he "always understood that almost _all_ Yiddish folksongs
that refer to the rebe and/or his khsidim/khsidimlakh are misnagdish satires
of khasidism,"  and asked to hear from our musicologists, one of whom I am
not.  But what I can attest to is that although I know quite a few Yiddish
songs used in the contemporary Yiddish-speaking khsidishe community, none of
them refer to a rebbe or to khsidim.  (I don't know of any Yiddish songs used
in the non-khsidishe chareidi community, and even by the khsidim, they're not
as common as they once were.)

Anno brought up two specific songs (in addition to the one under discussion,
"sha shtil"):  "un az der rebbe zingt", and "un az der rebe elimeylekh".  I
recently had a short exchange with Reb Noyekh about these songs, though I did
not bring it up on Mendele.  What follows is what I said, and one detail that
I remember from his response.

Long ago, my father taught me "un az der rebbe zingt" under the title "un az
der rebe tantst", and said it was a maskilishe (not misnagdishe) parody of
khsidim.  He had a final stanza in which the verb was replaced with the
phoneme "ah" (un az der rebe ah!), which was supposed to be the height of the
parody--if the rebe expresses wonder, the khsidim will too, without thinking.
I'm not sure, but I think some of the verbs were not exactly the same for the
rebe and the khsidim--un az der rebe est, fresn ale khsidim (possibly implying
that khsidim use their rebe as a justification for behaving boorishly or
improperly).

The second song, "Un az der rebe Elimeylekh", I learned from secular sources.
I am convinced that it is not of khsidishe origin, for a number of reasons.
The strongest is that the rebe in question, Reb Elimeylekh of Lizhensk, is
never referred to by his full name among khsidim--he is always called "der
rebe Reb Maylekh" (even among khsidim who would normally pronounce it
"Meylekh"), or by the title of his seyfer, "der noyam elimeylekh."  (This
could be explained away by the requirements of rhyme and meter, but I don't
think that's what's going on.)

Another reason, though not as strong, is that der rebe reb Maylekh is one of
the most important giants of khsides, and is spoken of in only the most
reverent of terms--only the Besh"t is treated much more reverently--and I
can't imagine someone khsidish writing a song about him which portrayed him as
even semi-human.  His brother, der rebe reb Zishe of Anipoli, who was much
more folksy and down-to-earth, would have been a more likely candidate.  And
the song has always struck me as irreverent--it reminds me of the nursery
rhyme about old King Cole.

If I recall correctly, Reb Noyekh replied to me that he didn't perceive the
song as irreverent at all, and that it seemed to him to be showing the rebbe
as being human, not some removed mystic vus fliit in him'l.  (Did I get that
right?  Please correct me if not.)  Anno said something similar.  I can hear
the tayne, but I think Reb Maylekh is the wrong address for it.  The only way
I could see it would be if it was written by non-khsidim who were not
intending to mock, and picked a famous rebbe without realizing that they were
picking the wrong one for the image they wanted.

Subject: The Yiddish canon

meyer wolf, what a list! question: are any of those already in electronic
form? (i mean the modern stuff -- i know lots of the old stuff is.) as i think
i've mentioned, beatrice santorini and i have (laboriously) gotten two works
into electronic form, olsvanger's _royte pomerantsn_ and hirshbeyn's _grine
felder_. i know they're not on your list but, if you'd like them for the
collective effort, just say the word. and we'd both be _very_ grateful for new
stuff!

Subject: The Yiddish canon

Meyer Wolf's preliminary list towards describing a Yiddish canon reminds me
that there was another list that the early editors of the Groyser Verterbukh
prepared which Mendelyaner might find interesting. The list included about
2600 books (including journals, collections, multi volumed complete works)
from which citations were drawn in the Verterbukh.  I've lost track of the
list since the time that I worked for the Verterbukh, but it gave a great
sense of the breadth of the literature (as well as some specialized, authentic
but non literary sides of the language, such as technical manuals and
professional publications like _Der yidisher farmer_) rather than just
pointing out the high spots.  Efforts to delimit the canon take the chance of
missing important voices. Meyer, do you know what happened to the files from
the Verterbukh's bibliography project?
