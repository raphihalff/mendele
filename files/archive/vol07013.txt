Subject: Mendele - Sholom Aleichem - Translation

[In response to _Serebriani and Menakhem Mendl_, 7.011]

   Mechl Asheri may be right in thinking he's in the wrong pew. And his
estimate (one in fifty) of those of us - I'm not one of them - in  Mendele
whose Yiddish is fluent and who are well-read in Yiddish literary history
is probably not far off the mark.

   I am grateful for the remarks and examples of Sholom Aleichem's care
in (in this case) lexical selection  in  one of the Ayzenban stories. Not
that this surprises me. But the translation problem  -here,calling an
esroyg an esroyg - is a common and unavoidable one. How  DO you translate a
word (and a context) whose referent is unknown to those reading the
translation. Do you simply call an esroyg an esroyg - without somewhere and
somehow defining it (in a glossary ? footnote ? in 'the body of the text' ?) 
This seems possible sometimes in translations of poems where 'it really 
doesn't matter what the word means'. If Asheri is saying that one can't
read Sholom Aleichem (or Pindar or Pushkin, etc) in anything but the
original language, he's not the first or hundredth to say that. And as far
as translation problems go (see, for instance, the recent comments on Golda
Werman's Bergelson translations) that is only the tip of the esroyg. For
those who don't need translations, problems of translation can be sidelined.

    A Fulbright scholar from India (excellent spoken and written English ,
a Ph.D.in English literature from a British university) was translating
some American short stories into Hindi, and asked me what 'persimmon'
meant. I gave her a persimmon. She said we have no persimmons - no word for
persimmon - in India. Would 'mango' do ? Well, a mango is not a persimmon.
But .. And the associations of 'esroyg' are more complicated than those for
'mango' or 'persimmon'.

    About 'Yiddish faddists' could he tell us more precisely what was
meant. Mendele has taken up recently what Leo Rosten made of Yiddish, and -
somewhere - Lenny Bruce and Yiddish  (the 'Putz and Klutz School of
Yiddishkeit'). There may even be a few Mendelniks who conflate Sholom
Aleichem with Jackie Mason. What fads do you - does he - reprobate in us ?

Subject: Function of Mendele

I feel that I must respond to Michl Asheri's comments in Vol. 7.011.
According to his definition, I guess I am one of those "Yiddish faddists"
he refers to.  Of course, we faddists must constitute by far the largest
group on Mendele, and we are grateful for the posts of such as Louis
Fridhandler, Zellig Bach, and the like.  The hope is that by reading their 
posts we may rise above the level of faddist.  An elitist list such as Michl 
Asheri wants would probably have only a handful of subscribers - hardly 
enough to maintain a list.

During the several years that I have been on Mendele, I have introduced
nearly a dozen others to the list.  I told them that they would have access
to information which could not be found in books or journals.  In almost
every case I was profoundly thanked for having introduced them to Mendele.
As a matter of fact, I save each volume number on my hard disk, and I have
also created an index composed of the tables of contents which head up the
various issues.

I hope that under the new "management" Mendele will continue to follow on
the course which Noyekh Miller has so successfully set.

Subject: Asheri and Fridhandler

[In response to _Serebriani and Menakhem Mendl_, 7.011]

Is yet another "either/or" really necessary:  Mendele is *either* "to
enlighten people whose only knowledge of Yiddish and consequently Yiddish
writers is academic" (whatever that means) *or* for "Jews whose Yiddish is
already there and who have read Sholom Aleichem mit di klayne pintelech"?  It
was my understanding that Mendele was for people interested in Yiddish and
Yiddish culture, regardless of their principal language.  Was that incorrect?
Who is in the "wrong place" here?  

How offensive to be dismissed as a "faddist" because one does not read 
Yiddish well or speak Yiddish fluently.  Who is Asheri to classify people in
this way?  Has he ever read any literature in translation?  Perhaps not...
But if so, is he not a "faddist"?  Does he feel he should be prohibited
absolutely from commenting on or thinking about the works of Kenzaburo Oe or
Eca de Queiroz because he is unable to read them in the original?

As far as Sholem Aleichem's careful construction of the Menakhem-Mendl
letters:  I am grateful to Louis Fridhandler for making information about the
Serebriani article accessible.  The thrust of the article is of course
recognizable to any scholar of nineteenth-century European literature and
history of criticism; there was a long-lived critical tendency to see writers
who utilized colloquial language in their works as walking local-color tape
recorders who dashed off their fiction effortlessly and unthinkingly, af eyn
fus.  (It was only in the 1960s, for example, that the great Spanish novelist
Benito Perez Galdos [1843-1920] stopped being classified virtually exclusively
in that fashion.)  Sholem Aleichem is certainly in this way a typical
nineteenth-century European writer famous for his colloquial artistry, treated 
typically by early twentieth-century critics, and now (finally, again 
typically) being looked at with a new eye and a new critical slant by another
generation.  It is not necessary to have read Sholem Aleichem in the original
to know this.

I agree that careful textual analysis (such as his point about the esrogim
being infelicitously translated) is necessary for a good translation.  But
the fact that not all translations are as good as they might be does not mean
(to me) that nothing should ever be translated.  Perhaps Asheri believes that
Sholem Aleichem's stories should only be accessible to those who "have read
Sholom Aleichem mit di klayne pintelech."

As a lover of Yiddish culture and a scholar, translator and teacher of
Spanish literature (in the original and in translation), I could not disagree
more.  And such an arrogant, condescending attitude is unlikely to
"enlighten" anyone about anything.
