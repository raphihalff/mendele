Subject: "a lid on a nomen"

As a new subscriber, I understand that  I am expected to introduce myself.
I was subscribed to Mendele a good many years ago, but - being more of a
Hebraist than a Yiddishist - I eventually dropped out under pressure of more
pressing matters.

My immediate reason for re-subscribing at this time, is as follows: I have
been entrusted (Why and by whom may be interesting in itself; I will amplify
if anyone is interested.) with the task of finding the text of the poem "A lid
on a nomen" by Melech Ravitch. It was published in "Di Goldene Keyt", 1974,
No. 82, and may also appear in one of his books or in an anthology of Yiddish
poetry.  Any assistance will be much appreciated.

Subject: Riaba

I am translating the original manuscript of Jacob Gordin's "Jewish King
Lear."  In it there is a reference to the "Riaba School" - either a real or
fictional academy in Vilna. One person I've consulted thinks it may be the
name of a town.  But I do not find it in my "Shtetl Finder" and I wonder if
it might be the name of "rebbe" - or...?  Any good thoughts about this
problem would be most welcome.

Subject: All I Got was Words


Does anyone here know the source of the following poem? Who wrote it?
About when? Where it was published? Anything at all about it?

Yehuda Berger

	All I Got Was Words

When I was young and fancy free
My folks had no fine clothes for me.
All I got was words.
	got tsu danken.
	got vet gebn
	zol men nor lebn un gezunt zayn.

When I began to travel far
They couldn't provide me with a car.
All I got was words.
	gey gezunterheyt
	gey melakh
	hob a gliklikhe rayze.

I wanted to increase my knowledge
But they couldn't afford to send me to college.
All I got was words.
	hob seykhl
	zay nisht keyn nar
	toyre iz de beste skhoyre

Years have flown, the world has turned,
There are things I've forgotten, things I've learned
Yet still I remember,
	zog dem emes
	geb tsedoke
	hob rakhmones
	zay a mentsh

All I got was words
Pity those who never got the words

Subject: shmontses

Can anyone tell me what the word "shmontses" means ? In my home, it was used
to designate any set of worthless objects, "tchatchkeles", things of no
value.. A Polish friend tells me that nowadays, in Poland, Polish people use
the word (when speaking Polish!) to designate "Jewish jokes" ! I searched for
the word in Weinreich's dictionary, and couldn't find it.

Any indication as to its meaning, usage, and origin,
would be greatly appreciated !

Subject: Yiddish Scrabble

ikh bin a yunger yidishist un makh af mayn mamen a "Scrabble" shpil nitsndik
yidishe oysyes. ikh darf visn: velkhe yidishe oysyes nitz men merste oft,
etsetere? vuhin ken ikh gefinen epes an analiz fun dem? oykh, iz men mit mir
maskim vos "Grabl!" vet zayn a giter iberzets fun "Scrabble"?

I am a young Yiddishist and I'm making my mother a Scrabble game using Yiddish
letters. I need to know: Which Yiddish letters are used most frequently,
etcetera? Where can I find some kind of an analysis of this? Also, do people
agree with me that "Grabl!" would be a good translation [or an acceptable
synonym] for "Scrabble"?

Subject: Re: Three songs

I believe the sheet music for "Slutsk", which might reveal more information,
is at the Library of Congress. It is listed in Irene Heskes' Catalogue of
Popular Yiddish Songs held there.

Bruce Adler performs "Hudl mitn Shtrudl". It is on his recording of Yiddish
theatre songs. Perhaps he could give you more information if you can locate
him.

The sheet music for "A Malke af Peysekh" gives no hint of which production it
came from. The cover has "A Malke auf Paissach - An Easter Song by Louis
Gilrod, featured by the eminent yiddish comedian of Thomashefsky Theatre Aaron
Lebedoff (sic)".

YIVO in New York may have these folios in their sheet music collection.

Subject: 1908 Czernowitz Conference

Is there anything approximating a proceedings for the 1908 Czernowitz
Conference? I have seen N Birnbaum's and IL Peretz's speeches but nothing by
the other participants. I would be grateful for any information.
