Subject: Introduction

I am a Professor of Business Administration at the University of
Chicago, and a native speaker of Yiddish.  My hobby is to read (and
even give classes on) Sholom Aleichem.  I am also a big fan of
Yitzhak Manger.  Other vital statistics:  Age 59 (biz hundert und
tzwantzig).  One other hobby: I collect picture postcards of
synagogues (as well as postage stamps depicting synagogues or other
Judaic items).  I own postcards depicting well over 400 synagogues
throughout the world.

Subject: Introduction

I'm Bob Novick, age 55, married and living in Los Angeles.  I grew
up in New York, The Bronx, to be exact, attended Stuyvesant High
School and C.C.N.Y., majoring in psychology.  After graduate work in
psychology at Boston University and Brandeis, I taught for a while
at Oswego State College in New York.  That was in the 1960s.  Later
I began work in marketing and public opinion research and now work
as a consultant here in Los Angeles.

My parents came from Poland and Russia and my first language was
Yiddish. I attended a secular Jewish school and learned to read and
write Yiddish as a child, but have lost some of my capabilities in
the language since then.  Three years ago I attended Klez-Kamp in
New York and re-kindled my love for the language, the songs and met
some old friends, including the daughter of one of my Yiddish
teachers.

I'm very interested in communicating with others who share my Jewish
heritage and love of Yiddish.

In Yiddish, mine nomen is Elia, ich vais nisht farvos.

Elia Novick

Subject: Shayles

Sholem Aleykhem, Mendele listniks. Am glad for this list, as their
aren't many Yiddishistn, that I know of, out here in Wisconsin. Have
a few questions for you all, would be glad of any enlightenment you
can provide.

1) Is there word processing software available for Yiddish.
Preferably something that could be used with WordPerfect, or at
least with Windows. How do you get hold of such a thing?  Any other
Yiddish computer resources?

2) Any way to converse in Yiddish on-line?

3) What are peoples' experiences, if any, with intensive Yiddish
courses. I've studied on my own, in fits and starts, for quite a few
years, feel I've plateaued out at an intermediate level--can read
expository prose, and literary prose, with a dictionary.  Would like
to read more fluently, and do some speaking. Don't have any definite
professional purpose for this, just the pleasure of it, although may
want to do some scholarly work or translation eventually.  What
about the Oxford or Columbia programs?  Would an older person (48)
fit in there?

Genig shoyn.  Hope to hear from some of you--for your help, in
advance, a hartsikin dank.

Michael Sweet

Subject: Introduction

I joined the mailing list last week, and have been enjoying the
discussion tremendously, but have just gotten around to sending my
introduction.  I am an economist who specializes in health care
issues.  I have no expertise in Yiddish or Jewish literature, but am
interested.  Quite a bit of Yiddish was spoken in my home as a
child, but I have forgotten a great deal.  I am trying to improve my
Yiddish, and also try and speak to my children.  I am especially
interested in Yiddish language materials and resources for children.
I also try and pass on information about study opportunities,
internships, etc. to the Jewish student groups on campus (e.g., the
National Yiddish Book Center's summer internship), and am happy to
act as a conduit if anyone has information they would like
transmitted.  A sheynem denk,

Marty (Vulvush Lazer) Gaynor
