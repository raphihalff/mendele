Subject: Wexler's theory

Maybe Wexler's theory is wright, maybe is wrong... but at least is
an important investigation about our past.  We shoudn't refute his
theory if we don't have any other (theory) that can take her place.
Let's not destroy ideas, if we can't give new ones.

Subject: Sissle bread, nokh a mol

A year or more ago there was a long discussion of a kind of bread
called "sissle bread" in Jewish bakeries mainly in New England.  I
just learned what I think is the definitive etymology from a retired
baker (and Yiddishist) from Patchogue, Long Island, about 60 miles
east of New York City, Mr. Leo Lang.  He is in his seventies now; I
don't know whether he was born in the U.S. or came as a child.  When
asked whether he had ever heard of sissle bread, he said yes, but
the real name is /tsitsl broyt/; he translated /tsitsl/ as "tittie"!

To explain it, he said, you need to choreograph it, and he proceeded
to do so energetically.  It's made from a very soft, loose, sticky
dough, which is not put on an ordinary baking sheet or in bread
pans.  The dough is made in a large box, 4 or 5 feet square and
about 8 inches high.  To shape the bread the baker picks up a lump
of dough from the box in his wet hands, holds it at the side of his
chest, and "throws it up" and stretches it and fluffs it forward so
as not to compress it -- hence the name.  (A pizza crust is likewise
made with a tossing and stretching motion.  He then puts the bread
on a wooden paddle (the English word is apparently "peel") held by
another person, on a very thick layer of corn meal, but a much
beadier, coarser grade of corn meal than the familiar kind.  It was
needed to keep the sticky dough from sticking to the paddle or the
floor of the oven.  (There was no corn in the dough itself.)

It was much more work to make than the ordinary rye bread and
therefore more expensive, and since it was shaped entirely by hand
it was sold by weight rather than at a price per loaf.  In English
it is called "corn rye", but the corn rye sold in most places
nowadays is not the authentic thing.  Most bakers nowadays, he said,
don't have the time or the technique (or discerning customers, I
guess).  Incidentally, the corn meal was called in Yiddish /indzhn
mel/ or /endzhn mel/, that is, "Indian meal". And the supplier was a
/flowmetsher/ "flour merchant".
