Does anyone know what Transylvania was called in Yiddish?
(T. has many names, in various languages; I'm wondering
which is used in Yiddish)

Oops. "Mise-meshune" does not appear in Nusakh Ashkenaz,
but does appear in Nusakh Sefarad (The Formulation of
Spain) and also in Nusakh Ha'Ari (The Formulation of
Itzkhok Luria).

In spite of its name, Nusakh Sefarad was commonly used by
Khassidim (and many others) in Eastern Europe.  Nusakh
HaAri is used by Lubavitch and some other Khassidim.

in central yiddish, "mies" is also one syllable.

in central yiddish, it's /u/, also.

in central yiddish, it's /meshine/.

i think we see a pattern here...

To Bob Hoberman: re meshine rather than the expected meshune
in the West: It MAY be eastern influence, as you suggest,
but it may also be an "indigenous" feature which we
encounter in several words of Hebrew and Aramaic origin. WY
"sigge" (suke) is one; another is "nedinye" where we would
have expected "nedunye" (nadn or nadan in the East). In
both cases Western Western Yiddish that shows the "i" form,
and not the eastern part of Western Yiddish that borders on
Eastern Yiddish (where the "i" forms are the rule).
