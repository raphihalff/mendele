Subject: Vicissitudes of mame-loshn

Dubnov recounts an episode in "Fun Zhargon tsu Yidish" which in
retrospect seemed strange to him.  It does appear as a strange interlude
in the strange history of the Yiddish language.  In 1880 the 20-year-old
brilliant young Dubnov was in the elderly, politically savvy Alexander
Zederbaum's office discussing the imminent appearance of a Yiddish paper
to be edited by Zederbaum. They both were comfortably fluent in
sophisticated, expressive Yiddish.  However, Yiddish was considered below
the dignity of intellectuals.  It was "shocking" to even contemplate.

Instead, they discussed the forthcoming Yiddish publication in awkward,
halting, broken Russian.  They obviously felt pressured by absentee
trend-setters.  Doesn't that tell us something about the destructive
effects of bending to irrational social pressures from pretentious,
would-be, pseudo-intellectual snobs?

Subject: On the secular use of "Reb"

Received a very interesting E-mail message from Michael Shimshoni.  Among
other things he made reference to my posting "The Honorific Reb " (4.269,6)
and wrote (quoted with permission ):

"I am not so sure if, indeed, this title [Reb] was used so sparingly in the
old country...  I had thought, and am ready to be corrected, that the common
address of someone whose name was not known, or for any other reason, was
simply "Reb yid"...  You are completely correct, of course, that Reb is now
often used in a secular way."

And in Mendele (4.271,3) the very same point was raised, with many lively
examples, by "Reb Moshe Waldoks."  This is the way he signed his posting.  Is
it a pseudonym?  Hardly.  Is it an attempt to be humorous?  (Who knows? --
ver veys?)

May I remark that in doing so Mr. Waldoks overlooked the fact that,
traditionally, this title is used with the first (given) name only.  This is,
of course, a side issue, and is -./).  (I'm introducing here a new E-mail
symbol -./), read:  beside the point).

The examples that Khaver Waldoks brought of the Reb usage are quite accurate,
and reflect the day to day contacts in the old country.

My answer:  You are both right, of course.

However, when borrowing this title for use in a secular context, when
transferring it into a modern, non-religious milieu, we must pay serious
attention to the drastic differences between the two worlds
.
It is difficult to imagine nowadays the role of religion in the life of a
Jewish man four of five generations ago.  Practically from his babyhood a
boy's life was set and pre-planned:  his religious upbringing and education
went on in a straight uninterrupted linear progression to adulthood.  The
slogan "Toyre iz di beste skhoyre" -- Torah is the best merchandise (which in
a literal translation does not make much sense but as a rhyme it was
memorable and its meaning understood by all).

Every turn in the life of an adult Jew presented an occasion to _make a
brokhe_ (to say a benediction):   at the opening of a meal, one made a brokhe
(in Yiddish a slice of bread is called "meytse" or "ha'moytse," meaning "who
draws forth" from the benediction "He... who draws forth bread from the
earth;"  after a meal there was the formal invitation  "raboysay lomir
bentshn" -- gentlemen, let's say grace (note the segregation of the women who
prepared and served the meal); a benediction after answering the call of
nature;  before retiring for the night;  special benedictions upon hearing
thunder, seeing lightning or a rainbow; upon seeing the majesty of the ocean
(after a month's interval);  upon seeing a  great Jewish learned man, a great
non-Jewish philosopher, a friend after a year's elapse, a royal personage,
and so on, and on, and on.

Each benediction invoked the Holy Name, and thus a constant process of
forging a close and intimate bond to Him was in effect.

In a world of such undisputed devotion, it was customarily good form to
address someone whose background or name one did not know as "Reb yid." It
was better to assume that he was a learned man, learned what mattered in
Jewishness, rather than  unknowingly  insult  him.   It  was  a  safe
*educated* guess.

In our secular world, however, things have changed so drastically that we
ought to be very selective before bestowing this honorific appellation.

I believe that the following conditions should obtain before addressing
someone "Reb:"

First, *contrary* to the old usage, when it was applied to one whose name and
background was _not_  known, today we would address with the honorific Reb
only someone we knew very well, with whom we were on close terms of
friendship for some time, whose learning is a recognized factor by all (not
just subjectively), and where there existed a deep bond between the two on
the basis of an idea or cause.  It follows from this stipulation that one can
not bestow upon oneself such title;

Second, Reb only goes with the first name, and then only with a traditional
Hebrew name  (Reb Sol [Steinmets] would simply not do, but "Reb Zalmen" is
precious, is yidishlekh.)  If it is a traditional Yiddish name, it would be
best to pair (hyphenate) it with its Hebrew equivalent in order to lend it a
Yiddish flavor and sound, for example:  Reb Zanvel-Shmuel, Reb Hirsh-Tsevi.

Third, members of the Mendele khavruse are all learners, and in some sense,
since we all learn from each other, we are all teachers.  May I therefore say
that, figuratively, we are all rabonim (rabbis), and should therefore be
careful not to dignify each other with the title Reb, lest there be a sudden
*mabl* (flood) of this honorific, and, I doubt, if our own modern Noyekh will
be able to build an ark...

May I appeal to each Mendelyaner and Mendelyanerke, to _di gantse khavruse_
(our entire learning Society) that khaver be a sufficient form of salutation
and recognition among us.  Personally, I find "khaver" homage enough.

To quote myself from the initial message on this topic:  "I think that we
should, individually and collectively, be very selective before we confer in
our secular world the honorific "Reb" lest by overuse... its locution will
wear down, its shine tarnished, and its value reduced."
