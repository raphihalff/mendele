Subject: Introduction

As editor of der bay, I want to add to contacts. It is sent
10X a year and started as Yiddish activities in the SF Bay
Area.  Now there is (TYN) The Yiddish Network in 78 cities
in the US and 11 other countries.

There are directories of Yiddish teachers, clubs,
Yiddish/Klezmer groups (bands), and Yiddish radio
announcers.

Hope to be a clearinghouse for club and teacher
information. Requests have been filled for teaching
positions, gigs, and speaking engagements.  I do not
charge, but receive contributions to the Peninsula JCC
which lets me use their facilities for our Yiddish club and
mails the newsletter.

No apologie--only a fact, I am just starting to begin to
initially learn how to use this wonderful piece of
equipment. Please let me hear from you. My home address is
1128 Tanglewood Way, San Mateo, CA 94403 USA, and the home
phone is 415-349-6946. Please leave a message or respond on
this medium.

Meylekh:

For mistakl-of (singular:  of;  plural:  oyfes) we would
need to have mistakl in the Yiddish lexicon, which we
don't.  (We only have it, as far as I know, in a Whole
Hebrew chunk -- in _peyrek_ [Pirkey Oves]:  al tistakl
bakankan...)  So stam taking from loshn-koydesh doesn't
help us.  And _of_, anyway, is 'fowl, poultry' -- which I
think is outside the observation habits of birdwatchers.

Daniel (=David Sherman):

The most common equivalent of 'to watch TV' in North
American Yiddish is vatshn televizhn/televizye.  From
natives speakers in whose lives Yiddish has remained the
dominant language (i.e., notwithstanding their move to the
New Country) by speaking Yiddish in the family and with the
spouse (esp. if the couple was together since before
immigration and thus European speech habits were kept up to
a greater degree than among others) I have heard kukn af
televizye or kukn televizye.  (Your in-laws, I assume, are
still predominantly Yiddish users, nit azoy?)  The latter
is indeed a new use of kukn, since kukn is/was not a
transitive verb. onkukn is a transitive verb, but it is a
perfective verb and connotes intense, momentaneous looking
(kh'hob ongekukt dem televizor = 'I looked at the TV
[apparatus]' for but a moment, e.g.).  From my family I
know that 'to have a staring contest' (as kids are wont to
do) is _onkukn zikh_. (The game that I know of this:  lomir
zikh onkukn.  der vos vet frier lakhn der vil a khosn.)

For the context that you mentioned, this would be perfect:
ken ikh kukn vi du arbetst?  (Note that arbetst is
pronounced arbest.)

Prilutski was a Yiddish linguist, folklorist, lawyer,
member of Polish Parliament.  Yidish far ale - pre-war YIVO
publication, much like today's _Yidish shprakh_ of the
YIVO.  Yidishe filologye - dealt with lit., language,
theater, folklore, cultural history.  Also pre-war, YIVO
publication.  Use the Oytser fun der yidisher shprakh -
it's the Yiddish thesaurus and can answer many questions
for the person who already knows and uses the language.
(For instance, the funny question a couple of months ago:
are there Yiddish terms for descriptions of autumn.  Az okh
un az vey iz tsu undzere yidelekh if we couldn't express
anything more than oysgetriknte bleter.  The Oytser has the
words under various categories.)  It's also a YIVO
poublication.  Harduf's dictionary seems very so-so.  The
most necessary dictionaries are U. Weinreich's, which you
already have, and Harkavy's Yiddish-English dictionary of
1927 (now reprinted by and available from YIVO).  The
latter publication has a lot of the less frequent words
you'll find in Yiddish literature.  It's indispensible.

This e-message looks like an ad for YIVO!

We do?  I didn't.  Interesting.  You mean participle final,
like modern German?

Oops!  So I was wrong after all, though it's still dis- + xxx.
Thanks for educating me on this one.
