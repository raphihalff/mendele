Subject: Leivick lullaby

The lullaby by Leivick which Mr Frankenstein asked about, beginning "Leyg
deyn kop oif mayne kni" can be found in Ale Verk fun H. Leivik where all
four verses are printed on pp 63-4.  It is also sung by Chava Alberstein
on one of her Yiddish recording from the 70s. I will give the text of the
last two verses, which Mr. Frankenstein was ask- ing about, with
apologies for my transliteration:"Hob nit moire, ikh bin do/ Vell dikh
not farshtoysn--/ Host genug geveynt shoin haynt/ Vi es past a groisn."
Verse four, the lsyt, goes:"Ongeveynt un ongeklogt/ Ikh vel dikh farvign;
Leyg deyn kop oif mayne kni--/ Gut azoi tsu lign."

Der nes fun yidishlid (Leyb Fainberg)
Vol.33, pp.240, Musterwerk
(mus. Nosn Bieleykin), pp. 241.

In yedn dor hot a rotzeakh
farmostn iber dir dayn shverd,
nor s'iz nishto aza koiakh
dikh tzu farshnaydn fun der erd.

s'iz nor nito aza sakone,
vos zol tseshtern dayn getzelt..
Es veyen altz nokh dayne fonen
oif ale mastn fun der velt.

iz vart, ir fintztere bagrebers!
vi s'gleybt in got a frumer yid
ikh gleyb in nes fun yiddish lebn,
ikh gleyb in nes fun yiddish lid.

vart-zu, ir faldzeers-neviyim,
un ir, nit-gleybike in nes:
tsu- fri  nokh raysn krieh,
zikh zetsnshive nokhn "mez"!

hert-oif, ir klogers un kavronim,
tzu freyen zikh mit shodnfreyd,
zet: oif tzepikenish di soinim
iz yiddish shtarbn nokh nit greyt.

iz vart mit denkmelers fun brondze,
halt-z'rik di moln fun arkhiv:
oib yiddish zol fargeyn in Bronzville,
vet's lebn in Tel-Aviv.

In flam fun kdoishim-blut gelaytert,
vi iam un erd, vi barg un shteyn,
vi ale doirez, ale tzitn,
vet yiddish kein mol nit fargeyn.

Subject: Poem for a Mendelnik

To Ellen Prince:

All of us on Mendele are here as proof of, and a tribute to, Yiddish's
vitality, and a yea! to its rich life and perpetuation.

The moving poem to Janet Hadda was an ode to the pain, the beauty, the
love of a language as the soul of our people, and of the intensity the
poet felt at the loss of 6,000,000 brothers and sisters who can no longer
speak.

To hawk five descriptive lines:

                  Only lonely professors
                  carrying the burden
                  of millions of silent graves
                  as single alien guest
                  in Departments of German.

which restress the aloneness, the burden of alienation, the powerful loss,
and to "infer from these lines that it is sad or bad or something else
negative..." is an improper reading of these words.  To view these lines as
an evaluation of academic management or  assignment of space is defensive and
narrow.

Perhaps linguists see only the particular, while poets adhere to a
gestalt philosophy, to a broad stroke universalist view.

Subject: A few short notes

1. The women's prayer said at havdole "Got fun avrom" is included in some
sidurim nowadays.  (It's a women's prayer among East European Jews, a
men's prayer among "Westjuden".

2. _Peti-meti_ in Sholem-Aleykhem's writing is slang for 'money'.
(Anybody understand its origin?)

3. I don't know where the text of "Leyg dayn kop..." can be found, but a
superb rendition is recorded on one of the recent tapes by Yiddish singer
Sima Miller out of Chicago.  Does anyone know whether she performs live?
I am only familiar with her "album" of six (I think) cassettes.

4. Could anyone tell  me whether the An-sky Expedition exhibit is still
being shown at the Jewish Museum?  and if it is, till when will it be
there? Please respond to me personally:  dovid@mit.edu

Subject: Leyg dem kop af mayne kni--a viglid

Ruben Frankenstein asks about the song
_Leyg dem kop af mayne kni_

I've transcribed the following from a recording, identified as CBS 62929,
sung by Chava Alberstein, (_hobn mir a nigndl_: Chava Alberstein sings
Yiddish Folk Songs). It's offered there as _A viglid_, and designated as
_folks-lid_, with no reference to H. Leivick. I've transcribed it in
Standard Yiddish (more or less), and provided the punctuation..

Chava Alberstein's renditions of Yiddish songs are sufficiently beautiful
to compensate (even me) for her (sometimes jarring) dialectally
inconsistent rendering of the text.

Leivick's _Lider_ are easily accessible, although I won't have access to
my own copy till next week. I'll check for additional stanzas.

Ruben speaks of the poem as having been translated, but makes no mention
of the language into which it was translated. Perhaps he can transmit a
copy of the translation to which he's referring.

Leyg dem kop af mayne kni,

kinder kleyne shlofn aleyn,

Leyg dem kop af mayne kni,

Hob keyn moyre, ikh bin mit dir,
ikh vel dikh nisht farshtoysn;
host shoyn haynt genug geveynt,
vi es past far a groysn.

Kinder hobn shpilekhlekh;

Hob keyn moyre, ikh bin mit dir,

Leyg dem kop af mayne kni,

Subject: Singer's kinder mayses

In Mendele 4.375 Adam Whiteman asked (in Yiddish) about I.B. Singer's
stories for children and their availability in Yiddish in book form or
newspapers. (Please forgive me for answering in English, as my Yiddish
writing skills are poor).

As far as I know, none of Singer's stories for children have been
published in Yiddish in book form; they only appear in the "Forverts".
This means, unfortunately, that in order to obtain them you need to make
photocopies from a microfilm. I have the publication dates for about 40
of Singer's children's stories in Yiddish (various Chelm stories, "The
topsy-turvy emperor of China", "The wicked city" and others). If you are
interested in a particular story, or would just like a list of the
information I have, please e-mail me directly: rsaltzma@nyplgate.nypl.org
