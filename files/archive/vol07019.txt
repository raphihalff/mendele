Subject: Biographies of some authors 

I have found that Pesye Pomerants-Honigboym (sometimes spelled Pessie 
Pomerantz-Honigbaum) was born in 1900 and passed away on August 8, 1978 in 
Chicago, but I was partly wrong: Ms Pomerants' daughter told me by e-mail
that her mother was buried in Chicago but died in Miami. All my apologies 
for such a mistake. (And the exact English spelling of her name was Bessie 
Hershfield-Pomerantz-Honigbaum).

Thanks to Hugh Denman, I've also learnt that Avrom Bik was born in Kobrin
in 1913, and that Reyzl Zhinkhlinski (spelled Rajzel Zychlinski in the 
Library of Congress Catalog) was born in 1910.

A sheynem dank to all the Mendelyaners who helped me!

Subject: Trochaic tetrameter in Yiddish 

	In regard to the intricate use that Leyzer Volf made of trochaic
tetrameter in Yiddish, one can point to a number of other authors, Yiddish
and non-Yiddish, who marched to that beat.  Ansky, for instance, used it
quite enviably in several verse narratives such as "Der Ginem" and "A
Din-Toyre mit Got" (both 1908); (I'm including my translations of both
pieces in my Ansky collection to be published this autumn).  And outside
of Yiddish, one could cite Goethe, "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" (Freud was
the only person who took its subject matter seriously [alas!].  why, even
the Disney version, starring Mickey Mouse in the title role, was tongue in
cheek).

	Ansky's use is flexible, lyrical, complex, and quite pungent--it
was a pleasure translating a lively and evocative meter that was totally
devastated by Longfellow.  I doubt whether it will inspire any emulation
in English....

In honor of this event, the Yiddish Voice will rebroadcast a recent interview

The following is from the Yiddish Voice Web Site:

About Yiddish Audio on the Internet and at our web site: for
the first time ever we are making Yiddish audio available at
the click of a button on the Internet. We first introduced
Yiddish audio to the Internet in May, 1996, by putting a
rare recording of Sholem Aleichem on our web site. We have
recently improved on the delivery process: we have obtained
a realaudio server, and can now "stream out" audio in real
time. That means: you can begin hearing the sounds seconds
after you click, no matter how long the piece you're
hearing.

The material we present at this site will change from time
to time, so stay tuned. We have been receiving many requests
to expand our radio service in the direction of the
net. We'd welcome your comments about this service via
email: yv@world.std.com

Our audio of Sholem Aleichem reading from his own work
appears below on this page, with a brand new introduction by
Henry Sapoznik. And don't miss our Station ID and Intro at
the top of the page.

Subject: The essence of modernity

I'll start with this: The references to Yehoyesh's translation of Hiawatha in
TMR 1.008 (Mendele's companion in scholarship) reminded me of how I reacted
some years ago when I read some lines: in Yehoyesh's translation.  Hiawatha's
grandmother, Nokomis, is often described as _di altetshke_, tsum bayshpil:

dort di altetshke Nokomis
oyfgebrakht hot Hayavatan

[a side issue: oyfgebrakht here means _brought up_, but it usually means
_outraged, incensed_.]

There are references to vigvam (wigwam) and vompom (wampum).  It is obviously
difficult to transport the fantasied essence of that culture into Yiddish.
 More striking to me was:

opgeredt im hot Nokomis,
dokh gezogt hot Hayavata:
"Zise bobenyu, Nokomis,
"s'varemt lib dos heymish fayer
"ober mir dos shayn fun shtern,
"der levone glants iz liber."

As Hiawatha talks to his grandmother Nokomis he addresses her as _zise
bobenyu_ (sweet grandma).  Interjection of bobenyu, the Yiddish endearing
diminutive for bobe, struck me as loving, Yiddishly dignified, but, in the
context of the stoic dignity imagined of native Americans, as somewhat
hilarious.  But Yiddish can't be Yiddish without those endearing diminutives.
 That's how it has been for many, many years.  It's old, but still thoroughly
modern.

Which brings me to Claus Buryn's exhortation, "Let's read something modern!"
(7.018, 1).  By all means.  Go ahead.  Read and report.  We'd all love to
hear.  But there is no need to imagine we must set _anything_ aside.  Our
choices in Yiddish are pluralistic, not mutually exclusive.

To illustrate my point on the essence of modernity: It was a joy to see and
hear (on TV) the indomitable 76-year-old Isaac Stern play his heart out
drawing out the magic of a Bach violin concerto at the 60th anniversary
celebration of the Israel Philharmonic.  The passionate feelings Bach
expressed in the 1700s are as modern as anything composed today.  Passionate
feelings expressed in the Yiddish of geniuses a hundred years ago are also
ever modern.  Works of genius are never out of date.

To suggest that we set aside any Yiddish treasure is a suggestion old and
moribund at birth.
