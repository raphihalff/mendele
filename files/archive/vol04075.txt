Subject: Introduction

I'm interested in the (linguistic) history of Yiddish. I have published a
few articles on the subject, but my current research interest is more
generally in the phonetics of dialects and of language change. People
have told me that I should be on Mendele, and after much procrastination,
here I am!

Subject: Introduction

I am a professor of computer science as well as member of the linguistics
program and of the center for peace and conflict studies at Wayne St. U.
I have a Ph. D. in linguistics from Chicago.  I barely speak and more or
less read Yiddish.  My interest is primarily in the history of the
language and as part of that in learning more about Western Yiddish.  At
the moment I am pursuing some ideas about the history of final devoicing
in Yiddish and about the origins of the -x plural as well as the -s
plural in words of non-Hebrew/Aramaic origin (such as feders).

Subject: Yiddish poetry book

(1.) I recently received in the mail from the author, Walter Artzt, a
lovely book of his poetry - in Yiddish with English translation. Perhaps
I have a certain affinity for him, as his name, Artzt, means "doctor" auf
Deutch. Anyway, it would be a nice addition to a Yiddish library.  My
only comment is that the spirit of the poems seems a little morose.  It's
worth looking at: The Foundation for Future Generations; 393 West End
Ave.; suite 4D; New York, N.Y. 10024.

(2.) To Ali Lemer: Don't worry about what your Yiddish sounds like, or
your grammer.  All of us who are not native speakers have the same tzoris
- and we go around correcting each other (nu, es iz der Yiddishn veg!)
Stay with us!

(3.) Yiddishe Fedder-Fraynt:  Our list is growing, but slowly.  Let me
hear from some of you Mendelnikeh-shraybers out there.  We are especially
interested in shraybers from outside the United States. (I'll be back -
tzu dreyen a kop fun dir alleh)

grandfather's letter, I call attentiion to the advertisement in the
latest issue of the Book Peddler announcing Yiddish Translation Services

Subject: "Comparative" Linguistics

I read recently that in some parts of Japan a person who is steaming mad
is referred to as kan-kan which to Japanese ears is the sound of a
boiling kettle.

This reminded me of the picturesque Yiddish idiom in which a utensil for
boiling water also plays a part.  It is the expression "to hak a
tschaynik"--literally to beat or bang a teapot.  While it carries a
different meaning than the Japanese "kan-kan,"  to "hak (or hakn) a
tschaynik" refers to talking nonsense, to bend the listener's ears, to
complain endlessly, and generally to make for no real reason a "tararam"
(a hullabaloo about nothing).

I might loosely translate into American English the popular expression
"don't hak a tschaynik" as "don't make with the drums," an allusion to
the use of drums by American Indians, albeit without any clear or
substantive message.

Subject: YIVO

Thank you to YIVO Chief Librarian Zachary Baker for the updates on the
situation in Buenos Aires.  The most recent posting noted that YIVO's
catalogue was destroyed.  It sounds like chaos reigns in the Argentina
branch: when will they ever regain order?  What has the New York YIVO
done to guard its collections against a similar catastrophe: are there
copies of the card catalogue, are the most valuable and rare parts of the
collection microfilmed and or held in duplicate elsewhere?  Have any of
the major Jewish organizations pledged in the wake of the Buenos Aires
disaster to be more forthcoming ($) in aiding the American YIVO or
Argentine YIVO to avoid further mass loss of the heritage of Ashkenazic
Jewry?  The YIVO has long been a primary scholarly resource in the field
of Jewish history literature and music, its collections unrivaled in the
field of E. European Jewish studies.  The organization has continously
bitten off more than one would think it could chew out of a deep sense of
scholarly responsibility.  As a past worker in YIVO's collection and a
researcher who has dipped into it's holdings first hand, I am a witness
to its wealth (in holdings) and to the dedication of its staff.  At the
same time I have seen its poverty, and its financial struggle to keep
pace with its enormous responsibilities.  My question: what has been
learned from the Argentine disaster: who will help our North American
YIVO to avoid a repeat of the Argentine tragedy and to focus on its
mission of helping us all?

Subject: Diminutive plurals

I have some ideas about the origin of the diminutive plurals
such as bixlex, tishlex, but have not found much literature
on this.  I would appreciate any references to ideas on
the origin of the -(e)x plural.  Please send those directly
to me.  If anything emerges, I will post a summary of
the responses on the list.
