Subject: KlezFest in St. Petersburg 2001 (Russia, July 8-12)

The Center for Jewish Music of the Jewish Community Center of St.
Petersburg is proud to announce "KlezFest in St. Petersburg 2001," an
international seminar on the traditional music of Eastern European
Jewry, to be held July 8-12, 2001 in St. Petersburg, Russia.

"KlezFest in St. Petersburg 2001," now in its fifth year, is the oldest
Klezmer seminar in Russia. It will include master-classes on Yiddish
folk
songs and Klezmer music, workshops on Yiddish folklore and Yiddish
dance,
lectures, concerts, and two excursions, "Jewish St. Petersburg" and
"White
Nights in St. Petersburg." Our staff will include three world-famous
Yiddish musicians -- pianist and conductor Zalmen Mlotek and singer
Adrienne Cooper, both from New York, and the brilliant Klezmer
clarinetist
from London, Merlin Shepherd -- as well as Leonid Sonts, the leader of
"Simcha," Russia's first professional Klezmer band.

"KlezFest in St. Petersburg" is dedicated to bringing Klezmer music and
Yiddish culture back to the lands of their birth and will include Jewish

musicians from the vibrant centers of Jewish renaissance across the
newly
independent states of the former Soviet Union. It is supported by a
grant
from the Jewish Community Development Fund in Russia and Ukraine, a
project of the American Jewish World Service (New York).

This year we are pleased to announce a special program for lovers of
Yiddish music and culture from other parts of the globe. We are asking

Subject: bar/ben

Mikhoyel Basherives asked about bar/ben difference [10.046]:

Aramaic "bar" (meaning "son of") is not in common use today.
There were a few Talmudic rabbis who are named there as so-&-so bar
so-&-so', but they lived in a time when Aramaic was still in use as a
spoken language, so that's no surprise.

"Bar" is also an abbreviation of "ben Reb", but then it's always
pronounced in full or as "b'reb," not the same as Aramaic "bar."

2 upper slash marks between the beyz & reysh is gershayim in Hebrew,
quotation mark in English.  That's the standard indicator of a multiword

abbreviation in Hebrew, and always occurs immediately before the last
letter, regardless of the length of the abbreviation.  That's how
"b'reb"
is always written.

Subject: bar/ben

Mikhoyel Basherives fregt vegn bar/ben [10.046]:

A little confusion reigns here. It is true that bar is the Aramaic for
ben, but that is a red herring.

Normal usage is ployni 'ben' ployni.

But yidn aren't happy with leaving people untitled so men tend to
acquire
the honorific 'reb'

In writing, ployni ben reb ployni takes up too much space and time when
ployni b"r conveys the same information.

In almost all cases that's what it is : ben reb has been contracted to
b"r.

Not much to do with Yiddish, in which the more common form is ployni
ployni's.

Subject: muz nisht vs. darf nisht

Martin Green says [10.046]:

``The verbs muz'n and darfen mean almost the same thing in the positive
sense; but they differ in the negative ...''

The same holds in English:  The verbs `must' and `have to' mean almost
the same thing, yet `must not' and `don't have to' are quite different.
In `must not do so and so' the `not' negates the `do'; in `don't have to

do so and so' the `not' negates the `have to'.

Subject: muz nisht vs. darf nisht

In reply to Martin Green [10.046]:

The usage with which I am familiar is as follows: "muz nisht" signifies
that one does not have to. "Ich muz nisht essen" is "I don't have to
eat".
"Darf nisht" signifies that one does not need to. "Ich darf nisht essen"

is "I don't need to eat".  The difference is very insignificant. But
"tor
nisht" signifies that one is forbidden to or does not dare to, "Ich tor
nisht essen of Yom Kippur" is " I dare not (or I am forbidden to) eat on

Yom Kippur. I hope this helps you.

Subject: Bohemian Jews' Use of Yiddish circa 1938

I am currently pursuing my doctorate in English at the University of
Louisiana, Lafayette, with a minor concentration in Modern Jewish
Fiction.
As such, my dissertation has presented me this tasking question:  Did
the
Sudeten Jews of Bohemia, as of Chamberlain's Munich Agreement in 1938,
speak shtetl-ized Yiddish, or were Sudeten German and local Czech the
only
languages used?  Essentially, my question is this: Did Yiddish exist in
the inter-war period in the former Czechoslovakia, and if so, to what
extent?  I know of its prevalence in Poland, Ukraine, Russia, etc, but
the
former Czechoslovakia is proving difficult.  If someone there can help
me
with this, I'd be grateful.

Thank you for your time.

Yours,
Peter Melman

Subject: forbidden activities in Gebertig's songs

I am wondering why "whistling" and "raising doves" were not considered
suitable activities for Jews. in Eastern Europe.  I am specifically
thinking of Mordkhei Gebertig's songs.  In "Rezele" the girl quotes her
mother: "feifn, zogt zee iz nisht yidish, past nor bloyz far zey".  In
the
song " Motele" the father scolds his son for running around after
pigeons
instead of studying torah.  I have seen mention in other works of
Yiddish
literature that pigeon raising is somehow not suitable for Jews but
never
saw a specific explanation of why not.
