Re: vatnmakher: I think that Dov Sadan has a piece on this
somewhere. I'll follow it up.

mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. (somehow 'mayn
aveyre, mayn aveyre, mayn greste aveyre' loses in the
translation...)

i take back whatever i said about judgekhe, since i have no
idea what -khe is. what is it?

           I don't know when all this came into Hebrew. I'm
pretty sure Biblical Hebrew does not have negative concord.
It might very well be due to Yiddish influence. I don't
have my copy of Haim Blanc's article "Some Yiddish
Influences on Israeli Hebrew" from The Field of Yiddish at
hand.
 
***************
 
He may be right that Yiddish contributed to negative
concord in modern Hebrew but it cannot be the only source.
Even though double negatives meaning no are not clear in
Biblical Hebrew they are striking in the language of the
Talmud.
 
Thus, we find uses like lo amar \clum, lo asa v'lo clum, lo
clum hi.  See TB Erubin 11a; Yoma 11b, Mishna Nedarim 1.1.

Subject: Der rebbe

Mendele has evoked shards of memory I didn't realize I had
One such is of my Bubbe laughing with some of her women
friends over a song.  2 of the verses went, I think:  "Sha,
sha der rebbe geht/Sha, sha der rebbe geht/ Sha, sha die
rebbetzin tsishpreht/ A tishtich affen tish; Sha, sha bime
rebbe angt/Sha, sha bime rebbe angt/ Sha, sha bime rebbe
angt/ A zager affen vawnt.."

I would be grateful to Mendele for any further verses.
What is of interest to me other than the pleasure of this
memory is the fact that my warm, knishes and chalah baking
Bubbe, punctilious in her observance of the Sabbath and all
other holy days, sang (or at least enjoyed) this bawdy,
"anti-clerical" song (this doesn't seem the right way to
characterize it, but how would one refer to such a song?)
Do any Mendele subscribers know of other such songs?  Or
bawdy stor- ies or perhaps jokes?  Were the singers of such
songs (if more than one) more often women than men?  (I
don't recall my Zayde participating in this)  The joke
tellers are often men, of course; it's the songs that are
of interest.

A final note:  when one calls someone "buhbi" this is a
term of endearment, meaning sweet, honey, etc. Is this a
spinoff from bubbe, who's often sweet, but rarely if ever
called buhbi?
