Subject: Introduction and query

My name is Norman Savitt and for the last two months I have been
forwarding printed copies of Mendele at the eager request of my parents,
Isaac Savitky and Sara Berman, who although not yet official members of
the computer revolution have been enjoying this list none the less. They
both were born and lived in a shtetl called Slonim on the Russian-Polish
border from the 1920's till the war, speaking yiddish, polish, russian
and some ukranian.

During the war they, unfortunately unlike most of their families, were
able to escape to Russia. Afterwards they lived in Germany, France and
Cuba, where I was born. They each speak many languages fluently and are
familiar with many cultures but consider yiddish their main spiritual
core. I also occasionally forward printed copies to my friend Tuli
Kupferberg, who also grew up with yiddish as his first language but in
the New York City of the 1920's and 30's. One of the original Beat poets,
he is also an acomplished cartoonist and songwriter often using
traditional melodies. He also is an avid collector of yiddish songs,
poetry and prose.

My own knowlege of yiddish is quite limited to tidbits from my parents
and from what I can glean off Mickey Katz records, which I find quite
amusing despite a limited understanding.

My mother asks: "Does someone know the origin of the yiddish expression
"Lakhn mit yashtcherkes"? I know it means "laugh with lizards" but why?"

Thanking anyone who cares to respond in advance,

Norman Savitt

Subject: The denigration of Yiddish

Most frequently, Yiddish is made to be cutsie or simplly vulgarized by
ignorant persons looking for a cheap laugh. In the history of Yiddish
among the Jews we find a far more painful sort of phenomenon. Two
examples will suffice. When the great 19th century Jewish historian
produced his multivolume history of the Jews, he refused to allow it to
be translated into Yiddish. Second, Harry A. Wolfson, the late master of
the field of Jewish of philosophy, published an article in the Menorah
Journal in which he bitterly mocked Yiddish, Yiddishists and their claims
to legitimacy. For both and additional instances, see Ritterband and
Wechsler, Jewish Learning in the Universities, 1994, Indiana.

Subject: Translating Yiddish

As a perennial beginner in Yiddish, I would be strongly in favor of a
less ambitious approach to computerized Yiddish to English translation
(than the ones described in earlier postings on this subject).

Digitize a couple of dictionaries so that I can sit at a computer with a
text I'm working on translating, type in a word I don't know (in Hebrew
characters, of course), and have the computer return all the English
equivalents.  A windowed version would be nice.  I'd like to be able to
type in a tof and have the window fly to the beginning of the tof
section, then type in the next letter and automatically jump ahead, etc.
Anybody with some familiarity with standard Mac and PC applications can
easily imagine how to implement the software I'm describing.

Any takers out there?

For the more ambitious programmer:  provide a cross-reference, for words
whose usage is idiomatic, of examples in literature.

Subject: Translating Yiddish

I can identify with the problem that David Sherman mentioned in Mendele
5.033.  I have had the experience of struggling to decipher the script of
more than one letter like the ones David describes.  But one has to
remember that is was somewhat remarkable for someone of our grandparents
or great-grandparents generation to be literate enough to correspond in
Yiddish. I had a student who brought me excerpts  from the autobiography
her grandmother had hand written; it was even more remarkable for a woman
to have done it.

With respect to David Lechner's comments on machine translation (same
Mendele number), the samples I have seen of translations from Spanish and
from Hebrew to English were quite impressive.  Has anyone had experience
with these or similar programs?

What prompted me to raise this question in the first place was the fact
that Fishl had received an impressive response to his request for
translators.  This did seem to indicate that it might be desirable to
have a computer-aided translation program for Yiddish.

Subject: More tuml on Tevye/Tovye/Tovya

Some more tidbits on the "proper" pronunciation of the name. Perets wrote
a story entitled "Zibn gute yor," often translated as "Seven years of
plenty."  The protagonist shares a moniker with Sholem Aleikhem's famous
milkhiker -- or does he??

My oldest version of the Perets story appears in volume 12 of
Folkstimlikhe Geshikhten, published by Farlag Yidish, NY, 1920. The name
is spelled "tes-vov-vays-yod-hey."  (It should be noted that text in this
book does not adhere fully to YIVO standard; for example, the word "Yor"
(years) in the title is spelled "yod-komets alef-hey-reysh.")

Moving to 1947, a volume entitled Peretz in a YIVO Bilingual Series,
edited by Sol Liptzin, calls the character "Tovye" in English, with the
same Yiddish spelling as the prior volume.

In 1984, Congress for Yiddish Culture issued a volume of Perets'
Folkstimlikhe Geshikhten, using again the same Yiddish spelling with the
vov.  Thus, seemingly (at least for this story), the name is uniformly
spelled with a vov in the US in this century.

Yet, in a 1985 reprint of a 1972 English book by Liptzin, History of
Yiddish Literature, Liptzin refers to the protagonist in that story as
"Tevye."  Is this a misprint, or were the two names considered
interchangeable?

As an aside, the 1990 tapes of Sholem Aleikhem's "Tevye" by the National
Yiddish Book Center, read by Shmuel Atzmon, pronounce the name "Tevye"
throughout, and spell the name without the vov.

Does anyone have copies of either story in either a European (or Latin
American) printing, or printings from earlier than 1920?
