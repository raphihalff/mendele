1. Molly Diesing
"Sarg and sargenes"

As an exercise, for my own benefit, and at the risk of repeating myself,
let me tell you more than you ever wanted to know about the word-initial
sibilant in Yiddish.

You're quite right, some German dialects have word-initial [s], but in
that case, they do NOT have word-initial [z]. In the linguist's parlance,
German [s] and [z] do not contrast in word-initial position. German
dialects have EITHER word-initial /s/ OR /z/, not both. Eastern Yiddish
has both (and Western Yiddish in northeastern Germany has something like
both), thanks to its Hebrew and Slavic components, but NOT in its German
component where it has ONLY initial [z], except, as I said, in "say" and
"saydn". I have no satisfactory explanation for this exception but I'd be
reluctant to say that it's the result of "sharing a feature" with
Austrian dialects. I'd expect a shared feature to show up in a more
pervasive manner than in a single word, or even in two or three. "Sharing
a feature", as in the case of unaspirated p, t, k, that you mention,
means that in every appropriate environment, p, t, k will be unaspirated.
No?

In any event, the situation in Yiddish is not uniform throughout. In
Western Yiddish, which is generally coterritorial with German, we find
the following, a reflection of the varying constraints in the
coterritorial languages:

First, in the German Southwest with Alsace at its core, all
voiced-voiceless pairs in Yiddish, except k/g, have generally merged in
favor of the lenis variant: p/b, t/d, s/z, and others are generally
realized as "p"-like, "d"-like, and "s"-like, regardless of
origin--German or Hebrew: thus "po:nim" 'face' = "bo:nim" 'sons', "talis"
'prayer shawl' = "dalis" 'poverty', "zo:kn" 'old man' and "zayin"
'seventh letter of the alphabet" are realized with initial [s]:
"so:kher", "soyen". The merger of s/z alone, realized as [s], extends
further eastward than the others, to include Bavaria and Austria. Thus,
Yiddish "zuntik" would be realized with initial [s]. In contrast, in
eastern and northern Germany, and in Holland, as in Eastern Yiddish, it
is realized with initial [z] (Litvish [zh]).

>From this, I would assume that, if Yiddish had borrowed German "Sarg"
'coffin', it would have been realized with [s] in the Southwest, Bavaria,
and Austria, but with [z] elsewhere; if Yiddish "sargenes" were related
to German "Sarg", I'd expect the same variation. In fact, however,
Yiddish has not borrowed German "Sarg", and "sargenes", which occurs only
in western Western Yiddish, occurs only with [s], even in the North.
QED??? We have no record of the word in Austria at all.

We're still left with the problem of Yiddish words that are not of German
origin, in Western Yiddish mainly Hebrew-origin and some Romance-origin
words? In the South, as we've seen, Hebrew words with initial [z] are
realized with [s]: [so:kher] 'male', [soyin] '7th letter of the
alphabet'; those with initial [s] have no problem: suke, seyder, seykhl,
etc. In northern Germany, however, (more precisely, largely in
northeastern Germany), quite a different situation prevails: Yiddish
retains the historical distinction between Hebrew initial [s] and [z],
but reinterprets it in terms of the familiar German contrast between: [z]
and [ts] thus, zo:kher and zoyen but tsuke, tseykhl, tseyder (or tsaykhl,
tsayder), a phenomenon that extends into the Yiddish of western Poland as
well (cf.German "Sahl" with [z] and "Zahl" with [ts].

IF "sargenes", as a word of non-German origin were to occur in the
Yiddish of this area, we'd expect instances with initial [ts].
Unfortunately, for our expectations, we have no record of the word at the
telling locations. Blaybt a kashe!


2. boby/buby/zeydy

My guess is that these forms and, lehavdl, tushy, are no different than
daddy and mommy. They're English diminutives of the teeny-weeny variety.

One should mention, nevertheless, that there is an area in Northeastern
Poland (Poland but Northeastern Yiddish), towns like Szczuczin, Lomze,
Grajewo (Yiddish shtshutshIn, lOmzhe, grAyeve) where the last two are, in
local parlance, [wOmzi, grAYvi], wherethe final unstressed vowel in words
like "khale, kale, bobe, zeyde"  is decidedly "i-like. I've always
wondered whether that might have been the source of New York's (?)
widespread "holly" bread.

Many years ago I heard a recording of a khazn from Grayeve singing a
Yiddish song about a "kali", rhyming it with "khali", etc. Does anyone
out there know what that recording might have been? Henry?

3. Index to Mendele

Reb Noyekh: Is it possible to create a subject index to Mendele, if only
to be able to draw upon earlier postings in reply to constantly recurring
questions?

Subject: Learning Yiddish

A friend and I are interested in learning Yiddish, but have little idea
where to begin.  Could anyone recommend books, recordings, online-info,
strategies?

Could you point me to some good resources?

I was somewhat fluent in Hebrew about 10 years ago.  I'm not sure if
that will help or hinder.  :-)

We each have some experience in learning languages.  Yiddish will be
my fourth and her fifth.
