Subject: Khaveyrim durch post

	As a student of Yiddish, a student whose only teacher is
Wein- rich's _College Yiddish_, I would like to find a way to bring
out Yiddish as a living language.  As it stands with me now, there
is no one in Bloomington with whom I might converse, and thus the
language seems as living to me as Latin or Attic Greek.

	Of course there is a wonderful body of modern Yiddish
literature to read, but this is a highly refined language not found
in everyday speech.  What I want to know is if there are any penpal
opportunities in Yiddish.

	While I'm writing, let me also request addresses for YIVO
and other Yiddish cultural resources.

	A sheynem dank

Subject:  Prof. Avrom Novershtern

Bob Berk (MENDELE 3.204) asks whether Prof. Avrom Novershtern
(a.k.a. Avraham Nowersztern) will be teaching in the YIVO/Columbia
Uriel Weinreich Summer Yiddish Program in 1994.  The answer, P.G.,
is Yes.  He is on the faculty of the Yiddish Dept. (Ha-Hug le-
Yidish) at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Mt. Scopus campus.
Said department has, at last report, four tenured faculty members:
Prof. Nowersztern, Prof. Khave Turnyanski/Chava Turniansky, Prof.
Yekhiel Sheyntukh/Yechiel Szeintuch, and Prof. Sore Tsfasman/Sara
Zfatman.  (The first spellings given are systematically transcribed
from the Yiddish; the second ones are their names as they appear in
romanized form in the authors' books.)

I believe that the Yiddish Dept. at Hebrew U also has a number of
non-tenured faculty.  Their recently retired Chair is the oft- cited
Khone/Chone Shmeruk.  (Since Prof. Shmeruk spends a lot of time in
Warsaw these days -- I ran into him by chance at the Jewish
Historical Institute last October -- perhaps I should spell his name
Szmeruk.)

For information on the Uriel Weinreich Summer Yiddish Program,
contact Jeffrey Salant, c/o YIVO Institute for Jewish Research, 1048
Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10028.  Tel. (212) 535-6700; fax (212)
734-1062.  [No e-mail address as of yet.]

Subject: Introduction

Sholem aleykhem, khaveyrim!  I've just gotten on e-mail and
subscribed to Mendele.  My name is Kathryn Hellerstein.  I teach
Yiddish language and literature at the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia, and I translate and write about the works of Yiddish
poets, most recently, women poets.

My mailing address is:  Department of Germanic Languages and
Literatures/ 745 Williams  Hall / University of Pennsylvania /
Philadelphia, PA 19104-6305.  Someone at Princeton recently inquired
on Mendele about Yiddish programs at universities -- I hope that
person will add Penn to his list.

Greetings to friends and colleagues, especially Dorothy Bilik, whose
letter about Grade and Singer was fun to read.  Zayt gezunt!

Kathryn Hellerstein
