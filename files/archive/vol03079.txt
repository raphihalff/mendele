Subject: Florence Stankiewicz's letter to the English Forward

Florence Stankiewicz has asked me to share with the Mendelniks a
letter she is sending the Editor of the Forward:

Dear SIr:

     I write out of disappointment and perplexity over your failure
to publish a significant and thoughtfully considered letter written
in response to the pieces by your Philologos on the notions of Paul
Wexler about Yiddish.  This was written by my husband, Edward
Stankiewicz, whose linguistic specialties include Slavic languages
and Yiddish.  He felt it important to counter what he regards as
utter nonsense and irresponsible scholarship, since your writer was
giving it his support.  His remarks were certainly not "lukewarm,"
as Philologos claims to have understand them. Indeed, Professor
Stankiewicz has regretted the excessively polite, overly delicate
(though totally negative) review he wrote in 1992 for Fishman's
social-linguistic journal on Wexler's preposterous theories.  But if
Philologos thinks they warrant public comment, a more frank and
sober evaluation seemed necessary.

     It was a long letter, granted.  It was certainly intended for
eyes beyond those in your office.  Was it the length that inhibited
you from printing it? Would you print a shorter version?  One in
Yiddish?  Please state your requirements.  You certainly do not take
direction from Philologos--or Wexler. You did not acknowledge
receipt of the letter.

     I look forward to your response.  My husband has been annoyed,
but I do not think the matter should sink silently away, so I have
undertaken to write to you.

Subject: Introduction

My name is Melinda Saveleva (last name to be Krushen in 2 weeks!).
I am the foreign languages cataloger at Purdue University, and have
been working on a large collection of Yiddish books that we recently
received.  I have never studied Yiddish, but have heard it spoken
and read some from having studied German and Hebrew.  I play
keyboard in the group the "Lafayette Klezmorim", to my knowledge the
only klezmer group in Indiana.  Looking forward to participating on
the list!

Subject: Answers

1. on grubyan: grubi is a slavic root, meaning "rude", grubyan the
person formation (masculine).  it occurs, interestingly, in
evtushenko's babi yar, as i recall, grubi"y pamyatnik "the rude
memorial".

2. "naked" and "whole" may be connected in a weirder way thasn in
the suggestion, e.g. that a person is whole when by himself, compare
the orgiin of hebrew beged 'garment' from the root 'betray'.

	   although not quite as interesting, note  that "bare" is used in
scandinavian for "only" (like english "barely" which, however, had a meaning
switch almost like "hardly", originally the adverb from "hard").

Subject: Etymologica

[ogul]

	Gurion Hyman asked about connections between the IE root
that underlies Yiddish _ogul_ 'wholesale' and an allegedly identical
root that leads to meanings like 'bare' in modern Slavic [as in
Yiddish _holedranets_, discussed last January].  Max Vasmer, the
compiler of the standard Russian etymological dictionary, denies any
connection between the two roots (s.v. _ogul_).  Although modern
Polish _ogo'l_  (pronounced [oguw]) is spelled with an
acute-accented _o_, which usually reflects an original _o_, in this
case Old Polish had the letter _u_.

[Grobian]

    Dagmar Lorenz asks about German _Grobian_ (cf. Yiddish
_grubyan_, Polish _grubian_/_grubianin_, Russian _grubiian_). Vasmer
characterizes the German word as "a jocular neologism of the period
of humanism:  _grobianus_ from _grob_ " and cites S. Brandt's
_Narrenschiff_ (1494) as its first attested use. Roman Jakobson
calls the Russian word a borrowing from Czech, "due to the popular
book of the 16th century, _Prava doktora Grobiana_, translated from
the German-Latin _Grobianus_" (_Word_ 8 [1952], 390).
