Subject: Gefrishte matzoh

My parents were from Zashkov (Ukraine); steamed or scalded matzoh was
(perhaps after being coated with beaten egg--about this I'm not sure)
fried in oil to make "," at our house--the same Pesach
specialty my mother-in-law (born in Poland) called "matzoh brei."
We never just buttered the steamed matzoh.  ...  When I lived in Rome,
someone in the community told me that in her family matzoh was used as
the basis of Passover pizza; I was surprised; my surprise surprised her,
and she asked "Ma perche non?" (why not?) and I've been doing that ever
since--does anyone else do it too?

Subject: Learning Yiddish

Rob Frantz's techniques for learning Yiddish were a lot like mine. When I
was 14 I started teaching myself. It wasn't till I was 15, I think, that
I got College Yiddish, but what I did was through friendship of an
Auschwitz survivor, I received a book that was the Auschwitz memoirs of
someone from Khust (then in Slovakia, earlier in Hungary, now in
Ukraine). I just opened the book and started.

I learned the meaning of the loshn-koydesh words from repeated context,
and I used a pocket German dictionary (as we all know and I soon found
out, cognates do not necessarily bear the same meaning).

A book that I would strongly recommend to beginners once you get your
bearings is Isaac Bashevis Singer's Der Knekht. I needed very little
extra help.

What I didn't learn until later was the aspects of verbs (Ikh gib a kuk,
ikh kuk; ikh hob gelernt, ikh hob oysgelernt).

Of course, taking formal classes would be a good idea if they're
available in your area. I just HATE school, though. Listening to the
radio and talking to people helps. And "you don't have to be Jewish" to
learn it (remember the rye bread ads?)

Dan Leeson describes steaming matzoh, and writes:

Well, in our family we always called it (surprise!) "oyfgefrishte matse".

We actually did it a "high-tech" way: moisten the matzoh, smear it with
butter, wrap it in aluminum foil, and stick it in a hot oven for a minute
or two. Then eat it fast, before it hardens back up. I used to love it!

Like Dan, I've found that this "maykhl" isn't too widely known, and I'm
delighted to see some one besides me ask about it.

Also, to head off some confusion, I recall from the last time we
discussed this that some people use the term "(oyf)gefrishte matse" to
refer the matzoh & eggs dish we call "matse bray". Lovely, but different
than what we're talking about.

While I'm thinking of it, did anyone else have "matse mit kave" in their
repertoire?

Subject: Learning Yiddish and Harduf

	A) I am currently learning American sign language, and I can
agree with the sentiments put forward by Rob Frantz that you have to
stick with it.  Unless you keep at it you'll be taking 2 steps forward
and two back.

	I just finished my second course, and as I took my test I
realized two things. The first is that I have much more to learn, and the
second is that I have learned a fair bit.

	Learning enough vocabulary to have a converstaion takes time and
patience. Then you have to learn the idomatic and semantic aspects of the
language. It takes a long time, I am learning, but it will be worth it.

	B) I do not like Harduf as a dictionary. It has too few words,
and too few important word. Also, I am not happy with the translation in
general. It doesn't always ring true to me, a native Yiddish speaker.

Subject: gefrishte matses

In reply to the query about steamed matses, my family prepared them
similarly, but no butter in those days, in fact no milk products at all
during Passover. The matses were placed in a bowl and boiling water was
poured over them and then poured off. The semi-limp matses were covered
with beaten eggs and fried. This my Mother called gefrishte matse. Today we
call it Matsebray, probably a Germanism.

Subject: say/saydn

Here's a stab at an explanation for the initial [s] in say and saydn, in
spite of their being part of the German component:

say and saydn derive respectively from the subjunctive phrases whose NHG
reflexes are "es sei" and "es sei denn".  In both these cases the voiced
or lenis ini- tial of "sei" is devoiced (or strengthened) by assimilation
to the [s] of "es", producing [es(s)ay]. When the [e] is lost (and the
etymology disappears together with the subjunctive) the [s] becomes ini-
tial, but is protected from be analogized back to voiced/lenis by the
prevalence of initial [s] in the Hebrew-Aramaic and Slavic components.

to rick gildemeister:

wow! i can't tell you how delighted i am to learn that someone out there
heard, enjoyed, and remembered my wevd presentation! and understood it!!!
it may amuse/infuriate you to know that a famous yiddish showbiz couple
repeated most of what i said (without bothering to mention their source)
a few years later on wevd, but what they heard and repeated was filtered
thru their own prejudices. i had said that sarah gorby, while sounding
very 'bessarabian' to the naked ear till the end of her life, had
actually switched to a more standard dialect, presumably thru social
pressure and definitely against her will, and that this switch was
observable only thru statistical analysis. well, the famous couple
reported that she originally sang in 'tote-mome lushn' but 'GRADUALLY
IMPROVED'!!! i'm sure madame gorby would have been thrilled to know that.
:)

are you familiar with the recordings of isa kremer, btw? also a
magnificent singer and also in 'tote-mome lushn'. and also with a south
american connection... (gorby never lived in s.a. but toured there
regularly and even recorded in argentina. did you know her in peru, btw?)

well, thanks for that very flattering post! it's sooooo nice after all
these years of thinking it was a total bust!
