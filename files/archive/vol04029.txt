Subject: On Philologos and some etymologies

Edward Stankiewicz has asked me [v.b.] to post the following:

     The etymological forays of Philologos in the last issue of the
*Forward* (June 10, 1994) are disappointing on several grounds.

     First, he keeps waffling on the origin of the sub-standard Yid.
*shmolyares* (not *shmooolyares*!) though it was correctly interpreted by
several readers as involving the substitution of the intial *d*- in
*dolarn* with the pejorative *shm-*.The matter would have become even
clearer had Philologos bothered to point out the resemblance of the
ending of this word with such sub-standard playful Yid. forms as
*oygenes* (for *oyg* 'eyes'), *shtivalyes* (for *shtivl* 'boots'),
*volkenes* (for *volen* 'clouds') which I wrote about in a letter to
*Forward* on March 10, 1994.

     Second, Philologos gives an incorrect account of the word *kapusta*
which is not even Yiddish (the correct Yid. form for 'cabbage' is
*kroyt*). As is clear by any Slavic etymological dictionary, the Polish
and Russian word *kapusta* derives neither from the Latin *caput*
('head') nor from the Italian *cavolo*, but is rather a blend of Italian
*composta* (Middle High German *kumpost*) with It. *capuccio* (Middle
High German *kappuz*).

     Third, the puzzling *pachech* is obviously a phonetic distortion of
the Yid. *parech* which in turn comes from the Polish *parch* 'a scab.'
metaphorically used for an obnoxious, repulsive person.

Subject: Germans and Yiddish

I hope that this response to Allan Fineberg's question will be of some
help. Though I am not Jewish, like Allan I speak German and have (by
marriage) many German gentile relatives.  My observations lead me to the
conclusion that Ger- man difficulties vis-a-vis Yiddish have two sources,
one linguistic and the other psychological.

The simpler (ahem) of the two is the linguistic.  Allan rightly notes
that Germans could probably understand a good bit of spoken Yiddish, much
as many of them (from the Northwest, at least) can understand a good bit
of Dutch. "German" as it is _really_ spoken almost everywhere outside of
TV news broadcasts is, however, not one language but a sackful of very
different dialects. I believe that Yiddish traces its Germanic roots to
Middle German (i.e. from neither far North nor deep South), yet it
strikes me as having elements in common with dialects from every part of
the German-speaking map.  For instance, the hard voiced "s" ("z", really,
though the Germans don't write it that way) is characteristic of
middle-to-north Germany; the double negative common in Bavaria; the
transformation of "oe" to "e" or "ey" is found in Swabian, Bavarian and
especially Bohemian (I refer to the phenomenon seen in the Yiddish phrase
"a sheynen dank", which Germans would write, but almost never pronounce,
"einen schoenen Dank").  Thus, even without regard to its Slavic, Hebrew
etc. elements, Yiddish would be "tantalizingly familiar" but also
somewhat strange to virtually any German-speaker.  As Primo Levi
remarked, German and Yiddish are cousins, each of which sounds like a
parody of the other.

This does not, of course, explain why Germans should show such a lack of
cur- iosity about Yiddish.  Here we must look to the psychological.  The
reason why Germans today might feel uncomfortable with things Jewish does
not need to be stated.  While many (especially younger) Germans _are_
curious about Judaism as a religion, their curiosity about Judaism as a
culture seems limited to _German_ Judaism, and German Jews tended not to
speak Yiddish.  Modern Germans can deal with thinking about, say, Theodor
Herzl or Heinrich Heine (the latter _geshmat_, I realize); but thinking
about _Yiddish_ culture forces them to confront in a very direct way the
events of a half century past.  I am not speaking here of those Germans
who deny or trivialize what their nation did; I am speaking of those who
accept the truth and wish to come to terms with it. They can do so as
long as they keep things abstract; to think too much about Yiddish
language and culture transforms the victims of the Holocaust from a group
numbering 6 million into six million individuals.  This can overtax the
capacities of even a well-intended German.  What Allan suggests might be
"misguided politeness" is rather, I believe, a misguided attempt to
avoid the uncomfortable.

As a sort of appendix, I would add that there _are_ a number of Yiddish
words that have been borrowed into German.  The ones I am aware of are
among those familiar to most Americans: Chuzpe, Schlamassel, Schlemiel
(as they are spelt in German).

Subject: Lipe Reznik

I am looking for some information on Lipe Reznik.  He was an aspirant in
Kiev (Filologishe sektsye) and graduated from the Institut far yidisher
kultur in 1930.  If I remember correctly, he also was a writer. (I know
of Shmeruk's _Jewish publication in the Soviet Union 1917-1960_
(Jerusalem 1961).
