Subject: An opruf af Shikl Fishmans artikl in Afn Shvel

[Dear Mendele readers of English: this post will be of interest to precious
few in any case, so I won't make it twice as long with a translation.  It
concerns Shikl Fishman's article in the current issue of "Afn Shvel," with
the title "What will Yiddishism look like in the 21st century?"   -Sh. B.]

Zeltn ver vet nisht maskem zayn mit Shikl Fishmans oysfir: "Der 21ster

Subject: shlemil 

Alexis Manaster Ramer is surely right about the importance of the 19th
century attribution of shlemil to Yiddish, which Nina Warnke happily brought
to our attention. We now know that the word was already used by German Jews
and perhaps derives from an earlier Western Yiddish usage. 

There remains, however, a problem with shlemil as an Eastern Yiddish word. It
was and is current in the Yiddish of American Jews and is certainly
characteristic of "Judeo-American" -- but not all of "Judeo- American" is
necessarily derived from Yiddish. The problem is, what is the earliest
attestation of shlemil in Eastern Yiddish? 

One of the etymologies proposed for shlemil is the Biblical name Shlumiel. 
This name is said to have acquired it's pejorative meaning from the
pronunciation _shlimiel_ in Southern Yiddish and some parts of Western
Yiddish, through the identification of the first syllable with the word shlim
(as in the first part of shlim-mazl). This etymology has received a kind of
stamp of approval through the incorporation of shlumiel into the lexicon of
Modern Hebrew with the meaning 'shlemil'. However the Hebrew usage is not
very old, apparently from the 19th century. Right now It looks to have been
first used by Mendele. But only in his Hebrew works. In his Yiddish writings
I've only found shlimazldiker and shlimazlnik.

Subject: Izn iz er...

I was reading Maurice Samuel's _In Praise of Yiddish_, and he gives the
sentence "Voynen voynt er in Amerike, ober izn iz er fun England". This
interested me: I was familiar with the "Voynen voynt er.." form, but I had
assumed one formed it through the infinitive.  It can't be so: the infinitive
would yield "zaynen iz er fun England". Can anyone give the rule?  Do I say
"Binen bin ikh fun Kalifornie"?  Also, is there an accepted theory where this
grammatical form comes from?  I mean to ask, do any of the languages which
Yiddish has borrowed from use a similar construction, or is it a Yiddish
innovation? 

Zayt gezunt!

Subject: Query by Henri Diament, son of Zaynvl Diamant (1904-1963)

I am passing on this query of my colleague, Henri Diament. He can be answered
directly at: hdiament@research.haifa.ac.il. Many of us know the name of his
father, Zaynvl Diamant, from numerous entries in the _Leksikon fun der nayer
yidisher literature_, as well as from a wide variety of publications in
Yiddish journals.

Subject: Search for a work by Yiddish writer unknown to me

I am the son of the Yiddish writer Zanvel Diamant, who died in 1963. Many
years ago, when I was still a teen-ager, my father read a Yiddish story to
me, whose title and author I have quite forgotten, if I ever really knew
them, and which I am very much trying to find now, for it is relevant to my
research in French literature. I read Yiddish, of course. All I can do is
give a summary of the story as I remember it.I was struck by its naivete as
regards France and the French,which the writer idealized to an absurd degree.
This leads me to believe that he was an Eastern European (perhaps Polish)man
who had never set foot in France, and saw in it only the birthplace of the
Rights of Man,of the French Revolution, the land of liberty, equality,
fraternity.Anyway here is the story as I remember it after 45 years or so:It
takes place in a small town in the South of France, and in which one lone Jew
lives. The town,from the mayor on down, has adopted him and cherishes him.
One day he reaches a decision, the nature of which I have forgotten (Leaving
town?Converting?), but the Mayor in person comes to him to try to dissuade
him, pleading with him, saying:"But you are our very own Jew!" or some such
thing. And the lone Jew changes his mind...That is all I remember. It would
seem that this story was written before the outbreak of the Dreyfus case,
which started in 1894 and dragged on till 1905, but this is not a certain
clue, for many Polish Jews, including my father, continued to look to France
as if to a beacon of liberalism in an anti-Semitic Europe, and this, in part,
prompted his own departure from Poland to Paris in 1928, where he became
disillusioned, but only partly, or else he would not have read this story to
me with an expression of near-rapture many years later (it must have been
around 1950 in New York). Any assistance in identifying this story and author
and getting a copy thereof would be very highly appreciated. Thanks.

Subject: Jewish languages; kharpe

Sam Kweskin asks about other Jewish languages in Europe (_leshoynes_, Sam,
not _l'shonim_). Address inquiries about Judeo-French (Chuadit) and
Judeo-Italian (Italkit) to George Jochnowitz jochnowitz@postbox.csi.cu and
about Judeo-Italian to Seth Jerchower sejerchower@jsa.edu I'd be grateful for
any information that you may able to contribute about these languages. 

Rick Turkel's insistence on _kherpa_ is a _sha'nd@n@kha'rp@_ (or, as we said
it, _a _kha'rp@n@sha'nd@_). _kherpa'_ is the Hebrew form. Remember: 
"lowering of high vowels before r".

Subject: "a shande un a charpa"

Shalom alekhem mendele khevre!

Yeshua Litman asked: Does anyone know what charpa means in the phrase "a
shande un a charpa"?  I recall hearing " a khorbene shanda", which refers to
a "khorben", the Hebrew word for "sacrifice" if 50s talmud torah serves me
correctly.

Subject: Name ' Shirley'

About a boy named "Shirley."  I have a cousin born in Brooklyn of Yiddish
speaking parents. In American, his name was Gerald. But his parents called him
"Shoyl." We, children called him "Shirl." Sometimes, we teased him by calling
him "Shoyli." I assume the Shoyl was from the Hebrew Shaul. I know his mother
came from Lipna. I do not know where his father came from. Just a tidbit from
my store of memories.
