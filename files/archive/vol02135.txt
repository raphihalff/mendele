Subject: RE: emes

The question about the dagesh is in place. However emes
does take a dagesh in t he final consonant when followed by
an affix, e.g. emet la'amittah, or the adj. amitti. Same
with bat `daughter' bittah 'her daughter' (comp. Arab.
bint), as o pposed to  bayit `home' beytah `her home'
(without dagesh).Berl's explanation r eflects the commonly
accepted etymology of emet from *amint-, which, as far as I
know, is not controversial.

Subject: RE: Emet/emes

This is, by now, way outside the field that Mendelenikes
usually take an interest in.  I promise I'll stop after
this.  --unless, of course, somebody asks another question.
In discussing the origin of emet, I suggested it had a
history something like this: ement > emett > emet > emeth (
>emes in Ashkenaz).  Now Meylekh asks why, if the final 't'
comes from *nt via *tt, doesn't it take a dagesh?  "I
suppose," he says, "there is some additional rule governing
that."

There is: you don't have a dagesh after a vowel at the end
of a word.  That's why, for instance, the word for 'bear'
has the singular dov, from *dubb, cf. the plural dubbim.
There are lots of cases like this one.  When 'emet has a
suffix, the letter 't' does indeed have a dagesh:
'amittekha 'your truth'.  (Dagesh after a consonant at the
end of a word occurs only under special circumstances.)

The only exceptions I can think of are /att/ 'you (feminine
singular)' and /natatt/ 'you (fem. sg.) gave', where I'm
using the double t to stand for the anomalous t-dagesh,
which marks feminine singular.  Compare these with /latet/
'to give', which is also from a form ending in -nt (the
root is ntn), but has no dagesh--it isn't fem. sg.  Compare
/laqaHat/ (without dagesh -- the H is the letter khes) 'to
take' with /laqaHatt/ (with dagesh) 'you (fem. sg.) took'.
Exactly how this /tt/ was pronounced is a matter of debate
(among those who debate about such matters); my opinion is
that it sounded like a plain t, while 't' without dagesh
was like English th.  ("Was"?  When?  That's a separate
question.)

Scholem aleichem,

Due to a technical problem with my pc, I haven't been
able to read nor respond to mendele for almost 6 weeks.
So, although a bit late, I would very much like to thank
the person who arranged for me to be send a subscription
form for the Jewish Forward. Thank you very much !
I also lost a lot of my mail, so I don't know who that
person was.

Secondly it's been nice to see that there is now a
second dutch Mendelnik. Wie ben jij?

It sure feels great to be on the net again !!!!

Subject: reflexive (medio-passive?)

Apropos of Bob Rothstein's fine discussion of the Yiddish
reflexive, family lore tells this about my father's "onkl
yoshe" (the Vilna aunts and uncles were called 'onkl' and
'tante', the shtetl (Mikhalishok) aunts and uncles were
called 'feter' and 'mume') who emigrated to the US around
the turn of the century. He was a skilled glovemaker who
actually lived and worked in Gloversville, N.Y. for a short
time.  He had already passed through the Maskil stage, and
was a frank atheist.  This was puzzling to younger
glovemakers who were remained orthodox, but nevertheless
respected both his character and his craftsmanship.
Apparently they too called him 'onkl' (or so the story was
transmitted to me).  "Onkl," some one once asked him,
"farvos gleybt ir nit?"  His response: "Ikh veys?  Es
gleybt zikh epes nit."

Subject: Yiddish typesetting

[This message was forwarded to Mendele by David Sherman.]

I wondered if you have contacts who are conversant with
Yiddish typesetting procedures. I am working on books with
two separate musicians, most of the book (music,
transliterations, translations) will be in English but each
of them also wants the text of each song printed out
properly. I have gotten catalogs from Davka and Kabbalah
software companies, but they are focused on Hebrew
exclusively.

I use Wordperfect 5.1, with Type 1 fonts imported using
Primetype. I also run Fontographer through Windows -- it
has the capability of cating and altering characters, so so
theoretically I can take a regular Hebrew font and alter it
for Yiddish and map the keyboard phonetically (my own
Yiddish is minimal). However, I don't want to be
reinventing the wheel if such work has been done already by
somebody else.
