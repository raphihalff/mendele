Subject: "Simkhe Plakhte" 

I have a request. Are there any people who remember the play Simkhe Plakhte
as it was performed in Warsaw by the Yung teater or people who attended the
Maurice Schwartz production in New York? If so, could they share their
memories with me?

In response to Bruce (Liebe) Denner in 8.149, I believe "lernen" means to
teach, while "lernen zikh" means to learn.

Re: "lernen" for both "to teach" and "to learn" :  

I was under the impression that "lernen zikh" was the best way to say "to 
learn" or "to study." 

Interesting that in English, young children often say things like "she
learned me how to tie my shoes" -- maybe there's a need to conflate the two
concepts.

Liebe denner's question about LERNEN (08.149) can be simply answered:
  Ikh lern di kinder (here, it is used as TO TEACH)
  Di kinder lernen zikh(Here --WITH THE REFLEXIVE--it is To Learn).

Bernard Katz mentioned that he hasn't heard this song in a long while. 
Theodore Bikel sings it in his record, "Theodore Bikel Sings Jewish Folk
Songs." It's been re-released as a CD -- Bainbridge BCD-2507.

Subject: Yiddish in Strasburg

A couple of years ago I was traveling from Switzerland to Belgium by train
via Strassburg and spent a few hours in the vicinity of the train station. 
I did encounter some elderly Yiddish speaking Hasidim who were on their way
to Antwerp- my own destination. I imagine that this is a station on the path
between Basel and Antwerp, a commercial route. Many Hasidim take vacations
in Shveitz. That may account for some of the Yiddish found there. I would be
interested in learning more.

Subject: Strasburg

What memories Harry Krane brings back!
I also served in the Alsace, with a heavy mortar battalion, and I remember 
one day walking ---on the nervous line---through an Alsatian village that, 
despite its white bedsheets hanging from most windows, could easily have held 
snipers.
   One woman leaned over her third story window, and i thought she might be 
the source for a souvenier.
  "Haben Sie eine deutsche Fahne?" I shouted.
   She held a  hand to an ear. "Haben Sie eine deutsche Fahne?" I shouted 
again.
   Again, she raised her hands to define her nor having understood. 
   This time, I reverted to pure Yiddish: "Tsi host a deitsche fon?!" I 
shouted.
   Her answer came quickly: "Yoh, yoh!!" and threw down to me the swastika'd, 
ten foot long linen flag, just as I was about to catch up to the squad.
   Another "lost Jew" with 10th century background?

Subject: Hebrew names in Yiddish

Re:  Pe'rets Mett's posting on the badkhn Yoynesen Shvarts -- is that
indeed the pronunciation of the name, Yoynesen?  I've never heard it in
Yiddish but would have thought it would be Yenosn (accent on the "nos")
based on the usual phonetics.  Also, how does one pronounce the name
"Yokhanan" in Yiddish?  I was once assured that it's pronounced just as in
Israeli Hebrew, accent on the "nan" and all -- which seems odd.  Thanks
for educating me on this,

Yankev Lewis

Subject: Mr. Meckler's _balabe(t)shke_

Mr. Meckler's great-great-grandmothers hapax is no hapax at all [08.151]:
_balabe(t)shke_ (in Zhitomir probably:  [balo'betshke]) is a 'bowtie,'
as I know it.  It's what's eaten with _kashe_ ('kasha, buckwheat groats')
and called by other _varni(t)shkes_.
