Subject: bulakh

I would appreciate if anybody tell me the exact meaning of the Yiddish word
"bulakh" (I failed to find this word in Weinreich's dictionary). I am trying
to recover the real meaning of what my grandmother said about Stalin in the
early 30s "er iz a bulakh" (it was in a Belorussian shtetl).

Thanks

Subject: Third Seder

In response to Al (Avrum) Miller: I don't know if the Carnegie Hall Third
Seders he used to go to had a Seder meal or not, but definitely, just about
all the secular Jewish groups around the country today have some version of
a Third Seder. He certainly should know that in Los Angeles, the Workmen's
Circle/Arbeter Ring has a splendid Seder every year; the Sholem Community
also sponsors a Seder, and so does the Society for Humanistic Judaism
(though the latter would not especially emphasize Yiddish). There is also
another I have heard of, sponsored by a Yiddish leyenkrayz. In New York the
Arbeter Ring Seder is a major spectacle, attracting some 600 people every
year in a big hotel ballroom--it's truly something to experience. Next year
in Los Angeles, Al!

Subject: shmoktelyakes

Khevre--

I'm cleaning up my latest draft of a translation of Sholem Aleykhem's
"Sender Blank" and have still been unable to find a meaning for the word
"shmoktelyakes". The immediate context is a description of Reb Sender's
grand, massive desk.

Any help is appreciated.

A hartsikn dank.

Subject: Word origins

I am curious to know the roots of the following expressions:

1. Ich hob dich in lovitch.

Back home in Lodz and elsewhere in pre-War Poland, this expression meant,
"It's not of importance what you do/say."

2. Kale gevorn

Also in Poland, we used this expression to describe anything that is not in
working order or gets spoiled or rotten, such as a situation or food.

3. 's'Iz mir kalamutno

We used to this expression to mean, "I'm sad/despressed."

I would like to hear from the mendelyaner on these items. Any information
would be helpful.

Thank-you,
Ann Szedlecki

Vegn tales/taleysim: mir dakht zikh, az s'iz loshn-zokher af yidish poshet

saydn s'iz do a sibe (lemoshl, an endung) vos ruft aroys dos loshn-nekeyve,
azoy tsu zogn.

F' Vaismans khokhme vegn "nouns in drag" hot ba mir aroysgerufn a shmeykhl.
Fundestvegn vil ikh epes komentirn: di batseykhenungen "zokher" un "nekeyve"
hobn nisht keyn mamoshes, zey zenen mutvilike terminen mernisht. Me zogt
nisht "der tish" vayl a tish iz a mantsbil oder "di vant" vayl a vant iz a
vaybsparshoyn. S'iz poshet a kapriz fun der shprakh. Far vos ruft men "tish"
zokher un "vant" nekeyve? Vorn "der tish" iz geglikhn GRAMATISH tsu "der
man" un "di vant" GRAMATISH tsu "di froy". Dos iz a gramatisher klal. Mit
der realitet funem obyekt aleyn (tish oder vant) hot es nisht keyn shaykhes.

Vos shayekh f' Itsik Shteyn: oyb er vil zikh aynshparn, az "khoyzek" kumt
dafke fun ivrit, iz zol im voyl bakumen (gedenkt: afile Harkavy fregt dos
op). Nisht keday lang brayen.

About tales/taleysim: it seems to me that it is masculine in Yiddish because
the -es ending is not a feminine ending in Yiddish (except in the case of
abstract nouns like "rakhmones"). The same applies to "shabes", "shakhres",
etc. This applies to "internationalisms" as well, as was noted in Mendele: a
majority of nouns in Yiddish, in particular loan words, are masculine,
unless there is a reason (e.g., a particular ending) with feminine
associations, so to speak.

Iosif Vaisman's use of "nouns in drag" was funny. However, I'd like to
address it seriously: the terms "masculine" and "feminine" should not be
taken literally, they are merely arbitrary grammatical terms. Usage does not
dictate "der tish" because a table is male or "di vant" because a wall is
female. So why do we say "tish" is masculine and "vant" is feminine"?
Because they are in the same GRAMMATICAL gender categories as "man" and
"froy" respectively. It has nothing to do with the reality of the object so
designated.

As far as Itsik Shteyn's comments on "khoyzek" are concerned: if he wants to
continue to insist that his etymology is correct (although even Harkavy
denies it), it's OK with me. I don't see the point to going into it any
further.

Subject: talit-talitot or talis-taleysim

Mikhl Herzog (Vol 10.002) says:

<<Thus, Ivrit _talit-talitot_ is probably a modern formation. The
historically "correct" plural is, if I can recall, _taluyot_.>>

Both constructs of 'talit-talitot' and 'talit-taliot' are old. E.g., "eser
taliot zo al gav zo" (Zavim 4:5); Tosefta, Zavim 4:4, B. Shabbat 93a. Rashi
to the last item says taliot=talitot. "Hayotzeim betalitot" (B. Shabbat
147a).

Subject: Translation of poem sought

Dear Mendelianer:

I am appealing to you on behalf of a friend who would like to know if anyone
has come across a good [possibly singable?] translation of the following
poem,  "Brider",  by Yud Lamed Perets,   (The original Yiddish version was
put to music and sung at a camp my friend attended many years ago):-

Vayse, broyne, shvartse, gel'e,
Misht di farbn oyf tsuzamen,
Al'e mentshn zaynen brider,
Fun eyn tatn, fun eyn mamen.

Al'e mentshn zaynen brider,
Vayse, broyne, shvartse, gel'e,
Andersh zaynen nor di farbn,
Di natur iz dokh di zelbe.

Al'e mentshn zaynen brider,
Gel'e, broyne, shvartse, vayse,
Felker, rasn un klimatn -
S'iz an oysgetrakhte mayseh.=20

Many thanks, -

Goldie Sigal
