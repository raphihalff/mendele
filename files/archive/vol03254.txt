Subject: Yiddish un Vertebikher

Re why Yiddish is not Jewish in English: Let us Ashkenazim not be so
imperialistic as to want Yiddish to be called Jewish. There are
afterall at least two Jewish languages spoken in this country,
Yiddish and Ladino. It is therefore quite appropriate to employ the
language's own name for itself inorder to distinguish the two.
Incidently, I was born and raised in NYC 60 years ago in a Yiddish
speaking immigrant family and to the best of my recollection the
language was always referred to as Yiddish, never Jewish. And I can
assert categorically that there never was a trace of shame in
emplying the name Jewish when referring to our selves or our
religion. Quite the contrary we were extremely proud and militantly
Zionist about being Jewish.

Re Verterbikher: I have a distinct bias in favor of the Harkavy
dictionary over the Weinreich. At the expence of rekindling the
Daytchmerism  debate which has fortunately died down, I  would like
to say that to me a bilingual dictionary shoul simply and directly
answer the query of the user and not have a hidden ideological
agenda. As a case in point if by some chance you came across the
word lezn and you did not know what it meant Harkavy tell you that
it means "to read" while Wein reich refuses to answer you directly.
He tells you to refer to the word leyenen. Once you do that he then
informs you that it means "to read". I for one object to this
ideological runaround. That is not the purpose for which a person
attempts to emply a dictionary. (Needless to say, if you attempt to
go the other way Weinreich will never inform the unsuspecting reader
that lezn is a possible translation of the English word "to read"
even though he know it full well since he has it listed in the other
direction.  On the otherhand if that is your cup of tea, 'khob dir
maykhl.

Subject: Kabak

Since Mendelnikers were helpful last fall in interpreting one of my
mother's expressions, I'd like to ask for help with another one.

One of her favorite exclamations was "A moshl kabak!"  (Being from
[the] Ukraine, she pronounced it "mushl".)  The phrase was used
sarcastically, to call attention to faulty logic on the part of
someone else.  She wasn't sure whether it was a common Yiddish
expression or merely one that had been used in her family.  She
didn't know the meaning of the word "kabak", but she had the
impression that it was something inherently ludicrous, like a
pumpkin. The phrase as a whole, therefore, meant something like,
"[He is arguing his point on the basis of] an example of a
pumpkin"-- i.e., a pretty far-fetched (or irrelevant) example.

Now, the word "kabak" (accented on the second syllable) is probably
of Russian or Ukrainian origin.  I have occasionally looked for it
in (small) Russian-English dictionaries and usually have not found
it.  But once I found an entry for it, with the meaning "tavern"
(perhaps a colloquial or slang usage).  If this is indeed the
meaning, I don't quite see how it fits my mother's interpretation
of the phrase.

Can anyone help with the word and/or the phrase?

Subject: re prudery

It is amazing how old folks of a certain type (zionist labor, I
betcha) say, among us there were no feygeles, and no such term.  An
amusing sidelight: my wife 's people, Hungarians, without a word of
Yiddish when they arrived here, as so many in that part of Eastern
Hungary were long on the land, in Debrecen and east of it, around
Miskolc, knew of such people in their small towns. There was a pair
they used to call Kuli and Shopsie, before the three girls, whenever
there was a homosexual around the company, and they showed up as
friends in the 40s at the house.  They girls never knew till the end
what a Kuli & Shopsie were, o r was, until my mother-in-law said in
the late 60s, We thought you understood: so and so's friends are a
Kuli & Shopsie, because we had a pair of lovers in Kisvarda by
those first (nick)names.  Come on, folks, let us not think that our
parents bought us in Macy's, as I was told for the first four years
of my life, when my uncles and aunts would get fed up and say,
Let's take Yankele back to Macy's and exchange him.  Terror in the
kid's heart!  The kid used to examine pickled pigs feet in the deli
in Macy's, fearing one of those jars would be a replacement for
this bad boy.  Thank god it was not Klein's on the Square!, where
the aunts and all rushed (kid in tow) for the lingerie (underwear)
sales, whole tables with panties bras and girdles overflowing to the
wooden floor there in Union Square, and no shame about feygeles,
either!  Read Henry Miller (a German of course), his early wonderful
essays,  Fourth Ward  and all, for a picture of Brooklyn life in the
first decade, etc. One thinks people were not all dancing all the
time in dance halls, etc.  We have lost the whole public life since
the post WWII years. Alas. But feygeles havent: try the singles and
gay bars, etc, or what used to be noisy discotcques, and still are,
for teenyboppers, on Hollywood boulevard, but not the same, not for
adults, alas... Yankele here with a barrel of salt for skeptics.
