Subject: New subsriber to Mendele

Sholem-aleykhem.

I am a new subscriber to Mendele.  I'm a Yiddish linguist
at The Ohio State University.  My work is primarily in
Yiddish phonology and Yiddish historical linguistics.  I
have been a subscriber for approximately 3 weeks now, and
have enjoyed the interaction.  This is my first message to
Mendele, and I have a question and/or suggestion:

Question:  Is there already a Yiddish term for 'e-mail'?  I
have tried out the term "elpost" < elektronishe post on a
few Mendelnikes, and they understood/liked the term.  Has
this term already been used?  Is there another term in use?

Thanks.

Neil Jacobs

Subject: Truth in advertising

In re: Ellen Prince's "Peau de schmuck" story, many years
ago when we worked at menswear in Sears, we had a standard
patter.  "Madame, it is dreque from Paris, tochus a long
time to get it.  Feel this texture, it is a genuine
schmotte made from one hundred percent rachmones."  It was,
as I recall, very effective.  We knew no good Jew would
ever enter that Sears except to work on commission in
menwear.

Subject: For Manger...Try Miriam Hoffman

Miriam Hoffman writes for the Forverts about every week.
She's adapted Manger for the stage in a Yiddish/English
musical called Lider Fun Gan-Eyden (Songs of Paradise).
She loves Manger.  I think she's also on the faculty of
YIVO/Columbia.

I wonder whether the use is regional. I would expect to use
(or hear) the word "tel", but my mother-in-law (from a
Litvish family) says "hekdish". I don't think though that
the use is 'precisely the opposite'. My understanding is
that communities in Eastern Europe had a communal facility
(attached to the shul perhaps) for the general use of
vistitors to town who could not find accommodation. This
was called a "hekdish" in a fairly literal sense - it was
set aside by the kehile for charitable use. Naturally this
accommodation was not maintained in pristine condition, and
in time the word "hekdish" came to mean any untidy place.
Can anyone corroborate this derivation?
