Subject: Prufrock

I am impelled to make a minor adjustment to Al Madansky's posting of
the Saul Bellow/Isaac Rosenfeld Yiddish rendition of T.S. Eliot's "The
Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" (Mendele Vol 10.053).  I feel that
Eliot's famous couplet "I grow old . . . I grow old / I shall wear the
bottoms of my trousers rolled . . ." scans a tad better in the
following Yiddish version than the way it appears in Madansky's
posting:  "Ikh ver alt . . . Ikh ver alt / Un mayn pupik vert mir
kalt."

Subject: Prufrock

Down the years I have heard a couple of verses of the Yiddish
translation of Eliot's "Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock." They differ
slightly but significantly from what has been posted here recently
instead of:

In tsimer vu di vayber zenen
Ret men fun Marx un Lenin

Ikh ver alt...ikh ver alt...
Es vert mir in pupik kalt

I've heard: In der tsimer vu di vayber zenen
     Ret men fun Karl Marx un Lenin

     Ich ver alt, ich ver alt,
     In der pupik vert mir kalt.

In the latter lines the iambic rhythm of Eliot's original is
maintained. Does anyone have any idea whether more of the original was
tranlated? Many thanks to Al Madansky for supplying what he has.

Subject: who knows Hadassa Rubin?

Hi Dear Mendelianer!

My Polish friends, Zofia and Rafal Borzyminski, historians of the Warsaw

Jewish Historical Institute, are about to publish a 3000 pages
Dictionary of Polish Jewry. Pruszynski and -Ska should print the
Dictionary in the next autumn. I am trying to help them, since they
still don't have an E-mail. At the moment, they have a doubt that maybe
some Mendelianer will be able to clear. Namely, they know the fate of
Haddassa Rubin. It was impossible to know if she is dead or alive, and
where. What follows is - is more or less - the translation of the first
part the voice concerning her (and excuse me for my clumsy English).
Every suggestion will be welcome!

"Rubin Hadassa (1912 Frampol - ????) Yiddish poet. She comes from the
circle of "Lovers of Sion". She got a lay education on in Polish
schools. In the 20ies her family lived in Zbaraz and in Krzemieniec.
Rubin belonged to the artistic circle of "Yung Vilne", and in 30ies to a

leftist group of Warsaw poets. A member of the Communist party, she was
imprisoned (1935). The experiences of that period are expressed in the
lyric "Durkh dratn", that were partially written in jail. Her debut was
in 1935 in the Vilna magazine "Vilner Tog" edited by Z. Rajzen. She
spent the years 1939-1946 in the Soviet Union, in Kirgisistan. Back in
Poland, she took part to the renewal of Yiddish cultural life. She was a

president of the "Jewish Association for Culture and Art", and later
TSKZ in Szczecin (to 1952). Then she was a member of the magazine
"Yidishe Shriftn" (1956-1959). In 1960 she left for Israel. "

A groysen dank  for your help

[Moderator note: Several Hadasa Rubin's books were published in Israel
in the 1980ies and 90ies:
In tsugvint. Tel-Aviv : Farlag Yisroel-bukh, 1981
Eydertog. Tel-Aviv : Farlag "Yisroel-bukh, 1988
Rays nisht op di blum. Tel-Aviv : Farlag Y.L. Perets, 1995

Subject: Thomas Friedman's _The Lexus and the Olive Tree_ and Yiddish

I think khaver Fridhandler [TMR 5.005] is too optimistic.

About a half year, or so ago, The Atlantic Monthly ran an interesting
article on so-called 'small languages.' Yiddish would fit that
category.

The author of the Atlantic article indicated that a minimum of about
one million speakers are needed to keep a language alive. This assumes
some sort of 'cultural matrix' in which the language is imbedded as a
tool for communication in day-to-day living.

Sadly, the Shoah eradicated the Eastern European matrix that served
that purpose for Yiddish. Even the 'tens of thousands' who may remain
around the world, but whose ranks are diminished daily, cannot replace
that tragic and permanent loss.

As much as I love my mameloshn, and strive to give it some life and
meaning around me, I don't have a good feeling about its longer-term
survivability.

In a parallel universe, where Vishiac's Vanished World uses the
Internet, maybe the thesis makes some sense. I fear this is not the
case in ours.

Regards
Yankev Berger

Subject: a fintstere nakht

Is anyone familiar with the content of a Yiddish joke that begins "s'iz
geven a fintstere nakht in braunsvil" [It was a dark night in
Brownsville]?  Some Yiddish speakers in my family used to repeat this
line and chuckle, though they never finished the joke.  I presume it
was considered somewhat off color.

p.s. The late Shloyme Axelrod z"l apparently posted a question about
this joke on Mendele some years ago, but I wasn't able to find any
response to his query in the archives.
