Subject: Yiddish books for young children

Joel Maxman asks about Yiddish books for young children. I agree that the
NYBC computer printout doesn't tell you a whole lot. I highly recommend
books by Leon Elbe. Fun Kleyne Kinders Vegn is an excellent collection of
short stories, each one appropriate for a bedtime story (and short enough
that if your Yiddish reading fluency isn't that great you'll still get
through it). They're peppered with doggerel (hunterel?:-), little catchy
poems and songs that are part of each story.

Yingele Ringele (or is it Ingele Ringele?) is a novel with separable
chapters, also each appropriate for bedtime reading, about a little boy
who has a magic ring that takes him on various adventures. Elbe's
pro-labour message comes through, but even a hardcore right-winger like
me doesn't mind.

These aren't for kids who only speak a little Yiddish; they presume
reasonable comprehension.

Enjoy!

(Our kids can still chant: "Berele kaperele, lokshn d'rerele, gey in vald
un khap a berele, gey in vald un rays oys a merele, gey tsum shnayder un
nem a sherele. Berle kaperele, lokshn d'rerele!" Used when one kid is
sulking and the others decide to pick on him or her.)

And a P.S. to Allan Fineberg's post about having fun with our kids when
we visited New Jersey recently: thanks to the shames for allowing me to
post the request that Allan responded to. We got to visit NYC, make new
friends, and treat the Finebergs to our Yiddish-speaking kids all in one.
Yasherkoyekh noyekh!

Subject: Shlak

Responding to Sylvan Beer's interesting note on "shlak,":  in or out of
the sukkah,"shlok" (per Weinreich) means "stroke."  Just don't have one,
anywhere.

Subject: Shlak

Just to put in my two cents about the Shlak Question, I agree that to
wish that a shlak tref someone is not so much to wish that a suke roof
fall on him as to wish that he have a stroke or apoplectic fit, or that
bad things in general happen to him. By the way, Harkavy also defines
shlak as a dove-cote or pigeon-house.

Subject: Yiddish software

yasher koyekh to Uri Postavsky's efforts to introduce software that would
allow Mendele to accomodate yidishe oysyes.

A warning, however, to some of those in the techno-vanguard. I've just
discovered to my dismay that Dagesh, which I believe is the most popular
Hebrew-character wordprocessor, will _not_ work under Windows 95. I
thought it was just my installation; however a message from the people at
Davka in Chicago, who distribute Dagesh, confirms it. Somebody is
supposedly working on an upgrade, but I wasn't encouraged to hold my
breath ...

Subject: Uts--a yidish vort oder nit?

I am passing on a query from the Dictionary of American Regional English,
concerning the word "utz," meaning a (usu. metaphorical) shove or nudge,
e.g. "I need to give him an utz about getting that job done."  It is
apparently most common among Jewish Americans, but no likely Yiddish
etymon is to be found in the standard references that I've checked.
There is a German dialect word "utzen" meaning to tease, that may be
related.  Anyone with comments or ideas on this?

Subject: Yiddish activities in October

I am a regular reader of Mendele, and although I haven't introduced
myself yet, I will, I will.  Right now I have a question that someone out
there might help me with.  I will have some time to spare in October
(it's a long story) and would like to spend a week or so at some Yiddish
activity (class, workshop, discussion group, cultural happening, etc.).
If anyone out there knows of such, I would appreciate your contacting me
at 	bratch@stmarys-ca.edu
Important note:  This is a borrowed address.  (How else would a nice
Jewish boy be at St. Marys?)  So in the subject line, include the name
MOISHE please. (I used this "flag" even before I joined Mendele.)

Thanks for any help.

Martin Lindauer
