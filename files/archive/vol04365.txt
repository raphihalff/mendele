Subject: Gel and fiftsn

In Old High German the adjective _gelo_ is a so-called _wa/wo_ stem
(only a handful of adj. belong to this class).  The Nom.sg. has the
ending -o, the oblique cases have -w+vowel: so, gelo (N.sg.) vs.
gelwes (G.sg.). In Middle High German a new paradigm was created
based on the oblique cases and the _w_ strengthened to a stop and
was reanalyzed as part of the stem, hence Modern German: gelb-er,
gelb-es, etc... In many German dialects, however, the Nom. sg.
was generalized, the final unstressed vowel was reduced to schwa,
and in many cases dropped out.  This is presumably also the scenario
for Yiddish.  In Standard Dutch the word is <geel>, the result of
lengthening of the stem vowel in open syllable, a change that preceded
final vowel deletion.  Some Dutch dialects (my own West Flemish
dialect included) still have _gelw@_.  So once again the different
stages in the historical development of an item are reflected in
the current geographical landscape of Germanic.(cf. also yellow)

ad _fuftsn_:in the history of germanic deletion of an [n] before
a fricative is well-known: compare German <uns> and English <us>.
Notice that Yiddish has a schwa in five: [fin@f] but not in fifteen.
The condition for n-drop is that the nasal and the fricative be
tautosyllabic. In many cases the vowel preceding the nasal lengthened
compensatorily after n-drop: Dutch is a good illustration, both
<vijf> and <vijftien> evince nasal deletion and vowel lengthening.
My guess is that in Northeastern Yiddish the i~u alternation is the
result of n-retention vs. n-deletion + lengthening, only NEY has lost
the short-long distinction in its vowels.

Subject: History of _gel_ 'yellow' and _fuftsn_

Dovid Braun:

The final b in German "gelb" is a recent developement which doesn't
appear before the 15th century.  A number of dialects, as well as Dutch,
still have "geel" in various spellings.

As for the vowel change from "finef" to "fuftsn" (also "fuftsik"), a
number of contemporary German dialects show the same phenomenon. It
appears in dialects as diverse as Bavarian and Berlin, and only the
composite forms lose the umlaut, never the basic number.

Subject: Khil, srul, shmil(ik), etc.

Ellen Prince:

In those dialects with long vowels, the post-tonic /e/ of names ending in
-el drops out, while the stressed vowel lengthens, thus: /khi:l, shmi:l,
sru:l/ etc.  In those dialects, the diminutive (or further diminutive) is
with -ik:  /khi:lik/, etc. In litvish Yiddish, there are no long vowels,
and different things happen:  I don't know for sure about _yekhiel_
(although I think it's /khi'el/ -- bisyllabic), but _shmu'el_ remains
bisyllabic and, in some subdialects (e.g. mine), hiatus-breaking y
enters:  [shmuyel].  (M. Herzog mentioned once a further litvicization:
pre-/y/ lowering to yield [shmoyel].)  _yisro'el_ is [yisro'(y)el] and,
so I've been told, [yisro'l] -- again in a subdialect of litvish.  For
litvakes, the diminutive suffix is more frequently -ke, and in these
cases the above-mentioned /e/ deletes:  srolke (vs. srulik), shmulke (vs.
shmilik).

And wrt _elye_ as litvish only -- that puzzled me too. E. Juni is called
Eliko, Eleshi by his grandmothers since these are the further diminutive
forms of Elye.  (That is, it might be pronounced /elye, eli, eLe/ where
the "L" stands for 'light /l/', but they're all forms of the name
standardly transcribed _elye_.)  Litvish diminutives of _elye_ are
/eLtshik, elinke/.

Subject: A Yiddish name

Ellen Prince in her discussion of Yiddish names also mentions:

>re stress, what about this: my father was yekhiyl.. and i never heard
>any real diminutive form. is there one?

The brother of our first President Chaim Weizmann and the father of our
present President Ezer Weizman was also a "Yekhiyel", who lived in Haifa
(as I did then) and was known as *Khilik*.   Could that be the diminutive
form Ellen asked for?

Subject: Khosn-kale

Shleyme Axelrod discusses the uses of khosn and kale:

>Dvorah's impression that _khosn_ and _kale_ are what the couple are
>called from the engagement until after the ceremony is corroborated by
>Weinreich who translates _khosn_ 'bridegroom(-to-be), fiance' and _kale_
>'bride(-to-be), fiancee'.

This  is also  the  usage  in Israeli  Hebrew  (hatan-khatan and  kala
respectively).  I  enjoyed making  use of the  other meaning  of these
words.  When one of my sons got married I told  him after the wedding
that from then on my relation to  that lady will be the  same as his
were till  then.  He was slightly  concerned, I do not  remember if he
blushed, till I pointed out that from now on she was my kala=daughter-
in-law (shnur?).

This double meaning of the terms hatan and kala can be found already in
the Tanakh.
