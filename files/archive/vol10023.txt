Subject: Volhynian dialect

The pronounciation that H.Sapoznik ascribes to Rovno is actually common
everywhere in the Ukraine: nuvnt-nivnter/close-closer. I think the question
about Volhynian dialect is more complicated than "zugn, kimen and shtitl".
Our theater was said to perform in this dialect, but I wonder whether this
theatrical dialect exists anywhere at all. Saying "i", where it would be
"ey" in Odes, Proskerev, or Keshenev, is widespread across all other
Ukrainian gubernyes. For example, in Shpole (Der Shpoler Zeyde reb
Arye-Leyb, Itsik Fefer), which is in Kiever gubernye: "mome/tote, kimen,
zugn, vig (way)/shtitl, obm (have), blimen (flowers), etc." On the other
hand, in Kupel (Khayim Beyder, Aleksander Lizen), which is in Volhynia:
"mome/tote, kimen, zugn"; in Korosten or Zhitomir, which is also in
Volhynia: "Shleyme/meyre (fear), kimen, babe (nit bobe), zugn, shtirn
(forehead; but shtern - star)/shtitl, etc.". I guess the latter is how
Shulem-Aleykhem would have said it.

Subject: Yiddish in the camps

Re Yiddish in the camps:
The (Hungarian-born) narrator of Imre Kertesz' _Fateless_ (translated by CC
Wilson & KM Wilson, 1992, Northwestern Illinois Press) is told by
Carpatho-Russian fellow inmates, upon admitting to not speaking Yiddish:
"Di bist kein Yid, di bist a sheigetz' .

efsher zol ikh enfern mayn eygene frage; ken zayn az er hot gemeynt "a ki

to his students... s'iz mir nit azoy poshet un gor nit azoy klor.

Subject: shoklen; upbeat stories

I'm new here and I have 2 questions:

1. Men davening. They rock and bob. The verb shokelt: is it
transitive: shokelt sich?  or not?

2. We like to take turns reading Jewish stories at the holidays. I rewrote
Mordechai Spector's delightful "A Meal for the Poor" into a play format, so
we can go around the table at Pesach after the meal, reading the parts. But
it's the only happy story I can find in the (translated into English)
Yiddish literature. (I can't read Hebrew). Do you know of any other upbeat
Yiddish stories, preferably with lots of colorful characters? We think of
Sholom Aleichem as a warm, zestful, loving writer, which he is, but in
truth, in substance his stories are all very sad. And with good reason. But
not good for happy hour.

Thanks,

Earl Callen

Subject: Maurice Schwartz webpage

I would like to announce that I have added a page to the Sudilkov Online
Landsmanshaft website dealing with one of its famous sons; Maurice SCHWARTZ.
Along with a brief bio, there is a link to a clip of him in the 1939 movie
"Tevye"

Take a look:

Subject: shmir zikh oys di shikh

I received this answer to my post (10.022) from a Mendelist:

    The expression is "A dank, a dank.  Shmer zikh oys di shikh un shtel
    arayn in shank."  Literally it means "Thanks.  Thanks.  Smear your shoes
    [with it] and put them in the closet."  Figuratively it means the same
    as "Your thanks and $1.50 will get me on the subway."

Subject: Y.L. Peretz in Spanish

I am looking for any information about the existence of Y.L. Peretz work
translated into Spanish. Aa far as I remember, I had seen  only small and
sporadic fragments in my young years in Argentine. Nowadays, here in Israel,
I did not find any of them in that language. Shall somebody illustrate me
about such translations, the editorial/s, addresses, and any complementary
information, I will be deeply thankful.

Ich hob kein kanntschaft vegn maizes oder geschiktes geschribn by Yitzok
Leib Peretz, un zu Spanisch ibergezetzn, Eib est is imetzer tsewishn die
chaverim, wo kann mich helfn zu gefinnen oder zu trefn verlage oder
addressn, will ich getrai un dankfil sein.

Seit mir moikhel far main Yiddish: Ich hob tzuruk gekommen tzu mein
mammelushn far tzwei yorn, nach a fuftzig yorn "shvitat-lashon". "Starei iak
maliei", hat mein bobe gesogt in hir "goiesh" (Ukranian dialectal form).

Subject: Women Professionals in Eastern Europe

I have run across three independent instances of documentation in which
talented Jewish women, in pre- WW I Eastern Europe (Czarist Russia), found
an outlet for their ability as dentists.

I wonder if this may not be coincidental.

Does anyone know, or have a theory, as to why this might have been a pursuit
that would have seemed either more attractive or easy for Jewish women to
pursue?

Subject: kale gevorn

Mikhl Herzog (10.015) says that my unique interpretation of  "Kahle gevoren"
needs an interpretation of his phrase "di kahle iz kayle gevorn"....I think
Mikhl has created a yiddish pun.

Of  course some cynics might interpret that phrase as the  reason for the
large divorce rate.<g>
