Subject: mir zenen vi feygelekh fraye

In response to Pearl Schif's question, the song that begins "mir zenen vi
feygelekh fraye" is the anthem of the Beis Yankev orthodox girls' schools
founded by Sarah Shnirer in Cracow in 1917.  The words are by Eliezer
Schindler.

mir zenen vi feygelekh fraye
mir zenen vi blimlekh in feld
mir zenen khaveres [sic] getraye
mir kinder fun yankevs getselt.

mir lernen un zingen tsuzamen
mir lebn in fridn banand
keyn soyne bay undz nit faranen
dir toyre zi iz undzer band

mir zenen getray undzer boyre
mir hitn zayn heylik gebot
mir shvern tsu haltn di toyre
tsu dinen dem eyntsikn got

[Lucas Bruyn, 14.037, writes]:

"The poem is called 'nokhn khirurgishn tish'. Why 'after' and not 'on'?"

I thought nokh could have the sense in Yiddish of "toward" or "to" with
motion.

We wake up knowing,
So early nobody ever
Has seen death .

The poet expresses in these lines how, on the one hand, the Jewish
population suppressed knowledge about what was coming, pretended not to
know, could not know, but on the other hand has lived with a clear
premonition about the disaster about to strike for a long time. This
interpretation is applying 20/20 hindsight.  During the 30s life in Germany
was miserable for German Jews but probably niether as bad as life for
blacks in the USA at the same period nor as bad as life for Palestinians
under Zionist rule (I spend a lot of time among Israeli Palestinians and OT
Palestinians).  In addition, during the 30s the majority Zionist leadership
actively and often cordially collaborated with the German Nazis.  Indeed
the mass murders did not begin until September 1941 when the German army
made contact with anti-Soviet forces after the invasion of the Soviet
Union.

I am not sure the Polish Ashkenazi population can be legitimately accused
of suppressing knowledge about German Nazi plans -- especially because the
German Nazis may have changed their plans after observing the desire of
"liberated" Soviet nationalities for collective revenge against all ethnic
Ashkenazim because of the acts of ethnic Ashkenazi Soviet officials during
collectivization.

Subject: Re: aftsulokhes

aftsulokhes implies irritation...as in the picnic and rain scenario.  I
have personally never heard it used in conjunction with just any old
coincidence... although among Galitzianer Yidn I have not heard the
expression very frequently altogether - more familiar with it from my
Litivishe shviger.

I have also heard it applied to intentional negative behavior, as in "Why
does he always get into political arguments with the rabbi? I don't think
he really believes in the cause; I  think he does it aftsulokhes" . And
"He's an aftsulukhesnik"... a rabble rouser.

I believe (and I have heard from members of the older Yiddish-speaking
European generation) that the etymology of the word is from the Hebrew
Lhaakhis, which means to make (someone) angry. (The root of the word is
Ka'as - anger)....Aftsu - in order to  Lokhes = ashkenazi pronunciation of
Lehaakhis... to make angry.

Aftsulokhes = in order to make angry.

How do you spell "aftsulokhes" in Yiddish, anyhow?

Having learned and spoken Yiddish in North America, I cannot identify the
meaning ascribed to NA speakers by Khaver Sweet. Rather, I also use the
phrase as he does.

Subject: Re: frayer

It's all my fault: if I hadn't confused frayer with gefrayter I could have
gone to my Duden and learned that Freier is a German word meaning a
prostitute's client, in American slang a John.  The short of it is, then,
that frayer _may_ have come to Israeli Hebrew straight from the German
(though I confess that I can't see it imported by the proper bourgeois
likes of Scholem and Buber).

In any case, frayer is _now_ a Yiddish word.  I write 'now' because,
though it is found in Polish (frajer) and Russian, it is not found in
Harkavy or Stutchkoff or Weinreich and appears for the first time I beleive
in the recent Niborski where it's tagged as argot. That suggests many
possible paths and I hope that someone in our list can throw authoritative
light on the matter.
