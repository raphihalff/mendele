Subject: Zhe

I liked what Yude Rozof and Arre Komar shared with us on the little
particle that is so important as Arre said, to soften the tone of a
statement. In Peru, where my family hails from, we used to say "no mas".
Pase no mas (come on in). When my father moved to Spain he quickly
learned that it has the opposite effect and implies impatience and "get
it over with".

Anyway, this is a Yiddish list not a Spanish one. What I wanted to add to
the discussion is the repetition of the tess found in some areas for the
2nd person plural imperative. There is a wonderful book by Ghitta
Sternberg issued in 1984 by Pergamon Press and called: Stefanesti:
Portrait of a Romanian Shtetl. It's a very charming book; at one point
Sternberg discusses songs people sang (this is not a yizkor book, but a
scholarly ethnography put together from the author's memories). One was
Papirosn, and the words used are: Koyftshet, koyftshet papirosn, doubling
the tess.

Herts nokh a maase. I worked with a woman who was born here; one parent
came from a town with a name something like Berisifske; the other I don't
recall, but both were in Lithuania. Her Yiddish was native and flawless;
she went from kindergarten to the 12th grade in Workmen's Circle schools,
classes in Yiddish. One "flaw" her Yiddish had was the occasional greys
instead of groys, but that's very common. However, one day she used
sabesdikn loshn! But only one word: z(h)e. I explained to her that it was
zhe in the klal shprakh but she wouldn't hear of it. It was ze, not zhe,
un fartik!

Subject: syntax of _zhe_

so far as i know, _zhe_ cliticizes only onto imperative verbs and
wh-words (v-words), with one exception, _nu_ (_nu-zhe_), which can
presumably be explained as having been borrowed in toto, alongside of
both _nu_ and _zhe_. questions for fluent native yiddish speakers or
linguists who've researched the topic and, for the last question, fluent
native slavic speakers or linguists who've researched the topic:

1. is this correct? is there anything else that _zhe_ can cliticize onto?
   for example, _zhe_ seems syntactically similar to english _the hell_,
   e.g. _get the hell out of here_, _who the hell said that?_, but the
   latter can occur on (some!) finite verbs as well, e.g. _i got the hell
   out of there_. can _zhe_?

2. can _zhe_ occur with a 'double imperative', e.g. _gey veys_, _kumt
   est_? and, if so, on which verb? (_kumtzhe est_? _kumt estzhe_?
   _kumtzhe estzhe_? the first sounds a little funny to me but maybe ok
   while the second two sound very weird but i can't trust my intuitions,
   alas.)

3. can _zhe_ cliticize onto a v-word in situ, e.g. echo questions like
   _du host gegesn VOSZHE_?

4. what about multiple v-word fronting? which v-word can get _zhe_? (e.g.
   _zi veyst nit verzhe mit vemen es shlogt zikh_, _zi veyst nit ver mit
   vemenzhe es shlogt zikh_, _zi veyst nit verzhe mit vemenzhe es shlogt
   zikh_. again, the first sounds a little funny to me but maybe ok while
   the second two off the wall, ober vos veys ikh?)

5. what is the syntax of slavic _zhe_? same? different?

Subject: Leo Fuld's language

I want to thank Marion Aptroot for her reply to my query about Leo Fuld.
He's an important Yiddish singer -- he was faithfully played at all hours
when WEVD had extensive Yiddish music shows.

One classic song (Fuld takes all the classics and does them his way,
almost with the plaintive voice of a little boy, which I find very
endearing) he did was "Oyf der Sudenyu", which he pronounced as "Oyf
de-ne-sidenyu". It is definitely not a dialect I had ever heard. The *het
ikh* I knew existed, that it could be found in some Yiddish dialects. So
when I heard it I knew it wasn't the German "hatte".

Anyway, thanks loads, Marion.

Subject: Bargoens

On Wed, 21 Dec 1994 (Vol. 4.244) Jeff Zucker wrote about _bargoens_
[barkhUns], the Dutch thieves' language.

Hartog Beem wrote a book about Dutch words of Hebrew and Yiddish origins
entitled _Uit Mokem en de Mediene. Joodse woorden in Nederlandse
omgeving_ ("From Mokum [the big city] and the Mediene [the small
provincial towns and villages]. Jewish words in Dutch surroundings."
Assen: Van Gorcum, 1974). He also includes terms of Semitic origin which
entered the language through _bargoens_. The book includes an
introduction in which Beem describes with the way he thought these words
entered the Dutch language.

When one looks at a Bargoens dictionary, one realises that the Semitic
component of the thieves' language is very modest.

I would like to propose an end to the discussion on the topic of thieves'
language. This is a forum on Yiddish.

Subject: Malorusish

In connection with the discussion of the term _malorusish_:  The name
_Malorossiia_ for Ukraine has its origins in Byzantine church terminology
of the 13th-14th century.  The Russian Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich,
however, seems to have begun the official state use around 1654 (after
Ukraine joined Russia), when he designated himself ruler of "Great and
Little Russia."

_Mal/opolska_ ("Little Poland"), on the other hand, is the historical
name for the region around Cracow, as opposed to _Wielkopolska_ ("Great
Poland"), the region around Poznan.  The two terms are usually explained
as mistranslations of the Latin _Minor Polonia_ and _Maior Polonia_,
respectively, meaning "junior" and "senior" Poland (since the Polish
state traces its origins to Wielkopolska [10th c. CE], with Cracow later
becoming the royal capital).

Subject: Barkhes

Regarding the discussion of whether _barkhes_ belongs to _milkhiks_ or
not:  Mildred Grosberg Bellin's _The Jewish Cook Book_ (NY:  Bloch, 1944)
has a recipe for "butter barches" and one for "barches."  The latter "are
to be used for a meat meal and are made in the same manner as butter
barches, omitting the milk and butter," which is to be replaced with
"water and a little shortening of dripping or rendered fat or a vegetable
oil."  I don't know how traditional or "authentic" the recipes are.  The
1944 edition of the cookbook is the third printing of a 1941 revision of
a book by the same title, which, according to the publisher, had sold
more than a hundred thousand copies.  The author of the revision (MGB) is
described as "a graduate of Smith College" and "the wife of a physician,"
who "uses her own kitchen as a laboratory where she combines the
knowledge of modern American cooking with old Jewish dishes..."

Subject: Klezmer Music (Derivation chart)

Having made this chart at the request of a fellow musicologist, I decided
to post it on the list for the perusal of anyone else who would find it
useful. If you are going to print it, be sure to use a *monospace* font
(such as "courier"), and *don't* give any "justify" commands.

This is an ASCII version of the chart printed in "The Klezmer Recorder
Band," a collection of (untexted) arrangements of Klezmer music for four
recorders that I published in 1984. There is also a second (untexted)
book of similar arrangements, "The Lower East Side Recorder Band,"
published in 1988. Both collections are still in print. For purchasing
information, send inquiries to Von Huene Workshop,
<vonhuene@world.std.com>. (Do *not* send credit-card numbers by E-mail;
messages pass unencrypted through many computers.)

I am presently working on two more collections of Jewish music arranged
for recorders, with alternate parts for string quartet. "Yom Tov: The
Jewish Holiday Songbook" will contain songs with Hebrew and/or Yiddish
text for the Sabbath, the Festivals, and patriotic holidays. "Sefarad:
The Ladino Song Book" will contain songs from the Ladino repertory, with
Ladino texts. I hope to finish these books before Passover. When they are
ready, I will announce them on this list.
