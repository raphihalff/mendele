Subject: Origins of Yiddish

Although no linguist, I am delighted by Ellen Prince's "wild
speculation", which is both elegant and plausible -  no guarantee of
truth, unfortunately - and which also makes sense of my recollection of
having been told that some of the earliest books in Yiddish were
published in Italy (I might have heard it from Eli Katz, but he's not to
blame if my recollection is faulty).

Subject: Jews in medieval Italy

Ellen Prince thought of german-speaking north Italy as a possible
birthplace for yiddish, and later looked that area into the Jewish Travel
guide, to have an hint about jewish communities in that area.

There are several problems with this theory, though:

1. That area is _really_ austrian. It has become italy only after WWI, in
1918. If jews were living there before, they had no serious reason to
speak italian.

2. In the rest of Italy, jews spoke a local idiom (judeo-italian). It is
very discussed how much, when, and where it was spoken, but nevertheless
it is clear that it existed ca 1100-1900.

3. Before that, we have schools of poets in _hebrew_ (paytanim) beginning
from about A.D. 800.

4. When german-speaking jews came in italy, they were very clearly coming
from north, had their own "Machsor le-minhag ashkenazim", and amongst the
italian jewry they were called "tedeschi" (germans). (Two jewish family
names are Tedeschi and Polacco)

By the way, the region in Italy where german is spoken is made up of two
areas: Trentino and Alto Adige (Alto Adige in called SudTirol by the
locals).

Everywhere in Europe there are plenty of signs of jewish presence in the
high middle-ages (I think that we must look for the roots of yiddish
_much_ before than 15th-16th century).

I would say that the problem is working out an organic view out of all
these fragments. What I like to think is quite an opposite point of view:
i.e. not of jews travelling northbound to germanic and slavic countries,
but of barbarian invasions that submerge a roman presence that had a
considerable jewish presence. This would explain for a very deep romance
substratus a little bit everywhere.

Subject: Altnoy shul

In Vol. 5.062  Arnie Kuzmack mentions the "Altneu" Shul  in Prague.  A
few years ago I also visited that shul and was allowed inside, but not to
that part where the "remains" of the Golem are kept...

I  am fairly  sure  that Arnie's  explanation to  the  name Altneu  is
correct, but  there is another opinion  which claims that the  name is
not connected  to old  and new,  but stems  from the  Hebrew (Yiddish)
expression,  "altnoy", meaning  "on condition".   The condition  being
that it was built  only to be used as long the  meshiakh has not come,
then it will be moved to eretz yisroel.

By the way, Herzl borrowed  the title for his "utopian"  novel Altneuland
from the name of this shul, meaning old-new land.

Subject: Altneuschul, Prague

To Arnie Kuzmack let me say that I have also spent time _inside_ the
Altneuschul in Prague. It was in 1967. With regard to the indirect
exchange between him and Alice Faber, I have a brief quotation from a
book: Breffny, Brian de. (1978). _The Synagogue_. New York: Macmillan.

On pp. 65-66 we find, "The Altneuschul (Old--new-school)...appears to
have got its name because, when it was built at the end of the thirteenth
or the beginning of the fourteenth century, it was a new synagogue
building (synagogues are mentioned at Prague in the twelfth century), but
later it could  no longer be referred to as 'the new' when another newer
synagogue was erected--so it became the 'old-new'."

Subject: Altneuschul and Yiddish

I have found some further remarks on the name of the Altneuschul in
Prague. The folowing source is not a scholarly work, but it may have to
be considered in contrast with the statement by Brian de Breffny that I
sent earlier.

Tigay, Alan M. (Ed.) (1994). _The Jewish traveler: Hadassah Magazine's
guide to the world's Jewish communities and sights_. Northvale, NJ &
London: Jason Aronson. On p. 414, "The Golem is said to live in the attic
of the Old-New Synagogue, whose name's origin is subject to ongoing
debate. Despite the view that _Altneuschul_ means simply 'Old-New
Synagogue,' it may actually take its name from the Hebrew _al tnai_ --'on
condition'; the synagogue was built on condition that when the messianic
age arrives it would be torn down and rebuilt, brick by brick,in Eretz
Yisrael."

Support for this story comes from a legend that "the synagogue was built
by  exiles from Jerusalem after the destruction of the Temple in the year
70; these exiles brought with them Temple stones for the synagogue's
foundation" (Freedman, 1972, pp. 234-235). Freedman, Warren. (1972). _The
selective guide for the Jewish traveler_. New York: Collier.

It seems to me, then, that the murky origins of the name of the synagogue
render it not too useful for discussions on the origins of Yiddish.
