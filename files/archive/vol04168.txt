Subject: Bunky

I wanted to respond to Sorach Benner's note about being called
Bunshie.... My mother was born in Yashenovke, noRth of Bialostok now in
Poland... She still has the round gleaming bass pot in which she was sent
to dem brunem ( the well) to fetch water daily as a young girl.  She has
always called this round large pot with a narrow mouth a "bunkie".  Could
the affectionate term for a kleine myedle  with a round tummy have come
from an association with the word " bunkie? or is this word a Polish or
Russian word .. Ich vays nit.. ober ich bin zeyer tsufriden az meine mama
( zie vet hobn 94 yorn in December  im letzten monat  hot mire gegbn dos
bunkie far a matonah!.. zayt gezunt allemen.

OIkhet ich vell zogn as a molly picon show is geven bi undz in Syracuse
New York ...(Nes Hagoal halb in yiddish, halb oif english. a mechiyah!
szi gekumen fun Chicago  . the show waws entitled : Molly Picon's Return
Engagement " by Sara Blacher cohen and this two person show goes through
the life and songs and smiles and tsoras of Molly's life...Since the two
person show travels, other Yiddish aficianados may want to bring this to
their communities.  Ours was partally sponsored by the Jewish Studies
Program at Syracsuse University...and it was free to an overflow crowd on
a Sunday afternoon.

Subject: Prokovieff: Overture on Yiddish Themes

I recently had occasion to play a work by Serge Prokovieff whose title I
always believed to be "Overture on Hebrew Themes."  I have been playing
the work since the 1950s and invariably called it by that title, one
which was also published on a number of record jackets whenever the work
was recorded.  It is a brief work for only 6 players and takes no longer
than 10 minutes.  The music has a Jewish characteristic though the main
melodies were created specifically for this composition and are not folk
songs.  Oh yes, the English title on the printed copy said "Hebrew
Themes."   As a composition with such a dignified title, I played it
straight as an arrow, just like Brahms.  Now I am in possession of
information that is causing me to rethink this matter, and it is in no
way academic.

In my most recent playing, the string quartet and piano were all Russian
immigrants and we were playing from a Russian edition.  They kept calling
it "Overture on Yiddish Themes" and when I inquired about the title was
advised that the Russian word referred to "Yiddish" and not "Hebrew."

Further research has led me to believe that the two main melodies of the
work were created specifically for Prokoffiev by the late Simeon Bellison
who was the 1st clarinet player with the NY Philharmonic for years and
years, and who also was interested in the settings of Yiddish songs for
clarinet.  There are several published and I played one called "Bube
Meise" only recently.  There wasn't a dry eye in the shul.

Now, I am going to play the work again in early December and this time I
want to be better prepared both in my playing and to make intelligent
commentary.  Was the use of the title "Hebrew Themes" considered more
dignified and less ghettoish than "Yiddish Themes"?  And if the music is
supposed to sound less like Bloch's "Sacred Service" and more like "A
Freiliche Nacht In Gan Eden" would it be appropriate to play the
Prokovieff as a Klezmer player?

I recognize that the members of this board are not necessarily
specialists in Prokovieff, but what other place is better qualified to
speak on a work called "Overture on Yiddish Themes" (presuming that my
Russian colleagues were correct in their reading of the title, and I have
no reason to believe otherwise)?  This is a cross-discipline,
cross-cultural problem and to whom else should I go for advice?
