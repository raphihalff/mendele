Subject: Re: gehakte bankes

"gehakte" is used in at least one other instance that springs to mind to
intensify a negative image: "gehakte tsoris" is trouble squared. Similarly,
the dubious effectiveness of bankes is underlined by calling them "gehakte
bankes," since chopping up the glass cups renders them useless.

I have heard of 'gehakte tsoris,' but never 'gehakte bankes.'

Subject: Chaim Zhitlowsky in translation

I'm writing an honours thesis on Chaim Zhitlowsky at the University of
British Columbia. I unfortunately do not have Yiddish language reading
skills, so am currently searching high and low for English translations of
his works. Does anyone have a better sense than me what English language
material exists out there, published or archival? I'm also looking for
anyone who themselves has Zhitlowsky essays in translation they would be
willing to share.

I'm looking for some key essays (listed below), and am especially
interested in his writings from 1887-1908, but I would jump at the
opportunity to access _any_ material in English. Please let me know what
you have.

Subject: kaprosh and other game dances

I wonder if anyone can lead me to some sources.  I have lots of information
about the standard Yiddish dance genres (see my web page
www.yiddishdance.com  ), but I know that this
only scratches the surface of dances that were once done.  I am
particularly interested in finding out more information about dances that
are game-like. I have been sent information  about the shtockshpil, and I
am certain there are other such dance/games in existence, but am not sure
where to locate music (either notations or recordings), or instructions as
to how to do the dances.  Below is an example of one such dance that I
would love to track down.  I wonder if there are others.

Some time ago in a Yizkor books about  shtetls in the Ukraine, I read about
a dance that I had never heard of before called Kaprosh.  Here is what the
yizkor books have on it:
http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/Rozniatow/roz103.html

"He was a good conversationalist. He was able to tell stories and gather
around him interested people who would drink up his words with thirst,
words that were spiced with humor and jokes. Despite his Hassidic
appearance, he did not hesitate at weddings to be at the head of those who
entertained and danced in front of the bride and groom. He speedily removed
his outer cloak and hat, and with a kippa (skullcap) on his head he began
to sing and dance "keitzad merakdim, keitzad merakdim" [14]. Accompanied by
the enthusiastic group of singers and dancers, he would speedily arrange
the well-known "Kaprosh" dance. He would direct it and issue the orders.
Woe to the dancer who was not able to remove his shoe quick enough after
been issued the command, or to take out his fringes from the four corners.
He would have to pay good money to the band."

http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/gorodenka/gor169.html

We had many different activities for all ages and in all subjects including
the history of the Zionist movement, the history of Socialism, the history
of the labour movement, etc. Saturday was our activity day. Especially
popular was the Shabbat evening parties, where we had panel discussions and
later singing, eating and humorous sketches. The highlight of the evening
would be a "krentzchen" or dancing to the tunes of our friend Shmuel
Shekhner (the son of the Kleyzmer Mosh Babitzky) who played the violin. We
would dance the Hora and other types of dances. One dance in particular,
the "Kaprosh" has its roots in both the Hasidic and Polish folk traditions.
Our friend Monya Shtachel was an expert. He was our leader and led us
during many winter nights to sweat and fun, sometimes for four to five
hours in a row. We had some nights. it will never come back.

I asked many Yiddish speakers and klez musicians if they knew of this dance
and nobody did.  So I contacted Andriy Nahachewsky, a professor at the
University of Alberta in Edmonton who is an expert in Ukrainian village
dances and he had heard of this dance.  The one he knows of was called
kopirush and was a men's dance game played like follow the leader.  The
leader has a towel or belt and if someone fails to follow the leader, the
leader hits the person with a towel or belt.  This dance was done in Canada
by Ukrainians in the first half of the 20th century and isn't done anymore.
Not sure if it is still danced in the Ukraine.   Apparently there is
specific music used for this dance and it may have been notated by someone
named Roman Harasymchuk.  I am interested in finding out if there is
anything more written about the Jewish version of the music and the dance
itself.

The Yiddish singer Shura (Shprintsye) Volovets passed away on Friday,
October 21, 2005, at the age of eighty.

Shura was born in Mezhbizh, Ukraine, and as a young woman traveled to
Moscow to study in the famous Yiddish theater school of Solomon Mikhoels.

After the government closed the school, Shura did not have the opportunity
to study or to perform Yiddish songs for a long time.

In the 1970's Shura immigrated to the United States with her two sons and
settled in St. Paul, Minnesota. There she built a new life and began once
more to perform Yiddish and Russian songs, delighting audiences with her
charming and unique style. She was also an important mentor for younger
generations of Yiddish singers and Yiddishists.

Besides her singing, Shura was also a warm and generous woman with a
wonderful sense of humor. She will be greatly missed by her family and
friends.

Honor her memory!

Subject: The Jewish Socialist Verband

I'm doing a bit of research.  When did the U.S. social democratic group,
the Jewish Socialist Verband, "fold," and the last issue of Der Wecker
appear?  I have an approximate date as 1986 or so. Thanks for any details.
