I hope Arn has realized from my last posting that I had no intention
of stubbornly ignoring his explanation of the difference between
transliteration and transcription.

However, I am unclear as to how I am perceived as having 'come
around to the point of view expressed by him and others.'  As I
pointed out in my last post, and as is clear from my original
posting, I was simply requesting Mendelenikes' opinions regarding
the use of 'yiddish vokh' as opposed to 'yidish vokh.'  It was
certainly clear from the very beginning that there was a sacrifice
of consistency in the use of 'yiddish vokh': I don't think that was
an original contribution that any of the respondents made.

As I see it, Arn and others simply expressed a preference for
consistency over any accomodation for readers (of the English text
under discussion) who may be more comfortable with 'yiddish' rather
than 'yidish', who may not be familiar with it at all, and who may
indeed find it confusing.

I except Ellen from this unswerving stand for this kind of
consistency; she pointed out (in the context of mazl tov) that one
may treat certain words used in Yiddish as borrowings into English,
and hence (with a different kind of consistency) use the English
spelling.

I have suggested some advantages for the use of the spelling
'yiddish' in english text (even in 'yiddish vokh').  I have not seen
any discussion of the disadvantages of such usage, except for
assertions of the value of consistency.  I fail to see the value of
such adherence to Arn's kind of consistency.

However, having already missed an important point that Arn made in
his previous posting (transcription vs transliteration), maybe I
have overlooked other points that were also made.  If so, I stand
ready to say an 'al kheyt.'

Meylekh,

  I have indeed seen your latest posting. By coming around to our
point of view --mine, Ellen's, etc.--I meant only what you yourself
have said. Wwhen writing material IN Yiddish, use the Yivo
transcription; when writing English with Yiddish loanwords in the
text, use what has become the conventional English spelling for
those adopted words. E.g., Ikh es laks "I eat smoked salmon." But,
they sell lox in that store. That is to say, it seems that "laks"
has been taken into English, at least in urban areas, and people who
know no Yiddish will have lox (so spelled in luncheonettes) and
cream cheese on a bagel (from Yid. "beygl")!

  In my own last posting I made the point that even inan English (or
French, German,Polish,etc.) sentence, that is, any language written
in roman script, the quoting of a Yiddish expression, name of a
periodical, etc. would require the standard Yivo transcription;
wqriting it in Yiddish script (Hebrew letters with Yiddish
orthographic rules) would be awkward. So also, if I want to cite a
Hindi or Sanskrit term in English, I cannot normally write it in
Devanagari script for the general reader, so I use a standard roman
orthography for that language. Thus, I might mention dharma or the
like, even though the spelling may not convey Indic pronunciation
values to the English reader. So also if I cite a German, French, or
Polish word in its standard roman spelling, I don't necessarily
expect most monolingual English readers to have more than a rough
idea of its pronunciation. (In a language class I might use a
phonetic transcription, perhaps one based on the International
Phonetic Alphabet, as a teaching aid.)

  Regards,

  Arn

  In my posting of a few minutes ago, I said I had seen you last
posting. It turns out that I had seen the one just before the last
sent to Mendele by you. Anyway, I think my long response to you
covers cases like Yidish Vokh.Rendered in English, it would be, I
guess, The Yiddish Week.

Subject: knocking one's head against the wall

As I type this I have in front of my eyes on my bulletin board two
reproductions of panels from a painting by Peter Brueghel the elder
from a museum in Antwerp. The various panels in the painting show
various folk proverbs in visual form. The two I have show (a) a man
pissing at the moon (b) a different man (with astonishingly one bare
foot) beating his head against a brick wall.

No I don't think this has to do with davening.

Subject: Yiddish literature

In response to Bob Werman's plaintive posting and Elyet Hersh
Gertel's comment, let me tell you that at The Univ. of Connecticut
we have a reading group that meets every few weeks over lunch for a
brief Yiddish conversation and then a serious reading of
works--over the years--by such writers as Sholem Aleykhem, Y.L.
Perets, Bashevis Singer, and others. A few other local members of
Mendele are in our group. If some of the more literary types among
us can start the ball rolling, perhaps some of the rest of us can
try to join in.

My father used to say, Treft mir a glick!  That is, A mischance, a
