Subject: Critical terms af yidish

Fellow Mendelers--

A student recently asked me how one would say "deconstruction" and "post-
structuralism" in Yiddish. Anyone out there have a reply? Is there a Yiddish
critspeak in place?

Many thanks,

Jason Payne

Subject: Topics in Yiddish historical linguistics

I promised some months ago to start presenting some idea of what Yiddish
historical lx is about, incl. both things all specialists seem to agree on and
those where we do not.  In the process I hope to make it clear(er) why vowels
and diphthongs and consonants (which somebody laughed at in an earlier
discussion) are so important. 

(1) Yiddish has been a subject of scholarly work since the 16th century
(starting with some minor points discussed by the polymath and poet Elye
Bokher in his Sefer ha-Tishbi and more seriously with works of various
Christian (occasionally convert) German writers who were variously interested
in using Yiddish as a gateway to Hebrew and the Hebrew Bible or in
proselytizing German Jews or understanding the "  secret" language of Jewish
traders.  But Elye and his contemporaries clearly thought of their Yiddish as
simply German (l'shon Ashkenaz), and the Christian authors thought of it as
"broken" German. 

(2) What made modern Yiddish lx possible is the discovery made in the late
19th century by Landau and Saineanu that the German elements of Yiddish are
for the most part not derivable from modern standard German and so cannot be
"broken German" but rather from some German dialect or dialects of the Middle
Ages, and that modern Yiddish differs from the medieval language no more than
does modern German.  The classic proof of this has to with vowels and
diphthongs.  The difference between the vowels of vays 'white' and veys 'know'
is found in Yiddish and it reflects a parallel distinction within mediveal
German, but modern standard German has no such distinction, so that if
anything it is German that is "broken", not Yiddish.  There are numerous
additional data that indicate the same thing, but I dont think we need to list
them here.  The general point is that it was by paying attention to what seem
(to a nonlinguist) hairsplitting distinctions of sounds, and only by doing
this, that the real status of Yiddish was discovered. 

(3) In a similar way but I think later it was realized that the Slavic words
found in early Yiddish (and in those dialects of Yiddish spoken in W Europe,
i.e., Holland, Western German, Alsace, and Switzerland, all places where there
is no Slavic influence) do not come from Polish, but rather from Old Czech or
(as has recently been suggested) from Old Sorbian, the Slavic languages
furthest west.  How do we know this?  Again, by paying attention to details. 
The -kh- in nebekh, for example, cannot come from Polish, which has -g- here,
but can from Czech or Sorbian.  Again, I wont go into more details, but it is
from a handful of details like this that we can tell that Yd had contact with
Slavic long before the migration of some German Jews to Poland (and thence to
Russia, Ukriane, etc.). 

(4) The pronunciation of the Hebrew elements in Yiddish (and the Ashkenazic
Hebrew) were also ridiculed for a long time because Christian scholars had for
some reason (which I do not know) had centuries earlier settled on a
pronunciation of Hebrew similar to the Sephardic and in teh 19th century both
Zionist and assimilationist Jews adopted this standard.  It is only by looking
in detail at the vowels etc. that we can tell that the Yiddish/Ashkenazic
pronunciation is not "broken Hebrew" but a perfectly explicable system derived
systematically from ancient Hebrew and in some ways closer to it than is the
Sephardic (although both are quite different from ancient Hebrew). 

These are all matters which I think there is a consensus on.
Some issues where there is no consensus include:

(a) Where Yiddish first arose and when,

(b) Whether all Yiddish dialects in fact derive from a single source,

(c) Whether Old (roughly pre-1500) and Middle (roughly 1500-1800) Yiddish come
from that same source, and in particular whether all the texts labled as 'Old
Yiddish' are really Yiddish as opposed to German written in Hebrew characters,

(d) How did Yiddish, if itdoes come from a single source, differentiate into
the dialects we find now. 

All these are quite controversial, but again almost all scholars who deal with
them try to solve such problems by looking at details of pronunciation,
lexicon, and grammar which by themselves would seem to a nonspecialist to have
no real interest (I say almost all because Max Weinreich in particular tried
to solve problems like (a) with rather little reference to linguistic
details).  An example or two might be in order.  Robert King's arguments for
the proposition that Yidish (by which he seems to mean Eastern Yd)  originate
in Bavariais basdd on some similarities he claims to find between details of
Yiddosh and of Bavarain German such as the unrounding of rounded vowels (like
German o" and u"), so that German scho"n corresponds to Yiddish sheyn, and so
on.  While I have criticized King's work, this is the METHOD that must be used
to solve such problems, and there is no other.  Similarly, Dovid Katz has
argue that the way Hebrew manuscripts are "pointed" in the medieval times in
Bavaria reveal that the authors or copyists had the same Hebrew vowels system
as we find in later Yiddish and Ashkenazic Hebrew. Again, I completely
disagree, but again the method is the only one possible.  My own work on (b)
and (c) for example is again based on finding a set of features which are
shared by all dialects and by modern Yiddish with Middle Yidish and which are
so distinctive that there is no alternative, if I am right, to accepting that
they come from a single source (something which no one or at best very few
people have proposed before). 

And so on. I cant help feeling that recent discussions of etymologies (Kurve,
Davenen, etc.) did not really clarify what Yiddish historical lx is about.  I
hope I have done a little in that direction here.

Dan Leeson asked about stemed matzo [07.193], frisht oyf or as we used to say
in Galicia oyfgefrisht---either one is correct.  Have not heard this word in
ages.  My best to the Mendele "group"

From: Yoel Epstein <yoel@netvision.net.il>
Subject: Etses gibber

My business card reads "etses gibber consultants".  A client of mine - a
German Jew who grew up in a Yiddish-speaking home in Germany - says the
expression is "etses gayber" (he pronounces it gimel-yod-yod-beyt-eyn-samekh). 

I consulted with my wife's aunt, who studied Yiddish at Tel Aviv University. 
She checked two dictionaries.  In one she found gimel-yod-beyt-eyn-samekh
(preferred) and gimel-eyn-beyt-eyn samekh.  In the second dictionary she found
only the second spelling, but certainly not double yod.  She also claimed that
the word etses should be spelled as in Hebrew (eyn-tzadi-vav-tav), and not as
pronounced. 

My father-in-law says that in Romanian and Litvak Yiddish it's Gibber, in
German Yiddish it's Gebber.  My recollection of my Litvak Grandparents is that
it was gibber, but that was a long time ago. 

What does the mayvin say?

Subject: Mandy Patinkin, a gesunt auf zein kop!

Patinkin's CD can be ordered from the "Yiddish Voice" store - 47 Stetson St -
Brookline, Mass - 02146.  that's where I ordered my Mandy and when the CD
arrived I dropped everything, sat still for an hour and floated away.  Reading
his thoughts in the brochure which accompanies the CD is vital and the
information which you included in your letter is partly correct. Yes, he
studied and learned mamaloshen and presents warmth and heart-stirring music.
Order today, you'll be so glad you did! 

To Dan Leeson: your grandma must have known my Momma because she also "frisht
oyf" the matzoh and I follow the same procedure !!

Subject: Patinkin's Mameloshen

I have been enjoying Mandy Patinkin's "Mameloshen" tape, even with all its
"emoting" and, for some Mendelyeners,  not quite up to par "pronounciations."
In fact, his "Papirosen" and "Motl the Operator" are among my favorites on the
tape.  What really bothers me about "Mameloshen" is why on earth Patinkin had
to sing a Yiddish version of "White Xmas" on it.  Yes, I know that Irving
Berlin was Jewish (and  the song certainly has a valued place in popular world
music), but why include it on a tape oriented to the  Jewish community.

Subject: "Poylish" and "Paylish"

Whenever I've heard the pronunciation "Paylish," it was as a joke, or mocking
reference to someone who spoke the Poylish dialect, in which many of the "ei"
sounds of standard Yiddish are pronounced "ai".
