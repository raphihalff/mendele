Subject: Yiddishisms in Mad magazine

A few days ago, I was heartened to see the return of "furshlugginer" - -
in slightly altered form -- to Mad Magazine, a publication which (among
other things) has brought Yiddish words to the English language over the
years.

In the July issue, a satire of Batman Forever was entitled "Batman
Fershlugginer."  Furshlugginer, a word that's appeared in Mad over the
years, means "knocked around," like a piece of old furniture; my mom says
it can also apply to someone who's been pushed around by everyone else
(and who probably walks with a permanent stoop, as if to expect more
blows).

I've seen several other Yiddish expressions in Mad from time to time. A
few which have recurred:  1)  farshimelt (gone moldy).  Used by Mad to
describe just about anything odious; 2)  shmendrik (something like a
shlemiel).  Used in introductions to articles to describe the readers of
said articels; 3)  kaput (ruined, finished, "through"). Seldom seen on
its own in Mad, but used as part of the name of Roger Kaputnik, a
character in Dave Berg's "The Lighter Side Of...". Kaputnik appears in
just about every issue as a hypochondriac patient in the doctor's
office; his image is actually a Dave Berg self- portrait!

All of these don't include Yiddish-derived-from-Hebrew expressions, such
as "Charlie McGilla" (another Dave Berg character), and my personal
favorite, found in a spoof "magazine" for camp counselors: "Camp
Yiska-Doll."

Do any other Mendeleniks have favorite recollections of Yiddish words in
Mad?

Subject: Yiddish in Israel

I've just returned from two wonderful weeks in Israel, where I had two
interesting experiences with Yiddish.  In my hotel in Tel Aviv, I was
approached by someone who wanted me to translate something from Yiddish
to English.  Why he assumed I knew Yiddish is beyond me.  But then we
visited the Dead Sea, where t-shirts were being sold that said something
like "I've just visited the lowest place in the world" in sixteen
languages. The last language represented was Yiddish, and the word "velt"
was spelled with two lameds.  Oyy.

Subject: Transcription of Yiddish

I am a little bothered by David Sherman's remarks on the "translitera-
tion" of Yiddish.  One of the virtues of the YIVO system, as presented in
the Mendele archives, is that one has the facility, perhaps with some
limitations, to represent, i.e., to _transcribe_, most, if not all, of
the salient features of the range of Yiddish dialects.

That is, this is different from a pure transliteration, which simply
gives a letter-by-letter equivalent in roman writing of the string of
letters in Yiddish script. All of this was thoroughly thrashed out in
Mendele a year or so ago. [cf. articles on romanization in Vol.4]

Transliteration has its uses, as in writing biblical Hebrew in roman
letters in scholarly works in such a way as to make recovery of the
original Hebrew (unpointed) spelling rather automatic.

Of course, David seems to be arguing for a normative roman spelling of
Yiddish, much as we have a standard spelling of English with all its
notorious difficulties as far as a good match with English speech is
concerned. This does have its virtues for reading, I concur, and David
may be thinking only of convenience in reading texts in roman script that
are all written by the same orthographic rules. On the other hand, our
transcription system does enable any one of us who wishes to do so, to
express himself or herself according to the phonological patterns of his
or her preferred dialect. When writers of English novels and plays try to
do this in dialogues, they run into a great deal of trouble because of
the shortcomings of English orthography, and, of course, they rightly do
not feel free to use IPA trasncriptio or the like in material for public
consumption. Our transcription system--_not_ transliteration--lets us
have it both ways!

Subject: Yiddish on compact disk

There has been much talk on this list about creating a Yiddish CD-ROM.
Last week there was a post on the Secular Humanistic Judaism list
requesting information on Hebrew tutorials on CD-ROM. There was an
extensive reply. The "Hebrew Tutor" is a multimedia, interactive program
that uses sight and sound. It comes with TrueType (r) Hebrew and
transliterated fonts that can be used in the word processor. The program
provides pronunciation and the ability for the learner to work at their
own pace. The CD costs $49. If this can be done for Hebrew, it certainly
can be done for Yiddish.

Subject: Yiddish values in English

Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan suggested (Vol. 5.073) a source for "secular
Yiddishkayt in English." I would add another significant source: the
International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism, 28611 W. 12 Mile
Rd., Farmington Hills, MI 48334. The IISHJ has access to the curricular
materials developed by affiliates of the CSJO (Congress of Secular Jewish
Organizations) and SHJ (Society for Humanistic Judaism) and can refer
inquiries to those bodies. In addition, the Institute is currently
preparing a series of curriculum guides for elementary schools.

As to the basic issues being discussed, I can appreciate and empathize
with passionate resistance to transmitting the values of Yiddishkayt in
English for fear that, thereby, the need for Yiddish itself would
disappear. However, the experience of the past 50-60 years has
demonstrated that the fear is misplaced--that the more the ideas and
values of Yiddishkayt become available in English, the more knowledge of
the riches of Yiddish literature and folklore become widespread, the
greater becomes interest in learning the Yiddish language itself.

It has been noted that insistence that "Yiddish cannot and must not be
translated" was self-defeating (or worse) in the 20s, 30s and 40s; I hope
the error is not repeated anew out of great love for Yiddish. In this
context, we would do well to ponder the meaning of Itzik Manger's poem,
"afn veg shteyt a boym" ("There is a tree that stands," in Leonard Wolf's
partially felicitous rendering in _The Penguin Book of Modern Yiddish
Verse._)

Subject: Golem

In Gershom Scholem's _The Messianic Idea In Judaism_ there is a charming
essay, "The Golem of Prague and the Golem of Rehovot,"  that gives some
of the history of the idea of the golem and an interpretation of the
meaning of the golem in Judaic thought.

Subject: Golem

Adam Whiteman asked incidentally about the history of the term "Golem" in
both  Hebrew and Yiddish.  As  one of the Hebrew  correspondents of
Mendele I shall try and reply (consulting a couple of dictionaries).

Golem is not  found in the Bible  but is of Mishnaic  origin, where it
means a boor or a clod.  In  the Pirqe Avot (Wisdom of Fathers) 5,7 it
says There are  seven marks of the  clod (boor) and seven  of the wise
man (shiv'a  dvarim b'golem v'shiv'a  b'hakham).  A golem is  also the
pupa, this immobile state of, say, a butterfly in development.

The most  famous Golem was the  legendary man of clay  produced by the
Maharal of Prague (The High Rabbi Loeb), who served him and eventually
had to be destroyed.

On a more personal level, we  at the Weizmann Institute were the first
who in  Israel built computers  in the 1950's.   When we built  in the
early  1960's  another  generation  and looked  for  a  name,  Gershom
Scholem, the famous  scholar of Jewish mysticism, suggested  to us the
name Golem.  Unlike the Prague version, our Golem proved "fertile" and
eventually  we even  built the  Golem B,  much faster  than our  first
Golem.

I assume that into Yiddish the term entered together with the story of
the Prague Golem, but perhaps it was taken from the Mishna.

Subject: Finding copyright ownership

I'm translating some articles written by Daniel Charney in Der Tog 40
years ago and was wondering how I go about discovering who owns the
rights to these articles now.  I would like to have them published
someday.

Thank you for any advice and pointers.
