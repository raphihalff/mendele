Subject: khalaburde

On May 26 Louis Fridhandler asked about the meaning of the word "khalaburde". 
According to "Slownik jezyka polskiego"[Dictonary of the Polish language],
vol. 1, Warsaw 1978 a Polish word "halaburda" means a roisterer, a rioter, a
shouter. This is an old word but some people in Poland still use this word in
this meaning.  According to "Slownik jezyka polskiego" [Dictionary of the
Polish language], ed. by W. Doroszewski, vol. 3, Warsaw 1961, the Polish word
"halaburda" or "haraburda", apart from meaning 'a blusterer, bully, hector,
roisterer, rioter', also used to mean 'a disturbance, fuss, scene, fight,
brawl, quarrel, row'.  This word has come into the Polish language from the
Ukrainian language. In the Ukrainian language its form is "galaburda".
According to "Slovnik ukrainskoj movy" [Dictionary of the Ukrainian
language], Kiev 1970-71 it is a dialectal form which means the same as
"b'eshk'et". "B'eshk'et", in turn, means 'a disturbance, fuss, scene,
scandal, confusion, tumult, turmoil, row, brawl'.

Subject: -shtaygn un shteyger

me ken shtaygn in shteyger ober nit shteygn in shtayger . -shtaygn- is a verb
meaning to go up, to climb etc. and is, I believe, considered -daytshmerish-
in some common usages.  Nevertheless, as a verb, according to  mendele khaver
Yankev Lewis,  specifically describing spiritual elevation through religious
learning and discourse,  it should be considered  a thoroughly Yiddish word.
-shteyger- is a noun meaning  the manner or mode of something.  -der vos
shtaygt lebt gevis af a yidishlekhn shteyger. afile der vos geyt zeltn tsi
keynmol in shil nit arayn ken zikh oykh oyslebn af a yidishlekhn shteyger-.

Subject: Etymology 

Dear Mendelyaner, I have as many of you know for some considerable time been
tilting at the windmills of (what I consider) invalid etymologizing in
Yiddish.  I think I have just come up with a new way of making the point.  It
turns out that dictionaries of English slang used to (maybe still do) often
give fanciful etymologies of words which are obviously of Yiddish origin,
e.g., ganef from gone off!!  Now, how do we KNOW that this is meshugge and
that ganef is from Yiddish?  I don't know how, but we do. And THIS is what I
mean when I say for example that we KNOW that kurve is from Slavic kurva and
not from Hebrew, that davenen (whether you accept my tenative etymology or
not) is definitely NOT from Turkic or from Aramaic, and so on.

Subject: 1. The name "Shirley"; 2. William Safire alert!

1. For those who have not seen today's New York Times (Sunday June 7), an
obituary records the death, at 92, of the noted sports columnist Shirley
Povich. I quote: 

"The name Shirley for a boy was not uncommon in Maine. He was born on July
15, 1905, in Bar Harbor to parents who were orthodox Jewish immigrants from
Lithuania. . . . Mr. Povich was the eighth of 10 children and was named for a
grandmother, Sarah, or "Shirley," as it was loosely translated into Yiddish." 

Get it?

The grandmother was surely name "Sorele", in Litvish "Shorele". If we new
just where she was from, perhaps from the northeastern Polish towns (where
Litvish Yiddish was spoken), Grajewo (Yiddish "Grayvi") or Lomza (Yiddish
"Womzi"), we might assume that "Shorele" was actually called "Shoreli";
hence, English "Shirley". ( I think that "Sarah Lee" of cake and cookie fame
has a "Sorele" origin, as well.) Can anyone confirm that "the name Shirley
for a boy was not uncommon in Maine"? Among Jews? Litvish-Yiddish speakers?
Or is all that coincidental? 

2. The NYT (Week in Review, May 24, p.3) ran a piece by Peter C.T. Elsworth
which ran as follows:  "Berlin, laid within the Soviet Zone, but was
controlled by all four powers. On June 24, Stalin lay siege to the citie's
three western zones . . . ." 

Nuff said!

Subject: help in translating Sholom Aleichem

Dear lovers of Sholom Aleichem,
    
I am currently working on a translation of SA's epistolary novel,"The Further
Adventures of Menachem-Mendl," a sequel to the first, beloved
"Menachem-Mendl."  As usual, I come across words, phrases and events whose
meaning - literally - and figuratively, I caanot find in dictionaries or by
asking people in Ann Arbor.  I thought I would take advantage of the wealth
of knowledge and experience contained in Mendele to ask your occasional help
in defining an "untranslatable" for me.  For instance: 
     
1) REML-as in, ir darft dos hubn tzum reml tzu farentfern zikh...
     
2) DI SHVESTER DI M'SHUMDES- Does this have any more meaning than the
literal? 
     
3) SKUT
   
This is a start.  I cannot tell you how much I would appreciate any help at
all.

Subject: Chemistry texts; Swiss/Yiddish

Re: Chemistry Texts.

Among the Jewish farmers of Farmingdale, NJ, whom I interviewed for me book
on the American rural experience was Marilyn Tenenbaum. She gave me her
school notebooks from her days in Vilna [I think it was Vilna] in which she
took notes in Yiddish on chemistry, biology, and physics. I deposited the
notebooks with YIVO and they are available to anyone interested. 

Re: Swiss Deutch and Yiddish.

In 1960 I was in Zurich, Switzerland, for the first time. I do not speak any
language fluently except English and Yiddish. It was freezing cold and I
needed to buy something warm. I went to a department store, could not make
myself understood in English and so I switched to Yiddish. The salesgirl
understood me perfectly, and was able to give me what I wanted. I was so
intrigued that I invited her to have coffee with me when she was free, and we
had a whole conversation; she speaking her language and I speaking Yiddish. 
She was not Jewish. Certainly, the languages have a similar source someplace. 
Maybe it was in the horse trading that went on across the Swiss Border,
sometime long ago. Or maybe it wasn't so long ago.

Just thought I'd add my two cents worth to this discussion. Another thought I
want to share: I love Mendele on Line.

Subject: Universal declaration of human rights

I have been contacted by the UN asking if the UDHR is available in Yiddish so
they can put it on a web site in honor of the 50th anniversary.  Does anyone
on this list know of such a translation?
