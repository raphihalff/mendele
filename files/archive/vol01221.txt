I'm reminded of the following joke that my father told me:

Once in a small shtetl there were two food stores, one
owned by a Jew and one by a gentile. The two men were on
friendly terms, and both establishments had Jewish and
gentile customers, who selected themselves based mainly on
proximity. However, the gentile owner noticed that at
Pesach time, his Jewish customers vanished. Asking his
Jewish friend for an explanation, he was informed that
during Passover, Jews would only buy food that had been
labeled 'kosher l'pesach'. Not at all daunted, the gentile
owner placed in his shop window an elegant display of
merchandise, all labeled 'kosher l'pesach'. In the center
of the display: ... a large ham also labeled.

_bis_ is the unit being bitten into, swallowed, digested,
etc., or the nominalization of the action.  _bays_ is the
nominalization (noun-form) of the action (from the verbal
stem; _baysn_ is the infinitive):

        ikh vil a bis shokolad
but:
	der hunt hot mir gegebn a bays/bis

Phillips' contribution, which he found folded in a hagode,
is half unintelligible!!  Was it written like that on the
sheet of paper you found, i.e., in that transcription?!  Or
is that your transliteration of the text written in Hebrew
characters?  Or is that your transcription of how you'd
pronounce it?  (If it's the latter, I'd sure like to hear
you pronounce it!) Do you understand what all of that
means?  Please explain.

One of the many Yiddish names for God is _der eybershter_
pronounced with [ey] or [ay], depending on where you're
in-laws are from.  Literal translation: 'the One above'.

Noyekh, I take it that _gefrishte matse_ is _matse-bray_,
right?  Where did you grow up?

A gutn moyed!

The "kosher wine scandal" during Prohibition is, surely,
prime example of the "cultural determination of crime".
(See, also, poiuring oil into herring barrels, poisoning
pushcart horses, etc. Noyekh, you're right on there.

Mikhl.

Subject: Tsar Nikolay

Another (unfortunately fragmentary) macaronic version of
Tsar Nikolay, this one obviously American:

          Tsar Nikolay,
          Oh what a guy!
          In mitn derinen hot er khasene gehat
          Mit a kurve, a bestet [bastard]
          Mit sifilis infestet,
          Day day-day day-day day-day day-day day...
          Afn koner shteyt zi,
          Mitn tokhes dreyt zi...

The tune, correctly identified by Robert Rothstein was also
used in a deservedly forgotten movie, "At the Balalaika,"
with Nelson Eddy, as a white guard Cossack, singing the
refrain, "Vodka, oh vodka, I love you so true/ how could I
ever get along without you?"

          Eli Katz
