Subject: Introduction

I live in New Zealand where there are about 5,000 Jews. Not many are in
Hamilton, where I live, but there are a few here at the University of
Waikato. Two are north Americans who speak Yiddish.

I was born in England and learned a lot of Yiddish words and phrases from
my Lithuanian grandparents. Sadly I can't speak it fluently, and can
understand transliterations up to a point and Yiddish in Hebrew
characters with extreme difficulty. I would really like to be able to
speak and read fluently.

I belong to the National Yiddish Book Centre and enjoy der Pakntreger.

Subject: Calling the Workmen's Circle bookstore

> Book is available from the Jewish Book Center of The Workmen's
> Circle (phone 800 922-2558 x285, fax 212 532-7518, ...

That 800 number is more memorable as 1-800-WC-CALL-US.  (All right,
the 'S' is superfluous.)

Subject: Kholeymes un kontroversies

sholem aleykhem, a gut yor un a gutn moy'd.

ikh vil koydem zogn a por verter oyf yidish vegn der kontroversie iber
transliteratzie un oykh vegn peter kluehs kholem (V-4.098). ikh halt, az
es iz keynmol nit tzu shpet zikh tzu lernen, un az a sakh fun di
mitglider fun mendele zaynen take do kdey zikh tzu lernen. ikh bin geven
tzufridn tzu zen, az zelig bakh hot genumen oyf zikh tzu helfn undz mit
undzer visn, un hot undz gegebn a kurtze lektzie, mit bayshpiln, vi tzu
shraybn (Vol 4.102).

in anander elektre-briv (i-briv) hot peter kluehs undz forgeleygt periodishe
lektzies, --- un keyner (dakht zikh) hot zikh nit opgerufn.

ikh shlog for dos vayterdike:

1. periodishe, formele tzi informele lektzies
2. yeder mitglid zol bakumen tzugeshikt di genoye yivo klolim. farshteyt
zikh, az yeder vet ton mit dem vi er/zi meynt.

And now, a few words in English:

We try so hard when writing to avoid mistakes. Inevitably, errors creep
in. Even automatic spelling and grammer checkers are imperfect (see
review: "Grammatik 6.0 Misses as Many Errors as It Finds" PC Magazine,
13-9-94 p.50) But we do make the effort to try and make our texts/letters
etc. clear and error free. There is no reason why we shouldn't make an
effort in Yiddish. Mendele subscribers have been made two wonderful
offers: periodic lessons (Peter Kluehs V4.098), and periodic
instructional commentary (Zellig Bach V4.102).  The price is quite steep:
na'ase ve nishma ('we will do, and we will listen' said the Jewish people
at mount Sinai when accepting the Torah). Are we ready to pay that price
for Yiddish? I think we should.

I suggest the following:

1. organize the periodic lessons;
2. Send out a copy of the YIVO rules to all Mendele subscribers. Include
   some 'classic' (or standard) sample words, and some 'exceptions' (or
   difficult ones.  E.g. mekhaber or mehaber(?)  oylem habe, un (not und)
   tzukunft or zukunft(?), yontef or yomtev (?).

And what about dialect? In yiddish spelling we write tzadik-vov-vov-yud-
yud (tzvey) for the number two. However, it is pronounced as "tzvey" in
Lithuanian (litvish) Yiddish - as in the English "May", and tzvay in
Polish (poylish) Yiddish - as in the English "eye".

(- if we decide that it is ok to write either, then it should at least be
consistent throughout the text. Beginners will need to be instructed.
Here's an excellent topic for a future short lesson).

- Let's see these rules, so that we can discuss them. Then, after a
general consensus decide, by vote, to accept or reject the standard(s).
Maybe with our own additions/modifications. Finally, the results will be
reposted to all members as part of a 'welcome package', including some
other nice things.

(e.g. other rules   - like about members changing their address;

key addresses - Stephen Dowling / Workman's Circle Yiddish book
                centre;

              - Fishl Kutner / Yiddish information Network;

              - Reyzl K-W / Kultur Kongres, Int'l events/classes
              info;

              - myself (Leybl) / Hemshekh Dor in Israel; - etc.

a nice humourous anecdote or two; a classic poem or two; a few
idioms; a short list of useful text books, etc).

Additions / modifications can be sent out periodically, maybe once a
year before "rosh hashone".

I have one other suggestion, vis-a-vis 'macaronism' (there, I did it
myself: "vis-a-vis"...). We should as much as possible avoid writing
Yinglish: English mixed with Yiddish. We should make an effort of
either placing the Yiddish in quotes, or somehow seperating it in a
different line. I recently saw a sentence made up of 4 Yiddish words,
followed by 6 English words, 2 more Yiddish and ending with 2 more in
English.

And finally, I'd like to end this mailing with an interesting item I
discovered in the monthly bulletin of the Netanya AACI (Association of
Americans and Canadians in Israel): " Innocent Slurs 'Kike', an insulting
term for a Jew, made its bow during the 19th and 20th century immigration
of Jews from Europe to North America.  When they had to sign papers, Jews
who could not write, were ordered to sign with a cross which they refused
to do for religious reasons.  They signed with a circle, a Kikel or
Kaikel ["kaykl"-L.B.] in Yiddish and a shortened form of the word was
immediately hung on them.                 " (Netanya AACI Bulletin, May?
1994)

Subject: Paper bridges

I am a composer, proud to be a new member of Mendele, and currently
working on a commission for a choral piece for a professional choir in
Minneapolis. It uses two Yiddish poems and one by a modern American poet
that share the image of an old Jewish messianic legend, that at the end
of time the people (different versions say the Jews, or the tsaddikim)
will cross over to Eretz Yisroel on bridges made of paper.  (Some
versions have the wicked attempting to cross on iron bridges that fall
into the sea.)  I'd like to trace the legend, and have collected several
references already--personal recollections, two songs, an old joke.  I'd
love to hear from further informants.

Subject: Hebraica Cataloging and Yiddish Romanization

For those who wish to educate themselves in the arcane matter of ALA/LC
Romanization of Yiddish, I refer you to the cataloger's "Bible" for this
subject:

Hebraica Cataloging:  A Guide to ALA/LC Romanization and Descriptive
Cataloging, prepared by Paul Maher (Senior Descriptive Cataloger, Library
of Congress).  Washington, DC:  Cataloging Distribution Service, Library
of Congress, 1987.

See especially pages 8-11 (Hebrew and Yiddish Romanization -- The ALA/LC
Hebraica Romanization Tables; Historical Note on ALA/LC Romanization),
and 22-24 (Yiddish Romanization).  I erroneously called this publication
"Hebraica Cataloging Manual" in my last posting and pass this correction
along in the interests of bibliographical accuracy.  Movie rights are
pending.
