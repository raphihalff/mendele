Subject: Mendele on Wall Street

Rabosai,

We made the papers today.  The Colin Powell "Interview" and Mendele are
described in today's (11/16) Wall Street Journal, Page B1: "Now it can be
told: Colin Powell Is Not Really Fluent in Yiddish". It seems that the
journalist, like the subject, is also "not really fluent in Yiddish".
According to the report, Powell and Bach snacked on "tichel" instead of
"kichel". Furthermore, according to the report "Mendele" means media in
Yiddish.

Enjoy!

Subject: South African _kitke_

_Kitke_ as a designation for 'Sabbath bread' seems to be unique to South
Africa only because of the high concentration of Yiddish speakers from
the Lithuanian-Belorussian area. The word is virtually restricted to them
although we have several recorded instances of speakers from the
Southeast who claim to have "heard" it.

Where _kitke_ occurs on our map, _khale_ always cooccurs; _koyletsh_
and/or _shtritsl_ sometimes coocur with it as well-- all designating the
Sabbath bread and sometimes the festive bread for other holiday occasions
as well (Purim-koyletsh, etc.). _kitke_ often designates only the a
decoration on the loaf: a strip or a braid of dough.  Myy instinct tells
me that this is a case in which a designation for a part (the decoration)
came to apply to the whole (the loaf). One of our Slavists may know the
etymology of the word.

I should explain that I have skirted around trying to avoid overusing the
term _khale_ in order to avoid prejudicing the case, although for most of
us, _khale_ is, in fact, the universal term. In Western Yiddish, on the
other hand, _berkhes/barkhes_ is the most widespread, and  _da:tsher_ is
the term in the Frankfurt area. To the West of the Elbe R., _khale_
generally occurs as a designation of the _mitsve_ known as _nemen khale_
and does not refer to the loaf.

Subject: Menakhem-Mendl

The recent reference to Menakhem-Mendl prompts what may be a repeat. The
reason for the pairing seems to derive from interpretation of _menachem_
as _menchen_, (German- like) diminutive of _man_, and its pairing with
_mendl_, Yiddish diminutive of _man_.

Subject: Crickets

Bob Rothstein inquires why _lamedvovnikl_ can mean 'cricket' or
'grasshopper' (Vol. 5.170).

I would appreciate knowing some sources for this usage.  I couldn't find
it in any dictionary I have, don't remember ever seeing it in literature,
and even Stutchkoff's _Oytser_ doesn't seem to include it where I looked.

But taking Bob Rothstein's word for it, I can offer speculation (no
knowledge). His own suggestion, that they are usually hidden from sight,
makes sense with respect to crickets:  they seem to always be there, yet
are nowhere to be seen.

But grasshoppers?  What about a visual origin, not for the whole word
_lamedvovnikl_, but for just the two _oysyes_?   _Lamed_ and _vov_,
graphically on paper, are thin and elongated, and the physical shape of
the _lamed_ (imagine lamed-and-vov laying horizontally, in missionary
position, _take_, with lamed 'on top') suggests the extended hind-leg
armature (am I using English correctly here?) of not just the cricket,
but the grasshopper as well - certainly the salient anatomical feature
the two have in common. That, taken with the ubiquity of hidden crickets,
suggests a subtle chemistry of lexical forces, which seems persuasive to
me.

(And then there is the fact that insects have six legs, and 6 x 6 =
36...)

Subject: Yak redele to redele

Daniel Soyer wrote [5.158] about what he found (an exerpt from my old
friend: The Morning Frayhayt, in which Motl Peysi's (Sholem Aleykhem's)
mother mixes up Yidish/English in sentences. "Ikh gey in tshikn
oyszaltzen de kitshn"..etc, etc.. (I guess he wanted to know the
meanings).

If Daniel did not get an answer yet, here an attempt: The gist of the
mixed words improperly in place mean: "I go into the kitchen and salt
(kosher) the chicken" , not: "going into the chicken and salt the
kitchen." A small joke, but it has more meaning to me than others,
because I grew up as a Yidish speaking chicken farmer in Central New
Jersey, when it was the egg basket of the whole country... But my own
mother said things like that. Sorry, but I'm stymied by the next line: A
dayge--sogt zi--(yak redele to redele, abi dobre maynele...). I'll leave
it to other Mendlyaners who may know Polish or Russian....

Subject: Pronunciation or reading of abbreviations

I have a question which probably has an obvious answer which I just don't
know and can't find in books -- so I turn to Mendele. Here's my question.
Can all Yiddish or Hebraic Yiddish abbreviations written with double
apostrophe be pronounced as acronyms? I know that, for example, zayen ''
lamed can be pronounced or read as "zal", and that khes - bes '' daled is
pronounced or read as "khabad", but what about ayen '' hey? Is there an
acronymic pronunciation (and if so what), or is it only read out as "olev
hasholem"?, and how about zayen tsadek '' lamed?, and others? To put it
another way, is the situation like American city abbreviations where one
can say things like "I live in el-ei" (LA), but not "I live in en-wai"
(NY)?
