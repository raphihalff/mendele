yes, it would be fair to assume that. the /s/ is presumed
to have arisen at a time when the hebrew target sound was
/th/ (as in the english words 'both', 'wrath', etc.).
yiddish speakers, like german speakers today, could not
pronounce that and, again like many german speakers today,
substituted /s/. i don't know the chronology of the hebrew
sound change (perhaps someone out there in mendele-land
does?) but i'm quite sure that hebrew /th/ ceased to be
/th/ (and became, at least for most dialects, /t/) a lot
farther back than 200 years ago. we can safely infer that
the yiddish /s/ in these words predates the hebrew change
to /t/, since yiddish speakers should have had no trouble
with /t/ and the words you list would then be something
like *agodet, *tekhinet, *kehilet. (the '*' means
'unattested'.)

of course, this substitution may have already occurred for
these speakers before they ever got to german-speaking
lands. since none of the languages of lands adjacent to the
german-speaking territory has or had /th/, it could have
happened in any one of them. all we can safely say is that
they didn't migrate to german-speaking lands from england
or greece, at least not directly! :)

Subject: Introductory statement

Hi.  I'm Ted Steinberg from the State University of New
York College at Fredonia, which is not a center of Yiddish
studies.  I generally teach courses in medieval and
Renaissance literature, but I have a deep interest in
Yiddish literature.   I wrote a book on Mendele (1977) and
have written several articles on aspects of Yiddish (and
medieval Hebrew) literature. Given the absence of anyone
here who shares these interests, I was delighted to learn
about the existence of MENDELE.

Subject: Sesame and kibitzer

1) Sesame

     The 1984 Russian-Yiddish dictionary published in
Moscow gives _der kunzhut_ as the Yiddish translation of
Russian _kunzhut_, 'sesame'.  The word, with stress on the
second syllable, is also used in Ukrainian and
Byelorussian, and is said to be a borrowing from Uighur, a
Turkic language.

2) The last word on _kibitzer_?

     In the first supplement to his _The American
Language_, H. L. Mencken mentions _kibitzer_ as an example
of a word of German origin that entered English through
Yiddish.  He further cites Dr. M. J. Bach, "for many years
London correspondent of the _Wiener Neue Freie Presse_" on
the origins of the term. Bach relates a story told by Count
Karl Schoenfeld (1828-66), whose memoirs were published in
1909.  Schoenfeld served in the Austrian army as a staff
officer under General Haizinger during the Italian campaign
of 1848-9.  The general "had a little dog called _Kiebitz_,
meaning a plover..."  The line officers called the staff
officers _Kiebitze_.  The word _Kiebitz_ "soon became a
slang word for anyone who merely looks on at the game, and
from the army it spread to the cafes of Vienna."  Mencken
comments that the connection "arose from the fact that, to
line officers, staff officers seem to be mere onlookers."
