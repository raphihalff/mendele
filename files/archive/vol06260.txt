Subject: A Sholem Aleichem parody of shund

A private inquiry drew my attention to one of Sholem Aleichem's
parodies of shund, trashy Yiddish literature.  It appeared thirteen
years after Sholem Aleichem's _Shomers Mishpet,_ a vigorous
condemnation of Shomer's popular Yiddish trash.  However,  Sholem
Aleichem seemed to fight that battle for a long time.  The piece is
entitled _A Farshterter Khasene_ (A Disrupted Wedding).  As far as I
know, no English translation is available.  It is a letter from a
suitor to his beloved, full of purple prose.  It was first published
in Der Yid, 1901.  Then it was published in _Sholem-Alekhems Ale Verk,
Warsaw: Folksbildung, 1903, Volume 3, p. 105._

The letter (from the latter publication):

Tayerste un libste neshome!  Mayn freyd un mayn kroyn, mayn khies un
mayn lebn!

Freydl, gezunt zolstu zayn.  Ven ikh, lemoshl, hob tsen toyzent hent,
un undzer takykh Shtunkeylo zol zayn fun gole tint, un der vald zol
zayn gole penes, un di gantse velt zol zayn papir, un ikh zol shraybn
tsu dir gantse teyg un gantse nekht, volt ikh dir nit gekont
oysshraybn keyn tsentoyzenter kheylek afile fun dem vos mayn harts tut
filn tsu dir fun der ershter minut on vos ikh hob derzeyn dayn likhtik
ponem, vos iz shener fun der zun, un derhert dayn zis kol vos iz ziser
fun zistn vayn.

My translation:

My dearest, the most beloved of my soul!  Crown and delight of my
life! Freydl, may you be granted good health and long life!  Just
think!  If I had ten thousand hands; and if you can imagine that our
river, Shtunkeylo [Stinkola?] , was pure ink; and if our forest
consisted of countless pens; and if all the earth were made of paper;
and if I should then write day and night for all of my life, I could
not express to you even one part in ten thousand of all that I feel
in my heart for you since I first caught sight of your radiant face,
more beautiful than the sun, and heard your dulcet voice, much
sweeter than the sweetest wine...

Then it was published in the posthumous _Ale Verk Fun Sholem-Aleykhem,
Nyu York: Folksfond Oysgabe, VI, Kleyne Mentshelekh Mit Kleyne
Hasoges, 1918, z. 41.  However, the word, Shtunkeylo, was omitted.
Probably it was felt that such an ugly stream did not belong in
Kasrilevke.

As further evidence of that, listen to the jarring note in the
Folksfond Oysgabe edition of Lag Boymer [IX, Mayses Far Yidishe
Kinder, Bukh Tsvey, z. 105], published posthumously: ...in dem vistn
fintstern Kasrilevke, vos ligt baym taykh Shtunkeylo.

Kasrilevke was never like that.

When Sholem Aleichem was about 44, 1903, this same story was
published.  The town then was _not_ Kasrilevke.  It was Mazepevke.
Mazepevke was, indeed, vist un fintster (hollow and benighted).  Now
_that's_ where the taykh Shtunkeylo belongs! (See  _Sholem-Aleykhems
Ale Verk, Warsaw: Folksbildung, 1903, Volume 2, p. 75._)  The
posthumous change from Mazepevke to Kasrilevke was, in my opinion, a
lapse in judgment.

Subject: Yidishe shprikhverter/ frazeologye

Leonard Prager [6,259:2] mentions Richard Zuckerman's phraseological
dictionary. I can confirm that it certainly existed. Zuckerman showed
the ms. to me in his home in Brooklyn in the summer of 1978. At that
time it was already in an advanced stage of preparation. A very
valuable feature was the citation of parallel Polish and Ukrainian
phraseology. The Yiddish was cited in the original and in
transcription in, as far as I recall, the three major dialects.
Zuckerman was concerned that these transcriptions were not
sufficiently accurate. I strongly urged him to overcome his excessive
scruples and publish very soon as it would clearly have filled a
serious lacuna in Yiddish lexicography - one that sadly continues to
exist to this day. The last time I heard of Zuckerman he was living in
Strasbourg.

Subject: Folg mikh a gang

Gitl Dubrovsky asks in 6.259, 4 how one translates _folg mir a gang_
into English.  I know it as _folg mikh a gang_ and Weinreich agrees.
What leaps immediately to mind is _That far?  Oy, what a shlep!_ Again
it resorts to Yiddish words, but immediately understood by most
English speakers in America, and probably elsewhere.

Oder men ken zogn _It's quite a distance! _ (Vaynraykh's
iberzetsung),_ oder _That's a long way to go for that.  Unreasonably
far, don't you think?_ ober es hot nisht keyn tam.  Es klingt azoy
nudne un temp.
