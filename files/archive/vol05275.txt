I am almost sure the Yiddish word is of Germanic origin, related among other
words to the English verb to reek, meaning 'to smell'. These words are very
old and date back to pre-Yiddisch time, and so does Hebrew 'ruahh' (with a
hheth, not with a khaf, (hh = an 'h' with a dot underneath), which appears
already in the second verse of the bible.

If there is any relation between the words, it must go back to
pre-proto-indo-european and pre-proto-semitic times, which is quite doubtful,
especially as I don't see much similarity between the meanings of the concepts
of smoke and spirit/wind.

Hope this helps,

Daniel Bugel

Subject: Kemp Nitgedayget

The indication here (V. 5.268) that "the camp was connected to the Jewish
People's Fraternal Order of the IWO" is in error. kemp nitgedayget was founded
long before the March 30, 1930 establishment of the IWO and its
Jewish-American Section, which became the JPFO at around the same time (mid
1940s) as nitgedayget metamorphosed into Camp Beacon.

Subject: Itzik Manger

I hope someone can help me find the full text of Itzik Manger`s poem "Ikh bin
der veg keyn mayrev". I have just the first 4 strophes in the handwriting of
Selma Meerbaum-Eisinger, the cousin of Paul Celan, who was murdered by the
Nazis at the age of 18 years. She left just one manuscript with poems and some
translations from and into yiddish, including this poem by Manger. She
translated 9 strophes but added just the first 4 in the original yiddish. I
could not decipherher handwriting in the 4th strophe beginning with the words:
"Mayn benkshaft - a tsigeyner..."

Is one of you in possession of the whole poem? Please help!

Subject: Hasidic Yiddish theatre

A gitn shishan pirem.  I spent the wee hours of last night running around Boro
Park, taking in tishn and shpieln.  I noticed a bunch of things which I
thought would be of interest to Mendelyaner, and particularly relevant to the
recent discussion on khsidishe yiidish.

a) A while back, someone suggested the title "Rosh khavruse" for Reb Noyekh,
and I commented that "khavruse" applies to a pair, or very small group, who
learn together, usually on a regular basis and in a formal setting, and the
word would be misapplied to a group such as ours.

In the dedication before the shpiel at the Minkatsher rebbe's tish last night,
the narrator/MC referred to the "gantse kh'vrise" in a context in which he was
clearly referring to everyone involved in the shpiel, if not all the khsidim.
To me, it sounded as strange there as it did when suggested as a name for
Mendele, but obviously the speaker thought it was fine.  It may have been an
improvisation because the speaker didn't know of a word for "cast" (neither do
I, for that matter), or I may be influenced by a relatively narrow yeshivishe
usage.

b) At the Bobover shpiel, I noticed the following contrast:  In a conversation
between a khusid and his rebbe about a court case, the khusid referred to the
judge as "der rikhter", but when the rebbe replied, he referred to the same
judge as "der shoyfet".  It may be that the Hebraism is considered more
suitable for a rebbe.  (The rebbe being portrayed was the Bobover rebbe before
the last one, who is treated with extreme reverence in Bobov.)  The difference
may have been put in to make the dialogue more colourful, or it may have been
merely accidental, with both words being equally common.  But it is equally
likely that the script isn't as rigid as it would be in conventional theatre
(to which this community has no exposure), and the difference reflects the two
actors' idiolects; if so, it may reflect a generational difference, since the
actor playing the rebbe was younger than the one playing the khusid.

c) Also at the Bobover shpiel, one of the characters was a rich goy.  His
lines were all in Yiddish, but it seemed to me that they were practically
devoid of Yiddish words which are transparently derived or borrowed from
loshnkoydesh.  They also had none of the loshnkoydesh borrowings which
permeated the lines of the other characters, but since most of those were in
lines of a religious bent, and his role had nothing to do with the religious
angle of the play, that probably reflects their content, and not a deliberate
ommission.

d)  Nokh vaater at the Bobover shpiel, I noticed a few times that certain
words were pronounced the way a Litvak would pronounce them (and not in the
Galitsyaner accent used for the rest of the play, which is presumably the
native dialect of the participants).  The only example I remember now is that
a straw hat was called a "zun-shtraaml", and not a "zin-shtraaml".

It occurred to me that in that particular instance, the purpose was to
disambiguate 'sun' and 'son' (zun/zin in Litvishese is zin/zin in
Galitsyaner), since the compound was coined for the occasion, for comic
effect, and may not have been readily recognizable.  Moreover, the second half
of the compound was pronounced "shtraaml"--and not "shtrayml", as it would be
in Litvish.  But the context was clear enough to disambiguate: the character
was talking about how he had come up with a new invention, a solution for the
summer shabosim, when the shtraaml is making the sweat run down your face,
produced a straw hat, and called it a "zun-shtraaml".

If this wasn't an aberration, it may be evidence (however minimal,) that there
is some sort of underlying standard in the minds of dialect-speakers who don't
know from YIVO, and that that standard is Litvish.

Subject: Learning non-"standard" Yiddish

Arre Komar (Mendele 5.269) expresses frustration at the disparagement of the
Yiddish of native speakers by those Yiddishists who consider
only"standardized" Yiddish to be correct.

I have similar feelings of frustration from a different perspective.  I did
not grow up with Yiddish, love the language, and am doing my best to learn it.
What frustrates me is that the only courses, textbooks, and dictionaries of
Yiddish grammar and pronounciation which I know of all teach YIVO Yiddish,
while everyone seems to acknowledge that this is _not_ the Yiddish of those
communities where the language is most thriving.

This is somewhat parallel to the situation in Canadian schools, where
English-speaking students (at least in my childhood) were taught "Parisian"
French and the Canadian French of their neighbours was ignored.  So I have
a request of all Mendelyaners: does anyone have suggestions, or know of
resources, for a student in my position who would like to learn to speak
non-YIVO Yiddish?

Specifically, I would be interested in "poylishe" Yiddish (we have the
strongest family-history connections with the town of Stashuv, halfway between
Cracow and Lublin) _or_ in the Yiddish of the Bobov Chasidim, who have a
strong presence in Toronto and connections with some of my friends.

A sheynem (oder shaynem) dank,

Subject: Jewish choruses

I need to find out about the Jewish Music Alliance and assorted information
about the history, past and present, of choruses singing in Yiddish.  Can you
suggest a good source for this information?  I would really appreciate it. A
shaynem dank!
