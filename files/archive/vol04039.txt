While it may be morally repugnant and therefore inappropriate, I suspect
it may not be actionable if the persons involved are no longer alive.
I'm a Canadian lawyer and thus no expert on U.S. law, but the general
principle of defamation of character (libel/slander) requires the person
to be alive to be defamed. Of course, there may be other legal issues.
Copyright in the letters was presumably implicitly granted by the writers
when writing in, though there might be an implicit condition attached
that names not be published.

Of course, the whole issue is moot (vi azoy zogt men dos oyf yidish?)
unless the letters are found.

Subject: Sholem Asch

What I recall dimly is that the Christological trilogy got Asch all kinds
of hell from readers (maybe more from non-readers) who thought that he'd
become oys yid because they had no understanding of what is it a European
novelist. I think he was reduced to serializing in the communist Frayhayt
(Freiheit), whose editor MJ Olgin no doubt was delighted arayntsushtekn
zayn apikorsishn grobn finger in frume oygn arayn.  Didn't Asch
subsequently write a book explaining that no, he was not a meshumed?

Subject: Varia et trivia

[1] Many years ago, I shared lab space with two Swiss chemists doing
postdoctoral work in the U.S. Their Basel-deutsch was quite puzzling to
me, who had studied some German in college, until I began to recognize
some curious deviations from hoch-deutsch and striking similarities to
yiddish, for example, the use of /mir/ instead of /wir/. My friends were
astonished one day when they realized that I understood the word /mies/
(=ugly) which they claimed was not extant in hoch-deutsch. I therefore
assumed that /mies/ in yiddish was a remnant  of medieval german, which
had also subsisted in some swiss dialects. However, the fact that Uriel
Weinreich's dictionary gives the phonetic transcription of this word
suggests that it is of Hebrew-Aramaic origin. Does this represent another
instance of borrowing from yiddish into German, such as is presumably the
case with /ganef/ and /meshuge/?

[2] Like many others, I long believed that the word for story was
/maynse/ as I heard it pronounced by my parents, originating from Warsaw
and Wieruszow (western Poland). It is only when I had occasion to look up
the word in Weinreich that I learned it was /mayse/.

Subject: Translation

1) I may get around to doing something with it when I retire, but if
someone is looking for a dissertation topic in the meantime, he or she
might consider the question of Russian translations of Yiddish
literature, sometimes done by the authors themselves.  I've noticed some
interesting revisions of the originals, sometimes in the direction of
toning down the Jewish content of the texts.

2) One anecdotal example of creative translation into Yiddish:  The prize
for the best children's book of 1934 in the Belorussian S.S.R. was won by
Ianka Mawr for his novella _TVT_.  The first sentence of _TVT_ reads as
follows:

	1. [Belorussian original] Tolia kuliai uskochyw u khatu, niby
	 za im hnalisia chatyry sabaki. (Tolya burst into the house
	 like a bullet, as if four dogs were chasing him.)

	2. [Russian translation] Tolia pulei vletel v dom. (Tolya flew
	 into the house like a bullet.)

  But

	3. [1935 Yiddish translation by H. Kamenetsky and G. Fridman]
	 Tolye iz fayl fun boygn arayngefloygn in tsimer, punkt vi nokh
	 im voltn zikh hundert zibn un fertsik meshugene hint geyogt.

Subject: Yidn viln azoy

Addendum to my posting on the use of the YIVO acronym in occupied Europe,
taken from Nachman Blumental, Verter un vertlekh fun der khurbn-tkufe
(Tel Aviv:  I. L. Peretz Publishing House, 1981), p. 149:

YI.V.O. -- (Yidn viln azoy).  Roshe-teyves fun Yidishn Visnshaft- lekhn
Institut -- far der milkhome in Vilne, haynt in Nyu-York. "Di agents
YI.V.O git iber vegn an intervents fun Ruzveltn bay yenem [i.e., Hitler]
vegn der lage fun di yidn, mit der droung aroystsushikn di 8 milyon
Ashkenazim fun Amerike" ([Emmanuel] Ring[elblum], Nov. 1, 1940).
"Onshtot zogn, az di zakhn zenen nisht geshtoygn nisht gefloygn, gezogt
az dos zenen YIVO-nayes" (Seyfer Koriv, z' 446; Seyfer Zhetl, z' 349;
Rayzer, Grodne, z' 94).  "In yedn nitsokhn fun di daytshn, hobn di
YIVO-istn gor gezen a natsishe mapole" ([Yonas] Turkow, Azoy [iz geven],
z' 89).
