Subject: Pluperfect

thanks, neil, for noting that bavarian etc have the 'gehat' pluperfect too.
that follows from their having lost the preterite, i would think. and thanks
for the references. what i was interested in was the yiddish pluperfect with
invariant 'gehat', even when the main verb takes 'zayn'. do you have any
knowledge of that happening in bavarian etc? i'd be very interested if you did!
thanks again.

alan king, your post will be a lot harder to reply to! first of all, thanks!

in a nutshell, i in fact also believe that slavic influence is at issue in this
'invariant gehat' pluperfect, but that's a long story that i'll spare you. what
is clearer, however, is that there is no reason to suspect slavic influence in
the yiddish pluperfect where (or when) 'gehat' alternates with 'geven',
depending on the verb.

that is, the loss of the preterite is a nice germanic phenomenon -- see neil
jacob's previous post about it happening in bavarian. (yiddish has several
million things in common with bavarian german, by the way, not just this.) now,
once the preterite is lost and replaced by the present perfect, you'd expect to
find the present perfect forming the pluperfect, which is just what you get, in
bavarian and in yiddish. in fact, beatrice santorini has kindly supplied me
with a token of this pluperfect in western yiddish (which had no slavic
contact), from worms, dated 1642.

ok, what i'm interested in is in those dialects of yiddish where a further
change occurred -- the replacement of 'geven' by 'gehat' in the pluperfect, in
those dialects that usually distinguish 'hobn' verbs from 'zayn' verbs.

if you're still with me, and if you care, i can tell you my very speculative
story on how this might have happened and how i think slavic was involved, but
for now let me say that the influence i'm positing was a lot more indirect than
what one normally thinks of.

as for how common it is, it is very uncommon -- and in fact its low frequency
figures crucially in my little story. but it exists -- i found 6 examples in
olsvanger's royte pomerantsn, which is about as colloquial as written yiddish
can get. (olsvanger, being a litvak, does not use 'gehat' with 'zayn' verbs,
but this shouldn't affect the frequency.)

as for what contexts it occurs in, it typically occurs in main clauses or in
adjunct clauses (as opposed to, say, embedded complement clauses). (this is
part of my little story too.)

as for whether it might be considered 'an artificial construction from the
point of view of the spoken language', i can't imagine how it could be. it
might be considered markedly formal -- for that, you'd have to ask a native
speaker with good intuitions about different stylistic ranges -- but artificial
it ain't, if by that you mean something dreamt up by some academic.

finally, what you say about the token you cite from sholem aleichem is puzzling
without the prior context -- or whatever it is that makes you sure it does NOT
have the meaning of a pluperfect. could you tell me what makes you think that?
it's interesting to me if you're right since the same thing is happening in
english, where pluperfects are often used without their traditional meaning,
e.g. 'i didn't eat cheese before i'd been to europe'. so, if the yiddish
pluperfect is losing its semantic 'pluperfectness', that too could be a not
unusual germanic development and doesn't necessarily point to a slavic
influence. anyway, i'd love to hear the context.

and thanks again!

Subject: Is Yiddish Alive?

To pick up the thread related to whether the use of Yiddish is declining, I
needed to add my observations after an afternoon of shopping at Lord & Taylor
department store here in New York City. Any time that you find yourself in Lord
& Taylor, other than on Shabbos, you will be surrounded by large numbers of
extremely stylish Hassidische women, frequently accompanied by their husbands
wheeling the baby carriage. They often shop in groups and can be heard
commenting and giving advice -- all in Yiddish, of course.  Occasionally some
Yinglish sneaks through, as it did today:  "Kik uhn di shich, zei zenen
gorgeous! Di vest zei konen trogen all over."  In this context, it is easy to
see the important role the Hassidische community plays in keeping Yiddish
alive.  A language can only stay current when it is used in the commerce of
everyday living.  I was surrounded by it all afternoon as I strolled from floor
to floor. I highly recommend it for those times when you're feeling that you
need to hear Yiddish used in those important, mundane situations, as it was so
many years ago.

Subject: Sholem Aleichem's work in Chinese

I am writing this as a member of the Sino-Judaic Institute. The SJI is seeking
funds to enable a scholar in China, and one of our members, to attend the New
York commemoration of the 80th anniversary of Sholem Aleichem's death.

Prof. Yao Yi'en, of the Foreign Language Institute of Shanghai, a member of the
Shanghai Literary Translators' Association, and a Senior Research Fellow of the
Shanghai Research Institute, has for decades been translating the works of
Sholem Aleichem from Russian into Chinese. These translations have appeared in
a wide variety of publications. An account of Sholem Aleichem studies in China
by Prof. Yao, and a list of his publications are available on request. He is
proud to have met with Belle Kaufman when she visited Shanghai.

Prof. Yao has informed us of his keen interest in attending the aforementioned
event. However, he needs financial aid for the air ticket and for living
expenses during his visit. Please don't hesitate to contact me for further
information on Prof. Yao or about the Sino-Judaic Institute. Anyone wishing to
contribute to Prof. Yao's hoped for trip to the New York event can also contact
me, or send a check payable to the SJI at the indicated address. If
insufficient funds are collected, we will return the checks received from
individual contributors.

Mit a hartsikn dank......

Subject: Simon Dubnow Cultural Award

The YIVO Institute for Jewish Research cordially invites you to a ceremony
celebrating the arrival of the complete prewar YIVO Archives from Vilna.

On this occasion, YIVO will present The Simon Dubnow Cultural Award, in honor
of the great Yiddish poet Abraham Sutzkever, for his heroic role in saving
YIVO's treasures from destruction, and for his enduring contributions to
Yiddish literature and Jewish culture.

Wednesday, January 31, 1996.  Program:  7:00 p.m. Park East Synagogue, 164 East
68th St. (between 3rd & Lexington Aves.), New York City.

R.S.V.P.  YIVO (212) 246-6080; fax (212) 292-1892.

[Two points of clarification regarding the above event: (1) YIVO expects to
receive the second and final delivery of documents belonging to its prewar
Vilna archives, at the end of January.  At that time, as agreed upon with
Lithuanian archival authorities, a significant portion of the documents
received earlier will be returned to Vilnius, since they have been photo-
copied.  These copies have been integrated into pre-existing YIVO archival
record groups, which will be microfilmed once processing of the entirety of the
material received from Vilnius has been completed.  The microfilm will be made
available to the Lithuanian archival administration, and will include documents
in the NY YIVO's possession since the end of World War II plus those that have
been lately received from Vilnius. (2) Unfortunately, Abraham Sutzkever will
not be able to be present at the upcoming celebration.  There will, however, be
several speakers on hand who will discuss his literary contributions and his
role in helping to rescue YIVO's library and archives during the Nazi
occupation. -- ZB]
