Subject: shmuzn

Carl Goldberg asked about "shmuzn" (Mendele 07.105 of November 21.).  Coming
from the hebrew "shmu`ot", meaning originally "what is being heard, rumors" it
entered into Yiddish also as a verb "talk, chat".  But it came into colloquial
German through another channel, that is Rotwelsch, the thieves` cant of late
Middle Ages ant it is due to this channel that another shifting in the meaning
of the word came. Nowadays german dictionaries list not only "Schmus",
"Schmuser" and "schmusen"  but also "Schmu" = cheating, and "Schmonzes" =
balderdash and all are derived from the Hebrew.

the metaphoric king and queen in referring to man and wife in keeping with
Sabbath and Passover tradition."

Subject: Spelling "Yetta"

Aron Mandl (07.108) asks about the correct spelling of "Yetta" as a given
name.  I think there are many spellings of this name, related to where the
person so-named lived and how it was pronounced.  I have heardand read the
following variations: Yetta, Yitte, Ytke and Ydes, and I'm sure there are
still more.  They all stem from the Hebrew Yehudit, as far as I am aware.

Subject: Sholem Ash

Es iz mir geven a khidish as keyner hot zikh nit opgerufn vegn, oder kegn,
Sholem Ashn, ven ikh hob tzetirt aza positive nekrolog (obit) in the Chicago
SunTimes of 1956. 

There was a day when Orthodox eggs would have flown; when irate quotes from
Khaym Liberman of the Forverts would have been flung like stones accusing him
of deserting (and even harming) the Jewsih people; when the Yidlit teacher in
Arbeter Ring Seminar was teaching that Asch (who CHOSE to write only in
YIDDISH) deserted our people in a selfishly motivated effort to arrive at a
Pulitzer from the majority culture. 

Now, a half century later, does the nonreaction on Mendele say we are more
sophisticfated and embrace him, that he was ahead of his time in having so
wide a world view, tryinmg to present a common, derivative spirituality for
both Jews and Christians. 

Or does it merely mean that Asch is out of print because he's no longer read?

Subject: vanity plate?

In an email exchange with Itsik Goldenberg, I've had occasion to wonder what
the appropriate term is a for a personalized licence plate, sometimes known as
a vanity plate (such as Itsik's ZAMLER or our MMLSHN, both in Ontario). 

Any suggestions? What about "hevl-shildl"?

Subject: Amol is geven a mayse

Jacob Feldman asks about the song with the line:  "Amul iz geven --- a kenig"

The song in question is entitled "Amol is geven a mayse" and it can be found
in the collection: Anthology of Yiddish Folk Songs, Vol 1 page 118.  It is
published by the Magnes Press in Israel, ISBN 965-223-447-8.

Subject: shpatsirn

In regard to the origin of the Yiddish verb "shpatsirn"--it most likely comes
from German "spazieren(gehen)," (same meaning as in Yiddish) which in turn
goes back to Italian "spaziare":  to roam, wander, etc.

Subject: dav(e)nen

I have been following the various responses to my suggestion that dav(e)nen
comes from the Aramaic.  The responses come in two categories.  With the first
point of view, I have a fundamental disagreement.  This position is propounded
by Manaster Ramer. Manaster Ramer states, "Such problems as the etymology of
dav(e)nen are in this picture very small beer indeed, but it is precisely
against the background of this bigger picture that we must seek to solve such
problems."  This big picture includes a conception that " the dynamics of the
history of Yiddish suggest that the more easterly dialects often replaced
words of Romance or German origin with either Slavic or Hebrew-origin ones." 
This type of reasoning is precisely what I found unacceptable in some of the
choices for the origin of dav(e)nen.  This reasoning is entirely inconsistent
with Jewish history and culture.  The Hebrew/Aramaic words are the core words
in Yiddish because they articulate Jewish religious concerns which are not
expressed using words from the dominant environment.  These words express the
continuous core of Jewish religious life and are not simply expressions which
are swapped in and out based on location or fashion. I suggest that Manaster
Ramer, time permitting, look into a new Judeo-English which is developing
among English speaking yeshiva students.  It is whimsically called
Yeshiva-speak.  In Yeshiva-speak, Jewish religious concepts and concerns are
always expressed in Hebrew/Aramaic/Yiddish. This phenomenon confirms what was
true in all generations, that Jewish religious concepts are conveyed in a
Jewish form.  Consequently, it is beyond common sense to look for "sound
alike" word relationships while ignoring the basics of Jewish life. 

The second point of view directly dismisses my choice d'Avanan/d'Avinin
(Aramaic vocalization has divergent oral traditions) as the source of
dav(e)nen and is expressed by Meyer Wolf and Bob Hoberman.  Their primary
concern is that the word d'Avinin is not grammatically correct in Aramaic;
therefore, does not exist.  We all know that grammatical correctness does not
determine whether a word exists.  For example, are the words Shabosim or
Seyfer Toyres nonexistent in Yiddish because they have another grammatical
form in Hebrew?  Similarly, I propose that Av which has an irregular masculine
noun plural with a vov- sof ending (Avos) took a regular masculine noun plural
yud-nun ending (Avin). At this point the word could have taken one of two
tracks. The first track, another yud-nun for the masculine personal pronoun
suffix for 'our' was added to make the word Avinin.  Alternatively, an aleph
suffix for the definite article was added to Avin, creating the word Avina,
add a daled for from and you get d'Avina (fun di oves).  Either form is
consistent with a) the tradition that the word stems from our/the forefathers
b) is in conformance with Brachos (26b) which states, "Always say the
forefather's instituted prayer." c) is consistent with the understanding that
Jewish religious concepts are conveyed in a Jewish form.
