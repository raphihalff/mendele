Subject: Argentine Yiddish tangos

David Robboy asked [5.249] about Argentine Yiddish tangos. "Mein Yidishe
Meydl" is a tango. There is a few lines of it in Kammen, folio #9, p.23. This
was the first time I saw a Yiddish song in tempo di tango. Please tell us the
names of the 5 Argentine Yiddish tangos your group sang. There is a live long
playing show in San Francisco called "Tango."  Some of the music was familiar
yet I could not place the melody.  It did not occur to me that I might be
hearing Argentine Yiddish tango music---but maybe not.

Subject: Composite tenses/moods/...

Ellen Prince:

I dont think there's much joy in trying to find a 'pluperfect' or 'sequence of
tenses' in Biblical Hebrew; a quick look in any of the standard grammars will
make that clear. In any case, the substrata of Modern Hebrew are more
important factors.

Dovid Braun:

Thank you for the object lesson in not disappearing things till theyre really
gone. The forms you cite are all known from "Transcarapathian Yiddish" so it's
not surprising that they're found in Bukovina as well. Does your Bukoviner
informant also have the preterite of zayn?

Your clarification has me really confused now -- Noyekh mit zibn grayzn, as it
were. Our ever-helpful moderator provided us with "volt geven gevust". Is this
what you meant instead of "zol geven visn"? In which one is "gehat totally
out"? Moreover I keep seeing "visn zayn" rather than plain "visn" in the
examples. Could we please have examples with some other verb such as hern?

Subject: Bokser

Hershl Hartman:

Sorry our discussion of verb exotica aroused pluperfect envy.

Bokser derives from Bockshorn, which in modern New High German means hartshorn
(I'm not making a joke on your name!). In earlier NHG, it was was also a
synonym for the current term for carob: Johannisbrot, St. John's bread. No
surprise why Jews opted for bokser.

One of the reasons I put off replying to your inquiry was the second part of
the question, why it came to be used when there was already a word for it in
Hebrew. My meditation ran something like this: Why would one think that
because a term exists in Hebrew, it would prevent the adoption of an
equivalent term in one of the other stock languages? Just because Hebrew has
shemen-zayes are we troubled by boyml? What about emes? It didnt prevent the
adoption of vor in early Yiddish, nor the adoption of pravde in 18th century
Yiddish. I concluded that I (and perhaps others) dont understand the question.

Subject: Yiddish cognate to "Kokolores"?

The German word "Kokolores", (nonsense, unneccessary ado) sounds like it might
be of Yiddish origin, but dictionaries don't give an etymology (if the have it
at all).  I checked a few plausible places in Weinreich and came up empty, but
the combinatorial possibilities of the first four sounds are overwhelming. Can
I tap the collective wisdom of Mendele? Is there a Yidish word that might have
led to "Kokolores"?

Subject: Myron Cohen cassettes

The Jewish Book Center of the Workmen's Circle actually sells several
cassettes of or with Myron Cohen, both in English and in Yiddish.  To order a
catalogue, call 1-800-922-2558, ext. 285.

Subject: Er vet kumen

Ellen Prince points out in yet another pluperfect note that in English you
can't say "on Wednesday he will come" if you mean a previous Wednesday.  I
thought the velt would be interested in knowing that this is one of the most
common English mistakes made in yeshivishe circles, even getting into print
quite a bit, nebekh.  Interestingly this mistake is a "second generation" one
-- those who make it are not first or sometimes even second-generation
Americans, and are not native Yiddish speakers. (They're certainly not good
enough Yiddish speakers, in fact to know how to formulate the pluperfect!)

This Yiddish-syntax-translated-directly-to-English phenomenon is well known,
of course; it what makes that distinctively funny Jewish cadence in the works
of innumerable Jewish writers, and the mouths of innumerable Jewish people.

Yo tayere mendelyaner, yiddish is indeed alive and well and functioning vu mir
kukt, me darf nor veln kukn!

Consider the National Yiddish Book Center, of which we have been reading a lot
lately. A great magazine called  der pakn-treger, the book peddler, is created
at the nybc and brings  all kinds of information including how to receive a
catalog of yiddish and english and transliterated materials; cassettes of
stories in yiddish and yiddish classics translated into english, just write
and ask. Available from the Workmen's Circle in NYC is a catalog of books,
music and videos; a list of periodicals from around the world can come to you
from the Congress of Jewish Culture in NYC (there were 44 listings in l994-5);
also in this catalog is a list of places to study Yiddish in NYC and
activities currently scheduled to take place there.  Now, consider contacting
YIVO for a copy of their newsletter which will bring you current information
re: project Judaica in Moscow.  Did you know about the school now in its third
year in Moscow where Yiddish is the language of instruction???  Az me vil, ken
men iberkern di gantse velt!  Yiddish is offered at the Uriel Weinreich
Institute...language,culture and literature; also the Bialystoker Stimme
published by the Bialystoker Center and Bikur Kholim, Inc. is waiting to hear
from you. Please lumer nisht fargesn der bay, created and published by Fishl
Kutner in San Francisco and now celebrating its fifth year.A lebn oyf dayn
