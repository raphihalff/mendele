Subject: Barikadn

Shirshan asks  (6.052) about the song "Barikadn".  The song was written
by Shmerke Kaczerginsky in l926. The second line should be corrected to
"Oyf di gasn geyen arum arbeter-otryadn" - unless your group
"folklorized" the song. The words are printed in our book "Perl fun der
yidisher poezye" Tel Aviv, l974, p. 537.  The music appears in Emil
Saculet's Yidishe folkslider fun rumenye.  We could not locate the
second song - it may not have been printed. We would also like to have
it.

With respect to Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan's inquiry about Tates, mames,
kinderlekh, etc. This is a song by Shmerke Katsherginski, written in
Vilno, 1926. The full text and music can be found in Shmerke
Katsherginski Ondenk-bukh, Buenos Aires 1959, pp. 229-30.

Another reply to Allan Nadler. I can't recall the source but somewhere
in Bashevis he writes that he stopped reading Spinoza when the
philosopher stated that animals had no souls. Sorry that I can't be more
specific. Dovid Noyekh Miller, efsher gedenkstu vu me gefint aza

Subject: More on shnek

Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan suggests (Mendele Vol 6.052) that: " the word
shnek to denote a young person, pejoratively". She gives the example:
"Aza shnek, un zi maynt az zi farshteyt shoyn a krenk." Her explanation
is: "Could it stem from the shneknfrizur recently described on Mendele,
to describe someone so young, too young to know anything, still wearing
braids.....?"

I heard the same pejorative use, but thought that its etimology was a
diversion from using the profanity "schmock" or "shmek". [Similar to the
use "O' shoot" for "O' sh-t".]

Subject: Medem Library in Paris

I'm looking for information about the Medem library in Paris,
particularly its Yiddish holdings.  Has anyone visited? done research
there?  I responded to a posting from the Medem on Mendele a few months
ago, but my mail came back "return to sender." I'd appreciate any
details you can share,

A sheynm dank,

Subject: The first Bat Mitzvah

The story of the first Bat Mitzvah in Levov (1902) must have been
published in the Jewish press in the USA since it was quite controversal
at the time. I speculate that the Yiddish Forward would have published
the story, as the conection between the East and the USA was strong at
the beginning of the century, and the Forward was the largest Jewish
paper. Does anyone have an idea how to find out if, when, and how it was
published in the USA. I am trying to avoid the long way of sitting in
front of a microfilm and reading every issue of the 1902 Forward. Even
if I wanted to read every issue, the microfilm is not available in
Philadelphia. Any help would  be appreciated. Please reply privatly.

Joan Martyr writes...

   Last night (Sunday 18th August) the Gilbert & Sullivan Yiddish Light
   Opera Company of Long Island gave its farewell performance of 'Der
   Yiddishe Mikado' to a packed, sell-out audience at the Steiner
   Theatre in London under the auspices of the Spiro Institute.

   The audience who are already asking when they can buy tickets for
   next year's tour were thrilled by the brilliant staging, the bright
   energetic rendering of the text in Yiddish and English, the beautiful
   costumes and the faultless ensemble work.

   The entire cast, radiating energy and sheer joy, were sustained by
   the pianist. The conductor brought the whole cast together using,
   appropriately, a Japanese fan.

   The romantic duets, sung in Yiddish, had a gentle poignancy and the
   broad comedy interludes gave ample opportunity for humour to which
   the audience responded with spontaneous, delighted laughter. As this
   was the farewell performance the cast came into the audience and we
   were able to express our thanks and pleasure to individual members of
   the cast.

   On a firm handshake I was assured that the Yidishe Pirates of
   Penzance will be invading these shores next year. They will need a
   larger venue.

The stage set included banners bearing the Hebrew aleph-beis written in
the Japanese style. The Chief Executioner's "little list", at least six
feet long and a foot wide, was boldly lettered in the same way.
