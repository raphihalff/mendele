Subject: Tifle/tfile

Zev Kesselman wrote with reference (4.260) to my "etymological" research
about the word "tifle" (Christian house of prayer) and my "finding" that
the name was a deliberate distortion, a transposition on purpose of two
letters in "tfile" (Jewish prayer).

He adds:  "It seems to me that the transposition is more than random.
"Tfile" is Hebrew for prayer,  "tiflus" is Hebrew for nonsense,
frivolity, as in the Mishnaic dictum:  < Kol hamelamed et bito torah,
k'ilu lomdah tiflus > whoever teaches his daughter Torah, it is as if he
taught her frivolousness /Mishnah Sotah, Chapter 3/."

May I add that the word "tifle" itself is found once in Jeremiah, twice
in Job, in Talmud and later writings in the meaning of unseemliness,
tastelessness, and vanity.

Subject: Yiddish in Alaska

I'm trying to dredge up a memory. Perhaps Steven Jacobson can pursue it.
Didn't Alaska have a governor whose name was Boochiever? Wasn't
Boochiever the brother? cousin? uncle? son? of the Yiddish writer
Bovshever?

Subject: Yiddish in Alaska (not Alabama)

If anyone wishes to obtain a copy of my dictionary of Hebraic words and
phrases in Yiddish, they should note that the postal abbreviation for
Alaska is AK, rather than AL (my error). The city name "Fairbanks" and
the zip code 99708 would probably bring the letter here eventually, but
it would be best if it did not have to take a detour via Alabama.

Subject: Tseylem kop

With reference to Leon Lipson's story (4.275,2), Polish Jews, and
probably especially khassidim, called Jews from Lithuania "tseylem kep"
(heads with a cross, or a cross in their heads).

Lithuanian Jews, di litvakes, were misnagdim (a Hebrew-derived word
meaning "opponents" of the khassidim).  They were led by the vilner go'en
and his disciples who conducted a fiery opposition to the khassidic
movement.

The khassidic Jews, whose religious life was full with joy, warmth, and
_hislayves_ (rapturous ardor and ecstasy), considered the litvakes
cool-headed, cold, and cerebral, in sum, without feelings, without
emotions, and therefore nicknamed them "tseylem kep."

Well, litvakes turned it around, and asked:  "Why is a litvisher yid
called a "tseylem kop"?

Their own answer:

"When a litvak wants something, or insists on something, _leygt er zikh
in der breyt, like this -- , un in der leyng, like this |, and together
the two lines form a cross (+)...

(If you tell this story, you make a horizontal hand gesture from right to
left when you say "leygt er zikh in der breyt" (breyt meaning witdth),
and a short vertical hand gesture when you say "leygt er zikh in der
leyng," leyng meaning length.)  The phrase "leygt er zikh in der breyt un
in der leyng" means that he makes every effort to accomplish what he set
out to do.

Thus, a derogatory nickname that attacked the very core of one's faith
(in the recited story above the cross "followed" the misnaged even into
his grave), turns in this "explanation" into a compliment, namely that a
litvak is a man of action and drive.

P.S.   In case you did not guess it, I am a litvak.

Subject: Yiddish literature in translation

In response to Daniella HarPaz's request:

One of my first exposures to Yiddish culture was the very interesting
Yiddish literature class I took last year, taught in English by Dovid
Goldberg.  The class was made up of several students in the Yiddish
graduate program here at Columbia, a few other graduate students, and me,
then a freshman.  The Yiddish students read the assigned works in
Yiddish, and the other graduate students and I read them in translation.
I really enjoyed reading and discussing all the stories, novels, and
poems, but, because of my lack of knowledge, I had a little trouble
putting them into historical context.  It wasn't until my internship at
the National Yiddish Book Center that I really started to understand
where everything fits.

I suggest that you give the students some information on the Yiddish
language and a great deal of cultural and historical background.  Also, I
suggest that you show "Yidl Mitn Fidl."  (That film certainly raised *my*
interest in Yiddish culture.)

Subject: kenen ~ konen / bakenen ~ bakonen ~ bakanen

To add to Mikhl Herzog's posting, then there's variation three ways with
the verb _bak[]nen (zikh_ 'to make someone acquainted with. to make the
acq. of':  bakenen ~ bakonen ~ bakanen.  Although there is no stem _kan_
in Yiddish; i.e., it only appears when prefixed with ba-.

Subject: Mystery cabbage

On Mikhl Herzog's note about 'stuffed cabbage' as [ta:belex] in
Southwestern Poland.  The mystery is 'little doves' -- a calque of the
Slavic term(s) (related to Yiddish -holuptses- , etc., e.g., Polish goLAb
'dove' [that's l-slash, and hook A] ),  meaning '(little) dove/pigeon'.
