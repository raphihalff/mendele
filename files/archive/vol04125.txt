Subject: Klezmer Concert

The 'New York Klezmer Ensemble' will be giving a concert at Beth-El
Synagogue- New Rochelle, NY Sunday Dec. 4th 2 p.m. All profits from the
concert will be used to improve handicapped accessibility and service at
Beth-El. Profits from previous events have allowed the Synagogue to
continue an outreach program to all Jews. In addition to the simplest
things (ramps and large print books) we have special ed Hebrew School
classes, a handicapped washroom, IR listening devices, a signer for the
hearing impaired at Shabat services, visits from local group homes, and
made modifications within the sanctuary to make it accessible to all.
Call (914) 235-2700 for further information about the concert or about
special services for someone you may know.

i should warn all interested mendelnik(e)s that, when i inquired a few
years ago, the price davka was charging was phenomenal. i'd be interested
to know if that has changed. a dank.

Subject: A Yiddish miracle!

The following quotation is taken from "Dateline - World Jewry, September,
1994 as published by the World Jewish Congress."  It reads:

"TOKYO KLEZMER

A new Japanese Yiddish-style Klezmer band is playing to packed audiences
in Tokyo.

The 16 Japanese performers in the group play Chasidic music and sing
Yiddish lyrics which, for the most part, they do not understand."

I wonder if they have groupies that say, "Ryoko-san -- kanst du mir
spielen 'A freyliche nacht in Gan Eden'?"

Subject: Interpretation of words

One of the many reasons I enjoy Mendele so much, is that some of the
letters make old phrases that my father used  many years ago, resurface
for me. Since I was a young child, at the time, I devised my own
interpretations of what he meant, and now maybe someone can tell me if I
was correct.

1. Oranges - Pomegranates - How would you say orange marmalade in yiddish?
I remember my Father telling me a little story (which also shows how we
use tact and delicacy in the Jewish language.) His family in the little
shtetl in B'Polia, Russia, were very poor. When company came, they served
"alain g'macht marantz" (home made orange marmalade?). One day when some
relatives (also poor people) came to visit, my grandmother served this
delicacy and said "Fehyr suhch az ve en der hame." (Act as you would at
home)  I've also figured out that " en der hame" was three words even
though I heard it as "endrame."

2. I asked this question a few weeks ago, when I wrote thanking Zellig
Bach, for his excellent letter on correct Jewish writing.   He mentioned
that at times the letter H was used unnecessarily at the end of a word,
and thus it was a "puste" or empty letter. That made me think of an
expression my father would use about someone he thought was shallow, or
not a serious thinker. He would say, disdainfully, "ehr iz en puste
bocher"  Any other interpretation of this?

3. Again, one of my  father's remarks. When he saw someone he thought
was outlandish, he would say, "zay nor dus bashefinish!" I know nefesh is
soul. But, has anyone heard this expression, and how was it used?

Excuse the poor Yiddish spelling, as I find a big gap in how I remember
hearing it spoken, and the way Zellig, and others, suggest writing it.
But the friendly atmosphere on Mendele makes me brave enough to try to
participate.  Thanks.

Subject: Red vs. fresh oranges

Bob Wilson was kind enough to send me the complete verse of the greenhorn
song, but in my neighborhood the reference was to "red oranges" and not
"fresh oranges."  I do not mean to dispute Bob, but the use of "red" was
one of the very reasons why I always thought "Pomerantzen" meant
pomegranates.  And another thing, the accusation that the cousin had
cheeks like "fresh oranges" is not a descriptive simile.  What about
cheeks looking like fresh oranges would make them attractive?  Am I
incorrect in my memory of the words of this single line of the song?

Subject: Grine kuzine

While Di Grine Kuzine can be found in most Yiddish song books (c.f. E G
Mlotek's Mir Trogn a Gezang), I have not seen many references to the
folkloricization of this particular song.  The original text is
attributed by Chana Mlotek to J. Leiserowitz with music by Abe Schwartz
with the 1922 copyright held by Prizant and Schwartz.  However, my bubbe
used to add a few extra verses.  One that I once wrote down was:

A "boy" hot ir oyse gefunen
Un hot ba ir di beyde tsugenumen
Af yedn "street" flegt er zi vatchen
Yeder nakht flegt er zi patchen.

I was particularly impressed since these added lyrics are quite in
keeping with the style of the song that is replete with the likes of
"next-dorke" "millinery-storke," "dzhab," "Paydays," etc.

For those of you who don't know this tune, listen to it sometime.  It's
positively habit forming.

Sheldon Benjamin

PS:  I count myself among those who find the grammatical, and syntactic
discussions (diatribes?) the least interesting of what appears on
Mendele.  If we were to strip away the jokes, songs, cultural tidbits,
and mayses and put them on some other list, what would remain would
perhaps be some sort of pure linguistic culture but it wouldn't be
Yiddish!  The tone of some recent discussion on Mendele makes me feel
like a proste Yid whose country ways are embarrasing to the big city
Yidn.  Derfishe Yidn Unite!
