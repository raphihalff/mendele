Subject: Phonetics

Yitskhak Kertesz: Stress shift in multisyllabic Yiddish
words of Hebrew origin, like emunA, etc., is usually to the
penultimate syllable and not, in the Hungarian fashion, to
the first. Thus, Yiddish emUne vs. Hungarian accented
Emuna. OK?

Mikhl.

Subject: Where in Brooklyn?

for norman zide:

clearly we come from very different neighborhoods in
brooklyn, since yours had people of italian and jewish
descent while mine had italians and jews, but i will give
you what would be my neighborhood's answer to your question
of whether queen elizabeth is a shikse: you gotta be
kidding. she hasn't been a shikse for nearly half a century
and is now definitely an alte goye.

are you SURE you're from brooklyn??? :)

I don't know if it's the same thing or not, but my
grandmother used to refer to the firehouse in her
(Belorussian) shtetl as the Pozharne Kommande.

Hershel and everyone else should note that the address he
has given for the National Yiddish Book Center is its old
one, although I guess mail will be forwarded from there to
the new one:

     National Yiddish Book Center
