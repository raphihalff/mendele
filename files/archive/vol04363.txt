Subject: Khosn-kale

Dvorah Biasca (4.356) notes that in many languages, male-female pairs are
usually given in that order:  male and female, husband and wife, king and
queen; exceptions (ladies and gentlemen, bride and groom) are rare.
Yiddish seems to go with the flow:  _khosn-kale_, _tate-mame_,
_zeyde-bobe_, _man un vayb_, and even, for 'hook and eye', _mendl un
vaybl_ [Weinreich, 1968].

Dvorah's impression that _khosn_ and _kale_ are what the couple are
called from the engagement until after the ceremony is corroborated by
Weinreich who translates _khosn_ 'bridegroom(-to-be), fiance' and _kale_
'bride(-to-be), fiancee'.   Likewise, _vern a khosn_ (or _kale_) are
translated 'become engaged'.  And _khosn-bokher_ and _kale-moyd_ refer
not even to betrothal, but just to being of marriageable age, i.e., to
betrothability.

Subject: Gel and fuftsn

Dovid Braun:

I think I can help here. In modern High German the word for yellow is
gelb. In some German dialects, especially as you get close to Platt
territory people begin to say bleiwen instead of bleiben. So there is a
cognate with "gelwe", which then drops the "w" and you get "gel". In
Dutch the word is "geel". I've probably oversimplified the process, ober
dos iz alts vos ikh kon aroyskhapn fun zikorn. Efsher iz farkert, un dos
vort "gelb" kumt fun an algemeynem "gelw" vos iz dan vayter gevorn
"gelb", vi men redt in di hekhere lender fun der daytsher shprakh, mit di
lipn tsugemakht.

Fuftsn I don't know too much about, but I do know this, that fuftsn is
identical to my stepmother's Schwyzerduetsch word for 15, not fuenfzehn.

Subject: Yiddish names

Eliyahu Juni:

Agreed, again, that [yeho'yshue] sounds awful.  But in fact, [yehoyshu'e]
sounds awful as well).  It was a try, for whatever it was worth.

Wrt [yosef] in Yiddish usage vs. [yoysef] in Whole Hebrew (formal,
liturgical etc. contexts) this is reminiscent of the melekh/maylekh
distinction made by the interviewee in the film "Image Before My Eyes":
while uttering the prayer, the woman says [melekh], and when giving the
phrase-by-phrase taytsh, she says [maylekh] -- Mikhl Herzog shared this
with us a number of months (years?) ago.

As for all the other facts, impressions, anecdotes, analyses vekedoyme:
some of the phenomena can be explained based on what we already know,
some will mertshem be explained by what we someday will know.  Shkoyekh
to you for your attention to the matters; I'm still recovering from the
lengthy posting.  We'll talk more, if/when I regain my strength.

Subject: yiddish names

i'm still digesting eliyahu juni's virtuoso post on yiddish names but i
have some anecdotal comments:

>Elye, however, is a litvishe moniker which I don't particularly care for...

i happen to be named for a full-fledged down-home galitsianer named
_elye_, my polish-born great-grandfather (mother's side). never heard any
other name for him and i guarantee you there's not a litvak in the whole
clan! in fact, my mother was shayndl and her father was laybl--so no way
elye was a litvak! :)

re heshe, i've got a cousin heshe, 'heshy' or (officially) harold in
english (carpato-rus, father's side). will check on what _he_ thinks his
name evolved from, but it's interesting that, on the same side of the
family, i had an uncle yeshue who was always shiye (or shiyele--he was
the youngest of 8), never heshe.

re stress, what about this: my father was yekhiyl, stressed on the final
syllable, presumably originally yekhiyel, with three syllables, stressed
in yiddish on the penultimate. if i'm right in thinking that the vowel of
the final syllable was lost, is it strange that the stress never moved to
the first syllable? btw, he was usually called khiyl and i never heard
any real diminutive form. is there one? (actually, his name was yitskhok
yekhiyl, but he was never called yitskhok or any variant thereof.)

ellen ( < elye) prince ( < firenze --but that's another--sephardic--
story)

Subject: Yiddish on the Mac

Yekhiel-Yosef Reisner asks about Yiddish language word processing
software for the Macintosh.

In my experience, Nisus Writer (now in Version 4.0) is the most useful
software for non-Roman alphabets. It can simultaneously utilize Hebrew,
Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Cyrillic, Greek and Roman characters in the
same document, each with proper orientation. It also offers the special
Roman alphabet characters used in Eastern European languages.

Nisus Software may be contacted at:
107 Cedros Ave.
Solano Beach, CA  92075
USA
Phone: 1-800-224-4444 (USA), 1-619-481-1477 (International)
Fax: 1-619-481-6154

I am a satisfied user of Nisus Writer and have no other connection with
them.
