Subject: Misnagdishe songs

The song Arnie Kuzmack remembers (5.254) appears, sung by the late Herschel
Bernardi, on "The Yiddish Dream: A heritage of Jewish song," issued as a
double LP by Vanguard Recording Society and featuring many artists. The song
is called, on the record, "Chiri Bim"--but that's a common "la-la-la" in both
khsidic songs and misnagdish parodies.

The verse referred to is sung by Bernardi as follows:

eynmol shabes baym rebn's tish, take beynashmoshes,
iz a yidn gevorn nit git, iz er gefaln in khaloshes.
nemt der rebe beyde hent un leygt aroyf afn korbn:
gloybt mir yo tsi gloybt mir nit --
nor der yid iz glaykh geshtorbn.

(One shabes at the rebe's table, just at twilight, a Jew was stricken and fell
into a faint. The rebe placed both his hands on the victim, and you may
believe it or not, but the Jew promptly--died.)

Typically, and egregiously in error, the liner notes to the Vanguard album
ascribe the song to "the Chassidic tradition(!)"

Subject: The Yiddish canon

A portion of the GDYL's electronic texts (periodical material
optically-scanned in the U.K.) now resides at The Hebrew University. The
bibliographic worksheets (and related materials) prepared by Dr. David
Goldberg and under his supervision are in Butler Library, Columbia University
(copies of "uncertified" bibliographic entries may also reside at The Hebrew
University). The GDYL computer program, text, and database files are in YIVO's
possession; The Hebrew University has a copy, as well.

Apart from the GDYL text corpus Dr. Wolf has written about, the following are
also in electronic form:

The Sophia letters of 1533
The Jerusalem letters from the 1560s
The Cracow letters of 1588
The Prague Letters of 1619

My description of these works may not be precise, writing as I am about them
from memory. All of these letters are available in publications (if anyone
would like bibliographic references, I'd be happy to provide them.)

The several sets of letters constitute a relatively small, but interesting
corpus.) The electronic versions of these texts, like those of the GDYL, could
benefit from some verification.

Anyone interested in these should feel free to contact me directly for more
information and qualifications.

Subject: A.A. Roback's contributions to Yiddish

Avrohom A. Roback (1890 - 1965), who received his doctorate  in Psychology
and Philosophy from Harvard, was a prolific writer in both Yiddish and
English.

He was a great admirer of Yiddish literature, and in many of his English books
he introduced, discussed, and extolled its particular richness, as well as the
unique character of Yiddish.

Roback published in Yiddish the following books, among others:

_Eyfemisms [euphemisms] in Yidish_;
_Yidish Hashpoes [Influences] af English_;
_The Imperye [empire] Yidish_;
_Der folksgayst [the spirit of the people] in Yidish_.

And In English, again among other books, many of them on psychology, he
published:

_Jewish Influence in Modern Thought_;
_Curiosities of the Yiddish Literature_;
_The Story of Yiddish Literature_;
_ J. L. Perets:  Psychologist of Literature_.

In the literary journal _di Tsukunft_ Yudl Mark wrote:  "Roback ... plumbed
the psychological depths of the Yiddish literature, bacame an enthusiastic
Peretsyaner, and the seeker of what was unique, special and singular in the
Yiddish literature and in Yiddish proper."

Roback was not only a _khoyveyv Yiddish_ [lover of Yiddish] but its guardian
as well, and whenever he encountered an injustice to Yiddish, he energetically
stood up in defense of its honor and respect.  The following is an interesting
illustration:

When the telephone company introduced the _rotary_ dial system, by which a
caller could directly reach one's party -- until then one had to ask the
telephone operator to make the connection -- the New England telephone company
published in 1931 a booklet with instructions on how to operate the new
equipment.  The booklet was replete with daytshnerisms [Germanisms], all in
Yiddish letters, such as "immer, gebraucht, vorbereitet," and many others, as
well as English words, also in Yiddish letters, such as "subscriber, number,
letter, dial tone, service calls, receiver, exchange."

Roback promptly wrote to the company, pointing out that this type of language
is offensive to Yiddish readers and speakers, and that in no way does it
satisfactorily explain the appropriate steps of the new telephone calling
system.

And he offered his own instructions in a clear, simple, and correct Yiddish.

The New England telephone company then published a second, _revised_ issue of
its instruction booklet in Yiddish, in   accordance with each and  all of
Roback's suggestions.

Here are the then innovative Yiddish terms he suggested for parts of the
telephone and the operations:

                        dial   redl
                     to dial   redlen
                   dial face   redlblat, tsiferblat
                 finger stop   hatshik
                    exchange   gegnt tsentrale
                    receiver   traibl
                  party line   beshutfesdike linye
                   dial tone   redlton
                    operator   ruferke
             toll department   vaytrufike opteylung
          long distance call   vayter ruf
                     service   badinung

I believe that almost all of these terms could still be used today in proper
Yiddish.

It is interesting to note that in those days, more than fifty years ago, there
was a large Yiddish-speaking population in New England.

It is of further interest that in one respect almost nothing has been changed
since 1931:  When a Yiddish translation is called for, someone totally
ignorant of Yiddish but who for no good reason in the world!  believes
himself capable of doing the translation, offers his "good" services...  A
case in point is the outrageous Yiddish translation of the 1990 Census Bureau
Questionnaire. (See the article "Yiddish and the Census Bureau" (Congress
Monthly, January 1992.)

Subject: Bokser

Hershl Hartman:

Thank you for trying to clarify your question [5.257].  Unfortunately the
clarification does not address what seems to me to be the problematical
presuppositions of the question: that there ought to be a documentable reason
for abandoning one word in favor of another and that Jews must have used
certain Hebrew words when they began speaking Yiddish.

So why do you think that the Hebrew term for carob was ever used _in yiddish_?
The association of bokser and tu b'shvat, like many of the minhogim of the day,
may well be an innovation of 16th century mekubolim ("cabbalists"), in which
case the Hebrew term may never have been used, much less "abandoned".

A couple of etymological notes:

'Khoruv' is not found in Biblical Hebrew. According to the Even-Shoshan
dictionary the word entered Aramaic from Assyrian. Both the Hebrew and Aramaic
forms are known to us from the Talmud.

There is no reason to jump to the conclusion that bokser came to Yiddish from
New High German. You should check the word in Grimms' Woerterbuch for its
history first.

Your shames will be away for the next two weeks in a phone-free zone, which
means no Mendele for a while.  Please continue to write.  Zayt mir ale gezunt.
