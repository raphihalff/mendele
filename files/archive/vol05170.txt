Subject: Got fun Avrom

I would be grateful for a reference to a published version of the Yiddish
prayer "Got fun Avrom" (or for the text, if anyone has it handy).

(I am not looking for H. Royzenblat's poem of the same name.)

Subject: Crickets (zoolinguistic query)

Any theories (or knowledge) about why _lamedvovnikl_ can mean 'cricket'
or 'grasshopper'?  Is it that they are usually hidden from sight?

I would like to know if anyone knows of or has used a hebrew/yiddish
scanning program.  A few years ago, while on vacation in Israel, I saw a
demonstration of a hebrew scanning program by a company called Ligature.
Thanks in advance.

Subject: Kitke

I have had several queries from students here in South Africa about the
derivation and frequency/area of usage of the word 'kitke' which is more
often described as a 'khale' elsewhere in the world. There is an entirely
mythical belief here that this word is unique to South African Yiddish
speakers and their descendants. Quite evidently this is untrue, since the
word is listed in Harkavy (there defined as 'a twisted loaf'). However it
does not appear in Weinreich. Why not? Is there/was there any difference
between a khale (for Sabbath only) and a kitke (a bread more vokhediks?)
Any information will be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Name pairings

In a recent posting, Perets Mett proposes that the name pairing "Yekhiel
Mikhl" originates with Yekhiel Mikhl of Zlotshev, an early khsidisher
rebe [5.166].  I question that.  On a genealogical hunt in Yerusholayim a
couple of years ago, I came across Yehiel Mikhl Finklshteyn, buried on
the Mount of Olives, and registered at the Ashkenazi Khevre Kdishe as "a
great rabbi of Slutsk".  Slutsk was a bastion of Misnagdim, and prided
itself on having "spanked" the Baal Shem Tov when he paid them an
"educational visit" (the stone on which this was supposed to have
occurred was, legend has it, revered by Slutsker for years). In any case,
Encyclopedia Judaica cites at least two Yehiel Mikhls (spelled "Jehiel
Michael"!) prior to the Zlotshever (his years are given as c.1731-1786):
Yehiel Mikhl Ben Eliezer, who died in 1648, and Yekhiel Mikhl Ben Yehude
Leyb he-hosid, 1680-1728.

The origins of "Yehiel Mikhl" are still, IMHO, up for grabs.

Subject: Name pairings

Along the lines of Yechiel-Mekhl and Itshe-Mayer, described by Perets
Mett as named after khsidishe rebbes, there are some very common pairings
in the Lubavitch world, named after the Lubavitcher rebbes.
Menakhem-Mendl and Yosef-Yitskhok come to mind.
