Subject: Rote brik

Does anyone have knowledge of any humorous or subtle meaning of this
expression.  A genealogic colleague who lives in Texas said that, when he
was a kid, whenever this phrase was used it was the signal for a great
deal of laughter from the adults in the room.

I know of no particular humor within it and ask the Mendelniks if it
contains a secret about which I know nothing.

Subject: transliteration

Such software exists and has been implemented for Tamil; so I am sure it
is possible for Yiddish.  With Tamil, three or four lines are used to
reproduce a single line.  Thus, if we wanted to write khof, we would
have:

             _____
                   \
                   |
                   |
            ______/

This took five lines, but I haven't thought it out fully; somebody with
more effort may be able to do it in three lines, and better. I can refer
people to the appropriate persons who did it for Tamil; I am sure they
would be willing to lend their knowledge.

Subject: Yekes - mir zenen do!

There are a couple of other humorous explanations for the origin of the
term.

One, Adam was a yeke, and as prrof, we have hashem saying in bereishis,
3:9 And the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him, Where art thou;
the hebrew for the last three words is ayeka!

Two, hashem himself was a yeke.  In shmos 3:14, when moshe rabeynu asks
hashem how he should justify to the Israelites his attempt to take over
the leadership, hashem tells him: 'And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I
AM.' Tell them 'I AM sent me.'  The words 'I AM THAT I AM,'if read in
Hebrew with the substitution of 'y' for 'h' as is customary in saying out
the different names of hashem as in 'elokim,' reads yeke asher yeke, or
The yeke that I am, indeed the yeke that I am!

Subject: "Mazshge", a vort?

Is anyone familiar with the word "mazshge" in Yiddish?
Used in a friends family in the middle of an English
sentence "...to mazshge something up..." ie., to mix it up.
...or, "that's mazshgeed...".

Any suggestions? Is this simply a case of oystrakhtn a vort?

Subject: The Mechitza of Iron

For those of you who managed to read last Saturday's New York Times, you
will know with great sorrow of the passing of the much loved and admired
Reb Shlomo Carlebach, who has entertained millions of us with his
heavenly music for the last 35 years or so. His funeral was held
yesterday and an outside service was held for him outside of his
synagogue on West End Avenue in New York City. The police had blocked off
the streets in the immediate neighborhood to enable the vast crowd to be
accommodated in the street. It rained during the service but it was
difficult to distinguish the rain drops from the tear drops.

After a moving and well-deserved service during which many passionate
speeches were given by friends and family members it was announced that
Shlomo was to be buried in Israel and his body was to be taken directly
after the service to Kennedy Airport for transfer to an El Al plane. Four
buses were provided for anyone who felt the need to accompany him on his
last journey. Needless to say, the busses were filled in no time at all
and under police escort all the way to the airport we accompanied Shlomo.

What was so remarkable to me was the journey to the airport. All the way
people in the bus sang Shlomo's melodies between their profuse tears.
Many of the melodies I instantly recognized but there were so many I had
never heard before. Someone remarked that this was probably the first
time that Shlomo had arrived at the airport in time.

At the airport the crowds were loathe to take their leave of the revered
rabbi. The coffin was transported up a ramp to the Customs Hall at Gate
7, with his followers and friends gently touching the hearse for as long
as they could. Miraculously two lit candles appeared on the concrete
posts leading to the ramp. Throughout the vigil Shlomo's songs were sung.
When the moment arrived to finally take leave of the coffin, the people
simply refused to budge. The policemen had no choice but to bring down
the steel shutters.

May he rest in peace; shalom to you Shlomo, you will be forever
remembered with love.
