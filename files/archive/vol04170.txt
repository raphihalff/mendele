                      ROMANIZATION, YIVO-STYLE

1.  What follows is a simplified version of the romanization
(transcription) convention developed by YIVO.  It is easy to use, once
you have gotten the hang of it--not a daunting task.  The scheme is quite
straightforward, and it provides a uniform way to write _any_ Yiddish
word in any Yiddish dialect; if you can say it, you can write it, and be
sure that your readers will know just how you're saying it.  What more
can be asked of a transcription scheme? Mendele subscribers are
encouraged to use the YIVO system, in the interest of clear
communication; but it is not a requirement for submissions.

2.  The first column gives the names of the Yiddish letters and letter-
combinations; the second column gives their approximate sound
equivalents, for the most part in English; be warned that some of the
English examples will be interpreted differently by native speakers of
English from various dialect regions.  The third column illustrates the
transcription with Yiddish words. (The letters in square brackets in the
first column occur only in words derived from Hebrew or Aramaic; their
transcription in the third column is preceded by [H].)  Writers not
familiar with the Yiddish alphabet can ignore the first column
altogether.

3.  Note that the consonants and most of the vowels are pronounced in
much the way that some other European languages pronounce them.  There
are a few possible exceptions, arising out of dialectal differences.  For
example: the Yiddish word for "good" is ALWAYS spelled giml-vov-tes, and
the table shows that the Standard pronunciation of the vov (except when
it's at the end of a syllable) is like the u in English "put"; so the
Standard pronunciation is /gut/, rhyming with English "put".  But the
dialects of many native speakers call for pronouncing this vov as /i/,
and these speakers would say and transcribe the word as /git/; such
variants are welcome on Mendele.

4.  The diphthongs may require some thought at first; /ey/ romanizes the
sound in "Hey!" or "grey"; /ay/ stands for the sound of the "ay" in
"Mayan" or the "y" in "my"; and /oy/ transcribes the "oi" sound in "oil"
or "noise" (so the familiar expression of complaint or pain or surprise
is romanized /oy vey/, and the Standard Yiddish for "my mother" is
written /mayn mame/.)

5.  Note that the shtumer (silent) alef has no sound equivalent or
transcription.  In Yiddish, it is written at the beginning of words
before the vowels and diphthongs pronounced /u/, /oy/, /i/, /ey/, and
/ay/.

     Some General Points (adapted from Zellig Bach, Mendele 4.102)

Each letter (or letter combination) in the third column has a specific
sound. Remember that the YIVO scheme is meant to be efficient,
unambiguous and easy to use; unnecessary letters just confuse the reader.

So:

1.  No double consonants; they don't tell you anything.  Write:  ale,
alemen, bobe, feder, got [God], shabes, yidish (NOT alle, allemen, bobbe,
fedder, gott, shabbes, yiddish).

2.  Excise the puste (empty) h's, since they provide no additional
information: No "h" after the stressed vowel in words of German origin.
Write:  amol, yor, geyn, shteyn (NOT amohl, yohr, gehn, shtehn).  And no
"h"s after the final vowel in words of Hebrew or Slavic origin; they
don't add any information either. Write:  khale, kale, khevre, metsie,
take (NOT khaleh, kaleh, khevreh, metsieh, takeh).

3.  Skip the shtume (silent) e's:  Write:  bisl, fargesn, gutn, lakhn,
zisn, shtetl (NOT bisel, fargesen, guten, lakhen, zisen, shtetel).
