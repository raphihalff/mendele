As we begin a new year of Mendele the shames wishes to thank all of our
correspondents for making our list what it is.  And to invite all those who
have not yet written to join those who have.

When Mendele was small it was still possible to send welcome messages to new
subscribers inviting them to send us short introductions.  Not long ago your
shames tried to fold such a welcome note into the one that the the listserver
automatically issues.  It didn't work.  Instead there was a brief flurry of
"undigested" (single) posts.  A shames an umgelumperter!  We may try again
some day.  Meanwhile, if you haven't introduced yourself, please do so.

Un yetst, nokhamol afn rehktn fus.

Subject: Shmukler

The other day I disgraced myself (nokh a mol) at the Yale-New Haven leyn kreiz
by confidently declaring that "shmukler" means jeweler. A mitglid produced
Weinreich, who defines the word as lacemaker. Hoping for some miracle, I
checked Harkavy--keyn nes. Then I hoped that I was guilty, at the most, of a
daytchmerism: no luck there either, at least in my small Langenscheidt.

I wish to do penance by reporting competetent information on the semantic
history of the word. Was I a zumerdiker nar to assume a connection to German
Schmuk = adornment, pl = jewlery? Is there a non-Germanic root in question?
Some birfurcation of meanings?

Subject: Numerical values of alef-beyz

A postscript to Zellig's post  (5.317):

Russian Jews used to refer in horror to the "shvartse meye-nikes," the "Black
Hundreds," who were encouraged -- and sometimes ordered -- by the Tsarist
government to conduct pogroms against Jews.

Subject: Numerology

Zellig Bach in Mendele 5.317 touched only very briefly on the use of Hebrew
letters for numbers.  Of course the entire art (science?) of Gematriya is rife
in Hebrew, but for some reason, one finds less of it in Yiddish.

In addition to the examples given by Bach, there is the "lamed-vovnik".
According to tradition, the entire world continues to exist due to the z'khus
of thirty six righteous people.  Lamed plus Vov equal thirty six, and each of
thse hidden saints is a lamed-vovnik.

Of course, the numerology also helps when one wishes to refer to someone else
in a pejorative way.  Calling someone an akhzig-naynzig is much more socially
acceptable than the less subtle term, and is less likely to earn the user a
bloody nose.
