Subject: CYCO

I'm looking for some basic information on the Central Yiddish Culture 
Organization, often known as CYCO. When was it formed, where, why, who 
were the key people and/or organizations involved, what different 
addresses was it at from founding to now?   There was a fourth conference 
of CYCO in 1944 - where and when were the first three?  Subsequent 
conferences? Were there any organizational congresses? And sources for 
further information? How difficult would it be to compile a list of things 
CYCO published over the years?

In regard to Shimon Frank's inquiry regarding a song having the rhythmic 
refrain "ay yay yay yay  ay yay yay! nisim un nifloes! - I remember my 
mother singing the following:

"Der rebbe bavayzt a vunder - ikh hob aleyn gezen
Er geyt arayn in vaser un kumt aroys a naser
ay yay yay yay  ay yay yay!
nisim mit nifloes!"

Hope this helps.

Mit di hartsikste grusn,

In reply to the enquiry by Shimon Frank, this comical song poking 
(gentle) fun at the Hasidic rebbe is printed on page 130 of Eleanor and 
Joseph Mlotek's "Songs of Generations" published by the Workmen's  Circle, 
New York.

Subject:  shtepnmakher, kholivkes

My father (92) knew immediately what kholivkes and shtepnmakher meant. Er 
hot gezogt az er fleygt shtepn kholivkes in rusland ven er un zayne brider 
hobn gemakht shikh tsu farkoyfn afn shvartsn market in der tsayt fun krig.

Kholivkes and kholyeves were the uppers of a shoe or boot, respectively, 
and shtepn was the process of taking a hide of leather and cutting, 
shaping, sewing, and finishing it into kholivkes that would then be given 
to the shister to assemble with other parts and materials into 
ready-to-wear shoes.

My father accented the first syllable of kholivkes and shtepn, but put the 
accent on the second syllable of kholyeves.

Subject:  shtepnmakher, kholivkes

I am a Litvak born in Wilno.  The term that comes to mind is 
kamashn-shteper.  This refers to the tradesman who applies the upper part 
of a high boot to the lower part; shtepn means to sew.  I have never heard 
of this word to mean quilting.  Furthermore, in my Uriel Weinreich 
dictionary I found kamash to mean "gaiter, spat, low-laced boot."

Subject: shtepnmakher, kholivkes

My father (born in Goworowo, Poland 1910, died in NY in 2004), who had 
many occupations throughout his life first started working as a 
kamashn-shteper or cholewkarz/kholewkarz. You are right. Cholewkarz is 
Polish for uppers maker, and kamashn-shteper is the Yiddish term.   My 
father used both terms. He used to make all the parts of a shoe, or boot, 
except the sole.

Subject: Dovid Fram

Dovid Fram is indeed a very interesting topic for research. I am already 
looking forward reading your thesis in the future.
To your question whether Fram was reading Romantics I can say the 
following: I do not know about work of Keats, Wordsworth or other English 
Romantics being available in Yiddish in early 20th century Lithuania, but 
I think you should consider the influence of the Russian poets of the so 
called "Golden Age of Russian Poetry."  It would be like Pushkin, 
Lermontov, Tyutchev and others. As a student of the Russian gymnazium and 
a fluent speaker of Russian David Fram was surely familiar with their 
works. And as far as I remember some of the Fram's works, such a 
comparison would be quite promising, I think.

All the best
