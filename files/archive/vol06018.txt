Subject: Three aspects of Yiddish

As one who has been a "lurker", by marriage, for the past several years,
I believe the long running discussion trying to answer the question "Is
Yiddish dying?" is basically flawed because the wrong question is being
asked.

The real question should be, "Which part of Yiddish is dying?".  From
all the postings in the past years it is clear to me that the "Yiddish"
being talked about has three aspects.

A. The Yiddish of academia.
B. The spoken Khasidic Yiddish.
C. The feeling of nostalgia for the Yiddish word and the connection to the
culture of the shtetl.

(Obviously one may feel connected to more than one aspect, but the
question remains.)

Numerous postings attribute to the fact that the Yiddish of academia is
alive and flourishing.

One cannot doubt that Khasidic Yiddish is vibrant and growing. I can
attest to the Yiddish I have heard spoken by boys while playing a
baseball game. It was a shock to hear "throw it" in Yiddish.

As our generation and the next generations pass on, will the feelings of
nostalgia pass on as well,  or will time take its toll on nostalgia?  It
is apparent to me,  as I observe the grandchildren and
great-grandchildren of my friends,  that time is winning.  I believe
that nostalgia cannot be taught, it must be caught.

Which part of Yiddish is dying?

Academic Yiddish will keep the Yiddish literature and culture of the
past thousand years alive. Khasidic Yiddish will keep a vibrant and
evolving spoken Yiddish alive. Only the Yiddish of nostalgia will
disappear in future generations.

The real problem may not be the dying of a language but rather the fact
that people fail to accept the three aspects as equal partners in
"Yiddish".

Subject: Graphomania revisited

I assume that enough time has gone by to ask again, if ever so politely.
I last asked in vol 3.289, March 16, 1994, and hope that a new
generation of readers will be more responsive.  I received zero [0!]
answers to my last posting.

The subject is graphomania, a concept common in Yiddish literary
analysis as well as in Hebrew literary analysis and foreign to me as a
reader of English/American literature. The idea is that too many people
write too much junk, putting a burden on poor overworked editors, etc.
Too many untalented people.  Surely we native English speakers are not
less prolix in our writing habits?!  But we only have untalented
writers, hopelessly inadequate scribblers, etc.  But no graphomaniacs.

Can anyone help with the origin of graphomania as a concept,
linguistically, ideationally?

Thanks.

Subject: Fargin, farginen

Can anyone help with the origin of the word/concept, fargin? The word
has slipped into modern Hebrew from the Yiddish too and we learn that
Israel lacks only two things, neft [oil deposits] and firgun [letting
others bask in their success without envy, spite or ridicule].

Thanks in advance.

Subject: Plays and operettas Franz Kafka saw

If someone is interested (I know from letters that is) with theatre,
Franz Kafka and Yiddish, I get a list of plays and operettas seen or
read by Franz Kafka (from E.T.Beck "Kafka and the Yiddish Theater")
based on Kafka's letters and diaries. I am very interested with it.

[The list is rather long and can be had either from the shames or
preferably from the undersigned.]

To almost all that plays and operettas I can add references, which tell
you what Franz Kafka said about it! I will do it on your request.  So -
please let me know in which are you interested.

About the Yiddish theater maybe you want to see: Ignats Shiper,
"Geshikhte fun Yidishn Teater, Kunst, un Drame fun di eltere Tsaytn biz
1750", 4 vols, Warsaw, 1923-28.

Subject: Translation standards

Several years ago a university press asked me to look at a translation
from Yiddish that was under consideration for publication. The editor
was surprised when I asked whether I could get a copy of the original
text; it had apparently not occurred to her that there was any point in
checking the accuracy of the translation.

I was reminded of this incident while reading a translation of an essay
by the Yiddish literary critic Bal-Makhshoves in a volume published in
1994 by the Jewish Publication Society.  I realized that I had a copy of
the original and amused myself by reading both versions in parallel.  I
found myself less and less amused as I noticed some of the things that
had been allowed into print.  For example:

        1. "Zey, di shrayber, hobn mit a mol fargesn, az s'iz shoyn azoy
        zeyer mazl tsu kleybn shtroy far tsveyerley tsigl, tsu baakern
        tsveryerley shprakhn."

	"These writers themselves suddenly forgot that it is their fate
        to gather straw for two kinds of goats [instead of _bricks_], to
        acquire [instead of _to cultivate_] two languages."

	2. "...di sphrakh fun brener, shofman un and." "...the language
         of Brenner, Shafman, and And [instead of _others_].

	3. "frantsoyzishn" "Franz Josef".

My point here is not so much to criticize the translator (since to err
is human--although it doesn't hurt to consult with someone else), but to
raise the issue of quality control for translations. Doesn't anyone
(editors, publishers, critics) care?  It's remarkable, by the way, how
rarely reviewers say anything about the quality of a translation--a pet
peeve of mine, not on my own behalf (I'm not a translator), but on
behalf of colleagues and others whose knowledge and talent I admire and
respect.
