Shulamis
Yiddish Operetta

The romantic operetta *Shulamis* was written in 1880 by Abraham
Goldfaden, the Father of the Yiddish Theater.  We present this rare
revival of one of his greatest works with songs sung in the original
Yiddish, but with dialogue in English translation.  Goldfaden's musical
style derives from synagogue chant, folk song, and French and Italian
opera.  The song "Rozhinkes mit Mandlen," one of over twenty musical
numbers in *Shulamis,* has earned a lasting place in Jewish folklore.

Subject: FULL TEXT REVIEW: Robinson on POLIN, Volume 6

=====================================================================

POLIN: A JOURNAL OF POLISH-JEWISH STUDIES  Volume 6.
Blackwell Publishers for the Institute for Polish-Jewish
Studies, Oxford, 1991.
 
     The study of Polish Jewry is at once fascinating and
complex.  It involves an arduous set of languages (Polish,
Yiddish and Hebrew, just for starters) as well as the
knowledge that nearly everything one touches can be fuel
for some rather incendiary political and ideological
disputes, of which the holocaust of European Jewry during
the Second World War is merely the most prominent.  Because
of these difficulties, Polish Jewry, though long recognized
as of great importance to our understanding of Jewish
history and thought, has tended to be relatively neglected.
POLIN is the result of a concerted attempt to rectify this
neglect.
 
     The journal is truly a cooperative effort on the part
of scholars in Poland, Israel and other countries and
attacks the subject matter from a wide variety of
disciplinary perspectives.  The articles published tend to
shed light not merely on the "state of the art" of research
on Polish Jewry, but also on resources available which
could be brought to bear on that subject.
 
     The present volume deals with a unified subject: the
Jews of Lodz, 1820-1939.  It is largely the result of a
cooperative effort on the part of the Institute of History
of the University of Lodz and, with but one major
exception, all the articles are written by scholars from
that university.  What becomes eminently clear is that
Lodz, the second-largest city in Poland after Warsaw should
be of great interest to researchers, not least because,
unlike Warsaw, the city and its governmental archives was
not destroyed during the War.  This means that archival
sources, utilized by nearly all the authors and
painstakingly described in Jacek Walicki's "Sources for the
History of the Jewish Community in Lodz in the Years 1918-
1939" (pp. 119-132) may be employed in a number of ways to
help determine the nature and character of Lodz Jewry.
 
     The articles by the Polish scholars are almost
uniformly good. The only real caveat is that most treat the
Jewish community of Lodz from the outside looking in.  They
are less able in general to give a picture of the Jewish
community from the "inside".  This makes Robert M.
Shapiro's article, "Aspects of Jewish Self-Government in
Lodz, 1914-1939" so important. Professor Shapiro made the
Lodz Jewish community the subject of his doctoral
dissertation at Columbia University.  He has the necessary
linguistic preparation and scholarly sensitivity to deal in
a serious manner with issues internal to the Lodz unity.
His article is in a sense a precis of his dissertation and
makes one impatient for its publication in full.
 
     The studies published in this volume constitute a
promising beginning for the study of Lodz Jewry prior to
the Second World War.  The studies stop with the year 1939,
when Polish Jewry literally began to cease to exist. No
studies dealing with the Lodz Ghetto or any other aspect of
the Nazi holocaust were dealt with in this volume.  The
only contemporary article is Natan Gross' "Requiem for the
Jewish People (Polish Literary Judaica in the Years
1987-1989)" (pp. 295-308) which chronicles the fascinating
resurgence of the publication of Judaica in a Poland almost
without a Jewish population.
 
     POLIN should be recommended reading for anyone
interested in European Jewish history in modern times.  It
has the fascination of an archaeological dig as remnants,
saved from destruction, are utilized to create an image of
a community which is no more.
