Subject: Yitshak Rabin (z"l) shloyshim on The Yiddish Voice

On behalf of the all-volunteer staff of the Yiddish Voice radio program,
a Yiddish-language weekly radio program heard in Boston on WUNR 1600 AM,
Wednesdays, 7:30 - 8:30 p.m., I'd like to respectfully convey our
condolences to the Rabin family. We share in the sadness of Jews
worldwide.

On tomorrow's Wednesday, December 6, 1995, broadcast, we observe the
Shloyshim with an entire program dedicated to the memory of Yitshak Rabin
z"l.  The program includes: (1) A eulogy (Hesped) by Mr.Simon Simons,
Principle of Congregation Mishkan Tefilla's Hebrew School in Chestnut
Hill, Massachusetts; (2) three poems composed just for this occasion and
read by Miriam Libenson, whose poetry has been published in periodicals
in the US and Israel in both Hebrew and Yiddish; (3) an interview
conducted on Dec. 5, 1995 with Zwi Davidovitz, resident of Givatayim,
Israel, a Holocaust survivor and a veteran of every war in Israel since
1948, several times wounded, expressing one Israeli citizen's grief as
well as hopes in the aftermath of the assassination; and (4) an interview
conducted on Dec. 5, 1995 with Yosl Mlotek, managing editor of the
_Forverts_, the world's leading Yiddish-language weekly newspaper, with
his thoughts on the Rabin assassination.

This program is hosted and produced by myself, Mark H. David, and Hasia
Segal, who conducted the interviews with Mlotek and Davidovitz.

Subject: Meaning of yidishkayt

In connection with the recent discussion that involved the "correct" use
of the word, yidishkayt, following is a footnote I just encountered in
the late Irving Howe's "World of Our Fathers" (p. 16):

"Like other important terms in cultural discourse, _Yiddishkeit_(sic) has
no single, agreed-upon meaning. No one has a monopoly on the term and,
naturally enough, different groupings of opinion within the Jewish world
have used it in different ways. Yet there may be the possibility of some
common, minimal usage.

"As I use the term here, _Yiddishkeit_ refers to that phase of Jewish
history during the past two centuries which is marked by the prevalence
of Yiddish as the language of the east European Jews and by the growth
among them of a culkture resting mainly on that language. The culture of
_Yiddishkeit_ is no longer strictly that of traditional Orthodoxy, yet it
retains strong ties to the religious past. It takes on an increasingly
secular character yet is by no means confined to the secularist elements
among Yiddish-speaking Jews. It refers to a way of life, a shared
experience, which goes beyond opinion or ideology."

I found alongside those paragraphs my marginal note, reading:
"yidishkayt=Jewishness, reflecting the emergence of an ethnic, national
identity."

Subject: Australian Yiddishe Nayes closes

The Board of Directors of the Australian Jewish News announced today the
closure of the Oystralishe Yiddishe Nayes after over 60 years of
continuous weekly publication. The final issue will come out at the end
of December 1995.

Subject: Bawdy Yiddish

The recent request for Bawdy Yiddish troubles me a bit.

I enjoy mendele enormously, as do others. Yiddish profanity and vulgar
usage does not appeal to me. My parents would say (grammar and
transcription errors aside) "past nish tsu zayn a proster yid".
