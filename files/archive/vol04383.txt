Subject: Aramaic dead?! Khas vekholile

Moshe Waldoks, shem zikh!  "Thanks to "brich shmey" even though Aramaic
has not been spoken for close to two millenia its sound resounds
throughout synagogues all over the world."  Not a bit!  Modern Aramaic is
the "Yiddish" of the Jewish and Christian minorities in Kurdistan and a
few smaller spots in the Middle East.  The Muslim majority (10 or 20
million) speak Kurdish, a language related to Persian, but the native
language of the Christians and Jews is Aramaic; I guess there are roughly
200,000 speakers.  The Jews have all (borkhashem) gone to Israel, where
their Aramaic is popularly called Kurdit, and most of the Christians, who
call themselves Assyrians or Chaldeans, have emigrated too, to Europe and
North America.  In Chicago, Detroit, and San Diego you can hear radio
programs and sometimes even TV in the language.  There are even piyutim
which the Kurdish Jews recite in shul in their modern colloquial Aramaic,
which has of course changed a good deal in the past 2000 years.  In the
1970's at this time of year I heard a Kurdish Hakham in Jerusalem telling
his congregants about the laws of Peysakh.  He mentioned the (old)
Aramaic text "Kol Hamira ve-Hami'a" which one says at the time of
searching for khomets, and said that anyone who cannot understand it in
the original may recite a translation into "our language"!

I've exchanged e-mail messages in modern Aramaic with Prof. Yona Sabar of
UCLA, who is a native speaker, having left Iraqi Kurdistan as a teenager.

By the way, the Jews and Christians of Kurdistan agree that the latter
are the Assyrians who exiled the former to Assyria, i.e. northern Iraq,
i.e. Kurdistan, in the 700's BCE.  Consequently the ten lost tribes
aren't lost; they're here, speaking Aramaic.  Vos den?

Subject: Aramaic

A note to Moshe Waldoks: Aramaic has in fact never ceased to be spoken.
Modern forms persist in such variants as Syriac among the Christians of
Syria, Targumic among the Kurdish Jews, and in other variants among
various Middle Eastern Christian denominations.

With the exception of Syriac, a literary church language akin in status
to Latin, these Aramaic languages served as a daily means of
communication in some towns, surrounded by Arabic speaking populations.
Although neo-Aramaic dialects are not mutually comprehensible with
Talmudic Aramaic, they are direct descendents of popular Aramaic before
the rise of Islam.  I have heard that in Detroit the "Chaldean" Christian
immigrant community maintains Aramaic radio in Detroit, although I cannot
confirm this.  Among the Christian dialects, I believe that Syriac is by
far the most conservative.  It is written in its own script.

As for archaic Jewish Aramaic, I have often thought that it would be fun
to revive it, and pronounce much better than modern Hebrew which has a
European phonetic inventory.  At present I believe that all living
Aramaic dialects are seriously threatened by their coterritorial
languages, much as is the case with Yiddish.

Subject: Sanctification of Yiddish

As a response to Moshe Waldoks' remarks in Vol.4.378, let me offer the
following.  My wife has been teaching a Yiddish chorus at Temple Chai
(Reform) in Phoenix for the past year.  Now the young associate rabbi and
the cantor have asked her and her chorus to participate in next Friday
night's service (April 7).  Although there are no specific prayers
available in Yiddish for the Reform prayer book, we have chosen Yiddish
songs which, as much as possible, fit in with the prayers.  Inasmuch as
we have been given essentially carte blanche, we look upon this as an
opportunity to promote our Yiddish language.

As part of the service we will sing "Shabbes Yontef", "L'cho Doydi",
"Sabbath Prayer" (Yiddish version from Fiddler), and "Zog Nit Keyn Mol".
In lieu of a sermon, we will give a "program" following the service.
This will include a reading of that very special letter by Matt Dailey,
"Why Study Yiddish?", Yiddish readings by two members of the chorus, and
the following songs: "Tum Balalayke", "Lomir Zingen a Yiddish Lied", "By
Mir Bistu Sheyn", "Abi Gezunt", "Vu Iz Dos Gesele?", "Dayenu", "Tayere
Malke", and a Yiddish version (our translation) of "Let There Be Peace on
Earth". We also plan to have handouts of the program songs and the Matt
Dailey letter.

P.S.:  Many thanks to all who have helped me plan my travels to Europe.
Things (on the Eastern European side, at least) are now going swimmingly.

Subject: Soviet Yiddish writers

I am interested in recommendations for source material regarding the 21
Yiddish writers who were murdered in, I believe,  August 1952, by order of
Stalin.  I am trying to find historical information on the event itself, its
background and repercussions, and also would like to know if the literary
works of the victims has ever been collected, or in what form it might be
available.
