Subject: Golda Gross on Singer

I found Golda Gross' angry, literary loyalty and impassioned reverence for
Singer somewhat disarming, and yet, her view of Joseph Sherman's very
respectable and realistic review had me wondering if I had read the same
issue of TMR. 

Asking us for blind, unconditional love of Bashevis, she condemns Sherman's
review and reviewers as filled with 'disdain', 'contempt' and 'derision' and
asks that everyone back off, that we see no evil and sha, sha, speak no
evil. 

Bashevis, the masterful writer whom we love for his impassioned 'bearing
witness' and immortalizing our Jewsih/Yiddish cultural tradition, and then
triumphantly garnering a diamond tiara for Yiddish, was less than perfect as
a man. Why does looking at this make Ms.Gross confuse such analysis with
'demonizing' him? Negative personal reputation has no impact upon
intelligent, open-minded appreciation of art. And does not being less than
perfect (and part of a dysfunctional family) often trigger the art? The
wholesome seem to take to tennis or become astronauts.... 

Hadda, after all her analyzing him, has credited Singer with changing the
entire course of her life. This doesn't sound like a Singer-basher. Sherman
has given time and research to understanding Singer the man, and shares him
with anyone who will listen. Is this bashing? 

So Singer was penny-pinching; so he didn't pay his translators; so he didn't
pay his emotional debts to friedns and lovers. We still all hungrily drink
from his cup; we read and re-read Singer. We revere his masterful art. 

Perhaps, our appreciation is deeper, intensifies after seeing/accepting his
imperfections as a man.

Subject: Golda Gross on Singer 

I agree with Golda Gross's bottom line on Isaac Bashevis Singer -- just read
him. Ge-endikt. This posthumous bashing is eerily reminiscent of the abuse
hurled at the late R' Shlomo Carlebach. As though he were expected to issue
a response! 

Jews maligning the deceased masters eerily resembles an I.B. Singer plot. 
Pity he's not around to write it.

Subject: A suke

Funny, I was just asking Chana Mlotek about this lovely song last week, and,
coincidentally, she had just looked it up. It's based on a poem by Abraham
Reisen, In suke: 

A suke a kleyne
Fun breter gemeyne
    Hob ikh koym mit tsores gemakht!

Gedekt dem dakh
Mit a bisele skhakh
    Un ikh zits in ir sukes bay nakht.

Fun vint dem kaltn
Vos blozt durkh di shpaltn
    Mayn likhtele leshn zikh vil;

Dos makh ikh mir kidesh,
Un zet nor a khidesh:
    Dos likhtl brent ruik un shtil!

The song appears in several variants and other verses have been added
anonymously. I first heard it performed by the Rabbis' Sons, as recorded in
1967, very Simon and Garfunkel. So here are their additional stanzas: 

Tsum ershtn gerikht
Mit a blasn gezikht
    Brengt mir mayn tekhterl arayn:

Zi shtelt zikh avek
Un zogt mit shrek:
    Tatele, di suke falt bald ayn.

Zay nit keyn nar,
Hob nit keyn tsar,
    Zol dir di suke nit ton bang;

Es iz shoyn gor
Bald tsvey toyznt yor
    Un di suke zi shteyt nokh gants lang.

A slightly different version, with a different tune, appears in volume two
of the Anthology of Yiddish Folksongs published by Hebrew University.

Subject: A sikele (A sukele)

The song "a sikele" can be found on the cassette Yiddish Classics:  Heymishe
idishe gezang Volume I. A Suki and Ding production.  This beautiful and
haunting song has become part of my sikes repetoire as well.  This version
does not make it clear that the dialog is between a parent and daughter, but
I have heard versions that do. 

A sikele a klayne
fun bretelekh gemayne
hob ikh mir a sikele gemakht
badekt dem dakh
mit a bisele skhakh
zits ikh mir in sikele bay nakht

a vint a kaltn
bluzt durkh di shpaltn
un di likhtelekh zay leshn zikh fil
es iz mir a khidesh
vi ikh makh mir kidesh
un di likhtelekh zay brenen gantz shtil

zay nisht kayn nar
hob nit kayn tsar
zol dikh di sike nit zayn bang
es iz shoyn gur
bald tsvay toyznt yur
un di sikele zi shteyt nokh gants lang

ha rakhaman, hi yokim luni es sikes dovid ha noyfeles

Subject: a sukele

Jonathan Bellman on Mendele 09.030, asks about the song "A sukele." It was
recorded on a CD titled "Heymishe idishe gezangen" (Yiddish Classics) by
Suki & Ding. It can be ordered at 212-724-9351. There is also a song "A
suke"  which can be found on 2 tapes (or CDs), one titled "Gut Yom-Tev
Kinder" by the Workmans Circle Choir, available from the W.C. bookstore in
Manhattan.  Also recorded by Louis Danto on "Masterpieces of Jewish Art
Song." on the Cadenza label.

Subject: Query about "hilitse"

Ellen Cassidy (9.029) is puzzled by "hilitse". The word in question is
Slavic-origin _ulitse_ (palatalized "l", stress on the first syllable)
meaning 'street'. Its form signifies a) a Southern Yiddish area in which
etymological "u" is realized as "i" (cf. kimen, piter, git, etc.), and b)
and area of "h"-dropping--thus of the tendency to "restore" 
non-etymological "h". Taken together, these point to Yiddish in the Southern
(possibly Southwestern) Ukraine.

Subject: "kitke"

Mendel Katz (09.030) asks about "kitke".

The primary meaning of Yiddish _kitke_ is suggested by Polish _kitka_
'aigrette', 'ornamental plume'. Map 147 of Volume III of the _Language and
Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry_ (in press) depicts the geographic
variation in its occurrence and meaning. Responses to questions concerning
the word, where it is known, fall into 3 groups: 

 1. a _kitke_ is specified as a _khale_, or its meaning is a response to 
the question "Vos hot men gebakn af shabes" (implying that kitke = khale);
 2. a _kitke_ is specified as a "geflokhtene khale";
 3. a _kitke_ is a decoration on the _khale_, usually a braid or a strip 
of dough.

It should have been spelled: fey, yud, tes, shin  (space) nun, alef, samekh. 
The meaning: soaken wet.

Would somebody be kind enough to tell me the meaning of "lapatsan?" The word
appeared in an otherwise charming piece ("A Tsuzammenfli Fun Klasiker")  in
the September 24th FORWARD.
