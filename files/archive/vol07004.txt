Subject: Pronunciation reversals

Thanks to Arthur Abramson [7.003] (I mean, Arn ;) ) for being
'prodded'. But now I'm more intrigued. The Yiddish speaker I've heard
most in English (or in Yiddish, for that matter) was my father -- and
he definitely had a bilabial fricative for w/v, not a labiodental
fricative. I assumed that was normal, at least in his variety of
Yiddish (Central -- Carpato-Rus). But maybe it was his dentures... ;)

Loved the Wenvick Expressway story! Btw, I also pronounce it /vanwik/
not 'wike' -- but I left NY 30 years ago so what do I know.

Actually, it's interesting how we do manage to adjust to foreign
accents -- and of course I've got an anecdote about that too. ;) Once
when I was about 2 or 3, I was home alone with my father (he of the
Yiddish Accent; see above ;) ) and there was a terrible storm and I
got scared. He took me to the window and made me look at it and told
me how wonderful storms were, etc, and I stopped being afraid. Well, a
few days later I was home alone with my mother -- born in NY and proud
of it, no foreign accent in HER English -- and I asked her to tell me
about /tande/. She replied, 'Velkhe tante? Tante Malke? Tante Nekhe?
Tante Perl?' And I got impatient and said, 'No, the tande that makes
the flowers grow! The tande that Daddy told me about!' Es hot gornisht
geholfn. Finally I guess I said something like 'The lightening and the
tande in a storm! Tell me how they make the flowers grow!' ... I still
remember the look of utter horror that came over her face as she
shrieked in English, 'You mean THUNder!!!' And I still remember
cringing, both for myself and for my poor father... ;) Seriously, what
is interesting to me about that memory is how unique it was -- it was
the ONLY time I was ever 'duped' into accepting my father's English
pronunciation, and then probably only because that had been the first
time I'd ever heard the word. I bet little kids know right off the bat
who's native and who ain't and never take the non-native's version as
data if they've got a native's token that differs. Wouldn't you agree?
It boggles the mind how they manage, no matter how it works.

Subject: "Big"

A dank to Sam Weiss -- and an apology to the English Forward -- re
'big' as a singular noun in the headlines of three English newspapers
in NY and once in the National Lampoon.

But wouldn't it be funny if they were all the work of one
Yiddish-speaking headline writer...and his son at Harvard? [Just
kidding. Sort of. ;) ]

Subject: Nogid vs. poretz

For my first foray into Mendele I'll leave the linguistic differences
between nogid and poretz (vol. 6.301 Mendy Fleigler) to the experts.
But I just couldn't resist the opportunity to find out if anyone out
there ever used the word poretz (which I understood, even as a little
child meant someone _rich_) as we did in my family in Brooklyn.  When we
said the motzi at the beginning of a meal we ended with:......hamotzi
lekhem min ha'aretz....ess vi a poretz!  My parents were from Poland
(Warsaw and Rozan) and I don't know if that was a local Polish custom
or just a family thing but I have never met anyone who ever included
that line in the blessing.  Does it sound familiar to anyone?

Subject: More on a misguiding Romanization Guide

Further to my critique  (6.303,2) of Freydl Cielak's
personally-constructed Romanization Guide:

In her post (6.291,2) she advises:  When one needs the sound of alef,
as in "cat,"  add an /h/ after the letter /a/.

What for?  (Is it like a visit to the doctor:  "Open your mouth and
say 'Ah'?...)

She also offers two examples of her proposed /a + h/ spellings:
"mahyn" and "dahyn,"  supposedly for the simply and correctly spelled
'mayn,' 'dayn' [mine, yours].

This would certainly complicate matters, especially for the
beginners-level of her Briv-Fraynd Club, for whom her so-called Guide
was intended.

Not only are the added "shtume" (silent) /h's/ totally unnecessary, as
already pointed out in my post, but her students might even tend to
syllabicate these oddly spelled words and read them ma'hyn, da'hyn.

In the same post she wrote that she is not sure if her transcription
guide is the correct one "as I really do not know much about English
phonetics." Respectfully suggest that when it comes to romanize
Yiddish, one should mainly be concerned with the phonetics of Yiddish.

When one undertakes to fix something without a basic grounding in the
subject matter, one is liable to harm the very cause one professes to
love.

Mit a por vokhn tsurik hobn mir geleyent shmuesn vegn Sholem-Aleykhems

English translation:
A few weeks ago, we read a few posts about Sholem Aleichem's Stempenyu
and the English translations.  I was reminded that I once noted
certain differences between the first (1888) and second (1903)
versions.  Most likely, Sholem Aleichem himself made these revisions.
In 1903 he was 44, in good health, and very careful regarding the
appearance of his pieces.  A third edition appeared posthumously
(1918), a copy, almost word for word, of the second edition.

Two of these differences:
1. Wherever Khmelnitsk (a city) is found in the first version, it has
become Yehupets in the second.  The beautiful Rachel comes from
Khmelnitsk in the first version, but from Yehupets in the second.

2. Rachel's husband, Moyshe-Mendl, speaks of a grandfather
Menakhem-Mendl in the first version.  The same grandfather is
Moyshe-Mendl in the second.

Speculations:
1. Khmelnitsk is a name that could only have evoked disgust in Yiddish
readers.  Yehupets (Sholem Aleichem's nickname for Kiev) may evoke a
bit of a smile.  Perhaps he thought evocation of a smile is more
suited to the Sholem Aleichem style.

2. In 1888, the name, Menakhem-Mendl, did not sound so familiar to the
ears of readers of Yiddish.  By 1903, Menakhem-Mendl was a name that
had become firmly bound to a character well-known as a luftmentsh, a
muddled chaser after all kinds of enterprises fated to come to nought.
Probably Sholem Aleichem wanted to avoid having his readers think of
the luftmentsh.
