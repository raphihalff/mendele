to add to meylekh's feeings about saying sholem aleykhem etc in 
the bathroom, i have a personal anecdote. my mother, born in 
harlem in 1905, not 'religious' by her standards, and illiterate
in yiddish tho fluent, would scream when my father, born in a 
khasidic community in slovakia in 1899, read the yiddish 
newspaper ('der tog') in the bathroom, since the letters were 
hebrew and hence holy. he would call her an american ignoramus 
and go on reading...

>Why "mezuza" and "mezuzot" in L.P.'s posting to _Mendele_
>1:172?
>Is it not bowing to Hebraist hegemonism to privilege
>transcription from modern Hebrew?...
>Vaynraykh has "mezuzah"
>(pp. 203, 553); I prefer "mezuze" (i.e. the standard
>romanization), italicized. 

might i point out that, when the early speakers of yiddish
borrowed the term into yiddish in the first place, they
were 'bowing to hebraist hegemonism', as you put it? in
addition, it's not an item of *yiddish* culture, like
yortsayt lamps and gefilte fish, but of *jewish* culture
and is known to jews whether from columbus, lvov, istanbul,
or aleppo... i assume that is why weinreich wrote it the
way he did.

Subject: the movement of final vowels to long E

I have heard many Yiddish words spoken by American Jews
(not please "Jewish people") with the final vowel sound
degrading to a common long E. E.g.: "bobee" (grandmother),
"matzee" etc. I associate this pronunciation with the
Chicago area (we say "Chicagee" as a family joke). Am I
right about this? Elucidation from the professionals would
be appreciated.

Subject: The Yiddish Origins of Mendele Readers; Dissociation from Religion

     I limp in Yiddish and can barely follow many of the
learned threads on Mendele.  But one thing obvious to me is
that my ignorance in Yiddish does not take second place to
the ignorance of yiddishkeit (religion, if you will) of
many of Mendele's partners.

     It cannot have been all that long ago when all Yiddish
speakers were themselves experienced in the rituals and
routines of yiddishkeit as well as the language of prayer
and the synagogue or within a generation of that intimate
contact.  This is clearly no longer the case; with the
exception of a few readers (I can count two or three who
were clearly brought up religious and at least two ba'ale
tshuva on the list), most seem to be remote from what we
used to call yiddishkeit.  Otherwise certain phenomena
could never be explained.  (I have even come across a
mathematician now writing on Mendele who existed in
overlapping circles of my childhood, 40 years ago.)

     What phenomena?  The absence of anyone who knew that
klavte was an Aramaic word.  The definitions that come by,
such as "mussaf" (a fiction not substantially different
from the real example I fail to cite to avoid too simple
identification) being a prayer recited on Yom Kippur (true
but far from a satisfactory definition, except for someone
who has never been in shul except on Yom Kippur).

     I can testify that the Yiddish of the haredim whom I
know well is hardly literary, even when it appears to be
literate.  I imagine the Bund and Bund schools serve as in
important bridge for many of those now renewing their
interest in Yiddish.  Am I right?

     An interesting parallel here in Israel is the
translation of texts in the movies or on TV.  The
translators frequently fail to recognize that the text is
the King James version of a verse from Tanach (scripture),
usually from T'hilim (psalms) and translate into modern
Hebrew.
