Subject: mendelnikes at the LSA

At the risk of encouraging the feeling that Mendele is dominated by
Linguists, I thought people might be amused by the following:

The annual meeting of the Linguistic Society of America was in
Boston over the last few days, and a group of mendelnikes (9 of us,
if I remember correctly) took advantage of the opportunity to have
lunch together.  We enjoyed attaching faces to familiar names!

Undzer shames, Noyekh, was supposed to join us, but couldn't make it
because of the snow, alas.

Subject: Yehoshua Perle

Does anyone know where I can get hold of anything
written by Yehoshua Perle in Warsaw in the 20's and 30's?
For example:

Yidn fun a gants yor
Mirl - roman fun a poylisher salon-froy
Mayses fun der groys-shtot

The Widener library has them listed, but apparently
they have been stolen?!

Any suggestions would be welcome

Subject: Introduction

I am originally from the Chicago area and, being a second-generation
American, grew up with more 'Yinglish' than I had realized.

I am now 26 years old and studying for a doctorate in diplomatic
history at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  Before
starting at Illinois I lived in Japan for over a year, and sometime
during this exodus [:-)] felt the urge to return to my previous
levels of Jewish involvement.  This time, however, I want to learn
also about my Eastern European heritage. Unfortunately, none of my
family members can now speak more than phrases and words of yiddish,
and I'd like to learn more for myself, my wife (who is Japanese),
and eventually for my children.

Thank you in advance for your help and patience as I get in touch
with the roots of my mishpoche.

Michael (Misha) Auslin

Subject: children's rhymes

The recent discussion of children's literature reminded me of a
childhood ritual I grew up with - reciting the paragraph of Shema
from Genesis 67:16 where Jacob blesses Joseph's sons which ends as
follows:  ve-yidgu la-rov be-kerev ha-arets (and they will multiply
in the land).  We always added this ending:  shlof vi a porets (note
the rhyme with arets).  Is anyone else familiar with this or know of
other children's bedtime routines in Yiddish?
