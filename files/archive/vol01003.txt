Since Mendele is as much interested in literary as linguistic
aspects of Yiddish I thought it would be useful to open that
door as soon as possible.  I happen to have translated a chapter
from Jacob Pat's colorful 'Shmuessen mit Yiddishe Shrayber' (1954)
which tells of a meeting with J.I.Trunk, the celebrated author
of 'Poyln'.  The volume was printed privately and is not to my
knowledge copyrighted.

I'm no translator and don't pretend to be.  But this piece touches 
on so many central concerns that I thought you would overlook the
clumsy job.

More important, I hope it will encourage others who are more quali-
fied to do likewise.

I've put TRUNK.TXT in the archives.  A simple note to 
MENDELE@TRINCC.BITNET will get you a copy.
