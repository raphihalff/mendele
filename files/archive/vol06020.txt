Subject: Obituary notice for Joseph Green

My Fellow Mendelayners,

I regret to announce the death of Joseph Green, aged 96, who is
suggested to have been the creator of Yiddish film's heyday in a lengthy
and detailed obituary in the New York Times of Saturday, June 22 (west
coast edition, page 10).  It reads, in part,

      Joseph Green, who turned a walkon on role in the first talking
      movie, 'The Jazz Singer,' into a film making career that ushered
      in the golden age of Yiddish cinema, died on Thursday at the Grace
      Plaza nursing home in Great Neck, L.I. He was 96 and had
      emphysema.

      Working at a feverish pace under the shadow of Nazism, Mr. Green
      in three years in Poland was the producer and co- director of four
      features ['Yidl Mitn Fidl' (1935), 'Der Purimspiler' (1937),
      'Mamele' (1938) and 'A Brievele Der Mamen' (also 1938)] that
      carried Yiddish film to popular and artistic heights on both sides
      of the Atlantic.  They survive as a celluloid testament to life in
      the shtetl on the eve of the Holocaust."

This is a substantial obituary and I am hesitant at quoting anything
larger than the above from a copyrighted publication.  But I will
paraphrase some more of the obit.

Mr. Green's contributions to the Yiddish film industry are cited with
special reference to the "purity of the Yiddish and the quality of the
acting."  Apparently he was also involved in the selection (and maybe
even the composition) of the music that accompanied his films since it
is said to have evolved into folk music.

His film, "Yidl" was said to have been shown in Berlin in 1938 to Jewish
audiences and is currently available on video cassette.

In 1927, he travelled to Hollywood with both Joseph and Rudolph
Schildkraut and got a small part in "The Jazz Singer," the Al Jolson
film of talkies fame.  The experience left him wanting to do more and in
1932 he was hired to dub the Yiddish dialogue into a silent Italian
movie, "Joseph in the Land of Egypt."  It was a big hit in Poland and he
made enough money to finance his own film career.

The story of how he took the script, "The Wandering Musicians" and
converted it to a piece with Molly Picon is given in Mr. Green's words.
The film was said to have been so successful that it recouped all of its
production costs on its run in Warsaw alone.  It was booked into movie
houses in Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Manhattan. The Loew's chain picked it
up as its first Yiddish talkie.

Interestingly, he is said to have passed up a chance to make a film
about Sholem Aleichem's Tevye, fearing that it was too anti- clerical
for Roman Catholic Poland.  He was proven wrong when Maurice Schwartz
made the film in 1939 and it became a hit.

Subject: Verbs without -t

Peter Kluehs asks [6.019] about verbs, such as 'toyg' which lack the -t
ending in the third person singular of the present tense.  There are a
number of such verbs:

          er ken
          er iz
          er meg
          er muz
          er darf
          er fleg

and probably a few others I haven't thought of.  However, all of these
are auxiliary verbs.  'Toyg' and 'geher' are not auxiliaries, and I was
not able to think of any other non-auxiliary verbs which do not take -t.

A gut vokh,
Arnie Kuzmack

Subject: Which part of Yiddish is dying?

Bob Hirshan (6.018) suggests that the real question should be: "Which
part of Yiddish is dying?" He divides "Yiddish" into three aspects. A.
The Yiddish of academia. B. The spoken hasidic Yiddish. C. The feeling
of nostalgia for the Yiddish word and the connection to the culture of
the shtetl. And he concludes that: "Only the Yiddish of nostalgia will
disappear in future generations."

The suggestion above has several problems. First the majority of the
Yiddish speaking Jews of the last two generations are excluded, namely
all the non-hasidic, Yiddish speaking Jews. This group includes the
Zionists and non Zionists, the mitnagdim, the communists and more who spoke
Yiddish as the vernacular, and whose grandchildren today do not know the
language. The conclusion is therefore a wishful thinking.

The reality is, IMHO, that most of the parents or grandparents of the
current ashkenazic Jews used Yiddish as the primary or secondary
vernacular, whereas 2-3 generations later Yiddish is not used as a
vernacular. This does not negate the statement that some aspects of
Yiddish are used, like cute expressions, funny words etc. - but not as a
vernacular, or that the hasidic Jews are using the language and
probably will continue to do so. We can divide the uses of Yiddish into
categories, classify it into sections or group it into segments. It is
nonetheless undeniable that less ashkenazic people, as a percentage of
the total Jewish population, use the Yiddish as a vernacular. This is of
course regrettable and shameful - but it is. The question to ask is
therefore different. I have ignored the academic Yiddish; it is
irrelevant to the discussion in the same sense that the ancient Greek
scholarship did not revive ancient Greek. Will the hasidic Yiddish be
able to sustain the language, once all the rest disappears? Or, is there
a chance of revival among other groups?
