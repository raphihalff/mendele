Subject: Toyvye

The name is Toyvye and Tevye and it all depends on pronunciation. It is
spelled with a choylem and a choylem is pronounced cheylem by litvishe,
choylem by poles and choalem (as in boat) by Anglo Saxons.

Subject: Concentration camp song

My father who is an Auchwitz survivor told me about a song that was sung
in the concentration camp. He thinks the song was called Papirene Kinder
(a reference to the murdered children with nothing left of them but a few
photos).

Two lines he remembers are:

Papirene kinder hengen oif di vent
Papirene kinder tap ich mit di hent

Does anyone know all the words? and maybe even the tune?

Subject: _Brengen_ in argumentation/verbal aggression

In Zellig Bach's informative posting on children's verbal aggression
(5.049), he uses the verb "bring" where I would have expected "give",
"present", or "cite":  "Some of the verbal-aggression samples I bring
below I remember from my childhood..."  This is an interesting use of the
word that is sometimes encountered in discussions/disputations about
Jewish religious belief or practice when an authority or source is cited.
E.g., "In support of his position, So-and-so brings the Rambam's
statement that ...".  I have the feeling that the locution comes from
Yiddish.  Can someone [Eliyahu Juni?] confirm (or refute) the idea that
_brengen_ was/is customarily used this way in Yiddish discussions about
Torah and Talmud?

In a recent conversation, I mentioned to Zellig that as a child of 6 or
7, I was often called "Salami" by my friends; they knew that my name was
Shleyme, and I always assumed that this was simply an innocent play on
the similarity of the words.  But when in response to an insightful
question, I told Zellig I was a fat child, he suggested that my playmates
might well have been referring to my being "stuffed" like a _vursht_
--another example of verbal aggression with names.  Rotten kids.

Subject: Rabeynu Tam

Yori Yanover asks for the words to the very funny poem Rabeynu Tam by
Itzik Manger.  The poem was put to music and appears in one of the two
Workman's Circle songbooks by the Mloteks.  It also is sung by Chava
Albershteyn in one of her early Yiddish tapes.  Sorry I don't have the
specifics available.

I don't vouch for the accuracy of what follows (from memory):

Lomir zingen dos naye lid

Subject: Rabeynu Tam

In response to the recent inquiry by Yori Yanover about the song Rabbi
Tam, my father also used to sing that song to me when I was a child.  I
did not know the song's name at the time; I knew it only as a childhood
lullaby with a catchy chorus of "Idle deedle idle dum, idle deedle
dum...."  When I became interested in Jewish music later as an adult, I
had always hoped to stumble upon the song, but didn't for quite a long
time, until I found it on a 1992 Chava Alberstein CD entitled "The Best
of Yiddish Songs." The disc does not contain the lyrics, and I cannot
recite them, but if it will help, let me mention that the CD is
distributed by Atoll Music, 18/20 rue du Borrego - 75020 Paris, telephone
43 66 69 22.  On the CD, the song is credited to "I. Manger/Hertzrubin."
The arrangement of the song on the CD is credited to Menachem Wiesenberg.
Good luck in your quest.

Yori:  See either "Lomir Kinder Zingen" [Kinderbuch Publications, NYC
(1985)], p. 212; or "Mir Trogn A Gezang" [Workmen's Circle, NYC (1972)],
p. 170 for full words and music. I'm fairly sure both of these are still
in print.  If you can't find either one, send me your snail-mail address.
