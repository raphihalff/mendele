The idea that syntactic structure should reflect "logic" is
culturally conditioned. English disallows double negatives,
so we say it's a "logical" language. Standard Russian
requires double negatives: "ja nichego ne znaju" [lit: 'I
don't know nothing'], but no native speaker woul construe
this to mean 'I do know something'.

Fayvel:   Do you know the town your Suvaler bobi(!) was
from? It sounds to me as if it's an extension of the Womzi
(Lomza) Grajvi (Grajewo)  area. Mikhl.

on harold bershady's question about yiddish negation:

yiddish has what is called 'negative concord'--if the
proposition conveyed is negative, all non-specific
expressions in the proposition have to be negated. this is
not unusual in european lgs, as has been pointed out. it
works somewhat differently in each language family,
however, and differently from language to language within a
family. closest to home, black english has negative
concord, of which perhaps the most famous/impressive
example (from labov) is:

it ain't no cat can't get in no coop 

which means: 

no cat can get in a coop, or: there's no cat that can get
in a coop.

(black english, like yiddish and just about every other
germanic language, uses 'it' for 'there'.)

closest to yiddish, bavarian german (which shares a zillion
other features with yiddish) has negative concord.

as for 'two negatives make a positive', this is a fact of
(standard, two-valued) logic, NOT a fact of language. it
was applied to english around the seventeenth century, i
think, by some 'grammarian' who was trying to stamp out
negative concord in english (chaucer had no problem with
it, of course).

one last note--dave sherman (and many grammar books) say
that 'keyn' is required when 'an indefinite article is
called for'. close, but not quite. what matters is whether
the noun phrase refers to a specific or nonspecific entity.
for example, in english:

john wants to marry a norwegian

is ambiguous. it may be that john has a specific woman in
mind and i happen to refer to her as 'a norwegian'. in this
case, i could continue with:

but she doesn't want to marry him.

in the other, nonspecific, sense, any norwegian will
do--all john wants is to marry someone/anyone with the
property of being a norwegian. in this sense, i couldn't
continue with 'but she doesn't want to marry him'. however,
i could continue with:

but he'll never find one.

now, if we make the sentence negative, there are still two
readings:

john doesn't want to marry a norwegian--and she doesn't
want to marry him. john doesn't want to marry a norwegian,
which is good since he'll never find any.

ok, so now to yiddish. so far as i know, the
first--specific--sense would not have keyn, whereas the
second--nonspecific--sense would (for most speakers):

yankl vil nit khasene hobn mit a norveger--un zi vil nit
khasene hobn mit im. yankl vil nit khasene hobn mit keyn
norveger, vos iz gut vayl er vet keyn norveger keynmol nit
trefn.

is that ok, you yiddish speakers? 

the crucial one is this--is it bad (as this account
predicts)?:

*yankl vil nit khasene hobn mit keyn norveger--un zi vil
nit khasene hobn mit im.

(note, by the way, that 'khasene' doesn't get a 'keyn'--so
far as i know,

yankl vil nit keyn khasene hobn mit...

would have the literal rather than idiomatic sense--john
doesn't want to have a(ny) wedding with... if this is true,
then 'khasene' in the idiom khasene hobn 'get married'
isn't even nonspecific--it doesn't refer in ANY way. it's
just part of a complex predicate, like 'the bucket' in kick
the bucket 'die'.)

more than you ever wanted to know about negative concord...
