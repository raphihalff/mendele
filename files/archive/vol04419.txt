Subject: Introduction

I've received and enjoyed Mendele for several weeks now and thought it
was time to introduce myself to other subscribers. As a New York City
high school history teacher, I got tired of teaching about others and
decided that I wanted to learn more about my own personal and family
history and culture, and so got involved in Jewish genealogy.  That in
turn has gotten me very interested in Eastern European history and
Yiddish language and culture.

My grandfather lived with us during my childhood and so I heard a great
deal of Yiddish.  I can understand it reasonably well but, alas, never
learned to speak it.  We always took the easy way out -- we listened to
the Yiddish and replied in English.  I also spent many summers in Sharon
Springs, NY, a spa that was very popular with our immigrant ancestors who
brought the habit of visiting spas with them from Europe.  I hung around
my grandfather's butcher shop there, where most conversations were in
Yiddish.  I guess that helped some.

I have traced my roots back to Lithuania and the Ukraine and my current
family to all over the U.S., Canada, Israel, Australia, and South Africa.
I'm currently working on going backwards and to that end, am planning a
trip to Lithuania this summer.  I know that I will not find much of
Jewish Lita but hope to get some feel for what it must have been like.  I
would love to hear from Litvaks or those who have visited or have advice.

Subject: Ver'z ver

In Mendele Bulletin 4.411,6 our rosh khavruse Noyekh Miller wrote:

  A New Who-is-Who on File: Anno  Siegel, a lebn af im, has compiled a
  new  version  of introductions by our members.  The file is available
  via anonymous ftp.

A very worthwhile and laudable endeavor.

In his initial announcement about this plan, Anno wrote (4.290,3):  "So
if you have not yet sent in your introduction in Mendele and want to be
in my Who's Who (_I like ver iz der doziker_), please do it now."

I believe that in Yiddish the expression "ver iz der doziker" is in this
case not well chosen because this structure calls for a negative, for a
critical remark of belittlement or ridicule.  It is a challenging
question, not confrontational (because always in the absence of the
criticized), for example:  Ver iz der doziker "kho'khem"? (who constantly
opines on matters he doesn't comprehend)... der doziker "eytsegeber"?
(who keeps offering unsolicited, impractical advice)... der doziker
"millionaire"? (who criticizes other peoples' donations as
insufficient)... etc., etc.  Note that the quotation-marks of the nouns
in the examples tend to turn them into  their  opposites  I am certain
that this was not Anno's intention.

Simply "ver iz ver" is fine (or, like _Who's Who_,  "ver'z ver.")

Subject: Does German mies come from Yiddish?

The word "mies" entered the German language from Yiddish via Rotwelsch
during the 19th century.  The dictionary goes on to explain that mis
goes back to Aram "meis" (disgusting) which is a verb form (part. pass.)
of "meas" (loathe).

"Mies" is universally used in German (not sure about Swiss), but is
clearly colloquial.  It seems to have spread from Berlin's brokers
jargon.

So Yiddish mies _is_ from Hebrew, not German!

A dank Mikhl Herzog! Gepasknt a shayle (4.414, 5; May 9, '95) eyder me

Subject: Genendel

Elliot Lasson asks about the origin of the Yiddish name, Genedel.

I offer the opinion that it is a variant of the name "Hanah" whose
Yiddish affection form causes it to become Hene or Hendel.  In diminution
it would by Hendele.  Since the Russian alphabet has no "h" it was
replaced with a "g" and thus Russian Jews Hendel became Gendel.

Interestingly, I found almost 100 women with 10 different spellings of
this name in the 1784 census of the Jews of Alsace.  It included
Genentel, Genendel, Gennenndal, etc.

I think it all to be Hannah.
