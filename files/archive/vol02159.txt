1. Some of you have already noticed that there's been a
slightly different look to things in the last few numbers
of Mendele. That's because we've changed machines.  Mendele
is no longer serviced by Trinity's Vax and uses instead a
machine with a different operating system (Unix).  There
may yet be another change in a few weeks, but at this time
the shames makes this request of you:

Please do NOT write to: nmiller@vax1.trincoll.edu
                                or
                        mendele@vax1.trincoll.edu

Instead, address all personal mail to:

                        nmiller@dot.trincoll.edu
                                
Communications to Mendele still go to:

                        mendele@yalevm.ycc.yale.edu

2. Some of you who have tried to download back files by
means of anonymous ftp may have had trouble exiting by use
of the "bye" command.  A note from Harold Orbach points out
that "quit" works just fine.

A sheynem dank aykh.

Subject: Ye  'yes'

Everyone knows the Yiddish word for 'yes' is /yo/ (I guess
in Polish, Galitsyaner, and Ukranian dialects /yu/?).  But
my grandmother, from a town a few miles west of Minsk well
inside Litvish territory, said /ye/ to rhyme with /fe/
'yuck' and /ikh ze/ 'I see', and insisted that this was not
the English word "yeah" but genuine Yiddish.  Of course she
knew /yo/, but said that's not the way it was pronounced in
her dialect.  What's puzzling is that there is no regular
sound change from /o/ to /e/ in Yiddish and she said /do/
'here', /sho/ 'hour'.  (/kop/-/kep/, /nomen/-/nemen/ and
/helfn/- /geholfn/ are different phenomena: they're
morphological alternations that carry contrasts of
meaning).

I haven't heard of anyone else saying /ye/.  Is this a
well-known variant? Where does it occur?  Does anyone
(Mikhl?) have an explanation for its history?

Subject: Mutual comprehensibility

Were all Yiddish dialects mutually comprehensible?  A
linguist friend has asked me this, knowing perfectly well
that it is an undefined question, because two aspects are
left open: how comprehensible is comprehensible, and when
and where are we asking about.

For comprehensibility: do we require instant ease of
conversation, or is a period of accommodation acceptible;
how frequent do we tolerate misunderstandings?  Obviously
one can LEARN to understand a different dialect, just as
one can learn a foreign language.  As for when and were:
clearly someone who had never left his/her village has much
less experience with different dialects than someone living
for some years in the Lower East Side of New York.

So let's define it arbitrarily and hypothetically as
follows: is it the case that any two Yiddish speakers who
had never left their villages in anywhere in eastern Europe
(let's exclude Western Yiddish from consideration) and
rarely or never talked with people from elsewhere could, if
brought suddenly together, have conducted an extended
conversation including more than a simple exchange of basic
factual information?  We'll allow a bit of difficulty for
the first few minutes, and an occasional minor misunder-
standing that would be easily clarified.  Anybody want to
hazard a thought on this question?  Guesses, estimates, and
anecdotes welcome.
