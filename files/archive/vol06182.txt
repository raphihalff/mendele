While we are listing the deficiencies of the Weinreich dictionary.

Weinreich doesn't have the word shvants (tail and ???) either. Once I
tried to find the correct spelling of some word in the famous maxim "mer
macht nisht a shtreimel fun a shvantz of a khazer" and was surprised to
find no such word in Weinreich.  What a shvants!

The "deficiencies" of the Weinreich dictionary were well known to Prof.
Uriel Weinreich himself, and are discussed in the Yiddish preface,
though unfortunately for those who may most need the dictionary, not in
the English preface. Permit me to give the author a chance to speak for
himself in his translated words:

      The bottom line is that the recomendations of the dictionary,
      whether explicit or implicit, are based on the author's taste. He
      has no authority to legitimatize or delegitimatize words in the
      name of any public; but he can nonetheless not evade the
      responsibility to make recommendations. No one is under the
      illusion that everything recommended here will be enthusiastically
      accepted by all those who use Yiddish. One may however hope that
      everyone - even the most experienced stylist -- no matter how
      accustomed to depend on his memory and his own creativity -- will
      find pleasure in at least one thing the dictionary offers:
      excellent words saved from oblivion, Let everyone take what the
      dictionary offers him; let him improve on it if he can. The author
      gives his thanks in advance for ideas that will improve the
      dictionary in its future editions.

      The dangers of omitting the indispensable, of inadequate
      definition, of rejecting what is good or accepting the unsuitable
      lurk at every step for the compiler of a dictionary. The
      dictionary _must_ be reworked, must be reissued again and again in
      improved versions; there can be doubt of that. In these further
      versions illustrations of usage must be made ever more accurate.
      Moreover usage will continue to change -- perhaps even improve as
      a result of this dictionary: in some cases, the recommendations
      here will be accepted generally; in others, the reaction will be
      to create better alternatives. A living standard language must
      frequently be "lexicographicized", taking lessons from the image
      it sees in the mrror which lexicography holds up to it.

The thread about the problems of the Weinreich dictionary is certainly
useful, and one subscriber, while coming down hard on Weinreich, did
allow for some merits in his dictionary.  Granted that Weinreich's
prudery is rather funny and that a number of his neologisms haven't
quite made it on the international loop.  But both for reading and for
translating, I find his dictionary indispensable (along, of course, with
Harkavy, the Groyser Verterbukh, etc.)

W.'s chief advantage is that his Yiddish-English portion is fairly
descriptive, his English-Yiddish half quite prescriptive.  This is
especially important in regard to genders, which sometimes vary between
the two sections.  Max Weinreich's History describes the way Yiddish
advocates in interwar Vilna took in the missing neuter, thereby
thoroughly changing their gender system.  The Uriel Weinreich Dictionary
is to some degree a document of that evolution. Harkavy also includes
genders, but since the two books do not always overlap, I need them both
desperately (except for the letter aleph perhaps).

One huge merit of the Weinrich dictionary is the pronunciation of
Hebrew-Aramaic borrowings.  Aside from movies and radio programs and
conversations with native speakers (all rare), there is no way a
foreigner can know that the word that is spelled "kheshbon" is
pronounced "khezhbm".  Both Harkavy and Yehoyesh's lexicon of
Hebrew-Aramaic items in Yiddish offer pointed spellings but few pointers
on how to pronounce them in Yiddish--and Shteynberg's "Psukim un
Taytshn", wonderful as it is, doesn't even point its items.

Moreover, despite the smaller size of the W. dictionary, it does include
items that I haven't been able to find elsewhere.

On its downside, along with the other problems listed earlier, it
sometimes includes imprecise equivalents--such as "antologye" =
"anthology". Actually, an "antologye" can refer to any collection
including one of texts by a single author, while an "anthology" normally
refers to a collection of works by _different_ writers.  The latter
concept is covered by a less frequent Yiddish noun:  "khrestomatye",
which is more bookish than "antologye" or "anthology."

Given the conditions under which Yiddish lexicons are produced, we have
to be both tolerant and cautious--as we should be with any dictionary.
I've sometimes had problems even with the OED, which doesn't include,
say, an expression ("What's the fun of it") that I found in "The Mill on
the Floss."  And Grimms Deutsches Woerterbuch, two centuries in the
making and running to dozens and dozens of fat volumes, is fabulous but
excrutiatingly political--each volume reflecting shifts of highly
politicized attitudes toward German, especially loanwords.

As for the quality of Weinreich's College Yiddish, I dont see anything
wrong with it.  It was my thorough introduction to Yiddish, and I've
never found any reason to regret it.  I've noticed changes from one
edition to the next:  I believe that he eventually replaced "kvUtse"
with "kibbUts"--so he can't have been totally hidebound.  Many people
use Yiddish as a tool--but he and his father used it as an instrument.

Joachim Neugroschel

P.S.  I dont want to get involved in the Hundred Years War about
standardized spelling or borrowing from modern German or neologisms.  My
draft status is: conscientious objector.

I'm grateful to A. Joseph Ross for bringing his problem of finding
"tokhes" in Weinreich to this forum [6.180].  I, too, have looked there
in vain because I've had a couple of occasions to need to know if my
perception that "tekheser" is the plural of "tokhes" is indeed correct.
It sounds sort of right but I'm eager to know the exact correct plural.
As a child, during periods of boredom, I'd sometimes complain to my
mother that I couldn't find anything to do.  Her advice would be, "Patch
zikh in tokhes un shray 'bravo!' "  I often wonder if that was an
expression peculiar to my immediate family or rather more widespread.
Again, I thank A.J. Ross for emboldening me to bring this momentous
topic to this list.
