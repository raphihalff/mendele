Call for Papers

The Yiddish Program of The Ohio State University in association with the
YIVO Institute for Jewish Research announces

YIDDISH AND ASHKENAZIC STUDIES: THE NEXT WAVE

A Conference for Graduate Students and Recent Recipients of the Ph.D.

2-3 April 1995

on the campus of The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio

Objective: Our aim is to create an open collegial forum for the
discussion of recent directions and trends in the various disciplines
(literature, linguistics, history, folklore, etc.) which collectively
comprise the emerging interdiscipline of Ashkenazic studies.

Participation: Papers limited to a twenty-minute presentation will be
given by graduate (M.A., M.L.S., Ph.D.) students or by scholars who were
awarded their Ph.D. not earlier than 1990.  No senior scholars will
deliver papers. Participants from outside Ohio and its bordering states
will be provided, funds permitting, with a stipend of $200 each toward
conference expenses and will be encouraged to seek additional funds from
their home institutions.

Submission: Eligible individuals who would like to participate are
invited to submit anonymous abstracts of a single double-spaced page,
enclosing a card with name, title of abstract, institutional affiliation,
and current stage of study or year of doctoral degree. Topics and
approaches may deal with Yiddish or general Ashkenazic studies from the
perspective of one or more disciplines among the human or social sciences
and the arts, and may represent current or recent research interests.
Preference will be given to abstracts that promise research within an
advanced, rigorous, and explicit model of analysis.

Program Committee: Abstracts will be evaluated by a committee consisting
of the following Ohio State professors: Michael Berkowitz (history),
Joseph Galron (library science), Neil G. Jacobs (linguistics), Dagmar C.
G. Lorenz (literature and Holocaust studies), David Neal Miller
(literature), and Amy Shuman (folklore). The program will also be
reviewed by members of the Research Committee of the YIVO.

Address: Send abstracts to either of the conference coordinators, David
Neal Miller or Neil G. Jacobs, at the Department of Near Eastern, Judaic,
and Hellenic Languages and Literatures, The Ohio State University, 256
Cunz Hall, 1841 Millikin Road, Columbus, OH 43210 (USA). Abstracts and
correspondence are also welcome by e-mail to miller.3@osu.edu. Telephone:
(614) 292-7140 or 292-4267. Fax: (614) 292-1262.

Deadline: 15 January 1995

Subject: Perl Krupit's mayse in der bay

Haynt hob ikh bakumen dem nayestn numer "der bay" un hob geleyent Perl

Those who don't yet subscribe to Fishl Kutner's der bay are missing out
on a worthwhile item.  It supplements Mendele (or vice versa) to good
effect.

Perl Krupit writes Yiddish so well and her Romanization follows the
easily understood YIVO method.  It's a pleasure to see Yiddish so clearly
expressed in our everyday characters, though second best to Hebrew
characters.

Subject: Yiddish, kids and the meaning of "kvel"

Sounds wonderful.  So when is the tour coming to Toronto? Our kids are
looking forward to it.  :-)

> This is an opportunity to teach the kids in the most direct way the meaning
> of the word _kvel_.

Actually, the real meaning of _kvel_ was defined for me in July 1993,
when we went to the National Yiddish Book Center's week-long Yiddish
program.  (An excellent course, by the way -- very different from
Yugntruf's yidish-vokh, as it was primarily an educational lecture
program and secondarily a vacation.  But I digress.)

At the introductory evening, with about 150 people in the auditorium
(most of them middle-aged Americans who had once known Yiddish but no
longer used it much), Mendy Cahan of the NYBC's Israel office went on
stage to sing some Yiddish songs.  (For those who don't know Mendy, he's
in his late 20's and comes across great on stage, something like a
Yiddish Elvis.)  So the audience, many of whom hadn't heard any Yiddish
songs recently, was all primed to kvel.  Mendy began singing
Tum-Balalaika, always a great song for such audiences.  We had our
daughter Shoshana with us; she was seven at the time and suitably
adorable.  (The other kids didn't come to that evening's session.)
During the first verse she started singing along with the refrain, so we
encouraged her to go down to Mendy on stage and join him for the refrain.
She got on stage as he was singing the second verse ("Meydl, meydl,
kh'vel bay dir fregn..."), so of course he sang it to her (and the
audience lapped it up).

What I _didn't_ know is that Shoshana knew all the words to the verses.
So after the second refrain, she sang the third verse back to Mendy
("Narishe bokhr, vos darfstu fregn..."), in perfect Yiddish.  The crowd,
as they say, went wild.

*That* defined the meaning of _kvel_ for me.  Boy did I kvel. I still
smile whenever I remember it.

Subject: Afn, afen

Hey, I'm no expert nor do I even have a set of dictionaries by my side,
but is there any chance that afen or afn could be an acorn?  Just a
guess.
