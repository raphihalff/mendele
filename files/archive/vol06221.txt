Benjamin Gebiner, a prominent member of the Yiddish cultural and
political sector of the Jewish community, a veteran educator, writer,
organizational leader and friend to many, passed away just after noon,
Friday, February 7th, at the age of 98.  A funeral will be taking place
at the Riverside Funeral Home this Sunday, Feb. 9th, at 12:30 p.m.

A number of people reading this might have learned Yiddish from him, or
have relatives or ancestors who did.

Bearing in mind this extraordinary individual's life, I am sending out
this brief biographical note.

Mr. Gebiner was born in Rovno, in the Ukraine, on June 25, 1898.  He
became politically active in Zionist circles in his student years in
Odessa and Kiev, and, after his student days, in the Tzeirei Zion
movement in Rovno and Warsaw. He was conscripted and served in the
Czarist army in Russia.  Soon after the October 1917 revolution, feeling
endangered because of his political activism, he fled Russia to Poland
[Warsaw] in 1919. The next year, he married Sonia Goldfarb.  In 1922, he
and his wife emigrated to the United States.  Soon after his arrival, he
"sat in" at a public school in New York to pick up English; soon
thereafter, he studied journalism at Columbia University, as well as law
at Brooklyn College, from which he received a law degree in 1929.

Mr. Gebiner became an educator in the Yiddish-language school system of
the Workmen's Circle, teaching from 1924 to 1934.  At that time, he
became involved in the formation of the Jewish Labor Committee, founded
in 1934 in New York by Jewish labor leaders to oppose the rise of Nazism
in Germany.  He was the JLC's first Executive Secretary, serving from
its founding until 1936. That year, he became General Secretary of the
Jewish Socialist Verband, an American socialist organization whose
politics were similar to that of the Jewish Labor Bund in Poland, Russia
and Lithuania.  Mr. Gebiner was an editor of the Yiddish publication
"Der Vecker," the major organ of the Verband.  He also was a writer: for
many decades, his work appeared in the pages of the Yiddish daily, the
Forward, and he had a radio program in Yiddish on the station WEVD
[named after the American socialist leader Eugene Victor Debs].

Mr. Gebiner held many positions within the Workmen's Circle, from
Educational Director to General Secretary.

In his 70s, Mr. Gebiner returned to teaching, and he taught Yiddish
language at Queens College in New York City to new generations of
students.

He always maintained his close connections to the Yiddish-rooted Jewish
labor movement, and until his last months, remained an active leader in
the Workmen's Circle.

His wife passed away a number of years ago.  He is survived by two
daughters, and a good number of grandchildren and great-grand-children.

message to the family, I would be glad to act as an intermediary.  Just

Subject: "A keselgarten!"/Castle Garden

Catching up on several weeks' worth of Mendele, I noticed (V. 6.208)
reference to the subject and immigrants' pronounciation as _kestl garden_.
Not quite.  Convinced that much of the immigration process was dominated by
those who preceded them, the Yiddish-speaking immigrant flood at the turn of
the century quite naturally and simply concluded that New York's reception
center was named _kestl gartl_: a belted box or a belt for a box. Makes
sense: immigrants were detained (boxed-in and "belted") there.

Sholem Aleichem's Motl, Peyse the Cantor's son, explains in the very first
lines of his adventures in America:

"We're due _mazltov_--we're finally in America. That is, they say we're in
America. We haven't seen America yet because we're still in _kestl gartl_.
That is, that's what it was once called. Now it's not called _kestl gartl_
anymore, but 'Ellis Island.'"

(Motl goes on to explain that Ellis Island was named after someone called
_elye_--Eli--, which is also his elder brother's name. He describes the
family's stay there as being--the title of Chapter 3--"In Prison", _in
gefengenish_.

Subject: Beyts and blegitch

A friend hailing from Scotland has asked me to find out the origin of
words he says are known exlusively in Scotland and the north of
England:1. Beyts (male), Beytske (feminine), Beytsemer (plural)  meaning
rude, vulgar, uncultured, and  2. Blegitch meaning mischievous, but not
bad. Would any one know the answer?  Thanks in advance.
