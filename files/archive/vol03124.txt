Subject: Birobidszhaner Shtern

It was wonderful to read the article from the Birobidzshaner Shtern.
I used to look at it in the early 1970's in the University of
Chicago library.  In those days they occasionally had an obituary of
someone identified as having been a Yiddish writer, but other than
that, if you had translated the whole newspaper into Russian, you
wouldn't have been able to tell it was supposed to be a Jewish
newspaper.  It's gratifying to know that interest there in Yiddish
and Jewish culture were merely submerged, not dead, and that it has
re-emerged.

Subject: Ashkenazic holem

Steven Jacobson's question -- why does American Hebrew School
Ashkenazic pronounce the Hebrew vowel kholem (vav with a dot on top,
or just a dot) as [ow] (as in English "ROW your boat"), when Yiddish
has [oy] or [ey] -- is very interesting, and I suspect Michael
Shimshoni is on the right track in mentioning the German-Jewish
pronunciation.  In fact, German-Jewish [aw] (as in German Haus,
English house) is a relatively recent, modernizing feature.  A more
traditional German-Jewish pronunciation of holem is [ow], almost
exactly as in AHSA.  I have heard this pronunciation, along with
some other features that differ from the most stereotypically German
Hebrew pronunctiation, in Jackson Heights, Queens.  Since [ow]
doesn't exist in German itself, [aw] represents a bit of
assimilation to the phonetics of the German language.  I suspect the
American Hebrew school educational system, and AHSA pronunciation,
had their roots in the German Jewish immigration to the US in the
19th century, before the mass of Eastern European immigrants came.
If that's true, then in the early 20th century there might have
existed side-by-side "high class" Hebrew schools with AHSA and a
newer type based on Eastern European kheyders, which probably used
Yiddish as the medium of communication and Eastern European styles
of pronouncing Hebrew.  Nowadays the latter survives only in what
are known as "right-wing Orthodox" yeshivas, AHSA mostly in "Modern
Orthodox" schools and shuls, while Conservative and Reform
institutions mostly use American Hebrew School Sephardic
pronunciation.  Does anyone know whether this guess about the
history is valid?

Subject: Introduction

My name is David Connor, a Gentile, and translator since 1971.  I
work full-time as a translator of Eurropean languages and
translations coordinator for Telecom Australia.  As a hobby I delve
into minor languages such as Icelandic, Armenian and Yiddish.  I
decided to join this list to become more informed about the current
situation relating to Yiddish.  I'm a bit of a collector.  Apart
from American Yiddish textbooks, I've subscribed for years to
Sovietish Heimland and have collected all the Teach Yourself Yiddish
booklets (and serialized lessons by Semen Sandler).  I dropped the
subscription to it when the rates shot up after the collapse of the
Soviet empire.  I'll follow the info on this list with interest.
The sort of thing I'd like to learn about is what is happening with
Yiddish in Birobidzhan. Do we have any e-mailers there?

Regards,

David Connor.
