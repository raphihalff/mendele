Subject: More tekheser

I am surprised to read Michael Shimshony`s entry. He seems to have a
special censored edition of Even-Shoshan`s _Hamilon hekhadash_. My
edition and all other Hebrew and Yiddish dictionaries (except Weinreich)
have "tokhes" or "tukhes". Even-Shoshan brings even both variants of the
Swabian greeting (related to Goethe, in his "Goetz von Berlichingen"):
"shak li baTakhat" and the finer implied "yi-shakeni" whereas Alcalay
brings just the last one.

Yiddish knows of course many synonyms for "tokhes": from German:
"hinterer", "hinten", "der hintern", "hinterteyl", "gezes", "shteys".
>From Hebrew: ""okher" (hebr. akhor, akhorayim); mixed: "hinterkhey-
lek"; slavic: "zod".

Bernstein has a lot of phrases with "tokhes", both in his general
part and of course in his "Rustica, Erotica"-part. Some examples:
"Osser-khazer iz keyn shvu`e, "kush in tokhes" iz keyn klole".
"Purim iz keyn jontef, kadakhas iz keyn krenk un "Kush in tokhes"
iz keyn klole".

"Tate, mame, bobe, zeyde, kusht in tokhes unz beyde" - azoy zogt
a yung poor-folk, vos hot khasene gehat gegen dem vilen fun di
eltern un di ibrige kroyvim.

"Kush mikh, vu di juden hoben gerut! - d.h. in okher arayn. Men
beruft zikh nemlikh oyfn posek: "Vayakhnu be-tokhes".
"Kak, az der tokhes iz tsu!" - d.h. vi zol men a zakh oysfiren,
wen di mitel felen?

"Mit eyn tokhes ken men nit tantsen oyf tsvey khasenes".

[Regarding] Paul Pascal's 19th century text (4.342):

I don't know the answer to the basic query but, I'm _really_ impressed
with the beautiful job he's done of rendering the text in transcription.
It's also clear that this is a text based on the dialects of Eastern
Yiddish. I mention this because the breakthrough of Eastern Yiddish int
print was only a few decades old at the time. A question of my own to
Paul: Why do you write _kreyn_, not _kroyn_?

PS: Bob Rothstein, re _gikher_: Thanks, I didn't know.

Subject: Noyfes Tsufim (Vaybertaytsh)

The Noyfes Tsufim--or Tsifim, to give it its "correct", frum aroysreyd
--about which my ben-ir Paul Pascal was wondering, is a Yiddish version
of a reasonably well-known Hebrew collection of the same name by the
Rebbe Reb Pinkhes of Korets, surname Shapira, an early and important
student of the Besht. The extent of his influence was rather diminished
by his support for the Rebbe Reb Yankev-Yitskhok of Polnoye against the
Rebbe Reb Duber Mezritsher (der groyser maggid) for the post of official
successor to the Besht--which is hardly to say that he was not without
considerable influence on the development of what's called Beshtian
hasidism. The Rebbe from Korets was an important and vocal partisan of
the Zohar, and is on record as claiming that it was the Zohar which kept
him a Jew.

Noyfes Tsifim is a collection of his own toyres, observations and
segules, as well as a not unimportant record of certain otherwise
unrecorded sayings and opinions of the Baal Shem Tov himself.

The publishers themselves are as interesting as their publication. The
Shapiro brothers (I don't think they were related to the Koretser Rebbe,
but I couldn't be sure) were--and to some degree, in the right circles,
still are--a mainstay of fact-based Yiddish folklore. I'm no
bibliographer, and to the best of my knowledge their operation was based
in Slawuta, but their accusation by Czarist cops, subsequent running of
the gauntlet and exile to Siberia (circa--I don't have the appropriate
materials to hand--1840-55), as well as their personal seyfer toyre, are
stories still told orally wherever Jews who speak Yiddish and love their
Yore Dea gather. I was born in 1954, and I first heard this as a
folktale. I'm assuming that Paul's volume was published by their firm.

As to Paul's question about kabbala in Yiddish, even if we ignore the
Yiddish translation of the Zohar done by Rabbi Yidl Rosenberg of Montreal
in the 1920's (er iz geven Mordkhe Richlers zeyde) as being late--we
can't ignore such common Yiddish expressions as klipe and sitre akhre,
the popularity of Yiddish versions of kabbalistic ethical works, the
entire genre of sippurei tsaddikim and the general trend of many customs
and superstitions--for instance, the backward-buttoning phenomenon of
traditional Jewish male garments, the standard rationale for the wearing
of a gartl (although the latter derives ultimately from the gemore)--or
any standard siddur, even nusakh ashkenaz. If you've ever said Brikh
Shmei when the Torah is taken out, you've recited a passage from the
Zohar. And remember, this is the stuff that puts the yid into yidish.

Subject: Heshl (Vaybertaytsh)

I have nothing to say about the Noyfes Tsoyfim edition, but noticed the
name of one of its authors: Yehoyshue-Heshl.  I think I've noticed this
name combination previously as well.  So it looks like the etymology of
the name _Heshl_ is Yehoyshue, which I'd never realized before.  (This is
assuming the pairing is a common pairing and that it's a pairing of an
ufruf-nomen with its diminutive, a lamoyshe-meshll and others recently
discussed.)  So at one point, or in a certain dialect(s) the stress in
the name corresponding to the Biblical 'Joshua' was probably on the 2nd
syllable:  [yeho'yshue] (although now it's on the 3rd, [yehoyshu'a] --
thence the nicknames _shi'e, shi'tsye, shike, shikl).  Hmm...

Subject: Geography and pronunciation

On Sunday I visited the Jewish Museum's exhibit on "Jews from Tsarist
Russia", which was based on Sh. An-sky's ethnological/anthropological
work in early 1900s E. Europe. One of the themes that was repeated
throughout the exhibit was that shtetl life was not as monolithic as
modern American-born Jews might think. Variations in design of clothing,
architecture, and ritual objects were shown--e.g., a caftan from Byelo-
russia (Belarus) was distinct from one from Bessarabia, for instance.

This got me thinking about the whole frequently-discussed issue of Litvak
vs. Galician pronunciation of words and phrases in Yiddish, and how you
could make an educated guess of a person's origin based on how they say
certain words. I even recall a TV movie where a character claimed to be
able to name a person's hometown just by hearing them pronounce the word
"water".

So, here's a question to get _Mendele's_ brains working: can this system
work backwards? If I'm doing family history research, and I come across
someone who doesn't recall where their family came from, what are some
Yiddish words (let's say no more than 10) that can be used as
"benchmarks"? These "benchmark words" would be a list of Yiddish words
and their variations in pronunciation for Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine,
Bessarabia, Romania, Bukowina, or other major regions of Jewish
populations in the Pale. It should be possible to narrow down this
person's family's home region by asking them to say certain words.

Has this been done before? Has it been proposed and shot down?
