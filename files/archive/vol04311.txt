Subject: Galitsianer

I would like to recount two anecdotes which bear on the social position
of Galitsianer in the eyes of Warsaw Jews.

[1] I heard the following tale in Israel in 1959, at the time of a major
influx of Jews from Roumania, with consequent friction between the
newly-arrived immigrants and the more established residents.

Yankel, walking down the street, sees his friend Chaim sitting in the
middle of the gutter, apparently playing with mud. Astonished, Yankel
asks: "Chaim, what are you doing in the street playing with mud?" Chaim
replies: "I'm making a statue of a Galitsianer". "And why are you making
statue of a Galitsianer?" "Because, Yankel, I don't have enough mud to
make a Roumainer".

[2] The second story is factual. My late father had two brothers, Nissan
and Abram, who had emigrated from Warsaw to Palestine in the mid 1930's.
Disagreement over a joint business venture led to complete estrangement
of Nissan and Abram, who did not speak to each other for over 30 years.
When my father,attempting to effect a reconciliation between the two
feuding brothers after so many years, sought to determine the basis for
the conflict, he was told by Abram: "Don't blame Nissan. It's all the
fault of his wife, that Galitsianer!"

Subject: Ayer Honor, was: Galitsianer

One of the authors quoted by Leonard Prager in his brilliant essay denied
the notion that a significant portion of Galitsianers are "advokatishe
doktoyrim". It may or may not be true, but in any case their legacy is
alive and well. What would one hear walking in the US courtroom (nisht
far keynem gedakht)?  Avade yidish!

Let's look into a professional journal published by Association of Trial
Lawyers of America:

     Title:  Oy dude. (Yiddish humor as applied to the law)
    Author:  Conrad Teitell
    Source:  Trial, May 1992 28 n5 p90(2).
  Abstract:  A short glossary of much-used Yiddish words and their
             definitions are given.

Apparently the demand for information was not met, because in the very
next issue the journal returns to the topic:

     Title:  Plain Yiddish for lawyers and judges.
    Author:  Ralph Slovenko
    Source:  Trial, June 1992 28 n6 p86(3).
  Abstract:  A tongue-in-cheek account of possible uses of Yiddish in
             legal documents is given, along with a 23-word glossary of
             useful Yiddish words and their English definitions. It is
             maintained that by using Yiddish words, for example
             'chutzpah,' the judge or lawyer may be able to express in
             one word a concept which would require more words in
             English.

The scholarly series was crowned with a study by Alex Kozinski and Eugene
Volokh published in the Yale Law Journal:

     Title:  Lawsuit, shmawsuit.
    Author:  Alex Kozinski and Eugene Volokh
    Source:  Yale Law Journal, Nov 1993 103 n2 p463-467.
  Abstract:  Yiddish words have become more common in the courtroom since
             the beginning of the 1970s. A LEXIS word search reveals
             words like chutzpah and kosher have increased in usage but
             have also come to mean a variety of things in the courtroom.
             Sociological implications of Yiddish in the court are
             pondered. Subjects:  Judicial opinions - Terminology Yiddish

Kozinski and Volokh write:

"                              ... Yiddish is quickly supplanting Latin as
the spice in American legal argot. As recently as 1970, the Second Circuit
not only felt the need to define "bagels"; it misdefined them, calling them
"hard rolls shaped like doughnuts."(2) All right-thinking people know good
bagels are rather soft.(3) We've come a long way since then. The first
reported use of "chutzpah" was in 1972, in an opinion of the Georgia Court
of Appeals.(4)"

"Other Yiddish words have had tougher sledding. Variations on "kibitz" have
appeared in ten cases,(6) "maven" in four,(7) "klutz" in three.(8)
"Schlemiel" (also spelled "shlemiel") comes up five times, but one is in a
quote from testimony, which doesn't count, one is in the name of a book and
two are descriptions of Woody Allen's screen persona.(9) The only bona fide
use was, believe it or not, in another Georgia opinion (and not by the same
judge, either).(10) "Schlimazel" is nowhere to be seen, even when spelled as
"schlimazl," "shlimazel," "shlimazl," "schlemazl," "shlemazel,"
"schlemazel," or "shlemazl." "Schmooze" appears only once, in--you guessed
it--a Georgia cases.(11) Unfortunately, the judiciary of that great state
stumbled this time, both misusing the word and misspelling it as "schmoose."
We concede that Webster's permits this spelling,(12) but what do they know
from Yiddish?(13)"

"Yiddish has also begun to appear in defamation cases. A 1972 New York case
concluded that calling the food at a restaurant "ground-up schmutz" wasn't
actionable because it was only opinion.(21)"

"Where all this will go from here is hard to say. "Chutzpah" is firmly
ensconced, and, we're happy to say, usually spelled right. Ch's are always
better than mere H's, and the h at the end gives it just the right touch.
"Kosher," "kibitz," and maybe "maven" and "klutz" are looking good. The
"sch" words are iffier, but we think they've got a future. Others, like
"nudnik" and "meshugge," haven't made a dent, though they deserve better."

Selected references:

(11) MCG Dev. Corp. v. Bick Realty Co., 230 S.E.2d 26, 27 (Ga. Ct. App.
1977). The opinion starts with, "The right to amend is as broad as the
Atlantic Ocean and as saving as the power of salvation," a nifty line,
even if mere English. Georgia also brings us "tsoriss," Banks v. State,
209 S.E.2d 252, 253 (Ga. Ct. App. 1974) (describing "appellant's
tsoriss"), "shammes," State v. Koon, 211 S.E.2d 924, 925 (Ga. Ct. App.
1975), and "gut gezacht," Whitner v. Georgia State Univ., 228 S.E.2d 200
(Ga. Ct. App. 1976). All four of these come from Judge Clark, the same
one who first used "chutzpah." See also United States v. Cangiano, 491
F.2d 906, 915 (2d Cir. 1974) (Oakes, J., dissenting) ("schlock"); United
States v. Scott, 757 F. Supp. 972, 976 (E.D. Wis. 1991) ("no-goodnik");
United States v. Mayersohn, 335 F. Supp. 1339, 1354 (E.D.N.Y. 1971)
("tzimmes"); Lerner v. Brin, 608 So. 2d 519, 519 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.
1992) ("rachmones"); State v. Stephens, 466 N.W.2d 781, 790 (Neb. 1991)
(Shanahan, J., dissenting) ("Better the majority should worry about its
umfarshtendenish of Rule 404(2), not Stephens' chutzpah."); cf. David
Margolick, At the Bar, N.Y. Times, June 26, 1992, at B8 (motion using the
word "dreck" arouses judge's ire). (12) Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 2030 (Philip B. Gove et al. eds., 1981). (13) Note 1, supra,
notwithstanding, there's the' right way of doing these things and then
there's the wrong way. (14) The same happens to be true of "putz" and of
"mensch." We'd much rathe be named "mensch" than "schmuck." Oddly,
though, a search for NAME(SCHMUCK) found 59 cases and NAME(MENSCH) found
only 43 cases. Perhaps this is because there are more schmucks than
mensches in the world; but wouldn't the real schmucks change their names
so as to better fool people, and real mensches change theirs out of
modesty? Besides, the true schmuck-mensch ratio is much higher than 59 to
43. (15) 489 U.S. 705 (1989). (16) Another little surprise: searching for
"goy" revealed dozens of people named "Goy." How come? Why would a Jew be
named Goy? And why would a goy call himself a goy? Cf. Gentile v. State
Bar, 111 S. Ct. 2720 (1991). Go figure. (17) 153 Cal. Rptr. 624, 628 n.2
(Ct. App. 1979) (Thompson, J.).
