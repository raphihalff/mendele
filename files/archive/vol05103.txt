Subject: Song query

A friend writes me asking if I can locate a song for her:  She spells it
thus:  Ver hot a zindele, a zindele a sein [sheyn?].  Oy gen lekh vi sher
endlekh, a nu hu mele a reins [reyns?].  La la, la....... Does this mean
anything to anybody? Thanks.

Subject: Oxford program

In response to Rudi Roth's comments from Aug. 15 [5.086]:

I attended the Oxford Program this summer and did indeed have several
problems with the administration.  Because of a misunderstanding, the
Institute charged me for an extra room, adding about $1000 to my Visa
bill.  It took me the whole month (and caused me more than a bisl tsures)
to get a refund.  Other students had similar problems.  There was also
discontent among some of the Program participants about the classes and
one or two of the afternoon activities.  It seems to me that the Summer
Program would benefit greatly from hiring a professional administrator.

However, aside from a few problems, the Program (in my opinion) was a
great success.  It brought together people ages 16-95 (!) from at least
15 countries.  Participants were exposed to a great deal of literature,
several regional dialects, some grammar, and many aspects of Yiddish
culture.  The "exotic" setting of Oxford makes the Program even more
interesting -- participants have access to great Yiddish libraries and
all the culture and opportunities of the University city (including the
throngs of tourists).

I would strongly recommend the Oxford Summer Program for anyone
interested in improving his Yiddish and experiencing a month of Oxford
life.  Two suggestions: request the inexpensive, off-campus housing; and
be prepared for some difficulties with the administration.

Subject: Some questions about yiddish grammar

In response to Beatrice Santorini's queries [5.102]:

	(1)   Oy, ligt men in drerd!
	(2)   Vinter fun dire varft men nisht.
	(3)   Lomir geyn, ver vuhin es geyt.
	(4)   Vos mir shtot un ven mir, ven yarid, az keyn ferdl darf ikh
              nit.

1. 'Ow, are we lying in the ground', which of course means nothing in
English.  It actually means: 'Are we ever screwed' (pardon the vulgar
slang).

2. Literally:  One can't throw winter out of the apartment; actually 'One
can't get rid of misery'.

3. Literally - Let's go wherever anyone is going; actually:  Follow the
crowd.

4. Who needs the city, who needs the market, when I don't need a horse
(to buy).

        what is "a lange tsung"?

A 'lange tsung' is literally a 'long tongue' or:  a big talker.

I'm not certain what the question about 'es' is.  As used, the "s'" is
simply a contraction of 'es' and it certainly isn't restricted to poetry.
Indeed, it is used in the contracted form in most ordinary speech, as for
example: s'iz mir kalt.

Zaretski is absolutely right about not using the question word order for
exclamations.  To a native Yiddish speaker (which I am) it sounds quite
ridiculous, as if the meaning were not definite. Note:  I have been
receiving Mendele for some time, but have simply not had time to respond.
I am a native Yiddish speaker and translator from Yiddish and Hebrew.

Subject: An-Ski's _Der Dibek_

To Zellig Bach's message about Anski's wonderful play, I only want to add
that there exists a very powerful Yiddish film based on the play.  The
cinematography is reminiscent of German expressionism.

Subject: Alveltlekh yidish/Global Yiddish

I would like to bring to the attention of all Mendelnikes (Mendelyaner?)
the appearance of the first issue of a new, Yiddish-English newsletter,
"Alveltlekh yidish/Global Yiddish," published by the Arbeter
ring/Workmen's Circle (45 East 33rd St., New York, NY 10016).  The editor
is Reyzl Kalifowicz-Waletzky, an occasional contributor to Mendele.  (Now
I understand what has been keeping her so busy of late.)  "The purpose of
the bulletin is to gather and disseminate news and information about
Yiddish language and culture in America and internationally to both
speakers and non-speakers of Yiddish.  We hope that this bulletin will
serve as an informational clearinghouse in a manner and breadth not
available in any other single publication.  The bulletin will cover
literature, media, computers, exhibitions, language instruction materials
and programs, e-mail, services, conferences, as well as performances,
meetings, events and activities sponsored by various groups and
organizations around the world.  It should be useful to all lovers of
Yiddish, whether the interest be of an ideological, popular, or academic
nature.  We plan to publish this bulletin quarterly.  It will be sent to
everyone on our mailing list and to anyone who requests it, at no cost at
this time.  By the end of July, an electronic edition will also be
published on Internet (on yiddishnet@shamash.nysernet.org) and B.B.S.'s
(Bulletin Board Systems), locally and internationally, requiring only a
phone and modem connection.  More detailed information will soon follow."

The address is given above; the phone no. is 1-212-889-6800, ext.
208; fax 1-212-532-7518.

Subject: Birobidzhaner shtern

There have been reports of late, that the "Birobidzhaner shtern" is no
longer being published.  (See, for example, vol. 1, no. 1 of the bulletin
"Alveltlekh yidish/Global Yiddish":  "The Israeli newspaper Maariv just
reported that the newspaper Birobidjaner Shtern has ceased publication
'for lack of readers.'")  I am relieved to report that "Birobidzhaner
shtern" continues to appear. YIVO receives its subscription via Victor
Kamkin, a bookdealer specializing in books and press from the former
Soviet Union.  It is sent airmail and arrives about two weeks after the
date of publication.  The latest issue we've received (as of September
5th) was for August 22, 1995.  "Birobidzhaner shtern" is in Russian and
Yiddish these days.
