Comes from Russian "golodranetz" (singular, male). Now, the
meaning is a little tricky given my tiny knowledge of
English. It is an insulting term for a poor person (golyi -
the first part of the word - means naked or very poorly
dressed). Applies with disrespect to a poor persom acting
improperly.

[Cf. "golegornisht" (Podolia) --nm]

Sounds to me like Russian "kletka" - a cell, or a literary
description of an extremely small room, like a prison or
monastery cell.

I think you are right, "kha" suffix is used in some cases
to designate a feminine form of a word (usually the
original word does not a feminine form, and sticking "kha"
is not grammatically correct, it is used in a spoken
language only.

I hope this helps. Ask if you have any other questions.

Subject: Holedrantses

The word _holedrantses_ that Berl Hoberman asked about is
presumably from Ukrainian _holodrAnets'_, plural
_holodrAntsi_ 'ragamuffin; beggar; poor person'.

Subject: Yiddish computer programs

To Jane Peppler and other mendelnikes about Yiddish
computer programs.Dorothy Wasserman has two Yiddish
programs for Macs and IBMs.Her address is 225 Central Park
West,Phone 212 724 7756. Oykh hob ikh an onheyb far mayn
tayerer dovidn ober khvell es nit citirn ingantsn,nor
dermonen der vunderlikhn oneyb fun Yud Yud Zinger's Brider
Ashkenazi. This is akin to telling just the punchline or
the number of the song for a musician-- If you know it you
know exactly what I mean, oyb nisht, leynt es.

A gut yor tsu ale Mendlnikes,

Subject: Landlorikhe

It seems to me that the "ikhe" suffix was probably Russian
"ikha" which makes masculine professional titles feminine.
For examples, try "kupchikha," an old word meaning
merchant's wife (masculine "kupets," merchant), or
"vrachikha" "doctor's wife" (old style), "woman doctor"
(newer and usually perjorative).  I'm wondering whether the
landlorikhe in the play was the landler's wife or the
landler herself.  Not that it makes any difference... Best
of luck to the translators.

just a parenthetical note: i think the usual
'amero-yiddish' word for the masculine is _lendler_.

historical linguists, please correct me if i'm wrong, but
my understanding is that the hebrew had a /th/ at the time
of the change. yiddish speakers could not pronounce /th/
and substituted /s/ (just as german speakers still do). so
the hebrew-yiddish sound change wouldn't be /t/ > /s/ but
/th/ > /s/.

the germanic das/dat shift is, i believe, from
indo-european *d, which went to t in germanic (grimm's law)
and then to ts or s (depending on position, i think) in
german (and, therefore, in yiddish). cf latin duo, english
two, yiddish tsvey; latin videre ('see'), english wit (old
english witan 'know'), yiddish visn.

so--yes, i think it's just a coincidence.
