Subject: Virtual shtetl on World Wide Web

When Reb Menachem-Mendl left his native Kasrilevke and went to Yekhupets
and other big cities, he had to write his dearly loved wife
Sheine-Sheindl long letters on paper because there was no e-mail. Of
course, now there is e-mail, but there is no Kasrilevke, and even
Yekhupets, I must tell you, has changed significantly.

As a remedy against historical injustice, I am announcing a Virtual
Shtetl: Yiddish Language and Culture Home Page on World Wide Web (URL:
http://sunsite.unc.edu/yiddish/shtetl.html).  Shtetl is under
construction, the first phase contains Mendele and Mail-Yiddish archives
(completely searchable soon), first chapter from Sheva Zucker's new
textbook with the special introduction for Shtetl, links to on-line
catalogs of libraries with large Yiddish collections, Yiddish songs
(sheet music and recordings), paintings and drawings, recipes and other
goodies.

Plans for the nearest future: Yiddish bibliographies, list of shtetlakh
and towns, photographs of important places, buildings, memorials. I
invite everybody to participate in construction of the shtetl. Materials,
ideas, suggestions, and critique are welcome.

Subject: Typefaces and databases

The recent discussion of vaybertaytsh has me fascinated, and baffled because
 I can't relate the terms "square letters" or "Rashi script" to anything I
know (which ain't much, obviously) about Yiddish or Hebrew character
typefonts. At the same time, I heartily concur with Harvey Spiro's yearning
for something like a CD-ROM reference work. My question: has anyone explored
the idea of a Mendele page on the World Wide Web, which might both allow
graphic presentation of Yiddish in the original characters, and create a
standing, accessible database that we could all use?

Subject: Fossil words

I enjoyed reading Dovid Braun's recent posting about "fossil" words and
phrases like af der gikh. There's one we all know, "in gantsn". But
there's one particular one that has interested me for a long time, and
that has to do with the presence in Yiddish of the word "heyt" as an
independent word, as in "di heyt" and not just as a noun-forming suffix.
I've searched various modern German dictionaries and not found it. But if
we look further in Yiddish, we find it used in an adverbial suffix, which
also does not occur in modern German, in words ending in -erheyt
(shtilerheyt, gezunterheyt). It seems plausible that the "er" portion is
a "fossil" of a German dative which was inherently adverbial and required
no preposition ( e.g. (in) a shtiler heyt ).

Another interesting one is "bay laytn glaykh," where we have an old
dative plural suffix.

Subject: Geography and pronunciation

I enjoyed reading Howard Gershen's recent posting, suggesting ways to
place people geographically by their pronunciation. I've tried it and
been wrong many times because dialect features each have their own
geography. If someone says "tug" instead of "tog" but says "mayn", you
would guess that it was Southeastern Yiddish. But in Moldavian Yiddish
you get occasional "Polish" characteristics: "Man tote ot gezugt", and
"fin ant uen" for "fun haynt on". You have to really know a *lot* to do
it, and you have to deal with dialect shift, as dialects widen and narrow
certain features. As Ellen Prince explained years ago on WEVD, a
nonstandard dialect will often be eroded by the host dialect.

An interesting example that I read somewhere was that yeshives performed
normative functions, that yeshive bakhurim would bring back styles of
speech and inform the locals that a particular local feature was
"hickish" (doubtless they got genudzhet a lot in school). The particular
context was of surviving preterites, which a 19th century German would
praise as pure and showing culture, while the local Jews would come to
think of them as silly and not au courant.

Subject: Etymology

One of my students is taking a linguistics course and is working on a
presentation on Yiddish. She is interested in Yiddish  words that
have  entered into English, the language of origin of these words,
how they have migrated etc. Can someone please suggest books,
articles and other resources?
