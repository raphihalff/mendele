Subject: Corrections regarding previous postings

Last week I had a posting bounced back to me during MENDELE's down
time, and I am trying to reconstruct it, since I did not save it and
do not have ready access to the printout that I made at work (YIVO
scrupulously observes President's Day, so I am sitting at home).

Anyway, the articles by Dovid Katz on Ludwig Zamenhof's grammar of
Yiddish appeared in the January 28th (not the February 4th) and
February 11th issues of the "Forverts."  Also, as was pointed out by
a devoted Esperantist among our MENDELnikes, Zamenhof's grammar was
excerpted in "Leben un visenshaft" (Vilna, 1909), and NOT "Dos naye
leben" (New York, 1909).  Both errors are mine and I apologize.

If you are interested in photocopies of the two articles by Dovid
Katz, they are available from me at YIVO (1048 5th Avenue, New York,
NY 10028).  Our minimum charge for photocopies requested by mail is
$5.00.

There is much more that could be said regarding Yiddish and
Esperanto -- I will leave it at this:  Aside from the fact that
Zamenhof himself translated several Yiddish works into Esperanto (I
have a book of Peretz and Sholem Aleichem stories in Esperanto
translation, sitting on my shelf at work), Esperanto was at least on
one occasion used by a Yiddish author for bibliographical purposes.
During the 1920s and 1930s it was common practice for Yiddish books
published in Poland to have added title-page information in Polish.
The invaluable guidebook, "Toyznt yor Vilne," by Zalmen Shik
(Szyk/Sik [with a hacek over the "S"]), published in Vilna in 1939,
also has an added title in Esperanto:  "1000 jaroj de Wilno" -- for
what it's worth.

I know nothing of Vietnamese songs but I do have an interesting and
related (genre-wise) anecdote to relate.  Some 30 years ago a well
known musicologist at the famous Indiana University School of Music
related the following story, told to him by his son, a musico-
ethnologist, also not unknown.

At a musico-ethnology conference a paper was presented by one of the
members which included the first reports of the indigenous music of
an isolated South American (I no longer recall which country) Indian
(Native South American?) tribe which had never previously
encountered non-Indians, let alone white people.  The ethnologist
arrived at the home of this isolated tribe after great hardship but
succeeded in recording the music of this tribe which he played from
tapes made on the scene.

From the audience a scream of protest was heard, "This is Polish
Jewish Hassidic music!"  Consternation broke out.  No resolution was
attained.

A few laters later, at another meeting of the same august body, the
original investigator returned, to report that he had revisited the
tribe, again after difficulties.  In light of the response he had
received to his initial presentation, he concentrated on questioning
some of the tribal elders.  He was finally able to piece together
the following story:

Many years, about 60, earlier, a white peddler did reach the tribe,
just before the beginning of the rainy season.  Because of an early
start to the rains, he was stuck with the tribe for about 3 months
and used to sing to pass away the time.

Apparently some of his melodies, Polish Jewish and even Hassidic in
origin, were incorporated into the tribal repertoire.

Subject: job listing, chair in Yiddish

I just had as lunch guest a colleague from Germany who shares my
interest  in modelling language change.  He informed me that his
university is advertising a Chair in Yiddish, and he is on the
search committee.  When I mentioned Mendele, he asked me to inform
you.  Here is the university and address:

Heinrich-Heine-Universitaet Duesseldorf.  Contact Professor Dr.
Rudi Keller, Germanistisches Seminar, H-H-U D, Universitaetsstrasse
1 D-40225 Duesseldorf. Tel (49)(0)211-311 2945  FAX (49)(0)211-34 22
29.

Rudi told me that the chair would be open re language,
literature,etc. They do not expect to find anyone qualified in
Germany, i.e., they expect to hire a foreigner, most likely an
American.  While I can't imagine someone on our list wanting this as
a lifetime position, a couple of years there might help establish a
young scholar as a Germanist/Yiddishist for a comparable job
somewhere else.
