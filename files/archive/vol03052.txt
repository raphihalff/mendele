Subject: Kurten shpilen

Dear Mendelniks,

I'm no linguist and have followed the discussion about Wexler's
theory that Yiddish is a Slavic language with some disbelief.  By
the way, who or what is Sorbian?  However I can contribute something
to Shleyme Axelrod, Hershel Bershady and Jack Feldman's discussion
about card playing terms.  My father-in-law who was born in Ostrow
shpielt kurten religiously - every shabbes!He and his friends use
the following names:

Bilke = Hearts
Shvartz = Clubs
Tsaylem = Spades
Lekach or Shel= Diamonds
Yingl = Jack
Maydl = Queen
Kayzer = King
Toys = Ace

No wonder there are so many arguments when Yiddish speakers play
together!

Zayt gezunt un shpielt gezunt.

Subject: Nokh epes wegn epes

When I first came across "epes" in Yiddish, I knew I had already
seen/heard it in German (and not understood it -- it's not in my
dictionaries).  So, prompted by Gregg and Ellen, I did a bit more
searching.

My first hunch was that I had seen it recently in Brecht's Mutter
Courage.  The folks in this play speak a language which reminds me
of Yiddish at times.  But after 30 minutes of browsing, I hadn't
found one example (although I haven't given up).

Then I looked at a few texts I have in Swabian.  There I found many
examples, including in a lexicon at the end of one book. Most likely
then, I've also heard it while I worked there.

In "So spricht der Stuttgarter" (azoy redt ...) I find "er thaet
sich lieber ..., als ebbes vershenke" = "he'd rather do ... than
give something away".  In "Plisch und Plum in deutschen Dialekten" I
find "ond do hen se aebbes gfonda" = "un dort hobn zey epes
gefunen".  Different spellings, but same word.

Swabian also strikes me as having many traits in common with
Yiddish.  E.g.  "mir" for "we" (as in "ein Bier wie mir" in a beer
publicity).  Learning Yiddish is improving my understanding of
German dialects and older texts!

Subject: OK, I've read it

OK, I've finished reading Wexler's paper in IJSL, and I'd like to go
on record as another linguist who thinks Wexler's claims are
completely unsubstantiated.

In brief, I found the arguments even weaker than second-hand reports
had led me to expect. I could go into detail, but I think the most
generous approach is the one that Ellen suggested way back: polite
silence.

So, my suggestion is that we go back to discussing Yiddish ;-)

Subject: Don Byron & Mickey Katz

Subscribers to this list may be interested in a recording I recently
picked up.  It's a new release called Don Byron Playes the Music of
Mickey Katz, or something to that effect.  It's a cd on Elektra
Nonesuch .  Byron is a fine clarinetist, formerly with the Klezmer
Conservatory Band . Mickey Katz, for those who may not be familiar
with him, was the Homer & Jethro/P.D.Q. Bach of Jewish music.  The
Prologue and Epilogue of this cd include some of Byron's avant-garde
jazz proclivities, but Katz' music is wonderfully and lovingly
recreated.  Byron's liner notes include a paragraph or 2 on the
significance of Katz' use of Yiddish vs. Hebrew. Highly recommended.
