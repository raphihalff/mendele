Subject: Introduction

Greetings from down-under.

I have been learning Yidish for the last 3 years under the tutelage of
Bobbi Zylberman in Melbourne, Australia. We meet once a week to read,
discuss and (with great difficulty, since my family spoke German) learn
grammar. I have recently discovered the joys of the Internet and
specifically the mendele group. It is always interesting to read about
the on-going search for meaning of words, discussions on history and
cultural activities. It gives me a warm feeling to be part of, what seems
to be, a growing community of Yidishists.

Just a question on the cd-rom issue, which is a great idea, however, is
there any Yidish work on diskettes? I don't think it would be difficult
to have a dictionary, novels and other works on diskette. In fact, we can
probably get most of the work on the internet itself. I would be
interested to know if it is possible.

Subject: Russian-Yiddish Dictionary

Howard Gershon asks about a dictionary for his cousin.  I have a
Russian-Yiddish dictionary, hardback, put out in a burst of liberalism in
1984 by the Russki yazyk publishing House, Moscow.  Unfortunately, it
goes only one way!  I wonder if that's one of the ones Kamkin is selling?

Subject: Cat's cradle

Ellen, I thought I was the only one to get stuck playing cat's cradle.
Well, I mannaged to ged over the "pinky point", but have never figured
out the next step...

I don't know, Dan, the meaning in Yiddish, but it's called "Savta
sorregget" in Hebrew (Grandma knitting). Maybe this helps.

And, while we're at it, the second figure in "etl-betl" is generally
called _a shpigl_.

Subject: Ladybug

Zellig asks about the Yiddish names for the "ladybug". My inventory
includes the following:

moyshe rabeynus ki'ele
moyshe rabeynus ferdele
gots beheymele
meylekh moshi'ekhl

I think that the specific rationale for this class of names is to be
found in general European folklore rather than in anything specifically
Jewish. The Yiddish names are, I believe, "Judaizations"

The most common designation in German is _Marienkaefer_, obviously a
reference to Mary. I assume there are numerous dialect variants as well
(Anno?). For that matter, who is the "lady" in English "Ladybug" (and US
dialectal Lady-bird)? You guessed it! Anyone with access to Volume III
materials of DARE should be able to tell us more.
