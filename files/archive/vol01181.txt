Subject: clarification

My question about faribl was 'can it be used in a sentence
that does not contain a negative'.  For example, in
English, you can't say "*I wouldn't rather be in San
Fransisco"; the verb "rather" does not exist in the
negative.  In Yiddish, you can't say "*ikh tor geyn"; the
verb "tor" does not exist in the positive.  So my question
was, can you say "er hot gehat a groys faribl" or anything
like that.

Ellen Prince misconstrues my argument, perhaps because it
was formulated too telegraphically.
 
My problem was not with Weinreich's use of "mezuzah"
(plural presumably "mezuzahs") but with Prager's use of
"mezuzot"; indeed, I cited Weinreich approvingly.
"Mezuzahs," in the context of English running text, is, I'd
assert, the unmarked form: it reflects (I suspect) the
unselfconscious pronunciation of ideologically uncommitted
speakers of American English.  If I prefer (italicized)
"mezuzes," it is because I wear my Yiddishist commitment on
my sleeve (pen? word processor?). Accordingly, I've no
problem with a Hebraist who writes "mezuzot," as long as
he/she does so as an act of ideological assertion.  What
*is* hegemonist is the assumption that transcription of
modern Israeli ("Sephardic") Hebrew is more acceptable/more
correct in the context of English running text.  Hegemonism
lies precisely in making the institutional appear to be
natural.

This is not meant to be a major issue, but something of a wink
at (or stab at the kishk[a]ot of) Yude-Leyb: the colleague who
writes so convincingly about ludic Yiddish might want to be
cautious about priviliging transcription from modern Israeli
Hebrew in a forum such as _Mendele_.

Subject: Bund?!

Just read Werman on yidishkayt.  A point of information:
there are no Bund schools.  The Tsisho (tsentrale yidishe
shul-organizatsye) schools were the Bund schools before the
khurbm.  (Sorry, the Yiddish school in Melbourne is
bundistish.)  The Bund is often used as a "synonym" for
non-Haredic Yiddish-centered yidishkayt.  I've noticed this
especially in Israel  -- it was assumed that since I, a
young man who speaks Yiddish but doesn't have
bord-un-peyes, speak Yiddish, I must have stg to do with
the Bund or come from a Bundist family.  nisht do's iz emes
un nisht do's iz emes. Besides the young Bundist
organization in Australia (skif = sotsyalistishe
kinder-farband) I don't think there is any activity of the
Bund for younger people who weren't involved since before
the war.

Subject: RE: Mendele Vol 1.180

I just opened my Jastrow Aramaic dictionary and see that
"klavta" is there as "bitch". While officially Kalbta, the
note says that the word is traditonally pronounced
"klavta". Is it really more complicated than this
