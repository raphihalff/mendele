Subject: A WWW page about Polish roots

I know it is not related to Yiddish literature, but I have to
recommend one superb site where you can get information about our
roots in Poland.

There is also possibility to receive photos from Poland region all of
today's cities and villages!!!

Also information deal with about 800 cities and villages in today's
Poland country.

The address is below:

http://www.geocities.com/Vienna/3326/jewgen.html

I had emails requested this info so I am sending it.

Subject: Scientific Yiddish

For a scholarly article I am writing in a scientific journal, I want
to use the term "bobbeh psuchology" (meaning unnecessarily elaborate
psychological experiments aimed at uncovering simple truths about
human nature that my grandmother could have told me).  I'm not sure
about the spelling. Is there a generally agreed upon way of spelling
this affectionate transliteration? I have seen it spelled several
different ways including "bubba".  But, alas, that would not
differentiate my grandmother from Bill Clinton's bubba, by which I
take it he doesn't mean his grandmother but rather, is referring to a
brother, or more generally a "good ol' boy".

I would appreciate your advice on this matter.

Subject: Idiomatic expressions

Alan Berkowitz asked in 6.270 about the two expressions "tzveytn tog
yontif" and "Ale montik und donershtik."

My mother, a"h, (New York born of Bendiner parents) used the first,
but with "tzveyte" instead of "tzveytn," whenever one of us children
came with a request or comment she had just heard from another of us.
I would therefore agree with Alan's interpretation as "a day late and
a dollar short."

I always heard (and use) the second expression as "yedn montik un
donershtik."  My understanding of it was always in reference to
something that occurred frequently, but not necessarily on a regular
basis.  The allusion to the weekday Torah readings is correct.

As long as we're dealing with such things, I know many people (myself
included) use the word "yenemzvelt" to refer to someplace far away.
Several years ago I was driving somewhere with a friend from Detroit
(parents from Poland via Argentina) who said "kenishkakn" in that
context, and I almost hit a tree I was laughing so hard!  Anyone else
ever hear this, or do you suppose it's just something her family made
up?

Subject: Idiomatic expressions

My mother's version of this was "tsveyte teg yontif", which is in the
plural:  "Second days of the holiday".  Her explanation of it
(although she was not observant) was that it referred to Passover:
The first couple of seders involved a lot of preparation, work, and
commotion, and the family had hardly recovered from them when the last
couple of days came around and it all began over again.  So the
meaning she imparted to the expression was more like:  "Here we go
again!" This was a favorite of hers and was usually uttered in
exasperation.

Subject: Idiomatic expressions

Alan Berkovitz refers to "tsveytn _tog_ yontef". That _would_ refer to
the _second_ day. However, the expression he's after is "di tsveyte
_teg_ (yontef)", regionally "di _andere_ teg (yontef)". Both refer to
the days of yontef that follow _xalemoyd_ (Peysekh or Sukes).

By the way, _ander(e)_, in this context, reflects an earlier usage,
even in counting, in which _der anderer_/_di andere_ means 'the
second' and not 'the other'. _zi iz bay im dos andere vayb_ 'she's his
second wife'. _di andere vokh_ 'next week'. _dos andere kapitl_
'Chapter 2'.

Subject: Vey iz mir (nit)

"oy,vey is mir nit!" is what my (polish) great-aunt used to say and
also is the first yiddish that i ever spoke! i never hear anyone else
say it,so i just assumed it was a polish jewish expression,or else
just a localism (she was from chigago.) don't know anything else about
it tho. anyone else have ideas?

Subject: Hemingway and Sholem Asch

Some time ago I posted a query about the connection between Hemingway
and Asch. I got an answer from Len Prager in Haifa, which led me to
Asch's great-grandson in London, who answered my question and is a
nice young man besides. So my thanks to Mendele for leading me to an
answer I had been unable to find on my own.
