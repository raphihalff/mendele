Subject: Jerusalem 3000

This year Bialik Hebrew Day School, the only Jewish day school with a
regular Yiddish curriculum in Toronto, will be celebrating the
anniversary of King David's Jerusalem.  Does anybody know of any songs,
poems commemorative material of any kind in _Yiddish_ suitable for
students grades 5-8.  As one of four languages taught at the school (oyfn
shpits meser) we must constantly maintain our presence in all events.

Subject: Looking for information on Yiddish Theatre

I'm writing an honours thesis this year in drama and I would like to
write on the Vilna Troupe. Unfortunately, finding sources and information
has been extremely difficult. If anyone out there has access to or knows
where I can get information on the Vilna Troupe or Yiddish theatre in
general in New York from around 1920-1940, please contact me. Thank you
very much.

Subject: Henry James and the Forverts

In the last two posts to Mendele I described briefly the discovery of a
genize (archive) in the old Forverts building that contained among other
things letters from Forverts readers to Henry James after the serial
publication of _Di Fligl fun Solovey_ (subsequently translated as _The
Wings of the Dove_).  This was followed by an explanation of how James
came to write his novel in Yiddish.

Herewith the final installment, the letters themselves. With a single
exception all of the letters were written within a few weeks of one
another in 1905.  The last was written in 1907.

Some readers have asked that they be rendered in English.

April 1, 1905
James:

I never would have expected that a shmate run by that philistine Cahan
would print such a brilliant picture of bourgeois decadence.  A second
Balzac, Marx would have said.  Yasher koyekh!  Yours for the permanent
revolution.

Only two suggestions: shorter sentences and speed up the narrative.

Lev Bronstein

April 3, 1905
Dear Comrade James:

We've been talking about your story in the shop where I work.  The
cutters say it's reactionary, the pressers read the Daily News, and we
operators wish you would write about people like us.  Why does your story
take place in London of all places?

Another thing: why is the action so slow?  And could you make your
sentences shorter?

Bertha Neytorin

Dear James,

Your story looks ok except that you don't know anything about women if
you think they're all like those upper-class sticks you write about.  If
you want to learn something I've got the next two weeks free.  You'll
find me at the Brevoort.

And for god's sake speed up the action and cut those sentences.

Emma Goldman

April 9, 1905
Dear Henry James:

A good start but I have a few suggestions to make.  First of all the
story has to move to New York.  That way the strike will be a real
strike. Then, when what's-his-name loses his arm after being brutally
assaulted by the New York cossack police, what's-her-name will realize
that the fortune her Yeke zeyde left her was built on the backs of the
workers, so she joins the strikers against the bosses.

I guarantee they'll love it.  One other thing: maybe you could speed up
the action and cut the sentences a little?

Upton Sinclair

April 11, 1905
My dear Henry:

Santayana and I read your serial in the Forverts the other day. George
thought it was very well done and suggested that the hero have a
religious conversion experience.  I concur.  We both think you might want
to speed things up a bit and simplify your sentence structure.

The family all send greetings.

Tayerer Henri James:

Pavolyinke! (slow down a bit!)  Vos aza aylenish? (what's the big hurry?)
Tut vi ikh tu (do as I do): eyder me zetst zikh tsu der arbet, trinkt men
oys a gleyzele varems un me farbayst mit a leykekhel, tsi a pletsele.
(before starting work have a hot chocolate maybe with some patisserie.)
Azoy ken men take oysshlepn a krenk (that way you can keep things going
indefinitely.)

Mikhl Proust

April 4, 1907
Henry James:

Let me introduce myself.  Two years ago you began your serial in the
Forverts.  Everybody in my cafeteria stopped reading it almost right
away.  I alone kept on.  I am your last reader, your _only_ reader.

Why did I continue?  Because I also plan to be a writer and I wanted to
see how you would end the book.  Now that it's finished, here is what I
have to say:

Gazlen eyner!  Retseyekh!  Vos in der kort!  Two long years I have to
wait and when it's over I still don't know what happened!!!  Did he
inherit or not?!  Do they get married or not?!

This is writing?!

I should have taken my brother's advice.  He took one look at your name
two years ago and he said then:  Vos mir 'Henry James'?  'Henry' iz
dokh Khayim, un 'James' iz dokh Yankev.  Heysn heyst er Khayim Yankel.

He was right.

Isaac Bashevis

James never again published in the Forverts.
