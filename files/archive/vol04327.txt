Subject: Plurals in -im

Although I don't know that I can fill Leybl Botvinik's  complement of
nouns ending in -im, I can offer the following standard Yiddish words
that don't come from loshn-koydesh: poyer/im (peasants), fakter/faktoyrim
(agents), tayvl/tayvlonim (devils), kundes/kundeysim (zany madcaps.)

From my Yiddish-speaking childhood, I can also recall use of the -im
ending with words that don't normally take it in order to display
contempt. For example, "aktyorim" for bad or ham actors, "ministorim" for
non-Catholic Christian clergymen, and my own personal favourite,
"rednorim" for long-winded, tedious speakers (this last was once
explained by my father as being based on the principle of "nor zey
reydn"). Less lightheartedly, but more commonly, the plural "Hitleyrim",
usually preceded by an adjective denoting national origin (usually
"daytshe" or "arabishe"--I'm simply reporting here). It seems more than
mere coincidence that, with the exception of "kundes", which "should be"
from loshn-koydesh, all the above examples end with a liquid in the
singular.

To: leybl botvinik

don't know eight but one other is _poyerim_, _poyer_ being germanic,
cognate of _bauer_. anybody know why this word got a semitic plural? one
wildly speculative possibility might be that initial /p/ in yiddish is
rarely germanic; perhaps the yiddish speakers figured it couldn't be
germanic and knew it wasn't slavic and so figured it must be semitic?
just a thought...

oh, another _possibly_ non-semitic -im plural is _kabtsonim_--i've heard
several etymologies for _kabstn_, at least one of them slavic. any
thoughts?

Subject: Song "Shlof, Dvoyrele, shlof"

In his "Hebraeisch-orientalischer Melodienschatz, vol. 9: Der Volksgesang
der osteuropaeischen Juden" (Amsterdam 1932), A. Z. Idelsohn records the
following song (#152, p.40f):

  Shlof, Dvoyrele, shlof,
  di feygelekh zingen in vald,
  zey zingen un shpringen in grinem groz,
  zey veln Dvoyrelen brengen vos.
  Vos veln zey brengen?
  Sheyne fayne ringen.
  Di ringen veln zayn mit gold bashlogn,
  dos vet Dvoyrele trogn.

Since Idelsohn was interested in the melody, he gives only one verse, but
surely there must be more. I have not been able to find the song in any
of my books and I don't have access to Beregovski's collection; according
to Ruth Rubin ("Voices of a People", Philadelphia 1979, fn.18 to p.38),
it appears there (Moshe Beregovski & I. Feffer, "Yidishe folkslider",
Kiev 1938, p.306), but she doesn't quote more than the above verse
either. Does anyone know further verses or other collections in which
this song is printed?

Another question: What exactly does "mit gold bashlogn" mean? Rubin
translates the phrase as "wrought with gold", and my guess was that the
rings are gilded (alias gilt). What do the native speakers say?

Please respond by e-mail to my above adress, and I'll post a summary (bli
neder). A hartsikn dank!

Subject: Gikh/gikher: help wanted

Help wanted, fast!

A. The Facts:

1. Yiddish renders 'fast', 'quick(ly)' as _shnel_, _geshvind_, or
(Standard Yiddish) _gikh_ (regional _gey(e)kh_, _gyakh_, and Litvish!
_gekh_).

2. The comparative _gikher_ can be used to render English 'sooner =
rather'; e.g., _eyder geyn tsu der arbet volt ikh haynt gikher geblibn in
der heym_.

3. Yiddish renders 'to hurry' as _zikh (h)ayln_ and _zikh yogn_.

B. The Hypotheses (or, 'Rediscovering America'?):

1. _gikh_ and _yogn_ are cognate forms.

2. Yiddish _gikh_ is cognate with German _jaeh(e)_ /_Jaehe_ (which is
probably cognate with _jagen_?).

C. The Questions:

1. Are there any regional German cognates of _jaeh_ with word- initial
"g-"? (Berlin, Anno?).

2. Is there a regional German usage in which _jaeh_ is 'synonymous' with
_schnell_?

3. Is there a German usage of the comparative that parallels the Yiddish
one?

Help received will be appropriately acknowledged in connection with
future publication (as will similar help previously received from
Mendelniks).
