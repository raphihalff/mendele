Subject: Introduction

Es freyt mir zeyer zich onshliessn in der internatzionaler chevra
Mendele,liebhober foun Yiddish. Mein tateh alevasholem, is geven yorn
lang a principal un lehrer in Arbeiter ring Shuln in springfield Mass. un
in Los Angeles.

Deriber nootz ich dem nomen Traister als mettle-nomen, l'koved zein
ondek. I am  a psychologist teaching at Cal. State U.,Northridge,(yes
among earthquake ruins, in makeshift bungalows). I also have a clinical
practice in which I specialize in helping Holocaust survivors. As an
outgowth of my book on Child Survivors (Shocken,1983) I co-founded
rap-groups for people who were children during the Holocaust and such
groups have become an international movement.

I write poetry and thanks to a wonderful workshop with Prof. Avram
Nowerstern last December,sponsored by the National Yiddish Book Center,
poems have begun to arrive in mame-loshn..

The struggle for primacy between Hebrew and Yiddish as seen through the
eyes of Yiddish poets has begun to fascinate me and I have written a
paper on it.

Subject: YIVO's Move to 57th Street

A mailing is going out this week, containing the following information:

"YIVO Institute for Jewish Research will relocate temporarily to 555 West
57th Street (11th Avenue), 11th Floor, New York, NY 10019, as of
September 12, 1994.  Our phone numbers will remain the same:
212-535-6700; fax 212-734-1062.  Please call ahead for our fall hours."

Regarding that last sentence, I would like to make clear that the YIVO
Library and Archives move will be continuing throughout the months of
September and October, and that the reading room will most likely not
reopen until the end of October or early November. When we are not
monitoring the actual transfer of books and documents from one site to
another, Library and Archives staff will still be working at the Fifth
Avenue building.  (Administrative and academic offices are moving on
September 12th.)  The reading rooms remain closed, however, and services
to the public (telephone reference, interlibrary loans) will resume in
November.

Subject: Macaronic translation

Just a theoretical footnote to an interesting and rich practical
discussion - as someone who writes about translation theory I think the
issue of how to translate a multilingual text poses very acute
theoretical problems as well as practical ones.  The reason is that such
a text puts into conflict two axioms of translation: 1)the translation is
to render the entire source-language text into the target language.  2)
the translation is to render into the target language the whole range of
linguistic registers of the source-language text.  The most acute case
of this is when some phrase in the source-language text is already in the
target language - as in many Yiddish stories set in New York, for
example.

My own preference is for producing a translation that's just as
multilingual as the original (though it's hard to know how to do that in
the last case adduced).  I think Helen Lowe Porter, the English
translator of Mann's _The Magic Mountain_, was right to leave the long
French passages in French.

Which reminds  me - didn't Singer translate _The Magic Mountain_ into
Yiddish?  Does anyone know what he did with those passages?

A gut yor,

Larry Rosenwald

Subject: The Secret Life of Bay Mir Bistu Sheyn

Sorry to weigh in so late on the subject of Bay Mir Bistu Sheyn (BMBS),
but upon my return on-line, I noted too many errors in various reports on
the song's history:

The original Yiddish song was composed in 1933 by Sholem Secunda (music)
and Jacobs Jacobs (lyrics) for the show "Men Ken Lebn Nor men Lost Nisht"
(it's English title was "I Would If I Could")  starring Aaron Lebedeff
and Lucy Levine playing at Brooklyn's Rolland Theate . According to
Secunda, Lebedeff kept making so many unauthorized changes to the song in
performance that when the show closed early, Secunda was not unhappy.

While the show ran, copies of the song were sold in the theater to
audience members, but after the closing, Secunda and Jacobs agreed to the
terms offered them for the song by the identical twin Jewish  music
publishers Jack and Joseph Kammen. BMBS was sold for the princely sum of
$30 to be split between Secunda and Jacobs.

BMBS surfaced again in 1935 when composer Sammy Cahn heard the song
performed in Harlem by Johnny and George, two black singers who
supposedly learned it from hotel mogulette Jennie Grossinger. The
audience went wild. Cahn, who worked for Warner Brothers, rewrote the
lyrics and without permission, offered the song to the newly formed
Andrews Sisters for their premier Decca session (it was the flip side of
"Nice Work If You Can Get It").  Only after recording and releasing the
disc did Cahn arrange to purchase the rights to the song from the
Kammens. It was Cahn, a non-Yiddish speaker who Germanized the title
changing "sheyn" to "Schoen" (umlauts over the "o").

BMBS was an immediate hit and not only made the Andrews stars but was
shortly featured in the (forgettable) 1938 Warner Brothers film "Love,
Honor and Behave" and soon recorded by any number of other mainstream
performers such as Ella Fitzgerald and Benny Goodman. Strangely, though
he premiered it, prolific recording star Aaron Lebedeff never recorded
the BMBS. The unanticipated mega-success of BMBS brought Secunda and
Jacobs into court demanding a piece of the ever-expanding BMBS pie.
Though some restitutions were made (like including their names on future
editions of the sheet music and 78's) Secunda and Jacobs never received
their fair share of the rich returns of BMBS.

Subject: Cagney's Yiddish

Vis-a-vis James Cagney's Yiddish the answer is a definate YES.

In his autobiography "Cagney" the caption for the original Yiddish poster
for the 1932 film "Taxi!" reads: "One of the few--perhaps the only Irish
actor able to read this Jewish directed poster..."

Cagney spoke Yiddish in several other films including " The Fighting
69th" (1940).

He didn't grow up on the Lower East Side, but in Yorkville and insisted
that the Yiddish he learned was from the streets--an excellent source
considering his ever-contentious relationships with the heads of Warner
Brothers (he claimed that the habit the Brothers had of speaking Yiddish
between themselves during negotiations with non-comprehending non-Jewish
actors/actresses failed miserably with him. Vu den?
