Subject: Sol Litpzin

The Times of November 18 reports the sad news that Sol Liptzin has died
in Israel at the age of 94.  Liptzin, the author of many works including
_A History of Yiddish Literature_, taught at City College and was I
believe the first in the United States to establish Yiddish as an
academic field.

Mendele invites those who knew Sol Liptzin to share their recollections
of him with us.

Subject: Lamed-vovnikl (cont.)

Ron Robboy asks (5.171) about my source for _lamedvovnikl_ meaning
'cricket, grasshopper' (my query in 5.170).

In one of Itzik Manger's _khumesh-lider_ ("Rokhl geyt tsum brunem nokh
vaser") we read:

		Zi geyt.  Un ibern tunkeln feld
		blitst shnel farbay a hoz.
		--Tshirik! -- a lamed-vovnikl
		tshiriket in tifn groz.

The glossary (compiled by Ch. Turniansky and M. Wolf) to the edition of
_Medresh Itzik_ published by the Hebrew University (third edition, 1984)
gives for _lamed-vovnik_ "also:  grass- hopper, cricket."  (The poem is
on p. 53 of that edition.)

Ron's visualization of the two letters as a schematic orthopteran is
creative, but I still wonder if there isn't a more philological
explanation.

Subject: Yak reydele to reydele

Since Mendy Fliegler reminded us of Daniel Soyer's query (5.158) about a
line from Sholem Aleichem's _Motl Peysi dem khazns: in Amerike_, I took
another look at the sentence ("yak reydele to reydele, abi dobre
meynele"), consulting Tamara Kahana's English translation (no help at
all) and M. Shambadal's Russian translation (a big help).  Since _reyd_
can mean 'word' and 'meyn' can mean 'intention' or 'meaning', what Mother
is saying is something like:  "The words don't matter as long as the
meaning is right."

Subject: Yak reydele

Thanks to Mendy Fliegler for his suggestions concerning my recent posting
conveying Sholem Aleichem's challenge to translate a certain phrase from
Motl Peysi in America. The phrase was "yak reydele to reydele abi dobre
meynele." Sholem Aleichem then adds something like "anu zayt a berye un
zetst dos iber af english" (I don't remember the exact words). Mendy's
response seems to indicate that I was not clear in what I was asking for.
I do know Yiddish (and English), so I understood the rest of the passage
in which Motl's mother mixes English words in with her Yiddish (mixing up
"kitchen" and "chicken" in the process). I think I even understand the
gist of "yak reydele..." -- that is that it doesn't really matter how one
speaks, as long as it is understood what one means. I was hoping that
someone might confirm that understanding of the phrase, and even come up
with a good way to say it in English. By the way, it is also very hard to
translate into English a Yiddish passage whose whole point and humor
depends on the use of English words in the Yiddish. Perhaps I should also
clarify that this passage is not an excerpt from the Morgn Frayhayt, as
Mendy suggested. I simply cited the Morgn Frayhayt edition of the
complete works of Sholem Aleichem.

Subject: The lessons of the "interview" with Gen. Powell

Little did I imagine that my quotation-marked "exclusive interview" in
_Yiddish_ with Colin "Peysekhke" Powell (5.137) would create such a
hoo-ha and hullaballoo.

If you want to become the proverbial fifteen-minute "celebrity" invent a
plausible pretext to interview a "big shot" and the media will soon be
after you.

It was naturally never my intention to mislead anyone, and if some
readers misconstrued the interview, it was with total inadvertence on my
part, still I beat my chest and say "al khet" -- mea culpa.

Caveat lector: please don't take this as an authoritative picture of any
particular dialect! It's just my attempt to extrapolate my knowledge of
written Yiddish backwards towards the patterns I remember from home. And
I've deliberately glossed over things like the differences between my
father's dialect and my mother's. (Don't want to overload the audience
with too much linguistics! ;-)

Subject: Got fun Avrom

Bob Rothstein asks where to find Got fun Avrohom. It's in the ArtScroll
siddur (now the standard siddur in many Orthodox congregations), on p.
620.
