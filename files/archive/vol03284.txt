Subject: Transliteration Table

After growing up in Brooklyn where Yiddish was the lingua franca and
watching it slowly disappear, it was wonderful to find this list. A glick
hot mir getrofen...which brings me to my question...

Is there a formal transliteration table for Yiddish/English so that my
Yiddish spelling doesn't get even worse than it is?

I must tell you that in my father's last year, although we frequently
conversed in Yiddish, I lived in Washington, D.C. and began to write him
in Yiddish. Of course he wrote in return. Somehow letters in Yiddish
always seemed warmer.

Subject: Word evolutions: foygl, feygele; klezmer

I dare say most are aware that Weinreich defines feygele as checkmark as
well as little bird.  I've NEVER seen feygele used to mean checkmark, but
the image is compelling.

Use of feygele to mean male homosexual was certainly known in Montreal in
the '30s. It never occurred to me to ask when, where or how it evolved.
Other bird allusions with disparate meanings are found in 1) foyglmilkh
for irrational fantasy or something impossible to get; 2) nit foygldik to
describe something not going well; and 3) (as has been pointed out) a
foygl may refer to a slick operator, someone from whom you might expect a
fast shuffle.  I can't think of any common factor here.

A jaunty plea for mercy for a bird is in a wonderful record called
CHICKEN (played by Henry Sapoznik's Kapelye):

hot rakhmones af dos feygl lost es lebn, est a beygl.

Henry Sapoznik's note about how very recent has been the first use of
"klezmer" to indicate a musical genre (rather than a musician) is (to me)
an astonishment.  I never thought of asking that question.  Now I wonder
when "klezmer" came into Yiddish (from the Hebrew for musical instrument)
to mean a musician, especially a traveling musician (a disreputable
calling in the shtetl). Apropos, I looked up a couple of things.  The
opening lines of the 1903 revision of Sholem Aleichem's 1888 novel
"Stempenyu" alludes to Stempenyu's father thus: "zayn tate iz geven a
klezmer."  The 1888 version does not mention "klezmer" in this context.
Could this mean anything regarding first use of klezmer to mean a
musician? Or, does it mean anything regarding change in status of a
klezmer from disreputable to (almost) respectable? The 15 years between
the two versions would seem too short a time for that radical change to
supervene.

Jewish weddings in Montreal in the 30s and 40s always had music played by
men whose conversation was characteristically saucy. They seemed a breed
apart, not "regulars," perhaps because they were hired hands.  I think
they were called klezmorim, but I'm not sure I remember accurately.  I
envied them, and I never got the impression that they were generally
considered low class or disreputable.  But then, Montreal has always been
a different kettle of fish, far removed from New York ambience.

Subject: "Feygele"

I was reading the Philologus column dealing with this group and the word
"feygele" in the English "Forward" when my daughter phoned from
Minneapolis, where she is in graduate school (in music). Like me, she
knows Yiddish only from what she has picked up, and perhaps from a tape.
I asked her if she knew the Yiddish word for "gay." She responded right
away: "feygele." I asked her how she came to know that, and she said from
Mel Brooks in "Robin Hood: Men in Tights."

Subject: Naughty bits in yiddish and various

Another addition to genitalia names in Yiddish--"shmue", which Harkavy
gives quite directly as "cunt"--how did he get away with this in 1928?
My mother, olehasholem, who was extremely puritanical in English,
actually used this as an endearment when crooning to my baby sister "usa
sheyne shmushkele."  As Michael Steinlauf pointed out, the lebedike
yidish of the common people was quite earthy, as opposed to the
prissiness of the balebatim.

Regarding the urgency of getting living Yiddish recorded--why isn't this
being done?  What happened to the Great Yiddish Dictionary?  With
dictionaries of everything from Sumerian to medieval Spanish getting
funding, why not a project of such importance?  What if the 400 or so
Mendelnikes contibuted a mere $100 a piece--would that be enough to get
things started, get some matching grants from the NEH or some Jewish
organizations?

Ellen Prince--thanks for the suggestion, but the story I'm looking for is
definitely not "Yentl der yeshiva bokher"--that was about a girl who
cross-dressed to get into the yeshiva--the one I read was about two boys
who fell in love in the yeshiva, with one cross-dressing, when they move
to the big city, in order for them to "pass" as a straight couple--quite
a tragic ending too, unlike Yentl.

Subject: Cricket

I am seeking anyone out there who can help with Yiddish terminology for
the sport of cricket. There must be some out there as it was and is a
game confronting Anglo Jews many of whom would have made references in
Yiddish in newspapers or magazines. I must confess that even I an
Australian born Jew has some difficulty in explaining the game to others.

Typical terms in English are:

Silly mid on (and of course off)
Short square leg
Googely
Slips
Bails and wickets

As far as Yiddish in Australia is concerned and Thomas Keneally is
concerned these are topics for another time.

Subject: Wife Beating, Ba undz?

The March 13th Mendele contained a hopeful interpretation that the
inclusion of the phrase on beating one's wife in the little purim ditty
was perhaps lifted from a non-Jewish ditty.  If the number of Yiddish
folksongs with reference to such habits are any indication (and I beleive
they are) , then such behavior was probably not too hard to find.  As
evidence I would offer:  Nemt a Yid a vibele which contains the phrase
"tse farn kugel darf men di vayb shlogn."  Or a little jump rope song
from my Bubbe's village in Belarus: Oyf di gas vos geyt fun Kolverot,
rays men bay di gantse shtot, dortn veynt Berl Polavik (this one names
names yet!), shlog di vayb mit a shtrik. Or how about the song, A Yor
Nokh Mayn Khasene, which contains reference to "raysn oyf di tseyn"
refering to the behavior of the young husband toward his unfortunate
bride.  There are many others.  Many also refer to Jewish men coming home
drunk and beating the wife, in contrast to Geyt a Yid in Shenkl Arayn,
which draws the distinction between the gentile who gets drunk and
disorderly and the Jew who, when drunk, likes to khap a minkhele or some
similar spiritual endeavor.  I am fairly certain I could cite other
examples of folksongs with reference to male misbehavior but I think the
point is made.
