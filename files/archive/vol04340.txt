Subject: Yiddish influence on French?

I've read on Yiddish's influence on English (as well as on German), but
not on French (which I guess is perhaps less likely).

Anybody know of anything significant? Esp. beyond vocabulary?

What brought this up is "go figure" which is said to come from "gey vays"
[alt-usage-english-faq]. French has "allez savoir" (infinitive, not
imperative, but still quite similar).

Subject: Looking for Barbara Pomerants

I received this letter at YIVO recently.  If anyone can help this person,
please get in touch with them.  I included their address.  if not, e-mail
me directly. <yankl191@aol.com>

a sheynem dank,
yankl salant

    I am looking for a former Yiddish teacher at Berkeley in the
    1970's called Barbara Pomerantz.  She also worked at the Magnus
    Museum there.  If you know if she is still working in Yiddish
    studies and how I might get in touch with her, I would greatly
    appreciate knowing it.  Dr. S. Spitz. 4450 S. Park Ave. #916,

Subject: Mainstream? Puddle?

I never heard of Shtentsl until I read Leonard Prager's lecture.  A
sheynem dank Mendelen.  Un tsu Prager, yasher koyekh.  Since Prager
launched his lecture from Cynthia Ozick's metaphors, "Mainstream or
Puddles" I have these metaphors buzzing in my head.  I know that my own
personal focus (lots of my time, but part time) on Yiddish language and
literature does not locate me in the mainstream.  Maybe that's a good
thing.  A dive into the gushing mainstream may get you washed into the
ocean and be hopelessly diluted.  Is that too great an extension of the
metaphor?  Next.  The notion of puddles conjures stagnation in my mind. I
hope neither Mendele's endeavors nor mine fit that metaphor.

Nu, oyb nisht "mainstream" un nisht "puddles" vos den?  Vu zenen mir?
Efsher in a gortn, a kleyner ober a bliendiker.  Me hit op di shprotsn,
di blumen fun Yidisher shaferishkeyt un mentshlekhkeyt.

Sholem-Aleykhem himself longed to be translated into Russian, the
mainstream of his milieu.  He realized his wish.  I understand that he is
thought to be a Russian writer in Russia.  The Yiddish originals are not
widely known except among the cognoscenti.

Subject: Vaybertaytsh

To Lisa-leah Jenschke:

_Vaybertaytsh_ is the type family used for most Yiddish texts (and
some-non Yiddish texts) until the late 18th century. After that time, its
use became more and more restricted. It is known under the names Yiddish
Type, _vaybertaytsh_, _tkhine-ksav_, _tsur_ or _Tsene-rene-ksav_,
_mashet_ or Ashkenazic Rabbinic Type.

The oldest surviving printed book in Yiddish, or at least with much
Yiddish in it, is _Mirkeves hamishne_ or _Seyfer shel reb anshl_, a
glossary to Tanakh printed in Cracow in 1534 or 1535. The Yiddish part is
printed in yiddish type.

Printing with moveable type was invented around 1450-1455; soon after
that, Jews in Italy and the Iberian peninsula started printing Hebrew.
Printers in the 15th century designed typefaces based on local manuscript
hands. The success of the mediterranean printers and the expulsion of
Jews from Spain and Portugal led to the homogenization of a - Sephardic -
basic square type and basic rabbinic/cursive type ( also known as Rashi
script) that have become normative.

Printers north of the Alps based their typefonts on the Sephardic types
which were already normative when Hebrew and Yiddish printing took off in
Central and Northern Europe in the 16th century, but also on Ashekenazic
script, both square and rabbinic/cursive. The Ashkenazic rabbinic/cursive
type is what we now call Yiddish type or _vaybertaytsh_. It was mainly,
but not exclusively used for Yiddish texts.

If you are interested in knowing more on the topic, would I recommend two
articles by Herbert C. Zafren: "Variety in the Typography of Yiddish:
1535-1635."  _Hebrew Union College Annual_  53 (1982): 137-163. "Yiddish
Type ("Vaybertaytsh"): Typography in the First Century of Yiddish
Printing."  _The Field of Yiddish 4_.

Subject: Book of Fables

I would like to draw attention to the _Book of Fables. The Yiddish Fable
collection of Reb Moshe Wallich. Frankfurt am Main, 1697_ edited and
translated by Eli Katz (Wayne State University Press, Detroit 1994). This
is a facsimile edition of _Seyfer mesholim_ with a translation,
introduction, and a complete scholarly apparatus at the end.

The _Book of Fables_ or _Sefer Mesholim_ is a Yiddish collection of
thirty-four fables and an important work in the history of premodern
Yiddish literature. Moshe Wallich did not compile this collection of
fables himself, but published a reissue of _Ku-bukh_ (Verona 1595,
published in facsimile in 1984  by M.N. Rosenfeld). The fables are based
on Hebrew and German sources, well told, and interspersed with references
to Jewish life. In the fable of the stork and the fox (nr. I), for
example, the stork invites the fox for "_kreplekh_ and almond rice and
all sorts of Purim delicacies." When the fox coaxes the crow to
demonstrate its fine singing voice in order to make it drop the piece of
cheese in its beak, the crow chants the blessing for the new moon (II);
the dog tries to persuade the cow to marry him by boasting of his lineage
which goes back to the dogs who refrained from barking the night the
Israelites left Egypt, promises his prospective bride a valuable marriage
contract, and reminds her that she will have to visit the _mikve_
regularly after she is married (XXVIII). There are more elements which
reflect the daily life of Ashkenazic Jews of the period.

Katz provides us with a lucid and concise introduction on Yiddish
literature and the fable, the original rhymed text in facsimile (with
lovely woodcuts!) side by side with an English prose translation, and a
critical apparatus.

This is a book not only scholars will enjoy, but the charming woodcuts
and Katz's lively translation ensure that anybody with an interest in
Yiddish will also cherish this beautifully published book.
