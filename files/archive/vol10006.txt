Subject: tok

Tayere Mendelyaner,,

I read the discussion in Mendele Vol. 04.600 about tok etc. In a little
dictionary 'Langenscheidts Taschenw”rterbuch der russischen und deutschen
Sprache,  Berlin 1959 19. Auflage p.465 I found for tok = Dreschboden, Tenne =
threshing floor. Reading the phrase in the context I see that the returning
arender sees the court in disorder, and and clearly he doen't like the way
they have threshed the corn and they have handled the patatoes. He is a person
who takes care of the pences! and the tok -he knows - is the best place to
thresh the corn. I would like to say that the explanation which is giving by
Lucas Bruyn is very acceptable and realistic. And how to explain that it is
possible to thresh 'corn of the cob"?

Zayt gezunt,

Jan Jonk

Subject: tok

Yesterday I send an email about tog. I would like to send this addition: The
'Russian-English Dictionary' edited by R.A. Daglish, M.A.Cantab. Moscow 1987
7e revised and enlarged edition' gives -page 556 - for (tok II)
threshing-floor and tok  (III) courting place. It seems to me that wenn we
accept the translation from David Assaf we change the point of view, the
returning arender sees the hoyf in disorder not because of the fact that there
were day-laborers, but only that they have not worked carrefully on the floor.

Subject: shok

[in reference to: TMR04.006]

I never enter the fray of Yiddish vocabulary battles for my interests and
strengths are not there but I should like to observe that shok in my family
was used generally at Pesakh time to buy "a shok eyer" which was the large
carton of eggs which had approximately 60 eggs compartimentalized. Actually
one  would state "a por shok eyer"  for buying many "trays" of eggs for they
would be used in large quantity to make sponge cake and in kneydlakh etc. It
was a measurement and was a fairly large number of one item.

Sincerely,

Seth Wolitz

Subject: Notes on 'shok'

Dear Sir,

My name is Jan Jonk and I am from Alphen aan den Rijn (Holland) not from
Utrecht.

Regarding Leonard Prager's Notes (TMR Vol.4 Number 7):

Frierich Kluge, Etym. Woerterbuch d. dt. Sprache, Strassburg, 1910. p. 411 for
'shok' - Schock N. mhd. schoc M. 'Haufen; Anzahl von 60 Stueck (von Muenzen
und andern Gegenstaenden)'; vgl. asaechs. skok '60 Stueck', ndl. schok '60
Stueck. Eigentlich vielleicht nur von 60 Stueck Garben gebraucht; vgl. mhd.
schocken 'Korn in Haufen setzen'- schoche (so auch noch schwaeb.-alem.)
 ufgerichteter Haufen Getreide'- schoc 'Haufen'. Verwandt mit mndd. hocke
'zusammengestellte Garben'.

In: Franz Dornseiff, Bezeichnungswandel unseres Wortschatzes, Lahr/Schwarzwald
1966. 7e Aufl.p.111: (...) Schock, das im Mittelhochdeutschen wie das
verwandte schoche (so jetzt noch im Schwaebischen) auch einen aufgeschichteten
Haufen benennt und zur Zahlbezeichnung (frueher auch Schock Groschen, heute
noch allgemein in Nord- und Mitteldeutschland ein Schock Eier) wohl infolge
der Gewohnheit geworden ist je 60 Buendel zusammenzuordnen; aehnlich wird
Schober vhl ndl. schoof; engl sheaf 'Garbe') auch fuer eine Zahl von 60
Buendeln verwendet.

Subject: amolik

Re: a question on 'amolik'

Henry Mullish and Jack Berger both suggest/guess that the Yiddish word
'amoliker' is related to German 'einmal'

In U. Weinreich's EYYED we find:
mol - time, instance
a mol - sometimes, formerly
4der amol - the past
amolik - past, former

The etymology seems clear.
But: Germ. einmal; einmalig - Yidd. nor eyn mol (1X)

Comp. Germ. ehe - before; ehemals, ehemalig.
damals, damalig = Yidd. demolt/demlt
Comp. Du. toen - at that time, formerly; toenmaals - then, at that time;
toenmalig - of that time.

Could 'amolik' be a contraction of (???)+mol+ik?

Subject: Translating a Yizkor book

In 1961 a group of people who had come from Brzezin, Poland published  a
Yizkor (Memorial) Book.  At that time there was a major disagreement.  To
publish in Yiddish or English.  It was decided to publish in Yiddish. The only
English to be found in this book is a page and a half declaration in English
which ends "This work is written in Yiddish, the language in which the great
majority of our townspeople lived, created, and ultimately went to the gas
chambers.. If future generations wish, yearn to come to know about the Jewish
community of Brzezin that was destroyed, and they will be unable to read this
material in the original, they will be able to have this historic work
translated into whatever tongue is familiar to them

The future generations now exist and they cannot read Yiddish.  Most of them
understand little, if any spoken Yiddish.  They are orphans in history.  My
children and grandchildren are deprived of the history in this book written in
part by my mother and uncle.  My own ability to read Yiddish is on the level
of  a third or fourth grade student.

If a translation exists I am unaware of it.  If it does not exist can we make
the Book Committee's  prediction,"---they will be able to have this historic
work translated----", be made a fact?

Is there anybody who can help me make the prediction come true?

Subject: Does anyone know Getsl Kakaruze?

Tayere fraynd,

In our family, we use the name "Getsl" or, in full, "Getsl Kakaruze" to
denote (and criticize) someone who is supposed to be providing a  service,
but is hopelessly incompetent at it.  For example, we'd use  this name for a
waiter who can't get even half the order right, or for a  ticket seller at
the movies who gives you the wrong number of tickets to  the wrong move.

I always assumed Getsl Kakaruze must be a stock character from the  Yiddish
stage, or vaudeville or radio or comics, or some such.  And so  it seemed the
name should be widely known.  But outside of our family, I  haven't found
anyone who knows the name. 20

So, please help:  Can anyone tell me who Getsl Kakaruze is (or was), in  what
media the name was used, who created the character, etc.?20

PS.  The last name is obviously the Yiddish word for corn, pronounced in  a
slightly non-standard fashion.

Subject: shtil, di nacht

I am currently researching Yiddish secularist songs for a lecture.  I have
come upon three slightly different explanations for Hersh Glik's choice of
words for pistol in his song, "Shtil, di nacht".  The three different words
that refer to the same weapon are "shpayer," "pistoyl," "nagan".  The first
word is German, the second is Polish.  I need help on the third.  One  of my
sources claims that Glik was expressing what he thought was international
struggle against fascism , and that the third word was specifically Yiddish.
A second source agreed with the reason for the three words, but claims that
"nagan" cames from Hebrew, and is related it "Irgun".  Ruth Rubin, in her
book _Voices of a People_, was told by a "former resident of the Vilno
Ghetto" (where the song was written) that "nagan" is Russian, and the use of
all three words in one song was due to the presence in the Ghetto of Jews
from all over Europe.

Does anyone on the list know where the word "nagan" comes from?  If Rubin's
explanation is correct, does that mean that there was no Yiddish word for
pistol that would have been understood by Yiddish speakers from diverse
parts of Europe?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
Martin Cohen
