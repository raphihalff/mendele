Subject:

I wonder could you help me to locate and secure a copy of the
Caedmon recording of Isaac Bashevis Singer reading his stories in
Yiddish?   I have already contacted Caedmon, and the recording is
unfortunately out of print.   I much appreciate any and all
assistance.

Thank you
John Dearden

Subject: is this a coming out party?

fishl kutner asserts that all our guessing re the identity
of philologus is wrong because 'the initial premise of
location is incorrect.'

uh, you wanna expand on that for us?

david werman points out the upside of the wexler scandal: 'yiddish
is truly establishment, having its first major embarrassment.'

Wrt Ellen's comments on pseudonyms:

pseudonyms are indeed very common in Yiddish literature (as D.N.
Miller pointed out) but what Ellen certainly meant is that use of
pseudonyms is certainly uncommon in scientific (academic) writing --
or if it exists at all, it is surprising and is not/should not be
tolerated.

In Yiddish linguistic periodicals, pseudonyms have been common, I
think not because of anybody's desire to hide but because often more
than one article is included by the same author. The authors usually
do not change their writing style or dialect when writing under
these pseudonyms, so they are usually transparent for those who are
interested enough to know who the authors really are.

Take for example L. Zamet (=Yudl Mark in _Yidishe Shprakh_),
Motl Sher (=Mordkhe Schaechter, ibid.).  I think Max Weinreich also
used a pseudonym when he appeared more than once in the same issue
of, e.g., _Yidishe Shprakh_.  This is done to a huge extent by the
current editor of the _Forverts_, Mordkhe ( Shtrigler ("Mordecai
Strigler") who writes at least three articles in every issue, and is
(perhaps) the sole contributor, of many many articles and snippets,
in _Yidisher Kemfer_, which comes out 2x a week.  Shtrigler's names
in the _Forverts_ are:  Sh. Laykhter, R. Royshem, K., among others.
And a dozen more in _Yidisher Kemfer_.  (I've been told that he
sleeps very little so can therefore be so prolific.)

I've heard that there's some form of _epes_ in Austrian German.
Anybody know?

Reyzl, your mention of the Xmas decorations on the suke where so
interesting and could really be instructive about how cultural
patterns are transferred.  I would guess that it was no problem
for the Boro Park (or Williamsburgh or whatever) person to use these
"for Xmas" decorations because she was living in a purely Jewish
neighborhood where the possibilty of a Jew putting up Xmas
decorations was nil, and where there was no or very little cultural
contact between Jews and Christians who use these decorations
forXmas.  I.e., the woman might not have had strong associations
with Xmas because she wasn't in a neighborhood where there much
Xmas.  On the other hand, a Jew living among (Jews and) Christians
would specifically associate the decorations with Xmas, and thus
wouldn't be likely to use the decoration him/herself.  If so, a
conclusion is that cultural forms adopted by Jews from coterritorial
cultures were not adopted as a result of tremendously strong
cultural interaction with the non-Jews, but because Jews were
somehow exposed to these forms and brought them back into their own
communities where the Christian (or what have you) association was
missing, and further cultivated them within their closed community.
(Take, for example, the dying of eggs among Ashkenazim -- obviously
reminiscent of Easter eggs, but apparently having lost that
association.)

Tell us more about that decorations discovery, please.  And sorry
for talking to you in English -- I've never done that before.

David Braun
