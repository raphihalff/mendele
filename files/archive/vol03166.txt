Subj:  A dertel

Ikh hob amol geshpilt dertel mit mayn foter, alov hasholem. It is
akin to a kind of bridgre and rummy. There was a trump card- it
would be wonderful if someone could help jog my memory about this.
I loved the game- words that shpilt zich.

Subject: Gehakte Tchainiks = Crackpots

Perhaps some of the ethnolinguists out there in Tuniyadevke can come
up with another example of a linguistic community in which people
who could do with some lessons before they apply for their poetic
licenses pontificate with such nonchalance. Poor Weinreich, to get
dragged into a debate on the basis of an introductory textbook. "See
Spot run. Look, look." And if he was a little extreme on Germanicisms,
is that a reason to pretend that one writes or speaks Yiddish by
mixing in a few non-Germanic words into German? Es platzt poshet (or
pushet, but not, in this context, einfach) di gal. Is anybody else
out there having a tantrum besides me?

Subject: aunt-uncle/geven-gevezn

1.  Aunt & uncle:  My litvishe tate-mame and their siblings all used
tante and onkl.  Mume/mime and feter were unknown bay undz in der
Brooklyner heym, where anyone accusing us poshete layt of using
affected germanisms would have been laughed at as a fool.

2.  The recent discussion of leyenen/lezn makes me wonder about
geven/gevezn. U. Weinreich's dictionary has only "iz geven" for the
past of zayn, though it gives "gevezn" as an adjective meaning
"former, past, ex-...".  Is gevezn as a verb considered daytshmerish
by some?  The Yidisher Ortografisher Vegvayzer (Guide to the
Standardized Yiddish Orthography, 1961), compiled by Mordkhe
Schaechter for a committee including, among others, both M. and U.
Weinreich, endorses "geve(z)n" as both legitimate.

(A visitor from Israel told me a couple of years ago that in the
quest for academic advancement there, it's good to be able to have
G.I.A. on one's vita. "G.I.A.?" I asked.  "Gevezn in Amerike," he
explained.)

3.  Anyway, why is the daytshmerizm so called?  Why not just plain
daytshizm? Does the -mer- make the term more disdainful?

Subject: Words spelled OYF -- Schaechter's Spin

I thank Reyzl and Mikhl for their input on OYF words.  I will try to
keep the discussion alive by asking for any comments you might have
on what's written on this topic in _Yiddish Tsvey_, (Yiddish II:
Intermediate and Advanced Yiddish Textbook), by Mordkhe Schaechter,
published in 1993 by the League for Yiddish, page 429:

    di prepositsie _oyf_ vert fun geboyrene yidish-reders
    aroysgeredt [AF] in mizrekh-yidish (lite un ukrayine), un [OF]
    in tsentral-yidish: [AFN TISh/OFN TISh].  in der sovetisher
    ortografye shraybt men es take _af_.

Subject: Tante-Mume

In my family, we only heard "tante," regardless of the generation of
the aunt/great-aunt.  Mikhl Hertzog has said his my family hails
from Volhynia.  I have one more aunt who speaks Yiddish (she's about
80 years old) and she uses both terms to refer to herself.  Actually,
I don't know where she's from--she's an aunt by marriage.
