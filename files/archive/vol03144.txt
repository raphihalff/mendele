Subject: Re: Yiddish 'spelling'

I was somewhat surprised to notice Yankel Lantz's amusement about:

>The local paper recently carried an obituary for an elderly
>Mennonite lady named Mrs. Elizabeth Schmuck.  Don't laugh.  I'm sure
>there is a perfectly reasonable etymological explanation.  If you

Why  laugh when  Yankel himself  surely  knows the  German meaning
of Schmuck, so its  use is not surprising by a  Mennonite.  What is
funny about the  obituary for a Jewish lady  called Betty Diamond,
which is pretty close to the above name?

I am not  always disinclined to use  certain words when I  am making
a strong point and my audience understands it, but goyim are exempt
from that.

When our sons were born, I vetoed frequently a name my wife
suggested, because "it is  something dirty in Arabic, Hungarian  or
Polish etc.". In Israel  with so many languages  understood, one has
to  be careful, but a gentile in America? That is going too far.

>Would a French Yiddishist really write "chmou...," er, "chou" or
>"choustaire?"  I'd be interested to know.

I am no  Yiddishist and my French  is very poor.  I  have recently
had much contact with  a French Oleh, who does speak  English pretty
well, but, at least at the beginning, when  he wrote to me, it
looked odd to read Chabbat  Chalom, or Chavou'a  Tov.  BTW  I would
have  written in "French Yiddish" "chouster", but I am no mumkhe on
that.

Subject: genug grammar

I love Mendele. After a day dealing with deadbeat administrators,
armies of students and phone calls from vendors I'm ready for
Mendele. BUT, what's with all the grammar stuff?  The language is
near death and I'm afraid the grammarians will kill it off
altogether.

Is there nothing else to discuss?

"In consecutive word order, the inflected verb is the first sentence
unit. The use of this word order implies the words 'so',
'therefore.' Note the distinction:

Ikh hob gevart oyf im. I waited for him.
Hob ikh oyf im gevart. So I waited for him."

page 122, _College Yiddish_, Uriel Weinreich, copyright 1949.

"Keynmol shtelt men nit stam azoy dem beygevdikn teyl fun verb oyfn
same ershtn ort. Faran in dem shtendik a gevise kavone ...
Reyshis-kol trefn mir es -- bay a lebendikn dertseyln ..." page 377,
_Gramatik fun der yidisher klal-shprakh_, Yudl Mark, 1978.

"... ikh for eynmol aheym fun boyberik, opgezetst dos bisl skhoyre,
a gantsn transport, kez un puter un smetene un shar yerokes. ZITS
ikh fartrakht, vi der shteyger iz, in himl-zakhn ..." page 97 (in
the morgn-frayhayt edition of 1937), _Hodl_ (chapter 4 of _Tevye der
milkhiker), Sholem Aleykhem, 1904.

You'll find that this construction is a prominent part of colloquial
story-telling style in Yiddish prose.

Hal Berman says poetic license. Nu, nu.

Gefelt es im yo zikh azoy uftsufirn, iz zol er; gefelt es im nisht,
iz meyle.

Subject: Verb first

Just a side note on the verb-first discussion:

The use of finite verb in "sentence-initial position" to show that
the sentence is linked to a previous sentence is, of course,
discussed in the Yiddish linguistic literature, as in, e.g.,
conveying the meaning "so...". What I wish to add is that this
verb-first thing as a strategy of units larger than the sentence
seems to carry over into varieties of Jewish German in the early
20th century.  Thus, see Matras (1991) for Jewish German speech from
the *Judendoerfer*.  As well, this feature  has been suggested for
interwar Vienna Jewish (German) Speech, discussed in a paper in
progress (by me).

I mention this, since this verb-first discourse feature appears to
be characteristic of Jewish speech, as opposed to non-Jewish German
speech.  (Thus, for example, in Matras's paper (in ZDL), where
Jewish speech uses verb first to mark off some sort of discourse-
type units, non-Jewish German speech from the same locale uses
specific lexical markers: na und na, etc.)
