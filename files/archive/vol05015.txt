Bla"z: While I agree with Andrew Cassel's reiteration (5.009) of the
importance of the National Yiddish Book Center making its primary charge,
the ingathering of Yiddish books, it is not merely to gather these books
under one roof that they are collected, there is also a very important
aim in the collecting: the preservation and perpetuation of Yiddish
culture, literature, and knowledge.

In order to meet this overriding goal, a new building to house these
millions of frail treasures is not a mere luxury but an absolute
necessity!  Why?  Because the cuurent conditions (at least as I
experienced them about two years ago) inder which these precious
materials are housed are frightening.  The lack of good climate control
with the resultant high humidity and oppressive heat during the warm
months takes an incredible toll on these books.  If they aren't
transferred to a building that can keep the relative humidity around 50%,
the temperature down at 68 degrees Farenheit or a little lower, keep the
moisture to a minimum, and assure the absence of vermin, while
maintaining a reasonably low level of dust and dirt, fragile materials
that are already in a sorry state will deteriorate further. Eventually,
you'll pick up the books and they'll crumble to dust in your hands!  It's
happening already with many of these volumes.  The sooner they are housed
in a building with a state-of-the-art climate control system the better
if we want to see these works preserved into the next century and beyond.
(I'll keep my nose out of the battle over whether union or non-union
labor should be used to construct the NYBC's new home for now, but one
thing I know for certain, it's got to be built one way or another).

Subject: Song of the Warsaw ghetto

Pinchas Gutter, the Chazan of the Kiever Shul in Toronto, remembers this
song, Shvaig Kindele, from the tragic days of the Warsaw Ghetto. Does
anyone else remember the song?

Shvaig kindele
(a song of the Warsaw ghetto)

dort nisht vait
dort vu der umshlag platz dort shteit
dort vu men shtupt zich in der breit
in di vagonen
dort vu a kind shrait tzu der mamen
oi mame loz mich nit allein
ich vill gein mit dir tzuzamen.

shvaig kindele. shvaig shvelbele
zog nit ois az du bist a yid
vail brider shvester, tate, mamen
foren alle tzunezamen
foren alle tzum farsamen
shavig kindele, shvaig hertzele
zog nit ois az bdu bist a yid.

di poltzei
zi hot geheisen schneller gein
ir vet nit vissen fun kein noit
bakumen drai kilo broit
un mit dem broit hot men zei geshickt tzum toit
zei velln mer
nit tzurikkumen.

shvaig kindele
(a song of the warsaw ghetto)

there, not far
there. where the umshlag square is found
where cattletrucks are filled with humankind
all victims
there, where a child cries to its mother
o mother, don't leave me alone
i want to go with you together.

shush, my little one shush, my cherished one
do not tell that you are a jew.
while brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers
are being shipped all together
shipped together to be martyred
shush, my darling child. shush, my little heart
do not tell that you are a jew.

the vile police
said you must quicken your pace
you will not know from any want
receive three kilos bread
and with that bread,
they shipped you all to martyred death
there is no more homecoming

chorus

treblinka, there
that is the jewish "place of peace"
those who arrive there don't return
stay there forever
there, where a child cries to its mother
o mother don't leave me alone
i want to go with you together

chorus

Arnie Herschorn
Toronto
