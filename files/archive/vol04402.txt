Subject: Introduction

Since I've posted a few times and have had many responses--a sheynem dank
alemen--I do suppose it's time to make it official.

I am Hershl Hartman, now of Los Angeles, once of New York. I am the
Educational Director of the Sholem Community Organization, affiliated
with the Congress of Secular Jewish Organizations, and a member of the
faculty of the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism. I
am a graduate of the kursn far lerer un hekherer yidisher bildung, School
for Teachers and Higher Jewish Education, an alumnus of Camp Kinderland,
and was, in my youth, a reporter for the Yiddish daily newspaper, "morgn
frayhayt." (After my first Mendele posting, I was reminded by someone I
hadn't seen or heard from in almost 50 years that we had both been
members of the Yiddish Theatre Ensemble, the successor to the fabled
Artef, directed by Benyomin Zemach.) I have also translated many Yiddish
works into English, including the first book-length g'vee'es eydes
(eyewitness account) of the Holocaust, published in Munich in 1948, and
Itzik Manger's "megile leeder." Enough already.

Subject: Introduction

I have been a subscriber and occasional contributor to Mendele for about
six months, but I did not introduce myself.

I am a retired chemist, retired Hebrew teacher, retired Yiddish teacher,
and the Phoenix area zamler for the National Yiddish Book Center.  I
still maintain an active interest in the promotion of Yiddish by leading
a small leyenkrayz and working with my wife who formed, and conducts, a
Yiddish chorus at our temple.  Our shames once responded very graciously
to my previous request for information about how many members there are
subscribing to Mendele. In view of his recent comments as to the number
of new subscribers, I think it would be nice to know when we pass a
milestome such "700" members, "800" members, etc. With respect to the
comments about putting Yiddish on a CD-ROM, just today I have read about
the Vatican's project in collaboration with IBM to put many of their rare
books and manuscripts in a data base.  This would allow much greater
access to these treasures. Why not do the same for great, rare Yiddish
classics (NYBC please note)?

Subject: Introduction

The request from our shames to new subcribers to provide an introduction
has reminded me that I did not, to my recollection, do so when I arrived
here at Mendele.  If I actually did so, but have forgotten, ikh bet aykh
zayt mir moykhl.

Born in Winnipeg in 1947 of a Vays-Russishe Mame and a Canadian-born
Rumeynisher Tate, I was sent to the Yiddish day school, I. L. Peretz Folk
Shule for seven years.  At that time, the school, which was called the
Jewish Radical School when it was founded around 1914, was losing some of
its dogmatic fire, happy simply to be a Jewish school existing in an
encroaching sea of assimilation. There was a "competitor", the Sholem
Aleikhem Shule, which was still doggedly a bastion of Bolshevism--at
least that was how we saw it from our viewpoint.  The first language of
both my parents was Yiddish, but they never used it with each other.
Outside of school, I used Yiddish only to communicate with my
grandmother. I took some Yiddish courses at university, but it stayed
pretty dormant until the last eight years or so, when I went travelling
the world from time to time and found it incredibly useful, especially
behind the late and unlamented Iron Curtain. Since I had close relatives
in the Soviet Union, and have been otherwise engaged in pursuing family
roots, Yiddish has helped me forge new and strong bonds mit mayne kroyvim
un mit yidn umetum.

A couple of anecdotes:  my sister's Israeli friend, settled in Canada,
had her mother visiting, and her only common language with my mother was
Yiddish.  Of course, the visitor's Yiddish was 50% Yiddish / 50% Hebrew,
while my mother's was 50% Yiddish / 50% English.  As a bystander who knew
all three languages, I think I was the only one who actually understood
what they were talking about; they themselves must have had only the
vaguest idea what the other was saying.  Still, they chattered away
happily for hours!

When I myself was living for a year in Israel, I would regularly visit
the woman described above.  At the time, my Peretz Shule Hebrew was
shvakh, so we conversed in Yiddish.  At some point during the year I
realized we were no longer speaking Yiddish but Hebrew. It was a strange
experience because I did not make a decision to switch; I only realized
after the fact that it was now easier for me to speak Hebrew than
Yiddish.  In the years since then, my Hebrew has had plenty of
reinforcement and it is probably true that despite my formal schooling, I
speak Hebrew more fluently than Yiddish.  But it gives me pause that,
even so, I find Yiddish is easier to read to this day.

A couple of months ago I submitted to Mendele a posting about a book I
acquired last summer in my mother's home town of Slutsk (Belarus), called
Noifes Tsufim, printed in 1850.  Mendele subscribers were very helpful in
clarifying for me what exactly I possessed.  I would now like to tell
about two much more recent books, which are also amazing--but amazing
BECAUSE they are recent. The first I found in a Minsk bookstore, also
last summer.  It is a hardcover book called Rusish-Yidisher Vertbukh,
printed in Moscow in 1989!  It is very high quality for the USSR, at
least in its format.  I find it incredible that such a book should be
published in such a place at such a time.

The other book is probably known to many Mendelyaner, since it was edited
by Uriel and Beatrice Weinreich, but it was new to me and still
fascinates me. It is a Yiddish phrase book for travelers, called Say It
in Yiddish.  I bought it but a few years ago. It tells world travelers
how to say such phrases as "please change the oil", "I have nothing to
declare", and "I want to open a checking account", in Yiddish.  It is a
testimony either to the Weinreichs' optimism or to their sense of humor,
that they could imagine situations in which the traveler might find (and
know that he/she found) a Yiddish-speaking auto mechanic, customs
officer, and bank clerk, on their trip abroad.  And it is an endorsement
of such optimism or sense of humor that such a book is still being
sold--and bought.

Subject: Introduction

Ikh "lurkeve" shoyn finf khadoshim (un hob groyss fargenign!): s'iz tseit
zikh tsu forshteln.

Born and raised in Toronto, 1948. Since they spent most of the war years
as "guests" of Stalin's resorts in Siberia, my parents did not consider
themselves to be survivors. Most of the family was murdered in the Warsaw
Ghetto, Treblinka, the fields of Poland and the Ukraine, etc.

First raised in Yiddish and Hebrew, acquired English in school ("the
Associated") and on the streets. Community Hebrew Academy, Camp Revivim
(HeHalutz HaTza'ir/DROR), Camp Ramah in Canada, University of Toronto,
Tufts, Hebrew U.; M.Ed. (Instructional Media), Ph.D. (History Education);
until '82 was principal of Jewish schools in Toronto, Brooklyn, and
Rochester, NY., Hebrew instructor at U. of Rochester, etc.

Since '82 have been running my own business as a producer of
informational/educational film and video, and living with my wonderful
wife (a psychotherapist) and three terrific teenage children (a gezunt
oyf alle zeyere keppelekh), in Southfield, Michigan (meshuge darf men
zayn..)

During the last couple of years have moved into software development and
multimedia projects, and have a new company called Media Judaica, Inc.
Currently one of three partners in a new Israeli venture which has
acquired the rights to produce the cd-rom version of the _Encyclopaedia
Judaica_, and deeply involved in so doing.

Tsu alle Mendelyaner, a freilekhn Yom Ha'Atzma'ut!
