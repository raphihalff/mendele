Gut yor

Relating to the discussion by David Braun of "gut yor," I
would like to bring up two factors that are not taken into
account in his accurate description of "gut yor" being a
universal response to all sorts of greetings.

1] There is a custom among the religious [and Yiddish was
influenced by the religious] not to return the same coin in
greeting.  Thus, "shabbas shalom" is not an answer to
"shabbas shalom" but "shabbas shalom u'm'vorach" is
acceptable; although this example is Hebrew, Yiddish
greetings are similarly returned with extra baggage among
the religious.  "A gut yontif" leads to "a gut un zis
yontif." I would suggest that "gut yor" has a high value on
the scale of "gut [some time or other]."

2] Another factor in greetings among the religious is the
difference in time that results in some people having
completed a ceremony while others have not.  For example,
when someone leaves shul after daving ma'ariv on motzi
shabbas, he is apt to say "shavu'a tov" or "gut voch" but
this would be incorrect and an unfeeling way to address
someone who is coming to shul and for whom "gut shabbas"
would be more appropriate. One accepted solution which
avoids this conflict is to say "gut yor," always
acceptable.

Noykh, our devoted shammas, asks about p'nai.  The use of
panim [p'nai is the construct form of this plural noun] as
person - rather than face - is classic [see TB Ketubot 7b],
and is found in panim Hadashot, a new guest, a requirement
for sheva brachot after the Hupa [or wedding], for example.

The mizraH, or east of [western] synagogues was reserved
for prominent people, usually guests.  May I speculate that
such prominent guests, assigned "mizraH setzen," [to sit in
the east of the the synagogue] were "panim Hadashot," or
new guests.  The "pnai" which I have also heard implies a
contraction, perhaps "pnai mizraH."

David: Maybe French toast too. But think of how
one"freshens" a piece of stale bread. Toast it.

Vicki: where was your father from?

Subject: Introduction

What to say?  On July 1 I shall be an emeritus professor;
that is, I will no longer meet classes; otherwise I expect
my life to be the same.

Since leaving New York forty years ago I have been a token
Jew at various universities from California to North
Carolina.  I spent my childhood summers at Camp Kindervelt
until they expelled me after I punched Zvee Schoolar in the
stomach for no reason that I can remember.  The following
few summers were spent at another Yiddish camp, Camp
Naivelt.

In short, it's been much more than fifty years since I have
participated in any kind of Yiddish discourse.  Although my
father was a fervent Yiddishist, and my first language was
Yiddish, my mother and he started speaking English to me in
preparation for entering kindergarten.  From there on it
was all downhill.

After a while I barely understood my father's Litvak
accent, although I made out pretty well with my mother's
Galitiziana accent.  So, what am I doing on this list?
Blame Henry Breitrose.

BTW, my recipe for matoze bri differs from the others that
appeared in recent postings.  Before I had to give up eggs
for the usual reasons, I would whip two eggs, add an eggful
of milk.  Into this mix I broke a slice and a little more
of matoze and stirred around; fry in a 12-inch pan; slide
into a platter for easy turning-over.  Serve with
butter/margerine and cinnamon.
