Subject: Anski

An interesting case of Anski's apparent influence has to do
with a small book of tales concerning the "Shpoler Zayde",
R. Aryeh Leib, entitled "Tiferet Mahar'el mi-Shpole"
(piotrkow, 1912).  Its author, Yudel Rosenberg, who is also
responsable for the tale of the Maharal of Prague and the
Golem in its presently accepted form, includes many
adaptations of previously published tales of the Shpoler
Zayde as well as some that are apparently original.  At the
end of the book, however, he also printed letters he
received from informants, including the then current rabbi
of Shpole, answering questions concerning local traditions
regarding the Zayde.  I discuss this, aong other things, in
my article "Literary Forgery and Hasidic Judaism: the Case
of Rabbi Yudel Rosenberg", *Judaism* 40 (1991). My
assumption is that Rosenberg had heard or read of Anski's
ethnographic survey and thought it a good idea to include a
"survey" of his own in the Hasidic storybook he was then
writing.

hi, harold. (we have to stop meeting like this.) i have
comments, not answers. the meaning-shift you're talking
about took place in yiddish, not english. english merely
borrowed the yiddish word. also, i believe (i.e. not sure)
that judeo-spanish uses _goy_ in its original sense. my
basis for this is a judeo-spanish song about the birth of
_avram avinu_ where _todo el goy_ turned out for the event.
it may be referring to everyone-everyone or every jew but
it wouldn't make sense for it to be referring to every
gentile.

as for contemporary israeli hebrew, it wouldn't surprise me
if the yiddish restricted sense has taken over, but it would
be interesting to look at sephardic and oriental usage there
40 years ago.

let's do lunch one of these days...

Subject: Re: Goy

Indeed, goy is Biblical Hebrew (BH) for a person whose
status is that of foreign national, while _ger_ was
originally the term for a resident alien. In the modern US,
a ger is a goy with a green card. (Ger did later come to
mean proselyte, someone not yet Jewish.)

Is an Israeli a goy? I know in Utah Mendelniks would be
gentiles, but can an Israeli be a goy? The term *is* used
biblically to refer to the progeny of the patriarchs--`from
you will come a great nation'--and Israel can be said to be
that nation.

There's "you shall be a _goy kadosh_", a holy nation (Ex.
19.6). However, these references are uncommon, compared to
the sense that the _goyim_, the nations, are something
other than Israel. Often the apposition is of _`am yisrael_
on the one hand, the _goyim_, or the nations who do not
know God as Israel does, on the other hand. [Or whom God
does not know.]

I am fairly certain that the word _goy_ came into Yiddish
from Hebrew. I have some idea that it would be hard to find
anything in Yiddish where it is used/applied to the Jewish
people. Hence it has come to carry a heavy load of negative
feelings directed towards "the surrounding peoples"--the
goyim as they were in biblical times coming to mean all the
oppressive non-Jews of the Yiddishphone (?--maybe
IOUDAIOphone?), that is, Yiddish-speaking, world.

Scholem aleichum Mendelniks !

A few minutes ago i saw a documantary on the dutch
television concerning the jiddisch (weekly) newspaper "the
Forward".

In the Netherlands there isn't any jiddisch periodic and i
haven't ever seen "the Forward" in any bookshop here
around.

But my interest in "the Forward" is huge, it looked very
good. Could someone give me an addressI coulde write to for
a subscription ? Or is there any other way I could obtain
"the Forward", perhaps in Europe ?

Ofcourse i would feel so grateful..........
A recht schejnem Dank !!!!!
