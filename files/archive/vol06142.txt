Subject: Hebrew Word for Windows

We frequently bemoan the fact that we are restricted to transcription
when we wish to write in Yiddish on Mendele. However, I have just made
the interesting discovery that if one accesses one's e-mail via Hebrew
Word for Windows one can already incorporate the complete Ivrit alphabet
(without nekudes). Or, at least, one can, if one uses Eudora as one's
e-mail software, as my colleagues and I at UCL do.

Theoretically, it is supposed to be possible to add a Yiddish font to
Hebrew WinWord, but so far the gremlins have prevented me from achieving
this. Meanwhile, Mark David, the moderator of the uyip mailing list, is
working away on behalf of the Committee for the Implementation of
Standardized Yiddish Orthography with the endorsement of the YIVO
Institute to provide for the implementation of the entire range of
Yiddish letters and digraphs within the the unicode system which will
eventually replace ASCII and solve all our computing problems.

But in the meantime, while we wait for the ideal solution, much can be
done with Hebrew Winword. I append a specimen text which I will keep
brief so as not to try the patience of those of you who don't have this
programme:

Subject: Dray flign mit eyn klap

With reference to the recent queries by Al Grand and Sema Chaimovitz
Menora [6,141. 5, 6 & 7]:-

One transliterates 'zikh' because the word is (normally) written with a
yud, but one often encounters the transcription 'zakh' (or, indeed, the
spelling with pasekh (/pasakh) alef) because that is (approximately) how
the word is pronounced on account of consistent vowel lowering before
the khof/ khes and reysh sounds. A more accurate description of the
sound in question is the open central vowel whose IPA representation is
an upside-down [a].

Olsvanger uses an umlaut over the o in oy in the 1947 edition of his
book (and a circumflex over the e in ey in the 1936 edition) to
represent the historical phoneme derived from Hebrew-Aramaic khoylem/
khoylem vov as well as from Middle High German long o and ou (in words
such as we would write: oylem, royt and boym respectively).

The Ukrainian word for cemetery is indeed 'tsvyntar'. And, incidentally,
Joachim Neugroschel [6,140. 3], when listing the Yiddishist's
lexicographic panoply, includes a Russian dictionary, which could,
indeed, occasionally be helpful, but a Ukrainian dictionary (e.g.
Andrusyshen, Toronto U.P.) would be infinitely more useful! And for good
measure, why not add Lexer's three-volume "Mittelhochdeutsches
Handwoerterbuch" as well?

Subject: "Do" iz nito in "nishto"

In my humble opinion Joachim Neugroschel, in his various posts in
_Mendele_ appears to parade unnecessarily with polyglotic phrases, some
of which in languages quite removed from Yiddish, excepting, of course,
the illustrative expressions in German. Similarly, in answering a query
in  _Mendele_ about the history of Yiddish (6.140,3), he appends to his
answer a list of no less than (count them) eight (8) different
dictionaries that the querent might consult, IMHO a futile excercize
since most Mendelianer, I'm sure, do not have such a rich access to
dictiionaries as a professional translator.

Herewith two slight general corections in Neugroschel's posts:

In a recent post he wrote (6.132,3):  When someone thanks you, one would
say in Yiddish "nisht do farvos."  [That would be the equivalent of
"don't mention it" or "thanks for nothing" in English.]

This is contrary to the _written_ and _literary_ Yiddish.  "_Do_" in
Yiddish strictly means "here, place," for instance, "nisht do gedakht"
[(this calamity) should not happen _here_].

Yiddish _do_ (in the meaning of here) is not included  in "nishto," as
it would seem from the poster's example "nisht do farvos."

It is totally different from the Yiddish personal pronoun _du_, the
familiar form of address (as distinct from the formal _you_, the
familiar distinction in Yiddish between dutsn un irtsn).  This _du_,
contrary to _do_, indeed merges with and is  incorporated  in  certain
verb cases  and becomes /tu/, examples:  darfstu, vilstu, zukhstu.
Therefore,  "nito" or "nishto" has nothing to do (English verb) with
Yiddish _do_ (adverb) . In another post (1.138,3) he wrote:  "The
component  tongues of Yiddish -- German, Hebrew, Polish, etc."  This
statement, too, is partly misleading.  The three main  components of
Yiddish are:  German, Hebrew-Aramaic, and Slavic.  Polish is part of the
_general_ Slavic component (that includes Belorussian, Ukrainian,
Polish, and Russian), and is _not_ a main component by itself, as it
would seem from the quoted passage.
