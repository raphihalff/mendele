Subject: Re: diminutives and plurals

There is a recent paper on this subject. I'm quoting
from memory, so I may be wrong. I think it is by David
Perlmutter and the title is something on "The split
morphology hypothesis". The name of the journal I do
not remember. If anyone on the list knows better, let
him speak up.

Subject: Introduction

Sholem aleykhem, y'all! My main claim to membership is
that I instituted the program in Yiddish here at The
University of Texas at Austin many years ago and even
taught in it one year when we were between teachers.
Our teacher now is Itsik Gottesman who is doing a great
job of interesting students and faculty in the Yiddish
language and literature. Though I am not truly a
Yiddishist, I'll enjoy learning more about the field
and its workers. I do medieval German language and
literature here, and I taught a short course in Yiddish
at the University of New Mexico German Summer School in
1989. If anyone does not know about our program and
wishes to hear more, please ask. Zeyt gesund!

David Sherman asked recently about Yiddish Vokh.  Gitl
Schaechter-Viswanath informs me that this year, it is
scheduled for Sept. 1 and goes on through Sept. 7.

Meylekh.

What I've heard from the Lodzers, if my memory is to be
trusted, is "yid" pronounced with a "y" consonant
followed actually by a long e sound, as though it was
"yeed".

As in the greeting:

   Vos makht a yid?

However in the feminine "yidene" (which I've heard used
only pejoratively) the "i" is short, but again the "y"
is pronounced.

Subject:  Re: stoch

I'd say "shtoch" comes from german "stechen" (p.p.
gestochen) which means "prick" as with a needle.  I've
heard the word in the song "A hazn oyf shabes", line
"mitm nadeln a stokh" (quoting from memory) meaning
"with the needle a stitch".  But maybe your context is
different.
