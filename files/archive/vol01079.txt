Recipes? You want recipes?  Well, I have here a present
from my mom: a 70 page bilingual recipe book put out by
Procter and Gamble in 1933 (hmm, could it have been a
wedding present).  All recipes are in both English and
Yiddish: "This is to enable two people (as for example, a
Yiddish-reading mother and an English-reading daughter) to
work together on any particular recipe."

I'd be willing to make a few copies for those of you who
sincerely believe, as the cookbook's author apparently
does, that "Goose-fat, chicken-fat, and olive-oil were good
enough when there was nothing to take their place, but when
it became possible to obtain a strictly Kosher and Pareve
fat in the form of Crisco, Jewish women quickly appreciated
its merits."

[Makhteyse!  Let's hope that P&G's authors were better
schooled than the expert who wrote the book we use.

Subject: Food terms

Ptsha, that food of the Gods, is apparently also called
kholodyets, but I don't know where (White Russia?).  This
came at first as a surprise because I remember kholodyets
as a _fish aspic_ (carp, highly peppered of course) and
equally delicious.  My Russian dictionary, however, defines
the word as either jellied meat or jellied fish.  Would
Bob Rothstein and other Slavicists please comment?

As for galarite (Mikhl Herzog) or galaraite (Golda Werman), the
Galician-born mother of a colleague makes a 'gala' which I
assume is the same thing.  Since she had lived in Belgium for
many years I assumed that the word was somehow related to the
French galantine, which means exactly the same.  Now I know I
was wrong about how _she_ picked up the word, but I wonder if
one of our gifted linguists would comment on the larger con-
nection if any.
