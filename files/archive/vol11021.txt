Subject: pen pals for Yiddish students

Sholem-aleykhem, colleagues!

I am looking for a fellow Yiddish teacher to be a partner in the
following project:

I would like to establish regular correspondance in Yiddish between my
two groups of Yiddish students here at the University of Michigan and
two other similar groups anywhere in the world.

Here is how I imagine the project:

Initially the letter exchange would happen NOT between pairs of
students but we would be writing communal letters from class to class.
Reading and writing letters would be a classroom activity, maybe once a
month, or as the letters arrive. The teacher would distribute copies of
the received letter in class and read and translate it together.
Homework assignment for the next class is to write a reply. The
individual replies will then be collected by the teacher, grammar
corrected, and during the next class students would copy the corrected
versions onto the communal letter. This can be done while some other
activity is going on in the class for those who are not currently
writing. Alternatively, the reply can be written not as homework but in
class, together Nevertheless it is very important to incorporate the
correspondance into classroom activity one way or another, because
otherwise students tend not to have time for corresponding just for
fun.

The main advantage of using correspondance as a classroom activity is
the fact that here we are using the language in a real life situation,
for which our students do not have an opportunity every day. This can
create greater motivation for learning. It also enables students (and
us) to expand vocabualry and even grammar in directions where otherwise
we might not go.

I would like to launch the project as soon as possible, but by early
January the latest. We work in semesters: early-September to
mid-December and early January to mid-April.

I currently have two groups, 11 Beginning and 5 Intermediate students,
mostly undergraduates. Ideally we'd like to have classes with
approximately the same number of students, similar age group, but of
course this is not an absolute condition.

My students know about the project already and they are eager to start,
and so am I!

In case someone is interested in the theoretical background, this
method of language teaching is based on the pedagogy of Celestine
Freinet. There are several BOOKS published about him and his method and
you can also get a good introduction to his principles on the following
web sites:

http://www.freinet.org/
http://www.freinet.org/icem/history.htm

I wrote an MA thesis about the application of this pedagogy in language
teaching. I wrote it in German, but since it was published only in
Hungarian translation, this might not be of great interest to the wide
public....

Subject: intermediate Yiddish textbook - help!

Dear Mendele readers,

Next semester I am going to teach a class of intermediate Yiddish
students, those, who finished College Yiddish. I used to use David
Golderg's YIdish af Yidish for such students, but I found it quite hard
to use a bit mixed up, and hard for students to digest. Does anyone
have any suggestion of an alternative/supplemental textbook for the
advanced Yiddish students?

Thanks for all your help,

Anna Shternshis

Subject: Yiddish and German mutual intelligibility

Shaloha from the island of O'ahu...

I'm trying to locate any published research that has examined the
extent of mutual intelligibility of Standard Yiddish with Standard
German or any equivalent dialects of the two.

I'm trying to make the case that Yiddish isn't "just a dialect of
German." I do have Several pieces of research that make this
disassociation, but I'm unable to find any research that gives solid
numbers on intelligibility e.g., "60% mutual intelligibility" or even
"mutually unintelligble."

Thanks!

Kevin Roddy

Subject: Documentary by Emmanuel Finkiel

On October 22, the public French-German channel ARTE showed a 90 minute
documentary called "Casting", by Emmanuel Finkiel, which might be
interesting for the members of this list.

Finkiel had made two films previously, "Madame Jacques sur la
Croisette" (1995) and "Voyages" (1999), both including many dialogues
in yiddish ("Voyages", a fiction about the intertwined lives of three
elderly female holocaust survivors in France, Poland and Israel, which
was awarded the prestigious prix Louis Delluc in 1999, was in my
opinion a very moving film). For the preparation of those films,
Finkiel had sought for nonprofessionnal actors in the French askhenazic
community, with ads like "looking for Yiddish speaking men and women
between 65 and 90 for a fiction film".  The documentary "Casting" is
made with some excerpts of the videos filmed with the potential actors.
It is a very interesting and moving documentary, with many
unforgettable characters.

Zayt gezunt,

Subject: schoolgirls from Krakow

In response to a recent Thalia Klein's inquiry on Mendele [11.018],
about a Holocaust episode involving 93 girls who took their own lives
to avoid falling into the hands of the Nazi soldiers:

The Hebrew poet Prof Hillel Bavli has a poem on the subject which was
included in the High Holy Day Mahzor of the Conservative Rabbinical
Assembly.

Holocaust researchers have not found any factual evidence for this
story. There have been a number of articles in Yiddish periodicals
throughout the years describing this as strictly legendary.

Subject: Howe-Greenberg and the Proletpen poets

a) I liked the clarification on the subject of the Howe-Greenberg
anthology and Proletpen. It wouldn't have been in keeping with Irving
Howe's approach to such matters for him to have blacklisted left-wing
writers.

One point I disagree with: Prof. Prager writes "Signal_, like several
other literary journals of the period (e.g. _Inzikh_) adopted the
Soviet spelling codex." I don't think that the "naturalized" spelling
of Hebrew-origin words should be known as the "Soviet spelling codex."
As you note, several journals of the period adopted this spelling and
most of them had no sympathy for the Soviet Union. Eliezer Shteynbarg
in Rumania, for example, insisted on this orthography and he was far
from a left-winger. I would recommend using a neutral term, such as
"naturalized" (Yiddish "naturalizirt"), in order not to imply that the
Soviet Union was the inspiration for this spelling change. On the
contrary, it seems to me that it was mere coincidence that several
different movements, as it were, advocated the same form.

b) Thanks for the compliments about Yugntruf (TMR 5.014).

Subject: Eliezer Greenberg's poem

My name is Joshua Abelman.  Eliezer Greenberg was my great uncle.  His
sister, Esther, married educator Joseph Cheskis (Middlesex Univ. &
Brandeis)and they had my mother, Josephine Cheskis.  Unfortunately, my
mother passed when I was quite young(9 months).  At this time, Uncle
Lazer wrote a poem, which translated from the yiddish, is titled To
Orphaned Parents.( I believe)  He wrote this for Esther and Joseph who
were both alive at the time.  I have tried fruitlessly to find this
poem. I was hoping you could be of some help.  Thank you for your time
and consideration.

Sincerely,
Joshua Abelman

Subject: shtetl wedding

In answer to Lori Cahan-Simon's request for information about the
shtetl wedding [11.020], may I recommend (at the expense of being
immodes) the book by Pauline Wengeroff, "Rememberings. The World of a
Russian-Jewish Woman in the Nineteenth Century" translated by Henny
Wenkart and edited by me (University Press of Maryland, 2000)? The book
has a detailed account of two weddings, her own and her sister's.
Wengeroff grew up in Brisk, a large town, but she was married in a
small shtetl, Konotop. She gives full details about her trousseau, her
courtship, the actual wedding, the food and the clothes. I know of no
more complete or more reliable description.

The book is a treasure trove of information also about her early years,
her later life, and the great bitterness she felt over the way her
family modernized.

By the way, it may interest readers of Mendele to know something about
how we handled the Yiddish transcriptions in this volume. It seemed
likely to me that Wengeroff spoke some dialect of Lithuanian Yiddish
but was actually most comfortable in what she calls "Russian German".
She and her family find it easier to speak to her future in-laws in
Russian rather than Yiddish. Wengeroff herself was quite impressed with
the ethnographic attempts to preserve Jewish folk songs and culture and
she made an effort to preserve Yiddish songs and words in her book, but
in the original German publications of her memoirs she almost always
transcribes Yiddish in the western, German fashion rather than in
either Lithuanian or Polish Yiddish (e.g., mauchel for "moychel" --
forgive) and also uses German terms like barches for the "challah"
breads. When publishing the book, we had no way to decide whether these
westernized forms had been introduced by the publisher, were done by
her for her German reading audience, or actually reflected the dialect
she spoke as a child, and so we left the orthography essentially as she
had written it.
