Subject: Modern Language Association Call for Bibliographers

The MLA International Bibliography is looking for people who would be
interested in indexing scholarly books and journals in the fields of
Yiddish language, literature, and folklore.

The bibliography is compiled by volunteer specialists in various subject
fields, in cooperation with the staff of the MLA Center for
Bibliographical Services.  Bibliographers generally have a fixed
assignment of five or more journals, from which they contribute 25 to 50
citations a year. Bibliographers are also encouraged to index new books
in their field.  The bibliographic information is recorded on worksheets
and mailed to the MLA Center for Bibliographical Services for processing.

Although bibliographers are not paid, they do receive a complimentary
copy of the complete printed bibliography, in which their name is listed
among the contributors.  Upon request, a letter of acknowledgment is sent
to the bibliographer's dean, department head, or supervisor.

If you are interested in becoming a volunteer bibliographer, please send
a letter and resume to Terence Ford, Editor, MLA International
Bibliography, 10 Astor Place, New York, NY 10003-6981.  Tel:  212
614-6348.  E-mail:  ford@mla.org

Subject: Koyletsh

As far as I know, koyletsh refers to a round khale eaten on certain
holidays, esp. Purim. I assume, the ingredients are the same as the usual
braided or bilka types of khale.

Subject: Kinship and modernity in Moldavia

Ghitta Sternberg's ethnography of Stefanesti, a shtetl on the border of
Bessarabia, notes an interesting twist on Yiddish kinship terminology.
She felt that the shtetl was headed toward assimilation, with the ability
to speak Romanian fluently, without a Yiddish accent, considered a
desideratum. She also says that the townspeople would have vigorously
denied this prediction. What they wanted was modernity, an acculturation
and participation in the national life of their country, but not an out
and out rejection of Yiddish.

The townspeople classified people along a continuum of traditional to
modern. The way one addressed an aunt who was traditional was to call her
"mime", whereas if she were more modern, wearing Western European
clothing styles, for instance, she would be addressed as "tante".
Sternberg points out that it was all somewhat unconscious, that someone
would address a modern-thinking aunt as "mime" was just unthinkable.

Sternberg also points out the townspeople were aware of a connection with
German and German culture, but that they considered it a connection in
which they were the "poor relation". They viewed this culture as superior
to their own. What's interesting is that they adopted a daytshmerizm
"tante" to identi- fy people categorized as what might be considered
"German", i.e. modern.

I've heard a lot of American Jews use the word tante and wonder, is it
indeed a daytshmerizm? If so, it is ironic that the Germans themselves
had rejected Oheim and Mumme for Onkel and Tante, respectively as being
more "cultivated", i.e. French.

Just some nice Erev-Shabes musings. I really do hope other Mendelyaners
will read that book. Sternberg's whole premise is that the Romanian
shtetl was indeed different from shtetlekh in the Slavophone countries,
and that it merits study. I agree, and also feel it's one of the most
charming and touching ethnographies I've ever read (I was an anthro major
in college).

Subject: Nokhamol gezindikt

The shames has been informed by more than one of our sharp-eyed readers
that Vol 4.415 (May 10, 1995) was mislabelled Vol 4.414.  Apologies.
The archive will be corrected.

These being the last words in Vol.4, let us hope that a new year (and
a new machine!) will both be error-free.
