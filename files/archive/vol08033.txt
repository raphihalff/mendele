Subject: Less than gracious criticism

Goldie Morgentaler's sharp criticism (Mendele 08.027) of a proofreading slip
in the most recent issue of THE MENDELE REVIEW compels a response. If she
were aware of the amount of work and the time devoted to produce each issue
of TMR, she would have realized that it is almost impossible for the editor
to catch each oversight or to correct every error. After all, TMR, issued
almost weekly, consists of a dozen or so pages of original work -
translations, biographies, romanization, historical background, criticism,
etc. This work is done by precious few volunteers, inspired and guided by the
gentle hand of the hard-working editor, Leonard Prager. Letters of
appreciation and encouragement like the one from Moyshe Moskowitz, in the
same issue of Mendele as Ms. Morgentaler's rebuke, would be more welcome than
those consisting merely of nit-picking and expressions of indignation.  "To
err is human; to forgive, divine." 

Those of you who do read and enjoy TMR, please respond more often, so that
those who produce TMR know that someone out there is "listening."  Hopefully,
your reactions will be positive, but <constructive> criticism is OK too.

Subject: Sholem Aleichem Short Story, "A Yom Kippur Scandal"

I am a reference librarian in California.  I am desperately searching for a
Yiddish-language version of a short, short story by Sholem Aleichem that goes
under the English title of "A Yom Kippur Scandal".  It does not appear to be
in "Ale Verk fun Sholem-Aleykhem", and I am beginning to think that, perhaps,
the title of the story was changed when it was published in English. (The
English version can be found in "The Best of Sholem Aleichem", Sholem
Aleichem's "The Old Country" (1946), and "Short Stories".)

Does anybody out there know of where I can find a Yiddish version of "A Yom
Kippur Scandal" for my patron.  I can be reached by e-mail at
mclsref@mclsys.org, or by fax at (213) 228-7579. 

Thanks,
Shari Haber

Subject: "frenk"

David Herskovic mentioned the use of word _frenk_ for a sphardi.

The term "frenk" for a sephardic Jew is indeed regarded as insulting. 
Strange as it may seem, in its original meaning, the word Frenk meant
Ashkenazi, and is derived, of course, from the word for France (Frankreich,
in German, is clearly related). Apparently, Jews from Western Europe who,
because of the frequent expulsions and other disasters, left Western Europe
and joined predominantly Sephardic communities in the Turkish Empire
(including Eretz Yisrael), were called Ashkenazi or Frank by the Sepharadim.
Hence the common surname Ashkenazi among Sepharadim to this day. Even after
the Ashkenazic families were thoroughly integrated into the Sephardic
community, the surname remained. 

Speaking of pejoratives, have you heard the term "vuzvuz" applied to
Ashkenazim? Apparently derived from the frequent use of "vus? vus?" in
Yiddish. I am not sure that there is any real insult attached to this,
though. I often say to people who ask about my origins: Ani? Ani vuzvuz.  For
that matter, some of my Sephardic friends and colleagues often refer to
themselves as frenkim. Perhaps the insult has worn off and all that is left
is the wry humour?

Subject: Neutral Yiddish words turn pejorative in English

Ich shtim mit Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan in alles chitz mit der vort shikse. 
Shikse and shaygetz are pejorative to begin with. She is right goy means
simply a non-Jew. The root of the words shikse and shaygetz are from the
Hebrew word shaketz. In The Complete Hebrew-English Dictionary by REUBEN
ALCALAY on page 2712 defines the word -- unclean creature; abomination and
adds (colloquial and jocular) a young devil (demon) (colloquial) shiksseh,
forbidden (non-Jewish) girl. 

In the Even-Shoshan Hebrew dictionary we find in vol. 4 ,page`1753 and I
translate 3.a popular derogatory term for an impetuous bad boy,casts off the
yoke of Torah and commandments and especially a lad from the non-Jewish youth
then follows the entry shiktza a popular name for a non-Jewish lass. 

Language experts say that in general words in the course of time deteriate or
take on negative conotations. In Yiddish I can think of two exceptions.  for
example the word mamzer from the Hebrew bastard. In the course of time it has
acquired a positive conotation -- someone off beat not like the run of the
mill. Also someone exceedingly clever,or bright has "a mamzersche kop" ( a
sharp mind)  The second example is shaygetz. Originally a very negative bad
even despicible goy (non-Jew)In Yiddish there is the positive popular phrase
a gute goy In the course of time shaygetz became an almost endearing name for
a Jewish youth with a mind of his own An independent soul.

Subject: goyte (goye)

Regarding David Hershkovic's comments on "goyte" being used for cleaning
ladies in England: The term is used here in Toronto too, in the same way (in
the Orthodox community, not specifically among Yiddish speakers), but the
word used here is "goye". I've never heard "goyte". 

Question for the linguists (Manaster Ramer? Mikhl Herzog?): Do different
communities often develop different suffixed versions in this way? Are -te
and -e both productive feminine suffixes that can legitimately be used for
<goy>?  What do other communities use?

Subject: Nokhamol "farplastern"

"Farplastern" indeed means "to put on a plaster". The verb may be of Slavonic
origin in Yiddish, cf. Russian "plastyr'". The noun "plaster"  can be found
in Rokkhind and Shklyar's Jewish [Yiddish]-Russian Dictionary (p. 424)
published by the Institute of Literature and Language of the Belorussian
Academy of Sciences in Minsk, 1940.

Subject: Kiftaln

Kiftaln -- correctly in Romanian chiftele -- are essentailly "Hamburgers,"
i.e., chopped beef fried in fat, sometimes served with a sauce.  The word can
be found throughout the old Ottoman empire in Turkish, Arabic, Greek, etc
(kofta, kefta, etc -- I don't know all te spellings and pronunciations).  In
the Austro-Hungarian sphere (Bukowina) they used to be kalled "Schnitzel"
(not Wiener-Schnitzel -- which are made from whole slices of beef or veal,
breaded with eggs).  This note almost made me hungry, although it is close to
midnight in San Francisco ...
