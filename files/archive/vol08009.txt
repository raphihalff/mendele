Subject: Polymer particle called "knedel"

Tayere Mendelyaner:

While I am pleased to see that Yiddish has entered the filed of chemistry, we
all ought not forget that chemistry has been a part of Yiddish for nearly a
century. Articles explaining chemical principles in Yiddish were in books
dating from the teens. Sol Feinstone's "Khemye" was published in 1920, and
numerous chemistry texts at the high-school and college level were printed in
the 1930s in the Soviet Union. And not only chemistry: physics, biology, and a
host of other "ologies" are well represented in Yiddish literature.
Technology has a strong grounding in Yiddish, and mathematics has been
published. 

This is a point which I have raised several times in the past: There are a
host of people debating linguistic and sociological issues in Yiddish prose
and poetry. Why is it that scientific literature is getting short shrift?
People complain about daytshme rish influences in many area of Yiddish, and
yet one of the biggest areas to study on this subject is the sciences,
particularly how the Americans and Soviets developed Yiddish scientific
terminolgy differently. 

Also related to this is the question raised a number of months ago about new
Yiddish authors, and where to publish such works (including a new Yiddish
chemsitry dictionary I have edited, containing about 4000 terms). I saw no
clear answers to my question. 
 
Am I to believe that there is NO publisher now extant who is willing to add to
Yiddish technological literature?

There are other Mendelists who are scientists on this forum. Are they not
interested in this subject?

Subject: Yiddish and chemistry

In regard to the subscriber who was happy that "yiddish has entered
chemistry,"  I'd like to remind her that Yiddish entered chemistry--and
chemistry entered Yiddish--many decades ago when Yiddish textbooks on
chemistry (and other school subjects) were written for the Yiddish dayschools
and the Yiddish equivalents of junior colleges in countries like Poland,
Romania, Soviet Union, etc.  Copies can be found at the YIVO, etc.....  And
you might also check out some of the Yiddish lexicons and other reference
works.....

Subject: swiss and yiddish

Am I to understand from A Manaster Ramer's comparison of swiss german and
swiss yiddish that when i overheard my gentile swiss friends speaking the
swiss dialect of their village, that my impression that they sounded as though
they were speaking a yiddish dialect was mistaken? is it possible that if it
wasn't similar to yiddish then at least it had a rhythm or feel of yiddish? it
was so long ago and my yiddish was so limited that i am left with the memory
of a conversation that, at least superficially, reminded me of the odessa
yiddish that i had heard at home in schenectady.

Subject: Usage notes on "shtaygn"

I received the following note from an e-mail khaver in response to my question
about a note of his in which he mentioned "a photo of [two great rabbis]
shtieging together." 

[Forwarded message]:

Thank you for your interest in the etymology of shtieging.

According to my research a steiger can be roughly translated as a "climber". 

In the circles where I learned in Yeshiva, the term was often used to imply
'getting into the deepest depths of learning, in order to climb to the highest
heights of torah" 

Thus to shtieg, would be to learn intensely/climb the ladder of Torah. 
Yisrael Yebrachiyahu-Bogoslavski, in his landmark study of the Yiddish
language, referred to Steigen as: "going up", "climb", "getting "high",
(hitrommemut), "going above and beyond". 

It is also often used as an euphemism for ambience, prevailing atmosphere,
encompassing environment, or a style of life. Thus, it could be said of
someone who devotes his/her life to Torah and Mitzvoth, yet does not go to
shul "The yiddeleh may not go to shul, but his whole steiger is Yiddishkeit".

Kindly inquire in the Toronto area, especially around chassidic/ultra
orthodox, ashkenazic yeshiva circles, and inquire on how they use the term.
Kindly share your findings. 

[End of quote]

I'm extending the research to the Mendele khevre.  Findings will be shared!

Subject: Shlemil

Nina Warnke's posting contains what to me is a (indeed, the)  most important
piece of information, namely, that Chamisso himself, in a letter to his
brother, Chamisso explained that "Schlemihl ... is the term Jews use for
clumsy or unhappy people." 

I had assumed that the Yiddish usage stemmed from Chamisso's work (i.e., that
he made up a character, gave him a perfectly innocent name and that the
current Yiddish usage arose from the associations with this character).  But
he is clearly saying that he took it from preexisiting German Yiddish usage. 
This is, if I am not mistaken, a new and important finding.  I would certainly
appreciate a complete reference to this letter.

Subject: Schlemiehl

So far I have read several wonderful and thorough postings on the subject of
Schlemiehl, but I want to focus on the one submitted by Joachim Neugroschel,
whose postings are always thorough and informative.  However, they are also
occasionally a rebuke as this one was to me when he ended with the statement
that "Leeson could find all this information in various dictionaries and other
reference works." 

Probably so, Mr. Neugroschel, but the topic still seems to me to be
appropriate for this list and I am sorry that you object to me posting what I
could probably have looked up.  And in any case, nowhere will I get such
insights as I do on Mendele. 

In addition Mr. Neugroschel suggested that I said that the word be pronounced
with an accent on the first and not the last syllable.  I am afraid that
either he did not read what I wrote carefully enough, or else I chose the
wrong word to describe the French accent (aigu) that appears on the name in
the libretto for Hoffmann. I know full well how the word is pronounced but was
merely talking about a diacritical mark not a stress symbol.  I used the word
"accent" and that could be interpreted incorrectly, but no one who has grown
up in a Yiddish environment would ever think of pronouncing it as "SCHLEmiel." 
                  
Mr. Neugroschel incorrectly states that the librettists for Hoffmann were
Meilhac and Halevi, though he does modify his statement by saying "if memory
serves me."  In fact, those two were the librettists for Carmen.  For Hoffman
the librettists were Jules and Pierre Barbier. 

But no matter who makes mistakes in submissions to this list, I don't think it
is anyone's business but the list manager to give the impression that the
material is unworthy for inclusion on the list and that the submitter would be
better off doing the research on his/her own.  I have fairly thick skin so I
don't care.  But some shy soul, trying out his or her basic Yiddish and
receiving such a rebuke would be off the list in 5 milliseconds.  That is not
what we are here for.

Subject: Source of Misinformation about Yiddish etc.

I have been killing time reading Rosten's books on Yiddish and Yinglish, and I
keep coming across some almost incredible blunders, such as the idea that mat
'checkmate' is of German (rather than Arabic) origin, that the 'th'
pronunciation of the Hebrew tav without a dagesh (Yiddish sof) was invented by
modern scholars, and so on.  Interestingly, some of the fantastic
"etymologies" we have had occasion to deal with here, such a Hebrew etymology
for Yiddish kurve, also occur there--and I wonder if this explains their
persistence.  Obviously, many more people have read Rosten on Yiddish than
have any direct experience of Yiddish linguistics, and his fantasies were of
course endorsed by any number of household names whose praise is reprtinted on
the back covers of his books.

Subject: Yiddish Names?

I am looking for a list of Yiddish first names as I prepare for the blessed
event.  Anyone know where to find one?  Hebrew lists abound, but Yiddish?

Thanks,
