Subject: Bim'kem, etc.

To understand the variations of these words, you have to understand a
little about the underlying Hebrew grammar, as well as how the Hebrew
pronunciations are faryidisht.

In Hebrew, there are two different words:

B'makOm (Mod. Hebrew) = in a place.  The Yiddish pronunciation is
bemOkem, following the usual rule the Hebrew accent is moved back one
syllable. Thus, Mikhl's example, BemOkem she-eyn ish....

BimkOm (Mod. Hebrew) = in (the) place of, instead of.  The Yiddish
pronunciation could be either bImkem, moving the accent back, or
bimkOYm, preserving the Hebrew accent pattern.  Could the latter be a
yeshivish pattern?  (Anyone know?)

Subject: Bi'mkem, Bimko'ym

[Zet: vols. 6.130, 6.132]

In addition to Reb Mikhl's evidence for b'mokoym in Yiddish, I wonder
whether "b'mokoym" would attract any notice from a Yiddish speaker who
is familiar with Hebrew and uses it regularly, but is not too clear on
the grammatical distinction between the Hebrew nominative ("nismakh")
and possessive ("somekh")--as many haymishe Yiddish speakers were and
are. Certainly it would not be considered a grade A mistake.  [I myself
am very aware of the distinction, but I don't think I am careful about
it (in Hebrew or Yiddish) in words where the distinction is only made in
the vowels (as opposed to brokhe/birkas, where there is a consonant
change), and I suspect many Hebrew speakers are equally lax, even native
ones.]

I suspect there is a general difference in usage, and especially in the
flexibilty of usage, between speakers for whom the Hebrew component in
Yiddish is a set of frozen, opaque borrowings from a language they have
little to do with, and speakers for whom those words are linked to
another language which they encounter every day, and which resonates in
the background when those borrowings are used.  (Think of the difference
for English speakers on Mendele between the English words "pajama" and
"kosher"--both are borrowings, but one carries baggage that the other
doesn't.)
