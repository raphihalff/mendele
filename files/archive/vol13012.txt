Subject: Glikl's language

In Vol. 13.011 Enrique Gildemeister asked for literature on Glikl's
language.

For a long period, the standard work on Glikl's language was A. Landau's
article "Die Sprache der Memoiren GlÅckels von Hameln", Mitteilungen der
Gesellschaft fÅr jÅdische Volkskunde VII/1 [1901], p. 20-66.

In recent years, there have been a number of additions, most notably:

Erika Timm, "Glickls Sprache vor ihrem sozialhistorischen und geographischen
Hintergrund." In: Monika Richarz, ed., Die Hamburger Kauffrau Glikl.
JÅdische Existenz in der frÅhen Neuzeit, Hamburg: Christians Verlag 2001, p.
49-67.

Israela Klayman-Cohen, Die hebrÑische Komponente im Westjiddischen am
Beispiel der Memoiren der GlÅckel von Hameln, Hamburg: Buske 1994.

Subject: Soviet Yiddish Press, 1942-45

People interested in Yiddish in the former Soviet Union should see the
important article, with accompanying bibliographic lists of hundreds of
individual articles by author, title and topic, written by Dov-Ber Kerler,
"The Soviet Yiddish Press: During the War, 1942--1945," 30 pp., published in

Shapiro, Robert M., ed., _Why Didn't the Press Shout?: American and
International Journalism during the Holocaust_ (New York City and Jersey
City: Yeshiva University Press with KTAV Publishing House, 2003), pp. xx,
665, ISBN 088125-775-3, $49.95.

The book consists of 30 chapters dealing with the press during the Holocaust
in more than a dozen countries and more than a dozen languages. It was named
a Finalist for a National Jewish Book Award. The volume is dedicated to the
late historian, Lucjan Dobroszycki.

Subject: Re: vos heyst 'a mentsh'?

The three answers to the question "vos heyst a mentsh" all assert as clearly
as possible that the word implies in a human being (one, even in a dog,
r"ltz) integrity and praiseworthiness, if not actual nobility.

How then does one explain Sholem Aleichem's use of the word in "A Mensh Fun
Buenos Aires"? The "mentsh" referred to is a procurer, for whatever my
opinion is worth, about the lowest form of humanity, in what used to be
called the white slave traffic. This is obviously not Sholem Aleichem's
intended meaning; by "mentsh" he means simply a person. It is notable,
however, that the usual word for person in Yiddish is "yid" (with the
obvious exceptions) and that Sholem Aleichem nowhere in his story uses that
word to describe his subject, giving "mentsh" a neutral meaning as it were.
The procurer refers to himself as a mentsh, but his meaning is also clear: a
person of consequence, far superior to the misery from which he arose as a
child.

Outside my home, Yiddish is the language I speak most, because I live in a
place where it is still  widely spoken and, of course, because I love it. To
me, "mentsh" means in some contexts simply a person but in most contexts a
"real" person. A yid I know just went through several months of declining
health into a state of emese sakonos nefoshos and was miraculously pulled
out of it by the latest development in pacemakers, implanted only a week or
so ago. His current comment is,  "Before, I felt like" (and in fact was), "a
soon-to-be customer for the khevre kadisha, but now I feel like a mentsh!"

I do understand that the entire discussion in Mendele referred to its use in
English, but felt that its use in Yiddish, whence it comes, ought also to be
clarified.

Subject: Searching for music of the Jewish labor movement

Trying to see what recorded musical material is available that is related to
the historic, multifaceted, Jewish labor movement in one way or another.

Does anyone know if it is still possible to secure a copy of the LP record,
"Yiddish Sons of Work and Struggle," released in the 1970s by the Jewish
Students' Bund in NY? Saw mention of it on website:
http://campuscgi.princeton.edu/~klez/zemerl/show.pl?title=Brider%2c+mir+hobn+geshlosn

I've already learned of the more-recent CD, "In Love and Struggle: The
Musical Legacy of the Jewish Labor Bund," recorded July 1998 by The New
Yiddish Chorale and the Workmen's Circle Chorus, mentioned on
website:http://www.jhom.com/personalities/ansky/the_oath.htm

and Zahava Seewald and Psanim's "Ashkenaz songs 2: work and revolution," sub
rosa, Brussels 1999, mentioned on website:
http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/int/shvue/shvue.htm

Any assistance would be deeply appreciated.

Thanks!

Arieh Lebowitz
