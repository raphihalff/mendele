Subject: Zellig Bach
 
It is with a deep sense of loss that I report I have received a note from
Zellig Bach's step-daughter stating that "Zellig passed away peacefully
during the summer, and my mother chose to take no more food or drink two and
a half weeks after his death. She, too, passed away peacefully with no pain
or discomfort."

She has asked that I extend her thanks in his name to those Mendelists that
continued to write to him until the end of his days.

Zellig was one of Mendele's brightest stars, sharing his bottomless
knowledgeability in Yiddish language, culture, and literature. His added
degrees in psychology deepened the broad insights he offered us so freely.
His generosity extended beyond the printed words he bestowed upon us; he
frequently telephoned many Mendelists that he befriended, and sent them
books and articles and cards and gifts.

May we honor him with remembrances of his knowledge, charm, and generosity.

[Moderator's note: Zellig Bach's memoir "A Child's Longing for Home" is
available at the Shtetl's library (http://ibiblio.org/yiddish/Book/Bach)]

Subject: Yiddish Dictionary

As former board chairman of the Great Dictionary of the Yiddish Language, I
regard it as an obligation to respond to the inquiry on the fate of the
dictionary which appeared recently on Mendele.

Since publication of the first volume in 1961, three more were produced, the
last in 1980.  The four folio volumes include some 80,000 entries, all of
them beginning with the letter Aleph, representing a third of the projected
publication.  The disproportion can be explained by the unique
characteristic of Yiddish where nearly all prefixes begin with the letter
Aleph, in contrast to other languages.

In a Yiddish article which appeared in 1980, I expressed a pessimistic view
on the possibility of further volumes , hoping at the same time that I turn
out to be a false prophet.  20 years later, I regret to report, that there
is little on the horizon to indicate that I was wrong. The official reason
is lack of funds.  This is hardly plausible since the Hebrew University,
copyright holder for the last two decades, has succeeded in financing other
Yiddish projects of lesser significance. The real reason is with respect to
the very character of subsequent volumes, of which volume five, has been
just about ready for publication for over a decade. Assistant editor Hebrew
University Professor Wolf Moskovitz is in possession of all the material
accumulated during the life and after the demise of the editor in chief, the
late Yudel Mark. The major issue is orthography.

The facts are as follows:  Early in 1959 the editorial board conducted a
survey among Yiddish writers, linguists, teachers, publishers, editors,
printers and leaders of Yiddish cultural agencies on the question of
adopting the changes in Yiddish orthography introduced by YIVO in 1936.  Of
177 responses, over 90% responded in the negative and sanctioned the right
of the editors to follow the standard spelling of contemporary Yiddish
writers, the daily Yiddish press (that still existed at that time) and the
Yiddish school system. In compliance with the request of YIVO, the first
volume printed a statement by YIVO disclaimed any responsibility or
sponsorship.

After the Trustees of the Yiddish Dictionary transferred the project to the
Hebrew University, the new Board decided to make major changes in subsequent
volumes, chief among them being the adoption of YIVO spelling. Many
identified with Yiddish, regard such a radical operation on the life work of
its editor, Yudl Mark, as immoral, which in addition, would also reflect
negatively on his scholarship and academic stature.. This position has been
clearly stated on a number of occasions in print as well as in a
communication directed to the present acting editor. Fearing that plastic
surgery on the existing dictionary will evoke a wave of criticism in Israel
and abroad, the present solution appears to be -- keeping the project in
deep freeze. .Nevertheless, no one will question the right of the Trustees
to produce a new dictionary disconnected from Mark's work.

The full story is available in articles that appeared in the Yiddish press.
There is also a chapter on the subject in English in a book presently being
prepared for publication.

Subject: John Glassco Prize for translation

I would like to inform all Mendelyaner that Chava Rosenfarb has just won the
John Glassco Prize for Literary Translation for her two novels Bociany and
Of Lodz and Love (Syracuse University Press, 2000.) This is the first time
this award has been given for a translation from Yiddish.  The John Glassco
Prize is awarded annually by the Literary Translators Association of Canada
for a book-length translation from any language into either French or
English.  Bociany and Of Lodz and Love are Rosenfarb's first published
translations of her own work.

Subject: Yiddish words/calques in English

I am addressing the list as a dictionary etymologist whose knowledge of
Yiddish barely extends beyond rudimentary acquaintance with the writing
system and phonetics, and I have no easy access to Yiddish references beyond
Weinreich's dictionary.  I have hopes that the Mengele readership,
particularly those with linguistic training, can help with some etymologies,
to wit:

English <bubkes>, <bupkes>, "the least amount" (as a negative polarity item,
e.g., "they won't win bubkes this year"), or "nothing"  (she received bubkes
at nomination time").  Is the word used in the same type of constructions in
Yiddish?  I assume that <bobke>/<bubke> is one of the many possible
diminutives of <bob/<bub>, "bean" in Yiddish, but should the word be taken
as a simple diminutive in this usage, or does it have other meanings that
might be relevant?  I note that Polish <bobki> is used for sheep or goat
droppings.  Does the Yiddish word also have this sense?  Lastly, note, for
whatever it's worth, that the American English idiom "he doesn't know beans"
= "he doesn't know anything" is attested continuously from the 1830's and is
unlikely to have any immediate connection with Yiddish.

English <kasha varnishke>, "a dish containing buckwheat groats and
rectangular or bow-tie-shaped noodles."  The word <kasha> and its various
possible Slavic sources are transparent, but <varnishke> leaves me at a
loss.  I presume <varnishke>, if really a Yiddish word, has some relation to
<varenik>, "cheese or jam filled dumpling" in Weinreich (again, obviously of
Slavic origin), or is this simply a red herring?  The definition given fits
my recollection of the dish in 1980's Manhattan delis, but were "varnishke"  
originally noodles?  And lastly, what is the relation of the two words?  Is
this simply a conjunctionless dvandva compound, or does one word modify the
other in some way?

English <know from>, "to have knowledge/some discernment of"  (very
approximately), usually though not invariably in negatives and questions
("Yes, and the Persians [in 1961] made carpets.  They stuck, I mean, to
their knitting and didn't go hitting on hostages.  Who knew from Iran? Who
knew from Iraq?"  "A baby who is breastfed for a year gets all those
fabulous enzymes and antibodies whether his mother is doing it for him or
because it allows her to boast...The kid doesn't know form motive; he just
drinks the milk.").  I have certainly heard this from adults who grew up in
bilingual, i.e., Yiddish-English speaking households, and I have long
assumed it is a calque of a corresponding Yiddish expression?  Is that true?  
Exactly what is the counterpart in Yiddish?

Any and all help on these matters would be greatly appreciated.

Jim Rader

Subject: Grine Medine

Yiddish in the Netherlands.

The first issue of a new Yiddish quarterly magazine appeared last September.
Holland is a country with a extremely high number of periodicals, but the
"Grine Medine, magazine for "lovers of the Yiddish language" is the first of
its kind.

It is an initiative of the "Stichting Yiddish", a foundation recently
established to stimulate and develop activities in the field of Yiddish
language and culture. Donors of the foundation receive the magazine after
donating a minimum of Fl. 50 per year. Single issues sell for fl. 12.50.

According to the introduction the magazine expects a readership of fifty to
one hundred readers, including people who know Yiddish, people who are
learning Yiddish and people interested in Yiddish

The contents: The first issue has 20 pages in all, of which six are in
Yiddish and one in transcription, the rest are in Dutch.

Two of the articles have the Mendele list as their subject. Hanna Luden
explains what the list is and how to find it on the Internet, Fred
Borensztajn quotes letters of introduction by Mendele subscribers from
before 1995. The Mendele Review, however is, strangely enough, not mentioned
at all.

The first item in transcribed Yiddish is a fragment from I.J. Singer's "fun
a velt vos iz nishto mer", called "A froeme kats, wos hot liber tsoe hern
toire wi chapn maiz...". Unfortunately the transcription is made in an
unknown 'Dutch system'for which the editors fail to provide a key and not in
SYR.

Next there is a fragment from Melekh Ravitsh' "dos mayse-bukh fun mayn
lebn", called "di varshever yidishe ganeyvim z"l". This fragment is given
both in Yiddish and in the Dutch translation of Fred Borenztajn.

Further we are presented with a short article by the Dutch translator Willy
Brill on Sholem Aleykhem, with the writers impressions of his visit to the
8th Zionist congress in The Hague in 1907, in Dutch andYiddish.

Next an article by Ariane Zwiers on the poet Lev Berinski, with two of his
poems in Yiddish and in Dutch translation.

Finally several items by Willy Brill, in Yiddish and in transcription,
notably a poem by E. Shteynbarg "vu iz yoysher", in Yiddish and in Dutch
translation.

Interesting is an article in Dutch by Riety van Luit, announcing a project
of the University of Amsterdam in cooperation with the Menasse ben Israel
Institute. An inventarisation will be made of all Yiddish materials of Dutch
origin.

Since all Dutch Yiddishist can be expected to have a good knowledge of the
English language, one might wonder whether a Dutch publication for 50-100
subscribers is useful. Why not join an existing magazine? The introduction
of yet another system for romanization is most regrettable.

Lucas Bruyn.

Subject: New Publication: The Shtetl: Image and Reality

TITLE: The Shtetl: Image and Reality: Papers of the Second Mendel Friedman
International Conference on Yiddish

EDITORS: Gennady Estraikh and Mikhail Krutikov

DESCRIPTION: It is not possible to conduct studies of Yiddish culture and
society, without a firm understanding of the concept of 'Shtetl'.  A Yiddish
word meaning small town or village, the 'Shtetl' has housed the development
of the Jewish Diaspora in Eastern Europe throughout the past several hundred
years.  This book fully explores the concept of the 'Shtetl' from the false
images constructed in popular works such as Fiddler on the Roof to the
adoration it invoked in young Americans searching for an identity after
World War II. Contents: The Shtetl as imagined community (David G Roskies);  
What exactly was a Shtetl? (John D Klier); The Podolian Shtetl as
architectural phenomenon (Alla Sokolova); Jewish art between yidishkayt and
civilization (Hillel Kazovsky); Berdichev in Russian Jewish literary
imagination: From Israel Aksenfeld to Friedrich Gorenshtein (Mikhail
Krutikov); Shtetl Kuzmir: The reality of the image (Dafna Clifford); Soviet
and Kosher in the Ukrainian Shtetl (Anna Shternshis); The Shtetl theme in
Sovetish heymland (Gennady Estraikh); Immigrants mourning for a world lost
(Moises Kijak).

Subject: New book: "Oyf Fremder Erd"

Some of you know that I have been working on a translation of "Oyf Fremder
Erd", the memoirs of Falk Zolf. Well, I'm happy to announce that the book is
now in the hands of the printers. It's an unusual translation because it
starts in English and gradually incorporates more and more Yiddish, until at
the end it's almost all Yiddish. I think it's a really good way to teach
yourself Yiddish.

I hope you will go to my website (http://www.onforeignsoil.com), where you
can see a complete English translation. It's a fascinating story that takes
you from Zolf's childhood in turn-of-the-century Russian, through the First
World War up to the eve of the Revolution. Volume II, which I hope to
publish next year, covers the time period from the revolution until Zolf's
arrival in Canada in the year 1926.

Naturally, I'm very excited about making this book available to the public.
I can use all the help I can get. Right now, for example, I am having a very
hard time getting my site to show up in search engines. If anyone has a
website where they would be willing to put a link to mine, it would be very
much appreciated. I am also looking for help in getting reviews published in
the Jewish press.

Regards,
Martin Green

Subject: Memoir of Jewish Lodz, the Warsaw Ghetto and the Polish Uprising

Dear fellow Mendelyaner,

Some of you may be interested in this 180p book by a retired lawyer (my
uncle) who was a youth leader in Herzliya in Lodz in the thirties. It was
well reviewed upon publication in Warsaw in Polish 6 years ago and is now
available in English ($US 15) from its editor (me). A personal account of
the Warsaw Ghetto poet Wladyslaw Szlengel is of unique interest, and there
is a detailed personal account of the barriers to Jews' becoming lawyers in
pre-War Poland. "My Fortunate Life" by Szymon Rogozinski (Moje Szczesliwe
Zycie). Please email firefly@webrider.net.au if you would like a copy. And
if you know what other groups on the Net might be interested please do let
me know.
                
A Hartsikn Dank,
