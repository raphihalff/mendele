Sholom aleichem,
     Here's the bio you asked for. I was born in Brook-
lyn, studied physics at Rutgers ('80) and comp. sci. at
NYU ('84). I work for NASA at Goddard Space Flight
Center and am also going for an MS in Applied Physics
at Johns Hopkins. I'm married and have a six-year-old
son. In my spare time (HA!) I'm trying to learn some
Yiddish. Right now I know about as much as your average
Brooklyn-born Jew whose grandparents generally speak in
Yiddish only when trying to conceal a "shonda". (This
alone is good motivation for learning.) I'm working
with the materials I have been able to find, which
include the Yiddish/30 tapes, a miniature Berlitz
phrasebook and an old primer for Yiddish-speaking
children, both of which I dug out of a dusty corner in
a used bookstore. Anybody have a used copy of "College
Yiddish" they could sell me, or can tell me how to
order one new? Thanks,

Sherri

Subject: Mendele fort avek

With this number Mendele is going off the air for a
month.  Maybe by next year we'll have grown enough to
merit a Listserv account which can then be moderated by
someone else when necessary.  For now, I apologize for
the inconvenience.

So that a Yiddish word should not be entirely lacking
from your lives, I have two suggestions.  The first,
for those of you who aren't already members, is to join
Dave Sherman's mail.yiddish list.  It's the original
and it deserves everyone's support.  Write to:

dave@lsuc.on.ca

The second suggestion is to set yourselves an August
project, the results of which can be posted when
Mendele reopens on September 5.  Four possibilities out
of many: translate something; do a bit of litcrit
(e.g.Singer's debt to Gogol) or sociology of art (e.g.
what happened to Sholem Asch's reputation?); make up a
list of particularly salty Yiddish phrases.

In khoydesh Nisan hof ikh az mir veln zikh ale nokhamol
trefn.  Zayt mir gezunt.

Noyekh
