Subject: Rozhinkes mit mandlen

sophia adler (6.163) mentions that her grandfather was a traveling
merchant who dealt in dried fruits, nuts, tea, and spices.

she or some other mendelist must know the answer to something i've
wondered about for years -- where all those delicacies that our parents
etc were eating in eastern europe came from?!? until i met my husband
(who's from egypt), i actually thought that halvah and 'turkish delight'
and pistachios and dried dates and figs etc were eastern european foods,
like borscht or blintzes or pickled herring! imagine my surprise when i
learned that they were middle eastern. :)

where did sophia's grandfather get his wares from? turkey? how did the
procuring and distribution of these goodies work? did each locale make
its own 'runs' -- or were there very large importers, say in romania,
that the others bought their stuff from?

one other related question: the women in my mother's family (originally
from poland) used paprika and white pepper, never black pepper; the
women in my father's family (carpato-rus) used paprika only, so far as i
know. was this simply their idiosyncrasy, or was black pepper not
available? thanks again. (i've made myself hungry with these questions
and will now go hit that box of superb dried fruits from zabar's that a
very kind romanian (gentile) friend recently sent us. oink, oink... ;) )

Subject: Black English and Yiddish

aren portnoy asks [6.166] if black english is analogous to yiddish. my
opinion is yes and no.

yes: i think the situation is analogous primarily in that in both cases
we have a geographically discontiguous speech community -- the people
who made up the eastern yiddish speech community were spread out all
over eastern europe, separated by linguistic communities that
outnumbered them but still forming a linguistic whole and clearly
communicating more with one another than with geographically closer
out-group members, and the people who make up the black english speech
community are likewise spread out across the country, separated by...etc
etc. they are also similar in terms of stigmatization, both from within
their own speech community and from outside. (that is, just as many
yiddish speakers and non-yiddish speakers thought/think that yiddish is
'bad german', many black english speakers and non-black english speakers
think that black english is 'bad english'. and it goes without saying
that in each case this evaluation is indefensible on linguistic grounds
and derives entirely from non-linguistic issues re the social prestige
of the speakers within the larger community.)

no: what i believe is different is that, at this point in time, yiddish
is clearly a separate language from its closest relative (modern german)
while, in my opinion, black english is still simply a dialect of
american english. this is also the opinion of someone who knows much
more about it than i do, an eminent linguist, creolist, and africanist,
salikoko mufwene at the univ of chicago, who considers that the only
black variety of american english to have attained 'separate language'
status is gullah, a creole language spoken by a black community on an
island off the coast of north (?) carolina. however, i would bet that
ANY linguist would predict that, if current socioeconomic trends
continue, black english will evolve into a separate language -- perhaps
what we have now is the analog of medieval judeo-german, en route to
evolving into the analog of yiddish if ghettoization/segregation
continues. (of course, the distinction between 'language' and 'dialect'
is a difficult one and max weinreich said it best: 'a language is a
dialect with an army and navy.' i am using the terms language/dialect in
the linguist's sense of whether or not they are mutually intelligible,
more or less...)

fwiw, my understanding of the oakland decision is not that it will bring
in money so that they can teach *black english* -- it's that it will
bring in money earmarked for students whose first language is not
english, to provide extra instruction and resources for _other_ things.
i would also hope it would provide instruction to the *teachers* of
those students, so that they may have a more enlightened view of what it
is that their pupils speak. if that is correct, then i for one am all
for it, in spite of my not believing that black english is technically a
separate language (yet).

Subject: Prokofiev's "Overture on Hebrew Themes"

Dan Leeson of Los Altos, CA writes (Vol 6.l66) that the melodies in the
Prokofiev Overture on Hebrew Themes, Opus 34,  are composed. Concerning
one of the melodies, I believe he is in error.  The theme is from the
folksong "Zayt Gezunterheyt," in which a bride bids farewell to her
parents. The text was published by S. Ginsburg and P. Marek in l90l,
words and music in l909 by Joel Engel and in l9ll by Z. Kisselgof.  The
song is in our anthology "Pearls of Yiddish Song" on page l02, where we
added that Abraham M. Bernstein, who included this melody in his
"Muzikalisher pinkes" (l927) wrote  that "klezmorim played this melody
at the end of the wedding when the in-laws would bid farewell and the
mood was melancholy.  Later, the melody changed to a happy one."  We
can't say for certain whether the wedding melody came before the song,
or vice versa.  This is one of the melodies that Bellison gave to
Prokofiev during the latter's visit to this country in l9l9.

Subject: Prokofiev's Yiddish Music

Dan Leeson is of the belief that the melodies used by Prokofiev in his
Overture on Hebrew Themes are composed rather than folk. This is not the
case, at least for some of them... and probably for all of them. I was
informed that the composer was living in NYC, rooming with Boris
Thomashevsky at the time he wrote that piece and that he learned the
Yiddish songs from that great Yiddish Thespian. In fact the principal and
most moving theme of the Prokofiev work is easily recognized to be the
song "Zay zhe dir gesint mayne tayer eltern". Perhaps other Mendelniks can
identify some of the other songs which he employs.
