Subject: A garland of Slavic words in Yiddish

In connection with several posts about the influences of Slavic
languages on Yiddish, herewith a _krentsl_ [garland] of a very small
number of selected Slavisms in Yiddish.

Note especially the consonantal soft sound combinations:

Pitshevke [particular detail], shtshav [sorrel], vetshere [supper],
yungatsh [rascal], zhaleven [spare], and the palatal "soft" consonants
such as in MoTye (famous saying "nit by MoTyen," you cannot fool me),
stoLyer [carpenter], zuneNyu [dear son (when still a baby, young
child)].

Other words or word structures:  Abi [only] (as in "abi gezunt!"),
vedlik [according to], tamevate [na'ive person].

The verb _ot'khAyen_ might be of special interest:  Prefix "ot" slavik,
"khayen" Hebrew, from "khay" [to live, gelebt (as in "am Yisroel khay").
"Ot'khAyen" means to bring a person who just fainted back to life.

Subject: Rusalke

Rusalka appears in Polish, too; 'a lady of the lake' or/and of the
forest. I think she is to be found, among others, in Adam Mickiewicz's
Ballads and Romances.

Subject: Mendele 'un a bisele haynt'

Noyekh (in Vol 6.148) forges forward to touch at  issues of eyniklekh un
ureyniklekh which is the penultimate, if not the ultimate (for some of
us), issue involved in our interest, motivation, and enjoyment of
Mendele as Yidishistn, lovers of Yiddish who work in some way to
perpetuate it.

Our shames' posting appeared soon after I presented a book review of
Carol Shields "Stone Diaries" (deserving of its Pulitzer) within which
the grandfather creates a time capsule for his family, calling upon the
children and grandchildren to submit an item of importance (a definition
of themselves?) to be buried beneath a stone tower of tribute he has
sculpted.

The two items so woven together gave me pause to wonder if we Mendelniks
set aside one day (like December 31,  which feels like a marker) to
submit a posting that we wished to define us; to describe an item we
would want to leave;  to declare what we would want most to "hand down"
to future generations, in keeping with Eric Ericson's generativity
concept; to be a valuable addition to the Shulkhan Arukh that Noyekh
talks of.

Such a "time capsule" created by the wonder of the people that make up
Mendele would be something to cherish, and to pass on today, while we
are still here.

Subject: Walter Scott in Yiddish

With reference to David Lidsky's query in Vol6.144, and Iosif Vaisman's
reply in Vol6.146, one can reasonably claim that there has been
significant interest in Scott in Yiddish.  However, only a thorough
index of Yiddish literary periodicals would corroborate this estimate.

There is _Ivanhoe_ translated by Balbine Klatshke (Warsaw:  Aleksander
Ginz {printer}, 1879, Parts 1-4:  78, 82, 74, 94 pp.  Copies are to be
found at Yivo, the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress and
other libraries.  Ben-Tsien Benedikt adapted _Ivanhoe_ to the stage in
_Oto da-fe oder rebeka di 18-yerike makhsheyfe_, drama in 5 aktn un 12
bildn, Odessa, 1882, 88 pp.  There is a copy at the New York Public
Library of this scarce item.  There are two Scott works which merited
translators of proved literary ability.  The first is _Der shvartser
riter_ ('The Black Knight') translated by the well known writer Lamed
Shapiro (Bikher far ale, 1911, 362 pp.).  Yivo and the Library of
Congress have copies.  And the second is _Ivanhoe_ Yiddished by the
Soviet poet and translator Moyshe Tayf (Minsk, 1937, 413 pp.)  There is
a copy at the New York Public Library.  This is probably not a scarce
item, but it is surprising how difficult it often is to locate materials
published in the Soviet Union in the 1930s.  If you own such items,
prize them!
