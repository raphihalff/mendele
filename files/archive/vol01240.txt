Well, one thing I have plenty of is Yiddish songbooks.
Shvartse Karshelekh ("Black Cherries") can be found on page
26 of "Favorite Yiddish Songs / Mir Trogn a Gezang",
compiled by Eleanor Gordon Mlotek, published by Adama Books
for the Workmen's Circle in 1972. (It's found in Judaica
stores and is also available from the Workmen's Circle in
NYC.)

"Folk song, parts of which were published by Y.L. Cahan in
1912; a similar version was published by M. Gelbart in
1938. The stanza about black cherries was traced to the
16th century by the folklorist Y.L. Cahan.  It is also part
of a children's song that was once a love song: "Kumt der
liber zumer shpiln mir in zamd" (When summer comes, we play
in the sand)."

Shvartse karshelekh rayst men,
Un grine lozt men shteyn
Sheyne meydelekh nemt men
Un miese lozt men geyn

CHORUS:
Oy, vey iz tsu mir,
Un vey tsu mayne por yor,
A libe hob ikh gefirt
Felike dray fertl yor.

Vos toyg mir di polke mazurke,
Az tansn tants ikh zi nit,
Vos toyg mir dos meydele fun vurke
Az libn libt zi mikh nit.

Vos toyg mir der nayer valets
Az tantsn tants ikh im nisht,
Vos toyg mir dos meydele fun shilets,
Az libn libt zi mikh nisht.

Transcribed as it appears: I guess the stanzas are from
different sources, given the forms of nit/nisht that
appear. If I'm not mistaken, the sequence that begins "Oy,
vey iz tsu mir..." is familiar outside Yiddish song.  I
have it in a piano book as part of the "Mexican Hat Dance".
It was also used in a TV commercial years ago for Frito's
corn chips ("I'm the Frito Bandido").

To Professor van der Auwere:

Thanks for your query and forgive the delayed response.
There was a transmission error.  The book costs $19.95 plus
postage and handling ($2.00, I believe).

Subject: Vilne

I was delighted to learn that Vilne, one of four Yiddish
fonts I adapted (with permission) from acquired models, is
alive and well and living in Toronto. (It is, alas, better
travelled than I.)

Vilne--as well as its companion font, Kovne--are based upon
the Hebrew font distributed with the old Mac in Hebrew
init/da; Vilne strips the Mac in Hebrew-specific encoding
while Kovne retains the right-to-left encoding unique to
Mac in Hebrew.  Mac in Hebrew is/was shareware, with a fee
payable, if memory serves, to the Cambridge (MA) Hillel
Foundation; Vilne and Kovne are themselves in the public
domain, though I credit myself in the GetInfo box.  Perhaps
regular users of Vilne and/or Kovne should pay the Mac in
Hebrew shareware fee, or a portion thereof, to the original
distributor of Mac in Hebrew?  For my part, I gave copies
of the fonts to several registered users of Mac in Hebrew,
and never posted them to the public, but am gratified that
they have found their way to Donyel-Moyshe.

Flatbush and CrownHts are quite another matter: these are
adaptations of Dovid Katz's eccentric but (to my mind, at
least) very attractive Yiddish fonts, reassigned key
positions and retrofitted with Yivo- standard graphemics.
We use these here at Ohio State with Dovid Katz's
permission, but they are absolutely not for distribution.
Should anyone have come by a copy of Flatbush or CrownHts,
I would beg him or her to send me a private message.

I would welcome greater elaboration by users of Hebrew
Nisus: are all standard Yiddish graphemics present? is the
keyboard mappable to place Yiddish letters where the user
wants them to be? can the supplied fonts be edited (by,
say, Fontastic Plus, Fontographer, ResEdit, or whatever)?

Eli Katz writes:

Without in the least questioning the authenticity of the
Chagall story, I'll point out that it's an exemplar of a
folklore type (not necessarily catalogued).  The version
that I heard (at least 35 years ago) tells that Gorky and
Chaliapin grew up together in Nizhni Novgorod.  They both
auditioned for the cathedral choir. Gorki was accepted;
Chaliapin was not.

****************

Life is stranger than folklore, in my experience. Here is
an advanced version of the same myth, and I was one of the
actors.  [Incidently the other character in this story was
a colleague of Martin Davis, who is now active on this list
and whose name I have not heard these 40 years.]

In Stuyvesant High School [1943] I was touted to be the
mathematician of the class while a Jacob Schwartz was the
chemist.  In the chemistry regents, Schwartz blew it,
getting only a 98; he had used a slide rule, a tool too
erudite for the rest of us, and gotten the wrong answer.
Although I went on to be the captain of the high school
math team [sic!], Schwartz became a famous mathemetician
who worked together with Martin Davis at NYU.  I never went
into math.  [I got the 100 in the chemistry regents, though
[no slide rule] and went into medicine and biology which is
a bit closer to chemistry, I guess.]
