Subject: Yiddish words for Christmas

1. Back in January-February several people were good enogh to reply to a
question concerning _blinde nakht_, one of a number of Yiddish words for
Christmas. I have a record of replies from Bob Rothstein and Eli Katz,
but I've lost track of a reply from a third person who pointed out the
similarity in the (Belorusian? Ukrainian?) words _sviat_ 'holy' and
_sviet_ 'light'. Will that person be good enough to identify him/herself?

2. In the same context, can someone identify the origin of the word
_drishtsOne_?

Subject: Weinreich's _History of the Yiddish Language_

In his erudite essay , Mikhl Herzog wrote:

In his erudite essay, "Origins of Yiddish" (5.065), Mikhl Herzog writes
that the prospect of publishing a translation of the remaining two
volumes of of Weinreich's _History of the Yiddish Language_  "is very
slim indeed".

I have good news for Mikhl Herzog, the Mendele khavruse, and all lovers
of Yiddish:  Contrary to Mikhl's pessimistic view, I am happy to state
that the necessary funds for this specific purpose have finally been
secured.

As a matter of fact the preparatory work for this publication will start
in New  York  within  the  next  few  weeks, and Dr. Jeffrey Shandler, a
very competent researcher, has already been engaged as an initial step in
this undertaking.

Much spade work is still to be done, however, for instance, renumbering
paragraphs and notes to correspond with the original Nos. in the first
two volumes.  Also some style editing.

The English translation of the first two volumes was done by Dr. Shlomo
Noble with the assistance of Dr. Joshua A. Fishman.  The last two volumes
were translated by the late Dr. Noble alone.  It is hoped that Dr.
Fishman (who now lives in Palo Alto, California) will be able to lend a
hand in finalizing the last stages of preparing the second part of
Weinreich's magnum opus for publication.

It is also hoped that Dr. Bella Haas Weinberg will again do the indexing
of the current translation as the excellent and admirable index she did
of the translation of the first two volumes.

Subject: Simcha bunim; gebrokhts

In response to Helen Abeles' queries:

Bunim sounds like the Yiddish (Ashkenazic) pronunciation of the Hebrew
banim (sons). The juxtaposition of Simchah and Bunim may derive from the
verse in Psalms (end of first chapter of the Hallel): moshivi akeret
ha-bayit em ha-banim semekhah halleluyah. [this is just a guess and may
be entirely wrong]

Re gebrokhts: is this possibly a form of gebroks, the term used for
crumbled matzah, which is forbidden by strictly observant Jews to be put
in soup on the first nights of Peysakh for fear that it might ferment?

Subject: Shepn/shlepn nakhes

I think Dovid Braun's strong puristic views [5.055] (that shlepn nakhes
can not be correct in any decent (adult) dialect of Yiddish () can be
questioned - from the data sent in by Mendelniks (my own - far from
authoritative - experience: I have heard - and  seen - nothing but
shepn). A possible analogous example from English: when I was a child
dragonflies were called 'dining needles'. 'Dining' obviously 'doesn't
make sense'; the word should be - and I was, years later, instructed that
it was 'darning needle'. Both 'dine' and darn' (like shlepn and shepn)
occurred in that dialect, 'darn' somewhat semantically leeched.

The question is - I don't know the answer - whether 'dining needle' was
strictly a child's form, and related to this (and more interesting) what
correlation is there, if any, between literacy and an (acceptable) real
adult dialect of Yiddish. Are there - or were there - 'illiterate
dialects' (not illiterate speakers) of Yiddish,these  dialects being
(somewhat) isolated from other dialects ? What are the limits on the
dimensions (demographic/geographic/sociolinguistic) of an 'acceptable'
dialect ? If the 'dining needle' example is flawed (in that 'dining
needle was used only by children) I think unflawed examples can be
adduced. I can't think of one now.

Subject: Rashi vs The Rambam

In response to Michael Shimshoni's note [5.063] about the presence of
"the" with The Rambam, but its absence in Rashi:

I think that names can get canonized in one way or another in certain
(sociolinguistic?) circles.  I am 3rd/4th generation Los Angeles.  All
the freeways get a "the":   To get to UCLA from parts of Orange County,
you take "the 5 to the 10 over to the 405."  In Columbus, this same
LA-speaker gives local directions:  "You take 70 to 270 to 315..."  When
in Columbus, however, and referring to the LA freeways, I'll still always
use the "the".

Similarly, the presence/absence in:  Smokey _the_ Bear  or Billy _the_
Kid vs. Peter Rabbit, Donald Duck, Porky Pig.  Note that it doesn't seem
to be phonological, i.e., one-syllable versus polysyllabic "Last Name":
Porky Pig vs. Winnie The Pooh.  There do seem to be "classes" of
individuals which require the "the", like Kings:  "Peter the Great",
"Ivan the Terrible", etc. However, with cartoon characters it can go
either way, as seen with Porky Pig, Mickey Mouse  vs.  Winnie The Pooh,
Felix The Cat.  My intuition is that when referring to Babe Ruth, people
(in the 1920s/1930s) said:  "The Babe", whereas while addressing him, the
said "Babe..."  (cf., lehavdl,  Yiddish "di bobe" 'grandmother', a noun,
vs.  "Bobe"-- the proper name 'Grandma', or reference-form for TV's "The
Fonz"  vs.  direct address:  "Fonzie").

Subject: Lakhn mit yashtsherkes

Could it be that "yashtsherkes" is a play on words? "Tsherekes" are
(painful?) boils and the curse "zolst hobn tsherekes ofn tukhes" was not
to be taken lightly. To laugh  through a plague of boils is to laugh with
tears. It makes more sense to me than laughing through lizards.

Subject: Yiddish and the British

Arn Abramson's post [5.067] about the BBC's wartime ban on Yiddish
broadcasts prompts this reflection.  What if they had permitted them? Can
anyone on Mendele imagine a Yiddish newscast in the BBC tone of that
period?  Unlike today's badgering style which is a mixture of
constipation, boredom and bloody-mindedness, the BBC news used to be
aired by a team of undead Oxonians.  How could a Yiddish broadcaster have
sent out the news in 1939-45 vi im geyt es nisht on?

Now if the BBC had had the good sense to hire Mr. Nathan Fleisher that
would have been another story.  Mr. Nathan Fleisher --the Mr. was never
omitted-- was the editor of a Philadelphia Yiddish weekly as well as the
authoritative source of news and commentary on one of the local Yiddish
radio stations.  His influence was immense.  Once in the late 30's he
said: "mayne fraynt, morgen iz Decoration Day [aka Memorial Day].  Hengt
oys a fon." That was all it took.  The Jewish neighborhoods of
Philadelphia for years afterward were awash with flags.  Many Jews, like
my dear father, refused to take them down.  There they flew, defying
weather and custom, until they ceased to be flags.

But Mr. Fleisher really came into his own during the war.  He was to
begin with an educated and intelligent man.  More important, he had a
rich deep baritone, and his broadcasts --they all began with "mayne
fraynt"-- were delivered in the tone of a bone-weary man who had torn
himself away from the Situation Room in the White House, where he and FDR
and Churchill worked and slept, in order to bring meaning to the lives of
the Jews of Philadelphia.

It was that deep tired voice, I think, more than anything else.  Maurice
Schwartz had it too.  When my bobe would hear the words "mayne fraynt"
she would immediately begin to rock and mutter "oyveyzmir".  Punkt vi
s'iz bay ir gevorn tishebov.  Mr. Fleisher would say: mayne frant, di
Rusn hobn bafrayt Stalingrad.  Oyveyzmir, answered my bobe.  And she had
it right!  She understood that in the Yiddish world even good news is not
so ay-ay-ay.

So why should Perfidious Albion have bothered with Yiddish broadcasts?
