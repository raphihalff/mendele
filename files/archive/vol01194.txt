Subject: Introduction

My full name is Zachary Moshe Baker (Moyshe-Zkharye
Beker).  I prefer to be called Zachary.

I am currently Head Librarian of the YIVO Institute for
Jewish Research, and have been so since September 1987.  My
previous library positions were Head of Technical Services
and the Yiddish Dept. of the Jewish Public Library,
Montreal (1981-87) and Chief Yiddish Cataloger in the YIVO
Library (1976-81).

I will be glad to share this newsletter with colleagues
here at YIVO.  Also, in my capacity as librarian, would
like to know if it is possible to receive HARD-COPY
PRINTOUTS of back issues of MENDELE (in order to avoid
blockage of the e-mail system)?  I have received a number
of printouts from Yossi Galron, at Ohio State (vol. 1, no.
1-96, plus no. 170 or thereabouts, onward -- the latter
issues haven't been collated yet).

Subject: RE: Mendele Vol1.191

re homentashn in philadelphia's italian market--there are
homentashn ALL OVER THE PLACE in philadelphia, ALL YEAR
LONG. they've become part of the general culture like
bagels, for reasons that escape me entirely. (i don't
even understand the huge success of bagels, except as
biodegradable teething rings, esp given the enormous
superiority of bialys, virtually unknown west of the hudson
except in some markedly jewish neighborhoods). have homentashn
made it in the rest of the country, or is this just another
strange property of philadelphia?
