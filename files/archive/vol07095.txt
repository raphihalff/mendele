Subject: Shmues

A number of Mendelniks have posted various hypotheses as to the origin of
"shmues."  The simplest one, I believe, is that as the pronunciation suggests,
it is derived from the Hebrew, sh'mu-os, or sh'mu-oys, or, in sefardic Hebrew,
sh'mu-ot.  The root is the familiar shin, mem, ayin, to hear, and the word
itself means "news, that which one has heard." One who engages in the activity
either imparts news (or gossip) or hears some juicy tidbits.  Of course, the
Hebrew word is a plural noun, but it has been transformed in Yiddish into a
verb.  As they say in New York, "No problem!"

Subject: Schlock as sukkah cover

Strange how some questions never die!

When "schlock" came up some time ago I responded and even sent a note on this
to Philologos. Among Eastern European Jews the rain cover on the sukkah was
called a schlock. It was a very heavy pivoted wooden affair raised and lowered
by ropes. If it fell through and hit some one it would be goodby columbus  for
him that was getrofen. I maintain that 'a schlock zol dir trefen' derives from
this. Philologos responded that he didn't believe it because he never heard of
schlock as a sukkah covering, a strange response for a language scholar
considering that many of our mendelyners are familiar with the expression.

Subject: early Yiddish book illustrations

I am an art historian of the medieval and early modern periods.  I have begun
a study of Yiddish book illustrations of the 16th and 17th centuries.  I was
wondering if there are other art historians who work on Yiddish art and if ther
e are other scholars who specialize in medieval and early modern culture.
Has anyone found an illuminated Yiddish ms. dating from the 17th century
or earlier?  I posted these questions two years ago, so some of you may
remember my query.  I may continue my study into later art, but I am beginning
with the early periods.  Also, if anyone knows of conferences that would be
appropriate, please let me know.  A shanem dank,

Subject: Shlock and Schlock

With all the discussion about 'shock' and 'shlock' in recent issues, I wonder
if someone can clarify the origin of the use of 'shlock' (or 'schlock' in its
more common daytchmerish-influenced form) in U.S. English from Yiddish to
mean shoddy or crappy which seems to begin with the idea of shoddily put
together?  I recall its use some years years ago in a negative review of the
book _Future Shock_ headlined as _Future Shlock_.

Subject: Wacht Ojf!  Jiddische Arbeiter- und Widerstandslieder
 
Two weeks ago, in a bookstore in Stockholm's Old Town that had a small section
devoted to Jewish books, I found three LP records, two of them more or less
regular (and used) and one unusual one, in mint condition.  It was produced in
Ebergoetzen (a small town near Goettingen) in 1981 by a record company called
"FolkFreak" [!] which has as a logo a black-frocked hippy-type balalaika/
guitar-strummer along with a rat [FolkFreak FF2002].

It is titled _Wacht Ojf! Jiddische Arbeiter- und Widerstandslieder_ and is
sung in Yiddish by Hai and Topsy Frankl (with guitar music). The notes include
the lyrics in Yiddish and German with some annotations about the authors of
the lyrics, the music and the context of the songs. There is also an
additional set of notes in Swedish with all the words in Swedish and some
additional annotation as well as an introduction meant to educate Swedish
readers about the fact that Jews were also workers and unionists like Swedes
... and fighters against the Nazis. A Swedish cousin translated the Swedish
for me.  The notes also indicate that Hai and Topsy Frankl published a volume
of _Yiddische Lieder_ in 1981 [Texte und Noten mit Begleit-Akkorden] in the
Fischer Taschenbuch series, No. 2960.

I have not had time in the week since I have been back to research the record
or book and send in this note now because of the request for information by
Faith Jones (7:092) about "Shmerke Katerginski" who is the apparent author of
the texts of two of the songs.

The contents are:  (I reproduce the record's transliteration)
 A Side:
   1. Wacht ojf! -- David Edelschtat (text; music anonym.)
   2. Lomir ale singen -- (trad.)
   3. Arbetslose-Marsch -- Mordechaj Gebirtig (text and music)
   4. Majn Jingele -- Morris Rosenfeld (text; music anonym.)
   5. Saj schtolz! -- Morris Rosenfeld (text; music anonym.)
   6. Sog nit kejnmol -- Hirsch Glik (text; music: Pokras)
   7. Schlof majn kind -- (trad)
   8. Der Becher -- (trad.)
 B Side:
   1. Ot asoj nejt a Schnajder -- (trad.)  
   2. Jid, du Partisaner -- Scholem Katscherginski (text; music trad.)
   3. Hemerl -- (trad.)
   4. Dshankoje -- (trad.)
   5. 'Ss brent, Brider -- Mordechaj Gebirtig (text and music)
   6. Der Weg is schwer (Partisaner Marsch) -- Scholem Katscherginksi
            (text; music: Hanns Eisler)
   7. a) Schpil-she mir a Lidele -- I. Kotliar (text; music anonym.)  
      b) Nigun 1, Nigun 2 -- (trad. Melodie ohne worte)
      c) Mir Lebn ejbig -- (Wilnaer Ghetto 1943; music: trad.)

The annotations are rather full for almost all the poets, but for Scholem
Katscherginski there is only an annotation on the Swedish notes where his 
first name is given as Schmerl (in Swedish) and reference is made to an archiv
in New York.  At the same time, the German annotation refers to the fact that
"Jid, du Partisaner" was the song of the Vilna United Partisan Organization,
the group named Itzik Wittenberg after its commander.

I'm hoping mendele's literary and music mavens can provide more information on
this record, the Frankl's book and Sholem Katzerginski.

Subject: Schoch vs. schlock

In the frum areas of New York a term has recently entered our vocabulary.
Schoch, as we all know, is the material (bamboo poles, branches etc.) put on
top of the Sukkah.  Schlock is what you put on top of _that_ to protect the
sukkah when it rains (drop cloth, plastic sheet, roll-down awning, etc.)  You
see this stuff advertised all over the place as "schlock or schloch."

Subject: yiddish script for UNIX

Paul Glasser asked about the Mendele Review in Yiddish [07.092].

I don't know about official information, but for those who work on or have
access to Unix workstations, there is a simple script `yiddish' at
http://www.connix.com/~mlfarm/utilities.html#yiddish which uses Raphael
Finkel's superb LaTeX macros to convert romanized Yiddish texts to Yiddish
fonts.  The script provides options for display of the Yiddish text on the
screen, printing, or saving the text to a file.  The same WWW address has
links to Rapheal Finkel's package of fonts and conversion utilities that are
used by the `yiddish' script.

Subject: More on shmooze

It might be of interest to see how the word shmoos has been absorbed into
American English.

The May 19, 1997 issue of THE NEW YORKER, short book reviews, p. 95, offers:
"While Mr. Gebler, the father of three, is schmoozing, drinking, and having
affairs, ..."

The American Heritage Dictionary, 2nd College Edition, offers [p. 1098]:
"schmoose also schmooze (schooz) Slang. - intr.v. schomoosed, schmoosing,
scomooses also schmoozed, schmoozing, schmooses.  To chat idly. - n. A chat.
[Yiddish schmusen, to chat <shmues, a chat < Heb. shemu'oth, pl. of shemu'ah,
rumor <shamo'a, he heard.] -- schmooz'er n."

From: Savoyid@aol.com
Subject: Bagleytn 

I recently came upon an entry in Weinreich's _Modern English-Yiddish
Yiddish-English Dictionary_ which I think contains a misprint.  And I 
emphasise that I _think_ I've found a misprint and would be grateful if 
someone on this list would either corroborate this or else to please set me
straight.  I'm referring to the entry word _accompany_ on page 5 in my 
edition.  The Yiddish is printed as BALEYTN.  I'm wondering if there's a
missing _gimel_ there and if it should have been printed as BAGLEYTN.
