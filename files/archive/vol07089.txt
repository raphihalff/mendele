Subject: sneezing

As a child, and even when older, whenever I would sneeze my father would
say: "Gib a tsee an eur", by which he meant for me to pull an ear lobe. He
explained it this way: that if a person sneezes while another is thinking of a
departed person (my father's mother in this case) an ear lobe should be
pulled.

I sneezed often and my father often was thinking of his departed mother.
I wonder if this is in anyone else's experience.

Subject: sneezing

The expression bay uns in hoyz is (for a single sneeze): "Tsin gezint, tsum
lebn, an alte bube [zayde] zoltsi vern". It's what Simone (my wife) grew up
with, it's still what her in-laws use (they're from Staszow, Poland 
originally), and it's what our kids have learned to use from us. We don't 
have a tradition of varying the brocha (or whatever one would call it) for a
second or subsequent sneeze.

And no, I haven't really thought about how I'd vary it it I were to hear my
mother-in-law or father-in-law sneeze (which I haven't recently), given they
they are already (zoln gezunt zayn, biz hindert un tsvantsik, keneynehore,
etc.:-)) an alte bube and alte zayde respectively.

Subject: shlak/durkhshlak

Leon Rosenberg writes (7.087) that, in his dialect, a "shlak" denoted "a
foolish person", "a person who could not be persuaded by reason."  I find
that interesting.  In producing a cooking video tape in Yiddish (coming out
in two weeks for the khanike gift season) I learned the word for colander,
"durkhshlak."  Could it be that Rosenberg's "shlak" was simply a reference to
the fact that whatever one tried to impart to the "foolish/stubborn" person,
the effort would pass through like water through a colander?

Subject: Dav(e)nen

Re sylvia schildt's posting, I understand you are joking about the Old French
etymology in an attempt to highlight the rejection by some contemporary
Yiddishists of the idea, held by Weinreich, Fischer/Bin-Nun, and Birnbaum (the
three greatest Yiddish historical linguistics of the century) of a
Judeo-Romance connection for Yiddish.  The reality is that much of the recent
work (Katz, King, Wexler) is quite clearly aimed at showing how much smarter
we are supposedly than in particular Weinreich and in general everybody of
the older generations was.  But not everybody takes this tack, and on the
other hand tehre are some real issues which Weinreich & co. left unsolved, for
example, the relationship between the indubitably French-derived forms 
(tsholent etc.) and the indubitably Italian-derived ones (oorn, antshpoyzn,
etc.) There is even more doubt about the correctness of the idea they had that
bentshn must come from a Latin-based language, since in particular MHGerman
had the form bendiz 'benediction'.  So, I would say do not despair, but also
do not presuppose that everyhting Weinerich may have said has to be right.

Dovid Braun asks that I explain why I think the Hebrew d-b-b etymology is the
only one that works.  I can't go into full details here, but my basic point is
that mere similarity is not enough got an etymology. You need to be able to
account for the exact forms we find.  Hence, Hebrew d-f-f is not a good
etymology because then we would expect *daf(e)nen, and there is no good way to
explain the /v/. Kosover's etymology involving MHGerman doenen is much worse,
that would have to give *deynen or something like that (as Birnbaum points
out). Various other etymologies, incl. the supposed Turkic, Arabic, and
Persian ones fail for many reasons listedby Birnbaum but also because they all
seem to derive this word from some form like dave, which would probably have
given a Yiddish form like *dov(e)nen.  A form like tabu, which is recently
proposed as the Turkic eymology in an article that just came out recently,
would of course yield *tab(e)nen or again *tob(e)nen.  But from the Hebrew
da:vav (from the root D-B-B) you would get *davv- whence dav- just as from
pa:saq you get pask-.  The only remaining trouble is why the variaition
between davenen and davnen. Even that is probably easier to explain from the
Hebrew than from any other source. This is becuse almost all Hebrew-origin
verbstems in Yiddish come from Hebrew roots with three distinct consonants.
In Standard Yd, in fact, it may be the only one which does not.  The missing
-e- in davnen may perhaps be the expedted outcome after a single consonant,
in contrast to paskenen and others with a cluster of two consonants, but I am
not yet quite sure if this is right. However, here again, I think that the
authors and  supporters of the other etymologies have not tried to explain
this fact at all, which would once again militate against taking their 
proposals as valid.  An irregulairity like this is usually a sign of something
historically important.

Subject: A story of Chelm

In Mendele  07.077 Louis Fridhandler  brings the story of  the Chelmer shames
knocking on the shutters to wake up the people to go to prayer. Louis adds
that "This  story ...  is one I've  heard, but  never read among the 
well-known tales of this town".

As this story was known to me  I reached for my Bible on such matters,
A.  Doryanov's(sp?)  collection with  3170 stories,  which I  had been given
for my  prehistoric bar mitzva.  Sure enough the  story is there as number
1039, essentially as had been told here, the only difference was that this
shutter knocking was not performed every day but only on the slikhes days,
when one gets up especially early.

The book I have is in Hebrew and AFAIK is still in print its name being sefer
habedi`ha we-ha`hidud (book of the joke and the witticism).

Subject: Yiddish anarchist group in England

Estelle Souche enquires [07.087:7] about a Yiddish anarchist group and a
bilingual anarchist journal "V'panotch" in Jubilee Street, London, in 1991,
as cited in a French novel by Jean-Baptiste Evette. Is this a misprint or is
the novellist creating some sort of time-warp? Of course, there were Yiddish
anarchists aplenty in this vicinity in the early years of this century and
the illustrious Rudolf Ro(c)ker did indeed edit a bilingual anarchist
periodical entitled _Der hilfruf/ V Pomoshtsh'_ during the years 1911-12. At
the time he was living at 33 Dunstan Houses, just off Stepney Green, about 2
minutes walk from Jubilee Street. But by 1991 there was precious little left
in London's East End to remind one of the the area's Jewish past (whether
anarchist or not). In 1991 the garment trade still flourished in dark
overcrowded sweatshops, but the voices one heard were Bengali not Yiddish.
Incidentally, with particular reference to 07.087:4, could I possibly put in
a plea for a code of good practice in accordance with which, inter alia,
Mendelyaner refrain from misquoting each other?

Subject: davenen

Sylvia Shildt raises the possibility that davenen might be derived from Old 
French. As Rashi, and to a lesser extent, Rashbam, are good sources of Old
French equivalents, I thought of their uses and could find none resembling the
Yiddish word we know for prayer.  To check myself out, I looked at the Bar
Ilan Responsa CDROM collection which covers them fully and could find no word
or close relative in use by them.  Of course negative evidence of this kind is
intrinsically limited - one new positive example and this evidence is 
worthless.

While using the CDROM, I checked all the parshanim as well as all the responsa
literature from 10th Century onward to today and did not find any use of the
word.

Ah, well.

Subject: davenen

I was disturbed at Sylvia Schildt's comments, suggesting that "theoretical"
linguists for some incomprehensible reason turn to obscure languages as the
sources for Yiddish words and reject the possibility of an origin in Old
French.  This accusation is just unfair and saddening. No one discounts an Old
French component in Yiddish; everyone agrees that bentshn and tsholnt and a
number of other words are from medieval Jewish Romance languages.  And the
idea that some Yiddish words are from Turkish is not new.  I have no
commitment to any particular suggested etymology for davenen, but I know how
such proposals have to be evaluated, and the methods are far from new: they
were discovered by the great philologist/linguists of the mid-nineteenth
century, they are the methods that made possible almost all we know about the
history of Yiddish, they were the daily tools of Max Weinreich among others. 

They are not hard to summarize, either: 
The basic idea is that sound change is regular, and if in some individual case
it seems to be irregular then there must be some reason based on the structure
of the language or the specific historical and social circumstances.  The idea
that sound change is regular simply means that if a given sound or sequence of
sounds changes to another sound in a particular language at a particular time,
then every word in which it occurs changes in the same way.  If the vowel u
changes to i in certain Yiddish dialects, then it doesn't change only in the
word bukh but in all the words in which it occurs.  If the Hebrew sound of the
letter "sof" (which was like th in English thin) is pronounced as an s when
those words appear in Yiddish, then it is s in all the words in which sof
appears.  Exceptions need explanation.  This is not esoteric dogma hoarded by
the privileged few or a radical fringe, not a matter of authority, not
experimental, not even very theoretical.

Subject: Cecilia Bartoli's Yiddish Pronunciation

A few weeks ago, a Mendelist (Mendelenik?)--I forget who--inquired about
Cecilia Bartoli's Yiddish (and, I might add, Hebrew) pronunciation in her new
disk, "Chant D'amour."  On this disk, in addition to a number of songs in
French, Italian, and Greek, this magnificent young mezzo sings a "Chanson
hebraique" by Maurice Ravel, which turns out to be "Mayerke main zon," in
Yiddish.  There are two others, Kaddish (in Hebrew, or to be more precise,
Hebrew and Aramaic), and "Die alte kashe," in Yiddish.

Cecilia obviously had a splendid coach on Hebrew and Yiddish pronunciation.
The first thing that strikes me is her absolutely perfect pronunciation of
the letters khes and khaf.  My zeyde could have done no better. Ms. Bartoli
generally seems to avoid German--I have yet to hear her sing anything in that
language--and one might have thought that it had something to do with
reluctance to try its guttural sounds.  But her gutturals sound perfectly
natural in mame loshn and in Hebrew.

The only fault that I found in her pronunciation was her use of a hard "s"
instead of a soft "s" in "zon" (= son) in "Mayerke mayn zon."  But this is
a very minor quibble.  In every other respect, her pronunciation is perfect,
at least to my ear, and her musicianship, the feeling she transmits through
her magnificent voice--what can I say?  Oy, iz dos a khazn!  You should all
hear her "Kaddish."  It will make you weep.

For these tracks alone, this disk is worth the price.

My only criticism concerns the transliterations, which are pretty weird,
but quite understandable with a little effort.

Enjoy!
