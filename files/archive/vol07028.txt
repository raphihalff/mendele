Subject: Overheard German

Today, after attending my weekly Yiddish study group, I was walking
through a department store when I overheard three people conversing in
German.  Each and every word used was also a Yiddish word, but I knew I
was overhearing German, not Yiddish by the way the words were formed by
the lips of the speakers -- I am not referring to pronunciation.  What
phenomenon was I becoming aware of? I'm sure the linguists among us must
be familiar with this, but I don't know what it is called (not that it is
necessary to call it anything) and how it is recognized.  Again, I
emphasize that I am not referring to pronunciation.  All knowledge (or
guesses) much appreciated.

Subject: Say It in Yiddish

I have received a number of msgs informing me that my assumption was wrong 
that the Weinreichs intended for Say It in Yiddish to be witty [7.025], and 
so I am acknowledging my error publicly. Alas, this is one truth I am sorry 
to have learned...

I would also like to add that I for one do not feel that Yiddish or Ashkenazi 
culture is demeaned by not ever having traffic court judges or customs 
officers or airline personnel -- but, hey, we are all free to feel insulted 
by whatever we like.

"Those who knew my father's work in the original had always maintained, as
some still do, that his writing was untranslatable. His yiddish was so rich,
so idiomatic, earthy, folksy, allusive, that no equivalents for it could
possibly be found in another language that would carry the same shade of
meaning, association and mood. My father, who knew several languages, a
couple of them perfectly - and had a special sense for Russian - was not
pessimistic about the possibility of translation.

"He had his own notion of what a translation ought to be, a rendition not of
the same words or phrases, but of the idea and mood the original sought to
convey; he explained this in detail, with examples, in a letter to my brother
Misha, who wanted to try his hand at translating our father's stories into
Russian. So the Yiddish idiom, "From hurrying comes no good" (Fun aylenish
kumt keyn guts nit aroys) becomes in Russian, "The quieter you ride, the
farther you get" (Tishe yedesh dalshe budesh); and the (ironic) Yiddish,
"Some jump!" (Folg mir a gang), becomes the Russian, "He hit the spot in the
sky" (Popal palchem v nebo)"

Subject: Weinreich's "Say it in Yiddish"

I've had a copy of "Say it in Yiddish" for a long time.  The book is part of 
a series of phrase-books in various languages, including Hebrew, French, 
Spanish, Turkish, Russian, etc.  And they all follow the same pattern.  I 
would guess that the publishers simply hired Weinreich to translate the 
standard phrases into Yiddish without really thinking about the issues we've 
raised.  Since they were putting out a series of phrase books for travellers, 
the real mystery is why they saw fit to do a Yiddish book in their series 
at all.
