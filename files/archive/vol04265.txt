Subject: Searching for electronic text

Does anyone know if any of Sholem Aleichem's works are available on-line
in an electronic text repository? It seems to me that, like Twain, most
of the U.S. copyrights on the original works have run their course and
these works are eligible to be scanned in and made available to all.

Unfortunately, the texts would have to be English translations (due to
the limited support for non-Roman alphabets in most computers.

Subject: The old Forverts

My father worked for the Yiddish Forverts for many years, until he passed
away in 1954.  As a result of his interest in Yiddish for all of his life
(as an immigrant in 1905, ;he went to night school and then  translated
some of the English language books and they were published in the
newspapers of the time, like the Tsayt), us four children all went to the
Sholem Aleichem Folkshulen.

One of our neighbors in the Bronx (during the late 20s) was Avrum Reisen,
the well known poet.  He was as I recalled a gentle soul and very easy to
talk to and enjoy.

One of the stories I heard from Pop was about the 'zetzers' (linotypists)
and their ideas as to how Yiddish should be written and its correct form.
He told me that some of them had the chutzpah to make changes to the copy
submitted and revise it to conform to what they believed would be correct
and better to read.  It seems that one of their favorite targets was ----
Sholem Asch.   Vey!

Just to add another thought.  In as much as I have a strong attachment to
the memory of the Forverts that used to be, I felt it to be important to
subscribe to the English language Forward.  For those that have not seen
it, I strongly recommend it.

Subject: The Association of Jewish Ex-servicemen (AJEX)

Having just returned from a month's stay in Israel, I would like to bring
the attention of the list to the fact that in Israel is a branch of the
British Association of Jewish Ex-Servicemen (AJEX). This branch is run by
an ex-Manchester man named Harold Greene now living at 33 Dov Hoz Street,
Tel Aviv 63416 (tel:03-524-6412).

The branch caters to ex-members of the British forces and the
Commonwealth nations, many of whom are regular speakers of Yiddish. They
are scattered throughout the state of Israel and are kept informed of the
latest information via a regular newsletter sent out by Mr Greene.

The Israeli branch is anxious to hear from any of the former members of
AJEX so that they can be added to their list.

While walking along Dizengoff Street I caught the sound of two men in a
horse and cart repeatedly calling out "Alte zachen, alte zachen!" This
was the first time I had heard the phrase since leaving the East End of
London many years ago. This was a method many of us East Enders were
forced to use in order to get a few pennies for discarded clothing. The
only thing I wanted to mention here was that the two men in the cart were
Arabs!

Subject: Gedabrt

Not that I have any personal interest in learning the answer to this
discussion, but couldn't someone contact the primary source, Theodore
Bikel, and ask him?

But that's not nearly as much fun as speculation ... ;>)

Subject: Grodne

Grodno:  Since you asked a librarian, here's a librarian's response.
(This, in reference to Dovid Braun's posting on "Fershtot" [Mendele
4.260].)

Since Grodno (Yiddish:  Grodne) was the seat of a pre-1918 guberniia, it
was much more than a shtetl, and the Jewish population was substantial
(close to 35,000 at its peak, in 1912, or 60% of the city's total
population).  It was also one of the oldest Jewish settlements in
historical Lithuania.  See the Jewish Encyclopedia, the Evreiskaia
Entsiklopediia, and the Encyclopaedia Judaica for background, in English
and Russian.

Yiddish sources include the post-Holocaust memorial book, "Grodnah -
Grodne," edited by Dov Rabin (1973).  See also "Grodne zaml-heft,"
published by the Farband fun Grodner yidn in Yisroel (no. 1- Dec. 1958-
); "Grodne," by Eliyahu Gozhanski (Tel Aviv, 1945); "Grodner opklangen,"
published in Buenos Aires from 1949-1981; and a curious pamphlet listed
in the YIVO Library's subject catalog, "A shreklikhe geshikhte fun R'
Eliezer hakodesh vos iz gegangen oyf kidesh hashem in Grodno in yohr
1770" (Horodno:  Farlag A. L. Miller, 1913).  Other titles are also noted
in the YIVO Library subject catalog, and YIVO has a number of newspapers
published in Grodno.

As the imprint for the last-cited title implies, another form of the
place name is Horodno (and its variants).  A history of the community, in
Hebrew, was published in Vilna in 1880:  "Sefer 'ir giborim:  yekalkel
korot 'ir Horodno mi-reshit yeme hivsadah," by Shim'on Eliezer
Fridenshtein.

That's just for starters.
