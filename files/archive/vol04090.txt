Subject: Introduction

Nu? vos zoll ikh zogn? I am going to be 77 years old next month. After
living with alle goyim for many years I returned to Baltimore, and moved
into a condominium of all Jewish residents, 192 units. Hob ikh ungefangen
reydn yiddish noch amol. Ikh reyd a proster yiddish. I am, I suppose, a
secular Jew. I don't know my aleph, beys, so I can only read yiddish in
transliteration. I am aware of the YIVO prescribed method of spelling, my
1964 version of The Encyclopedia Brittanica has Yiddish-English Dictioary
which conforms to the YIVO style. Recently, in our Condo news letter, I
wrote about a Sunday breakfast that condo had, I wrote it was "takeh a
mekhiah", someone called me and told me I spelled it wrong. I think in
yiddish anything goes in spelling and pronunciation.

Subject:  Sons in kitchens

How did sons learn kitchen yiddish?  There is a sexist presumption in the
question, but anyway...

In the late 40's in Chicago I lived in a one-bdrm apt with my parents.
One days when the weather was too inclement to play outside, where do you
think I was?  Sitting at the kitchen table and watching my Mom cook!  I
might have had a book in front of me, but that didn't stop my Mom from
talking at me continually while she potchke'd around.  Of course she
would never let me help her or touch anything (except to lick the
frosting), but curiously, when I left home to go to college and began
living alone, I immediately knew how to cook, and am now considered a
gourmet cook.  The one problem in this story is that my mom, American-
born, talked to me in English, unfortunately,  but the point is, in tiny
apts, when weather was terrible [not uncommon outside of Southern
California 8-)], and there were bowls of frosting to lick, where do you
suppose the Jewish boys were?

dovid, i had assumed--and more or less correctly it seems--that the or at
least some of the interviews would be archived--and they do indeed
contain running text.

andrew, thanks for the reply and explanation. i wasn't demeaning regional
variation or the study thereof. i was just thinking of how great it would
be if i could, for example, pull out all relative clauses or passives or
what-have-you uttered in the interviews, regardless of the dialect area
of their speaker. now, i FULLY realize that all the relevant tagging
possible is a VERY LONG job. that's why i suggested that it would be a
real mitsve to get the interviews archived first, and THEN add whatever
tagging is desired. that way, those of us interested in some particular
thing can at least go search for ourselves, until such time as tagging
plus automated searches can do it for us.

in any event, i think it's great, however you go about it.

Subject: Recording Review - Voices of the Ghetto

david gasser, thanks for telling us about this recording. it particularly
interests me because i interviewed jacques grober about 10 years ago in
paris because he was a former voice student of a singer i was
researching, sarah gorby. i'm really delighted to see he's keeping up
with his yiddish singing. do you know if the recording is available in
the u.s.? one record/cassette that i believe is available and that might
interest you is sarah gorby's 'unforgettable songs of the ghetto', a
re-release by epic in israel of a rerelease by arion in paris of an
original philips recording in paris, les inoubliables chants du ghetto de
sarah gorby. i'm very sure it provided a large measure of the inspiration
for grober's recording, plus it's very beautiful, imho.

Subject: Musings on translations

Reviving the translation discussion of a few weeks ago.

Yiddish writers have displayed a wide spectrum of attitudes toward
translation of their work into languages that reach an audience far
larger than the Yiddish-reading public.  Regarding this, Max Erik (many
years ago) compared Peretz and Sholem-Aleykhem in a very interesting
article that relied for evidence largely on letters.  The citation is:

Erik, Maks: Sholem-Aleykhem un zayn iberzetser [Sholem Aleichem and His
Translator], in Tsaytshrift far Yidisher Geshikhte, Demografye un
Ekonomik, Literatur-Forshung, Shprakhvisnshaft un Etnografye (Minsk) 5
(1931) 79-88 [Yiddish & Russian].

When it came to having his work translated into Russian, Peretz was
relaxed, granting the matter only casual attention to the point of
negligence.  Erik found evidence for a far different attitude in Sholem-
Aleykhem.

Sholem-Aleykhem was excitedly involved in all aspects of the proposed
1910 edition of a substantial portion of his work in Russian translation.
He saw it as a major advance in his career, and thought of it as "hacking
out a window, the first gap leading toward the gentile world."  The
thought of a possible artistic failure made him extremely anxious.  Erik
felt the fear was quite understandable in view of the difficulties posed
by Sholem-Aleykhem's style and the dearth of experienced translators.

Of special interest are Erik's comments on Sholem-Aleykhem's ideas
regarding a translation problem noted by many.  That is, devices have to
be invented to render Tevye's double-language word play as he quotes a
Hebrew posek and immediately repeats it Yiddish.  He often mistranslates
the Hebrew to make ironic comments in Yiddish.  It's a daring high-wire
act in the original, playing subtly and skilfully to the ear and Jewish
memories.  These instances are often impossible to translate without
footnotes.

The Russian translator offered Sholem-Aleykhem three possible ways of
dealing with this: 1) quote the posek in Hebrew in a Latin transcription,
and explain the Russian meaning in a footnote. 2) translate them
immediately into Russian. 3) render them in stylized slavic as used in
churches [Kirkhlekh-Slavish] followed by the Russian.

The translator liked the first idea best.  Sholem-Aleykhem hated it, told
him to put the idea out of his head.  Sholem-Aleykhem liked the third idea
best.

Further, in one of the letters quoted, Sholem-Aleykhem demanded that all
terms of religious significance be taken out. That is, terms such as
Kidesh, Kadish, Yortsayt, Tfiln, Mezuze, Mikve, Mayrev, Tales Kotn.

Given the significant compromises allowed by Sholem-Aleykhem, I don't
feel so bad about the compromises I have occasionally made in translating
his work into English.  I see no overarching principle.  One must invent
case by case.  I have occasionally changed paragraph order, sentence
order, even idea order, because English style seemed to demand it.
Further, Sholem-Aleykhem sometimes uses a string of adjectives which
sound wonderful in Yiddish with each adjective adding to the fine tuning
of the atmosphere.  However, in English, that usually sounds like a
quotation from a thesaurus entry, awkwardly, boringly repetitious.  My
solution?  Ruthlessly chop off some adjectives.  Maybe not the best
solution, but the only one I could devise.  Puns and spoonerisms make
special, difficult demands on the translator.

Anybody else like to share translation experiences?

BTW I just remembered another line from Sholem Secunda's "Bay Mir
Bistu Sheyn."

     Bay mir bistu git, bay mir hostu "it"

[So the words contained at least one English word in the original. This
was composed during the Clara Bow era.  Clara Bow was known as the "it"
girl.]
