Subject: Introduction; echad me yodea in yiddish

Hi, I am new to this list, and joined because Noyekh Miller suggested
that here i would find an answer to my question about why it is that my
parents say things like solent for cholent (and is this a Litvishe
dialect). I am originally an Australian, although i have been in the
States for the last two years. However my parents were born in South
Africa, as were both my grandmothers, both my grandfathers having been
born in Lithuania (where certainly my mother's mother's family was from -
there are rumours that maybe my father's mother came from Bialystok, but
such a deep dark secret is not something the family is willing to own up
to without caste iron evidence).

My other question is does anybody know the full words to a version of
echad me yodea in yiddish (reproduced in garbled form below). I have also
heard a more standard version, but it doesn't put in all the info, such
as the names of the matriachs and patriachs etc.

As you can see, my yiddish is very rudimentary, even my parents don't
really speak it,although they understand it, so forgive all the errors.


I would like to know if anybody on the list knows the words to my version
of echad m'yode'a in yiddish, I only know a garbled version that goes:

Aintz, Aintz, Aintz, Aintz,
Vos is aintz b'dait
Ich vais, ich vais, ich vais,
Vos is aintz b'dait,

Aine, is Ha Kodesh Baruch Hu
.....  in himmel
un ainer is a du

Zvei etc

Zvei luchos .... shein
....... de Eibishter alein.

Drei etc

Drei is de tates ....
Avrohm, Yitzchak, Yaakov, zichronim l'vracha

Fir etc

Fir di mames ....
Sarah, Rivka, Rochel, un Leah.

Finif etc

Finif chumashim in di Toyra,
Bereshis, Shmos, Bemidbar, D'varim un V'yikra.

Zex etc

Zex mishnayos in de(?) shas
zaraim, moed, nashim, nezikin, kodshim un tehoras

Zibin etc

Zibin teg in di vocht
zuntik, montik, dinstik .... shabbas un mid-vocht

And this is where we grind to a complete halt (the dots indicate words I
can't even guess at) and you will probably have a good laugh at my poor
attempt at making sense of it (and I have forgotten the days of the week
for the last line).

Regards

Subject: Childhood Misconceptions About Yiddish

Recently learned of a friend's childhood misconception about Yiddish:
She thought one was born speaking English, and as one became the age of
one's parents one became bilingual.  When one had reached the hallowed
age of one's grandparents one had advanced to the purest state--and spoke
only Yiddish.

This story has made me curious about other possible childhood
misconceptions about Yiddish, or Jewishness.  Any out there?

Subject: Sinozishe Nayes

Shalom Rosenfeld, former editor of *Ma'ariv*, the daily newspaper with
the second largest circulation in Israel, relates an anecdote of interest
and humor in his weekly column (July 8, 1994).

"The arrival of the first Chinese freighter to the shores of Israel this
week lit a yellow light in my memory.

"There is a story in the Jewish journalistic folklore about an eye
opening headline in one of the Yiddish newspapers of New York, according
to which, `The Empress of China arrived in America to seek a husband.'
How did this happen?  The energetic news editor of the Yiddish paper saw
a headline in the English newspaper: The "Empress of China" arrives in
America on its _maiden voyage_.  Why else would a Chinese maiden come to
America? -- he asked himself.  He put two and two together and attained
the scoop of his life!"

Subject: Der Midos Velt

Baruch Leib Gale writes:

Der Midos Velt and similar books and tapes (this one is both) are not
Lubavitch, but other Chassidic (possibly Satmar, but I can't be sure).  I
have the book here, and it's copyright by the author, Z. Schmelczer, of
New Square / Spring Valley NY.  (New Square, incidentally, is actually a
corruption of "New Skvir".  I'm not sure where Skvir was in Europe,
though.  Anyone know?)

As further evidence, the Midos Velt tape, along with all the others by
Zisha Schmelczer, features the southern Yiddish used by Satmar and
others, not the Litvish Yiddish used by Lubavitchers.

Lubavitchers don't use Yiddish nearly as much as they used to. Children
in Lubavitch communities don't speak Yiddish with each other from what I
have seen, whereas Bobov and Satmar children do. (Our son attends a
Lubavitch cheder in Toronto, where most of the other kids are
Lubavitchers; of 17 kids in his kindergarten class this past year, only
one other speaks Yiddish fluently.) We spent last week in Boro Park,
where Yiddish on the street is the norm for all ages; in Crown Heights
it's much rarer among the young.

Subject: Meldung un berikht: the Yale-New Haven Leyn Kreiz

In the hope of attracting some Yiddishists, of whatever degree of
proficiency, among Mendelniks who live at all close to New Haven, a short
report on our activities.

We have been meeting continuously for over ten years, evolving from a
group for shmues af mame-loshn to a leyn kreiz. Peripatetic at first, we
seem now to be settled in the Library of Dwight Hall on the Yale campus.
Our *de facto* vorsitzer and factotum (or at least facpaenetotum) is Sid
Resnick.  He is attempting, against considerable resistance from our
docile mitglieder, to introduce some degree of democracy in our group:
many are so pleased with his firershaft that they would gladly make him
*dictator perpetuus*. Unzer sekretar un finanz minister is Ethel Himberg,
herself organizer of an earlier incarnation of the Yiddish group at Yale.

Our main reading for the 1993/94 academic year was *Oifn zedens felder*,
the 1953 novel by Isaac Metzker, whose widow, an enthusiastic and erudite
Yiddishist, regularly attended our  meetings until her death last fall.
We also had several lectures, including one by Rokhel Wizner, mitglied
and staff member at YIVO, who described her project on pre-war Jewish
youth in Poland. She has been working from autobiographies, mostly in
Yiddish, submitted by teenagers for an essay contest organized for YIVO
by Max Weinreich himself. We ended our season with a lecture by Dr.
Moisheh Wolf, formerly of Moscow, where he was a professor of psychiatry
and, more relevant, a contributor to *Sovietish Heymland*. This lecture
drew an oylem of record size: thirty-five, of whom about half were
immigrants from Russia. Dr. Wolf's lecture centered on the actor Shloimeh
Mikhoels and the poet Shmuel Halkin.

We have been meeting Tuesdays at noon, and will resume early in
September. If you would like to join us, please contact me by e-mail,
snail-mail (90 Heloise St., Hamden, CT 06517), or phone
[home: (203)624-1235/office:(203)432-0988].

P.S.
Is there anything nit azay aye-aye-aye about our leyn kreiz? Yes: a
habitual disrespect shown to my (imperfect) Riga dialect, though it is
surely the Tuscan, the Parisian, the Attic of Yiddish.

Subject: A new address

The gods of the machine at Trinity have changed addresses a bit.  Please
make a note of this: the shames can _no longer_ be reached at

nmiller@dot.trincoll.edu

The new and simpler address is

nmiller@trincoll.edu

As for mail to Mendele, all is as before.  There was however some
confusion on Thursday or Friday and I fear that some posts bounced and
were returned to sender.  Please repost.
