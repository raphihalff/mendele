Subject: Tshavuk

[See 24.006] I have a suggestion that the meaning of tshavuk is 'shoemaker' from the polish 'szewc.'

In reply to Gerald Marcus [24.006], tshavuk may come from khozer betshuva or baal tshuva.

Subject: Request for full text II

I do not have an answer for Gloria Sosin’s inquiry [24.006] on the full text of "In Brooklyn in a shtibl, on vent un on a dakh, hot zikh gelebt an oreman mit kinderlekh asakh" but oh what memories that line brought back.  I am now 87 but when I was about 3 years old I had an older cousin who used to recite this as a poem.  She also recited another that began "Genug shoyn shrayt Moyshe Yosl.  Du veyst nisht fun..." a poem about a greenhorn who didn’t yet understand what living in America was all about.  Those two lines have lived somewhere in my brain all these years and for some reason come to mind ever so often.  I, too, would love to know the full text of either. 

BTW – I never spoke Yiddish as a child but understood it because my grandmother who only spoke Yiddish raised me...it is only in recent years that I have become interested in speaking Yiddish and am so grateful for having found Mendele.

Subject: Yiddish stories in transliteration

Hello,

My father, Melvin Santer, has for many years participated in and led various Yiddish reading groups and helped organize the Yiddish Cultural Festival at Haverford College. He has asked me to help him locate Sholem Aleichem stories (or other fun reading-group material) in Yiddish transliterated to English characters. Many members of his reading group have solid Yiddish language comprehension but cannot read the Hebrew letters. He has transliterated some stories (which he would be happy to share). It is a big job, if someone's already done some of it, why reinvent the wheel? We found this trove of 20 or so transliterated tales: http://www.cs.uky.edu/~raphael/IAYC/. 

Does any one know of others?

Subject: Dialect variation in compound words

There are many Yiddish words which depend on dialect, for instance "Oyto" or "Mashin"/"Kukuruze" or "Papshoy" etc. I wanted to know about such words that are at times found combined with another word to form a totally different phrase, like "Papshoy Shneyelekh", "Lastoyto" etc. Is it possible to say that all such words aren't necessarily only in that form, and for those that have the dialect to use the other way of that word could use their word for such combinations, and therefore we'd have alternative ways of saying the above words as-"Kukuruze Shneyelekh" or "Lastmashin", or do we say that all the words are only the way the dictionaries bring it? If it could be said otherwise, how come the dictionaries didn't bring the alternative (unless perhaps other forms were very unacceptable for whatever reason they decided specifically for these words to change the word they're used to)?
