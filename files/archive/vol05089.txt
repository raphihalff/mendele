Subject: Can you be "cool" in Yiddish?

My daughter has asked me if there is a Yiddish equivalent for the English
word "cool."  She doesn't mean in the temperature sense, but in the "ok",
"neat", or "groovy" sense.  I guess "cool" has retained this meaning over
the years so that even today's teenagers refer to something being cool as
a way to express their general, if not strong approval.  So, for example,
a teenaged girl might tell someone that a particular boy she is fond of
is cool.

My meager knowledge of Yiddish is too weak to have encountered some
equivalent.

Thanks for your help.  I am prepared to tell my daughter that there is no
equivalent because slang need not be translatable.

Subject: Concerning a Yiddish Font

The _Language and Culture Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry_ uses a rather
unusual text system named Signum, previously supported only by the Atari,
but now available for the MacIntosh as well. It is _not_ Microsoft
compatible. Signum is produced in Heidelberg but the person who can
provide me with the name and address of the company is now travelling in
America. Perhaps one of our subscribers in Germany can help with this
information.

In any event, we have created a Signum font for the Atlas which has all
the unique letters and letter combinations, diacritics and all, that
distinguish Yiddish from Hebrew. Indeed, Signum permits one to create
variations on the font without any difficulty. It provides the
possibility of using as many as seven fonts in a document, and the
capability of moving freely from left to right and right to left.

Should any Mendele subscriber acquire Signum for the Atari or the Mac, I
would be happy to supply him/her with a copy of our Yiddish font.
(However, I will be out of reach for the next 9 or 10 days.)

Subject: Sing-along

We are a group of people from many parts of Israel who get together from
time to time in order to sing Yiddish songs. Our next session will be
held on October 30th at Kibbutz Hulda at 8:30 p.m.

If you intend to visit Israel or will be there by that date, you are
invited to join us for what should be an enjoyable evening. In Israel you
may call me at 08-445-292.

Subject: Consulting willows

I wonder whether anyone could provide information (personal narrative,
textual sources, scholarly discussion [other than those enumerated in
Weinreich and Weinreich's bibliography of _Yiddish Language and
Folklore_) regarding the custom of consulting willows to foretell the
future. I know that this practice was part of my great-grandmother's
consultancy (curer, clairvoyant, opshprekher[i]n), but there my knowledge
ends. Did one visit the willow (Yid. _verbe_) or merely consult its
leaves? If the former, did one look for specific signs or commune with it
more generally? Were there attendant rituals? Did anyone have access to
the verbe's wisdom, or only (wise) women? What was the practice called in
Yiddish? Was it shared by coterritorial non-Jews?

Do other Mendelyaners remember a song in which Chava Albershteyn's
persona announces her intention to visit a willow which would "alts
dertseyln" about her intended? Note, possibly lehavdil, that Disney's
Pocahontas consults a willow to the same end.

Many thanks in advance.

Subject: A nay klayd/Rokhl Korn

A dank aykh ale velkhe hobn mir geshikt di prakhtfule verter fun Rokhl
Korn's lid. Ikh vil tsugebn az Sheva Zucker hot geshribn az dos lid ken
men gefinen in Korn's bukh, "Bashertkeyt" un az ale hobn ongevizn Ruth
Whitman's iberzetzung. (A spetsyeln dank Shleyme Axelrod, un Mikhl
Herzog.)

I found Bernard Katz's comments (Vol.5.084) regarding the translation
most rewarding in their intensity, and I stand in his corner, especially
in regard to the last line. Whitman's "heavy as a stone" disregards the
nuance and process implied by Korn in the tear petrifying and turning to
stone for its new perpetual life as a mere glass button.

I have special pride in Korn (1898-1982), a Galitzianern, who started
writing in Polish, began learning Yiddish (and embraced it) to respond to
the pogroms following the first World War. She continued writing in
Yiddish after WW11 (emigrated to Montreal), and went on to receive the
Manger Award in Yiddish Literature in 1974.

Dos heyst a Galitzianer kop....

Subject: Klor vays tsigele/lady in the dark

Iosif Vaisman in Mendele Vol 5.084 posted an excerpt from a critique
about Rozhinkes un Mandlen that leaves me very much a lady in the dark,
along with all the hartzike people who clamor for it at simkhes where it
is performed by unaware artists.

I would appreciate any clarifications as to why Caplan says this melodic
lidele vos hot ayngevigt azoy fil zeese yidishe yingelekh un meydelekh is
so offensive and intellectually dangerous.
