Subject: Yiddish at the movies

[Kevin Cohen (Mendele Vol. 13 No. 9) asks about the film "Ivan and Abraham"
aka "Moi Ivan, Toi Abraham"].

"Si les Ukrainiens --et une bonne partie des Juifs-- parlent un russe
classique des plus anachroniques, il est bien vrai que les acteurs de langue
ukrainienne ne courent pas les steppes. Quant au yiddish du film, s'il
s'agit bien syntaxiquement de yiddish, il reste eloigne de la musique, des
accents et des intonations de la langue et il sonne faux. L'impression
domine ici que les acteurs n'ont pas ete diriges : ils n'ont pas travaille
leur yiddish comme un corps vivant; ils se contentent dans la plupart des
cas de l'enonner et le cantonnent ainsi au rale ingrat d'un alibi. La
comparaison s'impose ici avec "Bruxelles-Transit" de Samy Szlingerbaum, un
film dont le yiddish trouvait et prenait sa place. Dans le meme registre, la
bande-son ignore etrangement toute reference a la musique et aux chants des
Juifs de l'Est pour faire la part belle a un Vissotsky deplace et bien trop
russe sinon tout simplement trop moderne".

Subject: False modesty

May I once again appeal to all Mendelyaner who are or who intend to become
authors of books on Yiddish topics? Be more ambitious! Don't just think in
terms of semi-private distribution among a handful of friends and
aficionados.

Assume that university libraries are going to want to order your book (Mine
certainly will. I shall see to that!) and that better bookshops are going to
want to stock your book. But, in order to facilitate this wider
distribution, please, when posting in Mendele an announcement of a new book,
so that librarians and other potential purchasers do not have to write to
you separately (and not all of them may be as assiduous as I!) include in
your announcement a citation of the relevant bibliographical details in the
following format:

Author's (or editor's) last name, first name and/or further initials,
_title_, place of publication: publisher, year of publication, number of
pages [ISBN:], price.

n.b. the number of pages is not calculated by doubling the number of sheets
of paper, but is the last pagination number actually printed in the book. If
the book has more than one pagination series (as is often the case when
there is a preface or if the book is bilingual) list the last number in each
of the pagination series, e.g.: xliii, 185, 192pp.

Subject: New book: The Artists of the Kultur-Lige

Kazovsky, Hillel (Gregory).  The Artists of the Kultur-Lige  Khudozhniki
Kul'tur-Ligi.  Jerusalem: Gesharim; Moskva: Mosty Kul'tury, 2003.  343
pages, illus.  ISBN 5-93273-130-3

For those who are interested in modern Yiddish culture at a crucial juncture
in its development - the years immediately following the First World War -
this is a most important new book.  Its focus is on the Arts Section of the
Kultur-Lige, an organization that was founded in Kiev in January 1918 "with
the objective of promoting Yiddish culture."  Kazovsky, the author of an
earlier study, Artists from Vitebsk: Yehuda Pen and His Pupils (Moskva:
Imidzh, [ca. 1991]), writes in his introduction, "This book is only an
interim 'archaeological' report about the history of the Kultur-Lige and its
Arts Section."  Nevertheless, he has uncovered a lot of previously
undiscovered material (both artworks and documentation) in archives,
museums, and private collections in the former Soviet Union, Western Europe,
and Israel, and that alone makes this a valuable contribution to the growing
literature on Jewish participation in the artistic avant-garde.

The focus of Kazovsky's study is the Kultur-Lige in Kiev, even though (as he
notes) the organization had important branches in Ukraine, Russia,
Lithuania, Romania, and (especially) Poland.  A number of the Kultur-Liga
artists whom he discusses are well-known:  Marc Chagall, El Lissitzky,
Issachar-Ber Ryback, Boris Aronson, Natan Altman, Joseph Tchaikov.  Other
names are less familiar at first glance -- e.g., Sarah Shor, Mark Epstein,
Iosif Elman.  But those who have perused Yiddish children's books or
examined Yiddish magazines from that period (such as Freyd) will recognize
their handiwork.

Quite a few of the reproductions come from books and magazines,
demonstrating the close collaboration between writers and visual artists
associated with the Kultur-Lige.  And, as Kazovsky points out, these
artists' output was a synthesis of folk art and traditional Jewish symbols,
with such modernist approaches as expressionism and cubism.  This was the
new Jewish art, par excellence.

The Artists of the Kultur-Lige includes an extensive introduction, providing
background on both the Kultur-Lige and its Arts Section.  The book is
completely bilingual - English and Russian - and the publishers are to be
thanked for that.  Editorial and proofreading standards are more
consistently applied in the introduction than in the section where most of
the illustrations appear. (E.g., David Hofstein [Dovid Hofshteyn] becomes
Gofstein [in English] -- even though the book accompanying this caption
shows clearly the Yiddish spelling Hofshteyn.)  Still, all things
considered, this is a very minor drawback.

Where to find this book?  How to get it?  For the moment, only a couple of
libraries list it in their catalogues.  The hope is that it will be picked
up by Judaica booksellers and museum shops.  I have also placed an order
with a Slavic bookseller in Redwood City, Szwede, who stocks many of the
worthy publications issued jointly by Mosty Kul'tury and Gesharim.  For the
record, Stanford acquired its copy from a bookseller in Munich.

The National Yiddish Book Center is conducting a search for an educator in
the field of Yiddish and Jewish studies, who will hold our endowed position
of Goldfarb Chair.  This important position will be critical in helping the
Center bring Yiddish literature and culture to a large and diversified
audience.

The holder of the Goldfarb Chair will be the Center's primary Yiddish

summer internship program for college students.

The requirements for the position are: fluency in Yiddish; deep knowledge of
Yiddish literature and culture; professional experience in educational
settings such as colleges, museums, or other cultural organizations;
excellent communication and organizational abilities; teaching experience.
We seek someone with an advanced degree in Jewish or Yiddish Studies or
related fields.  Most important, we seek someone with demonstrated
commitment to Yiddish culture and a genuine interest in helping a largely
non-Yiddish-speaking public appreciate the culture's range and depth.

This is a full-time professional position with a competitive salary and
excellent benefits; start date is flexible. Please send resume to: Anne
Atherley, Goldfarb Search, National Yiddish Book Center, 1021 West Street,

Subject: Looking for two I.B. Singer stories

I'm trying to track down in Yiddish the following two stories by I.B. Singer
and can only find them in English.  "Disguised" in The Death of Methuselah
and "Two" in Old Love.  Does anyone know where I might find copies of these
stories?  I've consulted Roberta Saltzman's new bibliography and even talked
to her in person, but no leads.  The first story was translated by Joseph
Singer and the second by Deborah Menashe, if that helps in providing
contacts.

Thanks,
Warren Hoffman

Subject: "Antlofn fun Varshe"

During the first three months of 1940, "Antlofn fun Varshe" (Escape from
Warsaw) was produced regularly at one of the Yiddish theatres in London's
East End.  The production was advertised in 'Di Tzait' as being extremely
topical. Unfortunately, there was no mention of authorship and even the
British Library cannot track it down for me.  I am wondering whether anyone
knows where I might be able to locate a copy.  It would be pertinent to mt
study of East End Jewry's responses to the Holocasut during 1938-1946 - as I
am also looking at cultural activites which might have some bearing on the
topic.

Subject: Ivre taytsh

I am looking for information about Ivre taytsh, particularly as used in
Tsene Rene, the Torah commentary for women. I have seen it described as a
stylized archaic form of Yiddish. I sometimes have seen it described as a
word for word translation from Hebrew into Yiddish (but with no attempt to
translate into Yiddish grammatical form).

I have also found another description. In "A Bridge of Longing: the lost art
of Yiddish storytelling," David Roskies describes Ivre taytsh as a form of
Yiddish with more modern (square) typeface and vocalization marks making it
more accessible to men. I recently purchased a copy of Tsene Rene from the
NYBC. It is written in what appears to be Yiddish, but with liberal use of
vowel markings (in a completely redundant fashion, if one is familiar with
Yiddish). For example, "geven" has ayins for the vowel sounds but also adds
the 3 dot vowel point below the letters (never used in Yiddish). This sounds
like the latter definition, but I have seen the former in at least a couple
different sources.

I would appreciate any information or references anyone can give me about
Ivre taytsh.

a sheynem dank,
Yoyne Freer
