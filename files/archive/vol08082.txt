Subject: Beside myself

I can't understand anyone's equanimity when confronted with the
accusation
that Yiddish is irrelevant, especially coming from a person with so much
influence in the Yiddish circle of workers.  I have spent years digging and
coming up with what I believe are hard-won trophies.  My area is
specialized
and limited, but still a contribution to the world of Yiddish.  To hear that
"it is irrelevant" makes me outraged.  To hear that the legacy in the
language of millions so recently the victims of outrageous opinions about
Yiddish is "irrelevant" makes me very angry.  If others are not angered,
that is their business. 

One mendelyaner thought it was somebody else making such angy
comments.  It
was not anybody else.  Just one person, me.  On the other hand, I was
beside
myself with anger.  So who knows?

Subject: Comments about Prof. Ruth Wisse

I have restrained myself for a long time from joining this thread, but I'm
glad that Morrie Feller has spoken up about the relentless bashing of Ruth
Wisse that goes on here.  I disagree completely with Ruth Wisse's politics
(conservative) and religion (orthodox), but she is a serious scholar of
Yiddish literature who loves the Yiddish language, culture, and literature,
and who has promoted that love and scholarship in her students.  I believe
her views on the demise of the language and Yiddishkeit in general are
motivated by a profound grief at witnessing their decline in her lifetime. 
To blame Ruth Wisse for harming these things that she has devoted her
life
to studying and teaching is completely out of line.  It takes courage to see
that your culture, which you loved, has died out and to face that grief with
wide open eyes.  I knew before that it took courage to face the grief, and
now I realize it also takes courage to bring down on yourself the wrath of
people who would rather blame you for destroying the thing than face the
reality that it's gone.  All that remains are a few scholars, some nostalgic
old cranks like myself, and the haredim, who will disagree completely with
everything I say. 

If you don't agree with me that it's dead, I hope at least you'll take to
heart Morrie's admonition about being vicious.

Subject: Galitsyaner and Litvak - culinary

If I'm not mistaken, Litvakes don't eat or cook with tomatoes, while
Galitzyaners do. 

Also, the "gefilte fish boundary line" mentioned by Marjorie Schonhaut
Hirshan extends to kugel as well.  Litvakes prefer "fefer kugel" - seasoned
with salt and pepper (and maybe sauteed onions or gribenes - yum!) but
no
sugar or raisins; Galitzyaners (and Hungarians)  make sweet kugel -
known in
my family as "keegel" to distinguish it from what we know as kugel.  :-) 

Finally, I've never heard of a Galitzyaner who made retakh mit shmaltz -
sliced red (or better, diced black) radishes and diced onions mixed with
chicken (or duck) fat and seasoned with salt and pepper.  My late wife
used
to make it for her father as forshpays for shabbos lunch - instant
heartburn!

Subject: Litvak and Galitz

A song "Litvak and Galitz" was recorded by Harriet Kane with Marty Levitt
orchestra on one of theirs "King of Klezmers" tapes. The song is a funny
"potato - potahto" paraphrase (or other way around - I don't know which
one
was written earlier) and contains among the others a dozen of lines like:

I say muter - he says miter,
I say puter - he says piter,
etc.

The tape insert does not mention the authors of this (and other) songs, 
but according to Freedman Archive database
(http://al.cs.engr.uky.edu/raphael-cgi-bin/yidsong.cgi) the author is  
Hymie Jacobson.

Subject: pasik gonif

Can anyone tell me if they have heard the phrase "pasik gonif" literal
translation "belt thief"  The Yiddish speaker who used this phrase said it
was the same as calling someone a city slicker, with implications of
slyness, someone who would sell some poor slob from the shetyl the
Brooklyn
Bridge. The Yiddish speaker who used the phrase learned Yiddish in
Warsaw,
Poland prior to World War II. I am interested in any information on the
phrase, derivation etc.

Subject: Finding Aaron Lebedeff

Can anyone please direct me to information about the life and circle of
singer Aaron Lebedeff? ANd if you know where I can find the words to any
of
his songs (aside from Rumania, Rumania), I'd appreciate learning about it. 
Thank you.

Subject: John Glenn

For the benefit of the younger subscribers to Mendele, some of whom may
not
even have been born when John Glenn went into orbit 36 years ago, I
should
like to repeat a story that was making the rounds in 1962.  Glenn had just
landed after being the first person to circumnavigate the earth.  Mrs. Bloom
had her radio on as all the stations were announcing his safe landing after
three successful trips around the globe in a spacecraft.  Later that morning
she meets Mrs. Goldberg. 

Mrs. Bloom (excitedly):  "Hostu gehert az John Glenn iz arumgeforn di velt
dray mol!!"

Mrs. Goldberg (unimpressed):  "Nu, az me hot gelt - fort men."
