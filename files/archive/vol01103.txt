great. so i'm supposed to believe that boston yinglish
influenced brooklyn yinglish?! we should live so long...
(and there were not a high proportion of litvaks in
brooklyn, that i know of. the fancy jews were german and of
course didn't speak yiddish.)

also, if it's litvak in origin, it should be babi or bobi,
never bubi, which is what it was.

the mystery remains...

Subject: "Sitnik"

A question on the grenitz of language and cuisine that I
hope Mendele might accommodate: My parents speak of a
mechayeh of a bread they used to eat in Riga called
"sitnik." Can anyone tell me what this is/was? Best would
be a recipe, of course, or reference to one.

Re: nasalization: the exception to the sequence
patah--hataph-patah as the explanation for nasalization is
th word "daanges/daynges"  'worries'. There still remains
the issue of Sephardic nasalization of ayin which yields
'ngayin'  for the name of the letter itself (in Holland,
for example), as well as forms like 'yetser harang', etc.
(see Primo Levi, for example, in the Periodic Table). Dutch
Yiddish also sports words like 'neshires', 'nevejre'
alonside their Ashkenazic Hebrew equivalents: 'neveyrO'
etc. These  probably differ from modern Eastern Yiddish 'a
neveyre', etc. which probably derive by metanalysis from
'an aveyre'.

In re koyletsh:  The Polish word kolacz mentioned by
Margaret Mikulska has its counterparts elsewhere in Slavic
(e.g. Russian kalach, a specially shaped white wheat bread;
Slovak kolac [with a hacek, as in Dvorak, over the c],
which is the generic term for cake).  But it's the
Ukrainian kolach, which can refer to white bread in
general, that probably brings us closer to Yiddish
koyletsh. Note the following from the original Mendele's
"Di alte mayse" (cited in M. Kosover's article in the Yuda
A. Yofe-bukh, p. 125): "Dervayl, in dem groysn tararam,
kumt grod eyner a melamed fun yene vayte mekoymes dort
ergets in Volin ... un varft arayn in dem shmues fremde,
volinishe verter.  Anshtot [...] 'krupnik' -- 'kolish', un
'kitke' heyst bay im 'koyletsh'."   (Kosover has a lot
more, including citations from Rashi, but I don't have the
time--or enough Hebrew--to summarize it.

In a 1947 article (Yidish shprakh 7:74) on Lithuanian
Yiddish vocabulary, L. Feinberg defines kitke as "a
geflokhtene khale, vos der ukrainer [yid] ruft on
koyletsh."  In his Lithuanian dialect koyletsh is the name
for "a bonde [?], ongefilt mit hakfleysh oder lung, un
gebakn in shmalts.  Es vert gegesn mit yoykh.  Kon oykh
gemakht vern mit kez un gebakn in puter."
