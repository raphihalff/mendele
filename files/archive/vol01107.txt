Subject: Khali, ayin, sissel bread

Here are some inconclusive comments about several
interesting topics that have come up recently in Mendele.
 
(1) khali.  My Litvak grandfather pronounced many, maybe
all, of the words that have final unstressed -e in other
dialects with -i.  He's been gone several years now, but
I'm quite confident about khali, kali, khaneki, matsi,
meydeli, meyshi (Moshe).  He called my daughter Sarah
soreli.  I don't think it was merely a slightly higher and
fronter [e] than in other dialects, and had crossed the
English perceptual boundary to English -i.  It was well
within the range of Yiddish /i/ as in /mit/ 'with' and /vi/
'how'.
 
(2) Hebrew ayin.  If not for Khaim Bochner's mention of
yandes and bansher, in which Yiddish has /n/ where Hebrew
has hey or alef plus khatef patakh, I too would have
thought the /n/ in Yankev, ma:nse had something to do with
ancient Hebrew ayin.  Nowadays phoneticians can drop little
fiber-optic TV lenses into the back of your throat to watch
you pronounce things from the inside (Ameriki ganef, my
zeydi used to say).  They've demonstrated that in
pronouncing a pharyngeal ayin as in Arabic or Middle
Eastern Hebrew the back of the tongue retracts, narrowing
the pharynx, and also the epiglottis tilts down to
partially close the pharynx.  It seems to me that speakers
could have accompanied or replaced this with a gesture that
is articulatorily not too different: tilting down the velum
(soft palate) allowing air to pass from the pharynx into
the nose, producing a nasalized vowel.
 
(3) Sissel bread.  Here's a wild guess.  Yesterday my aunt
gave us some special seeds for our bird feeder.  The
package was marked Niger, but she mentioned they are in
fact ... THISTLE!  They're small and black, but I don't
know whether they're edible by humans.  Incidentally, she
and her husband, both from New York, but one a Litvak and
the other a Galitsyaner, remember bread and rolls with what
they pronounce as tsharnetshkes, but which other people
called, in a near-perfect calque, "little black seeds".
She can't say whether they were the same as the bird seeds.
By the way, a friend mentions that sissel bread was sold
15-20 years ago in Newton, Mass.

Subject: Nasalization

A thought on nasalization. All the examples you cite could
be due to regressive assimilation. I don't know the
original forms, but "s" and "d" are both dental consonants.
Whatever originally preceded them may have assimilated that
dental quality, yielding "n". That might explain "manse" or
"yandes".
 
The example "Yankev", presumably from "Yaakov" could
involve assimilation of a velar quality: i.e. "k" to "ng"
(written "n"). Do you say "Ya[N]kev" or "Ya[NG]kev"?
 
Don't know about "bansher". Perhaps the "n" there was a
gutteral variant.
 
Fred.
