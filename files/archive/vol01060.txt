i.e., to Robert (Bob) Goldberg =  nissen refoeyl ben yitskhak
leyb.

Aside from being an MD and a computer man, aren't you also a
clarinetist? Klezmer? Didn't we meet in '87? At Yael's? Weren't
you planning to hear the Borodin Trio soon thereafter? If the
answer to any of these questions is "yes", hello Bob and
Charlotte; and, mazltov! If not, hello anyway.

Mikhl Herzog

Subject: Kind words

The other day, in wishing Yankel Kessler a good trip,
I wrote: 'af a gute sho'.  I could have added: 'af a
mazeldike sho'.  Either way, the  incantations are
interesting because they reveal how deeply ingrained such
heterodox practices are among Jews, just as they are in
most non-Jewish cultures.  In addition, it seems to me but
I'm not sure that such expressions are more likely to be
used by women than by men.  If true, there's a ready-made
explanation; but first, is it true?

So I ask Mendele's subscribers to search their memories
and help me compile a list of Yiddish blessings and
expressions of good will.  For good measure we may as well
compile a list of curses and expressions of ill will.  In
addition, please indicate who in your experience uses the
phrase: M (men only), W (women only), B (both),  NA (not
sure).

And since it's Erev Yom Kippur, it's fitting to send a
non-heterodox g'mar khsime toyve to all.

Noyekh
