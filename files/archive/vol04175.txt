Subject: Introduction

Hello. My home is in Carbondale, IL. I like dogs, cats, and music. Just
one comment. My impression has been that a main feature of Yiddish is
that it developed partly at least due to the fact that Jews used Hebrew
characters to write their languages. Thus, apropos romanization, it seems
that the converse should be of interest. Namely, how to write English
(e.g.) using Hebrew characters.

Subject: Jewish American Immigrant Literature

The Boulder Yiddish Vinkl will meet Sunday, November 13, 1994 at 1 p.m. at
Bonai Shalom.  Robin Jones, a Ph.D. candidate in American literature who
teaches Jewish-American literature at C.U. (University of Colorado) will
discuss Jewish-American works, autobiographies and novels which describe
the early life of Jewish immigrants, their struggles with language,
American culture and assimilation.

For further information, contact Debra Halperin Biasca,
biasca@colorado.edu.

Subject: Prokofiev

I'd like to respond to Dan  Leeson's post about the Prokofiev piece
which he recently heard performed by Russian Immigrants.  The name of the
piece was given as " Overture on *Yiddish* Themes", although Dan had
previously heard it called "Overture on *Hebrew* Themes."

I think  Mendelniks have previously discussed the confusion between
speaking "Jewish" (like  my parents did) rather than "Yiddish" (like I
try to do) which has occurred in the US.  I have noticed this issue
cropping up in Russian before-- confusion (mine?) confusion between the
terms for 'Hebrew' and 'Yiddish.'

The first time, I was tutoring an immigrant from Leningrad and talking to
her about some Yiddish expressions (her grandmother spoke Yiddish but she
didn't).  She and her husband then had a discussion amongst themselves
about whether I was talking about 'Idish' or 'Ivrit.'  The husband had
no language to associate with "Idish" as I recall; and there was general
confusion as to how we could distinguish between 'Hebrew' and 'Yiddish'
in Russian.

I also noticed a comment by Aaron Lansky in the Pakn Trager a couple
years back when he was delivering books in the former Soviet Union
somewhere (exactly where?) and someone said to him 'Ivrit?' and he took
it to mean 'Hebrew', I think.  I had the feeling that Mr. Lansky and the
Russian speaker did not have the same understanding about this word.
Perhaps another Mendelnik still has the Pakn Trager and can clarify.

Finally, there is a current publication  published in Moscow in Russian
and Yiddish.  On one side of the journal we find Cyrillic characters
which I'd transliterate as 'Ebreiskaya Ulitsa' while on the other side,
in undze r tayere yidishe oysyes, we find 'Yidishe Gas.'

This is just like the titles noted by Dan Leeson for the Prokofiev
piece, isn't it, where 'Yiddish' is the English equivalent of 'Hebrew' in
Russian?

Can anyone comment on the possibility of a dual naming system in Russian
like we had/have in the US for the Yiddish language (Jewish vs Yiddish)?
For  Jewish people in general (unless this is not an appropriate subject
for Mendele)?  For example, in France, they call me an Israelite  rather
than 'Juive.'

Are these are related issues?  Are they, perhaps, part of a
euphemism/dysphemism process which we have also seen applied to other
minority groups?

Comments?

Subject: Prokofiev overture

The Prokofiev overture should really be called "on Yiddish themes" since
that is what it is. He used in a very prominant place a rather well known
Yiddish folk song "Zayzhe dir gezunt mayne tayer eltern" which he learned
from his NYC room-mate and prominant Yiddish theater actor, Boris
Tomashevsky. I suspect that several other melodies were also Yiddish
songs of the same provinance however I am not able to idntify them
explicitly.

While I'm on the subject of music, some time ago there was a discussion
of the Shostakovitch work of a similar sort. In that case the songs were
composed by Shostakovitch in a very powerful and moving way keeping
strongly to the mood and sentiment of the Yiddish folk poems, several of
which were known to be set to their own folk music. I have heard at least
two of them performed on records. One had the refrain "Ot, ot, ot azoy
est di tsieg fun dakh di hoy."  I was wondering if anyone would know a
reference where I could track down the entire song.

The second song is of some interest with regard to the discussion of
"petshke". In that song the refrain is from a young man to his shy girl
friend to "gib mir dayne pishkeynu" meaning of course her mouth
...evidently derived from the diminutive of the Hebrew "pe". Could it be
that the use of petchke for chin has a similar etymology?

Subject: Bunke

_bunke_ (pronounced by the locals [bunki]) is a 'teapot' in the language
of Yiddish-speakers in the towns between Bialystok and Grodno (and other
places as well?).  My grandmother, from Sukhovolye (Polish:  Suchowola)
told me that _bunki_ was what it was called in her town, but when she
visited Grodne as a child, she learned that the locals there called it a
_lyak_.  Sukhovolye is a neighbor of Yashenofki (Polish:  Jasiono'wka)
and Grayvi (Polish:  Grajewo).

Subject: A note on double consonants

Note that the Romanization/transliteration/transcription system that we
have (and a yasher-koyekh for working on it and making it public!) needs
a pitsinke refinement:  double consonants ARE okay when they reflect the
meeting of two morphemes, one which ends with the same letter that the
other begins with.  (If you're not familiar with the term, a morpheme can
be defined very loosely as a 'piece of a word'.)  So the correct
transwhatever-you-call-it-ization is

farrekhenen		and not 	farekhenen
onnemen			and not 	onemen
mittantsn		and not 	mitantsn

even though, in fact, the consonants are pronounced as if only one were
present.

The spelling of such complex words with only one consonant (as in the
second column of the "chart") was one of the inovations (sic!) of the
Soviet Yiddish spelling system.  The eradication of the final letters and
the phonemicization of the spelling of words of Semitic origin get the
most attention; but this too was one of the radical moves of the Soviet
Yiddish spelling system.  (I doubt anyone will be able to project any
anti- Zionist, anti-Hebrew, anti-Hebraist, anti-religious, anti-Jewish-
traditionalist reasons behind _this_ move, as people often do for the
other, more blatant, changes.)
