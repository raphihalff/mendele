In answer to David Braun's query...I do not understand much
Yiddish.  I copies from the paper exactly as it was
scribbled.

Subject: minor quibble

David Braun writes:

" _bis_ is the unit being bitten into, swallowed, digested,
" etc., or the nominalization of the action.  _bays_ is the
" nominalization (noun-form) of the action (from the verbal
" stem; _baysn_ is the infinitive):
"
"       ikh vil a bis shokolad
" but:
"  	der hunt hot mir gegebn a bays/bis

Judging from the first example, I would not say that _bis_
is "the unit bitten into" etc. but a certain quantity of
that unit, first a quantity bitten off, then, by extension,
a small quantity whose size is such that it might have been
bitten off (when I say "first" I mean, without knowing if
it's true, that this was historically the first use).  So
"nominalization of the action" is perhaps not the best way
of putting it (especially since _bays_ is also described as
"nominalization (noun-form) of the action".  My hunch is
that there was one noun meaning `bite', as in the hunt
example (notice that both _bays_ and _bis_ are used in that
meaning) and that _bis_ in the quantity meaning was a
specialization of that (metonymy or what not). French has
two words for the two meanings: _morceau_ (`bite-size
quantity', see Engl. `morsel') and _morsure_ (`bite').

A question of interest (at least to someone willing to
assume that category boundaries may be fuzzy) would be to
ask at what point the quantity noun _bis_, which is
followed by a mass noun of the category `noun phrase' and
forms with it a complex noun phrase, parsed as [a bis
[shokolad]] or [un morceau [de chocolat]] becomes, or
starts to be perceived as, a non-nominal quantifier
expression, especially in its diminutive form (bis-l,
mors-el) parsed as [a bis(l) shokolad] where there is only
one noun phrase left.  Notice that Fr. _morceau_ could have
gone that way but didn't (hasn't?).  _zwey bisl shokolad_
sounds odd (I assume), but _deux morceaux de chocolat_ is
fine.

Subject: Yiddish as a cause

Am I correct in assuming that we are all supporters
of YIVO and the National Yiddish Book Center?  Pro-
bably.  But if one of you has by chance lost the
addresses and wants to write them (or better yet send
money), here they are:

YIVO Institute for Jewish Research
1048 Fifth Ave.
New York, NY 10028

National Yiddish Book Center
P.O. Box 969
Old East Street School
Amherst, MA 01004

The NYBC is being evicted from the Victorian school
building that they've occupied for the last ten years, so
they need financial help for the move over and above their
usual requirements.

While on the subject of helping the cause of Yiddish, I
should mention the League for Yiddish (200 W. 72 St., New
York, NY 10023) which publishes a quarterly, _Afn Shvel_,
edited by Mordkhe Spektor.  The most recent issue is
particularly worth a look, this being the magazine's 50th
anniversary.  The cover page includes a repro of Vol. I No.
1 (it was called _Oifn Shvel_ then and put out 12 copies
for a buck).  The subtitle reads: Tzaytshrift far dem
Territorialistishn Gedank.  Does everybody remember those
days?  Membership these days is $15.

I don't have handy any current information about another
organization worth supporting, the Workmens Circle.
Members who know are encouraged to write.

Did I miss some group?  Shemt zikh nisht: shraybt vos
gikher.  

*********************

It also occurs to me that Mendele can easily serve as a
medium for news and notices about things Yiddish: books,
meetings, summer schools, etc.  And while we're at it, why
not at least an occasional review or even review article?
Yiddish scholarship is amazingly alive for all those death
announcements and Mendele's readers are a perfect audience.

Why not give it a try?  Would someone be willing to do a
review, for instance, of Benjamin Harshav's recent _The
Yiddish Language_?

P.S. Kh'hob shir nisht fargessen: avade, Berl un Dovid un
Khaim, _gefrishte_ matse vert oykh ongerufn 'matzo-brei'.
Ober s'iz faran an untershid: mir hobn nisht genutst putter
