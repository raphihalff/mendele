Subject: Introduction

Some of you may recall my occasional comments from Moscow last year.  Now
we're in Warsaw.  I am now Director of Research and Archives of The
Ronald S. Lauder Foundation, a private, U.S.-based foundation doing
educational and cultural work in Central Europe.  My task here is to
assist the Jewish Historical Institute of Poland in its library, archives
and expanding museum of Polish Jewish history and culture, in  a variety
of ways.  My wife, Helise Lieberman, is also a Foundation employee, and
she will, be-ezras HaShem, be opening Warsaw's first Jewish elementary
school in decades this fall.  (THe foundation has supported a kinder-
garten for nearly four years already.)  It's quite exciting.  I welcome
queries on Poland or Lithuania. Zayt mir gezint.  I look forward to
fruitful collaboration and enjoyable discussion.

Subject: Introduction

I wish I could write to you in Yiddish but I don't have a command of the
language. I came from Yiddish speaking parents and I have a profound love
of the language and its literature. I'm not sure what you send though the
system but my Mom is still alive and 88 yrs. old and I'm sure she would
enjoy your stories even if tranliterated. I read about you in Hadassah
magazine. Thanks.

Subject: Introduction

I have been lurking on this list for months and want to take advantage of
our shames' suggestion to share information of a Jewish cultural nature.
My name is Paula Horwitz; I was born of Jewish parents and raised in a
secular home. The only Yiddish spoken in my midst was when my parents
conversed and it wasn't meant for my ears. However, being a native New
Yorker I have a limited vocabulary of Yinglish. I also have a strong
sense of Jewish identity and therefore have been enjoying the numerous
informative discussions by the many learned people who so avidly
contribute their knowledge to this list. In fact I have shared several of
those messages with my friends and family.

Subject: pro drop

To Ellen Prince and Bob Rothstein:

I just read the evidences of pro drop cited by bob Rothstein from
Zaretski, and strikingly enough they were all from Der Nister, but for
one instance. Having translated Der Nister myself and having spent lots
of time wondering about his style, I would just be cautious about
accepting these quotes as general evidence for Yiddish as a whole. Der
Nister developped a very idiosyncratic style, dropping many things, for
example also articles in places where no Yiddish speaker would have done
so. These examples testify to the creative poetic intentions of Der
Nister, but I think they cannot be used as evidence for such a  use in
spoken or written Yiddish otherwise.

Subject: Kibitz about Kibosh

Dan Kirschner asks (4.012) about possible Yiddish etymology for "kibosh."
This question has been around for a long time and has not, to my
knowledge, been entirely resolved.  I just wanted to mention that
Leo Rosten, in his book, THE JOYS OF YIDDISH, spends page after page (see
entry for "kibosh") citing sources that say that kibosh is, isn't, or
might be from Yiddish.  No-one seems to have a credible Yiddish etymology
for it. His discussion ends with the written equivalent of a throwing up
of the hands.  He seems to feel it's not Yiddish; it just feels Yiddish.

I think "kibosh" needs to be added to the dictionary of Yiddish "wannabes"
along with words like umbrella (accent on FIRST syllable, please!), spatula,
and -- my personal favorite -- farfetched.      :)

Subject: Yiddish comics

I have recently discovered a comic book in Yiddish by Will Eisner, "An
opmakh mit got - a grafisher novele fun Will Eisner". It is a very nice
yiddish story published in many languages before it finally appeared in
its original yiddish version in 1984. It was published as a special
edition by the "Strip-Antikvariat Lambik" in Amsterdam.

If anybody is interested, I can provide the address of the comic store
where I found the book in Germany.

Does anybody know about more comics in yiddish, eventually of comics with
yiddish/jewish topics???

Subject: Pronouncing vav ("and") before bilabials

Oyver botl again.  In the takeoff on "Brother, Can You Spare A Dime"
published in the Yiddish Forverts on May 13, the expression is spelled
ayin-vov-veys-reysh  vov-[b]veys-tes-lamed.  The question is, how should
the second word and its prefix be pronounced?  /v'botl/ sounds right to
me, and to fellow Mendelenik Chaim Rosmarin.  But I've been told that in
Hebrew the vav meaning "and" is pronounced /u/ before bilabials, with /b/
going to /v/ (and /p/ going to /f/).  This would mean /uvotl/, I believe.
Is Yiddish bound by the rule?  IS it a rule?  A dank.  Un gut shabes
alemen.
