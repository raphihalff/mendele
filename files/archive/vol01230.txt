Hershl Bershadi, that is truly important work.  Varnish as
a "Yiddish" word reminded me of the "gornisht hens" my
grandmother would prepare.  And she served them and
referred to them in this way in full earnest.  Not to
mention the "Segal pears". Lang lebn zol der griner
english!

Bob Werman, are you sure you can be Person A (i.e., the
greeter, as opposed to the greetee) and greet your
interlocutor with _gut-yor_ (not on rosheshone, that is)?
Walking up to someone and being the first to speak and
saying _gut-yor_ seems very odd to me.  Have you heard
this, or is it just the "logical" thing you thought of for
when you need a neutral term for two people, one still
shabesdik and the other vokhedik?

English - Yiddish words a la Hershel Bershady.  And another
kind, too.  For example, it was many years that I realized
that "aggravate" was not a purely Yiddish word.  And the
English subvariety had a rather different meaning, "make
worse" instead of "annoy."

Subject: Yidlish omissions

Tom Wasow reminds me of three other words I neglected to
mention. (It was only a short list...): perusal,
crankshaft, shin splints. These were discovered in the
early days -- 30 years ago in the wilds of Mad.

Subject: Yidlish

re Hershel Bershady's list of Yiddish sounding English
words (1.228, Yidlish):

My favorites are conniption and ladle - words I never use
in non-Jewish circles. (cf Alex Portnoy's discussion of
this phenomenon.)
