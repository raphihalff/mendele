Noyekh,
 
In my relative seclusion, the news about Bashevis
reached me through you. It will be interesting to see
just when I will learn of it in some other way. Thank
you MENDELE. Lomir ober hern besere bsures. Would you
be good enough to provide some details.  There still
remains an important link, by the way; Avrom Sutzkever,
zol er lebn un zayn gezunt.
 
In explanation for my "seclusion", I offer the excuse
of total immersion in preparing the Yiddish dialect
Atlas for publication.  I'm delighted to tell you that
I've just completed the manuscript of Volume 1, and am
off to the publisher, with volume (& disk) in hand, on
August 5. If all goes well, I'll tell you "all about
it" (and about Volumes 2 & 3) right after Rosheshone.
 
Concerning Yiddish Fayvush, I "prefer" "Phoebus" only
because I want to spread the honors around: Khayim is
already represented by "Faytl" (often disguised as
Vidal, Vitali/y, etc. I don't have any other basis for
choosing between Phoebus and vivus, although "the folk"
(whoever they are) have made their choice through the  
pairing with Shrage, in Ivrit, with Uri. By the way, I
think that Edward Stankiewicz, who writes about Yiddish
names in "The Field of Yiddish", vol. 3, also prefers
"vivus".
 
zay gezunt,
 
Mikhl
 
PS: I wrote the above at about 7 pm on Thursday. At 8 I
received a telephone call from the city and, among
other things, had to elicit the news of IBS's death.
"It was all over the Times this morning, etc." Of
course, the Times I read this morning was the early
edition, which reminded me of a story worth retelling,
particularly for anyone out there who knew a dear
friend, now deceased, Alexander ("Olek") Erlich. He was
an economist at Columbia University, grandson of Shimon
Dubnow, and son of . . .  he was once introduced by an
overenthusiastic chairman as "the son of Erlich and
Alter". Driving him home late one night, I stopped to
pick up "tomorrow's" New York Times and asked him if
he'd like a copy. In his inimitable, Russian accented,
precise English bass, he replied that he had stopped
buying the early edition of the Times since he had once
spent a whole day at home without knowing that Hitler
had invaded the Soviet Union.

*************************
Slicha, Raphael, un a dank dir, Dovid Sherman.  It
appears that the editor has goofed again and rendered
Raphael's beautiful Yiddish characters illegible.  
Af Yidish iz beser gezogt: ikh hob fun zey gemakht
blote.  Here's another try.
*************************

1. yidtype.c.

If you compile the program using a C compiler, you will
have some software that will turn input looking like

     a SAneM dank

into output looking like


 ___ _  _ _ ____    ____  _ _ _  _ _  _ _ _    _ _
 , /  | ,\|    |    |  |  | |  |  | | | | |    ,\|
 |/  _| |_\    |    |__| _|/  _|      |/_/     |_\
 |

If you also have the 'sed' program available, then
using recast.sed will let you type in the more legible

    a sheynem dank
and get the same result.

If you don't have C available, the program is useless.


2.  Borukh-habe.  Might be the origin of 'brouhaha',
but it is in doubt. I expect that 'copacetic' really
does come from 'kol beseder', however.

3.  Shrage-fayvel.  The fact that the two are combined
implies to me that they are synonymous.  I trust the
Phoebus version.  I dimly recollect that Phoebus and
Apollo were not always the same.  Even if Shrage is a
relexification (what a great word!) for Uri, it still
means light.
