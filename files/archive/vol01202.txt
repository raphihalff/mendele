Henry Mullish: Your version of that "blessing" is
interesting. It seems to have reinterpreted a Slavic word
into Hebrew. Hebrew "beten" is 'stomach' but, as I
understand the phrase (which I did not hear from my
mother), it's "gey ke benye matri" (Will some Slavist
please reinterpret?) and its reference is NOT to the
'stomache'. Aside from discovering the phrase in the
Yemenite repertoire you say nothing about having discovered
what it means. Whadayasay?

Dan Breslauer: Forgive me, I didn't mean to be "advising".
Welcome!

is "gey kebetten materi" used in yiddish?  am i late to a
diuscussion here? in hebrew, it tends to be pronounced
"kibini mat" (which almost makes it sound like an
upside-down bathing suit), but the russian original is "k
yabinoy materi" (which i will leave untranslated unless
asked).

please note that this change would be morphological, not
syntactic, since np -> np pp was always grammatical in
hebrew. (i.e. a noun phrase consisting of a noun phrase and
a prepositional phrase.)

in addition, a language cannot 'turn
indo-european'--indo-european is a genetic classification.
a language can come to look more like an indo-european lg
than like another type of language, which is frequently the
case where there is significant language contact,
(actually, one of the most famous examples of this is in
your native language! i'm thinking of emeneau's stuff on
dravidian/indic constituting a 'linguistic area' with
certain common features.) but a language cannot 'become'
indo-european. the issue with wexler's claims is whether
hebrew IS indo-european, genetically, not whether it has
borrowed certain elements from indo-european.

furthermore, i may be wrong on this, but i think i recall
reading something about an analogous change in modern
arabic.

finally, neither yiddish nor slavic would say 'the book of
the boy'. both would use genitive case-marking, not a
prepositional phrase. so a yiddish or slavic explanation
for the hebrew change would be suspect, to say the least.
(and the fact that both yiddish and slavic use genitive
case-marking in no way suggests that yiddish is
slavic--GERMANIC and slavic use possessive case-marking.
note that you don't really say 'the book of the boy' in
*english*, either, tho you can get closer to it than in any
other germanic language, perhaps due to the powerful
influence of french on middle english.)

I'm an Israeli student studying abroad. I would like to
