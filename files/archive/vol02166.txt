This seems to  me to be unlikely.  While I  have heard
sometimes Meshe (OK Mese) from Litvaks, I have never
come across Moshe in a *Yiddish* usage, only Moishe. 
As an example may serve one of the prominent Mendele
contributors, who signs his name as: David (Daniel
Moishe) Sherman.

Subject: 1920s Vienna Jewish speech

I am currently doing research on Vienna Jewish speech
during the 1920s-30s. Specifically, I am looking at the
NATIVE German language of V(ienna) Jews--that is, not the
German of the Jewish population that was native
Yiddish-speaking, and for whom German was clearly a
(later-acquired) second language.  Rather, this concerns
those V Jews--usually V-born, or arrived as infants to V
from Galicia, Moravia, etc.--who spoke primarily (if not
exclusively) German.  The written sources I have looked at
thus far on V German offer next to nothing on this--often
for a number of rather interesting ideological reasons;
references to the Hebrew-Aramaic origin component in
Viennese underworld- (and not-so-underworld-)slang often
ascribe to these a Yiddish source, when Rotwelsch is often
more accurate in these cases.

As for the emerging (in the 1920s) group of Jewish native
speakers of German (VJS), however, I at least, have found
very little.  It is fairly clear that this group--the
VJS--did not operate on an identical DIALECT-TO-(AUSTRIAN)
STANDARD-GERMAN continuum as did non-Jewish Viennese
Germans.  (For example, the Jewish model of "Standard"
included a voiced [z]:  wir sind  'we are' :  [vi:r   zint]
-- as opposed to Austrian Standard German  [vi:r  sinD]
{V-dialect:  [mia  sAn]};  that is, the Austrian Standard
of the non-Jews did not contain [z], but (at least many)
Jews' VJS did.)  For Jews (and probably/possibly non-Jews?)
of that period there seems to have been a stake in claiming
that their VJS was:  (1) "not at all Yiddish",  and (2)
"not (German) dialect."

I would like to get closer to answers for two main
questions about VJS:  (1) Since (different varieties of)
Yiddish was overwhelmingly the substrate for VJS, what may
be seen as the nature and extent of that Yiddish influence
(at all levels--phonologiy (including intonation), syntax,
etc.)--that is, not just lexical items;   (2) to the extent
that VJS had--consciously or unconsciously--a model of
non-dialectal German that was not an Austrian model. WHAT
WAS that German model--geographically, sociolinguistically,
etc.  (It has been suggested to me a possible Prague German
(Prague JEWISH German?) model. AAAny thoughts, sources,
help on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

I should add that I have already consulted Leopold
Schnitzler's (1966)  Prager Judendeutsch.    Schnitzler
says that Prague Judendeutsch is overwhelmingly of Bavarian
dialect origin.  (Thus, Schnitzler discusses a general
problem with "s" sounds--written without consistency--as
zayin, samekh, sin--{though this should probably be looked
at in the context of the general, larger problem of s - z -
ts  in Yiddish linguistics). )  The Bavarianness of Prague
Judendeutsch potentially makes it a bit more difficult to
discern from Austro-Bavarian of Vienna, but that remains to
be looked at further.  It could be, however, that if there
indeed was a Prague-German model for VJS speakers, it was a
19th- or 20th-century non-Jewish model.

In general--beyond my concern with VJS--the Prague-Vienna
connection is interesting:  location on same historical
trade route,  the Landau/Wachstein Juedische Privatbriefe,
etc.  However, it does not necessarily mean that some type
of Prague German served a the (a?) model for 1920s VJS.

Thanks.

Subject: 1. fier kashes oyf yiddish  2. comprehensibility

1. I'm told that at the age of 4 I asked the kashes in
Yiddish and that I was enormously cute. This was 61 years
ago and unfortunately I recall nothing of it.

2. A joke my mother told me hinges on the (apparent) fact
that the word "fella" (or some such) meant a cold (as in
sneezing & coughing) in her Polish dialect of Yiddish.

The joke: A young woman, a recent immigrant to the US
writes to her mother in the old country how well things
were going for her:

".. un ikh geh shoyn arum mit a fella "

The mother's reply:

"Mit a fella geht m' nish arum. Mit a fella geht m' in
bet."

The recent discussion has been most enlightening.
