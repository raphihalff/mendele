Subject: Search for Yiddish author

Around 1940, a Soviet author penned a Yiddish novel based on the biography of
Yechiel-Michl Guzikow, a 19th Century klezmer virtuoso on the xylophone. Does
anyone know the name of this author? Or the title in Yiddish? Please help!

A sheynem dank foroys,

Does anyone know another word in Yiddish for _sweetbreads_ other than
_grashitse_?

Dovid Braun (mayn ershter yidish-lerer!) calls attention to the oddity of
yortsayt being a masculine noun, even though neither of its components are
masculine.  Perhaps yortsayt's gender is masculine because it is a liturgical
calendar event and therefore treated like a yontef, a category of nouns that
for whatever reason defaults to masculine, even when the original Hebrew
gender of the word is feminine (e.g. hannukah yafah, but der prakhtiker
khanike).

[Re: Mendele 14.024]

Like many such words, I believe this to be a slavism, and it comes from the
Russian, "barii" meaning lordly, or exalted.

A 'berye' is someone with the capacity to pull off feats that are difficult,
not necessarily with efficiency, but he (or she) gets it done, where 'mere
mortals' would likely fail. I think it implies a certain amount of daring as
well, since the feat in question may involve a certain amount of risk. The
task also is more likely to be physical than intellectual, but certainly not
exclusively so.

I seriously doubt that this word has any Semitic origin.

[Re: Nicole Taylor's request in 14.024:]

_der onheyber_ by David Bridger was first published in 1947 by Farlag Matones.
The 4th publication was "a fargreserte" and my copy lists 11 publications,
through 1964. It features the brother and sister Berele un Serele. The
Workmen's Circle schools used this book for their begining classes. I taught
with it in the 60s and 70s.20 In 1979 Frida Grapa de Cielak published her
delightful _Arele_ workbook (3) series for young beginners. This is from
Mexico. It was republished 1991.

Subject: Mordecai Richler and Yiddish

I am still working on Mordecai Richler's novels and need your help again. Now
that I have quite a firm grip of the way Richler uses Yiddish in his novels
(apart, of course, from _Barney's Version_, where he seems to do everything
"the wrong way", so this novel is probably going to give me some more
headache), I would like to shift my focus a bit on the Yiddish Richler used
himself. Unfortunately, available criticism has so far not been very helpful
for me in establishing an idea of "how Yiddish Richler actually was". Thus I
am looking for biographic information on Mordecai Richler as a Yiddish
speaker/writer as well as for general information on Yiddish in Canada
(Montreal).

Any help from your part will be greatly appreciated, and I promise a summary
to Mendele.
