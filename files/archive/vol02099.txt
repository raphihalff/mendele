Sholem Aleikhem Ale MENDELnikes|

my name is Shelomoh S. ZIENIUK. i'm a 5th-year student at
the Institute of Applied Linguistics (English & Russian),
Univ. of Warsaw, WARsaw in poLAND, & a 1st-yr student at
the Oriental Institute (Hebrew & Arabic), the same. Now
going to apply for the One Year Programme in Jewish Studies
'93/'94 at the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew
Studies run by Dr David PATTERSON. This would help me
tremendously to complete my M.A. thesis (whose formula is
ISRAEL'S LANGUAGES AT THE DAWN OF JERUSALEM'S
QUADRIMILLENNIUM /'96/) at the U of Warsaw. Here in this
par excellence strange country they've got hardly any
sources related to the topic. my major foci during the
Programme -- provided i'd been accepted -- gonna be the
following diad (subject to slight modifications): (1) the
intensive studying of Yiddish, & (2) digging thru the
library to get anything related to Jewish languages (in
their broadest possible definition, & favourably from a
sociolinguistic prospective).

Could any1 of U Nice-Folks-Over-There-
                Upon-The-River-Mendele be so kind as to
                provide me with:

(i)    the E-mail add of Dr David PATTERSON (Centre's
       Pres.) & Dr Dovid KATZ the Yiddishist (at the same
       place), or any1 else of the staff, &/or

(ii)   practical hints on how to get a sponsor for that
       pleasure worth 9,000 pounds sterling, &/or

(iii)  any other pragmatics about the OCPHS & its
       socio-linguo-mercantile environs, &/or

(iiii) any info on any other scholarship opportunities for
       my M.A. in the U.S. or Israel, right now in advance
       i'm pronouncing: A  SHAYNEM  DANK|

Subject: etymological question

I recently read a commentary that stated "goy" was used in
the old testament to refer to Israel's ancient near eastern
neighbors.  The implication was that "goy" referred to a
national -- a member of a nation. My family always used the
word to refer to Christian, but I think the sense of
belonging to a nation and thus to a "land" was implicit in
designating Christians as goyim.  Who else belonged to a
land (at least in their experience)?  Similar meaning was
implicit, I think, even in Paul Goodman's EMPIRE CITY, when
one of the characters refers to war as "goyim nakhis."
(WHo else but nations go to war?)

In any case, finally, the questions are 1) Does any
Mendelnik know whether there is an etymology in English
that traces the historical usages of the word "goy"? and 2)
if "goy" was indeed once used to refer to a member of a
nation, do any contemporary Israelis now refer to
themselves as goyim? I'd appreciate a few simple leads.  I
stress SIMPLE.  A dank in advance, as they say.

Subject: For Sarah Stein

Once again, you are raising interesting questions.  I would
hold my breath before proceeeding too far with Orientalism,
though. Remember that Orientalism refers to the "other,"
while these shtetl Jews were very deeply "self."
Sometimes, the knowledge that they were "self" led
assimilated Jews to flee with all their might, and
sometimes it resulted in a pang of conscience and a tug
homeward.  The sense that the Jewish community was in peril
- remember the year - also played a role.  I would guess
(just a hunch, but I'm sure the evidence is out there) that
some Jews in the Russian populist movement ended up
themselves feeling alien.  Not only were there definite
strains of antisemitism in Russian populism, but the very
situation (a shtetl Jew telling the Russian farmer how to
live) is fraught with irony.  Some of those "narodnik"
(populist) Jews, sensing the gap, converted to Russian
Orthodoxy in order to merge with the peasants.  Perhaps
An-sky took the other route. Anyhow, I would seek the source
in more traditional places:  in Russian populism (after
all, a concern with the folk, A. just replaced which folk
he meant) and in the nationalism that was overtaking all
the ethnic groups of Europe at the time.  As for the
combination of scepticism and love - surely the scepticism
is a gift from the Haskalah, and from a European education
- love is the other side, prompted once again by a sense of
peril.  Rather than look to Orientalism, look at the
political movements of the day - not only Zionism, but also
movements concerned with diaspora Jews who were expected to
remain.  Good luck.

Subject: "Ostjuden"

Two personal remarks on Sarah Stein's query about Ostjuden.

1. My father who lived in Leipzig during the early 1920s as
an immigrant from Poland told me that the attitude of many
of the established German Jews regarding the burgeoning
antisemitism from the right was: "Sie meinen doch die
Ostjuden."

2. A few years ago at a Jewish film festival, I saw Molly
Picon's first, a silent film originally entitled "Ost und
West" made in Vienna, and which was very much a reaction to
the migration of Galician Jewish refugees to Vienna during
WWI. The Chasidm from the East were portrayed as naive but
charming in their religious practices. Do see it if you get
a chance.
