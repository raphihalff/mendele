Subject: Tsvey kashes

1. Can Ken Maltz or other members of Kapelye on the list tell me if there
are any texts available for their albums (IMHO the best of the "Klezmer"
revival musically, and for overall wit and tam)?  My Yiddish is just not
good enough to make out some of the lyrics, despite the excellent
enunciation; this is frustrating.

2. What is it with the Yiddish purists, trying to construct a language
that was never spoken?  Is Yiddish studies the last great bastion of
prescriptive lexicography?  Isn't Yiddish the language actually spoken by
Yiddish-speakers?  If so, how can a thoroughly folkstimlekh word like
"ekl/ekldik" be considered Daytchmerish, to be replaced by "migldik", a
word so obscure it's not even in Harkavy? [I realize this is several
questions, but they're all related--so I cheated a little]

Subject: Groyser verterbukh fun der yidisher shprakh

Michael Sweet suggested that Mendelnikes might contribute money to help
the publication of the Groyser Verterbukh. I think that this is a
wonderful idea and would be more than happy to participate. I also have
some questions about the dictionary that perhaps some Mendelnikes can
answer. Apparently Yudl Mark began work on the dictionary in 1953. The
first volume appeared in 1961. In 1971 the 3rd volume appeared. Mark
passed away in 1975. Volume 4 appeared 14 years ago, in 1980, but seems
to be still the work of Mark (vol. 4 still has the silent aleph). Three
volumes appeared in the first 17 years. None appeared in the last 14
years. What's going on? Is the project dead? Is anyone working on it?
Does anyone know when/if another volume will appear?

Subject: Unter a grin beymele

Martin Davis cites his mother's song as an instance of beating in Yiddish
music.  He asks if anyone is familiar with this song.  I have heard
another version of this song on a record of Yiddish folksongs by Theodore
Bikel.  I remember only the first few lines:

                Unter a grin beymele
		Zitsn yinglekh tsvey
		Zey redn fun a meydele...

An unrelated question: Does anyone know about the card game played by
adults on Chanukah while children played dreydl?  Is this katoves?  What
is katoves?  What is the origin of this word?

Subject: Graphomania

Entering the literary scene here in Israel more than 20 years ago I found
a great concern about graphomanim or graphomaniacs, people without talent
who felt the compulsion to write and apparently trouble editors and
better writers.

This intolerance was strange to me and not something I remembered on the
American front.  I wrote it off to provincialism [has ve-shalom!] here.
But lately I have heard the word in the mouths of Yiddish speakers and
find it in the Yiddish Stutchkoff.

Can anyone help me with this, Yiddish, Hebrew and cultural origins?
Could it be Turkish.

We use "smutshik" in Yiddish for pacifier.  Or we did, until our youngest
got older and the word disappeared from our vocabulary. Is the difference
between "smu..." and "shmu..." one of dialect?

Subject: Kuni Leml, shmushkele

In response to Dvoyre Halperin Biasca: Kuni Leml, one of Avrom
Goldfaden's most popular characters, with his white hasidic stockings,
ridiculously long peyes, and stutter ("K-K-K-K-Kuni Leml"), was
Goldfaden's incarnation of the long-standing maskilic criticism of
arranged marriages.  In other words, Kuni Leml was every modern-thinking
young Jewish girl's nightmare bridegroom, the khosn from hell.

On what Michael Sweet's mother was referring to when she sang of his
little sister's shmushkele, Arre Komar's suggestion of pacifier is
unconvincing: the Polish word is smoczek (smotshek).
