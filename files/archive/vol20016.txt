Subject: Name that tune!

At least one old Yiddish song is heard on the soundtrack to the short
amateur film found here:

I wonder if anyone recognizes it (them) and might know what is actually
being sung.

Thanks,

Subject: kushers

I think you mean "kashes" (perhaps dialectically pronounced "koshes" -
someone will  have to advise me on that), with no "r" on the end.  I doubt
if that is the same word.

Subject: mestn feld

Dear Yiddish mumkhim,

I am somewhat stumped by the meaning of the expression "mestn feld." How,
if at all, is it different from "mestn kvorim"? I know that both have
magical/apotropaic purposes, but while "mestn kvorim" is easily searchable
in dictionaries and online, the former isn't at all. How was "mestn feld"
done and to what end (to stop an epidemic, for example?)?

Many thanks,
Lena Watson

Subject: Anthology of Polish-Yiddish Poetry: copyright owners sought

The late Professor Joseph Sherman, of Oxford University, wrote deeply
about the matter of the intellectual property rights of this genre, and
the complexities faced by scholars such as Magdalena Ruta.

There is a real need for a central registry, where such information can be
retrieved easily, rather than conducting what is likely to be a painfully
protracted search.
