Subject: What's in a name?

Like Norman Fruman (08.052), I long ago noticed the frequency with which
Jewish boys were given the names of British families.  To his list, one
should add "Howard."  In fact, when as a boy I first heard of the now
forgotten Hollywood film, "The Howards of Virginia," I momentarily assumed
that it was about Howard Smulevitz, Howard Weinberg, and other successful
Richmond merchants.  Then came the flash that led me to speculate as follows. 

American Jews sought to give their sons "assimilated" names of record, for
daily use, as counterparts of their "official" Hebrew names.  The procedure
by which I, authentically Boruch, became Robert, was without doubt
improvisation on my mother's part.  But the Howard epiphany led me to believe
in the existence of an approved list drawn up by American rabbis.  Wishing to
stem a trend that could, if unstopped, lead to the application to Jewish boys
of such names as Matthew, Mark, Luke and John even, a committee of rabbis had
prepared an approved boy-name list composed of names of colonial families. 
These names were unquestionably American, and somehow desirably of English
rather than continental immigrant origin. 

I supposed that two parallel lists might have been made with one running
Anshel, Avrum, Boruch, ... and the other Arnold, Howard, Irving, Seymour and
so on.  But whether such a list actually existed, I have never known.

Subject: What's in a name?

Norman Fruman asks why so many first names of 2nd generation Jewish boys are
also the last names of British families.  I don't know the answer to the
general question, but one name that he didn't include in his list was
"Sumner."  Someone I know observed several years ago that this was, for some
reason, a particularly popular first name among Boston Jews.  It has even
been suggested that if you ever meet anyone, anywhere in the world, with the
first name of Sumner, you can be sure that he is Jewish and from Boston and
was born sometime in the early 20th century. 

I don't know why this is, either, but it's certainly an interesting
phenomenon.  I hope someone can explain it.

Subject: What to do?

To ignore or not to ignore?  That is the question.

Mirl Schonhaut Hirshan in Mendele (8.046, 4) complained recently that not
enough contributors had yet come to the defense of Noyekh Miller in response
to an ill-considered, uncomplimentary (to put it mildly) comment about
Noyekh's ability and position regarding Yiddish usage.  I am reminded of what
Ravnitski related in his memoir about Sholem Aleichem.  Israel Levy (in the
late 1880s) was owner and de facto editor of the Folksblat, the Yiddish
weekly that profited from publishing Sholem Aleichem's works.  However, the
strange Levy was a fanatic opponent of Yiddish and on occasion roundly
insulted Sholem Aleichem and other Yiddish writers.  This naturally upset
Sholem Aleichem who wanted to arouse others to vigorously respond to Levy. 
Eventually, he thought it over.  Ravinitski writes: 

(My translation)  Sholem Aleichem, thinking it over, decided it would be
better to ignore the Folksblat and its peculiar publisher as though they
shevak khaim lekhol khay geven [had died, in Levy's clumsy, tortured
invention] and had left this world.  He wrote me: "The best punishment for
that lunatic Levy is to say not a word about him, not even half a word." 

>From the Yiddish in "Tsum Ondenk Fun Sholem-Aleykhem" [In Memory of
Sholem
Aleichem], ed. Sh. Niger & I. Zinberg, Petrograd: I.L. Peretz Fund, 1917, pp. 
43-56. 

That's one recommendation about this sort of thing from the past.

Subject: feygl--AGAIN

I've had occasion to write this before. Perhaps the editor will review the
process for accessing such available materials: 

German _Vogel_ 'bird' yields the (Jewish) name _Fogel_;  German _Voeglein_ ,
a regional form of Veilchen 'Violet',yields the Yiddish name _Feygl_.

The Jewish _Fogel . . ._ surnames are derivable from the former. The _Feygl .
. ._ surnames MAY be derived from either, BUT the girls given name _Feygl_ is
unlikely to be derived from the former--it would then mean the plural
'birds', an unlikely name for a child.

Subject: Treblinka revolt/Wiernik family

Dear Mendele list,

I am interested in finding biographical information on a man named Jankiel
Wiernik, who was one of the leaders of the 1943 prisoners' revolt in the
Treblinka camp, escaped, and published an account of his internment in 1944
(first in Polish, then translated into Yiddish and English).  Wiernik had
been in the Warsaw ghetto before he was taken to Treblinka.  This account has
been reprinted a couple of times, most recently in Lawrence Langer's Art from
the Ashes (Oxford, 1995).  I am especially interested in determining his
birthplace.  Many thanks,
 
Jeanne Swack (possible relative of Jankiel Wiernik)

Subject: Snipishok and Bitshutsh

Can anyone tell me about the use of the towns "Snipishok" and "Bitshutsh" in
Yiddish literature?  These words were used as names for "mythical" places in
my family (akin to referring to "never-never land").  When the Soviet Union
was breaking up, I heard a reporter say "This is <so-and-so> reporting from
Snipishok" and I nearly fell off my chair.  I found out that Snipishok is a
suburb of Vilna, and Bitshutsh is an Eastern Galician town.  I would like to
learn more about the influence of these towns in Jewish culture. 

I am not a regular reader of this list.  Can you please send replies to
krovetz@research.nj.nec.com?  I will post a summary of what I learn to the
list. 

Thanks,
Bob Krovetz
