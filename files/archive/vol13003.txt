Subject: new Yiddish book

The Foundation for the Advancement of Yiddish Studies announces the
publication of "YIZKOR -- dee farmishpete shreiber", a 640 page novel
by the late Shmuel Gordon of Moscow.  The book is an absorbing tale of
tragedy and heroism, drama and suspense, brutality and nobility,
depicting the martyrdom of Russian Yiddish authors, poets and artists,
in the course of the infamous trials which culminated in the executions
in 1952.

When I met Shmuel Gordon in Moscow in the early 1990's, he conveyed to
me his two fervent wishes.  The first was, "Before I close my eyes
forever, I would like to see the Cave of Machpelah in Hevron" -- a
revealing confession by a communist Yiddish writer.  The other was to
have his novel published in Israel.  He passed away at age 89 in 1998,
without seeing either of his dreams fulfilled.

The publication of the book by the World Council for Yiddish Culture
represents a Hessed shel Emet in fulfilling the final testament of the
last Yiddish writer to survive the Bolshevik Inquisition.

The book is available by request (to the undersigned) without cost,
except for air mail postage and handling, in the amount of $13, to be
forwarded to Albert E. Marks Charitable Trust, 118 York Terrace,
Brookline, MA 02146.

Subject: Lid vegn Petrograd - anyone can help with lyrics?

Tayrer Mendelyaner,

Once in my childhood I have discovered on the attic of our dacha house
a pack of old 78 rpm recordings - indeed, Jewish ones. It apparently
belonged to my old Yiddish-speaking Moldovan relatives - probably those
plates were saved by my grandgrandmother from Balti before Nazis took
the town... some of the recordings are scratched badly, but we still
love them and keep as a family treasure. One of these carries the label
in yiddish "Petrograd" - the music is charming, but the record is too
bad to understand the lyrics... the refrain is "Nokh majne Petrograd,
majn sheyner Petrograd...". Other side is "Lamtsa-deritsa". Could
anyone help me with the lyrics? The Petrograd song also contains a
piece of Petr Leschshenko's amazing "Chubchik".

Dear friends, Mendele readers,

I am searching any biography and bibliography data of Jerzy Ohr
(Ohrenstein). I have only one article by him in Polish, | Polszczyzna w
argonie zydowskiem , Warszawa, 1905 It is about Polish impact in
Yiddish.

Any information you can provide will be appreciated. Thank you in
advance.

[Moderator's note: On Sept 7, 2001 Forward reprinted the following from
the 1926 Forverts: 
 Polish Jews finally eradicate a plague from which they have suffered
 for many years.  Jerzy Or -- the convert to Christianity who long held
 the position of overseer of the Jewish press and Jewish affairs in the
 Polish Ministry of the Interior, a man who has caused the Jews much
 grief -- has been removed from his post. Or, whose real name is Jerzy
 Orenstein, is a staff member of the anti-Semitic Polish newspaper Dwa
 Grosze and has supplied it with provocative material that slanders
 Jews. He translates items from the Jewish press and then uses them as 
 a point of departure for his anti-Semitic articles.

Subject: Di Royte Yidelakh

Dear Yiddishe Literati,

Does anyone know what Sholem Aleichem was referring to when he wrote of
DI ROYTE YIDELAKH? The dictionary defines it as the Ten Lost Tribes
across the Sambatyon but what does that have to do with SA?  Any
information would be greatly apprreciated.

Subject: Yiddish-Yinglish? Greenhorn

"Greenhorn" shows up in the OED in 1460 (greyn horne). The earliest
usage apparently referred to young cattle or oxen: green horns. But
over the years it developed related meanings: naif, newcomer, immigrant
and others. Does anyone have a clue as to why/how the particularly
strong affinity with Ashkenazi immigrants? We have the songs-"di grine
kuzine"  et. al and the, by now, well worn Yinglish usages. Perhaps my
premise is false, but I don't recall its use among Italian immigrants
for example.  Any ideas?

Marvin Engel

P.S.: This came up at a lecture audience of roughly 75 fairly well
informed, mostly elderly Jews and no one had a clue- unprecedented for
this opinionated group.
