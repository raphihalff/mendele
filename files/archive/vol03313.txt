Subject: migldik, loshn-koydesh

In the last issue of Mendele, Arre Komar discusses migldik and ekldik,
and the broader questions of language standardization.  While it may be
true that migldik has lost ground to ekldik, the principle of
standardization and Mordkhe Schaechter's "principle of specificity"
remain valid.  Thus we ought to use leyenen and not lezn, vunderlekh and
not vunderbar, moshel and not bayshpil.  The historical course of Yiddish
has been one away from German.  An approach which views Yiddish as an
independent language rather than an extension of New High Literary German
demands that Yiddish continue an independent course.  Thus we may create
new Yiddish words on Germanic stems present in Yiddish for centuries.  We
may not however simply find new words in the Langenscheidt Dictionary and
liberally sprinkle them in our journalistic and prose writings.  This is
an attitude of disrespect to Yiddish, assuming that Mame-loshn is a grade
B German "Mundart."  In the past many German words entered Yiddish
directly from German.  These words were often liberally used for sheer
prestige value, and not because they filled a lexical gap.  Thus many
authentic Yiddish expressions were replaced by foreign sounding
equivalents from German (witness:vunderBAR rather than vunderLEKH).
Sometimes the language was actually impoverished when a single German
word replaced a large number of home-grown expressions.  Yiddish language
planners do not want to create a language that never was.  They simply
want to eliminate superfluous Germanicisms which have driven out
perfectly good yiddish words, eg. a gerotener pruv vs. a derfolgraykher
farzukh.  If I recall correctly in traditional Yiddish, farzukhn means to
taste.  In German, versuchen means to attempt or to try, which in Yiddish
is pruvn. Thus there is no need for a confusing farzukh meaning attempt
in the German sense of the word in Yiddish.  No one is trying to create a
new language, except in cases where a new concept arises for which there
is no pre-existing word, eg. lekerl for lollypop, or beserveyser for
know-it-all.  In the case of the migldik, it is to be preferred because
it is homegrown, but ekldik has won the battle in general usage.
Nonetheless using the German-inspired ekldik does not rule out the use of
migldik.

Arre Komar also addresses the question of the loshn-koydesh component of
Yiddish, suggesting that currently, the latter component of the language
is becoming as dangerously all pervasive as daytshmerish once was.  As
evidence, the change in the language of the Forwards is cited.  It is
true that today's Forverts uses more Loshn-koydesh than the issues of the
forties but this is in fact more authentic!  The original Forverts was
heavily pro-Germanicisms and Anglicisms.  Its language has changed over
time to reflect a truer picture of authentic Yiddish as captured in
classic Yiddish literature.  The use of Loshn-Koydesh is as old as
Yiddish itself.  This is what split Yiddish off from the German stock
language originally.  Traditionally in Europe, the more scholarly one
was, the more one used Loshn-Koydesh.  It was a sign of education.  I
don't think that Yiddish has any natural boundaries on Loshn-Koydesh
usage.  Yiddish is unique in that it is defined by a culture, not by a
lexical history.  Thus Ma nishtana is fair game for inclusion in a
Yiddish text.  A Yiddish speaker might not know what ma or nishtana means
but culturally he is bound to recognize ma nishtana from passover.  There
are therefore no limits on losh-koydesh use.  Today's forwards is
actually quite restrained in its used of Hebrew-Aramaic.  Harkavy's
dictionary is crammed packed with Loshn-koydesh lexical items and phrases
straight out of the Jewish sources.

Thus the indo-european part of Yiddish lends itself to inventorization,
but Loshn-koydesh, that which makes Yiddish Jewish, will forever defy
inventorization!  That is the beauty and chaos of the language.  It is
the reflection of a culture.  As a supporter of normativism I am glad to
fight daytshmerizms.  The question of Losh-koydesh however cuts the very
center of Yiddish's unique identity and self-definition.  There are no
simple answers on how much is too much.

Subject: Caucasian Jews

Mark Southern asks about the Caucasian Jews' language.  There was in
September of 1992 a fine anthropological, etc. exhibition about these
peoples at the Haifa Museum, and I believe there should be a lot of
documentation available there for you, on paper, or even email, perhaps?
who knows?  But as to getting it, my own assumption that perhaps a letter
addressed to the Haifa Museum might actually reach it, though given
Israeli postage.  If you dont get through, you might email Prof Ada
Aharoni, who is an English prof and ask her for the address, at her
husband is at the Technion, and answers email that way.

CERRACCA@TECHNION.BITNET

Try that email address, and see what you get.  You can use my name and
apologiz e for the trouble.  She is not a Yiddishist, being a Cairene,
originally, altho ugh her husband Chaim, a chemist, might be.

Subject:  MENDELE in the FORVERTS

In today's issue of the Yiddish "Forward," under the regular rubric "In
der velt fun yidish" (compiled by Y. Hamer, a.k.a. Yosl Mlotek -- o.k.,
the secret's out, folks...), there is a dispatch from Yakira Frank
(Hagalili), of Stamford, CT, entitled "A kompyuter-nets vegn yidish mit
400 farinteresirte."  The article brings to the attention of "Forverts"
readers the existence of an electronic newsletter -- MENDELE -- that is
devoted to Yiddish.  I don't need to summarize the entire article, which
highlights some of the issues that have been discussed here over the past
couple of years (from daytshmerizmen to matse-bray [matzah brei], with
sidetracks into the genetic background of Ashkenazic Jews).  To me what
is most striking is the article's description of the e-mail medium by
which we subscribe and contribute to MENDELE:

"Ikh leyen yede vokh in 'Forverts' vegn di gezelshaftlekhe
tetikaytn oyfn yidishn gebit vos komen for ibern land un oykh in
oysland.  Dakht zik, az biz itst hot men nisht bashribn far ayere
leyener di 'elektronishe post', vos heyst oyf english 'E-mail'.

"Elektronishe post iz an oyfn fun shteln zikh in farbindung mit
akademiker un andere, iber gor der velt, mit der hilf fun a
kompyuter vos iz farbundn mit a telefon.  A sakh akademiker hobn
oysgefunen, az zey kenen zikh durkhshmuesn mit kolegn iber der velt

gedanken un shikn durkhn post tsu mekhabrim iber der velt velkhe
zaynen farinteresirt in di zelbe inyonim.

"Es zaynen itst faran hunderter grupes spetsyalistn, vos shraybn
zikh durkh oyf 'E-mail' -- lemoshl, vegn politik, literatur,
psikhologye, muzik... un oykh yidish!  Yede grupe hot a nomen un

az di grupe hot shoyn an erekh 400 abonentn, di merste in Amerike,
khotsh a hipshe tsol gefinen zikh oykh in Kanade un Yisroel."

What's the point, you might ask; WE already KNOW all of this!  Mit
vos bin ikh oysn?  Well, just this morning a co-worker of mine who
is, shall we say, very *close* to Yosl Mlotek and is a regular
contributor to the "Forverts," was asking me about MENDELE (she
had read Ms. Hagalili's article) -- how does one subscribe?  And
even though the dispatch excerpted here doesn't give technical
details (most "Forverts" readers presumably have yet to learn about
gophers, archie, veronica and ftp -- "forzetsung kumt," vi me flegt
shraybn, eyder s'iz gevorn oys daytshmerish), it gives enough of
a description, one hopes, to whet the appetites of some native
Yiddish speakers (and readers) to join the ranks of The 400.
(I can feel the trembling in the shames's boots.)

Subject: ShmulyAres

A belated thought. If it's been expressed already, forgive me. I've been
napping.

The process of derivation probably was as follows:

Standard Yiddish "toler" and Southern Yiddish "tu:ler" "tU:ler", perhaps
palatalized "tUl'er", plural "tU:l=ers" parallel to Yiddish
"stOl'er/stOl'ers" ; Next, pelorative "tU:lers-shmU:lers" (cf.
Cancer-shmancer); finally, even more pejorative, "shmul'Ares" parallel to
pejorative "stal'Ares".
