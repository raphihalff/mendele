noyekh miller asks about mendelistn grabbed by literarishe bleter.  I am 
grabbed. I have a half a year collection of literarishe bleter (1928) and
when I tell my friends about it's content (theater in paris, art in berlin,
psychoanlysis etc.) they just don't believe.

to your question. I have asked my father (he was a yiddish journalist and is
a yiddish writer) about books, prices etc. According to him, the prices were
rather high. But, the real problem was where to keep the books, in his
words: "you have to owe an appartment, in order to buy books". So what the
(not rich) Jews done in order to read books? There was a network of
libraries, run by political parties (from mizrachi to bund) and by trade
unions.

Subject: Yiddish newspapers in Paris

There is no more Yiddish newspaper in Paris.

The last one, Undzer vort, disappeared in june 1996. The day before the last
issue, an article was published on the front page of the great French
newspaper "Le Monde" to "celebrate" the disappearing of the last daily
Yiddish newspaper of the world. Actually, Undzer vort, with 3-4 issues a
week., was no daily newspaper during the last years. The publishers of
"Undzer vort" were very proud of this article (that was not the case of most
France's Yiddishists !) and the last front page of Undzer vort was dedicated
to this article : recognition lastly came from the French world... on his
last day, as if it was the first sign of the coming of the Messiah, a "yoyme
depagre. 

This fact is very symptomatic of the attitude of the majority of the old
generation toward Yiddish culture. As immigrants in a very assimilationnist
country, they shizophrenically considered that Yiddish culture was their
only but impossible way of life. They couldn't live in an other culture
because they were born in it, but it Yiddish culture for them and they
didn't see the necessity to teach Yiddish to their children. The coming
generations fortunately don't agree with this feeling, that's why the
revival of Yiddish culture has been so strong in France during the last
yeasr, and is still exponential.

Subject: Source for An-sky's Finfter Turem

I just finished reading Sh. An-sky's retelling of Der Finfter Turem in the
Sept 24 Forverts and was wondering where it was originally published and
whether a collection of folktales as retold by An-sky exists. 

Thanks,

Lewis Gutman

Subject: Emil Cohen

Yes, the name is Emil Cohen. I have both of his records (I think there were
only two): "Emil Cohen" and "Tsinagogues and Tsenters". Autographed by him
on the covers, because we bought them at an evening in Toronto when he came
to entertain (at our shul, about 20 years ago). 

Yes, they're funny. Haven't listened to them in a while. I like his
Gettysburg Address with simultaneous translation into Yiddish: "...conceived
in Liberty ... zi hot geshvenget in Liberty ... s'iz a kleyn dorf lebn
Monticello..." 

Have you checked the Judaica stores like Eichlers, or on-line Judaica
sources?  I believe his records were made into tapes as well, though I'm not
positive. 

[Interpreter for old Yiddish man in Court]
Judge: "Ask the man how old he is."
"Vi alt zayt ir?"
"Achtzik, biz hindert un tsvantsik."
"He says he's eighty to a hundred and twenty years old."
The judge gets angry and threatens to hold the old man in contempt.
[It goes on for a while, then someone helpful steps in to ask the question
instead of the interpreter:]
"Vi alt zayt ir, biz hindert un tsvantsik?"
"Achtzik!"

In answer to Benjamin Charles Serebrin's posting, Searching for Emil Cohen,
Cohen will be appearing at the Yiddish Culture Club of Century Village, West
Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Nov. 30, 1999, at l0 a.m.  He performed
there in March and was hilarious.  As a concession to his age' he now sits
during his shows.  Reach him re his albums at (561) 968-5191.

Subject: Emil Cohen

Emil Cohen was a Myron Cohen-type comedian, but far from Myron's rank.
Played the Borscht Circuit and occasional tv in the early days. I would
focus my attention for old records in the Miami area where there are several
stores that have almost anything. I can't recall the names but one of the
store names appeared regularly in the Sun-Sentinel's nostalgia column which
answered inquiries such as yours with a referral to these particular stores.
I bet that an inquiry to their consumer affairs desk would get you the
address. As for the chicken joke, it is one of the great old saws in our
repertoire. I'll tell it as I heard it for the first time over 45 years ago. 
I would have circulated it through Mendele but my heimish attempts at trans-
literation would set of all kinds of linguistic alarms. All I know about
Yiddish is what I heard from kindheit uhn. I never learned how to
phoneticize it according to the YIVO precepts and I stopped sharing anything
Yiddish with Mendele because some of the e-mail I would get from a few
subscribers bordered on the hateful if I should spell a Yiddish word the way
my mind's eye and ear told me that my tateh-mama's mamelushn might have been
spelled and spoken. So, with apologies for the orthography, grammar and
syntax, but not for my love of our delicious language, here is how I recall
the chicken story. You start by describing the scene. An old, patriarchal
man in traditional black coat, fur hat, long beard, etc., is sitting in the
dock and the gentile judge (what other kinds did they have then?)  has
summoned the court interpreter, one Mr. Schneider, to interrogate the
witness who has been accused of stealing a chicken. 

Judge: Ask him if he stole the chicken
Schneider: Hust du geganvet der hun?
Witness: (derisively) Ikh hub geganvet der hun?
Schneider: Your Honor, the man freely admits to having stolen the chicken
Judge: Ask him why he stole the chicken
Schneider: Fahr vus hut du geganvet der hun?
Witness: Awf kapores!
Schneider: Your Honor, he says he stole if for a religious observance  
Judge: Ask him if he knows that he can be put in jail for six months for this 
       crime
Schneider: Vayst du, chaver, ahz du kenst zetsen in tuhrma fahr zex 
                    monahten?
Witness: (In total denial, sarcastically) Ikh vell zetsen in tuhrma fahr zex 
                monahten?
Schneider: Your Honor, he is willing to serve out his term of six months
Judge: Then tell him he is going to jail for six months. Case closed.
Schneider: Chaver, du geyst in tuhrma fahr zex monahten
Witness: (angrily) Ikh hub dir in bud!
Schneider: (retaliatorily) Ikh hub dir in bud!
Judge: IKH HUB DIR BEYDER IN BUD!

Typical Yiddish spin and a lot more, including the justice system and the 
whole  mishugas of living as a serf and a Jew in that time and place. I hope 
you enjoy this version which must be one of hundreds. If you don't mind this 
knee-jerk response, I offer you at no extra charge my very favorite Yiddish 
joke which is a personal treasure of mine. The irony is in the same vein as 
the chicken joke and it comes at the end with a rush. If you don't get into 
it from the first word, you will have a bunch of words and a reaction of 
"what's so funny about that?"

New York courtroom scene, same as above. When Judge Reilly sees the Hasid 
witness in full regalia, he sends for the court interpreter, also named, by 
coincidence, Schneider. Schneider enters, approaches the bench and asks how 
he can be of service to the court. He is instructed to interrogate the 
witness.

Schneider: Chaver, vus iz dyne nuhmen?
Witness: (drawing himself erect in the box, smoothing down his long beard and 
his long coat) Sir, I would have you to understand that my name is Joshua 
Jacob Mordechai Epstein, the Second.
Schneider: (addressing Judge Reilly) Your Honor, der mahn zugt ahz zyne 
                  nuhmen is Joshua Jacob Mordechai Epstein, der Tsvayter.

Subject: royte

Although I am not a yidish scholar, I believe I heard something some 70
years ago which may be relevant.  My mother, a red head, born in Bucsacz
[spelling], told me the kids in her school often teased her because of her
hair color by chanting, 'Royte, royte, bleib a toyte,"  which, I assume,
translates roughly as "Drop dead, Red."  So, "royte" does seems to have
referred to her hair color.

RE: Jason Payne's translation query about "a royter Yid".  I believe this
refers to a Communist.
