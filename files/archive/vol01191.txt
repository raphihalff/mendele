When Reb Noyekh first proposed the creation of what was to
become MENDELE, he assured me that the readers of such a
group wouldn't be interested in Yiddish-American ditties.
(You can even look it up in mail.yiddish #36.) So, to prove
him wrong, I offer the following contribu- tion to the
ongoing discussion of Yiddish foodstuffs.  It's from
Country Yossi & the Shteeblehoppers, Vol. 5.  In light of
the academic nature of this mailing list, I shall restrain
myself and provide only the refrain.

The song is called "The Big Knacker", and is sung to the
tune of "The Big Bopper" (which readers might recognize
from the opening words of the refrain "Chantilly lace / And
a pretty face...", and possibly from the closing words "Oh
baby, that's what I like!"). The verses consist of one end
of a telephone conversa- tion between the protagonist
(speaking mostly Yiddish) and his bubby, who has invited
him to Shabbos dinner.  And the refrain contin- ues...

A Shabbos tish
Mit gefilte fish
Un a little chrain on de side
Some tcholent in the pot
Un a kugel nice and hot
Oy,
Makes me warm insi-i-ide
When the kholeptshes mit knaidlekh
Dreyen zikh in boykh vi dreidlekh
Un di tzimmes un di chicken
Macht di halz a bisl trikn
Ken men trinkn a l'khaim
Biz de kop iz in shamayim
Yo, yo,
Oh bubby, that's what I like!

[Sorry for the interruption. We now return you to the
regularly scheduled quality of MENDELE, already in progress.]

[From _Philly Stakes_, a (highly) forgettable whodunit by
Gillian Roberts.  The heroine is visiting Philadelphia's
Italian market.]

Amongst the various Italian delights, there was a square
tray of three-cornered pastries, each with a dollop of
filling.  I scanned the row of labels, unable to identify
which identified the tray.  "Zuccotto," one said.  "Il
Diplomatico."  "Chiacchiere della nonna." "Torta
Sbricciolona."

Those pastries..in an Italian bakery..  A great example of
cultural borrowing.  I wonder if they're the Zeppole di San
Giuseppe.  Do you think that means St. Joseph's hat?..
  
"Excuse me," I said to the woman.  I pointed at the
triangular pastries, tingling with the pleasure of making
an anthropological breakthrough.  This was how Margaret
Mead felt before comprehending whole societies.  "What do
you call these pastries?"

"Hamantaschen."
