Subject: Re: Skirt = ASPUDNICHE

I never thought that I would have anything interesting
to say about an ordinary word such as "skirt". I
already noted in an earlier contribution that I am not
particulary a Yiddish expert. So I have no idea whether
Leo Goldstein has found the most appropriate Yiddish
word for skirt. What I do know is that he is right
about the Polish origins of the word "ASPUDNICHE" that
he suggests for skirt. The Polish word for skirt or
petticoat is "SPODNICA" with an "accent aigu" on the O.
The O with accentis pronounced as the English "oo" in
for instance "roof", while the C is pronounced as "ts".

Subject: Diminutives and Plurals

I recently returned from a conference on language
typology and historical reconstruction where a paper on
German dialects brought up the subject of the relative
order at the end of words of diminutive and plural
markers.  I was able to provide the speaker with the
somewhat interesting example:

            Chasid sg.   Chasidim  pl.
            Chasidl sg. w/diminutive
            Chasidimlekh  pl. w/diminutive

Is this an isolated case in Yiddish? - I doubt it.
Where can I find anything written on the subject of the
order of these morphemes? More examples?

Thanks for any help.  I'll collect it and pass it on to
Carol Chapman of Manchester University (UK) who is
doing the research.

Subject:  Wolf Younin's dictionary of Hebraisms

In MENDELE 2.185 Robert Rothstein mentions the "Kurtser
verterbukh fun hebreishe verter in idish," by Wolf
Younin, which was serialized in the "Forverts" in 1978.
While this dictionary apparently was not released as a
book, it was meant to be published as such.  YIVO has a
photocopy of what I imagine to be page proofs of this
dictionary (probably prepared as a "cut-and-paste" job
from the "Forverts" columns themselves, with a small
amount of additional matter, e.g., the occasional
footnote).  It has been paginated as a book:  193
pages, total.  Younin died in 1984; I do not know the
fate of the book project.

Subject: Nit/nisht/nicht; orthography

nit, nisht, un nikht
====================

     I always assumed that, when people wrote nikht
around the turn of the century, it was part of the
fashion to imitate German spelling.  They also threw in
extra he's, which standard German has now dropped, etc.
Did anyone actually SAY nikht?  Even the Germans
didn't!

The great orthography wars
==========================

     In Mendele 2.181, Stephen Dowling suggests that
the alef-yud spelling for yid, yidish, etc. resulted
from religious scruples over writing yud-yud.  I had
never heard that before.  Is there confirmation of
this?  If it's true, how can they bear to write the
thousands of other words that contain two yud together,
such as eyns, tsvey, dray, etc.?

Subject: Query

The other day my mother used the expression YA-TEBE-DAM
for 'bigshot', and sure enough it's in Weinreich's
Dictionary, p. 203.  Can anybody tell me the etymology?
