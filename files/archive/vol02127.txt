Subject: Zukunft

In case any Mendelnikim missed it, there is a fascinating
article in the NYTimes Sunday book review, 12/20/92 on the
American published Yiddish "sotsialdemokraten" magazine
ZUKUNFT by Arthur Hertzberg.  This magazine is 100 years
old and still going, although its finances and readership
are now anemic.  Hertzberg tells an extraordinary story, as
much about Yiddish as about American Jews.

To: Yitzhak Kertesz
 
the "besorah" question now confuses me even more;
presumably, it should have been realized in the same way as
"Devoyre" AND "skhoyre" (Northeastern Yiddish "Dveyre" and
"skheyre"). Instead, we have "psure/psi:re" like
"gvure/gvi:re". Blaybt a kashe, as we say.
 
Concerning the segol: In Yiddish, "tsere" is
"tseyre/tsayre--even tsayray", a diphthong in "all" Eastern
Yiddish dialects. In  "A yiddisher mey/aylekh", and similar
words, the segol has merged with "tseyre/tsayre" and is
thus a diphthong. From what you say, Yiddish in Eastern
Hungary classifies these segolate nouns differently. I'm
pleased to know about this. What about "khesed"?
 
Still unclear to me from what you write: Do the Yiddish
words that derive from the Hebrew "tsere" have "e" or
"ey"--in Yiddish as distinct from Ashkenazic Hebrew?
 
In Yiddish, the "Elul", "emes" words appear to be the
result of a shift in stress from "eme't", "Elu'l". If the
NOW stressed vowels, which are in open syllable, had born
the original stress, we would have expected either
emes/*eymes or *eymes/*aymes, etc.
 
THE article on the subject was written by Dovid Katz "The
Wavering Yiddish Segolate" in the International Journal of
the Sociology of Language 24: 5-27.

No problem: gevure has m'lupum in Hebrew, Devoyre and
schoyre have choylem (and consequently both pronounced with
-ey- as in 'say' by Litvakes).

 >>*please*=*bitte*) A second question: does it make a

Do Eastern Hungarians follow Eastern (Ukraynish)
pronunciation which does not distinguish Hebrew long segol
from tseyre? How do you pronounce Paysech?

Subject: A Hanuka song

This is a little question arising from the Hanuka
celebration we had in our family last night.  My in-laws
entertained us with a yiddish song, probably well known to
everyone on the list, which they only partially remembered.

Please forgive my butchered Yiddish, but the chorus was
something like:

Was lernen Yingele

and then progressed through the alephbais with two words
for each of the letters.  They, however, could only get
through the first four letters -- through daled.

Can anyone send me the rest of the song?

Dan Breslauer
