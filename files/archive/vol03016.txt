Subject: Bintel Brief

I am a member of a Yiddish reading group that meets weekly in the
Hillel Building at the University of California in Berkeley under
the sponsorship of "Lehrhaus Judaica." There are roughly 15 students
in the group composed of University students, University graduates,
professionals, and retired individuals. Their backgrounds in Yiddish
are also varied, but I would say that none of the individuals in it
could be described as an "expert" or a "native" speaker.  I am one
of the elder members of the group.  As a youngster, I studied
Yiddish in a Sholem Aleichem Folkschule in the Bronx and in "Jersey
Homesteads" (now named "Roosevelt"), New Jersey before the
establishment of Israel. I am very surprised to find that the
general level in Hebrew is much higher than that in Yiddish among
the members of the group.

We have read, with great difficulty, a variety of works including
various short stories of Sholem Aleichem; Selected Stories of I.L.
Peretz, translated by Eli Katz, 1991; poetry contained in several of
the recent bilingual translations that are available, and a Yiddish
edition of "The Magician of Lublin" by I. Bashevis-Singer, published
by I.L. Peretz Publishing House of Tel-Aviv.

The group felt that it might be very rewarding for us to read
"Bintel Brief". I am familiar with an English edition of the work
that is still available: (A Bintel Brief. Isaac Metzker, ed., 1971;
Schocken Books, New York, 1990.), but I do not know whether the
original material is available in Yiddish.

My reason for contacting "Mendele" is to find out whether the
original Yiddish letters ever existed in the form of a book or
whether the letters only appeared in Yiddish in the "Jewish Daily
Forward."  I have not been able to obtain an answer to this question
that is authoritative.  A reference to this work (The Schochen Guide
to Jewish Books, B.W. Holtz, Schocken Books, 1992) states:  Bintel
Brief "makes available in English a remarkable collection of
letters, originally published in the famous "bintel brief" ("bundle
of letters") daily advice column of the Yiddish-language "Jewish
Daily Forward."  However, this source doesn't contain any
information about whether the original Yiddish letters are
available.  We would be interested and thankful for any information
concerning the availability of the original letters in Yiddish as
published in the "Jewish Daily Forward."

Subject: Literature

I'd like to second (or third, or fourth...) the comment that even
linguists are interested in literature.  Like many others who are
professionally in linguistics, I came to it for more rigor than a
literature degree seemed to offer, but never lost my enjoyment of
reading literary works and, to some extent, keeping up with literary
analysis.  Not contributing does not mean not reading and enjoying
the discussion.

Subject: Idioms, and a simile

1.  "es redt zikh azoy [azey]" = easier said than done; that's what
*you* think.  (In the documentary "Partisans of Vilna" produced a
few years ago, one of the interviewees, who had taken part in the
Vilna ghetto resistance, is describing the events; the interview
takes place in Israel, and he speaks in Hebrew.  As I recall, he
says something like "What we needed was some guns and ammunition,
and we'd be able to hold them off."  Then, wryly,  "Es redt zikh
azey."  Then back to Hebrew.)

2.  "vi amol" = from time to time; rarely.

3.  "yoshke pandre" = a disparaging name for Jesus Christ.  Is the
second element Slavic?  Hebrew?  Does it refer to out-of-wedlock
birth?

4.  "moyshe kapoyer" = someone who does things punkt farkert.

5.  "afn himl a yarid" = much ado about nothing; a tempest in a
teapot

*****************

And speaking of yaridn--"Funem yarid", boring or not, has at least
the distinction of beginning (maybe in the hagdome) with the
funniest simile in the world.  From memory:  A mentsh is geglikhn
tsu a stolyer.  A stolyer lebt un lebt, un dernokh shtarbt er.  Un
azoy iz mit a mentsh oykh.

Subject: rosl/dutsn

Zev Kesselman and Dovid Braun discuss "er dreyt zikh arum azoy vi a
forts in rosl".  I don't think it is particularly problematic.
"rosl" is not only "brine", it's also broth, and ,in connection with
"rosl fleysh", something like gravy.  So the expression would
translate something like "a fart in the gravy" (kh'bet iber ayer
koved)--a place where it REALLY has no business.  It even has a
certain ring to it in English.  D.B.'s "frantsoyz in rosey" is
wonderful, but my guess (it's only a guess) is that it is more
likely to be a euphemism for the "forts in rosl" than its source.

As far as "dutsn/duken/ditsn/diken" is concerned, my mother who came
from [di] country in Volin, and who always used the form [di] for
the 2nd person singular, nevertheless said "dutsn", not "ditsn".
Whether this was pronunciation was a personal accomodation. or
whether it reflected her native dialect, I don't know.
