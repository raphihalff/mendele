Subject: Introduction

We are writing from a small university from south Hungary, Pecs. I have been a
lurker on this list for a long time and, since a collegue and I have been
teaching jiddis for several years now might I ask you to send me personal
messages if you have ideas or suggested interesting material for the beginner
and intermediate jiddis course? (we deal also with literature, for example a
short study on Jichak Katzenelson occured last semester). Of course, i send my
ideas in return, I just thought "fresh blood" is always does some good
things....

thank you in advance,

Atilla Soltanuly

Subject: Jewish last names

There was a highly respected balalaika soloist in Paris by the name of Ter
Abramov.  Is "Ter" a common affix in Jewish last names?

Subject: What is a bris-itse?

Here (a week or so from our "due date") is another baby-related question from
Yankele and Yoyne-Brayne in Toronto -- this time cultural, not linguistic.

Weinreich's English-Yiddish dictionary lists the Yiddish word "bris-itse"
(beyz reysh yud sof yud tsadek ayen -- i.e. a feminine form of "bris".)  The
definition is  "celebration connected with girl's birth (a regional folk
custom)".

In our circles, how to celebrate a girl's birth in a Jewish way with due
honour is a hot topic.  People are generally under the impression that any
feminine equivalent of a bris is something innovative.  Here in this dry
little definition, however, is evidence that our foreparents already had
something of this nature.  But I've never been able to find out any more about
it than those few words in the dictionary.

Does anyone know anything about bris-itses and what such a "regional folk
celebration" would be like?  Oyb mir veln hobn a meydele, viln mir pravn a
brisitse -- oyb emetser ken undz derklern, vos dos iz!

A sheynem dank,

Yankev Lewis

Subject: Badkhonim

In response to: Sara Benor (5.234), David Goldberg (5.235), Bernard Katz
(5.237) and  Zachay Baker (5.238) I should like to offer some more
information and his art:

The badkhn is a two-faced character. He is a well known charachter in Jewish
society since the ancient days and shaped the image of Judaism until the late
nineteenth century. The badkhn-clown adapted himself to changes but never
changed his identity. In the nineteenth century he evolved into his final form
as the two-faced character - badkhn and clown: one half being serious,
sermonizing, learned; the other half being amusing, lively and entertaining.
The one amusing half - the clown - appears many times in Jewish sources, in
the bible, in the Talmud and later in musar books, and was very much apposed
by the rabbinical institutes because of the nature of his art: The laughter of
the leiz like his character, was carnivalesque, wild and chaotic, rooted in
the Dionysian cult and aiming to undermine the social order and its rules.
This lets is called in many other names: jester, clown and is known also as
marshelik. In the 17th century, when musar books appeared and influenced very
much the Jewish society, especially in east Europe, the lets adapted himself
to the new conditions and developed a new face in his character and art - this
was the serious side, the badkhn side, which was more a musar-zoger, a
darshen or magid, and also his laughter is a constructive tool, in line with
the organized establishment system of commandments and serving as its voice.

Subject: Oxford Institute problems of last year

Some of you may remember my problems with the Oxford Institute for Yiddish
studies, reported in Vol. 5.086 of August 18, 1995. The Institute charged me a
2000 USD for no service at all after I had cancelled timely the course due to
some health problems. It all resulted in problems with Visa, my bank and
subsequently with my mortgage and it took even months to realise a savings
account was still blocked for electronic transfer by this "affair".

It is only today that I received the confirmation from Visa that everything is
definitely credited back to my account. Despite several reminders over the
last months to the Oxford Institute requesting their supporting evidence of
the debit executed to my account, Visa only received credit-refusals but no
facts. Visa therefor decided to return all the money back to me.

I want to thank all mendelyaner who sent me mail with their personnal advise
on this matter including usefull information regarding the way the Oxford
Institute "operates". It helped me to keep my 2000 USD out of their pockets.

Now I decided to participate in the 2-weeks June program from the Brussels
university and I will probably join also to the brand-new Paris program (3
weeks starting begin July). This last one has the advantage to be in the
centre of Europe, and also interesting from a cultural and culinary (a lot of
jewish restaurants) point of view. As soon as I receive the program I will
post it on mendele. It should be a lot cheaper than other programs, less money
at risk or other kind of problems...
