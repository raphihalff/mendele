Subject: Internationale 

In a book that belonged to my grandparents, "dos revolutsionere rusland" (NY,
1917:  "aroysgegeben fun tsentral-ferband fun 'bund' in ferlag fun der
idisher sotsialistisher federatsiye in amerike") I find a three-verse version
of the Internationale that is similar but not identical to the versions
posted by M. Herzog and M. Wishner.  If it is of interest to anyone, please
e-mail me and I will be happy to post it.

Subject: When it comes to Judeo-Alsatian, I'm still confused!

Despite the heroic efforts of many people on Mendele (about a year
ago) to help me understand the difference between Eastern Yiddish
and Western Yiddish (as embodied in Judeo-Alsatian), it is still
far from clear in my head.  I'm still trying to refine my thoughts
on the matter and my aim is to boil it down to a single, clear,
descriptive sentence, which is probably someplace to which I will
never get.  The problem and its explanation are undoubtedly not so
simplistic.
 
However, I did receive a very enlightening letter on the subject
from Joachim Mugdan, professor of linguistics at the University of
Munster, and who may be a lurking Mendelyaner.  He has taken pity
on me because of the fact that I seem to be surrounded by a state
of natural confusion, and Joachim explains, with considerable
clarity, the differences that he perceives between the variants. 
This was a private letter to me and not intended as a scholarly
publication, but I found it so interesting that I reproduce it as
he wrote it, with any errors being of my introduction, not his. 
Perhaps if Joachim knew that I would find it so fascinating, he
might have spent more time on it and put in a lot more footnotes. 
Nonetheless, I found it very revealing as it stood.  Joachim, in
attempting to clarify Alsatian from Judeo-Alsatian (which is often
referred to as Western Yiddish), writes the following (letter is 
reproduced with Prof. Mugdan's permission):
 
       Alsatian (German Elsassisch, French Alsacien) is the
       traditional everyday language of Alsace.  And, believe it or
       not, it is a variety of German.  The Alsatian dialects (there
       are some minor regional differences) belong to the Alemannic
       dialect group, which most of Baden-Wurttemberg (roughly south
       of a line Karlsruhe-Augsburg), Vorarlberg in Austria and
       Liechtenstein.  Within Alemannic, Alsatian and the dialects of
       southern Baden are classifed as "Low Alemannic."  (As in all
       German dialect names, "high" and "low" don't imply "good" and
       "bad" but are purely geographic terms, referring to highlands
       vs. lowlands; i.e., more southern vs. more northern regions.)
 
       One of the most striking characteristics of Low Alemannic,
       which it shares with High Alemannic (Swiss German and some
       dialects in the extreme south of Baden and Alsace), is that
       the old long vowels [i:, u;, y:] (pronounced approximately as
       in English sea, you and French dur) have not become diphthongs
       as in most varieties of German and, for that matter, Dutch and
       English; e.g., [is] 'ice' (Standard German Eis) and [hys]
       'house' (Standard German Haus).  In these respects (and some
       others), the vowel system of Low Alemannic retains features of
       classical Middle High German, but it also exhibits quite a few
       innovations.  Some are shared by many other German dialects
       (e.g., the unrounding of the "umlauts" oe and ue, familiar
       from German gruen/Yiddish grin, etc.), others are
       geographically more limited (e.g., [a] in words such as [ase]
       (with "e" inverted) 'to eat', Standard German essen).  These
       developments have led to a peculiar vowel system, and that
       makes it quite difficult to recognize familiar German words in
       their Alsatian forms.  If you are not accustomed to High
       (Southern) German dialects in general, the consonant system
       and certain grammatical features may appear strange, too.
 
       I know two descriptions of Alsatian in English:
 
             Keller, R. E. (1961), German Dialects. Manchester:
             Manchester Univ. Press, 116-160 [dialect of Barr, sample
             text in dialect of Strasbourg]
 
             Philipp, Martha & Bothorel-Witz, Arlette (1990), "Low
             Alemannic," in: Russ, Charles V. J. (ed.), The Dialects
             of Modern German, London: Routledge, 313-336 [dialect of
             Colmar]
 
       A few years ago, a large Alsatian-French dictionary was
       published but I don't remember the title.
 
       Like other German dialects, Alsatian is normally not used in
       writing and is not taught in schools.  The dominant role of
       French as the written language (and the language of the media)
       has led to a decline of Alsatian, but in recent years, a
       movement to save it (as part of a general trend towards
       regionalism) has gained strength.
 
       Judeo-Alsatian (French judeo-alsacien), the (former) language
       of Alsatian Jews, is, in my opinion, a variety of German or,
       specifically, Judeo-German (judeo-allemand, Judisch-Deutsch). 
       Through the diaspora, Jews picked up the language of their
       gentile neighbours, and Germany was no exception.  Of course,
       they used many Hebrew and Aramaic words (and a few grammatical
       constructions influenced by Torah and Talmud) so that one can
       speak of specifically Jewish varieties (e.g. "Judeo-German,"
       "Judeo-Italian," "Judeo-Arabic," etc.), but such peculiarities
       don't constitute a separate language.  The fact that all
       Jewish language varieties are written with Hebrew letters is
       irrelevant in this regard - languages are not defined in terms
       of their writing systems (most of the world's languages aren't
       written at all), and there are a nunmber of languages which
       are written in different alphabets (e.g. Serbo-Croation in
       Latin and Cyrillic). 
 
       In medieval Germany, a unified standard language didn't exist;
       both Jews and gentiles spoke regional dialects, and their
       written texts reflect regional features, too.  But since Jews
       were predominantly townspeople, maintained close ties with
       relatives or business partners in other regions, and had to
       move a lot (for economic reasons and because of the numerous
       expulsions), the various regional varieties of Judeo-German
       tended to differ less amongst each other than the dialects of
       non-Jews, while the language of the Jews wasn't exactly the
       same as that of the gentiles in the same town or region.  So,
       Judeo-Alsatian has some typically Alsatian features, but among
       other things, it differs from non-Jewish Alsatian in that it
       has a dipthong in [haus] 'house.'  Another peculiarity, which
       it shares with most if not all varieties of Judeo-German (and
       certain non-Jewish dialects), is a historical change from long
       [o:] to [au] in words such as [braut] 'bread,' (standard
       German Brot; cf. Yiddish broyt) and Hebrew [taure {inverted
       e}] 'Tora' (cf. Yiddish toyre).  In Judeo-Alsatian, this
       development affects even words which have an [0]-coloured
       vowel in (gentile) Alsatian but [a:] in Standard German, e.g.
       [naudl] 'needle as opposed to Dutch Judeo-German [no:dl]
       (Standard German Nadel).  I have a French book on Judeo-
       Alsatian which lists typical words (primarily of Hebrew
       origin) and sayings; several "tableaux comparatifs" show some
       differences between Judeo-Alsatian, gentile Alsatian and
       Standard German, but the author just collected a few examples
       and explicitly says that he cannot provide a linguistic
       analysis:
 
             Uhry, Louis (1981), Un parler qui s'eteint: Le judeo-
             alsacien, Paris: Reproductions industrielles
 
       I found the book at Fraenckel's bookship in Strasbourg ...
       four years ago. [Leeson: this is the Librarie Cedrat, 19 rue
       de Marechal Foch, Strasbourg.]
 
       Some remarks on the widespread use of Judeo-Alsatian in the
       19th century can be found in Chapter 5 of:
 
             Hyman, Paula E. (1991), The Emancipation of the Jews of
             Alsace: Acculturation and Tradition in the Nineteenth
             Century, New Haven & London: Yale Univ. Press.                   
 
       Many scholars insist that what "we've called Judeo-German
       should be named "Yiddish" or, specifically, "Western Yiddish." 
       As I see it, their reasons are essentially ideological; they
       want to stress that the traditional language of the Jews in
       German-speaking regions differs considerably from the language
       of German gentiles and shares important traits with "Eastern
       Yiddish."  But if we apply the criteria linguists normally use
       in deciding whether X and Y are different languages or
       vairieties of a single language, the features of Judeo-German
       are not sufficient to classify it as a language separate from
       (gentile) German.
 
       When Jews migrated to Eastern Euopre, they did not simply take
       their (Judeo-) German dialects with them.  Rather, these
       different varieties of Judeo-German mixed, new characteristics
       - not shared by any dialects in Germany - developed (including
       a number of grammatical features borrowed from Slavic
       languages) and new dialect distinctions emerged.  As long as
       Jews in Germany (and Switzerland, Alsace, the Netherlands,
       etc.) continued to speak Judeo-German, there still was a
       certain linguistic unity between East and West, at least in
       the written medium.  That unity was lost when (in connection
       with the Emancipation) Jews in Germany began to use Standard
       German in Latin letters for written communication and
       eventually gave up Judeo-German as a spoken medium, too, while
       those in Easter Europe developed a new literary language
       distinct from literary German: modern Yiddish.  By similar
       processes of gradual divergence, culminating in the
       codification of separate literary standards, German and Dutch
       eventually became different languages, and so did Spanish and
       Portuguese, etc., etc.  But I don't think that those modern
       distinctions should be projected back into earlier periods in
       time when they simply didn't exist yet.
 
       Yiddish proper (alias "Eastern Yiddish" -- the language of
       Mendele and Mendelyaners) has been brought to Western Europe
       by several waves of immigrants from Eastern Europe.  Well into
       the 19th century, teachers were often "imported" from Poland,
       and in the reminiscenses of their former puils, one often
       reads about the "jargon" they spoke.  On a much larger scale,
       Yiddish-speaking immigrants came to cities in Germany, France,
       England, etc. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
       especially after World War I; there may well have been a small
       Yiddish-speaking community in Strasbourg, too.  In Germany,
       these "Ostjuden" were usually rather poor, and their
       assimilated brethren tended to look down on them; the
       situation in other countries is likely to have been similar. 
       Today, Yiddish speakers in Western Europe are, for the most
       part, elderly Holocaust survivors and post-war refugees from
       Poland, Romania, Russia, etc., or, in some cities (notably
       Antwerp), chassidic or yeshivish groups that consciously
       maintain Yiddish as their main, everday langauge and pass it
       on to their children.
 
       Still confused?  Or even more confused?  I'll never succeed at
       explaining the Great Alsatian Mystery.
 
Well, it is a lot more muddy than it was, but in some places it is
getting clearer.  What I think I heard here was that Western
Yiddish and Eastern Yiddish are not connected by virtue of their
origins being German in both cases, but are, in fact, separated by
this phenomeneon.
 
Oi am I confused.

Subject: Prager's comment, poem for a gravestone

A poem on a gravestone is not necessarily an academic exercise. The reader
asked for suggestions and I offered a transliteration of part of a Yiddish
poem that is on a stone. Is it the only and definitive applicable example
that can be culled from the whole canon of Yiddish poetry? Of course not. But
I did not set out to do that.

I am sorry about the errors I made in the transliteration. I fail Prager's
test for excellence. He fails my test for sensitivity. How silly to point out
that the  subject of the original poem is male not female -- as if poetry
cannot rise above the specific and still be understood. But I am even more
sorry that Prager failed to recognize the underlying metaphor in the
reference to blood and tears. The man who chose to put this poem on his
wife's gravestone did it deliberately. Both he and his wife, when she was
alive, were aware of the wanton destruction of their families and their homes
in Eastern Europe. Blood and tears -- bodily fluids if you will -- are never
far from death. Bathetic? Maybe. But neither the poem, nor my farmer friend
and poet were pedantic. 

Sincerely, 
Gertrude Dubrovsky

Subject: Poem for a Stone: Sutskever's _Mother_

To answer some questions:

Sutskever's poem that I quoted (in Vol 7.063) is called _Mother_ and has
eight subdivisions of perfectly honed, unforgettable images.

The quotation is section V111 - and the voice (or point of view) is the
mother's. In t he first 7 sections he speaks to her - of his anger at her
horrific death, his sorrow, his deep regrets. Such mournful lamentations.
Section V111, is his mother's reply:

                  "You speak to me
                    straight -
                    Don't, my child.
                    It's a sin, a sin.
                    Accept our separation
                    as just.

                    If you remain
                    I will still be alive
                    as the pit of the plum
                    contains in itself the tree,
                    the nest and the bird
                    and all else besides."

Always, he enfolds us in his affinity to nature.

My quest: Where can I find this in the original mameloshn?
