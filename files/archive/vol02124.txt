English version:)

        Clinton's running mate was Gore, Bush's running
        mate was Gor(e)nisht.

Subject: Names


To: P. Mett: If you have no objection, I would address you
as Peyrets. F most of us, I think "ay" would rhyme with
English "my". The only other person I know with that name
is from Vilna and his rendition is with "e" rhyme with get.
There are three groups of segolate nouns in Yiddish: those
like emes and (the month) Elul are universally with "e";
those lik khesed vary along with words like lebn: khesed,
kheysed, khised (in Voli and those like Pesach, seder,
melekh which have merged with tseyre in Yi and occur as
pejsakh/paysekh, etc. The Litvak says the brokhe "melekh ha
and speaks of "der yidisher meylekh". The Central Yiddish
speaker reads broke "meylekh hooylom" and speaks of "a
yidisher maylekh". If you knew all of this, forgive me for
going on.

Mikhl Herzog.

Subject: Spouses

for Ellen Prince: your point is nicely taken.  I am sorry
your husband is offended by the term.  I suppose that when
one leaves the poker game before midnight to warm the
wife's cold feet, as so many wives do seem to have, then
his pals will call him uxorious, as mild form of sarcasm?

Subject: -m versus -n

One of my colleagues in German, to whom I speak Yiddish so
that he cannot laugh at my German accent, has asked me why
Yiddish has `ah sheyneM dank', with what looks like a
dative ending.  I noted tonight that someone (my apologies
for not remembering the name) ended his comment/question
`ah groyseN dank'.  Any comments about the endings?

A sheynem dank for any information,
