Subject: Yiddish romanization

For those who are interested in that perennial topic, the romanization
(transliteration/transcription) of Yiddish, I would like to direct your
attention to a major article on the subject, "Ambiguities in the
Romanization of Yiddish," by Bella Hass Weinberg, which appears in the
latest issue of Judaica Librarianship (vol. 9, no. 1-2, Spring
1994-Winter 1995; pp. 58-74).  Dr. Weinberg is, among other things, a
professor of library science at St. John's University, consulting
librarian at YIVO (with which she has been associated, in various
capacities, for 25 years), compiler of the extensive index to the
English translation of Max Weinreich's History of the Yiddish Language,
editor of Judaica Librarianship (the flagship journal of the Association
of Jewish Libraries), and an acknowledged expert in romanization issues,
particularly (but not exclusively) as they affect libraries and their
readers.  The abstract of her article follows:

Romanization of Yiddish is one of the most complex activities in
Hebraica cataloging, especially for publications that do not use
Standard YIVO Orthography.  The Library of Congress has adopted the YIVO
table for vowels, but uses its own Hebrew table for consonants.  LC's
publication Hebraica Cataloging provides little guidance on Yiddish
Romanization, and MARC [machine-readable cataloging] records contain
many errors and inconsistencies in the application of the table.  YIVO's
linguistic reference works, notably Uriel Weinreich's Modern
English-Yiddish, Yiddish-English Dictionary and the translation of Max
Weinreich's History of the Yiddish Language, often contradict each other
in the Romanization of Hebraisms, while LC's rules for Romanizing
Hebraisms seem to have changed recently.

Hebrew titles for Yiddish works are particularly problematic, as there
are two possible pronunciations [i.e., Sephardic and Ashkenazic].  LC
appears to be moving in the direction of providing two Romanized title
entries in such cases.

Several transliterated Yiddish dictionaries have been published in the
past decade.  Some use the YIVO system; others do not.  The extent to
which these tools can provide assistance to Hebraica catalogers is
assessed.

Subject: A new www site

Mendele subscribers should visit the new web site of the SKIF Youth
Movement in Melbourne at :

http//yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au/~lozz/skif/index.html

It is an impressive Web site and particularly interesting for people to
see what new generations think and say.

There is also a transliterated page of Yiddish which will shortly be
displayed using Yiddish characters.

Subject: Stanford University Program In Jewish Studies

An announcement about an upcoming pair of talks at Stanford University,
Stanford, California

On Tuesday, Nov. 19, 1996, 8 pm (Oak West Lounge, Tresidder Union), Dr.
Joshua A. Fishman, Distinguished University Research Professor of Social
Sciences, Ferkauf Graduate School of Psychology, Yishiva University,
will speak on the topic of "The Holiness of Yiddish" (in English).

On the next day, at 4 pm (same location), his topic will be "Yiddish and
English: An Odd Couple" (in Yiddish).

This is the third annual lecture program in Yiddish studies given by
Stanford University, and the turn out is always substantial.  Two
different lectures have been established as the norm, one in English and
one in Yiddish.

Should anyone want additional information, call 415-723-7589.

And I (sob!) can't go to the second one. Oi!!

Subject: Yiddish vegetarian writers (Menke Katz)

There is no point to repeating the entire message, since many others
have already provided the information I had.  But I would like to second
the glowing words about Menke's wonderful personality.  He was like a
second (ideal) father to me, although once I moved down South we saw
each other only on all too rare occasions.  I still have a sense of
longing each time I think of his loss.

I can confirm that Menke was a vegetarian from a very early age.  Some
associations the question evokes in me:  accompanying Menke to a diner
near his home in Spring Glen, where he would always order the same
thing, his most beloved dish -- a baked potato.  As he sat with a friend
in a diner, eating a baked potato and talking, his eyes sparkled with an
intense warmth and life I have known from no one else.  (I suspect that
I might have experienced something similar from Wolf Yunin if I had
known him when he was a bit younger and in better health.)

Menke used to say "Di greste nesiye iz arum a tish!"  He also used to
say that a knife was meant for peeling fruit.  He told me he bacame a
vegetarian as a child.  He also told stories of digging in frozen fields
for potatoes during the famine of WW I, when his father was already in
the States but the rest of the family was still in Lithuania.  Read his
"Ode to the Potato."

Dovid, his son, told me that he himself had _never_ eaten meat.
(Incidentally, in addition to his scholarly achievements, Dovid is a
fine writer, under the pseudonym of Heershadovid Menkes.)

I met a Yiddish-speaking vegetarian who was part of a Yiddishe Kultur
leyen-krayz in San Francisco.  He attributed his vegetarianism to
Tolstoy's influence, and told me that many East European Jews were
influenced by Tolstoy.  I do not know how wide-spread that phenomenon
really is.
