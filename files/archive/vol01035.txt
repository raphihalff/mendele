Regarding the usage of "af tsalokhes..."

I had always thought that the phrase had to do with a
particular kind of bad luck (I've always been impressed
at how many ways one can refer to luck in Yiddish).  I
took it to mean, no matter what you do, it still comes
out wrong.  Something like the efforts underway in
Boston to undo the state's fiscal problems.

To Kessler: NO, NO, A THOUSAND TIMES NO!
"es geyt mir in lebn"  means  'it concerns me very
much', 'it's a matter of life (or death?)'.
 
To Dave:

i)"es geyt mir in lebn"  means  'it concerns me very
much', 'it's a matter of life (or death?)'.
 
ii) As Bob Berk points out, "af tselokhes/tselukhes"
means 'for spite'. 'On purpose' is better expressed by
"bekivn".  

iii) As for patah and komets. Remember that these are
marks on paper, not sounds. You're asking how a certain
sound in Hebrew became a different sound in Yiddish,
how [a] became [o/u]. Right? The answer that fits most
cases with respect to Yiddish words of Semitic, German,
and Slavic origin is this: both long [a:] and short [a]
in open syllable, in all of the stock languages yielded
[o] (in Standard and "Litvish" Yiddish) and [u] (in
Poland and the Ukraine). As examples, think of a word
that rhymes with "tselokhes". Got it? Also, compare
Yiddish "zogn/zugn" with German "sagen", Yiddish
"bobe/bube" with Slavic "babe?". Of course, there is
also a Yiddish regional variant "babe" in Volin(?) and
Galicia, with still another "bobe" alternant  in neigh-
boring Podolia, Bessarabia" (where we'd expect to find
"bube").  There ARE words that don't seem to obey this
rule, for example, "nakhes" but, I'm getting carried
away. If you're hungry for more, see Max Weinreich's
"History of the Yiddish Language", Chicago, 1980.
 
iv) Would you consider "al-pi-toes" 'mistakenly' a more
suitable term for  'accidentally' in the contexts in
which the need arises with your children?
 
To Bob Berk:

From UW's dictionary:
These seem to me to be the most useful:
chance "der traf"
by chance "al-pi-traf"
law of chance "der trafgezets"
at random "af traf"
random sample "der trafmuster"
Have you tried Mordkhe Schaechter for a lexicon of
mathematical terms (or are you his source?)?
Try the YIVO library for Yiddish math textbooks pub-
lished in pre-war Poland or the Soviet Union.
 
To Nicholas Eshelman:

There are a variety of Dictionary projects in the works
but they are not simply intended as an "update" of
Weinreich. Why dou feel it needs updating? Do you need
more English to Yiddish or the reverse? For the latter,
see Harkavy, 1928 (Yiddish-English-Hebrew) recently
republished by YIVO.
 
To Johan van der Auwera:

I'd be pleased to learn about the varieties of Yiddish
you encounter in Antwerp. Are variations determined by
geographic origin only, or are they also related to
membership in the various Hassidic groups that I assume
are represented in the Yiddish speaking population? Can
you tell yet?

In my family, when something was af tselokhes, it was
to say, Up shit's creek, or down the tube, or lost and
hopeless, ferfuhln, or ver fallen, as it were, lo st,
goodbye. What did the speak in Bessarabia, in my fami-
ly? Yankele

Subject: Introduction

I'm Martin Minow. My Yiddish is almost, but not quite,
non-existant (it was the language my parents spoke when
they didn't want the kids to listen), but I did pick up
some at an evening course at Harvard Hillel a few years
ago.  Since my handwriting is so bad even I can't read
it sometimes, I adapted a text editor for Yiddish
(showing that the spirit of Krasvilevke [spelling?] is
still alive in America).  (If anyone's interested, I do
have software that lets you print Hebrew/Yiddish from
an Atari PC.)

During the 1960's and 1970's, I was a linguistics grad.
student in Sweden, where I saw the disappearance of the
formal-informal pronouns -- the recent discussion in
Mendele on formal-informal in Yiddish sounded very
familiar.

One other thing worthy of note here: my mother's maiden
name is Rose Mitnick.  She was in the same high-school
class as Leo Rosten and thus appeared as the heroine in
"The Education of H*Y*M*A*N K*A*P*L*A*N." (I'd like to
find a copy of that book, by the way.)
