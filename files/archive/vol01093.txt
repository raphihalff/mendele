Subject: Brief Bio

Borekh-Hanimtse!

I studied comparative historical linguistics at UC Berkeley
[A.B. '79], and am presently working on an M.A. at Mills
College in Interdisciplinary Computer Science (Natural
Language Processing). I've also worked as a technical
writer in the software industry, and now I'm working part
time as a software archivist.

My interest in Yiddish is about 3 years old. A friend and I
visited his friend in Los Angeles who has a PhD in Modern
Hebrew Literature (with a minor emphasis in Yiddish Lit).
we got to talking about Yiddish, and soon he retrieved from
the attic boxes of Yiddish books. He had been a buyer for
the UCLA Yiddish library, and had usually picked up
duplicates for himself. After getting a rudimentary rundown
on the language and its literature, I hit the main library
at UC Berkeley, and did some research on my own, trying to
teach myself Yiddish (and a little Hebrew). This continues
(haphazardly) to today.

I also have a keen interest in films (I'm a movie critic on
a local radio station), so I started to look for showings
of Yiddish language films. So far, I've seen a couple of
classics from the '30's [Yidl mit a fidl, der Dybbuk] and a
documentary on the state of Yiddish in Israel today.

My interest in linguistics today (besides the computational
stuff) is in the relationship of standard dialects [AKA
official languages] to non-standard ones.  It's interesting
how Yiddish, even though it has supported a literature,
both original and translated works, has been consistently
viewed as a jargon instead of a language.

The latest addition to the Yiddish section of my library is
the first Yiddish grammar (in Russian) to be printed in the
Soviet Union in about 50 years. I guess now I'll have to
get around to studying Russian soon.

> In brief, my proposal is: oysgegrint.

I rather like that one.  Aside from Melekh's suggestion of
"baytn zikh di kolir", Raphael Finkel and his daughter have
suggested "roytln zikh".  But then, what if they're turning
yellow and brown instead of red?

Subject: Introduction

(Sorry for this late introduction--I 'was joined' to the
list before I even knew what E-mail was.)  My name is
Isabelle Kreindler and I am mainly occupied with the
nationality problems in the tsarist Empire and the Soviet
Union (exSU??)  Since moving to Israel this has become my
hobby -- I teach English as a foreign language at Haifa
University.  My connection to Yiddish is non-academic -- I
was born in Riga and had spoken Yiddish with my
grandparents (bobe and zeide loshen?) Feeling ashamed of
being almost an illiterate, I have recently bought a
Yiddish - Self Taught book, but haven't yet found the time
to work on it. (Anyway, spelling is not so important if we
use latin letters.) In the meantime it's a delight to find
myself connected with so many Yiddishist enthusiasts via
Mendele.  Perphaps if some Yiddish-Russian problems come up
in the future, I may be able to contribute. Thank you.
