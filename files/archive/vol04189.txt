Subject: Yiddish: An Emblem of a Culture...

For the record:

In a report about the 1994 Boston Jewish Film Festival Harvey Blume
writes (The _Forward_, November 11, 1994, p. 9):

In the Russian movie "Everything is Fine" an actor comments "overseas
flows the nation," as he watches the Jewish community melt away through
emigration. But the strongest statement here is surrealistically and
defiantly positive.

"Performances by a band of klezmorim, in dark glasses, flamboyant hats,
and magicians' robes--Haight Ashbury hits the Odessa steppes--punctuate
the narrative.  By the end, the klezmer musicians have grown in force and
numbers.  There is an outbreak of Yiddish song, dance, and graceful
clowning on every balcony of an apartment complex..."

The reviewer notes the assertive role, in several of the movies shown at
the Festival, played by Yiddish which has become an emblem of a culture
that refuses to disappear.

Subject: Go to the Folksbiene!!  Enjoy some Yiddish theater!!

The Folksbiene Playhouse, the oldest regular Yiddish theater in the
world, is presenting Yankev Gordin's classic play "Mirele Efros" this
season. Participants in the performance include Mina Bern, Richard/Zishe
Carlow, David/Dovid-Yudl Waletzky.  Zypora Spaisman plays the star role.

The Folksbiene Playhouse is located at 123 East 55th St. in New York
City. The theater's  and their phone number for more information and
ticket reservations is 212/755-2231. Performances are in Yiddish;
simultaneous English translation is available through headphones.  As far
as theater goes (not to mention _New York City theater_), prices are
reasonable, if not even cheap.  And at the same time, the quality is
high.

This year's season began in October and will end with a performance on
Sunday, January 8.  Performances are on Saturday nights and on Sundays at
2:00 and 5:30.  (No performances on Thanksgiving weekend.)  If you do not
reserve your tickets over the phone, you may buy them at the box office;
however, Sunday matinees are often sold out.

"Mirele Efros" at the Folksbiene Playhouse is definitely not to be missed
and is a superb Hanukkah gift, by the way, and typically a successful
group fund-raiser (special discounts are available for group ticket
purchases).

(If the Mendele conference idea proves too ambitious for next year, maybe
we should at least plan a theater party?!)

I may see you there on Saturday night, December 3.  (I'll wrap a big name
tag around my body, so you can identify me.)
