Subject: _Konin: A Quest_

I would like to recommend the book _Konin: A Quest_ by Theo Richmond
which was recently published here in the UK.

The book, though titled "a quest" is in reality more of an obsession that
the author has with his father's shtetl, Konin, a small town in central
Poland.

In a masterly reconstruction the author brings to life the shtetl way of
life in its entirety. He interviewed survivors in the UK, US and Israel
and scoured mounds of documents for every detail of what the place felt
and looked like. That he has been so successful is largely a testimony
to the author's perseverance over eight years.

Apart from the history of the town we are allowed to watch, from behind
the curtain, a woman giving birth and are witness to all the sgiles
which are almost as integral to the event as the cutting of the cord. If
the child is a boy we can follow him to kheyder and get a taste for some
lashes or even a booting. If he is from an enlightened household we are
guided to the gymnazie where for some time a Mr. Leopold Infeld, who
later went on to become a distinguished scientist and a close colleague
of Albert Einstein, was a teacher.

The author takes the reader for rides on the river Warta, for Lag
Bo'Omer outings, to the matza bakery, the non-hasidic and hasidic one,
and a host of other activities. The reader can peep in to the feldsher's
practice and find out the difference between plain bankes and geshnitene
(wet) bankes and see the tooth puller's 'surgery' done in public on
market days.

While all this is the Konin before the war he also presents the Konin
after the war in the living rooms of survivors the world over who all
live up to the paraphrased adage 'Jews can leave the shtetl but the
shtetl can't leave Jews'.

He attended a Konin memorial meeting in New York where a fracas breaks
out when one Koniner "declares out of the blue: 'I want to make a
proposal. I propose that all our meetings from now on we conduct in
Yiddish.' His wife shrieks: 'Why nut?' An opponent retorts: 'We forgot
already Yiddish.' The disrupter screams at the top of his voice: 'Our
fathers, our grandfathers talked Yiddish so I want to talk Yiddish."

He meets a communist in Haifa who still believes the Stalin purges are
an invention of the West while another survivor in London will barely
open his mouth until he has switched the tape recorder off. His
frustration is almost palpable when some ultra-orthodox survivors refuse
to meet him, mistrusting his motives.

Although he chronicles in detail the annihilation of the Koniner Jews
including the most horrendous eyewitness account of the mass murder in a
forest outside Konin, this book is not a lamentation of the atrocities
but a celebration of life. Life lived in piety with a purpose, with
faith and belief. Of men, women and children who had very little but
nevertheless made do of what they had and in a way succeeded more than
their descendants (where there are any left) in today's generation.

If there is one thing that interests the author more then Konin it is
his own yikhes (ancestry). When dealing with kheyder teachers he mentions
his grandfather who was a rebe but is quick to add that he was a humane
melamed. Where he mentions a suicide in Konin which rattled the whole
shtetl and the victim happens to be related to him he interposes in
parentheses that it is only by marriage.

In that vein he tries to add any lustre he can to Konin itself. He
admits that 'Konin produced no great and famous son' but nevertheless
tries hard to prove that Napoleon 'might' have slept there. As a last
resort there is always Barry Goldwater who is a Konin descendant.

The last phase in his journey is a return to Konin with a London Koniner
who offers to accompany him.

I sensed there a similar feeling which I felt when I returned with my
father to his birthplace. That while to the locals everything is simply
a matter of time that this used to be like this and like that, to
someone who was slung out of there by the thread of his or her life it
is all a different world. One world is the hundreds of years that Jews
lived in Poland which came to an abrupt end in 1939 and the other world
begins in 1945 where the Jews live on in faraway lands and Konin withers
away with the in-between years being an unimaginable abyss.

Things are not 50 years ago or 60 years age but 'faren krig' and 'nokhen
krig'. Before the war and after the war.

The book is a gem for the shtetl mayvin and a must for anybody with even
the slightest interest in the matter.
