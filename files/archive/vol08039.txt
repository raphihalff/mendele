Subject: yiddish and knesset

Re: Yoshua Kleinman's comments on YIddish and Knesset -- while i cannot
question his right to an opinion, even one that is so different from mine, I
would like to beep in with a few facts and clarifications. And a question
that I hope gets to the heart of the matter. 

1. The issue is not whether Knesset should endorse Yiddish, but rather having
endorsed it in the form of a law --that it live up to its already existing
endorsement, as it already has for Ladino, also the subject and beneficiary
of the same Knesset law. 

Usng his criteria, does it mean that the Ladino folks give back the 1-1/2
million shekels they received for Ladino classes in the Israeli school
system?? 

2 Hebrew is not the lingua franca of the Jewish state - it is its official
language. Yiddish is the lingua franca of Ashkenazi Jewry all over the world,
and has been so. arguably for over a thousand years. 

3. In "fremde lender" we have no "breyre" but to grow Yiddish as a private
enterprise. But in Eretz Yisroyl, the homeland in actuality or in potential
for every Jew in the world -- should the historic tongue of 2/3 of the
settlers ,Ashkenazim,and the surviving heritage of 5 million kdoyshim be
merely a private enterprise - like kite flying or other harmless but
unimportant activity??? 

Further comment: only in Israel can we make such a demand that Yiddish be a
respectable part of the curriculum. We YIddishists outside of Israel need to
lend our voice and support because a great injustice is being done to
Yiddish. It's time to take off the gloves, put pressure on the very folks
that are sitting on the promised, nay mandated, 1-1/2 million shekels for
Yiddish limud in the Israeli schools, so that there may be a hemshekh for
Yiddish among the youth of Israel.

Subject: yiddish in schools

It is very interesting to me that some people think one can preserve a living
language by teaching it in schools. My first language was Yiddish and when I
went to public school I did not know how to speak English. I have met
secular people who have tried to  learn Yiddish at college , at home etc.
Their nostalgia may be satisfied but they can't speak Yiddish. I am of average
intelligence and took 3 years of German in college and I can't speak German
fluently. Unless Yiddish is a living spoken language it will become as
Latin,except in the orthodox homes where it is spoken daily. Not all orthodox
or even black hats can speak the language. I  know this from experience. In
any case I wish all who attempt to preserve Yissish the greatest success.

From: "L.M. Bruyn" <troia@wxs.nl>
Subject: The Call of the zealous clarion

Do I understand it correctly: Is the Idea that Yiddish should be taught in
all Israeli schools as a subject that is part of the normal curriculum? Is
that in the law that was passed by the Knesset?  If that is the case the
Commission (with the 'Arab educational expert' at the head and others who
speak no Yiddish) will have at least 4 years work ahead to develop a Yiddish
Curriculum, Yiddish course materials, a system of testing, and a teacher
training college. They won't be able to do it on the budget to be provided,
so what are we talking about? 

Political pressure from Jews or non-Jews from countries outside Israel on
Israel is not known to be very effective or positive in general. Interfering
in foreign politics is a very American notion, detested by most other
nationals.

Subject: 1. Shprintse; 2. suffix -ine; 3. Argentine

1. Dovid Braun has informed me that Dovid Katz has proposed quite a different
etymology for the name Shprintse. Not Esperanza but some bird-name. Does
anyone know where Dovid Katz's explanatioin appeared? Does anyone know
anything more about the name Shprintse? Speaking of bird-names, recall the
surpring "non-bird" origin of Yiddish _Feygl_. 

2. For more -ine words, try the song _Di grine kuzine_.

3. Claudia Oxman: Concerning Yiddish Folklore & Ethnography in general, write
to Barbara Kirshenblatt Gimblett krshnbtt@acf2.nyu.edu She can certainly help
direct you to songs about some of the rather unique features of the history
of the early East European Jewish community/ies in Argentina--gauchos,
tmeyim, etc.

Subject: suffix -ine

You cannot think of any other feminine noun with the suffix -ine except
frenkine? Think of grafin(y)e, keyserine, heldine, genosine, frayndine,
khavertine (according to Volf Yunin and Meir Hurvits used in Belarus),
khazerin(y)e, terkinye (Mendele Moykher Sforim), kinigine (Yudl Mark),
knyazin(y)e, etc. Furthermore:  balerine, blondine, etc. 

Sincerely,
Mordkhe Schaechter/ Reb Motale Tshernevitser

Entferndik af mirele hirshan's kashe vegn anglitzizmen in yidish ... ikh meyn

Itzt, mitn hindzikht fun sof-yorhundert, hobn mir efsher an ander perspektiv.
Mir zeyen di oytzres vos english hot tzugetrogn tzu undzer lebediker shprakh,
vi eykh di oytzres vos yidish hot tzugebrakht der englisher shprakh. 

zikher iz do a "caveat" -- un di shomrim fun mame loshn veysn beser vi ikh,
vos fara grenetzn me darf shteln. tzum bayshpil, nitzn an english vort
onshtot a yidish vort stam in der velt arayn, vi vinde onshtot fentzter -
meyn ikh az dos iz nit neytik. ober verter vi peyde, nekst-dorke, u.a.v. 
shpiglen op di yidishe velt un tzaytgayst. 

Answering Mirele Hirshan's question about anglicisms in Yiddish ... I think
this is a question of the spirit of the times. When our teachers (from the
seculorshules) and the Yiddish intellegentsia in general, came to America in
the 1910's to 20's, they brought with them Yidish with all the trimmings,
including Slavisms. 

The immigrants quickly grabbed onto English words, even created such words as
"allrightnik", " boytchik", etc.For Yiddishists like these, this represented
a danger -- that Yiddish would become so Anglicized. that it would hardly be
recognizable. 

Now, hindsight from the end of the century, we have perhaps another
perspective. We see the treasures that English brought to our living
language, as well as the treasures Yiddish has brought to English. 

Of course there is a "caveat" == and the guardians of mame loshn know better
than I, what boundaries we need to erect. for example, to simply use an
english word in place of a yiddish word for no reason, such as vinde for
fentzter == i think perhpas this is not necessary. but words like peyde,
nekst-dorke, etc. mirror the the yiddish world and spirit of the times.

From: Varga96@aol.com
Subject: Englishisms

A yashe koyech to Marjorie Schonhaut Hirshan for her comments on why slavic
words have a hechsher and english immigrants to yiddish are treyf.  Was there
a vote taken among all Yiddish speakers to decide where our fence is?  Why
wasn't I invited?  Ironically it smacks of the same mentality as anti-
immigration tendencies- who decides at what point newcomers are no longer
welcome, in a territory made up of newcomers?  Some rather subjective
decision making on whose accent is right or wrong, or whose words got into
the language on time , on the part of the Academie Yiddishais.

Subject: Camp Naivelt

For a forthcoming article about H. Leivik in JCRS Sanatorium (Denver), we
noticed that Flora Bloomgarten ("Mrs. Yehoash") wrote to Leivik c.  1932 from
Camp Naivelt in upstate New York.  Can anyone enlighten us about the
political orientation of Camp Naivelt?  We'd love to hear any anecdotes about
the camp, too. 

A sheynem dank!
