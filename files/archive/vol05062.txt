Subject: Vinkl

I know that I've already asked this question, but having received only
one (and thanks for it!) reply I thought I'd try again. A graduate
student here at Brandeis is very eager for information about the word
"vinkl" and its current usage to mean 'club','group- meeting' and the
like.  Does anyone have any ideas?  Thank you in advance!

Subject: Origins of Yiddish

I am not competent to contribute to this discussion, but I can clarify
one point.

I think the "New" Synagogue that Alice Faber mentioned as having been
built in Prague in the 16th century is the Staronova Synagoga, also known
as the Altneu Schul, which I have stood in front of.  The sign on it says
that the original "old" portion was built in 1290; other local sources
say 1270.  The "new" portion was built around the outside of the original
structure.

Subject: Origins of Yiddish

alice, just a note on prague: the jewish community in prague is
documented as having been in existence for nearly a thousand years. and
the jewish cemetery is, i think, the second oldest existing cemetery in
europe and the oldest existing jewish cemetery in europe--it's very old!
(it's also a very beautiful city--i heartily recommend a visit!)

question for beatrice, mihkl, et al: elye bokher lived and worked in
italy, as i recall. where in italy? do we know if he lived in a jewish
community or just hung out with the bishop or cardinal he worked for? if
a jewish community, do we know what language they spoke? this of course
was pretty late--15th-16th century--but, if there was a germanic-speaking
community of jews in (northern) italy _then_, there surely had to be one
earlier, right?

as you can see, i'm obsessed with this idea that they were speaking
german before they ever got to germany. the more i think about it, the
more i want to bet on it. i recently had to present a paper on language
contact effects in yiddish at a creole conference in amsterdam. i started
writing the paper and threw in the usual line 'yiddish wears its history
on its sleeve'. imagine my surprise when it hit me that we do not know
what language they spoke just before coming to germany! suddenly yiddish
goes sleeveless... amnesia, wiped out, gornisht. it just doesn't make
sense. all the linguistic evidence points to them having spoken a semitic
language before german--the massive borrowings, even in basic vocabulary
(ponim, tokhes...), possible motivations for word order changes,
pragmatic influences, lots of stuff. but, pace you-know-who, it's hard to
imagine a semitic-speaking community surviving any length of time on the
european continent and we presume they didn't fly nonstop from the middle
east to munich... :) so, when i recently learned about the deeply
entrenched existence of german in northern italy down to the present
time, i felt and feel that that's it! that's the 'missing link'!  we've
been assuming they didn't speak germanic till they got to germany but we
can't figure out what )ther_ european language they could have been
speaking, so maybe they were speaking _yiddish_ before they got to
germany! (that is, their dialect of the local german dialect in northern
italy.) and it's easier to imagine going to italy from some place where
they could have been speaking semitic than to germany, i think.

not having the encyclopedia judaica at home, i just checked my 1991
jewish travel guide. the listing for merano, a town in the area i'm
talking about, certainly shows the current presence of german in this
region:

merano: synagogue and community offices, via schiller 14. telephone
23-127. president: federico steinhaus.

the guide also notes that gorizia/gradica (same latitude, farther east)
has a cemetery dating back to 1371.

one fringe benefit: for those who delight in how old yiddish is, this, if
true, would make yiddish a lot older than has hitherto been supposed
since it would predate the arrival in germany. :)

Subject: Origins of Ashkenazi Jewry

I have been intrigued by the recent discussions on the origins of Yiddish
and even more importantly on the origins of Ashkenazi Jewry. To see what
additional information was available on the Internet, I searched the Web
for "Ashkenazi" using the Lycos search engine (http://lycos.cs.cmu.edu/)
and discovered a home page maintained by Kevin Brook:

(http://acad.bryant.edu/~kbrook/khazaria.html)

that contains a good summary of information on the demographics of the
question along with a number of references for further research.

Suggested readings:

"Khazarian Hebrew Documents of the Tenth Century" by Norman Golb and
Omeljan Pritsak

"The History of the Jewish Khazars" by Douglas Morton Dunlop

"The Thirteenth Tribe" by Arthur Koestler

"The Ashkenazic Jews: A Slavo-Turkic People in Search of a Jewish
Identity" by Paul Wexler

"Khazar Studies: An Historico-Philological Inquiry into the Origins of
the Khazars"  Volume I.  by Peter Golden

Subject: Papirene kinder

David Herskovic asked about a concentration-camp song called "Papirene
kinder" (5.056); Stanley Werbow reported hearing it long before the war
(5.061).  The theme of photographs (sent by children in America to their
parents in the old country) as "papirene kinder" seems to have been used
more than once. Responding to an inquiry in their _Forverts_ column on
February 22, 1991, Yosl and Khane Mlotek quote a poem by Y. Adler
entitled "Papirene kinder," and in their column of two weeks later they
cite a song with the same title with words by Morris Rund and music by
David Meyerowitz (1867-1943).  The Mloteks were unable to find any
published information about Morris Rund, but report that he was supposed
to have been a street-singer in New York in the years before World War I.
(They also quote other variants sent in by readers in 1973.)  The two
lines quoted by fraynd Herskovic resemble part of the refrain to the song
by Rund and Meyerowitz:

		Papirene kinder hob ikh oyf di vent,
		papirene kinder -- un brekh mayne hent!
		Papir iz gevorn fun mayn fleysh un blut,
		ikh klog, veyn un shray -- un umzist mayn geshrey.
		Di shtiklekh papir, vos filn den zey?
		Papirene kinder hob ikh oyf di vent!
